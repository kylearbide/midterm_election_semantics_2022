Loving God, we give You thanks for

Amen.

f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE 
YUREK 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, as 
we mark today, the 79th year since 
Pearl Harbor, I want to tell you about 
my friend, George Yurek, who, when he 
got into the Army in 1942, volunteered 
for bomb disposal. He went to Cor-
regidor, ‘‘The Rock’’ of the Philippines. 
His unit was in the first amphibious 
wave on the island. There were so 
many landmines there that, with U.S. 
troops amassing for landing, they had 
very little time. They had to defuse the 
landmines by hand, and they called for 
volunteers. 
Sergeant George Yurek of West Wyo-
ming, Pennsylvania, volunteered to 
defuse landmines by hand, and he 
defused hundreds of them. It is impos-
sible to count how many American 
troops he saved by his actions. 
For his heroism in the Pacific, 
George Yurek was awarded a total of 
four Bronze Stars for valor. 
Last week, at the age of 98, George 
passed away, after mentoring countless 
young people in all the Wyoming Val-
ley. 
George and his late wife, Ellie, were 
married for 67 years. They leave three 
children, Greg, George, and Ann, and 
seven grandchildren. 
May God rest his soul. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CHERI 
FLEMING 
(Mr. GARCIA of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
GARCIA 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to 
a dear friend and to honor the life of 
someone very special to my hometown 
of Santa Clarita. 
Ms. Cheri Fleming, a radiant mom, a 
beautiful wife, a savvy businesswoman, 
and an avid philanthropist, passed 
away on November 16. 
Cheri was an icon in the Santa 
Clarita Valley. She was the brilliant 
and shining essence of everything that 
is great about my hometown. She led 
with grace. She succeeded in business 
with humility. She supported charities 
with endless generosity. She loved her 
friends and family intensely, always 
giving one of the most warm hugs you 
can imagine. 
As a philanthropist, Cheri was one of 
the primary reasons why so many non-
profit organizations in our district are

thriving and providing services and 
hope to countless thousands. 
Today, she is with God, but she will 
always remain in our hearts, Mr. 
Speaker. 
My deepest condolences go out to her 
family and especially her husband, 
Don, who is also one of the greatest 
Americans I have ever known. 
May God bless the Cheri Fleming 
family, and may God bless Santa 
Clarita in the wake of her loss. 
f 
CBO SCORE OF THE MORE ACT 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, it 
was sad that my Republican colleagues 
were unable to understand why we 
voted to reform our failed prohibition 
of cannabis. They don’t care about hon-
oring the will of the people and they 
are unable to grasp the enormity of the 
racial injustice and damage by selec-
tive enforcement against young Black 
and Brown Americans. 
But the CBO score may have some 
other reasons for them. It shows that 
the MORE Act would reduce 73,000 per-
son-years of prison time, saving $1 bil-
lion. It would increase revenues by 
$13.7 billion. It would provide $3 billion 
for job training and legal aid to people 
harmed by the war on drugs. 
While doing all of this, it would re-
duce the Federal deficit by $7.344 bil-
lion. 
Even if you don’t care about reducing 
the damage to Black and Brown Ameri-
cans or honoring the will of the people, 
the economics make it clear: Once 
again, the people are right, and the pol-
icy deserves strong congressional sup-
port. 
f 
HONORING BILL RANEY 
(Mr. MCKINLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MCKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Bill Raney as he retires 
from the West Virginia Coal Associa-
tion. 
Nearly 40 years ago, in the West Vir-
ginia Legislature, Bill and I began 
working together, advocating on behalf 
of the coal industry and the families 
who depend on it. Today, we continue 
to work together, fighting for those 
same families, but now with a national 
perspective. 
He has led West Virginia through the 
best and the worst of times for coal. 
Bill is an icon in the industry, and his 
legacy is filled with remarkable accom-
plishments. He is a colonel in the West 
Virginia Reserves, has chaired many 
statewide organizations, and has been 
nationally recognized for his advocacy 
of coal. 
Bill 
Raney 
exemplifies 
the 
true 
Mountaineer spirit, serving others to 
make West Virginia a better place. 
It has been an honor to work with 
Bill, and I wish him and his wife, Pam, 
a well-deserved retirement.

CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
NEEDS 
OF 
GEORGIA’S 
FIFTH 
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to draw the Chamber’s attention to 
critical needs for Georgia’s Fifth Con-
gressional District. 
I know it has been a familiar trope to 
suggest that this week is going to be 
the new infrastructure week. The ad-
ministration has announced several 
different infrastructure weeks, in fact. 
But it is not just a talking point in my 
district. In my district, there are sev-
eral projects that require the attention 
of this Chamber. 
They include the Clayton commuter 
rail, Campbellton Road BRT and rail 
extension, Bankhead rail to Indian 
Creek extension, and Clifton Corridor 
transportation plan. 
Tackling these projects accomplishes 
many ends. It is an economic revital-
ization project, as it connects vital 
American companies like Microsoft to 
greater Atlanta. It is an environmental 
imperative, as getting folks out of cars 
and onto mass transit decreases CO2 
levels. It is a jobs imperative, as it cre-
ates many well-paying jobs. It is a ra-
cial 
justice 
imperative, 
as 
these 
projects will service communities his-
torically neglected. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MARTIN 
NESMITH 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
a very special person, Mr. Martin 
NeSmith. 
Martin was a natural-born leader 
who dedicated his life to serving oth-
ers, including serving his country in 
the National Guard. 
Following his graduation from Geor-
gia Southern University, he began his 
career in the automobile industry and 
became the youngest dealer, at 24 years 
old, when he purchased a Chevrolet 
dealership in Claxton, Georgia. 
His kindness and selflessness ex-
tended to every area of his life, includ-
ing his business ventures. For example, 
in the early 1990s, he revolutionized the 
car business with the ‘‘No Hassle Buy-
ing’’ concept because he wanted every 
customer to be honored and treated 
with respect. No hassle buying means 
customers get the best deal right away, 
without the need to negotiate. 
His dedication to the automobile in-
dustry earned him the highest honor 
an automobile dealer can achieve: the 
Time Magazine Quality Dealer Award. 
This award recognizes car dealers who 
exhibit 
exceptional 
performance 
in 
their dealerships and perform distin-
guished community service. 
Martin 
was 
a 
wonderful 
philan-
thropist within his community and be-
yond, and he led by example through-
out his life. 
He was also known as a man of integ-
rity who kept his word in all he did, 
and he never met a stranger. 
I was deeply saddened to hear of the 
loss of such an incredible person. My 
prayers go out to his family, friends, 
and community during this most dif-
ficult time. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will 
postpone 
further 
proceedings 
today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which the yeas and nays are or-
dered. 
The House will resume proceedings 
on postponed questions at a later time. 
f 
REAFFIRMING STRATEGIC PART-
NERSHIP 
BETWEEN 
UNITED 
STATES AND MONGOLIA 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 1100) reaffirming the 
strategic 
partnership 
between 
the 
United States and Mongolia and ob-
serving the 30th anniversary of democ-
racy in Mongolia, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1100 
Whereas the United States and Mongolia 
established diplomatic relations in January 
1987, and since that time the relationship has 
grown stronger based on shared strategic in-
terests, security cooperation, democratic 
values, good governance, and respect for 
human rights; 
Whereas, since its peaceful democratic rev-
olution 
in 
1989, 
Mongolia 
has 
charted, 
through a series of initiatives, a successful 
path to multiparty democracy and a free 
market economy; 
Whereas, in 1990, the Government of Mon-
golia declared an end to a one-party, author-
itarian, political system and adopted demo-
cratic and free market reforms; 
Whereas, in 1992, Mongolia adopted a con-
stitution establishing a parliamentary de-
mocracy, becoming the first country in Asia 
to transition from communism to democ-
racy; 
Whereas, in 1999, the Government of Mon-
golia invited the Peace Corps to establish its 
program in the country and has since hosted 
1,437 volunteers in English and health edu-
cation; 
Whereas Mongolia has shown its commit-
ment to a ‘‘third neighbor’’ relationship with 
the United States by sending troops to sup-
port United States operations in Iraq from 
2003 through 2008 and Afghanistan since 2009, 
and Mongolia has a strong record of troop 
contributions to international peacekeeping 
missions; 
Whereas 
successive 
Mongolian 
govern-
ments have taken notable steps to strength-
en civil society, battle corruption, and spur 
economic development;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6863 
December 7, 2020 
Whereas the Parliament of Mongolia, the 
State Great Khural, has engaged with Con-
gress, including through the House Democ-
racy Partnership, thereby promoting respon-
sive and effective governance through peer- 
to-peer cooperation; 
Whereas Mongolia began as a partner to 
the Organization for Security and Co-oper-
ation in Europe (OSCE) in 2004, graduated to 
become a participating state in 2012, and par-
ticipates actively in the work of the OSCE 
for stability, peace, and democracy; 
Whereas Mongolia has regularly invited 
the OSCE and other organizations to send 
monitoring teams to its Presidential and 
parliamentary elections; 
Whereas Mongolia has also been an active 
member of the Community of Democracies 
(CoD), a global coalition of countries that 
support adherence to common democratic 
values and standards, and Mongolia has not 
only remained active since the founding of 
the CoD in 2000 but also successfully chaired 
the CoD from 2011 through 2013; 
Whereas, in addition to supporting the 
OSCE and CoD, Mongolia supports demo-
cratic initiatives while participating in a 
wide range of other global institutions; 
Whereas most recently, on June 24, 2020, 
Mongolia successfully organized parliamen-
tary elections, strengthening its commit-
ment to democracy and the rule of law; 
Whereas the success of Mongolia as a de-
mocracy and its strategic location, sov-
ereignty, territorial integrity, and ability to 
pursue an independent foreign policy are 
highly relevant to the national security of 
the United States; 
Whereas climate change in Mongolia has 
contributed to severe droughts, higher tem-
peratures, and extreme winter weather con-
ditions, resulting in mass deaths of livestock 
and economic hardship for people living in 
rural communities, especially the nomadic 
population; 
Whereas the United States has provided 
support to Mongolia through the Millennium 
Challenge Corporation through an initial 
compact signed in 2007 designed to increase 
economic growth and reduce poverty and a 
second compact signed in 2018 involving in-
vestments in water infrastructure, including 
supply and wastewater recycling, as well as 
water sector sustainability; 
Whereas, on September 20, 2018, the United 
States and Mongolia signed a joint state-
ment and the Roadmap for Expanded Eco-
nomic Partnership, outlining the intent to 
deepen the bilateral commercial relationship 
through full implementation of the obliga-
tions under the Agreement on Transparency 
in Matters Related to International Trade 
and Investment between the United States of 
America and Mongolia, signed at New York, 
September 24, 2013 (in this preamble referred 
to as the ‘‘United States-Mongolia Trans-
parency Agreement’’), and to collaborate in 
supporting Mongolian small- and medium- 
sized enterprises through various programs 
and projects; 
Whereas according to the Bureau of the 
Census, trade between the United States and 
Mongolia is modest but growing, with a total 
value of trade in 2019 between the two coun-
tries of approximately $217,500,000, including 
$192,700,000 in United States exports to Mon-
golia and $24,800,000 in United States imports 
from Mongolia; 
Whereas Mongolia is a beneficiary country 
under the Generalized System of Preferences 
program, but its use of the program remains 
low, as in 2018 only $3,300,000 of exports from 
Mongolia to the United States entered were 
under the program; and 
Whereas, on July 31, 2019, the United 
States and Mongolia declared the bilateral 
relationship a ‘‘Strategic Partnership’’ and 
noted the shared desire— 
(1) to intensify cooperation as strong de-
mocracies based on the rule of law through 
safeguarding and promoting democratic val-
ues and human rights, including the free-
doms of religion or belief, expression, includ-
ing internet and media freedom, assembly, 
and association, anticorruption and fiscal 
transparency, and youth and emerging lead-
er development; 
(2) to cooperate in promoting national se-
curity and stability across the Indo-Pacific 
region so that all countries, secure in their 
sovereignty, are able to pursue economic 
growth consistent with international law 
and principles of fair competition; 
(3) to deepen national security and law-en-
forcement ties through collaboration on bi-
lateral and multilateral security, judicial, 
and law enforcement efforts in the region; 
(4) to strengthen cooperation in multilat-
eral engagements such as peacekeeping, hu-
manitarian assistance, and disaster pre-
paredness and relief operations; 
(5) to expand trade and investment rela-
tions on a fair and reciprocal basis, support 
private sector-led growth, fully implement 
the United States-Mongolia Transparency 
Agreement, promote women’s entrepreneur-
ship, and continue to explore support for in-
frastructure under the new United States 
International Development Finance Corpora-
tion with the new tools provided under the 
BUILD Act of 2018 (22 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.); 
(6) to strengthen border security, prevent 
illegal transshipment and trafficking, ex-
pand cooperation on civil aviation safety and 
oversight, and efficiently facilitate legiti-
mate travel between Mongolia and the 
United States; 
(7) to increase cooperation in addressing 
transnational threats such as terrorism, 
human trafficking, drug trafficking, the pro-
liferation of weapons of mass destruction, 
cyberattacks, transnational organized crime, 
pandemics, and other emerging nontradi-
tional security threats; 
(8) to continue to develop an environment 
in which civil society, social media, and a 
free and independent media can flourish; and 
(9) to maintain high-level official dia-
logues, encourage bilateral exchanges at all 
levels of government, and further develop 
people-to-people exchanges to deepen en-
gagement on issues of mutual interest and 
concern: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) underscores the importance of the rela-
tionship between the United States and Mon-
golia and remains committed to advancing 
this Strategic Partnership in the future; 
(2) encourages the United States Govern-
ment to help Mongolia use its benefits under 
the Generalized System of Preferences pro-
gram and other relevant programs to in-
crease trade between the United States and 
Mongolia; 
(3) urges the United States International 
Development Finance Corporation to expand 
activities in Mongolia to support economic 
development, diversification of the economy 
of Mongolia, and women-owned small- and 
medium-sized enterprises; 
(4) urges Mongolia to address climate 
change and continue to work with the UN 
Environment Programme, the Global Cli-
mate Fund, and other global institutions to 
strengthen climate change resilience; 
(5) urges private and public support to help 
diversify the economy of Mongolia through 
increased cooperation and investments, as 
well 
as 
infrastructure 
and 
other 
vital 
projects; 
(6) supports the resumption of the Peace 
Corps program in Mongolia once the COVID– 
19 pandemic has subsided; 
(7) urges the Department of State, the 
United States Agency for International De-
velopment, and other relevant agencies to 
continue to support Mongolia’s democratic 
and economic development and efforts on 
anticorruption; 
(8) calls for the continued engagement of 
Mongolia in the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe, the Community 
of Democracies, congressional-parliamentary 
partnerships, including continued high-level 
parliamentary exchange, and other institu-
tions that promote democratic values, which 
reinforces the commitment of the people and 
the Government of Mongolia to those values 
and standards; 
(9) reaffirms the importance of civil soci-
ety to the continued democratic develop-
ment of Mongolia; 
(10) encourages the Government of Mon-
golia to build a regulatory system that sup-
ports and encourages the growth and oper-
ation of independent nongovernmental orga-
nizations and continues to pursue policies of 
transparency that uphold democratic values; 
(11) urges Mongolia to continue their com-
mitment to free, fair and credible elections; 
and 
(12) encourages the Government of Mon-
golia to continue legal reform, build institu-
tional capacity, and improve the independ-
ence of other democratic institutions. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on H. 
Res. 1100, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this year marks 30 
years 
since 
Mongolia’s 
democratic 
transition. Mongolia is a true success 
story, a landlocked country squeezed 
between two huge neighbors, China and 
Russia, that has nonetheless become a 
shining democratic breakthrough story 
in Asia. 
As Mongolia’s so-called third neigh-
bor, the U.S. should continue to build 
upon our shared interests and commit-
ment to democratic values and further 
advance our strategic partnership. 
From national security to economic 
stability, Mongolia has demonstrated 
its commitment to our partnership by 
hosting annual peacekeeping exercises 
and participating in U.S.-led programs 
like the House Democracy Partnership 
and the Open World Leadership Center. 
Our countries must also continue to 
partner closely on global warming. Cli-
mate change is a pressing concern for 
all the world and has already gravely 
affected the livelihood and well-being 
of the Mongolian people, who now face 
widespread livestock and crop losses, 
as well as escalating extreme-weather 
events.

Chairman. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States and 
Mongolia have a robust relationship, 
distinguished by our shared democratic 
ideals and strengthened by close eco-
nomic and diplomatic cooperation. 
This year marks the 30th anniversary 
of democracy in Mongolia. Mongolia 
was the first nation in Asia to transi-
tion from communism to democracy, 
marking an important juncture in the 
continent’s history. 
Years later, Mongolia remains an im-
portant democratic partner in the 
Indo-Pacific but finds itself in a chal-
lenging location, sandwiched entirely 
between Russia and China. What hap-
pens in Mongolia has direct implica-
tions for the United States. If malign 
actors compromise Mongolia’s terri-
torial integrity or ability to pursue 
independent foreign policy, the secu-
rity of the United States is also at 
risk. 
I have consistently warned about the 
Chinese Communist Party’s malign ac-
tivity around the world as the former 
chairman and current ranking member 
of the House Asia, the Pacific, and 
Nonproliferation Subcommittee. I was 
also 
encouraged 
to 
see 
the 
rec-
ommendations released this year by 
the China Task Force. 
After months of classified and un-
classified briefings, the China Task 
Force released a report with 82 key 
findings and more than 400 forward- 
looking recommendations. Many of 
these focus on the CCP’s predatory 
Belt and Road Initiative, which is infa-
mous for its debt trap diplomacy. 
Mongolia is a formal participant in 
this initiative, and China currently 
supplies the largest portion of their 
foreign investment. This is why it is 
essential that the U.S. continue to de-
velop our strategic partnership with 
Mongolia. We must be their most 
meaningful third neighbor, and that 
term describes the Mongolian relation-
ship with countries other than China 
and Russia. 
One of the ways we can do this is by 
strengthening Mongolia from within by 
supporting small and medium enter-
prises and industries like the cashmere 
production. 
This past year, I reintroduced the 
Mongolia Third Neighbor Trade Act, 
which would allow duty-free entry of 
Mongolian cashmere into the United 
States. This one bill would create over 
50,000 jobs, it is estimated, in Mongolia, 
primarily women jobs, at a cost less 
than $1 million over a 10-year period to 
the American taxpayers. 
The cashmere wool industry is par-
ticularly 
important 
to 
Mongolia’s 
economy; but while Mongolia produces 
over one-third of the world’s cashmere, 
almost all finished products are proc-
essed and exported from China. Duty- 
free entry for the United States’ im-
ports of Mongolian cashmere would 
benefit the United States by facili-
tating increased trade with Mongolia 
and reducing U.S. imports of Chinese 
cashmere products. The measure would 
likewise benefit Mongolia by reducing 
Mongolia’s economic dependence on 
China and promoting the development 
of Mongolia’s garment industry, an in-
dustry in which 90 percent of workers 
are women. 
We must also offer a better alter-
native through initiatives like the 
Third Neighbor Trade Act and this res-
olution. That is exactly what this bill 
does by reaffirming our relationship 
with our like-minded partner, Mon-
golia. We will never allow adversaries 
to undermine peace and stability in the 
Indo-Pacific region. 
Mr. Speaker, in closing, for over 
three decades, the relationship between 
the United States and Mongolia has 
continued to grow and strengthen. 
Mongolia is a strong democratic part-
ner in the Indo-Pacific, and the United 
States has become an important third 
neighbor. 
I would like to congratulate the Mon-
golian people on their 30th anniversary 
of democracy and look forward to con-
tinuing to build our partnership. 
Mongolia’s success as a democracy 
and continued sovereignty is extremely 
relevant to the security of the United 
States, the Indo-Pacific region, and the 
world. For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to support this res-
olution, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to strongly 
support H. Res. 1100, which recognizes 
Mongolia’s commitment to democracy, 
security, cooperation, and respect for 
human rights and reaffirms the impor-
tant growing partnership between our 
two nations. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to, once 
again, thank Ms. TITUS and Mr. YOHO 
for their leadership on this resolution. 
I urge all Members to join us in sup-
porting it, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 1100, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘A resolution 
reaffirming the importance of the stra-
tegic partnership between the United 
States and Mongolia.’’. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CALLING FOR GLOBAL REPEAL OF 
BLASPHEMY, 
HERESY, 
AND 
APOSTASY LAWS 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 512) calling for the glob-
al repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and 
apostasy laws, as amended.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6865 
December 7, 2020 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 512 
Whereas Article 18 of the International 
Declaration of Human Rights states that 
‘‘[e]veryone has the right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion; this right 
includes freedom to change his religion or 
belief, and freedom, either alone or in com-
munity with others and in public or private, 
to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, 
practice, worship and observance’’; 
Whereas many countries continue to have 
criminal blasphemy laws and punish people 
who engage in expression deemed by the gov-
ernment to be blasphemous, heretical, apos-
tate, defamatory of religion, or insulting to 
religion or to religious symbols, figures, or 
feelings, and such punishment can include 
fines, imprisonment, and capital punishment 
including by beheading; 
Whereas blasphemy laws have affected 
Christians, Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Baha’i, 
secularists, and many other groups, are in-
consistent with international human rights 
standards because they establish and pro-
mote official religious orthodoxy and dogma 
over individual liberty, and often result in 
violations 
of 
the 
freedoms 
of 
religion, 
thought, and expression that are protected 
under international instruments, including 
Articles 18 and 19 of the International Cov-
enant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); 
Whereas the United Nations Human Rights 
Committee stated in General Comment 34 
that ‘‘[p]rohibitions of displays of lack of re-
spect for a religion or other belief system, 
including blasphemy laws, are incompatible 
with the [ICCPR].’’; 
Whereas the United States Commission on 
International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) 
has found that blasphemy charges are often 
based on false accusations, are used for sec-
tarian or political purposes, and foster reli-
gious intolerance, discrimination, and vio-
lence; 
Whereas USCIRF has found that at least 70 
countries had blasphemy laws as of 2018; 
Whereas these laws were present in 18 Mid-
dle East and North African countries, 8 coun-
tries in the Americas, 18 Asia-Pacific coun-
tries, 14 European countries, and 12 Sub-Sa-
haran African countries; 
Whereas the Pew Research Center found 
that countries with laws against blasphemy, 
apostasy, or defamation of religion were 
more likely to have severe governmental re-
strictions on religion, and to experience so-
cial hostilities based on religion, than coun-
tries that did not have such laws; 
Whereas restrictive laws beyond those pe-
nalizing blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy 
further limit religious freedom, such as ex-
tremism laws— 
(1) in Russia that have been used to ban Je-
hovah’s Witnesses as an extremist organiza-
tion and fueled persecution of this religious 
group; 
(2) in China, to arbitrarily detain an esti-
mated 800,000 to 2,000,000 Uighur Muslims in 
internment camps because they followed Is-
lamic rituals and practices; and 
(3) in North Korea, to detain an estimated 
50,000 to 70,000 Christians in labor camps be-
cause they followed the tenets of Christi-
anity; 
Whereas an international group of experts 
convened by the Office of the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Human Rights rec-
ommended in 2012 that ‘‘[s]tates that have 
blasphemy laws should repeal the[m] as such 
laws have a stifling impact on the enjoyment 
of freedom of religion or belief and healthy 
dialogue and debate about religion.’’; 
Whereas blasphemy laws are inconsistent 
with United Nations resolutions adopted by 
consensus since 2011 recognizing that reli-
gious intolerance is best fought through 
positive measures, such as education, out-
reach, and counter-speech, and that crim-
inalization of speech is warranted only for 
the prevention of imminent violence; 
Whereas according to the annual religious 
freedom report published by the Department 
of State in 2015, attackers in Bangladesh 
killed 
five 
allegedly 
anti-Islamic 
or 
secularist writers and publishers, and injured 
three others; 
Whereas in response to these killings, the 
Home Minister of Bangladesh, rather than 
condemning the murders, called on bloggers 
and others to refrain from writings that 
could hurt the religious feelings of others 
and added that violators of the warning 
would be subject to prosecution under the re-
strictive religious freedom laws of Ban-
gladesh; 
Whereas a 2016 report by USCIRF on Ban-
gladesh found that religious and civil society 
groups fear that increasing religious extre-
mism will result in more criminal attacks 
and threats; 
Whereas restrictive religious freedom laws 
validate and promote social violence tar-
geted at religious minorities and dissenters, 
whether Christian, Muslim, secularist, or 
other; 
Whereas USCIRF has found that in Paki-
stan, blasphemy laws have been used to pros-
ecute and persecute Muslims, Christians, 
secularists, and others; 
Whereas according to a Pew Center report 
on religion and public life, Pakistan stands 
out for having one of the highest levels of re-
strictions on religion when both government 
restrictions and social hostilities are taken 
into account; 
Whereas USCIRF has found egregious ex-
amples of the enforcement of blasphemy 
laws and vigilante violence connected to 
blasphemy allegations in Pakistan, where 
blasphemy charges are common and numer-
ous individuals are in prison, with a high 
percentage sentenced to death or to life in 
prison; 
Whereas, as of May 2018, USCIRF was 
aware of approximately 40 individuals on 
death row for blasphemy in Pakistan or serv-
ing life sentences; 
Whereas Asia Bibi was sentenced to death 
for blasphemy in 2010 and was held for 8 
years, until the Supreme Court of Pakistan 
overturned her conviction in 2018, upheld her 
acquittal, and granted her permission to 
leave the country to flee the threats against 
her in 2019; 
Whereas Pakistan selectively enforces the 
blasphemy and anti-terrorism laws against 
minority religious groups, including by spe-
cifically targeting Ahmadiyya Muslims such 
as Abdul Shakoor, an 80-year old optician 
and bookseller who was recently released 
after serving over three years in prison on 
such charges; 
Whereas blasphemy laws in Pakistan have 
fostered a climate of impunity, as those who 
falsify evidence go unpunished and allega-
tions often result in violent mob attacks or 
assassinations, with little to no police re-
sponse; 
Whereas in 2017, the Christian Governor of 
Jakarta, Indonesia, was convicted for blas-
phemy of Islam and sentenced to two years 
in jail; 
Whereas several countries that maintained 
blasphemy laws have recently taken steps 
towards removing these provisions, including 
Greece, Ireland, and Canada; 
Whereas blasphemy laws in the United 
States were invalidated by the adoption of 
the First Amendment to the Constitution, 
which protects the freedoms of thought, con-
science, expression, and religious exercise; 
and 
Whereas the United States has become a 
beacon of religious freedom and tolerance 
around the world: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) recognizes that blasphemy, heresy, and 
apostasy laws inappropriately position gov-
ernments as arbiters of religious truth and 
empower officials to impose religious dogma 
on individuals or minorities through the 
power of the government or through violence 
sanctioned by the government; 
(2) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State to make the repeal of blasphemy, 
heresy, and apostasy laws a priority in the 
bilateral relationships of the United States 
with all countries that have such laws, 
through direct interventions in bilateral and 
multilateral fora; 
(3) encourages the President and the Sec-
retary of State to oppose— 
(A) any efforts, by the United Nations or 
by other international or multilateral fora, 
to create an international anti-blasphemy 
norm, such as the ‘‘defamation of religions’’ 
resolutions introduced in the United Nations 
between 1999 and 2010; and 
(B) any attempts to expand the inter-
national norm on incitement to include blas-
phemy or defamation of religions; 
(4) supports efforts by the United Nations 
to combat intolerance, discrimination, or vi-
olence against persons based on religion or 
belief without restricting expression, includ-
ing United Nations Human Rights Council 
Resolution 16/18 (2011) and the Istanbul Proc-
ess meetings pursuant to such resolution, 
that are consistent with the First Amend-
ment to the Constitution; 
(5) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State to designate countries that enforce 
blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy laws as 
‘‘countries of particular concern for religious 
freedom’’ under section 402(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the 
International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 
(22 U.S.C. 6442(b)(1)(A)(ii)) for engaging in or 
tolerating severe violations of religious free-
dom, as a result of the abuses flowing from 
the enforcement of such laws and from 
unpunished vigilante violence often gen-
erated by blasphemy allegations; 
(6) urges the governments of countries that 
enforce blasphemy, heresy, or apostasy laws 
to amend or repeal such laws, as they pro-
vide pretext and impunity for vigilante vio-
lence against religious minorities; and 
(7) urges the governments of countries that 
have prosecuted, imprisoned, and persecuted 
people on charges of blasphemy, heresy, or 
apostasy to release such people uncondition-
ally and, once released, to ensure their safe-
ty and that of their families. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
512. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6866 
December 7, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, in this age of partisan 
division, one of the foundational Amer-
ican values still has the power to bring 
us together across the aisle: the de-
fense of every human being’s freedom 
of religious conscience and freedom of 
thought against government persecu-
tion. With H. Res. 512, we act today to 
stand up for religious and intellectual 
freedom in a world gone mad with reli-
gious discrimination, religious oppres-
sion, and religious violence. 
H. Res. 512 calls for global repeal of 
laws punishing blasphemy, heresy, and 
apostasy, 
three 
religiously 
defined 
thought crimes that have no actual 
victims and, thus, no place in the 
criminal law of free nations. Yet gov-
ernments in 84 countries, from Saudi 
Arabia, Iran, and Somalia to China, 
Russia, and Bangladesh, still use laws 
like these to intimidate, arrest, pros-
ecute, and incarcerate members of mi-
nority religions, disfavored faiths, and 
freethinkers. 
Putting people in jail or even con-
demning them to death for religiously 
subversive speech was not unknown in 
American colonies. In Massachusetts, 
Puritan Governors hanged Quakers for 
their 
heretical 
lectures 
in 
town 
squares. 
But our enlightenment Constitution, 
especially our First Amendment free 
exercise and antireligious establish-
ment clauses, put us squarely on the 
path of rejecting blasphemy laws and 
these other relics of inquisition, holy 
crusades, and New England witchcraft 
trials. Our law has gotten rid of obso-
lete offenses like blasphemy and apos-
tasy because they have a purely reli-
gious character and do not refer to em-
pirical social harms. 
Blasphemy is making impious or sac-
rilegious statements about established 
churches or doctrines. 
Heresy is taking religious or intellec-
tual positions at odds with an estab-
lished religious orthodoxy. 
Apostasy is breaking away from a re-
ligious orthodoxy or a church. 
As offensive as we might consider 
other people’s religious views and ut-
terances, in America today, people’s 
thoughts and words about religion are 
absolutely 
protected 
by 
the 
First 
Amendment. But in many parts of the 
world where religion is still actively 
weaponized by theocratic and authori-
tarian governments, these imaginary 
offenses can still get you thrown into 
jail, harassed, and executed, or simply 
stopped and torn limb from limb by 
state-sanctioned lynch mobs. 
Religious people of the wrong faith 
are the most common victims of blas-
phemy and heresy laws. 
You might be a practicing Christian 
or Hindu, Mr. Speaker, in an officially 
Muslim state like Libya or Afghani-
stan or a devout Muslim in a Hindu so-
ciety like India. You might be a non-
religious person targeted by your en-
emies or state authorities. 
You might be a 22-year-old Nigerian 
gospel musician like Yahaya Sharif- 
Aminu, who was convicted of blas-
phemy in a state sharia court in Kano 
State on August 10 and has been sen-
tenced to death by hanging for some-
thing he said on a WhatsApp group on 
the internet. 
Mr. Speaker, you might be a Suda-
nese Christian like Mariam Ibrahim, 
who was jailed for apostasy because, al-
though she had been a devout Christian 
for her entire life, government officials 
demanded that she follow her absent 
father’s Muslim faith. She was held in 
jail with her 20-month-old son and 
forced to give birth to her daughter in 
prison while her legs were shackled to 
the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, you might be a 13-year- 
old Muslim boy in Nigeria like Omar 
Farouq, who was sentenced to 10 years 
at hard labor for blasphemy when he 
said something about Allah in an argu-
ment with friends, a brutal miscarriage 
of justice condemned by UNICEF and 
child advocates all over the world. 
You might even belong to the wrong 
sect of the official state religion. In the 
Islamic State of Pakistan, for example, 
people belonging to the Ahmadiyya 
Muslim faith are being persecuted as 
heretics and apostates as if this were 
the Middle Ages. 
At least five Ahmadiyya Muslims 
have been killed in Pakistan this year 
alone because of their faith, including 
Tahir Ahmad Naseem, an American 
citizen who was murdered in broad day-
light in a courtroom while standing 
trial for blasphemy charges just for 
practicing his own religion. While his 
teenage killer was arrested, he is being 
celebrated now as a martyr by the 
media and members of the police serv-
ice who watched him kill Naseem. 
Mr. Speaker, the global assault on re-
ligious and intellectual freedom today 
is taking place in many of the world’s 
largest countries: 
China confines millions of Uighur 
Muslims 
in 
miserable 
reeducation 
camps and forces them into slave labor 
in Xinjiang province; 
Russia has decreed that Jehovah’s 
Witnesses are an extremist group and 
confiscated their property, jailed their 
members, and even allegedly tortured 
some of them; 
India recently passed draconian laws 
burdening the rights of disfavored Mus-
lim minorities. 
With this resolution, Mr. Speaker, 
against the new wave of global reli-
gious 
oppression 
and 
persecution, 
America can once again take the lead 
in defending the basic human rights of 
religious and intellectual freedom all 
over the world. 
James Madison, the author of our 
First Amendment, denounced that ‘‘di-
abolical, hell-conceived principle of 
persecution,’’ and he stated in his re-
monstrance against religious assess-
ments that ‘‘the religion . . . of every 
man must be left to the conviction and 
conscience of every man.’’ 
Let us share this principle with the 
nations of the world with this resolu-
tion. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the right to practice 
one’s faith is the most fundamental 
freedom there is. There is a reason our 
Founding Fathers made it the First 
Amendment: Our Founders understood 
that someone’s right to worship was sa-
cred and should belong to all people re-
gardless of their faith. 
If religious freedom is taken away, 
all other freedoms are subject to being 
taken away also. It is just that simple. 
Unfortunately, 
religious 
freedom 
still does not exist everywhere. Today, 
religious minorities are persecuted all 
over the globe. 
According to the U.S. Commission on 
International 
Religious 
Freedom, 
about one-third of the countries around 
the world still have laws against blas-
phemy. In many dictatorships, people 
are not allowed to worship anything 
but the state. To do so would be seen as 
a threat to the government because 
they do not recognize a higher power. 
As a result, religious minorities are 
targeted in some countries with severe 
brutality. People are being beaten, ar-
rested, and tortured. Houses of worship 
are razed and destroyed. In countries 
like Iran, Pakistan, and others, ascrib-
ing to a different religion could mean 
the death penalty. In other places, it 
can mean forced labor or a public whip-
ping. 
This is simply unacceptable. Today, 
the House has an opportunity to stand 
up for religious freedom around the 
world. 
This is an important resolution. This 
resolution makes the repeal of blas-
phemy, heresy, and apostasy laws a 
priority 
everywhere. 
It 
designates 
countries that enforce such laws as 
countries of particular concern for reli-
gious freedom and calls on all govern-
ments to release religious prisoners of 
conscience. 
The United States has always been a 
leader when it comes to religious free-
dom. Today, we have a chance to lead 
again and to tell the world that we will 
not stand for religious intolerance. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support H. Res. 512, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
b 1230 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for his very thoughtful and eloquent 
statement in defense of religious free-
dom, the value that unites us behind 
this powerful resolution, which will put 
the government squarely back in the 
fight to defend religious liberty all 
over the world and to oppose the spread 
of these blasphemy laws that are being 
used to persecute innocent people all 
over the globe. 
Mr. Speaker, in our country, the reli-
gious Free Exercise Clause and the 
clause against establishment of reli-
gion stand best when they stand to-
gether because they both stand for the

principle that no particular religious 
sect can seize control of state power 
and then persecute members of other 
religious groups, but that is what is 
happening in so many places all over 
the world. 
Mr. Speaker, our experience in the 
separation of church and state and 
standing up for the free exercise of reli-
gion is something that we can continue 
to proudly promote to the rest of the 
world, and we do have something that 
we think we can teach other nations 
that want to follow the path of democ-
racy and freedom. 
As the U.S. works to advance human 
rights, it is critical that we put this 
question of freedom of thought, free-
dom of conscience right at the heart of 
our efforts. Everyone must be able to 
practice their faith—or no faith at all— 
without the threat of government vio-
lence and persecution. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
this excellent measure, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a co-
sponsor and a senior Member of the House of 
Representatives, I rise in strong support of this 
bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 512, ‘‘Calling for 
the global repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and 
apostasy laws’’. 
First and foremost, I would like to recognize 
and thank Congressman JAMIE RASKIN for his 
leadership on this vital resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution calls upon the 
President and the Department of State to 
prioritize the repeal of blasphemy, heresy, and 
apostasy laws in bilateral relationships be-
tween the United States and countries that 
have such laws. 
It also designates countries that enforce 
such laws as ‘‘countries of particular concern’’ 
with respect to religious freedom. 
Furthermore, H. Res. 512 opposes efforts 
by the United Nations to implement an inter-
national anti-blasphemy norm. 
Lastly, the resolution calls on the govern-
ments of countries that enforce such laws to 
either amend or repeal them as well as to re-
lease anyone imprisoned pursuant to them. 
Blasphemy laws, as is noted in the resolu-
tion, lead to religious intolerance, discrimina-
tion and violence. 
Moreover, these laws are often weaponized 
to target marginalized religious communities. 
Charges can be based on false accusations 
and are commonly brought forth for sectarian 
or political purposes. 
In 2019, the United States Commission on 
International Religious Freedom released its 
20th Annual Report, recommending that the 
U.S. Department of State designate sixteen 
nations as ‘‘countries of particular concern’’ 
due to their severe suppression of religious 
freedom. 
For example: In Burma, a predominantly 
Buddhist nation, the Rohingya Muslim people 
have been subject to what the U.N. high com-
missioner for human rights has called ‘‘a text-
book example of ethnic cleansing’’; 
In China, over 1 million ethnic Uyghur and 
Kazakh Muslims have been arbitrarily detained 
in concentration camps styled as ‘‘political 
education’’ camps, where they are subject to 
torture and inhumane conditions; 
In Iran, the Baha’i community is treated by 
the government as a band of heretics, and, as 
of February 2017, at least 90 Baha’i were held 
in prison solely for their religious beliefs; 
In Russia, Jehovah’s Witnesses have been 
banned as an extremist group, and their prop-
erties have been seized and liquidated by 
order of the government. Dozens of individuals 
have been arrested on extremism charges and 
remain in custody or under house arrest; and 
The right to worship freely is one of the 
founding and most essential principles of the 
United States. 
As the world’s oldest democracy, America 
has a responsibility to protect the freedoms of 
speech, expression, and religion against offi-
cial persecution around the world. 
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have 
been a fierce defender of human rights, and 
this resolution is a small but important step in 
safeguarding the individual freedoms of choos-
ing one’s religion, or no religion at all, as well 
as worshipping and thinking freely no matter 
where you live. 
With this in mind, I am proud to be a leader 
on this resolution, and I urge all Members on 
both sides of the aisle to join me in voting for 
H. Res. 512, ‘‘Calling for the global repeal of 
blasphemy, heresy, and apostasy laws.’’

RASKIN) that the House suspend the

The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, on that I

CONDEMNING IRAN’S STATE-SPON-
SORED 
PERSECUTION 
OF 
ITS 
BAHA’I MINORITY 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 823) condemning the 
Government of Iran’s state-sponsored 
persecution of its Baha’i minority and 
its continued violation of the Inter-
national Covenants on Human Rights, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 823 
Whereas, in 1982, 1984, 1988, 1990, 1992, 1993, 
1994, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009, 2012, 2013, 
2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018, Congress declared 
that it deplored the religious persecution by 
the Government of Iran of the Baha’i com-
munity and would hold the Government of 
Iran responsible for upholding the rights of 
all Iranian nationals, including members of 
the Baha’i faith; 
Whereas, since 1979, Iranian authorities 
have killed or executed more than 200 Baha’i 
leaders, and more than 10,000 have been dis-
missed from government and university jobs; 
Whereas the Report of the United Nations 
Special Rapporteur on the situation of 
human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran 
(A/74/188) dated July 18, 2019, provides, in 
part— 
(1) the Iranian authorities and the Iranian 
criminal justice system regard the Baha’is as 
‘‘unprotected infidels’’; the Baha’i faith is 
also ‘‘regarded as a misguided sect’’; and 
‘‘Baha’i worship and religious practices are 
deemed heresy.’’; 
(2) ‘‘Baha’is have been murdered with im-
punity and violations of their human rights 
have not been investigated.’’; 
(3) members of the Baha’i faith ‘‘frequently 
face charges, such as, ‘‘breaching national 
security’, ‘‘propaganda against the holy re-
gime of the Islamic Republic of Iran’, or 
‘propaganda activities against the regime in 
the interests of the Baha’i sect’ ’’; 
(4) ‘‘Since August 2005, more than 1,168 Ba-
ha’is have been arrested and charged with 
vaguely worded offences.’’; 
(5) ‘‘There were a total of 95 Baha’is report-
edly arrested in 2018, compared with at least 
84 in 2017 and 81 in 2016.’’; 
(6) ‘‘On 1 January 2019, the court of appeal 
of Isfahan reportedly condemned, in separate 
judgments, nine Baha’i citizens to a total of 
48 years of prison. They had been charged 
with ‘membership of the illegal Baha’i com-
munity and propaganda against the regime 
by spreading the Baha’i faith in the soci-
ety.’ ’’; 
(7) directed by a 2007 letter from the Secu-
rity Unit of the Public Place Supervision Of-
fice of the Islamic Republic of Iran to police 
commanders throughout the country, Ira-
nian authorities continue to apply economic 
pressure against the Baha’i community, by 
banning them from specific professions and 
‘‘halting their entry to ‘high earning busi-
nesses’ ’’; and 
(8) ‘‘Since 2013, there have been more than 
803 incidents of violations of economic rights 
of the Baha’is, including arbitrary shop clo-
sures, unfair dismissals from employment 
and the actual or threatened revocation of 
business licenses.’’; 
Whereas the Department of State’s Inter-
national Religious Freedom Report for 2019, 
Iran section, provides, in part— 
(1) ‘‘Non-Shia Muslims and those affiliated 
with a religion other than Islam, especially 
members of the Baha’i community, contin-
ued to face societal discrimination and har-
assment, and employers experienced social 
pressures not to hire Baha’is or to dismiss 
them from their private sector jobs.’’; and 
(2) ‘‘The law bars Baha’is from founding 
their own educational institutions. A Min-
istry of Science, Research, and Technology 
order requires universities to exclude Baha’is 
from access to higher education or expel 
them if their religious affiliation becomes 
known.’’; 
Whereas, on March 11, 2020, the Depart-
ment of State released the Country Reports 
on Human Rights Practices for 2019 and, in 
connection with Iran, the report provides, in 
part— 
(1) Iranian authorities ‘‘barred Baha’i stu-
dents from higher education’’, and in 2019, 
denied enrollment to at least 22 Baha’i col-
lege applicants solely because of their reli-
gious affiliation despite passing the national 
admissions test; 
(2) ‘‘The country materially contributed to 
human rights abuses . . . in Yemen, through 
its support for Houthi rebels and directing 
authorities in Houthi-controlled areas of 
Yemen to harass and detain Baha’is because 
of their religious affiliation.’’; and 
(3) ‘‘In July 2019, Iran Wire, a human rights 
reporting agency, reported the case of 
Hamed Rezvani, a Baha’i musician and 
teacher, who left his home in Isfahan in De-
cember 2018 and has not been heard from 
since. Repeated requests by the Rezvani fam-
ily for information from police and local in-
telligence have not produced any informa-
tion about his disappearance.’’;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6868 
December 7, 2020 
Whereas according to the 2020 Annual Re-
port of the United States Commission on 
International Religious Freedom (USCIRF)— 
(1) ‘‘There are more than 300,000 Baha’is in 
Iran, who together constitute the largest 
non-Muslim religious minority in the coun-
try.’’; 
(2) ‘‘Security forces also prevented the bur-
ial of two deceased Baha’i individuals in a 
Baha’i cemetery in Kerman after it was 
sealed in March 2018. In October, the body of 
a deceased Baha’i woman was exhumed four 
days after her burial and abandoned in a 
desert area outside the town of Jaban.’’; 
(3) There is a ‘‘particular uptick in the per-
secution of Baha’is’’, including of local gov-
ernment officials who advocated on behalf of 
Baha’is, and the Iranian government blamed 
Baha’is, without evidence, for wide-spread 
popular protests in 2019; and 
(4) ‘‘In July 2019, Twitter banned several 
official Iranian media accounts for incite-
ment against Baha’is in Iran.’’; 
Whereas the Baha’i International Commu-
nity documented a more than 50 percent in-
crease in hate propaganda directed against 
the Baha’is in the twelve-month period end-
ing August 2020 compared to prior years with 
more than 9,500 such articles, videos, or web 
pages appearing in Iranian government-con-
trolled or government-sponsored media; 
Whereas Iran is a member of the United 
Nations and a signatory to both the Uni-
versal Declaration of Human Rights and the 
International Covenant on Civil and Polit-
ical 
Rights, 
among 
other 
international 
human rights treaties, without reservation; 
Whereas section 105 of the Comprehensive 
Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divest-
ment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8514) authorizes 
the President to impose sanctions on individ-
uals ‘‘responsible for or complicit in, or re-
sponsible for ordering, controlling, or other-
wise directing, the commission of serious 
human rights abuses against citizens of Iran 
or their family members on or after June 12, 
2009’’; and 
Whereas the Iran Threat Reduction and 
Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 (Public Law 
112–158) amends and expands the authorities 
established under the Comprehensive Iran 
Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment 
Act of 2010 to sanction Iranian human rights 
abusers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the Government of Iran’s 
state-sponsored persecution of its Baha’i mi-
nority and its continued violation of the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Po-
litical Rights; 
(2) calls on the Government of Iran— 
(A) to immediately release all imprisoned 
or detained Baha’is, together with all other 
prisoners held solely on account of their reli-
gion; 
(B) to end its state-sponsored campaign of 
hate propaganda against the Baha’is; and 
(C) to reverse state-imposed policies deny-
ing Baha’is and members of other religious 
minorities equal opportunities to higher edu-
cation, earning a livelihood, due process 
under the law, and the free exercise of reli-
gious practices; 
(3) calls on the President and the Secretary 
of State, in cooperation with responsible na-
tions, to continue to condemn the Govern-
ment of Iran’s continued violation of human 
rights and demand the immediate release of 
prisoners held solely on account of their reli-
gion; and 
(4) urges the President and the Secretary 
of State to utilize available authorities to 
impose sanctions on officials of the Govern-
ment of Iran and other individuals directly 
responsible for serious human rights abuses, 
including abuses against the Baha’i commu-
nity of Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. RASKIN) and the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Maryland. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
823. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Maryland? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this resolution condemning the gov-
ernment of Iran’s persecution of its be-
sieged Baha’i minority. I thank all of 
my colleagues who have worked on 
this, including on the Committee on 
Foreign Affairs, Mr. DEUTCH and Mr. 
WILSON, for their leadership on this 
measure. 
Mr. Speaker, the Government of Iran 
has carried out an inhumane campaign 
of religious persecution against the 
Baha’i minority, its largest nonMuslim 
religious minority in the country. The 
regime has closed Baha’i-owned shops 
and stores, forbidden Baha’i citizens 
from holding government jobs, and de-
nied Baha’i children access to school. 
Members of the Baha’i community 
have been unjustly arrested and pros-
ecuted and executed, targeted solely 
for their religious beliefs. 
Mr. Speaker, the U.S. stands for the 
freedom of religious exercise, and we 
must speak up in the face of this theo-
cratic injustice. We cannot forget those 
who struggled for their basic religious 
freedom and civil liberty in Iran. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution sends a 
strong message to the Iranian Govern-
ment that the Government of the 
United States will not remain silent in 
the face of such terrible oppression. It 
calls for the immediate release of all 
imprisoned or detained Baha’is, and 
urges sanctions on Iranian officials and 
others who are responsible for these 
human rights abuses, including abuses 
against the Baha’i community. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this bipartisan 
resolution, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, this body is no stranger 
to the human rights abuses committed 
by the Iranian regime. The Islamic Re-
public of Iran is the world’s largest 
state sponsor of terror and has regu-
larly attacked and detained those who 
disagree with them, including even 
their own people and American citi-
zens. 
Today, we focus on the regime’s reli-
gious persecution of the Baha’i, Iran’s 
largest religious minority group. The 
Baha’i in Iran are regularly subject to 
arbitrary interrogations and arrests 
without due process. They are often de-
nied employment and access to higher 
education. Their cemeteries have been 
vandalized, and many of their leaders 
have been executed. Moreover, Iranian 
state media publishes anti-Baha’i hate 
propaganda, exposing them to preju-
dices and even potentially violent at-
tacks by their neighbors. 
Mr. Speaker, the Trump administra-
tion has admirably used sanctions to 
punish Iran’s human rights abusers, 
but we cannot let up until all people in 
Iran, including the Baha’i, have the 
right to practice their faith freely. 
With this resolution, we vow to con-
tinue to hold human rights abusers ac-
countable, including those who target 
the Baha’i. 
The Iranian regime must end their 
persecution of the Baha’i by releasing 
those who have been illegally impris-
oned, by ending their hate-filled propa-
ganda campaign against the Baha’i, 
and by reversing policies that the Ba-
ha’is equal opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased 
to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman 
from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
him for his leadership on this very im-
portant topic. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H. Res. 823, which condemns the Ira-
nian Government’s persecution of the 
Baha’i minority. As an original cospon-
sor of this measure myself, I thank Mr. 
DEUTCH and Mr. WILSON for their work 
to bring it to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, as a former chairman of 
the Subcommittee on the Middle East, 
North Africa and International Ter-
rorism myself, I have long observed 
how the Iranian Government has re-
pressed its own people, stifled their 
voices and their freedoms, and system-
atically abused human rights. Nowhere 
is this more evident than in the 
mullahs’ persecution of members of the 
Baha’i faith. 
Mr. Speaker, since the Iranian Revo-
lution, Iran has executed hundreds of 
Baha’is, while 10,000 Baha’is have been 
dismissed from their jobs, and a num-
ber of their holy sites have been dese-
crated. Baha’is also have seen their 
homes and businesses raided, their 
children prohibited from attending col-
lege, and their property confiscated. 
This cruel persecution comes despite 
the fact that Iran has nothing to fear 
from the Baha’i. The Baha’i faith es-
pouses the values of peace and unity, 
cooperation, education, interfaith har-
mony, and an end to prejudice. Wher-
ever Baha’is live, they strive to be good 
citizens, devoted to service and uni-
versal respect for all people. 
Mr. Speaker, this includes here in the 
United States. Since arriving over 120 
years ago, members of the Baha’i faith

have established themselves as patri-
otic and productive citizens in all 50 
States. I want to specifically honor the 
Baha’i community in my community 
in Cincinnati. One of their churches is 
about a mile down the street from my 
home, and I have had the opportunity 
to meet their representatives several 
times and come to learn how they have 
enriched our city of Cincinnati back 
home. 
With these values and contributions 
in mind, the Iranian persecution of the 
Baha’i is clearly barbaric and shows 
the true nature of that wicked regime 
in Iran. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me and join others on both sides of 
the aisle in condemning the persecu-
tion by supporting this resolution. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, one of the 
principles this country was founded 
upon was the freedom to worship. This 
is a right that people all around the 
world should have, including the people 
of Iran. Resolutions like this remind 
the world that the United States of 
America will not turn a blind eye to re-
ligious persecution. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
from Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) and the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. WIL-
SON) for their leadership in introducing 
this bipartisan resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support H. Res. 823, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Mr. Speaker, I, too, thank Mr. 
DEUTCH and Mr. WILSON for their hard 
work on this important resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, American foreign policy 
must work to advance and protect 
basic human rights around the world, 
including religious freedom and the 
rights of religious minorities. When we 
see human rights violations, like the 
ones the Iranian Government has in-
flicted on the Baha’i community, we 
must speak out. We must pursue jus-
tice for the victims and we must hold 
the perpetrators accountable. We must 
defend people nonviolently exercising 
their faith against governments vio-
lently imposing their will on the pub-
lic. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution is a step 
in the direction of aggressive defense of 
human rights, and I am pleased to sup-
port it. I urge all of our colleagues to 
support this bipartisan measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
RASKIN) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 823, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘A resolution 
condemning the Government of Iran’s 
state-sponsored 
persecution 
of 
its 
Baha’i minority and its continued vio-
lation of the Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights and the International

RECOGNIZING 
IMPORTANCE 
OF 
SUSTAINED 
UNITED 
STATES 
LEADERSHIP TO ACCELERATING 
GLOBAL 
PROGRESS 
AGAINST 
MATERNAL 
AND 
CHILD 
MAL-
NUTRITION 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and agree to the reso-
lution (H. Res. 189) recognizing the im-
portance of sustained United States 
leadership 
to 
accelerating 
global 
progress against maternal and child 
malnutrition and supporting United 
States Agency for International Devel-
opment’s commitment to global nutri-
tion through its multi-sectoral nutri-
tion strategy, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 189 
Whereas 151 million children under the age 
of 5 in the world—22 percent—are stunted, or 
chronically undernourished, and in countries 
highly affected by undernutrition, stunting 
affects 1 in every 3 children; 
Whereas wasting, or acute malnutrition, 
continues to threaten the lives of an esti-
mated 7.5 percent or nearly 51 million chil-
dren under the age of 5 globally, and more 
than 38 million children under the age of 5 
are overweight; 
Whereas malnutrition directly or indi-
rectly causes 45 percent of all deaths—2.6 
million—of children under age 5 annually 
and puts those who survive at risk of im-
paired brain development, lower IQ, weak-
ened immune systems, and greater risk of se-
rious diseases; 
Whereas undernourished adolescent girls 
have impaired cognitive ability and produc-
tivity and their future babies are at in-
creased risk for low birth weight and death; 
Whereas iron deficiency anemia, associated 
with undernutrition, contributes to 1 in 5 
maternal deaths (or 20 percent of maternal 
mortality); 
Whereas poor maternal nutrition contrib-
utes to poor fetal development and low birth 
weight, and an estimated 60 to 80 percent of 
neonatal deaths occur in low birth weight 
babies; 
Whereas a large body of scientific evidence 
supports 
the 
benefits 
of 
improved 
breastfeeding practices on the short-term 
and long-term health and development of 
children and their mothers; 
Whereas a growing evidence base dem-
onstrates that reducing maternal and child 
malnutrition, especially in the critical 1,000 
days between pregnancy and age 2, is impera-
tive to ending preventable maternal and 
child deaths, improving cognitive and phys-
ical development, and strengthening chil-
dren’s immune systems to bolster resistance 
to disease; 
Whereas leading economists and Nobel 
Laureates have identified improving child 
nutrition as the most cost-effective way to 
enhance global health and development; 
Whereas the United States Agency for 
International Development’s Multi-Sectoral 
Nutrition 
Strategy’s 
approach 
addresses 
both direct and underlying causes of mal-
nutrition, and its focus on linking humani-
tarian assistance with development pro-
gramming helps build resilience to shocks in 
vulnerable communities; 
Whereas malnutrition is a universal issue 
that no country in the world can afford to 
overlook, and countries with high burdens of 
malnutrition, including stunting, wasting, 
anemia, and micronutrient deficiency, will 
struggle to achieve sustainable and equitable 
economic growth; 
Whereas the United States plays a lead 
role supporting the goals of Scaling Up Nu-
trition, a global movement of 60 countries to 
prioritize nutrition, particularly during the 
1,000-day window of opportunity between a 
mother’s pregnancy and her child’s second 
birthday, through effective policy and dedi-
cated national resources; and 
Whereas the world has reduced undernutri-
tion since 1990, yet global progress has been 
too slow to ensure each child can attain a 
full and prosperous future regardless of 
where he or she was born and at the current 
pace, the global community will not reach 
its global nutrition targets set for 2025: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) reaffirms that— 
(A) food security and good nutrition in 
early childhood saves lives and lays the foun-
dation for healthy physical and cognitive 
growth and development; 
(B) the potential benefit of good nutrition 
is life-long and influences a child’s entire fu-
ture, with entire communities and nations 
ultimately prospering; 
(C) the right nutrition helps children learn, 
helps protect them from illness, increases 
their productivity and earning potential, and 
supports the well-being and health of their 
future offspring; and 
(D) women who are well-nourished and do 
not suffer from anemia are less likely to die 
in childbirth and to give birth to children 
who are malnourished, breaking the inter-
generational cycle of malnutrition; 
(2) reaffirms that— 
(A) good nutrition is also an economic 
issue central to reducing poverty and put-
ting countries on path to economic develop-
ment; 
(B) adults who were well-nourished as chil-
dren earn up to 46 percent more than those 
who were malnourished; 
(C) countries with a very high burden of 
early childhood malnutrition have lower eco-
nomic growth rates due to lost income and 
productivity; and 
(D) the cost to nations is substantial with 
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) losses esti-
mated between 3 to 16 percent with overall 
potential impacts to the global economy as 
high as $3.5 trillion per year; 
(3) supports United States leadership in 
helping developing countries meet the nutri-
tional needs of women and children, and sup-
ports continued efforts; 
(4) supports United States Agency for 
International Development’s (USAID) rec-
ognition that nutrition interventions are 
among the lifesaving interventions that can 
have the greatest impact in ending prevent-
able child and maternal deaths; 
(5) supports the use of the USAID Multi- 
Sectoral Nutrition Strategy, the United 
States Government Global Nutrition Coordi-
nation Plan, and the Global Food Security 
Strategy as platforms through which to help 
reach global nutrition targets by 2025, as 
agreed to at the World Health Assembly in 
2012; 
(6) acknowledges the vision and goals of 
the Scaling Up Nutrition movement as a

(7) acknowledges that progress against 
global malnutrition must be accelerated 
using innovative, scaled-up approaches to

(8) calls for transformative efforts across 
sectors at USAID—

and child malnutrition, including through 
Country Development Cooperation Strate-
gies that align with country’s national nu-
trition plans; and 
(B) to include improved and clear methods 
to track nutrition funding and outcomes 
across all United States Government global 
nutrition programs, especially those in glob-

education, food assistance, and water, sani-
tation, and hygiene (WASH). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on H. Res. 189. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, malnutrition is a dev-
astating crisis across the world with 
far-reaching effects. People cannot lead 
full, healthy, productive lives without 
access to food and proper nutrition, es-
pecially in the early stages of life. The 
impacts of malnutrition extend from 
health challenges like child stunting 
and infant mortality to reduced eco-
nomic productivity that can keep com-
munities and countries from achieving 
greater prosperity. 
b 1245 
That is why we cannot afford to have 
our international development pro-
grams look at malnutrition as an iso-
lated problem. To tackle this crisis, 
particularly as we continue to grapple 
with the coronavirus pandemic, we also 
have to address related economic, edu-
cational, health, and social issues. 
This good resolution, authored by 
Representative MARSHALL, outlines the 
importance 
of 
continued 
American 
leadership in the fight against global 
malnutrition and underscores the sig-
nificance of USAID’s work on this 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
it, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, all of us in this Cham-
ber probably grew up with a mother 
telling us to eat our vegetables. As a 
father myself, I have very strong 
memories of chasing several of my 
children around the house, trying to 
get healthy food into their mouths. 
That is because, as we know, a child’s 
growth and development is severely 
impacted when they don’t have proper 
nutrition. 
Unfortunately, today, over 151 mil-
lion children under the age of 5—ba-
bies, really—suffer from chronic mal-
nutrition. That is truly a shocking and 
disturbing number. Over the last three 
decades, there has been important 
progress to reduce chronic malnutri-
tion around the world, but, clearly, 
much more must be done. 
That is why I am proud to be here 
today to offer my support for this reso-
lution, introduced by the gentleman 
from Kansas (Mr. MARSHALL), which 
calls for increased efforts to end mater-
nal and child malnutrition. 
The United States has always been a 
leader when it comes to addressing ma-
ternal and child malnutrition. We must 
continue our leadership role in this im-
portant endeavor. 
The USAID multi-sectoral nutrition 
strategy is an important effort to en-
sure that nutrition interventions are 
effective in reaching the most vulner-
able populations. 
I want to thank the chairman, and I 
want to thank my colleagues, Rep-
resentatives MARSHALL and MCGOVERN, 
for leading this important resolution 
and bringing this to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, malnutrition around 
the world devastates the lives of mil-
lions of people and prevents commu-
nities from prospering. This problem 
has been compounded by the COVID–19 
pandemic, putting years of work on nu-
trition at risk. 
It is critical that the United States 
work to make even greater progress on 
this major humanitarian and develop-
mental challenge. This resolution reaf-
firms the importance of American lead-
ership in that mission. 
Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support 
it, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. MARSHALL), the sponsor of this 
resolution. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, as a 
physician and obstetrician, I represent 
one of the largest agriculture-pro-
ducing districts in the country. I am 
proud to help lead H. Res. 189, a critical 
resolution addressing the health and 
development of children around the 
world and a role the United States 
must continue to play to improve ma-
ternal and child nutrition. 
Every year, malnutrition accounts 
for half of all deaths among children 
under the age of 5. Nearly a quarter of 
the world’s children are stunted, both 
physically and mentally, due to mal-
nutrition. This leads to long-term poor 
health and impaired brain develop-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, food is medicine. The 
1,000 days stretching from conception, 
from the start of a mother’s pregnancy, 
until the child turns 2, is critical to in-
creasing child survival, strengthening 
the immune system to bolster disease 
resistance, and improving the child’s 
ability to grow, learn, and live to their 
fullest potential. 
Investments that focus on the first 
year of a child’s life are among the best 
and most cost-effective investments 
that can be made to help achieve last-
ing progress in global health, economic 
prosperity, and development. 
The USDA and the USAID oversee 
America’s longstanding commitment 
to reducing hunger and improving glob-
al food security. Our international 
feeding programs originated in my 
home State of Kansas, in Cheyenne 
County, when a group of farmers pre-
sented the idea of distributing food, 
rather than just funding, to countries 
to help their populations thrive. 
Programs like the USAID’s Food for 
Peace 
and 
USDA’s 
McGovern-Dole 
Food for Education provide basic hu-
manitarian aid to families, women, and 
children worldwide and help our farm-
ers and ranchers reach more markets 
for the high-quality commodities they 
produce. The U.S. exports about $140 
billion worth of agricultural products 
each year, thanks to the hard work of 
farmers and their partnership with 
USDA and USAID. 
Not only are U.S. investments in nu-
trition efficient and effective, but U.S. 
nutrition programs also leverage other 
investments in foreign assistance, in-
creasing the impact on improving 
health globally, which can lead to 
countries lessening their dependence 
on foreign aid and thriving economi-
cally. 
However, 
the 
COVID–19 
outbreak 
threatens achievements made by many 
USDA and USAID programs due to re-
strictions to supply chains that are 
stressing food markets and placing peo-
ple suffering from hunger on the brink 
of starvation. 
The cost of malnutrition to the glob-
al economy is estimated to be $3.5 tril-
lion in healthcare costs and lost pro-
ductivity every year, and COVID–19 is 
only making it more challenging to ad-
dress. 
Fortunately, help is on the way. This 
week, we hope the FDA will approve 
and review the emergency use author-
ization for vaccine candidates. Mean-
while, we have all got work to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the 
committee and the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), my 
good friend, and our 154 cosponsors for 
bringing our resolution to the House 
floor. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. MCGOVERN), the author 
of this important resolution and the 
co-chairman of the Tom Lantos Human 
Rights Commission.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6871 
December 7, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, let me 
take this opportunity to thank Mr. 
ENGEL for his incredible service, not 
only to this Nation, but to the world. 
Mr. ENGEL has been a champion for 
human rights, for diplomacy, and for 
all things good. This institution is a 
better place because he has served 
here. 
There 
are 
countless 
people 
around the world who are safe because 
of his advocacy on their behalf when 
they have been unjustly imprisoned or 
targeted unjustly. I want him to know 
how much I admire him and how much 
I appreciate his service. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H. Res. 189, introduced by my good 
friend 
and 
colleague, 
Congressman 
ROGER MARSHALL, and me, in support 
of U.S. leadership and USAID’s com-
mitment to advancing global maternal 
and child nutrition. 
I am very proud that this bill has 154 
cosponsors, which is a strong state-
ment of support for continuing U.S. 
leadership. 
I would also like to take this oppor-
tunity to congratulate Congressman 
MARSHALL on moving on to the Senate 
next year. I hope we will continue our 
bipartisan partnership to ending hun-
ger here at home and around the world. 
He has been a valuable member of the 
House Hunger Caucus. In case he 
doesn’t already know it, there is a 
similar caucus over in the Senate. 
Mr. Speaker, the world has made im-
pressive progress on improving nutri-
tion in the past decade, thanks in part 
to strong U.S. leadership and a bipar-
tisan commitment here in Congress to 
address these issues. The COVID–19 
pandemic threatens to reverse all of 
the world’s hard-won nutrition gains 
and leave an entire generation in dan-
ger of being seriously mentally, emo-
tionally, and physically impaired. 
In a world where we produce enough 
food to feed everyone, 821 million peo-
ple, 1 in 9, still go to bed on an empty 
stomach each night. Even more, one in 
three, suffer from some form of mal-
nutrition. Based on current trends, this 
number is set to rise to one in every 
two by 2025. 
Eradicating hunger and malnutrition 
is surely one of the great challenges of 
our time. Because of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the world risks backsliding even 
more on nutrition. 
In July, The Lancet published an ar-
ticle with estimates showing that 
wasting among malnourished children 
could rise by 14.3 percent if we do not 
act now. This would translate to an es-
timated additional 6.7 million wasted 
children during the first 12 months of 
the pandemic and more than 10,000 ad-
ditional child deaths per month during 
this same period. 
According to the World Health Orga-
nization, 52 percent of the world’s na-
tions have reported disruptions in 
health and nutrition services for sick 
and malnourished children. 
But there is always hope, Mr. Speak-
er, to change the course of these 
trends. 
We are in the middle of the COVID–19 
pandemic and the U.N. Decade of Ac-
tion on Nutrition, 2016 to 2025. This 
gives us a historic opportunity to 
adapt, reimagine, and invest more in 
the fight against child and maternal 
malnutrition. 
H. Res. 189 recognizes the importance 
of these challenges and the need for 
continued U.S. leadership. The resolu-
tion urges USAID to fully implement 
the multi-sectoral nutrition strategy 
to improve global nutrition. 
I am sure that I speak for all of my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
that we all support strengthening U.S. 
efforts to protect women and children 
from malnutrition and related deaths. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H. Res. 189 on global 
nutrition. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take a mo-
ment 
to 
thank 
organizations 
like 
Bread for the World, the Eleanor Crook 
Foundation, Catholic Relief Services, 
and many others around the world. 
These are the people who implement 
and advocate for these critical nutri-
tion interventions. 
As the world grapples with the im-
pact of COVID–19, it is more important 
than ever that we ramp up our fight to 
end chronic malnutrition. 
I have been proud to support this 
critical work, including advocating for 
nutrition programs in annual appro-
priations bills. I look forward to con-
tinuing to support these efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 189 
is a very important resolution. I sup-
port it and encourage my colleagues to 
do so as well. I think that both sides of 
the aisle understand how important 
this is, and it is good to see us working 
together. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior Member of the House of Representatives 
and the founding chair of the Congressional 
Children’s Caucus, I rise in strong support of 
this bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 189, ‘‘Rec-
ognizing the importance of sustained United 
States 
leadership 
to 
accelerating 
global 
progress against maternal and child malnutri-
tion and supporting United States Agency for 
International Development’s commitment to 
global nutrition through its multisectoral nutri-
tion strategy.’’ 
First and foremost, I would like to recognize 
and thank Congressmen ROGER MARSHALL 
and JIM MCGOVERN for their leadership on this 
vital resolution. 
By passing H. Res. 189 today, we are com-
mitting ourselves to improving the health of 
women and children in impoverished areas, 
helping prevent illness, and improving eco-
nomic conditions in poorer countries. 
With that in mind, I wish to commend the 
U.S. Agency for International Development’s 
(USAID) maternal and child nutrition programs 
that seek to improve health outcomes by im-
plementing nutrition-specific interventions, or 
those that address the immediate, health-re-
lated determinants of undernutrition. 
These critical investments are closely co-
ordinated 
with 
USAID’s 
nutrition-sensitive 
interventions that address underlying or sys-
temic causes of inadequate nutrition, such as 
education, water, sanitation, and hygiene, agri-
culture, as well as the healthy timing and 
spacing of pregnancy. 
It is no secret that poverty amplifies the risk 
of, and risks from, malnutrition. 
People who are poor are more likely to be 
affected by different forms of malnutrition. 
Furthermore, malnutrition increases health 
care costs, reduces productivity, and slows 
economic growth, which can perpetuate a 
cycle of poverty and ill-health. 
Malnutrition can have several negative and 
deadly effects such as decreased cognitive 
development in newborns, greater vulnerability 
to disease and other issues. 
Women, infants, children, and adolescents 
are at particular risk of malnutrition. 
Optimizing nutrition early in life, especially 
from the 1,000 days from conception to a 
child’s second birthday ensures the best pos-
sible start in life, with long-term benefits. 
For example, adults who were not malnour-
ished as children earn nearly 46 percent more 
than their counterparts, as stated in the reso-
lution. 
According to UNICEF, nearly half of all 
deaths in children under 5 are attributable to 
undernutrition. 
Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I stood 
here today without addressing the global im-
pact of COVID–19 on malnutrition. 
Today, 
the 
significant 
and 
life-altering 
shocks created by the pandemic and the nec-
essary containment measures have meant 
that more vulnerable children are facing 
malnourishment, as efforts to mitigate the 
transmission of COVID–19 have resulted in 
the disruption of food systems, thereby upend-
ing health and nutrition services, devastating 
livelihoods, as well as threatening food secu-
rity. 
As of July 2020, an estimated 370 million 
children were missing school meals, which 
have been directly tied to improving students’ 
health and nutrition while also helping them 
develop good eating habits. 
Recent estimates from UNICEF indicate that 
in addition to the 690 million undernourished 
people in 2019, at least another 83 million 
people, and possibly as many as 132 million, 
may go hungry in 2020. 
Mr. Speaker, this resolution is needed now 
more than ever, and I am proud to be here 
and voice my support for it. 
I urge all Members on both sides of the 
aisle to join me in voting for H. Res. 189, 
‘‘Recognizing the importance of sustained 
United States leadership to accelerating global 
progress against maternal and child malnutri-
tion and supporting United States Agency for 
International Development’s commitment to 
global nutrition through its multi-sectoral nutri-
tion strategy.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and agree to the resolution, H. 
Res. 189, as amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the resolu-
tion, as amended, was agreed to. 
The title of the resolution was 
amended so as to read: ‘‘A resolution

A motion to reconsider was laid on

f 
HONG KONG PEOPLE’S FREEDOM 
AND CHOICE ACT OF 2020 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 8428) to provide for temporary 
protected status for residents of Hong 
Kong, 
and 
for 
other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 8428 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Hong Kong 
People’s Freedom and Choice Act of 2020’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
For purposes of this Act: 
(1) JOINT DECLARATION.—The term ‘‘Joint 
Declaration’’ means the Joint Declaration of 
the Government of the United Kingdom of 
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China on the Question of Hong Kong, signed 
on December 19, 1984, and entered into force 
on May 27, 1985. 
(2) PRIORITY
HONG
KONG
RESIDENT.—The 
term 
‘‘Priority 
Hong 
Kong 
resident’’ 
means— 
(A) a permanent resident of Hong Kong 
who— 
(i) holds no right to citizenship in any 
country or jurisdiction other than the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China (referred to in this 
Act as ‘‘PRC’’), Hong Kong, or Macau as of 
the date of enactment of this Act; 
(ii) has resided in Hong Kong for not less 
than the last 10 years as of the date of enact-
ment of this Act; and 
(iii) has been designated by the Secretary 
of State or Secretary of Homeland Security 
as having met the requirements of this sub-
paragraph, in accordance with the proce-
dures described in section 7 of this Act; or 
(B) the spouse of a person described in sub-
paragraph (A), or the child of such person as 
such term is defined in section 101(b)(1) of 
the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1101(b)(1)), except that a child shall be 
an unmarried person under twenty-seven 
years of age. 
(3) HONG KONG NATIONAL SECURITY LAW.— 
The term ‘‘Hong Kong National Security 
Law’’ means the Law of the People’s Repub-
lic of China on Safeguarding National Secu-
rity in the Hong Kong Special Administra-
tive Region that was passed unanimously by 
the National People’s Congress and signed by 
President Xi Jinping on June 30, 2020, and 
promulgated in the Hong Kong Special Ad-
ministrative Region (referred to in this Act 
as ‘‘Hong Kong SAR’’) on July 1, 2020. 
(4) APPROPRIATE
CONGRESSIONAL
COMMIT-
TEES.—The term ‘‘appropriate congressional 
committees’’ means— 
(A) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and 
the Committee on the Judiciary of the House 
of Representatives; and 
(B) the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and the Committee on the Judiciary of the 
Senate. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The Hong Kong National Security Law 
promulgated on July 1, 2020— 
(A) contravenes the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region (re-
ferred to in this Act as ‘‘the Basic Law’’) 
that provides in Article 23 that the Legisla-
tive Council of Hong Kong shall enact legis-
lation related to national security; 
(B) violates the PRC’s commitments under 
international law, as defined by the Joint 
Declaration; and 
(C) causes severe and irreparable damage 
to the ‘‘one country, two systems’’ principle 
and further erodes global confidence in the 
PRC’s commitment to international law. 
(2) On July 14, 2020, in response to the pro-
mulgation of the Hong Kong National Secu-
rity Law, President Trump signed an Execu-
tive order on Hong Kong normalization that, 
among other policy actions, suspended the 
special treatment of Hong Kong persons 
under U.S. law with respect to the issuance 
of immigrant and nonimmigrant visas. 
(3) The United States has a long and proud 
history as a destination for refugees and 
asylees fleeing persecution based on race, re-
ligion, nationality, political opinion, or 
membership in a particular social group. 
(4) The United States also shares deep so-
cial, cultural, and economic ties with the 
people of Hong Kong, including a shared 
commitment to democracy, to the rule of 
law, and to the protection of human rights. 
(5) The United States has sheltered, pro-
tected, and welcomed individuals who have 
fled authoritarian regimes, including citi-
zens from the PRC following the violent 
June 4, 1989, crackdown in Tiananmen 
Square, deepening ties between the people of 
the United States and those individuals 
seeking to contribute to a free, open society 
founded on democracy, human rights, and 
the respect for the rule of law. 
(6) The United States has reaped enormous 
economic, cultural, and strategic benefits 
from welcoming successive generations of 
scientists, doctors, entrepreneurs, artists, in-
tellectuals, and other freedom-loving people 
fleeing 
fascism, 
communism, 
violent 
Islamist extremism, and other repressive 
ideologies, including in the cases of Nazi 
Germany, the Soviet Union, and Soviet-con-
trolled Central Europe, Cuba, Vietnam, and 
Iran. 
(7) A major asymmetric advantage of the 
United States in its long-term strategic com-
petition with the Communist Party of China 
is the ability of people from every country in 
the world, irrespective of their race, eth-
nicity, or religion, to immigrate to the 
United States and become American citi-
zens. 
SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY. 
It is the policy of the United States— 
(1) to reaffirm the principles and objectives 
set forth in the United States-Hong Kong 
Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102–383), 
namely that— 
(A) the United States has ‘‘a strong inter-
est in the continued vitality, prosperity, and 
stability of Hong Kong’’; 
(B) ‘‘support for democratization is a fun-
damental principle of United States foreign 
policy’’ and therefore ‘‘naturally applies to 
United States policy toward Hong Kong’’; 
(C) ‘‘the human rights of the people of 
Hong Kong are of great importance to the 
United States and are directly relevant to 
United States interests in Hong Kong and 
serve as a basis for Hong Kong’s continued 
economic prosperity’’; and 
(D) Hong Kong must remain sufficiently 
autonomous from the PRC to ‘‘justify treat-
ment under a particular law of the United 
States, or any provision thereof, different 
from that accorded the People’s Republic of 
China’’; 
(2) to continue to support the high degree 
of autonomy and fundamental rights and 
freedoms of the people of Hong Kong, as enu-
merated by— 
(A) the Joint Declaration; 
(B) the International Covenant on Civil 
and Political Rights, done at New York De-
cember 19, 1966; and 
(C) the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights, done at Paris December 10, 1948; 
(3) to continue to support the democratic 
aspirations of the people of Hong Kong, in-
cluding the ‘‘ultimate aim’’ of the selection 
of the Chief Executive and all members of 
the Legislative Council by universal suf-
frage, as articulated in the Basic Law; 
(4) to urge the Government of the PRC, de-
spite its recent actions, to uphold its com-
mitments to Hong Kong, including allowing 
the people of Hong Kong to govern Hong 
Kong with a high degree of autonomy and 
without undue interference, and ensuring 
that Hong Kong voters freely enjoy the right 
to elect the Chief Executive and all members 
of the Hong Kong Legislative Council by uni-
versal suffrage; 
(5) to support the establishment of a gen-
uine democratic option to freely and fairly 
nominate and elect the Chief Executive of 
Hong Kong, and the establishment of open 
and direct democratic elections for all mem-
bers of the Hong Kong Legislative Council; 
(6) to support the robust exercise by resi-
dents of Hong Kong of the rights to free 
speech, the press, and other fundamental 
freedoms, as provided by the Basic Law, the 
Joint Declaration, and the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; 
(7) to support freedom from arbitrary or 
unlawful arrest, detention, or imprisonment 
for all Hong Kong residents, as provided by 
the Basic Law, the Joint Declaration, and 
the International Covenant on Civil and Po-
litical Rights; 
(8) to draw international attention to any 
violations by the Government of the PRC of 
the fundamental rights of the people of Hong 
Kong, as provided by the International Cov-
enant on Civil and Political Rights, and any 
encroachment upon the autonomy guaran-
teed to Hong Kong by the Basic Law and the 
Joint Declaration; 
(9) to protect United States citizens and 
long-term permanent residents living in 
Hong Kong, as well as people visiting and 
transiting through Hong Kong; 
(10) to maintain the economic and cultural 
ties that provide significant benefits to both 
the United States and Hong Kong, including 
the reinstatement of the Fulbright exchange 
program with regard to Hong Kong at the 
earliest opportunity; 
(11) to coordinate with allies, including the 
United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Japan, 
and the Republic of Korea, to promote de-
mocracy and human rights in Hong Kong; 
and 
(12) to welcome and protect in the United 
States residents of Hong Kong fleeing perse-
cution or otherwise seeking a safe haven 
from violations by the Government of the 
PRC of the fundamental rights of the people 
of Hong Kong. 
SEC. 5. TEMPORARY PROTECTED STATUS FOR 
HONG KONG RESIDENTS IN THE 
UNITED STATES. 
(a) DESIGNATION.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—For purposes of section

trative Region who are fleeing oppression by

SEC. 12. TERMINATION. 
Except as provided in section 6 of this Act,

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. ENGEL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 8428. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Con-
gressman MALINOWSKI for his tireless 
work on the Foreign Affairs Committee 
and particularly his advocacy on behalf 
of those maligned and abused by the 
Chinese Government. 
Mr. Speaker, China’s attacks on 
Hong Kong’s autonomy came to a head 
this year when they rammed through 
the National Security Law, effectively 
undermining the one country, two sys-
tems framework the Hong Kongers 
were promised. 
Since then, Beijing has used the law 
to arrest a number of pro-democracy 
activists. Just last week, Joshua Wong, 
Agnes Chow, and Ivan Lam were sen-
tenced to prison in an attempt by the 
People’s Republic of China to silence 
dissent. 
When the National Security Law was 
passed, 
the 
Trump 
administration 
abruptly eliminated a number of poli-
cies that gave Hong Kongers pref-
erential treatment under U.S. law, in-
cluding terminating immigration-re-
lated benefits to Hong Kong passport 
holders just when they needed it most. 
While the United States has shut our 
doors to the people of Hong Kong, the 
United Kingdom was welcoming those 
fleeing Xi Jinping’s tyranny, with Can-
ada now following suit. H.R. 8428 would 
allow the United States to do the same, 
telling the people of Hong Kong that 
the U.S. is open to them, that we want 
Hong Kongers to come to America and 
contribute their talents to our society. 
b 1300 
China is currently detaining 12 young 
Hong Kong activists who bravely tried 
to hold their government accountable 
for the commitments under inter-
national law. These are the kinds of 
people we should be helping. We really 
need to admire them. They are really 
on the front line, and we should not let 
China, the Beijing regime, get away 
with this. 
This legislation corrects the unforced 
error of the administration which 
closed our doors to people whom we 
should be defending. 
Congress 
has 
constantly 
dem-
onstrated strong bipartisan support for 
Hong Kong, and I urge my colleagues 
to do the same today. It is really ter-
rible to allow Beijing to get away with 
this. 
People of Hong Kong, as I said before, 
were promised that, when the United 
Kingdom gave up Hong Kong, the 
agreement with the Beijing Govern-
ment was that Hong Kong would have 
lots of autonomy and lots of freedom. 
And as they are doing in many places 
around the world, the People’s Repub-
lic of China, the Beijing Government, 
is just taking all their promises and 
throwing them away. 
We cannot allow that to happen. The 
United States must play a very major 
role, a very vocal role, and that is what 
the Congress is doing here today. It has 
bipartisan support by Democrats and 
Republicans. It should be supported by 
all Americans. I think perhaps it is, 
and we will send a clear message, not 
only to China, but all around the 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, 
Washington, DC, December 1, 2020. 
Hon. ELIOT ENGEL, 
Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN ENGEL: This is to advise 
you that the Committee on the Judiciary 
has now had an opportunity to review the 
provisions in H.R. 8428, ‘‘Hong Kong People’s 
Freedom and Choice Act of 2020’’ that fall 
within our Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate 
your consulting with us on those provisions. 
The Judiciary Committee has no objection 
to your including them in the bill for consid-
eration on the House floor, and to expedite 
that consideration is willing to forgo action 
on H.R. 8428, with the understanding that we 
do not thereby waive any future jurisdic-
tional claim over those provisions or their 
subject matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees.

tion of your Committee with respect to the

Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
ELIOT L. ENGEL, 
Chairman. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, over the last year, the 
world has watched as the Chinese Com-
munist Party has systematically de-
stroyed the political freedoms that 
were guaranteed to the people of Hong 
Kong under the British-Sino treaty. 
Hong Kongers are no longer allowed 
to exercise their rights of freedom of 
speech, freedom of expression, or free-
dom to peacefully assemble. Many 
protestors in Hong Kong have been 
beaten in the streets; others have been 
arrested and thrown in jail without due 
process. 
Last week, we learned Hong Kong 
pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong 
was sentenced to 13 months in jail for 
simply demanding the freedoms he was 
promised. Other activists like Agnes 
Chow and Ivan Lam were sentenced to 
10 months in jail as well. 
This is the Chinese Communist Party 
showing its true colors as enemies of 
freedom and brutal oppressors of its 
own people. 
I have had the privilege to speak 
with Joshua Wong on several occa-
sions, including last year when he tes-
tified before our committee. He is de-
voted to Hong Kong, to his people, and 
to democracy. The Chinese Communist 
Party has jailed him for more than a 
year in what is an appalling injustice. 
It is no wonder that the Director of 
National Intelligence recently wrote 
that the People’s Republic of China 
poses the greatest threat to America 
today, and the greatest threat to de-
mocracy and freedom worldwide since 
World War II. I couldn’t agree more. 
That is why I was proud to chair the 
China Task Force earlier this year. 
And after months of classified and un-
classified briefings, the China Task 
Force released a report with 82 key 
findings 
and 
more 
than 
400 
rec-
ommendations, many of which are fo-
cused on what steps we should take to 
help the people of Hong Kong, includ-
ing providing support to Hong Kong 
refugees fleeing the Chinese Com-
munist Party persecution, which this 
bill does. 
The Hong Kong People’s Freedom 
and Choice Act serves as a reminder to 
the Chinese Communist Party that 
America stands with the people of 
Hong Kong, and it will stand for free-
dom. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, also, 
the sponsor of this bill, a member of 
the Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. 
MALINOWSKI, for bringing this bill for-
ward here today. I urge my colleagues 
to join us in support of this important 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, as you can 
see, there is bipartisan support for this. 
As Americans, we have an absolute 
stake in what goes on in China and 
Hong Kong. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
New 
Jersey 
(Mr. 
MALINOWSKI), the author of this impor-
tant bill, a valued member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee. 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Chairman ENGEL for his leader-
ship for human rights on this issue and 
on so many issues as the leader of our 
committee, and for the very strong 
words that he just delivered on this im-
portant legislation, the Hong Kong 
People’s Freedom and Choice Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the bi-
partisan 
sponsors, 
Representatives 
KINZINGER, CASTRO, and CURTIS. I want 
to thank Ranking Member MCCAUL and 
leadership on both sides of the aisle for 
making the issue of Hong Kong and our 
efforts to provide safe haven for its 
people a bipartisan issue. 
As the gentleman mentioned, the 
China Task Force that he chaired, rec-
ommended an approach very similar to 
the one that we will be embracing here 
today. I think the reason why we are 
united on this issue is that, although 
we may sometimes use different lan-
guage, we do have a common under-
standing of the challenge that the 
United States faces with respect to 
China. 
We understand that we are in a con-
test, not with China the country, not 
with the Chinese people, but with the 
Chinese Government, the Chinese Com-
munist Party. It is a contest of ideas 
and ideals. It is about the most funda-
mental 
questions: 
how 
the 
world 
should be organized, whether there are 
any rules that apply to the most pow-
erful nations and the most powerful 
governments, or whether those nations 
and governments can impose their will 
on anyone as they choose; a contest be-
tween democracy and kleptocracy. 
It is a contest that we win, in my 
view, by remembering what we stand 
for as a country, by staying true to 
that, by winning allies to that, by ral-
lying hearts and minds around the 
world to that. 
So with that in mind, I would like to 
make just two points that are relevant 
to this bill. 
Number one, Hong Kong is very im-
portant to this contest. It is a city on 
the front lines, geographically and 
morally, just like Berlin was during 
the Cold War. It is a place where the 
Chinese Government made a promise to 
respect the autonomy of Hong Kong, to 
respect the freedom of speech, the free-
dom of assembly, the rule of law that 
people enjoyed there. 
China, today, is plainly breaking 
those promises, and by breaking them, 
it is testing us, because those promises 
were made not just to the people of 
Hong Kong but to the United States 
and to the international community. It 
is testing to see whether we will do 
something; and, therefore, we must. 
The second point I will make is that 
we know something as a country about 
how to win a contest like this because 
we waged one during the Cold War. We 
have learned lessons about what to do 
and what not to do, and one of those 
lessons is that the best way to win 
against a dictatorship is to pit the 
strength of our system against the 
weakness of theirs, to hold up the glar-
ing contrast between our free, open, 
and self-confident democracy, against 
the weakness of the oppressive, closed, 
and fearful system that the Communist 
Party has imposed on the Chinese peo-
ple, including, now, in Hong Kong. 
One way we do that is by self-con-
fidently opening our doors. That is 
what we did during the Cold War. 
Hundreds of thousands of people from 
the former Soviet Union, including 
400,000 religious refugees from the 
former Soviet Union itself and many, 
many more from Hungary, Poland—my 
family, for example—Czechoslovakia, 
and others, came to the United States 
over the decades. Yes, they were dis-
sidents. 
Sometimes 
they 
were 
protestors; sometimes they were polit-
ical; but mostly, they were the people 
with open and inquiring minds, the 
risk-takers, the entrepreneurs, the sci-
entists, the artists, and the best and 
brightest. 
And the Soviet bloc’s loss was our 
gain. They made us stronger, and their 
success here was a constant reproach 
to the Communist regimes that they 
left behind, a constant reminder to the 
people still trapped behind the Iron 
Curtain, that there is a better way to 
live than in a dictatorship. 
So that is what we are doing in this 
bill. We are saying that we are willing 
to provide temporary refuge to Hong 
Kongers who are already in the United 
States, to expedite processing of ref-
ugee applications for Hong Kongers 
fleeing persecution. We call for a strat-
egy to work with our allies, because 
the United States, obviously, cannot do 
this by itself, but we can lead this ef-
fort. 
We are saying, by passing this legis-
lation, something very, very important 
to the Chinese Government. We are 
saying: If you crush Hong Kong, you 
will lose its best and brightest citizens, 
the people responsible for its vitality, 
but we will let them come to the 
United States and contribute to our vi-
tality instead. 
So it is a humanitarian gesture, but 
it is actually much more than a hu-
manitarian gesture. It is one of the 
best ways we have to deter China from 
crushing Hong Kong. The Chinese Gov-
ernment understands perfectly well 
that this is a threat.

Kongers earlier this year, they said it 
was a gross interference, and they con-
demned it. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. MALINOWSKI). 
Mr. 
MALINOWSKI. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
they condemned Canada for doing ex-
actly the same thing a few months ago. 
I don’t believe they expect us to do 
it. They surely expect us to condemn 
them. They surely expect us to slap a 
few sanctions on their leadership, as 
the State Department did today, which 
I am fine with. But they do not expect 
us to use the strength of our society 
against the weakness of theirs by open-
ing our doors to Hong Kongers fleeing 
persecution, giving them that option 
that is being denied to them in Hong 
Kong itself. 
So let’s stand by the brave people of 
Hong Kong. Let’s make the Chinese 
Communist Party uncomfortable, as 
this sure will, and let’s do it in the best 
traditions of America’s openness to 
people seeking freedom from oppres-
sion around the world. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend, Chairman ENGEL, and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL
for their 
leadership on this matter and all the 
members on the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee who worked so diligently to 
support the people of Hong Kong, their 
autonomy, and their freedoms. 
In my travel to Hong Kong, I wit-
nessed firsthand the innovative spirit 
and work ethic of the citizens of that 
special place. Hong Kongers, like peo-
ple all around the globe, look to the 
United States as a symbol for freedom 
and democracy, that beacon of hope in 
a sea of global despair that we have 
been for some 21⁄2 centuries. 
Today, as the CCP tightens its grip 
on Hong Kong, we must provide unwav-
ering support for the democratic de-
sires of the people of Hong Kong and be 
steadfast in our solidarity with these 
democracy-loving, hardworking people. 
That is why I am pleased to support 
and urge all my colleagues to support 
this important bill, H.R. 8428, the Hong 
Kong People’s Freedom and Choice 
Act, to give those seeking refuge on 
our shores the protection they need. 
As the people of Hong Kong cry out 
to the free world for support against 
tyranny, the United States stands at 
their side to join those calling on the 
CCP to honor their 1984 treaty commit-
ments and those aiding those Hong 
Kongers seeking refuge. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, at this 
point in time, I would like to take a 
moment of personal privilege to honor 
my dear friend, the gentleman from 
New York. 
This may perhaps be our last time on 
the floor debating together. We have 
become good friends over the last 2 
years as chairman and ranking mem-
ber. I would argue that is the way it is 
supposed to be. 
Chairman ENGEL often says, and I 
agree, that when it comes to foreign 
policy, that partisanship stops at the 
water’s edge. In fact, just last year, 
RealClearPolitics described the For-
eign Affairs Committee as an island of 
calm in a sea of partisanship. An island 
of calm in a sea of partisanship—I take 
that as a great compliment, and I know 
you should, too. 
No one embodies that more than our 
committee chairman, ELIOT ENGEL. I 
am honored to call him my friend. 
Anyone who has ever worked with 
Chairman ENGEL, or just even had the 
opportunity to meet him, knows that 
he is truly a gentleman in every sense 
of the word. He always puts civility 
first, and he values public service and 
honor above everything else. 
But not everyone knows that the 
man has got a great sense of humor. He 
is one of the funniest guys I know. 
b 1315 
And that is why if you watch videos 
of us in the Foreign Affairs Committee 
on the dais, you will often see him lean 
over and whisper something to me, and 
I couldn’t help but respond with laugh-
ter. And I have shared that sense of 
humor with him over the last 2 years. 
Perhaps one of the fondest memories 
I have, Mr. Speaker, is traveling to 
Normandy on the 75th anniversary of 
D-day to see our D-day veterans, ones 
like my father, who fought in World 
War II as part of the D-day air cam-
paign, to see those brave patriots who 
crushed and destroyed the evils of Nazi 
Germany. 
Now, for those of you who may not 
know, there is a younger picture of 
ELIOT that really looks just like one of 
the Beatles, and that would be John 
Lennon. And I was thinking about 
blowing it up and putting it on the 
floor, but I wanted to save you that. 
But it is not a bad looking picture. 
So when we were on this codel, we de-
cided, you know what, we are going to 
break away from the pack and have our 
own private dinner at Le Meurice in 
Paris. And I bought this really cool 
pair of sunglasses. They had to be read-
ers, but they were sunglasses, and 
maybe for a guy from Texas they were 
a little too funky, but then when I 
looked at ELIOT and that John Lennon 
look, I handed the glasses to ELIOT, he 
put them on, and he looked absolutely 
fantastic in those glasses. So I said, 
ELIOT, you can have those glasses. And 
it always charms me when he puts 
those glasses on sometimes at a com-
mittee hearing. 
But no matter where he goes, ELIOT 
is always the one to lighten the mood 
and make people feel more at ease. And 
that is really his way. He wants people 
to know that they are heard and that 
he is in their corner. 
I will never forget the trip we took to 
the Colombia-Venezuela border at the 
height of the humanitarian crisis. We 
saw firsthand the six million people 
who fled the corrupt Maduro regime 
and the fallout that it caused. It was 
truly the worst humanitarian and ref-
ugee crisis facing the Western Hemi-
sphere. 
ELIOT
and I knew that something 
needed to be done, and as a result we 
introduced the United States-Northern 
Triangle Enhanced Engagement Act, 
which aimed to curb illegal migration, 
spur economic development, and com-
bat corruption in the area. 
And not long after that, we intro-
duced the bipartisan Global Fragility 
Act to improve the way the United 
States deals with fragile nations. And I 
am proud to say this bipartisan bill 
was signed into law last year. 
Both of these legislative achieve-
ments are aimed at helping people who 
need it the most because that is who 
Chairman ENGEL truly is. 
He sees this very large world that we 
live in and immediately wants to come 
to the aid of those who are suffering, 
those who are sick, and those who are 
needing a helping hand. 
Under Chairman ENGEL’s leadership 
on issues like these he has played a 
pivotal role in shaping United States 
foreign policy. The world is and will 
continue to be a more stable and secure 
place because of him. 
In light of these accomplishments 
and so much more, I found it only fit-
ting to name this year’s State Depart-
ment 
Authorization 
Act 
after 
the 
chairman, and I am proud to say the 
Eliot Engel State Department Act 
passed the House last year. 
You know, most people could not 
imagine a Democrat from the Bronx 
and a Republican from the heart of 
Texas could not only work so well to-
gether, but that we would become best 
of friends, especially not in a town that 
is so often divided by politics. 
But Mr. ENGEL and I decided early on 
from the start that we could achieve 
more if we focused on the things we 
agreed on than the things we didn’t 
agree on. And the fact is, we agree on 
95 percent of foreign policy issues and 
it is through our friendship that we 
have been able to accomplish so much. 
I would say that serving with Chair-
man ENGEL has truly been a highlight 
of my political and professional career 
on the Hill. I know that wherever he 
goes next and wherever his lovely wife, 
Pat, and he go next that he will con-
tinue to serve our country honorably. 
For his decades of service to this 
country, for his unwavering support for 
Israel and his long opposition to the 
Ayatollah in Iran and his long list of 
policy achievements, I believe that I 
speak for all of us here in the Chamber 
and all of us in the House when I say, 
‘‘Thank you, sir. Thank you for your 
service.’’ It has been an honor. 
Your legacy of pursuing bipartisan-
ship policy solutions that strengthen 
our country will live on for years to 
come, and I hope it will be a role model 
for future committees and chairmen

December 7, 2020 
and ranking members as to how to 
work together to get good things done 
for the American people because that is 
what most Americans care about. They 
don’t care about our political stripes; 
they want to know: What are you doing 
for the American people? And we have 
shown and led by example. 
It is going to be hard for me to watch 
you, Mr. Chairman, leave this Cham-
ber. You are my favorite chairman. But 
there is so much to celebrate with your 
time in Congress and the legacy that 
you will leave behind. So from the bot-
tom of my heart to my dear friend, 
Chairman ENGEL, and to your wonder-
ful wife Pat, who I have gotten to know 
over the years, who is a beautiful, pre-
cious woman, let me just say that both 
of you will truly be missed. We will 
miss you, but we know you are not 
going to be far away. And we know 
that you will be there in the future. 
And I look forward to working with 
you in your future position, which we 
discussed over dinner last Saturday 
night with Ed Royce, as well, your 
other dear friend, who has my utmost 
respect. 
I would say this: Sometimes you 
have respect for a chairman because 
you fear them. We have respect for you 
because we admire you because you are 
an honest, decent man, and you are a 
true leader. You lead by example, and 
people want to follow a good man like 
that. You are a good man, Mr. Chair-
man, and it has been a great experience 
the time we have had together. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
In closing, we can no longer deny the 
Chinese Communist Party is an enemy 
of democracy and a threat to inter-
national security and to freedom. 
Nowhere is that more clear than in 
Hong Kong. 
We cannot turn a blind eye to the 
CCP’s brutal crackdown on freedom 
and democracy there. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting the Hong Kong 
People’s Freedom and Choice Act. 
With this legislation, we have the op-
portunity to assist the freedom-loving 
people of Hong Kong and to remind the 
world the United States of America 
stands with anyone who stands for free-
dom. 
I thank my friends and colleagues, 
Congressmen 
MALINOWSKI
and 
KINZINGER and, most importantly, the 
chairman, Chairman ENGEL, for their 
hard work on this issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time for the pur-
pose of closing. 
I want to first comment on some of 
the things that my good friend Mr. 
MCCAUL
said. I am touched by his 
statement. I am touched by the work 
we have done together. It has been a 
pleasure. And I think that the way we 
work on the Foreign Affairs Committee 
is the way I think all committees 
should work and Congress should work. 
I think people are tired of fighting and 
people want to see us work together. 
It has been a pleasure for me to be 
chairman of the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee, and it has been a pleasure for 
me to work with such good people like 
Mr. MCCAUL of Texas. 
Saturday night we, as you alluded to, 
we got together for dinner, actually in 
your house, with Mr. Royce, as well, 
and we had a very good time. Most of 
the time we talked about work, but 
many of the other times we just talked 
about our relationships and the general 
direction that we would like to see the 
United States take in the international 
field. 
It is very difficult to leave a place 
that you love. I have been fortunate to 
have spent 32 years in this robust body. 
These have been the 32 best years of 
my life, and something that I will al-
ways remember. I will remember it be-
cause we have done good work for peo-
ple. We have done good work for Amer-
icans. We have done good work for peo-
ple around the world. But I will re-
member it even more because of the 
good friends that I met, friends like 
Mr. MCCAUL who work hard, who reach 
out to the other side of the aisle. 
And you know what, when you get 
together with people on the other side 
of the aisle, you realize that you have 
so much in common with them that 
perhaps you didn’t even realize because 
the truth of the matter is, here in Con-
gress, if somebody is not on your com-
mittee and they are from the other 
party, you hardly ever get to see them. 
You hardly ever get to know them. You 
hardly ever get to be able to work with 
them. I have tried to change that. So 
has Mr. MCCAUL. And we have suc-
ceeded. We really have succeeded. 
I hope that the rest of the Congress 
in the years to come will see what we 
have done and will try to emulate us 
and try to do things that really push 
the government and the people of this 
great country to work together on 
issues because we all want the same 
thing for this wonderful country. We 
are all pleased to serve this wonderful 
country. And we want to make sure 
that others will get all of the benefits 
that we have, as well, being able to just 
be free, support freedom, and work to-
gether. 
In closing, I want to, again, say to 
Mr. MCCAUL that it is a pleasure work-
ing with you. It has been a pleasure. 
But we are going to continue to do 
other things together. And I hope that 
all our colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle will see what we have done on the 
Foreign Affairs Committee and try to 
do the same thing. People want us to 
work together. We may disagree on 
issues. That is what this body is for. 
But I don’t disagree with anybody’s 
right to say what they want, and I 
don’t disagree with people wanting to 
let everyone know how strongly they 
feel about the issues. 
To Mr. MCCAUL, my good friend, I 
hope you will invite me back for din-
ner. It has been a pleasure being your 
friend. It has been a pleasure working 
with you. 
Again, the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee has just been a wonderful place. 
It was the first committee which I 
joined when I came to this body 32 
years ago. 
So I tell my friends that I am not 
going away. I will be around. And, 
hopefully, we can continue all the good 
things that we have done like this bill, 
the national security law. It is a dev-
astating blow to the cause of human 
rights, democracy, and prosperity in 
Hong Kong. It is the national security 
law that Beijing has forced Hong Kong 
to swallow. It is a blow to the cause of 
human rights. We will not countenance 
it. H.R. 8428 opens America’s doors to 
Hong Kongers searching for freedom 
from Beijing’s aggression. 
I once again thank Mr. MALINOWSKI 
for authoring this legislation, which 
not only protects U.S. interests but 
supports the people of Hong Kong 
whose independence has slowly been 
stripped away from them. 
Again, let me thank all my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle. It 
has been a pleasure working with you. 
Let me especially thank my friend, Mr. 
MCCAUL. In working together, we are 
going to make sure that the American 
people get the kind of government they 
deserve, get the kind of things that 
they deserve. 
This is a wonderful country, and we 
are fortunate to be representing our 
home districts in this country. So let 
me say, God bless America. God bless 
all the people in our country who work 
every day, who want help. 
We are undergoing difficulty right 
now with the virus in this country, but 
as Americans we will persevere, and we 
will continue to have our role as the 
leaders of the free world. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 8428, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as

community partnerships and engage-
ment, and for other purposes, as 
amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 461 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘HBCU Pro-
pelling Agency Relationships Towards a New 
Era of Results for Students Act’’ or the 
‘‘HBCU PARTNERS Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) As many colleges and universities 
across the country kept their doors closed to 
African American applicants, historically 
Black colleges and universities (referred to 
in this section as ‘‘HBCUs’’) played a central 
role in ensuring that African Americans 
could attain an excellent education. 
(2) Today, HBCUs continue to play a crit-
ical role in ensuring that African Americans, 
and those of all races, can access high-qual-
ity educational opportunities. 
(3) HBCUs enroll nearly 300,000 students, an 
estimated 70 percent of whom come from 
low-income backgrounds and 80 percent of 
whom are African American. 
(4) According to the National Association 
For Equal Opportunity In Higher Education 
(referred to in this section as ‘‘NAFEO’’), 
HBCUs make up just 3 percent of American 
institutions of higher education but serve 
more than a fifth of African American col-
lege students. 
(5) According to the Thurgood Marshall 
College Fund (referred to in this section as 
‘‘TMCF’’), approximately 9 percent of all Af-
rican American college students attend 
HBCUs. 
(6) A March 2017 report from the Education 
Trust concluded that HBCUs have higher 
completion rates for African American stu-
dents than other institutions serving similar 
student populations. 
(7) According to TMCF, 40 percent of Afri-
can American Members of Congress, 50 per-
cent of African American lawyers, and 80 
percent of African American judges are grad-
uates of HBCUs. 
(8) According to NAFEO, HBCUs graduate 
approximately 50 percent of African Amer-
ican public school teaching professionals. 
(9) According to the United Negro College 
Fund 
(referred 
to 
in 
this 
section 
as 
‘‘UNCF’’), African American graduates of 
HBCUs are almost twice as likely as African 
Americans who graduated from other insti-
tutions to report that their university pre-
pared them well for life. 
(10) According to a study commissioned by 
UNCF, in 2014, HBCUs generated a total di-
rect economic impact of $14,800,000,000 and 
created more than 134,000 jobs. 
(11) According to a 2019 report produced by 
the American Council on Education and 
UNCF, despite efforts to counter a historical 
legacy of inequitable funding and notable in-
vestments by the Federal Government and 
many State governments, resource inequi-
ties continue to plague HBCUs. 
(b) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this Act 
are— 
(1) to strengthen the capacity and competi-
tiveness of HBCUs to fulfill their principal 
mission of equalizing educational oppor-
tunity, as described in section 301(b) of the 
Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1051(b)); 
(2) to align HBCUs with the educational 
and economic competitiveness priorities of 
the United States; 
(3) to provide students enrolled at HBCUs 
with the highest quality educational and 
economic opportunities; 
(4) to bolster and facilitate productive 
interactions between HBCUs and Federal 
agencies; and 
(5) to encourage HBCU participation in and 
benefit from Federal programs, grants, con-
tracts, and cooperative agreements.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-

North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS) and the 
gentleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from North Carolina. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on S. 461, the 
HBCU PARTNERS Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in support of S. 461, the HBCU 
PARTNERS Act, as amended. 
Mr. Speaker, today is a special day 
for bipartisanship and for equity, ac-
cess, and inclusion. 
For centuries, this country has made 
promises to the African-American com-
munity that have gone largely unmet: 
promises of freedom, promises of jus-
tice, and promises of equal oppor-
tunity. 
So, today, we vote for a fighting 
chance to rectify this history and the 
impacts it has had on the Black com-
munity. Today, we vote to give HBCUs 
and the communities they serve a real 
permanent seat at the table with the 
President of the United States and our 
Nation’s Federal agencies. 
You see, like the people of color they 
serve, HBCUs are embedded in the fab-
ric of this Nation and they play a vital 
role in its prosperity. While countless 
other institutions have often fallen 
short, HBCUs have long been the 
means of delivering on our Nation’s 
promise of freedom and opportunity for 
all, 
especially 
for 
communities 
of 
color. 
For generations, these schools have 
fought to deliver for African Americans 
what is owed to them, a first-class edu-
cation and a fair shot at pursuing hap-
piness. 
While only representing roughly 3 
percent of all 4-year colleges and uni-
versities, HBCUs produce upwards of 17 
percent of all bachelor’s degrees award-
ed to African Americans. HBCU grad-
uates account for 42 percent of all 
Black engineers and 47 percent of all 
Black female engineers. 
What is more, these institutions 
produce 27 percent of all African-Amer-
ican STEM graduates, 50 percent of all 
African-American lawyers, 50 percent 
of all African-American public school-
teachers, and 80 percent of all African- 
American judges. 
Further, research has found that 
HBCUs are more successful at boosting 
students out of the lowest income dis-
tributions than other institutions of 
higher education. 
In fact, nearly 70 percent of students 
of HBCUs attain at least middle class 
incomes after graduation, including 
nearly 70 percent of low-income stu-
dents. 
On an annual basis, HBCUs con-
tribute nearly $15 billion to the econ-
omy, produce 134,000 jobs, and create 
$46.8 billion in alumni career earnings 
that can be directly attributed to their 
degrees. 
HBCUs are clearly centers of ad-
vancement and excellence in this coun-
try. It is important to note that this 
incredible success has been achieved 
despite over a century of systemic 
underfunding at both the State and 
Federal levels. 
That is why my bill, the HBCU 
PARTNERS Act, is so very crucial. 
This legislation will require every ad-
ministration and the Federal agencies 
it manages to plan and coordinate, on 
an annual basis, their efforts to strate-
gically engage in investing in HBCUs. 
This bill also strengthens the rigor 
and transparency requirements of ex-
isting law, requiring that agencies 
track their progress toward goals con-
cerning HBCUs and share their plans to 
advance them with Congress. 
In addition, it codifies the Presi-
dent’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs, en-
suring an ongoing avenue for HBCU 
priorities and policy concerns to be 
raised and addressed. 
In other words, this legislation pro-
vides us with an opportunity to com-
mit to HBCUs in the same way they 
have committed to the well-being and 
prosperity of our country. And in a 
very real way, it provides us with a 
chance to try to honor our Nation’s 
promises. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in support of S. 461, the 
Historically Black Colleges and Uni-
versities—HBCU—PARTNERS 
Act, 
which stands for Propelling Agency Re-
lationships Towards a New Era of Re-
sults for Students. 
This legislation is a result of bipar-
tisan, bicameral collaboration and ex-
ecutive leadership across administra-
tions. Executive orders on HBCUs 
began under Jimmy Carter and have 
evolved with each succeeding Presi-
dent. 
In 1989, George H.W. Bush established 
the first President’s Board of Advisors 
on HBCUs and the White House Initia-
tive on HBCUs. 
In February 2017, President Trump 
built upon these historic efforts and 
issued an executive order to promote 
excellence and innovation at HBCUs. S. 
461 would codify President Trump’s ex-
ecutive order to pave a brighter and 
stronger path forward for HBCUs. 
Notably, this bill established the 
President’s Board of Advisors, a 23- 
member board responsible for advising 
the 
President 
and 
reporting 
on 
strengthening the educational capacity 
and economic offerings of HBCUs. 
The board will also work closely with 
the White House Initiative on HBCUs 
to make recommendations to improve 
overall 
competitiveness 
of 
HBCUs, 
their ability to remain financially se-
cure, how to elevate public awareness 
and appreciation of HBCUs, and more. 
Federal 
agencies 
will 
collaborate 
with the White House Initiative on 
HBCUs, and each agency will work to 
increase the capacity of HBCUs to com-
pete effectively for Federal grants and 
contracts and to participate in Federal 
programs. 
As a member of the Education & 
Labor Committee, I have spent time 
learning about the ways in which 
HBCUs serve our country’s students 
and higher education community. I 
know I speak for many on the com-
mittee and in this Chamber when I say 
that HBCUs play a critical role in pre-
paring our country’s next generation of 
leaders and innovators. 
This legislation before us today will 
empower HBCUs’ education and eco-
nomic offerings so they can continue

serving students, families, and commu-
nities across the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting ‘‘yes’’ on 
this bill, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
SMUCKER) for his kind remarks and 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), 
the chairman of the Committee on 
Education & Labor and a tremendous 
supporter of education. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise in support of S. 461, as amend-
ed, the HBCU PARTNERS Act. 
Since their inception, HBCUs have 
been engines of social mobility and a 
cornerstone of secondary education for 
underserved 
students, 
particularly 
Black students from low-income back-
grounds. 
Today, HBCUs account for no more 
than 3 percent of all colleges and uni-
versities in the country, yet these in-
stitutions, as we have heard, produce 
nearly 20 percent of all Black under-
graduates, half of all Black profes-
sionals, and one-third of all Black 
STEM degree earners. 
Despite this outsized role in expand-
ing access to higher education, HBCUs 
continue to be underresourced com-
pared to other institutions of higher 
learning. 
This historic lack of support is being 
further exacerbated by the COVID–19 
pandemic, as HBCUs disproportion-
ately suffer from dramatically lower 
enrollment and State funding. 
Mr. Speaker, there is simply no bet-
ter time to support these critical insti-
tutions than by passing this legislation 
before us today. 
The HBCUs PARTNERS Act would 
ensure that our Federal agencies ac-
tively work with HBCUs to advance 
their critical mission of opening the 
door to higher education for students 
across the country. 
This bipartisan bill demonstrates 
that regardless of political affiliation, 
we can all agree that during this dark 
hour in our higher education system, 
our Nation’s HBCUs are an investment 
worth making. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Ms. 
ADAMS), the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. WALKER), and the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER), and the entire bipartisan 
HBCU Caucus for their work on this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the legislation. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. HILL). 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. SMUCKER), my friend, for 
yielding. 
I rise today in strong support of S. 
461, the HBCU PARTNERS Act, intro-
duced by my friend from South Caro-
lina in the Senate, Senator TIM SCOTT; 
and my good friend here in the House, 
Congresswoman ALMA ADAMS of North 
Carolina; 
and 
a 
strong 
bipartisan 
group, including my good friend from 
Virginia, our chairman of the Edu-
cation & Labor Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, HBCUs play a critical 
role in the education of our young peo-
ple in this country. Throughout their 
history, they have helped students 
achieve the dream of a college edu-
cation and their unique start to that 
pursuit of happiness. 
In our central Arkansas region, we 
are 
blessed 
with 
four 
outstanding 
HBCUs, including Arkansas Baptist 
College, 
Philander 
Smith 
College, 
Shorter College, and the University of 
Arkansas at Pine Bluff. 
As the vice chairman of the Bipar-
tisan Congressional HBCU Caucus, I 
am encouraged by the legislation that 
we consider today because it draws on 
partnerships—public, private, commu-
nity—to strengthen our HBCUs. This 
has been a key for success of our 
HBCUs in Arkansas. 
Inspired by the strong Federal con-
sensus both in the executive branch 
and the legislative branch, last year I 
sponsored and hosted the first regional 
HBCU Summit in Little Rock to foster 
public- and private-sector partnerships 
to enhance our HBCUs for philan-
thropy, student recruitment and ad-
vancement, and workforce partnerships 
and apprenticeships. 
I am committed to supporting our 
HBCUs to help them continue to grad-
uate Americans who are prepared for a 
competitive global environment. 
Every student in America deserves 
the opportunity to succeed. For thou-
sands of students in Arkansas and 
across the country, HBCUs offer those 
young people the key tools to help 
them succeed in that opportunity. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my friends on 
the HBCU Caucus, Chair ADAMS; our 
friend 
from 
Pennsylvania; 
and, 
of 
course, the chairman. 
b 1345 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close. I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
The HBCU PARTNERS Act is a cul-
mination of leadership from both Re-
publican and Democrat administra-
tions. This bill has been crafted with 
bipartisan, bicameral input and, more 
importantly, with input from HBCU 
groups themselves. 
HBCUs are a critical part of Amer-
ica’s postsecondary education system. 
Today’s legislation will renew our com-
mitment to these institutions and em-
power HBCUs to continue providing 
countless men and women opportuni-
ties to pursue their dreams. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, how much 
time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina has 131⁄2 
minutes remaining. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I would like to thank both of the gen-
tlemen for their support of this bill. 
Clearly, I have to put on the record, 
as I continue to do, that I am a proud 
two-time graduate of an HBCU, North 
Carolina A&T State University, and I 
spent 40 years teaching at an HBCU in 
Greensboro, North Carolina, Bennett 
College. It was an HBCU that made a 
committed investment in me as I pre-
pared to come to college and molded 
and shaped me into what they knew I 
could become. 
Mr. Speaker, despite limited means, 
HBCUs have always generously served 
their communities because they under-
stand the critical role that they play in 
advancing equity and access. They 
build on the philosophy of W.E.B. 
DuBois, who talked about education 
and said: ‘‘Of all the civil rights for 
which the world has struggled and 
fought for 5,000 years, the right to 
learn is undoubtedly the most funda-
mental.’’ 
The HBCU PARTNERS Act recog-
nizes these fundamental rights and 
these contributions in the most impor-
tant way possible, by affording these 
institutions the ongoing support and 
investment needed to deepen their 
transformational work. 
Advancing the mission of HBCUs and 
the prosperity of the communities they 
serve must be on the minds of our 
country’s leaders. More importantly, it 
must be part of their agendas. 
If America wants to deliver on its 
promises of equal opportunity for all, 
investing in HBCUs is certainly one of 
the most important ways to do so. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from North Carolina 
(Ms. ADAMS) that the House suspend 
the rules and pass the bill, S. 461, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion will be 
postponed.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS) and the gen-
tleman 
from

(Mr.

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and to 
include any extraneous material on S. 
1153, the Stop Student Debt Relief 
Scams Act of 2019. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of S. 1153, the Stop Student Debt Relief 
Scams Act, today. 
I would like to thank my colleague, 
Congressman SMUCKER, for cointro-
ducing this bill with me and for his ef-
forts to end these debt relief scams. We 
all know that our country faces a 
mounting student debt crisis, with 
Americans now holding more than $1.5 
trillion in student loan debt. 
Predatory scammers are increasingly 
taking advantage of student loan bor-
rowers, who face a complicated loan re-
payment process. These unscrupulous 
scams defraud student borrowers by 
providing 
deceptive 
information 
to 
mislead them into paying thousands of 
dollars for services that the Federal 
Government already provides for free. 
These 
scams 
come 
by 
way 
of 
robocalls. They are harassing and men-
acing, and the victims of these schemes 
are not only defrauded but, unknow-
ingly, become delinquent on their pay-
ments and default on their loans, fall-
ing even deeper into debt. 
We hear this time and time again be-
cause these phone calls come to your 
personal cell phone even if you don’t 
have a student loan. 
In 2007, I took out $9,000 of student 
loans to finish my last semester of 
graduate school. I was able to repay 
that loan within 6 years. Years later, I 
still receive these very types of men-
acing phone calls, to my personal cell 
phone, of scams asking me to go 
through these programs.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6882 
December 7, 2020 
These are individuals who receive in-
formation through the Department of 
Education. This is what we are trying 
to stop. They are accessing your per-
sonal information to scam you. 
This is what we are here today to 
stop. This problem, unfortunately, dur-
ing COVID–19 has only exacerbated. 
During this pandemic, the relief that 
was provided to help Federal student 
loan borrowers under the CARES Act 
has created additional opportunities 
for 
scammers 
to 
target 
desperate 
Americans. 
This bill will ensure that the Depart-
ment of Education and law enforce-
ment agencies have the tools they need 
to crack down on these predatory 
fraudsters. It will also empower stu-
dent borrowers by providing counseling 
and resources to make sure that all 
borrowers are aware of these potential 
scams and receive accurate informa-
tion about the repayment options. 
Knowledge is power here. It is time 
to stop these scammers from jeopard-
izing the financial future of student 
borrowers, and I urge my colleagues to 
support the passage of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 1153, the Stop Student Debt Relief 
Scams Act. I was proud to have intro-
duced the companion bill to this, H.R. 
2888, with Representative STEVENS. 
We cointroduced this bill, and I want 
to thank the gentlewoman for her lead-
ership on this bill and for her work on 
this important issue. This is bipar-
tisan, bicameral legislation that will 
crack down on third-party debt collec-
tion scammers who exploit vulnerable 
students. 
Over 40 million Americans today, Mr. 
Speaker, owe a collective $1.5 trillion 
in Federal student loan debt. Students 
are working hard to pay off their loans, 
but many are struggling to make ends 
meet. To that end, Congress offers bor-
rowers an array of options to relieve 
the financial pressure of their debt. 
The Department of Education hires 
Federal student loan servicers to assist 
borrowers in repaying their loans by 
helping the borrower select the best op-
tion for their specific situation. 
These services are all provided at no 
cost to borrowers. Unfortunately, there 
are hundreds of malicious third-party 
debt collection companies that are 
seizing on students’ vulnerability and 
engaging in predatory schemes by sell-
ing students on the notion that their 
company will reduce or make the stu-
dent loan debt disappear. 
These are scammers who trick bor-
rowers into paying an exorbitant fee 
for a service that is already available 
for free through the Federal student 
loan servicer. Even worse, the victims 
of the scheme usually become delin-
quent and enter default because their 
payments are no longer going to reduce 
their loan balance but are, instead, lin-
ing the pockets of these debt relief 
scammers. 
This bill and the House companion 
bill would help Federal and State offi-
cials 
take 
action 
against 
these 
scammers. Specifically, the bill clari-
fies that it is a Federal crime to access 
the Department of Education informa-
tion technology systems for fraud, 
commercial advantage, or for private 
financial gain. 
The bill also penalizes scammers 
with a fine of up to $20,000, imprison-
ment of up to a 5-year sentence, or 
some combination of both. These meas-
ures ensure that there are strong deter-
rents set in place to prevent wide-
spread abuse from debt scammers. 
Our bill also improves student loan 
exit counseling by warning Federal 
loan borrowers about debt relief scams 
and informing them that these third- 
party companies charge money for 
services that are already provided to 
borrowers for free by the Department 
of Education. 
Creating awareness will significantly 
aid students’ ability to spot a scam. 
Importantly, this legislation requires 
the Department of Education to main-
tain commonsense reporting, detec-
tion, and prevention activities to stop 
potential or known debt relief scams. 
Student loan borrowers face many 
obstacles in our generous yet com-
plicated student loan system. Congress 
must see to it that the malicious ac-
tors who seek to con students and line 
their own pockets are stopped. 
Mr. Speaker, the Stop Student Debt 
Relief Scams Act is bipartisan legisla-
tion that holds third-party debt collec-
tion scammers accountable for their 
predatory schemes to line their pock-
ets at the expense of hardworking fam-
ilies. 
At a time when Americans are feel-
ing 
the 
financial 
impact 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, this legislation 
is even more important and is a com-
monsense measure to prevent bor-
rowers from falling victim to these 
scams. 
Today’s 
legislation 
will 
help 
strengthen the tools Federal and State 
officials need to combat these bad ac-
tors while also educating student loan 
borrowers. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
He is called the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania, but some of us also call 
him the gentleman from Lancaster. 
I truly want to thank my colleague 
on the other side of the aisle, Mr. 
SMUCKER, for his leadership on this 
critical piece of bipartisan legislation 
to stand up for hardworking Ameri-
cans, to stand up for our students, and 
to put into place a clarified law declar-
ing that it is a Federal crime to access 
U.S. Department of Education informa-
tion technology systems for purposes 
of fraud, commercial advantage, or pri-
vate financial gain, and that fines 
these scammers up to $20,000, or up to 
5 years of imprisonment, as my col-
league so nicely articulated. 
This is an attempt today to shut 
down predatory scammers who are tar-
geting our student borrowers, for the 
financial health of the American peo-
ple. 
Again, I strongly encourage my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
join us here today in passing this crit-
ical piece of legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Judiciary, Homeland, and 
Budget Committees, I rise in strong support of 
S. 1153, the ‘‘Stop Student Debt Relief Scams 
Act,’’ which helps protect borrowers from de-
ceptive student debt relief scams by enhanc-
ing law enforcement and administrative abili-
ties to identify and shut down such student 
debt relief scams. 
With ordinary Americans facing nearly $1.5 
trillion in student loan debt, borrowers are 
looking for relief wherever they can find it but 
unfortunately many borrowers do not receive 
the right information about how to find out and 
qualify for opportunities to get help with low-
ering or postponing their payments or applying 
for relief, nearly all of which is available for 
free. 
These include income-driven repayment, 
deferment, forbearance, consolidation, reha-
bilitation, and even some programs for loan 
forgiveness. 
Debt relief scams falsely promise borrowers 
a quick fix with little hassle and their business 
model is to robocall student loan borrowers 
until they agree to pay thousands of dollars in 
unnecessary and exorbitant fees for services 
that are already available for free. 
They claim to reduce or forgive borrowers’ 
student debt and take care of all the paper-
work. 
Some even purport to be associated with 
the federal government. 
Most victims of these deceptive debt relief 
scams are not only defrauded by the compa-
nies that promised to help them, but unknow-
ingly become delinquent on their payments 
and default on their loans, miss communica-
tions with their servicers, and fall even deeper 
into debt. 
S. 1153, the Stop Student Debt Relief 
Scams Act of 2019 would accelerate the end 
to this rampant misconduct. 
Specifically, the Stop Student Debt Relief 
Scams Act of 2019 will enhance law enforce-
ment and administrative abilities to identify 
and shut down student debt relief scams by: 
Clarifying that it is a federal crime to access 
U.S. Department of Education information 
technology systems for fraud, commercial ad-
vantage, or private financial gain, and fines 
scammers up to $20,000, up to 5 years im-
prisonment, or both, for violations of the law; 
Directing the U.S. Department of Education 
to create a new form of third-party access, 
akin to the current ‘‘preparer’’ function on the 
Free Application for Student Aid (FAFSA) for 
those applying on behalf of a student and their 
family, in order to protect legitimate organiza-
tions—such as legal aid groups—that help 
borrowers navigate repayment; 
Requiring the U.S. Department of Education 
to maintain commonsense reporting, detection, 
and prevention activities to stop potential or 
known debt relief scams; and 
Requiring student loan exit counseling to 
warn federal loan borrowers about debt relief

RESTORING A ROBUST RURAL 
ECONOMY 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to enthu-
siastically support the Growing Oppor-
tunities in Agriculture Act, or the GO 
Ag Act. The GO Ag Act combines two 
of my passions: agriculture and career 
technical education. 
The GO Ag Act would make $5 mil-
lion available through the Perkins Act 
to help schools launch agricultural 
education programs, including FFA 
chapters. Students learn about the ag-
ricultural industry and how it inter-
sects with math, science, and tech-
nology. 
Restoring a robust rural economy de-
pends largely upon appealing to the 
next generation. Investing in education 
is perhaps the most commonsense way 
to prepare individuals who are pas-
sionate about a career in agriculture 
for the workforce. The GO Ag Act is 
not only an investment in agriculture 
education, but also the future of our 
agricultural supply chain. 
I am proud to cosponsor this legisla-
tion because I believe investing in agri-
culture education is an important step 
in bolstering rural economies and 
strengthening rural communities.

RECOGNIZING THE 79TH ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
THE 
ATTACK 
ON 
PEARL HARBOR 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 79th anni-
versary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. 
I recently had the opportunity to visit 
with a constituent of mine from Pasco 
County, Florida, Mr. Wigmore, on his 
100th birthday. Mr. Wigmore is a Pearl 
Harbor survivor, and I appreciate his 
heroism. 
While there are very few Pearl Har-
bor survivors remaining throughout 
our Nation, unfortunately, we must 
never forget their bravery, service, and 
sacrifice. 
On the morning of December 7, 1941, 
Japan launched a sneak attack on the 
U.S. Pacific Fleet’s base at Pearl Har-
bor in Hawaii. Tragically, the attack 
killed 
2,403 
American 
servicemem-
bers—heroes, Mr. Speaker—and wound-
ed almost 1,200 more. Despite inflicting 
heavy casualties, the attackers failed 
to achieve their objective of disabling 
the U.S. fleet. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that we all re-
member the lives lost on that day and 
celebrate the remarkable contributions 
that the Greatest Generation made for 
all of us. 
f 
REMEMBERING 
THE 
79TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ATTACK ON 
PEARL HARBOR 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, at 7:48 
a.m. on December 7, 1941, the Empire of 
Japan deliberately attacked the United 
States—a sneak attack—at our naval 
station at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. 
This surprise attack was meant to 
cripple the United States Pacific Fleet 
before we had the chance to do any-
thing about World War II. Rather than 
facing defeat, the American people— 
our soldiers, our military, all of us— 
fought back. 
In the end, it was the determined 
spirit of the American military and the 
commitment of Americans to innovate 
and use all of our materials to produce 
wartime products that ultimately led 
to an Allied victory. 
Just a few short months later, on 
April 18, 1942, America struck back 
with the Jimmy Doolittle Raiders tell-
ing the islands of Japan that we are 
here and we are not going away. They 
were heroes there as well. 
Mr. Speaker, 79 years later we honor 
the 2,403 servicemembers and civilians 
who were killed that day—a day which 
President Roosevelt said was a date 
which will live in infamy. We owe them 
a huge amount of gratitude, and we 
also need to remember that our own 
military readiness needs to be on con-
stant alert and that we need to do ev-
erything we can today to make sure 
that we as Americans are ready for any 
threat. 
f 
COVID VACCINES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
there are 14.8 million cases of COVID– 
19, now some 282,000 deaths. In the 
State of Texas, there are 1.3 million, an 
increase of 10,000 cases and 23,000-plus 
deaths. The numbers keep going up. 
The scientists predict that we may 
have as many as 500,000 deaths by 
March 2021. 
There has to be a national protocol of 
wearing masks, socially distancing, 
and washing your hands. But as we 
begin to do the vaccines, there must be 
a public understanding of, one, the 
safety of those vaccines; but, number 
two, the vaccines should be distributed 
in our small and local hospitals that 
our communities are familiar with 
along with local health facilities. 
We will be working to ensure that 
populations—people of color and indig-
enous people who are impacted—have 
access to vaccines where they are fa-
miliar with medical professionals. That 
should be the route of the United 
States Congress and pass the COVID–19 
package not next week, but this week. 
Our constituents are desperate.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
HENDERSON 
COUNTY 
SUPER-
INTENDENT 
MARGANNA 
STAN-
LEY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. COX 
of California). Under the Speaker’s an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. COMER) 
is recognized for 60 minutes as the des-
ignee of the minority leader. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to spend the next 30 or so minutes dis-
cussing some various topics and recog-
nizing a few people in my congressional 
district for various things. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Marganna Stanley of Henderson Coun-
ty on her retirement after 30 years as 
an educator, including serving the last 
6 years as superintendent of Henderson 
County Schools. 
Ms. Stanley has lived out her child-
hood dream of teaching and has main-
tained an unwavering love for edu-
cation throughout her career. Through 
the years, she has worked in various 
roles in the Henderson County school 
system, including serving as a class-
room teacher in the district office, as a 
principal, and eventually as super-
intendent. 
Although the roles have changed, her 
passion for educating students has not. 
Even when she wasn’t in the classroom 
every day, she would regularly show up 
to read to classrooms and find other 
ways to maintain a close connection 
with students. 
I am honored to congratulate Ms. 
Stanley on a successful tenure as an 
educator in my congressional district. I 
know that she has left a positive im-
pact on the lives of numerous young 
people over the past 30 years, and I 
wish her nothing but the best in her re-
tirement. 
HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF JUDGE TIMOTHY 
STARK 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor Judge Timothy Stark of Graves 
County on his upcoming retirement 
after 16 years of distinguished service 
as circuit court judge. 
A lifelong Graves County native, 
Judge Stark is well-respected in his 
community and has a knowledge of the 
law that is second to none. He has led 
on issues of extreme importance, in-
cluding introducing a drug court pro-
gram which has helped countless indi-
viduals get their lives back on track. 
Over the years, he has served as a men-
tor to many young people in the legal 
profession, including my chief of staff, 
Caroline Cash. 
There is no doubt that Judge Stark’s 
leadership in the judicial arena will be 
missed. I salute him for his years of 
service and wish him nothing but the 
best in a well-earned retirement. 
RECOGNIZING CURTIS HANCOCK 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great respect and honor that I rise to 
recognize my dear friend, Curtis Han-
cock, on his retirement from the Farm 
Credit Council Board of Directors and 
his many contributions to Kentucky 
agriculture. Curtis Hancock is a life-
long farmer and, today, owns and oper-
ates Hancock Family Farms growing 
corn, wheat, and soybeans in Fulton, 
Kentucky. 
Throughout his career, Curtis has 
shown great support for agriculture 
through leadership positions across the 
industry, and I have had the pleasure 
of seeing firsthand his tireless advo-
cacy for farmers and ranchers. 
Curtis’ leadership and contributions 
to 
Kentucky 
agriculture 
are 
un-
matched, including as a former board 
member of Kentucky Small Grain 
Growers’ Association, a former member 
of Hickman County Farm Bureau, the 
local Southern States Cooperative, and 
the Hickman County Farm Service 
Agency. 
Curtis has also been an advocate for 
Kentucky farmers within the Farm 
Credit System. Curtis was a longtime 
director and past board chair at River 
Valley AgCredit in Mayfield, Ken-
tucky, 
which 
supports 
farmers 
throughout my district. He also serves 
on the board and is past chair at 
AgFirst Farm Credit Bank, which sup-
ports farmers in rural communities 
throughout the Southeast. Since 2003, 
Curtis has served on the Farm Credit 
Council Board of Directors, including 2 
years as chair of the national organiza-
tion. 
Curtis received a bachelor of science 
degree in agriculture from the Univer-
sity of Tennessee-Martin and a master

of science degree in agriculture eco-
nomics from the University of Ten-
nessee. Despite that, Curtis remains a 
very loyal fan of the University of Ken-
tucky Wildcats. 
On behalf of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and the citizens of Ken-
tucky’s First Congressional District, I 
ask my colleagues to join me in con-
gratulating Curtis on his retirement 
and thank him for his many years of 
honorable service to the farmers and 
ranchers of Kentucky. 
Kentucky 
farmers 
and 
American 
farmers are better off today as a result 
of Curtis Hancock’s long service on 
their behalf. I wish Curtis and his wife, 
Mary Elizabeth, the very best in the 
years to come. 
HONORING THE NEW CHAIR OF PADUCAH AIRPORT 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jay Matheny for being 
elected chairman of the Barkley Re-
gional Airport Authority Board. 
Mr. Matheny will oversee the ongo-
ing construction work for the new ter-
minal for the airport, which he has al-
ready been closely involved with. The 
project has been called the airport for 
our future, and I believe that Mr. 
Matheny is the right person to see this 
project through to its scheduled com-
pletion in 2023. 
Due to west Kentucky’s proximity to 
the other major airports of St. Louis, 
Louisville, and Nashville, this terminal 
will attract more flights and bring nu-
merous economic opportunities to the 
region. I am proud of the multiple enti-
ties that have worked together from 
the city, State, and Federal levels to 
get this project underway. 
Congratulations, once again, to Mr. 
Matheny for being chosen as chairman. 
I look forward to the completion of 
this airport terminal and the economic 
growth it will provide for Paducah and 
west Kentucky.

HONORING GARY JONES OF MUHLENBERG COUNTY 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
honor Gary Jones of Muhlenberg Coun-
ty on his extraordinary tenure as the 
director of the Muhlenberg Alliance for 
Progress. 
Gary will be retiring at the end of 
the month after 8 years of leadership 
with the Alliance for Progress where he 
has aggressively prioritized economic 
development in Western Kentucky. In 
this role, he has worked tirelessly to 
attract jobs to Muhlenberg County and 
empower job creators in the region. 
A fellow graduate of my alma mater 
of Western Kentucky University, his 
46-year career has spanned across roles 
in education, the coal industry, local 
government, and the Federal Govern-
ment. 
These diverse work experiences have 
made him keenly aware of the eco-
nomic deeds facing rural communities. 
His ability to develop relationships 
with community and industry leaders 
has also been instrumental to his job- 
attraction efforts. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Gary for his 
sincere efforts to improve economic de-
velopment and wish him nothing but 
the best in a well-deserved retirement. 
KENTUCKY’S ECONOMIC FAILURES AND 
LOCKDOWNS 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
bring attention to Kentucky’s avoid-
able economic failures during this very 
serious 
pandemic. 
Unfortunately, 
COVID–19 has taken a harsh toll on the 
economies of all 50 States. However, 
harmful policies from Democrat-run 
States have only made the problem 
worse. At a time when we should be en-
couraging the safe reopening of our 
economy, 
Kentucky’s 
Governor 
re-
cently issued an order shutting down 
schools and indoor dining. 
Kentucky’s restaurants were already 
suffering from the last round of shut-
downs, and this short-sighted order 
will only cause more pain and suf-
fering. 
To make matters worse, our Gov-
ernor is producing no data to justify 
the need to shut down businesses which 
have dramatically adjusted to the chal-
lenges presented by COVID–19. And the 
end of in-person learning will only cre-
ate more challenges for students and 
teachers. Furthermore, it flies in the 
face of CDC recommendations that the 
safest place for our children is in 
school. 
Unfortunately, small business owners 
are not the only ones negatively af-
fected by these lockdowns. Workers 
have been put out of a job through no 
fault of their own. And to make mat-
ters worse, Kentucky’s State govern-
ment has proven itself too incompetent 
to distribute unemployment payments 
in a timely manner. 
Right now, Kentucky has the second 
highest 
unemployment 
backlog 
in 
America, with just 20 percent of bene-
fits going out 3 weeks after a claim is 
made. That is unacceptable. Our sur-
rounding States of Indiana and Ten-
nessee are more than doubling that 
number, getting 60 percent of payments 
out after 3 weeks. If a politician single- 
handedly puts people out of work, the 
least they can do is process their un-
employment claims in a timely man-
ner. 
Kentucky families are struggling 
from these lockdowns and, unfortu-
nately, finding little help from their 
State government in Frankfort. The 
livelihoods of working families and job 
creators have been cast aside by power- 
hungry politicians and it is delaying 
our economic recovery. We must do 
better. We must safely reopen the econ-
omy and support our small businesses 
and workers. 
Mr. Speaker, with a vaccine on the 
horizon, the best thing we can do for 
our economy is to safely reopen. Fur-
ther shutdowns are doing nothing but 
digging a further hole for our economy 
to get out of. In Kentucky, we can do 
better. 
OVERSIGHT AND REFORM REPUBLICAN 
INVESTIGATION 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
talk about the ongoing investigation 
within the House Committee on Over-
sight and Reform among oversight Re-
publicans. 
The 
minority—the 
Republicans— 
have requested several hearings, but 
unfortunately, Chairwoman MALONEY 
and the majority House Democrats are 
uninterested or unwilling to comply. 
So we have taken it upon ourselves to 
inquire and pretty much open up inves-
tigations with our staff, with our in-
vestigators, and have taken data from 
our whistleblowers and different stake-
holders with each investigation. 
We currently have caught a situation 
before 
the 
election, 
in 
California, 
where—with the CARES Act—there 
was a part called the Help America 
Vote Act that allocated funds for dif-
ferent States to educate voters on how 
to vote. In other words, to educate vot-
ers on where their precincts are and 
how to fill out an absentee ballot— 
things that are perfectly legal and 
things that the Federal Government 
should fund, and the State government 
should administer. 
Mr. Speaker, within the rules—some-
thing that a lot of times my friends on 
the other side of the aisle don’t think 
apply to themselves—but in the rules 
of the Help America Vote Act, it spe-
cifically says what those Federal funds 
can and cannot be used for. One of the 
things that it specifically says the Fed-
eral funds cannot be used for is to get 
out the vote efforts. 
But in California, which was awarded 
$35 million in the CARES Act of Help 
America Vote Act funds, their Sec-
retary of State Padilla took the $35 
million. The normal process would be 
to advertise bids for a contract, but 
Secretary Padilla did what a lot of 
Democrat secretaries of state—and un-
fortunately, some Republican secre-
taries of state did—they said, Oh, there 
is a pandemic. We can’t do this the nor-
mal way. We have to do it a special 
way. 
So he awarded this contract with no 
bid. There were plenty of vendors that 
were interested in bidding on that con-
tract but he awarded it to one. And in 
the Help America Vote Act it specifi-
cally says that vendors can’t be par-
tisan. That is common sense, right? 
This contract that he awarded, a $35 
million of our Federal taxpayer funds 
in a no-bid process, the firm that re-
ceived 
that 
contract 
was 
called 
SKDKnickerbocker. I invite you right 
now to get your phone out and put in 
‘‘SKDKnickerbocker,’’ 
and 
look 
at 
their website. 
It will pop up, and what you will see 
is a picture of Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS shaking hands. And it proudly 
says—on the very top of the website— 
‘‘We want to congratulate our clients, 
Joe Biden and KAMALA
HARRIS, for 
changing America, and for winning.’’ 
So this firm, SKDKnickerbocker was 
clearly a partisan firm. This firm rep-
resented the Biden campaign. 
Now, my question to anyone inter-
ested in this—and I think most tax-
payers would be interested in this—ob-
viously, the House Democrats on the

December 7, 2020 
Committee on Oversight and Reform 
are uninterested in this, but if the sec-
retary of state awards a no-bid con-
tract to a Joe Biden partisan firm to 
get out to vote, do you really think 
they are going to target Republican 
voters, or do you think they are going 
to target Democrat voters? That is ille-
gal. 
Mr. Speaker, we have sent letters to 
Secretary Padilla asking him what his 
intentions were and why he did not fol-
low the law on this contract. He has 
not replied. I have made this public. I 
went on the Tucker Carlson Show a few 
months ago and brought this to the Na-
tion’s attention. As a result of this, 
and our messaging and our inquiries, 
the media in California has been writ-
ing about this. 
The Sacramento Bee wrote just this 
past week that the California comp-
troller has refused to pay the $35 mil-
lion bill to SKDKnickerbocker because 
they know there is a problem with this 
no-bid contract awarded to a partisan 
firm that was Joe Biden’s main digital 
firm to microtarget certain voters in 
California. 
Mr. Speaker, what I am asking for 
now is for the comptroller of California 
to just go ahead and do the right thing 
and send that $35 million back to the 
Treasury. We don’t want taxpayer dol-
lars being spent on improper, illegal, 
unethical, and partisan instances. And 
that is what happened in California. 
Now, another reason this isn’t going 
to go away—I am not an expert on 
California politics—but while I was 
waiting for my time to speak, I read 
several things that said Secretary of 
State Padilla is the frontrunner to fill 
KAMALA HARRIS’ seat for the U.S. Sen-
ate. I strongly encourage the secretary 
of state to answer House Republicans’ 
inquiries on this issue, because if he 
doesn’t answer it now and he does, in 
fact, get confirmed to the U.S. Senate, 
he is probably going to have to answer 
it in front of the Senate Committee on 
Ethics. 
Now, one thing that I pledged to do 
when I became ranking member of the 
House Committee on Oversight and Re-
form is, we weren’t just going to iden-
tify problems. We were going to try to 
represent 
the 
taxpayers, 
and 
we 
weren’t just going to identify instances 
of waste, fraud and abuse, like this $35 
million no-bid contract in California. 
We were going to try to claw back that 
money—get the money back. It seems 
like forever in Congress, Members of 
Congress do the right thing and they 
identify wrongful spending, but noth-
ing ever happens. No one is ever held 
accountable. Certainly, the taxpayers 
never get their money back. This is an 
instance we are not going to let up. 
Mr. Speaker, we are operating in a 
huge deficit. We have to be accountable 
for the taxpayers. That is the job of 
this Congress. The Committee on Over-
sight and Reform is serious. The Re-
publicans on the Committee on Over-
sight and Reform are going in a new di-
rection. Not only are we going to iden-
tify problems, but we are going to try 
to solve problems because we are going 
to get the backs of the American tax-
payer. 
And I think I have clearly spelled out 
the problems with this contract. And I 
believe that the fact that the comp-
troller in California isn’t willing to 
write that check for the bill, that 
proves that there was a problem there. 
If anything I have said today is incor-
rect, then I welcome Secretary Padilla 
to answer our inquiry. And if anything 
I have said that was not right, I will 
apologize to the secretary of state for 
that. But clearly, sitting there not re-
sponding, is not helping the situation 
and, again, it is not going to go away. 
Mr. Speaker, now another thing with 
this contract, I have spelled out the 
problem that the State of California, 
the secretary of state has with this $35 
million no-bid contract. The next part 
of the problem with this particular in-
vestigation is our committee has sent 
numerous letters to a government 
agency that a lot of people probably 
never heard of, called the Election As-
sistance Commission. 
The Election Assistance Commission 
is a government agency, bureaucracy, 
entity—whatever you want to call it— 
that is supposed to be the watchdog for 
Federal funding pertaining to elec-
tions. They have an inspector general. 
I have written—and on those letters, 
they were signed by my colleague on 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, JODY HICE of Georgia, and the 
ranking member of the House Adminis-
tration Committee, RODNEY DAVIS of 
Illinois—we have jointly written let-
ters to the Inspector General of the 
Election Assistance Commission for 
the Inspector General to investigate 
this $35 million contract. We wrote 
these letters weeks in advance of the 
November elections. And we have got-
ten back form letters, kind of like form 
letters that we send out to people that 
call our office every day and ask for 
things that we are probably not going 
to be able to do. We always reply with 
nice form letters. That is what the 
ranking members of the House Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform and 
the House Administration Committee 
got. 
If the Election Assistance Commis-
sion can’t investigate this one thing in 
this election—and I am not even going 
to get into a debate today about 
whether there were irregularities or 
not. That is not what I am discussing 
today. I am discussing a specific irreg-
ularity that involved taxpayer dollars. 
b 1615 
If the Election Assistance Commis-
sion inspector general cannot inves-
tigate that and come up with an an-
swer and say, ‘‘Okay, the Secretary the 
State was right,’’ or, ‘‘Okay, you were 
right, and the money should be re-
turned,’’ if they can’t get us an answer 
on that, then the next step we are 
going to suggest, as Republican mem-
bers of the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform, will be to eliminate the 
Election Assistance Commission. 
If you can’t take an inquiry from 
Congress and investigate it, especially 
when the media in California—not ex-
actly a bastion of Republican support— 
when they are calling the Secretary of 
State out on this contract, then I think 
we have a problem with this govern-
ment agency. 
Government is too big. I have been in 
Washington 4 years now. There are a 
lot of buildings in this city with a lot 
of government employees, a lot of gov-
ernment programs. Honestly, in my 
opinion, we don’t have the ability to 
continue to fund all of these govern-
ment programs, all of these govern-
ment agencies, and all of these govern-
ment employees. If we can find govern-
ment agencies that refuse to do their 
jobs, then we should eliminate those 
government agencies. 
So, my remarks today are specifi-
cally about the contract in California 
with the Secretary of State, the con-
tract for the Help America Vote Act, 
which was in the CARES Act, which 
was a no-bid contract to a partisan 
firm to do illegal things, like microtar-
get voters. That is my first complaint, 
the $35 million. 
My second complaint is the Election 
Assistance Commission. With the one 
request that we made, I have been very 
unimpressed, disappointed, shocked, to 
the point now I am angered. Now, as a 
taxpayer and someone who wants to 
get the back of the taxpayer, I think it 
is time to look at this agency and say: 
Is this something that we need moving 
forward? 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to conclude 
my remarks, again, with reference to 
the Committee on Oversight and Re-
form. As a member of the committee 
for the past 4 years, I have heard a lot 
of Democrats complain about the 2016 
election, imply that there were irreg-
ularities in the election. I have heard 
my friend DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
complain, probably rightfully so, about 
the emails being hacked at the Demo-
cratic National Committee. We have 
had discussions about that. 
I know that when Elijah Cummings 
became chairman of the committee, 
the first witness he had was Michael 
Cohen to talk about irregularities in 
the 2016 election that he saw from the 
Trump campaign and things like that. 
We had those committee hearings, and 
we have had a lot of those committee 
hearings. 
Here we are today, several weeks 
after the Presidential election. Regard-
less of your opinion of the election, re-
gardless of your opinion of the rightful 
winner, regardless of your opinion of 
whether there were major irregular-
ities or not, there are a lot of Ameri-
cans who have a lot of questions about 
the election process. 
There were a lot of things in this 
election that were unique, not just the 
absentee voting process where the rules 
were changed in the middle of the 
game, but also the number of people 
who voted by mail and voted absentee.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6888 
December 7, 2020 
I feel like the American people de-
serve one committee in this Chamber 
to step up and hold a hearing and hear 
both sides. If I were Chairwoman MALO-
NEY or JAMIE RASKIN or GERRY CON-
NOLLY or Mr. CLAY, or anybody on the 
committee who hears this request, if I 
believed there weren’t any irregular-
ities, I would want to have a hearing to 
make the Republicans look bad. I am 
disappointed that we are not doing our 
job in the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform. 
But with the specific investigation 
that Republicans have done in Cali-
fornia, without any help from the 
Democrats—we don’t need their help. 
We don’t need their help on this. We 
have already proven it. The comp-
troller in California knows it. We are 
now asking to send the money back. 
If you are not going to explain, Sec-
retary Padilla, if you don’t want to 
talk about it, that is fine. Send the 
money back, and taxpayers will move 
on. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

END PUNISHMENT CLAUSE IN 13TH 
AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Mis-
souri (Mr. CLAY) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. CLAY. Mr. Speaker, I wanted to 
share with the House that I am really 
reserving 
the 
time 
for 
Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD from North Carolina, but 
I will begin. I want to thank my col-
league, Mr. BUTTERFIELD, for leading 
this Special Order hour this evening. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation was founded 
on principles of liberty and justice for 
some, but not for all. In fact, it took 89 
years after the Declaration of Inde-
pendence and a brutal Civil War to fi-
nally end most forms of slavery. 
The 13th Amendment to the U.S. 
Constitution was ratified on December 
6, 1865, ending slavery but preserving 
involuntary servitude for some incar-
cerated persons. 
After 
a 
raging 
debate, 
former 
slaveholders in the Southern States 
held enough influence to preserve the 
practice and were able to include a 
loophole in the 13th Amendment to 
continue to allow slavery as punish-
ment for a crime. 
Over the next 155 years, that punish-
ment clause was used as a club to over-
incarcerate 
African 
Americans 
and 
other minorities for profit and in com-
plete violation of their human dignity. 
Black Americans were immediately 
targeted and arrested by law enforce-
ment for minor infractions, and the 
practice of forced prison labor began 
and still persists to this day. 
That is why I, joined by Senator JEFF 
MERKLEY from Oregon, introduced leg-
islation to amend the Constitution to 
clarify that neither slavery nor invol-
untary servitude may be used as pun-
ishment for a crime. 
I am pleased that many of my col-
leagues, including Congressman CEDRIC 
RICHMOND, incoming Assistant Speaker 
Congresswoman KATHERINE CLARK, and 
many of my colleagues in the CBC and 
broader Tri-Caucus, have also taken a 
leadership role on this issue in legisla-
tion. 
Confronting and rooting out the sys-
temic racism that is still rampant in 
many facets of American life requires 
us to examine the painful truth in 
order to fix it. It is an indisputable his-
torical fact that many local and State 
law enforcement practices in this coun-
try grew out of the legacy of racism 
and slavery. 
As millions of Americans are de-
manding criminal justice reform and a 
change in the training and culture of 
policing, passage of this constitutional 
amendment would send a clear signal: 
Bigotry and profits will no longer be 
used to deny any person their dignity. 
Our criminal justice system and laws 
cannot be fully respected until we end 
this injustice that allows dispropor-
tionate numbers of Black and Brown 
people to be imprisoned and enslaved. 
As I retire from Congress next 
month, I urge my colleagues to make 
passage of this legislation an urgent 
national priority. America cannot heal 
and move forward until we have real 
equality for all instead of just for 
some. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNIZING 155TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF 13TH AMENDMENT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD) is recog-
nized for the remainder of the hour as 
the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as she may consume to 
the gentlewoman from California (Ms. 
BASS), the distinguished chair of the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
commemorate the 155th anniversary of 
the ratification of the 13th Amend-
ment. 
On 
December 
18, 
1865, 
the 
13th 
Amendment 
was 
ratified, 
officially 
ending more than 256 years of enslave-
ment in the United States for nearly 4 
million enslaved African Americans. 
The 13th Amendment provides that: 
‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary ser-
vitude, except as a punishment for 
crime whereof the party shall have 
been duly convicted, shall exist within 
the United States, or any place subject 
to their jurisdiction.’’ 
After the Civil War, the 13th Amend-
ment was the first of three reconstruc-
tion amendments adopted. The loop-
hole sentence, however, ‘‘except as a 
punishment for crime,’’ allowed for Af-
rican Americans to continue cruel, in-
voluntary labor under what is known 
as the Black Codes. 
To be enslaved, specific laws were 
passed to ensure that African Ameri-
cans would be constantly arrested, and 
then 
the 
government 
would 
lease 
human beings out. As African Ameri-
cans continued to be viewed as prop-
erty, the government leased people out 
to businesses, farms, and other types of 
profit-making ventures. 
I would like to acknowledge the 
former 
chair 
of 
the 
Congressional 
Black Caucus, and the CBC’s resident 
historian, to lead this Special Order 
hour acknowledging this very impor-
tant anniversary. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Congresswoman BASS very much 
for those very kind words, and I thank 
her for her friendship and for her lead-
ership over the last 2 years as she has 
led the 55 men and women of the Con-
gressional Black Caucus. I certainly 
know from past experience that it is a 
daunting challenge to lead such a cau-
cus. But I thank her so much for her 
leadership, and I look forward to the 
future leadership of our new chair, 
Congresswoman JOYCE BEATTY. 
Today, the Congressional Black Cau-
cus is convening to present a Special 
Order, recognizing the 155th anniver-
sary of the ratification of the 13th 
Amendment. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers will have 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks on this 
Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from North Carolina? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
have said for years that the passage 
and ratification of the 13th Amend-
ment is one of the most significant 
pieces of legislation ever considered by 
this body. Had Congress and the States 
failed to eliminate the despicable insti-
tution of slavery, the American experi-
ment would have failed and failed mis-
erably. 
This afternoon, the Congressional 
Black Caucus lifts up this American 
history for the American people to see 
and understand. 
In the year 1860, the Republican can-
didate for President was Abraham Lin-
coln. Three candidates opposed Lin-
coln: Stephen Douglas from Illinois, 
representing the Northern wing of the 
Democratic Party; John Breckinridge 
from 
Kentucky, 
representing 
the 
Southern 
wing 
of 
the 
Democratic 
Party; and John Bell from Tennessee, 
representing the Constitutional Union 
Party. 
During this election, Mr. Speaker, 
the Southern States, the slaveholding 
Southern States, were very fearful 
that, 
if 
elected, 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
would find a way to end slavery and de-
prive them of their slaves. 
Over a period of 240 years, southern 
plantation owners had purchased Afri-
can citizens who had been transshipped 
to the United States from the con-
tinent of Africa. 
b 1630 
The original Constitution, which was 
effective March 4, 1789, addressed the 
issue of slavery. It contained a provi-
sion that would maintain the slave 
trade for at least 20 years after the 
ratification of the Constitution, until 
January 1, 1809. Though the legal end 
of the slave trade occurred in 1809, 
slave trafficking continued, to be sure. 
Slave women were impregnated by 
males of both races and encouraged to 
bear large numbers of children. By 1860, 
Mr. Speaker, there were nearly 4 mil-
lion slaves in the United States, most-
ly in Southern States. The border 
States of Delaware, Kentucky, Mary-
land, Missouri, and West Virginia also 
had a large number of slaves. 
On November 6, 1860, Mr. Speaker, it 
was the Presidential election. The 
American voters spoke, and did they 
speak loudly. Abraham Lincoln became 
the 16th President of the United States 
of America, winning a very large num-
ber of electoral votes. 
Immediately following his election, 
Southern States, 11 Southern States 
began seceding from the Union, and 
that is the map I have here to my left. 
The first State to secede was South 
Carolina, right away, on December 20; 
Mississippi, January 9; followed by 
Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, 
and Texas. 
Then after those seven States had se-
ceded from the Union, Abraham Lin-
coln takes the oath of office and be-
comes the 16th President of the United 
States. The oath of office took place on 
March 3. Today, as we all know, it is 
January 20, but during those times it 
was March 3. 
After Lincoln was installed and inau-
gurated as President, four more States 
seceded from the Union. They were Vir-
ginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and 
Tennessee. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, the United States 
is faced with a constitutional crisis of 
monumental 
proportions. 
Eleven 
States, these 11 Southern States, are 
now considering themselves a separate 
nation. They refer to themselves as the 
Confederate States of America. 
The 
so-called 
Confederate 
States 
were formally created on March 11, a 
mere 8 days following Lincoln’s inau-
guration. The Confederate States of 
America adopted a constitution. They 
created a currency, elected its political 
leaders, stood up a military, adopted a 
flag, and attempted to do everything a 
developing nation would do. 
Great tension now existed between 
the 23 Union States and the 11 Confed-
erate States. So, Mr. Speaker, we all 
know what happened then. On April 12, 
1861, at 4:30 in the morning, Confed-
erate soldiers opened fired upon Union 
soldiers at Fort Sumter, South Caro-
lina, in the city of Charleston, and the 
Civil War begins. 
It was a brutal war. Southern States 
had declared war on the Union. Thou-
sands of soldiers lost their lives on 
both sides of the battle lines. 
President Lincoln, Mr. Speaker, be-
came very weary. The war was taking 
its toll on him. It was taking its toll on 
the democracy. So on September 22, 
1862, Lincoln issued what we now know 
as the preliminary Emancipation Proc-
lamation, 
announcing 
that, 
if 
the 
rebels did not end the fighting and re-
join the Union by January 1, 1863, 100 
days later, all slaves in the rebellious 
States would be free. 
On January 1, 1863, Lincoln did what 
he threatened he would do. President 
Lincoln, using his power as Com-
mander in Chief of the military, issued 
an executive order. That order is re-
ferred to as the historic Emancipation 
Proclamation. 
Mr. Speaker, that proclamation is 
often recited, and I will recite it here 
today. 
It reads as follows. This is the Eman-
cipation Proclamation. It says: 
‘‘On the first day of January, in the 
year of our Lord one thousand eight 
hundred sixty-three, all persons held as 
slaves within any State or designated 
part of a State, the people whereof 
shall then be in rebellion against the

United States, shall be then, thence-
forward, and forever free; and the Exec-
utive Government of the United States, 
including the military and the naval 
authority thereof, will recognize and 
maintain the freedom of such persons, 
and will do no act or acts to repress 
such persons, or any of them, in any ef-
forts they may make for their actual 
freedom.’’ 
A very powerful executive order by 
President Lincoln. 
But, Mr. Speaker, Lincoln’s Emanci-
pation Proclamation was monumental. 
It proclaimed that slaves residing in 
the States that were in armed rebellion 
against the Union were free. Union 
military forces descended upon South-
ern States to quiet the rebellion and to 
bring freedom to the slaves. 
But, Mr. Speaker, there was great 
dispute—great 
dispute—among 
the 
legal scholars of that day as to the 
legal effect of the Emancipation Proc-
lamation. 
Lincoln took the position that, as 
Commander in Chief, he possessed the 
authority to enter orders that would 
deprive the enemy of any instruments 
that would aid them in winning the 
war. The slaves were a major asset to 
the slaveholders who were in rebellion. 
So Lincoln took the position that he 
possessed 
the 
power, 
the 
absolute 
power as Commander in Chief, to free 
the slaves. 
But some scholars argued that the 
legal effect of the proclamation was 
doubtful. It was a singular act of the 
President, they said, without congres-
sional approval or popular vote. There 
was some question whether the effect 
of the proclamation would cease at the 
end of the war, some question how the 
Supreme Court would rule if the Presi-
dent’s order was eventually judicially 
reviewed. 
On April 8, 1864, right in the middle 
of the war, Mr. Speaker, just before the 
Presidential 
election, 
the 
United 
States Senate passed a 13th Amend-
ment to the Constitution, and it need-
ed the approval of this body, the House 
of Representatives, for it to become 
law. But House approval was uncertain. 
So, 7 months later, after it had 
passed the Senate, 7 months later, on 
November 8, 1864, Lincoln was then re-
elected. Lincoln was determined now to 
take ownership of this legislation to 
abolish slavery. Lincoln demanded that 
this body, the House of Representa-
tives, pass the legislation that had 
been passed by the Senate. 
Lincoln’s 
election 
platform 
had 
promised that slavery would be abol-
ished 
by 
amendment. 
Lincoln 
de-
manded action. White Northern aboli-
tionists, Black abolitionists, demanded 
action. The war was now at a fever’s 
pitch. Abolition, Mr. Speaker, had to 
happen. 
On January 31, 1865, finally, the 
House of Representatives, this body, fi-
nally took up the question of passage 
of the 13th Amendment. When the vote 
was taken that day, the 13th Amend-
ment passed by a two-vote margin, a 
two-vote margin above the needed two- 
thirds majority. The vote was 119–56. 
History reports, Mr. Speaker, that 
the galleries in this Chamber, the gal-
leries which I see at this moment, the 
galleries were boisterous. There was 
applause. Women and men cried. They 
waived their handkerchiefs as the 
House of Representatives passed the 
13th Amendment. It was a grand, grand 
event. 
Mr. Speaker, in the final vote, all 86 
House Republicans voted in favor of 
the 13th Amendment, along with 15 
Democrats, 14 unconditional Unionists, 
and 4 Union men. The opposition came 
from 50 Democrats and 6 Union men. 
To amend the Constitution, not only 
does an amendment need to pass both 
Houses of Congress, but it must be rati-
fied by three-fourths of the States. 
After the passage by the Senate and 
the House, the ratification process be-
gins. On February 1, 1865, the very, 
very next day, the following day, 
though not required, President Lincoln 
signed the 13th Amendment, beginning 
ratification. It had to be ratified by 27 
States. 
Ratification is now underway. The 
first State, as you can image, Mr. 
Speaker, was Lincoln’s home State of 
Illinois, the very next day, February 1, 
1865, followed by Michigan, Maryland, 
New York, Pennsylvania, West Vir-
ginia, Missouri, Maine, Kansas, Massa-
chusetts, Virginia, Ohio, Indiana, Ne-
vada, Louisiana, Minnesota, Wisconsin, 
Vermont, Tennessee, and Arkansas. 
And later that day, Arkansas, which 
is Mr. DAVIS’ home State—I saw Mr. 
DAVIS walk on the floor a moment ago. 
Arkansas ratified the amendment on 
April 14, 1865. 
And later that day, President Abra-
ham Lincoln was assassinated here in 
Washington, D.C. But ratification con-
tinued, and they had needed six more 
States. 
On May 4, 1865, it was Connecticut, 
followed by New Hampshire, followed 
by South Carolina, followed by Ala-
bama and then my home State of 
North Carolina on December 4, 1865. 
And then, finally, Mr. Speaker, on De-
cember 6 of 1865, the final State of 
Georgia ratified the 13th Amendment. 
When the State of Georgia ratified 
the 13th Amendment on December 6, 
1865, 245 years of slavery legally ended. 
Four million slaves are free. The 
former slaves now begin a long and dif-
ficult period of reconstruction. 
In 1868, the former slaves became 
citizens, with the 14th Amendment. 
They obtained the right to vote in 1870 
under the 15th Amendment. 
In closing, Mr. Speaker, December 6 
is Abolition Day in America, and we 
should observe it and recognize this 
history. As elected Members of Con-
gress, Black and White, Democrat and 
Republican, we must rededicate our-
selves to the complete elimination of 
intentional and systemic racism in 
America. Mr. Speaker, this is our chal-
lenge. 
Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to 
yield to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS). 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, the period during which slav-
ery legally existed represents the most 
horrific and most sordid period in the 
history of the United States; therefore, 
I commend and thank Representative 
G.K. BUTTERFIELD for facilitating and 
anchoring this Special Order high-
lighting the importance and relevance 
and impact of the 13th, 14th, and 15th 
Amendments on changing America. 
Of course, we know that the 13th 
Amendment abolished slavery, the 14th 
Amendment gave Blacks and former 
slaves citizenship, and the 15th Amend-
ment gave newly freed slaves the right 
to vote. 
The period preceding, during, and 
after the Civil War, known as Recon-
struction, is not only one of the most 
sordid, but the most violent and most 
repressive periods in our history. 
The most interesting part of all of 
this, though, is not yesterday. The 
most interesting part is that there are 
individuals and groups in our country 
today who are attempting to take us 
back to that period, and we can never 
let that happen. 
b 1645 
In U.S. News Today, there is an arti-
cle defining how some historians, some 
boards 
of 
education, 
some 
school 
boards have attempted to rewrite and 
teach a history that is very different 
than the real history. 
When you consider the number of in-
dividuals who are part of the mass in-
carceration system who are forced to 
work for nothing and whose rights are 
suspended, that takes us back a ways. 
And when you consider efforts to pre-
vent and make it difficult or basically 
impossible for people to vote, that nul-
lifies the 15th Amendment. 
So you see, Brother BUTTERFIELD, 
when you consider the times that we 
are in, one would have to conclude that 
the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments 
are all under serious attack, and we 
must glory in the fact that we have 
overcome some of the obstacles, but we 
also must be vigilant, vigilant to the 
extent of never going back to that pe-
riod. 
We must be able to say even as a 12- 
year old girl said when she wrote a lit-
tle poem that said: No chains on my 
hands, no chains on my feet, but the 
chains on my mind are keeping me 
from being free. 
So I thank you again for anchoring 
this Special Order, and I thank you for 
reminding us that freedom is a hard- 
won thing. Each generation has to win 
it and win it again. 
Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD. 
Thank 
you, 
Congressman DAVIS, for your pas-
sionate leadership. You will recall, 
Congressman, that 5 years ago, Presi-
dent Obama graced us with his pres-
ence when we celebrated the 150th an-
niversary of the 13th Amendment, and 
your eloquence this afternoon really 
adds to that history. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).

December 7, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
also thank the gentleman for bringing 
us together on such an important mo-
ment, and of course, as he reflected on 
the fact that I think we were together 
just a few years ago in the National Ar-
chives commemorating the importance 
of these amendments, but also the 
Emancipation Proclamation. 
And for those of us in Texas or in 
places past the Mississippi, if I might 
start with the question of freedom, we 
did not get the full impact of freedom 
until 
1865. 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
pro-
claimed the slaves free with his pro-
nouncement in 1863, and then it took 
General Granger 2 years to come and 
present that to those of us west of the 
Mississippi. 
This is why I think this moment on 
the floor of the House, Mr. Speaker and 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD, is a sacred and som-
ber moment. We can declare this a nor-
mal course of business, Mr. MFUME, 
that we are on the floor debating, as we 
usually do, but I really call this a sa-
cred moment because it is a moment to 
educate the American people. It is a 
moment to go full circle, if you will, to 
all of the social justice advocacies that 
we have done, all of the issues that pre-
tended to divide us. 
I think the reason is that, does any-
one understand the legacy of those who 
are descendants of enslaved Africans? 
That we had to wait for an amend-
ment to give us the fullness of a human 
being. We were not counted as human 
beings fully when the Constitution was 
written. 
Just imagine coming from a legacy 
where you were not counted as one, 
you were counted less than one. And 
until this amendment, the idea of slav-
ery of which we had been property, 
counted as property. So I think it is 
important to read the 13th Amend-
ment: ‘‘Neither slavery nor involun-
tary servitude, except as a punishment 
for crime whereof the party shall have 
been fully convicted, shall exist within 
the United States, or any place subject 
to their jurisdiction. Congress shall 
have the power to enforce this article 
by appropriate legislation.’’ 
Think of that. Even indentured serv-
ants had a different status than anyone 
who was a descendent of enslaved Afri-
cans who came to this country in 1619 
and a little bit before. That is what we 
discuss today. That is the issue of the 
13th Amendment. And it is important 
to realize that the Framers never used 
the words slave, shareholder, master, 
or slavery anywhere in the Constitu-
tion. That is almost to say that we had 
no valid space even in a negative con-
notation. 
So to actually realize why this is so 
sacred, let me give you some of his-
tory. By 1861, when the Civil War broke 
out, more than four million people— 
nearly all of them African decent— 
were enslaved in 15 Southern and bor-
der States. By 1862, President Abraham 
Lincoln came to believe firmly that 
emancipating enslaved people in the 
South would help the Union crush the 
Confederate rebellion and win the Civil 
War. We became a practical part of 
saving the Union. We became the cor-
nerstone, the descendents of enslaved 
Africans. 
The question of slavery was not 
based upon the brutality of the separa-
tion of families, the beating that was 
suffered, the sheer brutality of it. No, 
it was not that. I do not find fault for 
that era, but people need to understand 
that it was not because someone bowed 
their heads—they were the abolition-
ists—and said, Oh, how sad it is that 
human beings are being held in bond-
age. We became a calculating force. 
But look at the numbers. Four mil-
lion enslaved. One would wonder why 
this is a sacred moment on the floor of 
the House. 
So Lincoln’s Emancipation Procla-
mation, which took effect in 1863, an-
nounced that all enslaved people held 
in the States—then in rebellion against 
the United States—shall be then there 
forward and forever free. 
But the Emancipation Proclamation 
itself did not end slavery in the United 
States, as it only applied to the 11 Con-
federate States then at war against the 
Union. 
Remember, we became the practical 
cornerstone of trying to end the war, 
to stop the rebellion, and to preserve 
the Union. I am glad the Union was 
preserved. I am glad we are the United 
States of America. 
Yet it is so crucial in the under-
standing of even this year of 2020, even 
understanding the horrors of George 
Floyd’s death, what his family still suf-
fers, and why there was such a rage of 
young people and why the words 
‘‘Black Lives Matter’’ came because of 
the brutality of our history, and here, 
in the 21st century, we are still suf-
fering from the inequities of those that 
did not understand not only the ques-
tion of justice, but also the question of 
the brutality and the history of slav-
ery. 
Maybe there would have been a bet-
ter understanding if a little history 
was woven into where we are today. As 
I indicated, the Emancipation Procla-
mation did not do it because, as it said, 
it did not deal with States like Massa-
chusetts and Ohio, to my under-
standing. It did not deal with those 
States. 
In April 1864, the United States Sen-
ate passed a proposed amendment ban-
ning slavery with the necessary two- 
thirds majority, but it faulted in the 
House of Representatives as more and 
more Democrats refused to support it. 
So it was not an easy journey. 
When Congress reconvened in Decem-
ber 1864, the emboldened Republicans 
put the proposed amendment up for a 
vote again, and Lincoln threw himself 
in the legislative process, something 
that gives leadership and substance to 
the idea of freeing slaves, freeing 
human beings. 
The Constitution now is a stronger 
document because, as he put himself 
into this, Lincoln and his allies see 
what is before you to focus on the most 
important thing that this amendment 
protects the slaves now born and in the 
United States, but also the millions 
yet to be born. He was committed to 
the passage of the 13th Amendment. He 
authorizes allies to entice House mem-
bers with plum positions and other in-
ducements, reportedly telling them: I 
leave it to you to determine how it 
shall be done, but remember that I am 
President of the United States, cloaked 
with immense power, and I expect you 
to procure the votes. 
The whip is on the floor, Mr. CLY-
BURN. I am all the sudden elevated in 
my capacity as a whip because this 
President Lincoln was determined to 
have his agents on the floor use that 
authority to get what needed to be 
done. On January 31, 1865, the House of 
Representatives passed the proposed 
amendment with a vote of 119–56, with 
the required two-thirds majority. 
Mr. Speaker, I started out by saying 
this is a sacred moment. I hope the 
people at home and our colleagues can 
see what slavery represented, the bru-
tality of the back of this slave. It 
didn’t take much to be whipped, 
whipped, and whipped. So scarred, so 
brutalized that you were almost to 
death. Or to see a family so like chat-
tel, so like property, so demeaned. 
Families separated, babies separated. 
Children becoming more valuable than 
mom and dad; dad becoming more valu-
able. 
And I remember reading the Slave 
Narratives, and they said that a woman 
told her slave husband to come home 
quick from where he was working in 
another plantation because they are 
getting ready to sell their children in 
one place and her in another. We need 
you home, she said. 
Who would imagine that human 
beings would have collars around their 
necks, slavery so brutal that it was un-
speakable and could not be heard? 
So today, as we commemorate the 
155th anniversary of this important 
step, realizing that it had to go 
through as an amendment to all of the 
States, what a journey it was. 
I think the words of Sojourner Truth 
are telling, and that is why we fought 
to have her busts, her statue here when 
she was at an abolitionist meeting and 
someone said, Yes, sir, what do you 
want? And she said, Ain’t I a woman? I 
born 13 children and I have seen most 
all of them sold into slavery. 
That is why we are on the floor 
today. We are on the floor today be-
cause 
of 
the 
continued 
misunder-
standing of race in this Nation. 
We are on the floor today because 
more of us need to understand what 
H.R. 40 is all about. It is a magnificent 
piece of legislation that deals with the 
questions of the commission to study 
and develop reparation proposals. It is 
a reflection of the history of African 
Americans in this country. It is a sim-
ple process of getting a commission 
that dignifies what happened to us and

looks for reconciliation and restoration 
and proposal to deal systemically with 
the ongoing disasters that we see in 
our respective communities, from dis-
parities in healthcare, COVID–19, hous-
ing, the criminal justice system, edu-
cation. That is why we stand here 
today. 
So I thank Mr. BUTTERFIELD
for 
yielding, and I thank this body for un-
derstanding this is a sacred moment. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this 
body and the Committee on the Judiciary, I 
am pleased to join my colleagues in this Spe-
cial Order marking the anniversary of the pas-
sage on December 6, 1865 of the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution and cele-
brating the passage of the 14th and 15th 
Amendments, known as the Civil Rights 
Amendments. 
I 
thank 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
BUTTERFIELD, for anchoring this important Spe-
cial Order and am remembering our late col-
league, John Lewis, a great and beloved man, 
who risked and gave his life to make real the 
promise of those amendments. 
The 13th Amendment, the first of the three 
great Civil War Amendments, was passed in 
1865 and abolished slavery. 
The 14th Amendment conferred citizenship 
on the newly emancipated slaves, and the 1st 
Amendment prohibited abridging the right to 
vote on account of race, color, or previous 
condition of servitude. 
Taken together, these amendments were in-
tended and have the effect of making former 
slaves, and their descendants, full and equal 
members of the political community known as 
the United States of America. 
By 1861, when the Civil War broke out, 
more than 4 million people (nearly all of them 
of African descent) were enslaved in 15 south-
ern and border states. 
By 1862, President Abraham Lincoln came 
to believe firmly that emancipating enslaved 
people in the South would help the Union 
crush the Confederate rebellion and win the 
Civil War. 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which 
took effect in 1863, announced that all 
enslaved people held in the states ‘‘then in re-
bellion against the United States, shall be 
then, thenceforward, and forever free.’’ 
But the Emancipation Proclamation itself did 
not end slavery in the United States, as it only 
applied to the 11 Confederate states then at 
war against the Union, and only to the portion 
of those states not already under Union con-
trol. 
To make emancipation permanent would 
take a constitutional amendment abolishing 
the institution of slavery itself. 
In April 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a 
proposed amendment banning slavery with the 
necessary two-thirds majority but it faltered in 
the House of Representatives, as more and 
more Democrats refused to support it. 
When Congress reconvened in December 
1864, the emboldened Republicans put the 
proposed amendment up for vote again and 
Lincoln threw himself in the legislative proc-
ess, inviting individual representatives to his 
office to discuss the amendment and putting 
pressure on border-state Unionists (who had 
previously opposed it) to change their position. 
Lincoln was committed to the passage of 
the 13th Amendment, telling his allies to ‘‘see 
what is before you, to focus on the most im-
portant thing; that this Amendment protects 
the slaves now born and in the United States, 
but settles the question for all time for the mil-
lions yet to be born.’’ 
He authorized his allies to entice House 
members with plum positions and other in-
ducements, reportedly telling them: ‘‘I leave it 
to you to determine how it shall be done; but 
remember that I am President of the United 
States, clothed with immense power, and I ex-
pect you to procure those votes.’’ 
On January 31, 1865, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the proposed amendment 
with a vote of 119–56, just over the required 
two-thirds majority, and the following day, Lin-
coln approved a joint resolution of Congress 
submitting it to the state legislatures for ratifi-
cation. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States is the 
world’s only superpower and boasts the larg-
est economy in the history of the world and for 
many years was the world’s indispensable na-
tion and the example that all aspiring democ-
racies wished to emulate. 
But at the same time, this nation has also 
been home to many searing instances of so-
cial unrest resulting from racial injustices, as 
we witnessed this year on the streets of big 
cities and small towns in urban and rural com-
munities. 
We saw Americans, by the millions across 
the country, coming from all races and ages, 
engaging in what the late John Lewis called 
‘‘good trouble’’ by protesting and demanding 
an end to the systemic racial inequality in our 
criminal justice system that too often victim-
izes and disproportionately treats black Ameri-
cans worse, ceteris paribus, when it comes to 
suspicion, apprehension, arrest, detention, 
trial, sentencing, and incarceration. 
While the brutal deaths of George Floyd in 
Minneapolis and Breanna Taylor in Louisville 
shocked the conscience of the nation, most 
black Americans will tell you what they experi-
enced is not new, but has been occurring for 
generations, if not centuries. 
What is critically important to understand is 
that the instances of brutal and unfair treat-
ment the nation has witnessed this year can-
not be attributed to the proverbial few ‘‘bad 
apples in the bushel’’ but is instead the fore-
seeable consequence of systemic racism and 
racial inequality in the system. 
Not just the criminal justice system, but the 
health care system, the economic system, and 
the educational system to name the most glar-
ing examples. 
To find our way out of this dark time, we 
need to understand how it came to be. 
That is why in January 2019, I introduced 
H.R. 40, which establishes a commission to 
examine slavery and discrimination in the 
colonies and the United States from 1619 to 
the present and recommend appropriate rem-
edies. 
Among other requirements, the commission 
shall identify (1) the role of federal and state 
governments in supporting the institution of 
slavery; (2) forms of discrimination in the pub-
lic and private sectors against freed slaves 
and their descendants; and (3) lingering nega-
tive effects of slavery on living African-Ameri-
cans and society. 
Official slavery ended with the Civil War and 
ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment. 
But unofficial slavery was continued with the 
new institution of sharecrop farming, a criminal 
justice system that would press convicts into 
work once done by slaves, and labor policies 
that dictated income for work done based 
upon skin color. 
And, of course, all of this was reinforced by 
the systematic disenfranchisement of black 
Americans, the ‘‘discrete and insular minority’’ 
excluded from ‘‘those political processes ordi-
narily to be relied upon to protect’’ them, to 
quote Chief Justice Hughes’ famous Carolene 
Products Footnote 4. 
For these reasons, the history of the United 
States is intertwined with the history of 
enslaved Africans in the Americas. 
There is blood and there are tears, but there 
is also redemption and reconciliation. 
But to get there, we must have the complete 
truth and lay our history bare. 
It is the light that sheds the way to the more 
perfect union all Americans want . 
The Commission created and empowered 
by H.R. 40 is a necessary first step in that ef-
fort to get to truth and reconciliation about the 
Original Sin of American Slavery that is nec-
essary to light the way to the beloved commu-
nity we all seek. 
Finally, I join all my colleagues in pointing 
out that the most fitting and proper means of 
paying tribute to the beloved John Lewis’s ex-
traordinary life is for the Senate to immediately 
take up and pass the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, landmark legislation 
to protect the precious right to vote for all per-
sons and to ensure that our democracy has 
the tools needed to remain strong. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of this 
body and the Committee on the Judiciary, I 
am pleased to join my colleagues in this Spe-
cial Order marking the anniversary of the pas-
sage on December 6, 1865 of the 13th 
Amendment to the Constitution and cele-
brating the passage of the 14th and 15th 
Amendments, known as the Civil Rights 
Amendments. 
I 
thank 
my 
colleague, 
Congressman 
BUTTERFIELD, for anchoring this important Spe-
cial Order and am remembering our late col-
league, John Lewis, a great and beloved man, 
who risked and gave his life to make real the 
promise of those amendments. 
The 13th Amendment, the first of the three 
great Civil War Amendments, was passed in 
1865 and abolished slavery. 
The 14th Amendment conferred citizenship 
on the newly emancipated slaves, and the 
15th Amendment prohibited abridging the right 
to vote on account of race, color, or previous 
condition of servitude. 
Taken together, these amendments were in-
tended and have the effect of making former 
slaves, and their descendants, full and equal 
members of the political community known as 
the United States of America. 
Section 2 of the 14th Amendment is note-
worthy because it did two important things. 
First, it repealed Article I, Section 2, which 
counted slaves as 3/5 of a person for pur-
poses of taxation and apportionment of seats 
in the House of Representatives. 
Second, it punished states that denied the 
right to vote to any male citizen over the age 
of 21 (who was neither a felon nor had fought 
on the side of the Confederacy during the Civil 
War) by reducing their population for purposes 
of representation in Congress. 
The Framers knew then, and everyone 
knows now, that the male citizens over the 
age of 21 who were being denied the right to 
vote were the former slaves.

The Framers of the 14th Amendment also 
knew which states were denying these citizens 
the right to vote. 
The Framers could have identified those 
states by name but elected not to do so. 
They chose not to do so because that would 
have required them to despoil the sanctity and 
revolutionary character of the Constitution by 
having to acknowledge explicitly that slavery 
had existed legally in a country founded on 
the ‘‘self-evident truth’’ that ‘‘all men are cre-
ated equal.’’ 
It is for this reason that the Framers never 
used the words ‘‘slave,’’ ‘‘slaveholder,’’ ‘‘mas-
ter,’’ or ‘‘slavery’’ anywhere in the original 
Constitution. 
The single reference in the Amendments is 
the declaration in the 13th Amendment that 
‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, ex-
cept as a punishment for crime whereof the 
party shall have been duly convicted, shall 
exist within the United States, or any place 
subject to their jurisdiction.’’ 
The reason this is important is because it 
shows that when it comes to matters of race 
and politics in America, the Framers and Con-
gress have always been masters of writing in 
code so as not to bruise the feelings or upset 
the tender sensibilities of their fellow citizens 
in the Southern states. 
The Framers and Congress were practiced 
in the art of expressing their true views and 
achieving their objectives without enshrining in 
the Constitution or laws the fact that certain of 
their countrymen trafficked in racism. 
By 1861, when the Civil War broke out, 
more than 4 million people (nearly all of them 
of African descent) were enslaved in 15 south-
ern and border states. 
By 1862, President Abraham Lincoln came 
to believe firmly that emancipating enslaved 
people in the South would help the Union 
crush the Confederate rebellion and win the 
Civil War. 
Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation, which 
took effect in 1863, announced that all 
enslaved people held in the states ‘‘then in re-
bellion against the United States, shall be 
then, thenceforward, and forever free.’’ 
But the Emancipation Proclamation itself did 
not end slavery in the United States, as it only 
applied to the 11 Confederate states then at 
war against the Union, and only to the portion 
of those states not already under Union con-
trol. 
To make emancipation permanent would 
take a constitutional amendment abolishing 
the institution of slavery itself. 
In April 1864, the U.S. Senate passed a 
proposed amendment banning slavery with the 
necessary two-thirds majority but it faltered in 
the House of Representatives, as more and 
more Democrats refused to support it. 
When Congress reconvened in December 
1864, the emboldened Republicans put the 
proposed amendment up for vote again and 
Lincoln threw himself in the legislative proc-
ess, inviting individual representatives to his 
office to discuss the amendment and putting 
pressure on border-state Unionists (who had 
previously opposed it) to change their position. 
Lincoln was committed to the passage of 
the 13th Amendment, telling his allies to ‘‘see 
what is before you, to focus on the most im-
portant thing; that this Amendment protects 
the slaves now born and in the United States, 
but also the millions yet to be born.’’ 
He authorized his allies to entice House 
members with plum positions and other in-
ducements, reportedly telling them: ‘‘I leave it 
to you to determine how it shall be done; but 
remember that I am President of the United 
States, clothed with immense power, and I ex-
pect you to procure those votes.’’ 
On January 31, 1865, the House of Rep-
resentatives passed the proposed amendment 
with a vote of 119–56, just over the required 
two-thirds majority, and the following day, Lin-
coln approved a joint resolution of Congress 
submitting it to the state legislatures for ratifi-
cation. 
Mr. Speaker, let me recite the opening sen-
tence of Section 1 of the 14th Amendment: 
‘‘All persons born or naturalized in the United 
States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, 
are citizens of the United States and of the 
State wherein they reside.’’ 
This text was and is a clear repudiation of 
the infamous Supreme Court’s 1857 decision 
in Dred Scott, in which Chief Justice Roger 
Taney wrote that a black man, was so inferior 
to the white man that he had no rights the 
white man was bound to respect, and could 
never, even if born free, claim rights of citizen-
ship under the federal constitution. 
The next clause in Section 1 states: ‘‘No 
State shall make or enforce any law which 
shall abridge the privileges or immunities of 
citizens of the United States.’’ 
This greatly expanded the civil and legal 
rights of all American citizens by protecting 
them from infringement by the states as well 
as by the federal government. 
The third clause, ‘‘nor shall any State de-
prive any person of life, liberty or property, 
without due process of law,’’ expanded the 
due process clause of the Fifth Amendment to 
apply to the states as well as the federal gov-
ernment. 
Over time, this clause has been interpreted 
to guarantee a wide array of rights against in-
fringement by the states, including those enu-
merated in the Bill of Rights (freedom of 
speech, free exercise of religion, right to bear 
arms, etc.) as well as the right to privacy and 
other fundamental rights not mentioned else-
where in the Constitution. 
Finally, the ‘‘equal protection clause’’ (‘‘nor 
deny to any person within its jurisdiction the 
equal protection of the laws’’) was clearly in-
tended to stop state governments from dis-
criminating against black Americans, and over 
the years would play a key role in many land-
mark civil rights cases. 
It should be noted also, Mr. Speaker, that 
Section 2 of the 14th Amendment authorized 
the federal government to punish states that 
violated or abridged their citizens’ right to vote 
by proportionally reducing the states’ rep-
resentation in Congress, and mandated that 
anyone who ‘‘engaged in insurrection’’ against 
the United States could not hold civil, military, 
or elected office (without the approval of two- 
thirds of the House and Senate). 
And Section 5 of the 14th Amendment gave 
Congress ‘‘the power to enforce, by appro-
priate legislation, the provisions of this article.’’ 
In giving Congress power to pass laws to 
safeguard the sweeping provisions of Section 
1, in particular, the 14th Amendment effec-
tively altered the balance of power between 
the federal and state governments in the 
United States. 
Nearly a century later, Congress would use 
this authority to pass landmark civil rights leg-
islation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 
and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
The 15th Amendment granting African- 
American men the right to vote was adopted 
into the U.S. Constitution in 1870. 
The 15th Amendment states: ‘‘The right of 
citizens of the United States to vote shall not 
be denied or abridged by the United States or 
by any State on account of race, color, or pre-
vious condition of servitude.’’ 
Despite the amendment, by the late 1870s 
discriminatory practices were used to prevent 
blacks from exercising their right to vote, es-
pecially in the South. 
It wasn’t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 
that legal barriers were outlawed at the state 
and local levels if they denied African-Ameri-
cans their right to vote under the 15th Amend-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States is the 
world’s only superpower and boasts the larg-
est economy in the history of the world and for 
many years was the world’s indispensable na-
tion and the example that all aspiring democ-
racies wished to emulate. 
But at the same time, this nation has also 
been home to many searing instances of so-

Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Congresswoman for delin-
eating the important difference be-
tween the Emancipation Proclamation 
and the 13th Amendment. The Procla-
mation was a heroic action of Presi-
dent Lincoln; the 13th amendment was 
a historic action of this Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from South Carolina (Mr. CLYBURN), 
the Democratic whip of the House. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman BUTTERFIELD for yielding 
to me to talk on this very momentous 
occasion. I thank him for bringing at-
tention to this issue, the 155th anniver-
sary of the ratification of the 13th 
Amendment. 
Now, having not listened to all of the 
discussion before, and I hope I am not 
too repetitive here, but I want to bring 
to the attention of all here this 
evening and our listeners two con-
flicting events. 
b 1700 
Now, we often hear talk of the Eman-
cipation Proclamation. The fact of the 
matter is, there were two Emanci-
pation Proclamations, the first one 
freeing the formerly enslaved living in 
the District of Columbia, and that be-
came effective upon its signing in 1862. 
The second one, also written in 1862 
and signed by President Abraham Lin-
coln, was to become effective January 
1, 1863, and that was to free the other 
enslaved people in the former slave 
States, which meant that in those 
States that did not have officially 
sanctioned slavery but did have slaves, 
in order for them to be free and in 
order for the descendants of those from 
the District of Columbia and those af-
fected by those two proclamations, we 
needed a constitutional amendment, 
because as we know, executive orders 
could very well change with the next 
executive. 
So Abraham Lincoln set out to lay 
the groundwork for the Thirteenth 
Amendment, and so we are here cele-
brating the 155th anniversary of that. 
But we also this week will be cele-
brating the 150th anniversary of an-
other momentous event. 150 years ago 
come Saturday, we will commemorate 
the swearing in to this august body the 
first African American to serve in the 
United States Congress, Joseph H. 
Rainey. 
Joseph Rainey was from Georgetown, 
South Carolina, and early in his life 
moved to Charleston. He worked as a 
barber. His father was a barber, and he 
took up the barbering trade, and made 
enough money as a barber to purchase 
his and his family’s freedom. 
Now, the interesting thing about this 
is that I often talk about the French 
historian Alexis de Tocqueville, who 
came to this country in the 1830s to 
study our penal system, but while here, 
he saw what he considered to be a cer-
tain magic about this country. Back 
around 1836, he wrote a book, a two- 
volume book, called ‘‘Democracy in 
America.’’ 
Now, de Tocqueville, in trying to fig-
ure out what it was that he considered 
to be magical about this country, 
wrote in those books this little phrase: 
America is not great because it is more en-
lightened than any other nation . . . 
Just think about that, not more en-
lightened than any other nation, be-
cause we had slavery. This was the 
1830s. That was not an enlightened in-
stitution. 
But, he said: 
. . . rather, because it has always been able 
to repair its faults. 
Just 
think 
about 
that. 
De 
Tocqueville said that this country is 
great because it is able to repair its 
faults, writing that at a time when we 
had slavery in this country in the 1830s. 
It was some 30 years later when slavery 
was abolished. 
Now, the thing that I like to point 
out is the fact that we talk about all of 
these things that happened during Re-
construction, 
and 
most 
times 
the 
things we are talking about did not 
happen during Reconstruction, they 
happened after Reconstruction. 
Reconstruction was ushered in by the 
freeing of slaves in 1863. It came to an 
end in 1877 when Rutherford B. Hayes 
removed all of the Federal oversight 
and this country lapsed into a period 
that we call the Jim Crow era starting 
around 1877 and lasting all the way up 
to Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. 
Now, I wanted to point that out to-
night as we celebrate these milestones 
in our history, the 155th anniversary of 
the Thirteenth Amendment and we will 
be celebrating this week the 150th an-
niversary of the first African American 
to come to this august body. But I 
want to point out something inter-
esting about that. 
The last African American to serve 
in that century, to serve in this body, 
left Congress in 1897, George Wash-
ington Murray, the last from South 
Carolina. 
Now, I know G.K. BUTTERFIELD will 
get up and tell you about 1901, when 
Mr. White left the Congress and left 
with that great speech, Like the Phoe-
nix, but in South Carolina, the first 
State to give an African American to 
this body, the last one, George Wash-
ington Murray, left in 1897, and there 
was not another person of color to rep-
resent South Carolina until I got elect-
ed in 1992, 95 years later. 
Why? Because of something called 
voter suppression. 
I think that a lot of these former 
slave States have gone back into his-
tory and ripped out the textbooks, and 
we are seeing voter suppression being 
practiced today much like it was prac-
ticed back in the 19th century when 
they successfully removed all people of 
color from elective office. 
So I want to thank G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
for bringing attention to this today. It 
gives us an opportunity to ask the peo-
ple of the country to really think 
about this period of time and think 
about what we are experiencing today. 
Think about what is going on in the 
State of Georgia today, when we see 
interposition and nullification falling 
from the lips of the President of the 
United States in trying to overturn an 
election, much like they did that ran 
all Blacks out of Congress and much as 
they did that took Blacks out of elec-
tive office, took Blacks out of schools 
to be educated, all those things, and 
made it illegal for people of color to 
even get an education. 
I would hope that during this period 
of time, the people of this country will 
think a little bit about what is going 
on around us and just remember there 
is precedence for what the President of 
the United States is doing today. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Mr. CLYBURN very much for his 
comments tonight. 
Mr. Speaker, I would inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD) has 12 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
have 12 minutes remaining and I have 
four speakers. I will try to divide it up 
3 minutes each. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD) for allow-
ing me to share in this commemora-
tion. 
I rise to commemorate the 155th an-
niversary of the ratification of the 
Thirteenth Amendment to the Con-
stitution. 
155 years ago, slavery was abolished 
in the United States after Georgia’s 
State legislature ratified the Thir-
teenth Amendment, pushing it over the

three-fourths requirement. This was a 
monumental step for civil rights in 
America, the first of three constitu-
tional amendments during the Recon-
struction period that sought equality 
for the former slaves and their descend-
ants, Black Americans. 
Unfortunately, we know that these 
amendments did not achieve equality, 
and in fact outraged many of the 
former slaveholders. 
Slavery was the backbone of the 
southern economy and way of life. Sys-
tems like that do not disappear over-
night. 
After 
slavery 
was 
abolished, 
sharecropping came in its place; in the-
ory, free and fair, but in practice, any-
thing but. 
The Ku Klux Klan was organized by 
former Confederate officers to vio-
lently keep Black people in their 
places. 
The exception written into the Thir-
teenth Amendment that allowed invol-
untary servitude as a punishment upon 
conviction of a crime gave rise to what 
was known as the chain gang: free pris-
on labor, which still exists in many 
places today. 
Although the Thirteenth Amendment 
passed, southern legislatures enacted 
Black Codes and Jim Crow laws, legis-
lation that technically abided by the 
Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth 
Amendments, but still allowed dis-
crimination against Black Americans, 
maintaining white supremacy and still 
giving White Americans preferential 
treatment. 
This persisted up through the second 
half of the 20th century and persisted 
until the blood, sweat, and tears of the 
civil rights movement in the 1950s and 
1960s. 
John 
Lewis, 
JIM
CLYBURN, 
BENNIE THOMPSON, Hosea Williams, Joe 
Lowery, Medgar Evers put their lives 
on the line to stand up for the human-
ity of Black Americans. 
We often hear that slavery has been 
over for a long time, 155 years. It may 
be long for an individual, but not for a 
nation. But we should make clear and 
make no mistake about it that the leg-
acy of slavery still haunts America and 
it still handicaps our ability to realize 
the noble principles that this country 
stands for, that all men are created 
equal and endowed by their Creator 
with certain inalienable rights, life, 
liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, 
keeping in mind that we have made a 
lot of progress, but we are not where 
we need to go. There is still much work 
to do. 
Mr. Speaker, I challenge my col-
leagues in this body to keep in mind 
and ask themselves a question: What 
are we doing today to make America a 
more perfect union for the next 155 
years? 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. WATERS), 
the distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Financial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend and colleague, the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUTTERFIELD), for yielding, and I com-
mend him for organizing this Special 
Order on the 155th anniversary of the 
ratification of the Thirteenth Amend-
ment to the Constitution of the United 
States and the important relationship 
between the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, 
and Fifteenth Amendments. 
Since 
our 
founding, 
the 
United 
States has been engaged in a constant 
struggle to realize the full promise and 
potential of our founding principles, 
most especially the right for all people, 
regardless of race, color, or gender, to 
vote and participate in our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, despite the fact it has 
been more than 150 years from the pas-
sage of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, 
and Fifteenth Amendments, I was abso-
lutely horrified by the level of voter 
suppression that took place in the last 
election. 
The President and some Members of 
this body falsely claim that there was 
voting fraud, while courts have dis-
missed 43 cases the President’s legal 
team has brought. 
What is underappreciated and not 
discussed is the lengths the President 
and Republicans and States across the 
country went to to stop minorities 
from voting: fake vote-by-mail boxes, 
racist robocalls encouraging Blacks 
not to vote by mail, and the Presi-
dent’s absolute sabotage of the United 
States Postal Service to stop people 
from voting. 
Mr. Speaker, the next Congress and 
the new administration must come to-
gether to strengthen voting rights next 
year. We cannot wait. 
b 1715 
Those who fought and died for the 
right to vote must be remembered, and 
we honor their work by ensuring future 
generations have the right to vote. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. How much time 
remains, Mr. Speaker? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from North Carolina has 6 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Georgia 
(Mrs. MCBATH). 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from North Carolina, Rep-
resentative BUTTERFIELD, for yielding. 
Yesterday, we observed the anniver-
sary of the ratification of the 13th 
Amendment, which provided that ‘‘nei-
ther slavery nor involuntary servitude 
. . . shall exist within the United 
States.’’ 
It was one of the most dramatic ex-
pansions of civil rights in American 
history, and for the first time, our Con-
stitution made mention of the institu-
tion of slavery. 
155 years ago, the self-evident truth 
that all men are created equal had not 
been fully realized. But with every gen-
eration, with every chapter written in 
America’s story, the people of this Na-
tion 
have 
fought 
to 
secure 
the 
unalienable rights which were endowed 
by our Creator. 
As we enter a new era, we must not 
forget that we stand on the shoulders 
of those who came before us, giants 
like John Lewis, Elijah Cummings, and 
C.T. Vivian who helped pave the way 
for millions of little boys and little 
girls who believed that they could do 
anything that they set their minds to, 
that they could become whomever they 
wanted to be. 
155 years after slavery, we reflect on 
how far this Nation has truly come. 
There are many who lived a century 
ago who would not believe that Amer-
ica today would welcome the great- 
grandchildren of slaves to serve their 
communities and their country and our 
government. 
We commemorate that long march 
toward justice and celebrate all who 
have played a role in making the lives 
of their children better than their own. 
Today, and every day, we must con-
tinue the work of all those whose 
shoulders we now stand upon. We must 
continue to strive toward that more 
perfect Union, toward a future free 
from hatred, bigotry, and violence. 
The work we do in this Chamber can 
advance the cause for freedom, justice, 
and peace. Each and every day, I pray 
that we continue to rise to meet that 
moment. 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman for her very 
powerful words. 
At this time, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from North Carolina for 
convening us to commemorate this 
155th anniversary of the ratification of 
our 13th Amendment. 
It is difficult sometimes for many of 
us to look back at history because it 
was so painful, but it is important so 
that we understand where we are and 
how we got here. 
The enslavement of the Negro, the 
extermination of the Indian, the annex-
ation of the Hispanic made, in many 
respects, the birth of our Republic an 
iniquitous conception. It was conceived 
under the concept that White men were 
superior to Black men and, therefore, 
entitled to oppress them, harass them, 
and, if necessary, destroy them. 
We all talk about, as has been men-
tioned here today, the words of the 
Declaration of Independence and how 
this is a nation that believes that all 
men and women are created equal and 
that we are endowed by our Creator 
with certain unalienable rights, that 
among those shall be life, liberty, and 
the pursuit of happiness. 
But the great historian John Hope 
Franklin reminded us that, many years 
after those words were written, we still 
existed in a society where slavery was 
the order of the day. In fact, it was the 
great historian John Hope Franklin 
who referred to it as the great evil in-
stitution of American servitude. 
It would be the 13th Amendment that 
would, to a large extent, end that and 
give us what we are celebrating here 
today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6896 
December 7, 2020 
But even after Lincoln signed the 
Emancipation Proclamation, it was 
still several years before we got to the 
13th Amendment, which ended slavery; 
the 14th Amendment, which guaran-
teed citizenship and due process; and 
then the 15th Amendment, which gave 
us and ratified for us the right to vote. 
I think that, without a doubt, when 
we look back on all that has happened, 
particularly considering how we got 
here, that this commemoration is im-
portant. It is overdue. It ought to be an 
annual celebration. 
I, again, thank the distinguished gen-
tleman from North Carolina for con-
vening us. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman from North 
Carolina has expired. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 155th anniversary of the 
13th Amendment to the Constitution of the 
United States of America. Passed by the 
House of Representatives on January 31, 
1865, the 13th Amendment was ratified and 
put into effect on December 6, 1865. 
Section 1 of the 13th Amendment states, 
‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, ex-
cept as a punishment for crime whereof the 
party shall have been duly convicted, shall 
exist within the United States, or any place 
subject to their jurisdiction.’’ 
This amendment is what allows Black peo-
ple the legal status to be free, unbound, and 
unchained here in our country. If this amend-
ment were not in place, we would still be 
slaves and subject to the forced subjugation of 
others. Before the ratification of this amend-
ment, Black people in the U.S. were enslaved 
and owned by other people. Now, we are 
owned by no one. 
This legacy in the U.S., this original sin, is 
recognized as an abomination to mankind. As 
I travel throughout the world, I am reminded of 
the greatness of our nation, but I am also in-
tensely aware of the faults, shortcomings, and 
injustices that still plague us today. It is a sad 
reflection on our society that we are still fight-
ing for complete and pure freedom in our 
country, to share in the fundamental rights 
guaranteed by our constitution to every per-
son. 
It is without question that we love this coun-
try and for most people, know no other place 
to call home. We have struggled, fought, and 
even died along the path to freedom. Our very 
existence has been met with severe hard-
ships. No one today can imagine the horrors 
that slaves were subjected to daily. 
However, there are those who, even today, 
say that slavery for Black people was a good 
thing and a blessing in disguise. This errant 
view is void of reality and ridiculous on its 
face. 
The evils of slavery are too many to com-
prehensively and adequately express. There 
are thousands of helpless people who were 
bound, shackled, whipped, quartered, hung, 
burned and endured unspeakable horrors 
whose stories will never be told. 
The lasting effects of slavery permeate 
many aspects of society today. Institutional-
ized racism, discrimination and prejudices are 
each lasting remnants of our history and are 
present with us even now. Our challenge is to 
continue to fight to wipe out these insidious 
vestiges of a time long passed and a grue-
some period of every day American life. 
Our nation will be forever stained with the 
blood of slavery. Our nation will be forever 
blessed by the freedom and liberty that the 
ratification of the 13th Amendment brings. Let 
us continue the never ending fight for freedom 
as we move towards prosperity for everyone. 
While the 13th Amendment legally ended 
slavery in the United States, we know that for 
many it did not end in 1865. Thousands of 
Black people were either uninformed of their 
liberty or just outright denied their rights to be 
free. They were forced into continued ser-
vitude and grueling work to support the needs 
of their owners and masters. In Texas, word of 
freedom and liberation from the slave owners 
and masters of plantations and farms did not 
reach Black people until a whole two years 
later. 
Slavery in the United States was not just a 
way of life, but an oppressive institution that 
was designed to profit off of the free labor of 
Black folk. It was extremely prosperous. It is 
without question that our nation was built on 
the backs of Black people who continuously 
suffered the indignities, degradation and hu-
miliation of being enslaved. 
We cannot afford to rest, sleep or be caught 
off guard. Even though the 13th Amendment 
is in place, it does not mean that it cannot be 
changed. All we truly have to do is look at the 
last administration and its constant attacks on 
the freedom of people in the U.S. and its at-
tacks on our democratic institutions. Our free-
dom must be protected. 
Please allow me to briefly turn my attention 
to the relationship between the 13th, 14th, and 
15th amendments. The 13th, 14th, and 15th 
Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, pro-
posed after the Civil War, granted enslaved 
Black people freedom, citizenship, and the 
right to vote. The 15th Amendment declared 
that the right of U.S. citizens to vote could 
‘‘not be abridged or denied’’ by any state’’ on 
account of race, color, or previous condition of 
servitude.’’ These rights are still being at-
tacked by those who would deny all people of 
color freedom, citizenship and the fundamental 
right to vote. The third and final Amendment 
during the Reconstruction Era—was adopted 
to protect the freedoms outlined in the 13th 
and 14th Amendments. Make no mistake— 
Reconstruction for Black people was dev-
astating and a gross erosion of rights that 
were supposed to be guaranteed. 
Mr. Speaker, our country is no longer di-
vided between free states and slave states. 
We are now one. While we take this time to 
recognize and celebrate this critical bench-
mark in the history of our country, we must 
continue to fight to be the land of the free. 
f 
MARKING RATIFICATION OF 13TH 
AMENDMENT 
(Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank all the speakers this evening. I 
understand the time has been precious, 
and I thank all of them for their pa-
tience and willingness to participate. 
The 13th Amendment reads as fol-
lows: ‘‘Neither slavery nor involuntary 
servitude . . . shall exist within the 
United States, or any place subject to 
their jurisdiction.’’ 
This amendment was added to the 
United States Constitution by an act of 
Congress on January 31, 1865, ratified 
by the requisite number of States on 
December 6, 1865, 155 years ago. 
f 
PAYING TRIBUTE TO GREG 
WALDEN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Michigan (Mr. UPTON) 
for 30 minutes. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, this 30 
minutes is a tribute to our leader who 
is leaving us, GREG WALDEN, the top 
Republican on the Energy and Com-
merce 
Committee 
and 
the 
former 
chairman, and, obviously, a good friend 
to everyone on both sides of the aisle. 
Knowing that many Members have 
plenty of meetings that are starting, I 
am going to yield to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. HUDSON). 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate my friend and 
my colleague, Congressman GREG WAL-
DEN, on his retirement, following more 
than 20 years representing Oregon’s 
Second District here in Congress. 
As a member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, Chairman WALDEN 
has been a real mentor to me. I have 
seen firsthand Chairman WALDEN’s love 
for his country, dedication to his dis-
trict, and hard work on so many impor-
tant priorities for our Nation, like 
healthcare, energy independence, and 
telecommunications. 
I have so many fond memories of the 
work we have done together and the 
time we have spent. I especially en-
joyed working with Chairman WALDEN 
on H.R. 6, landmark legislation to com-
bat the opioid crisis. 
Chairman WALDEN, you will be dearly 
missed, but I wish you, Mylene, An-
thony, and your entire family all the 
best. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
thanking Congressman GREG WALDEN 
for his extraordinary service. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. JOHN-
SON), also a member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. I, 
too, rise today to pay tribute to my 
good friend and mentor on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee, GREG WAL-
DEN. 
I spent 27 years in the United States 
Air Force. We lived by a code of con-
duct every day. We came to work. We 
embodied those core values of integrity 
first, service before self, and excellence 
in all that we do. 
In my experience, it is not often that 
you find people in private life or in 
other sectors of public life who also 
embody those same core values, but 
Chairman GREG WALDEN does. 
Whether 
he 
was 
fighting 
for 
healthcare changes for the American 
people, to make America more energy 
independent and secure, whether he 
was trying to make sure that Big Tech 
did not overrun the American people,

you could always count on GREG WAL-
DEN to be out in front leading, not fol-
lowing, and, certainly, not leading 
from behind. 
I learned a lot in the 6 years that I 
served with GREG WALDEN when he was 
on the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee as the chairman, and even be-
fore that as chair of our National Re-
publican Congressional Committee. 
It is with a great deal of sadness that 
we see him leave because a lot of core 
institutional knowledge is going to go 
out the door. But I want to say how 
much I have admired working with 
GREG WALDEN. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. BLU-
MENAUER), a colleague. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
have been honored to know and work 
around GREG WALDEN for 40 years. It is 
kind of scary to think about that. 
He came to public service honestly. 
I was privileged to serve with his fa-
ther in the Oregon State Legislature 
when GREG started as a staff member 
in the State senate. He was bright, ca-
pable, and committed to the people of 
the Second Congressional District, a 
special place in Oregon, and GREG was 
quick to always represent it forcefully, 
clearly, and effectively. 
We have shared some highlights over 
the years. I remember floating in the 
Dead Sea early in our congressional ca-
reer. I was able to work with him in a 
small way on something that he is very 
proud of, the Steens Mountain Wilder-
ness, almost 100,000 acres of cow-free 
wilderness. Now, some of us would have 
done it a little differently, but knowing 
where GREG came from in his district, 
that was a signal accomplishment. And 
we were able to work together in the 
Clinton administration. 
I was pleased to have one of the best 
field hearings I ever had in public serv-
ice as GREG and I, and his wife, Mylene, 
and his son, Anthony, and our staff 
members did a 43-mile, 3-day hike 
around Mount Hood, that magnificent 
mountain that we share in our dis-
tricts. 
We were able to meet with various 
interest groups and work together to 
lay the foundation for significant wil-
derness legislation that was signed into 
law by President Obama but that we 
worked together on a bipartisan basis 
to make possible. 
Recently, we were able to work on 
legislation that almost nobody paid 
any attention to. It dealt with a sig-
nificant change to enhance the ability 
of physicians, particularly in emer-
gency rooms, to know the family his-
tory of people there who suffered from 
opioid addiction. 
Again, not many people know about 
it, and it was several years and harder 
than I thought, but it will make a dif-
ference to be able to make sure that 
those emergency room personnel will 
be able to treat the whole person. It 
solved a problem that maybe shouldn’t 
have been, but it is part of that nag-
ging problem that we have, in terms of 
trying to work through the legislative 
process. And GREG was a master at 
that. 
I didn’t always agree with GREG. Oc-
casionally, we had some differences. 
But we often were able to find common 
ground to represent the people of our 
State in a way that they wanted us to. 
b 1730 
It is an honor. I will say, even though 
we didn’t always agree, I always re-
spected GREG in terms of his commit-
ment, his intellect, and his sense of 
humor. 
It has been an honor, GREG, to serve 
with you 22 years—really? 
You have escaped, and I can’t wait to 
find out what the next chapters in your 
career bring. 
I wish the very best to you, Mylene, 
and Anthony, and a long and pros-
perous next step. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
FITZPATRICK). 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I speak on the House 
floor tonight, not as somebody who has 
ever served on the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee, but as someone 
who was a freshman in the 115th Con-
gress with a very, very specific and 
very direct link to a piece of legisla-
tion we were advocating known as the 
right-to-try bill. 
When I got sworn in, one of the first 
people I sought out was Chairman 
GREG WALDEN. I went to his office, and 
I was initially taken aback by the pho-
tography he had throughout his office 
of his district, which is an incredibly 
beautiful district in Oregon. 
We have all had many meetings in 
our time in Congress here, but one of 
my memories is, when I met with 
Chairman WALDEN, I have to acknowl-
edge I was very intimidated. I was a 
freshman Member speaking to a com-
mittee chairperson of a very, very sig-
nificant committee. 
The time, the attention, and the re-
spect that he showed me and the issue 
that I cared about I will never forget. 
It is one of those memories that I have 
of my freshman term that I will never 
forget. 
We have all heard many definitions 
of character being spoken throughout 
our lives. My favorite definition is 
character being defined as the things 
that we do and the decisions that we 
make when nobody else is watching. 
Having worked with Chairman WAL-
DEN on the right-to-try bill, his hon-
esty, his integrity, and his commit-
ment to doing the right thing—not the 
politically popular thing, not what any 
interest group was advocating for, but 
trying to get the specifics and the de-
tails of a piece of very important legis-
lation right—was very, very instruc-
tive to me. It was probably the great-
est experience and the greatest learn-
ing experience I had as a freshman 
Member of Congress. 
For GREG to walk away having ac-
complished all that he has on his own 
is reminiscent of my favorite Presi-
dent, George Washington. Everybody 
wanted him to continue serving, and 
all he wanted to do was go back home 
to his farm in Mount Vernon, live 
under the laws he helped pass, and 
make way for a new generation of lead-
ership, which is one of the reasons he is 
so revered throughout history. 
Likewise, we ought to respect Chair-
man WALDEN, our friend, GREG, for 
doing the same thing: for under-
standing the important things in life, 
for valuing his family the way he does, 
knowing that as much as he enjoys this 
job and how humbled he is to serve in 
the capacity he has, he is going back 
home to his family because they are 
the most important things to him. 
So, Chairman WALDEN, Godspeed to 
you. We love you. Thank you for all 
you have done, not just for this Cham-
ber, but for the United States. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from the State of 
Washington (Mrs. RODGERS), the GREG 
WALDEN successor as the top Repub-
lican on the powerful Energy and Com-
merce Committee and, as we like to 
say, chairman-in-waiting in the next 
aisle. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. To 
the former chairman, I will say thank 
you. Thank you for bringing us to-
gether tonight. It is a real honor for 
me to join in recognizing the life and 
the service of GREG WALDEN here in the 
House of Representatives. 
Mr. Speaker, I have the pleasure of 
considering him a friend and a col-
league. He is also my neighbor to the 
south in Oregon. Both of us have deep 
roots in the Pacific Northwest, al-
though he will be quick to remind me 
that his family came out a few years 
ahead of mine. I think it was 1845. We 
didn’t get there until 1853, I think. 
Anyway, he is always excelling. 
I was thinking he probably has the 
most frequent flier points today, now, 
because there is no one who has worked 
harder and traveled back and forth 
across this country in representing the 
people of Oregon all these years. 
I want to join in just celebrating a 
tremendous leader. He was chairman of 
the House Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee. He led that committee in a way 
that just reflects what a great history 
this committee has. It is always fo-
cused on results and always focused on 
solving the problems of bringing people 
together to get big things done. 
I just appreciate the vision and the 
foundation that you have led during 
your time on the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
There is a long list of successes and 
accomplishments here: leading on com-
bating the opioid crisis—a huge pack-
age of bills—and building a 21st cen-
tury economy. 
This committee is at the heart of 
America’s competitiveness and our fu-
ture, 
such 
as 
expanding 
rural 
broadband. 
I 
appreciate 
all 
your 
leadership 
there. Our districts are very similar,

eastern Washington and eastern Or-
egon. You worked to make sure that no 
one is left behind. 
Recognizing and reauthorizing the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program, 
lowering prescription drugs and the 
prices 
of 
prescription 
drugs, 
and 
unleashing innovation in energy and 
healthcare is a part of a long list, and 
because of your leadership at the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee, peo-
ple’s lives have been improved. People 
have been lifted out of poverty, and we 
have raised the standard of living even 
more. 
I appreciate the way that he leads, 
Mr. Speaker, and the joy that he brings 
to every assignment. This is somebody 
who has held a lot of different titles 
while serving in the House of Rep-
resentatives. I have been around him 
many times through the years. He is a 
strong advocate. 
I remember, early on, being down at 
the White House, when I was first 
elected, with George W. Bush, and 
GREG WALDEN was there. But he didn’t 
miss an opportunity to put in a good 
word about the need for better forest 
management and combating the cata-
strophic wildfires. He was always, al-
ways on, and always advocating for the 
people of eastern Oregon. 
This is one that we are going to miss. 
He is just the ultimate legislator. He is 
the one who has come, worked hard, 
made a difference for the people of 
eastern Oregon, and leaves a high 
standard for the rest of us in his com-
mitment, his hard work, and his record 
of results. 
So no matter where life takes you 
next, I know it is going to be some-
thing good. I wish you, Mylene, and 
Anthony all the best in this next chap-
ter. It is well earned and well deserved. 
God bless you, and the best is yet to 
come. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from the great State of 
Michigan (Mr. WALBERG), who is an-
other member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I was in 
my office just finishing up a meeting 
when I saw this going on down here, 
and I knew I had to come because 
Chairman WALDEN— 
You don’t mind if I call you chair-
man still? 
I don’t know if that violates any 
House policy, Mr. Speaker. 
You will always be my chairman. 
You were my first chairman as I 
came on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee, a committee that I wanted 
to be on for an awful long time. Rep-
resentative UPTON and I talked about 
that for quite some time. He assured 
me that that was the key committee to 
be on. I knew that for a fact, and I have 
not been disappointed. 
One of the quotes that means most to 
me is the quote that is above the 
Speakers’s rostrum. It is a quote from 
Daniel Webster, who said: 
Let us develop the resources of our 
land, call forth its powers, build up its 
institutions, promote all its great in-
terests, and see whether we also, in our 
day and generation, may not perform 
something worthy to be remembered. 
It is a powerful quote, and we all as-
pire to that, but a few actually achieve 
that. 
Chairman WALDEN, I want to say 
that, through the Speaker to you, I be-
lieve you have achieved that purpose in 
doing something here that will be re-
membered, if not in all of the policy 
issues and the legislative issues you 
fronted and pushed for, you will leave 
that in the lives of Members who have 
served with you on your committee 
and under your leadership. 
I will never forget a 27-hour markup 
and a debate that went on after the 
pattern that ought to be here in the 
House of Representatives. I remember 
the firmness with which you led that 
committee markup, the passion that 
you displayed on the issues, the agree-
ments and disagreements that you had 
and you let in. But you treated us all 
on that committee with respect worthy 
of this institution, and you treated 
each Member with a purpose that said 
to all of us: You are important, and 
your ideas should be considered. 
I know for a fact I have served under 
chairmen and Speakers over the course 
of my tenure in State and in national 
politics who have led, but only a few 
have led in such a way as you, that the 
people you led felt that you really 
meant it, that you wanted their best 
whether you agreed or disagreed with 
us, and you made us better for the call-
ing and for the purpose. 
So I want to say to you, Mr. Chair-
man, thank you for your service. I wish 
you well, your family, and in all of 
your endeavors. You can count on it 
that I will pray prayers of thanks for 
you and blessings on your life. 
All the best. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I know 
other Members may be on the way 
over. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks as part of this Spe-
cial Order for Mr. WALDEN. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Michigan? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. UPTON. So, Mr. Speaker, this is 
a farewell for GREG WALDEN. 
He started off in public service serv-
ing as the youngest State house major-
ity leader in Oregon’s history before he 
was elected to the U.S. House for Or-
egon’s Second District. 
He came to the Energy and Com-
merce Committee in 2001, and, of 
course, I referenced the Energy and 
Commerce Committee a little bit ear-
lier as the greatest committee, and 
that is because I simply took the words 
of John Dingell, our former chairman, 
who agrees with me, I know, but as he 
would say, our committee’s jurisdic-
tion is really just two words: the world. 
We have jurisdiction over energy, the 
environment, 
healthcare, 
tele-
communications, 
trade, 
manufac-
turing, and then some, and, of course, 
that very important issue called over-
sight and investigations. 
GREG
chaired 
the 
Telecommuni-
cations Subcommittee from 2010 until 
2016. He jumped up over others in se-
niority because of his knowledge on 
that issue and his passion, whether it 
be broadband or digital broadcasting, 
anything involving the telecommuni-
cation industry. He became chairman 
of the full committee in 2017, and, obvi-
ously, the top Republican now, as Re-
publicans no longer serve in the major-
ity. 
As you look back at his career, Mr. 
Speaker, and you look at some of these 
landmark 
issues—CATHY
MCMORRIS 
RODGERS indicated a couple—but CHIP, 
children’s healthcare, so important for 
all of our States. He was a leader on 
that. 
For the first time ever, we actually 
passed something with a 10-year au-
thorization bill called the community 
health centers authorization. 
Opioids were a big issue 3, 4 years 
ago. It still is today, but literally every 
member of our committee had a piece 
of that bill. I want to say maybe more 
than 100 different separate bills were 
fashioned together as one. President 
Trump signed it into law, and it made 
a meaningful difference for so many 
people as they struggle with this addic-
tion across the country. 
I couldn’t forget this one bill, and I 
had to write the title down, the Repack 
Airwaves Yielding Better Access for 
Users of Modern Servers. I think I got 
that right. If you take the first letter 
of every word, that spells RAY BAUM. 
Ray Baum was our staff director of 
the committee for a couple years until 
a terrible brain cancer took his life. 
This bill was named in honor of Ray. 
I will tell you, 911 calls wouldn’t 
work today without this, because this 
provided the location, when that call is 
made, to make sure that the first re-
sponder, in fact, is going to get to that 
delivery site. So it is very important 
legislation, and Ray was just an awe-
some leader on our committee. 
But I see other Members have joined 
us now. 
May I ask, Mr. Speaker, how much 
time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Michigan has 8 minutes 
remaining. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
MCNERNEY), who is a member of the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. MCNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Michigan. I can 
tell you a couple minutes is enough 
time because I am a brief speaker, but 
it says a lot that I am willing to come 
down here and risk COVID to speak in 
favor of a Republican. So there you 
have it. 
I have known GREG WALDEN for many 
years now in the committee. On trips

and on new legislation, he has been a 
gentleman, and he has been a person I 
could work with. 
We have some disagreements, don’t 
we, GREG? 
But that says a lot that we can dis-
agree and still be friends. 
I went to Oregon to visit and to see 
the eclipse, and GREG invited me to go 
to his place with his friends and watch 
it with them. I really appreciated that. 
So it shows you that people can get 
along in this institution, work to-
gether, and have respect for each other. 
b 1745 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. 
BROOKS), a member of the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my dear friend from Michi-
gan for organizing this really impor-
tant Special Order. 
I have to say, many of you probably 
heard the phrase, a politician thinks 
about the next election, but it is a 
statesman who thinks about the next 
generation. 
GREG WALDEN of Oregon is both. He 
is an amazing politician, but he is an 
even more important statesman for our 
next generation. 
Representative WALDEN has been a 
mentor to many. When he was chair of 
NRCC, he mentored and helped so 
many people become a part of this 
great 
institution. 
But 
then 
he 
mentored people like me, along with 
Representative UPTON of Michigan, to 
make it to the Committee on Energy 
and Commerce, where I knew that big 
things got done and that the world was 
our jurisdiction. 
Not only was he a mentor, but he 
rose to chair of that committee, and he 
did it with humility, he did it with 
humor, he did it with wisdom. And I 
am so glad you talked about all of the 
things he accomplished, but he always 
reminded us that he was an Oregon 
broadcaster, first and foremost, and 
that he loved his incredible State of 
Oregon, and was such a leader. 
Mr. Speaker, it has been my pleas-
ure—and my husband David’s pleas-
ure—to travel with he and Mylene, and 
more importantly, most recently, to 
get to know his son, that next genera-
tion of leaders, Anthony. 
I thank you for the opportunities you 
gave me and so many of my colleagues. 
I wish you the best in retirement. You 
have been an amazing mentor, an 
amazing friend, and an amazing leader 
in this country. You are a statesman, 
my friend. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
report some breaking news. Roll Call 
has just put something out online, it 
will be published tomorrow. And the 
headline is: ‘‘Adulting might be alive 
and well in Congress. The retiring 
LAMAR ALEXANDER and GREG WALDEN 
show it’s possible to do your job in pub-
lic life while acting like a grown-up.’’ 
That is GREG. He got things done. He 
was an Eagle Scout when he was a 
youngster, still is a mighty big Ducks 
fan. You can’t walk into his office 
without seeing the Ducks. He is in a lot 
better mood on Monday when you see 
him if the Ducks win. They didn’t win 
the other day. But he has been a really 
special individual with real care and 
handling of all the different issues that 
our committee deals with. 
A partner in leadership on both sides 
of the aisle, his word is his bond. His 
staff has been terrific, all of them: All 
the subcommittee staff, his personal 
staff, and obviously, his greatest staff 
person, Mylene. Mylene and his son, 
Anthony, we have watched him grow 
up from when Anthony was a young-
ster, but Mylene has been a special 
friend, really, to all of us. She puts up 
with GREG. Usually, she is on the West 
Coast while he is over here. 
Mr. Speaker, he has been a special 
talent that has been lent to our com-
mittee to make this country a better 
place. 
Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. WAL-
DEN). 
Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
all my colleagues who came down to-
night to share these words. I want to 
assure the American people—it feels 
like a eulogy—I am actually still alive 
but deeply indebted for their gen-
erosity, their kindness, and their words 
tonight. It means a lot. 
I have told people I am not one of the 
grumpy, cranky Members leaving. This 
is a great institution with really good 
people who do good work here. We may 
not always agree, as my friend from 
Oregon or my friend from California 
said, but it doesn’t mean we have to be 
disagreeable. We come here to solve 
problems. We approach them from dif-
ferent angles representing different 
Americans, but we come here to find 
solutions. 
I have been so blessed to work with 
people like Mrs. BROOKS, Mr. BLU-
MENAUER, and my friend from Michi-
gan, Mr. UPTON, and the others who 
were down here. It is a team effort, and 
we live in a really, really great coun-
try. I have been so blessed to be a part 
of this institution for the last 22 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I had hair when I came 
here. Honest. I can show you photos. So 
it will take a lot out of you. But when 
I do return home, I will complete my 
644th round trip between the Nation’s 
Capitol and home. I did that because I 
really wanted to stay in touch, and my 
family is here, and yet it proves the 
point. On almost every flight, my 
friend from the Portland area, Mr. BLU-
MENAUER, has been right there with me, 
and our colleague, Mr. DEFAZIO, almost 
every trip. And it is what we do as 
Members here. We go home, we listen 
to our constituents, we come back, we 
try and find solutions, whether it is on 
opioids or internet connectivity, or all 
the things that have been referenced 
tonight. 
My success is attributed to the peo-
ple I have been able to work with, my 
colleagues. And as Mr. UPTON said, our 
terrific, brilliant staff in this institu-
tion, who work literally day and night. 
And I know because I get texts from 
them at midnight when they are read-
ing through a bill or working on an 
agreement and negotiating at the staff- 
to-staff level. America is well-served 
by this institution, and I wish more 
Americans saw the kind of camaraderie 
that we have here, the comity we have 
here, and the accomplishment that we 
do here. 
Mr. Speaker, this place still works, 
and I just wish well the incoming class 
of new Members who bring new energy 
and new ideas to this process. I know 
they, too, come here to represent their 
people back home. 
Mr. Speaker, to my friends, thank 
you. This was most generous, over the 
top, and a big surprise. I thought I was 
just headed off as a homeless Member 
of Congress with no office to find some-
thing to eat, but instead, Mrs. MCMOR-
RIS RODGERS said I needed to come with 
her over here. 
Thank you to my friends. Mr. UPTON, 
my dear friend—he and Amey and my 
wife and I are very close—thank you 
for your kindness and your words. I 
will have a more formal farewell 
speech I will give later this week on 
the House floor, so I will reserve any 
further comments to that time. 
Mr. Speaker, I just would, again, 
thank my friend from Michigan, Mr. 
UPTON. 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time.

NATIONAL CYBER DIRECTOR ACT 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
LANGEVIN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the Conference Report 
to accompany the National Defense 
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021 
that we will be considering tomorrow. 
Mr. Speaker, this is my 20th NDAA, 
and as ever, I am incredibly proud of 
the bipartisan work that went in to 
creating it. Amidst all the 1300 provi-
sions, however, I want to focus on sec-
tion 1752. 
Section 1752 is based on my bill, H.R. 
7331, the National Cyber Director Act, 
and it is the result of more than 10 
years of deliberative thought and advo-
cacy. The provision is simple enough. 
It creates an Office of the National 
Cyber Director within the Executive 
Office of the President. The office is led 
by a director who will be Presidentially 
appointed and confirmed by the Sen-
ate. 
The 
National 
Cyber 
Director 
is 
charged with being the President’s 
principal adviser on matters of cyber-
security policy with developing and 
overseeing implementation of the na-
tional cyber strategy. He or she will

December 7, 2020 
also be responsible for coordinating 
government response to serious cyber 
incidents. And as I said, simple enough, 
but this represents a complete sea 
change in the way cybersecurity is 
handled in the Federal Government. 
The need could not be more urgent. 
Of course, cyber operations, whether 
carried out by criminals or nation 
states, continue to threaten us as a Na-
tion. Hardly a day goes by where we 
don’t read about a new ransomware at-
tack taking down an entire hospital 
system or shutting down businesses. 
Our adversaries target our elections to 
strike at the heart of our democracy. 
They target our defense industrial base 
that gives us our competitive edge. 
They are even targeting vaccine re-
search that may be the key to ending 
the terrible pandemic that we are liv-
ing through. 
Mr. Speaker, cyberspace is a new do-
main, and the first that has been cre-
ated entirely by humankind. We would 
not expect that emerging security 
challenges in cyberspace would be easy 
to tackle, and, of course, they have 
proven to be quite difficult. 
After all, many security paradigms 
that developed about borders are vir-
tually meaningless when it is as easy 
to attack a computer across the room 
as it is to attack one half a world 
away. While decidedly thorny, these 
challenges are not insurmountable. 
However, the Federal Government 
has not risen to the challenges as well 
as we could hope. There are many rea-
sons for this, but probably the most 
important of which is that nobody real-
ly is in charge. Cybersecurity is often 
passed off as an IT problem, best left to 
the geeks to handle, instead of being 
recognized as an operational risk that 
needs attention from senior leadership. 
Most Federal agencies do not have 
cybersecurity in their core missions, so 
investments in cyber capabilities can 
fall by the wayside. Computer systems 
also pervade every aspect of the Fed-
eral Government’s work, so coordina-
tion is required across the entire inter-
agency. 
The failures to rise to address these 
challenges poses real risk to the gov-
ernment. Sensitive government data, 
such as clearance information stored at 
the Office of Personnel Management, 
has been stolen. U.S. corporations suf-
fer billions of dollars in damages each 
year from cyber incidents, and other 
adversaries increasingly view the cyber 
domain as ideal for conducting asym-
metric warfare in the ‘‘gray zone,’’ 
below the level of armed conflict. 
Mr. Speaker, for more than a decade, 
I have been involved in numerous ef-
forts to root out underlying causes of 
the government’s inability to get its 
arms around the cybersecurity prob-
lem. Most recently, I had the distinct 
privilege of serving on the Cyberspace 
Solarium Commission, a 14-member 
body chartered by Congress to develop 
a strategic approach to protect the 
United States from cyber incidents of 
significant consequence. 
One of the things that these efforts 
have universally uncovered—a finding 
endorsed recently by the Government 
Accountability Office—is that a lack of 
centralized leadership in the White 
House is holding the government back. 
Mr. Speaker, only the White House 
has the ability to compel interagency 
cooperation and ensure that cybersecu-
rity 
efforts 
are 
synergistic 
and 
deduplicated. 
Only the White House can ensure 
that budgets are adequate, both for in-
ternal cyber defense and external cy-
bersecurity programs aimed at pro-
tecting the private sector. 
Only the White House can effectively 
coordinate incident response across 
two dozen agencies with some cyberse-
curity responsibility. 
Now, Presidents Bush and Obama 
both made strides in improving cyber-
security policy coordination within the 
White House, changes that were at first 
carried forward by President Trump 
and his Homeland Security adviser. 
But none of them gave the position 
they created the gravitas and author-
ity it needed to be successful. And 
eventually, 
then-national 
Director 
John Bolton, eventually eliminated the 
cybersecurity coordinating position al-
together. 
Congress needed to step in and pro-
vide strategic direction with the Na-
tional Cyber Director Act that we have 
here. Finally, we will have the ac-
countability that comes from having a 
leader within the Executive Office of 
the President that we can interrogate 
about cyber strategy writ large, and 
that we, as the Congress, will in turn 
be accountable to our constituents for 
ensuring the strategy is executed and 
resourced properly. 
This NDAA will be an incredibly im-
portant bill in the history of cyberse-
curity legislation, and I am honored to 
have played a key role in advancing it. 
b 1800 
Mr. Speaker, like any bill a decade in 
the making, many hands have gotten 
us to this point with the National 
Cyber Director Act. First off, I owe an 
enormous debt of gratitude to Speaker 
NANCY PELOSI for appointing me as her 
designee to the Cyberspace Solarium 
Commission. Developing and imple-
menting the commission report has 
been one of the highlights of my con-
gressional career, and much of the 
progress that we have made on the Na-
tional Cyber Director is due to my fel-
low commissioners. 
I want to start with Congressman 
Patrick Murphy as my original ally on 
this proposal, based on his experience 
in these Halls and in the executive 
branch. 
Tom Fanning brought his expertise 
as a major utility executive in crafting 
a recommendation that ensures ac-
countability. 
Frank Cilluffo focused relentlessly 
on appropriately scoping the authori-
ties 
of 
the 
office, 
while 
Suzanne 
Spaulding fought to ensure that the 
National Cyber Director will have in-
sight into all U.S. operations in the 
cyber domain. 
Dr. 
Samantha 
Ravich’s 
initial 
scepticism was essential to making 
sure the final recommendation reflects 
the realities of working within the Ex-
ecutive Office of the President. 
Finally, 
Chris 
Inglis’s 
invaluable 
feedback means that the bill we vote 
on tomorrow will fit squarely within 
the strategic vision laid out by the 
commission. Despite my years working 
on this proposal, I was always im-
pressed by Chris’s ability to elegantly 
connect the National Cyber Director 
recommendation with our broader mis-
sion. 
I would never have been exposed to 
the idea of a stronger coordinating au-
thority within the White House were it 
not for my time on the Center for Stra-
tegic and International Studies’ Com-
mission on Cybersecurity for the 44th 
Presidency, which I was proud to co- 
chair. My fellow co-chairs, General 
Harry Raduege, Scott Charney, and es-
pecially 
Congressman 
MICHAEL 
MCCAUL, all helped shape my thinking 
during my first deep dive on this topic. 
And, of course, we would have been lost 
without the expert guidance of CSIS’s 
Jim Lewis, the commission’s executive 
director. 
After 9 years of trying to pass a bill 
to codify a cybersecurity role within 
the White House, what changed this 
year? 
Well, quite frankly, John Bolton and 
his poor decisionmaking changed the 
equation. Given the ever-increasing 
threat in cyberspace, I don’t think any-
one realistically thought that some-
body would dare eliminate the cyber 
coordinator at the White House. Yet, in 
one of the worst cybersecurity policy 
moves ever seen, Bolton did just that, 
making clear the need for congres-
sional action to establish a permanent 
cyber director. 
That need was well understood by 
Chairman ADAM SMITH, who has backed 
the inclusion of Solarium recommenda-
tions in the NDAA since day one and 
who has consistently supported the Na-
tional Cyber Director Act. 
Chairwoman CAROLYN MALONEY also 
provided vital support. When I first 
spoke to her about the Solarium re-
port, she immediately got why leader-
ship in the White House was so impor-
tant. In addition to joining the Na-
tional Cyber Director Act as an origi-
nal cosponsor, she convened a legisla-
tive hearing that teed up consideration 
on the House floor. The witnesses at 
that 
hearing—former 
House 
Intel-
ligence 
Committee 
Chairman 
MIKE 
ROGERS, former Obama Cybersecurity 
Coordinator Michael Daniel, Tenable 
CEO 
Amit 
Yoran, 
and 
Suzanne 
Spaulding—made a clear and compel-
ling case for an expedited consider-
ation of the bill. 
Chairman JIM
MCGOVERN
and his 
Rules Committee colleagues took up 
this charge, ruling in order an amend-
ment consisting of the text of H.R. 7331 
during our floor debate on the NDAA.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6901 
December 7, 2020 
As my colleagues well know, passing 
the House is only half the battle. Here 
is where my fellow legislative commis-
sioners really carried the day: 
Senator BEN
SASSE, who authored 
the legislation to create the Cyber-
space 
Solarium 
Commission, 
made 
more efficiently organizing the govern-
ment a central part of his push for im-
proved cybersecurity. 
Our colleague and Solarium co-chair, 
Congressman MIKE
GALLAGHER, has 
been with me every step of the way, on 
the National Cyber Director and the 16 
other Solarium provisions we moved 
through the NDAA process. 
Anyone who claims bipartisanship is 
dead in Washington has not met these 
two exemplars of comity and serious 
policy deliberativeness. 
In the Senate, my counterpart, the 
chair of the Senate Armed Services 
Committee’s Subcommittee on Cyber-
security, Senator MIKE
ROUNDS, has 
been a negotiating partner without 
equal. Senator ROUNDS came to the 
table with an open mind, asked tough 
but fair questions, requested additional 
information about our proposal, and, at 
the end of the day, helped to strength-
en it and push it through the con-
ference process. 
I also thank Congressman KATKO, 
who went to bat for the National Cyber 
Director in conversations with the 
White House. 
A special note of thanks is reserved 
for our other Solarium co-chair, Sen-
ator ANGUS
KING. Senator KING
has 
been the soul of the Solarium Commis-
sion, and I continue to be in awe of his 
steady leadership throughout the proc-
ess. Senator KING’s maxims—whether 
that ‘‘sloppy structure leads to sloppy 
policy’’ or that we needed ‘‘one throat 
to choke’’ in the executive branch— 
perfectly 
encapsulate 
the 
central 
theme and issues at stake. I can say for 
a fact that no one fought harder to en-
sure that the Senate accepted a strong 
version of the National Cyber Director 
Act in the conference process. 
Finally, Mr. Speaker, as all of my 
colleagues know, we would be lost in 
this institution without the staff that 
supports us. I never would have begun 
this journey in cybersecurity policy if 
it were not for Jake Olcott, my former 
staff director on the Committee on 
Homeland Security’s Subcommittee on 
Emerging Threats, Cyber Security, and 
Science and Technology. 
Likewise, my then-MLA Davis Hake 
helped draft and introduce the Execu-
tive Cyberspace Authorities Act of 2010 
that provided the scaffolding for the 
National Cyber Director Act; and his 
successor, Michael Hermann, further 
refined the concept. 
The Solarium Commission staff has 
been, frankly, extraordinary to work 
with and a great testament to the com-
mission’s executive director, Admiral 
Mark Montgomery. From day one, 
Mark challenged us to draft a report 
that would be actionable, not just a 
doorstop, and this NDAA is a realiza-
tion of his vision and his unflagging 
work ethic. 
My fellow legislators’ Solarium liai-
sons—Steve Smith on Senator KING’s 
staff, Chas Morrison on Congressman 
GALLAGHER’s, and Brett Fetterly on 
Senator SASSE’s—stepped up to ensure 
that all of the oars stayed rowing in 
the same direction, no matter how 
choppy the waters. 
We would never have had a hearing 
on the bill were it not for Emily Burns 
of Chairwoman MALONEY’s staff. Lori 
Ismail was our critical link at the 
Rules Committee to ensure the bill 
would have the opportunity to be de-
bated and voted upon. 
On the Senate side, Jeff Rothblum 
from Ranking Member PETER’s staff 
helped us navigate the jurisdictional 
hurdles that come with any piece of cy-
bersecurity legislation and offered in-
sightful 
comments 
and 
guidance 
throughout the process. 
During the conference process itself, 
we relied heavily on Katie Sutton and 
Kirk McConnell, two true pros on the 
Senate 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
staff; and Eric Snelgrove, staff lead for 
Ranking Member ELISE STEFANIK. 
Lastly, but surely not least, I want 
to acknowledge my own staff. My 
MLA, Caroline Goodson, ably assisted 
by our defense fellow, Captain Mike 
Lake, thrived in her first NDAA and 
expertly balanced the many priorities I 
have within my IETC portfolio and for 
my constituents in Rhode Island. 
My cybersecurity fellows David Wag-
ner, Eric Saund, and particularly Alli-
son Browning, have all been brilliant 
minds and wonderful team players who 
have helped me get the most out of the 
Solarium Commission. 
At the end of the day, though, this 
bill never would have gotten done with-
out my IETC cyber lead, Josh Stiefel. 
Josh immediately understood the im-
portance of the National Cyber Direc-
tor, based on his time working on cy-
bersecurity in the interagency. Using 
that experience and his skill at negoti-
ating, he definitely steered the Na-
tional Cyber Director Act—and more 
than two dozen other Solarium rec-
ommendations—through 
the 
NDAA. 
One of the hardest things to do is to 
entrust someone else with something 
of great value to you, but I never had 
any hesitation letting Josh work the 
staff-level discussions. I am incredibly 
lucky to have him on my team. 
Finally, and most importantly, the 
National Cyber Director Act, the doz-
ens of other Solarium recommenda-
tions, and countless other cyber initia-
tives that I have developed over the 
years would never have existed were it 
not for my legislative director, Nick 
Leiserson. Nick has been the engine on 
my cyber policy work for 6 years. His 
legislative expertise and commitment 
to advancing effective cybersecurity 
policy have elevated the cyber discus-
sion on Capitol Hill and kept our coun-
try safer. He has worked tirelessly for 
many years, and I am deeply grateful 
for how he has turned the National 
Cyber Director idea into legislation 
and finally into reality. 
Mr. Speaker, this year’s NDAA is one 
of the most important pieces of cyber-
security legislation ever to be consid-
ered by Congress. There are so many 
cyber provisions—from creating the 
Joint Cyber Planning Office at the Cy-
bersecurity and Infrastructure Secu-
rity Agency to requiring a cyber force 
structure assessment—that we had to 
create a new title for the bill. But the 
crown jewel is the National Cyber Di-
rector Act. 
I look forward to working with Presi-
dent Biden, Vice President HARRIS, and 
the new administration to stand up 
this office. I have often said that there 
are no silver bullets in cybersecurity 
policymaking, and I still believe that. 
But I know that I will sleep more 
soundly knowing that there is a cen-
tral coordinating figure in the White 
House empowered to protect the coun-
try. I hope that the legacy of this bill 
will be safety, security, and stability in 
cyberspace for decades to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

S7225 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, DECEMBER 7, 2020 
No. 206 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Great 
Redeemer, 
guide 
our 
law-
makers along the best path to fulfill 
Your purposes on Earth. May they sub-
mit to Your wisdom and providential 
leading, believing that You will supply 
all of their needs. Remind them that 
Your unfailing love accompanies those 
who put their trust in You. 
Lord, give our Senators an attitude 
of reverential awe that will keep them 
from evil and inspire them to rejoice 
and be glad as they strive to live lives 
of purity and obedience. 
And, Lord, as we remember Pearl 
Harbor on this December 7, thank You 
for Your loving and prevailing provi-
dence. May we show our gratitude by 
facing the future without fear. 
We pray in Your majestic Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNIZING IOWA STATE 
UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
want to visit with my colleagues about 
something that hasn’t happened in 
Iowa for over 100 years. Over the week-
end, the Iowa State football team com-
pleted their regular season play. The 
Cyclones are having a noteworthy sea-
son. They secured the first place rank 
in the Big 12 Conference’s regular sea-
son after winning five consecutive con-
ference games and eight overall con-
ference wins this season. 
The good news doesn’t stop there for 
the Iowa State football program. The 
Cyclones finished first place in league 
play, for the first time since 1912, when 
they won the Missouri Valley Con-
ference. This has earned the Cyclones 
their well-deserved spot in the Big 12 
title game on December 19, the first 
ever Big 12 championship appearance in 
Iowa State University’s history. 
I want to applaud the Cyclones for 
their historic season. So many fans, in-
cluding me, will be rooting them on for 
the Big 12 championship game. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the leadership time 
is reserved. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning 
business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Stephen Sidney Schwartz, of 
Virginia, to be a Judge of the United 
States Court of Federal Claims for a 
term of fifteen years. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, speaking 
both as a Senator from Vermont and as 
vice chairman of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee, I am speaking with 
concern about what has been hap-
pening in the Senate. 
It has been 321 days since the first 
COVID–19 case was reported in the 
United States—321 days. It has been 282 
days since the first COVID–19 death 
was reported in the United States. 
The Bureau of Labor Statistics re-
ports that the unemployment rate in 
November was 6.7 percent, nearly dou-
ble the rate in November of last year. 
Hundreds of thousands of small busi-
nesses across the country have closed 
permanently, all due to COVID. 
As of today, there are more than 
14,800,000 reported cases of COVID–19 in 
the United States. To put that in per-
spective, that is 1 million more than 
just a week ago. More than 282,000 
Americans have died, and it has been 
256 days since the Senate passed the 
CARES Act—256 days since the Senate 
acted in a comprehensive, meaningful 
way to address the real and mounting 
concerns and needs of our constituents. 
My State of Vermont is like every-
where else. Healthcare workers, care-
givers, business owners, employees, 
teachers, and students are all in need 
of support during these difficult and 
uncertain times. 
We have families wrestling with 
heightened food insecurity. People for 
the first time in their lives cannot feed 
their children and they cannot feed 
themselves. They have the threat of 
eviction from their homes hanging over 
them.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7226 
December 7, 2020 
We have States that are strapped by 
budget shortfalls and are forced to lay 
off thousands of employees, people who 
have worked so hard for the people of 
their State. 
It has been 205 days since the House 
first passed the Heroes Act, and it has 
been 65 days since they stepped forward 
to offer a substantial compromise on 
the Heroes Act and passed it again. 
And where does it sit? It sits on my 
friend the Republican leader’s desk. It 
is collecting dust. It is the largest and 
most significant bill in the McConnell 
legislative graveyard. 
Why aren’t we voting? Look what 
happens. We can’t even bring ourselves 
to actually vote on something to help 
Americans, to help the people of our 
own States. They are being thrown out 
of their houses, their apartments, and 
out of their jobs, and we come in for a 
few days and then get on an airplane 
and fly back home, and the taxpayers 
pay for it, taxpayers paying our sala-
ries and all and nothing happens. 
Now, like millions of Americans, I 
am encouraged by the news of recent 
weeks that pharmaceutical companies 
are making significant progress on vac-
cine development. I am encouraged 
that some of these vaccines may be 
available as early as later this month. 
Let’s not forget why we were able to 
develop vaccines so quickly. It is be-
cause of longstanding Federal invest-
ment in cutting-edge research at the 
National Institutes of Health—research 
that has been backed by so many of us 
in both parties for years in this body. 
NIH funded research in genetic and 
genomic sequencing and enabled the 
research of COVID–19 that led to the 
vaccine. This is the power of Federal 
dollars when it is targeted to solve a 
national—a 
national—problem. 
We 
need more of that today. 
The development of several promised 
vaccines is great news, but if you don’t 
have a comprehensive plan in place and 
resources implemented, how can we be 
sure the vaccination is safe, effective, 
widely available, and free? 
Can anybody stand up and say that 
every part of their State will have vac-
cination? No, the money is not there 
yet, and we haven’t done anything on 
that. It is a complete abdication of our 
responsibility as elected Representa-
tives that we have simply failed to act. 
Now, I know that my friends across 
the aisle will probably rush to the 
floor, and they will blame Democrats 
for stalling on their inadequate, face- 
saving proposal that they went through 
the motions to bring before the elec-
tions. Remember what it was. It was a 
give-away to insurance companies, and 
they didn’t even have the courage to 
allow amendments for people to actu-
ally have to vote up or down. It is easi-
er to make a face-saving gesture know-
ing it would not go anywhere. 
Sure, it made some investments in 
small businesses. It provided some em-
ployment relief, albeit at a signifi-
cantly reduced level. But it also tied 
educational relief to forcing kids back 
into the classroom, even if it is an area 
where it was not safe to accommodate 
those children. 
It failed to deliver on relief to State 
and local governments, which are con-
tinuing to try to provide essential serv-
ices to their communities, as our gov-
ernment is in Vermont. It included 
nothing for Low Income Home Energy 
Assistance, or LIHEAP. And it was 
snowing in our State and in a lot of 
other northern States this weekend. It 
had no funding for mental health serv-
ices. Can you imagine what is going 
on—no funding for mental health serv-
ice? There is no funding for nutrition 
assistance. There wasn’t a dime for 
NIH research. And it didn’t have a 
plan—a vigorous plan—or an invest-
ment in vaccination production and 
distribution. 
It is one thing to say we have these 
supercold things on an airplane. Won-
derful. When are you going to be able 
to bring it to our factories, our schools, 
our hospitals, and our senior citizens 
and actually vaccinate them? 
So what was the legislation brought 
up here? It created a shield for cor-
porate misconduct. And what it said is 
that my friends, the Republicans, are 
more keen to shield corporate cronies 
than to work on behalf of the American 
people. That is a sham. It is a shame, 
especially when you find that at least 
in one of those corporations that want 
a shield, the managers were betting on 
who would get COVID first. 
In my home State of Vermont, our 
Governor and our State legislature, our 
mayors, and our town leaders across 
State have taken bold moves to slow 
the spread of COVID. Our Governor is 
Republican, and I am a Democrat. I 
praise him for what he did. I talked 
with him again today about the steps 
he has taken—difficult steps, hard 
steps, but steps to keep Vermonters 
safe. And these moves taken in my 
State of Vermont resulted in lower in-
stances of the virus than anywhere else 
in the country. But as the Governor 
said and what I have said and every-
body else has said, they have come 
with a cost. We have kept people safe, 
but not without a cost. Unemployment 
remains. Small businesses continue to 
struggle, if they are even able to stay 
in existence. That says nothing of the 
personal hardship families are facing 
across our small State. 
One elderly woman called my office. 
She expressed frustration with the 
President. She told may staff that she 
has only been able to visit her husband, 
who is in a medical rehab facility, a 
couple of times during this pandemic 
due to COVID restrictions. That is not 
an anecdote. That is a personal trag-
edy. 
In Vermont, the State and local gov-
ernments are worrying about how to 
clear the roads this winter if COVID 
hits the plow crews. Snow removal 
isn’t a luxury in Vermont in the win-
ter. It is a necessity. We sometimes 
have 7, 8, 9, 10 inches of snow over-
night. But we expect our businesses 
and our schools to open that day. I 
don’t know how many times, at home, 
on a snowy night, I wake at 4:30 in the 
morning as I hear the snowplows going 
by on the road, and I know I can get to 
my office a couple of hours later—and 
we have had nearly a foot of snow. 
My staff spoke with one Vermont 
mother—not unusual. She is raising a 
son with autism. With school systems 
strained to their limits, special edu-
cation services have been sharply re-
duced. That is going to have a lasting 
impact on these students, both educa-
tionally and socially. 
For those who are facing challenges 
like addiction, depression, or mental 
health issues—and that can be any one 
of our States—or who were simply 
down on their luck before COVID hit 
earlier this year, access to vital re-
sources like counseling or intervention 
has been made more complicated by 
COVID restrictions, often with tragic 
results. 
I heard of one Vermonter who passed 
away alone in a motel room in Rutland 
in October. Battling mental health 
issues, he had become homeless just as 
COVID struck earlier this year. And 
due to the risks of the virus, family 
and friends were unable to take him 
into their homes. This isn’t just a 
story. It is a man’s life. And there are 
so many more people out there facing 
the same struggles. 
We are seeing images of car lines at 
food banks stretching for miles, as an 
unprecedented wave of food insecurity 
is washing over our country. In my 
State 
alone, 
one 
in 
every 
four 
Vermonters are now food insecure. Be-
fore this pandemic, it was already an 
unacceptable 1 in 10. 
We are asking children to learn with-
out providing the necessary resources 
their teachers need. We are asking fam-
ilies to pay rent without their jobs and 
for people to deal with their chronic 
illnesses while our hospitals are still 
stretched to capacity. All of this is 
while an unacceptable amount of peo-
ple are unsure how they will put food 
on the table through the end of the 
week in the wealthiest Nation on 
Earth. That is unconscionable. 
I must say that the leadership across 
the aisle has got to bring up these bills. 
Stop stalling. You know, they say we 
only need a targeted approach, and 
they point to the stock market as 
proof. These people who are out of jobs 
aren’t looking at the stock market. 
These people who can’t feed their chil-
dren aren’t looking at the stock mar-
ket. For these people whose rent has 
come due and they can’t pay it, to 
them that is nonsense. 
The economy is not going to recover 
until we have vanquished the virus. It 
is that simple. It is that basic. And 
people are suffering now. That is the 
cost of inaction—inaction on real, com-
prehensive, COVID relief legislation. 
Now with our backs against the wall 
with a funding deadline looming, we 
are racing to accomplish what should

December 7, 2020 
have been done months ago: annual ap-
propriations bills to keep our govern-
ment running. We were ready on this 
side of the aisle to vote on those back 
in June and have a couple of amend-
ments up or down. Republicans, in the 
majority, if they didn’t like a Demo-
cratic amendment, they could vote it 
down. We could have done it back then. 
Now the deadline is this week, months 
later. We have to pass these bills before 
Congress adjourns this year so there is 
no disruption in our government, in 
our services during this difficult time 
in our country. It will only exacerbate 
the growing problems facing many 
Americans today. But our annual ap-
propriations bills are no substitute for 
the significant investment we need to 
confront 
this 
national 
and 
inter-
national emergency. We need a com-
prehensive COVID relief bill. 
It is time to get serious. Instead of 
flying off every weekend back home, 
stay here. Vote these things up or 
down. Bring up amendments on both 
sides of the aisle. Have an agreement 
on the amendments and vote them up 
or down, because time is wasted. 
How many hours have we spent rac-
ing to confirm nomination after nomi-
nation at the expense of everything 
else, including dealing with the emer-
gency of this pandemic, while COVID 
cases soar and more and more people 
succumb to this virus? How much more 
time will the Senate waste while Amer-
ican families and communities suffer? 
It is time for us to do our job. We are 
elected for 6-year terms. Let’s stay 
here for 6 days during the week, if need 
be. Let’s get it done. The American 
people 
are 
suffering 
enough. 
We 
shouldn’t be adding to that strain by 
playing politics with these essential 
priorities. 
I am hearing from Vermonters every 
day, worried about unemployment ben-
efits, their children’s education, their 
health or for that of their loved ones, 
about food security, about keeping 
their homes and paying their bills. 
The Senate, when it has been at its 
best, has been the conscience of the Na-
tion. It is long past time that we start-
ed acting like the conscience of the Na-
tion. It has been 256 days since the Sen-
ate took meaningful action on this 
COVID epidemic. We shouldn’t wait a 
day longer. Let’s set everything else 
aside. Let’s have votes on these pro-
grams. Let’s vote up or down. This 
Senator is ready to do that. 
I see the distinguished leader on the 
floor. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
we have reached the time of year when 
the Senate has more important out-
standing business than we have days to 
complete it. Delivering for the Amer-
ican people will take focus, dexterity, 
and genuine bipartisanship. On govern-
ment funding, as I have said for weeks, 
it is my hope that our committees’ 
work will bear fruit and a full-year 
funding package will come to the floor 
in both Chambers. 
I anticipate that the Senate will take 
up a 1-week extension this week so the 
government does not close on Decem-
ber 11 and work can continue through 
the end of next week. 
The Nation needs our Democratic 
colleagues to resist the temptation to 
play brinksmanship with long-settled 
policy issues or push poison-pill riders 
that they know would tank the proc-
ess. 
We also expect to receive and pass a 
conference report on the annual De-
fense authorization. And we need to 
continue confirming nominees to va-
cancies in the judiciary and the execu-
tive branch. 
We Senators are no strangers to the 
end-of-year drama, but this time the 
stakes are far higher. We are up 
against another, even steeper surge in 
COVID–19 than we saw back in the 
spring. Workers and small businesses 
are once again struggling to make ends 
meet as States and localities step up 
precautions. 
And while the latest news on the vac-
cine trials suggest that victory over 
the virus may soon be within reach, 
our work in that area is far from com-
plete. As one recent article put it, 
‘‘State [and] local officials plead for 
vaccine distribution funds.’’ 
Our Nation’s historic sprint to vic-
tory through vaccines seems poised to 
succeed in record time, but the critical 
last step—hundreds of millions of doses 
out to the American people—is still in 
front of us. Congress cannot stay on 
the sidelines. 
Yesterday, our colleague from Illi-
nois, the Democratic whip, gave an 
interview in which he named three ex-
amples of highly urgent matters that 
need to be addressed for our Nation 
right now. This is the Democratic whip 
of the U.S. Senate. 
Here are the three things Senator 
DURBIN mentioned as flashing red, ur-
gent priorities: ‘‘The millions of people 
who are going to . . . lose their unem-
ployment 
insurance 
the 
day 
after 
Christmas’’; ‘‘the businesses that are 
trying to decide . . . whether or not 
they can continue’’; and ‘‘the [vaccine] 
logistics . . . to make sure that this 
vaccine is on the road and vaccinating 
people across America as quickly as 
possible.’’ 
Those are the three things he men-
tioned. Those are the three urgent 
issues he named as examples: extending 
unemployment 
insurance, 
helping 
small businesses, and funding vaccine 
distribution. 
Well, I do not question the sincerity 
of our colleague, who I believe is en-
gaged in these discussions in good 
faith. But these comments illustrate 
perfectly a point that Republicans have 
been making for weeks. These three ur-
gent issues are issues where there is al-
most total bipartisan consensus, no 
real disagreement whatsoever. 
In fact, the framework for a small, 
targeted relief package that I put for-
ward last week—something Democrats 
quickly attacked—would have resolved 
all three of those subjects. The tar-
geted Republican framework extends 
unemployment 
insurance 
programs 
that will otherwise expire; it creates an 
entire second round of the Paycheck 
Protection Program for the hardest hit 
small businesses; and it lays ground-
work to distribute the vaccines that 
appear to be on the horizon. Check, 
check, and check. 
The Democratic whip is right to rec-
ognize these three subjects as espe-
cially urgent because they are espe-
cially urgent. That is why Republicans 
have been trying over and over to get 
them passed. That is why Republicans 
have been saying for months that 
Speaker PELOSI
and the Democratic 
leader should let Congress get out-
comes in all of the places where we al-
ready agree rather than holding every-
thing hostage over their most con-
troversial, partisan demands. 
But month after month after month, 
it has been the Democratic leaders who 
have said that no relief whatsoever can 
pass, no consensus items can become 
law unless multiple controversial areas 
where we don’t agree are resolved to 
the Democrats’ liking. 
That is why the Democratic leader 
had every single Senate Democratic 
vote to filibuster a targeted COVID–19 
relief package back in September and 
again in October. That bill would have 
taken care of small businesses, unem-
ployment insurance, and vaccine dis-
tribution months ago. Senate Demo-
crats blocked it. 
I think, if the Senate Democratic 
leader would allow it, the three things 
that the Democratic whip mentioned 
just yesterday—small business aid, re-
upping unemployment aid, and setting 
up vaccine distribution—would pass 
the Senate in a landslide. 
A targeted compromise on the most 
urgent items would pass by a massive 
bipartisan margin. We could easily put 
together a whole slew of commonsense 
policies—including 
those 
three 
and 
other things, like legal protections 
that universities and the American 
Council on Education have been plead-
ing for—bring it to the floor, and pass 
it. 
Everyone knows why this hasn’t hap-
pened. There is one reason the Speaker 
of the House and the Democratic leader 
have spent months tying the most bi-
partisan, most commonsense policies 
to their most controversial requests 
and saying that the country can’t get 
the former unless they get the latter. 
Their strategy has been all or nothing, 
so 
struggling 
Americans 
have, 
of 
course, gotten nothing. 
Well, we are down to the wire. The 
light at the end of the tunnel is in 
sight. Operation Warp Speed seems 
poised to deliver vaccines on a historic, 
almost miraculous timetable. We have 
seen some hopeful signs of engagement 
from our Democratic colleagues, but

we have no reason to think the under-
lying disagreements about policy are 
going to evaporate overnight. 
Republicans and Democrats do not 
need to resolve every one of our dif-
ferences to get badly needed relief out 
the door. We just need both sides to fi-
nally do what Members of Congress do 
when they are serious about wanting 
an outcome: Drop the all-or-nothing 
tactics; drop the hostage-taking; and 
make law in the many places where we 
have common ground. That is what the 
country is counting on. That is how we 
can do right by the American people 
before Christmas. Let’s get it done.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The

OFFICER. 
The

REMEMBERING PAUL SARBANES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last night we received the sad news 
that a former colleague of ours, one of 
our finest, Paul Sarbanes, had passed 
away. 
While our time in the Senate only 
overlapped for one term, Senator Sar-
banes made a deep impression. Known 
as the ‘‘stealth Senator,’’ he was low- 
key but extremely effective. He was a 
leader on a wide-ranging group of 
issues, from environmental steward-
ship, to consumer privacy, to anything 
having to do with his home State of 
Maryland. He was very soft-spoken, but 
he had determination like iron and 
worked and worked and worked on 
issue after issue until he achieved his 
goals. 
We mourn the passing of this beloved 
former colleague and this consummate 
Senator. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, now on COVID, ev-
eryone knows we are entering the 
worst stretch of the COVID–19 pan-
demic. As winter months force more 
Americans indoors, infections are up, 
hospitalizations are up, and the num-
ber of Americans dying from COVID is 
steadily and tragically increasing. 
The economic fallout from the latest 
wave of the virus will also be a huge 
challenge. According to one study, 
nearly 12 million renters will owe an 
average of nearly $6,000 in back rents 
and utilities in January. Even the con-
servative U.S. Chamber of Commerce is 
sounding the alarm about a double-dip 
recession if Congress does not pass an-
other round of emergency Federal re-
lief before the end of the year. 
Unfortunately, our efforts to pass an-
other emergency relief bill through the 
Senate have been stalled until now for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7229 
December 7, 2020 
one reason: The Republican leader has 
refused to compromise. Again, today 
we heard the same old song from the 
Republican leader. His position has not 
budged since March. First, he put the 
Senate on pause while the spread of the 
virus got worse and worse. Then, after 
pressure mounted, the Republican lead-
er finally decided to put forward a se-
ries of bills that comprised only the 
things the Republicans want. 
While the Nation has been clamoring 
for a bipartisan solution, the Senate, 
under the leadership of the Republican 
leader, has only been allowed to vote 
on partisan Republican proposals, each 
of which has been sorely inadequate 
and each of which has contained poison 
pills designed to ensure the bill’s fail-
ure. 
The Republican leader never men-
tions those poison pills in his speeches 
to this Chamber where he excoriates 
Democrats for refusing to pass ‘‘bipar-
tisan legislation’’ that everyone agrees 
on. But ‘‘bipartisan’’ does not mean 
Democrats must agree to whatever the 
Republican leader wants or whatever 
issues he picks. ‘‘Bipartisan’’ means 
both sides sitting down and finding an 
agreement. We all know that is the 
case. 
We have a Democratic House. They 
are going to need Democratic votes in 
the Senate. So Senate Democrats are 
simply asking the Republican leader to 
do one thing: Sit down and negotiate. 
Now, since March, since Secretary 
Mnuchin and I negotiated the CARES 
bill, the Republican leader has con-
stantly refused to sit down with Repub-
licans and negotiate a bipartisan solu-
tion. He puts his bill—with no Demo-
cratic input—on the floor and says, 
‘‘Take it or leave it.’’ That is no way— 
no way—to get things done. It wasn’t 
in April or May or June or July or Au-
gust or September or November, and it 
isn’t now. 
We want the leader to sit down and 
negotiate so we can come up with a bi-
partisan proposal that can pass both 
the House and the Senate. And Speaker 
PELOSI and I have modified our pro-
posal several times in an effort to meet 
our Republican counterparts in the 
middle. Last week, Speaker PELOSI and 
I went even further and agreed to use a 
bipartisan bill, crafted by moderate 
Senators from both sides of the aisle, 
as a framework for the negotiations. 
We have not heard the same willing-
ness from the Republican leader. 
However, there are some encouraging 
signs. The bipartisan group of Senators 
and House Members working on this 
latest proposal continues to make 
progress. I was encouraged to see the 
Senator from Louisiana this weekend 
say he was hopeful the President would 
sign such an agreement. Let’s use the 
work of the Gang of 8 as the basis for 
bipartisan 
negotiations 
and 
com-
promise. 
The bottom line: We have to get 
something done for the American peo-
ple before the end of the year. We 
Democrats have been trying since the 
spring, back when Republicans were 
saying they did ‘‘not feel the urgency 
of acting.’’ I believe those were the 
leader’s words. 
Well, it is going to take a sense of ur-
gency now, Mr. Leader, and it is going 
to take a willingness to give a little, 
not just to put your bill on the floor 
and say: Take it or leave it. 
As I said, it is encouraging that some 
Republicans are already on that path. 
Hopefully, the Republican leader can 
catch up with the more fairminded 
Members of his caucus. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, now, on nomina-
tions—another matter. The incoming 
Biden 
administration 
continues 
to 
name candidates it will tap to lead 
Cabinet agencies and other key posi-
tions in the Federal Government. 
Today, President-Elect Biden intro-
duced his healthcare team, including 
Dr. Fauci, who will stay on—thank 
God—as Chief Medical Adviser; Dr. 
Vivek Murthy to serve as Surgeon Gen-
eral; Dr. Rochelle Walensky to head 
the CDC; and Xavier Becerra, the at-
torney general of California, to be the 
next Secretary of Health and Human 
Services. 
Like most of President-Elect Biden’s 
selections so far, Mr. Becerra’s nomina-
tion is groundbreaking. He will be the 
first Latino to ever run the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
Now, 
these 
nominees, 
once 
con-
firmed, will face a monumental task. 
President-Elect Biden will inherit a 
once-in-a-generation 
healthcare 
cri-
sis—a crisis made worse by the Trump 
administration’s lack of focus, com-
petency, and consistency over the past 
year. 
By naming a deeply experienced and 
tested team of senior healthcare advis-
ers, President-Elect Biden is getting 
ready to right the ship and execute a 
whole-of-government 
approach 
to 
crushing the virus and providing af-
fordable healthcare to all Americans. 
As safe and effective vaccines become 
available over the next year, President- 
Elect Biden’s team will also have to 
work with States and healthcare pro-
viders to get Americans vaccinated. 
To state the obvious, healthcare is 
going to be the No. 1 challenge when 
the new administration takes office. 
We are in the middle of a once-in-a- 
century public health crisis. Accord-
ingly, President-Elect Biden’s team 
should be confirmed swiftly to ensure 
that no time is lost in the fight against 
the pandemic. 
Regrettably, there is a split screen 
this week between the seriousness of 
the incoming Biden administration and 
the activities of the Republican major-
ity here in the Senate. 
On Tuesday, the Republican chair-
man of the Homeland Security Com-
mittee has invited Dr. Jane Orient to 
give testimony at a hearing in his com-
mittee. Dr. Orient is a member of the 
Association of American Physicians 
and Surgeons—a benign-sounding name 
that obscures some dangerous policies. 
According to the New York Times, 
Dr. Orient’s association ‘‘opposes gov-
ernment involvement in medicine and 
views Federal vaccine mandates as a 
violation of human rights.’’ 
Dr. Orient herself has expressed skep-
ticism about coronavirus vaccines and 
continues to hawk hydroxychloroquine 
as a COVID–19 treatment, following the 
lead of President Trump, who boosted 
the drug despite scientific evidence 
that it is ineffective. 
So while President-Elect Biden is 
nominating 
experienced, 
committed 
public servants to lead the next admin-
istration’s healthcare policy, the Re-
publican majority is inviting promi-
nent anti-vaxxers to Senate committee 
hearings—a study in contrasts, to say 
the least. 
After one of the most difficult years 
in recent memory, we finally have a 
light at the end of the tunnel in the 
discovery of several effective and safe 
vaccines. They are the best chance we 
have of ending the terrible scourge of 
this disease and getting our lives back 
to normal. 
And yet, the effectiveness of the vac-
cine only matters insofar as the num-
ber of Americans who are willing to 
take it. The more Senate Republicans 
dip their toes into the water of these 
anti-science, anti-vax conspiracy theo-
ries, the more damage it does to our 
country. Public figures at all levels 
should be building up confidence in a 
vaccine, not giving a platform to those 
who would undermine it. 
The Senator from Wisconsin, the 
chairman of the Homeland Security 
Committee, should revoke his invita-
tion to Dr. Orient. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
came to the floor to talk about some 
other things, but I just want to say in 
response to our friend, the Democratic 
leader, it sounds to me that he has got 
a case of ‘‘do as I say, not as I do’’ 
when it comes to COVID–19 relief bills. 
If my memory serves me correctly, 
he has led the effort to block the Sen-
ate’s consideration of five different 
COVID–19 relief bills. 
Speaker PELOSI has made the incred-
ible statement that ‘‘nothing is better 
than something’’ when it comes to 
COVID–19 relief. That is easy to say 
when you are still getting a paycheck, 
when you have a job you can go do, and 
you can provide for your family, and 
you have access to healthcare. 
But for the millions of Americans 
who have suffered through this pan-
demic, those are words that sound a lot 
like Marie Antoinette: ‘‘Let them eat 
cake.’’ 
I mention this because I have been 
around this place long enough to know 
that, unless you tell people the whole 
story, too often they believe the talk-
ing points and the half story or the in-
complete story, like we heard from the 
Democratic leader.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7230 
December 7, 2020 
It is shameful that, after passing four 
separate COVID–19 relief bills, includ-
ing the CARES Act, through the end of 
March on a virtually unanimous basis, 
that Speaker PELOSI chose to pass a 
partisan bill out of the House, the He-
roes bill, for another $3 trillion, includ-
ing things like tax breaks for million-
aires and billionaires in New York and 
San 
Francisco, 
unrelated 
to 
the 
COVID–19 relief bill that we needed. 
So I applaud the group of bipartisan 
Senators who have been working now, 
after the election, to try to come up 
with the relief rather than kicking this 
can down the road and leaving people 
in the lurch during the Christmas holi-
day season. 
And then when it comes to a vaccine, 
I have no doubt that the incoming ad-
ministration is going to claim com-
plete credit for producing a vaccine 
and getting this virus in the rearview 
mirror. 
I understand why they would be 
tempted to do so, but it is because of 
the bipartisan action that Congress has 
taken 
with 
this 
administration 
through Operation Warp Speed that we 
have seen our world-class scientists 
come up with safe and effective, I hope, 
soon-to-be-certified vaccines by the 
Food and Drug Administration, and 
people can begin to start getting vac-
cinated by the middle of this month. 
That is a modern-day miracle. We 
should all be proud of it, but it should 
not be part of a partisan campaign now 
after we have had an election on No-
vember 3. 
I wish our friends would get out of 
the campaign mode and get into the 
governing mode. We have got impor-
tant work we need to do here. 
JENNA QUINN LAW 
Madam President, part of that is the 
Jenna Quinn Law. This bipartisan 
piece of legislation that I introduced 
with Senator HASSAN over a year and a 
half ago to help identify and stop child 
sexual abuse in communities across our 
country has passed the Senate unani-
mously but is stuck in the House of 
Representatives. 
Nationwide, there are more than 
42,000 survivors of child sex abuse— 
adults now, 42 million adult survivors 
of child sexual abuse. 
Sadly, these victims often stay silent 
for days, months, years, even a life-
time. As a result, they and countless 
other victims continue to be abused. 
We need to stop this cycle as quickly 
as possible, and that is why the Jenna 
Quinn Law is so important. 
It is modeled after a 2009 Texas law, 
which requires teachers, caregivers, 
and other adults who work with chil-
dren to receive training on how to 
identify and report child sexual abuse. 
After the Texas law passed in 2009, 
one study found educators reported 
child sexual abuse at a rate almost four 
times greater after the training than 
they got during their pretraining ca-
reer. 
Jenna Quinn herself tells the story of 
her own mother saying: If I had just 
known that you were showing all the 
classic symptoms of a victim of child 
sexual abuse, I would have intervened 
sooner. 
Well, the 2009 Texas law was one of 
the first to mandate this training, and 
now more than half of all the States 
have adopted a form of Jenna’s Law. So 
you may ask: Why do we need to pass 
a Federal law? Well, the States don’t 
have the funding for the training, and 
that is what the Jenna Quinn Law pro-
vides. It allows current Department of 
Health and Human Services grant 
funds to be used for this specialized 
training. 
This bill has received the support of 
every member of the Senate Health 
Committee—Republicans 
and 
Demo-
crats, not surprisingly—and it has 
passed the Senate unanimously, but it 
has been months, and we are still wait-
ing for the House of Representatives to 
act. 
Just last week, House Democrats, 
under Speaker PELOSI, did find time to 
act on a bill to decriminalize mari-
juana; on a bill to deal with large cats, 
the ‘‘Tiger King’’ bill. But did they 
have time to provide assistance to 
small businesses? Did they find time to 
pass bipartisan COVID–19 relief? Did 
they find time to pass the Jenna Quinn 
Law, which I am sure, if put on their 
suspension calendar, would pass very 
quickly and go to the President for his 
signature? 
In a move that defies common sense, 
the chairman of the Education and 
Labor Committee in the House, Con-
gressman BOBBY SCOTT, is blocking— 
blocking—the Jenna Quinn Law. 
He voted to decriminalize marijuana; 
he voted to ban the private ownership 
of big cats, but he won’t even let the 
Jenna Quinn Law receive an up-or- 
down vote on the floor of the House of 
Representatives. 
Well, if you are confused by the logic 
of this move, you are not alone, espe-
cially because the urgency for this leg-
islation has only grown during the pan-
demic. 
As families have stayed at home as 
part of the mitigation efforts, their 
lives have been filled with a range of 
new stressors. Loss of income, isola-
tion, health anxiety, and the stress of 
teaching children at home can test 
even the healthiest families and rela-
tionships. But they also put children at 
a higher risk for abuse and neglect. 
In April of this year, nationwide re-
ports of abuse or neglect dropped an 
average of 40 percent compared to the 
same time last year. Now, ordinarily, 
you would say: Well, that is good news. 
But the reason the reports of abuse and 
neglect have dropped is because chil-
dren have not been going to their class-
rooms, where the teachers who train in 
identifying these signs and symptoms 
can see them and help them by inter-
vening. 
In 2018, two-thirds of the reports of 
child abuse were submitted by people 
who came in contact with children as 
part of their jobs. I mentioned teach-
ers, counselors, caregivers, also police 
officers, lawyers, social services, but 
predominantly teachers who see these 
children at school. 
Teachers, educational professionals, 
and other support staff at schools, like 
busdrivers, are responsible for more 
than half of the reports of child abuse. 
But as I said, with children home 
during the pandemic, out of sight from 
their teachers and other adults they 
would otherwise see on a routine basis, 
abuse is becoming more difficult to 
identify and report, not because it is 
not happening but because these chil-
dren are having to suffer silently, liv-
ing with, perhaps locked down with, 
their abuser. 
As the stresses of the pandemic and 
the lack of reporting take a violent toll 
on our children across the country, it 
is time for action, not excuses, not de-
criminalizing marijuana, not a ‘‘Tiger 
King’’ bill but passing legislation that 
will actually make their lives better, 
give them some hope—not action at 
some time in the future but now. 
And there is one person in the House 
of Representatives who is holding that 
up right now, and he is Chairman 
SCOTT. 
Children are suffering every day. 
They are not worried about politics or 
whether Chairman SCOTT has the lever-
age he needs to advance a larger par-
tisan bill later on next year. These vic-
tims are worried about their own safe-
ty. They are worried about: How much 
longer will it be until some adult iden-
tifies my abuse and gets me out of this 
abusive relationship—gets me out of a 
living nightmare? 
Well, the sort of mindless obstruction 
we are seeing from Chairman SCOTT in 
the House exemplifies everything peo-
ple loathe about Congress—holding up 
a bill to prevent child sexual abuse as 
a means to gain political leverage for a 
bigger partisan bill. It is just shameful. 
Let’s call it what it is—shameful. 
It is time for Chairman SCOTT to stop 
blocking the Jenna Quinn Law so we 
can provide training to the men and 
women most likely to stop the cycle of 
child sexual abuse. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, finally, last week 
on the Senate floor, I spoke briefly 
about our retiring colleague Senator 
MIKE ENZI, from Wyoming, and some 
wisdom he imparted to me shortly 
after I arrived in the Senate—some-
thing he calls the 80–20 rule. As my 
friend from Wyoming told me, you are 
never going to agree or disagree with 
somebody 100 percent of the time, but 
that doesn’t mean you can’t get impor-
tant work done. So instead of just fo-
cusing on the 20 percent you cannot 
agree on, look at the 80 percent you 
can agree on. 
I hope all of my colleagues will re-
member this formula for success in the 
coming days as we work to deliver an-
other round of coronavirus relief for 
the American people. It is clear that 
we are never going to agree 100 percent 
of the time on what that bill should

look like, but I bet we can agree on 80 
percent, and we ought to get that 80 
percent done. 
We all believe additional funding for 
our schools is necessary to keep our 
students and teachers healthy and kids 
on track for a good education; that 
American workers who had the rug 
pulled out from under them earlier this 
year deserve additional support; that a 
second round of job-saving Paycheck 
Protection Program funds would help 
even more workers and small busi-
nesses; and that another investment in 
vaccine distribution is essential to 
bringing this pandemic to an end. 
Last week, Leader MCCONNELL an-
nounced progress in negotiations to 
pass another bill by the end of the 
year. He has spoken with the Presi-
dent’s team and the Speaker, and there 
are hopeful signs. There appears to be a 
path forward on this legislation that 
could clear both Chambers and receive 
the signature of the President, and I 
hope we will follow that path to a con-
structive conclusion. 
As I said last week, the best Christ-
mas present we can give the American 
people would be to work together in a 
bipartisan way to provide that relief. 
We need an outcome, and to get there 
is going to take compromise. It is 
going to take the 80–20 rule. 
This 
process 
requires 
input 
and 
agreement from our colleagues in the 
Senate, the House, and the White 
House, as does all legislation. But my 
constituents—and, 
I 
dare 
say, 
all 
Americans—are fed up with the dys-
function they see and the partisanship 
that is for no real purpose that has de-
layed this COVID–19 relief bill for 
months. 
It is time to reach an agreement and 
deliver 
yet 
another 
round 
of 
coronavirus relief for the American 
people. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
NEZ PERCE-CLEARWATER NATIONAL FORESTS 
Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I rise 
today to highlight some meaningful 
progress underway on the Nez Perce- 
Clearwater National Forests to im-
prove the health of these forests. These 
collaborative 
efforts 
are 
showing 
progress, and they are an example of 
where we can go nationally. 
Collaboration brings results. I have 
been a longtime champion of collabora-
tion to address public lands manage-
ment disputes, as collaborative proc-
esses are good for the environment and 
good for natural-resource based econo-
mies. Collaborative problem-solving is 
a key way to ensure that all voices are 
heard and long-term solutions are 
crafted. 
Working together through collabora-
tion does not require a sacrifice of 
principles, but it does require earnest 
negotiations with respect for ideas 
from all perspectives and a willingness 
to work to understand each other’s ob-
jectives. Inevitably, at several points 
along the collaborative path, there are 
strong disagreements. However, par-
ticipants’ refusal to quit is a key at-
tribute of successful collaborative ef-
forts. 
One of the greatest benefits of col-
laboration 
is 
that 
it 
enables 
the 
achievement of solutions that are bet-
ter than the status quo for all stake-
holders. Such solutions are better for 
the environment and the economy. 
Through 
collaboration, 
participants 
can actually achieve their objectives 
and in ways that benefit the entire 
community. 
The work on the Nez Perce-Clear-
water National Forests is a great ex-
ample of the benefits of collaborative 
efforts. The Clearwater Basin Collabo-
rative, or CBC, as we call it, which was 
officially launched 12 years ago, has 
had an important role in furthering 
discussions about the management of 
the 
Nez 
Perce-Clearwater 
National 
Forests. Nez Perce Tribal representa-
tives, representatives of Federal and 
State agencies, county commissioners, 
local communities, timber companies, 
conservation groups, and other stake-
holders make up the CBC’s Working 
Group, which accommodates a diverse 
array of viewpoints and objectives. 
I met with members of the prede-
cessor group, called the Konkolville 
Collaborative, and welcomed the oppor-
tunity to be a part of the CBC’s official 
launch in 2008. I track the group’s 
progress through dedicating a member 
of my staff to being part of its discus-
sions focused on resolving longstanding 
concerns and achieving land manage-
ment decisions and fostering commu-
nication 
among 
different 
interest 
groups. The remarkable landscape it 
works 
to 
enhance 
encompasses 
forestlands providing habitat for treas-
ured wildlife and anadromous fish spe-
cies; resources for local communities, 
including timber, livestock grazing, 
and mining; and natural carbon sinks 
that help our planet. 
The Nez Perce-Clearwater National 
Forests span 4 million acres. Three riv-
ers flow through the forests, providing 
important water sources, outstanding 
fishing, and other recreational oppor-
tunities. It is truly a remarkable place, 
and the group’s work is far from easy, 
as there is a lot at stake. 
The good news is that we are hearing 
reports of remarkable achievements 
being made on the Forests. The Nez 
Perce-Clearwater 
National 
Forests 
have received three significant recogni-
tions this year alone that highlight co-
operative restoration work: a Regional 
Forester’s Award for fostering partner-
ship and volunteerism; a Chief’s Award 
for delivering benefits to the public; 
and an Undersecretary’s Award for cus-
tomer service for the forests’ Historic 
Routes Project. 
Through the Historic Routes Project, 
the 
Nez 
Perce-Clearwater 
National 
Forests dedicated approximately $1 
million of retained receipts from stew-
ardship contracts to improve water 
quality through historically sensitive 
maintenance along three historic road-
ways: the Lolo Motorway, the Elk City 
Wagon Road, and the Magruder Road, 
which attract visitors from all over the 
country. Project leaders, recognizing 
the importance of these routes to the 
local economy and historical signifi-
cance, 
have 
partnered 
with 
local 
groups and the University of Idaho to 
include digital interpretation that is 
accessible even in locations without 
internet service. The project has also 
been supported through the Secure 
Rural 
Schools 
Resources 
Advisory 
Committee to assist with the mainte-
nance. 
Stewardship contracts have also been 
used on the Nez Perce-Clearwater Na-
tional Forests to enable the Forest 
Service to accomplish vegetation and 
watershed restoration. By leveraging 
this program with other partnerships 
and funding sources, the forests are 
able to have a truly integrated restora-
tion program. Stewardship contracts 
have enabled fuels and weed treatment, 
watershed protection and restoration, 
road maintenance, and enhancements 
such as the removal of wire fencing to 
help wildlife. 
A total of 536 miles of streams have 
been restored on the Nez Perce-Clear-
water National Forests, resulting in 
the forests being ranked fourth nation-
wide in miles of streams restored. The 
forests have a strong partnership with 
the Nez Perce Tribe, which contributes 
greatly to its watershed accomplish-
ments. At the same time, priorities of 
much needed restoration of landscapes, 
including water quality improvements, 
are also providing a supply of raw ma-
terials to our local mills. In fact, the 
forests are the fifth in the Nation in 
providing wood products for purchase. 
More work is underway to address 
significant challenges, but this is the 
direction we need to continue to go in 
delivering long-term results. I com-
mend all those involved in this effort 
for their hard and exemplary work im-
proving our treasured landscapes. 
Also, a Good Neighbor Authority pro-
gram coordinated by the Nez Perce- 
Clearwater National Forests and the 
Idaho Department of Lands was recog-
nized with the 2017 Regional Forester 
Awards. Through the program, forest 
management has supported fuels reduc-
tion and watershed restoration. Fur-
ther, the Nez Perce-Clearwater Na-
tional Forests recently signed a Good 
Neighbor Authority agreement with 
the Idaho Department of Fish and 
Game. This will enable the forests and 
the Idaho Department of Fish and 
Game to work more seamlessly as they 
collaborate on projects to enhance 
wildlife habitat such as aspen restora-
tion. 
Statewide, the Idaho Department of 
Lands reports that the agency is uti-
lizing Good Neighbor Authority to 
partner with national forests in Idaho 
to expedite projects focused on fuels re-
duction, forest health improvements, 
and watershed health. According to an 
ILD summary from January of this 
year, the program has enabled the 
treatment of 4,800 acres through 50

service contracts, at a total value of 
over $3 million to the private sector, to 
treat weed infestation, reduce fuels, 
complete road repairs, and support 
project planning and monitoring. Other 
collaborative efforts have laid strong 
groundwork or follow in the footsteps 
of collaborative work such as this. 
In Idaho we have succeeded with pub-
lic lands projects such as the Owyhee 
Initiative and are at hard at work in 
others, such as the Kootenai Valley Re-
source Initiative, the Payette Forest 
Coalition, the Boise Forest Coalition, 
and others, including our Governor’s 
Shared Stewardship Task Force. I also 
look forward to the soon-to-be com-
pleted recommendations of the Gov-
ernor’s Salmon Workgroup. 
Federal policy must empower col-
laboration and forest health. As Sen-
ators and shared stewards of these nat-
ural resources, we must continuously 
work to ensure Federal statute and 
policy empower collaborative efforts 
and forest health projects. In 2003, I 
was proud to work with my congres-
sional colleagues, including Senator 
RON WYDEN of Oregon and many oth-
ers, to enact the Healthy Forests Res-
toration Act, or HFRA, to help provide 
the U.S. Forest Service with the tools 
needed to do the necessary work on the 
ground to restore our forests and help 
reduce the threat of a catastrophic 
wildfire to our communities and eco-
systems. The HFRA was designed to 
encourage fuel reduction efforts, pro-
tect old-growth forests, enhance water 
quality, 
promote 
community-based 
land management and public involve-
ment in forest management, and ad-
dress insect and disease problems. The 
HFRA has promoted stewardship con-
tracting projects which incorporate 
public-private 
partnerships, 
empha-
sizing more localized forest manage-
ment. 
In the years since the enactment of 
the HFRA, Congress has enacted addi-
tional legislation to advance forest 
health. For example, in the 2014 farm 
bill we included permanent authority 
for stewardship contracting and the au-
thorization of Good Neighbor Author-
ity. Good Neighbor Authority expanded 
the Federal Government’s ability to 
partner with State foresters on res-
toration projects, including bark beetle 
treatments across State and Federal 
boundaries. 
Subsequently, 
the 
2018 
farm bill included an expansion of 
Good 
Neighbor 
Authority, 
credited 
with increasing the pace and scale of 
forest 
restoration 
projects 
across 
Idaho. The 2018 farm bill also, impor-
tantly, included a 10-year reauthoriza-
tion of the Collaborative Forest Land-
scape Restoration Program, which has 
enabled the expansion of active col-
laborative land-use groups in Idaho. 
The program encourages large-scale— 
that is 50,000-plus acres—collaborative, 
science-based 
forest 
restoration 
projects in a way that encourages envi-
ronmental 
and 
economic 
sustain-
ability. 
The U.S. Forest Service reported 
that in the first 10 years of the pro-
gram, 
the 
CFLRP 
opportunities 
brought together more than 420 organi-
zations 
to 
engage 
in 
local 
collaboratives, and CFLRP projects 
treated 3.8 million acres to reduce 
wildfire risk. 
The CFLRP has supported collabo-
rative work of the Clearwater Basin 
Collaborative and the Nez Perce-Clear-
water Forests to restore conditions 
within the 1.4 million-acre Selway-Mid-
dle Fork ecosystem through stream 
improvements, the replacement of cul-
verts preventing fish passage, road and 
trail maintenance, and the reduction of 
wildfire fuel loads. 
Also, the reauthorized Collaborative 
Forest Landscape Restoration Program 
has two newly approved projects in 
Idaho, with one in each region. Region 
1 encompasses the Panhandle National 
Forest, and in Region 4, it encompasses 
the Payette and Boise National For-
ests. 
We cannot let up in making progress 
on 
wildfires. 
The 
severely 
smoke- 
clogged skies this fire season made the 
impacts of the fires that have deci-
mated wildlands and communities for 
years nearly unescapable. 
As we think about the lives and live-
lihoods lost to wildfires, we must con-
tinue to work to enact bipartisan for-
est management reform to build on the 
progress made in recent years to en-
sure Federal land agencies have the 
tools they need to protect communities 
from deadly wildfires by improving the 
health of our forests. 
Bipartisan legislation pending in this 
Senate would increase the active man-
agement of Federal forests, cut red-
tape, reduce frivolous litigation, and 
advance fire risk reduction. Senators 
STEVE DAINES, of Montana, and DIANNE 
FEINSTEIN, of California, worked across 
party lines for months to negotiate the 
details of the bipartisan Emergency 
Wildfire and Public Safety Act. 
Enactment of sensible, bipartisan 
legislation such as this, which is also 
cosponsored by myself and my fellow 
colleague from Idaho, Senator JIM 
RISCH, can better enable land managers 
to reduce wildfire risk and respond ef-
fectively to an increasingly virulent 
wildfire reality. This will build on the 
successful enactment of bipartisan leg-
islation to enable Federal agencies to 
respond to wildfires as they would to 
other natural disasters and end the 
practice of fire borrowing. 
Forests make up 39 percent of the 
land in my home State of Idaho. They 
are key to air and water quality and 
sustain 
wildlife 
habitat 
and 
rec-
reational opportunities. They support 
communities through wood and paper 
product jobs and recreation dollars. 
They are the backdrop and the means 
for an unparalleled quality of life. 
Their vitality hinges on their effective 
management. 
I am encouraged by the achievements 
on the Nez Perce-Clearwater National 
Forests, and I urge continued collabo-
rative efforts to address often conten-
tious but necessary natural resource 
challenges and the enactment of Fed-
eral law that bolsters these collabo-
rative efforts for the betterment of all 
our communities. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
CHINA 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, over the past few months, there 
have been many of us in this Chamber 
who have taken Big Tech to task over 
their shady and biased business prac-
tices. In more than one hearing, we 
have grilled them on the privacy, cen-
sorship, and antitrust concerns that 
have allowed us to keep these CEOs in 
the hot seat, and that grilling has 
taken place by those of us on either 
side of the aisle. 
These are big, big problems, and they 
are not going to disappear at the end of 
this Congress. These are problems that 
are going to be around. 
But one of the advantages of having 
these companies, like Facebook and 
Twitter and Google, living in our 
phones and in our homes is that it is 
much harder for oppressive govern-
ments and global bad actors to hide 
their crimes from the rest of the world. 
Just last year, about this time, the 
freedom fighters in Hong Kong—and 
this is a poster that I used on the floor 
just about this time, December 9, 2019, 
and it shows the freedom fighters in 
Hong Kong. It shows how they were 
making their case: ‘‘We do not want to 
become like China.’’ 
These freedom fighters in Hong Kong 
captured our attention when they filled 
the streets and demanded an end to the 
Chinese Communist Party’s terrible 
crackdowns on free speech and expres-
sion. While the coverage in the 24-hour 
news cycle definitely made an impact, 
it was the millions of tweets and 
Facebook posts and videos and blog 
posts that turned their movement into 
a collective global outcry for an end to 
violence and terror in Hong Kong. 
You see, people saw what was hap-
pening there. They saw it in realtime. 
Even if they didn’t fully understand 
the politics behind these protests, they 
knew that the disproportionate re-
sponse by the Chinese Government to 
stamp out these protests was wrong. As 
those posts flowed out of Hong Kong, 
support flowed right back in, and hav-
ing spoken with many of these brave 
activists, it really meant the world to 
them that they were hearing from us. 
While all of this was happening, 
something 
else—some 
countermes-
saging, if you will—was flowing from 
Beijing. It was a message of total ca-
pitulation sent by corporations, sports 
organizations, the mainstream media, 
and even powerful national and world 
leaders. They were all trying to keep 
the peace on behalf of their own self-in-
terests, but as the days and weeks 
passed by, their blinders became more 
and more obvious. 
By that time, the online activist 
community had put the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s crimes on full display.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7233 
December 7, 2020 
What started as a debate on free speech 
and political autonomy morphed into a 
full indictment of the Chinese Com-
munist Party’s crimes against human-
ity, against the Uighurs in Xinjiang, in 
Tibet, and Inner Mongolia, and all 
across Mainland China. 
Thanks to internet freedom efforts 
made possible by the Open Technology 
Fund, tweets and videos describing the 
Chinese Communist Party’s intoler-
ance of dissent escaped the Great Fire-
wall and made its way into Western 
news feeds. 
The spread of the coronavirus tore 
away the veil covering Beijing’s cor-
rupt 
relationship 
with 
the 
World 
Health Organization and other inter-
national organizations and revealed 
their scandalous coverup of the virus’s 
origins—all that truth right on our 
phones, right on our iPads and com-
puter screens and on every screen in 
the house. 
Unfortunately, for the millions suf-
fering under the horrors of com-
munism, truth didn’t win the day. The 
people with the most responsibility to 
speak up stayed silent because they 
were fearful of retaliation. It was too 
politically charged, too economically 
risky. Someone might take their criti-
cisms the wrong way, and, well, we 
can’t have that now, can we? 
I know from personal experience 
what it is like to have the Chinese 
Communist Party and their allies re-
taliate against you. Once you speak up, 
you are going to get it from all sides. 
Just last week, a member of the Chi-
nese state media—for all intents and 
purposes, I would suggest this is a 
propaganda minister for the Chinese 
Communist Party. Well, he decided 
that he had had enough of what we are 
doing here in Washington to expose 
Chinese aggression and fired off a se-
ries of vile, sexist tweets while con-
spicuously avoiding the issue at hand. 
It sounds fairly familiar: Attack the 
person; attack the messenger. 
The thing is, he was just mirroring 
the tactics used by his government. 
Beijing is all too happy to prey upon 
the ignorance of their massive online 
audience and encourage accusations of 
racism or xenophobia as the only ac-
ceptable responses to evidence docu-
menting their own racist, repressive 
politics. That, right there, is how you 
end up with repressive regimes like the 
one in China gaining so much power on 
the global stage when those who should 
know better allow their adversaries to 
cow them into silence. 
I appreciate the importance of diplo-
macy, but diplomacy is meaningless 
without consequences. Activists, by 
their very nature, rise and fall based on 
their willingness to speak truth to 
power 
when 
the 
most 
influential 
among us allow evil regimes to escape 
those consequences. 
Today, I call on my colleagues to fol-
low their example and use their work 
in this Chamber to speak truth to 
power about the crimes of the Chinese 
Communist Party. We no longer have 
any excuse not to. If you want proof, 
pull out your phones and listen to what 
activists in Hong Kong, in Taiwan, and 
in Mainland China are telling you—or 
better yet, listen to what some of your 
colleagues are telling you. 
Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong cur-
rently sits in jail for the crime of criti-
cizing his government. I repeat this: 
Hong Kong activist, a young freedom 
fighter, Joshua Wong, is in jail because 
he criticized the Chinese Communist 
party. He criticized his government. 
His sentencing barely managed a blip 
on the radar here. 
Another Hong Kong activist, Jimmy 
Lai, was denied bail during his own 
prosecution specifically because his on-
line newspaper revealed the truths of 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party’s 
chokehold on their own people. The 
CCP cut off access to his corporate ac-
counts and those of his employees. So 
much for Hong Kong’s free press. 
Jimmy Lai and Joshua Wong live in 
Hong Kong. 
In June, the Senate passed a resolu-
tion condemning the CCP’s repression 
of speech and expression in Hong Kong. 
These protests are still happening. Au-
thoritarian crackdowns are still hap-
pening. We must keep speaking about 
this. 
In Xinjiang, CCP forces are system-
atically targeting and eliminating the 
Uighur 
Muslim 
population 
through 
mass surveillance, population control, 
and 
incarceration 
in 
internment 
camps. Yes, you heard me—internment 
camps. It should make your skin crawl 
to hear that today, in 2020, this is hap-
pening. 
Last month, I joined my colleagues 
Senator CORNYN and Senator MENEN-
DEZ in supporting a bipartisan resolu-
tion to finally recognize that what the 
Chinese 
Government 
is 
doing 
in 
Xinjiang constitutes a genocide. 
If you are looking for a reason to 
start speaking out, I can’t think of a 
better way to get started. Speak up on 
that. Support this resolution, which 
would not only urge the White House 
to take action against Beijing but also 
urge national governments and organi-
zations to get their heads out of the 
sand and tear away, piece by piece, 
China’s disastrous influence over the 
global political economy, which is 
highlighted by the success of the Com-
munist Party’s Belt and Road Initia-
tive. 
I will add that I was thrilled today 
with Secretary Pompeo’s tweet regard-
ing his once again reupping the coun-
tries of concern under the Inter-
national Religious Freedom Act of 1998. 
China is on this list, as well they 
should be, as they continue to infringe 
on religious liberty, and they do en-
gage in systematic, ongoing, egregious 
religious freedom violations. They are 
doing it every day, and the world is 
watching. 
I tell you, I could monopolize this 
floor for the next week and lay out 
every opportunity we have to stand up 
for the cause of freedom and speak 
truth to power about the crimes of the 
Chinese Communist Party. 
Here is a white paper that I unveiled 
earlier this year. There are over 100 
specific paths toward how we as a na-
tion unraveled the relationship that we 
have right now with China. The paper 
is only 52 pages long. It is a short 
version. I encourage one and all to take 
a look at it and to think about how it 
is that we got to this point where an 
influential government, active in many 
major international bodies, including, 
as of next year, China being in the U.N. 
Human Rights Council—how can this 
government 
perpetrate 
a 
genocide 
against minorities and get away with 
it because of the appalling cowardice of 
those who bear witness and choose to 
do nothing. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, 2 weeks 
ago, I stood in this same position and 
gave remarks to my colleagues about 
the importance of, even though we 
can’t do everything, that we do some-
thing. It seems to be too often that the 
way the Senate has operated is that 
unless we can do everything everyone 
wants, we do nothing. I encouraged us 
to try to figure out what it is we can 
agree on and address that legislatively 
and save the issues we don’t agree on 
for later. 
The challenge that I presented was 
the circumstance of the consequences 
of 
COVID–19, 
the 
difficulties 
that 
Americans—Kansans—are facing, and 
the importance of our completing our 
work in regard to an additional re-
sponse to try to help the economy and 
to make sure people are healthy and 
know that they are healthy. 
We seem to be making progress in re-
gard to that desire to address the needs 
of Americans. While my complaint or 
concern 2 weeks ago was ‘‘we don’t 
have to do everything, we can do some-
thing,’’ it appears that we are going to 
do something, which is really impor-
tant. 
Now, I would raise the issue of tim-
ing. It is very discouraging to me to re-
turn to Washington, DC, to learn that 
the continuing resolution, which ex-
pires on Friday, is to be extended until 
next Friday at a time in which Ameri-
cans have little ability to wait, at 
least, to know what they are going to 
be able to expect. 
Small businesses, individuals, em-
ployees, employers all need the cer-
tainty, and every day that we are un-
able to accomplish what we can agree 
on is another day in which those Amer-
icans, 
those 
workers, 
those 
businessowners don’t know what they 
face. Christmas ought to be a time, the 
holiday season ought to be a time for 
expectations and joy and comfort, and 
yet what we are doing here by this con-
tinued delay is creating uncertainty 
which creates great challenges. 
The mental health and well-being of 
Kansans and Americans is at stake 
here. Again, my guess is that whatever 
we could agree on next week, we could 
agree on this week, so I would encour-
age my colleagues and me to redouble 
our efforts, not only to do what we can 
do, but to do it in a timely enough 
fashion that people get the benefit. 
I think of those who work in hos-
pitals in Kansas, those who care for 
people who are suffering from the 
symptoms of COVID. We need to make 
certain that we provide them the nec-
essary personal protection equipment; 
that we need to have the necessary 
testing; that every hospital, every clin-
ic, every doctor has the resources nec-
essary to care for those who are ill 
today. That is something that can’t 
wait. 
When it comes to the economy, too 
many 
businesses, 
retail 
establish-
ments, motels, restaurants, venues, 
theaters, the uncertainty that we are 
creating that every day goes by in 
which they don’t know whether Con-
gress is going to respond to their needs 
is a day in which we may lose another 
business, we may lose another person’s 
employment. 
The request is that we move more 
quickly than what we have done to 
date now, that we seem to be zeroing in 
on a compromise agreement, a bipar-
tisan agreement. That is a piece of 
good news, but every day that we delay 
the outcome, the vote, the support the 
American people and Kansans need is a 
day in which more harm is done. It is 
a time in which uncertainty exists. 
While we continue to have our debates 
and discussions, that uncertainty is 
creating not only economic problems 
but potentially loss of life as well. 
This place is slow to respond, and I 
would encourage us to be quicker in 
our response than what we have been 
to date. People are struggling, and 
they need our help. 
I also would say that too many Kan-
sans have died—people that I have 
known—have died from COVID. This is 
a very damaging disease. I would en-
courage Kansans and Americans to do 
the personally responsible things and 
protect themselves, to wear the masks, 
to socially distance. We cannot afford 
another shutdown. 
Every day that goes by in which we 
are not providing the opportunities for 
businesses to stay open and employees 
to be employed, particularly in rural 
America—the places, Mr. President, 
that you and I come from—if we lose a 
business to COVID, that business is un-
likely to return. If we don’t provide the 
necessary support for hospitals and 
healthcare 
delivery 
systems—there 
isn’t a hospital in Kansas, if it closes 
its doors today because of COVID, is 
going to open tomorrow when COVID is 
behind us. 
The deaths that I mentioned, in 
many instances, have been the commu-
nity leaders, the people who have made 
a difference in communities across 
Kansas. Every life has value, and every 
life has meaning. We want this death 
to end. 
For purposes of our economy and 
purposes of life and death, it is time for 
the U.S. Senate to act—not another 
week delay, not another 2 weeks of un-
knowing—but let’s reach our conclu-
sion, let’s come together and find solu-
tions and provide hope to my constitu-
ents in Kansas, yours in Arkansas, and 
the people of America. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
REMEMBERING ENSIGN JOSHUA KALEB WATSON 
Mr. JONES. Mr. President, 1 year ago 
yesterday, on December 6, 2019, a ter-
rorist attack on the Naval Air Station 
Pensacola killed three American serv-
icemen. 
While it is appropriate and it has 
been done to honor each of these men, 
I rise today with a solemn purpose of 
honoring and commemorating the life, 
service, and patriotism of one in par-
ticular: Navy ENS Joshua Kaleb Wat-
son of Enterprise, AL, whose promising 
life and career were tragically cut 
short in the terrorist attack a year and 
1 day ago yesterday. 
Kaleb was posthumously honored last 
Friday, receiving the Purple Heart in a 
ceremony in Pensacola. I really regret 
that I could not go and that I was un-
able to join his family, but there was 
also 
a 
wreath-laying 
ceremony 
at 
Building 633 where Kaleb was shot and 
a candlelight vigil there last night. I 
know that all were solemn occasions 
for the Navy, for the family, and for 
America. 
Kaleb was a rising star. A recent 
graduate of the Naval Academy, Kaleb 
had dreamed of becoming a Navy pilot 
and had reported to Pensacola for 
flight training the week of Veterans 
Day. Kaleb was described as a natural 
leader, a person who put others first 
and strived to bring out the best in 
them. 
At the Naval Academy, Kaleb was a 
small arms instructor, wrestling coach,

and captain of the rifle team. In fact, 
under his leadership, much to the cha-
grin of a couple folks in this body, like 
Senator REED, the Academy’s rifle 
team beat Army for the first time in a 
decade. 
Ben Watson, Kaleb’s father, said to 
me once that Kaleb’s mission was to 
confront evil, to bring the fight to 
them wherever it took him. He was 
willing to risk his life for his country. 
Kaleb did confront evil that day, and 
he made the ultimate sacrifice. 
Unfortunately, that was not how 
Kaleb intended to serve his country. It 
was not what Kaleb’s parents expected 
when he joined the Navy. Kaleb’s fa-
ther put it rather bluntly: 
We never thought he would die in Florida. 
Kaleb Watson was the officer on deck 
at the Naval Air Station Pensacola on 
the morning of December 6, 2019. Con-
sequently, he was one of the first peo-
ple the shooter encountered. Kaleb was 
shot at least five times that day. Heav-
ily wounded, he made his way out to 
flag down first responders, gave them 
an accurate description of the shooter 
that ultimately led to the shooter 
being killed. Unfortunately, later that 
day, Kaleb died of his wounds while in 
the hospital. 
The Navy conducted an investigation 
into the incident and concluded the 
primary cause of the attack was the 
Saudi 
shooter’s 
self-radicalization. 
However, the report also goes on to 
note numerous deficiencies in many 
areas, some of which contributed to the 
attack and others which could have de-
terred the attack or mitigated the con-
sequences. In other words, things could 
have been different that day. Things 
should have been different that day. 
We lost two other young men, Air-
man Mo Haitham from Florida and Air-
man Apprentice Cameron Walters of 
Georgia, and 11 more individuals were 
wounded. That has happened far too 
many times. Too many Americans have 
lost their lives to shooters on U.S. 
bases on U.S. soil. 
The Pensacola attack was the second 
shooting at a military base in 3 days. 
On December 3, 2019, a shooting at the 
Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard in Hawaii 
left two people dead and a third wound-
ed. There have been several other 
shootings at U.S. military installa-
tions, including a mass shooting in 2009 
at Fort Hood in Killeen, TX. That 
shooting claimed 13 lives and left an-
other 30 injured. 
Five years later, another shooting 
happened at Fort Hood when a gunman 
went on a shooting spree, killing 3 peo-
ple and injuring 14 before killing him-
self. In 2013, 12 workers at the Wash-
ington Navy Yard right here in our Na-
tion’s Capital were killed by a military 
contractor, who was later killed by se-
curity officials. In 2015, two military 
installations in Chattanooga, TN, were 
attacked by a gunman who killed four 
people before he was shot by police. 
There have been investigative reports 
about all of those shootings, and there 
have been recommendations in each 
one of the reports. Everybody shook 
their head and said: We have got to do 
better. We can’t continue to allow this 
to happen. 
What we see from the Pensacola re-
port we received just recently is that 
many of those recommendations were 
never followed, especially with regard 
to planning, training, and assessment 
of response plans for situations just 
like the one that occurred in Pensa-
cola, FL. That is simply inexcusable. 
We have young men and women every 
year, every day, every week, every 
month that volunteer to put their lives 
on the line for this country, never 
dreaming that their life may be put on 
the line within the security of the con-
fines of a U.S. military base on U.S. 
soil—not overseas, not as part of some 
overseas terrorist attack, but right 
here where they should be most secure. 
Ben Watson and his wife Sheila have 
made it their mission to do everything 
they can to prevent losing more of our 
sons and daughters in this way. I think 
this body ought to do the same. 
Every year, we have nominations. We 
make nominations, and we get the ap-
pointments back, sending those young 
men and women to the academies who 
will then go to those bases. We have a 
responsibility for that, as well as our 
overall responsibility to the men and 
women in uniform. 
This year, I asked for—and the con-
ference committee included in the final 
version of the NDAA—language requir-
ing the Secretary of Defense to imple-
ment, within 90 days, all applicable se-
curity and emergency response rec-
ommendations to protect our military 
installations and language requiring 
the Secretary of Defense to ensure that 
each installation conducts or develops 
a plan to conduct live emergency re-
sponse training with first responders. 
At a couple of hearings, including 
one just last week, I asked Navy lead-
ership at an Armed Services Readiness 
Subcommittee hearing for their com-
mitment. It is not the first time I had 
brought it up, but I knew it was going 
to be the last hearing, and I knew that 
this NDAA was hopefully going to in-
clude this language, but sometimes, 
the language is just not enough. I 
asked for their commitment to ensure 
that these long overdue steps are taken 
and accomplished. They, of course, 
gave me those assurances and that 
commitment. 
There are thousands of important 
provisions in the NDAA that hopefully 
will come to the floor very soon, but 
none—none—of those provisions are 
more important than those that ensure 
we do everything we can to keep our 
servicemembers 
and 
their 
families, 
who live and work on our bases, safe 
from attacks like these. 
As the Navy itself said in the Pensa-
cola report, talking about security 
manning—and I quote from the report, 
The ‘‘[Department of the Navy] must 
abandon minimum manning thresholds 
designed to protect physical assets and 
to meet ineffective response times. In-
stead, installations must be manned to 
rapidly respond with a preponderance 
of force at any time to preserve our 
most precious asset, our personnel. In-
creased security force manning enables 
presence, deterrence, assurance, and 
enhanced response’’—our most precious 
asset, our personnel. 
Well, as a father of three and grand-
father of two, I understand how pre-
cious our children are to our families. 
As a member of the Armed Services 
Committee for the past 2 years, I have 
seen firsthand how precious our men 
and women in uniform are to this coun-
try, and I have seen this body rise to 
the occasion to understand our fidu-
ciary responsibilities that we have to 
those men and women who protect and 
defend us every day. 
I had the privilege of visiting with 
some of the folks in Afghanistan and 
Iraq and working with many more here 
in the United States. Wherever they 
are serving, we owe them our best be-
cause we owe them our freedom. 
I want to thank the Watson family— 
Ben, Sheila, their son Adam—for their 
patriotism in supporting Kaleb in his 
dream to become a Navy pilot, and I 
want to extend again my sincerest con-
dolences for his untimely death. 
With the Watsons, however, I want to 
encourage this body to hold the Navy 
to the commitments that they made to 
me last week and to insist that the en-
tire Department of Defense follow its 
recommendations for protecting our 
military installations from within— 
protect them from future attacks from 
within. 
Although I will be leaving this body 
in a few weeks, I urge all of my col-
leagues to take up the baton to do our 
congressional oversight duty like our 
lives depend on it because there are 
lives which depend on it, and if their 
lives depend on it, our lives depend 
upon on it. 
Everyone should take up that man-
tle. Everyone should do all that they 
can to preserve and protect the Amer-
ican service men and women who pro-
tect us. They are our most precious 
asset, our personnel. 
For their sakes and for their fami-
lies, let’s do this thing. Let’s get this 
NDAA passed and then hold them to it 
in this next Congress. 
I yield the floor.

LIVAN). The majority leader.

TRIBUTE TO DAYMOND YOUNG 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
after more than seven decades, a Ken-
tucky family in Hancock County will 
finally lay their hero to rest. Last 
year, the Defense POW/MIA Account-
ing Agency, DPAA, identified the re-
mains of Navy Fireman 2nd Class Mar-
tin Daymond Young. Soon, he will be 
on his way home. 
Stationed aboard the USS Oklahoma, 
Daymond was killed during the Japa-
nese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
This Kentuckian, who would have 
turned 100 this year, will be buried be-
side his twin sister in Lewisport next 
May. Today, on the 79th anniversary of 
the Pearl Harbor attacks, I would like 
to pay tribute to Daymond for his 
bravery and sacrifice in defense of our 
Nation. 
In June 1940, 3 months before Presi-
dent Franklin Roosevelt authorized the 
first peacetime draft, Daymond volun-
teered for the Navy. He joined millions 
of men and women of the ‘‘greatest 
generation’’ who signed up to protect 
our country in uniform. According to 
Daymond’s niece, he was thrilled to be 
stationed in Hawaii. 
On the morning of December 7, 1941, 
Daymond was aboard the Oklahoma, 
which was moored at Ford Island. As 
the attack began, Japanese aerial tor-
pedoes pummeled the ship. Its port side 
tore open, forcing the 27,500-ton battle-
ship to capsize and sink. It took 
Daymond and 428 of his crewmates into 
the water below. 
The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor 
killed more than 2,400 Americans and 
launched the United States into the 
Second World War. Over the next 4 
years, heroes were forged on the battle-
field and at home as our country de-
feated the forces of tyranny in defense 
of the American way of life. 
In the following years, the Navy at-
tempted to identify the remains of 
those killed on the Oklahoma. Unfortu-
nately, the vast majority couldn’t be 
accounted for and were buried together 
in 46 plots at the National Memorial 
Cemetery of the Pacific, also known as 
the Punchbowl. 
Then 5 years ago, the Pentagon con-
tacted Daymond’s family as they ex-
humed the USS Oklahoma unknowns. 
The Navy used DNA samples to iden-
tify Daymond’s remains and give his 
family the opportunity for proper bur-
ial in Kentucky. By order of our Gov-
ernor, flags across the Bluegrass State 
will fly at half staff on that day in 
honor of a true American hero. 
Today, 
over 
1,300 
Kentucky 
servicemembers remain unaccounted 
for by the DPAA. We have never for-
gotten these patriots, and we will con-
tinue searching to bring them home. I 
am grateful for the ongoing efforts of 
the DPAA to bring closure to more 
families like Daymond’s so their loved 
ones can receive the tribute they 
earned. 
On behalf of my Senate colleagues, I 
would like to send our sincere condo-
lences to Daymond’s family and ex-
press our thanks for his brave service 
to our Nation. We are proud this Ken-
tucky hero is finally coming home. 
Mr. President, on Veterans Day, the 
Owensboro 
Messenger-Inquirer 
pub-
lished 
an 
article 
about 
Daymond 
Young’s identification. I ask unani-
mous consent the article be printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

COMING HOME: REMAINS
OF WWII VETERAN 
DAYMOND
YOUNG
WILL
BE
BURIED
IN 
LEWISPORT NEXT YEAR 
(By Renee Beasley) 
Layman Hawkins and his siblings grew up 
hearing one uncle’s name often. 
But they never had the privilege of meet-
ing Martin Daymond Young because he died 
in 1941 at the age of 21. 
Hawkins’ mom—Young’s twin sister—did 
everything in her power to keep her broth-
er’s memory alive as long as she lived. 
At birth, Young and his twin sister shared 
the same initials: MDY for Mary Daisy 
Young and Martin Daymond Young. 
Everyone called them Daisy and Daymond. 
If they were still alive, they would be 100 
years old now. 
‘‘(Young) was not a stranger to us,’’ said 
Hawkins, 76, of Lewisport. ‘‘Mom talked 
about him all the time.’’ 
Hawkins remembers a military photograph 
of his uncle always hung in his mom’s living 
room—like a badge of honor. 
‘‘It’s kinda like we knew him, but we 
didn’t know him,’’ Hawkins said. ‘‘. . . His 
memory was with us all the time.’’ 
PEARL HARBOR 
According to Navy records, Young, who 
grew up in the Hancock County village of 
Dukes, filled out his application to join the 
U.S. Navy on June 26, 1940. His application 
was approved on Aug. 14 that year. 
The Navy assigned Young, 21, a Fireman 
2nd Class, to the battleship USS Oklahoma, 
which was moored at Ford Island, Pearl Har-
bor, on Dec. 7, 1941. 
During the Japanese bombing of Pearl Har-
bor that day, torpedoes pounded the Okla-
homa, quickly capsizing it. Young was among 
429 crew members who perished aboard the 
battleship. 
After decades of being one of the Okla-
homa’s ‘‘unknowns,’’ the Navy identified 
Young’s remains last year. He will be laid to 
rest in Lewisport—beside his twin sister, 
Daisy Young Hawkins—on May 15, 2021. 
‘‘He was so excited about going to Hawaii,’’ 
said Joyce Nall of Owensboro. 
Young was her uncle, too. She is Young’s 
oldest living relative and the only one with 
memories of him. 
‘‘I was just a little girl when he went into 
the Navy,’’ Nall said. ‘‘I remember him being 
my big, handsome uncle.’’ 
After reaching Hawaii aboard the Okla-
homa, Young sent Nall a little grass skirt as 
a gift. 
Nall, 84, has held onto it all these years. 
THE PUNCHBOWL 
Between December 1941 and June 1944, 
Navy personnel recovered the bodies of the 
Oklahoma’s deceased crew. They were in-
terred in the Halawa and Nu’uanu ceme-
teries. 
In 1947, the crew’s remains were moved to 
the Central Identification Laboratory at 
Schofield Barracks. Staff there could only 
confirm the identities of 35 men at that 
time. 
Later, the Oklahoma unknowns were buried 
in 46 plots at the National Memorial Ceme-
tery of the Pacific in Honolulu, known as the 
Punchbowl, and they were classified as non- 
recoverable. 
In 2015, however, their remains were ex-
humed again for analysis and possible identi-
fication. 
Department of Defense personnel con-
tacted Hawkins about a year later, asking 
for the addresses of family members so the 
military could collect DNA samples. 
When Young’s remains were identified last 
year, the family had hoped to conduct his 
burial on May 11, which would have been his 
100th birthday. However, COVID–19 threw a 
wrench in those plans. The family opted for 
a May 2021 date instead. 
The military’s identification process—even 
decades after the bombing of Pearl Harbor— 
impresses Nall. 
‘‘To me, it’s amazing they have gone 
through this elaborate process,’’ she said. 
BURIAL 
Gov. Andy Beshear recently sent Young’s 
family a message, saying he would request 
flags across the commonwealth to fly at half 
staff on the day Young’s remains are buried. 
Also, Rolling Thunder motorcycle club, an 
advocacy group that seeks accountability for 
prisoners of war and those missing in action, 
notified the family that its members will 
meet the airplane in Owensboro and escort 
Young’s casket to the Lewisport cemetery. 
‘‘I appreciate the way everyone has treated 
us,’’ Hawkins said. ‘‘To us, this is a big 
deal.’’

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Government of Australia—155mm 
Ammunition and Accessories 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested to buy M825A1 155mm White Phos-
phorous projectile munitions, M782 Multi- 
Option Fuze for Artillery, M762A1 electronic- 
timed fuzes, M231 and M232A2 propelling 
charges, percussion primers, technical publi-
cations and books, technical data for oper-
ational maintenance, technical assistance 
and services, and other related elements of 
logistics and program support. The total es-
timated program cost is $132.2 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. 
This purchase will enable effective train-
ing and extend the Australian Defence 
Force’s (ADF) capability to conduct com-
bined operations. The ADF already has these 
rounds 
in 
service, 
and 
is 
trained 
and 
equipped to use them. Australia will not 
have any difficulty absorbing these weapons 
into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be deter-
mined at a later date. The material could po-
tentially be sourced from a combination of 
DoD stocks and new procurement. There are 
no known offset agreements proposed in con-
nection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of U.S. Govern-
ment or contractor representatives to Aus-
tralia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–78 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The M825A1 is a 155mm artillery projec-
tile which utilizes a payload of white phos-
phorous impregnated felt to produce a smoke 
screen at a target location. The Government 
of Australia has stated their commitment to 
use these rounds exclusively for its intended 
purpose, which is to provide signaling and to 
obscure enemy visibility on the battlefield. 
2. The M782 Multi-Option Fuze for Artil-
lery (MOFA). The M782 is a selectable multi- 
option fuze that provides height of burst ca-
pability to artillery rounds. The M782 is a 
sensitive military technology and has been 
approved for release to the Government of 
Australia. 
3. Also included in this case are propelling 
charges and other fuzes that enable the effec-
tive use of the M825A1 end item. While these 
technologies are controlled military hard-
ware they do not represent a significant 
technology transfer risk. 
4. The highest level of classified informa-
tion associated with the sale of this equip-
ment is SECRET. 
5. If a technologically advanced adversary 
obtains knowledge of the specific hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems that might reduce weap-
on system effectiveness or be used in the de-
velopment of a system with similar or ad-
vanced capabilities. 
6. A determination has been made that 
Australia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary to fur-
ther the U.S. foreign policy and national se-
curity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
7. All defense articles and services listed on 
this transmittal are authorized for release 
and export to the Government of Australia.

PEARL HARBOR REMEMBRANCE 
DAY 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ. 
Mr. 
President, 
today on Pearl Harbor Remembrance 
Day, veterans and their families will 
participate in remembrance events at 
the Pearl Harbor National Memorial. 
The attack on December 7, 1941, 
killed 2,403 and injured 1,178. This date 
of infamy as President Franklin Dela-
no Roosevelt described it, was one of 
America’s 
most 
consequential. 
It 
launched the United States into World 
War II and unleashed the courage, 
bravery, and resolve of thousands of 
servicemembers 
who 
changed 
the 
course of history. 
In Europe and Asia, they crushed the 
forces of fascism, Nazism, and oppres-
sion and brought freedom to much of 
the world. The price they paid was im-
mense. Many made the ultimate sac-
rifice for their country. Those who re-
turned built the world we know today. 
We call them the Greatest Genera-
tion. Now in the twilight of their lives, 
we have a chance to say, thank you, 
once more. 
I have introduced S. 3812, the WWII 
Veterans Hospital and Medical Eligi-
bility Act, and I am pleased to have the 
bipartisan support of Senators CRAMER, 
DAINES, BOOKER, TESTER, COONS, COL-
LINS, YOUNG, RUBIO, SINEMA, ROUNDS, 
WICKER, HASSAN, and KLOBUCHAR, and 
TILLIS. 
In 1996, the Veterans Health Care Eli-
gibility Act opened the VA healthcare 
system to all veterans of the Spanish- 
American War and World War I. My bill 
will provide the same benefits for 
World War II veterans. It will exempt 
World War II veterans who are not en-
rolled in VA healthcare from means 
testing requirements. This is one final 
opportunity to honor their heroism and 
afford them with dignity in their final 
years. 
I have been honored to work with the 
American Legion on this legislation. I 
thank the Legion for its tireless advo-
cacy on behalf of our Nation’s vet-
erans. On October 31, 2019, the Amer-
ican Legion National Commander, Bill 
Oxford called on the Veterans Adminis-
tration to expand the Veterans Health 
Care Eligibility Act of 1996 for World 
War II veterans. This bill does just 
that. 
As we reflect on National Pearl Har-
bor Remembrance Day, it is time for us 
to answer the call and provide VA 
healthcare to all those who answered 
the call of our Nation during its hour 
of need in World War II.

HONORING DEPUTY SANDEEP 
DHALIWAL 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, on Sep-
tember 27, 2019, Harris County lost one 
of its finest when Deputy Sandeep 
Dhaliwal’s life was taken in the line of 
duty. 
Pyara 
Dhaliwal, 
Deputy 
Dhaliwal’s father, lost his hero. 
That is exactly who Deputy Dhaliwal 
was, a hero. He was deeply committed 
to his faith, his family, and to serving 
others with compassion. 
Moved by his Sikh faith, Deputy 
Dhaliwal was a trailblazer. When he 
was first recruited by the sheriff’s of-
fice, Deputy Dhaliwal petitioned the 
office to allow him to wear his turban 
and beard while in uniform, becoming 
the first to be allowed to do so. 
Deputy Dhaliwal has left a profound 
legacy on the law enforcement commu-
nity. Since his death, the Houston Po-
lice Department and all eight county 
constables have changed their policies 
to allow officers to wear and carry arti-
cles 
of 
faith 
on 
duty. 
Deputy 
Dhaliwal’s commitment to his faith 
will inspire generations of Sikhs and 
other religious minorities to serve in 
law enforcement and protect our com-
munities. 
Deputy Dhaliwal was also a dedicated 
husband, father, son, and brother. His 
wife Harwinder Kaur Dhaliwal and 
their three beautiful children Japdeep, 
Noordeep, and Pardeep and their fam-
ily and friends have dedicated their 
lives to ensuring his legacy endures. 
We also remember Deputy Dhaliwal’s 
commitment to love and peace, a love 
and peace he showed not only while on 
duty, but to each person he served. 
When Hurricane Harvey decimated 
the Texas Gulf Coast, Deputy Dhaliwal 
served meals to Houstonians who were 
left homeless. In the wake of Hurricane 
Maria, he traveled to Puerto Rico to 
assist in the relief efforts there. He 
also worked to deliver water and sup-
plies to Punjab, India, while the area 
was suffering from a severe drought. 
Deputy Dhaliwal leaves behind an 
unmistakably beautiful legacy of a life 
marked with faith, devotion, and serv-
ice to others. 
I am grateful my colleagues have 
moved to rename the U.S. Postal Office

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING ROBERT CROWELL 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
I come forward today to recognize the 
life, career, and service of a fellow Ne-
vadan 
and 
friend, 
Mayor 
Robert 
Crowell. His leadership and love of the 
Silver State are an example to all of 
us. As mayor of Carson City, he led the 
city through some difficult times—the 
great 
recession 
and 
the 
current 
coronavirus 
pandemic—and 
oversaw 
the redevelopment of the capital city’s 
downtown core with his unique mix of 
dedication, compassion, good humor, 
and vision. 
Mayor Crowell began his life of serv-
ice as a young Navy sailor serving in 
the Vietnam war. After retiring as a 
naval captain, he earned his under-
graduate degree in economics from 
Stanford University in 1967 and his doc-
tor of jurisprudence degree from Has-
tings College of the Law in 1973. He was 
admitted to the State Bar of Nevada in 
1973. He was a member of the Bar Reg-
ister of Preeminent Lawyers and had 
been included in Best Lawyers in 
America in the fields of government re-
lations and energy law for the past 25 
years. 
Born in Tonopah and raised in Carson 
City, Mayor Crowell was always active 
in his community, serving as a board 
member or leadership role with the 
Carson City School Board, Nevada As-
sociation of Counties, Nevada League 
of Cities, Carson Area Chamber of Com-
merce, Northern Nevada Development 
Authority, Rotary Club of Carson City, 
and Nevada Legal Services. In addition, 
he was past president of State Bar of 
Nevada and chair of the Nevada Manda-
tory 
Continuing 
Legal 
Education 
Board. He was appointed by the Gov-
ernor to the Colorado River Commis-
sion and twice held the position of 
chairman, overseeing Nevada’s alloca-
tion of water and power from the Colo-
rado River. Mayor Crowell also served 
as president of the Board of Indigent 
Defense Services, a State agency to 
oversee the provision of indigent legal 
services in Nevada. He was also a mem-
ber of the Vietnam Veterans of Amer-
ica and was selected to be part of the 
‘‘first in the country’’ Honor Flight for 
Vietnam Veterans in Nevada. 
Mayor Crowell has numerous rec-
ognitions for his countless contribu-
tions to the quality of life of his fellow 
Nevadans. 
He 
was 
awarded 
the 
Participatory Democracy Award from 
the Nevada Association of Counties and 
the State Bar of Nevada Presidential 
Award—the highest honors awarded by 
those organizations—as well as being 
inducted in the Nevada Lobbyist Hall 
of Fame. 
Mayor Crowell had many titles—law-
yer, 
lobbyist, 
veteran, 
community 
leader—but it was clear he found great 
joy in serving the people of Carson City 
as mayor. Among his accomplishments 
was leading the effort to redevelop 
downtown Carson City, creating an en-
tirely new dynamic downtown that 
supported local businesses and our 
community. For his leadership on this 
effort, he was recognized by the Nevada 
Chapter of the American Planning As-
sociation with the De Boer Award as 
well as the Robert Broadbent Distin-
guished Services Award from the Ne-
vada Chapter of the American Public 
Works Association. 
What I will remember most about my 
friend Mayor Crowell are not his nu-
merous and distinguished professional 
achievements but the way he con-
ducted himself and how he led. Mayor 
Crowell was dedicated to his fellow 
residents and the betterment of his 
community and our great State. I can 
recall the many acts of kindness and 
friendship that he showed me when I 
became Nevada’s attorney general and 
in the years since. And Mayor Crowell 
brought those same qualities to every 
person he interacted with in both his 
professional and private life. 
Nevada lost a true treasure when 
Mayor Crowell passed on September 12, 
2020. His wife Susan and his family 
shared him with all Nevadans during 
his life, and we share in their grief 
upon his passing.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 794—URGING 
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT TO 
EXEMPT 
CERTAIN 
TECH-
NOLOGIES 
USED 
TO 
DETECT 
CHILD 
SEXUAL 
EXPLOITATION 
FROM 
EUROPEAN 
UNION 
EPRIVACY DIRECTIVE 
Mr. COTTON (for himself and Mrs. 
LOEFFLER) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 794 
Whereas ensuring the safety of children on-
line is a global issue that nations must ad-
dress together; 
Whereas the online trafficking of child sex-
ual abuse material (referred to in this pre-
amble as ‘‘CSAM’’) and online enticement of 
children (also known as ‘‘grooming’’) are per-
vasive problems that are growing at dra-
matic rates; 
Whereas crucial tools in detecting CSAM 
and grooming online and protecting children 
using online platforms from child predators 
are hashing, PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming 
technologies that are voluntarily used by 
electronic service providers (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘ESPs’’) to detect, report, 
and remove CSAM; 
Whereas the use of hashing, PhotoDNA, 
and anti-grooming technology by ESPs has 
generated millions of reports annually to the 
CyberTipline of the National Center for 
Missing & Exploited Children; 
Whereas the CyberTipline is a global hot-
line for reports related to child sexual ex-
ploitation that was authorized by Congress 
in 1998; 
Whereas in 2019, more than 69,000,000 im-
ages, videos, and files related to child sexual 
abuse were reported to the CyberTipline, 
with more than 3,000,000 of these images, vid-
eos, and files related to an offender or child 
victim in the European Union (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘EU’’); 
Whereas in a Communication to the Euro-
pean Parliament, dated July 24, 2020, the Eu-
ropean Commission noted, ‘‘the EU has be-
come the largest host of child sexual abuse 
material globally (from more than half in 
2016 to more than two thirds in 2019)’’; 
Whereas in 2018, an EU Directive extended 
the scope of prohibitions on processing per-
sonal data in the electronic communications 
sector to cover interpersonal communica-
tions, such as messenger services and e-mail; 
Whereas this EU Directive will cause ESPs 
to lose any legal basis to use hashing, 
PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming technologies 
to detect and report CSAM and online en-
ticement of children to the CyberTipline; 
Whereas this EU Directive will take effect 
December 21, 2020, which still allows time to 
amend this Directive to exempt the vol-
untary practice of using these technologies 
to detect and report distribution of CSAM 
and enticement of children for sexual abuse; 
Whereas the prohibition on the use of 
hashing, PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming tech-
nologies could have dire consequences for 
children in Europe and globally; 
Whereas it is unclear whether ESPs— 
(1) will be able to partition the use of hash-
ing, PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming tech-
nologies to carve out users in the EU; and 
(2) will decide to abandon the voluntary 
use of these technologies in the United 
States and globally; 
Whereas since children in the United 
States can be harmed by online predators in 
the EU through grooming, enticement, and 
the dissemination of CSAM images among 
EU offenders, such material should be de-
tected, reported, and removed; 
Whereas if the use of hashing, PhotoDNA, 
and anti-grooming technologies for detecting 
CSAM and grooming is stopped, the exploi-
tation of children globally will largely go 
undetected and continue to proliferate; and 
Whereas Congress agrees with the Euro-
pean Commission that ‘‘immediate action 
must be taken to address this issue’’: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) finds that hashing, PhotoDNA, and 
anti-grooming technologies are essential in 
detecting child sexual abuse material and ex-
ploitation online, including known and new 
CSAM, and grooming of children globally; 
and 
(2) urges the European Parliament to pass 
an interim regulation to allow electronic 
service providers to continue their current 
voluntary 
activities 
of 
using 
hashing, 
PhotoDNA, and anti-grooming technologies 
for the purpose of detecting child sexual ex-
ploitation.

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 2692. Mr. MARKEY submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed by 
him to the bill S. 2054, to posthumously 
award the Congressional Gold Medal, 
collectively, to Glen Doherty, Tyrone 
Woods, J. Christopher Stevens, and 
Sean Smith, in recognition of their 
contributions to the Nation; which was 
referred to the Committee on Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) On September 11, 2012, the United 
States 
consulate, 
and 
its 
personnel 
in 
Benghazi, Libya, were attacked by militants. 
(2) Four Americans were killed in the at-
tack, including Ambassador J. Christopher 
Stevens, Sean Smith, Glen Doherty, and Ty-
rone Woods. 
(3) Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods were 
former Navy SEALs who served as security 
personnel in Libya. As the attack unfolded, 
they bravely attempted to defend American 
property and protect United States diplo-
matic personnel. In so doing, they selflessly 
sacrificed their own lives. 
(4) Glen Doherty was a Navy SEAL for 12 
years and served in Iraq and Afghanistan. He 
attained the rank of Petty Officer First 
Class and earned the Navy and Marine Corps 
Commendation Medal. After leaving the 
Navy, Glen Doherty worked with the Depart-
ment of State to protect American dip-
lomats. 
(5) Tyrone Woods served for 20 years as a 
Navy SEAL including tours in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan. In Iraq he led multiple raids and 
reconnaissance missions and earned the 
Bronze Star. After retiring from the Navy as 
a Senior Chief Petty Officer, Tyrone Woods 
worked with the Department of State to pro-
tect American diplomats. 
(6) J. Christopher Stevens served for 21 
years in the U.S. Foreign Service. He was 
serving as U.S. Ambassador to Libya and 
previously served twice in the country, as 
both Special Representative to the Libyan 
Transitional National Council and as the 
Deputy Chief of Mission. Earlier in his life, 
he also served as a Peace Corps volunteer 
teaching English in Morocco. 
(7) Sean Smith served for 6 years in the 
U.S. Air Force. He attained the rank of Staff 
Sergeant and was awarded the Air Force 
Commendation Medal. After leaving the Air 
Force, Sean Smith served for 10 years in the 
State Department on various assignments, 
which took him to places such as Baghdad, 
Brussels, Pretoria, and The Hague. 
(8) As their careers attest, all four men 
served their country honorably. 
SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of 
the House of Representatives and the Presi-
dent pro tempore of the Senate shall make 
appropriate 
arrangements 
for 
the 
post-
humous award, on behalf of the Congress, of 
a single gold medal of appropriate design col-
lectively 
in 
commemoration 
of 
Glen 
Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher Ste-
vens, and Sean Smith, in recognition of their 
contributions to the Nation.

poses of the award referred to in subsection

in this Act referred to as the ‘‘Secretary’’) 
shall strike the gold medal with suitable em-
blems, devices, and inscriptions, to be deter-
mined by the Secretary. 
(c) CENTRAL
INTELLIGENCE
AGENCY
MU-
SEUM.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Following the award of 
the gold medal under subsection (a), the gold

ligence Agency Museum, where it will be dis-
played as appropriate and made available for

play elsewhere, particularly at other appro-
priate 
locations 
associated 
with 
Glen 
Doherty, Tyrone Woods, J. Christopher Ste-
vens, and Sean Smith. 
SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
Under such regulations as the Secretary 
may prescribe, the Secretary may strike and 
sell duplicates in bronze of the gold medal 
struck under section 2, at a price sufficient 
to cover the costs of the medals, including 
labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and 
overhead expenses. 
SEC. 4. NATIONAL MEDALS.

tional medals for purposes of chapter 51 of 
title 31, United States Code.

ALEXANDER) proposed an amendment to 
the bill H.R. 1503, to amend the Federal

paragraph (A)(i) should be submitted to the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services for 
inclusion on the list under section 505(j)(7) of 
the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
and which patents should not be required to 
be so submitted in order to reduce barriers 
to approval and market entry. 
(g) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—Section 505 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
(21 U.S.C. 355) is amended— 
(1) in subsection (c)(3)(E), by striking 
‘‘clause (A) of subsection (b)(1)’’ each place it

HONORING DR. NOEL SMITH’S 95TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the 95th birthday of Dr. Noel Smith 
from Fresno, California. Noel is a doctor, fa-
ther and proud advocate in the community. 
Dr. Smith is a native of La Brea, Trinidad. 
He graduated from Howard University with a 
Doctorate in Medicine, magna cum laude. In 
1958, he fulfilled his residency at the Fresno 
County General Hospital, in which he served 
as an obstetrician/gynecologist for the people 
of West Fresno. In this position, he provided 
much needed medical care to the medically 
underserved. 
Dr. Smith has previously worked at Fresno 
Regional Medical Center, Valley Medical Cen-
ter and St. Agnes Hospital. He is a member of 
both the National Medical Association and the 
Golden State Medical Association. 
He has shared his wisdom and been an ac-
tive member of the community throughout his 
career, serving on numerous boards and com-
missions. These include the Edison-Bethune 
School Board, Infant of Prague Adoption 
Agency, Fresno Model Cities Board and May-
or’s Bi-Racial committee. He is also a proud 
life member of the NAACP. Dr. Smith devotes 
his life and career to serving the Fresno com-
munity and he continues to share his knowl-
edge by supporting those in need. He helped 
establish the West Fresno Health Care Coali-
tion and served as Chair of the Fresno Model 
Cities Board and the T.B. Health Association. 
He is a recipient of various honors and 
awards for his service to the community in-
cluding, the 2010 African American Museum 
Trailblazers award and the Health award from 
the NAACP Fresno Board. 
Dr. Smith and his wife, Gloria are the proud 
parents of eight children, Noel Jr., Quincy, 
Robert, 
John-Stephen, 
Jennifer, 
Anthony, 
Sybil and Ronald, grandparents of 15 grand-
children, and 7 great grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in celebrating Dr. Noel 
Smith’s 95th birthday. I ask that you join me 
in wishing Dr. Smith and his family continued 
success, health and happiness.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
EDWARD GLYN HESTER 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Edward 
Glyn Hester of Nettleton who passed away 
Saturday, November 7. As a fellow service 
member, I am grateful for Mr. Hester’s dedica-
tion to family, state, and country. 
Edward Glyn Hester was born on February 
8, 1943 to Herman Glyn Hester and Ruth 
Johnson Hester. He spent his early years in 
Itawamba County and attended Nettleton High 
School. Glyn went on to graduate from Mis-
sissippi State University with a degree in busi-
ness. He used these skills to build his own 
construction company, Glyn Hester Builders. 
He used these resources to serve as lead 
contractor in the construction of small homes 
throughout Mississippi dedicated to the Baptist 
Children’s Village. There is a cottage in Starr, 
Mississippi named after Glyn and his wife, 
Judy. He dedicated over 20 years to the Bap-
tist Children’s Village, serving as a trustee. 
Glyn Hester served in the Mississippi Na-
tional Guard from 1965 to 1971. He was also 
a dedicated long-time member of Nettleton 
First Baptist Church, serving as a Deacon and 
Sunday School Secretary. Glyn was an impor-
tant figure in the church, prioritizing regular at-
tendance and arriving early to offer help to 
anyone who may need it. 
Glyn is survived by his wife of 53 years, 
Judy; son, Britton; daughter, Leslie; and two 
grandchildren. He is preceded in death by his 
parents. 
Edward Glyn Hester was a light unto all who 
had the opportunity to know and love him, and 
he will be deeply missed. My deepest condo-
lences are with his family and friends. 
IN HONOR OF IAN BAIN 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Redwood City councilmember 
and former mayor Ian Bain as he leaves the 
city council after 17 years of continuous serv-
ice, and nearly 18 years in all. It’s been an ex-
traordinary time of change for his city, and Ian 
helped shape much of the transformation. 
In the past decade, Redwood City grew by 
nearly 10,000 persons, or 12 percent, and by 
nearly 21 percent since Ian first sat as a 
councilmember in the late 1990’s. Twenty-first 
century buildings have replaced their 20th 
century predecessors, and in at least one in-
stance a 19th century home was moved to a 
new location as acres of new construction 
commenced. Locals noted that crows fled the 
area while cranes—aerial cranes with steel 
swinging from cables—were spotted through-
out downtown. 
Ian Bain was a councilmember who cau-
tioned colleagues that major change is hard 
on longtime residents. He was right. While the 
city rushed to meet the demands for office 
space related to the economic boom, and for 
housing that would temper skyrocketing rents, 
Ian noted that the effort was falling short for 
renters. As developers asked for approvals, 
Ian insisted that the developments work for all 
city residents. 
Today, with the city and our nation in pan-
demic slow motion, it outwardly appears that 
pressure to grow is less. In fact, it’s only de-
layed. Some of the solutions to our pandemic 
are being developed by rapidly growing com-
panies located in Redwood City and through-
out San Mateo County. These companies will 
need offices for researchers and housing for 
them and their families. 
On one Superbowl Sunday, I stood with Ian 
Bain on a levee in the middle of an inland sea, 
with the Administrator of the Environmental 
Protection Agency, as Ian and I argued 
against housing being built in the bay. Regret-
tably, the agency decided to abandon its pro-
tection of the waters of the United States. The 
United States District Court subsequently 
found EPA’s action in violation of the law. Ian 
has been steadfast in his opposition to filling 
San Francisco Bay. 
As a member of the revenue and finance 
committee, he fought to ensure that expansion 
of Redwood City is accompanied by prudent 
city financing. The city has unfunded pension 
liabilities and Ian is quick to note that its infra-
structure needs major renovations. For both 
environmental and fiscal reasons, Ian led the 
city’s effort to reduce its use of electricity by 
22 percent and of natural gas by 34 percent. 
Homeowners in Friendly Acres and residents 
in mobile home parks on the east side of 
Highway 101 have Ian to thank, in part, as the 
city closes in on a solution to regular flooding 
in their areas.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1096 
December 7, 2020 
Throughout Redwood City, you see humor-
ous signs advising you to slow down and to 
consider the cost of a traffic ticket. You’ll no-
tice new stop signs and physical changes to 
historically dangerous intersections. If you trip 
over a crack in a defective sidewalk, don’t 
blame Ian. He fought very hard for repairs. Ian 
is a lover of all things pedestrian and bicycle 
friendly. 
He served as a board member of the Se-
quoia Awards where he and others annually 
provide tens of thousands of dollars to high 
achieving, socially active young people going 
to college. In a prior career, he helped find 
jobs for adults with disabilities and he is an 
active member of the Chamber of Commerce. 
His council responsibilities include service on 
the personnel committee, transportation and 
mobility committee, and regional boards in-
cluding Peninsula Clean Energy and the C/ 
CAG bicycle and pedestrian advisory com-
mittee. 
Ian Bain is a graduate of the University of 
California at Berkeley and has a Bachelor’s in 
Political Science. He is married to Robbie 
Moffat. They live in the Woodside Plaza area 
of Redwood City. 
Madam Speaker, Ian Bain has been an out-
standing leader in Redwood City for close to 
two decades and I have thoroughly enjoyed 
working with him. His community is losing a 
longtime civic leader and an activist. I wish 
him well and know that his talents will always 
be directed toward helping the city that he 
loves.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
MARIANNE 
UDOW-PHILLIPS FOR A DISTIN-
GUISHED CAREER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to offer my heartfelt congratulations to 
Marianne Udow-Phillips as she celebrates her 
retirement as executive director of the Center 
for Health Research. Her contributions to our 
community are worthy of commendation. 
Marianne Udow-Phillips was the founding 
executive director of the Center for Health Re-
search Transformation (CHRT) at the Univer-
sity of Michigan. In this role, Marianne led sev-
eral projects and initiatives to advance evi-
dence-based care delivery, improve population 
health, and expand access to care. While at 
the University of Michigan, Marianne was also 
a lecturer in the School of Public Health and 
the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy, 
where she guided students on how to develop 
equitable policy solutions to address the na-
tion’s most pressing healthcare issues. Prior to 
her role at CHRT, Marianne served as director 
of the State of Michigan’s Department of 
Human Services and senior vice president of 
health care products and provider services at 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan. In addi-
tion, she has held several leadership roles at 
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and Mercy 
Alternative. Marianne currently serves as a 
board member for the Grameen Foundation. 
University of Michigan Health System, Arbor 
Research Collaborative for Health, U-M De-
pression Center National Advisory Board, 
Greater Detroit Area Health Council, and 
Michigan 
Women’s 
Foundation 
Emeritus 
Board. 
Throughout all capacities, Marianne Udow- 
Phillips has been recognized as a trans-
formative, effective, and motivated leader who 
strives to effect change. Her leadership has 
positively impacted the health care landscape 
in Michigan, and her efforts have been para-
mount in informing policymakers of critical 
healthcare needs across the community. 
Above all, Marianne is a kind, compassionate, 
and generous friend who is always willing to 
help someone in need. She had dedicated her 
career to bettering the community, and she 
has devoted her lifetime to mentoring and sup-
porting women. Marianne has earned several 
awards and honors for her impactful work, in-
cluding the Anti-Defamation League’s ‘‘Women 
of 
Achievement 
Award’’; 
Crain’s 
Detroit 
Business’s top 100 ‘‘Most Influential Women 
Award’’; and the Michigan Women’s Founda-
tion’s ‘‘Women of Achievement and Courage 
Award.’’ 
Although Marianne is retiring as executive 
director, she will remain a strong presence at 
CHRT. She will continue her important work 
and serve as a senior advisor on a number of 
CHRT initiatives. Moving forward, Marianne 
plans to begin the next chapter of her life by 
using her talents and wide expertise to launch 
a consulting company. Undoubtably, Marianne 
has a made a difference in our community, 
and we wish her continued success in the 
years ahead. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Marianne Udow-Phillips. We 
are proud to celebrate her work, accomplish-
ments, and significant community impact. We 
are grateful for her outstanding leadership and 
wish her the best of luck in her future endeav-
ors.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA PAROLE AND SU-
PERVISED RELEASE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to introduce the District of Columbia Parole 
and Supervised Release Act. This bill would 
give the District of Columbia the authority to 
make parole and supervised release deter-
minations for D.C. Code offenders beginning 
on November 1, 2022. 
Currently, the U.S. Parole Commission 
makes these determinations for D.C. Code of-
fenders. This bill would give D.C. the same 
authority over parole and supervised release 
determinations for D.C. Code offenders that 
the Commission has today. The District has 
asked to have this authority for its own local 
offenders. D.C. would have the same authority 
the states possess over their own local offend-
ers on these matters, including the authority to 
devise an adjudication system as it sees fit. 
The National Capital Revitalization and Self- 
Government Improvement Act of 1997 trans-
ferred the functions of the D.C. Parole Board 
to the Commission. By transferring the costs 
associated with the Commission’s work on 
D.C. Code offenders to the District, the federal 
government would save money with passage 
of this bill. 
I ask my colleagues to support this bill.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
ROBERT RALPH DUNN 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the life and accomplishments of 
Robert Ralph Dunn who passed away on May 
11, 2020 at the age of 76. 
Bob was a lifelong resident of the Morongo 
Basin, born November 10, 1944, to Ralph 
Franklin Dunn and Gertrude (Judy) Bond 
Sherman. His maternal grandparents, Harris 
and Doris Sherman, moved to Twentynine 
Palms in the 1930s. Bob graduated from 
Twentynine Palms High School in 1963. 
After graduating high school, Bob enlisted in 
the United States Army. He served as a 1st 
Lieutenant of the United States Army 8th Spe-
cial Forces where he was stationed in Central 
and South America from 1965 until 1969. After 
his service to our country, Bob married his 
wife Marie Huntington in 1975, at the Little 
Church of the Desert in Twentynine Palms. 
Bob continued to work within the 8th District of 
California in a new role, as a State Farm in-
surance agent starting in 1979. Bob worked 
with his father and brother in this family busi-
ness role in the Morongo Basin. 
He believed in the Morongo Basin and its 
communities, through mentorship and service, 
Bob became a pillar within the 8th district of 
California. 
Through 
his 
work 
within 
the 
Morongo Basin, he became a past Morongo 
Unified School District Board Member and 
President, President of the Yucca Valley Air-
port District Board, Officer of The San 
Bernardino County Republican Party, and a 
longtime supporter of the Boys and Girls Club 
of the Hi-Desert. 
With Robert’s passing, America lost a man 
who was not only a pillar in our community, 
but also someone who truly believed in and 
fought for the ideals of this great nation. On 
behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, 
I would like to pass along my deepest condo-
lences to all of Robert’s friends and family dur-
ing this difficult time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF GEORGE 
THOMAS ‘‘TOM’’ SEAVER 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam, Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Major League Baseball leg-
end, Hall of Famer and military veteran, Mr. 
George Thomas ‘‘Torn’’ Seaver. He was a be-
loved father, husband, friend and one of the 
finest baseball pitchers our country has had 
the pleasure of watching. 
Tom was born in Fresno, California to Betty 
Lee and Charles Henry Seaver. He attended 
Fresno High School and played on the base-
ball team. After graduating high school, Tom 
worked for his father’s company in the raisin 
industry before joining the United States Ma-
rine Corps Reserve in 1962 stationed at 29 
Palms in California until 1963. He served his 
eight-year commitment, remaining in the re-
serves until 1970. 
Tom attended Fresno City College, while 
working and serving in the reserves. He began 
the 1964 season two inches taller and 30 
pounds stronger at 6’1’’ and 190 pounds and 
quickly caught the attention of scouts. Tom 
had an 11–1 season, throwing at 90-mph for 
the Fresno City baseball team. He was re-
cruited to the University of Southern California 
(USC) under the guidance of legendary coach 
Rod Dedeaux. 
His talent and potential as a pitcher was evi-
dent from the start. In his first season at USC, 
Tom went 10–2, striking out 100 batters in 100 
innings. He was drafted by the Los Angeles 
Dodgers before returning to school for his jun-
ior year. He was signed by the Atlanta Braves 
in 1966, before landing with the New York 
Mets via a lottery. 
In 1967, Tom was named an All-Star and 
won the National League Rookie of the Year 
award, after a 16–13 season and 2.76 earned 
run average. The Met’s new manager Gil 
Hodges immediately saw Tom’s potential and 
the two formed a strong bond. He was a part 
of the ‘‘Miracle Mets’’ that won their first World 
Series in 1969. From 1968 to 1976, Tom had 
a record nine consecutive 200-strikeout sea-
sons. Tom would go on to play 11 seasons for 
the Mets, 6 seasons for the Cincinnati Reds, 
2 seasons with the Chicago White Sox, before 
retiring with the Boston Red Sox. 
A right-hander who earned the nickname 
‘‘Tom Terrific,’’ Tom won 311 games and 
struck out 3,640 batters over his 20-year 
major league career. He earned 12 All-Star 
selections, led the National League in wins 3 
times. He also won three National League Cy 
Young Awards. He was elected to the Base-
ball Hall of Fame in 1992, earning 98.8 per-
cent of the ballots cast by members of Base-
ball Writers Association of America. This was 
the highest voting percentage ever earned at 
that time. In 1988, the Mets honored his sto-
ried career by retiring Tom’s number 41. 
After his career in baseball, Tom worked as 
an announcer for the New York Yankees and 
the New York Mets. Tom and his wife estab-
lished a winery in Calistoga, California, Seaver 
Vineyards along with his family. Tom enjoyed 
time with his family and his vineyard. 
He is survived by his wife, Nancy, and their 
two daughters, Sarah and Anne. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring the life of 
baseball legend, Tom Seaver. His legacy will 
be remembered for many years to come. He 
truly was terrific. We join his family, friends 
and community in honoring his great life and 
legacy.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JILL 
RICE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to commemorate the life of Jill 
Rice, who passed away on November 17, on 
her 78th birthday. After a hard-fought battle 
with Alzheimer’s disease, Mrs. Rice is now at 
peace with our Lord, though she will be deeply 
missed by those who knew and loved her. 
Jill was born in Memphis, Tennessee to 
Willie Clyde and Mary Lavelle Rowan White. 
She married Massachusetts native Richard 
Thomas Rice in September of 1960. Richard 
dedicated 20 years to the United States Navy 
before the couple moved to Mooreville, Mis-
sissippi in 1979. 
Mrs. Rice was not only known as a loving 
wife, mother, grandmother, and great-grand-
mother, but for her wide variety of interests 
and hobbies. As a Black Belt in Taekwondo, 
she achieved many awards among her age 
group. She spent her free time with her be-
loved grandchildren and kittens. 
Jill Rice is survived by her husband of 60 
years, Richard Rice; their daughter, Debbie; 
three 
grandsons; 
and 
three 
great-grand-
children. She was preceded in death by her 
son Gary who passed away in 1999. 
Mrs. Rice embodied a remarkable kindness 
and empathy felt by all those she knew. She 
will be greatly missed, and I join her loved 
ones in mourning her loss.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
MAYOR 
JOHN 
FRANKLIN 
GRIMES III 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and legacy of Siler City Mayor 
John Franklin Grimes III, who passed away on 
October 20, 2020. John was a stalwart of the 
Siler City, North Carolina community where he 
served as mayor since 2013. He was a serv-
ant in the truest sense of the word, always 
willing to go to the back of the line and take 
care 
of 
the 
needs 
of 
others 
first. 
Unsurprisingly, he was one of the select few 
to be awarded the Order of the Long Leaf 
Pine, North Carolina’s highest civilian honor 
for remarkable service to the state. 
John’s character of service was ingrained at 
a young age as his father quickly signed up to 
join the U.S. Navy after the attack on Pearl 
Harbor on December 7, 1941. John would say 
that, ‘‘Growing up, we presumed to have an 
obligation to serve in the military.’’ Con-
sequently, after graduating from Davie County 
High School, John received a scholarship to 
play football at Wake Forest in Winston- 
Salem, enrolling in the school’s ROTC pro-
gram. Upon graduation, John earned a com-
mission as a second lieutenant and served in 
the 3rd/8th Calvary in Germany during the 
Vietnam era. 
Upon returning to North Carolina with his 
wife Cecilia, John was asked to serve as a 
local judge for the 1968 election to help iden-
tify and report election irregularities. After a 
break from public service where he helped 
build and expand the Cecil Budd Tire Com-
pany, John would re-enter politics through his 
work with the Chatham County Republican 
Party, eventually becoming its chair. In 1994 
he ran (and led the ticket) for a seat on the 
Chatham County Board of Commissioners, be-
coming the first Republican elected to that 
Board in the 20th century. 
In 1999, he was elected to the Siler City 
Board of Commissioners and served as Mayor 
Pro Term until his election as Mayor in 2013, 
his first of four terms. John continuously 
stressed how seriously he valued the input of 
his constituents, saying ‘‘If they don’t hold 
(politicians) accountable, anything can hap-
pen.’’ 
Madam Speaker, our country needs more 
public servants like John Franklin Grimes III. 
The entire Siler City community is less whole 
today without John, but the impact he made 
and the lives he touched are a testament to 
how special a person he was. Please join me 
in celebrating his life and legacy.

IN HONOR OF SHELLY MASUR 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Shelly Masur as she departs from 
the city council of Redwood City. When cou-
pled with her 10 years of service as a trustee 
of the Redwood City School District, she has 
served constituents for a remarkable 15 years. 
When coupled with her related professional 
endeavors over even more years, it’s fair to 
say that it’s been an extremely productive 
chapter of her life. 
Shelly has a distinguished career in edu-
cation as an advocate. For the past five years, 
she led the nonprofit Californians Dedicated to 
Education Foundation. Under her leadership 
the organization hosted its first STEM sympo-
sium for 3,000 educators focused on diversi-
fying the STEM pipeline, partnered with the 
California Department of Education by serving 
as a fiscal agent for grants secured by the de-
partment, created forums focused on stand-
ards implementation, and otherwise supported 
educational reform efforts throughout Cali-
fornia. However, it was her service as a trust-
ee of the school board that is her enduring 
contribution to education. 
Serving on a school board in California is 
not for the faint of heart. In one year the dis-
trict had to cut its budget by 20 percent. Shelly 
did her duty, but she went further. She and 
her colleagues educated voters about the im-
portance of the district, and ultimately a mod-
est parcel tax of $67 passed, followed by a re-
newal at $85. These measures strengthened 
district finances enormously. 
The district is composed of 6700 pre-K to 
8th grade students from around the globe. Ac-
cording to the district, Hispanic/Latino students

make up the largest ethnic group at 68 per-
cent. Twenty-two percent of students are 
white, 6 percent are Asian/Pacific Islander, 
and 1 percent are African-American. Shelly al-
ways insisted that the programming for these 
students be first-rate, including but not limited 
to such important offerings as accelerated 
learning, developmental bilingual education, 
dual language immersion in Spanish, a gifted 
and talented education (GATE) program, Man-
darin immersion and a program in music and 
the performing arts. 
Advocating for equal opportunity for a high- 
quality education for every student is both a 
personal and professional passion of Shelly 
Masur. In 2013, her advocacy was noted by 
the influential Silicon Valley Business Journal 
which named her one of the ‘‘100 Women of 
Influence’’ in Silicon Valley. She recently 
ended her term as board president of Red-
wood City 2020, a public-private partnership 
engaging 800 plus community members to 
support the future of the school district and 
broader community development. 
As a city councilmember, Shelly was equally 
passionate about the need for more housing 
and often endured strong opposition to build-
ing housing for all. For example, a proposal to 
allow more affordable accessory dwelling units 
was slated for major downscaling until Shelly 
developed a compromise that gained six out 
of seven votes on the council. A property 
owner near an affordable housing develop-
ment filed suit to prevent its construction. 
Shelly and her colleagues fought the suit and 
ultimately the nonprofit sponsor was able to 
develop 
20 
affordable 
for-purchase 
new 
homes for very low and low income residents. 
In the past eight years, including five when 
Shelly served on the council, Redwood City, 
with a population of 79,000 residents, added 
over 4,000 new housing units. Presently, over 
500 affordable units are either approved or 
under construction. 
Shelly Masur’s professional experience in-
cludes extensive nonprofit work through seven 
youth and teen organizations including Teen 
Talk, the Adolescent Health Collaborative, the 
John Gardner Center at Stanford, and the 
Californians Dedicated to Education Founda-
tion. Her husband, Josh, and her three chil-
dren, Julia, Jacob and Noah, have also con-
tributed to this remarkable woman’s efforts, 
enduring countless hours without Shelly as 
she attended multiple late night meetings and 
forums over 21 years of personal and profes-
sional responsibilities. We thank them for their 
contribution to us all. 
Madam Speaker, there are many who talk 
about public service, but few who bear the 
price and produce such widespread acclaim 
for their unwavering support of the public’s 
best interests. Whether working on adolescent 
health, housing, parks and recreation, kinder-
garten 
or 
city 
infrastructure 
investments, 
Shelly Masur demonstrated a knack for getting 
the job done. Unlike some in public life, her 
record is real. Our community appreciates her 
brilliance, insightfulness and honesty. If we’ve 
learned anything in 2020, public officials of 
this caliber are needed to make democracy 
strong. Fortunately, in Shelly Masur, we have 
a pillar of democracy. We can truly say, 
‘‘Thank you, Shelly. Job well done.’’

NATIONAL PURPLE HEART HALL 
OF 
HONOR 
COMMEMORATIVE 
COIN ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANTHONY GONZALEZ 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, December 2, 2020 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Senate Amendment to H.R. 
1830, the ‘‘National Purple Heart Honor Mis-
sion Commemorative Coin Act.’’ 
I would like to thank Leader SCHUMER for 
championing this issue on the Senate side, 
and the Gentleman from New York, Congress-
man MALONEY, for his work. We passed his 
version of this bill in the House back in Sep-
tember of 2019. Regardless of the chamber, 
I’m glad we have the opportunity to send this 
important bill to the President’s desk. 
The National Purple Heart Mission opened 
in 2006. The Purple Heart Mission is a New 
York State Facility that is dedicated to col-
lecting, preserving, and sharing the stories of 
all Purple Heart recipients from all branches of 
service and across all conflicts. 
Enrollments at the National Purple Honor 
Mission are voluntary and submissions are 
made by Purple Heart recipients, their fami-
lies, or friends. Currently, there are 4,783 Pur-
ple Heart recipients enrolled from the great 
state of Ohio, representing: World War I, 
World War II, Korea, Vietnam, Somalia, Oper-
ation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. 
These courageous men and women are rec-
ognized by the National Purple Heart Honor 
Mission, because surprisingly, the federal gov-
ernment does not maintain a comprehensive 
list. In fact, the only award for which there is 
a list, is the Medal of Honor. 
Mr. Speaker, the National Purple Heart 
Honor Mission is an organization that de-
serves the recognition the commemorative 
coin will bring. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD 
W. SCHMIDT 
HON. HARLEY ROUDA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and celebrate the life of Richard W. 
Schmidt, who passed away peacefully on No-
vember 4, 2020, at the age of 90, with his wife 
and son by his side. A veteran, loving hus-
band, father, grandfather, and great-grand-
father, Richard will be dearly missed by his 
family and friends. 
A graduate of Hoover High School in Glen-
dale, California and an avid basketball player, 
Richard proudly served his country in the Ko-
rean War surviving freezing temperatures and 
combat as a sergeant in the U.S. Army. After 
the war, Richard returned home to work in the 
financial and real estate development sectors 
in Orange County. 
Later in life, Richard loved to watch sports, 
play tennis, golf, and camp. Among his fishing 
buddies, he was known as ‘‘The Judge’’. After 
listening to one tall tale after another, he 
would annually award the coveted Fisherman 
of the Year trophy. After a few toasts around 
the campfire, Richard would climb into his 
sleeping bag for a well-deserved rest. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in honoring and celebrating the life of 
Richard W. Schmidt for his service to our 
country, to his family, and to our community.

HONORING DICK STEPHENS’ 100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
along with my colleague, Mr. GARAMENDI, to 
recognize Mr. Dick Stephens on the occasion 
of his 100th birthday and celebrate his family’s 
long legacy of shipbuilding in California. Dick 
is a world champion sailor, designer, and ship-
wright in addition to a proud husband and 
family man. 
Dick was born into a boat-building family 
and gained an appreciation for the trade from 
a young age. He was always curious and felt 
at home playing in his father’s boatyard. In 
1928, at the tender age of 8, Dick salvaged a 
boat and transformed it, all while ingraining in 
him a passion for boats. 
At the end of World War II, Dick and his 
three brothers, Theo and Barre took over their 
uncle Roy Stephens’ company, The Stephens 
Brothers Boat Builders and Designers Com-
pany. Their uncle oversaw the construction 
and launching of over 700 vessels. The Ste-
phens brothers contracted with the military 
during the Korean War and beginning of Cold 
War hostilities in 1953. They built many ships 
for the U.S. military during this period. In the 
1960s, the brothers sold their company to the 
Wrather Corporation. After a short while, they

bought the company back and quickly gained 
customers with their quality work. Dick was 
known for always intently listening to his cus-
tomers and making their dream yachts come 
to life, while using the finest materials. They 
built 19 Farallone Clippers and won races in 
one of his vessels many times on the San 
Francisco Bay. 
In the 1960’s, boat design was shifted to an-
gular cruiser loops, and Dick’s cruisers contin-
ued on into the 1970’s like the 48′ Triple 
Crown. In 1974, the Stephens Brothers cre-
ated their very last wooden boat, the 50′ 
Egret. A new era of aluminum and fiberglass 
began grabbing the attention of many design-
ers. In 1975, they launched its first aluminum 
hull yacht. This success created over 20 more 
pieces of finely engineered art, with the start 
of the 85′ Defiance, one of their most popular 
pieces of work. After 85 years of success, it 
was decided in the spring of 1987 that the 
Stephens Brothers would close their business. 
Throughout his career, Dick has always had 
his loving wife Donna by his side. Many have 
enjoyed his pieces of art in his shipbuilding 
skills. In addition to shipbuilding, Dick is also 
a world champion sailor. He won a three-race 
series in the International Open Cass with a 
boat he designed, Opps. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to join us in celebrating Dick Ste-
phens’ 100th birthday and his work to further 
the shipbuilding industry. His love for boats 
and his customers endures to this day and he 
continues to be embraced by boat lovers far 
and wide. We ask that you join us in wishing 
Dick and his family continued health, happi-
ness and success.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JIMMY 
WISE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Jimmy Wise 
of Ackerman, Mississippi who passed away 
Sunday, November 29. 
Born on January 6, 1941, to John David and 
Jimmie Aline Wise, Jimmy was raised with a 
passion for sports. He graduated from Provine 
High School in Jackson in 1959 before matric-
ulating to Mississippi State University to join 
the basketball team. He played for one year 
before becoming the team manager. He held 
this position from 1961 to 1963 when MSU 
earned the title of SEC champions. In 1963, 
Jimmy graduated and moved to Pontotoc to 
coach basketball, football, and tennis. 
On June 20, 1965, Jimmy Wise married 
Beverly Hester. The family soon relocated to 
Memphis where Jimmy began his forty-year 
career with Temple Inland, Inc. They relocated 
to Pontotoc and began coaching Little League 
baseball. Jimmy enjoyed nothing more than 
attending Mississippi State football, basketball, 
and baseball games and watching his sons 
play sports. He was deeply involved with the 
local Baptist church as a deacon, Sunday 
school teacher, and served on multiple com-
mittees. 
Jimmy is survived by his wife Beverly; son, 
Rhett; son, Scott; son, Reagan; son, Josh; 
and ten grandchildren. He impacted countless 
lives across the state of Mississippi and be-
yond, and will be celebrated by all those who 
had an opportunity to know and love him. 
Jimmy Wise lived a profound life marked by 
service, dedication, and commitment to family. 
He will be greatly missed.

IN HONOR OF JANET BORGENS 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the outstanding service of Janet 
Borgens, departing member of the city council 
of Redwood City. She leaves the council after 
five years of service and after more than ten 
years on the city’s planning commission. The 
community owes her a tremendous debt for 
the countless hours she has served. 
Janet grew up a few miles away in East 
Palo Alto where she went to local elementary, 
middle and high schools. In 1969, she moved 
to Redwood City and put down roots in part by 
buying a hair salon. As a single mother, she 
needed the flexibility of owning her own shop 
and setting her own hours. 
I first got to know Janet when she came to 
my office in the state legislature to advocate 
on behalf of cosmetologists. She has always 
been a consumer advocate and her efforts on 
behalf of clients improved the health and safe-
ty of both clients and practitioners. As the 
owner of a small business, she also became 
aware of the impact of city government on 
local establishments. 
Ultimately, she was selected to serve on the 
Redwood City Senior Affairs commission, the 
Housing and Human Concerns committee and 
the planning commission. Through these posi-
tions of progressively greater responsibility 
she came to understand the needs of various 
populations of her community. 
Redwood City is a thriving city of 86,000 
persons located 15 miles south of San Fran-
cisco Airport and a few minutes north of 
Facebook. Within the city’s boundaries are the 
headquarters of Oracle and Box.com, many 
pharmaceutical companies, and the Chan- 
Zuckerberg Initiative. Redwood City is also the 
county seat of San Mateo County, hosting the 
county government center, jail and numerous 
other county agencies. 
Downtown has exploded in population dur-
ing this past decade as employers seek to lo-
cate near its heavily utilized train and bus 
lines. 48 percent of adults age 25 and older 
have a college degree, and housing costs re-
flect this high-earning cohort. Median rental 
costs are $2,100 per month for an apartment, 
necessitating an annual income of at least 
$76,000. 
Officially, 10 percent of the population lives 
in poverty but since the official poverty level is 
not reflective of reality in Redwood City, the 
actual population living in poverty is likely 
greater. Non-college educated adults working 
in the service sector and recent immigrants 
often struggle to make ends meet. 
The hallmark of Janet’s service is her con-
sistent advocacy on behalf of wage-earning 
families who struggle with the cost of living in 
the city. She’s been outspoken about her sup-
port for affordable housing, repeatedly voting 
to allow affordable developments in the com-
munity. In recent council discussions about es-
tablishing a safe site for recreational vehicle 
living, Janet wanted to be sure that fines for 
failing to heed the city’s overnight parking ordi-
nance were not ruinous. 
Her work on the Bayfront Canal is a special 
example of her concern for low income resi-
dents. I’ve visited the Redwood City trailer 
parks, filled with wage-earning families and re-
tirees, that are flooded almost every year be-
cause the canal overflows. This project was 
not fully funded but Janet and the city kept at 
it, eventually raising the money needed to fix 
the problem. She will leave office just as per-
mits allowing construction may be issued. 
Through her council duties, she currently 
serves on the San Francisco Airport Commu-
nity Roundtable, various Caltrain-related com-
mittees, and she is an active CERT trainer. 
Her commitment to the community is truly 
noteworthy. For 20 years, she led the Amer-
ican Cancer Society’s Wig Bank, work which 
earned her honors. She has long worked with 
the homeless by packing and distributing 
meals, collecting clothing, and by working with 
the Salvation Army. She raises funds for col-
lege scholarships and is an active member of 
the Peninsula Sunrise Rotary Club. 
Madam Speaker, after five years on the city 
council and decades of service to the commu-
nity, Janet is now leaving public life. She and 
her husband Milt, a former police officer, will 
have additional time to spend with their three

hood of Friendly Acres has many remaining 
challenges, but residents will always have an

VICTORVILLE MAYOR GLORIA 
GARCIA RETIRES 
HON. PAUL COOK 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COOK. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize the retirement of Gloria 
Garcia from the Victorville City Council. 
Mayor Gloria Garcia was born and raised in 
Victorville, CA. Gloria attended Victor Valley 
Sr. High School, Victor Valley College, and 
Skadron College of Business. She was elect-
ed to the Victorville City Council in November 
2012 and was appointed Mayor by her fellow 
Council Members in December 2014. She was 
reelected in 2016, and continuously re-
appointed as Mayor by her colleagues on the 
council. Gloria’s time on the council has been 
marked by many successes in Victorville. Her 
focus on public safety, new infrastructure, road 
maintenance has led to great improvements 
and safer neighborhoods in Victorville. 
Mayor Garcia has served the council with 
honor and integrity, and her commitment to 
good 
government 
and 
transparency 
has 
served the citizens of Victorville well. Although 
her second term has seen Victorville and its 
Council experience discord and disruption, 
Gloria has remained steadfast and focused on 
working for the people of Victorville. I will truly 
miss Gloria’s face on the council dais, and I 
wish much happiness and success in her fu-
ture.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWARD 
LANE 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of longtime Fresnan and Pearl 
Harbor survivor, Edward Lane, who passed 
away on September 6, 2020. He was a proud 
husband, father, public servant, leader and a 
survivor. 
Edward was born on December 2, 1936 in 
San Francisco, California. Although he was 
not born in Fresno, he always considered it 
home. Growing up, he frequently moved 
across the country due to his father’s military 
career, but he always returned to Fresno. He 
graduated from San Joaquin Memorial High 
School in 1954 and attended Fresno State in 
1958 with a degree in marketing. 
Edward’s life took an interesting journey, be-
ginning with the attack on Pearl Harbor in 
1941. His father was responsible for over-
seeing a military hospital in Hickam Field, Ha-
waii when World War II began. His home was 
only two blocks away from Pearl Harbor. Dur-
ing the attack, an anti-aircraft shell landed on 
his family’s house. Fortunately, it did not ex-
plode and he survived. Telling the ‘‘December 
7th story’’ was an annual event for the family. 
Edward often thanked his parents and big 
brother, Mike, for teaching him work ethic. 
These skills led him to his 36-year career with 
the State of California’s Employment Develop-
ment Department (EDD). He was appointed by 
several governors to serve in many senior 
management positions during his tenure. He 
worked to establish EDD as an important and 
active asset in communities throughout the 
state and maintained his belief in the positive 
power of government to respond to the needs 
of individuals and the community at large. 
Edward was a big sports fan. A Fresno 
State season ticket holder for over 60 years, 
he rarely missed home football and basketball 
games. However, his biggest passion was ten-
nis. He was active on and off the court for 
over 47 years in the Fresno tennis community. 
He captained two teams that won national 
championships and served as a club presi-
dent. He loved animals and had pets ranging 
from dogs, cats, to a small rhesus monkey 
from South Africa. 
Edward is survived by his wife and best 
friend for over 60 years, Jean Lane; children 
Brian, Valerie, and David; grandchildren Mi-
chael, Nicholas and Alyssa Bavaro; son-in-law 
Vince Bavaro; and daughter-in-law Lucy Gon-
zalez. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring the life of Mr. 
Edward Lane. His leadership and story will be 
remembered for many years to come. We join 
his family, friends and community in honoring 
his great life and legacy.

CALIFORNIA’S 
21ST CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT

Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I

dedicated their time and talents to the con-
stituents of California’s 2lst Congressional Dis-
trict. During my time in office, my staff made 
incredible strides in improving the lives of

My staff went above and beyond to serve 
our district by developing meaningful legisla-
tion, completing hundreds of casework, an-
swering thousands of constituent inquiries, 
keeping in contact with constituents both in 
person and through media, and much more. 
Because of their efforts, we accomplished 
incredible things in the 116th Congress. I ask 
my colleagues in the House of Representa-
tives to join me in honoring these public serv-
ants and giving them the recognition they de-
serve.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
ROBERT PITTS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Robert Pitts. 
Bob represents the best of our greatest gen-
eration, and I am forever indebted to him for 
his service to this nation. As a fellow member 
of the 150th Combat Engineer Batallion, I am 
grateful for the precedent set by these brave 
soldiers. 
Bob was born in 1923, the second oldest of 
ten siblings. In the height of the Great Depres-
sion, Bob often found himself working odd 
jobs after school to support his family. In the 
8th grade he dropped out and attended Bos-
ton Trade School to train as an electrician. 
In 1943, Bob enlisted in the United States 
Army. After training in Ft. Devens, he joined 
the 150th Engineer Battalion, an experimental 
unit comprised mostly of New England locals. 
After Basic and Engineering Training, Bob re-
located to New York to continue his training as 
an electrician. The outfit returned from West 
Virginia and trained in a mock German village 
at Camp Edwards. On Christmas, Bob de-
ployed with the 150th on the Queen Mary to 
Europe. 
While overseas, Bob was assigned as 
batallion photographer. His duties included 
taking photos of unit operations, which often 
placed him in the line of fire. He was awarded 
the Bronze Star for actions under fire while 
operating in Germany. He was also awarded 
the rank of Tech5. After VE Day, TSGT 5 Pitts 
and his unit were sent to Czechoslovakia and 
returned to the states with different outfits. 
What distinguishes the 150th is their continued 
relationship. For more than sixty years the unit 
enjoyed annual gatherings. After the war, Bob 
pursued his interest in engineering at MIT. He 
worked on some of the earliest computers and 
earned the title Electronic Engineer Assistant. 
Mr. Pitts was married to Eleanor M. Hatha-
way for 48 years before her passing in 1998. 
Together, they had three children; Robert, 
Nancy, and Richard. His youngest built and 
mantains the webpage for the 150th batallion, 
honoring his father’s memory and the accom-
plishments of the unit.

JARED 
HUFFMAN 
HONORING 
MAYOR GARY PHILLIPS 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Gary Phillips as he re-
tires a distinguished tenure of public service 
as Mayor of the City of San Rafael. 
Mayor Phillips earned his undergraduate de-
gree and Master of Business Administration 
from Humboldt State University. He applied 
his education throughout his professional ca-
reer as a certified public accountant and busi-
ness executive as well as an elected official. 
He and his wife Linda settled in San Rafael 48 
years ago. They proceeded to raise a family 
and became committed to improving the qual-
ity of life for the residents of San Rafael. 
Mayor Phillips’ first role as an elected official 
for the San Rafael community was as a mem-
ber of the former Dixie School Board, where 
he served for eight years, including twice as 
president. He was elected to the City Council 
in 1994 and served three terms before retiring 
in 2007. In 2011, he decided to run for Mayor 
when Mayor Al Boro retired after nearly 20 
years of service. As an elected official, Mayor 
Phillips drew upon his business acumen, 
standing up for small businesses, working to 
improve education, and responding to the 
changing needs of the community. 
Over the years, Mayor Phillips developed a 
deep record for going to bat for San Rafael 
residents, demonstrating steady leadership 
through trying times. This includes navigating 
financial challenges, homelessness and hous-
ing, securing funding to improve fire service, 
and the challenges associated with the 
COVID–19 pandemic. At every critical moment 
Mayor Phillips has worked to provide the peo-
ple of San Rafael with the support and re-
sources they need. He is also known at City 
Hall for his ability to form consensus and ad-
here to principles, and for his thoughtful, 
hands-on approach to leadership—invaluable 
qualities in a mayor. 
It has been my pleasure to work closely with 
Mayor Phillips’ on a number of key issues, in-
cluding homelessness, gun violence reform, 
discrimination, and securing funds to dredge 
the San Rafael Canal. I have also had the 
pleasure of working with him in his role as 
Chair of the Sonoma-Marin Area Rail Transit 
(SMART) to find solutions for rail and 
multimodal transportation through the down-
town. 
Mayor Gary Phillips has been an unwaver-
ing champion for his community across his 
nearly 30 years, and I am certain his public 
service is not complete. Madam Speaker, I re-
spectfully ask that you join me in honoring him 
for his many positive contributions to the resi-
dents of San Rafael and the entire North Bay 
Area and in wishing him well in his next en-
deavors.

IN HONOR OF DENNIS MCBRIDE 
HON. JACKIE SPEIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Dennis McBride as he leaves the 
Board of Education of the Redwood City Ele-
mentary School District after serving 17 years. 
This brief introduction of Dennis does not 
begin to do him justice. 
Let me offer you the image of the Energizer 
Bunny, unceasingly banging on a drum and 
looking a bit cool at the same time. This is 
Dennis. Let me also acknowledge that this 
might be the only time that comments in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD refer to a Certified 
Public Accountant as ‘‘cool.’’ The word fits 
Dennis. 
He began his love affair with education as 
a parent volunteer with the cooperative 
preschools in which his two children were stu-
dents. He then hopped to the nearby elemen-
tary school where he became active in the site 
council and organized field trips, such as 
when he took a class to visit a leading com-
puter manufacturer. He served on the site 
councils of every school attended by his two 
children. While some parents coach soccer, 
Dennis coached other parents and teachers in 
how to solve problems, raise funds, helped 
teachers, and did so much more. That’s a 
drum-banging, cool dad. 
As a CPA, Dennis volunteered his profes-
sional talents for numerous parcel tax and 
bond measures. The funds raised built class-
rooms throughout the elementary and high 
school districts and sustained the curriculum 
to the best degree possible despite economic 
circumstances. It is estimated that over 25,000 
pre-K through eighth grade students, and ad-
ditional high school and community college 
students, were benefitted by Dennis’ work. In 
the buildings created, in the music programs 
sustained, in the special education students 
aided, and in dozens of other ways large and 
small, Dennis created a legacy that will last for 
at least two generations. 
Dennis has always been unassuming in his 
collaborative ventures with other school district 
trustees from around the county, but many 
eventually made their way to Dennis as they 
sought answers to tough financial and per-
sonnel issues. For years he’s been a leader 
within the San Mateo County School Boards 
Association, going so far as to find new lead-
ers for recognition through the association’s 
annual Kent Award. 
How much energy does this man exude? 
Well, ask yourself, how many school district 
trustees visit nighttime staff to see how they 
are holding up? How many trustees show up 
in the morning at dangerous intersections to 
witness what parents are worried about? How 
many trustees visit every school in the district, 
check out cafeterias, write handwritten thank 
you notes to teachers, staff and parents? 
Many would show up at school events when 
invited, but how many are known on cam-
puses where middle schoolers call out their 
names? This is Redwood City’s public servant, 
Dennis McBride. 
Not content to contribute to his community 
solely through its schools, Dennis served as 
the treasurer or board member or both for 
multiple community organizations including the 
Police Activities League, the workforce hous-
ing committee of the school board, and on the 
board overseeing faculty/staff housing for the 
San Mateo County Community College Dis-
trict. He’s also served on the education advi-
sory committees of two members of the state 
legislature and as treasurer for the Sequoia 
Awards, a community scholarship program 
recognizing low income high school students 
with 
big 
college 
or 
technical 
education 
dreams. 
Dennis McBride’s contributions don’t end 
with education. From 2006 to 2013, he served 
as treasurer for the Santa Clara University 
Law School Board of the Northern California 
Innocence Project and on the Board of Direc-
tors of the Boys and Girls Club of the Penin-
sula. 
In all those cartoonish ads for batteries, 
some of the other bunnies run out of juice but 
the Energizer Bunny keeps going. In contrast, 
I think even the Energizer Bunny would give 
up before Dennis McBride. It has been my 
privilege and honor to serve with Dennis. We 
are sorry to see him go, and so sad that his 
drum will not be beating for us again. We wish 
Dennis, his wife, Lori, and his sons Cory and 
Casey much happiness in the coming years. 
Madam Speaker, a one-man band has now 
retired from public life, but the beat goes on 
because everyone wants to make Dennis 
proud as they follow his lead, his laughter, and 
his kind heart.

FROM HAARETZ: ‘‘ISRAEL’S WAR 
ON PALESTINIAN CHILDREN’’ BY 
GIDEON LEVY 
HON. BETTY McCOLLUM 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, when 
military force and violence are used to op-
press, dehumanize, and deny fundamental 
human rights to an entire civilian population— 
women, men, and children—it is an injustice 
that is antithetical to America’s values and our 
self-proclaimed belief in promoting dignity, 
equality, and justice for all. The Israeli military 
occupation of Palestine is such an injustice. 
Settlement expansion, home demolitions, the 
military detention of children and state spon-
sored violence are the weapons used as Israel 
seeks to annex Palestinian land and destroy 
any prospects for Palestinian self-determina-
tion. 
The violence used by Israel against Pal-
estinians, especially children, is shocking and 
abhorrent. Late last week a particularly gro-
tesque act of state sponsored violence took 
place when a 13 year-old Palestinian boy liv-
ing under military occupation in the West Bank

December 7, 2020 
was shot in the abdomen by an Israeli soldier. 
The child, Ali Abu Aalya, later died. 
According to a statement from the United 
Nations Children’s Fund, UNICEF, issued on 
December 4, 2020, ‘‘A 13 year-old Palestinian 
boy was shot and killed today in the West 
Bank in the State of Palestine. In the past two 
weeks. four other Palestinian children were 
shot and severely injured in the West Bank 
. . .’’ 
The UNICEF statement continues, ‘‘From 
January to September this year, according to 
UN data to date, 232 incidents involving the 
injury of Palestinian children, some of whom 
sustained long-term damage. UNICEF urges 
Israeli authorities to fully respect, protect, and 
fulfil the rights of all children and refrain from 
using violence against children, in accordance 
with international law.’’ 
Such a rebuke from UNICEF, calling on 
Israel, a U.S. ally that receives $3.8 billion in 
U.S. taxpayer funded military assistance, to 
‘‘refrain from using violence against children’’ 
should make every Member of Congress and 
American citizen question whether U.S. mili-
tary assistance is being used to injure and kill 
Palestinian children. 
I strongly urge the incoming administration 
of President-Elect Biden to investigate Israel’s 
killing of Ali Abu Aalya, as well as Israel’s on- 
going pattern of using state sponsored military 
violence against Palestinian children. Mem-
bers of Congress and the American people 
deserve to know whether U.S. taxpayer fund-
ing to Israel’s Ministry of Defense is being 
used directly or indirectly to facilitate or enable 
violence against Palestinian children. Commit-
ting human rights abuses with impunity and 
with U.S. taxpayer aid is intolerable and there 
must be accountability on the part of the U.S. 
Government. 
Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 2407, 
Promoting Human Rights for Palestinian Chil-
dren Living Under Israeli Military Occupation 
Act. The bill deems the military detention of 
children a gross human rights violation and 
prohibits U.S. aid to support, enable, or facili-
tate such abuse of children. The military de-
tention of children is a systemic practice of the 
Government of Israel used against Palestinian 
children as a tactic that violates international 
humanitarian law in order to maintain a per-
manent military occupation of Palestinian 
lands. There are twenty-four courageous col-
leagues who have joined me as co-sponsors 
of H.R. 2407 and I am deeply appreciative of 
their commitment to defending human rights 
and the rights of children. 
‘‘Israel’s War on Palestinian Children’’ was 
published on December 5th in the Israeli 
newspaper HAARTEZ. In a column by Gideon 
Levy, the systemic brutality and violence in-
flicted on Palestinian children by the Govern-
ment of Israel is described. Mr. Levy writes 
about his own country, Israel, this way: ‘‘What 
would you think of a regime that allows the 
shooting of children, that abducts them in their 
sleep and razes their schools? That’s exactly 
what you must think of the regime here in our 
country.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
Mr. Levy’s powerfully honest column. I would 
like Members to read this column and answer 
Mr. Levy’s question: What would you think of 
a government that allows the shooting of chil-
dren? 
[HAARETZ.com, Dec. 5, 2020] 
ISRAEL’S WAR ON PALESTINIAN CHILDREN 
(By Gideon Levy) 
Last week, we were in the Al-Arroub ref-
ugee camp, searching for an open area in 
which to sit, for fear of the coronavirus. 
There wasn’t one. In a camp in which house 
touches house, whose alleys are the width of 
a man and strewn with garbage, there’s no-
where to sit outside. One can only dream of 
a garden or a bench; there isn’t even a side-
walk. This is where Basel al-Badawi lives. A 
year ago, soldiers shot his brother dead, be-
fore his eyes, for no reason. Two weeks ago, 
Basel was snatched from his bed on a cold 
night and taken, barefoot, for questioning. 
We sat in his family’s cramped home and re-
alized there was no ‘‘out’’ to go to. While we 
were there, Israeli soldiers blocked the en-
trance to the camp, as they occasionally do, 
arbitrarily, and the sense of suffocation only 
grew. 
This is Basel’s world and this is his reality. 
He is 16, a bereaved brother, who was ab-
ducted from his bed in the dark of night by 
soldiers. He has nowhere to go to except for 
school, which is closed for part of the week 
due to COVID–19. Basel is free now, more for-
tunate than certain other children and teen-
agers. Around 170 of them are currently de-
tained in Israel. Other children are shot by 
soldiers, wounded and sometimes killed, 
with no distinction made between children 
and adults—a Palestinian is a Palestinian— 
or between a life-threatening situation and a 
‘‘public disturbance.’’ 
On Friday they killed Ali Abu Alia, a 13- 
year-old boy. It was a lethal shot to the ab-
domen. No one could remain indifferent to 
the sight of his innocent face in photographs, 
and his last picture—in a shroud, his face ex-
posed, his eyes closed, as he was carried to 
burial in his village. Ali, as he did every 
week, went with his friends to demonstrate 
against the wild and violent outposts that 
sprouted out of the settlement of Kokhav 
Hashahar, taking over the remaining land of 
his village, al-Mughayir. There is nothing 
more just than the struggle of this village, 
there is nothing more heinous than the use 
of lethal force against protesters and there is 
no possibility that shooting Ali in the abdo-
men could have been justifiable. In Israel, of 
course, no one showed any interest over the 
weekend in the death of a child, one more 
child. 
Up until the current school year, around 50 
children from the shepherding community of 
Ras a-Tin studied at the school in al- 
Mughayir, the village of the deceased boy. 
They had to walk about 15 kilometers (9.3 
miles) each day, round trip, to attend. This 
year their parents, with the help of a Euro-
pean Commission aid organization based in 
Italy, built them a modest, charming school 
in the village. Israel’s Civil Administration 
is threatening to demolish it, and in the 
meantime it is harassing the pupils and 
teachers with surprise visits to check wheth-
er the toilets had been, God forbid, con-
nected to a water pipe—in a village that was 
never connected to the power grid or the 
water supply. The children of Ras a-Tin must 
have known Ali, their former classmate, now 
dead. 
The children did not know Malek Issa, of 
Isawiyah, in East Jerusalem. The 9-year-old 
boy lost an eye after it was hit by a sponge- 
tipped bullet fired by an Israeli police offi-
cer. On Thursday the Justice Ministry de-
partment that examines allegations of police 
misconduct announced that no one would be 
charged in the shooting, after 10 months of 
intensive investigation. It was enough for 
the policemen involved to claim that stones 
had been thrown at them, perhaps one of 
them hit the boy. But no video shows stones 
being thrown, nor is there any other evi-
dence of this. Ali’s killers can also sleep in 
peace: No one will prosecute them. All they 
did was to kill a Palestinian child. 
These and many other incidents are taking 
place during a period that is among the 
quietest in the West Bank. This is the terror 
taking place, committed by the state. When 
we hear of such incidents in vicious dictator-
ships—children who are snatched from their 
beds in the middle of the night, one boy who 
was shot in the eye, another who was shot 
and killed—it sends shivers down our spine. 
Shooting at demonstrators? At children? 
Where do such things happen? Not in some 
faraway land, but rather just an hour’s drive 
from your home; not in some dark regime, 
but in the only democracy. 
What would you think of a regime that al-
lows the shooting of children, that abducts 
them in their sleep and razes their schools? 
That’s exactly what you must think of the 
regime here in our country.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BOYD 
GRANT 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a former Fresno State basket-
ball coach, Mr. Boyd Grant, who passed away 
at the age of 87. He was a father, friend and 
one of the finest coaches in history. 
Boyd, who grew up in the agricultural region 
of Idaho, had a love for basketball. He played 
for three seasons at Colorado State University 
as a guard, after transferring from Snow Col-
lege in Utah. After college, he returned to his 
alma mater to serve as the assistant basket-
ball coach, a position he held for nearly 12 
years. In 1961, the teams coached by he and 
legendary Coach Jim Williams, won a con-
ference championship and participated in four 
NCAA tournaments. 
From 1972 to 1974, Mr. Grant served as an 
assistant coach at the University of Kentucky, 
before beginning his head coaching career at 
the College of Southern Idaho, a junior college 
that he led to a national championship a year 
later. 
Boyd furthered his career by serving as a 
highly successful head coach at California 
State University, Fresno. During his tenure, he 
led the Bulldogs to three Western Athletic 
Conference championships, three NCAA Tour-
naments and the 1983 NIT Championship. He 
was inducted to the Fresno Athletic Hall of 
Fame in 1993. He was also inducted into the

National Junior College Basketball Hall of 
Fame. 
Boyd’s leadership and coaching strength-
ened Fresno State’s basketball program. The 
team led the nation in scoring and defense in 
his first season and were ranked in the top 10 
in every one of his nine years as coach. His 
career at Fresno State included a record of 
194–74 over his nine seasons, including the 
winning the NIT championship in 1983 and 
earning spots in the NCAA Tournament in 
1981, 1982, and in 1984. 
He left Fresno State in 1986 and a year 
later, was named head coach at Colorado 
State, where he led the Rams to two NCAA 
tournaments within the four years he was 
there. After a long and successful career, he 
retired from coaching in 1991. 
Boyd impacted the lives of people who sur-
rounded him, with many of his former students 
describing him as a father. Boyd lived a great 
life doing what he loved the most, coaching 
and playing basketball. 
He is survived by his wife, Mary Jean; their 
son, Kevin, and two daughters Leslie and Lori. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating and honoring the life of a 
basketball legend, Mr. Boyd Grant. His teach-
ings and legacy will be remembered for many 
years to come. We join his family, friends and 
community in honoring his great life and leg-
acy.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
TIMOTHY BISHOP 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI

Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in honor of Timothy Bishop, who 
passed away Tuesday, November 17 at the 
age of 64. 
Timothy was born in May of 1956 in El 
Paso, Texas to Martha and Graham Bishop. 
For six years, Mr. Bishop served his country in 
the United States Navy as an E–5 Pettie Offi-
cer First Class. He soon joined the Mississippi

service, Timothy retired from Day-Brite. 
In addition to his military and community 
service, Timothy Bishop was an avid sports-
man. He was a competitive shooter, hunter, 
and a life endowment member of the NRA. 
Mr. Bishop also served as a Golden Eagle 
sponsor for youth NRA programs. 
Mr. Bishop is preceded in death by his wife, 
Jonnie Fay Umfress Bishop and his father. He 
is survived by his mother, Martha Bishop; his 
son, Jamie; his daughter, Katie; three siblings, 
and four grandchildren. 
It is because of selfless individuals like Mr. 
Bishop, who dedicate their lives to protecting 
this great nation that we can boast the lib-
erties we most value. I am grateful for his 
service and share my deepest condolences 
with his family and loved ones. 
HONORING MIDSHIPMAN 1ST 
CLASS SYDNEY BARBER 
HON. C.A. DUTCH RUPPERSBERGER 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise before you today to honor Midshipman 
First Class Sydney Barber, the first Black fe-
male to be selected as Brigade Commander at 
the United States Naval Academy, the highest 
leadership position within the student body. 
A native of Lake Forest, Illinois, Midshipman 
Barber graduated from Lake Forest High 
School in 2017. As a mechanical engineering 
major at the Naval Academy who has been 
selected to commission into the U.S. Marine 
Corps, Midshipman Barber has been on the 
Superintendent’s list. She completed a 7-week 
internship with the Department of Energy’s 
Lawrence 
Livermore 
National 
Laboratory 
where she was instrumental in breakthrough 
research on bio-electrochernical uses for car-
bon nanotubes. 
Midshipman Barber was named a 2020 Tru-
man Scholar National Finalist, focusing her re-
search on developing legislative strategies to 
address education disparities in minority com-
munities. She has created a STEM outreach 
program that leveraged mentoring, literature, 
and service lessons to benefit middle-school 
aged girls of color. She also helped create the 
Midshipman Diversity Team, made up of more 
than 180 midshipmen, faculty, and alumni, to 
promote diversity, inclusion and equality within 
the brigade. 
Amid these efforts, Midshipman Barber 
served as the plebe summer 13th Company 
Executive Officer and currently serves as the 
brigade’s 1st Regimental Executive Officer. 
She is the co-President of the Navy Fellow-
ship of Christian Athletes Club and the Sec-
retary for the National Society of Black Engi-
neers Club. She belongs to the gospel choir 
and the Midshipman Black Studies Club. 
A walk-on sprinter and hurdler on the Acad-
emy’s varsity track and field team, Mid-
shipman Barber currently holds the record for 
the outdoor 4x400 meter relay. 
As Brigade Commander, Midshipman Bar-
ber will head the Academy’s day-to-day activi-
ties and train approximately 4,500 mid-
shipmen. Midshipman Barber will be just the 
16th woman selected for this position in the 44 
years that women have been attending the 
Naval Academy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me 
today in honoring the achievement of Mid-
shipman First Class Sydney Barber. Her serv-
ice to our country is deserving of the utmost 
gratitude. On behalf of my colleagues on the 
Board of Visitors, I offer her our sincerest con-
gratulations and best wishes for a successful 
tenure as Brigade Commander.

HONORING RECIPIENTS OF THE IN-
NOVATION 
AND 
ADAPTATION 
RECOGNITION 
HON. ADRIAN SMITH 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Madam Speaker, 
today I honor nine individuals and businesses 
from Nebraska’s Third District for receiving the 
Innovation and Adaptation Recognition. 
Throughout the 75 counties of the Third Dis-
trict, Nebraskans know our communities grow 
when individuals step up: helping their neigh-
bors, being involved, and creating opportuni-
ties for themselves and others. 
In August, I called for nominations as part of 
a new initiative to acknowledge the contribu-
tions of individuals, organizations, and those 
who are working every day to improve and 
help their communities in the current environ-
ment. 
Billy Estes is the Executive Director of the 
Midwest Theater of Scottsbluff. Midwest Thea-
ter’s programming, which includes live per-
formances, orchestras, and concerts, makes 
an important contribution to the cultural and 
social experiences of Nebraska’s panhandle. 
When the Coronavirus pandemic reached 
western Nebraska, under the guidance of Mr. 
Estes, the Midwest Theater partnered with the 
Legacy of the Plains Museum to create the 
Skyview Drive-in Movie Theater. As the pan-
demic progressed, this venture proved so pop-
ular they outgrew their location and had to 
move to larger accommodations. Thanks to 
the creativity and leadership of Mr. Estes, in 
spite of the pandemic, the Midwest Theater 
has continued to thrive throughout 2020. 
Grand Central Foods of York is owned by 
the Warren Thomas family. Mr. Thomas prides 
himself on his commitment to the York com-
munity. In ‘‘normal’’ times, Warren and the 
Grand Central Team are the first to ask where 
they can help with a project or how can they 
partner on events. The selflessness shown by 
everyone at Grand Central is a testament to 
the example of the ownership. Within a few 
days of the pandemic’s arrival to York, Warren 
purchased a second grocery delivery van, and 
expanded his service to the entire community. 
Because Warren believes in positive reinforce-
ment, he encouraged his customers to wear a 
mask while in his store by offering a 5 percent 
discount on their purchases. He is an active 
member of many community groups, and his 
passion and commitment to his community is 
unmatched. 
Alyssa Cochnar of Crete is the leader of 
Gold Star Martial Arts of Crete and Seward. At 
26 years old, she is already a 5th degree 
black belt, chief instructor, and co-owner of 
the martial arts facility. When directed health 
measures forced Gold Star to close in-person 
training classes, she spearheaded the process 
of creating online modules for her students to 
continue their training independently. Before 
long, she began offering Zoom Classes to pro-
vide her students with another safe and flexi-
ble option to continue their training and ex-
plore expanded experiences to encourage 
healthy eating habits and socialization while 
social distancing. I commend her positive atti-
tude and commitment to an enriching edu-
cational experience for all her students, re-
gardless of their experience level. 
Bryce Jensen is the Director of the World 
Theatre of Kearney, His adaptability, espe-
cially during the pandemic, demonstrates his 
commitment to his community. Though the or-
ganization he operates, the World Theatre, 
was closed due to the pandemic, his outside 
of the box thinking inspired him to create, 
through strategic community collaborations, a 
World Theatre drive-in. Not only would this en-
sure the World Theatre could still bring respite 
to many during these trying times, but it re-
stored a drive-in movie experience to the

Kearney region, reminding many of the happy 
memories of their youth. 
Kirk Zeller grew up in the community of Ra-
venna, Nebraska. After high school, he at-
tended university and later worked in the med-
ical field in Japan. Kirk returned to the United 
States, first living in California before returning 
to his hometown of Ravenna to raise his fam-
ily. Since returning to Ravenna he has turned 
the former Carnegie library into an entrepre-
neurship center, purchased a downtown build-
ing and renovated the upper story apartment. 
He recently directed a movie in Ravenna and 
Los Angeles which premiered at the Kearney 
World Theatre’s drive-in, all while working on 
bringing new medical products to the market. 
He is a great story of returning to small home-
town Nebraska and reinvesting in his commu-
nity. 
Dick Cochran of Kearney founded the non-
profit Hot Meals USA in October 2017. By 
February 2018, he signed a memorandum of 
understanding with the American Red Cross to 
call on him for assistance in wildfires, floods, 
tornadoes and other disasters. Every time 
Dick and Hot Meals USA are called upon, no 
less than 150 volunteers have supported the 
program. Since their inception, the policy has 
been to feed anyone, no questions asked. In 
just over three years, they have provided more 
than 155,000 meals across the country. 
John McCoy is the CEO of Orthman Manu-
facturing of Lexington. He embraced the op-
portunity to help feed families that come from 
a poverty background in the Lexington area. 
When he first brought in Hot Meals USA to the 
community, his business, Orthman Manufac-
turing, partnered with the Lexington Commu-
nity Foundation and others to provide over 
1,000 hot meals on a weekly basis to families. 
He then made feeding the community a pri-
ority as he and his employees took the lead to 
distribute USDA food boxes. When schools re-
opened in August, John was there for the 
community again. He donated 3,700 masks to 
Lexington Public Schools to make sure no stu-
dent was unprepared for their school experi-
ence. John’s actions represent his commit-
ment to all members of the Lexington commu-
nity. 
Anthony May of Hastings is an entre-
preneur. When the pandemic forced the tap-
room of Steeple Brewery Anthony co-owns to 
close, he quickly responded. Collaborating 
with Wave Pizza Company, the brewery’s res-
taurant partner, he developed a community 
delivery program, which eventually offered 
their products to 21 communities in south-cen-
tral Nebraska. This innovative program en-
sured many Nebraskans, whose communities 
either do not have a grocery or now lacked a 
local place to eat due to the pandemic, had 
ready access to an easy to use food delivery 
program. 
Matt Dennis and Michael Stepp are more 
than small town business owners; they are 
master story tellers with a dream. What began 
as two friends making copper mugs in an old 
shop has turned into an opportunity to re-
shape the meaning of community. When they 
purchased 
the 
building 
they 
now 
call 
Handlebend, their goal was to create a com-
munity of small businesses under one roof 
and welcome the community with open arms 
to come and enjoy a mule, coffee, or gather 
and with friends and family. Though the 
Coronavirus 
pandemic 
has 
caused 
the 
Handlebend community to adapt their ap-
proach, the dreams of these men to create an 
innovative experience for the O’Neill commu-
nity continue. 
I am proud to honor these individuals today, 
and I thank them for their many contributions 
to Nebraska.

HONORING ELLEN DUNLAP 
HON. JAMES P. McGOVERN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, it is a 
great honor to rise today in recognition of 
Ellen Dunlap of West Boylston, Massachu-
setts, who is stepping down as President of 
the American Antiquarian Society after 28 ex-
traordinary years in that position. 
America’s history, Madam Speaker, is our 
greatest natural resource. It speaks to us 
across the years and serves as a source of 
great inspiration and hope for people across 
this country. It is an acknowledgement of 
America’s triumphs and our imperfections; a 
reminder of who we are and who we’re called 
to be. 
Ellen is the President of the American Anti-
quarian Society—a remarkable institution in 
Worcester, Massachusetts founded by Revolu-
tionary War patriot and printer Isaiah Thomas 
in 1812 and dedicated to preserving our treas-
ured history. The Society serves as an incom-
parable resource for scholars and historians 
and a preeminent and comprehensive deposi-
tory of American history and culture that is un-
paralleled in size and scope. 
As President—the first woman to hold that 
post, by the way—Ellen has spent her career 
not only preserving our past but bringing it to 
life in a way that truly excites others. Ellen’s 
work and leadership are extraordinary, she 
has the incredible talent and vision to clarify 
and animate history so that all of us can better 
understand and learn from our collective past. 
She has worked tirelessly to open up the Soci-
ety’s extraordinary archives to a wider audi-
ence, including teachers, scholars, artists, and 
writers. Under her leadership, the Society un-
dertook a massive effort to digitizing their col-
lections. Ellen also spearheaded the construc-
tion of a major expansion and renovation of 
the Society’s home at Antiquarian Hall and 
has sought to engage the Worcester commu-
nity in new and exciting ways like free public 
programs 
and 
partnerships 
with 
cultural 
groups. 
Ellen has chaired the board of the Worces-
ter Cultural Coalition and the Massachusetts 
Foundation for the Humanities, and she has 
advised many prestigious institutions such as 
the Library of Congress and George Washing-
ton’s Mount Vernon. Ellen’s vision and leader-
ship earned the American Antiquarian Society 
a National Humanities Medal from President 
Barack Obama in 2013. 
Madam Speaker, there is so much more I 
could say about how grateful I am that Ellen 
has devoted her life to preserving our Amer-
ican story and how lucky we are that the 
American Antiquarian Society calls Worcester 
home. But let me end on a personal note to 
say that Ellen is a treasured friend and a won-
derful person, I’m grateful that I’ve had the 
privilege of getting to know and work with her, 
and I know she will continue to give back to 
our community in the years ahead. 
On behalf of the United States Congress, 
the people of Massachusetts’ Second Con-
gressional District, and all the people who will 
benefit from her incredible work for genera-
tions to come, it is my great honor and privi-
lege to recognize Ellen Dunlap and to thank 
her for her remarkable service to our commu-
nity, our commonwealth, and our country.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF SADIE 
J. HOLLAND 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in honor of Sadie J. Holland, who 
passed away Tuesday, November 24 at North 
Mississippi Medical Center in Tupelo. 
Sadie was born on January 31, 1933 to Joe 
Thomas and Christine Roebuck Monts. She 
grew up in the Palmetto community and at-
tended Palmetto and Verona High School. On 
December 10, 1949, Sadie J. Monts married 
J.C. Holland and later moved to the Bass/ 
Gandy farm south of Plantersville. Sadie J, 
J.C., and their six sons dwelled on the re-
nowned ‘‘Sadie J. Farm’’ that stretched over 
9,000 acres across three north Mississippi 
counties. In 1966, Sadie and J.C. were named 
Outstanding Farmers of America, the first Mis-
sissippians to earn the title. Her devotion to 
agriculture was exemplified by founding the 
first integrated 4H club in the state. 
Mrs. Holland dedicated fifty years to public 
service and continued her family’s legacy of 
egalitarianism. She became the first female 
school bus driver in the state, and in 1984 she 
was the first woman elected as Mayor of 
Nettleton. She relished the opportunity to 
serve her community, and for nearly two dec-
ades she was the Municipal Court adminis-
trator for the Tupelo Municipal Court. In 1998 
she was elected Lee County Justice Court 
Judge before retiring just last year. She was a 
dedicated member of the United Methodist 
Church and took every opportunity to minister 
to her community through Holland Funeral Di-
rectors. In 2019, she was honored by the Mis-
sissippi Legislature for her lifetime of service 
to Mississippi. 
Mrs. Holland is preceded in death by her 
husband J.C. who passed away in 2016. 
She is survived by her sons Billy Joe, Don, 
Steve, Perry, John, and Jimmy, 21 grand-
children and 37 great-grandchildren. 
Sadie J. Holland, the matriarch of a remark-
able family, will be deeply missed by all those 
who had the opportunity to know her.

BIG CAT PUBLIC SAFETY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 3, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as an 
original sponsor and a senior Member of the 
House of Representatives, I rise in strong sup-
port of this bipartisan bill, H.R. 1380, the ‘‘Big 
Cat Public Safety Act’’, which ends the owner-
ship of dangerous big cats as pets as well as 
prohibits exhibitors from allowing public con-
tact with cubs. 
First and foremost, I would like to thank 
Congressman MIKE QUIGLEY for his leadership 
on this legislation. 
Across the country, thousands of big cats 
like tigers, lions, leopards, and pumas are kept 
in miserable, insecure, and unsafe conditions 
by irresponsible owners. 
These animals often come from a vicious 
cycle of breeding perpetuated by unscrupulous 
facilities looking to make a profit off of ‘‘cub 
petting’’ or photo opportunities. 
It is an issue that causes immeasurable ani-
mal suffering and introduces inexcusable 
threats to human safety. 
Big cats are wild animals and undoubtedly 
suffer when kept as pets. 
They are often purchased as babies, and 
private owners are typically unable to manage 
them once they are fully grown. 
As a result, the animals are frequently left to 
languish in grossly inadequate conditions, 
often being deprived of sufficient space, ade-
quate veterinary care, a nutritious diet, and 
enrichment. 
Furthermore, it is common procedure for 
some roadside zoos to inhumanely separate 
babies from their mothers, so that they can 
charge the public to pet and play with the 
cubs. 
This is a cruel and unhealthy practice that 
can cause not only lifelong psychological prob-
lems but also premature death for the cubs. 
These young cats quickly outgrow their use-
fulness in the cub handling industry and most 
often end up being sent to substandard 
‘‘zoos,’’ sold into the exotic pet trade, or pos-
sibly even killed and sold for parts. 
This vicious cycle of exploitation and con-
stant breeding must be stopped. 
Currently, state laws regarding private own-
ership of big cats are inconsistent, and some 
states have few or no laws regarding the 
keeping of big cats. 
Madam Speaker, a uniform federal law is 
necessary to end this dangerous industry once 
and for all. 
The ‘‘Big Cat Public Safety Act’’ is a simple 
and straightforward solution to the devastating 
and growing crisis of negligent big cat breed-
ing and ownership. 
According to Big Cat Rescue, there have 
been more than 700 dangerous incidents in 
the U.S. involving big cats since 1990. 
These incidents include hundreds of human 
injuries, maulings, and deaths. 
In many of these cases, the animals were 
shot and killed, often by first responders who 
are not equipped to deal with these situations, 
thereby also putting them in harm’s way. 
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have 
been a staunch advocate for protecting endan-
gered species. 
Most recently, I introduced H.R. 4804, ‘‘the 
ProTECT Act’’, which amends the Endangered 
Species Act of 1973 in order to prohibit the 
taking for a trophy of any endangered or 
threatened species of fish or wildlife in the 
United States and the importation of endan-
gered and threatened species trophies into the 
United States. 
H.R. 4804 is an updated version of my bill 
from the 114th Congress, H.R. 3448, the 
‘‘Cecil the Lion Endangered and Threatened 
Species Act of 2015’’. 
I was in Africa when the iconic Cecil the 
Lion, was murdered for sport. 
It was a disgraceful act that showcased a 
complete lack of respect for these wondrous 
animals, and it compelled me to fiercely advo-
cate for the preservation of our wildlife across 
the world. 
Madam Speaker, today we have an impor-
tant opportunity to once again come together 
and protect endangered species by passing 
H.R. 1380, the ‘‘Big Cat Public Safety Act’’. 
For the safety of our first responders, of our 
community, and for these majestic animals, 
we need this vital piece of legislation. 
I am honored to be a leader on this issue, 
and so I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to join me in voting for H.R. 1380.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
ROBERT SHANKERMAN 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam, Speaker, I rise today 
along with my colleague, Mr. COX, to honor 
the life of a great doctor and San Joaquin Val-
ley resident, Dr. Robert Shankerman, who 
passed away September 19, 2020. He was a 
father, brother, doctor and a caring leader in 
our community. 
Robert was a renowned doctor who spent 
many years championing disadvantaged and 
rural communities. He graduated from Tulare 
University and completed his post-graduate 
education at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
Minnesota; one of the nation’s best hospitals. 
Since 2014, Robert served at the United 
Health Centers (UHC). He was the Chief Med-
ical Officer for UHC of San Joaquin Valley and 
was responsible for clinical operations at 21 
health centers in the Central Valley. UHC pro-
vides services to more than 125,000 patients 
in Fresno, Tulare, and Kings counties. 
During his time at UHC, Dr. Shankerman 
established the UHC/UCSF Family Practice 
Residency program at the Parlier Health Cen-
ter, where he also provided services to pa-
tients. He recruited, trained and placed med-
ical practitioners as the organization grew, 
which helped lead to its current success. 
While in this position, he mentored more than 
155 medical professionals, including UHC 
medical staff, recent graduates from various 
residency programs, along with national and 
international transfers. 
Robert was affiliated with the UC San Diego 
Medical School and served as an Associate 
Clinical Professor of Medicine. Previously he 
was Chief Medical Officer for Clinica Sierra 
Vista. He was a diplomat for the American 
Board of lnternal Medicine and certified HIV 
specialist. In 2001, he was awarded the pres-
tigious physician recognition award from the 
American Medical Association. 
Robert was highly respected by many peo-
ple across the San Joaquin Valley. He dedi-
cated most of his time treating and helping mi-
grant workers and underprivileged commu-
nities. He worked long shifts ranging from 14 
to 15-hour days and was committed to helping 
others. 
He is survived by his partner of more than 
20 years, Dr. Regis Debarros, a physician with 
United Health Centers; his father Floyd 
Shankerman, sister Cindy Loewenberg; and 
brothers Steven and Jason Shankerman. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
us in celebrating and honoring the life of a 
great champion and doctor, Dr. Robert 
Shankerman. His teachings and legacy will be 
remembered for many years to come. We join 
his family, friends and community in honoring 
his great life and legacy.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, December 7, 2020 
Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Catherine Mahanpour for her 
service as she departs the city council of Fos-
ter City and the board of directors of the 
Estero Municipal Improvement District. As she 
leaves office, a dignified voice for neighbor-
hoods and a high quality of life is departing. 
Catherine graduated from the University of 
Maine in 1990 with high distinction and a B.A. 
in Political Science. Five years later she ma-
triculated to Golden Gate University School of 
Law and attained her degree in 1998. She 
was licensed to practice in 1999. She served 
as an adjunct professor at her alma mater on 
multiple occasions since, and as a member of 
the Advisory Board of the California State Bar 
of the East Bay. Since 2013, she has been a 
court appointed special advocate for foster 
children in San Mateo County. 
When she ran for election in 2015, Cath-
erine stressed the need to prevent the ‘‘over-
growth’’ of Foster City and the deleterious im-
pacts of traffic on the quality of life of resi-
dents. She called for a pause in housing con-
struction and a dialogue with regional agen-
cies to find choices about population growth 
that met the sensibilities of the neighborhoods 
she hoped to represent. She also called for a 
different tone in council meetings, urging re-
spect for differing opinions during council 
meetings. She supported a local school bond 
and promised to watch over the funds should 
voters approve the measure. 
During her service on the council, she was 
chair of the C/CAG legislative committee, the 
city’s representative to the mosquito abate-
ment district, and served on the county’s long-
range planning committee and the Silicon Val-
ley Recovery Roundtable for COVID–19 Re-
sponse. She was the driving force for the 
council’s new Code of Conduct, adopted on 
November 2, 2020. She helped change the 
agenda-setting process and brought trans-
parency to the process of setting agenda top-
ics. 
Foster City is laced with beautiful lagoons 
that are the responsibility of the city. Dan-
gerous accidents can also happen on these

waterways and Catherine encouraged the cre-
ation of a safety outreach campaign to prevent 
deaths and injuries. She also advocated that 
Foster City become an ‘‘age-friendly’’ city and 
progress was made in 2020 with an applica-
tion submitted to AARP/WHO in November. 
When the creation of the countywide elec-
tricity aggregation joint powers authority (JPA) 
was considered, she was a strong advocate. 
This JPA results in 98 percent of city house-
holds and businesses receiving cleaner elec-
tricity at lower prices, saving nearly $1 million 
annually for city residents. The JPA will also 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions from elec-
tricity usage by 85 percent when compared to 
2016. 
Importantly, Catherine and her colleagues 
approved the construction of an improved 
levee, and city residents responded with an af-
firmative vote of 80 percent. Construction of 
this project began this year. 
As the pandemic hit, Catherine and her col-
leagues on the city council hit back. They ap-
proved $10,000 grants to fifty small busi-
nesses to assist with rent payments and nego-
tiated an additional year of reduced rent for 
many elderly, low income, residents at Fosters 
Landing when those residents would otherwise 
be forced to move during the pandemic. Cath-
erine and her colleagues also approved a 
$10,000 grant to the San Mateo Foster City 
Education Foundation to assist families with 
the cost of hot spots for distance learning, and 
an additional $10,000 grant to the school dis-
trict for its free meal program. A $5,000 grant 
was made to The Foster City Village to assist 
senior residents of the community. Catherine 
is a collaborative councilmember, and she has 
much to be proud of in these and other ac-
complishments during this tremendous time of 
challenge. 
Foster City is a wonderful place to live and 
to raise a family. As Catherine Mahanpour de-
parts her position of leadership, she leaves a 
legacy of progress. Despite the trials of our 
times due to the pandemic, the city is fiscally 
strong and prepared for its future. Catherine 
shares in the credit for meeting the test of a 
century. Public service is the shared sacrifice 
of a family. We wish her and her family many 
joyful years to come, and many warm memo-
ries of the time when Catherine was leading 
the community during times of optimism and 
times of trouble, but in any event always to-
ward a better tomorrow.
