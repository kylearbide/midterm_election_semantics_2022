f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Challenge us, mighty God, when we 
are too well pleased with ourselves, 
when our dreams come true because 
they are too small, when we arrive 
safely simply because we have sailed 
too close to the shore. 
Challenge us, mighty God, when, 
with the abundance of the things we 
possess, we lose our thirst for the 
waters of life and, having fallen in love 
with life, we cease to dream about eter-
nity. 
As we seek to honor the life and leg-
acy of former Senator Carl Levin, chal-
lenge us, mighty God, to dare more 
boldly, to venture on wider seas, where 
storms will show Your mastery, where, 
losing sight of land, we will find Your 
stars. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will please read a communication 
to the Senate from the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
The legislative clerk read the fol-
lowing letter: 
U.S. SENATE, 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE, 
Washington, DC, July 31, 2021. 
To the Senate: 
Under the provisions of rule I, paragraph 3, 
of the Standing Rules of the Senate, I hereby 
appoint the Honorable MARTIN HEINRICH, a 
Senator from the State of New Mexico, to 
perform the duties of the Chair. 
PATRICK J. LEAHY, 
President pro tempore. 
Mr. HEINRICH thereupon assumed 
the Chair as Acting President pro tem-
pore. 
f 
RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
leadership time is reserved. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
f 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, a substantial bipartisan major-
ity of Senators agreed to move forward 
with a debate on the bipartisan infra-
structure bill. 
Senators from the bipartisan group 
continue to finalize the text of the 
agreement. Once the bipartisan group 
completes the legislative text, I will 
offer it as a substitute amendment, 
making it the base of the bill on the 
floor. And then we can proceed to the 
consideration 
of 
additional 
amend-
ments. 
Look, I understand that writing the 
text of a bill of this size is a difficult 
project. I have been part of many such 
efforts in the past. But I urge the bi-
partisan group to finish their work so 
we can begin the amendment process 
here on the floor. 
I have said for weeks that the Senate 
is going to move forward on both 
tracks of infrastructure before the be-
ginning of the August recess. The 
longer it takes to finish, the longer we 
will be here. But we are going to get 
the job done. 
I will update the Senate on the tim-
ing of the next vote as we move for-
ward. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
SMITH). Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

July 31, 2021 
LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate proceed to legislative session for a 
period of morning business, and that 
upon the conclusion of my remarks, 
the Senate resume executive session, 
as under the previous order. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
EVICTION MORATORIUM 
Ms. WARREN. Madam President, al-
most exactly a year ago today, I stood 
here and called for Congress to take ac-
tion to protect renters before the expi-
ration of the eviction moratorium en-
acted during the early weeks of the 
pandemic. 
Today, like a year ago, we are only 
hours away from a fully preventable 
housing crisis. 
The CDC’s eviction moratorium ex-
pires tonight at midnight, putting mil-
lions of families still recovering from 
the economic fallout of COVID–19 at 
risk for losing their homes, from losing 
the bedrock of their safety and sta-
bility. 
Right now, more than 11 million 
renters report being behind on rent. 
That is one out of every seven renters. 
And people of color, who have been hit 
hardest by this pandemic, are dis-
proportionately at risk. Nearly one- 
quarter of Black renters report being 
behind on rental payments. 
Last year, Congress worked together 
to account for that staggering reality. 
We provided more than $45 billion in 
emergency 
rental 
assistance. 
That 
money is now finally getting into the 
hands of landlords around the country. 
It is helping families who lost jobs get 
caught up on the missed payments. 
But the money is getting out too 
slowly. Some States and local govern-
ments opened their assistance pro-
grams only last month. Some hadn’t 
spent a single dollar by the beginning 
of June. 
Now that is starting to change. In 
June, States delivered more than $1.5 
billion in emergency rental assistance. 
That money went to help nearly 300,000 
households, but there are still billions 
of dollars to distribute and millions of 
families in need. 
We have the tools, and we have the 
funding. What we need is the time. 
Look, I agree that the eviction mora-
torium is not a long-term solution, but 
let me be very clear: it is the right 
short-term action. It is how we keep 
families safely in their homes while 
States deliver emergency aid. It is how 
we keep families who are starting to 
recover from the worst economic crisis 
of their lifetimes get back on their 
feet. 
Millions of jobs have been lost, busi-
nesses are still shuttered, and childcare 
for too many families is still a patch-
work of uncertainty. The recovery un-
derway in this country is historic, and 
it will continue, but it has not yet 
reached every family. 
But the need is not just economic. 
We are still in the throes of a public 
health emergency that is trending in 
the wrong direction. Cases of COVID–19 
are rising. Hospitalizations and deaths 
are rising. The Delta variant is more 
contagious, threatening to spread fast-
er among the half of the country that 
remains unvaccinated. 
Needlessly evicting families would 
risk escalating our public health crisis. 
The CDC understood that reality when 
it issued an eviction moratorium in 
September. The Agency was clear, and 
I want to quote the language they 
used: ‘‘Housing stability helps protect 
health.’’ 
That’s right. Research shows that 
moratoriums aid in reducing infections 
and deaths due to COVID–19. And re-
search also shows that when eviction 
moratoriums expire, there is an associ-
ated increase in COVID–19 and mor-
tality. 
Yesterday, 
Congresswoman 
CORI 
BUSH sent Members of Congress a let-
ter. Congresswoman BUSH
has lived 
through 
eviction. 
She 
has 
been 
unhoused. And I want to quote her let-
ter. She said: 
I know firsthand the trauma and devasta-
tion that comes with the violence of being 
evicted, and we have a responsibility to do 
everything we can to prevent this trauma 
from being inflicted on our neighbors and 
communities. 
CORI BUSH is exactly right. 
My office has heard from so many 
people in Massachusetts who are terri-
fied about the possibility of losing 
their homes. I know that each of my 
colleagues here must be hearing these 
stories. In every State in this country 
there are families sitting around their 
kitchen table right now trying to fig-
ure out how to survive a devastating, 
disruptive, and unnecessary eviction. 
Congress has a choice to make. It is 
a privilege for us to represent people, 
and we have a duty to exercise our 
power on their behalf. Every Senator in 
this Chamber should be grateful that 
they have the power right now to keep 
families safe. 
My colleagues understood the stakes 
in March of 2020, when Congress passed 
the CARES Act eviction moratorium 
into law. They understood the stakes 
when we provided historic funding for 
emergency rental assistance. I urge 
them to join me now in continuing this 
lifesaving protection as States dis-
tribute assistance to keep renters 
housed; to keep landlords paid; and, 
most of all, to keep families safe. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ate will now resume executive session. 
Ms. WARREN. I suggest the absence 
of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. WARNER. First of all, Madam 
President, let me thank you and all of 
the floor staff and others who are here. 
I think on a beautiful Saturday at the 
end of July, we all wish, perhaps, we 
were somewhere else other than on the 
floor of the Senate. 
For the 30 years that I have been in-
volved in political discussions in Vir-
ginia and some on an international 
level, we have had President after 
President and Congress after Congress 
talk about the generational unmet 
needs in infrastructure. We have seen 
our roads and bridges start to crumble. 
The estimates are that close to, de-
pending on the survey, 14,000 bridges 
are in a decaying state, and in my 
State, over 700 bridges. We know the 
potholes in many of our roads and 
highways. We know our airports resem-
ble third world nations, not the United 
States of America. We know our ports 
have not kept up with modern tech-
nology. We know that many of our 
shorelines are dealing with the unprec-
edented effects of sea level rise. We 
know after COVID that high-speed 
internet connectivity is not a nice-to- 
have but essential. It is something the 
Presiding Officer has taken a legisla-
tive lead on. 
We know that it is time to get past 
talking about infrastructure and fi-
nally doing something. That is why I 
have been proud to be part of this bi-
partisan effort, working with the White 
House, to produce a historic piece of 
legislation, $550 billion of new spending 
over 5 years that in every category I 
just mentioned will make historic in-
vestments. 
I have been a little surprised, to tell 
you the truth, that some of our col-
leagues on the other side who were not 
part of the bipartisan group have sud-
denly said: No, we can’t do infrastruc-
ture now. They were all for it when 
President Trump was in; now they find 
excuses why not. 
I have to also say I have been a little 
bit surprised even with some of my col-
leagues on my side of the aisle, when 
the deal that we have structured is lit-
erally twice as much as where the ear-
lier negotiations were between Presi-
dent Biden and some of the Republican 
committee chairs—committee leaders. 
There has been some sense of, well, 
you 
know, 
infrastructure—that 
shouldn’t be that hard to do. If it 
wasn’t hard to do, why has it taken us 
30 years to get to this moment? 
I hope—and I know we are finalizing 
the last couple pieces of legislative lan-
guage—I hope that we will get that fin-
ished as soon as possible so we can get 
this bill on the floor, have amend-
ments, have a debate, but at the end of 
the day, pass this historic legislation

July 31, 2021 
and finally put our money where our 
mouths have been in terms of talking 
about the needs of infrastructure in 
this country. 
Now, I know, Madam President, that 
we do not have probably a lot of people 
rushing to the floor today, so I am 
going to take an extra minute or two. 
It doesn’t mean you have to stay riv-
eted to each moment. But I want to 
talk about this for a few moments in 
terms of what this will do for my 
State, for the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia. 
In the Commonwealth of Virginia, in-
vestment in infrastructure has been 
something that has eluded us for years. 
I have to acknowledge that when I was 
Governor, I tried to find funding, the 
funding needs, particularly in Northern 
Virginia, Hampton Roads, and put for-
ward bipartisan-supported tax referen-
dums in Northern Virginia, Hampton 
Roads. I was horribly unsuccessful at 
getting that done. 
A number of years later, a subse-
quent Governor, Governor McDonnell, 
managed to make a downpayment on 
some of the infrastructure needs in 
Virginia but not really address in a 
more comprehensive way the Common-
wealth’s needs. 
So I am going to take a couple of mo-
ments now and talk about, section by 
section, in Virginia, what this bipar-
tisan, White House-supported, record 
infrastructure investment will mean to 
the people of the Commonwealth of 
Virginia. 
Let me start with Hampton Roads. 
Hampton Roads, in a southeast Vir-
ginia peninsula, is most at risk from 
concerns about sea level rise and ques-
tions about resiliency, more than any 
other region in the whole country, with 
the exception of New Orleans. In Hamp-
ton Roads, local leaders, our Navy, 
nonprofits, and businesses have all 
come together and said: We need to 
make sure that we grapple with sea 
level rise. It is ranked, by most in 
those communities, as the No. 1 issue. 
Well, if we pass this legislation, $47 
billion will go into sea level rise pre-
vention and resiliency. That will mean 
that a whole host of projects in Nor-
folk, in Portsmouth, in Virginia Beach, 
and in Chesapeake will all be finally 
addressed. We have to make sure that 
Hampton Roads is not subject to this 
kind of devastating effect of sea level 
rise. 
We also know that Hampton Roads 
needs more rail. We have opened re-
cently some rail down to the peninsula, 
but not enough. We have to make sure 
that the rail that goes from Richmond 
doesn’t leave off, as a cul-de-sac, the 
peninsula in South Hampton Roads. 
With a $66 billion investment in rail, 
we may soon be able to see that be-
come a reality. 
Hampton Roads is home to the Port 
of Virginia. The Port of Virginia is one 
of the biggest ports on the whole east 
coast. But if we don’t continue to up-
grade that port, if we don’t continue to 
deepen the channel, if we don’t make 
the investments in the Craney Island 
expansion, and if we don’t stay com-
petitive, that port, which is the eco-
nomic engine driver not just of Hamp-
ton Roads but, in many ways, of most 
of the Commonwealth, will not stay 
competitive. This legislation will pro-
vide $17 billion, a record amount of in-
vestment, in our ports, and I can prom-
ise you the Port of Virginia will get a 
share of those resources. 
And, finally, on just the plain old 
issue of roads, Hampton Roads is dis-
connected from what we call the Penin-
sula in Virginia, and we have gotten 
two crosslinks, which oftentimes, dur-
ing the summer months, can lead to 
multiple-hour backups to our bridge- 
tunnels. If we make this $110 billion in-
vestment in roads and bridges, we can 
potentially see that third crossing 
come into reality. But what we could 
also make sure is that we could finally 
finish the widening of Interstate 64 be-
tween Norfolk and Richmond. 
I talked about this when I ran for 
Governor, and as Governor I said: 
Wouldn’t it be great if in our lifetime 
we could actually finish this project? 
Well, if we pass this bipartisan piece of 
legislation, the I–64 project widening 
from Norfolk to Richmond will be fin-
ished. This is incredibly important for 
the people of Hampton Roads, the East-
ern Shore peninsula, and the Northern 
Neck to make these investments. 
Let’s move up the road to our cap-
ital, Richmond, and the Richmond 
area. Last week, as I was looking at 
the Mayo Bridge—one of the historic 
bridges, over 100 years old—I saw how 
decaying it was. I saw the water dam-
age that was taking place. That bridge, 
without remediation, could be forced to 
close if we don’t make the needed in-
vestments. Well, this bipartisan legis-
lation will commit $110 billion for 
highway 
and 
bridge 
improvements. 
Mayo Bridge, and a host of the other 
700 bridges in Virginia that are decay-
ing, will get fixed. We need to make 
that happen. 
Richmond, as well, has got one of the 
most impressive bus transit systems 
not only in Virginia but in the whole 
country. We have made huge invest-
ments, close to $40 billion, in transit in 
this legislation, and some of the Rich-
mond bus transit needs will be ad-
dressed. 
We also know, in the Richmond area 
and across the Commonwealth, that we 
have a lot of airports. One of the things 
we need to continue to do is invest in 
our airports. The Richmond airport is 
always in need of additional expansion. 
There is $25 billion to improve our air-
ports across the country. The Rich-
mond airport, the Norfolk airport, the 
Newport News airport, and, obviously, 
the Roanoke airport and others—Dul-
les, National—will be improved, as well 
as a host of smaller regional airports 
across the Commonwealth, if we make 
this investment. 
We come up to our region here, where 
I live, in Northern Virginia. I am very 
proud of working with TIM KAINE and 
the Senators from Maryland. We made 
sure this legislation included a full 8- 
year reauthorization of our Metro sys-
tem. We made sure that we are making 
record investments in transit so that 
we can get Metro back up operating 
again on a full schedule and we can 
make the needed safety improvements 
that have been plaguing Metro for a 
number of years. 
We also know that we have to con-
tinue to build out additional Metro sta-
tions in Northern Virginia. The one at 
Potomac Yard will be extraordinarily 
important to the Innovation Center 
and the Amazon 2 headquarters. 
We have to make sure, as well, be-
cause Metro is moving to zero-emission 
buses—that is good news for our cli-
mate and for our community. The 
question is where are those zero-emis-
sion buses going to be built? This legis-
lation, as well, makes record invest-
ment in electric and other low-carbon 
and no-carbon buses, so they can be 
built here, not in China. 
Our record investment in transit will 
also make dramatic improvements to 
the VRE for the Manassas Line. Let’s 
get more people out of their cars and 
into VRE, whether it is the Manassas 
or Fredericksburg Line. Needed invest-
ments will be made if we pass this leg-
islation. 
Another project, if we are going to 
open up rail in Virginia, we have to 
make sure that we have another rail 
bridge across the Potomac. So for the 
Long Bridge Project, which I have been 
working with Governor Northam and 
Senator KAINE on, this kind of invest-
ment will make that happen. 
And as anybody who lives in North-
ern Virginia knows—where I live, and 
somebody who lives in Alexandria— 
traffic is the bane of our existence. 
There will be a host of improvements 
that will get done if we pass this legis-
lation. Let me talk about one in par-
ticular. 
Route 1, from Alexandria through 
Fairfax and into Prince William Coun-
ty, we know how clogged and congested 
it has been. We have been looking for 
additional funding, literally, for dec-
ades on Route 1. If we pass this legisla-
tion, it will get done. 
Let me move a little bit further west 
in our State, out toward the Shen-
andoah Valley and Roanoke and South-
west. For years, we have been talking 
about the danger on I–81. Literally, 
there have been prayer groups formed 
to pray for people who would travel on 
I–81 because there was so much truck 
traffic there that it has, frankly, im-
peded the safety of the traveling pub-
lic. We have been talking about mak-
ing improvements and expansions to 81 
capacity for 20 years. We have been 
talking about how do we get the trucks 
off of I–81, and how do we bring more 
rail down to Southwest and Southside. 
Well, if we pass this legislation, we will 
see those 81 corridor improvements 
that we have all been waiting for. We 
will see rail not only going from 
Lynchburg and Roanoke but extend on

down to Blacksburg and Christiansburg 
and, hopefully, all the way down to 
Bristol. This is terribly important to 
make sure that those communities 
have a multimodal form of transpor-
tation opportunities and making sure 
we get those trucks off of I–81, some-
thing we have been talking about for a 
long time. If we increase the rail ca-
pacity, both freight and passenger, we 
will be able to do that. 
We also know in Southside and 
Southwest, 
post-COVID, 
that 
high- 
speed internet connectivity is not a 
‘‘nice to have’’ but an absolute neces-
sity. A top priority of mine, as some-
body who has spent more years in the 
telecommunications industry than I 
have in politics, is to make sure that 
we make those connections. This legis-
lation—historic 
legislation—has 
$65 
billion for broadband. That investment, 
building on Governor Northam’s $700 
million investment from Virginia and 
American Rescue Plan funds, will 
make sure that every household across 
the Commonwealth has access to high- 
speed internet connectivity, not 5 
years from now or 10 years from now 
but in the next couple of years. 
And, finally, across Southwest Vir-
ginia—and for that matter, across all 
of Virginia—we still have families in 
far Southwest that don’t have access to 
clean drinking water on a regular 
basis, that still have to sometimes haul 
their water in the back of a pickup 
truck up to some cistern, and they 
don’t have access to clean drinking 
water in 2021. Well, $55 billion will go 
to water projects in this legislation. 
And whether they be access to clean 
drinking water on a regular basis or 
whether it be taking out the lead pipes 
that haunt too many of our urban com-
munities, or the storm and sewer sys-
tems that are, frankly, in some cases, 
60, 70, 80 years old and simply wearing 
out, we can make that investment as 
well. 
Now, there are a series of other areas 
in this legislation that are equally im-
portant, but at the end of the day, I 
can’t think of a bill that I have worked 
on that will have more direct effect on 
the lives of every Virginian over the 
next 5 years in terms of how you get to 
work, how you get to school, how you 
manage to take the kids out on the 
weekends, how our commerce moves, 
how we get our water, and how we get 
our internet than this record-setting 
$550 billion bipartisan investment in 
infrastructure. 
It is time for the Senate to take this 
bill up. I again commend all of my col-
leagues who have been working on this 
legislation, not just the so-called G–10 
but the G–22. I thank Leader SCHUMER 
for his good work, continuing to push 
this legislation forward. I want to 
thank the White House for its constant 
involvement. I even want to commend 
Leader MCCONNELL for voting with this 
bipartisan group to move this legisla-
tion along. We have talked about this 
for 30 years. We are literally days away 
from this passing the U.S. Senate. We 
have got to finish the job and get it 
done. 
With that, I hope I have kept you riv-
eted and now you are fully familiar 
with all the needs of Virginia. I am 
sure you can address similar needs in 
Minnesota. But I thank the Presiding 
Officer and all of the staffs who are 
here working on this Saturday, the last 
day in July, in the summer, to get this 
job done. 
With that, I note the absence—I don’t 
yield the floor. 
I would have been surprised if the 
Presiding Officer had asked me to 
speak for another 30 minutes, but I will 
choose not to do that because I have 
great respect for the floor staff. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate recess subject to the call of the 
chair.

Without objection, it is so ordered.

H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
just want to give a quick update. 
As everyone knows, we are waiting 
for the bipartisan group of Senators to 
finalize the text of their agreement. I 
have been informed the group is work-
ing hard to bring this negotiation to a 
conclusion, but they believe they need 
a little bit more time. I am prepared to 
give it to them because—because, as I 
have always said from the beginning, I 
am fully committed to passing a bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill, and so the 
Senate will remain in session today so 
that they can bring this to a conclu-
sion. 
Again, this is an important bill. I 
know all the parties want to get this 
right. As soon as their legislative text 
is finalized, we will review it, and then 
I will offer it as the substitute amend-
ment. After that, we can begin voting 
for amendments. 
f 
RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF 
THE CHAIR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate recess subject to the call of the 
Chair. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 5:18 p.m., recessed subject to the call 
of the Chair and reassembled at 9:51 
p.m. when called to order by the Pre-
siding Officer (Mr. BENNET). 
EXECUTIVE SESSION—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
H.R. 3684 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the bi-
partisan group of Senators has still not 
finalized the legislative text of their 
substitute amendment. The staffs are 
still working and say they will have 
the final legislative text ready tomor-
row. Therefore, the Senate will recon-
vene tomorrow at 12 noon. 
As I have said, when the legislative 
text is ready, I will offer it as the sub-
stitute amendment, and, after that, we 
can begin voting on amendments. 
As a reminder, upon completion of 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the 
Senate will turn to the budget resolu-
tion with reconciliation instructions. 
I want to thank the Capitol Police, 
the clerks, and the Senate staff for 
working these past 2 late nights.
