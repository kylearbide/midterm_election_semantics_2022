RECOGNIZING REVEREND CORDY 
TINDELL ‘‘C.T.’’ VIVIAN 
HON. JOHN LEWIS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to my good friend, Reverend Cordy 
Tindell ‘‘C.T.’’ Vivian. 
Born on July 30, 1924 in Howard County, 
Missouri as the only child to Robert Cordie 
and Euzetta Tindell Vivian, C.T. grew up in 
Macomb, Illinois, where he attended Lincoln 
Grade School and Edison Junior High School. 
Raised primarily by his doting mother and 
grandmother, Annie Woods Tindell, C.T. was 
often the only African-American in his class-
room. Make no mistake; it was not easy, but 
he managed to adapt, survive, and thrive. 
Throughout his childhood, his grandmother 
often instilled the values and teaching of Wil-
liams Wells Brown’s the Black Man: His Ante-
cedents, His Genius, and His Achievements. 
She believed that education would be his key 
to success and dedicated every resource and 
tool she had to inspire and encourage C.T. to 
stay the course with his studies. 
In 1942, their collective hard work and de-
termination paid off. C.T. graduated from 
Macomb High School and continued his stud-
ies at Western Illinois University. He moved to 
Peoria, Illinois, where he met Octavia Geans, 
his beloved wife of 58 years, who worked with 
him at the Carver Community Center. I was 
only seven years old when Reverend Vivian 
ignited his life-long flame for equality, equity, 
and freedom. While in Peoria, C.T. completed 
his first act of civil disobedience in 1947 when 
he participated in his first sit-in that success-
fully integrated Barton’s Cafeteria. With that 
social justice action, he committed all his en-
ergy and soul to the movement. 
A few years later, faith and fate brought him 
to Nashville, Tennessee, where Reverend Viv-
ian resumed his studies at the American Bap-
tist Theological Seminary and joined a group 
of other ministers in cofounding the Nashville 
Christian Leadership Conference, an affiliate 
of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s Southern Chris-
tian Leadership Conference (SCLC). As an 
undergraduate student at the American Baptist 
College, I first met C.T. as we learned about 
the doctrine of nonviolence, and the way of 
peace, the way of love, and the power of 
satyagraha—or truth force and nonviolent civil 
resistance from the esteemed visionary, Rev-
erend James Lawson. Older than many of the 
other students in the workshops, C.T. was like 
our big brother—graceful, thoughtful, and in-
spirational. In Nashville, we formed an un-
breakable, life-long bond as we committed our 
minds, bodies, and spirits to tearing down the 
barriers of hate, racism, and segregation 
across the United States and around the 
world. 
Throughout those pivotal years of the Civil 
Rights Movements, Reverend Vivian was on 
the front lines—at the lunch counters, on the 
Freedom Rides, in Parchman Prison, at the 
March on Washington, and in the fight for vot-
ing rights in Marion and Selma. If there was 
action, he was there. We, along with so many 
others, continue to bear the scars of those 
long days and endless nights, as we dedi-
cated our very lives to bringing about a non-
violent revolution as the means to redeem the 
soul of America. 
In his commitment to ‘‘develop future lead-
ers and promote brotherhood and academic 
excellence, while providing service and advo-
cacy for our communities,’’ C.T. embodies the 
mission of the Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity, Inc., 
of which he is a proud member. His fraternity 
brother, Dr. King, often remarked, and many 
agreed, that C.T. was the ‘‘greatest preacher 
to ever live.’’ Madam Speaker, if you ever had 
the honor and privilege to witness one of his 
sermons, you know that Dr. King was right. 
Time and time again, Reverend Vivian gave 
strength when exhaustion felt crushing, re-
stored hope when faith seemed expired, and 
created a path forward when every road ap-
peared to be blocked. 
As the National Director of Affiliates for the 
SCLC, Reverend Vivian played a pivotal role 
in the strategy to advance and eventually pass 
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. In the years since the 
height of the Civil Rights Movement, Reverend 
Vivian continues to serve and inspire people 
across the country and around the world. De-
spite the bruises and battles, C.T. maintains 
his commitment and dedication to nonviolence 
as the guiding principle of our mission. In con-
tinuing the tradition of his beloved grand-
mother, C.T.’s lessons were shared with his 
adored children: Jo Anna, Denise, Kira, Mark, 
Anita Charisse, Al, and his namesake, Cordy 
Tindell Vivian, Jr., who passed away in 2010. 
Reverend Vivian continues to preach and 
abide by the principle that ‘‘everything done to 
destroy us only becomes a means of devel-
oping us.’’ 
Across the country, Reverend Vivian self-
lessly shares his knowledge and experience 
with others. Lovingly calling all whom he 
meets, ‘‘Doc,’’ C.T. created an extended family 
united by shared principles wherever he goes. 
Over the decades, C.T. helped negotiate 
peace between gangs, confront systematic 
racism in organized labor, and counseled both 
Democratic and Republican Presidents on civil 
rights matters. He trained clergy leaders and 
community activists in Chicago as the director 
of the Urban Training Center for Christian Mis-
sions and imparted similar lessons during his 
tenure at the Seminary Without Walls at Shaw 
University Divinity School in Raleigh, N.C. 
Make no mistake, Madam Speaker; C.T. is 
tirelessly and always for the people. 
In the years after Nashville, we both man-
aged to make our way to Atlanta, Georgia, the 
heart of the Civil Rights Movement. In our 
adopted and adored hometown, Reverend Viv-
ian, with his late wife Octavia, 40 years ago 
founded BASIC Diversity, Inc. (BASIC) a full 
service, national consulting firm, established 
the C.T. Vivian Institute, Inc., and served as 
dean of the Urban Institute at the Interdenomi-
national Theological Center. In 2010, More-
house College honored Reverend Vivian with 
an honorary doctorate, and noting his life-long 
commitment to ‘‘justice and equality,’’ Presi-
dent Barack Obama awarded Reverend Vivian 
with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 
2013—one of the highest, civilian awards in 
our country. 
Madam Speaker, as you can see my heart 
is full of love and respect for this great man— 
my brother and fellow nonviolent soldier in the 
movement for justice, equality, and peace. I 
appreciate the honor and privilege of sharing 
a few of my more than 60 years of warm 
memories of and reflections on Reverend 
Cordy Tindell ‘‘C.T.’’ Vivian’s legacy and im-
pact on our nation, people around the world, 
and generations yet unborn.

HONORING HENRY ONG, JR. 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of Henry Ong, Jr., 
who passed away on July 2, 2020, at the age 
of 98. A native son of Arizona, Henry was a 
part of the Greatest Generation who fought to 
preserve our freedom and American way of 
life. As a nation, state, and community, we are 
forever indebted to Henry’s service and sac-
rifice. 
Henry was born to Henry Ong, Sr. and Mar 
Lai Hing Ong in Phoenix, Arizona. After he 
graduated from Phoenix Union High School, 
and despite the widespread anti-Chinese sen-
timent of the time, Henry and his three broth-
ers answered the call of duty and joined the 
U.S. Army. He became a bombardier, forming 
part of a B–24 crew that carried out 29 suc-
cessful bomber missions. On June 6, 1944, 
Henry participated in the D–Day invasion of 
the beaches of Normandy, helping deliver the 
victory that marked the beginning of the end of 
the war in Europe. 
In his final mission before coming home, the 
German Army shot down Henry’s plane deep 
in enemy territory. Alive but wounded, Henry 
was captured, interrogated, and taken as a 
prisoner of war by the Nazis, surviving nearly 
nine months of suffering and starvation. As Al-
lied troops advanced through Europe, the 
Nazis began liquidating the camps and Henry, 
along with thousands of prisoners, was forced 
to march over 1,000 miles during the brutal 
winter. Many perished. 
On May 4, 1945, Allied forces liberated 
Henry and four days later declared victory in 
Europe. Henry was the only Chinese Amer-
ican from the state of Arizona to have been 
captured as a prisoner of war. For his selfless 
sacrifice and wounds sustained in war, he was 
awarded the Purple Heart. 
After the war, Henry returned home to build 
a life in Arizona. He attended college and mar-
ried his bride Priscilla (Pat), and together they

raised four children: Pamela, Michael, Curtis 
(Buddy), and Kevin. Even though he hung up 
his uniform, Henry continued to serve his com-
munity. A man of deep faith, he was a Sunday 
School teacher and deacon at First Chinese 
Baptist Church in Phoenix. He became a suc-
cessful real estate and insurance broker and 
was known for his contagious energy, char-
ismatic spirit, and love and devotion to his wife 
and family. 
Although Henry had survived the depths of 
darkness, invisible wounds of the war re-
mained with him. After 40 years of silence, 
Henry began to speak about his encounters 
with the horrors of war and his imprisonment 
by the Nazis. He cared deeply for his fellow 
veterans and encouraged other POWs to 
share their own experiences and heal from 
their memories. He was a past commander 
and life member of the American Legion and 
the Disabled American Veterans, and he 
maintained a lifelong friendship with members 
of his crew. 
The American people must never forget 
Henry’s patriotism and bravery. A man of 
courage and conviction, our nation is better for 
his presence among us. Godspeed, Henry.

SUPPORTING THE GROTHMAN 
AMENDMENT TO H.R. 2 
HON. GLENN GROTHMAN 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I include 
in the RECORD the following letter in support of 
my amendment to H.R. 2. This letter is from 
a stakeholder in my district that owns and op-
erates the dam located in waters where 
invasive species, like Asian carp, have been 
found. 
JULY 9, 2020. 
Hon. GLENN GROTHMAN, 
Member of Congress, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. MARK POCAN, 
Member of Congress, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVES
GROTHMAN
AND 
POCAN: I am writing in strong support of 
your invasive species amendment to H.R. 2, 
the INVEST in America Act which passed 
the House by unanimous consent on July 1, 
2020. Alliant Energy deeply appreciates your 
commitment to this pro-environment meas-
ure and for protecting Wisconsin’s water-
sheds. 
As you know, an Alliant subsidiary, Wis-
consin Power and Light, owns and operates a 
dam located in Prairie du Sac, Wisconsin, on 
the Wisconsin River. The Prairie du Sac 
dam, now over 100 years old, is responsible 
for the formation of Lake Wisconsin, which 
serves as an enormous recreational and wild-
life resource for our state. 
Over a decade ago, the U.S. Fish and Wild-
life Service sought to impose a fishway re-
quirement on the license for the dam, essen-
tially calling for a ‘‘fishway’’ to be installed 
to allow for the upstream migration of na-
tive fish. Since that time, however, sci-
entists and state officials have discovered 
the existence of non-native, invasive fish 
species (Asian carp) at the base of the dam. 
If a fishway were now installed, it seems 
clear that these invasive species would also 
be able to migrate—and thereby endanger 
native fish populations upstream, including 
Lake Wisconsin. 
Your amendment would ensure that, in 
this particular case, the Fish and Wildlife 
Service would be required to consider the 
threats posed by invasive species before im-
posing a fishway condition on a hydro-
electric license. We believe strongly that 
such decisions should be predicated on the 
most up to date information available, and 
your amendment will help guarantee that 
invasive species are not permitted to threat-
en the Lake Wisconsin watershed. 
Again, thank you for offering your amend-
ment. Please let me know how Alliant En-
ergy may assist you in ushering this much- 
needed provision into public law. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID DE LEON, 
President—Wisconsin Power and Light 
Company, Alliant Energy.

GEORGE FUNERAL HOME 
CENTENNIAL 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on July 7th a centennial celebration 
was held in Aiken, South Carolina, for the 
George Funeral Home. The ceremonies were 
thoughtfully reported by Dede Biles in The 
Aiken Standard on July 8th.

100 YEARS OF SERVICE 
During the George Funeral Home and Cre-
mation Center’s Centennial Celebration on 
Tuesday in Aiken, three grandchildren of 
founder D.M. George were in attendance. 
Edward D. George Jr., Johanna Gibbs and 
Tommy Gibbs served as bridges between the 
past and the present. 
Edward lived upstairs at the funeral home 
with his parents, beginning at the age of 9, 
and he considered it his residence until he 
graduated from Clemson University in 1962. 
Edward’s 
cousin, 
Tommy, 
would 
play 
‘‘Taps’’ on the trumpet for military funerals. 
‘‘Uncle Albert (George) and daddy (Edward 
Sr.) would never let me go off to where 
Tommy was if he was to play ‘‘Taps’’ because 
they knew we would get in trouble,’’ Edward 
said. ‘‘I would get Tommy tickled so he 
couldn’t play.’’ 
Johanna, Tommy’s sister, recalled how 
many of the family members, in addition to 
her brother, were involved in helping out at 
the funeral home. 
Some drove cars and transported flowers to 
churches and then to cemeteries. 
They also pitched in to perform other 
tasks. 
‘‘There are not too many businesses in 
Aiken County—and maybe in this state— 
that have been run continuously for 100 
years,’’ Johanna said. ‘‘That is something to 
be proud of.’’ 
Cody Anderson is George Funeral Home’s 
current owner. He purchased the business in 
2018 from the Foundation Partners Group 
LLC of Orlando, Florida. 
‘‘We appreciate what Cody is doing so very 
much,’’ Edward said. ‘‘George Funeral Home 
has meant a lot to us over the years, and we 
are very appreciative that he has continued 
the compassionate service and the tradition 
of George Funeral Home, We also appreciate 
him keeping the George name on the funeral 
home.’’ 
Anderson considers himself the caretaker 
of the George family’s traditions even 
though he is not a relative. 
‘‘When I bought the funeral home, it 
wasn’t about me,’’ Anderson said, ‘‘It was 
about continuing the legacy that was estab-
lished in 1920. My goal has been to honor 
that tremendous legacy,’’ 
The Centennial Celebration included a pro-
gram that was held in George Funeral 
Home’s chapel instead of outdoors because of 
rain. 
It included talks by D.M. George’s descend-
ants about the history of the business, and 
there also were presentations of resolutions 
from the South Carolina House and Senate 
along with a proclamation from Aiken 
Mayor Rick Osbon’s office. 
U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R–S.C., spoke briefly, 
praising 
the 
‘‘thoughtful 
and 
compas-
sionate’’ Anderson and his staff for keeping 
George Funeral Home’s legacy of service 
alive. 
South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster was 
unable to attend the Centennial Celebration, 
but he sent a proclamation declaring that 
Tuesday was George Funeral Home 100th An-
niversary Day in the Palmetto State. 
Anderson discussed the funeral home’s fu-
ture near the end of the program, which was 
followed by a reception. He revealed a plan 
to renovate the chapel, a project that is ten-
tatively scheduled to begin in mid-2021. 
‘‘Robert Rich Associates, the architectural 
firm that redid Joye Cottage, another histor-
ical Aiken Winter Colony home, has been se-
lected to blend the chapel interior more 
architecturally to the original house to com-
plement it,’’ Anderson said. 
The program was followed by a reception. 
George Funeral Home is at 211 Park Ave. 
S.W. The former Winter Colony home that 
was known as ‘‘Deodara’’ has been the loca-
tion of the business since 1948.

Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to honor the First District of 
Oklahoma’s June Veteran of the Month, Ser-
geant William Parker. 
An infantryman in the United States Army, 
Sergeant William Parker honorably served our 
nation for two years. During this time, Ser-
geant Parker was stationed at Fort Sill and 
sent to basic training at Camp Walters. While 
at Camp Walters, Sergeant William Parker 
was trained in Infantry. His training included 
education on a variety of military machinery. 
Following Camp Walters, Sergeant William 
Parker was sent to England to train for the in-
famous D–Day invasion. Sergeant Parker was 
part of the first fleet to enter Omaha Beach on 
D–Day.

HONORING EMMA SANDERS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable 
leader, Emma Sanders. 
Known as one of the ‘‘unofficial’’ slate of 
Black Mississippians who sought to displace 
the nonrepresentative all-white delegation at 
the 1964 Democratic National Convention, 
Emma Sanders became active force in the 
civil rights movement in Mississippi. She was 
one of the people who helped organize local 
citizens and some of the 700 or so young peo-
ple from the North who flooded Mississippi to 
help Black citizens surmount Jim Crow-era 
barriers that had kept their voter registration at 
7 percent of those eligible. 
She graduated from Alcorn Agricultural and 
Mechanical College (now Alcorn State Univer-
sity) in Lorman, Miss., the nation’s first Black 
land grant college, and studied toward a mas-
ter’s degree in business at Indiana University 
in Bloomington. 
Mrs. Sanders taught in Jefferson County, 
Miss., and in Jackson, and later served as the 
executive director of Hinds County community 
action programs. While working as an assist-
ant to Representative Wayne Dowdy, a Mis-
sissippi Democrat, she played a role in the 
naming of the first federal building in the na-
tion for a Black person, the Dr. A.H. McCoy 
Federal Building in Jackson, which honored a 
local dentist, insurance executive, and civic 
leader. 
Mrs. Sanders would live to witness great 
progress on civil rights, but one breakthrough 
that she had hoped for—the removal of the 
Confederate battle emblem from Mississippi’s 
state flag—would not occur until four days 
after her death. 
Sanders, who was 91, died in her home on 
June 24, 2020. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing the late Emma Sanders for 
her dedication to the civil rights movement in 
the State of Mississippi.

HONORING BRAD HILTSCHER OF 
THE METROPOLITAN WATER DIS-
TRICT 
OF 
SOUTHERN 
CALI-
FORNIA ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. GRACE F. NAPOLITANO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Madam Speaker, we 
join together to honor the long career of public 
service provided to the people of Southern 
California by Brad Hiltscher of the Metropolitan 
Water District of Southern California. 
There is no issue that is more controversial 
for California Members of Congress than 
water policy. The very complicated details of 
California water policy have the ability to di-
vide us by party, by geography, and by indus-
try. 
One of the few things that California Mem-
bers do agree on is our deep gratitude for the 
invaluable expertise we have received from 
Mr. Hiltscher over the past 35 years. We are 
happy that he is moving on to a much de-
served retirement at the end of this month, but 
we will greatly miss the reservoir of knowledge 
that he has provided to our offices. 
Brad has provided policy advice that has 
been at the forefront of the water debates and 
legislation that the Congress has produced 
over the past 3 decades. He helped Congress 
enact Safe Drinking Water reauthorizations, 
the Colorado River Basin Salinity Control Act, 
the Moab Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Ac-
tion Project, the California Bay-Delta Restora-
tion Act, the Hoover Dam Reauthorization Act, 
the Colorado River Drought Contingency Plan 
Authorization Act, and many more pieces of 
important water legislation in the West. Brad’s 
talent is that he is able to break down these 
very complex issues involving historic water 
rights, urban water usage, endangered spe-
cies, infrastructure, interstate agreements, fed-
eral programs, and the hundreds of water 
agencies in the West quickly and concisely. 
He has provided invaluable insight to Mem-
bers of Congress and has always done so by 
advocating for the best interests of Southern 
California. 
Brad is trusted by both sides of the aisle for 
being fair and honest, which has been dem-
onstrated by the way he conducts bipartisan 
briefings and gives both sides the same policy 
message without politics. 
Mr. Hiltscher has been an invaluable re-
source to us, our staff, and those of numerous 
other Members with his expert analysis and 
advice that has informed our legislative work. 
But we will not only miss his knowledge, we 
will miss his kindness and friendship on Cap-
itol Hill. 
I ask our colleagues to join me, Rep. CAL-
VERT, and Sen. FEINSTEIN in congratulating 
Brad Hiltscher on his retirement, and thanking 
him for his long career of public service to the 
people of Southern California.

TRIBUTE TO HONOR THE LIFE OF 
WILLIAM C. DEMENT, M.D., PH.D. 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of Dr. William C. Dement, a 
distinguished Stanford scientist and professor 
who died on June 17, 2020, at the age of 91. 
Known as ‘‘The Father of Sleep Medicine’’, 
Dr. Dement made unparalleled contributions to 
the field of sleep medicine. Dr. Dement’s con-
tributions to sleep research include the asso-
ciation of REM sleep with dreaming; the 
neuropharmacology of sleep; the quantification 
and 
causes 
of 
daytime 
sleepiness; 
the 
pathophysiology and genetics of narcolepsy; 
the assessment of jet lag and other circadian 
disorders; the behavioral and cardiovascular 
impact of sleep apnea; and pharmacotherapy 
for insomnia. 
Dr. Dement was an ardent supporter of in-
surance coverage for sleep analysis and treat-
ment, and advocated widely and effectively 
about the dangers of sleep deprivation and 
need for sufficient sleep for students, drivers 
and others, and he had a deep impact on the 
lives of the Stanford University students who 
enrolled in his iconic Sleep and Dreams 
course. 
Dr. Dement founded the Stanford Sleep Dis-
orders Clinic and helped to establish the pro-
fessional society that is now the American 
Academy of Sleep Medicine, and additional 
professional organizations such as the Sleep 
Research Society. He was often seen on Cap-
itol Hill in his role as Chairman of the National 
Commission on Sleep Disorders Research. 
The cornerstone recommendation of the Na-
tional Commission was the establishment of 
the National Center on Sleep Disorders Re-
search, and in 1993, during the reauthorization 
bill for the National Institutes of Health, Con-
gress followed through with the statutory es-
tablishment of the National Center on Sleep 
Disorders Research at NIH’s National Heart, 
Lung, and Blood Institute. 
Madam Speaker, I consider myself fortunate 
to be among those who knew Dr. Dement and 
benefited from his wise counsel and his warm 
friendship. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the life and contributions of Dr. 
William C. Dement and in extending our sin-
cere condolences to his two daughters, Eliza-
beth and Catherine, his son Nick, his son-in- 
law Gary, and six grandchildren. Dr. Dement 
bettered our community and strengthened our 
country by a life lived well and with high pur-
pose for so many.

BLACK 
EXPO’S 50TH SUMMER CELEBRA-
TION ANNIVERSARY 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in celebration of Indiana Black 
Expo’s 50th Summer Celebration Anniversary. 
Since 1970, Indiana Black Expo has served 
as a catalyst for social and economic ad-
vancement for African American Hoosiers. 
Founded by a volunteer group of civic leaders 
with a view to expand opportunities for small, 
minority businesses, the organization has 
evolved into a robust entity with a statewide 
infrastructure of 12-chapter affiliates. The 
Summer Celebration, held in the heart of the 
7th Congressional District in Indianapolis, is a 
festival that embraces the change and growth 
of our community. Through a variety of work-
shops, concerts and exhibitions, the series of 
events provides resources, information and 
entertainment celebrating Black culture. In 
these trying times—during a global health cri-
sis and institutionalized violence disproportion-
ately impacting Black lives—Indiana Black 
Expo’s vision of cultural diversity and inclu-
siveness is increasingly important. The grow-
ing need to shine a light on our community’s 
success and voice is evident, and organiza-
tions like Indiana Black Expo continue to cre-
ate a platform for this work.

MITCH MCCUMBER RETIRES 
AFTER 22 YEARS OF SERVICE 
HON. BILLY LONG 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. LONG. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
pay tribute to a great man and citizen of 
Southwest Missouri, Mr. Mitch McCumber, as 
he celebrates his upcoming retirement. For the 
last 22 years, Mitch has served as the CEO 
and General Manager of New-Mac Electric 
Cooperative and will have the longest tenure 
of any CEO or General Manager in the co- 
op’s history. 
New-Mac Electric Cooperative was incor-
porated in 1939 and serves nearly 18,000 
member 
accounts 
primarily 
in 
Newton, 
McDonald, and Jasper counties. Under Mitch’s 
leadership, New-Mac has enjoyed steady 
growth, and many of his colleagues contend 
that it would not be where it is today without 
Mitch’s strong leadership. 
Mitch is a certified public accountant and 
worked for a number of CPA firms before he 
joined the New-Mac team. He began his ca-
reer with the co-op in January of 1995, rising 
to the general manager position in 1998. 
McCumber is also an active member of his 
community where he lives with his wife, 
Becky, and has served on numerous boards 
and 
civic 
organizations 
including 
KAMO 
Power, Association of Missouri Electric Co-
operatives, Missouri Southern State University, 
Freeman Health Systems, Freeman Neosho 
Hospital, Community Bank and Trust, Con-
sumer Electric Power Association, and Neo-
sho Chamber of Commerce. He has served as 
the chairman for many of the aforementioned 
boards, and he is a member of both the Amer-
ican Institute of Certified Public Accounts and 
the Missouri Society of Certified Public Ac-
counts. 
I wish Mitch the very best as he embarks on 
this new chapter of life and I am grateful for 
his service to his community.

TRIBUTE TO 1ST LIEUTENANT 
DAVID JOHN SCHMITZ 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to a hero and true American pa-
triot, United States Air Force First Lieutenant 
David John Schmitz. Today we ask that the 
House of Representatives honor and remem-
ber this incredible young man who died in 
service to our country. 
1st Lt. Schmitz was born in Santa Barbara, 
California on February 17, 1988 to Brian and 
Sherrie Schmitz. At the age of only 17, 1st Lt. 
Schmitz earned his private pilot’s license 
marking the start to his career in aviation. He 
attended San Diego State University where he 
enrolled in the University’s Air Force ROTC 
program in hopes of becoming an Air Force 
pilot. His success in the program was evident 
and before completing his degree he enlisted 
in the United States Air Force. 
His first duty station was as a loadmaster 
and instructor on a C–17 cargo plane where 
he participated in critical missions, such as de-
livering supplies to troops on the ground in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq. It was during his time as 
a loadmaster that he met the love of his life 
and his future wife, Valerie Rudolph. With Val-
erie living in New Mexico and David stationed 
in Tacoma, Washington, the two began their 
relationship, which they navigated through 
long-distance and two deployments. They 
were married in 2013. 
1st Lt. Schmitz completed his under-
graduate degree through Embry-Riddle Aero-
nautical University, keeping up his studies 
even while deployed. Once he completed his 
degree, 1st Lt. Schmitz earned a slot as a 
fighter pilot and was commissioned through 
Officer Training School. He completed his un-
dergraduate pilot training with high honors and 
earned numerous accolades. 
His great success led him to be selected to 
fly F–16 aircraft at Shaw Air Force Base in 
Sumter, South Carolina. On June 30, 2020, 
1st Lt. Schmitz was tragically killed when his 
F–16 crashed during a training mission. He is 
survived by his wife Valerie, their dog Toby, 
his parents Brian and Sherrie Schmitz, sister 
Laura Schmitz (Issac Stewart), and his grand-
mother Louise Schmitz, along with numerous 
relatives and friends. 
As we look at the incredibly rich military his-
tory of our country we realize that this history 
is comprised of men and women, just like 1st 
Lt. Schmitz, who bravely fought for the ideals 
of freedom and democracy. Each story is 
unique and humbling for those of us who, far 
from the dangers they have faced, live our 
lives in relative comfort and ease. The day the 
Schmitz family learned of their husband, son, 
and brother’s death was probably the hardest 
day they have ever faced, and our thoughts, 
prayers and deepest condolences go out to 
them. His sacrifice is forever etched in our na-
tion’s great history of freedom triumphing over 
oppression. 1st Lt. Schmitz’s family has given 
a part of themselves in the loss of their loved 
one and we hope they know that the good-
ness he brought to this world and the sacrifice 
he has made will never be forgotten.

HONORING RICHARD BURGESON 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, Richard Dennis Burgeson of Bonita 
Springs, Florida passed away peacefully on 
Sunday, May 31, 2020, at the age of 74. 
Born on January 18, 1946, in Oak Park, Illi-
nois, Rich was the youngest of three sons to 
Gunnar and Alice Burgeson. Rich attended 
college at Bradley University in Illinois with his 
high school sweetheart, Maria Vorgias. Upon 
graduation from Bradley, Rich went on to 
teach 5th Grade in Oak Park. He married 
Maria on July 20, 1968 and they settled into 
their home in Hinsdale, Illinois. After teaching 
for several years, Rich went to work at the 
Burgeson family business, Albin Carlson Com-
pany, a successful road construction company 
based in Illinois. Rich worked as the Chief Fi-
nancial Officer at Albin Carlson until the family 
sold the business in 2005 and Rich retired. He 
and Maria moved to the Copperleaf Commu-
nity in Bonita Springs, Florida soon there after 
where Rich was able to focus on his golf 
game and pursue his life long passion of boat-
ing. He was an active member of the 
Copperleaf Community and served on various 
committees within Copperleaf. Rich was a lov-
ing husband, father, father-in-law, and friend, 
but most importantly a loving grandfather. 
Nothing made his eyes light up more than 
when he was able to spend time with his four 
grandchildren. 
Rich is survived by his wife, Maria Burgeson 
of Bonita Springs, Florida; son Eric Burgeson, 
daughter-in-law Christine Burgeson, grand-
daughters

IN CELEBRATION OF THE ROSIE 
THE RIVETER ROSE GARDEN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the dedication of the Rosie 
the Riveter Rose Garden at the McFadden 
Ross House in Dearborn, Michigan. 
Rosie the Riveter is one of the most iconic 
images of female ingenuity, perseverance, and 
strength. As widespread male enlistment left 
gaping holes in the industrial labor force dur-
ing World War II, the Rosie the Riveter cam-
paign was launched to recruit female workers 
to join the wartime labor force and fill the gaps 
in male-dominated industries. The bandana- 
clad Rosie flashing her bicep quickly became 
one of the most successful recruiting tools in 
American history. Inspiring a ‘‘We Can Do It!’’ 
attitude among women across the country, the 
campaign prompted an estimated five million 
civilian women to enter the defense industry 
and 
commercial 
sector. 
Known 
as 
the 
‘‘Rosies,’’ the powerful women produced air-
planes, ammunitions, and warships on a mas-
sive scale. They worked as riveters, sanders, 
welders, assembly line workers, Red Cross 
volunteers, and so much more. 
The dedication of the Rosie the Riveter 
Rose Garden exemplifies our community’s 
continued admiration for the Rosies and how 
important they are to Michigan’s story. As part

of the Arsenal of Democracy, Southeastern 
Michigan became one of the greatest sup-
pliers of airplanes, tanks, trucks, and weapons 
for the American war effort. The automotive in-
dustry quickly adapted to produce wartime 
supplies on an automotive-style assembly line, 
and the opening of the famous Willow Run 
Bomber Plant led to the impressive completion 
of one bomber per hour. Rosies working in 
factories throughout Michigan became the em-
blem for wartime production, and their hard 
work and efforts were crucial to America and 
its allies in winning the global conflict. 
The call for women to join the workforce 
during World War II was meant to be tem-
porary. Yet, the Rosies’ efforts shattered the 
glass ceiling for women in the labor force, and 
clearly demonstrated that women were capa-
ble, smart, and strong workers who could hold 
their own. Their impact revolutionized the 
workplace, and their example paved a path for 
generations of women to follow. They have 
become the ultimate symbol of female em-
powerment, and their legacy is one that will 
never be forgotten. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in celebrating the dedication of the Rosie 
the Riveter Rose Garden. I am grateful for our 
community’s commitment to honoring these 
amazing women and their contribution to 
progress. The beautiful, strong, and resilient 
roses will remind all of the remarkable Rosies 
who made victory possible and changed 
America forever.

CONGRATULATING SANJAY REDDY 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud my out-
standing 
constituent 
and 
staffer, 
Sanjay 
Reddy, as he makes his departure from my 
Washington, D.C. office to attend Georgetown 
University Law Center. 
Sanjay joined my staff upon my being sworn 
into Congress, and he quickly helped to de-
velop and establish our office. He built our 
constituent correspondence program from the 
ground up as my Legislative Correspondent, 
and he met regularly with constituents regard-
ing health care and developing medical tech-
nologies as my Legislative Aid. In every 
project he took on, Sanjay demonstrated the 
utmost thoughtfulness and professionalism. He 
was an exemplary Hill staffer, and I have no 
doubt that he will exhibit the same character 
and commitment in all his future accomplish-
ments. 
Madam Speaker, I extend my deepest grati-
tude to Sanjay Reddy for his dedication to our 
team, and to the constituents of Michigan’s 
11th District. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
wishing Sanjay much success in his upcoming 
studies and future law career. 
IN MEMORY OF BRADLEY H. 
PATTERSON, JR. 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
give my respects to Brad Patterson, who re-
cently passed away after many decades of 
dedicated service to our country. 
Graduating with a master’s degree in 1943 
from the University of Chicago, Brad served in 
the State Department and then as Deputy 
Counselor to the Cabinet under President 
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Brad was also the first 
Executive Director of the Peace Corps under 
President John F. Kennedy. 
After a stint with the Treasury Department, 
the National War College and the National Ad-
visory Council on the Selective Service, Brad 
returned to the White House, this time serving 
as Executive Assistant to Leonard Garment 
under President Richard M. Nixon. 
Most Americans would be proud to have 
had such a distinguished career and bountiful 
life. 
As an enrolled member of the Chickasaw 
Nation of Oklahoma, I hold Brad in especially 
high regard for his role in advising President 
Nixon and helping to shape the federal policy 
of Indian self-determination. On July 8, 2020, 
we celebrate the 50th anniversary of President 
Nixon’s Special Message to Congress on In-
dian Affairs and not coincidentally, the most 
important and successful federal policy regard-
ing Native people the United States has ever 
had. It is also the 50th anniversary of the res-
toration of its sacred Blue Lake to the Taos 
Pueblo, which was the symbolic centerpiece of 
the Nixon message. 
As Special Assistant to the President for 
Domestic Affairs, Brad and his colleagues— 
Leonard 
Garment, 
Bobbie 
Kilberg, 
Lee 
Huebner, and others—worked with Nixon’s 
chief 
domestic 
policy 
adviser, 
John 
Ehrlichman, to develop and propose to the 
President what was then a radical new shift in 
federal Indian policy. 
America was in flux in the late 1960s with 
an unpopular ground war in southeast Asia, a 
growing civil rights movement, and a nascent 
ecological awareness beginning. 
In 1970, this new policy that Brad played a 
key role in shaping looked back at the devas-
tation earlier policies had caused to tribal com-
munities and sought a new paradigm based 
on strong tribal governments and vibrant tribal 
economies. 
Brad also worked to restore fishing rights to 
the Yakima Nation, helped pass the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act, and was instru-
mental in resolving the American Indian Move-
ment’s occupation of the Bureau of Indian Af-
fairs’ office in Washington, D.C. 
For five decades, Nixon’s policy has contin-
ued to help Indian tribes make enormous 
strides in terms of governance and economic 
growth. As we approach the 50th anniversary 
of that policy, let us look at Brad Patterson’s 
life and work to inspire us as we make our 
way through these dark and troubled times. 
TRIBUTE 
IN 
HONOR 
OF 
CLARA 
HAZZARD 
BY 
HER 
DAUGHTER 
THE 
HONORABLE 
LADORIS 
HAZZARD CORDELL 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to memorialize the poignant words spoken by 
my constituent, the Honorable LaDoris Cordell, 
in praise of her beloved mother, on the occa-
sion of her mother’s passing. 
A tribute to Clara Hazzard from her middle 
and tallest daughter. 
We don’t get to choose our parents. If we 
are lucky, we get parents who are adequate. 
If we are blessed, we get parents who are ex-
ceptional. My sisters and I were truly 
blessed. Our parents were extraordinary. 
While my words are dedicated to our mother, 
always know that she and my father were a 
team who together led remarkable lives. 
There are two types of people in the world: 
bystanders and upstanders. Bystanders are 
those who stand by on the sidelines and when 
injustice raises its ugly head, they stand by, 
throw up their hands, sigh, complain, and do 
nothing, hoping for someone to come along 
to make things better. The upstander, on the 
other hand, stands up, sits up, speaks up, 
sings up, and lawyers up for justice. Clara 
Hazzard was an upstander all of her life. Here 
are just a few examples. She stood up to rac-
ism when the white teachers and administra-
tors at the Ardmore Avenue Elementary 
School placed disproportionate numbers of 
Black students into special education class-
es. As one of the leaders of the local NAACP, 
our mother organized the picket lines that 
showed up every day at the school to protest. 
That was in the day when there were no com-
puters, or Internet, or cell phones. Every 
night, I recall her getting on the phone to 
line up people to volunteer to be on the pick-
et lines. In the 1960s, she protested when a 
local department store had only white dolls 
on its shelves. She followed up with a letter 
to the management demanding that dolls of 
color be sold at their stores. She prevailed, 
of course, and black dolls soon filled the 
shelves. She opened up our home when there 
were people in need of a place to stay. Some 
of those people who benefited from her kind-
ness and generosity are here in this church 
today. When Roxana auditioned for the Hav-
erford High School cheerleading squad and 
made it, the schools’ white administrators 
threw up a big roadblock by telling her that 
they had run out of the pleated skirts cheer-
leaders were required to wear, so she 
couldn’t participate. When she told our 
mother, her response was to work through 
the night making a pleated skirt. Clara 
Hazzard stayed up, and sold up, to get justice 
for her child. 
Some of you may remember that there was 
an A&P market where Mate’s is now situ-
ated. One day, when my mother and I were in 
the market’s parking lot and I was pushing 
the grocery cart next to her—I was maybe 
seven years old at the time—the cart acci-
dentally bumped the side of a parked car, 
causing no damage. The white man who was 
sitting in the car got out and yelled at me, 
using the N-word several times. Well, Mrs. 
Hazzard spoke up and laid that man out, 
whereupon he shut up and quickly got back 
in his car. Clara Hazzard would not hesitate 
to lay you out if you didn’t behave. 
Spring Cleaners, the business that our par-
ents ran for more than forty years that sup-
ported our family, was also a place where

Ardmore’s Black community would fre-
quently gather to address political issues. 
Our mother was a terrific organizer and 
strategist whose sage advice provided guid-
ance to our community. And then there were 
the good times at 814 Aubrey Avenue. On 
Saturday mornings, our mother and her 
three daughters cleaned up. Every Saturday 
we’d clean the house from top to bottom be-
fore we could maybe go to the Ardmore mov-
ies or play at the laundry field on Aubrey 
Avenue. Dirt was not her friend. And, she 
could step up, and by that I mean that she’d 
make these surprise visits to the third floor 
where Denise and I each had bedrooms. 
These visits were like pop quizzes. She’d give 
a warning by yelling ‘‘I’m coming up to see 
if your rooms are clean!’’ And of course, they 
weren’t. Then we’d hear her steps on the 
stairs, loud and firm. I don’t know about 
you, Denise, but my room was a mess. So, I 
just pulled the covers over my head and 
waited for the inevitable. She’d pull out each 
of the drawers in my dresser, see a mess of 
clothing, then dump the contents of each 
drawer on my bed and say ‘‘I’ll be back.’’ 
Well, you all will be pleased to know that 
today my clothing is so neat and organized 
that even my socks are neatly folded and 
stored by color. 
Our mother loved to see things grow up, es-
pecially when it came to flowers. She’d spend 
hours in the summer planting red and white 
flowers all over her back yard, front yard, 
and porch. One summer, I decided to count 
the flowers and to name each one, writing 
the name on Popsicle sticks that I stuck in 
the dirt next to each set of flowers. I ran out 
of names. The woman had planted over 120 
sets of flowers. I named each set after a fam-
ily member, followed by just about every 
Black person in Ardmore. 
Clara Hazzard could cook up a storm. Her 
corn pudding, rolls, apple pies, chicken and 
dumplings, collard greens, were the best. 
Sunday dinners were ridiculously delicious. 
One final example. Our mother clerked up. 
For twenty years, she was the church clerk 
at Mount Calvary. She organized the office 
and took care of all of the church’s financial 
and business matters. The high point of 
church services for me was watching and lis-
tening to her read the notices and announce-
ments. She always looked good and had a 
lovely speaking voice with every word clear-
ly enunciated. 
I could go on with many more examples, 
but let me close with this. Getting on with 
the business of living after our mother’s 
death is what we must all do. It is what she 
surely expected us to do. So as we move on, 
the greatest tribute that you can pay to her 
is to continue her legacy of being an 
upstander. Every one of us should follow her 
example by standing up and speaking up for 
what is right and just. Finally, of all of the 
wonderful descriptions of our mother, the 
one that is most meaningful to me was her 
kindness. Let her legacy of kindness be 
yours. I believe that that would please her 
the most. 
Madam Speaker, I ask the entire House of 
Representatives to join me in offering our con-
dolences to the entire family of Clara Hazzard. 
It is an honor to represent her magnificent 
upstander daughter, the Honorable LaDoris 
Cordell, who continues her mother’s legacy to 
bring justice and kindness to all. 
MONSIGNOR MICHAEL DOYLE 
HON. DONALD NORCROSS 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 13, 2020 
Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and commend Camden, New 
Jersey resident Monsignor Michael Doyle on 
their retirement from Sacred Heart Parish. 
Monsignor Michael Doyle came to the 
United States in 1959 and shortly after being 
ordained as a priest, he choose the Catholic 
Diocese of Camden for his priestly vocation in 
the late 1950’s and started serving the City of 
Camden in 1967. Monsignor Doyle has dedi-
cated his life to the pursuit of helping others 
whether they are in his parish or not, and he 
embodies the principals of transformational 
love. 
Monsignor Michael Doyle is a celebrated 
poet, pacifist, and provocateur. In 1971, he 
was a member of the Camden 28, a group of 
anti-Vietnam War activists who plotted to raid 
the Camden draft board office until the plan 
was revealed to the authorities. Doyle and 
three other Catholic priests were eventually 
acquitted of their charges. In addition, Doyle 
helped plant crosses memorializing Camden 
City’s murder victims in front of Camden City 
Hall when he felt more could be done to stem 
rampant violence. Monsignor Michael Doyle is 
also a champion of education, improved med-
ical care, community beautification, and ex-
panding affordable housing options. 
Doyle solidified his reputation as an advo-
cate for the City of Camden when he estab-
lished the housing nonprofit, Heart of Camden 
in 1984. The charity focuses on restoring dig-
nity and improving the quality of life through 
programs of housing restoration, economic ex-
pansion, and human development. For almost 
40 years Heart of Camden has transformed 
the Waterfront South neighborhood of Cam-
den by building affordable housing, cleaning 
and greening the neighborhood, building new 
play spaces, adding community gardens, and 
created a vibrant art and cultural district. 
Through putting his heart and soul into trans-
forming the Waterfront South District he has 
made the neighborhood a beautiful up and 
coming community for first time homeowners. 
The retirement of the celebrated Monsignor 
Michael Doyle from Sacred Heart Parish in 
Camden, New Jersey after more than forty 
years of serving the parish community is well 
deserved. He has made no plans to cease his 
altruism, as he will continue his fundraising ef-
forts for the pre-K to 8 school in the city. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me in 
honoring Monsignor Michael Doyle, of Cam-
den, New Jersey, a dedicated and selfless re-
ligious leader in the City of Camden, New Jer-
sey.
