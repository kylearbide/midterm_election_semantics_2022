ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE 2022 CON-
GRESS-BUNDESTAG/BUNDESRAT 
EXCHANGE 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, since 1983, 
the U.S. Congress House and Senate and the 
German Bundestag and Bundesrat have con-
ducted an annual exchange program for staff 
members from both countries. The program 
gives professional staff the opportunity to ob-
serve and learn about each other’s political in-
stitutions and engage in discussion regarding 
mutual interest. 
A staff delegation from the U.S. Congress 
will be selected to visit Germany from Friday, 
May 27–Sunday, June 5, 2022. During this ex-
change, the delegation will attend meetings 
with Bundestag/Bundesrat party staff mem-
bers, and representatives of numerous polit-
ical, business, academic and media agencies. 
A comparable delegation of German staff 
members will visit the United States from Sat-
urday, July 9–Monday, July 18, 2022. They 
will attend similar meetings in Washington or-
ganized by the members of the U.S. delega-
tion. 
The 
Congress-Bundestag/Bundesrat 
Ex-
change is highly regarded in Germany and the 
United States and is one of several exchange 
programs sponsored by public and private in-
stitutions in the United States and Germany to 
foster better understanding of the politics and 
policies of both countries. This exchange is 
funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bu-
reau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. 
The U.S. delegation shall consist of experi-
enced and accomplished Hill staff who can 
contribute to the success of the exchange on 
both sides of the Atlantic. The Bundestag re-
ciprocates by sending senior staff profes-
sionals to the United States. 
Applicants should have a demonstrable in-
terest in events in Europe. Applicants need 
not be working in the field of foreign affairs, al-
though such a background can be helpful. The 
composite U.S. delegation should exhibit a 
range of expertise in issues of mutual concern 
to the United States and Germany such as, 
but not limited to, trade, security, the environ-
ment, economic development, health care, 
and other social policy issues. This year’s del-
egation should be familiar with transatlantic re-
lations within the context of recent world 
events. 
Please note that there is a significant time 
commitment aspect for those selected for the 
program. In addition, U.S. participants are ex-
pected to plan and implement the meetings 
and programs for the Bundestag/Bundesrat 
staff members when they visit the United 
States. 
Members of the House and Senate who 
would like a member of their staff to apply for 
participation in this year’s program should di-
rect them to submit a resume and cover letter 
in which they state their qualifications, the 
contributions they can make to a successful 
program and some assurances of their ability 
to participate during the time stated. 
Due to the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic, 
all staff selected for the exchange program 
must be fully vaccinated in order to travel. 
Proof of vaccination must be submitted with 
the application. 
Applications should be sent to the Office of 
Interparliamentary Affairs, HC–4, the Capitol, 
by 5 p.m. on Wednesday, March 2, 2022. 
Questions may be directed to Ms. Kate 
Knudson at 202–226–1766 or Ms. Claudia 
Marconi at 202–226–3441.

HONORING OUTGOING DEARBORN 
CITY COUNCIL MEMBER DAVID 
BAZZY 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. David Bazzy on the oc-
casion of his retirement from the City Council 
of Dearborn, Michigan, where he has honor-
ably served for over ten years. His significant 
contributions to our community are worthy of 
commendation. 
Mr. Bazzy is a lifelong Dearborn resident 
and graduated from Edsel Ford High School. 
He holds a-bachelors degree from the Univer-
sity of Michigan and a MBA from Wayne State 
University. He has served as chairman of the 
Dearborn Charter Commission and served on 
the Recreation Commission and the Zoning 
Board of Appeals. An active member of the 
community, he belongs to many organizations 
and sits on the board of the Dearborn Good-
fellows. Mr. Bazzy is President and COO of 
Kenwal Steel, Kenwal Pickling, and Delaco- 
Kenwal—all based in Dearborn. 
Mr. Bazzy was first elected to the Dearborn 
City Council in 2010. His time on the council 
was focused on ensuring that Dearborn re-
mains a great place to live and work for years 
to come. Mr. Bazzy concentrated on attracting 
new small businesses and providing support 
for current Dearborn mainstays, making the 
economic renewal of the city a top priority. 
With years of civic involvement under his belt, 
he has been a strong voice on behalf of his 
neighbors and a decisive advocate for public 
safety. Mr. Bazzy resides in Dearborn with his 
wife of over thirty-three years, Cherie, and to-
gether they have three sons. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring David Bazzy. We are grateful 
for his time spent serving the citizens of Dear-
born as a member of the City Council. I join 
with his family, friends, and colleagues in ex-
tending my best wishes to him in the future. 
THE TRANSITION-TO-SUCCESS 
MENTORING ACT 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, as we mark 
National Mentoring Month, I am proud to re-
introduce legislation to the Transition-To-Suc-
cess Mentoring Act to help local education 
agencies prepare at-risk students for the tran-
sition from middle school to high school. 
I have had many mentors at every stage of 
my life, whether it was my theatre teacher in 
school who encouraged me to be who I am 
and elevated the confidence in myself to pur-
sue sports, or my grandmother who raised 
me, and who was the reason I find myself fol-
lowing her large footsteps in public service. 
Mentors are important at every stage in life 
and especially at a young age. We should 
help children foster these mentor/mentee rela-
tionships to look up to someone bigger than 
themselves. 
The Transition-To-Success Mentoring Act 
would establish a grant program for school- 
based mentoring programs targeted at helping 
at-risk middle school students transition from 
middle to high school. Under my legislation, 
participating students would develop and exe-
cute a formalized plan for success in high 
school and beyond, and be supported by a 
school faculty member or volunteer from the 
community known as a ‘‘Success Coach.’’ 
Middle school is a uniquely challenging time 
for students and ensuring a smooth transition 
from middle to high school is critical to their 
long-term success. School-based mentoring is 
an innovative supplement to the traditional 
learning that takes place in the classroom, 
providing underserved and at-risk students 
with attention and support to keep them en-
gaged in school. This legislation is a small 
step towards providing some of the most vul-
nerable students with individual attention to 
help cross the bridge towards high school, col-
lege, and career. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in recognizing the need for mentors 
for our children by signing on to this important 
legislation.

HONORING BROOKE CURTIS AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize Lewis Central’s 3rd-grade teacher 
Brooke Curtis as Iowan of the Week. 
Inspired by the teachers she had growing 
up in Griswold, Brooke always wanted to 
teach. After graduating high school, she at-
tended the University of Iowa and got her

master’s from Concordia in early education. 
She began teaching a unique program to the 
Council Bluffs school district known as Transi-
tional Kindergarten, or T-K as she calls it. 
Transitional Kindergarten is an amazing pro-
gram that accepts 4 years and older who 
might not be ready for kindergarten. T-K is a 
wonderful opportunity to give children struc-
tured learning and development before enter-
ing kindergarten. Brooke says for many par-
ents, they face a difficult choice when they 
have a child who isn’t quite ready for school. 
As a T-K teacher, she worked with our young-
est students to prepare them with the social, 
emotional, and educational skills. 
Teaching T-K is how Brooke met Stacey 
Kuehn, who nominated Brooke to be Iowan of 
the week. Stacey was in the Harley-Davidson 
showroom, ready to buy her retirement motor-
cycle when her phone rang—she needed to 
become the caregiver of her two grand-
daughters. 
Brooke met Stacey and her granddaughters 
when they enrolled in her class. Brooke told 
Stacey she could call her and that Brooke 
would do anything to help. She kept that 
promise. Brooke began helping out with 
childcare and offering support, and helping 
these two girls grow. And that’s why I wanted 
to honor Brooke Curtis as Iowan of the Week. 
Even though Brooke assures us that all her 
fellow teachers and school administrators 
would do the same, I know that Brooke puts 
everything into being a teacher and helping 
her kids. ‘‘Teachers are givers,’’ she said, 
‘‘and while I know we can’t pour from an 
empty cup, sometimes I still try.’’ She means 
there are days, especially over the last year, 
where she gives everything she has to her 
students. It was hard on her, and her family. 
Brooke and her fellow teachers in the Coun-
cil Bluff school district have been teaching 
A&B schedules during the pandemic, where 
half their students were online and half in the 
classroom. ‘‘It’s not a skill I wanted to learn,’’ 
she joked. 
It has never been harder to be a teacher 
than right now. That is why I am proud to sup-
port legislation that invests in teacher reten-
tion, teacher mental health, more funding for 
our schools, and supporting our K–12 families. 
Teachers like Brooke should remind us all that 
investing in our teachers is really an invest-
ment in our children. 
Madam Speaker, Brooke’s dedication to her 
students and commitment to teaching future 
educators ensures our kids in Iowa are in ex-
cellent hands. It is my honor to name Brooke 
my Iowan of the Week.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
REVEREND 
EMMITT THEOPHILUS CAVINESS 
AND 
EXHIBIT 
AT 
HARRISON 
COUNTY HISTORICAL MUSEUM 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the accomplishments of Reverend 
Emmitt Theophilus Caviness and his new ex-
hibit at the Harrison County Historical Mu-
seum. For sixty years, Reverend Caviness has 
dedicated his life toward change. Born a year 
before 
the 
Great 
Depression, 
Reverend 
Caviness has led a life that has made a re-
sounding impact on the state of Ohio. 
Reverend Caviness’ has made extraordinary 
accomplishments that can be felt across our 
nation, even in the face of poverty and racial 
division. After seeing a racial caricature in 
Marshall’s City Hall, he vowed to dedicate his 
life to fighting for racial justice. His belief in 
love’s ability to heal racial wounds was exem-
plified in his support of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
Jr. His actions during the Civil Rights Move-
ment led to his induction to the International 
Civil Rights Walk of Fame, where his imprint 
is housed at Dr. King’s National Historic Site 
in Atlanta, Georgia. 
To name his accolades would be to speak 
endlessly, however, I would be remiss if I did 
not emphasize several of his most noteworthy 
achievements. The Reverend’s belief in public 
service led to him serving six years on Cleve-
land City Council. This belief bloomed further 
by sharing stages with those at the forefront of 
leadership and policy, including Presidents 
Carter, W. Bush, and Obama, as well as Civil 
Rights dignitaries Coretta Scott King and Al 
Sharpton. He would also receive the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference Award for his 
lifelong membership and recognition from The 
National Center for Civil and Human Rights 
Museum. His undying hope in ‘‘the power of a 
conversation’’ is shown through a willingness 
to engage those of every demographic, re-
gardless of their differences. 
The Harrison County Historical Museum will 
honor Reverend Caviness with the Journey 
Stories exhibit. The exhibit will showcase 
memorable photos through his journey, includ-
ing a photograph of the Reverend Martin Lu-
ther King, Jr. visiting his Cleveland church. 
The exhibit also displays awards for his serv-
ice towards change and shines a spotlight on 
his extended family. 
So, Madam Speaker, I rise again in hon-
oring Reverend Emmitt Caviness for his work 
toward creating change not only for his fellow 
Ohioans but for all Americans.

COMMEMORATING THE 85TH ANNI-
VERSARY OF GREATER ST. STE-
PHEN 
FULL 
GOSPEL 
BAPTIST 
CHURCH 
HON. TROY A. CARTER 
OF LOUISIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mr. CARTER of Louisiana. Madam Speaker, 
today I want to recognize the Greater St. Ste-
phen Full Gospel Baptist Church of New Orle-
ans, Louisiana, as they celebrated 85 years of 
service on Sunday, January 16, 2022. 
Greater St. Stephen deserves our collective 
recognition, not only because of its longevity, 
but because of the unique contributions it has 
led in building a wide-reaching community of 
both faith and service. Since the people of the 
church are the church, not just its edifices or 
buildings, we also recognize those members 
of Greater St. Stephen who are sterling exam-
ples of how everyday people, placing their 
trust in God, can accomplish extraordinary 
things. 
Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist 
Church has played a vital role in New Orleans 
and has dedicated itself to spiritually uplifting 
the community and its congregation. I myself 
am grateful to have a sacred space within its 
walls. 
There are deep roots in my family here at 
Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist 
Church. I am especially proud to say my 
Mother, Pastor Eartha Flemings Carter, pray-
erfully served this Congregation, and became 
an ordained Elder. My sister-in-law, Elder 
Constance Carter, was one of the first women 
to be ordained as an Elder at the Church in 
September 1993. 
Founded in 1937 by 69 faithful members, by 
its 50th anniversary, Greater St. Stephen grew 
to over 10,000 members; and by 2005, to over 
20,000 members, the largest congregation in 
the State of Louisiana and one of the largest 
in our country. Operating in three locations 
around New Orleans and from a separate 
headquarters, the church served as a model 
and a training ground for other expanding 
churches as to how to manage their affairs. 
More than that, Greater St. Stephen birthed 
the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship 
movement that would revolutionize the African 
American church landscape, expanding, at its 
height, to over 1,500 churches and hundreds 
of thousands of members in virtually every 
major city in the United States and in places 
as far flung and diverse as the nations of Afri-
ca, the Caribbean and Great Britain. It is fa-
mous for its powerful and inspiring gospel 
choir. 
With all of its well-deserved national and 
international acclaim, however, Greater St. 
Stephen kept its roots and focused on its local 
community through its service at home by its 
vast network of volunteer members. The 
church established a seniors’ residence; a pro-
gram for women in need of special services; 
a college scholarship program to assist high 
achieving-needy students; a learning center 
for elementary students; and a middle-class 
housing subdivision community, Greater St. 
Stephen City, among other unique under-
takings. 
None of this great church’s accomplish-
ments would have occurred except through 
the stalwart leaders who God envisioned its 
members to wisely choose. This began with 
Rev. Arthur Gundy; through Rev. Percy Simp-
son; and on through the dynamic leadership of 
Bishop Paul S. Morton, Sr. and his wife and 
partner in leadership, Dr. Debra B. Morton. 
Under Bishop Morton was when the ministry 
was extended to New Orleans East and the 
Westbank, becoming one church in three loca-
tions. 
The promise for the future of Greater St. 
Stephen remains bright under the current 
leadership of Dr. Tyrone D. Robinson and his 
wife, Elder Jasmine M. Robinson. 
Greater St. Stephen Full Gospel Baptist 
Church has continuously persevered through 
the homegoings of Pastors Gundy and Simp-
son, natural disasters including deadly storms 
like Hurricane Katrina, a devastating fire of the 
ministry’s original Uptown location, and most 
recently the challenges of navigating the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Today we proudly salute Greater St. Ste-
phen Full Gospel Baptist Church following its 
85th Anniversary because of what it has 
meant and still means to our community and 
our country. I wish it many, many more years 
of distinguished service. 
I thank them for so proudly shining the light 
of our Lord upon the Greater New Orleans 
community.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF 
COLUMBIA 
SPECIAL 
ELEC-
TIONS HOME RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Special Elec-
tions Home Rule Act. This bill would give the 
District of Columbia complete authority to set 
the date of special elections for local offices, 
like other jurisdictions. This bill simply re-
moves a D.C. Home Rule Act limitation on the 
District that is not only inconsistent with the 
self-government granted by the Home Rule 
Act, but is also counterproductive. 
This bill follows legislation we got enacted in 
2012 that gave the D.C. Board of Elections 
(‘‘Board’’) more flexibility to set the date of 
special elections for local offices to maximize 
voter participation. Although we sought com-
plete authority for the District over the sched-
uling of special elections, the 2012 law, the 
District of Columbia Special Election Reform 
Act, did not include this home-rule principle. 
D.C. should have complete authority over a 
matter that is unrelated to any other congres-
sional district and has no relevance to Con-
gress. 
The Home Rule Act originally required the 
Board to hold special elections on the first 
Tuesday occurring more than 114 days after a 
vacancy and allowed the Board to schedule 
special elections on the same day as the next 
general election if that election occurred within 
60 days from when a special election would 
otherwise have been held. This inflexibility led 
to special elections being held on religious 
holidays and forced the District to hold a spe-
cial election separate from an upcoming gen-
eral election, costing the District hundreds of 
thousands of dollars. The 2012 law requires 
the Board to hold a special election on a 
Tuesday occurring between 70 and 174 days 
after a vacancy. 
This bill is an important step to perfect 
home rule for the District. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill.

COMMEMORATING THE 32ND ANNI-
VERSARY OF BLACK JANUARY 
IN AZERBAIJAN 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the anniversary of the ‘‘Black 
January’’ killings, one of the most tragic 
events in Azerbaijan’s history. 
Thirty-two years ago, on the night of Janu-
ary 20, 1990, approximately 26,000 Soviet 
troops stormed Azerbaijan’s capital city of 
Baku in tanks and armored vehicles. The So-
viet military bulldozed and opened fired on in-
nocent Azerbaijanis and peaceful protestors, 
including women and children. The resulting 
casualties of these brutal acts were 147 peo-
ple killed, around 800 injured, 841 arrested, 
and 5 missing. I offer my thoughts and prayers 
to the families of those who gave their lives for 
the independence of Azerbaijan. 
Despite these merciless acts, the Azer-
baijani people were not deterred. They contin-
ued to fight for their freedom and became 
independent in 1991. The United States was 
one of the first countries to recognize Azer-
baijan’s independence and fully established 
diplomatic relations on February 28, 1992. The 
relationship between our two countries en-
dures to this day. The United States and Azer-
baijan are strategic allies and share common 
interests in the region and globally. 
As the co-chairman of the Congressional 
Azerbaijan Caucus, I urge my colleagues to 
recognize the sacrifices of the Azerbaijani 
people in their steps toward a free-market 
economy and encourage a recommitment to 
the 
democratic 
values 
for 
which 
many 
Azerbaijanis sacrificed their lives.

HONORING OUTGOING DEARBORN 
CITY COUNCIL MEMBER BRIAN 
O’DONNELL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mr. Brian O’Donnell on the 
occasionV his retirement from the City Council 
of Dearborn, Michigan, where he has honor-
ably served for over ten years. His significant 
contributions to our community are worthy of 
commendation. 
Mr. O’Donnell is a graduate of Divine Child 
High School in Dearborn. He also attended 
Madonna University and Baker College. An 
active member of the Dearborn community for 
over two decades, he has served as a City 
Beautiful Commissioner, as Vice President of 
the Dearborn Federation of Neighborhood As-
sociations, and as a trustee of the Dearborn 
Hills Civic Association. Beyond serving on the 
Council, he has worked for the Bristol-Myers 
Squibb Company and the State of Michigan. 
While on the Dearborn City Council, Mr. 
O’Donnell was dedicated to promoting smart 
government spending while still ensuring that 
the City can continue to provide stellar service 
to the residents of Dearborn. His voice was 
constantly a part of the productive discussion 
and progress made during his time on the 
Council. From fixing broken streetlights to par-
ticipating in countless community events 
around town, his focus was on revitalizing and 
stabilizing our neighborhoods and making 
them a better place for all. Mr. O’Donnell’s 
leadership and insight are an asset to the 
Dearborn community at large. He continues to 
live in the Dearborn area with his wife Julia 
and their children Sean and Cece. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Brian O’Donnell. We are grate-
ful for his time spent serving the citizens of 
Dearborn as a member of the City Council. I 
join with his family, friends, and colleagues in 
extending my best wishes to him in the future. 
HONORING FRIENDS OF 
LOXAHATCHEE 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
40th Anniversary of the Friends of the Arthur 
R. Marshall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Ref-
uge, a non-profit organization in Florida’s 21st 
Congressional District. Since its founding in 
1982, the Friends of Loxahatchee have been 
tirelessly committed to conserving Florida’s 
beautiful natural ecosystems for future genera-
tions to enjoy. 
The Friends of Loxahatchee was our na-
tion’s first U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
Friends group. Throughout its years of oper-
ation, the over 300 member organization has 
supported environmental education and wild-
life protection services at the Arthur R. Mar-
shall Loxahatchee National Wildlife Refuge— 
the northernmost part of the Florida Ever-
glades. The contributions made by Friends of 
Loxahatchee members and volunteers have 
introduced countless children across South 
Florida to science and the wonder of the Ever-
glades. Their projects have engaged dis-
advantaged youth in environmental conserva-
tion and coastal clean-up efforts, funded trans-
portation to the Refuge for school and commu-
nity groups, and renovated the Refuge Visitor 
Center and its exhibits. 
I am proud to honor the Friends of 
Loxahatchee for their years of service to the 
people of South Florida, their education of the 
next generation of leaders, and their dedica-
tion to protecting our animals, plants, and 
habitats. I look forward to their contributions in 
the years ahead.

HONORING ANICETO ‘‘CHETO’’ 
PEREZ, JR. 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Aniceto ‘‘Cheto’’ Perez, Jr., of Alice, 
Texas. Aniceto has dedicated his life to public 
service and law enforcement for over three 
decades and has made a lasting impact on 
the people of South Texas. 
Aniceto was born to Aniceto Perez, Sr. and 
Martha Valerio Perez of San Diego, Texas in 
1959. After graduating from San Diego High 
School in 1978, Aniceto knew he wanted to 
establish a career in law enforcement. He 
began his career with the Duval County Sher-
iffs Department in 1978, serving as a tele-
communicator and jailer before transferring to 
the City of Alice Police Department. 
Aniceto started at the Alice Police Depart-
ment as a uniformed patrol officer and was 
promoted three years later to the Narcotics 
Unit. As a narcotics investigator, Aniceto per-
formed undercover operations and served as 
a member of the Narcotics Task Force, work-
ing closely with local, state, and federal agen-
cies. Aniceto was then promoted once again, 
this time to Sergeant Investigator of the Nar-
cotics Unit, making him the lead investigator

on many cases. During his tenure in the Nar-
cotics Unit, Aniceto assisted in the seizure of 
several tons of illegal narcotics, millions of dol-
lars in narcotics-related currency, and count-
less weapons utilized by drug trafficking orga-
nizations. Aniceto also held roles as an Inter-
nal Affairs Investigator; Interim Lieutenant for 
the Patrol and Traffic Division; Training Coor-
dinator; Commander of the Special Weapons 
and Tactics (SWAT) Team; Police Bicycle Pa-
trol Instructor; Firearms Instructor; Honor 
Guard Member; Licensed Forensic Hypnosis 
Administrator; and Chief of Police. Aniceto re-
tired from law enforcement after 39 years of 
service with the Alice Police Department, the 
longest tenure to date. 
Although it would be impossible to list all the 
impactful cases he worked on and all he 
achieved during his time at the Alice Police 
Department, these cases stand out over the 
course of Aniceto ’s storied career: 
In 1994, Aniceto was a member of the team 
assigned to investigate the capital murder 
case of Trini Gonzalez, who was only 9 years 
old at the time of her death. This investigation 
led to the arrest and conviction of two people. 
In 2008, Aniceto was a member of the in-
vestigating team that responded to an armed 
bank robbery of a Wells Fargo Bank that in-
volved the shooting of an Alice police officer. 
This investigation led to an arrest, conviction, 
and recovery of stolen currency. 
In 2018, Aniceto was made lead investigator 
on the murder case of Matthew Murphy, a po-
lice officer shot in the line of duty. This case 
had remained unsolved since 1974, but 
through much diligence and investigation 
Aniceto and his team obtained a confession, 
arrest, and conviction for the case, which 
spanned from Texas to Alabama. 
Aniceto also participated in a lengthy multi- 
agency surveillance operation of a suspected 
member of the Asian Triad who was living in 
Alice and owned a business there. Upon his 
arrest, the suspect was found to be in posses-
sion of floor plans of a federal building in Cor-
pus Christi. This operation is believed to have 
stopped a possible terrorist attack on the 
building. 
Aniceto has accumulated an impressive 
number of awards and commendations over 
the course of his career, including the City of 
Alice Chamber of Commerce Police Officer of 
the Year Award in 1995 and 2018, the City of 
Alice Police Department Achievement Award, 
and the Jim Wells County Leadership Award. 
He is also very engaged in the community, 
and has served as a board member, volunteer 
coach and official for the Boys and Girls Club, 
regional coordinator for Toys for Tots, and 
judge for various local athletic organizations 
including the Alice Swim Team and the Coast-
al Bend Allstars Swim Team. 
Aniceto expresses no desire to slow down 
anytime soon. He is currently a Professor and 
Criminal Justice Faculty Lead at Coastal Bend 
College, where he shares his knowledge and 
expertise with students. Aniceto has ex-
pressed gratitude and love for his career; how-
ever, he states his greatest accomplishments 
are being a husband to his wife Jo Ann for 37 
years, being a father to his daughter Sabrina 
and son Aeren, and being a grandfather to his 
two grandchildren, Aaden and Alaina. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to recognize 
Aniceto Cheto Perez, Jr., a truly passionate 
public servant who represents the best of our 
community. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
congratulating him on his outstanding career 
and thanking him for his devotion to the peo-
ple of the Rio Grande Valley.

HONORING LEWIS JORDAN 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Lewis Jordan who is 
being honored for his exemplary service as 
Executive Director of the Housing Authority for 
the County of Marin from 2012 to 2021. 
For nearly a decade, Mr. Jordan led the 
Marin Housing Authority (MHA) in its mission 
to improve housing opportunities for low-in-
come families, seniors, and children and con-
front 
systemic 
inequities 
related 
to 
generational poverty and racial disparity in 
Marin County. During his nine-year tenure, Mr. 
Jordan managed an annual budget of approxi-
mately 50 million dollars. He fostered robust fi-
nancial viability across programs and in-
creased opportunities for additional funding 
from the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development (HUD). 
Mr. Jordan’s collaborative work with other 
community groups including businesses, gov-
ernment entities, and community-based orga-
nizations produced results. He increased ac-
cess to resources for Marin’s vulnerable resi-
dents through partnership with Marin Home-
less Continuum of Care and by ensuring ac-
cess to specialty vouchers for veterans, the 
unhomed, and survivors of domestic violence. 
The landlord partnership program he devel-
oped increased MHA’s voucher utilization rate 
to more than 95 percent, and the program has 
since become a nationwide model. 
When the COVID–19 pandemic increased 
the threat of homelessness and placed a sub-
sequent strain on housing, Mr. Jordan and his 
team at MHA effectively distributed 117 Emer-
gency Housing Vouchers to at-risk community 
members and organized the issuance of HUD 
waivers to provide critical relief to tenants en-
rolled in their subsidized programs. 
My staff and I have worked closely with Mr. 
Jordan through his tenure with MHA, and I 
have seen first-hand his skills and commit-
ment to improving the quality of life for our 
community in Marin County and the extended 
region. 
Lewis Jordan is a man of conviction. His 
values and many good deeds are appreciated 
and worthy of special recognition. Madam 
Speaker, I respectfully ask that you join me in 
expressing gratitude to Lewis Jordan for his 
hard work and accomplishments and extend-
ing to him best wishes in his next endeavors.

RECOGNIZING ROBERT WINKLER 
HON. BRIAN K. FITZPATRICK 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, January 25, 2022 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize a notable public servant 
within my district, Robert Winkler. After serving 
his community as a Zoning Officer, Code En-
forcement Officer, and Building Inspector for 
twenty-four years, Robert ran for office and 
was chosen by the Borough of Penndel to be 
their Mayor. 
Throughout his twelve year tenure, Mayor 
Winkler worked diligently to improve the bor-
ough and the quality of life of all its citizens. 
Through his relationships with other elected 
officials at every level of government, as well 
as business owners and industry executives, 
Robert improved the delivery of municipal 
services. He increased communication be-
tween residents and businesses through the 
establishment of a semi-annual newsletter. 
Through his office, Mayor Winkler actively co-
ordinated community events such as holiday 
parades, the Penndel Borough Community 
Day, and food drives. His work did not go un-
noticed: not only was he re-elected three 
times, but Robert was also honored by the 
Pennsylvania State Association of Boroughs 
as Mayor of the Year in 2019. 
Today, I am proud to recognize Robert 
Winkler as an exceptional man of proven lead-
ership who never wavered in his commitment 
to serving our community and country. We are 
incredibly grateful for Robert’s decades of 
public service and the positive impact that he 
has had on his beloved home of Penndel and 
the entirety of our Bucks County community.

and Water World at the age of 11 and took 
over the park in 1965. His loyalty and tireless

the past seventeen years, she specializes in 
Family Law, Contracts, Immigration, Real Es-

When she was first elected in 2013, Mrs.

Council President, Mrs. Dabaja was a leader 
on and off the council and stressed the impor-

of Dearborn. She was a strong proponent of 
many successful initiatives, including the Dear-
born Multi-Modal Transportation Plan. Mrs. 
Dabaja made public safety a top priority and 
was a strong supporter of the city’s police and 
fire departments. Besides her time spent prac-
ticing law and serving on the Council, she 
serves as co-chair of the Dearborn Education 
Foundation and as chair of the Local Commu-
nity Stabilization Authority. She also partici-
pates in the University of Michigan-Dearborn 
Citizen Advisory Committee, the Dearborn Ro-
tary Club, and Dearborn Goodfellows. She 
continues to reside in Dearborn with her hus-
band Majid and their children, Claudia, Joe¨l, 
and Adam. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Susan Dabaja. We are grateful 
for her time spent serving the citizens of Dear-
born. I join with her family, friends, and col-
leagues in extending my best wishes to her for 
the future.
