gifts we are given to cherish. 
Hour by hour, as we clock the passing

set our schedules wisely and to exercise 
the skills and abilities as You have 
graced us, all for the betterment of our

When each dawn breaks, may we 
greet it, rejoicing in the day You have

You have guided our steps and directed 
us on the paths You would have us go. 
Allow us, then, to see Your presence 
in the minutes, hours, and days we are 
given. In each moment that You lavish

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I 
would like to welcome you and all of 
my colleagues back from the August 
work period. I hope everyone had the 
chance to travel across their States, 
meet with their constituents, listen to 
their concerns, and share all the major 
accomplishments the Senate secured 
over the last few months. 
Indeed, the Senate gavels back into 
session after a season of immense pro-
ductivity. When Democrats assumed 
the majority in 2021, I promised we 
would leave no stone unturned in tack-
ling the biggest challenges facing our 
country. Twenty months later, Demo-
crats have delivered on our promises. 
We promised to lower costs for the 
American people in the wake of crip-
pling inflation; so we passed the Infla-
tion Reduction Act to reduce energy 
costs, reduce healthcare costs, and ex-
pand tax breaks for working and mid-
dle Americans. 
We also promised to take on Big 
Pharma and lower prescription drug 
costs, so we passed historic legislation 
to lower insulin costs for seniors on 
Medicare, cap out-of-pocket expenses, 
and empowered Medicare to finally be 
able to negotiate drug prices—this for 
the first time ever; long sought after 
by many Congresses; accomplished by 
this one. 
We promised to take on entrenched 
oil interests and get tough on climate 
change, and so we passed the largest 
clean energy package ever—by a long 
margin, by the way. 
Thanks to our work, Americans will 
see their energy bills go down, their 
savings go up, all while we create mil-
lions of new, good-paying jobs and fi-
nally dealt with climate change in a 
very significant and real way. 
We also promised to bring manufac-
turing jobs back to America and get 
tough on adversaries like the Chinese 
Communist Party, so we passed the 
CHIPS and Science Act, the largest in-
vestment in manufacturing jobs and 
science research since the aftermath of 
World War II. 
Of course, we promised to take on the 
NRA, as the Presiding Officer well 
knows, and protect our kids from gun 
violence, so we passed the first gun 
safety bill since the Brady law 30 years 
ago, which I was proud to author when 
I was a Member of Congress. 
Now, none of these accomplishments 
were easy. They demanded immense 
patience and persistence above all. But 
for anyone who thought Washington

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4418 
September 6, 2022 
was broken and couldn’t do big things, 
this Democratic majority has shown 
that real change is possible. The re-
sults speak for themselves. Jobs across 
the country remain up. Americans are 
going back to work. Our supply chains 
are healing. In fact, freight rates on 
ocean trade channels have dropped by 
60 percent since January. As gas prices 
continue their 2-month drop, we are 
seeing evidence that inflation might be 
starting to ease up. 
Of course, the work isn’t done. As we 
begin this short work period, we have 
several high-priority items that de-
mand our immediate attention. Before 
this work period concludes, the Senate 
must come together to pass a con-
tinuing resolution to extend govern-
ment funding beyond the September 30 
deadline. 
Last week, the administration sent 
us a request for a number of funding 
items they would like us to work on— 
aid to Ukraine, pandemic relief, and 
other items. 
This process, of course, needs to be 
bipartisan. Democrats are going to 
work in good faith to avoid even a hint 
of a shutdown, and it is my expectation 
that our Republican colleagues will do 
the same. 
We will also work this month to con-
firm even more of President Biden’s ju-
dicial nominees. Later today, the Sen-
ate is scheduled to vote to advance the 
nomination of Judge John Lee to serve 
as a circuit court judge for the Seventh 
Circuit. If confirmed, Judge Lee would 
make history as the first Asian-Amer-
ican judge to sit on the Seventh Cir-
cuit, joining the proud company of 
other Biden nominees who are making 
our courts fairer and more representa-
tive of our great country. 
A graduate of Harvard and Harvard 
Law School, Judge Lee was unani-
mously confirmed by this Chamber a 
decade ago to serve as a district judge. 
In his time on the bench, he has proven 
himself to be impartial, fairminded, 
and committed to the rule of law. 
Judge Lee will be the first of many 
judicial nominees whom we will ad-
vance this month and beyond because 
now more than ever, the Senate must 
make judicial confirmations a top pri-
ority. 
We have a lot of work to do in the 
Senate to keep improving the lives of 
the American people, so in the coming 
weeks, let us continue with the same 
vigor, the same determination, the 
same persistence that has made this 
one of the most productive Senate ses-
sions the Senate has seen in a long, 
long time. 
STUDENT LOAN DEBT RELIEF PLAN 
Finally, I want to say a few words on 
another monumental development that 
happened over the August recess: stu-
dent debt cancelation. 
For the past 2 years, I have repeat-
edly stated that with the simple flick 
of a pen, President Biden could lower 
costs for millions of Americans by can-
celing their student debt. Everywhere I 
go, student debt is always front of 
mind for many of my fellow New York-
ers, as it is for millions across the 
country. 
There are many who don’t have stu-
dent debt—many—but for those who 
do, it is deep. This is not just 1 of 10 
issues; this is the issue that really, 
really bothers them and motivates 
them, to have to wake up in the middle 
of the night, saying: How am I going to 
make that $400 payment next month 
when my salary doesn’t stretch that 
far? What am I going to cut out of my 
life? 
Well, with that long-awaited flick of 
the pen, President Biden gave tens of 
millions of Americans a new lease on 
life by canceling significant amounts 
of student debt. 
To President Biden, I say thank you. 
Thank you for listening to our cause. 
Thank you for taking action. 
The President’s decision will make it 
easier for millions of Americans to fi-
nally 
pursue 
their 
own 
American 
dream, whether that means making 
that downpayment on a house or buy-
ing that new car or opening a business 
or saving for retirement. It will help 
close the racial wealth gap that still 
holds far too many Americans back, 
and most of all, it is going to make our 
economy strong. 
Now, over the past few weeks, we 
have heard a lot of fake outrage from 
Republicans, saying that canceling stu-
dent debt is nothing more than a give-
away to wealthy Americans. The same 
Republicans who made tax cuts for the 
ultrarich their No. 1 priority are sud-
denly apoplectic at the thought of 
helping working— and middle-class 
Americans with student debt relief. 
Well, here is the truth, I say to my 
Republican colleagues: Among bor-
rowers who are no longer in school, 90 
percent of the debt canceled will go to 
those earning less than $75,000 a year— 
the opposite of the tax cuts that Re-
publicans pushed for where the vast 
majority of the money went to the top 
1 percent and the top 10 percent. 
Let me repeat that. Among bor-
rowers who are no longer in school, 
nearly 90 percent of the debt being can-
celed will go to those earning less than 
$75,000 a year. 
Let’s not forget that a majority of 
student loans are held by people whose 
families have zero net worth—zero. A 
majority of student loans are to fami-
lies who have zero net worth. That is 
why the greatest help will go to those 
with the greatest need. Pell grant re-
cipients, who for the most part come 
from families making under $60,000 a 
year, will have up to $20,000 of their 
debt canceled. 
So rather than helping the privileged 
few, canceling student debt is going to 
lift up Americans from all walks of 
life—students of color, poor Americans, 
children of immigrants, working- and 
middle-class families struggling to ei-
ther get to the middle class or stay 
there. 
So, again, I thank President Biden 
for taking action. I also want to thank 
champions like Senator WARREN, who 
has been such a great partner in this 
activity, Senator WARNOCK, and Rep-
resentative PRESSLEY, who joined with 
me in calling for the President to take 
this step. They have all been great 
partners in the effort, and I am glad 
our efforts finally began to pay off. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
EASTERN KENTUCKY FLOODING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, it 
has been over a month since relentless 
rains and major flooding devastated 
Eastern Kentucky. This disaster took 
homes, businesses, and at least 39 lives. 
Only a few months after tornadoes had 
caused widespread damage in the west-
ern part of our State, catastrophe 
struck our Commonwealth one more 
time. 
I traveled back to Eastern Kentucky 
multiple times during the August 
State work period to survey damage, 
meet with survivors, and lend any help 
I could. What I saw were scenes of ab-
solute 
destruction: 
water-logged 
houses, 
swollen 
creeks, 
washed-out 
roads. I heard directly from survivors 
who have shouldered impossible bur-
dens over the past month, struggling to 
salvage belongings and to literally try 
to rebuild their lives. Agencies report 
that thousands of homes were de-
stroyed and damaged in the flooding. 
Many of those affected lack flood in-
surance. 
I will say that as devastating as the 
flooding was, stories of heroism and 
generosity still shine through. The 
local officials I met with reserved spe-
cial praise for Kentucky’s National 
Guard. Our guardsmen mobilized at the 
outset of this crisis to perform daring 
rescues and to distribute critical sup-
plies to stranded residents. Regular 
citizens also came to the aid of their 
neighbors and friends in any way they 
could, sometimes in trucks and some-
times on horseback or jet skis. 
Help has poured in from around our 
State and beyond, both from private 
charities and trained emergency re-
sponders, but, of course, there is still a 
tremendous need for help. Eastern Ken-
tucky has notoriously rugged terrain. 
It also had preexisting communications 
issues before the floods. These factors 
have 
made 
rescue 
and 
rebuilding 
uniquely challenging already, and this 
is only the beginning. 
Although FEMA is playing a critical 
role in Eastern Kentucky’s recovery, 
Kentuckians 
have 
grave 
concerns 
about shortcomings in the Federal re-
sponse. The Agency’s convoluted appli-
cation processes have left far too many

flood victims without the timely aid 
they need, often due to just simple 
clerical errors. I heard about these 
issues firsthand from countless Ken-
tuckians I met during my multiple vis-
its. 
Of course, I quickly called FEMA Ad-
ministrator Criswell to say her Agency 
needs to step it up. I visited the Ken-
tucky Emergency Operations Center to 
review the joint State and Federal re-
sponse firsthand. I convened leaders 
from our hardest hit counties, the 
State legislature, and Federal response 
Agencies so we have clearer lines of 
communication moving forward. 
I hope and expect aid will begin to 
flow more smoothly to Eastern Ken-
tucky soon, and I will continue work-
ing around the clock here in Wash-
ington to try to help make that hap-
pen. 
And I promise to keep standing 
strong by Eastern Kentucky’s side as 
our 
immediate 
efforts 
evolve 
into 
longer term rebuilding. 
A long road—a very long road—to re-
covery lies before us, but Eastern Ken-
tucky will come back stronger than 
ever. 
THE ECONOMY 
Now on another matter, American 
families are hurting, and they are very 
clearly telling anybody who will listen 
to them what our priorities ought to 
be. 
Americans’ 
No. 
1 
concern—by 
a 
mile—is the crushing inflation that 
Democrats spent us into. The share of 
Americans who name inflation as our 
most urgent problem is almost triple 
the next closest issue. 
Democrats’ policies have working 
people paying a Democrat inflation tax 
of more than 13 percent on top of their 
grocery bills, 15 percent extra on their 
electric bills, and on and on down the 
list of everything that families need to 
just stay afloat. 
As a result, Democrats have presided 
over plummeting real wages for Amer-
ican workers. The average American 
worker has gotten a raise on paper, but 
their bigger paycheck buys them less 
than their smaller paycheck bought 
them this time last year. 
Now, this wasn’t inevitable. Inflation 
did not have to be nearly this bad. 
Democrats chose to spend so reck-
lessly. Democrats chose to wage this 
economic warfare against the middle 
class, against their savings, against 
their financial stability, against the 
purchasing power and the lifestyles 
that workers and parents sacrificed, 
literally, for years to build up. 
Americans are also deeply concerned 
about the erosion of law and order on 
our streets, in our cities, on our bor-
ders, and across our country. 
When you combine together crime 
and immigration, the issue of law and 
order ranks as the people’s clear No. 2 
concern, second only to inflation. 
Last year, the national murder rate 
reached its highest level in 25 years. 
Cities across the country are con-
tending 
with 
a 
historic 
surge 
in 
carjackings. My hometown of Louis-
ville is now averaging an auto theft 
every 21⁄2
hours. President Biden’s 
failed border policies have Customs and 
Border Protection encountering 200 
percent 
more 
fentanyl 
and 
appre-
hending the most illegal immigrants 
they have seen in more than 20 years. 
So there is no mystery about the cri-
ses facing our country. The American 
people know what needs to be ad-
dressed. Republicans know what needs 
to be addressed. But, unfortunately, 
the Democrats, who control the Sen-
ate, the House, and the White House, 
are still refusing to get with the pro-
gram. 
Democrats’ top priority for the en-
tire year was the multi-hundred-bil-
lion-dollar reckless taxing and spend-
ing spree they rammed through in Au-
gust. 
Americans may want their leaders to 
cut inflation, fight crime and drugs, 
and secure the border, but Democrats 
just spent hundreds of billions of dol-
lars of the people’s money doing pre-
cisely none of that. 
Instead, our big-spending colleagues 
treated themselves to 87,000 new IRS 
agents, job-killing tax hikes, and the 
same kind of liberal energy policies 
that 
now 
have 
California 
officials 
warning—warning—about 
rolling 
blackouts and begging people not to 
charge up their electric cars. 
Oh, oh, and our Democratic col-
leagues have given no indication that 
cutting inflation, fighting crime, or se-
curing the border will be on the Sen-
ate’s agenda for September either. 
When our people are hurting this 
badly and speaking this clearly, it 
takes a willful choice—a choice—for 
Democrats to ignore them. 
Stable prices, safe streets, reliable 
energy, and a secure border—four of 
the most basic duties that any govern-
ment owes its people; four things 
Democrats have proven they cannot de-
liver. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mr. DURBIN. Good news to report to 
my colleague from the Commonwealth 
of Kentucky: a gallon of gasoline on 
the way to the airport this morning— 
$3.46 a gallon. I wish it were lower, but 
we have made progress from the days 
when it was over $5. We are moving in 
the right direction. 
And, incidentally, this President has 
created more jobs than any President 
in a similar period in the history of the 
United States. 
Do we have challenges? You bet we 
do. But to write this administration off 
as unproductive is to ignore the obvi-
ous. 
We came out of this pandemic, and 
when we did, we faced the problems 
that nations around the world were 
facing. Literally, could we deal with in-
flation? Demand was pent up, and it 
overwhelmed the services and goods 
that were available and inflation start-
ed to rise. 
It took its toll—it still does—on 
American families, but to ignore what 
we have been able to do is to really 
turn our backs on reality. 
What about that rescue plan, the 
American Rescue Plan? I remember it, 
and I remember there wasn’t a single 
Republican voting for it. 
Almost 20 percent of the American 
Rescue Plan went to State and local 
governments to deal with issues like 
crime to make safer streets and safer 
neighborhoods for Americans across 
the board. That is the kind of money 
well-spent, and yet the Republicans 
wouldn’t give us a single vote. 
You heard the Senator from Ken-
tucky deriding it at this moment as a 
waste of billions of dollars. It is money 
well-spent, and I found out personally, 
firsthand, when I went back in my 
State over the August recess. 
I didn’t just confine myself to the 
blue areas of the State, and there are 
big ones and a big part of our State, 
and I am happy to visit there. I went to 
some of the redder sections of our 
State, the areas that voted for Donald 
Trump in the last election over Joe 
Biden. I don’t do particularly well 
there either, but I wanted to visit with 
them, and I felt that there were things 
I needed to learn about what families 
and communities were facing. 
I went to Herrin, IL, in the southern 
part of our State, where my family has 
its roots, and I went to Southern Illi-
nois Healthcare, which is a major 
healthcare consortium serving most of 
downstate Illinois—rural, smalltown 
America, struggling with providing 
professional medical care but doing a 
fine job. 
We have something called congres-
sionally directed spending now. It used 
to be known as earmarks. I am 
unapologetic about it. I believe that if 
you make a public disclosure of these 
earmarks to justify them, taxpayers 
understand this is Federal money being 
brought home from Washington to 
their States and communities, where it 
is needed. 
So I went to Herrin, IL, where we 
were able to announce an earmark of $1 
million, which is going to provide for 
about half the cost of a new physical 
rehab facility—critically important. 
I met some interesting people there. 
I met a little fellow, 4 years old, the 
victim of cerebral palsy. His name is 
Maverick. Maverick had a big smile on 
his face. He was there at the rehab cen-
ter to introduce me to the nurse that 
has been working with him, strong, 
courageous little fellow—the pride of 
his family, the kind of courage he is 
showing. 
Now, he has a rehab facility that is 
world-class in his region, in his neigh-
borhood—the alternative, drive to St. 
Louis. You hear that over and over 
again in that part of the State: We just 
don’t have any. We have to drive to St. 
Louis. 
When it comes to rehab services for 
Maverick, kids like him, and adults as 
well, they now have a fighting chance 
to get something local.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4420 
September 6, 2022 
And let me add, another fellow was 
there by the name of Riley Baird. Riley 
is a high school student, and he is an 
amazing kid himself. He is a Boy 
Scout, and I used to be a Boy Scout a 
long, long time ago. He had that sash 
with all the merit badges on it. I think 
I had five of them when I finally quit. 
He must have had 50, maybe 100. He had 
them all on his way and past as an 
Eagle Scout. 
He decided to make that rehab clinic 
his project. He and his family built 
some toys that the kids are using 
there, and he was there to accept the 
recognition and praise he deserved. 
He has a brother named Corbin—twin 
brother named Corbin, also an Eagle 
Scout, who picked a different charity 
to provide help to. 
I just want to say for anybody who is 
despondent about the future of this 
country, you ought to meet Corbin and 
Riley Baird. Those two young men are 
going to be leaders, I am sure, in their 
community and beyond. 
And it reminded me, too, that we 
ought to take a look at the positive 
things that are coming about. This no-
tion of the reconciliation bill not serv-
ing America is ignoring the obvious. 
How many of us in the Senate—Re-
publicans and Democrats—have had 
press conferences put on campaign ads 
talking about the cost of prescription 
drugs? Guess what. We finally did 
something about it. After all these 
years and all these headlines and all 
these brochures and all these ads, we 
finally did something. 
The reconciliation bill, which passed 
the U.S. Senate without a single Re-
publican vote—without one—will fi-
nally address the cost of prescription 
drugs for people on Medicare. And it 
starts reaching beyond that to say the 
pharmaceutical industry has to be re-
sponsible. They have never been able to 
defend or explain why the same drugs— 
exactly 
the 
same 
drugs—made 
in 
America are charged in Canada for a 
fraction of what people have to pay in 
this country; why Americans have to 
go without, while in other countries 
there are discounts that allow families 
to afford the drugs they need to be 
healthy and to live. 
Well, we have done something about 
it. We passed a bill that will make a 
difference. 
And when we talk about issues like 
electricity—I am going to brag a little 
bit here—my wife and I decided 2 or 3 
weeks ago to start producing elec-
tricity. We bought solar panels for our 
roof in Springfield, IL. We are not the 
first family to have them, but we are 
one of the few. I predict that is going 
to change in a hurry. Why? Because in 
that reconciliation bill, we started tak-
ing an honest look at what it takes to 
reduce climate change and to give our 
kids a planet they can live on. It means 
that each of us has to change our life-
style some. 
Well, I left this morning a little bit 
of sunshine in Springfield, IL, and it 
means that I am producing electricity 
with the local utility. I am going to try 
to do even more. My wife and I are de-
voted to showing—at least setting an 
example in this region, in this area. 
The bill we passed in reconciliation 
is going to create incentives for people 
to put solar panels on their homes, to 
buy heat pumps, electric water heat-
ers—things that will reduce the use of 
fossil fuels and, instead, move us to-
ward a more electric economy. 
And, yes, automobiles are headed in 
that direction too, and it didn’t take a 
Federal mandate. The major car pro-
ducers are headed that way, whether 
we like it or not. They understand 
where we need to go as a country and 
where the consumers are headed, and I 
think that is a good indication as well. 
So when I hear the Republican leader 
come to the floor and say that things 
are so awful, I don’t doubt that many 
families are struggling, and we should 
be sensitive and mindful of that every 
single day, but a lot of good things are 
happening too. The employment fig-
ures are encouraging. Our move toward 
dealing with climate change is encour-
aging, as well. The fact the pharma-
ceutical companies are going to be held 
responsible and the fact that corpora-
tions that have had a net profit of $1 
billion or more—listen to that close-
ly—net profit of $1 billion or more in 
the last 3 years are finally going to 
have to pay some Federal income 
taxes. Americans are used to paying 
their fair share of taxes. Why are these 
corporations making over $1 billion in 
net profits each year not paying a 
penny? That is going to change, and it 
is in the bill too. And I know it is a 
bone in the throat of my Republican 
colleagues, but it is only fair. 
This week we return after a 4-week 
recess. I was traveling around my 
State, listening to ideas and concerns. 
And you know what I heard over and 
over again? And this is overwhelming, 
particularly in the area of healthcare, 
but not exclusively: We just don’t have 
enough people to fill the vacancies and 
jobs in America. We have roughly 11 
million vacancies and 5 million people 
unemployed. That is the reality. 
And when it comes to healthcare 
workers, it is a reality that means the 
cost of medical care is going up. If you 
can’t find a local nurse to go on staff, 
on payroll, and be with you for a while 
and you have to rely on contract 
nurses, those who come and go, they 
have all the skill and training, but 
they are looking for a pretty big pay-
check, sometimes three times what the 
regular nurses are receiving. That 
drives up the cost of healthcare. And 
hospitals and clinics are desperate for 
these nurses to be there. 
I found all across my State—from the 
city of Chicago to the smallest town 
downstate—this is a challenge that we 
face and need to do something about. 
But people, over and over again, de-
spite what we saw in many of the re-
ports on television, really do still love 
this country. They are concerned about 
the divisions we see every single day. 
America has always been a can-do 
nation. Faith in the future and in our 
ability to solve our problems, create a 
better future, has always been part of 
American DNA. 
It is hard to find common ground on 
scorched earth. As President Lincoln 
warned us long ago, ‘‘a house divided 
against itself cannot stand.’’ 
A few years later, as the Civil War 
ended and victory was in sight, Presi-
dent Lincoln pleaded, just outside this 
room, on his inauguration, with the 
people of the North and the South, and 
he said: 
We are not enemies, but friends. We must 
not be enemies. 
He said that after the deadliest war 
that America ever experienced. He 
knew that the work of rebuilding this 
battered Nation and creating a better 
future would only be achieved if we 
were united—the United States of 
America. 
This week marks the 21st anniver-
sary of the September 11 terrorist at-
tack on America. I will never forget 
that day as long as I live. 
I know, Mr. President, that you 
won’t forget it either because it af-
fected your State and many people who 
live there. 
Those who are old enough to remem-
ber not just the shocking grief of that 
day will also remember the intense 
sense of national unity that sustained 
us through the terrible days and weeks 
that followed. We lost so much, but we 
found a common purpose. We under-
stood that we are one Nation, one peo-
ple, with one destiny. We rise or we fall 
together. 
As the Senate returns to the work of 
legislating, I hope that we will remem-
ber President Lincoln’s plea that ‘‘we 
must not be enemies.’’ Politics is not 
war. It is where we resolve our dif-
ferences without war, in a democracy. 
People 
in 
Illinois 
are 
concerned 
about our state of the economy. They 
are worried about inflation. I under-
stand that. They are also feeling some-
thing that many haven’t felt for a 
while, and that is hope. Why? Because 
of results. Inflation is, in fact, slowing. 
Gas prices are falling. At $3.46 a gallon, 
I would have grabbed that a few weeks 
ago, and I hope it can go lower. Gas is 
down by more than $1.20 a gallon on 
the average since the start of the sum-
mer. 
Wages are up. People are back at 
work. We now have more than recov-
ered all the jobs that our economy lost 
during the pandemic. Our economy has 
added more than 10 million new jobs, 
including 600,000 manufacturing jobs, 
under President Biden. 
We are investing in infrastructure. I 
remind myself over and over again: 
Don’t complain if construction on 
highways just slowed you down. You 
voted for it, Senator. 
And I would vote for it again. 
President Biden said yesterday, on 
Labor Day, in one of his speeches, that 
when we make this investment in in-
frastructure—a 
recordbreaking, 
his-
toric amount—we will have the most

modern infrastructure in the world. 
Now, that is what a nation that is pre-
pared to compete does. 
We passed the CHIPS Act to preserve 
America’s leadership in research and 
innovation and to produce semiconduc-
tors and jobs and the industries of the 
future in America, not in China. As the 
President also said yesterday, why 
wouldn’t it be in America? We invented 
the chip. Shouldn’t we be leading the 
world still? 
Well, with the passage of the CHIPS 
legislation in a strong bipartisan vote 
on the floor, we are going to reclaim 
that lead. 
We passed the Inflation Reduction 
Act, which includes the biggest ever in-
vestment in climate change and cli-
mate resilience. It will reduce infla-
tionary pressure by cutting energy 
costs now and in the future, and it also 
reduces the cost of prescription drugs. 
We are investing in the American 
people on the basis of a shared, sustain-
able economic prosperity. 
Oh, one footnote that is well worth 
mentioning: The Federal deficit will 
shrink by $1.7 trillion this year. All of 
the things that I have mentioned and 
all of the criticism we have heard from 
the other side of the aisle, and the def-
icit is going down. 
Nearly all of these economic pros-
perity 
proposals 
were passed with 
Democratic votes only. Chips is an ex-
ception. Infrastructure is an exception. 
But the American Rescue Plan and the 
inflation reduction plan were strictly 
Democratic votes. It is our hope that 
our Republican colleagues will now 
join us and help us get back to work in 
fighting the common challenges facing 
the Nation. 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. President, on another matter, I 
want to take a moment to speak about 
one of my highest priorities as chair of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee: the 
confirmation 
of 
highly 
qualified 
judges. This is one of the great shared 
successes of President Biden and the 
Senate Democrats and Republicans 
who have stood with us on some key 
votes. 
As of today, the Senate has con-
firmed 76 judges to lifetime positions 
during this 117th Congress. That figure 
includes Justice Ketanji Brown Jack-
son, an outstanding jurist, the first 
Black woman to serve on the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
I would just state that I have been in 
politics most of my adult life. I did not 
appreciate the impact that the selec-
tion of this African-American woman 
would have on the people I represent. 
Some of the toughest, hardest bar-
gaining African-American women that 
I have known in politics have come up 
to me and, in a moment, broken down 
in tears to thank me for President 
Biden’s leadership and the fact that the 
Senate approved this new Justice. It 
means that much to them. Her historic 
confirmation was a crowning achieve-
ment in our efforts to build a system of 
justice that works on behalf of every 
American. 
Outside of the Supreme Court, as I 
mentioned, the Senate has confirmed 
an 
impressive 
number 
of 
Federal 
judges: 18 circuit court nominees, 57 
district court nominees. Why is that 
important? Because the vast majority 
of cases don’t make it to the Supreme 
Court. They are resolved by judges like 
these nominees, at the district and cir-
cuit court level. 
Look at the most recent ruling yes-
terday, in terms of the judge in Florida 
and the special master that has been 
appointed for the records that were re-
moved from Mar-a-Lago. That judge 
made a critical and historic decision. 
The judges we are approving are in the 
same position to do that, and with each 
one of the judges we have confirmed, 
the American people can trust that 
they will apply the law to the facts, 
follow the precedent, and defend the 
rule of law. 
Now, these 76 judicial appointments 
are more than a statistic. With each 
confirmation, the Senate has taken a 
crucial step toward ensuring diversity 
in the Federal judiciary. President 
Biden and Senate Democrats have 
made it a priority to elevate judicial 
nominees from demographically and 
professionally 
diverse 
backgrounds. 
Many times, Republican Senators have 
joined us in this effort, and I want to 
give them credit where it is due. 
During the 117th Congress we have 
shattered records when it comes to di-
versity on the Federal Bench. Of the 18 
circuit judges confirmed by Senate 
Democrats, 14 are women and 13 are 
people of color. And of the 57 district 
court judges we have confirmed, 42 of 
the 57 are women and many represent a 
historic first—the first Muslim Amer-
ican article III judge to the first Latina 
article III judge in the State of Illinois. 
We have confirmed a record number 
of nominees who have experience serv-
ing not only as prosecutors but also as 
public defenders, voting rights experts, 
civil rights attorneys. For too long, the 
perspectives that they represent have 
not been seen on our benches in Fed-
eral 
courts. 
Thanks 
to 
President 
Biden’s leadership and the work of the 
Senate Democrats, the Federal Judici-
ary now includes many dedicated pub-
lic servants who will help bring balance 
to the Nation’s courts. And let me add 
that some of the key votes came from 
a handful of Republican Senators who 
have looked at these nominees in an 
honest fashion. 
Every one of these jurists is highly 
qualified to serve our Nation and the 
American people. That is a welcome 
shift from the previous administration, 
which often advanced nominees who 
simply checked the box ‘‘Federalist So-
ciety.’’ Thankfully, the judges taking 
the bench under President Biden are 
impartial and evenhanded. All of them 
will continue to administer equal jus-
tice under the law. 
NOMINATION OF JOHN Z. LEE 
Mr. President, later today, we will 
add, I hope, one more name to this im-
pressive roster. The Senate will vote on 
the nomination of Judge John Lee, who 
was selected for the Illinois seat on the 
Seventh Circuit. 
If confirmed, Judge Lee will be the 
first Asian-American judge ever to 
serve on the Seventh Circuit. His con-
firmation will mark yet another stride 
forward in building a judiciary that re-
flects the diversity of our Nation. 
Judge Lee was born to Korean par-
ents in Germany. His father was a coal 
miner. His mother was a nurse. He ar-
rived in America at the age of 4 and 
settled with his family in a one-bed-
room apartment in the Albany Park 
neighborhood of Chicago. 
It wasn’t easy starting off in kinder-
garten in a new land, but Judge Lee 
says he found the support of a nur-
turing community of classmates and 
teachers. He quickly learned English 
and excelled in school, graduating 
magna cum laude from Harvard College 
and cum laude from Harvard Law 
School. 
He began his legal career as a trial 
attorney in the Environment and Nat-
ural Resources Division of the Justice 
Department before working in private 
practice in Chicago. His practice fo-
cused on complex litigation, including 
antitrust and intellectual property. 
In 2011, President Biden nominated 
Judge Lee to the District Court for the 
Northern District of Illinois. When he 
was confirmed in 2012 by voice vote, 
Judge Lee became the first Korean 
American to serve as an article III 
judge in Illinois. 
Since joining the bench, he has writ-
ten hundreds of opinions and presided 
over 35 trials that went to verdict or 
judgment. He also sat by designation 
on the Seventh Circuit, a number of 
times, writing several opinions for the 
majority. 
During his time on the bench, he al-
ways applied the law to the facts before 
him in an evenhanded and fair fashion. 
Given his impeccable record and im-
pressive credentials, it is no surprise 
that the American Bar Association has 
rated John Lee unanimously ‘‘well 
qualified’’ for this circuit court posi-
tion. 
He has the strong support of myself 
and Senator DUCKWORTH. I urge my col-
leagues to join us. 
I want to close by emphasizing this: 
Our work is not finished by a long shot. 
Judge Lee is one of ten circuit court 
nominees awaiting action by the full 
Senate, and many more are still mov-
ing through the Committee. Each one 
of these public servants will bring 
much needed professional and demo-
graphic diversity. 
The judges being confirmed by this 
Senate will ensure that the rule of law 
applies to every single one of us with-
out fear or favor. They will work to up-
hold America’s most sacred promise— 
equal justice for all. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4422 
September 6, 2022 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
TEXAS 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, here we 
are, back in the Nation’s Capital, after 
having had the opportunity to spend a 
few weeks back home. While it is still 
hot in Texas at this time of year—so it 
is nice to get a little bit of respite back 
here—we certainly have a lot of work 
cut out for us, but it is always helpful 
to me to sort of compare what people 
are focused on here in Washington, DC, 
with what folks back home care about 
the most. It is actually the best way to 
get some feedback on how we can do 
our jobs more effectively in rep-
resenting the people we represent—in 
my case, the 29 million people who call 
Texas home. 
Also, people are not shy about ex-
pressing their views on what we have 
done and even about offering some 
input on things we are considering 
doing. 
For 
example, 
in 
Corpus 
Christi, 
which is on the gulf coast of Texas, I 
spoke with industry at the Port of Cor-
pus Christi about the untapped poten-
tial of hydrogen energy. 
In Round Rock, which is just outside 
of Austin, I sat down with a number of 
sexual assault survivors, prosecutors, 
and medical professionals to talk about 
the need to train more sexual assault 
nurse examiners, which is a highly spe-
cialized form of nursing, to make sure 
that not only people who are sexually 
assaulted are compassionately cared 
for but also that the evidence that is 
necessary to convict their assailants is 
selected in a way that is admissible in 
court. 
In Austin, I met with the Texas Asso-
ciation of Counties. We have 254 coun-
ties in Texas. Some of them, like in 
Loving County, have more cattle than 
people. But it is great to meet or to be 
able to connect with all of the elected 
representatives at the local level of our 
counties in one place and to hear what 
is on their minds—certainly everything 
from broadband development/deploy-
ment, particularly in the rural parts of 
our State, and disaster relief for places 
like 
Dallas, 
which 
experienced 
13 
inches of rain in 1 day and massive 
flooding. 
In the Rio Grande Valley, close to 
the border, in Pharr, TX, I got a chance 
to see how their local police depart-
ment is partnering with local mental 
health providers to respond to individ-
uals who commit offenses—maybe be-
cause they are going through mental 
health crises—and how to train the of-
ficers to address those in a way that 
don’t escalate that crisis and poten-
tially cause harm to them as well as to 
the individual who is causing or is ex-
periencing that crisis. It really is im-
pressive to see a relatively small town 
like Pharr, TX, really leading the way 
when it comes to compassionate and ef-
fective policing and in providing our 
law enforcement officials, who are not 
necessarily 
trained 
mental 
health 
workers, the additional resources and 
training they need in order to respond 
effectively to those situations. 
Those are just a few examples of the 
sorts of folks I got to catch up with 
over the last few weeks, and I am obvi-
ously always grateful to those who 
share their input and ideas with me. 
Those conversations and that input are 
vital to our work here in the Senate 
because they shed light on the prob-
lems our neighbors in our communities 
are facing, which isn’t necessarily the 
coin of the realm here in Washington, 
DC, where politics and spin infuse ev-
erything. 
For example, folks almost univer-
sally—particularly 
small 
business 
folks—told me about the strain of the 
labor shortage on their businesses. If 
you go to a restaurant in Texas, it may 
be that they are only operating on 
fewer hours or fewer tables because 
they, frankly, can’t get the workforce 
they need to come back and help work 
at those places. 
They are obviously all very con-
cerned about the impact of the spend-
ing that we have been doing here in 
Washington, DC—some necessary and 
some unnecessary, in my opinion—and 
its impact on inflation and on family 
budgets, where they have seen their 
standard of living reduced because of 
the inflationary pressures on almost 
everything, from gasoline to groceries 
to housing—you name it. 
They are also very concerned about 
high energy prices. I know there has 
been some talk about the reduction in 
the price of gasoline. That is primarily 
a feature of reduced demand because, 
frankly, people have to make choices 
about how to spend the money they 
would ordinarily put in the tank and 
how to do it selectively—whether to go 
on a family vacation or to stay at 
home. It certainly hasn’t been because 
of any increase in supply as a result of 
our domestic energy policies by the 
Biden administration. 
Then I heard a lot about people’s con-
cerns about crime, particularly of the 
fentanyl crisis that we are experi-
encing here in America, where 108,000 
Americans died of drug overdoses last 
year alone. About 60 percent of those 
were 
from 
synthetic 
opioids—from 
fentanyl—the precursors of which usu-
ally come from Asia, mainly China, to 
Mexico and then across the southern 
border. 
Then, of course, there is the ongoing 
Biden border crisis as a result of the 
open border policies of the Biden ad-
ministration. There are 2.3 million mi-
grants who have been encountered 
along the border just since President 
Biden has taken office. Because of the 
catch-and-release policies associated 
with asylum seekers, even those people 
who ultimately will not be able to 
qualify for asylum, which is roughly 85 
to 90 percent of the people who claim 
it, will have melted into the great 
American landscape. They may be 
given a notice to appear for a future 
court hearing, but because of the back-
log of the immigration courts, we are 
talking years down the line. 
These are just some of the things 
that I am hearing about from my con-
stituents, and these are chronic prob-
lems for which, frankly, they do not 
see an appropriate and adequate re-
sponse coming from Washington to ad-
dress the very real impact on their ev-
eryday lives: what they can afford to 
buy at the grocery store; how safe their 
communities are; whether they feel 
safe while walking around their neigh-
borhoods or sending their children out 
to play; whether the family will travel 
to see relatives for the holidays or 
whether they will have to stay home in 
order to save money to put food on the 
table. Those are not the problems that 
our Democratic colleagues—or the ma-
jority here in the Senate—seem to be 
focused on like a laser. 
When I travel to Texas from Wash-
ington, it often feels like I am visiting 
a parallel universe. You get here, and 
things don’t seem that odd at first. The 
scenery is different, but the same prob-
lems Texans talk about are on display. 
You read headlines about the border 
crisis. You see that the Mayor of Wash-
ington, DC, is complaining and claim-
ing there is a humanitarian crisis be-
cause, although it claims to be a sanc-
tuary city, when Governor Abbott or 
Governor Ducey from Arizona provides 
transportation to these sanctuary cit-
ies, all of a sudden, the border crisis 
that we have been living with for a 
year and a half now seems very real. 
It is nice to see some folks in other 
parts of the country experiencing what 
my constituents in border communities 
have been experiencing for a long time 
now, together with the additional ex-
pense associated with things like de-
ploying the National Guard to back up 
the Border Patrol and Customs and 
Border Protection, all at Texas tax-
payer 
expense—something 
that 
is 
uniquely a Federal responsibility, but 
when the Biden administration refuses 
to do its job, it falls to the people who 
live in those communities along the 
border and in those States to try to do 
the best they can. 
Despite the fact that our Democratic 
colleagues are reading the same head-
lines about crime, drug overdoses, in-
flation, and the border and despite the 
headlines here reflecting those con-
cerns, our colleagues here in the Sen-
ate and in the White House have cho-
sen to ignore them pretty much alto-
gether. Our friends across the aisle 
have controlled the Senate now for a 
year and a half, as well as the House 
and the White House. They have the 
power to set any agenda that they see 
fit. They don’t have to ask our permis-
sion or for our consent, and they cer-
tainly have had every opportunity to 
do so. 
What I have noticed and what my 
constituents have commented on fre-
quently is this parallel universe in

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4423 
September 6, 2022 
Washington, DC, where the Democrats 
aren’t using the power they have to ad-
dress the problems working families 
are facing. They have chosen to focus 
on a completely different set of issues. 
For example, let’s look at the recent 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
bill. 
Our 
Democratic colleagues, although we 
have worked together constructively 
on bipartisan legislation, in this case 
decided to pass a partisan bill to spend 
$740 billion strictly along partisan 
lines. All of this money and the tax in-
creases that go along with it won’t ad-
dress the biggest problems families are 
facing anytime soon. In fact, they are 
likely to make the problems even 
worse. 
At a time when many people are 
struggling to pay for gasoline for their 
cars, our Democratic colleagues de-
cided to give well-to-do people who can 
afford $80,000 electric vehicles a tax-
payer handout of about $7,500 at the ex-
pense of the working families who 
can’t afford to buy an electric vehicle 
of their own at any price. 
This ensures that gas prices will 
climb even higher. This bill will revive 
the old Superfund tax on American en-
ergy production. It will guarantee fam-
ilies will face higher electricity prices 
this winter by slapping a new methane 
tax on energy producers. And that is 
all just the climate portion of the reck-
less tax-and-spending bill. 
Our colleagues decided that it was 
the smart thing to do to supersize the 
Internal Revenue Service and giving it 
even more manpower to invariably 
audit middle-class America and small 
businesses. And then they have doled 
massive handouts to some of their key 
constituencies like labor unions. 
They have chosen to impose socialist 
price controls on prescription drugs, 
which will stifle medical innovation 
and prevent new, lifesaving cures from 
being discovered. And perhaps worst of 
all, they raised taxes on the middle 
class. 
I know President Biden promised, 
and promised time and time again, to 
never raise taxes on anyone earning 
less than $400,000 a year, and our Demo-
cratic colleagues still claim that this 
bill makes good on that promise. But 
that is simply not consistent with the 
facts. It is not true. The nonpartisan 
Joint Committee on Taxation has con-
firmed it. 
The JCT found that taxpayers mak-
ing far less than $400,000 at some point 
get walloped by higher prices. That in-
cludes people making between $30,000 
and $40,000 a year. You can read it 
yourself, the distributional tables, at 
the Joint Committee on Taxation 
website. 
We know that inflation is outpacing 
wage growth, which means that work-
ers already are receiving a silent pay 
cut or silent tax, thanks to over-
spending here on things that, frankly, 
are not priorities. And many of those 
same workers are going to pay even 
more in Federal taxes. 
But perhaps the most insulting part 
of this reckless tax-and-spending bill 
that our Democratic colleagues decided 
to pass unilaterally was they chose to 
call it the Inflation Reduction Act. 
Leading economic experts say this bill 
won’t do a thing to address inflation, 
certainly, in the near term. In fact, 
over the next couple of years, they pre-
dict inflation is likely to get slightly 
worse. 
But that is how things work in this 
parallel 
universe 
known 
as 
Wash-
ington, DC: Democrats see that fami-
lies are being battered by inflation, but 
they don’t actually pass legislation 
that will help. Our colleagues just want 
to use the plight to come up with a 
sympathetic title for a radical, par-
tisan bill, and they are happy to stick 
middle-class 
Americans 
with 
the 
check. 
The icing on the cake came a couple 
of weeks ago after this bill became law, 
when President Biden made an Execu-
tive decision to cancel half a trillion 
dollars in student loans. Any family 
knows, you can’t just cancel debt. 
There is no magic wand that will make 
it disappear. Every dollar that was bor-
rowed will eventually have to be paid 
back by someone, but President Biden 
has just shifted the burden on whom 
that someone will be. Now the middle- 
class taxpayers are on the hook yet 
once again. 
Under President Biden’s proposal, it 
doesn’t matter if a person took out 
loans and repaid them already; in other 
words, did what they said they would 
do by repaying the money that they 
had borrowed. Whether they worked 
their way through school, whether they 
held two or three jobs, or chose not to 
attend college at all, their tax dollars 
will pay for someone else’s college 
debt. 
My point is there is a remarkable di-
vide between what Washington Demo-
crats are trying to accomplish and the 
problems middle-class families are ac-
tually facing. Families are struggling 
to put food on the table, and our Demo-
cratic colleagues are spending hun-
dreds of billions of dollars on climate 
initiatives. 
This reminds me of a few years ago, 
a social movement by the so-called 
Yellow Jackets—a mosaic of French 
working-class people who felt disen-
franchised from the urban elite who, as 
they said, ‘‘can focus on the end of the 
world, while we’re worrying about the 
end of the month.’’ That is what aver-
age working families in Texas and 
across 
the 
country 
are 
concerned 
about: How do we get to the end of the 
month with enough money to put food 
on the table and gas in the tank? 
Workers can’t afford a full tank of 
gas, and Democrats are forcing them to 
subsidize 
electric 
vehicles 
for 
the 
wealthy. People are worried about how 
much their electricity bills will cost 
this winter, and Democrats imposed a 
new tax that will send those costs even 
higher. These policies aren’t going to 
make life better for the middle class 
anytime soon. They aren’t going to 
help families or businesses that are 
trying to create jobs and opportunities 
for their communities. And it certainly 
isn’t going to bring our economy roar-
ing back to life. 
The fact of the matter is, since 
Democrats took control of the govern-
ment more than a year and a half ago, 
Texans’ lives have gotten harder, not 
easier. 
Inflation 
has 
skyrocketed, 
wages have fallen, our economy fell 
into a recession, and the border is on 
fire. And our colleagues—certainly, the 
Biden administration—don’t seem to 
care. In fact, they seem to block out 
the concerns of middle-class Americans 
so they can pursue an ideological agen-
da like there is no tomorrow. 
When I am home in Texas, folks talk 
about the problems workers and fami-
lies are facing every day. They don’t 
want to send taxpayer handouts to 
wealthy people buying electric vehicles 
or help subsidize labor unions or payoff 
someone else’s loans. The sooner our 
Democratic colleagues realize that, the 
better off we will all be. But then 
again, maybe it is going to take an 
election this November.

TRIBUTE TO CAROLINE CORNELL 
AND DANIEL PATRICK LOGAN 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to 
take a moment to highlight a truly feel 
good story straight out of my home 
State of Vermont, a story of how mid-
dle school friends and ski buddies from 
southern Vermont reconnected and fell 
in love after life took them mostly sep-
arate ways. 
Caroline Cornell and Daniel Patrick 
Logan grew up in southern Vermont 
and were close, but platonic, friends 
while attending middle school and Burr 
and Burton Academy in Manchester, 
VT. After graduation, they remained in 
contact, but traveled transiently and 
independently. Their individual jour-
neys took them across the world, from 
the Lost Coast of California to Thai-
land, Florida, and the Finger Lakes of 
New York. Their two separate, but 
eventually corresponding, life journeys 
involved 
transient 
living, 
Grateful 
Dead tribute bands, odd jobs, romance, 
heartbreak, and so much more. In ret-
rospect, it may have been inevitable 
that time would turn these two lifelong 
friends into companions. And finally, 
in June of this year, they became hus-
band and wife. 
Caroline and Daniel have traveled far 
and wide, but like so many others be-
fore them, their love for each other, 
and our small, beautiful State, has 
brought them home to Vermont, the 
same place where their friendship 
began almost 20 years ago. Caroline 
and Daniel’s story of music, travel, 
love, and fate was profiled in a July 1, 
2022, article published in the New York 
Times. I ask unanimous consent that

Grateful Dead Tribute Bands, a Ro-
mantic 
Turn’’ 
be 
printed 
in 
the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From The New York Times, July 1, 2022] 
WHILE FOLLOWING GRATEFUL DEAD TRIBUTE 
BANDS, A ROMANTIC TURN 
(By Nina Reyes) 
Caroline Cornell and Daniel Patrick Logan 
weren’t technically off the grid when they 
found romance on the Lost Coast of North-
ern California, the state’s most remote 
oceanfront area, in the summer of 2014. But 
the routes each had taken to get there could 
definitely be described as off the beaten 
path. 
The two first met in middle school in 
southern Vermont, and later attended the 
same high school, Burr and Burton Academy, 
in Manchester, Vt. As teenagers they ran in 
the same circle of friends, with whom they 
would ski and snowboard. 
Mr. Logan, 32, said that although there was 
never an acknowledged attraction between 
them back then, Ms. Cornell, 31, was a 
benchmark. ‘‘She was one of those people I 
would compare other girls to,’’ he said. ‘‘I 
would say, That girl’s no Caroline, but that’s 
OK.’’ 
Ms. Cornell saw Mr. Logan as her best 
friend. ‘‘He’s just really sweet and didn’t 
judge, always made you laugh,’’ she said. 
When he graduated from high school, in 
2007, Mr. Logan went to study massage in Ne-
vada City, Calif. Following her graduation, 
in 2008, Ms. Cornell and a group of their mu-
tual friends soon began traveling across the 
country to attend concerts by bands reimag-
ining the Grateful Dead. ‘‘That’s what I did 
instead of college,’’ Ms. Cornell said. Mr. 
Logan would often meet up with them at 
shows. 
Both spent the next 10 years living tran-
siently. When they weren’t traveling, Ms. 
Cornell worked as a bartender and at other 
odd jobs, sometimes staying with her parents 
and grandparents at their homes in Key 
West, Fla., while Mr. Logan worked at a 
marijuana farm in Honeydew, Calif., which is 
on the Lost Coast. He also continued to 
study massage, in Thailand and in the Fin-
ger Lakes region of New York. 
In July 2014, Ms. Cornell, who had re-
mained in regular contact with Mr. Logan, 
took a seasonal job at the farm where he was 
working. Both had recently become single, 
and they commiserated over the end of their 
relatively long relationships. One night, at 
the only bar in the town, they drank Don 
Julio 1942 tequila for almost 12 hours. Yet 
both remember what happened next with ab-
solute clarity. 
‘‘We had our first kiss in the parking lot, 
and we just let it happen,’’ Ms. Cornell said. 
‘‘I feel like I was already in love with him 
because he was my best friend.’’ 
Said Mr. Logan, ‘‘It wasn’t until I kissed 
her that I realized I was going to kiss her.’’ 
Though their relationship remained casual 
for a few months, each knew it was in a new 
phase. ‘‘There’s really no going back from 
this,’’ Mr. Logan recalled thinking. 
When her seasonal gig concluded that Sep-
tember, she left while he remained on the 
Lost Coast. ‘‘We talked almost every day on 
the phone, but I had to drive a four-wheeler 
to the top of the hill’’ to call her, he said. 
‘‘We were dating even if it wasn’t official,’’ 
Mr. Logan added. ‘‘We said, ‘It is what it is. 
We’re not going to ask questions.’ ’’ 
The following year, after spending time 
with Ms. Cornell at her family’s place in Key 
West, he actually did have a question. In 
March 2015, Mr. Logan called her and asked 
Ms. Cornell if she was going to be his 
girlfriend. 
Saying no, Ms. Cornell said, risked her los-
ing ‘‘the best guy forever.’’ So she said yes. 
‘‘But if I’m going to do this,’’ she recalled 
thinking, ‘‘I’m going to marry this guy.’’ Mr. 
Logan proposed on Valentine’s Day in 2021, 
while the two were again in Key West. By 
then they had already bought a property to-
gether 
and 
were 
building 
a 
home 
in 
Rawsonville, Vt., near where both had grown 
up. Ms. Cornell is now a floral designer in 
Manchester. Mr. Logan is a licensed massage 
therapist and also works at the Red Fox Inn, 
in Bondville, Vt., which his parents have 
owned and operated since 1984. 
On June 17, the couple were married at his 
parents’ inn before 300 guests. Kate Logan, 
the groom’s elder sister, officiated after re-
ceiving authorization from Vermont’s sec-
retary of state. 
The ceremony was part of a four-day cele-
bration, which included several events that 
together featured a lineup of no fewer than 
five bands. Those performances were an 
opening act of sorts for the groom and the 
bride, who took his surname. After the wed-
ding, they again hit the road for a month of 
following even more live music events.

RECOGNIZING THE 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE PROCTOR MAPLE 
RESEARCH CENTER 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would 
like to recognize the 75th anniversary 
of an integral Vermont institution, the 
Proctor Maple Research Center, which 
is 
housed 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Vermont. The Proctor Maple Research 
Center has been an international leader 
in the development of knowledge in 
maple production and in the sustain-
ability of the maple tree and the 
Northern Forest for the past 75 years. 
The practical and scholarly research 
conducted at the center has contrib-
uted to increased efficiency and sus-
tainability of maple production and to 
the well-being of maple trees and their 
habitat. In fact, the work of the Proc-
tor Maple Research Center has been es-
sential to the development of the en-
tire North American maple industry. 
In 1946, former Vermont Governor 
Mortimer Proctor purchased the Har-
vey Farm in Underhill to give to the 
University of Vermont as a site to con-
duct research on the extensive maple 
stand located there. In 1947, Dr. James 
Marvin and Dr. Fred Taylor opened the 
Proctor Maple Research Center, mark-
ing its first year of maple research and 
production. Today, it has close to 6,500 
taps for production, with research lo-
cated on 200 acres of land on the west-
ern side of Vermont’s Mount Mansfield, 
and new trees added each year for re-
search. 
Maple research has been a proud part 
of the University of Vermont’s history 
since the 1890s, and the establishment 
of the Proctor Maple Research Center 
has made UVM a leader in maple re-
search globally. The university has 
provided technical support, research- 
based data, and created new techniques 
and technology for maple producers 
across North America. Patented inven-
tions have increased maple yield, such 
as the 2009 check valve spout that near-
ly doubles production from each maple 
tree. 
Climate change has had a direct and 
visible impact on maple production, 
and the Proctor Maple Research Cen-
ter’s research on sap yield and sugar 
maple health in the face of differing 
tree nutrition levels and climate chal-
lenges has been crucial in under-
standing how climate change may be 
affecting maple tree health and sap 
production. 
Proctor Maple Research Center staff 
serve as advisers to maple producers on 
the Vermont Maple Sugar Makers As-
sociation, the North American Maple 
Syrup Council, and the International 
Maple Syrup Institute. The center has 
provided invaluable support to the 
maple industry, especially as it con-
fronts environmental challenges, ever- 
changing regulations, and diseases and 
pests of the sugar maple tree. 
Many Vermonters grow up sugaring, 
spending many a cold March evening in 
a sugarhouse tending sap as it boils 
into syrup. For generations, maple 
sugar production has played an impor-
tant role in our State’s agricultural 
economy. The Proctor Maple Research 
Center has provided the research, tech-
nical assistance, and the on-going sup-
port that has helped continue this be-
loved and important Vermont tradi-
tion. It is hard to imagine that 
Vermont would remain the top maple 
producer in the country without the 
Proctor Maple Research Center. 
I offer my sincere congratulations to 
the Proctor Maple Research Center and 
to Dr. Timothy Perkins, research pro-
fessor and director, his staff, and the 
many students who have worked there 
on its 75th anniversary. I look forward 
to their continued success in the field 
of sugar maple research and develop-
ment for years to come.

mated total cost is $1.95 billion. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. The strategic location of this political 
and economic power contributes signifi-
cantly to ensuring peace and economic sta-
bility in the region. It is vital to the U.S. na-
tional interest to assist our ally in devel-
oping and maintaining a strong and ready 
self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale will replace Australia’s 
current multi-role helicopter fleet with a 
more reliable and proven system that will 
allow Australia to maintain the appropriate 
level of readiness to conduct combined oper-
ations. The UH–60M Black Hawk helicopter 
will improve the Australian Army’s ability 
to deploy combat power to share Australia’s 
strategic environment, deter actions against 
its interests, and, when required, respond 
with credible force. Australia will have no 
difficulty absorbing this equipment into its 
armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin, Bethesda, MD. The purchaser typi-
cally requests offsets. There are no known 
offset agreements. Any future offset agree-
ment would be defined in negotiations be-
tween the purchaser and the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of no U.S. Govern-
ment and five (5) U.S. contractor representa-
tives in Australia for a period of three years. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–68 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, 
man 
portable, 
shoulder- 
launched, fire and forget, anti-tank system 
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. 
It may also be mounted on a variety of plat-
forms 
including 
vehicles, 
aircraft 
and 
watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds 
and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 
meters. The system is highly lethal against 
tanks and other systems with conventional 
and reactive armors. The system possesses a 
secondary capability against bunkers. 
2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use 
of fire-and-forget technology, which allows 
the gunner to fire and immediately relocate 
or take cover. Additional special features are 
the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an 
advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-
frared seeker, target lock-on before launch, 
and soft launch from enclosures or covered 
fighting positions. The Javelin missile also 
has a minimum smoke motor, thus decreas-
ing its detection on the battlefield. 
3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components, 
which are a reusable Command Launch Unit 
(CLU) and a round contained in a disposable 
launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates 
an integrated day-night sight that provides a 
target engagement capability in adverse 
weather and countermeasure environments. 
The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone 
mode for battlefield surveillance and target 
detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a sec-
ond generation Forward Looking Infrared 
(FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial loading 
and subsequent updating of software, all on- 
board missile software is uploaded via the 
CLU after mating and prior to launch. 
4. The missile is autonomously guided to 
the target using an imaging infrared seeker 
and adaptive correlation tracking algo-
rithms. This allows the gunner to take cover 
or reload and engage another target after fir-
ing a missile. The missile has an advanced 
tandem warhead and can be used in either 
the top attack or direct fire modes (for tar-
get undercover). An onboard flight computer 
guides the missile to the selected target. 
5. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
6. If a technologically advanced adversary 
obtains knowledge of the specific hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems that might reduce weap-
on system effectiveness or be used in the de-
velopment of a system with similar or ad-
vanced capabilities. 
7. A determination has been made that 
Brazil can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
8. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of 
Brazil.

mentation (including combat system capa-
bilities and limitations); training devices 
and services; technical support; and other re-
lated elements of logistical and program sup-
port. The estimated total cost was $1.7 bil-
lion. Major Defense Equipment (MDE) con-
stituted $0.7 billion of this total. 
This transmittal reports the addition of 
the following MDE items: four (4) shipsets of 
Global 
Positioning 
System 
Based 
Posi-
tioning, Navigation, and Timing Service

MDE items is $8 million, but will not cause 
an increase in the total estimated program 
cost. The total estimated case value will re-
main $1.7 billion with MDE remaining $0.7 
billion of this total. 
(iv) Significance: The proposed sale will 
improve the Government of Canada’s capa-
bility to meet current and future threats by 
incorporating a precise and robust Position, 
Navigation and Timing (PNT) system inte-
grated in the Aegis Combat System and cur-
rently fielding in the U.S. Navy. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives of the United States by help-
ing to improve the military capability of 
Canada, a NATO ally that is an important 
force for ensuring political stability and eco-
nomic progress, and a contributor to mili-
tary, peacekeeping and humanitarian oper-
ations around the world. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: Global Po-
sitioning System (GPS)-based Positioning, 
Navigation, and Timing Service (GPNTS) is 
the U.S. Navy’s next generation Positioning, 
Navigation and Timing (PNT) distribution 
system. GPNTS is an UNCLASSIFIED sys-
tem with a Selective Availability Anti- 
Spoofing Security Module (SAASM) GPS 
based security architecture. GPNTS supports 
mission critical real time PNT data services 
for weapons, combat, navigation, commu-
nications and other Command, Control, Com-
munications, Computers & Intelligence (C4I) 
systems. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is UNCLASSI-
FIED.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Morocco—Ground Command and Control 
The Government of Morocco has requested 
to buy six (6) Multifunctional Information 
Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio 
Systems (MIDS–JTRS). Also included are: 
KY–100M Narrowband/Wideband Terminals; 
KIV–78 and KIV–77 Cryptographic Appliques;

contractor engineering; technical and logis-
tics support services; and other related ele-
ments of logistical and program support. The 
estimated total cost is $141.1 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to improve the security of 
a Major Non-NATO Ally that continues to be 
an important force for political stability and 
economic progress in North Africa. 
The proposed sale will improve Morocco’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by providing timely Intelligence, 
Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) and 
target acquisition for its security and de-
fense. The capability is a deterrent to re-
gional threats and to strengthen its self-de-
fense. Morocco has demonstrated a commit-
ment to modernizing its military and will 
have no difficulty absorbing these articles 
into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractors will be General 
Atomic Aeronautical Systems Inc., San 
Diego, CA; Lockheed Martin Inc., Bethesda, 
MD; Raytheon Inc., Waltham, MA; and 
Leonardo SpA, Rome, Italy. The purchaser 
typically requests offsets. Any offset agree-
ment will be defined in negotiations between 
the purchaser and the contractor. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to Morocco. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

September 6, 2022 
This transmittal reports increases in MDE 
value by $147 million to $755 million and non- 
MDE value by $145 million to $545 million. 
This will result in an overall total case value 
increase of $292 million to $1.3 billion. 
(iv) Significance: Reassessment of recent 
market trends by the Original Equipment 
Manufacturer (OEM) has identified an in-
crease in cost of parts from suppliers, rang-
ing from 20% to 120% over the past 12 
months. Global supply chain logistics issues 
are impacting Long-lead items and increas-
ing volatility to pricing, as some sub-tier 
suppliers are refusing to bid and others are 
offering pricing that is only valid for very 
limited timeframes, resulting in the need to 
qualify new sources. The OEM has repriced 
the effort to account for these price in-
creases to add to the stability of this effort. 
There is no change to sensitive equipment or 
quantity/type of MDE previously notified. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale serves 
U.S. national, economic, and security inter-
ests by supporting the recipient’s continuing 
efforts to modernize its armed forces and to 
maintain a credible defensive capability. The 
proposed sale will help improve the security 
of the recipient and assist in maintaining po-
litical stability, military balance, and eco-
nomic progress in the region. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology statement contained in 
the original notification applies to items re-
ported here. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is CONFIDEN-
TIAL.

DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Pursuant to the re-
porting requirements of Section 36(b)(5)(C) of 
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), as 
amended, we are forwarding Transmittal No. 
20–0M. This notification relates to enhance-

TRANSMITTAL NO. 20–0M 
Report of Enhancement or Upgrade of Sensi-
tivity of Technology or Capability (Sec. 
36(b)(5)(C), AECA) 
(i) Purchaser: Government of the United 
Arab Emirates. 
(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 
15–51; Date: November 4, 2015; Military De-
partment: Air Force. 
(iii) Description: On November 4, 2015, Con-
gress was notified by Congressional certifi-
cation transmittal number 15–51, of the pos-
sible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms 
Export Control Act of three thousand two 
hundred and fifty (3,250) GBU–31V1 (KMU–556 
Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) kits); 
three thousand two hundred and fifty (3,250) 
MK–84/BLU–117 bombs; seven hundred and 
fifty (750) GBU–31V3 (KMU–557 JDAM kits); 
seven hundred and fifty (750) BLU–109 bombs; 
one thousand (1,000) GBU–12 Paveway II 
Laser Guided bomb kits; one thousand and 
two (1,002) MK–82/BLU–111 bombs; four thou-
sand two hundred and fifty (4,250) FMU–152 
fuzes; two hundred and sixteen (216) GBU–24 
tail kits (BSU–84); non-MDE related muni-
tions items (fuzes and bomb components), 
sustainment, and support. The estimated 
total cost was $380 million, including $365 
million in Major Defense Equipment (MDE). 
This transmittal reports the addition of 
eight hundred (800) GBU–56V1 Laser Joint Di-
rect Attack Munitions (LJDAM) (consisting 
of eight hundred (800) KMU–556 tail kits 
(MDE); eight hundred (800) DSU–40 Laser 
Sensors (SME); and eight hundred (800) Mk– 
84 bombs (MDE)); two hundred (200) GBU– 
56V3 Laser JDAMs (consisting of two hun-
dred (200) KMU–557 tail kits (MDE); two hun-
dred (200) DSU–42 Laser Sensors (SME); and 
two hundred (200) BLU–109 bombs (MDE)); 
three thousand (3,000) FMU–139 fuzes (MDE); 
and associated munitions support items. The 
total cost of the new MDE articles is $69 mil-
lion. Due to a reduction in other MDE items, 
the total MDE case value will remain $365 
million. The total estimated case value re-
mains $380 million. 
(iv) Significance: This notification is being 
provided to report the inclusion of MDE 
items not previously notified. The UAE re-
quested a reduction of Mk–84/BLU–117s and 
the addition of LJDAMs and fuzes so this 
proposed sale may include Mk–84/BLU–117s, 
LJDAMs, or a mix. The addition of the 
LJDAMs represents an increase in capability 
over what was previously notified. The pro-
posed sale increases UAE’s ability to achieve 
more exact targeting over a wide range of 
conditions and greater interoperability with 
the U.S. Air Force. 
(v) Justification: The proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives of the United States by help-
ing to improve the security of an important 
regional partner. The UAE continues to be a 
vital U.S. partner for political stability and 
economic progress in the Middle East. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The GBU–56 
Laser JDAM is a 2,000-pound JDAM with a 
DSU–40 or DSU–42 Laser Sensor. The LJDAM 
uses both Global Position System aided in-
ternal navigations and/or Laser guidance al-
lowing rapid prosecution of fixed targets. 
The Laser Sensor also provides the addi-
tional capability to engage mobile targets. 
The DSU–40 Laser Sensor is attached to the 
MK–84 or BLU–117 bomb body, and the DSU– 
42 Laser Sensor is attached to the BLU–109 
bomb body, which turns a standard GBU–31 
JDAM into a GBU–56 Laser JDAM. 
The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: 
August 25, 2022.

NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION 
DAY 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, as Ameri-
cans who value the freedoms protected 
by our country’s servicemembers, we 
must meet our responsibility to those 
who sacrificed so much for our coun-
try. To do this, we must continue to 
seek answers for families of America’s 
prisoners of war, POWs, and missing in 
action, MIA. 
In honor of the observation of Na-
tional POW/MIA Recognition Day this 
September 16, 2022, I join in raising 
awareness about the more than 81,500 
Americans the Defense POW/MIA Ac-
counting Agency, DPAA, reports re-
main 
missing 
from 
past 
conflicts. 
Thank you to the members of the 
POW*MIA Awareness Rally Corp. of 
Pocatello, ID, and others across our 
country for keeping a spotlight on the 
need to bring all missing American 
servicemembers home. 
Roughly 360 servicemembers from 
Idaho are among those who remain 
missing. The vast majority, 328, of Ida-
ho’s missing servicemembers were lost 
during their service in World War II, 
while 23 Idahoans were lost serving in 
the Korean War, and one Idahoan was 
lost during service in the Cold War. 
The remaining eight Idahoans went 
missing while serving in the Vietnam 
war. Some years ago, then-POW*MIA 
Awareness Corp. director Hiedi Young 
shared biographies she prepared of 
those eight Idahoans at a rally I at-
tended. The biographies are a thought-
ful reminder of the ongoing price of our 
freedom, and I share them here again 
today to highlight the ever-growing 
need to bring them and their fellow 
servicemembers home. It has now been 
more than 50 years since these Ida-
hoans were lost in service to our coun-
try. 
Lieutenant Roderick L. Mayer, United 
States Navy of Lewiston, has been missing 
since October 17, 1965, in North Vietnam. Lt. 
Mayer was a pilot of a fighter jet that was 
shot down. He and his co-pilot ejected from 
their aircraft. Based on testimony of his co- 
pilot, it is believed that he ‘‘died of severe

tive Finding of Death, Body Not Recovered.’’ 
Ensign 
Hal 
T. 
Hollingsworth, 
United 
States Navy of Grace, has been missing since 
January 16, 1966, in South Vietnam. Hollings-
worth was the co-pilot of an aircraft that 
while airborne had mechanical difficulties 
and crashed at sea. Status: ‘‘Killed in Ac-
tion, Body Not Recovered.’’ 
Staff Sargent William B. Hunt, United 
States Army of Sandpoint, has been missing 
since November 4, 1966, in South Vietnam. 
Hunt was lifted into battle to help evacuate 
wounded. He voluntarily left the aircraft to 
help reinforce remaining troops on the 
ground. The Viet Cong attacked the position 
the unit was maintaining and after 2 days of 
heavy fighting Hunt was gravely wounded. 
Status: ‘‘Presumptive Finding of Death, 
Body Not Recovered.’’ 
Captain 
Curtis 
R. 
Bohlscheid, 
United 
States Marine Corps of Pocatello, has been 
missing since June 11, 1967, in South Viet-
nam. Bohlscheid was the pilot of a helicopter 
which crashed into a steep ravine on a mis-
sion to insert a seven-man Marine Force 
Recon team on the battlefield. Status: 
‘‘Killed in Action, Body Not Recovered’’ 
First Lieutenant William E. Lemmons, 
United States Army of Pocatello, has been 
missing since June 18, 1967, in South Viet-
nam. Lemmons was aboard a helicopter on a 
visual recon mission. The helicopter was de-
clared missing and after extensive searches 
no trace of the aircraft or its crew was found. 
Status: ‘‘Missing in Action.’’ 
Captain Jon K. Bodahl, United States Air 
Force of Boise, has been missing since No-
vember 12, 1969, in Laos. Bodahl was the pilot 
of an aircraft on a recovery mission that was 
shot down. His aircraft was found during 
search and rescue operations, but there was 
no trace of him. Status: ‘‘Missing in Action.’’ 
Warrant Officer Jon M. Sparks, United 
States Army of Carey, has been missing 
since March 19, 1971, in Laos. Sparks was the 
co-pilot of a helicopter covering a downed 
helicopter during a rescue effort. The air-
craft was shot down and due to heavy fire a 
search and rescue mission could not be con-
ducted. It is unknown what his fate was. Sta-
tus: ‘‘Missing in Action’’ 
Captain Gregg N. Hollinger, United States 
Army of Paul, has been missing since Decem-
ber 14, 1971, in South Vietnam. Hollinger was 
on an administrative mission aboard an air-
craft that experienced an in-flight emer-
gency and lost contact with ground control. 
Extensive searches were conducted for the 
next three days, over water and the adjacent 
shore area, but no trace of the aircraft or 
personnel was ever found. It was later deter-
mined the aircraft was lost at sea and the 
crew and passengers died. Status: ‘‘Killed in 
Action, Body Not Recovered.’’ 
My prayers are with their families as 
the challenging work continues to get 
needed answers and bring our country’s 
servicemembers home. The POW/MIA 
Accounting community’s 2022 poster 
commemorating 
National 
POW/MIA 
Recognition 
Day 
simply 
states, 
‘‘THEIR Sacrifice/OUR Pledge.’’ Yes, 
America’s responsibility to our service-
members must be met. May presump-
tions be replaced with facts, as our 
country’s bravest are brought home to 
the families and communities who love 
them and long for their return.

ABSENCE EXPLANATION 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, I an-
nounce that my colleague from North 
Carolina, Senator RICHARD BURR, will 
be necessarily absent this week. He is 
at home in North Carolina recovering 
from hip replacement surgery. The pro-
cedure was successful, and he is doing 
well. He will be closely monitoring 
votes and looks forward to rejoining us 
here in the Senate next week.

INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in the 
face of the ever growing threat of cli-
mate chaos, it is vital for the future of 
our Nation and our planet that we 
move swiftly and boldly to transition 
from an energy economy that relies on 
carbon fossil fuels to one that is elec-
trified and powered by clean and re-
newable sources of energy. 
The Inflation Reduction Act makes 
historic investments in making that 
greener, cleaner future a reality. In-
cluded in those investments is the resi-
dential clean energy credit for battery 
storage technology. When we talk 
about transitioning to a greener econ-
omy, energy storage is critical. With 
this credit, homeowners can install en-
ergy storage capacity in two ways: by 
purchasing stand-alone batteries or by 
purchasing a bidirectional charger so 
the batteries in their electric vehicle 
can discharge to their home or the 
electric grid. Both will be ‘‘qualified 
battery storage technology expendi-
tures’’ under this legislation. 
Bidirectional charging is an exciting, 
groundbreaking new frontier for our 
vehicles and for our energy grid. I was 
excited, not too long ago, to see Ford’s 
new F–150 Lightning with my own eyes 
when one was parked outside the front 
of this Capitol. And it was impressive, 
and I think it could be a game changer. 
One of the features I loved most is 
that, in the event that a storm knocks 
out power to a house, the F–150 Light-
ning can be plugged in as a backup to 
keep the lights on. Not only is that 
convenient, it could be lifesaving. 
So I am very excited that this tax 
credit, which will be essential to the 
continued development and deploy-
ment of bidirectional battery storage 
technology, is included in the Inflation 
Reduction Act. And I look forward to 
supporting it in this bill and then 
building from it in the days to come. 
f 
VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, on 
August 2, 2022, I missed rollcall vote 
No. 280, the Honoring our PACT Act of 
2022. Had I been in attendance, I would 
have voted yea. 
Millions of American veterans whose 
time in the military spanned from 
Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan came 
home injured from toxic exposure to 
Agent Orange, burn pits, and more 
while serving our Nation with honor. 
They deserve not only our utmost re-
spect for their sacrifice, but also the 
ability to access their earned benefits 
without bureaucratic obstacles. For 
too long, these veterans were met with 
skepticism and denial about the con-
sequences of toxic exposure, despite 
mounting 
evidence 
of 
the 
serious 
health consequences that can stem 
from this exposure. No more. 
These generations of men and women 
stood up for us, now it is our duty to 
stand up for them. Ensuring that those 
exposed to these harmful and deadly 
toxins can get the care they need is the 
least that we can do for such heroes. 
Mr. President, on August 3, 2022, I 
missed rollcall vote No. 282, Treaty 
Doc. 117–3, Protocols to the North At-
lantic Treaty of 1949 on the Accession 
of the Republic of Finland and the 
Kingdom of Sweden. Had I been in at-
tendance, I would have voted yea. 
For over seven decades, the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization—NATO— 
has been the bedrock of security in Eu-
rope and helped preserve world order. 
Today, 
in 
the 
face 
of 
Russia’s 
unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, the 
importance of transatlantic strength 
and unity cannot be overstated. 
It is more important than ever that, 
as we remain committed to the pursuit 
of peace and prosperity in Europe, we 
work with our NATO allies to stand up 
to Vladimir Putin’s aggression and 
send a clear message to any who at-
tempt to follow his path that the free 
world will not stand idly by while its 
values and its sovereignty are at-
tacked. 
The addition of these two Nordic 
countries and European Union mem-
bers, Finland and Sweden, who have 
long acted in partnership with this alli-
ance, will serve to not only send that 
critical message, but will make NATO 
a stronger force for peace in the world. 
This is a historic day. And I gladly 
support and welcome the addition of 
these two important allies whose mili-
tary and diplomatic capabilities will 
help NATO better address urgent and 
emerging threats to European and 
global security. 
Mr. President, on August 4, 2022, I 
missed rollcall vote No. 283, a joint res-
olution of disapproval under the Con-
gressional Review Act. Had I been in 
attendance, I would have voted no be-
cause this resolution would undermine 
core provisions of the National Envi-
ronmental 
Policy 
Act—NEPA—that 
are critical for protecting our environ-
ment, our water and air, endangered 
species and their habitats, and the 
well-being of the American people. 
The purpose of NEPA is to ensure 
that the Federal Government fully 
thinks through and considers all of the 
impacts 
of 
infrastructure 
projects, 
both the direct and indirect cumulative 
impact of a projects. In the fight 
against climate chaos, NEPA is a crit-
ical tool for ensuring that our govern-
ment considers all of the ways that a 
project might add to or mitigate the 
climate crisis, and then empower agen-
cies to analyze reasonable alternatives 
that are less harmful to our natural en-
vironment. 
As part of its relentless campaign to 
undermine the fight against climate 
chaos, the last administration went to

great lengths to weaken NEPA’s abil-
ity to protect our environment and se-
verely limited the ability of agencies 
to seek out less harmful alternatives. 
The previous administration also di-
rected that the indirect and cumu-
lative impacts of Federal projects no 
longer needed to be considered. As stat-
ed in a letter sent to the Senate by a 
group of 200 organizations representing 
millions of members and supporters, 
these changes were a blatant effort ‘‘to

projects, and systematically disenfran-
chise low-income, rural, and minority 
communities from government deci-
sion-making.’’ 
Since coming into office, President 
Biden has worked to restore NEPA’s 
core provisions, reduce litigation risk, 
and help deliver more sustainable and 
equitable projects. The ‘‘Phase 1’’ rule-
making that this CRA attacks, is es-
sential to addressing the climate crisis 
and ensuring environmental justice for 
communities that disproportionately 
bear its brunt. If this joint resolution 
were to pass, it would not only under-
mine our agencies’ ability to mitigate 
climate change or make decisions that 
ensure a project is more resilient to 
the foreseeable effects of a changing 
climate, it would also potentially stop 
any future administration from using 
NEPA to address the climate impacts 
of Federal decisions. That would be dis-
astrous for our environment, for our 
country, and for the American people. 
Therefore, as previously stated, for 
the well-being of our planet and of fu-
ture generations, had I been present, I 
would have strongly opposed this effort 
to weaken the National Environmental 
Policy Act and voted no on this joint 
resolution. 
Mr. President, on August 4, 2022, I 
missed rollcall vote No. 284, confirma-
tion of Executive Calendar No. 1100, 
Roopali H. Desai, of Arizona, to be U.S. 
Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit. 
Had I been in attendance, I would have 
voted yea.

HONORING KENTUCKY LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, when po-
lice officers raise their hands and take 
an oath to serve and protect, they un-
derstand the risks that come with that 
promise. Floyd County Sheriff’s Dep-
uty William Petry, Prestonsburg Po-
lice 
Department 
Captain 
Ralph 
Frasure, Prestonsburg Police Patrol-
man Jacob Chaffins, and Floyd County 
Canine Unit Drago gave the ultimate 
sacrifice for their communities and the 
Commonwealth of Kentucky. Floyd 
County 
Sheriff’s 
Deputy 
Darrin 
Lawson, Constable Gary Wolfe, and 
Floyd County Emergency Management 
Director 
Joe 
Reynolds 
were 
also 
wounded during the incident. 
Floyd County law enforcement offi-
cials were serving an emergency pro-
tective order to Lance Storz, of Allen, 
KY, when they were attacked. The 
standoff began as officers approached 
Mr. Storz’s home using a one lane road. 
Mr. Storz then opened fire on the offi-
cers from an elevated position. Despite 
their vulnerable position, the officers 
valiantly engaged Mr. Storz for well 
over 3 hours. Finally, at 10 p.m., Mr. 
Storz surrendered to officers and was 
taken into custody. 
We honor these officers, who sac-
rificed to keep our communities safe. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with the 
families of our three fallen officers, the 
families of the wounded officers, and 
the Allen, Prestonsburg, and Floyd 
County residents affected by this trag-
edy. 
I 
salute 
Deputy 
Petry, 
Captain 
Frasure, Patrolman Chaffins, Drago, 
and the great law enforcement men and 
women of the Commonwealth of Ken-
tucky.

TRIBUTE TO BRAD AND JAN 
CUNDY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in celebration of Brad and Jan 
Cundy, the Boys and Girls Clubs of 
Central Wyoming’s 2022 honorees. 
The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central 
Wyoming was established in 1969 to 
create a youth-friendly organization 
promoting 
character 
development 
among young boys. Today, it is so 
much more. Both boys and girls now 
develop character and leadership skills, 
athletic abilities, and a healthy life-
style. They are encouraged to expand 
their educational aspirations through 
their local Boys and Girls Club. 
The mission of the club is to ‘‘inspire 
all youth, especially those who need us 
most, to reach their full potential as 
productive, 
responsible, 
and 
caring 
citizens.’’ This organization would not 
be possible without the thousands of 
adult mentors and volunteers who dedi-
cate their time, setting exceptional ex-
amples for youth every day. Each year, 
the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central 
Wyoming honors one or more individ-
uals for their continued support and 
mentorship of Wyoming’s youth. 
On the morning of September 14, the 
Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyo-
ming will host their 24th Annual 
Awards and Recognition Breakfast in 
Casper. They will honor Brad and Jan 
Cundy for their tireless dedication to 
the youth of central Wyoming. Brad 
and Jan’s exemplary character and 
commitment to Wyoming’s youth are 
remarkable. With this award, the Boys 
and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming af-
firms their deepest gratitude for Brad 
and Jan Cundy and their continued 
work. 
Born and raised in Wyoming, Brad 
and Jan established deep Wyoming 
roots with their educational achieve-
ments at Casper College, business pur-
suits in Gillette and Casper, and chari-
table statewide outreach. Brad and Jan 
raised three children in Wyoming, 
Chad, Matthew, and Dawn, and cur-
rently 
have 
five 
grandchildren, 
Braedyn, Blaine, Evelyn, Taylee, and 
Treyson. 
Brad and Jan’s first business, Cundy 
Asphalt Paving Construction, Inc., es-
tablished in 1980, served the Gillette 
community for 21 years. Brad and Jan 
did not stop there. In 2002, they em-
barked on a new business adventure in 
Casper. They started Keyhole Tech-
nologies, Inc., a traffic control com-
pany still operating today. 
Along with their successful business 
ventures, Brad and Jan engage in vol-
unteer work. Jan serves on the board of 
directors for the Boys and Girls Clubs 
of Central Wyoming. In this role, she 
secures funding for youth programs, 
helping create new opportunities for 
youth to develop and enhance their 
skills. 
Brad is a member of the Rotary Club 
of Casper, building mutually beneficial 
relationships on behalf of the commu-
nity. He also dedicates his time to the 
Boys and Girls Club as a youth mentor. 
In 2011, their son, Matthew, took his 
own life. In response, their daughter, 
Dawn, created the Mattie Project, a 
nonprofit organization focused on sui-
cide prevention for young teens and 
adults. Brad and Jan helped initiate 
the Wyoming Chapter for the American 
Foundation for Suicide Prevention. 
The Cundy family remains dedicated to 
Wyoming’s focus on mental health. 
They wish to honor Matthew and to 
prevent future deaths. 
Brad and Jan received multiple acco-
lades in response to their resolute dedi-
cation to their businesses, community, 
and family. Jan was nominated for the 
2020 Wyoming Woman of Influence. 
Both Brad and Jan received the Mick 
and Susie McMurry Cowboy Try Award 
in 2021. They embody the Cowboy Code 
to the fullest. 
On September 14, Brad and Jan 
Cundy will be recognized as the Boys 
and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming’s 
2022 honorees. They are an inspiration 
to the people of Wyoming. 
It is with great honor that I recog-
nize and celebrate this remarkable cou-
ple. They are the epitome of the cow-
boy spirit and are notable pillars of our 
community. They represent the best of 
Wyoming. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in 
extending our congratulations to Brad 
and Jan Cundy upon their selection for 
this special award.

TRIBUTE TO BRAD HOPKINS 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in recognition of Brad Hopkins, 
recipient of the 2022 Mick and Susie 
McMurry Cowboy Code Try Award. 
Brad will receive the award in front 
of over a thousand attendees at the 
Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyo-
ming’s 24th Annual Awards and Rec-
ognition Breakfast in Casper. 
The Try Award recognizes people in 
our community who live the Cowboy 
Code to its fullest. ‘‘The Try’’ is de-
scribed as ‘‘that special characteristic 
which contributes to success in life— 
along with perseverance, hard work, 
and loyalty. It’s that quality within

oneself that allows a person to over-
come obstacles with courage and tenac-
ity.’’ It is a remarkable distinction. 
Each year, a bronze sculpture crafted 
by acclaimed artist Chris Navarro is 
given to the Try Award honoree. The 
sculpture is titled ‘‘Cowboy Code’’ and 
depicts a cowboy on his horse, with the 
phrases, ‘‘Always Finish What You 
Start’’ and ‘‘Protect and Help The 
Weak’’. 
Brad Hopkins has served as executive 
director of the Wyoming Rescue Mis-
sion since 2012. Born in Dallas, TX, 
Brad is an ordained minister and 
earned his master of theology from the 
Dallas Theological Seminary. He com-
pleted postgraduate studies at the Uni-
versity of Wisconsin and the University 
of Colorado-Denver. 
While in Colorado, Brad was a con-
tributor to Denver’s Road Home, the 
Denver Commission to End Homeless-
ness, and the Denver Mayor’s Clergy 
Council. He served as an advisor to the 
Colorado Governor’s Interagency Coun-
cil on Homelessness. 
Brad was a founding board member of 
the Wyoming Governor’s Homeless Col-
laborative. He is also a member of the 
Casper Homeless Collaborative and a 
board member for the Emergency Food 
and Shelter Program. 
Brad’s 
spiritual 
leadership 
is 
as 
strong as his organizational leadership. 
Under his direction, the Wyoming Res-
cue Mission raised funds to triple their 
space to allow adequate housing for 
their guests. Brad and the mission 
oversee the restoration work of 2,500 
homeless 
individuals 
and 
families. 
They serve 70,000 hot meals and 42,000 
nights of stay each year. Under Brad’s 
leadership, the mission opened two 
thrift stores, which provide revenue 
and job placement opportunities for 
their guests. 
Participants in their Discipleship Re-
covery Program progress through a 
yearlong, Bible-based, addiction recov-
ery model. This program offers them 
an opportunity to transition to inde-
pendent living as healthy, productive 
men and women. Their program ad-
vancement and graduation ceremonies 
are an inspirational experience. 
Brad’s passion and compassion for 
those less fortunate comes from a 
shared experience with vulnerability. 
He described an early failed career 
move that left him and his wife home-
less for a time. Consistently an exam-
ple of the ‘‘Try’’ mentality, he con-
tinues to give his time and talents to 
help others. He and his wife Christine 
have been married for 29 years. They 
have lived in Casper since 2012. 
Brad, like the Try Award’s name-
sakes Mick and Susie McMurry, epito-
mizes the Code of the West. The Cow-
boy Code teaches us to live each day 
with courage and to take pride in our 
work. Brad’s dedication and spiritual 
guidance empower others to find their 
own courage, leading them to a more 
fulfilled and productive life. Casper and 
Wyoming are fortunate to have him as 
a member of our community. 
It is with great honor that I recog-
nize this outstanding member of our 
Wyoming family. My wife, Bobbi, joins 
me in extending our congratulations to 
Brad Hopkins upon his selection for 
this special award.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO GEORGE C. EDWARDS 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate my dear friend 
State Senator George C. Edwards, who 
is retiring from the Maryland General 
Assembly at the end of this year, and 
to thank him for a half-century of prin-
cipled and productive public service to 
the people of Maryland, especially his 
constituents in what we call Mountain 
Maryland: 
Garrett, 
Allegany, 
and 
Washington Counties. 
George was born in Grantsville, MD, 
and graduated from Northern Garrett 
High School in Accident, MD. He re-
ceived his bachelor of science in busi-
ness administration, cum laude, from 
Fairmont State College in West Vir-
ginia in 1970. He was the starting full-
back on the football team there and 
earned National Association of Inter-
collegiate Athletics All-American hon-
ors. Despite playing at a small school, 
he was good enough that the Baltimore 
Colts drafted him. George wanted to be 
a teacher, however, and later attended 
what was then Frostburg State College 
to receive his teacher’s certificate so 
he could teach social studies at his old 
high school. 
I met George when he won his first 
election to the Maryland House of Del-
egates in 1982, where I was serving as 
speaker of the house. Even though he 
was only 33, he was already a seasoned 
elected official with a decade of experi-
ence on the Grantsville Town Council 
and the Garrett County Board of Coun-
ty Commissioners. He also served in 
the National Guard for 6 years after he 
graduated from college, 
George served with distinction in the 
house of delegates for 24 years, fin-
ishing his tenure there as minority 
leader from 2003 to 2007, when he won 
election to the State senate, where he 
has served for the past 16 years. George 
won 4 of his 10 elections to the general 
assembly with 100 percent of the vote 
and another 3 with 98 percent or more 
of the vote. He and Delegate Sandy 
Rosenberg are the deans of the Mary-
land General Assembly; each of them 
started their service in 1983. 
George delivered a farewell address 
to the State senate that reflects the 
type of person he is, a statement filled 
with self-deprecating wit, congeniality, 
and a gentleness too rare in politics. 
He said that his first task in Annapolis 
was to educate his fellow lawmakers 
that Allegany County isn’t spelled with 
an H, that Maryland’s longest border is 
with West Virginia, and that western 
Marylanders speak in a particularly 
folksy way. ‘‘You speak slow and you 
m-m-m mumble a little bit,’’ he said. 
He also noted that when he joined the 
general assembly, there were only 13 
Republicans serving in the house of 
delegates and 7 in the State senate. ‘‘I 
can count,’’ he said he remembered 
thinking. ‘‘I said, hmm, I need to make 
some friends. And I need to make some 
friends on [the Democratic] side of the 
aisle. And I think I’ve done that.’’ 
George certainly has made friends on 
the Democratic side of the aisle, and I 
am proud to be one of them. 
In an op-ed in the New York Times 
several years ago, Michael Ignatieff 
wrote: 
For democracies to work, politicians need 
to respect the difference between an enemy 
and an adversary. 
An adversary is someone you want to de-
feat. An enemy is someone you have to de-
stroy. With adversaries, compromise is hon-
orable: Today’s adversary could be tomor-
row’s ally. With enemies, on the other hand, 
compromise is appeasement. 
Between adversaries, trust is possible. 
They will beat you if they can, but they will 
accept the verdict of a fair fight. This, and a 
willingness to play by the rules, is what 
good-faith democracy demands. 
George understands this crucial dis-
tinction between adversary and enemy 
and has acted according to this prin-
ciple throughout his entire career, 
which is why even his adversaries are 
his friends. It is why he has served as 
cochair of the general assembly’s joint 
committee on legislative ethics, mak-
ing him the only Republican in leader-
ship in the legislature. It is why he has 
been such an effective representative 
for his constituents in western Mary-
land. It has been a challenge because, 
as George has noted, ‘‘A lot of people 
where I live don’t think people in other 
parts of Maryland think we’re in Mary-
land.’’ 
As 
Maryland 
State 
Senate 
President Bill Ferguson said, George 
has ‘‘made sure every senator under-
stood the needs of his district and al-
ways approached negotiations from a 
standpoint of getting to a resolution, 
not to obstruct.’’ Senate Majority 
Leader Nancy J. King, a former chair 
of the budget and taxation committee, 
summed it up when she said, ‘‘You 
can’t say no to George because he’s 
such a nice guy.’’ 
In 1946, Brooklyn Dodgers manager 
Leo Durocher famously quipped, ‘‘Nice 
guys finish last.’’ Durocher never met 
George, who has always come in first 
by putting his constituents first. Being 
nice is not the same as being obse-
quious. George is a true conservative, a 
rarity in today’s politics. He and I have 
different points of view on some major 
issues like gun safety and government 
regulation, but that has never stopped 
us from working as a team on behalf of 
his and my constituents. 
We have worked together to support 
and expand Federal-State partnerships 
such as the Appalachian Regional Com-
mission, the Economic Development 
Administration, Community Develop-
ment Block Grants, and the Depart-
ment of Agriculture’s Rural Develop-
ment Program. We have worked to-
gether to secure funding from Mary-
land and Pennsylvania and the Federal

Government to complete the North- 
South Appalachian Highway initiative 
connecting I–68 to the Pennsylvania 
Turnpike via US–219. We have worked 
together to expand rural healthcare ac-
cess and opportunities through feder-
ally qualified community health cen-
ters, regional hospitals, and other Fed-
eral partnerships in the region. We 
have worked together to support high-
er education and workforce develop-
ment 
programs 
through 
Frostburg 
State University, the Western Mary-
land Consortium, and the region’s 
three community colleges. 
We have collaborated to provide 
State and Federal grant training for 
local emergency management and first 
responders to ensure they have the re-
sources they need to protect their com-
munities. We have collaborated to en-
sure that small businesses have access 
to State and Federal resources to grow 
their businesses. We have collaborated 
on casework for our constituents with 
State and Federal agencies related to 
healthcare, veterans’ benefits, housing, 
banking and taxes, passports, and 
other issues. 
George’s legislative accomplishments 
are too numerous to list, so I will men-
tion just a few. He fought to alter a 
State revenue formula to provide addi-
tional funding to counties, such as Gar-
rett and Allegany, where the State 
owns 15 percent or more of the land. He 
secured changes to Maryland’s Pro-
gram Open Space, a land acquisition 
and recreation program, to give Gar-
rett and Allegany Counties the flexi-
bility they need to use the program 
without impeding economic develop-
ment. He increased Allegany County’s 
share of revenue from the Rocky Gap 
Casino Resort and increased the coun-
ty’s flexibility with respect to how it 
can spend that revenue. He succeeded 
in increasing the speed limit on parts 
of I–68 to 70 miles per hour, which is 
understandable considering that his 
Senate district—district 1—stretches 
125 miles from Red House at the far 
western end of the State to Williams-
port in Washington County. Earlier 
this year, Governor Hogan signed into 
law a bill George sponsored to establish 
the Western Maryland Economic Fu-
ture Investment Board and Senator 
George C. Edwards Fund to provide $50 
million over the next 3 years in State 
grants and loans for capital infrastruc-
ture and business development projects 
in the region. Of course, George is far 
too modest to suggest naming some-
thing after himself; his colleagues 
voted unanimously to amend the bill to 
be named in his honor. 
When George announced his retire-
ment, he noted that he had spent the 
equivalent of 10 years in Annapolis, 
away from his family. So I would be re-
miss if I failed to mention Linda, his 
beloved wife of 55 years, and their two 
children, Kristin and Paul. Paul has 
followed in his father’s footsteps and 
serves as chair of the Garrett County 
Board of County Commissioners. All 
Marylanders, but especially his district 
1 constituents, owe a debt of gratitude 
to his family for sharing him with the 
public. He and Linda are the proud 
grandparents of eight children, and I 
certainly understand his desire, after 
half a century of public service, to 
spend more time with his family. 
In 
Shakespeare’s 
play 
‘‘Hamlet,’’ 
Polonius counsels his son Laertes, 
‘‘This above all: to thine own self be 
true, And it must follow, as the night 
the day, Thou canst not then be false 
to any man.’’ This describes George 
Edwards and his life of public service. 
He has been true to himself and never 
false to his colleagues or to his con-
stituents. I am honored to count 
George as a friend and want, on behalf 
of the entire U.S. Senate, to extend my 
congratulations and deepest apprecia-
tion to him and wish him and Linda 
and their family all the best as he re-
turns home to Mountain Maryland.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DEBORAH CROSS 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Deborah Cross of 
Manchester as July’s Granite Stater of 
the Month. After surviving stage 4 can-
cer, Deborah used her artistic talents 
to create photo journals to help other 
cancer patients process their emotions 
and find resilience. 
After recovering from endometrial 
cancer in 2014 and living cancer-free for 
almost 4 years, Deborah received awful 
news from her doctor. Her cancer had 
come back. While Deborah was dev-
astated by the news, she also found sol-
ace in a creative outlet that would also 
help others. 
Deborah 
began 
creating 
booklets 
with strikingly edited photos of nature 
in New Hampshire, for example, images 
of seagulls and ocean sunsets around 
the New England coast. Below the 
photos are blank lines where cancer pa-
tients can journal. Deborah hopes that 
the photos can evoke deeper emotions 
that patients might be struggling with 
in a time of intense personal hardship. 
In addition, some of the proceeds from 
the sales go to the North of Boston 
Cancer Resource. 
Deborah 
exemplifies 
the 
Granite 
State spirit of giving back to others 
and bringing people together even dur-
ing challenging times. She took an im-
mensely difficult experience—battling 
with stage 4 cancer—and found her way 
through it by creating art that would 
touch others. I commend her for her 
work and know that her story will in-
spire others to make a difference in 
their communities.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO EVAN CROTTY 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
honored to recognize Evan Crotty of 
Wilton as August’s Granite Stater of 
the Month. Twelve-year-old Evan is 
cleaning up every street in his town 
over the next year, and the money he is 
raising through the initiative will go 
to his middle school’s music depart-
ment. 
When it came time for Evan to 
choose a bar mitzvah project, he knew 
he wanted to start a community clean-
up because of his deep appreciation of 
nature. Last summer as a Boy Scout, 
Evan hiked 75 miles and learned about 
how to preserve nature, leaving no 
trace behind on trails. In addition, 
Evan had done many community clean-
ups before with his family, and he was 
excited to expand those efforts into a 
yearlong project. 
Teaming up with a community clean-
up expert, Evan launched his project, 
beginning the process of going street 
by street in Wilton and removing the 
plastic bags, cans, and trash that litter 
the area. Already a couple of weeks 
into the project, Evan has felt the sup-
port from neighbors passing by who 
have given him a supportive honk from 
their cars or thanked him for his work. 
As part of the project, Evan is also 
fundraising online and donating the 
proceeds to his middle school’s music 
department. After performing in Wil-
ton-Lyndeborough Cooperative Middle 
High School’s production of ‘‘Matilda,’’ 
Evan knew he wanted to support his 
theater department so that other stu-
dents could have the positive experi-
ence that he had by participating in a 
show. 
Evan hopes that when neighbors 
drive by and see him removing trash 
and other litter, they will be inspired 
to also care for the natural spaces 
around them. In addition, it is a testa-
ment to Evan’s passionate spirit that 
he is also fundraising for the arts 
through his cleanup project. I am 
grateful to Evan for his work and for 
inspiring Granite Staters to each take 
steps to better their own communities. 
He represents the very best of our 
Granite State spirit, taking the initia-
tive to make a difference.∑

150TH BIRTHDAY OF HUTCHINSON, 
KANSAS 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
rise today to celebrate the 150th birth-
day of the city of Hutchinson, KS. 
In 1871, Clinton Carter ‘‘CC’’ Hutch-
inson got the Atchison Topeka and 
Santa Fe Railroad to route through 
what is now Reno County and Hutch-
inson, KS. Upon the arrival of the rail-
road, Hutchinson was incorporated as a 
city in August 1872. At first, the city 
was a rail town, using the railroads to 
help advance the local area’s ranching 
and farming operations. Upon the dis-
covery of salt, Hutchinson developed 
into a mining town as well, quickly 
earning the moniker of the ‘‘Salt 
City.’’ 
Since its incorporation 150 years ago, 
Hutchinson has grown into an indus-
trial hub for central Kansas. From 
Carey Salt and the Cosmosphere, to 
Dillons Grocery and the State fair, 
Hutchinson and its citizens play an in-
tegral role in telling the story of Kan-
sas. Thanks to investments of both 
time and money by community mem-
bers, Hutchinson remains a vibrant

RECOGNIZING THE CLASS OF 2022 
GRADUATES 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES MILITARY ACADEMY 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the class of 2022 
graduates from the U.S. Military Acad-
emy at West Point and the 23 exem-
plary graduates from the State of 
Michigan. 
From plebes to firsties, and now sec-
ond lieutenants in the U.S. Army, the 
class of 2022 has come through one of 
the most challenging and rewarding ex-
periences of their lives to join ‘‘The 
Long Gray Line.’’ The class motto, 
‘‘For Many, Stand the Few,’’ reflects 
the class of 2022’s commitment and 
moral, mental, and physical strength 
necessary to graduate from West Point

TRIBUTE TO MATTHEW E. 
MCLOGAN 
∑ Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in celebration of the retirement 
of Mr. Matthew E. McLogan, former 
vice president for university relations 
and secretary of the board of trustees 
at Grand Valley State University in 
Allendale, MI. 
Matt McLogan began his 35-year ten-
ure at the university by serving as vice 
president beginning in September 1987. 
His extensive knowledge of government 
relations and leadership of GVSU’s 
marketing and communications units, 
WGVU television, and radio furthered 
the success of GVSU. 
Matt has been instrumental in grow-
ing GVSU from an institution of fewer 
than 9,000 students to a regional force 
with approximately 22,000 students. He 
often worked behind the scenes devel-
oping and securing opportunities for 
students to improve their chances of 
success. In addition, he has worked re-
lentlessly to establish a stronger west 
Michigan, including securing GVSU’s 
place on the Medical Mile in downtown 
Grand Rapids and pushing key initia-
tives with State and congressional law-
makers. 
In 1981, he was appointed public serv-
ice commissioner for the State of 
Michigan, serving 6 years in this role 
regulating the State’s investor-owned 
electric, gas, telephone, and water util-
ities. He was also on the faculty of the 
annual National Association of Regu-
latory Studies Program at Michigan 
State University, from 1983–1987. 
In 1991, Matt was appointed by the 
Federal judiciary of the Western Dis-
trict of Michigan to the Civil Justice 
Advisory Committee. This committee 
was charged by Congress to develop 
new guidelines to speed the disposition 
of civil court proceedings. In 1992, he 
was 
appointed 
by 
Governor 
John 
Engler to the Utility Consumer Par-
ticipation Board, which oversees the 
representation of residential customer 
interests before the Public Service 
Commission. In 1993, he became board 
chairman. 
In 1993, Governor Engler appointed 
Mr. McLogan as a special mediator in 
the Ameritech excess earnings case; 
the agreement stemming from the me-
diation was ratified by the Public Serv-
ice Commissioner and led to the cre-
ation of a special fund to support edu-
cational distance learning projects. In 
1996, he was appointed by the Governor 
to a 4-year term on the State Officers 
Compensation Commission, a public 
body that sets salary levels for Michi-
gan’s elected State officials; he became 
chairman in 1998. Mr. McLogan also 
serves on the Board of the West Michi-
gan Botanical Garden (Frederik Meijer 
Gardens). 
Matthew E. McLogan holds a BA and 
MA degrees from Western Michigan 
University. He is a Michigan native, 
born in Flint in 1948. Matt is married 
to Jane L. Brierley, and both are the 
parents of three children: Katherine, 
born 1985; Molly, born 1988; and Tim-
othy born 1992. 
It is my honor to recognize the pro-
found impact and accomplishments Mr. 
Matt McLogan has made on Grand Val-
ley State University and within the 
broader Michigan community over the 
last 42 years.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO GRADY JUDD 
∑ Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I recog-
nize Grady Judd as he celebrates 50 
years of service with the Pasco County 
Sheriff’s Office. Grady has served as 
sheriff since 2004, where he is a con-
stant and protective presence in the 
community. 
Sheriff Grady joined the Polk County 
Sheriff’s Office in 1972 as a dispatch of-
ficer and rose through the depart-
ment’s ranks. At the age of 19, he was 
the youngest deputy sworn in and 
eventually served as a sergeant, colo-
nel, and chief of staff for his prede-
cessor before becoming sheriff. 
Devoted to helping others through-
out the county, at 16, he managed to 
convince the Polk County Ambulance 
Service to hire him despite being 2 
years away from the required age of 18. 
Grady has always sought to help others 
throughout his community, dedicating 
his time and talents to making a dif-
ference in their lives. 
After becoming sheriff, Grady re-
worked how the department interacts 
with the local media. The sherriff’s of-
fice seeks to provide the public with 
up-to-date information regarding in-
vestigations as quickly as possible, and 
often, Grady will issue warnings aimed 
at suspects that have since become 
well-known throughout Florida. 
Grady was born in Lakeland, FL, 
graduating from Lakeland High School 
before attending Polk Community Col-
lege and Rollins College, where he 
earned his bachelor of arts and mas-
ter’s degrees in criminal justice. He is 
an adjunct professor at the University 
of South Florida and Florida Southern 
College, offering students first-hand 
knowledge of law enforcement. 
Grady’s work and commitment has 
made a real difference in the lives of 
the people of Polk County. I am grate-
ful for his decades of service and extend 
my best wishes to his wife, Marisa, his 
two adult children, and his 13 grand-
children on this momentous mile-
stone.∑

50TH ANNIVERSARY OF PROJECT 
ZAP 
∑ Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise today to honor the 50th anniver-
sary of Project ZAP, or ZAP the Black-
stone. 
The Blackstone River was once called 
‘‘the hardest-working river in Amer-
ica.’’ In the mid-1800s, more than a 
hundred textile mills and manufactur-
ers busily operated along the Black-
stone’s banks and tributaries, where a 
steady flow of water provided reliable 
hydroelectric power. Development and 
industrialization carried on for dec-
ades, with lasting consequences for the 
health of the river, long after the mills 
closed up or moved elsewhere. The 
Blackstone became one of the most 
polluted in the country. However, on 
September 1972, Rhode Island made his-
tory by hosting the largest single-day 
environmental clean-up in American 
history. David Rosser, a conservation 
leader and dedicated community orga-
nizer, recruited over 10,000 volunteers 
to clean up the pollution that littered 
the water and the banks. The cleanup 
effort came to be known as Project 
ZAP—Zero Away Pollution. 
The Blackstone has come a long way 
over the past five decades. In 1985, the

September 6, 2022 
Blackstone Valley Tourism Council 
was started, followed by the Friends of 
the Blackstone and the Blackstone 
River Watershed Council. In 1986, the 
Blackstone River Valley became a Na-
tional Heritage Corridor, and the river 
was designated as an American Herit-
age River in 1998. I was proud to work 
with my colleagues in Rhode Island’s 
congressional delegation to have the 
river’s corridor designated as a Na-
tional Historical Park in 2014. The 
river is now home to fish, aquatic 
mammals, turtles, and a variety of 
birds that have returned to what was 
once a highly polluted habitat. Unfor-
tunately though, pollutants, litter, de-
bris, erosion, and invasive species still 
plague the river, which is why, this 
year, a 50-year anniversary ZAP clean- 
up is planned. 
On August 27, Rhode Islanders were 
at it again, cleaning and greening up 
the Blackstone River Watershed. With 
a goal of holding the largest Black-
stone Valley clean-up since 1972, the 
ZAP 50 steering team organized a 27– 
town, watershed wide, clean up. One 
hundred and twenty teams showed up 
to, pick up trash and clear the river of 
aquatic invasive species. 
I am happy to recognize the 50th an-
niversary of Project ZAP and the hard 
work of the many Rhode Islanders who 
serve as stewards of our environment. 
It is thanks to their efforts that the 
once hardest working river in America 
may be enjoyed peacefully.∑

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 751—DESIG-
NATING 
AUGUST 
1, 
2022, 
AS 
‘‘GOLD STAR CHILDREN’S DAY’’ 
Mr. WICKER submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 751 
Whereas the recognition of Gold Star Fam-
ilies in the United States dates back to 
World War I, when the families of fallen 
service members displayed a service flag in 
the window of their homes with a gold star; 
Whereas, in 1936, President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt signed into law legislation desig-
nating the last Sunday of September as 
‘‘Gold Star Mother’s Day’’, a national annual 
observance to honor the mothers of fallen 
service members; 
Whereas, since 2010, the Senate each year 
has honored Gold Star Spouses by resolution 
on April 5, recognizing the unique sacrifices 
made by the spouses of fallen service mem-
bers; 
Whereas thousands of sons and daughters 
have lost a parent who served in the Armed 
Forces and also deserve national recognition 
for the burden and legacy they carry; and 
Whereas, in 2022, the Senate honored Gold 
Star Children for the first time, recognizing 
the sons and daughters of service members 
who were killed while deployed in areas of 
hostility, as part of the national debt owed 
to all those who have shared in the sacrifice 
of military service: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates August 1, 2022, as ‘‘Gold Star 
Children’s Day’’; 
(2) honors the sacrifices and hardships of 
the children of fallen service members; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe Gold Star Children’s Day 
in support of the children of the fallen men 
and women of the Armed Forces of the 
United States.

752—COM-
MEMORATING 
THE 
48TH 
ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE SIGNING INTO 
LAW OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIRE-
MENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 
1974, RECOGNIZING THE IMPOR-
TANCE THE EMPLOYEE RETIRE-
MENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 
1974 PLAYS IN PROTECTING THE 
INTERESTS OF PARTICIPANTS IN 
EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND 
THEIR BENEFICIARIES, AND REC-
OGNIZING 
THE 
NEED 
TO 
EN-
COURAGE 
MORE 
WORKERS 
TO 
PARTICIPATE IN SUCH PLANS TO 
SAVE FOR THEIR RETIREMENT 
Mrs. MURRAY submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was referred 
to the Committee on Health, Edu-
cation, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 752 
Whereas September 2, 2022, marks the 48th 
anniversary of the signing into law of the 
Employee Retirement Income Security Act 
of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) (referred to in 
this preamble as ‘‘ERISA’’); 
Whereas the purpose of ERISA is to pro-
tect the interests of participants in em-
ployee benefit plans and their beneficiaries; 
Whereas, since ERISA became law, the 
number of employee benefit plans has nearly 
tripled from approximately 300,000 in 1974 to 
730,000 in 2019; 
Whereas, during that same time period, the 
number of participants in employee benefit 
plans has increased more than 200 percent 
from approximately 45,000,000 in 1974 to 
142,000,000 in 2019; 
Whereas employee benefit plans under 
ERISA continue to be an important factor 
affecting the stability of employment and 
the well-being and financial security of mil-
lions of workers and their dependents; 
Whereas, despite the enormous growth in 
employee benefit plans, only 56 percent of 
workers participate in such plans; 
Whereas Congress is working to pass com-
prehensive retirement legislation to encour-
age more employers to offer robust employee 
benefit plans and help more workers to par-
ticipate in such plans; and 
Whereas ERISA will play a critical role in 
protecting these additional participants and 
their beneficiaries: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance the Em-
ployee Retirement Income Security Act of 
1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.) plays in pro-
tecting the interests of participants in em-
ployee benefit plans and their beneficiaries; 
and 
(2) recognizes the work that still remains 
to be done to encourage more workers to 
participate in such plans to save for their re-
tirement.

MAXIMIZING OUTCOMES THROUGH 
BETTER INVESTMENTS IN LIFE-
SAVING 
EQUIPMENT 
FOR 
(MO-
BILE) HEALTH CARE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 441, S. 958. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER.

The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 958) to amend the Public Health 
Service Act to expand the allowable use cri-
teria for new access points grants for com-
munity health centers. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions, with an amendment to strike all 
after the enacting clause and insert in 
lieu thereof the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Maximizing 
Outcomes through Better Investments in Life-
saving Equipment for (MOBILE) Health Care 
Act’’.

lish a new delivery site that is a mobile unit, re-
gardless of whether the applicant additionally 
proposes to establish a permanent, full-time site. 
In the case of a health center that is not cur-
rently receiving funds under this section, such 
health center may be awarded funds under 
clause (i) to establish a new delivery site that is 
a mobile unit only if such health center uses a 
portion of such funds to also establish a perma-

f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I have 
come to the Senate floor again today 
to 
talk 
about 
the 
situation 
in 
Ukraine—this is the 21st week in a row 
since we have been in session that I 
have done so—and to talk about how 
Ukraine is responding to Russia’s bru-
tal and unprovoked attack on that sov-
ereign country—an ally of ours, a de-
mocracy. 
This is a map of Ukraine. You can see 
here where the Russian invasion came 
back in 2014 and where they are now. 
You can also see some progress being 
made in blue as the Ukrainian military 
pushes back on this latest invasion. 
Last week, I was able to visit 
Ukraine and to go to Kyiv, the capital, 
along with a colleague of mine across 
the aisle, Senator AMY KLOBUCHAR of 
Minnesota. Senator KLOBUCHAR and I 
believed it was important to dem-
onstrate 
bipartisan 
support 
for 
Ukraine at a very critical time. She 
and I will be back here on the Senate 
floor, together, later this week to talk 
further about this trip. The trip came 
on the 6-month anniversary of Russia’s 
illegal invasion of Ukraine. It also 
came in the same week that Ukraine 
began a counteroffensive against the 
Russian invasion here in the Kherson 
area. It also came at a time when there 
was increased concern about the nu-
clear powerplant at Zaporizhzhia here. 
The powerplant is actually right here 
near this red line. Inspectors from the 
U.N.—United 
Nations—International 
Atomic Energy Agency visited this 
Zaporizhzhia nuclear powerplant last 
week, which is Europe’s single largest 
nuclear powerplant. 
We began our trip in Poland, where 
we met with the leadership of the elite 
101st Airborne Division, which is sta-
tioned in south Poland. The 101st is a 
unit with a long, proud history, includ-
ing of participating in the daring air-
borne assaults on D-day, in striking 
deep within enemy lines during Oper-
ation Desert Storm, and in serving 
with distinction in the Global War on 
Terror. 
As its motto attests, the 101st had a 
‘‘rendezvous with destiny’’ during piv-
otal moments in our country’s history. 
Now they have another rendezvous 
with destiny. In Poland, they are not 
only bolstering allied defenses in East-
ern Europe—here in Poland but really 
all around Eastern Europe—but they 
are also conducting a very important 
mission: They are facilitating the de-
livery of vital military assistance to 
Ukraine from 42 other countries—other 
than the United States—all around the 
world. These soldiers are really at the 
tip of the spear of America’s historic 
effort to arm Ukrainian soldiers with 
the tools they need to protect them-
selves and to protect their democracy. 
I also got to meet soldiers from the 
101st from my home State of Ohio. 
They told me of the Polish people’s 
welcoming of them. They said that peo-
ple are so grateful for what the Amer-
ican soldiers are doing there in Poland. 
They feel so much better knowing that 
the American presence is there. One 
guy told me about walking down a 
street in Poland and of someone com-
ing up and hugging him just to say 
thank you. He was a little surprised by 
that. 
The senior leaders of the 101st briefed 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and me on how the 
military assistance mission is going 
and on what is actually happening on 
the battlefield against the Russians. 
In Ukraine, Senator KLOBUCHAR and I 
traveled to Kyiv to meet with senior 
Ukrainian officials, including Presi-
dent 
Zelenskyy, 
Defense 
Minister 
Reznikov, 
Chief 
of 
Staff 
Andriy 
Yermak, and others, as well as mem-
bers of their Parliament, which is 
called the Rada. We also traveled north 
of Kyiv to see firsthand where Russian 
forces committed unspeakable atroc-
ities 
against 
defenseless, 
innocent 
Ukrainian civilians during the initial 
stages of this war. We also saw where 
Russian forces were stopped dead in 
their tracks—in the early assault on 
the capital—by brave Ukrainian de-
fenders. 
During our meeting with President 
Zelenskyy, the very first thing that he 
wanted to say was thank you—thank 
you to the American people for being

such great partners and strong allies in 
helping Ukraine defend itself. He and 
his leadership team know well the vital 
role that America’s assistance has 
played in helping Ukraine not just to 
defend itself against Russia’s illegal, 
unprovoked, and cold-blooded invasion 
but now to actually push Russian 
forces back and begin to liberate terri-
tory in some places, like in the south-
ern part of Ukraine. 
It was a common theme of our trip 
that we heard from all Ukrainians re-
garding their thankfulness to America. 
They are immensely appreciative of 
what the American people have done, 
the fact that we have stepped up and 
led in helping Ukraine in this fight for 
freedom. By the way, because of that, 
because of America’s assistance and 
America’s leadership, they are very op-
timistic about their future. 
We spoke about many topics with 
President Zelenskyy, including the sit-
uation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear 
powerplant, which has grown increas-
ingly dangerous over the past few 
weeks. The Russians have captured 
this plant and now have taken the 
Ukrainian employees of this nuclear 
powerplant—the biggest in Europe— 
captive and have intimidated them in 
various ways. We were told about their 
being harassed. There have even been 
reports of torture and of working at 
gunpoint. Now Russia is reportedly 
using explosives to destroy electrical 
infrastructure from the plant that 
takes electricity into Ukraine. They 
want to cut off the infrastructure that 
goes into Ukraine and steal the energy 
for themselves. 
Remember that this is not just the 
biggest plant in Europe; it provides 20 
percent of the electricity for Ukraine. 
It allows Ukraine, actually, right now, 
to sell some of its electricity to other 
countries, which is helping with regard 
to Ukraine’s serious budget problems. 
The Russians are also using this nu-
clear powerplant as a military base es-
sentially—as a nuclear shield. This is 
playing with fire. They are firing artil-
lery, which is positioned at the plant, 
on the Ukrainian forces nearby, know-
ing that the Ukrainians cannot fire 
back. 
Russia has already irresponsibly used 
oil and gas energy as a weapon of war. 
We have seen this. We have seen what 
they have done to Europe. They have 
said to Europe: If you don’t stop all of 
these sanctions, we are going to cut off 
your energy. In fact, Nord Stream 1 
now has been cut off, causing great 
harm and pain in Europe. So they are 
using energy as a weapon already. 
We have seen them use food as a 
weapon of war—totally irresponsible— 
including actually bombing Ukrainian 
grain bins with grain that is absolutely 
essential right now to places like Sub- 
Saharan Africa to be able to survive 
because they depend so much on 
Ukrainian wheat, corn, and sunflower 
oil. Now, they are taking it to the next 
step. Now, they are actually using nu-
clear power and this military base as a 
weapon of war. 
Using nuclear power and these reac-
tors as a tool in this war is a reckless 
escalation, risking a catastrophe. We 
can have on our hands the worst nu-
clear disaster since Chernobyl. I en-
courage President Putin to do the right 
thing and demilitarize this area around 
the plant. This is dangerous to the en-
tire continent, including to Russia and 
the rest of Europe. Allow these workers 
to do their jobs without this kind of 
pressure and ensure there is no leakage 
from the plant. President Zelenskyy 
agreed with us in our meeting that 
that is the way this should be handled: 
It should be demilitarized. 
I note that today the United Nations’ 
IAEA inspectors at the plant have also 
said there should be a demilitarized 
zone around the plant. I also heard 
today that two members of this inspec-
tion team who visited last week when 
we were there will now be staying at 
the plant for an uncertain period. That 
is good news, that there actually will 
be some inspectors there from the 
United Nations. It is a step in the right 
direction, at least. What Russia needs 
to do is to back off this plant and de-
militarize the area. 
We know that Russia’s ultimate plan 
here is to disconnect this nuclear pow-
erplant from Ukraine’s grid, as I said, 
and connect it to the Russian grid. 
This is a theft of power, plain and sim-
ple. This plant, which is the largest in 
Europe, produces, again, 20 percent of 
Ukraine’s electricity. 
We 
also 
talked 
to 
President 
Zelenskyy about the various weapon 
needs that they continue to have. He 
talked specifically about how effective 
the High Mobility Artillery Rocket 
System, or HIMARS, has been. These 
are weapons that the United States has 
provided to Ukraine, about 16 of them. 
Also, the UK and Germany have pro-
vided comparable systems to Ukraine, 
and they have been extremely effec-
tive. They have used these missile sys-
tems to target Russian ammo depots’ 
logistics lines that are within Ukraine 
but are far from the frontlines. They 
are destroying these ammo depots— 
these command posts, these pieces of 
critical 
infrastructure—and 
this 
is 
causing disarray in Russia’s ability to 
supply, control, and maneuver its 
forces. 
We 
have 
heard 
repeatedly 
that 
Ukrainian military morale has been 
lifted by these HIMARS because of 
their ability, finally, to reach these 
Russian positions and reach the Rus-
sian artillery that previously was out 
of reach of the Ukrainian artillery. 
They said they were sitting back with 
impunity and destroying Ukrainian 
cities, killing civilians and killing sol-
diers without having any consequences. 
Now, 
they 
are 
feeling 
some 
con-
sequences. They also said that not only 
is the Ukrainian morale increasing but 
that the Russian morale is decreasing. 
It is deteriorating as the Ukrainians 
make progress. 
HIMARS have been in use by the U.S. 
Armed Forces for over a decade; yet 
even the soldiers I talked to at the 
101st told us how surprised they were 
at how resourceful and creative the 
Ukrainians were in using and main-
taining these systems. 
Ukrainian soldiers clearly have the 
ingenuity as well as the will and the 
determination to fight. If we continue 
to provide them with these tools that 
they need to be able to be successful, 
Ukraine will persevere over time and 
preserve its freedom and independence 
from Russian domination. 
The point I would like to make, real-
ly, is that what we did here in this 
Chamber by voting for this aid that re-
sulted in these HIMARS is making a 
huge difference in Ukraine. 
After 
meeting 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy, we visited some of the sub-
urbs outside Kyiv. Collectively, these 
places tell the story of Russia’s failed 
attempt to capture Kyiv. 
We first visited Irpin. It is a small 
town about 30 minutes outside of Kyiv. 
Before the war, Irpin was a quiet town 
where people lived and worked in 
peace, but Russia’s invasion in Feb-
ruary brought horrific violence there. 
As these pictures show our walking 
through Kyiv—Senator KLOBUCHAR and 
myself—you can see the destruction to 
the civilian targets, to these apart-
ment buildings. The Russian forces as-
saulted Irpin with no regard for civil-
ian property or civilian life. Every-
where we looked, we saw destroyed 
businesses, apartment buildings, cars. 
We saw bullet holes everywhere, mas-
sive holes in the sides of buildings. You 
can see where tank rounds were fired 
through buildings. We also saw small 
craters in parking lots from mortars. 
Thankfully, a lot of the civilians were 
able to flee the violence just before the 
Russians reached the city, but not all 
had that opportunity. Irpin’s mayor es-
timated that up to 300 civilians were 
killed in Russia’s assault on the town. 
We also visited the nearby town of 
Bucha—a name that has, unfortu-
nately, become synonymous with war 
crimes and Russia’s atrocities during 
this war. During the few weeks that 
Russian soldiers controlled this small 
town in March and April, unspeakable 
crimes were committed there, includ-
ing rape and torture and the executions 
of hundreds of civilians. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and I went to the 
Church of St. Andrew—a beautiful 
church but, sadly, also the site of a 
mass grave dug by Russian soldiers. 
There, the Russians buried dozens of 
innocent 
Ukrainians, 
civilians 
who 
were tortured and murdered at the 
hands of the Russians. 
Our visits to Irpin and Bucha were 
sobering. It is one thing to see the de-
struction of apartments and other ci-
vilian targets on television; it is an-
other to see it firsthand and to talk to 
the people—the locals, the residents— 
about what happened. It is hard to be-
lieve that such things can happen in 
the 21st century. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR and I also visited 
Hostomel Airport, which is outside of

September 6, 2022 
Kyiv. This photograph is of the airport 
and of some of the destruction there. 
This is the Deputy Minister of Interior 
of Ukraine, who joined us there. 
This airport was meant to be Russia’s 
forward operating base for its assault 
on Kyiv. It was assaulted by elite Rus-
sian airborne forces and experienced 
Chechen fighters on the very first day 
of the war—February 24—with a plan to 
secure the airport and use it for 
ferrying in troops and equipment and 
flying in Russian forces to take over 
Kyiv and take over the country. 
However, these troops had landed 
deep into Ukrainian territory, and 
brave Ukraine soldiers—mostly inexpe-
rienced but highly motivated national 
guard 
troops—counterattacked 
the 
Russian invaders at the airport and 
fought ferociously. Remember, these 
were elite Russian airborne troopers 
who had come into this airport. Yet 
they were defeated by Ukraine’s na-
tional guardsmen, most of whom had 
never seen combat before. 
We had the opportunity to speak 
with some of the soldiers who were 
there at Hostomel Airport during Rus-
sia’s initial assault. The national guard 
commander, who was there that day, 
told us about his unit’s heroic efforts 
to defend the airport that day and the 
next day and the next day and about 
the men he lost, including several cap-
tured soldiers who are still prisoners of 
Russia 6 months later. 
I asked him how they could have 
been successful beating the odds. He 
said simply: 
We were fighting to defend our families, 
our freedom . . . our homeland, and that’s 
why we won. 
Hostomel Airport is where Ukrainian 
forces won their first major victory 
against the Russian invaders and where 
they stopped Russia’s northern ad-
vance dead in its tracks. If you look at 
this map, you can see what the Rus-
sians intended to do and what actually 
happened. They intended to come into 
the airport here, north and east of 
town, take over Kyiv, topple the gov-
ernment, and eventually take over all 
of Ukraine. Eventually, because of the 
fighting and the Ukrainian troops that 
pushed back, they ended up going 
through Belarus, back into Russia, and 
now are in this area. 
So if this war had not been success-
fully prosecuted at Hostomel Airport, 
it would have been a very different out-
come. You would have seen Kyiv fall. 
You would have seen the President’s 
government fall—the duly elected gov-
ernment 
of 
Ukraine, 
President 
Zelenskyy—the Rada, the Parliament, 
fall. This war could have been over 
very soon if that had happened. But, 
thankfully, it did not. And, again, it is 
because of the bravery and courage of 
the Ukrainian National Guard. 
Hostomel Airport, to me, is a symbol 
of Ukrainian resistance, of Ukrainian 
victory in the face of overwhelming 
odds. And I was very honored to meet 
some of the brave heroes who were 
there that day and liberated the air-
port. 
We 
also 
met 
with 
members 
of 
Ukraine’s Parliament, called the Rada, 
from various political parties, includ-
ing David Arakhamia. David is the ma-
jority leader in the Parliament and one 
of Ukraine’s chief negotiators with the 
Russians. We spoke about the current 
state of the war and the future of the 
conflict, including possible paths of 
victory for Ukraine. The consensus was 
that the only way that Russia would 
come to the bargaining table would be 
if the sanctions could be further tight-
ened and if the Ukrainians continued 
to make progress on the battlefield. 
Victories in the east and the south give 
Ukraine more leverage at the bar-
gaining table when negotiations begin. 
That is why it is so important, you see 
here in the light blue, some of the suc-
cess the Ukrainian soldiers have had 
recently, even in the last week or so, as 
well as up here around Kharkiv. 
In each of our meetings—with the 
101st Airborne, the President and his 
top advisers, the Secretary of De-
fense—we spoke extensively about en-
suring proper oversight and account-
ability for U.S.-provided assistance, in-
cluding military assistance. The 101st 
Airborne told us they had a sophisti-
cated ‘‘end-use monitoring’’ program 
for weapons with the ability to track 
all of the military equipment being 
transferred to Ukraine. I am happy to 
report that much progress is being 
made on that front. 
The United States has spent billions 
of dollars to support Ukrainians in the 
defense of their nation, and it was ap-
propriate. But Ukrainian officials un-
derstand that it is important that we 
provide transparency to this funding. 
They do not take it for granted. They 
know this funding is ultimately ac-
countable to the U.S. taxpayer. They 
are eager to demonstrate to their allies 
to the West that they are using these 
weapons and this equipment properly 
and to great effect on the battlefield. 
So we have good partners here who 
want to be sure that we do have this 
transparency. They have been pro-
viding significant visibility on the 
weapons and equipment, we learned, as 
it has been received from the United 
States, and they will continue to do so. 
The goal is to be able to track the de-
livery of every single weapon down to 
the individual serial number all the 
way to the frontlines. 
We 
left 
this 
trip 
with 
several 
takeaways. First, the genuine grati-
tude of the Ukrainian people and the 
government of Ukraine, the feeling of 
common cause with the people of 
America. Forty-plus countries have 
provided military equipment and other 
support. The Ukrainians recognize that 
if it weren’t for these weapons and 
training that the United States and our 
allies have provided to Ukraine, their 
country might very well be part of 
Russia today. And they know that 
America has led the efforts. 
Some officers from Embassy Kyiv 
told us that a few weeks ago, they or-
dered takeout from a restaurant. They 
got some cheeseburgers. And in the bag 
that was delivered to the Embassy, the 
local restaurant personnel had written: 
Thank you for the HIMARS. 
Remember, HIMARS are these rocket 
assault systems. HIMARS has now be-
come a household name in Ukraine. 
They are so appreciative that they 
have the ability to defend themselves. 
Second, it was remarkable to Senator 
KLOBUCHAR and me to learn just how 
much of an impact our military assist-
ance is having on the battlefield. In the 
opening stages of the war, that was the 
Javelins—remember, 
the 
anti-tank 
missiles that were a decisive weapon 
that halted the slow advance of the 
Russian armored columns toward Kyiv. 
Now, in this stage of the war, it is 
the HIMARS and the anti-aircraft 
weaponry. Every day, Ukrainian forces 
are pounding Russian positions all 
across the frontlines, particularly in 
the south. In fact, the day before we ar-
rived in Kyiv, they launched their 
long-awaited 
counteroffensive 
in 
southern Ukraine. And from what I 
hear in Ukraine from both U.S. and 
Ukrainian officials, it is clear this 
counteroffensive would not have been 
possible without our help. HIMARS 
strikes have softened up Russia’s posi-
tion in the south and made it possible 
for the counteroffensive that is going 
on right here, tonight, as we speak. 
Again, as you may recall, the Rus-
sian artillery was out of reach before 
and was just pounding Ukrainian forces 
and civilians with impunity. 
HIMARS have also struck command 
posts, which is very important because 
that has crippled Russia’s ability to ef-
fectively command and control its 
forces. They have also struck some 
really important bridges across the 
country, including one here that is in-
credibly important to Russia to be able 
to supply its troops. So this has iso-
lated some of these Russian forces and 
prevented them from being able to ma-
neuver to support one another. 
Our assistance in Ukraine is having a 
significant and positive impact on the 
battlefield, and we must not stop now 
and squander the progress that we have 
made. 
The money is being well-spent in the 
defense of freedom. The weapons we are 
providing are giving the Ukrainians a 
real chance at leveling this battlefield 
and giving them an opportunity to win 
back their lost territory. 
My third takeaway from this trip is 
that we need to do more for Ukraine 
both in the short term and the long 
term. President Zelenskyy made an ap-
peal to Senator KLOBUCHAR and me for 
the United States to provide Ukraine 
with ATACMS, which are Army Tac-
tical Missile Systems. These can be 
fired from the HIMARS launchers cur-
rently in Ukraine, and they have sig-
nificantly longer range and longer 
reach than the missiles we are cur-
rently providing. It seems to me these 
missiles would be an important part of

from both American and Russian brief-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4447 
September 6, 2022 
President Zelenskyy also requested 
more air defense systems: short, me-
dium, and long-range. His rationale 
was very simple. He wants the 7 mil-
lion Ukrainians who have left his coun-
try to be able to return, and they want 
to return. Having met with refugees in 
two previous trips this year to the bor-
der of Poland, Moldova, and talked to 
these refugees, all of them want to go 
back. But when it is safe, they will be 
able to go back. So having more air de-
fense systems at every range—short, 
medium, and long-range—would enable 
people to come back. 
This is crucial because this is one of 
the issues now, is that Ukraine’s econ-
omy has been reduced by about 40 per-
cent because of the terrible war that is 
being waged. If these people could 
move back to Ukraine, get back to 
work as normal, pay taxes, begin to be-
come part of the economy again, this 
would be the most helpful thing to 
Ukraine’s budget problems and their 
economic woes. 
With a layered air defense system, 
they could close its skies to the Rus-
sian missiles, protect its people, and 
get life across much of Ukraine back to 
normal. 
I am glad the Biden administration 
has already acted on some of the re-
quest to provide more protection for 
the skies by pledging eight National 
Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Sys-
tems, or NASAMS, in conjunction with 
our German allies. I urge the Biden ad-
ministration and other partners to do 
more to respond to this request. 
Ukraine is where we are engaging in 
the fight for freedom in this genera-
tion. And it is not just about Ukraine. 
For years, Russia and China have been 
saying that the West is in decline, that 
the United States and our allies are 
weak-willed and untrustworthy. That 
is 
certainly 
what President Putin 
thought when he invaded Ukraine. He 
thought he would divide NATO, divide 
the West, and that we would not re-
spond; that Ukraine and our allies 
would fold; that we would just stand 
aside and let it happen. We have proved 
him wrong so far, not only by aiding 
Ukraine but protecting the region. 
The recent announcement that we 
were sending 250 of the best tanks in 
the world—the Abrams battle tanks, 
which are made in my home State of 
Ohio—to Poland is a commitment to 
the region. It is a commitment to East-
ern Europe. This will send a critical 
message to Russia that the United 
States stands for freedom not only in 
Ukraine, but all throughout Europe 
and the world. 
I thank our European allies for all 
they are doing as well and urge them 
to continue to step up their support for 
Ukraine. After all, their own ability to 
remain free may very well rest on 
Ukraine 
remaining 
free. 
As 
one 
Ukrainian 
told 
me 
on 
this 
trip: 
Ukraine is the shield for democracy for 
Europe. 
We must show Vladimir Putin’s cyni-
cism about the West, that he is wrong. 
America has always stood by its val-
ues: freedom, democracy, and the right 
of nations to chart their own futures 
and to live in peace with their neigh-
bors. We cannot stop now. Most of us 
who serve in this Chamber understand 
that, and so do the vast majority of 
American people. 
Ten days ago, before I headed over-
seas, I marched in the Ukraine Inde-
pendence Day Parade in Parma, OH, 
just outside of Cleveland. I was with 
two national leaders in the Ukrainian 
community: 
Marta 
Liscynesky 
and 
Andy Futey. I proudly marched with 
them. There were over 60 entrants in 
this parade. It went on and on and on. 
The large turnout, both in terms of 
participants and spectators, was a dem-
onstration of the support for Ukraine. 
Ohio is home to tens of thousands of 
Ukrainian Americans who do not want 
to see Ukraine become part of some re-
newed Russian empire. They want 
Ukraine—their homeland—to remain 
free and sovereign. And the so-called 
Nationalities Community—from Slove-
nians to Poles, from Georgians to Lith-
uanians—all have the same under-
standing of the direct threat that Rus-
sia poses. They know Ukraine is on the 
frontlines of a larger battle for free-
dom. So many Ohioans have rallied to-
gether to support Ukraine from all 
backgrounds. 
In closing, I want to thank everyone 
who helped make our important trip 
possible, including the State Depart-
ment and our allies in Ukraine and in-
cluding our military colleagues in Po-
land. 
It is important that Congress con-
tinue to show our strong support for 
Ukraine, particularly during this crit-
ical period for the country’s future. 
The stakes are so high. 
This is a fight about global freedom, 
self-determination, democracy, and re-
spect for territorial integrity. All of 
us—the United States and our allies— 
need to stand up because the alter-
native is a far more dangerous and 
volatile world, and that affects all of 
us. Forty-two freedom-loving allies of 
the United States have stood together 
in support of Ukraine militarily. Doz-
ens of others have helped in other 
ways. But all nations around the world 
are carefully paying attention to what 
happens in Ukraine, not just our allies 
but also our adversaries. 
We have shown the world that Amer-
ica and allies didn’t back down after 6 
weeks, not even after 6 months. We 
haven’t faltered. We must commit to 
continuing to help Ukraine defend 
itself until Vladimir Putin understands 
that Russia’s borders end where free-
dom begins. 
‘‘Slava Ukraini’’ and Godspeed to the 
brave soldiers of Ukraine. ‘‘Heroyam 
Slava.’’ 
I yield the floor.
