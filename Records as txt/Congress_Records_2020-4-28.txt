CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
PHYLLIS LYON 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to the beautiful life and legacy 
of a dear friend, Phyllis Lyon, who passed 
away peacefully on April 9, 2020 at the age of 
95. Phyllis Lyon was an icon of San Francisco 
and a trailblazer in the fight for civil rights, who 
dedicated her entire life to advancing equality 
for the LGBTQ community. Her passing is a 
profound official loss for the countless San 
Franciscans whose lives she touched and a 
deep personal loss for her many friends and 
loved ones. 
Phyllis, along with her late wife Del Martin, 
was a pioneer in the fight for LGBTQ equality. 
In their kitchen, in 1955, they created the 
Daughters of Bilitis, the first national lesbian 
rights organization. Through their skillful advo-
cacy and Phyllis’s brilliant writing, they helped 
lesbians and all LGBTQ Americans unite in 
solidarity and, in the process, helped develop 
the foundation on which the entire LGBTQ 
equality movement was built. 
Phyllis was a tireless force for progress. As 
a journalist and community organizer, she 
fought relentlessly to decriminalize homosex-
uality, promote women’s health and end em-
ployment discrimination in San Francisco. In 
all her endeavors, Phyllis’s voice and exper-
tise were instrumental in bringing our nation 
closer to its founding promise of justice and 
equality for all. 
In 1979, the Lyon-Martin Health Services, 
named in honor of Phyllis and Del, was cre-
ated to provide LGBTQ women access to 
quality, comprehensive health care, free from 
fear, stigma or discrimination. In its four dec-
ades of service to the Bay Area community, 
the Lyon-Martin Health Services has become 
an essential lifeline for countless women and 
their families, regardless of who they are or 
whom they love. As a model for community- 
based care, it is a fitting tribute to Phyllis’s leg-
acy of service and commitment to lifting up all 
vulnerable communities. 
Phyllis and Del’s passion, dedication and vi-
sion were an inspiration to me and to genera-
tions of leaders, activists and public servants. 
In 1995, I was honored to appoint Phyllis to 
the White House Conference on Aging where 
she advocated powerfully to ensure that the 
needs of the most vulnerable were heard at 
the decision-making table. It was a privilege to 
speak of Phyllis and Del’s beautiful commit-
ment to each other on the Floor of the House 
during the debate of the so-called Defense of 
Marriage Act and, again, last year, as the 
House passed the landmark Equality Act to fi-
nally end LGBTQ discrimination once and for 
all. 
All those who were blessed to know Phyllis 
and Del remember the extraordinary love that 
they had for each other and the great joy we 
felt watching them becoming the first same- 
sex marriage recognized in San Francisco. As 
we mourn the loss of our dear Phyllis, we find 
peace in knowing that she and Del are to-
gether again. May it be a comfort to their 
daughter Kendra, Phyllis’s sister Patricia, 
grandchildren Lorri and Kevin and her entire 
family that so many mourn their loss and pray 
for them at this sad time.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. CHRISSY HOULAHAN 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, Ameri-
cans have a proud history of global leader-
ship, of coalition building, and of pushing the 
boundaries of technological advancement. 
These values are now being put to the test as 
we face the novel coronavirus, an invisible 
threat that will not be overcome quickly. 
There is no successful way through this cri-
sis without a global effort, one in which we 
build a coalition of our allies, share informa-
tion, work in tandem with the World Health Or-
ganization, and contribute to and benefit from 
international organizations who are on the 
frontlines of fighting this deadly disease. It 
goes without saying that cutting funding to the 
WHO at this time is not only naı¨ve but also 
presents a threat to the American people 
down the road as we determine how to safely 
return to normalcy and avoid a second or third 
spike. 
This is not to suggest we blindly trust other 
nations—it’s been made clear the Chinese 
Government has misled the world about its 
cases and, early on, spread misinformation 
about the virus’ transmission. China must be 
held accountable for its actions but taking a 
harsh isolationist stance at this current mo-
ment, when tens of thousands of Americans 
are dying, is irresponsible. A global pandemic 
requires a global solution, and we must act 
deliberately in convening our international al-
lies and partners to develop a coherent testing 
strategy and mitigation plan as quickly as pos-
sible. 
We have talked at length about the eco-
nomic impact of this crisis. It’s important to re-
member that our economy is a global one, 
and if we refuse to cooperate with the larger 
global community, our economy will continue 
to suffer. 
Put plainly, I am urging the Administration 
and Congress to reach across oceans and re- 
enter the international conversation about the 
COVID–19 epidemic. As a Member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee, I will be seeking the 
advice of medical, scientific, and development 
experts from around the world so that we can 
create a plan of action that stops the spread 
of this deadly virus. 
We’re in this together whether we like it or 
not. So, we may as well start acting like it. 
AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. ED CASE 
OF HAWAII 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. CASE. Madam Speaker, as our country 
and world confront the unprecedented chal-
lenge of the COVID–19 pandemic, some say, 
as a reason or excuse, that we should turn in-
ward away from the rest of our world and to 
our own affairs. 
But neither can nor should we disengage. 
Instead, I join many of my colleagues and our 
fellow citizens in stating clearly that there has 
never been a better time or greater need to 
embrace an across-the-board renewal of 
America’s global leadership. 
United Nations Secretary-General Antonio 
Guterres recently warned that COVID–19 
poses the greatest challenge for our world 
since the Second World War. As this pan-
demic claims lives and cripples health care 
systems across the world, it also leaves in its 
wake the specter of a global recession without 
parallel in recent memory that will claim count-
less millions of jobs and livelihoods. The im-
pacts of this pandemic will last years if not 
decades, and we will return to a world dras-
tically changed. 
This comparison of our present crisis to the 
Second World War reminds us of the extraor-
dinary sacrifices Americans made then and 
must make now. Yet, just as the greatest gen-
eration fought to liberate Europe and the Pa-
cific, so too must we commit to fighting this 
virus wherever it may emerge. The successors 
of American factories that assembled tanks 
and planes over 75 years ago must now build 
ventilators and medical supplies, not for our-
selves alone but for any nation who shares 
our fight against this pandemic. 
We are also reminded that the greatest gen-
eration, faced with a global economy ruined by 
war, chose not to celebrate victory in splendid 
isolation but did what no country had ever 
done before. That generation of Americans led 
the way in creating the United Nations and re-
building the economies of friend and foe alike 
through the Marshall Plan, the World Bank 
and the International Monetary Fund. No one 
can deny the spirit of generosity and good will 
that motivated those actions, but it was also 
the practical self-interest of acknowledging 
that our own future lay in international engage-
ment. Americans learned from the war that 
freedom, prosperity and peace go hand in 
hand and that, if we want to secure those 
blessings, we need to lead on the global 
stage. 
Today, those lessons still ring true. We 
know that a virus from one part of the world 
can swiftly spread, that a fragile state poses 
security challenges beyond its borders and 
that a slowdown in one economy can affect 
the entire global supply chain. So long as this 
pandemic persists in one country, we all are at 
risk, from a public health, economic, social, 
environmental and every other perspective.

April 28, 2020 
That is why Congress appropriated almost 
two billion dollars for international assistance 
across two emergency relief measures. Our 
Department of State and USAID have pledged 
almost $500 million, with more on the way. 
American businesses, philanthropies and non- 
governmental organizations are contributing 
their assistance as well wherever possible. 
These are important first steps, but our 
country can and must do more to lead a glob-
al effort against this pandemic. We must co-
ordinate pathways for assistance from devel-
oped to developing countries to enhance the 
capacity of their health care systems to com-
bat future waves of this pandemic. We must 
lead the way in bringing together the best and 
brightest around the world in fully under-
standing this virus and developing a vaccine. 
We must forge a path towards global eco-
nomic recovery, restoring old supply chains 
and creating new ones, and leading our world 
economy to be stronger, more resilient and 
more just than it was before this crisis. Above 
all, we must lead in repairing the frayed fabric 
of global order, restoring trust in and commit-
ment to our shared institutions among all 
countries. 
Seventy-five years after the Second World 
War, let us recall the courage and sacrifice of 
the greatest generation. Let us find the reali-
ties and opportunities in this crippling pan-
demic and recommit ourselves and the United 
States to global leadership and to the values 
of freedom, prosperity and peace at home and 
abroad. And as we do so and overcome this 
pandemic, let us, the Americans of this age, 
with our bravery, generosity and greatness of 
spirit, prove to be as celebrated an example 
as that greatest generation to Americans of fu-
ture eras.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. WILLIAM R. KEATING 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. 
KEATING. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic we face today has made 
it abundantly clear how truly connected to one 
another we all are and how widely our con-
nections span the globe. This pandemic is the 
greatest global challenge we have faced since 
World War II and cooperation has never been 
more important. 
As Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs 
Subcommittee for Europe, Eurasia, Energy 
and the Environment, it has been one of my 
top priorities to strengthen and support our 
transatlantic alliance. Together, the United 
States and our friends and allies in Europe 
have worked side by side to tackle challenges 
while advancing democratic values. Through 
our NATO alliance and as members of multi-
lateral institutions like the United Nations and 
the World Health Organization, we have con-
sistently worked together to maximize our re-
sources to address shared security threats. 
Now as we face the COVID–19 pandemic, 
our cooperation today is more important than 
ever. Although it has caused many to look in-
ward and focus on those in our own commu-
nities, it is critical to remember that the threat 
from COVID–19 will not end once we have 
flattened the curve here at home. If we fail to 
rally support and resources for countries strug-
gling with COVID–19 abroad, especially devel-
oping countries and countries marred by con-
flict, we risk this disease once again finding its 
way to our shores. Beyond the disease itself, 
we will face threats from the security and eco-
nomic conditions COVID–19 is already leaving 
in its wake including famine, a global reces-
sion, and heightened instability and the extre-
mism that often follows it. 
However, we must also remember that we 
don’t have to go it alone and that in fact we 
are stronger in meeting our shared challenges 
when we work together. We can learn from 
each other to better understand the pathology 
of COVID–19 and how we may ultimately 
begin safely reopening our economies. We 
can share resources to ensure all of our med-
ical and health personnel have access to per-
sonal protective equipment, ventilators and 
other medical devices, and eventually to vac-
cines as well. We can work together to de-
bunk myths and combat disinformation so our 
communities are not misled by malign actors. 
Our NATO alliance is already working to co-
ordinate these kinds of assistance and we 
must build on these successes to be most ef-
fective in ending this pandemic for good. 
We are capable of meeting this challenge if 
we do so together, and for that, American 
leadership is crucial. We have seen American 
leadership raise critical resources to fight 
pandemics in the past and improve the effec-
tiveness of multilateral institutions like the 
World Health Organization. If we cede this 
leadership role, we relinquish our ability to 
shape a safer, more secure future for all 
Americans, their families and friends overseas, 
and the myriad business and educational op-
portunities they have created together to grow 
the global economy and connect so many 
communities all around the world. Only to-
gether with our friends and partners, can we 
rise to meet this unprecedented challenge so 
that we may soon reunite with our loved ones, 
safely reopen our economies, and return to 
the lives we once knew.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, as a doctor, 
I’m proud that the United States has been a 
leader in global health. Around the world, mil-
lions of people are healthier and more safe 
because of the efforts of the United States. 
Through smart and strategic investments in 
the State Department and USAID, we have 
led the international fight against diseases like 
HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. We 
should all be proud of the far-reaching impact 
of our global health, development and humani-
tarian assistance programs. 
Several decades of leadership and invest-
ment in global health have not only saved the 
lives of people across the world, but have 
proved vital to protecting the health, security, 
and economic interests of Americans within 
our own borders. In our interconnected world, 
it can take 36 hours for a virus to travel from 
a remote village to all six continents. The 
sooner we act to contain a public health emer-
gency abroad, the safer our citizens are back 
home. 
The urgent need to contain the COVID–19 
pandemic and protect our constituents has re-
inforced the importance of contributing to glob-
al health challenges abroad. Since originating 
in China in December 2019, the virus has 
quickly spread to 170 countries and has now 
reached over 200,000 deaths worldwide. 
The United States has been hit particularly 
hard. With over 50,000 reported deaths, the 
pandemic is putting significant strain on our 
first responders and health systems. States 
are beginning to make the difficult decision 
whether to lift stay-at-home orders in hopes of 
jumpstarting the economy. 
But no matter how successful we are in 
fighting the pandemic here at home, we will 
never defeat it unless other parts of the world 
are equipped to prevent outbreaks from occur-
ring in the first place and to contain them 
when they do occur. Left unaddressed glob-
ally, COVID–19 will find its way back to the 
U.S. 
Before the virus hit the U.S., the Centers for 
Disease 
Control 
and 
Prevention 
(CDC) 
warned that a staggering 70 percent of coun-
tries were underprepared to prevent, detect, 
and respond to a public health emergency. 
Many nations, particularly in the developing 
world, aren’t equipped to deal with COVID–19 
or future pandemics. Far too many countries 
suffer from weak health systems, with chal-
lenges such as unsafe water and inadequate 
sanitation tools to lack of health centers alto-
gether. 
Other nations are reeling from years of con-
flict, natural disasters or other humanitarian 
conflicts, doing their best to support inad-
equate health systems already operating well 
below capacity. COVID–19 does not recognize 
borders. It doesn’t know the difference be-
tween someone back in my district and one of 
the over 65 million forcibly displaced persons 
in the world. 
The secondary economic and food short-
ages have hit us hard here in the U.S. and we 
in Congress are doing our best to address 
them. The predictions for the future around the 
world are bleak—the World Food Program re-
cently estimated that by the end of 2020 the 
number of people around the world who are 
starving could double, reaching 265 million 
people. 
All these risk factors around the world only 
increase the likelihood of this virus reemerging 
at our doorstep. They also leave us exposed 
to future public health threats. Now, more than 
ever, the U.S. must continue to lead on global 
health. As Congress works towards additional 
funding and response efforts to fight this glob-
al pandemic, it’s critical that our actions in-
clude funding to fight COVID–19 around the 
world. 
Decades of U.S. global leadership in foreign 
assistance has shown us that smart and stra-
tegic investments are critical to protecting the 
homeland. Our efforts have defended the 
safety of our nation and saved countless lives. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in calling for 
the prioritizing of a U.S.-led global response to 
combatting coronavirus. If we don’t keep one 
eye abroad, we unnecessarily leave our fami-
lies, friends, and neighbors at risk.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. THEODORE E. DEUTCH 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. DEUTCH. Madam Speaker, our best ef-
forts to fight this virus at home cannot suc-
ceed if we are not also fighting it abroad. 
The United States has led the world out of 
every major modern crisis, and that leadership 
now is critical to our ability to successfully re-
bound from the economic impact of COVID– 
19. We will not be able to fully restore eco-
nomic stability in our country until the spread 
of the virus is under control globally. 
In Congress, it’s our imperative to act quick-
ly for the American people. That certainly 
means protecting our courageous first re-
sponders, strengthening our health systems at 
home, and taking steps to safeguard American 
jobs and livelihoods. But it also means doing 
our part to eliminate threats before they reach 
our borders. 
Right now, the majority of the world, espe-
cially developing nations, lack the resources to 
prevent or respond to a public health crisis like 
COVID–19. They suffer from weak health as 
well as large percentages of displaced and 
refugee populations, where social distancing is 
near impossible. 
According to the CDC, 70 percent of the 
world is underprepared for a public health 
emergency. Robust U.S. funding for global 
health programs can help combat the contin-
ued spread of COVID–19. The United States 
must restore cuts to humanitarian funds, par-
ticularly in areas like water, sanitation, and hy-
giene, and increase funding for international 
organizations 
doing 
emergency 
response 
work. 
The United States has the scientific and 
technical expertise to assist others with their 
pandemic responses. The CDC is experienced 
in helping other countries meet international 
health standards for global health security. We 
must lead the international community in the 
global public health response, while also as-
serting leadership to coordinate a global eco-
nomic recovery. 
If we do not recognize that challenges 
abroad are linked to challenges at home, we 
will not be able to fully overcome the impact 
of this virus. If we leave the world vulnerable 
to coronavirus, we leave our own country vul-
nerable as well.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank Congressman BERA and Congressman 
YOHO, two of my colleagues on the House 
Foreign Affairs Committee, for hosting this vir-
tual special order today on the importance of 
strong U.S. global leadership with regard to 
the coronavirus. 
The coronavirus is reminding us that dis-
eases and their impacts know no borders, 
making it critical that the United States show 
leadership during the pandemic, and also 
afterwards to get the global economy back on 
track as well as prepare for the next outbreak. 
There is no reason to assume there will not be 
future outbreaks, and, as the world becomes 
more interconnected, we need to be prepared 
so that the next outbreak does not become a 
pandemic like the coronavirus. 
This is where the Global Health Security 
Act, legislation that my friend GERRY CON-
NOLLY and I authored, can make an impact. 
And I want to thank him for his leadership in 
moving this legislation forward. 
The Global Health Security Act would help 
the Federal Government prepare for the next 
pandemic both by codifying critical aspects of 
the interagency coordination process for global 
health security and also put the Congressional 
stamp of approval on the Global Health Secu-
rity Agenda (GHSA). 
The GHSA is an oddly-named multilateral 
initiative which seeks to strengthen health sys-
tems around the world. It focuses on public 
health issues of top international concern such 
as biosafety and biosecurity, immunization, 
health monitoring, zoonotic diseases, and 
healthcare worker training. Many of these pri-
ority areas are critical to fighting not only the 
coronavirus but also any infectious disease 
that emerges after we have contained the cur-
rent outbreak. 
The Obama Administration helped set up 
the GHSA in the face of sluggish implementa-
tion of international guidelines for health sys-
tems around the world and poor international 
leadership in response to the Ebola crisis in 
West Africa in 2014. The Trump Administra-
tion has enthusiastically carried on U.S. lead-
ership through the GHSA, pledging substantial 
U.S. funding toward its implementation. The 
GHSA is something which both parties can be 
proud of. 
Americans are rightly skeptical of the effi-
cacy of multilateral organizations. Since an ill-
ness is one short plane ride away, however, 
investments in disease detection and public 
health capacity in other countries directly sup-
port our own health security right here in 
America. If we don’t address and prepare for 
diseases abroad, we will have to address 
them at home. 
That is why I am proud that the Global 
Health Security Act passed the Foreign Affairs 
Committee in February with unanimous sup-
port. By passing this legislation Congress will 
demonstrate a strong commitment to global 
health security leadership. 
For better or worse, the United States does 
not have a choice on whether we step up and 
lead on the coronavirus and future pandemics. 
As we have seen, the Chinese Communist 
Party (CCP) has covered up, and still is cov-
ering up, critical information about the early 
stages of the disease and its origins. This al-
lowed the virus to become a global pandemic. 
In China, everyone’s health and wellbeing are 
subservient to the political goals of the CCP. 
We must ensure that the CCP does not take 
global health leadership. If it does, it will not 
just be the people of China whose health is 
subject to the political calculus of an authori-
tarian political system, it will be all people 
around the world, including here in America. 
AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. GILBERT RAY CISNEROS, JR. 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. CISNEROS. Madam Speaker, for the 
better part of the last century, U.S. leadership 
has been essential to addressing critical global 
challenges. From rebuilding Europe after 
World War II to building an international coali-
tion to respond to the Ebola Outbreak, the 
United States is unique in the world in its abil-
ity to build international coalitions and marshal 
resources and support around the world. The 
COVID–19 pandemic is a global crisis that 
necessarily requires a global response in 
order to solve it—and the United States must 
take up the leadership role it has fulfilled for 
decades to facilitate the response. 
COVID–19 
knows 
no 
borders—quickly 
spreading across the world in a matter of 
months, accelerated by our inter-connected 
world. As such, while we should extend every 
effort to arrest the spread in the United States, 
stopping the spread in the United States alone 
is not enough. If we are to truly be able to re-
open our economy and engage in global trade 
and participate in the global supply chain, we 
risk greater exposure and transmission of the 
virus if it continues to spread unchecked 
around the world. 
Fortunately, the United States possesses 
not only the requisite knowledge and expertise 
in its public health and medical officials, but 
also decades of experience in global health ef-
forts necessary to lead a coordinated global 
response. The United States has done this be-
fore. Through the State Department, U.S. 
Agency for International Development, and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
the United States has led efforts to combat the 
spread of HIV, malaria, Ebola, and other infec-
tious diseases. Doing so not only made the 
epicenters of those outbreaks safer, but it also 
made the United States and American citizens 
safer. As a result, we contributed to an envi-
ronment that enabled the American and global 
economies to thrive. Today, amid the worst 
global pandemic in at least a century, the 
United States must step back into the leader-
ship role it has held for decades and work with 
the international community to chart a pathway 
to defeat COVID–19. 
We must commit the resources necessary 
across our global health, humanitarian, and 
economic toolkits to defeat the coronavirus. 
According to the CDC, 70 percent of the world 
remains underprepared to prevent, detect, and 
respond to a public health emergency. That 
means we must ensure our diplomats and de-
velopment professionals on the frontlines re-
ceive the support they need to maintain oper-
ations, provide for emergency preparedness 
needs, and protect Americans. After commit-
ting trillions to relief at home and more than 
$2 billion in emergency funding to support the 
global COVID–19 response, it is understand-
able that some may be reticent to spend more 
on the international effort. However, as the 
data suggests that an outbreak in a remote vil-
lage can spread to major cities on all six con-
tinents in less than 36 hours, that funding is 
an investment in a safer and more prosperous 
America. 
I thank the Frontline healthcare workers, 
first responders, military servicemembers, and

other essential personnel who are keeping our 
society going during an unprecedented crisis 
at home—and I thank the diplomats and de-
velopment professionals around the world that 
are working to keep us safe. We must now 
honor their dedication and sacrifice by commit-
ting the resources to them that they will need 
to stop the spread of this virus and re-create 
an environment that will enable our commu-
nities to thrive.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, as 
the world faces the unprecedented challenges 
posed by the COVID–19 pandemic, U.S. lead-
ership in the global response is essential. 
Thank you to my colleague from California, 
Congressman BERA, and my colleague from 
Florida, Congressman YOHO, for leading a 
Congressional special order so that Members 
who represent communities across America 
can reiterate this point clearly. 
I serve on the Asia Subcommittee of the 
House Foreign Affairs Committee, which Rep-
resentatives BERA and YOHO lead as Chair-
man and Ranking Member. Our Subcommittee 
held our first hearing on the coronavirus out-
break in China in early February and our sec-
ond one later that month. What we heard dur-
ing these hearings from public health experts 
and administration officials reaffirmed some-
thing we already knew: The United States 
needed to demonstrate leadership in the inter-
national response in order to keep Americans 
safe. 
Since these hearings, this horrible disease 
has ravaged families and communities in the 
United States and around the world, including 
in Central Virginia. The death toll, as well as 
the impact on our way of life, has been heart-
breaking. Every day, I speak with Central Vir-
ginians who are experiencing this pain. As we 
do everything we can to halt the spread and 
impact of the virus in our local communities 
and across our nation, we must also recognize 
that U.S. leadership in the global fight against 
coronavirus is an essential part of ending the 
suffering at home. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has demonstrated 
that infectious diseases know no borders. An 
outbreak in a remote village can spread to 
major cities across all populated continents on 
earth in less than 36 hours. Even once we 
have more thorough testing and U.S. towns 
begin to see dropping numbers of cases, the 
disease could easily return. No matter how 
successful we are in fighting the threat of 
COVID–19 at home, we will not end the suf-
fering and fear created by the virus unless we 
also combat it around the world. 
This is exactly why global health experts, as 
well as foreign policy and military leaders, are 
speaking out—calling on U.S. government offi-
cials to lead by example and demonstrate 
leadership on the global stage. If our nation 
cedes international leadership, we are demot-
ing our international standing, creating a void 
that our adversaries will fill and exploit, and 
most critically, we are risking the safety and 
livelihoods of Americans. 
In addition, the pandemic is an incredibly 
painful reminder that, at the end of the day, 
U.S. national security comes down to resil-
ience at home. As we face international 
threats, including infectious disease, we are 
only as strong and prepared as our most vul-
nerable neighbors and our most susceptible 
systems. The coronavirus pandemic highlights 
that national security is much more than what 
typically comes to mind—it includes our med-
ical supply chains, the safety of American 
workers, and so much more. It includes 
emerging, transnational threats such as cli-
mate change and the COVID–19 virus—a dis-
ease that at any moment now is expected to 
cause a death toll surpassing the number of 
Americans who died in nearly a decade of 
fighting in Vietnam. Going forward, we must 
be prepared for the full range of risks to Amer-
ican security. And to do this, we must think of 
national security in a more comprehensive and 
integrated fashion, recognizing it is rooted in 
our strength at home and that the United 
States must lead on the global stage to pro-
vide the sense of security that so many Ameri-
cans lack as they face disease and job loss. 
As we strengthen and implement our re-
sponse to the COVID–19 pandemic and pre-
pare for future threats, we must recognize that 
U.S. global leadership is essential to pro-
tecting the health, security, and economic in-
terests of all Americans. We cannot step back 
from this challenge; we must step up.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. TED S. YOHO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, the United 
States, along with the rest of the world, cur-
rently finds itself in the midst sofa global emer-
gency of epic proportions. Never in the mod-
ern era has every nation on Earth been 
brought to their knees so quickly by a pan-
demic that threatens our security, our econ-
omy, and the social fabric of our lives. 
The United States, and the rest of the world, 
were woefully unprepared for the arrival of 
COVID–19. Our underestimation of infectious 
diseases goes back multiple administrations, 
when we had ample opportunity to secure our 
essential supply chains, ensure stockpiles of 
PPE, and dedicate the necessary resources to 
research and study emerging diseases. 
If there is one bright side of our current cri-
sis, it is that our nation will never again take 
for granted our health security. President 
George W. Bush and industry leaders like Bill 
Gates forewarned us that our country would 
need to take proactive measures to prepare 
for the next pandemic. We clearly failed in 
heeding their warnings. COVID–19 will not be 
the last health crisis we face, and we must 
use the lessons we have learned to aggres-
sively build up our capacity to prevent future 
pandemics. 
As a veterinarian, it’s no secret that I have 
been vocal on the threat of zoonotic diseases 
and the dangers of animal to human trans-
mission. Just recently, I introduced the Ad-
vancing Emergency Preparedness Through 
One Health Act of 2019, which would improve 
public health preparedness by helping federal 
agencies implement a ‘‘One Health’’ approach, 
recognizing that the health of people is linked 
to the health of animals and the environment. 
Multiple studies by the CDC have found that 
6 out of 10 infectious diseases were seen in 
animals before humans, including the virus we 
face now. Coordination between government 
agencies is essential in addressing and elimi-
nating zoonotic outbreaks, which is why the 
One Health model would improve synchroni-
zation between veterinarians and doctors by 
requiring the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity and United States Department of Agri-
culture to work together. 
Historically, the United States has applied 
its health expertise to the global stage as well, 
in the form of direct support and contributions 
to multilateral health organizations. The U.S. 
has historically been one of the largest donors 
to organizations like the Global Alliance for 
Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI), which uti-
lizes market forces and private sector partner-
ships to drive down medical costs and develop 
and deliver new and underused vaccines to 
developing nations. Similarly, the President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), 
established by President George W. Bush in 
2003, has saved millions worldwide by pro-
viding essential resources for prevention, 
treatment, and vaccine research. It is through 
smart investments like these that the United 
States demonstrates leadership on global 
health security. 
But we can, and must, do more. As we 
have seen, our current efforts were not 
enough to stop the spread of coronavirus from 
infecting millions and killing hundreds of thou-
sands. We must prepare for the next pan-
demic by partnering with initiatives like the Co-
alition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations 
(CEPI), an alliance aimed at coordinating the 
development of new vaccines to prevent and 
contain new infectious disease epidemics. 
CEPI works directly with industry, universities, 
and private research and development organi-
zations to leverage a dedicated approach to 
advancing vaccine research. Currently, CEPI 
has reoriented its entire organizational struc-
ture to address COVID–19 and is advancing 
eight vaccine candidates at a rapid pace. 
However, despite multiple multimillion-dollar 
contributions from Norway, Germany, Japan, 
the United Kingdom and the Gates Founda-
tion, the United States has yet to donate a 
cent. CEPI represents the next frontier in 
health security preparedness, and the United 
States must take the initiative if we are to con-
tinue leading international efforts on health se-
curity. 
If we abdicate our place as a leader in glob-
al health, there is another country eager to 
take the reins. China has not been subtle in 
asserting itself on global health issues, and 
often not for the benefit of other nations. Chi-
na’s recent coronavirus debacle should be evi-
dence enough that their communist regime 
cannot be trusted to lead with accountability, 
transparency, or pragmatism, traits that are 
essential when fighting widespread disease. 
As for how China would fare as a global 
health leader, look no further than the disas-
trous 
initial 
response 
by 
the 
WHO 
to 
coronavirus, one that was clearly influenced 
by Beijing. Information was slow-walked, warn-
ings from nations like Taiwan were ignored at 
crucial turning points, and cooperation with 
outside health experts was spurned until it 
was too late. And it has resulted in the largest

public health disaster the world has seen in 
over a century. 
The United States and the rest of the world 
cannot afford to relinquish authority over glob-
al health security, or to isolate ourselves from 
protecting the wellbeing of other nations. We 
must continue to think aggressively and plan 
for the long term while supporting international 
public-private partnerships like GAVI and 
CEPI. Let this be a watershed moment for our 
nation as a mistake to never repeat. With 
countless human lives and livelihoods at 
stake, the time for gambling with global health 
security is done.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. LOIS FRANKEL 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. FRANKEL. Madam Speaker, in my trav-
els around the world as a Member of Con-
gress one thing has become abundantly clear. 
Advancing prosperity and stability internation-
ally is not just a moral imperative, it’s a na-
tional imperative—because instability any-
where is a threat to stability everywhere. 
Human rights violations, terrorism, and in-
fectious diseases don’t stop at the border. We 
have seen that tragic reality reinforced through 
genocide, international terrorism, and global 
pandemics. 
So what is the lesson as we fight COVID– 
19? 
No matter how successful we are in com-
batting this pandemic here at home, we will 
never fully stop it unless we also combat it 
around the world. After all, we saw COVID–19 
jump from Wuhan, to Westminster, to West 
Palm, in a matter of weeks. Outbreaks in re-
mote villages don’t stay in remote villages. Ac-
cording to the CDC, 70 percent of the world 
remains underprepared to prevent, detect, and 
respond to any public health emergency. 
So while there is still so much more we 
need to do domestically to safeguard the lives 
and livelihoods of the American public, part of 
that effort needs to focus on U.S. global lead-
ership to fight this disease and future 
pandemics. 
America remains the world’s most critical 
defender of human rights and prosperity 
around the globe. And that role is needed now 
more than ever. 
Before this pandemic, millions were already 
fleeing war and persecution in countries 
around the world, including the devastating im-
pacts in Syria. And COVID–19 is now a force 
multiplier, increasing the risk of violence, dis-
placement, hunger, and suffering. 
It is crucial that we support the State De-
partment, USAID, the World Health Organiza-
tion, and others on the frontlines responding to 
this pandemic and advancing American inter-
ests around the world every day. 
More emergency funding is needed for the 
International Affairs Budget to support the 
global response to combat this pandemic. 
AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to speak in support of Congress taking 
immediate action to help people and countries 
around the globe to fight the COVID–19 Pan-
demic. I wish to thank my colleagues Dr. BERA 
and Dr. YOHO for organizing this important 
Special Order. The need around the world to 
respond to the COVID–19 pandemic is im-
mense. I and other Members are joining the 
call for Congress to provide twelve billion dol-
lars for international efforts to fight the virus, 
with a specific focus on helping African coun-
tries and multilateral institutions who are on 
the front lines of this crisis. This is a small 
fraction of what we are spending at home, but 
it can make a huge difference in stopping the 
virus around the world. 
Right now, America is hurting from COVID– 
19. Too many families are dealing with the 
suffering and death of loved ones from the 
virus. Many more are struggling to cope with 
an economic crisis unlike any we’ve seen in 
our lifetimes. And while this suffering is wide 
and deep, it’s also deeply unequal. It’s true 
that Coronavirus itself doesn’t discriminate on 
who it infects. But the inequality that has built 
up in our health care system and our economy 
means that Black and Brown people are more 
likely to get sick, and more likely to get sub-
standard care. And people already living on 
the edge of poverty are bearing the worst of 
the economic crisis, unable to telecommute, 
unable to make rent, and last in line to get 
help. 
When so many are suffering at home, it’s 
fair that some people might ask, ‘‘why should 
Congress be looking to help other countries? 
Why shouldn’t we take care of our own first?’’ 
Madam Speaker, that is a false choice. The 
bottom line is that we cannot defeat COVID 
unless the whole world works together. There 
are too many countries that simply lack the re-
sources to tackle the pandemic on their own. 
There is a practical reason why we need to 
help these countries—because if we don’t, we 
run the risk that both this virus and the eco-
nomic shock will fester, creating more risks for 
us here at home. But more importantly, we 
need to help because of the moral imperative, 
the fact that an America that seeks to be just 
and moral needs to play a leading role in mak-
ing sure that every country can weather this 
crisis. America serves both our interests and 
our values when we act in service of our com-
mon humanity. Regardless of what disagree-
ments we might have with particular govern-
ments, it is our mission to make sure that peo-
ple everywhere have basic public health pro-
tections, and a lifeline to whether the eco-
nomic impact of this crisis. 
The good news is, we have a road map for 
how this is done. When in the past, the world 
has faced pandemic challenges, America has 
taken action to contribute to the global effort. 
When HIV and AIDS threatened Africa with 
widespread suffering and demographic dis-
aster, I and many of my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle here in Congress worked 
with the Bush Administration to respond. I am 
proud to have helped author the legislation 
creating both PEPFAR and the Global Fund, 
which have helped to turn the tide on the cri-
sis, providing extensive bilateral and multilat-
eral investment in strengthening health sys-
tems and expanding treatment, as well as 
funding the search for a vaccine. When Ebola 
threatened to overwhelm West Africa, the 
United States mobilized an array of resources 
to respond. In these past crises, America has 
sought to work collaboratively with the global 
community. There is no such thing as a one- 
size-fits-all solution, and it’s important to sup-
port the global institutions, such as the World 
Health Organization and United Nations, that 
help coordinate our international response. 
These organizations don’t just act in ways that 
protect us all, they also help advance our 
shared humanitarian values. They deserve our 
full moral and financial support. 
Madam Speaker, the Coronavirus doesn’t 
stop at the border, nor does its economic and 
moral impact. I urge my colleagues to resist 
the urge to score political points by pulling 
back from shared international efforts and join 
us here in our efforts to help mend the single 
garment of our destiny. I urge my colleagues 
to support a robust international investment in 
fighting COVID–19 and restoring the global 
economy so that it works for all people, here 
at home and around the world.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise in the 
midst of a global pandemic to emphasize im-
portance and need of America’s global leader-
ship to combat COVID–19. I have seen first-
hand in my district in Queens, NY—the epi-
center of the epicenter—that those who were 
the most vulnerable before this crisis, such as 
individuals who were experiencing homeless-
ness or housing instability, economic insta-
bility, or food insecure—are also the most like-
ly to be affected by this pandemic. 
There is a temptation, in this moment of ex-
treme personal suffering, to buy into the di-
chotomy that we can either help Americans or 
we can help our allies. This is a false choice. 
By only focusing on ‘‘flattening the curve’’ in 
America, we not only risk the lives of allies 
and partners in other countries, but we risk a 
resurgence of cases as the global economy 
re-opens. 
As a Member of the House State and For-
eign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee, 
I believe it is more critical than ever to pass 
a robust international affairs budget that sup-
ports the healthcare systems of developing 
countries. Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene pro-
grams, for example, are more critical than 
ever. Vigorously washing our hands has be-
come our new normal in the U.S., but that re-
quires access to a safe, reliable water supply, 
which is not available in many communities 
around the world. 
Americans leadership is not only needed to 
stop the physical spread of the virus, but also 
to deal with its serious, secondary con-
sequences. For instance, crises and emer-
gencies exacerbate cases of domestic vio-
lence; we have already seen this evidence

here at home during this pandemic. Humani-
tarian programs, like the Safe from the Start 
program which I have strongly advocated for, 
supports surges in rapid deployment of senior 
gender advisors to at-risk communities during 
humanitarian emergencies. This type of pro-
gramming seeks to mitigate gender-based vio-
lence and develop ways to include women in 
decision-making processes. With that, I am 
proud to have spearheaded my bipartisan leg-
islation Safe from the Start Act (H.R. 4092)— 
to codify this critical program. 
Madam Speaker, American leadership is 
critical in the global fight against COVID–19; 
without it, this global health crisis will continue 
to devastate countries around the world and 
rebound back to our shores.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. ILHAN OMAR 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. OMAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle 
in recognizing the need for the United States 
to take clear, decisive leadership in a genu-
inely global collaboration to confront the threat 
COVID–19. 
The threat of COVID–19 is truly global—the 
virus does not understand borders or nationali-
ties. Until and unless the virus is contained ev-
erywhere on Earth, it is not truly contained 
anywhere. The United States leads whether 
through action or inaction. We have a respon-
sibility both morally and to our own national 
security to coordinate an international re-
sponse to COVID–19 that meets the enor-
mous challenge it presents. It is a sad state of 
affairs that this White House has preferred 
transparently political international squabbles 
to the type of American leadership the world 
is counting on. 
In Congress, we have been understandably 
focused on our districts and our constituents, 
who are facing job losses, evictions, and the 
closing of their small businesses. We have 
needed to ensure that our health care profes-
sionals have access to the equipment that 
they need, and that our constituents abroad 
could be safely returned home. 
And as we know today that there is still 
much to do on the homefront, the threat of 
COVID–19 in the rest of the world is incredibly 
grave. The Central African Republic has three 
ventilators in the entire country. In Somalia, 
there are 15 ICU beds total. Millions of refu-
gees who have already fled unspeakable bru-
tality and violence now live in camps where 
social distancing is impossible, and there isn’t 
clean water to wash their hands every time 
they’ve touched a potentially contaminated 
surface. In Yemen, where conflict has already 
decimated infrastructure and public health, the 
confirmed cases of COVID–19 cast yet an-
other long shadow on a long-suffering popu-
lation. From Gaza to Guatemala, and from 
Lagos to Lahore, the toll of this disease could 
reach levels still unthinkable. 
It is also important that we remember that it 
is women who are on the front lines, making 
up 70% of global health workers. The United 
States must stand in solidarity with these 
women and other healthcare workers and be 
a global leader in ensuring there is funding so 
that they have supplies and infrastructure to 
do their jobs and the long-term support to ad-
dress mental and physical health issues as a 
result of their response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Not only are women impacted as health 
workers by health systems being overwhelmed 
by the pandemic, but women and girls are 
also facing new and exacerbated barriers in 
access to services, particularly sexual and re-
productive health and gender-based violence 
prevention and response services, services 
that are essential. Pre-existing barriers to es-
sential health services are exacerbated as 
overwhelmed health systems shift their atten-
tion solely to COVID–19 response. Experience 
has shown us that access to sexual and re-
productive health care is critical in a pan-
demic. During the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone, 
reduced access to reproductive healthcare is 
estimated to have caused at least as many 
deaths as Ebola itself. 
We must not turn our back on the world. We 
must put aside our grievances and work to-
ward the common good, to find a common so-
lution. This pandemic is clear, tragic evidence 
that the outlook that favors international co-
operation over isolationism, institutions over 
improvisation, is not just more moral but safer. 
Just as the ravages of this terrible disease 
know no borders, neither must the cure. Our 
national interest and our moral duty are one 
and the same. Now is the time. It is clearer 
now than ever that our destinies are linked, 
and that we are all in this together.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to add my voice to this important special 
order. Let me commend my colleagues, Con-
gressmen AMI BERA and TED YOHO for their 
leadership on global health. 
As a global leader in the international com-
munity, the United States has a duty to sup-
port global health. No one can match our re-
sources, our talent, our infrastructure. 
As chair of the Labor, Health and Human 
Services, and Education Appropriations Sub-
committee, I am proud to fight for global 
health. And, I am proud that in the congres-
sional relief packages we have passed to help 
support the health and economic wellbeing of 
our families and working people, we secured 
vital dollars for global health. In total, at least 
$800 million. This funding is critical because if 
we stop outbreaks abroad, we prevent out-
breaks in the United States. 
But, our work for global health cannot stop 
once we stop this pandemic. 
Let us not lapse in complacency. Instead, 
let us honor the sacrifice of those frontline 
workers fighting to save our humanity, the 
courage of those overcoming this illness, and 
the grief of those who have said goodbye too 
soon. 
Let us invest in global health. Otherwise, we 
risk American health. 
So, once again, I want to thank my col-
leagues for their leadership in raising this im-
portant issue. Let us keep fighting this virus. 
Let us win this battle. And let us make sure in-
vesting in global health is always an American 
priority.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
thank Representatives YOHO and BERA for 
their leadership in hosting this special order 
during a particularly difficult period not only for 
the United States, but the whole world. 
With more than 3 million confirmed cases 
across 185 countries, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has demonstrated that infectious dis-
eases know no borders. They thrive on in-
equality and exacerbate societal schisms. The 
only proven way to avert an unchecked hu-
manitarian disaster is through a united, global 
response. 
During times of crisis, it has been the United 
States that has stepped into the void to pro-
vide a path forward. This is a global moment 
that requires the mantle of bold leadership that 
our nation has assumed in the past. The path 
toward overcoming the specter of COVID–19 
lies not in xenophobia and isolationism, but 
rather an embrace of a coordinated inter-
national response. 
It demands we chart a course for global 
health that extends beyond the urgency of this 
moment into the future; so that we are pre-
pared for whatever challenges lie beyond the 
horizon. This effort requires a multipronged 
approach to global health programs that the 
United States has the capacity and the sci-
entific expertise to lead. 
First, we must help developing countries to 
improve their ability to more effectively combat 
disease. This pandemic has proven once 
again that our health security is only as strong 
as the international community. 
Second, we must recommit to helping the 
tens of millions of people fleeing war, persecu-
tion, and hardship around the world. Refugees 
already suffer from food insecurity and are 
uniquely vulnerable to the devastation of a 
virus like COVID–19. 
And third, we must empower Americans 
serving on the frontlines as we grapple with 
the pandemic. That means providing our dip-
lomats, aid personnel, and servicemembers 
with the resources they need to maintain their 
global operations and provide emergency re-
lief for millions of people around the world. 
We are strongest when we are united with 
our allies against a common foe, and there is 
no more ubiquitous enemy than the scourge of 
a pandemic. This is a moment when the world 
needs American leadership. That is why I call 
on my colleagues to support increased funding 
for the Department of State, USAID, and other 
federal agencies providing essential inter-
national COVID–19 relief. I am also calling on 
the Administration to work closely with our 
international partners and organizations to de-
velop a comprehensive path forward to re-
spond to COVID–19 and provide for our health 
security in the future.

AMERICA’S GLOBAL LEADERSHIP 
DURING COVID–19 
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, while we 
must continue to focus on flattening the curve 
and supporting struggling Americans here at 
home, we must also help combat the spread 
of COVID–19 abroad. The pandemic is just 
beginning in many developing countries in the 
Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. It is 
not hard to imagine a worst-case scenario as 
COVID–19 ravages these fragile nations, par-
ticularly in areas already plagued by conflict 
and extremism. The destabilizing impact that 
the virus will have on economies, government 
institutions, and communities is deeply con-
cerning. 
This is a global pandemic, and the work that 
we do overseas makes us safer here at home, 
too, as this virus continue to spread. Since the 
outbreak began, the U.S. has provided $775 
million to over 100 countries around the world 
to combat the spread of COVID–19. This com-
mitment builds on over two decades of sus-
tained U.S. leadership and investment to 
strengthen health systems and respond to in-
fectious disease outbreaks. In addition, ac-
cording to the State Department, the American 
people, NGOs, faith groups, and the private 
sector have also stepped up to provide an es-
timated $3 billion in donations and assistance 
to save lives around the world. 
However, we must ensure that these vital 
resources are used as effectively and effi-
ciently, as possible. Unfortunately, the Chi-
nese Communist Party continues to cover up 
their culpability—withholding test samples, 
lying about mortality rates, and suppressing 
doctors and journalists from covering the 
facts-and ultimately undermining the global re-
sponse. I support the Trump administration’s 
efforts to insist on transparency and account-
ability. This includes accountability at the 
World Health Organization, which failed to im-
mediately and effectively respond to this glob-
al pandemic. We cannot allow taxpayer re-
sources to go toward organizations that were 
complicit in this cover up until there is ac-
countability. 
Our assistance must not only consider the 
short-term needs of vulnerable populations 
and our partners overseas, but also longer- 
term recovery efforts to generate economic 
growth and opportunity. In this unpredictable 
time, authoritarian regimes, terrorist groups, 
and hostile nation states will try to take advan-
tage of the chaos for strategic gains. The Chi-
nese Communist Party, acting as both the ar-
sonist and the firefighter, is leveraging this 
pandemic to project their power and influence 
through economic dependencies created by 
their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). As African 
nations cry out for much-needed debt relief 
from China’s predatory BRI lending, reports 
are already emerging that China is seeking to 
condition relief on the handover of strategic 
assets, such as copper mining assets in Zam-
bia. 
We must consider the follow-on shocks of 
COVID–19—on 
nascent 
democracies, 
counterterrorism operations, refugee camps, 
vaccination campaigns, education systems, 
food security, and nutrition interventions—as 
existing humanitarian crises, security threats, 
and development challenges are compounded 
and exacerbated. The U.S. must be strategic 
in our investments and adapt and prioritize our 
assistance to prevent further destabilization 
and conflict in the wake of COVID–19. Other-
wise, the cost, in both lives and foreign assist-
ance dollars will be exponential in the long 
run. 
I applaud Representative YOHO and Rep-
resentative BERA for organizing this special 
order and for working across the aisle to ad-
dress this crucial issue. I would also like to 
thank the frontline healthcare workers, both in 
my district and around the world, for their life-
saving work. Finally, I would like to thank the 
NGO community and the U.S. Global Leader-
ship Coalition for their leadership and advo-
cacy.

COVID–19 LANGUAGE ACCESS ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise to high-
light the critical need for translated COVID–19 
outreach materials during this pandemic re-
sponse. We must ensure that language bar-
riers do not prevent individuals from accessing 
vital and potentially life-saving information. 
No one must be left in the dark. Each of us 
must do our part to overcome this unprece-
dented public health crisis. And yet, there are 
over 25 million people across our nation who 
have limited English proficiency. 
That is why I introduced the COVID–19 Lan-
guage Access Act, which would require any 
federal agency that receives coronavirus-re-
lated funding to provide COVID–19 written re-
sources to the public in 19 languages: Span-
ish, Arabic, Cambodian, Chinese, Haitian Cre-
ole, French, Hindi, Italian, Japanese, Korean, 
Laotian, Russian, Tagalog, Urdu, Vietnamese, 
Greek, Polish, Thai, and Portuguese. These 
selected languages are based on the lan-
guages required in the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency’s Language Access Plan 
for Disaster Assistance. 
The CDC already provides language acces-
sibility telephone services in 16 languages and 
some COVID–19–related material in up to 14 
languages. Additionally, the CARES Act re-
quires the SBA to provide resources in 10 lan-
guages. 
Madam Speaker, fighting this pandemic re-
quires the collaboration of everyone. But to do 
so, we must eliminate any language barrier for 
our constituents, so that they are best pre-
pared, informed, and ready to fight against this 
pandemic. I urge my colleagues to support 
this legislation.

RECOGNIZING THE OUTSTANDING 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
OF 
MR. 
PETER KLEIN 
HON. TOM MALINOWSKI 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. MALINOWSKI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Peter Klein, a World 
War II veteran and beloved member of the 
VFW Post No. 335 in Cranford, NJ. 
Mr. Klein is typical of his war time genera-
tion. He is soft-spoken, and self-effacing, 
never bringing up his wartime experiences un-
less you broach the subject first. Even then, 
his humility is an obstacle you must overcome 
to get him to truly discuss his history, and his-
tory is what he does indeed possess. 
In World War Two, Peter Klein was a mili-
tary trained medic. He was armed in battle 
with only his modest medical kit and the 
knowledge he was taught on how to give first 
aid and comfort to those down on the battle-
field of war. His very first opportunity to put his 
expertise to use was a significant one. Mr. 
Klein was in the third wave of the D-Day inva-
sion at Omaha Beach, on June 6, 1944. Rush-
ing off the landing craft, he soon found himself 
knee deep in sand tending to those boys who 
had fallen while machine gun bursts flew 
above his head. 
As if D-Day wasn’t enough, he went on to 
see action during the frigid Battle of the Bulge 
and Hurtgen Forest, in Germany as well. 
These were two of most significant events of 
the latter stages of the war. Mr. Klein undoubt-
edly did his part in fulfilling his obligations to 
the country he loves. 
Coming home after the war, Mr. Klein found 
work as a mason and building inspector, rais-
ing a fine family in the town of Cranford, NJ. 
His wife passed a few years ago and he will 
tell you his life will never be the same. He still 
visits the VFW Post in Cranford on a weekly 
basis, ‘‘shooting the breeze’’ with his veteran 
buddies and enjoying his 97th year of life. To 
the men and women of the VFW post No. 
335, he has always been and will always be 
their ‘‘Pete,’’ a very special veteran. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
recognizing 
the 
extraordinary 
accomplish-
ments of Peter Klein.

INTRODUCTION OF THE HEALTH 
EQUITY 
AND 
ACCOUNTABILITY 
ACT OF 2020 
HON. JESU´S G. ‘‘CHUY’’ GARCI´A 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. GARCI´A of Illinois. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to introduce the Health Equity and Ac-
countability Act of 2020. 
The coronavirus (COVID–19) pandemic is 
disproportionately affecting communities of 
color—including Latino, African American, and 
Asian American communities—who already 
face exacerbated risk factors for health inequi-
ties. This unprecedented public health crisis 
underscores the health disparities and racial 
inequities that have existed in the U.S. health 
care system for many years. Most importantly, 
it points to the need to implement a com-
prehensive and strategic plan to improve the 
health and well-being of communities of color 
through a health equity perspective, which the 
Health Equity Accountability Act (HEAA) puts 
forth. 
HEAA 2020 provides critical federal re-
sources and establishes policies and infra-
structure to eliminate long-standing health in-
equities. It would improve data collection and 
reporting, expand access to health care, build 
more robust telehealth systems, implement

more culturally and linguistically appropriate 
care, and eliminate Medicaid funding limita-
tions for the U.S. territories, among other pri-
orities for the communities we represent. 
For the past 17 years, the Congressional 
Tri-Caucus—comprised of the Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), the 
Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), and the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC)—has 
led to the introduction of the Health Equity and 
Accountability Act (HEAA). 
Since its initial introduction, HEAA has re-
sulted in key legislative proposals that have 
been passed into law—such as the Affordable 
Health Care Act (ACA), the creation of the Of-
fice of Minority Health, the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP), and the Health In-
formation Technology for Economic and Clin-
ical Health Act. 
I urge this body to swiftly pass this legisla-
tion.

HONORING NEAL SMITH AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Neal Edward Smith of Des 
Moines, Iowa—in recognition of his 100th 
birthday—as our Iowan of the Week. 
Neal served our state as ‘the gentleman 
from Iowa’ in the United States House of Rep-
resentatives from 1959 to 1995—the longest 
that any Iowan has ever served in the House. 
As the current representative of Iowa’s 3rd 
Congressional District, which spans much of 
the same area Mr. Smith represented here in 
Washington, I was glad to have the example 
he set to look to when taking office last year. 
As a fifth-generation Iowan, I’ve grown up 
with Mr. Smith’s legacy across our state. 
Whether it’s families using the Neal Smith 
Trail, employees working in the Neal Smith 
Federal Building, folks visiting the Neal Smith 
Wildlife Refuge, or even students studying to 
be a part of next generation of leaders at the 
Neal Smith Law Center at Drake University— 
all of us feel the presence of this Iowa legend 
and newly minted centenarian. 
Mr. Smith honored our country by serving in 
the United States Army Air Forces during 
World War II as a bomber pilot. After his plane 
was shot down, Mr. Smith received a Purple 
Heart, Air Medal, four oak leafclusters and 
nine battle stars for his bravery and heroism. 
After exiting military service, Neal graduated 
both college and law school before entering 
public service, serving as the assistant county 
attorney for Polk County. In 1958, he was first 
elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, 
and he was reelected 17 more times after 
that. 
It is an honor to commemorate Neal’s com-
mitment to public service for his 100th birth-
day, and applaud this ‘gentleman from Iowa’ 
for his hundred years of hard work and dedi-
cation to making Iowa better for everyone. 
Happy birthday, Neal. 
REMEMBERING CHARLES ‘‘CHUCK’’ 
ALAN STRANGE 
HON. DEBBIE LESKO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Charles ‘‘Chuck’’ Alan 
Strange from Surprise, Arizona. 
He was loved by many including his wife, 
Rosie, his three children, Alan, Chris and 
Laura, his two sisters, Barbara and Carolyn, 
and grandchildren and great grandchildren. 
Chuck served honorably in the Army for 21 
years, including as an Army Ranger for 31⁄2 
years in combat in Vietnam. 
During his service, he was awarded: 7 O/S 
Bars—(7) six month deployments overseas; 
Bronze Star Medal with 12t-3rd Oak Leaf 
Cluster; Republic of Vietnam Armed Forces 
Honor Medal; Republic of Vietnam Service 
Medal with one Silver Star and three Bronze 
Stars—5 Campaigns; Army Commendation 
Medal with Oak Leaf Cluster; Air Medal 1st 
and 2nd Awards; Meritorious Service Medal; 
Good Conduct Medal 1st–7th Award; National 
Defense Service Medal; Republic of Vietnam 
Campaign Ribbon with Device 1960; Viet-
namese Cross of Gallantry with Palm and 
Bronze Star; Combat Infantry Badge; Vietnam 
Ranger Badge; and Expert Rifle Badge with 
M–14 Bar. 
He was a member of the Peoria Chamber 
for more than 15 years and served on the 
Board of Directors as well and many other po-
sitions. 
Chuck also served on the Peoria & Surprise 
Regional Chambers and was honored with the 
Lifetime Achievement Award in Surprise. 
He was active in many charities and volun-
teer positions including Luke Air Force Base, 
Military Affairs and the Rio Vista Veterans Me-
morial Wall. 
On this day, we as a community honor him 
and ask those who knew him to pray for his 
family during this time of mourning.

HONORING STEVEN M. DUBINETT, 
M.D. 2019 WILLIAM S. MIDDLETON 
AWARD WINNER 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mr. LIEU of California. Madam Speaker, on 
behalf of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, I would like to extend my heart-
felt 
congratulations 
to 
Dr. 
Steven 
M. 
Dubinett—a pulmonologist, professor, and re-
searcher at the VA Greater Los Angeles 
Healthcare System—in recognition of his life-
saving contributions to the field of oncology 
and lung cancer research. 
The William S. Middleton award is the VA 
Biomedical Laboratory Research and Develop-
ment 
Service’s 
(BLR&D) 
highest 
honor. 
Named for the VA’s chief medical director be-
tween 1955 and 1963, it is reserved for indi-
viduals who have made exceptional contribu-
tions to biomedical and bio-behavioral re-
search that is relevant to the lives of veterans. 
As many people know, the VA Greater Los 
Angeles Healthcare System (VAGLAHS) is a 
beacon in the community and indeed the 
country for high caliber researchers who dedi-
cate their careers to improving the quality of 
life of those who have served. Dr. Dubinett is 
an 
exemplary 
representative 
for 
both 
VAGLAHS and his profession. 
In addition to his admirable dedication to 
service, his work proves the valuable connec-
tion between basic research and real-world 
treatment applications. His research has di-
rectly led to a new treatment regimen and 
immunotherapy trials for lung cancer patients. 
As a veteran, I have worked hard to ensure 
that our nation’s service members are given 
the chance they deserve to succeed. I am al-
ways deeply moved by the work our partners 
do at the VA, in the non-profit sector, and at 
the state and local level to improve outcomes 
for our nation’s veterans. That work—and all 
the headway we have made—is threatened by 
every new case of cancer, our progress un-
dermined each time we fail to beat what has 
claimed the lives of too many veterans at 
home. Simply put, Dr. Dubinett is one of our 
most valuable allies in that fight. 
From his work on in situ vaccination strate-
gies and his research for the National Lung 
Screening Trial, to his membership on philan-
thropic boards and his mentorship of the next 
generation of scientists, the American people 
owe Dr. Dubinett a debt of gratitude. I am 
honored to count him among my constituents.

HONORING IOWA’S HEALTH CARE 
WORKERS AS IOWANS OF THE 
WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, April 28, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, each week, I 
honor an Iowan who has done something out-
standing that deserves to be recognized. I 
started my ‘Iowan Of The Week’ because I 
want to honor our unsung heroes, our every-
day Iowans who leave a positive impact on 
their community not for reward, but because 
that is who they are. I’ve found parents, teach-
ers, and farmers to celebrate each week. 
This week, I ask the House of Representa-
tives to join me in honoring Iowans a little dif-
ferently. I ask you to join me in honoring all 
our health care workers. Our doctors, our 
nurses, our PAs, our RNs, our medical resi-
dents, our hospital administration staff and so 
many more have gone into work each day, 
working tirelessly as this outbreak of COVID– 
19 has spread across this country. They are 
working extra shifts and additional hours, leav-
ing their families at home. They know they 
must work to contain this outbreak while tak-
ing extra precautions to keep themselves and 
their families safe. 
As schools, small businesses, restaurants, 
and more close down to minimize the spread, 
our health care workers know that they will 
never be shut down. They are our first and 
last lines of defense against this outbreak, and 
I know they will see us through it. I’ve spoken 
with many in the health care field this week, 
and I’ve heard how they are being asked to 
cover longer shifts, to conserve medical sup-
plies, and to care for and comfort patients. At 
a time when many Americans are working 
from home and engaging in social distancing,

our health care workers are doing even more 
with less. 
We must remember that no one is born a 
superhero. Our health care workers are ordi-
nary people called upon to do extraordinary 
things. The work they are doing reminds me of 
President Roosevelt’s quote, which goes 
‘‘Courage is not the absence of fear, but rath-
er the assessment that something else is 
more important than fear.’’ Our health care 
workforce is putting the health and wellbeing 
of their communities first. 
Madam Speaker, Iowans are humble and 
we rarely brag or boast, so please allow me 
to boast on their behalf. Our health care work-
ers across Iowa are among the best in the na-
tion, and they are at work protecting the health 
of our communities. When I speak with our 
health care workers, they tell me they are ‘‘just 
doing their job,’’ but that is exactly what 
makes them special. 
I ask the House to join me in honoring 
Iowa’s health care workers as my Iowans of 
the Week. I couldn’t be more proud of these 
men and women for their selfless service dur-
ing this time.
