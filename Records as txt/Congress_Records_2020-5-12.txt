S2357 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MAY 12, 2020 
No. 89 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10:30 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, the fountain of wisdom, 
we cherish Your presence and honor 
Your Name. 
Give our lawmakers the wisdom to 
live with honor, as they remember 
their accountability to history and 
You. Lord, remind them that You are 
glorified when they walk on the path of 
integrity, striving to please You in all 
they say and do. May their lives bring 
light to darkness, unity to division, 
and order to chaos. Lord, grant that 
they will become living letters read by 
those who desire to believe that You 
continue to rule in our world. 
We pray in Your sovereign Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). Under the previous order, 
the leadership time is reserved. 
The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to address the 
Senate for 1 minute in morning busi-
ness. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. COVID–19, as we all 
know, has thrown a wrench into Amer-
ica’s corners of commerce and manu-
facturing, in addition to threatening 
lives and the loss of lives. The unprece-
dented effort to stop the spread has 
shut down life as we know it, closing 
schools, movie theaters, gyms, salons, 
and restaurants in a hysterical ap-
proach to it. 
I always say we have had pandemics 
before, but never have we shut down 
the government, shut down Congress 
the way we have. Our moves have dis-
rupted our food supply chain and pulled 
the rug out from underneath our econ-
omy. Yet, across my home State, Iowa 
businesses and industries stepped up to 
the plate. Ethanol plants, local distill-
eries, and others teamed up to produce 
hand sanitizers for hospitals, nursing 
homes, and local law enforcement. Oth-
ers retooled their factories and redi-
rected their workforce to sew masks 
and produce face shields and other sup-
plies to replenish personal protective 
equipment for our frontline workers. 
Across Iowa, businesses have shown 
there is nothing halfway about the 
Iowa Way. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
our healthcare sector continues to bat-
tle the coronavirus at every level. Doc-
tors, nurses, hospital workers, re-
searchers, and public health leaders are 
working constantly to protect Ameri-
cans and fight this invader. 
Unfortunately, the last 2 months’ 
stoppage of much of our national life 
was never going to permanently extin-
guish the virus. That task will be ongo-
ing. The stated purpose of this effort 
was to prevent a rapid spike that could 
have completely overwhelmed the med-
ical capacities of many areas. The pa-
triotic sacrifices of the American peo-
ple have worked. We have bought our 
healthcare system that breathing room 
we needed. 
As we cautiously move forward, 
major precautions will remain in place. 
Some routines will not go back to nor-
mal for a long time. But as a nation, 
we will need to regroup and find a more 
sustainable middle ground between 
total lockdown and total normalcy. 
Let me say that again. We need to find 
a 
middle 
ground 
between 
total 
lockdown and total normalcy. 
While we keep battling the virus 
through 
testing, 
tracing, 
isolation, 
treatment, and hopefully soon, a vac-
cine, we need to smartly and safely 
begin to reopen our country. If Ameri-
cans want to go back to work and back 
to school in the fall, we will need to re-
open the country. No doubt, there will 
be many discussions here in Congress 
about more ways we can help make 
that happen. 
Already, we are hearing that House 
Democrats are cobbling together an-
other big laundry list of pet priorities. 
Even the media is describing it as a 
partisan wish list with no chance of be-
coming law. That is exactly the wrong 
approach. It is the wrong approach 
when a senior Democrat calls this pan-
demic ‘‘a tremendous opportunity to 
restructure things to fit our vision.’’ It 
is the wrong approach when former 
Vice President Biden calls this tragedy 
an ‘‘incredible opportunity . . . to fun-
damentally transform the country.’’ 
The American people don’t need a 
far-left transformation. They just need 
a path back to the historically pros-
perous and optimistic moment that 
they had built for themselves until 
about 12 weeks ago. The American peo-
ple 
don’t 
need 
a 
far-left 
trans-
formation. They just need a path back 
to the historically prosperous and opti-
mistic moment they had built for 
themselves until about 12 weeks ago. 
American workers don’t need Wash-
ington to inflict some far-left, extreme

S2358 
May 12, 2020 
makeover on our country. They need 
us to get rid of obstacles that might 
stand in their way. One such obstacle 
is becoming obvious. 
A second epidemic of frivolous law-
suits could follow the actual pandemic 
and crush our recovery before it begins. 
Already, more than two-thirds of inde-
pendent business owners say they are 
specifically worried about a legal li-
ability minefield getting in the way of 
reopening. 
Already, lawyers have begun filing 
hundreds of COVID-related complaints 
in courts all across our country. This is 
exactly the kind of hostile environ-
ment that could take our reopening 
and 
recovery 
from 
challenging 
to 
downright impossible. So the Senate is 
going to act. Senate Republicans are 
preparing a major package of COVID- 
related liability reforms to foster our 
economic 
recovery. 
This 
package, 
which Senator CORNYN and I are spear-
heading, will extend significant new 
protections to the people who have 
been on the frontlines of this response 
and those who will be on the frontlines 
of our reopening. 
First and foremost, we are going to 
protect the healthcare workers who 
have been locked in combat with this 
mysterious new disease. We are not 
going to let healthcare heroes emerge 
from this crisis facing a tidal wave of 
medical malpractice lawsuits so that 
trial lawyers can line their pockets. 
We aren’t going to federalize the en-
tirety of medical malpractice law, but 
we are going to raise the liability 
threshold 
for 
COVID-related 
mal-
practice lawsuits. This will give our 
doctors, nurses, and other healthcare 
providers a lot more security as they 
clock in every day and risk themselves 
to take care of strangers. 
Second, we are including new legal 
protections for the businesses, non-
profits, and government agencies that 
have kept serving throughout the crisis 
and for those that will need to lead the 
reopening. 
We are facing the worst layoffs since 
the Great Depression and a storm of 
uncertainty for Main Street businesses. 
Americans want to get back to work, 
and we need to do everything in our 
power to help that happen. 
Also, K–12 schools, colleges, and uni-
versities right now are completely un-
certain about the fall. If we want 
schools to reopen this fall, we will have 
to create the conditions to make that 
possible. If we want schools to reopen 
this fall, we have to create the condi-
tions to make that possible. 
If we want even an outside shot at 
the kind of brisk rehiring that Amer-
ican workers deserve, we have to make 
sure opportunistic trial lawyers are not 
lurking on the sidewalk outside every 
small business in America, waiting to 
slap them with a lawsuit the instant 
they turn the lights back on. 
Our legislation is going to create a 
legal 
safe 
harbor—safe 
harbor—for 
businesses, nonprofits, governments, 
and workers and schools that are fol-
lowing public health guidelines to the 
best of their ability. To be clear now, 
we are not talking about immunity 
from lawsuits. There will be account-
ability for actual gross negligence and 
intentional misconduct. That will con-
tinue. We aren’t going to provide im-
munity, but we are going to provide 
some certainty. If we want American 
workers to clock back in, we need em-
ployers to know that if they follow the 
guidelines, they will not be left to 
drown in opportunistic litigation. We 
are going to make sure it is the trial 
lawyers and not struggling job creators 
who will need to clear a very high legal 
burden. 
In addition, I hope our bill will find 
ways to expand existing protections for 
the 
manufacturers 
of 
therapeutics, 
diagnostics, and potential vaccines— 
things we are urging the private sector 
to produce as fast as possible. And I 
hope we will be able to create new pro-
tections for other medical equipment 
manufacturers, as well, like the poli-
cies we put in the CARES Act to in-
crease the supply of masks. 
So it is all well and good to give rhe-
torical tributes here on the floor to 
healthcare 
professionals, 
essential 
workers, key industries, small busi-
nesses, charities, and nonprofits. Rhet-
oric is well and good. Words matter, 
but actions matter more. Americans on 
the frontlines do not just need Sen-
ators to talk about how important 
they are. They need action. They need 
us to provide the same kinds of com-
monsense legal protections that Con-
gress has enacted a number of times 
previously in difficult or unusual peri-
ods. 
American taxpayers deserve these 
protections as well. The men and 
women of this country just saw Con-
gress commit historic amounts of their 
own money to sweeping recovery legis-
lation so that we could help healthcare 
facilities and small businesses survive 
the crisis. We are not going to stand 
idly by while a small group of wealthy 
lawyers vacuum up this relief money 
and redirect it into their own pockets. 
Strong legal protections are the right 
move for doctors, nurses, hospitals, 
schools, and universities; for workers 
who want their jobs back, for small 
business owners who are struggling to 
stay open, and for nonprofits that have 
helped the vulnerable; and for tax-
payers, who want their money to fi-
nance a real national rescue and not 
the biggest trial lawyer bonanza in 
American history. 
Senate Republicans are going to con-
tinue to develop this legislation. It is 
going to be a redline for us in any fu-
ture coronavirus legislation. The ad-
ministration has already stated its 
support for action on this issue as well. 
American heroes across our country 
deserve these basic protections. This 
Senate majority will make sure they 
get them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, no 
challenge in our lifetime resembles the 
depth of our current challenge. We 
have faced diseases, recessions, and 
natural disasters, but at no time in my 
lifetime has a public health crisis on 
this scale been paired with such an ex-
tensive economic disaster. 
Finally—finally—we are beginning to 
see signs that the spread of this evil 
disease has abated in parts of the coun-
try—not over but at least the curve is 
going down. My home State of New 
York is just beginning to turn the cor-
ner, 
but, 
unfortunately, 
there 
are 
many parts of the country that have 
not yet reached their peak. 
The unemployment rolls are as long 
as they have been since the Great De-
pression. 
Working 
Americans 
are 
struggling to pay rent and put food on 
the table, and many have no idea when 
the next paycheck may arrive. 
It breaks your heart to see people 
waiting for hours in their cars to line 
up at food banks. When they are inter-
viewed by the press, they are people 
who never went to a food bank before. 
That is how deep and troubling this 
crisis is. 
So we in Congress have an obligation 
to do the Nation’s business during this 
time of crisis, to be focusing on this 
crisis, to help the millions of American 
workers 
and 
businesses 
pleading— 
pleading—for assistance. 
The Constitution instructs us to pro-
vide for the common welfare, but at 
this critical juncture in our Nation’s 
history, the Republican leadership, led 
by Leader MCCONNELL, is ducking their 
responsibility, plain and simple. Lead-
er MCCONNELL has yet to schedule any 
legislative business for the floor of the 
Senate this month having to do with 
COVID. 
It has taken sustained pressure from 
Senate Democrats to force our Repub-
lican colleagues to conduct even the 
routine business of holding hearings on 
the coronavirus. We have had a few 
hearings now, but not many. Where is 
the SBA Administrator to talk about 
the problems in PPP? Where is Sec-
retary Scalia to talk about the prob-
lems 
in 
unemployment 
insurance? 
Where are the OSHA executives to talk 
about how we protect workers from 
this pandemic, particularly when they 
are required to go to work? They are 
not around. 
Even the hearings we are having are 
slow. They are sort of eked out like

toothpaste from a tube. The word is we 
are hearing from Mnuchin and Powell 
on the 19th. That is close to 2 months 
after we passed COVID 3. That is not 
oversight. That is not Congress’s job— 
at any time. It is made even worse be-
cause we are in a crisis. 
Then, last night, amazingly, the Re-
publican leader explained that Repub-
licans have ‘‘not yet felt the urgency of 
acting immediately.’’ Let me repeat 
that. With millions of Americans sick 
and tens of thousands dying, with de-
pression levels of unemployment, the 
Republican leader, Senator MCCON-
NELL, said that Republicans have ‘‘not 
yet felt the urgency of acting imme-
diately.’’ 
We live in a divided nation, but one 
thing 
that 
pretty 
much 
everyone 
agrees on is that there is a great deal 
of urgency right now. 
Leader MCCONNELL, there is nothing 
more urgent to a family that is strug-
gling to feed their children and keep a 
roof over their heads. Leader MCCON-
NELL, there is nothing more urgent to a 
small business owner who is inches 
away from closing the doors of his 
life’s work. The Republican leadership 
needs to wake up—wake up—to the dire 
economic reality tens of millions of 
Americans are facing. 
We must pass big, bold legislation to 
confront the crisis before us. That is 
just what the House of Representatives 
is working on right now. We don’t be-
lieve that our two parties will agree on 
everything we must do, but at the very 
least—at the very least—we should 
agree there is an urgency to provide re-
lief to our citizens who are suffering 
and struggling. 
President Hoover lacked the urgency 
to get the Federal Government in-
volved at the outset of the Great De-
pression. Every history book teaches 
us that his error prolonged and likely 
deepened the suffering of American 
workers. When Republican leader looks 
at unemployment numbers and say 
that we don’t need to act immediately, 
that government has done enough al-
ready, they are the latter-day Herbert 
Hoovers, and I fear it could lead to 
similar results, a deeper and longer re-
cession, and—God forbid, but it is not 
out of the question—a second Great De-
pression because of the inaction and in-
competence of the President, being fol-
lowed obediently, wrongly by the Re-
publican Senators. 
The lack of urgency in the Repub-
lican Party extends down Pennsylvania 
Avenue to the Oval Office. From al-
most the very beginning of this crisis, 
President Trump has downplayed its 
severity and tried to wish it out of ex-
istence. 
The President said coronavirus might 
disappear ‘‘miraculously’’—his word. 
He said it was a hoax. He said the warm 
weather might take care of it. He 
pitched quack medicines and specu-
lated that a vaccine could be ready in 
2 months. Two months ago, the Presi-
dent said that ‘‘anybody who wants a 
test can get a test,’’ which is not even 
close to being true. 
The President’s words are reckless— 
constant belittling of the crisis, ignor-
ing the crisis, burying the truth, and 
burying his head in the sand—and it 
has prolonged and made the crisis 
worse, and the American people know 
it. 
That is why he lashes out—the Presi-
dent does—at reporters who ask him 
fair questions. That is why. He knows 
he is to blame for a good part of the 
depth and prolongation of this crisis. 
He knows that. Yet he can’t bring him-
self to face the truth. He can’t bring 
himself to tell the American people the 
truth. Pitching quack medicines, tell-
ing people it is going to go away, say-
ing yesterday ‘‘that we have met the 
moment and we have prevailed.’’ What 
planet is he on? 
More than 30 million are unem-
ployed, and ‘‘we have prevailed’’? There 
are 1.3 million infected and 80,000 
American fatalities, and those numbers 
are still growing. And ‘‘we have pre-
vailed’’? 
The President’s comments show a 
stunning disregard for the truth, and it 
hurts every American. I don’t care 
what your politics is. No one should 
tolerate a President who ignores the 
truth, says whatever pops into his 
head, whether it is true or false or dan-
gerous, and then moves on his merry 
way to speak the next untruth and talk 
about the next quack cure. 
The President’s comments show a 
stunning disregard for the truth. It 
may have been in the Rose Garden and 
not on the deck of a battleship, but 
President Trump saying ‘‘We have pre-
vailed’’ is akin to declaring ‘‘mission 
accomplished’’ long before the battles 
are over and the war is won. 
Later on, the President, as usual, 
tries to correct what he said—or his ad-
visers do. He said he only meant test-
ing, that we have prevailed on testing. 
But that is false too. Even the correc-
tions are false. The United States is 
testing about 300,000 people a day. Most 
experts believe the number is inad-
equate to stop this outbreak and en-
sure that when we reopen, we do so 
safely. We have prevailed on testing? 
Not remotely. 
Here is what is so ironic about the 
President hiding his head in the sand 
and not tackling the testing issue in a 
real way. He is desperate that we get 
back to work, but the only way to get 
back to work is when we have enough 
tests—not just for those who are very 
ill but for anyone who wants it. You 
know, the White House—they all test. 
Anyone who walks in the White House 
is tested. Why isn’t that good enough 
for all the American people? 
Why is it that even in States that 
have opened up, like Georgia, the 
stores are still empty? Because people 
are worried, justifiably. The way to re-
move that worry or at least greatly re-
duce it is to make sure everyone can be 
tested. 
When New Rochelle became the first 
quarantined city, I called the mayor 
and said: What do you need to get rid 
of this quarantine? He said he needed 
enough testing so that he could test 
every person in New Rochelle, and 
those who tested positive, he would say 
they have to quarantine and stay 
home, and those who didn’t could go to 
work and shop in the stores and get our 
community going. 
Most of the countries—I think just 
about every one of the countries that 
has 
dealt 
successfully 
with 
the 
coronavirus has had far more testing at 
the right times and the right places 
than we have. 
Maybe Dr. Fauci can set things 
straight this morning. Dr. Fauci and a 
few other administration officials are 
testifying before the HELP Committee 
remotely. It will be one of the first 
times that Fauci and the others have 
appeared publicly without the Presi-
dent lurking over their shoulders, 
modifying their answers, or directly 
contradicting their advice. 
Dr. Fauci, please don’t pull any 
punches, particularly when you are 
asked questions. We know the White 
House may have to approve the state-
ment you make, and they will mute it. 
It was muted this morning and very 
technical. But you don’t have to do 
that when the questions are asked. 
Don’t pull punches. Tell the American 
people the truth. Dr. Fauci, you have 
an obligation to tell the American peo-
ple the truth because only that will 
save lives and reduce the economic 
length of this crisis. And, Dr. Fauci, 
maybe if you tell the truth in this op-
portunity—a 
hearing 
without 
the 
President looking over your shoulder— 
maybe your testimony, Dr. Fauci—I 
hope 
your 
testimony, 
Dr. 
Fauci, 
reaches not only the American people 
but a President who is ready to throw 
caution to the wind in order to reopen 
the country. Please, Dr. Fauci, don’t 
pull punches. 
f 
TRUMP ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SCHUMER. One final matter 
today. Today, the Supreme Court will 
hear oral arguments in a case that will 
determine whether the President can 
block access to his tax returns and 
other financial documents. 
You may not think this is related to 
COVID, but in a certain sense, it is. In 
a sense, the case about the President’s 
tax returns has something in common 
with 
the 
President’s 
response 
to 
coronavirus: President Trump wants to 
hide the truth. He wants to hide the 
truth about coronavirus and the depth 
of the problem and how we deal with it. 
He wants to hide the truth and not re-
lease his tax returns. 
For 40 years, every President has dis-
closed his personal financial informa-
tion to avoid even the perception of im-
propriety 
or 
self-dealing, 
but 
this 
President has used every avenue to 
deny such transparency. What is Presi-
dent Trump hiding in his taxes? The 
President is not an ordinary citizen 
anymore; he is President of the United 
States. The American people have a

right to see how he has dealt with his 
taxes. President Trump has an obliga-
tion to show them. Why has President 
Trump fought so hard to deny the 
American people this information? 
If this Court wants to prove, at least 
in one step, that they are not highly 
political and don’t always side with 
President Trump, I hope they will step 
up to the plate and rule that the Presi-
dent does not have the unilateral 
power to shield his tax returns from 
the American people. On this issue, 
like so many others, the American peo-
ple deserve the truth—not what the 
President wants us to believe but the 
truth. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

(Mrs.

f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there was a meeting last week—a tele-
phone conference call—of the leaders of 
a dozen major nations around the 
world. It was a meeting to discuss 
something we are all thinking about, 
the answer to the question everyone in 
America asks every day: How will this 
end? When will this end? In this tele-
phone conference, leaders from other 
nations talked about the ending that 
most of us envision—the discovery of a 
safe and effective vaccine that can pro-
tect people around the world from the 
scourge of this coronavirus. 
I am not sure when that vaccine will 
be discovered—the sooner the better— 
but the big question we need to ask 
ourselves at this point is, Where will it 
be discovered, and what benefit will it 
provide for the United States? 
You see, there was one major nation 
that boycotted this international tele-
phone conference about discovering a 
vaccine. It was the United States. 
President Trump decided not to par-
ticipate with the leaders of nations 
from around the world in this global 
conversation about finding a safe and 
effective vaccine to fight coronavirus. I 
am not sure what his motive was. But 
we know that at least 94 other vaccines 
are being explored and worked on in 
nations around the world—in England, 
for example, and in Germany and so 
many other countries. They are look-
ing for the same safe and effective vac-
cine as we in the United States are 
looking for. 
I have great faith and confidence in 
the men and women in medical re-
search in the United States and the 
production facilities in our country, 
but I am not so proud or so vain as to 
believe that no other country could 
find that safe and effective vaccine. 
And if they did—and if they did—would 
we hesitate for a moment to turn to a 
country and say that the United States 
wants to be part of producing that vac-
cine and receiving that vaccine for the 
people who live here? 
Why would the President of the 
United States decide we are going to 
boycott that conference, stay away 
from it? Oh, I am sure he has a dozen 
reasons, but they don’t seem very con-
vincing to me. We should be at the 
table wherever there is a serious, cred-
ible effort to discover a vaccine. The 
United States should be participating. 
They were trying to raise $8 billion. 
That is a lot of money, but remember, 
we are dealing with an effort to rescue 
our economy from coronavirus, which 
is now in the range of $2.8 trillion. 
They are asking the participants to put 
in money. Norway said it would pledge 
$1 
billion—Norway. 
The 
European 
Union said it would pledge $1 billion to-
ward this global vaccine effort. The 
United States should have been at that 
table. We should be all in for any cred-
ible effort to find this vaccine as quick-
ly as possible. I have introduced a reso-
lution calling on the administration to 
reverse its position and to join in this 
effort. 
I want to commend Bill and Melinda 
Gates, who participated in that tele-
phone conference and pledged millions 
of dollars of their own funds on behalf 
of the United States. Thank you to the 
Gates family for caring. 
Now, Mr. President, you should join 
them. 
This morning, the Republican leader 
came to the floor to talk about the 
problems and challenges that we face 
and the fact that there is another bill 
that is going to be offered publicly this 
week by Speaker NANCY PELOSI—the 
next in a succession of legislation that 
we have considered over the last sev-
eral weeks. 
We have seen dramatic investments 
in 
unemployment 
insurance 
for 
a 
record number of unemployed people in 
this country. We have seen dramatic 
investments in the small businesses of 
America, to give them a fighting 
chance to reopen and to prosper in the 
future. I have joined in all of these on 
a bipartisan basis, and I will continue 
to. 
I don’t know the specifics of Speaker 
PELOSI’s proposal. Senator MCCONNELL 
came to the floor and warned us not to 
think big and not to think about trans-
formational things. Then, of course, he 
went back to his time-honored course 
about the question of liability. 
Senator MCCONNELL has come to the 
floor repeatedly—repeatedly—and said 
that before he would consider another 
COVID–19 rescue bill, he would need to 
see what he calls a redline honored 
when it comes to immunity from law-
suits. 
What is being proposed by Speaker 
PELOSI when it comes to State and 
local governments is really an affirma-
tion of what has been said by every one 
of us when it comes to our first re-
sponders, the police, the firefighters, 
the paramedics, the healthcare work-
ers, and the teachers. What she says in 
the bill is that they have been hit and 
been hit hard at the State and local 
government levels by this COVID–19. 
She is proposing, as I understand it, a 
substantial commitment to help those 
units of government that have truly 
been hurt by this coronavirus. What 
she is asking for, really, is whether or 
not 
all 
of 
our 
speeches 
about 
healthcare workers, police, first re-
sponders, firefighters, and teachers are 
really credible and whether, in fact, we 
will come up with the resources that 
are needed. 
Senator MCCONNELL has said that he 
will not support that legislation un-
less—as he calls it—his redline of li-
ability immunity is honored. What he 
is saying is that he refuses to fund our 
police, firefighters, paramedics, and 
teachers unless we provide guaranteed 
business immunity for corporations. 
This is, sadly, an invitation for irre-
sponsible corporations and businesses 
to cut corners when it comes to pro-
tecting workers and those customers 
and such who would be threatened by 
coronavirus. 
The McConnell redline threat would 
result in more people being infected by 
the coronavirus and more people get-
ting sick. That is not what we want. 
There is a better way. We should be 
talking about how to do this properly. 
This afternoon there will be a hear-
ing before the Senate Judiciary Com-
mittee. One of the witnesses being 
called by the Republicans is a man 
named Kevin Smartt. He is the chief 
executive officer and president of Kwik 
Chek food stores in Bonham, TX. He is 
testifying on behalf of the National As-
sociation of Convenience Stores on this 
question of liability. 
I read his statement this morning in 
preparation for the hearing, and I com-
mend it to my colleagues because I 
want them to listen carefully to what 
Mr. Smartt says he believes businesses 
need. Here is what he says. He talks 
about his own company Kwik Chek. 
Kwik Chek’s first priority is the safety of 
our employees and customers. Beginning in 
early March, we adjusted our daily protocols 
to mitigate the spread of the virus. This was 
a challenge— 
Listen to what Mr. Smartt says— 
because the guidance provided by the CDC, 
the Occupational Safety and Health Admin-
istration, as well as State and local govern-
ments, often conflicted with one another in 
addition to being vague and difficult to fol-
low. Yet despite many uncertainties, includ-
ing the constantly fluctuating public health 
guidelines, we began to adjust to the pan-
demic. 
Mr. Smartt is not saying that busi-
nesses don’t have a responsibility here. 
He is accepting that responsibility to 
create a safe environment for workers 
and customers, but he is saying to us: 
When are you going to establish the 
standards? Why do you keep changing 
the standards? 
Here we are with Senator MCCONNELL 
threatening to derail the next rescue

May 12, 2020 
bill for police, firefighters, and teach-
ers across America, unless there is 
guaranteed immunity from lawsuits, 
and here is one of the leading compa-
nies, the No. 1 primary witness of the 
Republicans in the Senate Judiciary 
Committee hearing, saying to the Fed-
eral and governments: Establish stand-
ards, reasonable standards, for us to 
live up to when it comes to conducting 
business, and we will do it. 
I think that is a reasonable request 
by his business. Why aren’t we doing 
it? 
Why 
hasn’t 
OSHA 
established 
standards for the safety of workers? 
One of our other witnesses here is 
this gentleman who is the head of the 
United Food and Commercial Workers, 
Marc Perrone. I have a special fondness 
for this union because when I was a 
college kid, I spent 12 months working 
in a slaughterhouse in East St. Louis, 
IL, and it was this union that I be-
longed to back in those days. 
It was tough, dirty, and dangerous 
work. I look to it as an important 
chapter in my life, when I saw how real 
people go to work every day and many 
times risk their safety and their health 
in doing it. 
Marc Perrone tells us there are lit-
erally thousands of his meat processing 
workers who have been affected by this 
virus and 95 of his members who have 
died as a result of it. What he is look-
ing for—what we are looking for—is for 
those companies to establish standards 
of safety for their workers so that they 
can go back to work in this important 
business. 
Some are doing just that. I commend 
them. Some are working with the 
union to find safe ways to test their 
workers and to bring them back to a 
job site that is safe for them to work 
in. But they don’t have a national 
standard to live up to. We haven’t es-
tablished a national standard, as we 
should. Whether through OSHA or 
through CDC, we ought to establish 
standards for businesses across this 
country to live up to. I believe many— 
Mr. Smartt with Kwik Chek and Marc 
Perrone with the United Food and 
Commercial Workers—would applaud 
that. They would say: At least we know 
what social distancing standards are to 
be used in the workplace. At least we 
know what protective equipment is re-
quired in the workplace to protect our 
employees. At least we know going 
into this exactly what the standards 
are that we need to live up to. 
Senator MCCONNELL’s approach is im-
munity from lawsuits; don’t establish 
any standards and don’t hold anybody 
to any standards at all. That is wrong. 
The net result of that is that more peo-
ple would be in danger, more people 
would be infected, and more people 
would die. That is not the right ap-
proach. 
What we need to do is to make cer-
tain that when this is all said and 
done, we have a smart approach to 
this; that a business that is conscien-
tious, cares for its customers, and 
cares for its workers has standards to 
live by and that they can meet reason-
able standards that have been thought 
through from a public health view-
point. 
It is no wonder that there is uncer-
tainty when you look at the situation 
today. The Centers for Disease Control 
suggests voluntary standards, sugges-
tions. The White House accepts some, 
publishes some, scoffs at others, and ig-
nores others. There is just no clear 
message 
to 
businesses 
and 
people 
across America on what the standards 
of safety will be. 
So I would say that this hearing this 
afternoon is important to hear from 
Mr. Smartt and his willingness to look 
for standards that he can live by, and 
to hear from Marc Perrone about the 
dangers to his workers across the 
workplace. And don’t believe for a 
minute that this caravan of lawsuits 
threat that we hear over and over tells 
the whole story. 
When you take a look at the lawsuits 
that have been filed, it is not just the 
so-called caravan of trial lawyers that 
are coming in and jumping on this. 
There are businesses suing businesses. 
There are lots of lawsuits that have lit-
tle or nothing to do with personal in-
jury. There are also lawsuits involving 
workers’ compensation. 
Senator MCCONNELL’s suggestion is 
that we overturn the State laws that 
give workers the right to recover in the 
workplace if their injuries and or their 
health is impaired because of the 
COVID–19 virus. What a terrible out-
come that would be to walk away from 
decades of established protection for 
workers in every State in the Union, 
for Senator MCCONNELL’s so-called red-
line threat when it comes to the 
COVID virus No. 4 bill that Speaker 
PELOSI is proposing. 
There is a reasonable answer here. 
We can say to these businesses across 
America: Join us in the fight. Let’s 
stand together. You protect your work-
ers, you protect your customers, and 
we will stand by you. We will establish 
a reasonable standard of conduct for 
you, which will protect you from frivo-
lous lawsuits. But to take the approach 
by Senator MCCONNELL, saying that we 
just are going to guarantee immunity 
from lawsuits, is exactly the wrong 
thing to do. We need a standard of safe-
ty that businesses can be proud of, that 
workers can respect, and that cus-
tomers can count on so that they can 
go into places, do their business, buy 
the products, and know that there is a 
standard of good health that is being 
established for everyone. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, my 
home State of Texas is a great place to 
do business. We keep taxes, govern-
ment spending, and regulations at a ra-
tional minimum in order to give people 
and businesses the freedom to pursue 
their dreams and prosper. Texas is con-
sistently ranked on the list of the 
‘‘Best States for Business,’’ the ‘‘Best 
States to Start a Business,’’ and the 
‘‘Best 
States 
for 
Female 
Entre-
preneurs.’’ 
According to the Small Business Ad-
ministration, there are more than 2.6 
million small businesses throughout 
the State, accounting for 99.8 percent 
of all Texas businesses. Those busi-
nesses employ nearly half of our 
State’s workforce and account for the 
massive portion of our Texas economy. 
To say that the small businesses are 
an economic force in Texas would only 
paint half the picture. In big cities and 
in small towns alike, these businesses 
play a critical role in our commu-
nities—the locally owned restaurants 
and bars we visit, the gyms that are 
part of our regular routine, the dry 
cleaners, the pharmacies and the hard-
ware stores we stop at when we run er-
rands. But our small businesses aren’t 
just employers or generators of sales 
tax. They are owned by our friends and 
our neighbors and are part of the very 
fabric of our community. 
Right now, they are under severe 
stress 
and 
in 
real 
jeopardy. 
The 
coronavirus has kept Texans at home 
and put our small businesses into seri-
ous financial trouble. When stay-at- 
home orders were put in place, many 
were forced to close their doors out-
right. Over the last several weeks, like 
many of my colleagues, I have held in-
numerable 
video 
conferences 
with 
chambers of commerce, small business 
owners, and others who have told me 
about the difficult decisions they have 
been forced to make in the wake of this 
virus. 
Without any demand, without an op-
portunity to sell their services or the 
food or other material they provide, 
they had to lay off employees or reduce 
their pay, and some were more con-
cerned that they couldn’t survive more 
than a few weeks because they still had 
to pay the rent and their overhead. 
Those struggles are familiar for busi-
nesses across the country, and that is 
why 
we, 
together—literally, 
unani-
mously, in the Senate—created the 
Paycheck Protection Program. This 
new loan program was designed to help 
America’s small businesses and their 
employees manage these uncharted 
waters by providing 8 weeks of cash 
flow assistance to cover payroll and 
other business-related expenses. 
As we now know, it was so popular 
and so needed that the initial $350 bil-
lion we funded ran out in less than 2 
weeks. From that batch of funding bill, 
Texas received more loans than any 
other State. Nearly 135,000 small busi-
nesses benefited from the Paycheck 
Protection Program—a sum total of

28.5 billion. That is just from the first 
$350 billion we appropriated. It became 
obvious that there was more demand 
than supply, and so we had to then re-
plenish the program with an initial 
$320 billion. So far, $670 billion has 
gone into the Paycheck Protection 
Program. These are astronomical num-
bers, but, obviously, the need was seri-
ous, and this appears to be meeting a 
very real need to keep these businesses 
afloat, along with their employees. 
Since our small businesses have got-
ten these funds, there is no shortage of 
stories about the positive impact they 
have had in my State, and I am sure 
each of us can tell similar stories. 
One of the recipients of a PPP loan is 
Sevy’s Grill, which has been a favorite 
in Dallas for more than two decades. 
Like 
other 
restaurants 
throughout 
Texas, the stay-at-home order put 
them in a very tough financial spot, 
and the restaurant closed in March 
without an end in sight. Then a lifeline 
came in the form of the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program. 
A Facebook post from the restaurant 
read: ‘‘We are blessed to be a part of 
the Paycheck Protection Program to 
help fund our comeback.’’ 
They reopened at the end of April 
with a ‘‘Valet-to-Go’’ program, just in 
time to celebrate their 23rd anniver-
sary last Friday and Mother’s Day over 
the weekend. 
There is also another company called 
JuiceLand, an Austin-based company 
with locations in Dallas and Houston 
as well. Matt Shook is the founder and 
CEO. He says they were preparing for a 
busy spring, but instead of having their 
nearly three dozen locations full of cus-
tomers, he had to close 25 stores and 
lay off 300 employees. He said: ‘‘Every 
day it’s like being at a poker table and 
getting bad hands every hand.’’ 
But Matt was then dealt with a few 
good cards. JuiceLand received its Pay-
check Protection Program loan. He 
began to reopen the stores and to hire 
back his employees. He said that this 
loan is going to be the difference in 
keeping his company afloat. 
The businesses that have received 
these loans were in danger of drowning 
until Congress, working together in a 
bipartisan way, threw them a lifeline. 
But now they are facing another risk 
that could bring a second wave of dev-
astation and danger. Across the coun-
try, we are starting to see coronavirus- 
related litigation filed by the hundreds 
of cases—patients or their families 
suing doctors, students suing univer-
sities, employees and customers suing 
businesses—and this is just the begin-
ning. As more States begin to restart 
their economies, we can expect a tidal 
wave of lawsuits to follow. 
And while there is and should abso-
lutely be legal recourse for those with 
legitimate claims, there are serious 
concerns about the number of frivolous 
claims and nuisance lawsuits we are 
expecting to see. 
Imagine you are the owner of a small 
restaurant. Once stay-at-home orders 
were put in place, you did it the way 
you were asked, and you tried to keep 
your business going and your employ-
ees on payroll. You received a PPP 
loan, which helped you and your work-
force survive until you could reopen 
your doors. And once that happened, 
you took every precaution and followed 
every guideline to protect your em-
ployees and your customers. 
You did your best to follow all gov-
ernment guidelines and regulations to 
a T. You stayed in close communica-
tion with your employees about their 
health and required anyone who was 
not feeling well to stay home. Your 
employees wore masks and gloves and 
had their temperatures checked at the 
start of each shift. You did your best to 
clean high-touch surfaces, maintained 
social distancing in the restaurant, and 
had hand sanitizer available for cus-
tomers and employees. But then you 
find out you are being sued because 
someone claims that they contracted 
the virus at your place of business and 
they claimed that it happened because 
of your negligence and either you knew 
or you should have known. The legal 
nightmare you are about to enter could 
have your business filing for bank-
ruptcy by the end of the year, even if 
the claim proved to be without merit. 
The expense and the time and the ef-
fort that we want people putting back 
into the business to help rebuild our 
economy—they are going to have to 
use that to defend a nuisance lawsuit 
and perhaps pay money just so they 
don’t have to continue to pay a lawyer 
to defend them in court. 
Without action in this Congress, this 
is going to be a familiar story for small 
business owners, doctors, nurses, first 
responders—anyone and everyone who 
could potentially be blamed for an-
other person contracting the virus. 
We are all familiar with those who 
are ready to jump at the opportunity 
to file a suit over this and similar mat-
ters, whether or not their case has legs. 
You can imagine the TV ads and the 
highway billboards we will see encour-
aging you to call some 1–800 number if 
you 
have 
been 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus, only to be connected with 
a lawyer to file a lawsuit—again, re-
gardless of merit. 
Let me be clear. As a recovering law-
yer myself, I don’t think all lawyers 
are bad, but we do know there are 
venal people who will take advantage 
of the opportunity. 
Again, let me just say I have no 
doubt there have been and will be le-
gitimate lawsuits targeting bad actors. 
If there is willful or reckless disregard 
for the person affected, they should 
have every right to sue and be made 
whole. But we need to take action 
against these frivolous lawsuits tying 
up our courts, bankrupting our busi-
nesses, and discouraging our economy 
from reopening. 
This is not without some precedent. 
In the past, Congress has provided 
similar protections for businesses and 
workers who followed guidelines and 
acted in good faith. For example, there 
was the Volunteer Protection Act of 
1997, which provided legal protection 
for volunteers who worked at non-
profits. There was the Y2K Act of 1999, 
which gave protections to businesses if 
they followed government guidelines in 
good faith with regard to Y2K com-
puter glitches. There was the Coverdell 
Teacher Protection Act of 2001, which 
gave protection to teachers and edu-
cators. 
It is simply time for Congress to once 
again exercise our constitutional au-
thority to provide reasonable liability 
protections for employers and workers 
who are operating in good faith and fol-
lowing government and public health 
guidelines. 
There is no effort to allow bad behav-
ior or protect those who are grossly 
negligent, period. In fact, if you think 
about it, providing a safe harbor for 
those businesses that follow public 
health and government guidelines will 
actually encourage them to do so, 
which will actually further protect the 
public and their employees. 
The types of liability limitations my 
colleagues and I are interested in pro-
viding would simply prevent frivolous 
and nuisance lawsuits from harassing 
our frontline healthcare workers and 
small businesses which were acting 
reasonably and complying in good faith 
with health guidelines. 
If you are a business owner debating 
whether to reopen once you are able, 
this lawsuit frenzy could be the decid-
ing factor. You may just decide to 
throw in the towel, and we all would be 
losers, not the least of whom would be 
the employees who get their jobs from 
that employer. 
Would you risk a potential lawsuit 
that would tie you up in courts for 
months, if not years, on end and bank-
rupt your business even though you are 
prepared to follow health guidance? 
Well, I think many will not be inclined 
to open up under those circumstances. 
Without limiting liability for our 
small business owners and workers, our 
economic recovery will be stunted as a 
result of the fear of the negative im-
pact of these frivolous lawsuits. That is 
the situation we need to address and 
prevent. 
Congress has taken unprecedented 
steps to strengthen our Nation’s re-
sponse to the coronavirus and mini-
mize the economic fallout, and we have 
done that together. The tidal wave of 
lawsuits that could come and will come 
unless we act to limit that liability 
will undo every bit of progress we tried 
to make. We can’t allow our doctors 
and nurses and first responders and 
small businesses to survive the pan-
demic, only to find themselves battling 
a second crisis in the courtroom, an ex-
istential crisis. 
In order to strengthen our response 
to this pandemic, we must protect 
those who are doing everything in their 
power to keep us safe while following 
the guidelines their government pro-
vides them, and we need to keep them

CORONAVIRUS 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak about the unprece-
dented crisis our Nation is facing. In a 
matter of just a few months, COVID–19 
has completely changed our daily lives. 
This virus has forced us to close 
schools, shut down restaurants, cancel 
major events, and temporarily shutter 
businesses across our economy. 
The sacrifices have been necessary 
for the sake of public health, to help 
‘‘flatten the curve’’ so our medical fa-
cilities don’t become overwhelmed, but 
they have also been disruptive, frus-
trating, and in some cases, scary. 
Despite the emotional and economic 
toll this crisis has taken, we have seen 
countless acts of compassion, gen-
erosity, and selflessness all across the 
country. Americans have stepped up to 
help each other to fight this new 
threat. 
I want to make sure the American 
people know that since the very begin-
ning of this crisis, Nebraskans have 
been on the frontlines. 
When 13 Americans were evacuated 
from a cruise ship in Japan in late Feb-
ruary, they were taken to the National 
Quarantine Unit at the University of 
Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. As 
the Nation’s only Federal quarantine 
unit, they were also trusted to care for 
Americans recovering from Ebola in 
2014. 
Beyond treating those exposed to or 
infected with coronavirus, UNMC is 
also working to test new treatments 
for this virus. In late February, the Na-
tional Institutes of Health announced 
that the country’s first clinical trial 
for coronavirus therapy had begun at 
UNMC. 
Our world-class medical center has 
been active from the very beginning of 
this crisis. 
The Nebraska National Guard—our 
citizen soldiers—has also played an im-
portant role in our response. They have 
been deployed as distributors at food 
banks, as healthcare workers assisting 
with testing, and as drivers bringing 
ventilators to where they are most 
needed. 
One of the first State Department 
evacuation flights out of China brought 
57 Americans to Nebraska, where they 
were quarantined at Camp Ashland, a 
Nebraska National Guard training site. 
It is easy to forget that these first 
evacuations happened just back in Feb-
ruary. Since that time, we have relied 
on our amazing healthcare workers and 
first responders. These heroes have 
been working around the clock to keep 
all of us safe. They get up every day to 
fight this virus in hospitals and in clin-
ics across this country. I can’t imagine 
how hard it must be for them to see the 
effects of this new sickness day in and 
day out. Yet I know we are in good 
hands. 
We have also relied on our food he-
roes, many from my home State, where 
one in four jobs is tied to production 
agriculture. If you raise cattle or grow 
soybeans, you can’t stay inside and 
work from your couch. If you package 
beef or pork, you can’t work from a 
laptop. Americans should be incredibly 
grateful for our essential workers 
throughout the food supply chain. 
They are working so that we can con-
tinue to put healthy, safe food on our 
tables. 
Nebraskans and all Americans are 
making daily sacrifices to slow the 
spread of this virus. We have dras-
tically reduced our contact with oth-
ers, knowing that short-term sacrifice 
will lead to long-term public health. 
But despite our best efforts, over 8,000 
Nebraskans have contracted the virus, 
and 96 have died since COVID–19 ar-
rived in the United States. These peo-
ple were loved by their families and by 
their communities. I grieve for their 
loved ones. These tragic losses under-
score the seriousness of this virus. 
They demonstrate to all of us that we 
need to keep up the fight. 
The changes we have made in our na-
tional life, while necessary, have been 
difficult. They have come at the cost of 
the economic security of many people 
in the heartland of this Nation. We are 
seeing record numbers of unemploy-
ment claims, and many people who 
have never faced unemployment before 
now find themselves out of work. More 
Nebraskans are now dealing with food 
insecurity due to unemployment and 
the effects of COVID–19. 
I have been inspired by the work non-
profits across my State are doing to 
address this. 
The local chapter of the Salvation 
Army in Hastings has started a mobile 
food unit, which they drive from neigh-
borhood to neighborhood, and they 
serve hot meals. 
The Central Nebraska Community 
Action Partnership has begun to box up 
food and leave it on people’s doorsteps. 
This has allowed them to reduce per-
son-to-person contact while helping 
those who are in need. 
The Food Bank of Lincoln, which 
serves Southeast Nebraska by acting as 
a distribution center for food pantries 
in 16 counties, has seen a huge surge in 
demand. They have been able to keep 
up with this demand in large part 
thanks to the innovation of a partner-
ship of Lincoln business, philanthropy, 
and government leaders, who together 
formed the Lincoln COVID–19 Response 
Fund. 
These are major problems, and there 
is no easy fix. Even so, it is our job in 
Congress to respond to this national 
crisis and do what we can to provide re-
lief. That is why I was proud to support 
the CARES Act, the relief package this 
body passed unanimously at the end of 
March. 
A big part of this legislation was the 
Paycheck Protection Program, which 
was designed to help America’s small 
businesses keep their employees on 
payroll by offering forgivable loans. 
Upon the creation of this program to 
provide relief, Nebraskans hit the 
ground running. By mid-April, the Pay-
check Protection Program had pro-
vided nearly 25,000 loans worth just 
under $3 billion to Nebraska’s small 
businesses. This funding was enough to 
cover more than three-fourths of Ne-
braska’s eligible payrolls—the highest 
percentage in the Nation. 
I think it is important to note that 
none of this would have been possible 
without Nebraska’s community banks 
and our credit unions. While some na-
tional 
banks 
hesitated, 
Nebraska’s 
local institutions stepped up to provide 
these loans and make sure small busi-
nesses in their communities received 
assistance. 
To our community banks and credit 
unions, Nebraskans applying for these 
loans are not just statistics halfway 
around the country. The people hurting 
are their friends, their families, and 
their neighbors. The people who need 
their help live just down the street. 
One of these banks is Union Bank & 
Trust in Lincoln. This family-owned 
bank is not in the top 200 banks by as-
sets nationally, but after the first 72 
hours of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, they ranked second in the Na-
tion for the number of loans approved. 
Like many other lending institutions, 
Union Bank & Trust accomplished this 
while adjusting to working from home 
for the first time. Their remarkable ef-
forts and those of another Nebraska in-
stitution, Pinnacle Bank, were covered 
in a recent Washington Post story for 
leading the way nationally with this 
program. 
It is good to see the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program working well in my 
State. I am pleased that Congress came

together to further fund this program 
so that more small businesses can re-
ceive assistance. The drive to support 
one another, help out, and deliver relief 
to others is something we are seeing all 
across my State. 
Along with grief, we have seen resil-
ience. Along with sadness, we have 
seen hope. 
I read a story about young children 
in Omaha who wanted to visit their 
grandfather. They couldn’t go into his 
nursing home, so they connected a 
microphone to a speaker inside so that 
they could talk to him and sing to him. 
I have seen schools that stopped 
holding in-person classes weeks ago 
still serving their students. 
On top of instituting remote learn-
ing, many are also offering free meals. 
In Gering, teachers organized an im-
promptu drive-by parade through their 
students’ neighborhoods. 
In Hastings, Longfellow Elementary 
School has converted old newspaper 
vending machines into learning mate-
rial dispensers. Students walk up to 
the dispenser for their grade level, and 
they take out their weekly learning 
packet, just as you would a newspaper. 
In short, I have seen neighbors help-
ing neighbors. I have seen Nebraskans 
helping Nebraskans. 
Much remains uncertain about our 
future. We don’t know how many more 
lives will be lost, how long we are 
going to have to wait for a vaccine, or 
how long it will take for Main Street 
to fully open for business once again. I 
think we may have a long and tough 
road ahead of us, but I take great pride 
in the way Nebraska has responded to 
these difficult circumstances. 
The inspiring stories of kindness and 
humanity in my State don’t come as a 
surprise to me. 
I have seen our people respond to 
other disasters, including the wide-
spread flooding that we faced just last 
year. I have seen Nebraskans respond 
the same way to COVID–19 as we did to 
that flood—by putting others first. It is 
just who we are. 
Nebraskans will continue to adapt, to 
help others, and to lead the way in ad-
dressing and responding to this crisis. 
We will get through this, and we will 
come out stronger than ever before. 
NOMINATION OF BRIAN D. MONTGOMERY 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I 
will vote to oppose the nomination of 
Mr. Brian Montgomery to serve as Dep-
uty Secretary for the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development. My 
vote today is not because I believe Mr. 
Montgomery is incapable of doing the 
job. Across multiple administrations, 
Mr. Montgomery has shown himself to 
be a dedicated public servant with an 
impressive understanding of the pro-
grams and policies he would oversee if 
confirmed. During prior administra-
tions, Mr. Montgomery demonstrated 
his commitment to HUD’s mission and 
helped respond to the early days of the 
financial crisis. And over the past year, 
Mr. Montgomery has done important 
work 
strengthening 
HUD’s 
reverse 
mortgage program. 
But I will vote against Mr. Montgom-
ery’s nomination today because, like 
too many people in this administra-
tion, over the last 2 years he has helped 
advance policies that will have dev-
astating effects for millions of fami-
lies. In addition to his role as Federal 
Housing Commissioner and Assistant 
Secretary 
for 
Housing, 
Mr. 
Mont-
gomery began performing the duties of 
the Deputy Secretary at HUD nearly a 
year and a half ago. Since that time, he 
was involved in the decision to advance 
a revised disparate impact rule that 
the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights 
wrote that it was very concerned would 
‘‘impose substantial new obstacles for 
victims of discrimination’’ and ‘‘under-
mine the protections of the Fair Hous-
ing Act, thereby substantially under-
mining necessary civil rights protec-
tion in an area about which the Com-
mission and its state advisory commit-
tees continue to receive compelling 
evidence of need for meaningful federal 
corrective action.’’ 
Mr. Montgomery also helped advance 
HUD’s Housing Finance Reform Re-
port, which would increase the cost of 
an FHA-backed loan for those who can 
least afford it, restructure FHA in a 
way that could undermine HUD fund-
ing, and restrict consumers’ choice be-
tween an FHA and Fannie Mae or 
Freddie Mac-backed loan. But when 
confronted with questions about these 
issues that are critical to low- and 
moderate-income families, Mr. Mont-
gomery offered little explanation. 
Throughout Mr. Montgomery’s time 
performing the duties of the Deputy 
Secretary—the No. 2 person at HUD— 
HUD’s budget requests have repeatedly 
zeroed out critical housing and commu-
nity development accounts, like the 
community developmental block grant, 
HOME investment partnerships, and 
public housing capital funds, while pro-
posing to raise rents for the lowest in-
come renters. When asked to justify 
these disastrous proposals, Mr. Mont-
gomery again offered no explanation. 
Our Nation is facing an affordable 
housing crisis and a crisis of equity 
across our housing system. Before 
COVID–19 hit, there was a nearly 30- 
point gap between the Black and White 
home ownership rates, and more than 
one in four renters paid more than half 
of their income for housing. With 
COVID–19’s economic devastation dis-
proportionately burdening the lowest 
income households and communities of 
color, these challenges will only grow. 
We need leaders at HUD who will 
fight for our housing and community 
development programs and the families 
who depend on them. We need leaders 
at HUD who will push for progress and 
equality in our Nation’s housing sys-
tem, regardless of race, disability, or 
family status. We need leaders at HUD 
who will advance proposals that sup-
port, not further burden, the lowest in-
come families. Mr. Montgomery has 
not shown us a record of fighting for 
those priorities, and that is why I can-
not support his nomination today.

ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous 
consent 
that 
notwith-
standing the provisions of rule XXII, 
the postcloture time on the Edgar 
nomination expire at 4:30 p.m. today. I 
further ask that if confirmed, the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table and the Presi-
dent be immediately notified of the 
Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, we 
are back for our second week in the 
Senate after spending some time work-
ing 
remotely 
to 
help 
flatten 
the 
coronavirus curve. We are getting used 
to the temporary new normal—social 
distancing during hearings, floor votes, 
and meetings; masks; a lot of con-
ference calls and Skype calls instead of 
in-person meetings; lots of hand wash-
ing and hand sanitizer; and as many 
staff working remotely as possible. We 
are committed to doing the essential 
work of the American people, and they 
are depending on us to do it in the 
safest way possible. 
Responding to the coronavirus con-
tinues to be at the top of the agenda. 
Last week, we held a number of 
coronavirus-related hearings, including 
a hearing on coronavirus testing and a 
hearing on the impact the pandemic 
has had on the airline industry. 
When people think about what the 
Senate does, they tend to think about 
voting on bills and debating on the 
floor, but the truth is, committee work 
is some of the most important work we 
do here in Washington. Committees are 
where we review nominees’ qualifica-
tions, hear from experts in various 
fields, develop legislation, and conduct 
essential oversight of government pro-
grams. The work we do in coronavirus- 
related committee hearings will inform 
any future coronavirus legislation we 
might consider. 
This week, the Senate Banking Com-
mittee will be voting on the nomina-
tion of Brian D. Miller to be Inspector 
General for Pandemic Recovery at the 
Treasury Department. If he is con-
firmed by the full Senate, Mr. Miller 
will be an essential part of ensuring 
that the trillions we have provided for 
coronavirus relief are spent properly. 
The Banking Committee will also be 
holding an oversight hearing with key 
Federal financial regulators to learn 
about the steps they have taken to en-
sure the safety and soundness of our fi-
nancial sector during this challenging 
time. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee will 
be examining the issue of liability dur-
ing the COVID pandemic and dis-
cussing ways to prevent frivolous law-
suits from damaging our economy once 
we reopen. 
The Senate Commerce Committee, of 
which I am a member, will be holding 
a hearing looking at efforts to main-
tain and expand reliable high-speed 
broadband access during this time 
when so many Americans are relying 
on their internet for work, school, and 
connections with friends and family. 
The 
Senate 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions Committee will be 
hearing directly from the leaders of our 
fight against the coronavirus—Drs. 
Fauci, Redfield, and Hahn, and Admiral 
Giroir. Senators will be talking to 
these experts about what we need to do 
to safely reopen our economy and our 
schools. 
Another big part of our coronavirus 
response right now is monitoring the 
implementation of the funds we have 
already provided. We have delivered a 
tremendous amount of money to re-
spond to the pandemic—equal to al-
most 50 percent of the entire Federal 
budget for 2020—and it is important 
that any future funding be carefully 
targeted. 
We are facing extraordinary cir-
cumstances, and they call for an ex-
traordinary, bold response from Wash-
ington, but it is important to remem-
ber that every dollar of the trillions we 
provided for the pandemic is borrowed 
money, and our children and grand-
children are going to be paying for that 
borrowing. That doesn’t mean we are 
not going to provide more money if 
necessary, but it does mean we need to 
make sure we are spending money 
wisely and well and only appropriating

what is really needed. That means 
monitoring the implementation of the 
funds we have already provided, which 
haven’t been fully spent yet. Once we 
see how and where those funds are get-
ting spent, we will have a better sense 
of where we have spent sufficiently and 
where more money may be necessary. 
It is also important that we make 
sure those funds are being spent in the 
most effective and efficient way pos-
sible. Again, these are all dollars that 
our children and grandchildren will 
have to pay for. We want to make sure 
we are not wasting any of that money. 
Finally, while coronavirus will, of 
course, continue to be at the top of our 
agenda, there are other important 
things we have to do to keep the gov-
ernment running and to protect the 
Nation. 
This week, we will take up legisla-
tion to renew and reform several key 
provisions of the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Act, which the Demo-
cratic-controlled 
House 
allowed 
to 
lapse despite unanimous support for an 
extension here in the Senate. 
Our law enforcement officers are 
working every day to protect Ameri-
cans from terrorist threats. It is essen-
tial that we make sure they have the 
tools they need to do their jobs, while 
also providing critical protections for 
civil liberties. 
We are also taking up two nomina-
tions this week for senior administra-
tion posts: Brian D. Montgomery to be 
Deputy 
Secretary 
of 
Housing 
and 
Urban Development and Troy Edgar to 
be the Chief Financial Officer of the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
The American people are relying on 
us right now, and we have a responsi-
bility to deliver for them. We will con-
tinue to do everything we can to sup-
port our Nation’s families and busi-
nesses as the country fights its way 
through this crisis and emerges on the 
other side. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRAMER). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
FISA 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the Con-
stitution of the United States contains 
a number of constitutional protections 
for the citizens of our great Republic. 
Among the many provisions that it 
contains, in addition to the structural 
safeguards of federalism and the sepa-
ration of powers, separating out power 
along two axes—one vertical, which we 
call federalism, and the other hori-
zontal, which we call the separation of 
powers—the Constitution also includes 
a number of substantive restrictions. 
These are things that the government 
may not do, and there are penalties at-
tached to the government’s doing those 
things. 
Among those many protections can 
be found the provisions of the Bill of 
Rights, including the Fourth Amend-
ment of the U.S. Constitution. The 
Fourth Amendment reminds us that it 
is our right—a fundamental, inalien-
able right—as citizens in a free repub-
lic, to be free from unreasonable 
searches and seizures, and that any 
warrants issued under government au-
thority have to be backed by probable 
cause, and any probable cause-based 
warrant has to include with particu-
larity a description of the places and 
persons to be searched and to be seized. 
This is a tradition that reaches not 
just back a couple of centuries, but it 
reaches back much farther than that 
and has its origins not only in our own 
country but in our mother country, in 
the United Kingdom. By the time John 
Wilkes was serving in Parliament in 
the 1760s, there had been a long-estab-
lished tradition and understanding. In 
fact, there had been a series of laws en-
acted to make sure that warrants were 
not abused and to make sure the rights 
of the English subjects would not be in-
fringed. Among other things, there was 
an understanding and a set of laws in 
place that would make clear that those 
conducting searches and seizures would 
be subject to a warrant requirement. In 
other words, they would lose any im-
munity that they would otherwise have 
as government officials if they didn’t 
obtain a warrant and if that warrant 
were not valid. 
In 1763, the home of John Wilkes was 
searched aggressively. John Wilkes, 
while serving as a Member of Par-
liament, had become critical of the ad-
ministration of King George, and he 
had participated in the publication of a 
weekly circular known as the North 
Briton. Although the North Briton was 
not one likely to engage in excessive, 
fawning praise of the reigning Mon-
arch, it wasn’t until the publication of 
North Briton No. 45 in 1763 that the ad-
ministration of King George decided to 
go after John Wilkes. His home was 
searched, and it was searched pursuant 
to a general warrant. 
A general warrant was something 
that basically said, in that instance: 
Find out who had anything to do with 
the 
authorship 
and 
publication 
of 
North Briton No. 45. You see, North 
Briton No. 45 accused, among other 
things, King George and those who 
served in his government of laying ag-
gressive taxes on the people—taxes 
that they knew couldn’t adequately be 
enforced or collected without intrusive 
measures that would involve kicking 
open 
people’s 
doors, 
rummaging 
through 
their 
drawers, 
and 
doing 
things that couldn’t be justified for the 
use of a warrant laid out with particu-
larity. 
John Wilkes, in that circumstance, 
was arrested within a matter of a few 
weeks. He won his freedom, albeit on 
something of a technicality at the mo-
ment. He asserted parliamentary privi-
lege and was released. Eventually, 
after becoming subjected to multiple 
searches 
using 
general 
warrants, 
Wilkes sued Lord Halifax and those 
who participated in the searches and 
seizures in question. He was able to ob-
tain a large award, a large judgment 
consisting of money damages. 
John Wilkes, at the time, became fa-
mous, really, on both sides of the At-
lantic. The name of John Wilkes was 
celebrated in taverns, saloons, and 
other public places in England and in 
the nascent United States of America, 
the colonies in North America that 
would later become the world’s great-
est Republic. John Wilkes’ example 
was something that helped to solidify a 
long-standing legal tradition, one that 
would in time make its way into our 
Constitution 
through 
the 
Fourth 
Amendment. 
We have to remember that govern-
ment is simply force. It is the orga-
nized collective official use of force. 
When John Wilkes and those who 
worked with him on the North Briton, 
culminating in North Briton No. 45, 
criticized the King too much, ques-
tioned excessively, in their judgment, 
the collection and imposition of taxes, 
the administration of King George de-
cided they had gone too far and that it 
was time for John Wilkes to pay a 
price. 
Fortunately for John Wilkes and for 
people on both sides of the Atlantic, 
John 
Wilkes 
emerged 
victoriously. 
Today, we don’t have general warrants, 
at least nothing masquerading under 
that title in the United States. The 
fact that we have a First Amendment 
is a test to his vigorous defense of the 
rights of English subjects. 
What we do have is something that 
ought to concern every American. We 
have the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act, which we know has been 
abused, and we have known for a long 
time is ripe for opportunities for abuse 
among government officials. 
In fact, what we have seen is that the 
current President of the United States 
has, himself, become the target of 
abuse under FISA. Back in 2016 when 
this started being abused and when we 
saw the emergence of things like Oper-
ation Crossfire Hurricane, you had the 
campaign of a man who would become 
the 45th President of the United States 
targeted and singled out, quite un-
fairly, using these practices—these pro-
cedures that were designed originally 
for use in detecting and thwarting the 
efforts of agents of foreign powers. 
As the name of the law implies, the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
is not something that is intended to go 
after American citizens. It is certainly 
not something that is intended to be 
used as a tool for bullying a Presi-
dential candidate. Now that it has been 
used to bully and incorrectly surveil 
the 
45th 
President 
of 
the 
United 
States, we need to do something about 
it. That is what the Lee-Leahy amend-
ment does.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2367 
May 12, 2020 
First, for a bit of background on this 
particular law, we have three provi-
sions of the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act that expired on March 15, 
2020, just a few weeks ago. We have one 
provision known as section 215, another 
provision known as lone wolf, and an-
other provision known as roving wire-
taps. 
On March 16, the Senate passed a bill 
to 
reauthorize 
those 
provisions 
through May 30, 2020, which would give 
us a few weeks to debate and discuss 
reforms that need to happen under 
FISA. In order to pass this bill, the 
Senate entered into a unanimous con-
sent agreement for votes on three 
amendments 
to 
the 
Pelosi-Nadler- 
Schiff bill passed by the House of Rep-
resentatives a few weeks ago. One of 
those amendments is the one that I re-
ferred to a moment ago, the Lee-Leahy 
amendment, introduced by myself and 
Senator LEAHY from Vermont. 
Unfortunately, however, the House of 
Representatives 
never 
passed 
that 
short-term extension measure, so that 
the three authorities that I men-
tioned—lone wolf, roving wiretaps, and 
215—have been expired now for almost 2 
months. 
Now, this is not for lack of trying on 
the part of us—the part of those of us 
who really want to see meaningful 
FISA reform. In fact, just a few days 
before these authorities were set to ex-
pire, I came down here to the Senate 
floor and I asked a series of unanimous 
consent requests to consider the House- 
passed reauthorization bill with a 
handful of relevant and, I believe, very 
necessary amendments. Unfortunately, 
my friend, a distinguished colleague, 
Senator BURR, objected. 
The Department of Justice Inspector 
General Horowitz’s December report on 
Crossfire Hurricane proved what many 
of us reformers have been saying now 
for years. In my case, I have been 
working on this and trying to call out 
the dangers inherent in provisions of 
FISA now for a decade. But what the 
Horowitz report in December dem-
onstrated was that FISA really is ripe 
for opportunities for abuse. Inspector 
General Horowitz not only found evi-
dence that the FISA process was 
abused to target President Trump’s 
campaign. He found evidence that basic 
procedures meant to protect the rights 
of U.S. persons—that is to say, U.S. 
citizens and lawful permanent resi-
dents of the United States—were not 
being followed. 
And so, just as we see that John 
Wilkes, through his publication of 
North Briton No. 45, solidified a pre-
existing set of rights available to all 
English subjects, we now see that 
President No. 45, Donald John Trump, 
has the opportunity to strengthen this 
right protected in our Fourth Amend-
ment, harkening back to the example 
of John Wilkes in the publication of 
North Briton No. 45. 
My amendment with Senator LEAHY 
would make reforms to applications for 
surveillance across the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act, including 
both section 215, the authority that re-
cently expired, and under title I, which 
happens to be the authority that was 
abused in order to surveil President 
Trump’s campaign. 
First, 
the 
amendment 
would 
strengthen the role of the friend-of-the- 
court provisions—the amicus curiae 
provisions that we adopted in 2015 in 
connection with the USA FREEDOM 
Act, which was introduced by Senator 
LEAHY and myself back then. It would 
strength these amicus curiae or friend- 
of-the-court provisions and make them 
applicable in circumstances in which 
there are sensitivities inherently in 
play. 
Now, these amici curiae, or friends of 
the court, are people who, as con-
templated under the proposed legisla-
tion, would primarily be experts and 
would have at least some knowledge or 
expertise of FISA and of privacy, civil 
liberties, secure communications, and 
other fields that are important to the 
FISA Court. They would also be people 
who would have clearance to review 
matters of concern from a national se-
curity standpoint. 
These amici are essential because, 
you see, the FISA Court is a secret 
court which, by its very design, oper-
ates on an ex parte basis, meaning 
without the presence of opposing coun-
sel. You have government counsel and 
the judges themselves, and that is it. 
The 
friend-of-the-court 
provisions, 
the amici curiae I am describing, pro-
vide the opportunity for the FISA 
Court to hear from a fresh perspec-
tive—a neutral, trusted perspective— 
one that comes with some expertise in 
national security clearance but with-
out presenting the threat to upending 
the national security investigations 
entrusted to the FISA Court. 
So that is why the amici are so nec-
essary and so important. In the ab-
sence of opposing counsel, we have to 
strengthen the provisions that provide 
for these amici to ensure that there is 
some advocate somewhere in front of 
the court who is in a position to say: 
Wait a minute. What happens if we do 
this? Wait a minute. Is this really what 
the law authorizes? Wait a minute. 
Isn’t there a constitutional concern 
implicated here, especially where they 
are dealing with the rights of American 
citizens. 
The December 2019 inspector general 
report on the surveillance of President 
Trump’s campaign staffer Carter Page 
demonstrates the significant need for 
an outside expert legal advocate, espe-
cially when a FISA application in-
volves a sensitive investigative matter, 
like the surveillance of a candidate for 
public office or an elected official or 
that official’s staff. 
If the Lee-Leahy amendment were in 
statute, it would have required the 
FISA Court to appoint an amicus in 
the Carter Page case. If an amicus had 
been appointed in that case, would she 
have raised some of the issues that we 
now see regarding the credibility of the 
Steele dossier? Well, it is quite pos-
sible. In fact, I think it is quite likely. 
I think it is almost unimaginable that 
had there been an amicus curiae 
present in the FISA Court at that mo-
ment, somebody—likely, the amicus— 
would have said: Wait a minute. We 
have got a problem. Wait a minute. 
You have got evidence that is unreli-
able. Wait a minute. You have got huge 
credibility problems with the evidence 
that is backing up what you are asking 
for. 
Our amendment would require the 
FISA Court to appoint an amicus when 
an application involves ‘‘sensitive in-
vestigative matter,’’ such as the sur-
veillance of candidates and elected offi-
cials or their staff, political organiza-
tions, religious organizations, promi-
nent individuals within those organiza-
tions, and domestic news media. 
One of the arguments made by those 
who oppose FISA reform is that the ap-
pointment of an amicus would some-
how slow down the surveillance and the 
FISA order application process, which, 
so the argument goes, could then harm 
our national security in those in-
stances where there could be an immi-
nent attack. Anytime this argument is 
made, it is important for the American 
people to listen and listen carefully. It 
is an important argument. It is not one 
that we want to treat lightly. At the 
same time, we have to remember the 
immense harm that has been inflicted, 
not only on our own society but else-
where, when people simply suggest: 
Don’t worry about this; it is a matter 
of national security. Don’t worry about 
it; we have the experts covering it. 
Don’t worry about it; your liberty is 
not to concern you. 
We know the risk. We know that we 
have to ask the difficult questions, and 
that is what we are doing here. 
In any event, the argument doesn’t 
work here. The argument falls apart 
under its own weight here, you see, be-
cause our amendment allows for the 
FISA Court to have flexibility. In fact, 
the FISA Court, under the amendment, 
may decline to appoint an amicus if 
the court concludes it would be inap-
propriate to do so under the cir-
cumstances. All it has to do is make 
that finding. 
Is this too great an intrusion on the 
ability of the U.S. Government to col-
lect information on U.S. citizens? I 
think not, especially as here we are 
dealing with this sensitive investiga-
tive matter, one involving an elected 
official or a candidate for elected office 
or religious officials or media organiza-
tions. 
We know in our hearts that these are 
areas where our foreign intelligence 
surveillance authority ought to give 
way, ought to at least recognize the 
rights of individual Americans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2368 
May 12, 2020 
Our amendment also provides the 
amicus with more access to informa-
tion regarding applications and re-
quires the government to make avail-
able the supporting documentation un-
derlying assertions made in applica-
tions if requested by the amicus or by 
the FISA Court itself. 
Now, this information is, to be sure, 
required by the FBI’s internal oper-
ating procedures, including its so- 
called Woods procedures, to be main-
tained in a series of documents known 
collectively as the Woods files. 
But the FBI’s failure to correctly 
maintain the supporting documenta-
tion or, in some cases, even to assem-
ble it in the first place—the docu-
mentation underlying these FISA ap-
plications to surveil U.S. persons, that 
is—was itself the subject of the inspec-
tor general’s most recent memorandum 
to FBI Director Christopher Wray. 
That 
memorandum 
proved, 
among 
other things, that the government’s 
failure to provide all of the evidence, 
especially evidence that undermined 
the government’s case before the FISA 
Court, when considering the applica-
tion to surveil Trump campaign ad-
viser Carter Page, was not an isolated 
accident. Quite to the contrary, after 
sampling 29 FBI applications for FISA 
surveillance of U.S. persons, the in-
spector general, Mr. Horowitz, found an 
average of 20 errors per application, 
with most applications having either 
missing or inadequate Woods files, 
leading the inspector general to con-
clude: ‘‘We do not have confidence that 
the FBI has executed its Woods proce-
dures in compliance with FBI policy.’’ 
This is absolutely unacceptable in 
any free republic, but especially in 
ours, with the existence of the Fourth 
Amendment. 
We are not talking about the failure 
to create or maintain some obsolete 
piece of paperwork just for the sake of 
having it. No, no, no, this is much 
more than that. And we are not talking 
here about exculpatory evidence being 
withheld as to suspected foreign terror-
ists. These are applications to surveil 
U.S. citizens and lawful permanent 
residents, who themselves have con-
stitutional rights and also have an ex-
pectation that their government will 
not secretly spy on them, in violation 
of that which is rightfully theirs under 
the Constitution of the United States. 
So you can’t look at this and 
credibly, reliably, say: It is OK. Let the 
FBI take care of it. The FBI is working 
on it. 
We have been hearing that for years. 
I have been hearing that for 10 years— 
the entire decade that I have been at 
this business. And what has happened? 
Well, what has happened is that we 
have seen time and again that there 
have been abuses of the very sort that 
many of us have been predicting for a 
long time would inevitably and repeat-
edly arise in the absence of reform. 
This doesn’t require us to undertake 
a dismal view of humanity. No, it is 
not that at all. It is simply that gov-
ernment is best understood as the orga-
nized, official collective use of force, 
officially sanctioned as part of a gov-
ernment. And, as James Madison ex-
plained in Federalist 51, if men were 
angels we wouldn’t need government. If 
we had access to angels to run our gov-
ernment, we wouldn’t need rules about 
government. 
But we are not angels, and we don’t 
have access to them. So, instead, we 
have to rely on humans. Humans are 
flawed. They make mistakes, and they 
also sometimes decide for nefarious or 
political or other reasons to flout the 
law—hence the need for the night 
watchman, hence the need for rules 
that restricts their ability to do that. 
So I find it entirely unsatisfactory 
when people say: Just let the FBI deal 
with this, because, first of all, they 
haven’t dealt with it. They haven’t 
dealt with it even as abuses have be-
come more and more known under var-
ious provisions of FISA and even as we 
are still coming to terms with lan-
guage that was adopted nearly two dec-
ades ago that itself was overly broad at 
the time and has been abused since 
then. 
No, we are not going to just trust 
that an organization that is able to op-
erate entirely in secret, with the ben-
efit of protection of national security 
laws, with the benefit of over-classi-
fication of documents—we are not sim-
ply going to assume lightly that they 
are going to fix it, because they 
haven’t and because they won’t and be-
cause they don’t want to. 
I understand why they might not 
want to. All of us can appreciate that 
when we do a job, if somebody else adds 
requirements to that job, we might be 
naturally resistant to it. But that 
doesn’t mean that we don’t need to do 
it here. That doesn’t mean that our 
oath to uphold, protect, and defend the 
Constitution of the United States 
doesn’t compel us to do so here. 
We know that the FBI is not going to 
fix it because the FBI has in the past 
adopted procedures designed to prevent 
this kind of manipulation, this kind of 
chicanery from arising, including, most 
notably, the Woods procedures. Yet we 
know that the Woods procedures have 
been openly flouted. 
So can we walk away from this and 
pretend that the 45th President of the 
United States didn’t have his own 
rights 
abused, 
his 
own 
campaign 
surveilled abusively by the FBI itself? 
No, we can’t. And I don’t know any-
one—Democrat or Republican, liberal 
or conservative or libertarian or some-
thing else—who could look at that and 
say: Yes, that makes a lot of sense. It 
makes a lot of sense that we should 
just leave unfettered, unreviewable dis-
cretion in the hands of those who are 
able to operate entirely in secret. 
The Lee-Leahy amendment would re-
quire that the government turn over to 
the FISA Court any and all material 
information in its position, including 
information that might undermine its 
case as part of the FISA application. 
As I said earlier, this information 
would be made available to the amicus 
curiae upon request. 
As an added protection, our amend-
ment would require any Federal officer 
filing an application for electronic sur-
veillance or physical search under 
FISA to certify that the officer has col-
lected and reviewed, for accuracy and 
for 
completeness, 
supporting 
docu-
mentation for each factual assertion 
contained in the application. 
If we are going to require people to 
go to the FISA Court at all to get an 
order, if we are going to call it a court, 
ought we not require that such evi-
dence be assembled and at least be 
made available to those whose job it is 
to make sure that the job is actually 
being done? 
The Lee-Leahy amendment also re-
quires these officers to certify in each 
application that they have employed 
accuracy procedures put in place by 
the Attorney General and the FISA 
Court to confirm this certification be-
fore issuing an order. 
Finally, the Lee-Leahy amendment 
requires the Department of Justice in-
spector general to file an annual report 
regarding the accuracy of FISA appli-
cations and the Department of Jus-
tice’s compliance with its require-
ments to disclose any and all material 
evidence that might undermine their 
case. 
Now, while I have a lot of ideas for 
reform, many of which are included in 
the USA FREEDOM Reauthorization 
Act that Senator LEAHY and I intro-
duced a couple of months ago, we were 
limited in this circumstance for our 
purposes to just one amendment to the 
Pelosi-Nadler-Schiff bill. That is this 
amendment, the one that I have been 
describing, the Lee-Leahy amendment. 
We believe that our amendment is a 
very measured approach to enacting 
those reforms that we believe to be 
most essential to protecting the rights 
and the privacy of Americans from a 
system that, by its very nature and, in 
some instances, by design, is ripe with 
opportunities for abuse. It is not per-
fect, but it will go a long way, if we 
pass it, toward forestalling this kind of 
abuse. 
We have to remember that although 
we live in the greatest Republic ever 
known to human beings and although 
our rights are, by and large, respected 
in this country, we are by no means 
immune to the type of abuse that can 
take hold in any system of govern-
ment, especially a system of govern-
ment with a whole lot of resources at 
its disposal to gather information, in-
cluding efforts to gather information 
on that government’s own citizenry. 
If we remember, about 45 years ago, 
there was a committee put together, 
headed by a Senator from Idaho named 
Frank Church, that looked at abuses of 
telephone surveillance by the govern-
ment and concluded that in basically 
every administration dating back to 
the rise of the common usage of the 
telephone, our intelligence-gathering

May 12, 2020 
resources within the United States had 
been utilized to engage in what was es-
sentially political espionage. 
Since the late 1970s when the Church 
Committee issued its report, we have 
had exponential growth in the ability 
of government and the ability of every-
one else, for that matter, to obtain and 
process data and information. In most 
ways, it has been a real blessing. It is 
a great thing. 
It is also important for us to keep in 
mind the extent to which our papers 
and effects are no longer found exclu-
sively within physical file cabinet files 
within someone’s home or office. In 
many instances, they can be found 
elsewhere in electronic form. 
Our security and our liberty need not 
and ought never to be viewed as ir-
reconcilably at odds with each other. 
Many civil liberties and privacy ex-
perts joined together in an effort 
known as the PCLOB a few years ago— 
the Privacy and Civil Liberties Over-
sight Board—and concluded a few years 
ago that our privacy and our liberty 
are not at odds with each other. In 
fact, our privacy is part of our liberty. 
We are not truly free unless our per-
sonal effects and our private informa-
tion can belong to us and not simply be 
open game for the government. 
It is sad and tragic that in order for 
this to come to light, it took an as-
sault on freedom so bold and so shame-
less as to loop in the President of the 
United States. With this and other rev-
elations that have come to light in re-
cent days and weeks and months and 
over the last few years, we can’t forget 
that these entities are still run by 
human beings with their own political 
views, with their own agendas. And in 
some cases, unfortunately—rare cases, 
I hope—people who are charged with 
protecting the people and their liberty 
may in some cases be inclined to be at 
odds with it. 
It is unfortunate that the 45th Presi-
dent of the United States has had, 
quite tragically, to become the victim 
of this. But I ask the question, what if 
your information were on the line? 
What if you had been targeted—maybe 
for political reasons, maybe for reasons 
that had nothing to do with politics, 
maybe for reasons that just had to deal 
with a personal vendetta someone had 
against any American. It is far less 
likely that the abuse would ever have 
come to light. 
In this circumstance, it did come to 
light. We can’t ignore it, nor can we 
pretend that it couldn’t happen to any 
one of us—and I don’t mean as Mem-
bers of the U.S. Senate; I just mean as 
Americans. In fact, each and every one 
of us is less capable of standing up to 
this and less likely to discover the 
abuse in the first instance. Not all of 
us happen to be the President of the 
United States. 
I am grateful that President Donald 
J. Trump has been willing to speak 
truth to power and has been willing to 
call out the flagrant abuse of FISA and 
of other procedures within the govern-
ment. It is our obligation, it is our sol-
emn duty, and it is my pleasure to do 
something about it. The Lee-Leahy 
amendment does something about it, 
and I invite all of my colleagues to join 
me in supporting it. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). Without objection, it is 
so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I use whatever 
time I shall consume. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, by 
now, I think people are pretty much 
aware of something that happened 
about 2 weeks ago—an FCC approval of 
an application that was very, very sig-
nificant. Yet not many people knew 
that it was going on. 
I think by now it shouldn’t be a sur-
prise to anyone that I oppose this deci-
sion by the Federal Communications 
Commission to approve an application 
by Ligado Networks. Ligado’s plan 
would use Federal spectrum in a way 
that will interfere with GPS and sat-
ellite 
communications, 
and 
despite 
near-unanimous objection from the 
rest of the Federal Government, the 
Federal Communications Commission 
has just said OK. 
I said ‘‘near-unanimous.’’ It was 
nearly unanimous. A week before the 
decision was made by the FCC, they 
sent a letter outlining all of the rea-
sons that everyone should be opposed 
to the application made by Ligado to 
the FCC. Their statement was that 
Ligado’s proposal is not feasible, af-
fordable, or technically executable. It 
goes on to say how destructive this 
would be, how the whole country uses 
this GPS, and how this would alter the 
GPS system so that it no longer could 
be used with predictability. 
When I say ‘‘nearly everyone,’’ it is 
not ‘‘nearly’’; it is everyone objected to 
it. I have never seen anything like this 
happen, to have something approved 
that was objected to by all of govern-
ment. This letter objecting to this was 
signed by the Department of the Army, 
the Department of the Navy, the De-
partment of Commerce, NASA, the De-
partment of the Interior, the Depart-
ment of Justice, the Department of 
Homeland Security, the Department of 
Energy, the National Science Founda-
tion, the Department of Transpor-
tation, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the 
Federal Aviation Administration. That 
is everybody. I have never seen any-
thing that has ever had that unanimity 
in being objected to. For that reason, it 
was never approved until April 20 by 
the Federal Communications Commis-
sion. 
The GPS and satellite communica-
tion 
functions 
support 
everything: 
equipment that our troops use in the 
field, navigation for first responders, 
airlines—that is how airplanes keep 
from running into each other; they use 
GPS—cell phones, and ATMs. The list 
goes on and on. 
Simply put, the FCC is jeopardizing 
GPS signals that Americans rely on 
every day. I chair the Senate Armed 
Services Committee. When you are 
conducting warfare, you are using 
GPS. You use GPS every day. Simply 
put, the FCC is jeopardizing GPS sig-
nals that we rely on for both our na-
tional and economic security for the 
benefit of just one company and its 
hedge fund investors. 
Ligado may be a new name, but the 
problem goes back a decade, when 
LightSquared was created in a hedge 
fund deal worth $5.3 billion. The inves-
tors put billions on the table, and the 
only way to get a return was to repur-
pose LightSquared’s satellite spectrum 
for the terrestrial cell phone network. 
In 2011, when LightSquared asked the 
FCC for permission to do just that, 
GPS and satellite communication users 
strongly objected due to the inter-
ference with the GPS signal. That is 
the problem. The signal is in the same 
area that purchase took place by a 
company 
at 
that 
time 
named 
LightSquared. Federal agencies like 
the Department of Defense, the Depart-
ment of Transportation, and the Na-
tional Telecommunications and Infor-
mation Administration echoed these 
concerns. 
In 2012, after it was clear that there 
was no way to mitigate the GPS inter-
ference in their proposal, LightSquared 
declared bankruptcy, so it was gone. 
Years 
later, 
LightSquared 
got 
enough new Wall Street hedge fund 
money to emerge from bankruptcy and 
be renamed ‘‘Ligado’’ and again pushed 
for repurpose of the satellite spectrum 
for its network. That is exactly the 
thing that the predecessor company 
tried to do for a long period of time, 
and they were denied, and they were 
justly denied. They shouldn’t have 
been able to do that. 
There was never any idea that an ap-
plication by an operation like this 
would be acceptable. After extensive 
testing and analysis, experts at nine 
Federal agencies have unanimously 
concluded that Ligado’s proposal, even 
with updates, will still interfere with 
GPS signals and satellite communica-
tions. That is the one I just read. They 
were unanimous in doing this. Of 
course, we read the names of the agen-
cies that were involved. This is some-
thing everyone agreed with. We can’t 
find anyone who disagreed with it ex-
cept Ligado itself—the ones who would 
end up with a lot of billions of dollars, 
and I am not sure where it would go. 
They rely on GPS for navigation, lo-
gistics, and precision-guided missiles 
in training and on the battlefield. But 
at the end of the day, this is about 
much more than risking our military

readiness and capabilities. Ligado’s 
proposal will hurt the American econ-
omy. Our farmers rely on GPS to har-
vest their crops. Our truckers and our 
airlines rely on GPS to move supplies 
and people safely. Our maritime indus-
try depends on GPS to place channel 
markings. Weather forecasting relies 
on satellite communications to save 
lives and property when tornadoes and 
hurricanes and floods strike our com-
munities. I am from Oklahoma. We 
know what hurricanes are. In fact, we 
were in our basement two times in 1 
day about a month ago with those 
threats. That is how you determine 
where they are and how serious they 
are, and it saves lives. 
The FCC—Federal Communications 
Commission—has put all of this at risk 
by 
approving 
Ligado’s 
application. 
There wasn’t a lot of opposition out 
there talking about it because they had 
not been approved for a number of 
years. It has never been approved be-
fore. And all of that was now at risk, 
just as of a week ago. 
This is a complex issue. Here is an 
easy way to think about how Ligado’s 
network would interfere with our GPS 
signals. ‘‘Once Ligado turns its service 
on, it will be like trying to hear leaves 
rustling over the roar of 100 jet en-
gines.’’ This is according to Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Research and En-
gineering, Dr. Michael Griffin, an ex-
pert in this field. 
The FCC has included certain mitiga-
tion measures in approving Ligado’s 
application, but these are fundamen-
tally flawed in every practical sense. 
They would make Ligado the fox 
guarding 
the 
henhouse. 
How 
can 
Ligado be impartial in deciding wheth-
er its own system is causing inter-
ference? It is not going to happen, and 
everybody knows that. Ultimately, the 
taxpayer and consumer will be left to 
pay to fix the interference. Ultimately, 
the people of America will end up pay-
ing for this. 
What I am most upset about is the 
failure in the process behind this deci-
sion. A few people made a hasty deci-
sion over the weekend. Keep in mind, it 
was in the middle of the national cri-
sis. We have a national crisis. Every-
body knows that is going on right now. 
Everyone is having to live differently 
than they have ever lived before, so 
people are concentrating on that. No 
one was looking. 
It was against the judgment of a 
unanimous conclusion by the Inter-
department 
Radio 
Advisory 
Com-
mittee, which included nine Federal 
agencies, as well as private sector 
stakeholders dependent on GPS and 
satellite communications. 
As far as I can tell, this is the first 
time that the FCC made a decision 
over the weekend, completely dis-
counting the universal opposition to 
the proposal. A week before this deci-
sion was made, it was universal. They 
decided—and this is a group in the 
hearing that we had—we had really tal-
ented people there, scientists, making 
all of the decisions. They talked about 
how the decision was made over a 
weekend, during a national crisis we 
were dealing with, and on a Sunday. I 
went back and checked, and we could 
not find any time a decision that was 
made by the FCC on a Sunday or on a 
weekend. They don’t do that on week-
ends. 
On top of that, this decision was op-
posed by everybody in a letter they re-
ceived a week before. 
Just look in the Wall Street Journal. 
Mark Esper is the Secretary of De-
fense. Mark Esper had an article there 
that said. 
The FCC has set conditions to ensure GPS 
won’t be affected. Don’t be fooled. 
It would be affected. 
Independent testing and analysis con-
ducted by nine federal departments and 
agencies show that allowing the Ligado’s 
proposed 
system—including 
its 
proposed 
modifications—to operate in close proximity 
to the GPS spectrum would cause harmful 
interference to millions of GPS receivers 
across the United States. 
Actually, the band that is used for 
GPS is called the L band. It gets a lit-
tle bit complicated. The area that peo-
ple are concerned about, and that the 
Ligado is trying to say they are cor-
recting, was an area that was in a dif-
ferent band all together. I think it was 
the C band and the S band. 
I think this is the first time a deci-
sion has ever been made—even dis-
counting the universal opposition who 
oppose it—in response to this unprece-
dented and unwise decision. I am lead-
ing a letter to the FCC outlining crit-
ical national security concerns and 
urging the FCC to rescind the order. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the letters by the NTIA be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

DEAR CHAIRMAN PAI: On behalf of the exec-
utive branch, the National Telecommuni-
cations 
and 
Information 
Administration 
(NTIA) submits the enclosed supplemental 
materials for consideration by the Federal 
Communications Commission (Commission) 
regarding the above-referenced license modi-
fication applications of Ligado Networks 
(Ligado), as amended. This letter and its en-
closures are provided for inclusion in the 
record 
of 
the 
application 
proceedings, 
supplementing my letter to you dated De-
cember 6, 2019, in which I indicated that 
NTIA was ‘‘unable to recommend the Com-
mission’s approval of the Ligado applica-
tions.’’ 
I enclose a letter from the Deputy Sec-
retary of Defense to the Secretary of Com-
merce dated March 24, 2020. In the letter, the 
Deputy Secretary, citing 10 USC § 2281, states 
that ‘‘approval of the Ligado application 
would adversely affect the military potential 
of GPS and the Department of Defense is 
strongly opposed.’’ ‘‘After reviewing the ex-
isting public record of the Ligado pro-
ceeding,’’ he continues, ‘‘I believe the infor-
mation Air Force has submitted to the IRAC 
would be of significant value to the FCC in 
making its decision regarding Ligado’s li-
cense modification application. I therefore 
request that you have NTIA communicate 
this additional information to the FCC expe-
ditiously to be put on the public record.’’ I 
received a similar and consistent letter from 
senior officials of the Department of Defense 
on March 12, 2020. 
The letters refer to the enclosed memo-
randum from the Air Force—joined by sev-
eral executive branch departments and agen-
cies—providing supplemental information to 
the Interdepartment Radio Advisory Com-
mittee (IRAC) that detailed numerous ex-
pected impacts Ligado’s proposed license 
modifications 
would 
cause. 
The 
memo-
randum concluded that Ligado’s modifica-
tions ‘‘would cause unacceptable operational 
impacts . . . and adversely affect the mili-
tary potential of GPS,’’ and further noted 
that ‘‘Ligado’s proposed accommodations of 
identifying and then repairing or replacing 
potentially-impacted legacy equipment is 
not feasible, affordable or technically exe-
cutable.’’ 
NTIA notes that in a 2011 Order and Au-
thorization, the Commission’s International 
Bureau declared that its processes for au-
thorizing then-LightSquared to commence 
commercial operations on its MSS L-band 
frequencies would be complete only ‘‘once 
the Commission, after consultation with 
NTIA, concludes that the harmful inter-
ference concerns have been resolved.’’ We be-
lieve the Commission cannot reasonably 
reach such a conclusion. 
Should you have any questions about this 
submission, please do not hesitate to contact 
me. 
Sincerely,

Associate Administrator, 
Performing the Delegated Duties of the 
Assistant Secretary for Communications and 
Information.

DEAR MR. SECRETARY: On December 6, 2019, 
the Acting Assistant Secretary of Commerce 
for Communications and Information and 
Administrator of the National Telecommuni-

and 
Information 
Administration 
(NTIA) sent a letter, on behalf of the Execu-
tive Branch, to the Chairman of the Federal 
Communications Commission (FCC) recom-
mending rejection of the license modifica-
tion request of Ligado Networks. The Air 
Force, on behalf of DoD and endorsed by the 
interagency, has provided additional supple-
mental information to the Chairman of the 
Interdepartment Radio Advisory Committee 
(IRAC) on expected national security and de-
fense impacts to Global Positioning System 
(GPS) operations if the proposed license 
modification request were granted. I request 
this additional information be transmitted 
by NTIA to the FCC for inclusion in the pub-
lic record of the Ligado proceeding (FCC 
International Bureau Docket Numbers 11–109 
and 12–340). 
Per 10 U.S.C. 2281, the Secretary of Defense 
‘‘may not agree to any restriction on the

application. I therefore request that you 
have NTIA communicate this additional in-
formation to the FCC expeditiously to be put

both agree. 
Your personal attention to this matter 
would be greatly appreciated.

OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE, 
Washington, DC, March 12, 2020. 
DOUGLAS W. KINKOPH, 
Associate Administrator, Office of Telecommuni-
cations and Information Applications, Per-
forming the non-exclusive functions and du-
ties of the Assistant Secretary of Commerce 
for Communications and Information, Na-
tional Telecommunications and Information 
Administration, U.S. Department of Com-
merce, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. KINKOPH: On December 6, 2019, 
you sent a letter on behalf of the Executive 
Branch, to the Chairman of the Federal Com-
munications Commission (FCC) stating that 
the National Telecommunications and Infor-
mation Administration (NTIA) is unable to 
recommend the Commission’s approval of 
the Ligado applications. The Air Force, the 
Executive Agent for the Department of De-
fense (DoD) for the Global Positioning Sys-
tem (GPS) and DoD’s member of the Inter-
department 
Radio 
Advisory 
Committee 
(IRAC), has provided additional information 
to the Chair of the IRAC, endorsed by other 
interested agencies on expected national se-
curity and defense impacts to GPS oper-
ations if the proposed Ligado license modi-
fication request is granted by the FCC. The 
Department requests this additional infor-
mation be transmitted to the FCC for inclu-
sion into the public record of the Ligado pro-
ceeding (FCC International Bureau Docket 
Numbers 11–109 and 12–340). 
Consistent with the authority delegated by 
the Secretary of Defense in DoD Directive 
4650.05, ‘‘Positioning, Navigation, and Tim-
ing (PNT)’’, the undersigned agree with the 
enclosed memorandum for the IRAC Chair. 
Specifically, FCC approval of Ligado’s li-
cense modification would cause unacceptable 
operational impacts and adversely affect the 
military potential of GPS. The Secretary of 
Defense, pursuant to 10 USC § 2281, ‘‘may not 
agree to any restriction on the GPS System 
proposed by the head of a department or 
agency of the United States outside DoD 
that would adversely affect the military po-
tential of GPS’’. After review of the public 
record of the Ligado proceeding, the Air 
Force’s memorandum submitted to the IRAC 
Chair would be critical to the FCC in making 
its decision regarding Ligado’s license modi-
fication application. The Department re-
mains strongly opposed to the granting of 
the license modification sought by Ligado. 
Accordingly, the Department requests NTIA 
to provide this additional information to the 
FCC and that such information be expedi-
tiously submitted in the public record. 
Your personal attention to this matter 
would be greatly appreciated.

FEBRUARY 14, 2020. 
Memorandum for IRAC Chairman 
NATIONAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AND INFOR-
MATION ADMINISTRATION, 
U.S. Department of Commerce, 
Washington, DC. 
The Air Force, in the exercise of the De-
partment of Defense’s (DoD) statutory duties 
under 10 U.S.C. §2281, and as the Executive 
Agent for the Global Positioning System 
(GPS), and in its role as a member of the Na-
tional Telecommunication Information Ad-
ministration (NTIA) Interdepartment Radio 
Advisory Committee (IRAC), hereby submits 
supplemental information in support of the 
Department of Commerce National Tele-
communications and Information Adminis-
tration’s letter to Federal Communications 
Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai of De-
cember 6, 2019. Specifically, this letter pro-
vides additional detail regarding the ex-
pected impacts on national security, oper-
ational impacts to the warfighter, and ef-
fects on the military potential of GPS by the 
proposed license modification sought by 
Ligado Networks (Ligado). 
Extensive and technically rigorous testing 
and analysis conducted over the past nine 
years by DoD, the National Space-based Po-
sitioning, Navigation and Timing Systems 
Engineering Forum (NPEF), the Department 
and Transportation (DOT), and the Air Force 
has shown—and Ligado itself has conceded— 
that 
the 
proposed 
Ligado 
(previously 
LightSquared) license modification threat-
ens disruption of the GPS, which is a critical 
National Security System. As such, the Sec-
retary of Defense, pursuant to 10 U.S.C. §2281, 
‘‘may not agree to any restriction on the 
GPS System proposed by the head of a de-
partment or agency of the United States out-
side DoD that would adversely affect the 
military potential of GPS.’’ It is DoD’s posi-
tion that FCC approval of Ligado’s license 
modification would cause unacceptable oper-
ational impacts to the warfighter and ad-
versely affect the military potential of GPS 
by negatively impacting GPS receivers. 
Ligado’s proposed accommodations of identi-
fying and then repairing or replacing poten-
tially-impacted legacy equipment is not fea-
sible, affordable or technically executable 
given the vast number of systems impli-
cated, including critical national security 
and weapon systems. Accordingly, DoD re-
mains strongly opposed to granting the li-
cense modification sought by Ligado. 
On December 6, 2019, the Acting Deputy As-
sistant Secretary of Commerce for Commu-
nications and Information and the Adminis-
trator of the NTIA sent a letter to the Chair-
man of the FCC indicating the executive 
branch could not support approval of the li-
cense modification request of Ligado. This 
decision was supported by recommendations 
by the National Space-based Positioning, 
Navigation, and Timing Executive Com-
mittee (PNT EXCOM) and by the June and 
November 2019 letters from the Secretary of 
Defense expressing strong opposition to the 
Ligado license modification request. 
DoD is providing this supplemental infor-
mation in support of the NTIA letter with 
specific focus on expected national security 
and defense impacts to GPS, including oper-
ational impacts to the warfighter, if the pro-
posed license modification request were 
granted. 
The Department is providing the following 
specific information in three categories: 1) 
national defense mission categories that 
would be negatively impacted; 2) cost and re-
source implications of identifying and re-
pairing or replacing any potentially ad-
versely affected GPS receivers supporting 
national defense missions; and 3) the time, 
disruption, and programmatic impact to 
identify and repair or replace the potentially 
affected GPS receivers supporting national 
defense missions. Individually and collec-
tively, each of these categories would ad-
versely affect the national defense and secu-
rity of the United States. It is the Depart-
ment’s position that there are no practical 
measures to meaningfully mitigate the im-
pact of the proposed Ligado license modifica-
tion. 
The mitigation measures Ligado has pro-
posed are impractical and un-executable in 
that they would shift the risk of interference 
to, and place enormous burdens on, agencies 
and other GPS users to monitor and report 
the interference. Moreover, Ligado’s mitiga-
tion proposals would not protect the vast 
majority of GPS receivers, such as airborne 
uses, that are not restricted to specific de-
fined areas of operation such as military in-
stallations. Ligado’s proposal to replace gov-
ernment GPS receivers that are affected by 
its proposed network, is a tacit admission 
that there would be interference, and is fur-
ther addressed below in terms of cost, oper-
ational and mission impact, and timelines to 
replace these receivers. Additionally, the 
mitigation proposal by Ligado, even if tech-
nically feasible, only covers those receivers 
owned by the government and would leave 
many high-value federal uses of civil GPS re-
ceivers not owned by the government, such 
as high precision receivers, vulnerable to in-
terference, as Ligado has admitted in its fil-
ings. 
EXPECTED OPERATIONAL AND MISSION IMPACTS 
The U.S. National Security Strategy em-
phasizes the importance of maintaining lead-
ership and freedom of action in space as a 
vital U.S. interest as well as responding to 
any interference to the Department’s critical 
space capabilities. The National Defense 
Strategy stresses the importance of building 
a more lethal force and strengthening (inter-
operable) alliances and partnerships. GPS is 
one such space capability critical to the 
lethality of the Department’s forces and 
around which, over the years, the Depart-
ment has structured its weapons systems and 
business processes. GPS is widely and heav-
ily integrated throughout DoD in operations 
and applications including, but not limited 
to, precision weapons, air, land, and sea 
navigation, communications and network 
synchronization, command and control, civil 
engineering, and surveillance applications. 
Given the sophistication, classification, and 
the nature of how GPS receivers are embed-
ded into all aspects of DoD testing, training, 
exercise and operations, it would be prac-
tically impossible for DoD to identify and re-
pair or replace all of the potentially ad-
versely affected receivers. These are not sim-
ple ‘‘plug-n-play’’ devices but would require 
significant time and resources to effect soft-
ware modifications, trial and testing, and 
validation. The Department simply cannot 
accept such negative operational and mis-
sion impacts to our warfighting capabilities. 
In addition, military GPS receivers are also 
used by Federal civil agencies, specifically 
the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration (NASA), the Department of Home-
land Security (DHS), and the Department of 
State through agreements with the DoD. For 
example, NASA uses high-precision military 
GPS receivers for their launch anomaly 
monitoring and destruct systems. DHS and 
the border patrol use military GPS receivers 
in unmanned aerial surveillance systems 
(UAS). In addition, some law enforcement 
and intelligence agencies use military GPS 
in their UAS. The State Department’s diplo-
matic security service also uses military 
GPS receivers. It would be untenable for the 
United States to pursue an initiative that 
undermines these capabilities, and it would

be exceptionally detrimental to national se-
curity. 
Ligado’s proposal would have significant 
effect on legacy military receivers and civil 
receivers used by DoD. 
Legacy Military GPS Receivers: Modern-
ized GPS receivers cannot replace all mili-
tary GPS receivers currently in use. Even 
after the transition to modernized military 
receivers is completed (by 2035 at the ear-
liest), some high precision receivers would 
remain vulnerable to interference from the 
Ligado network transmissions. Remaining 
legacy military receivers are unable to lock 
onto weak signals and lack the anti-jam ca-
pabilities more typical of more modern mili-
tary receivers. In addition to continued mili-
tary use, other Federal agencies and many 
partner nations will continue to use these 
legacy high precision receivers. Even as the 
U.S. military transitions to modernized GPS 
receivers, it is unclear as to when, or if, leg-
acy GPS high precision receivers used by 
other critical agencies will be modernized. 
Civil GPS Receivers Used by DoD: DoD 
makes use of civil GPS receivers in non-com-
bat environments, such as surveying, flight 
training, training, exercises, other national 
security events, and scientific applications. 
Like their civilian counterparts, DoD sur-
veyors and construction units often rely on 
high-precision GPS receivers that are ex-
ceedingly sensitive to interference from sig-
nals at nearby frequencies. As analysis indi-
cates, these high precision GPS receivers po-
tentially could be adversely affected at sig-
nificant distances from the Ligado-proposed 
terrestrial transmitters, which would nega-
tively impact high precision receiver use in 
major military installations near urban 
areas of the United States. Ligado has ad-
mitted in its filings that there would be such 
interference. Additionally, both civilian and 
commercial applications for high precision 
wideband-GPS provide far-reaching benefits 
to the public interest, including capabilities 
that go beyond the PNT services for which it 
was originally developed. The great poten-
tial capabilities wideband GPS applications 
hold would also be the most susceptible to 
the adjacent band interference from Ligado’s 
proposed network. Further, DoD uses civil 
and commercial infrastructure of many 
types on bases and test/training ranges do-
mestically and abroad. To the extent that 
operation of commercial infrastructure is de-
graded by Ligados proposed signals, DoD’s 
use of electrical power, communications net-
works, operation of unmanned vehicles (in-
cluding UAS), precision landings, helicopter 
operations, collection of location based serv-
ices data, first responder applications, and 
other applications demanding high accuracy 
would be at increased risk. 
COST AND RESOURCE IMPACT 
By 2024, DoD will have invested more than 
$15 billion taxpayer dollars since 2000 to sus-
tain and modernize the GPS constellation 
and continue to modernize GPS user equip-
ment integration across the force. As de-
scribed earlier, almost every GPS receiver 
fielded throughout the DoD joint force po-
tentially could be adversely affected if 
Ligado’s proposal is approved. As indicated 
in the Fiscal Year 2020 President’s Budget, 
DoD is currently planning to spend more 
than $1.8 billion taxpayer dollars to procure, 
integrate and test modernized GPS receivers, 
from 2019–2024, into user platforms across the 
Services. The $1.8 billion figure will grow to 
a total of approximately $3.5 billion when all 
of the approximately 1 million GPS receivers 
currently 
in 
the 
DoD 
inventory 
are 
transitioned to modernized GPS receivers 
before 2035. This cost includes the integra-
tion of the receivers into each of thousands 
of different air, maritime, and ground vehi-
cles, as well as weapons. 
Regarding Ligado’s proposal to identify 
and repair or replace potentially affected 
GPS receivers owned by the U.S. govern-
ment, given the classified nature of the mili-
tary use and the sheer number of platforms 
potentially affected, Ligado could not pos-
sibly know the magnitude of the problem or 
the costs and operational impacts relative to 
military receivers. To avoid an adverse ef-
fect to the Department’s capabilities if 
Ligado’s proposal were approved, DoD would 
need to undertake unprecedented accelerated 
testing, modification, and integration ac-
tions, which is cost- and schedule-prohibitive 
and would likely result in significantly de-
graded national security. For each integra-
tion, DoD would need to take the asset out of 
service, test the platform to ensure that the 
upgrade worked as planned and did not cause 
a negative impact to other parts of the weap-
ons system prior to re-fielding. To be clear, 
every weapons system or platform in the 
DoD inventory must be tested as an inte-
grated system and it would cause significant 
operational impact (including substantial re-
testing) if modernized military GPS receiv-
ers require further modification. Adding 
such a requirement to mitigate the adverse 
effect to the military potential of GPS from 
this potential interference would be ex-
tremely difficult and likely cost prohibitive 
given current technology. 
TIME REQUIRED TO REPLACE IMPACTED 
RECEIVERS 
Modification or replacement of GPS re-
ceivers within DoD has historically taken 
approximately a decade due to the sheer re-
ceiver numbers, complications with how re-
ceivers are integrated in thousands of plat-
forms and systems, depot and scheduling, 
and global operations. The first M-code capa-
ble receivers are now going through integra-
tion and testing and will begin installation 
in DoD platforms beginning in 2020. The full 
transition is not expected to be complete 
until at least 2035, based on past experience 
transitioning from first and second-genera-
tion GPS equipment to the present third 
generation. Any change to the requirements 
for these modernized receivers as a result of 
approving Ligado’s proposed network and 
the need to mitigate the resultant inter-
ference would only extend that timeline, 
putting DoD forces and warfighting capabili-
ties at risk due to the rapidly evolving 
threats. 
It is therefore DoD’s position that approval 
of Ligado’s proposal would adversely affect 
the military potential of GPS significantly, 
based on the extensive testing done by DoD 
and others. Consistent with 10 U.S.C. § 2281, 
DoD cannot accept this adverse impact to 
military use of GPS and the resultant nega-
tive operational impacts to our warfighting 
capabilities. Modification or replacement of 
GPS receivers across the force to avoid ad-
verse impacts from such a proposal, even if a 
solution were shown to be feasible, could 
take on the order of billions of dollars and 
delay fielding of modified equipment needed 
to respond to rapidly evolving threats by 
decades. 
In his June 7, 2019 letter to FCC Chairman 
Pai, Acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan 
stated there are too many unknowns and the 
risks are far too great to federal operations 
to allow Ligado’s proposed system to pro-
ceed. We collectively agree with that assess-
ment. Accordingly, the Department of De-
fense, pursuant to its statutory duties, re-
states its formal objection to Ligados re-
quest for a license modification and, along 
with the below signatories, requests that it 
be rejected.

[From the Wall Street Journal, May 5, 2020] 
THE FCC’S DECISION PUTS GPS AT RISK 
(By Mark Esper) 
Every day, tens of millions of Americans 
rely on the Global Positioning System. We 
use it for location features in cellphones, 
navigation for vehicles and aircraft, and fi-
nancial and commercial transactions, in-
cluding ATM withdrawals. And every day, 
the Defense Department and our colleagues 
across government use GPS to protect and 
serve the public by coordinating global 
trade, banking and transportation, as well as 
tracking terrorists and other threats to U.S. 
national security. 
A recent decision by the Federal Commu-
nications Commission, however, will degrade 
the effectiveness and reliability of this crit-
ical technology. On April 20, the FCC an-
nounced its approval of Ligado Networks’ ap-
plication to create a cellular network by 
repurposing a portion of radio spectrum ad-
jacent to that used by GPS. The power and 
proximity of Ligado’s ground emissions on 
this spectrum will drown out GPS’s space- 
based signals. If you’ve ever tried to talk to 
a friend while standing next to the speakers 
at a rock concert, you get the point. 
In announcing its recent decision, the FCC 
rehashed Ligado’s old arguments, wrapped in 
new language, to say that the company has 
made changes and the FCC has set condi-
tions to ensure GPS won’t be affected. Don’t 
be fooled. The sheer number of cases of inter-
ference combined with the difficulty of attri-
bution will make enforcement nearly impos-
sible, not to mention expensive. 
Independent testing and analyses con-
ducted by nine federal departments and 
agencies show that allowing Ligado’s pro-
posed system—including its proposed modi-
fications—to operate in close proximity to 
the GPS spectrum would cause harmful in-
terference to millions of GPS receivers 
across the U.S. The FCC’s decision will dis-
rupt the daily lives and commerce of mil-
lions of Americans and inject unacceptable 
risk into systems that are critical for emer-
gency response, aviation and missile defense. 
Further, it will stunt innovation in GPS; 
people won’t use the system if they can’t de-
pend on it everywhere, all the time. For 
these and many other reasons, 13 federal 
agencies, along with leaders from a range of 
industries, called on the FCC to deny the 
Ligado request. 
Ligado claims it is the solution to Amer-
ica’s 5G woes, but its proposed license modi-
fication isn’t really about 5G. There is no 
evidence that the company has a technically 
viable 5G solution. This is about one com-
pany changing the rules to maximize the

May 12, 2020 
value of its spectrum, and the cost to Ameri-
cans is too great to justify. 
The Defense Department recognizes that 
5G technology is vital to maintaining Amer-
ica’s strategic and economic advantage over 
its competitors. We strongly support Presi-
dent Trump’s call for the U.S. private sector 
to lead the way, and we’re moving quickly to 
develop opportunities to share midband spec-
trum, a finite resource. As demand outpaces 
supply, spectrum sharing holds the key to 
U.S. dominance in 5G. The Defense Depart-
ment will dedicate millions of dollars to test 
5G technologies at military bases, while pro-
moting collaboration among government 
agencies, academia, and allied countries to 
advance a 5G solution. 
We need a comprehensive, whole-of-nation 
approach to develop technologies that affect 
so many. Disregarding the concerns of indus-
try and government—objections grounded in 
hard data—the FCC’s Ligado decision is a 
shortsighted giveaway that will disrupt our 
way of life and potentially cost the Amer-
ican people billions of dollars. 
The first and most sacred responsibility of 
government is to protect and defend its peo-
ple. GPS allows us to pinpoint 911 calls, 
launch precision airstrikes, prepare our 
forces for combat, and otherwise act to safe-
guard health and well-being. Interfering with 
the accuracy and reliability of GPS risks the 
safety of the American people and under-
mines 
national 
and 
economic 
security. 
America deserves a better alternative. 
Mr. INHOFE. We can’t allow this to 
stand, and all of America agrees. In the 
last 3 weeks, stakeholders from across 
the country and across the economy 
have expressed their opposition to the 
FCC decision. 
Not just the military, but all of gov-
ernment and the private sector—in-
cluding airlines, pilots, farmers, truck-
ers, marine manufacturers, conserva-
tionists, equipment manufacturers and 
distributors, road builders, weather 
forecasters, and GPS device makers— 
are opposed to the Ligado’s applica-
tion. 
I know my colleagues here in the 
Senate have heard from all of these 
groups, representing jobs and Ameri-
cans from every single State who use 
these GPS and satellite services every 
day. This has happened nationally. 
People realized, all of a sudden, that 
GPS would be affected by this. 
I ask my colleagues to consider who 
supports the Ligado—hedge fund inves-
tors. No one is supporting it. It is my 
understanding, from talking to the 
people close to the FCC, that the FCC 
was expected to reject the Ligado pro-
posal once and for all. They had al-
ready rejected it before. It has been 
there. The unanimous opposition from 
the interagency review committee was 
not surprising, but the final outcome 
was shocking. 
With all of this opposition, how could 
the FCC decide, in the cover of dark-
ness over a weekend, that the unani-
mous concern of GPS interference was 
worth the risk to support the invest-
ments of hedge fund investors? I can’t 
figure out what happened, nor can the 
former FCC Commissioners. Why did 
the FCC change its course and in such 
a dramatic fashion? We may never 
know. But we do know that Ligado has 
spent $1.3 million in just 2020. That is 
the company that we are talking 
about. They have spent $1.3 million on 
lobbyists trying to convince Congress 
that their proposal is a good idea. 
This chart shows the list of all of the 
lobbyists that come up to $1.38 million. 
Keep in mind that is just for 3 months. 
Over a period of a year, you can mul-
tiply that by four. Ligado is hiring 
whoever they can to convince you to 
support the hedge fund investors. That 
is one of the reasons I am talking 
about this today. I am not sure what 
form it will take to reverse this deci-
sion. People have to hear from people 
before they realize how bad this is. 
When you have this many people— 
one of the individuals was a former 
chairman of the House Armed Services 
Committee and turned lobbyist. He is a 
guy who spent his career building the 
military. Obviously, he is one of the 
lobbyists supporting this thing. 
Ligado said this order is about win-
ning the race for 5G and beating China. 
Those who claim Ligado’s proposal was 
necessary to defeat China’s 5G push are 
deliberately mixing up two different 
and important spectrum issues in order 
to sell their product—the share of the 
mid-band 5G spectrum by DOD with in-
dustry and harmful interference of 
Ligado’s signal with the low band— 
that is L band, which we are talking 
about, which is right next to GPS sig-
nals that would be used in nearly every 
aspect of daily life. 
The 
Ligado 
spectrum 
they 
are 
repurposing is not in the prime mid- 
band spectrum being considered for 5G. 
Ligado’s low-band spectrum was not a 
part of the FCC’s own plan to accel-
erate 5G development released in Sep-
tember of 2018, the so-called ‘‘5G FAST 
Plan.’’ 
I would like to say that it is com-
plicated, but that isn’t what they did 
at all with this thing. Their concern 
was with only the L band, which is 
next to the GPS. 
Reliable GPS satellite communica-
tion is important to everyone in Amer-
ica. It drives much of the Nation’s 
economy. We shouldn’t sacrifice GPS 
reliability for the sake of lobbyists and 
hedge fund investors on Wall Street. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
urging the FCC to withdraw its ap-
proval of Ligado’s application. Instead 
of moving ahead with this order, we 
have to reverse the order. That is the 
effort that is taking place right now. If 
they had denied Ligado’s application 
the same as they have done for the last 
10 years, there would not be a problem 
today. We have people with an interest 
in this. 
The hearing that we had just on May 
6 was with the people who head up Data 
DC and the DOD Chief Information Of-
ficer. By the way, in the private sector 
he was the CIO of three of the largest 
corporations in America. We had Dr. 
Michael Griffin, Undersecretary of De-
fense for Research and Engineering, a 
retired U.S. Coast Guard Admiral; 
Thad Allen, who is now on the National 
Space-Based Positioning, Navigation, 
and Timing Advisory Board; and Gen. 
Jay Raymond, Chief of Space Oper-
ations, U.S. Space Force. That is ev-
eryone who is really knowledgeable 
about this. They are all unanimous in 
their opposition to this program. 
I would ask that Members keep ad-
vised of the opportunities they have to 
reverse this decision. We would actu-
ally try to get the Federal Communica-
tions Commission to do that on their 
own. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the vote scheduled for 4:30 
p.m. start at this time. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Edgar nomina-
tion?

(The remarks of Mr. GRASSLEY per-
taining to the introduction of S. 3693 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Statements on Introduced Bills and 
Joint Resolutions.’’) 
NATIONAL POLICE WEEK 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
today I come to the floor to salute and 
thank our Nation’s law enforcement of-
ficers during this year’s National Po-
lice Week. It is notable that this week 
dedicated to the brave men and women 
in blue is in the midst of the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
I am grateful to all who are working 
on the front lines right now, whether 
they are doctors and nurses or teachers 
and grocery store clerks. We are grate-
ful to all of them, including a lot of 
jobs that I haven’t even mentioned. 
But this week, we have the unique 
opportunity just to settle on one group 
of people and thank them in a special 
way during National Police Week, and 
that is our police officers. Now, more 
than ever, we appreciate their service 
and dedication. Being a police officer 
isn’t just a job. I am in public service, 
but I haven’t been a police officer. I 
think it is fair to assume that they put 
their lives on the line more than most 
of us who are Members of the Senate. 
It is not just a job. It is a calling. 
Each officer has answered that call and 
is dutifully serving during these very 
trying times that we call this virus 
pandemic. For that, I am—and, I am 
sure, everybody is—forever grateful. 
I am particularly thankful for the 
men and women in blue who serve my 
fellow Iowans. I would also like to rec-
ognize the officers who serve in Wash-
ington, DC, the Capitol Police, mean-
ing those who serve here on the Hill. 
They work to ensure our safety and 
protection, not only from criminals but 
also from a virus that has drastically 
changed the way we work in the Senate 
to serve our constituents, the Amer-
ican people, and, for me, the people of 
Iowa. Thank you to the policemen on 
Capitol Hill here for your selflessness 
and dedication. 
COVID–19 knows no boundaries and 
has, unfortunately, affected hundreds 
of police officers. As of May 11, 101 offi-
cers have died in the line of duty from 
the virus. We must continue to honor 
members of the law enforcement com-
munity who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice. The circumstances of loss are 
a little different now but no less heroic 
or devastating. 
As a Senator, my actions often speak 
louder than my words. So I am pleased 
to show the members of the law en-
forcement community how much I sup-
port and appreciate you through legis-
lation. Every year, during Police Week, 
the Senate advances various bills fo-
cusing on the needs of the police com-
munity. This year is no different. To 
that end, I recently introduced a bipar-
tisan bill with the title of Safeguarding 
America’s First Responders Act. This 
bill addresses the unfortunate reality 
of officers’ exposure to COVID–19. 
To ensure benefits through the Pub-
lic Safety Officer Benefits Program, 
my bill creates a presumption that if a 
first 
responder 
is 
diagnosed 
with 
COVID–19 within 45 days of their last 
day on duty, the Justice Department 
will treat it as a line-of-duty incident. 
Loss of a family member in the line 
of duty isn’t only emotionally dev-
astating, but it also means lost wages 
in tough times. This bill recognizes the 
challenges posed by the pandemic and 
better ensures that officers’ families 
will get the financial help as promised 
to other police officers who are killed 
in other ways in the line of duty. This 
bill enjoys wide support from multiple 
law enforcement groups and a group of 
bipartisan cosponsors here in the Sen-
ate. 
The Senate is considering two other 
police bills that I support. Police offi-
cers have demanding jobs and experi-
ence events that often impact their 
mental health. The next bill is named 
the Confidentiality Opportunities for 
Peer Support Counseling Act, or we 
call it COPS Counseling Act, for short. 
This bill builds off the recommenda-
tions provided by the Justice Depart-
ment in their recent report on law en-
forcement mental health and wellness 
issues. 
Specifically, the bill provides con-
fidentiality to Federal law enforce-
ment officers by restricting individuals 
who participate in peer support coun-
seling sessions from disclosing commu-
nications arising out of these sessions. 
With that privacy, we encourage more 
people to get the help they might need. 
Peer support programs serve as a val-
uable role in providing mental health 
care to law enforcement and first re-
sponders. But as I have indicated, con-
fidentiality concerns have left these 
programs and these professionals un-
derutilized. This bill also encourages 
best practices for officers and for first 
responders on peer support programs 
across the country. 
I want to thank Senator CORTEZ 
MASTO for leading this bill and teaming 
up with me on this important issue. 
Lastly, I am proud to cosponsor Sen-
ator HAWLEY’s bill, with a title of Law 
Enforcement Suicide Data Collection 
Act. This bill seeks to address mental 
illness and increasing suicide numbers 
among law enforcement by requiring 
the FBI to open a voluntary data col-
lection program to track suicides and 
attempted suicides within local, Trib-
al, State, and Federal law enforcement. 
By providing accurate and detailed in-
formation on these issues of suicide, 
more effective prevention programs 
can be implemented. 
I urge my colleagues to support all 
three of these bills. Passing them into 
law is one way of saying a big thank- 
you to the brave men and women who 
serve us so selflessly in law enforce-
ment. We owe them a debt of gratitude, 
particularly 
during 
the 
ongoing 
COVID–19 pandemic.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-

ators permitted to speak therein for up 
to 10 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I 
wish to state for the record that, 
though the difficulties of traveling 
across the country in the midst of the 
current coronavirus pandemic made it 
impossible for me to present in the 
Capitol to vote on the nomination 
Brian D. Montgomery, of Texas, to be 
Deputy 
Secretary 
of 
Housing 
and 
Urban Development, I would have 
voted ‘nay’ had I been present. 
Few things create a stronger founda-
tion for a thriving, successful families 
than affordable housing. Study after 
study has shown that children who 
grow up in a stable home do better in 
school and are more successful over the 
course of their lives. Stable affordable 
housing builds strong neighborhoods 
and communities because the members 
of that community are invested in its 
success. For generations of Americans, 
homeownership has been a driving 
force behind the building of a strong 
middle class, helping families build 
wealth through the equity generated 
through homeownership. 
As the son of a union mechanic, I ex-
perienced this throughout my own life. 
My father’s wages were enough to af-
ford a modest ranch home in a blue col-
lar Oregon community. And because of 
that house and that community, I was 
given all kinds of opportunities. I was 
allowed to explore my interests, wheth-
er it was taking machines apart and 
putting them back together again in 
my dad’s garage or exploring the great 
outdoors as a Boy Scout. I was able to 
receive a good public education and go 
on to be the first in my family to grad-
uate from college. 
But far too many Americans don’t 
have those same opportunities today. 
That is because the goal of affordable 
housing, whether buying a house or 
renting a decent apartment, is out of 
reach for too many working and mid-
dle-class families and falling further

out of reach with every day that 
passes. Prior to this pandemic, we saw 
rents and home prices rising twice as 
fast as worker’s incomes. Today, the 
cost of a typical single-family home is 
four times greater than the median 
household income. 
We need a Deputy Secretary of Hous-
ing and Urban Development who will 
make it a priority to reverse the tra-
jectory that we have been on and to ac-
tually make housing more affordable 
in America. This position is responsible 
for management of all day-to-day oper-
ations within HUD, including roughly 
7,700 employees. They oversee a budget 
of approximately $50 billion that funds 
a number of programs meant to provide 
quality, affordable housing for lower 
income Americans, provides rental as-
sistance for low-income families, and 
distributes grants to states and com-
munities for various housing-related 
purposes and also enforces the Fair 
Housing Act. 
Brian Montgomery is not the person 
for the job. 
In his current role as the FHA Com-
missioner, Mr. Montgomery has sup-
ported policies from the Trump admin-
istration that would increase the cost 
of FHA loans and include risk-based 
pricing, continuing to make homeown-
ership even less affordable for those 
who can least afford it. He was also 
part of the senior leadership team that 
published a rule that would help under-
mine enforcement of the Fair Housing 
Act through the Disparate Impact 
Study. The disparate impact standard 
is a longstanding tool used to root out 
policies and practices that may not be 
openly discriminatory on their face, 
but disproportionally harm a protected 
class under the Fair Housing Act. The 
proposed rule that Mr. Montgomery 
helped create—and which is vigorously 
opposed by a coalition of fair housing, 
civil rights, and consumer groups—rigs 
the system to make it nearly impos-
sible for a victim of discrimination to 
win a disparate impact claim. 
A person who has used his current po-
sition to make it harder for low- and 
middle-income Americans to afford to 
buy a home should not serve in a top- 
tier position as the equivalent of the 
Department of Housing and Urban De-
velopment’s chief financial officer. We 
need individuals in these positions 
fighting to get families into homes, not 
pushing that dream further and further 
out of reach. Therefore, I oppose Mr. 
Montgomery’s nomination to serve as 
the Deputy Secretary of Housing and 
Urban Development and would have 
voted nay, had I been able to be 
present.

TRIBUTE TO REAR ADMIRAL BRAD 
COOPER 
Mr. 
INHOFE. 
Madam 
President, 
today I wish to recognize and congratu-
late Rear Admiral Brad Cooper of the 
U.S. Navy on his exemplary service to 
our Nation as the Department of the 
Navy’s Chief of Legislative Affairs 
from July 2019 to May 2020. During this 
time, he led with precision and class. 
Eleven months—a short period, yet 
the presence of the Navy here in the 
Capitol and the results we have seen 
since last July would indicate a labor 
of a much longer period. In that time, 
he has served under various leaders, 
yet in spite of that, the Department of 
the Navy has never been more strongly 
integrated with Congress than it is 
today. 
Through 
dedication 
and 
impactful communication, Brad has 
deftly navigated his team, our staffs, 
and our mutual partnership to new 
heights. 
Brad has had the challenge of being 
the Navy’s lead advocate on Capitol 
Hill and has had the privilege of com-
municating with all Members of Con-
gress, which inherently is no small 
feat. The hidden mission therein is the 
tireless jobs of educating our staffs, 
precisely executing congressional dele-
gations on all continents, supporting 
hearings, and negotiating the NDAA. 
He has handled our thousands of con-
stituent inquiries and properly rep-
resented the Navy while taking into 
account military, political, and budg-
etary priorities. 
Brad is the reason senior Navy lead-
ers are always well prepared to stand 
before us during all hearings, calls, and 
numerous briefings. His clear, concise, 
and consistent communication to the 
Hill during the COVID–19 pandemic, en-
sured the Navy’s efforts for the safety 
of sailors and their families and the 
execution of all missions to support the 
national defense strategy and safety 
and security of our Nation was well un-
derstood. Because of Brad’s profes-
sionalism and visible commitment to 
the Navy and our country, he certainly 
established lasting relationships with 
all of the Members of Congress. 
On behalf of my colleagues and the 
entire U.S. Congress, I want to person-
ally thank Rear Admiral Brad Cooper 
for his more than three decades of dedi-
cated service to the Navy and our Na-
tion. He will be certainly missed. I also 
want to thank his wife, Susan, and 
children Bradford and Katie for their 
deep sacrifices and tremendous sup-
port. I wish them all the best in his 
next assignment in Norfolk, VA, and I 
sincerely look forward to working with 
him again in the future. Fair winds and 
following seas to you.

TRIBUTE TO LOLETA MARIE 
‘‘LETA’’ RECORD TANNER 
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I would 
like to say a few words to send best 
wishes to a good friend of mine on her 
next adventure, LoLeta Marie ‘‘Leta’’ 
Record Tanner. I recently learned that 
Leta will be moving to Texas from our 
great State of Wyoming to live with 
her son. While I am overjoyed that she 
can be with her family, I am deeply 
saddened that Wyoming will no longer 
be the physical home to such a dedi-
cated, strong, and loving person. 
Leta was born in Gillette, WY, in 
1930. She graduated from Campbell 
County High School and then traveled 
to Denver, where she graduated from a 
small community college. A dedicated 
public 
servant 
and 
Wyomingite 
through and through, Leta served for 
more than 15 years in the Campbell 
County Assessor’s office and district 
court and 12 years as a member of the 
Gillette City Council. She also worked 
for former Wyoming Senator Al Simp-
son for 10 years, both in his northeast 
State office and in Washington, DC. 
While her political career alone is 
impressive, Leta was always involved 
and giving her time to Wyoming. Leta 
is a dedicated member of the ranching 
community and the community at 
large as a member of Campbell County 
Cattle Women, Campbell County Wool 
Growers Auxiliary, and a member of 
Women in Business, just to name a few. 
She loved nothing more than working 
on the ranch with her family, and has 
worked tirelessly to support the next 
generation in agriculture. 
In 2002, Leta was the Campbell Coun-
ty Woman of distinction. She has done 
many wonderful things for the Gillette 
community and the State of Wyoming. 
She has been a generous supporter of 
family-oriented performance at the 
Cam-Plex Heritage Center in Gillette 
since 1996. In 2013, her donation to Gil-
lette College in support of their Agri-
culture Education Center and Rodeo 
complex made it a reality. This state of 
the art facility features an indoor 
rodeo practice area, classroom, lab, and 
20-stall loafing sheds. It is quite pos-
sible that, without Leta’s support, this 
world-class facility and many other 
projects would not have come to fru-
ition. The dorms at Gillette College 
will forever bear the name Tanner Vil-
lage. Her willingness to help the com-
munity grow and thrive will never be 
forgotten. 
I am reminded of a few words my 
mother taught me: ‘‘Do what’s right. 
Do what’s best. Treat others as you’d 
wish to be treated.’’ Leta certainly em-
bodied these principles and will con-
tinue to do so. Although she will be 
leaving our great State, Leta’s legacy 
will live on and continue to be an ex-
ample of just what is possible for Wyo-
mingites of all ages. 
Leta, thank you for your years of 
tireless service to Wyoming. Diana 
joins me in sending our best wishes to 
you and your family. Stay in touch. 
Wyoming will always be your home. 
Thank you and God bless.

TRIBUTE TO KAREN NYBERG 
Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, I 
want to honor a remarkable woman 
who has retired after three decades at 
the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration. In her 30 years at 
NASA, Karen Nyberg spent 20 of them 
as an astronaut, including 180 days in 
space on two spaceflights. 
Along with other Americans, I en-
joyed following her space shuttle mis-
sion in 2008 and the International 
Space Station’s 6-month expedition in

2013. During her space shuttle mission, 
she became the 50th woman in space. 
While on the International Space Sta-
tion, she shared unique personal mes-
sages, including videos on how to wash 
hair in space, make a stuffed animal, 
and work on a quilt. I have since be-
come acquainted with her as an alum-
na of the University of North Dakota, 
where she earned a mechanical engi-
neering degree in 1994. A native of 
Vining, MN, she is one of 11 NASA as-
tronauts who have ties to the Dakotas 
and Minnesota. 
Karen has given back to her alma 
mater, where she has served on the 
foundation board of the UND School of 
Aerospace Sciences. There students 
from across the globe in the Depart-
ment of Space Studies learn about cut-
ting-edge technologies and scientific 
breakthroughs in space exploration. 
Their coursework includes studying fu-
ture space trips, including a mission to 
Mars. 
Last July, our Nation observed the 
50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mis-
sion to the Moon. I recall as an 8-year- 
old watching history unfold on our 
black-and-white 
television, 
joining 
millions around the world in the ex-
hilaration of this technological feat. 
In the half-century since the first 
moon landing, space exploration has 
had phenomnal impact on the world, 
which I believe is underappreciated by 
the average citizen. Karen’s contribu-
tions to space exploration during 30 of 
those years have added to our greater 
understanding of our world and uni-
verse. 
There is a bright future for America 
to lead the world with commercial, 
technological, and military space mis-
sions. The work of astronauts like 
Karen and the future impact of current 
students at institutions like the Uni-
versity of North Dakota inspire us to 
move forward with these vital endeav-
ors. 
On behalf of all North Dakotans, I 
send my sincere congratulations to 
Karen Nyberg on her distinguished ca-
reer at NASA and for all she has 
brought to this new frontier. 
Best wishes on your well-earned re-
tirement, Karen, and I hope our paths 
will cross often. We will join in wishing 
godspeed at the end of this month to 
your husband, Doug Hurley, and his 
space shuttle crew on their historic 
flight 
from 
Florida 
to 
the 
Inter-
national Space Station.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING FRED KELLY 
GRANT 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today 
I honor Fred Kelly Grant. In March, 
our Nation unfortunately lost a rea-
soned, dedicated, and outstanding ad-
vocate for locally driven decision-mak-
ing. However, Fred leaves a lasting re-
membrance in the extraordinarily posi-
tive impact he had on so many people. 
Fred, who was born in South Carolina 
and grew up in Idaho, earned a degree 
in history at the College of Idaho be-
fore earning his law degree at the Uni-
versity of Chicago Law School. His 
early career included serving as an As-
sistant U.S. Attorney in Baltimore 
from 1963–1965. He then served as As-
sistant State’s Attorney for Baltimore 
City, where he was appointed chief of 
the organized crime division. He then 
practiced criminal law in private prac-
tice before returning to Idaho and serv-
ing as counsel for two former Idaho 
Governors, Cecil Andrus and John 
Evans. He also served as law clerk for 
Judge Edward J. Lodge from 1975–1980, 
and he provided legal, political assist-
ance to local governments, businesses, 
and individuals throughout his career. 
Further, Fred served on multiple com-
missions, authored books, and led orga-
nizations. This includes him helping to 
start the Stand and Fight Club focused 
on preventing regulatory agencies from 
doing economic harm to rural America. 
Countless people all around the coun-
try were influenced and helped by Fred. 
Fred was a long-time Idaho lawyer, but 
his influence and know-how reached far 
beyond our Idaho borders. In a 2017 
Washington Times Article, Fred was 
aptly characterized as an ‘‘unsung hero 
of rural America.’’ He gave needed 
weight to requiring the Federal Gov-
ernment to coordinate with localities 
when implementing new rules. He em-
phasized local policy and local plans as 
drivers of the economy. Fred cham-
pioned this effort in Idaho and nation-
ally, extending important information 
and experience to other local govern-
ments across the nation. In so doing, 
he advanced the ideal of those closest 
to the land rightly driving natural re-
sources and environmental solutions. 
This emphasis on locally driven, col-
laborative land management decisions 
was the central focus of the Owyhee 
Initiative. Fred masterfully provided 
local leadership at a critical time in 
the history—and future—of Owyhee 
County. The Owyhee Initiative, ush-
ered into law through the hard work 
and strength of purpose of Fred and 
other 
Owyhee 
Initiative 
partners, 
maintains a thoughtful balance of mul-
tiple uses required for the betterment 
of an amazing part of our great state 
and country. The collaborative efforts 
furthered in the Owyhee Initiative re-
main an example of the great achieve-
ments that are possible when we all 
come to the table and work through 
the differences to find the common 
ground. 
My staff and I knew him best during 
the many years of sustained effort on 
the Owyhee Initiative, yet we are 
aware that his life reached many peo-
ple well beyond that important work. 
Many have shared messages describing 
Fred. The tributes share words in com-
mon: perseverance, remarkable intel-
ligence, created lasting friendships, 
wisdom, deeply caring, empathetic, 
perceptive, quick wit, and love. All of 
these characteristics and more are but 
a start in describing Fred. 
For me, perhaps the sense of personal 
respect and understanding I had for 
Fred are what seem most powerful. The 
previously 
mentioned 
Washington 
Times article from three years ago, in-
cluded a quote from Fred stating, ‘‘I’m 
tempted all the time to retire . . . But, 
I truly believe in this nation and I 
think there are too few people who un-
derstand and believe in the core prin-
ciple of the federal republic, and if we 
lose that, I believe we lose what makes 
the Constitution the most perfect in-
strument of government that’s ever 
been created.’’ He lived this and left a 
lasting charge for all of us never to let 
up in smartly pushing back against 
Federal supersession of local decision- 
making. I extend my deepest sympathy 
to Fred’s widow, Carol, and all of 
Fred’s family and friends. We all miss 
Fred and are grateful for his life, leg-
acy and friendship.∑

REMEMBERING J. KIRK SULLIVAN 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today 
I honor J. Kirk Sullivan, who had a 
long-time, distinguished career in prin-
cipal Idaho industries and politics. 
Kirk was born and raised in Green-
wood, SC. His alma mater is Clemson 
University, where he earned bachelor’s 
and master’s degrees in Chemistry and 
a 
Ph.D. 
in 
Chemical 
Engineering. 
Throughout his life, Kirk continued to 
support Clemson along with other edu-
cational 
institutions, 
especially 
in 
Idaho. As he began his career, Kirk 
went to work for FMC Corporation in 
South Charleston, WV, and met his 
wife, Betty. Over their 59 years of mar-
riage, the couple had two children, Hal 
and Kim, and three grandchildren, 
Matthew, Adam, and Sara. In 1965, Kirk 
and Betty moved to Pocatello. Kirk’s 
obituary reads, ‘‘Kirk had a deep love 
for the State of Idaho and chose to 
make this place his home for 50 years.’’ 
After the Sullivans moved to New York 
for a 1-year FMC work opportunity, 
they thankfully returned to Idaho, 
where Kirk went to work in Boise for 
Boise Cascade Company. In 1998, Kirk 
retired as the vice president of govern-
mental 
and 
environmental 
affairs, 
after a 28-year career with the com-
pany. 
Kirk in no way was idle in retire-
ment. In 1999, he cofounded consulting 
firm Veritas Advisors, and he served as 
chairman of the Idaho Republican 
Party from 2004–2008. In addition to his 
remarkable career, Kirk’s obituary 
reads, ‘‘Kirk shared his treasure and 
talents 
with 
countless 
non-profits, 
state-appointed boards, and political 
organizations. Dozens of those organi-
zations have honored his work for them 
and those accolades will always be 
cherished by his children and grand-
children. He humbly loved knowing he 
was contributing to others’ lives.’’ 
Kirk’s passing in early April came at 
an especially challenging time, as fam-
ilies have had to postpone memorials 
in the wake of the novel coronavirus

pandemic. I extend my deep condo-
lences and prayers to Betty, their fam-
ily, and friends. Kirk is described in his 
obituary first as a loving husband, fa-
ther, and grandfather. Additionally, 
Kirk was a pillar of Idaho industry and 
politics, thought-leader, and friend, 
who no doubt boosted and inspired 
countless budding leaders and efforts 
throughout our great State.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, 
Mr. TESTER, Ms. ERNST, Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH, Mr. ROUNDS, Ms. 
SMITH, and Mr. DAINES): 
S. 3693. A bill to amend the Agricul-
tural Marketing Act of 1946 to foster 
efficient markets and increase com-
petition and transparency among pack-
ers that purchase livestock from pro-
ducers; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Iowa 
is home to 88,000 family farmers. These 
farmers make up the economic founda-
tion of our rural communities, and 
farmers are the leaders who make up 
the councils and the school boards 
across our State. So when we see 
economists estimate a 20-percent drop 
in livestock and grain producers’ rev-
enue due to COVID–19, it isn’t just our 
farmers who are concerned; it is our 
whole State. 
In the CARES Act, we provided 
USDA with $24.5 billion to address this 
loss in revenue; however, we know that 
even with this funding, the supply 
chain disruptions from COVID–19 will 
force some agriculture producers to 
miss payments, and ultimately some 
will be forced to sell their family 
farms. 
The consequences of COVID–19 shut-
downs have injected uncertainty that 
we haven’t seen since the farmer crisis 
of the 1980s.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2381 
May 12, 2020 
During my time in the Senate, I have 
always tried to be a vocal advocate for 
the importance of a safe, affordable, 
and secure supply of food. But now our 
country’s food supply chain is facing 
disruptions never envisioned before. As 
processing plants have shut down due 
to employees being sick, the supply 
chain disruptions are being felt by 
farmers and, of course, by consumers. 
I ought to tie the two together be-
cause it is so important. The old saying 
that we are only nine meals away from 
a riot—we haven’t had that in the 
United States yet, and I hope we don’t 
have it, but when you see short sup-
plies of toilet paper and people fighting 
over toilet paper in the supermarket, it 
wouldn’t surprise you that they would 
fight more for food. 
With as much as 40 percent of the 
slaughter capacity at our packing 
plants down for the past month, beef 
prices have doubled for the consumer. 
That has caused meat shortages in fast 
food chains, and grocery stores across 
the country have been forced to limit 
meat purchases per consumer. 
If that is not bad enough, at the same 
time, livestock producers with live-
stock that is ready to sell have been 
turned away by meat processors. Even 
if producers are lucky enough to sell, 
the prices they are getting are well 
below the cost of production, and they 
are losing money on every animal they 
sell. 
I have received a large volume of 
calls and emails from Iowans and mem-
ber organizations expressing concern 
that the current discrepancy between 
high shelf prices and increased losses 
for cattle producers just doesn’t make 
any sense. I share the concerns of these 
farmers, and I take their claims of 
market manipulation very seriously. 
President Trump is on top of this 
issue, and this past week, he echoed a 
request that I made of the Attorney 
General last month to examine the cur-
rent structure of the beef meatpacking 
industry 
and 
investigate 
potential 
market and price manipulation. Hold-
ing the four large meatpacking compa-
nies accountable is the least we can 
ask of Federal officials, and I thank 
President Trump for talking to Barr 
about that as well. 
The fact is, over 80 percent of the 
feedlot cattle in the United States are 
slaughtered 
by 
the 
four 
largest 
meatpacking companies: Tyson Foods, 
JBS, Cargill, and No. 4, National Beef. 
Because these companies control a 
large percentage of slaughter and proc-
essing capacity in the United States, 
they have the unique ability to influ-
ence the price of live cattle. They use 
tactics such as bottlenecking proc-
essing speeds, importing foreign meat, 
utilizing private forward-formula con-
tracts, and piling up meat in cold stor-
age to delay the need to purchase live 
cattle from the family farmer. 
I am glad the President asked the De-
partment of Justice to look into these 
schemes to see if any of this behavior 
is illegal—the same request I made to 
Barr about a month ago. 
Independent producers will always 
struggle with negotiating prices when 
there are only four large, multi-
national 
corporations 
that 
control 
prices; however, in Iowa, it is a little 
different. Our producers sell 50 percent 
of their cattle through negotiated cash 
prices. This allows for market trans-
parency so that producers know the 
market price of cattle, and the price 
more accurately reflects the cost the 
producers incur when raising livestock. 
However, this isn’t the case across the 
entire United States, as more than 80 
percent of all cattle are sold through 
formula contracts and/or the cattle fu-
tures market. These private contracts 
don’t allow for price transparency and 
hide the true value of production from 
the rest of the marketplace. 
It happens that this is not a new 
problem. In fact, 18 years ago, I intro-
duced a bill with former Senator Fein-
gold from Wisconsin that would have 
helped producers gain leverage by man-
dating that a percentage of a packer’s 
weekly slaughter come from a nego-
tiated cash price. I introduced that bill 
every Congress until 2009, but, sadly, at 
that time, not enough of my colleagues 
saw the need for a transparent market-
place. 
That need is much more obvious 
today because conversations across the 
country have started to shift, and peo-
ple’s 
opinion 
about 
four 
big 
meatpackers controlling 80 percent of 
the market—it looks like more of a 
problem when farmers are losing a lot 
of money when they sell their cattle 
and the price for the consumer goes up 
at the supermarket. Lawmakers have 
begun to realize that in order to have a 
sustainable supply of meat in our coun-
try, we need to restore transparency in 
the marketplace and protect the mar-
ket from collapsing when there is a 
supply chain disruption. 
Let me repeat something I said at 
the beginning—nine meals away from a 
riot and people fighting about who is 
going to buy the last roll of toilet 
paper in the supermarket. We can’t let 
that same thing happen with food, so 
today I come to the floor to submit my 
bill to foster efficient markets and in-
crease competition and transparency 
among packers that purchase livestock 
from our producers. The only change to 
that Feingold-Grassley bill is to in-
crease the amount of mandated nego-
tiated cash trade to 50 percent from the 
original 25 percent in that bill that 
Feingold and I cooperated on. This 
change is needed to increase price dis-
covery for producers across the coun-
try. 
I am proud to lead this effort with 
Senator TESTER of Montana and will 
work with my colleagues in the Senate 
and particularly those on the Senate 
Agriculture Committee to make sure 
this bill becomes law. Without signifi-
cant action by Congress, our inde-
pendent beef producers will not be able 
to stay in business. I believe the time 
to act is now. Failure to act is failing 
our independent producers. 
If there is one silver lining that could 
come out of COVID–19, it may be that 
consumers will start to understand 
where their food comes from. Food does 
not come from grocery stores; it comes 
from the tens of thousands of farmers 
and independent producers who bust 
their backs day and night to ensure 
families across the country have an 
adequate supply of food. 
Farmers are 2 percent of the popu-
lation who provide for the other 98 per-
cent, and they even provide for more 
than 98 percent of Americans—a lot of 
it is exported. 
I urge my colleagues to support my 
legislation being introduced today and 
do right by the producers who provide 
the food that we all eat. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. 
MENENDEZ, and Mr. GRASSLEY): 
S. 3703. A bill to amend the Elder 
Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act 
to improve the prevention of elder 
abuse and exploitation of individuals 
with Alzheimer’s disease and related 
dementias; to the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to 
introduce 
the 
Promoting 
Alz-
heimer’s Awareness to Prevent Elder 
Abuse Act. I am pleased to be joined by 
my colleagues, Senators MENENDEZ and 
GRASSLEY, in sponsoring this legisla-
tion that seeks to help combat elder 
abuse perpetrated against those living 
with Alzheimer’s disease and related 
dementias. 
An estimated 5.8 million Americans 
aged 65 and older currently live with 
Alzheimer’s disease. This disease takes 
a tremendous personal and economic 
toll on individuals and their families, 
and the COVID–19 crisis has made 
many of the challenges they face even 
more difficult. 
People living with Alzheimer’s and 
related dementias make up a large pro-
portion of all older Americans who re-
ceive adult day services and nursing 
home care, making them among those 
most vulnerable to COVID–19. Many of 
the public health and safety measures 
put in place to control the spread of 
COVID–19, including social distancing, 
also may contribute to social isolation, 
which is one of the greatest risk fac-
tors for elder abuse. This crisis has also 
given rise to a number of COVID–19-re-
lated scams seeking to financially ex-
ploit Americans of all ages, including 
seniors. 
Individuals with Alzheimer’s are at 
greater risk for elder abuse. According 
to the National Center on Elder Abuse, 
approximately one in ten Americans 
aged 60 and older have experienced 
elder abuse. For people with Alz-
heimer’s and related dementias, the 
prevalence is much higher, with some 
estimates putting it at just over 50 per-
cent. 
This abuse can take a number of 
forms. In 2015, the Aging Committee 
heard from Philip Marshall, the grand-
son of philanthropist Brooke Astor, 
who testified that his father neglected

his mother’s health and safety and mis-
managed her assets while she suffered 
from Alzheimer’s disease. 
More recently, a constituent called 
the Aging Committee Fraud Hotline 
after she discovered a contracting scam 
targeting her aunt and uncle. These 
scammers repeatedly charged her aunt 
and uncle, who both have dementia, for 
the same driveway sealing services and 
other handyman tasks, stealing $34,000 
of their hard-earned savings. 
Identifying, investigating, and pros-
ecuting elder abuse cases often involve 
several challenges. Victims may not be 
able to report the abuse they are expe-
riencing, and prosecutors may need to 
prove the case without the victim’s 
testimony. When elder abuse victims or 
witnesses have Alzheimer’s or related 
dementia, these challenges can be ex-
acerbated. 
Specialized knowledge and training 
can help address the issues of abuse 
and fraud. The Elder Abuse Prevention 
and Prosecution Act, which became 
law in 2017, required the Department of 
Justice to develop training materials 
to help criminal justice, social serv-
ices, and health care personnel inves-
tigate elder abuse cases and assess, re-
spond to, and interact with the victims 
and witnesses in these cases. The legis-
lation I am introducing today would 
build on this law by requiring the De-
partment to ensure that these elder 
abuse training materials incorporate 
best practices for responding to elder 
abuse victims and witnesses who have 
Alzheimer’s or other related demen-
tias. 
This legislation would also require 
the Department to consult with fed-
eral, state, and local partners and 
stakeholders in developing its elder 
justice training materials and to up-
date these training materials to reflect 
new best practices. 
As Chairman of the Senate Aging 
Committee, one of my top priorities is 
protecting seniors against abuse. The 
Promoting Alzheimer’s Awareness to 
Prevent Elder Abuse Act would help to 
ensure that the frontline professionals 
who are leading the charge against 
elder abuse have the training needed to 
respond to cases where the victim or a 
witness has Alzheimer’s disease or 
other forms of dementia. I urge my col-
leagues to support this bill. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 571 
Whereas charter schools are public schools 
that do not charge tuition and enroll any 
student who wants to attend, often through 
a random lottery when the demand for en-
rollment is outmatched by the supply of 
available charter school seats; 
Whereas high-performing public charter 
schools deliver a high-quality public edu-
cation and challenge all students to reach 
their potential for academic success; 
Whereas public charter schools promote in-
novation and excellence in public education; 
Whereas public charter schools throughout 
the United States provide millions of fami-
lies with diverse and innovative educational 
options for the children of those families; 
Whereas high-performing public charter 
schools and charter management organiza-
tions are increasing student achievement 
and attendance rates at institutions of high-
er education; 
Whereas public charter schools are author-
ized by a designated entity and— 
(1) respond to the needs of communities, 
families, and students in the United States; 
and 
(2) promote the principles of quality, ac-
countability, choice, high performance, and 
innovation; 
Whereas, in exchange for flexibility and 
autonomy, public charter schools are held 
accountable by the authorizers of the char-
ter schools for improving student achieve-
ment and for sound financial and operational 
management; 
Whereas public charter schools are re-
quired to meet the student achievement ac-
countability requirements under the Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) in the same man-
ner as traditional public schools; 
Whereas public charter schools often set 
higher expectations for students, beyond the 
requirements of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 
et seq.), to ensure that the charter schools 
are of high quality and truly accountable to 
the public; 
Whereas 45 States, the District of Colum-
bia, and Puerto Rico have enacted laws au-
thorizing public charter schools; 
Whereas, as of the 2018–2019 school year, 
more than 7,400 public charter schools served 
approximately 3,200,000 children; 
Whereas enrollment in public charter 
schools grew from 400,000 students in 2001 to 
3,200,000 students in 2019, an eightfold in-
crease in 18 years; 
Whereas, in the United States— 
(1) in 214 school districts, more than 10 per-
cent of public school students are enrolled in 
public charter schools; and 
(2) in 21 school districts, more than 30 per-
cent of public school students are enrolled in 
public charter schools; 
Whereas public charter schools improve 
the achievement of students enrolled in 
those charter schools and collaborate with 
traditional public schools to improve public 
education for all students; 
Whereas public charter schools— 
(1) give parents the freedom to choose pub-
lic schools; 
(2) routinely measure parental satisfaction 
levels; and 
(3) must prove the ongoing success of the 
charter schools to parents, policymakers, 
and the communities served by the charter 
schools or risk closure; 
Whereas a 2015 report from the Center for 
Research on Education Outcomes at Stan-
ford University found— 
(1) significant improvements for students 
at urban charter schools; and 
(2) that, each year, students at urban char-
ter schools completed the equivalent of 28 
more days of learning in reading and 40 more 
days of learning in math than the peers of 
those students in traditional public schools; 
Whereas 
parental 
demand 
for 
charter 
schools is high, and there was an estimated 
7 percent growth in charter school enroll-
ment between the 2016–2017 and 2018–2019 
school years; and 
Whereas the 21st annual National Charter 
Schools Week is scheduled to be celebrated 
the week of May 10 through May 16, 2020: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) congratulates the students, families, 
teachers, leaders, and staff of public charter 
schools across the United States for— 
(A) making ongoing contributions to pub-
lic education;

President, 
Americans owe a great debt of grati-
tude to the healthcare heroes on the 
frontlines of the fight against the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Today, I would 
like to spend a few minutes talking 
about one special group of healthcare 
workers: immigrants. 
Consider this: 1 in 6 healthcare and 
social service workers—3.1 million out 
of 18.7 million—are immigrants. These 
immigrants are playing a critical role 
in the battle against the pandemic, yet 
our broken immigration system does 
not allow many of them to fulfill their 
dreams of becoming part of America’s 
future. 
I have come to the floor today to tell 
a story of one of our immigrant health 
heroes, and I will continue to highlight 
these stories in the coming weeks. I am 
also 
inviting 
my 
colleagues 
from 
across the Nation to come tell their 
own stories on social media or on the 
floor with #ImmigrantHealthHeroes, 
shown on this chart. 
Thousands 
of 
immigrant 
health 
workers are suffering because of a seri-
ous problem in our immigration sys-
tem: It is the green card backlog. This 
backlog puts them and their families 
at risk of losing their immigration sta-
tus, and it hinders their ability to par-
ticipate in the fight against COVID–19. 
Under our current laws, there are not 
nearly enough immigrant visas, also 
known as green cards, available each 
year. As a result, immigrants are 
struck in crippling backlogs not just 
for years but for decades. 
Close to 5 million future Americans 
are in line waiting for green cards. 
Hundreds of thousands of them are al-
ready working in the United States on 
temporary visas, while many more are 
waiting abroad, separated from their 
American families. Only 226,000 family 
green cards and 140,000 employment 
green cards are available each year. 
The backlogs are really hard on these 
families who are caught in this immi-
gration limbo. For example, children in 
many of these families age out and face 
deportation as their parents are wait-
ing in line for their green cards. 
The green card backlog includes 
thousands of doctors—medical doc-
tors—who are currently working in our 
country on a temporary basis. These 
doctors face many restrictions due to 
their temporary status, such as not 
being able to volunteer at hospitals in 
COVID–19 hotspots where they are so 
desperately needed. 
The solution to the green card back-
log is clear: Increase the number. In 
2013, I joined a group of four Repub-
licans and four Democrats who au-
thored a bipartisan comprehensive im-
migration reform bill. The bill passed 
the Senate with a strong vote, 68–3, and 
it would have eliminated the green 
card backlog. 
Last year, I introduced the RELIEF 
Act, legislation based on the 2013 com-
prehensive immigration reform bill 
that would clear the backlog for all im-
migrants waiting in line for green 
cards within 5 years. I will keep fight-
ing to help all immigrants who are 
stuck in this backlog. 
Last week, I joined with my col-
leagues, Republican Senators DAVID 
PERDUE of Georgia, TODD YOUNG of In-
diana, and JOHN CORNYN of Texas and 
Democratic Senators CHRIS COONS of 
Delaware and PAT LEAHY of Vermont 
to introduce legislation to quickly ad-
dress the plight of immigrant doctors 
and nurses who are stuck in this green 
card backlog. This backlog poses a sig-
nificant risk to our ability to effec-
tively respond to this pandemic. Our 
bill, the Healthcare Workforce Resil-
ience Act, is a temporary stopgap bill 
that will strengthen our healthcare 
workforce and improve healthcare ac-
cess for Americans in the midst of this 
crisis. 
Our bill would recapture 25,000 un-
used immigrant visas for nurses and 
15,000 unused visas for doctors. These 
are visas that Congress previously au-
thorized, but we never used. Our bill 
would quickly allocate these visas to 
doctors and nurses who can help us 
today in the fight against COVID–19. 
It is important to note that our bill 
requires employers to attest that any 
immigrant from overseas who receives 
these visas will not displace an Amer-
ican worker. We want to ensure that 
all beneficiaries of this bill com-
plement 
our 
American 
healthcare 
workforce. As Congress begins to work 
on the next legislation to address this 
pandemic, 
I 
will 
push 
for 
the 
Healthcare Workforce Resilience Act 
to be included. 
Today, I want to tell you the story of 
one immigrant healthcare worker who 
is stuck in this green card backlog and 
would benefit from the act I just de-
scribed. 
This is Dr. Ram Sanjeev Alur. Dr. 
Alur was born in India. As a child, he 
survived a bout with meningitis, a dis-
ease that is often fatal. This experience 
inspired him to become a doctor. He 
went to medical school in India, then 
trained in internal medicine in the 
United Kingdom. Dr. Alur came to the 
United States in 2007 for medical resi-
dency training. In 2011, he began work-
ing as an internist and hospitalist in 
the Marion Veterans Affairs Medical 
Center in Marion, IL. Dr. Alur has led 
the emergency room inpatient unit for 
the last 3 years, and now, he is on the 
frontlines of the pandemic as a member 
of his hospital’s COVID–19 response 
team. 
Dr. Alur lives in Marion with his wife 
and three kids. Their ages are 12, 8, and 
6. He sent me a letter, but listen to 
what he said about his life in southern 
Illinois living in Marion: 
I consider the opportunity to work at the 
VA medical center as a blessing. To serve the 
veterans is an honor, responsibility and sat-
isfaction that enhances anyone’s life. I found 
my calling and hope to spend the rest of my 
career and raise my family here. I would like 
to see my children blossom in this commu-
nity and grow into successful, responsible 
citizens. 
Unfortunately, Dr. Alur is one of 
thousands of doctors stuck in this 
green card backlog. He has been forced 
to renew his temporary visa four times

since he started working serving our 
veterans at the Marion VA facility. He 
has been approved for a green card but 
will have to wait decades—decades—be-
cause of the backlog of people just like 
him, waiting for their green cards. 
In the meantime, Dr. Alur’s oldest 
daughter would age out—she is 12 
now—but she would age out and be 
forced to leave the country before he is 
legally entitled to become a citizen of 
this country. Think of that heart-
breaking situation, breaking up this 
man’s family because he has been ap-
proved for a visa but has to wait to 
make sure he meets the quota in each 
year, and he will end up waiting for 
decades. 
In the midst of this pandemic, Dr. 
Alur’s immigration status puts him at 
a great risk. If, God forbid—God for-
bid—he contracts COVID–19 and be-
comes disabled or dies, his family 
would lose their immigration status 
and be forced to leave the United 
States. Tell me that is fair, that this 
man who is serving our veterans and 
has waited patiently to become a cit-
izen of United States and be part of our 
future, should he get sick or die, his 
family would be deported. 
Here is what he said to me about 
this: 
The pandemic shook our family. Being a 
temporary worker on a visa never stared us 
in the face more. This lack of protection is 
every frontline immigrant doctor’s night-
mare. 
Dr. Alur’s temporary immigration 
status also prevents him from working 
part-time in a COVID–19 hotspot like 
Chicago. Here is what he said: 
It is depressing to watch the medical sys-
tem, stretched while the pandemic takes its 
toll, and not be able to help or participate. It 
is like a soldier sitting out a battle, player 
sitting out a game, fireman sitting out a 
house fire. 
His family’s plight led Dr. Alur to 
start Physicians for American Health 
Care Access, a nonprofit organization 
to advocate for doctors serving under-
served communities who are stuck in 
this green card backlog. 
I can tell you, in southern Illinois, 
we are desperate for good doctors. We 
need them not just at Marion VA, but 
we need more specialists around the 
entire region. This is a rural area of 
our State, small-town area, and they 
need these specialists more than ever. 
How we can take a good man like 
this, who is willing to serve our vet-
erans and do more in this COVID–19 
epidemic, and tell him he is not wel-
come to be a citizen of this country, I 
just do not understand. 
When I heard Dr. Alur’s story, it in-
spired me to work with my colleagues 
on a bipartisan basis to introduce this 
law that I mentioned, the Healthcare 
Workforce Resilience Act. Under our 
bill, Dr. Alur and thousands like him 
could receive their green cards. They 
and their families would get the per-
manent immigration status that they 
deserve and be able to use their skills 
to serve in the frontlines of the pan-
demic if they are needed—and they are. 
I hope that, even in these divided 
times, we can come together in Con-
gress to quickly aid these immigrant 
healthcare heroes.

REMEMBERING GREG ZANIS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in 
this season of great mourning, last 
Monday, America lost a man who tried 
for years—during some of our darkest 
moments—to comfort our grief-strick-
en Nation. 
His name was Greg Zanis, but he was 
known as ‘‘The Cross Man.’’ One month 
ago, he was diagnosed with terminal 
cancer. Last Friday, Mr. Zanis, his wife 
Sue, and their grown children watched 
from inside the Zanis family home in 
Aurora, IL, as a parade of neighbors 
drove past to show their love and re-
spect for Greg. 
This caravan of caring stretched for a 
mile and included more than 320 cars, 
trucks, SUVs, and motorcycles. It was 
a fitting tribute to a quiet man whose 
compassion and sacrifice helped ease 
the grief of countless Americans over 
the last 25 years. 
You may never have heard his name 
before, but chances are you may have 
seen his work. After the Columbine 
High School massacre in 1999 and near-
ly every mass shooting and natural dis-
aster since then, Greg Zanis crafted 
wooden memorials to honor the fallen. 
Over nearly 20 years, he made and per-
sonally delivered some 27,000 handmade 
memorials 
to 
communities 
across 
America. Most were crosses, but he 
also crafted wooden Stars of David and 
crescent moons to honor the fallen. 
He drove to Sandy Hook, CT, after 26 
children and educators were murdered 
in that grade school. He drove to Flor-
ida to honor the victims of the Pulse 
Nightclub shooting and returned a 
heartbreaking short time later after 
the Parkland High School mass shoot-
ing. He drove to Las Vegas after 58 peo-
ple were killed at a music festival; to 
the First Baptist Church in Sutherland 
Springs, TX, after 26 worshippers were 
killed; to Pittsburgh, PA, to honor the 
11 worshippers killed at the Tree of 
Life Synagogue. 
Greg Zanis considered his work a 
ministry, and it cost him financially 
and emotionally. He was a master car-
penter who gave up much of the work 
he did otherwise to make and deliver 
these memorials. When he heard of a 
mass shooting or a deadly natural dis-
aster, he loaded up his truck with 
crosses and drove, sometimes leaving 
in the middle of the night so he could 
get there as quickly as possible. One 
friend said that Mr. Zanis often wasn’t 
sure, when he left home, how he would 
get the gas money to get back to Au-
rora. Somehow, he always did. 
He was in Aurora a little over a year 
ago, February 2019, when the epidemic 
of mass shootings came to his home-
town. Five workers were killed, five 
police officers wounded at a mass 
shooting at a warehouse. The tragedy 
hit Mr. Zanis hard. As he told a re-
porter for the New York Times, he 
could drive away from all the other 
tragedies, but he said, ‘‘I’m not going 
to be able to get away from this one.’’ 
His ministry didn’t take him only to 
places of mass suffering and death; he 
also made crosses for individuals. He 
made 700 crosses carried down Michi-
gan Avenue in Chicago to honor those 
who died in that great city in 1 year. 
He made his first cross in 1996 to 
honor his father-in-law, who had been 
murdered in a shooting. He learned 
from that experience that transforming 
wood into symbols of faith helped to 
make grief more bearable. That is the 
gift that he tried to share with others. 
The mass shooting at a Walmart in 
El Paso last September shook him 
deeply. Among the 22 killed and 23 
wounded were little children shopping 
for school supplies with their parents. 
Between the heat of the south Texas 
sun and the enormity of their losses, 
Mr. Zanis struggled to make enough 
crosses. He decided, after that, that he 
had to retire from his ministry. He was 
69 years old. A few months later, his 
cancer was diagnosed. 
In this time, when so many of the 
usual customs of grieving must be sus-
pended, may we all find some consola-
tion and inspiration in the extraor-
dinary, ordinary man who helped to 
ease the grief of so many. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL POLICE 
WEEK 2020 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in solemn recognition of the selfless sacrifice 
made by law enforcement officers across this 
great nation and to honor those who have fall-
en in the line of duty. Ever since President 
John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation desig-
nating May 15th as Peace Officer’s Memorial 
Day, we as a nation have paused to show our 
support and eternal gratitude for the brave 
men and women who have paid the ultimate 
sacrifice while serving and protecting their fel-
low citizens. 
I embrace this opportunity to pay tribute to 
our fallen law enforcement officers. These are 
true and brave public servants who made the 
conscious decision to stand in between the 
men, women, and children in their commu-
nities and those who would do them harm. 
While these courageous individuals hail from a 
broad spectrum of social and economic back-
grounds, they all share the common instinct to 
protect and serve their fellow citizens. These 
officers are husbands and wives, fathers and 
mothers, sons and daughters. They under-
stand the perils they face every day when they 
go to work in service of others, but they are 
defined by a rare sense of duty and a love for 
their fellow human beings. They keep our 
roads and highways safe. They safeguard our 
property. They secure the event sites and 
venues where we gather. They respond to in-
cidents of domestic violence and calls for help. 
They bring criminals to justice. They are the 
ones who are moving toward the sound of the 
gunfire when everyone else is running away. 
Law enforcement officers engage in thou-
sands of face-to-face encounters throughout 
their careers. They do so in most cases with-
out knowing, even in the midst of the encoun-
ter, if the individual or individuals they are con-
fronting are in need of their help or intend to 
harm them. Too often, these encounters end 
tragically. 128 officers died in the line of duty 
in 2019. Including officers identified from pre-
vious years, 307 names will be added to the 
National Law Enforcement Officer Memorial 
here in Washington, D.C. this year. Eight of 
those names are from my home state of Mary-
land. 
Officer Kyle David Olinger was a husband, 
a father, and a Police Officer in the Mont-
gomery County Police Department. On August 
8th, 2003, while serving the citizens of my 
home district, he initiated a traffic stop in Sil-
ver Spring, MD on a vehicle with three pas-
sengers. Officer Olinger observed one of the 
occupants attempting to conceal a handgun 
under the seat, and he ordered the man to 
drop the weapon. A struggle ensued, and Offi-
cer Olinger was shot in the neck and para-
lyzed below the chest. Despite his wounds, 
Officer Olinger, a former U.S. Marine, contin-
ued to serve his department until his injuries 
forced him to retire in 2007, demonstrating the 
type of man he was and his commitment to 
the service of others. On April 18th, 2019, Of-
ficer Olinger succumbed to complications from 
the gunshot wound he suffered in the line of 
duty. He is survived by his wife and two sons. 
Beyond recognizing the bravery and sac-
rifice of law enforcement professionals like Of-
ficer Olinger, we must acknowledge the sac-
rifices made by their loved ones. Every day 
our officers leave for work, their families must 
live with the anxiety of knowing that they may 
not return home. The burden of the profession 
is not just borne by officers themselves. Their 
family members endure these circumstances 
for the benefit of others—in exchange for all 
the pain and suffering that is prevented by the 
actions of these dedicated officers. So, today 
we salute not only the fallen officers, but the 
loving families that supported them in their 
very challenging profession. 
Today, I ask my colleagues to join me in 
honoring all the courageous men and women 
who have taken the oath to protect and serve, 
and who have fallen in the line of duty. We 
are forever grateful for their sacrifice, and they 
will not be forgotten.

HONORING MURINDIA WILLIAMS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious woman, Ms. Murindia Williams. 
Murindia has shown what can be done 
through hard work, dedication and a desire to 
serve others. 
Murindia was born and raised in Rolling 
Fork and began her career with Sharkey 
County in 1992 as a deputy clerk in the Chan-
cery and Circuit Clerk’s office. Ten years later 
she was chosen by the voters in the county to 
serve them as the first black Chancery and 
Circuit Clerk. 
She is also heavily involved in community 
organizations, serving as co-chair for the Deep 
Delta Blues Heritage Festival and is a long-
time member of the Ebonette Social and Civic 
Club. She is currently a member of the Circuit 
Clerks Leadership Committee, and is past 
president of that association, a member of the 
WWISCAA Advisory Board, and member of 
the Shiloh M. B. Church where she serves as 
choir president. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Ms. Murindia Williams for 
her passion and dedication to serving Sharkey 
County and desire to make a difference in the 
community. 
RECOGNIZING GREATER 
VALDOSTA UNITED WAY 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Greater Valdosta 
United Way from Georgia’s First District. 
Since 1954, Greater Valdosta United Way 
has raised over $35 million to support human 
services across their community. 
Through their hard work and dedication of 
numerous businesses, clubs, and individuals, 
the organization has made a difference in the 
lives of thousands of Georgians. 
Greater Valdosta United Way strives to ad-
vance the common good by investing in edu-
cation, income, and health, which are the pil-
lars for a strong and healthy community. 
Last year, they remarkably exceeded their 
fundraising goal of $750,000 by 105 percent. 
I am so thankful for the tremendous work 
this organization has done to improve the lives 
of countless individuals across our district for 
so many years, and for their outstanding vol-
unteers. 
I want to encourage all involved with Great-
er Valdosta United Way to keep up the won-
derful work they’ve done, and I wish them the 
best of luck in the future.

RECOGNIZING TEJ PATEL AS 
CONSTITUENT OF THE MONTH 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, it 
is my honor to recognize Tej Patel and his 
team at Fluxergy, a local company developing 
rapid COVID–19 testing, as my April Con-
stituent of the Month. During this time of un-
certainty and crisis, Americans are looking for 
beacons of hope in the fight against COVID– 
19. Tej and his team answered the call. 
Founded in 2013 by engineers Tej Patel, Ryan 
Revilla, and Jonathan Tu, Fluxergy, a medical 
diagnostic company based in Irvine, worked in 
collaboration with UC San Diego Health to 
create a testing system designed to diagnose 
COVID–19 in under an hour. 
Tej saw a deficiency in the turn-around of 
testing for COVID–19, and knew there was a 
better way to address testing in the most effi-
cient way possible. Many tests sent to outside 
labs range from days to weeks for a patient to 
receive their results. Fluxergy’s on-site test for 
COVID–19 requires a very small sample, typi-
cally a nasal swab. This swab is mixed with a 
reagent solution, loaded onto the Fluxergy 
card and inserted into the Fluxergy Analyzer 
that produces results in under an hour. 
During a rapidly spreading global pandemic, 
it is imperative to know the results of a pa-
tient’s test as soon as possible. The quicker

we have results, the sooner we can implement 
proper precautions and care. Solutions like the 
testing system that Fluxergy developed can 
help us save lives. 
I launched a Constituent of the Month pro-
gram to recognize individuals who have gone 
above and beyond to make our region and our 
country a stronger place for everyone to live 
and thrive. There are countless health care 
workers, first responders, grocery workers and 
many others who deserve recognition. Today, 
I am proud to recognize Tej and his team’s in-
novation during this time of crisis for our coun-
try, which is both inspiring and encouraging. I 
am honored to recognize Tej Patel and the 
Fluxergy team as my Constituent of the Month 
and I thank them for being beacons of light 
and hope for our community as we fight this 
global pandemic together.

HONORING IOWA’S TEACHERS AS 
IOWANS OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, in honor of 
National Teacher Appreciation Week, I am 
recognizing the incredible educators of Iowa’s 
Third Congressional District as our Iowans of 
the Week. Their daily contributions to our chil-
dren’s lives have perhaps never been more 
evident than during the past couple of months 
while our nation battles the COVID–19 pan-
demic. As distance learning has become the 
new 
norm, 
parents-turned-home-educators 
have developed a whole new appreciation for 
the academic, social, and emotional support 
teachers provide our children. 
It has been remarkable to see educators 
and school staff rise to the challenge of serv-
ing their students in the face of this unprece-
dented crisis. With little time to plan and while 
coping with the pandemic themselves, they 
transitioned lesson plans to fit the constraints 
of distance learning and have worked hard to 
find creative ways to keep students engaged. 
Within the Des Moines Public School district 
alone, teachers have now moved more than 
6,300 Pre-K through 8th grade classes to an 
online learning platform and distributed nearly 
21,000 laptop computers to students across 
grade levels. In districts across central and 
southwest Iowa, teachers have also packed 
countless bags of books, school supplies, 
games, and other supports for students and 
families. And at Thomas Jefferson High 
School in Council Bluffs, teachers are now 
hosting activities like Anime Club meetups via 
Google Hangouts. 
Their efforts extend far beyond traditional 
lesson plans. Teachers were among the first 
to recognize and fill the void of food insecurity 
for many students in their school districts; for 
weeks now, they have stepped up to pack and 
serve tens of thousands of meals weekly for 
students who might otherwise go without. 
They know many students still need a 
wellness check, so educators have donned 
masks and knocked on doors to make sure 
students are safe and secure. And at the end 
of the day, teachers still find the energy to or-
ganize parades through their school districts 
just to put a smile on their students’ faces. 
Their contributions to our community don’t 
end with their students. We even have teach-
ers who are working around the clock to 
produce face shields for health care workers 
on their school’s 3D printers. 
Teachers deserve special recognition this 
week and every week for their willingness to 
go above and beyond for the benefit of our 
students and families. In many ways, edu-
cators are the heart of Iowa’s communities. 
They are thoughtful caretakers and mentors of 
our generations to come, and it is a role they 
approach with purpose and compassion. While 
educators face various professional chal-
lenges, many see teaching as their life’s call-
ing. I am grateful for every person who has 
chosen to spend their careers sparking curi-
osity and creativity in our children. So please 
allow me to express my deep appreciation and 
thanks to every teacher in Iowa’s Third Con-
gressional District, and to honor them as 
Iowans of the Week.

RECOGNIZING JO ELLIS AND 
MAKE.DO. 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, 
today I recognize Jo Ellis and her team at the 
nonprofit organization Make.Do., an organiza-
tion that has been restoring hope through cre-
ativity, connection, and compassion in Searcy, 
Arkansas. 
The team at Make.Do. has shifted their 
focus during the current public health crisis 
due to COVID–19 and have dedicated their 
abilities to making masks for the community 
and healthcare workers, so far producing more 
than 780 masks. 
The team has also adapted their community 
outreach by starting the Quarantine Craft 
Camp. Here, they provide craft supplies to 
Searcy residents and encourage them to par-
ticipate in the educational Facebook Live 
events that they host. 
This initiative has shined a light on how cre-
ativity encourages positive attitudes and can 
unite a community even amidst a public health 
crisis. 
I congratulate Jo Ellis and the team at 
Make.Do. for their creative way to bring the 
community of Searcy together.

REMEMBERING ROBERT TORRAS 
SR. 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor the life of 
Mr. Robert Torras Sr. of St. Simons. 
Mr. Torras was a remarkable businessman, 
philanthropist, and visionary who was always 
thinking of ways to solve problems. 
Through his work running the family-owned 
operations including the Brunswick Landing 
Marina, Kut-Kwick Corporation, and Torco In-
corporated; developing the West Point Planta-
tion on Saint Simons Island; and running mul-
tiple other commercial real estate holdings in 
both the Atlanta metro area and Glynn Coun-
ty, he left an indelible mark on the state of 
Georgia. 
When Mr. Torras purchased the land now 
occupied by Brunswick Landing Marina, it re-
sulted in the development of the largest salt-
water marina in Georgia. 
After studying the waterways, marine life, 
and shipping routes, his work helped spur leg-
islative changes regarding marinas to pave the 
way for other commercial ventures which ben-
efitted many. 
I am grateful for Mr. Torras’ many years of 
hard work and for his wisdom, determination, 
and energy. 
My thoughts and prayers are with all who 
worked with him, knew him, and loved him.

THANKING 
‘‘THE 
THREE 
MASKETEERS’’ FOR THEIR HARD 
WORK 
KEEPING 
OUR 
COMMU-
NITIES SAFE 
HON. PETE OLSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. OLSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to 
recognize 
three 
young 
heroes 
from 
Pearland that are doing their part to stop the 
spread of COVID–19. 
When Amar Sehgal, Karthik Bhagavatula 
and Praneel Bhagavatula heard that hospitals 
could possibly face shortages of face masks 
and other personal protective equipment, the 
three decided to act. Although COVID–19 had 
cancelled this year’s Texas Science and Engi-
neering Fair, this trio of heroes found a way 
for their work to help protect their community. 
Known as ‘‘The Three Masketeers,’’ Amar, 
Karthik and Praneel have been using 3–D 
printing to create N95 facemasks to give to 
people at higher risk of contracting the 
coronavirus. These masks take only three 
hours to print, are cost-effective, and the 
Three Masketeers aren’t charging a dime for 
them. 
When 
we 
face 
great 
challenges 
like 
COVID–19. the people of TX–22 come to-
gether and lift each other up; Amar, Karthik 
and Praneel are living proof. 
On behalf of the Twenty-Second Congres-
sional District of Texas, I thank ‘‘The Three 
Masketeers’’ for their hard work protecting our 
community from coronavirus. They have pro-
vided critical aid to people in need during 
these unprecedented times.

RECOGNIZING LOHGAN DENNEHY 
OF BUTTE 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Lohgan Dennehy of Butte for 
her work providing handcrafted personal pro-
tective masks to health care, school district, 
and community workers as Montana combats 
the COVID–19 outbreak. 
At 10 years old, Lohgan knows what she 
wants to be when she grows up—a fashion 
designer. To encourage her dream, Lohgan’s 
parents bought her a sewing kit, and her 
mother taught her how to sew. She’s become 
a natural. 
Her parents say she has a heart of gold, 
that she’s one of the most kindhearted human 
beings you’ve ever met. She enjoys making a 
difference. It was no surprise when Lohgan 
wanted to help when she heard there was a 
shortage of masks in Butte. 
Lohgan watched YouTube videos on the 
proper way to make a mask with her sewing 
machine and materials. She admits it was dif-
ficult at first, but eventually she mastered the 
process and can make one in just 20 minutes. 
Lohgan sends her special masks to doctors 
and nurses at both St. James Healthcare in 
Butte and the Community Hospital of Ana-
conda, Butte’s public transportation drivers, 
school district employees delivering meals to 
kids, soldiers at the local military enlistment of-
fices, and anyone who has a pre-existing con-
dition. Montanans throughout our state em-
braced Lohgan in her efforts, donating money 
and supplies to keep her going. 
So far, she’s made 120 masks and has an-
other 50 requests to make more. It’s a lot of 
work for Lohgan, who’s completing her fourth 
grade assignments from home, but she’s com-
mitted to doing her part to keep people safe 
and healthy. 
Madam Speaker, for using her talents to 
help her fellow Montanans amid a public 
health crisis, I recognize Lohgan Dennehy for 
her spirit of Montana.

KERRY GLENN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Kerry Glenn, who after 30 
years in the Adams 12 School District, is retir-
ing. Kerry’s dedication to STEM education in 
the Adams 12 School District and in the City 
of Northglenn has made a significant impact 
on students which will last for years to come. 
In 1984, Kerry graduated from Northglenn 
High School and received his bachelor’s de-
gree in Applied Mathematics and Aerospace 
Engineering from the University of Colorado, 
Boulder in 1989. In 1990, he started teaching 
math at his alma mater, Northglenn High 
School. He continued to advance his own 
learning, and in 2003, he earned a MA in Cur-
riculum and Instruction from the University of 
Colorado, Denver. From 2003 to 2012, Kerry 
was the instructional leader of the math de-
partment at Northglenn High School. In addi-
tion to teaching all levels of mathematics, 
Kerry also taught Project Lead the Way 
(PLTW) Engineering classes from 2010 to 
2012. These positions reflect his talent for 
bringing people together and fostering and 
strengthening collaboration in education—all 
with a smile on his face. 
In addition to his teaching career, Kerry has 
provided countless hours and resources to his 
community by serving on local and state 
boards and commissions including District 
STEM Coordination, CTE DAG team, City of 
Northglenn Business Recognition, City of 
Northglenn Branding, Adams County Business 
Pitch Committee, Adams County Education 
Consortium, Adams County Manufacturers 
Youth Pipeline, Colorado P TECH, as well as 
Board President of Anythink Libraries. He also 
cofounded STEMinspired. In 2012 as STEM 
Coordinator, Kerry used the K–8 Adams 12 
STEM Model to design and implement the cur-
riculum in grades 9 through 12. In 2016, Kerry 
became the District P TECH/STEM Coordi-
nator. 
Through both the STEM and the P TECH 
programs in Adams 12, Kerry has created 
hundreds of industry partners that work side 
by side with students, helping to improve out-
comes for students and the surrounding com-
munity. I congratulate Kerry on a lifetime of 
service and wish him all the best in retirement.

IN RECOGNITION OF KENNETH 
LEVENO, MD 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the exemplary work and life 
of service of Kenneth Leveno, MD with Park-
land Hospital in Dallas, Texas. Dr. Leveno 
was instrumental in developing a number of 
the innovative programs that are an integral 
component of Parkland’s Women and Infant’s 
Specialty Health division for decades. 
He earned his undergraduate degree at 
Notre Dame University and his medical degree 
from Chreighton University School of Medi-
cine. Dr. Leveno joined the Parkland medical 
staff in the 1970s and passionately sought to 
provide the best obstetrical care for patients 
entrusted to Parkland’s care. His clinical stud-
ies demonstrated that access to prenatal care 
could mitigate health disparities among pa-
tients who face high levels of socio-economic 
hardship. He collaborated with medical, nurs-
ing and administrative leaders to create a 
highly organized, evidence-based system of 
care that led to excellent clinical outcomes 
and became known as the ‘‘Parkland Way.’’ 
Dr. Leveno was a pioneer in the deployment 
of advanced practice providers to expand

services to an ever-growing population of pa-
tients in need of care. In addition to the devel-
opment of a low-risk delivery unit, he initiated 
the nurse-midwives program at Parkland. In 
1987, Dr. Leveno recruited midwives across 
the U.S. and even abroad to launch Park-
land’s program, now one of the largest and 
most respected Certified Nurse-Midwives serv-
ices in the United States. His groundbreaking 
research and development of innovative ob-
stetrical care practices transformed Parkland’s 
obstetric service and created a unified system 
that 
integrated 
prenatal 
delivery 
and 
postpartum care. 
Dr. Leveno devoted more than fifty years of 
his life to the medical profession, including 
serving as the UT Southwestern Jack A. 
Pritchard Chair in Obstetrics & Gynecology 
and was recognized as the Distinguished Phy-
sician Award by Parkland Hospital in 1998. 
His positive impact and worthwhile contribu-
tions to the medical profession will be sorely 
missed by the patients he so diligently served 
and by the colleagues who held him in great 
esteem. I am deeply grateful for his friendship 
and service and pray for comfort and peace 
for his wife and family.

HONORING

BOARD 
PRESIDENT 
LORENZO 
‘‘DC’’ WINDLESS 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, it is an honor and privilege to recog-
nize the Honorable, Mr. Lorenzo Windless, 
fondly affectionately known as, ‘DC’, was born 
and reared in Darling, MS. He is a supportive 
and dependable brother to six siblings and a 
dedicated and loving son to his mother, Ms. 
Fannie Windless of Sledge, MS. Lorenzo has 
a genuine love for family, for friends, for the 
community, for our nation and to simply put it 
he has a love for people. 
We would like to share a few of Mr. Wind-
less’ accomplishments and positions that he 
has proudly and effectively held within our 
communities: Lorenzo was born with a heart 
to help others-at the age of 18 he was Asst 
Fire Chief of Sledge MS’s volunteer Fire De-
partment, and being the trailblazer that he is, 
he began as a Security Officer at Sam’s Town 
Casino in 1994, onto a Police Officer in 1998 
promoted to Police Chief in Sledge, MS by 
2000 (tactical training at Ole Miss University) 
and Mayor of Sledge MS 2001 to 2005. Dur-
ing his tenure, as the 1st African American 
male Mayor of Sledge, MS, a new and robust 
water system was installed, and the town of 
Sledge celebrated their very 1st ‘Sledge Day.’ 
With the sole purpose of engaging, under-
standing, and assisting and impacting the lives 
of other African American men, DC began a 
career as a Bail Bondsman in 2010 to current. 
Mr. Windless is a ‘Man of many gifts.’ He 
started mowing lawns, transporting, and cook-
ing for the elderly within the community or 
those less fortunate. Lorenzo became an en-
trepreneur and community-made businessman 
from 2008 to 2014: owning and operating such 
businesses as; Lorenzo Lawn Service, Big 
Dog BBQ Catering and Liberty Transportation, 
Wrecker Service and Used Cars. 
Always seeking to inspire, motivate, nurture, 
and cultivate, Lorenzo became a member of 
the School Board and has served for two 
terms and is currently serving as President of 
the Quitman County School District. He is a 
board member of the Marks Project Commu-
nity Work Force alliance, where they provide 
job training, certification and skill enhance-
ment. Mr. Windless is also the Lambert Com-
munity Housing Manager. In the midst of it all, 
he is pursuing his own educational goals as a 
student of Strayer University College, studying 
Business Administration with an expected end 
of an MBA Degree. 
All that we do is for naught if we are not 
doing it for the glory and edification of God. 
Minister Windless accepted his calling as a 
preacher in 2003, where he began as the 
Youth Minister at St Phillips Missionary Baptist 
Church in Sledge, MS. He became a pastor in 
2004 and is currently the shepherd of the Zion 
Travelers Missionary Baptist Church in Farrell, 
MS. He was also the Chaplain for Memorial 
Hospice and Palliative Care. Pastor Windless 
believes that it is the heart of a man that rules 
him and if he can touch hearts, then minds will 
be changed, and our black heritage will thrive. 
Moreover, he works tirelessly and consistently 
towards that end. 
All that God has allowed Pastor Windless to 
accomplish would not have been attainable if 
not for the sacrifices, support, and strength of 
his own family. Pastor Windless is adorned by 
his eloquent and graceful wife of over 20 
years, Lady Sharonda Windless and his beau-
tiful 
and 
respectful 
daughters: 
Gabrielle, 
Alesha and Zaria Windless. As he journeys 
through this life being the example and epit-
ome of a wise, courageous, fierce, strong and 
loving black man—he does so through the 
love and encouragement of his family and by 
the grace of God. President Windless and his 
family not only open their hearts to those in 
need, but they also open their home to those 
God has directed to them. With their nest one 
child from being empty, they have taken on 
the responsibility of providing a home, helping 
to mold and teach three other young men. His 
life is not one of the words but actions and 
deeds. 
A glimpse into the life of Mr. Windless is a 
reflection of ‘helping others.’ He is a man with 
a God-given vision, the will to press forward, 
and a zeal to change lives. No task set before 
him has gone undone; hurdles placed in his 
path, have made him stumble, but he has yet 
to fall; conflict, health issues and life itself 
have thrown darts of hatred, bigotry and dis-
may towards him but he does not bow down 
nor will he back down. President Windless is 
a man of fortitude, laughter, wisdom and truth, 
wise enough to be patient and humble enough 
to listen. 
It has been an honor to recognize and 
present an outstanding and remarkable Man 
of God businessman, and community leader.

TRIBUTE TO BRETT R. BARBRE 
HON. KEN CALVERT 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to pay tribute to and congratulate Director 
Brett R. Barbre on his retirement from the Mu-
nicipal Water District of Orange County’s 
(MWDOC) Board of Directors after nearly 20 
years of valued service. 
Director Barbre has been a valued member 
of MWDOC since he was elected to the Board 
in November 2000. He serves as the Director 
of Division I which includes the cities of Brea, 
Buena Park, La Habra, La Palma, Placentia, 
and Yorba Linda. In this role, Director Barbre 
has dedicated his career to ensuring there is 
an adequate water supply for Orange County 
residents and businesses. He has helped 
MWDOC secure millions of dollars in local, 
state, and federal funds to build projects to in-
crease water reliability for his region. He was 
a driving force behind the construction of a de-
salination plant in Dana Point, and he has 
played an active role in finding other viable 
desalination sites in Huntington Beach and 
throughout our southern counties. 
In 2009, Director Barbre was appointed to 
the Metropolitan Water District of Southern 
California’s (MWD) Board of Directors. MWD 
delivers water to approximately 20 million resi-
dents and serves the largest population of any 
water district worldwide. He took on his role at 
MWD with enthusiasm and was recognized 
both in California and Washington, D.C., as a 
tireless advocate for our region. His vision to 
modernize our water supply systems has ben-
efitted all of Southern California. 
Director Barbre is an Orange County native, 
having left only to attend George Fox Univer-
sity in Newberg, Oregon. After graduation he 
moved back to Orange County and has been 
a Yorba Linda resident since 1969. He and his 
wife, Jean, have two daughters, Kimberly and 
Kathryn, two grandsons and one grand-
daughter. 
The entire Southern California region thanks 
Brett for his many years of service, and I wish 
him all the best in his next chapter.

MENTS OF TED ROWSE ON THE 
OCCASION OF HIS 100TH BIRTH-
DAY 
HON. JAMIE RASKIN 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Ted Rowse, a wonderful con-
stituent who just celebrated his 100th birthday. 
Mr. Rowse has honorably served our country 
in battle and as a public-spirited journalist, and 
he has been a popular member of the Chevy 
Chase community for over 45 years. This past 
Saturday, I was touched to join his loving 
friends and family who organized a drive-by 
parade of cars to celebrate Ted’s 100th birth-
day in a safe and festive way. 
Ted left college in 1942 to enlist in the 
Army. During WWII, he served in North Africa 
and Italy and was awarded 4 battle stars for 
his courageous service. Following the war, 
Ted returned to education and received his 
MBA from Harvard Business School. 
Ted led a fascinating career as a journalist, 
beginning at the Boston Globe before eventu-
ally moving to Washington to work as an as-
sistant city editor of the Washington Post in 
1960. He went on to serve in the Johnson 
White House on programs to help consumers. 
His distinguished career culminated in his gen-
erous creation of the Arthur Rowse Award for 
Press Criticism.

COMMEMORATING THE 70TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
OF 
THE 
NATIONAL 
SCIENCE FOUNDATION 
HON. JAMES R. LANGEVIN 
OF RHODE ISLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the 70th anniversary of the 
National Science Foundation (NSF). 
As the world responds to the novel 
coronavirus pandemic, it is more important 
than ever to invest in science and the next 
generation of scientists who will lead us 
through future global challenges. 
My state is proud to be home to one of the 
eight NSF-funded Mathematical Sciences In-
stitutes—the Institute for Computational and 
Experimental 
Research 
in 
Mathematics 
(ICERM). 
In early 2019, scientists gathered at the In-
stitute to study mathematical models related to 
treatment and prevention of infectious disease, 
research that has become glaringly necessary 
in light of the COVlD–19 pandemic. 
Investments like this are vital to prepare us 
for future challenges to Americans’ health and

RECOGNIZING GERRI BACKES OF 
KALISPELL 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Gerri Backes of Kalispell for 
supporting and caring for seniors in her com-
munity as we face this unprecedented time. 
Gerri is the president of the Kalispell Senior 
Center. Since taking over last summer, she 
has made increasing social events a priority, 
with a goal of creating programs that seniors 
will look forward to. Gerri says this new ap-
proach has paid dividends and now their 
group is closer than ever. Last year, she set 
up a ‘‘90-plus’’ party for 17 members of the 
senior center, and dozens showed up to cele-
brate their long, fulfilling lives. She says par-
ties like these promote community and build 
critical relationships that ultimately improve the 
life of her members. 
She also oversees the center’s ‘‘Warm It 
Up’’ program. Through this major project, sen-
iors knit hats, scarfs, and quilts to donate to 
organizations and schools throughout Kali-
spell. In 2019 alone, they donated 3,000 
items. Under her leadership, the center also 
offers exercise classes along with educational 
presentations on health care and fraud. They 
play Pinochle on Tuesdays and Fridays and 
have a very popular weekly Bingo night. But 
all of that has come to a screeching halt. 
Officials closed the center in response to 
the COVID–19 outbreak. As a result, seniors 
are confined to their homes, isolated and with 
little to no social interaction. Luckily for this 
Kalispell group, they have Gerri. 
For Gerri, one of the best things in life is 
laughter. She says it keeps the soul happy 
and hopeful. While the center’s doors are 
closed, Gerri has been making phone calls to 
check up on her friends, and she refuses to 
hang up until she gets a laugh. And that’s not 
all she does. 
During these long days at home, it’s easy to 
get lonely and restless, so Gerri delivers puz-
zles and books to her friends. She says this 
group of Kalispell Valley seniors is her family, 
and she’ll continue to help them whether the 
center is open or closed. 
Madam Speaker, for delivering laughs and 
hope to Montana seniors, I recognize Gerri 
Backes of Kalispell for her spirit of Montana.

REMEMBERING JAMES WAYNE 
SMITH 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in remembrance of James Wayne 
Smith of Jesup, Georgia, who passed away at 
92 years old on April 22nd. 
Known to some as ‘‘Hatchet,’’ and others as 
‘‘The Mayor of Doctortown,’’ which had no 
mayor, he had a talent for making friends and 
was loved by many. 
Wayne was a faithful member of Epworth 
United Methodist Church, and quite literally 
played a role in its foundation, as he graded 
the lot where the church now stands. 
Although his dedicated work in highway 
construction for over 60 years sometimes took 
him away from home, he always returned to 
his beloved Jesup. 
In his free time, he loved to fish and hike on 
the Altamaha River, but most of all, he loved 
spending time with his family and friends. 
A renounced raconteur and spinner of 
yarns, Wayne’s good humor never failed to 
bring a smile. 
I am thankful for the immense impact he 
had on his community, and I know his legacy 
will remain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with all who 
knew and loved Wayne during this most dif-
ficult time.

HONORING DEBORAH WRIGHT 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor a tenacious and 
ambitious woman, Deborah Wright, who has 
shown what can be done through hard work, 
dedication and a desire to serve others. 
Deborah was born to the late Mr. Lee Grant 
Bridges and Mrs. Lutishia Bridges on Novem-
ber 6, 1961 in Rosedale, MS. She attended 
Marshall Elementary, Brinkley Jr. High and 
Hinds A.H.S. then crossed over to Hinds Jr. 
College in Utica, MS. 
Deborah Wright married in 1981 and two 
loving children, Laquita Shonta Sampson and 
Lawrence Douglas Sampson Jr., were born. 
In 1995, Mrs. Wright received her Real Es-
tate Degree from the Mississippi Realtors In-
stitute in Jackson MS. With an unwavering 
passion to improve her community, create bal-
anced mental health care regimes, and to en-
courage others to excel past adversity, Debo-
rah became the epitome of women in busi-
ness leadership. She has established herself 
as a trailblazer in the business industry for 
over 30 years with entrepreneurial experience 
in the state of Mississippi. After college in 
1981 Deborah Wright was employed by Mil-
waukee Electric Tools as a repair person. In 
1992, she incorporated her first business, 
Teen’s World Activity and Community Center, 
which is a non-profit organization. In 1992, 
Deborah worked as the Public Relations Offi-
cer for Operation Shoestring, Inc. and later 
Deborah partnered with her mother, Lutishia 
Bridges and opened ‘‘Linda’s Florist and Gift 
Shop’’ in Jackson in 1996 and she also 
worked in transportation for Jackson Public 
School District. 
Mrs. Wright rose against adversity by be-
coming the first African American woman in 
the world and sole proprietor of Mississippi 
Truck Driving Training, Inc., located in Jack-
son, Mississippi. After closing the truck driving 
school Deborah started Sincere Trucking. She 
wittingly coined its name from her late grand-
son, Master Sincere Rachele Christian. 
This Bolivar County native has always ex-
hibited visionary strength, while achieving a 
ripple effect of empowerment for future en-
deavors within the Health Care Industries. She 
later started Sincere Home Care, LLC in June 
2013, certified and licensed with MS Depart-
ment of Mental Health and MS Health Depart-
ment to provide a complement of services to 
the community. She patterned her mission 
statement after her non-profit organization: 
Helping Other People Excel (H. O. P. E.). She 
developed her companies to offer a solution 
for the need of a permanent mediator between 
mental health and health care. 
Deborah is not a stranger to blazing paths; 
she is motivated by the belief to insure a 
healthy standard of care for every client. She 
has vowed to ensure that Sincere Home Care 
LLC would become a pillar of major change 
for the impoverished and unhealthy in every 
county in Mississippi. Her goal is to provide 
first-rate employment opportunities as well as 
outstanding health care services for all social 
classes. Some of her services include: As-
sisted Living; Supervised Living; Sincere 
Home Care, LLC: a Mental Health Head-
quarter which includes: Community Mental 
Health & Substance Abuse and Recovery, 
Supported Living, Community Respite, Peer 
Support, Disabled & Developmental Disabled 
Community Support, Home Nursing Respite, 
Private Duty Nursing and Physical, Occupa-
tional and Speech Therapy; three Adult Day 
Service Centers: in Jackson, Louisville and 
Morton, MS. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Mrs. Deborah Wright for her 
passion and dedication to serving many peo-
ple and having the desire to make a difference 
in the communities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

May 12, 2020 
RECOGNIZING FLORIDA LAW 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
I am honored to recognize the fallen officers 
from the state of Florida who diligently gave 
their lives to protect their communities. This 
week marks the annual observance of Na-
tional Police Week. Though we set aside one 
week a year to honor law enforcement across 
the country, I encourage all Americans to join 
me in recognizing the dedication, courage, 
and selfless sacrifice of our nation’s officers 
every day. 
The men and women being honored this 
week gave the last full measure of devotion to 
their country in the form of the ultimate offer-
ing—their lives. Every community is indebted 
to those individuals in uniform who voluntarily 
put themselves in danger for our safety and 
security. 
Over three hundred officers’ names from 
across the nation will be added to the National 
Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Wash-
ington, D.C., this year for sacrificing their lives 
in the line of duty. I want to extend my sincere 
appreciation to the 13 officers from Florida 
who bravely and selflessly served to protect 
the state. It is an honor to recognize them 
along with all men and women in law enforce-
ment. 
WORLD PRESS FREEDOM DAY IN 
THE OSCE REGION 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, May 12, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to emphasize the urgency of global 
press freedom, particularly across the 57-na-
tion region of the Organization for Security 
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Earlier 
last week, we celebrated World Press Free-
dom Day, a day originally proclaimed by the 
United Nations General Assembly in Decem-
ber 1993 to celebrate the fundamental prin-
ciple of a free and independent press. On this 
day and beyond, we honor journalists and 
media professionals for their tireless service in 
reporting the truth, sometimes at the risk of 
their own personal safety. World Press Free-
dom Day serves as an important reminder to 
governments around the world to respect their 
country’s commitment to press freedom. 
The U.S. Helsinki Commission, of which I 
am Chairman, is charged with monitoring com-
pliance with human rights and security com-
mitments in the OSCE region. Freedom of the 
press is a foundational commitment to human 
rights and democracy. Unfortunately, however, 
some leaders view the media as a threat and 
seek to silence individuals and outlets through 
financial, legal, and physical means. What 
these leaders truly fear is that journalists will 
expose corruption, human rights violations, 
abuses of power, and other undemocratic be-
havior. 
According to the latest reports from the 
Committee to Protect Journalists, 250 journal-
ists are imprisoned worldwide for their work, 
64 journalists are missing, and 1,369 journal-
ists have been killed since 1992. Additionally, 
Reporters Without Borders’ 2020 World Press 
Freedom Index found that global press free-
dom has deteriorated by 12 percent since 
2013. 
Madam Speaker, I also rise to applaud the 
undaunted service of the OSCE Representa-
tive on Freedom of the Media, Harlem De´ sir. 
His leadership as an independent monitor for 
these 
issues 
among 
OSCE 
participating 
States has offered candid review of our collec-
tive challenges, while demonstrating the im-
portance of OSCE institutions. Mr. De´ sir’s 
team has provided impeccable service to help 
nations implement their international commit-
ments to this end through country visits and 
legislative review, as well as hosting expert 
conferences. I encourage my colleagues to 
closely follow his work and to learn more 
about his mandate by reviewing the pro-
ceedings of the U.S. Helsinki Commission 
hearing I chaired with Mr. De´ sir on July 25, 
2019, addressing ‘‘State of Media Freedom in 
the OSCE Region.’’ 
Madam Speaker, amid this global pandemic, 
it is more important than ever that journalists 
and media professionals are able to work free-
ly and without retribution. Unfortunately, too 
many journalists remain in jail throughout the 
OSCE region, while states like Russia, Azer-
baijan, and Hungary criminalize providing es-
sential information and transparency about the 
COVID–19 pandemic. Independent media con-
tinues to be assaulted under the pretense of 
punishing allegedly false, misleading, or unoffi-
cial information. This is unacceptable. 
Earlier in April, I released statements ex-
pressing concern with the latest attacks on 
press freedom in Russia and the unchecked 
power granted to Hungarian Prime Minister 
Viktor Orba´n amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
During these trying times, strong journalism 
and access to accurate, unbiased information 
are essential tools for countering the spread of 
the disease. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
urging states to recognize the indispensable 
role of the media during this time and to re-
verse policies that in any way discourage free-
dom of expression.
