S7097 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, NOVEMBER 30, 2020 
No. 201 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, who in Your wisdom 
has so ordered our earthly lives that 
we must walk by faith and not by 
sight, increase our trust in Your sov-
ereign care. Remind our lawmakers 
that no problem is too difficult for You 
to solve. Lord, give our Senators a 
faith that triumphs over despair, love 
that triumphs over hate, and courage 
that triumphs over faintheartedness. 
Empower them to be bold participants, 
rather than timid spectators in meet-
ing the daunting challenges of these 
times. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL THANKSGIVING 
TURKEY PARDONING CEREMONY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, like 
many Iowans, for the first time in my 
life, I wasn’t able to share a meal with 
my family this Thanksgiving. That 
doesn’t keep me from being thankful 
for the essential workers of our coun-
try 
who 
have 
also 
missed 
many 
Thanksgiving meals. Still, these essen-
tial workers provide and continue to 
provide for and keep our country safe. 
An essential job that often gets over-
looked is that of the 86,000 Iowa farm 
families who produce the food that we 
consume on Thanksgiving and the 364 
days out of the rest of the year. That is 
why I am proud to see Ron and Susie 
Kardel from Walcott, IA, get well-de-
served recognition this past week. You 
see, Ron and Susie, along with their 
two turkeys, Corn and Cob, partici-
pated in a time-honored White House 
tradition. That tradition is the Na-
tional Thanksgiving Turkey Pardoning 
Ceremony at the White House. This 
ceremony helps connect the dots for 
many Americans, showing them that 
the food they put on the Thanksgiving 
table isn’t grown in a grocery store. 
So I want to thank Ron, Susie, and 
President Trump for highlighting Iowa 
agriculture this Thanksgiving. In a 
year that has been so very difficult for 
most Americans, it is nice to see tradi-
tions like this carried on. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
SENATOR CHUCK GRASSLEY 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
first, as the Senate reconvenes this 
afternoon, I am especially happy to 
welcome back our President pro tem-
pore. Senator GRASSLEY
quarantined 
and worked from home following his 
positive COVID test 2 weeks ago. We 
all predicted that if any Member of this 
body had the stamina and spirit to 
kick the virus to the curb, it would 
certainly be him, and, sure enough, our 
colleague reports that he experienced 
no symptoms. His doctors have cleared 
him to come back to work, and we are 
sure glad to have him back. 
Chairman GRASSLEY had to put his 
epic streak of consecutive votes tempo-
rarily on hold for the sake of other peo-
ple. Of course, leadership and example- 
setting are nothing new for the senior 
Senator from Iowa. I am confident our 
colleague will pick up exactly where he 
left off, resuming both his perfect at-
tendance record and the tireless work 
for Iowans that it represents. We all 
benefit so very much from his leader-
ship. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
Senate is back in session to finish up 
2020. The American people are counting 
on us to finish strong. We need to reach 
agreement 
on 
Federal 
Government 
funding to avoid a lapse in basic pro-
grams and services. 
We need to finish the annual Defense 
authorization to shore up the U.S. 
military’s competitive advantage over 
our adversaries, and we need to con-
tinue processing well-qualified nomi-
nees for vacancies throughout the gov-
ernment, 
especially—especially—on 
the Federal bench. 
These are important assignments, 
but they aren’t the only things that 
Congress should get done before the 
end of the year. There is no reason— 
none—why we should not deliver an-
other major pandemic relief package to 
help the American people through what 
seem poised to be the last chapters of 
this battle. 
This morning, we got yet another 
major sign of hope. More data appeared 
to confirm that the vaccine developed

by Moderna is more than 94 percent ef-
fective. They are going ahead and ask-
ing the FDA for emergency use author-
ization. Experts are calling this news 
‘‘absolutely 
remarkable.’’ 
Alongside 
other promising vaccine developments 
from Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & 
Johnson, and others, there is continued 
cause to suspect that victory over this 
pandemic is not far off. 
But a huge amount of work remains 
before us. If Operation Warp Speed re-
mains on this historic trajectory, we 
need to continue investing in the sys-
tem that will distribute these vaccines 
around our country. If we want the 
small businesses that have already 
hung on for most of the year to survive 
a few more months, we need a second 
round of the job-saving Paycheck Pro-
tection Program for the workers at the 
hardest 
hit 
establishments. 
Some 
major parts of the historic CARES Act 
have already run dry, and many others 
are set to expire at year’s end. 
We Republicans have spent months 
trying to renew important help and 
provide even more. We have tried to 
send more than $100 billion to help 
schools and welcome students and 
teachers safely to the classroom. We 
have tried to implement commonsense 
legal protections that universities and 
charities have been clamoring for. We 
have tried to pass all of this over and 
over again, but Speaker PELOSI and the 
Senate Democratic leader have blocked 
it. 
They have been very transparent 
about all of this with their political 
strategy—laid it right out there. The 
Speaker of the House spent the entire 
summer and the entire autumn lit-
erally gambling with the health and 
welfare of the American people. She 
gambled that if American families 
didn’t get any more relief before the 
election, her party would expand its 
majority in the House, and Democrats 
could continue demanding the right to 
remake all of society along far-left 
lines in exchange for passing any more 
COVID relief whatsoever. 
But their all-or-nothing obstruction 
backfired. Democrats did not pick up 
seats in the House but instead appear 
to have lost seats. They have not 
gained any leverage, but instead they 
have lost leverage. And in the mean-
time, with the coronavirus surging 
from coast to coast, the American peo-
ple have gone entirely—entirely—with-
out any additional aid—even the least 
controversial, 
most 
bipartisan 
pro-
grams—because the Democrats say no. 
Here is a summary from one news 
outlet: 
Pelosi seems to have overplayed her hand 
as she held out for $2 trillion-plus right up 
until the election. The results of the elec-
tion, which saw Democrats lose seats in the 
House, appear to have significantly undercut 
her position. 
By now it is abundantly clear to ev-
eryone that the Speaker will not be 
getting to fundamentally transform 
American society in a socialist direc-
tion in exchange for more bipartisan 
relief. The hostage-taking was never 
going to work. 
Now there is only one remaining 
question for the Speaker and the 
Democratic leader—just one question: 
Will they finally—finally—let Congress 
pass hundreds of billions of dollars of 
relief on all the subjects where we 
agree? Or will they continue to insist 
that either they get their entire ideo-
logical wish list or the American peo-
ple get nothing at all? 
Even their fellow Democrats are in-
creasingly seeing this as not a terribly 
difficult question to answer. For exam-
ple, 
over 
the 
weekend, 
Professor 
Austan Goolsbee, who chaired the 
Council of Economic Advisers under 
President Obama, called on Democrats 
to finally play ball. Here is what he 
said: 
There are a lot of people really hurting. 
. . . I hope [Congress] can agree on some-
thing soon. . . . [I]f they have to accept half 
a loaf, then they have to accept half a loaf. 
Speaker PELOSI’s No. 2, the House 
Democratic majority leader, feels the 
same way: 
I just hope that we can get agreement. It 
may not be everything that everybody 
wants, but at least. . . . some significant re-
lief to people. 
Our distinguished Senate colleague 
from Illinois, the Democratic whip, 
said the same thing: ‘‘[G]et something 
done that is significant, do what we 
can achieve now.’’ 
Here is the headline from Newsweek: 
‘‘Democrats Urge Pelosi to Accept 
Smaller Stimulus Package to Ensure 
Relief by End of Year.’’ 
Even the Speaker’s own House Demo-
cratic Members are now openly cam-
paigning for our Republican approach. 
Here is one Democratic Congressman, 
who nearly lost his reelection after 
Speaker PELOSI’s stonewalling: 
We absolutely have to get something done. 
. . . Mitch McConnell is talking about a bill 
we can pass. . . . We should negotiate that to 
the finish. 
That is a House Democrat saying 
that the Senate Republican proposal is 
the template that can pass. 
Rank-and-file 
Democrats 
in 
both 
Chambers are telling Speaker PELOSI 
and the Democratic leader to stop 
stonewalling and move forward with 
the approach Republicans have been 
urging for months. The American peo-
ple need more help, and they need it 
right now—right now. Democratic lead-
ers have already burned through 3 
months—3 months—and they didn’t 
even get the political results that their 
cynical strategy was supposed to de-
liver. 
So let’s hope our colleagues at the 
top of the Democratic Party can fi-
nally hear their own Members and stop 
blocking the commonsense, multihun-
dred-billion-dollar measures that Re-
publicans have been ready to deliver 
for months.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
hope all of my colleagues had a good 
and fine Thanksgiving. We all know 
that across the country we celebrated a 
Thanksgiving—all of us, every Amer-
ican—unlike any in recent memory. 
Too many loved ones spent this holiday 
alone, unable to join with loved ones 
out of concern for their safety. As pain-
ful as it is to refrain from seeing fam-
ily and friends, these are tough choices 
that we sometimes have to make, and 
we need to maintain our resolve more 
than ever. 
While the hope of a vaccine shimmers 
on the near horizon, we are living 
through the worst stretch of the pan-
demic right now. Last Friday, for the 
first time, over 200,000 new cases of 
COVID were reported in a single day. 
The United States is averaging over 1 
million new cases a week. Some 20 per-
cent of all patients now hospitalized in 
the United States have COVID–19. 
The worst and most unalterable part 
of this pandemic, of course, are the 
deaths. Since November 10, America 
has been losing more than 1,000 pre-
cious lives a day. On one day, Novem-
ber 24, we lost more than 2,000. The na-
tional death toll stands at a very sad 
270,000 American souls. Families all 
across the country are experiencing the 
unthinkable, unbearable losses of their 
loved ones. 
As a compassionate nation, we can-
not and must not ignore or become in-
ured to this terrible reality. We must 
not avert our gaze. We must acknowl-
edge the lives we are losing. We must 
honor the grief of the children, parents, 
spouses, siblings, and friends of the in-
creasing number of Americans who are 
dying from COVID–19 every single day. 
We must redouble our efforts to flatten 
the curve and protect each other by 
wearing 
masks, 
practicing 
social 
distancing, and complying with the 
guidance of health officials. 
As this Chamber gavels back into 
session, we must redouble our efforts 
before the end of the calendar year. As 
the pandemic increases in severity, so 
does the economic pain felt by count-
less working families and small busi-
ness owners. In a few short weeks, sev-
eral provisions of the CARES Act—in-
cluding student loan forbearance, evic-
tion moratoriums, and jobless benefits 
for millions of workers—will expire. 
So first and foremost on the Senate’s 
to-do list is COVID relief. Both sides 
should come together and negotiate a 
COVID relief bill in a bipartisan way 
that meets the needs of our businesses, 
our schools, our healthcare systems, 
our workers, and our families. 
At the start of this crisis, Democrats 
and Republicans came together in a 
flurry of negotiations—I was thickly 
involved with them with Secretary 
Mnuchin—to pass a bill that truly met 
the moment. Now we are about to 
reach a new, more difficult stage of the 
crisis. We need to renew that spirit, 
that urgency, that bipartisanship. 
Leader MCCONNELL’s view, stated 
just a few minutes ago, seems to be 
that the only things that should be in 
this bill are things Republicans ap-
prove of, even if the needs of the coun-
try—the desperate needs of the coun-
try—are beyond the small list that Re-
publicans might support. That is not 
real compromise. 
We need to come together. Both sides 
must give. We have a Democratic 
House, and in the Senate there is a 
need for Democratic votes to pass any 
bill, so we need a true bipartisan bill— 
not ‘‘this is our bill; take it or leave 
it’’—that can bring us together and 
solve the desperate needs of the Amer-
ican people, which we all very much 
want to solve. 
Mr. President, the second item on 
our to-do list is Federal appropriations, 
which expire in 2 weeks. As we speak, 
appropriators from both sides in the 
relevant committees continue their ne-
gotiations. It is my hope and expecta-
tion that we can come to an agreement 
very soon. 
Mr. President, third and finally, Con-
gress should pass the annual Defense 
bill. As our country prepares for a 
peaceful transfer of power, the con-
tinuity of our national security is 
paramount. For nearly 60 years, Con-
gress has never failed to pass the an-
nual Defense bill, but this year it 
seems the normally uncontroversial 
legislation has hit a snag. President 
Trump has threatened to veto the bill 
over a provision that would rename 
military bases and installations named 
after 
Confederate 
military 
leaders, 
men who would rend this country in 
half to preserve the institution of slav-
ery, men who literally fought against 
this Nation’s military in pursuit of an 
ignoble cause. 
For that—a provision to rename our 
military bases to honor actual heroes 
rather than traitors to our country— 
President Trump is threatening to veto 
a pay raise for our troops. And it seems 
that Republicans in Congress are slow- 
walking the bill in hopes of finding 
some way to appease the outgoing 
President rather than just passing the 
bill over his rather ridiculous objec-
tion. 
The provision to rename these instal-
lations was included in both the House- 
and Senate-passed versions of the bill, 
and the larger bill passed both Cham-
bers with broad bipartisan support. 
There is no reason to further delay a 
pay raise for our living military heroes 
because President Trump wants to 
honor dead Confederate traitors. 
The other provision that is at risk, 
shockingly, from our Republican col-
leagues is an amendment to assist vet-
erans who have long suffered from 
their exposure to Agent Orange in the 
Vietnam war. The amendment passed 
this Chamber with 94 votes in favor, a 
rare and near-unanimous demonstra-
tion of bipartisan support. 
The Trump administration’s own VA 
advisory panel recommended this pol-
icy to improve healthcare for these 
veterans, but for some reason, our Re-
publican counterparts are now report-
edly trying to strip it from any final 
agreement. It would be an affront to a 
group of ailing veterans, who have suf-
fered enough already, to strip a provi-
sion that would help provide them ade-
quate healthcare. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
NOMINEES 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on President-Elect Biden’s nominees, 
as President-Elect Biden prepares to 
assume office on January 20, he is be-
ginning to announce a slate of quali-
fied, experienced public servants whom 
he intends to nominate to his Cabinet 
or other key administrative positions. 
This morning, the President-elect an-
nounced that he has assembled his core 
economic team, led by another Brook-
lyn native, Janet Yellen, who would be 
the first woman to ever hold the title 
of Treasury Secretary. The President- 
elect’s economic team clearly has the 
experience, the knowledge, and the 
prowess to meet the seriousness of this 
moment. More than that, they under-
stand the needs of all Americans be-
cause they represent all different kinds 
of Americans. 
They will get to work not just on re-
building our economy but striving to

November 30, 2020 
provide greater and more equitable 
prosperity to future generations. 
Alongside the President-elect’s deep-
ly experienced national security team 
and his soon-to-be-announced health 
team, his economic team will ensure 
that the incoming Biden-Harris admin-
istration will hit the ground running. 
Everyone knows that the Senate 
plays a pivotal role in confirming a 
new President’s Cabinet. In the midst 
of this once-in-a-century crisis, it is 
imperative that the next administra-
tion can count on the Senate to con-
firm its Cabinet without delay, so hear-
ings on President-Elect Biden’s nomi-
nees should begin in January, imme-
diately after the Georgia runoff elec-
tions. 
Let me say that again. The Senate 
should begin hearings on President- 
Elect Biden’s nominees in January, im-
mediately after the Georgia Senate 
elections, so that key Cabinet officials 
can be confirmed on January 20 and 
soon thereafter, which is traditional 
for a new President. Senate commit-
tees 
held 
hearings 
for 
President 
Obama’s 
nominees 
and 
President 
Trump’s in early January, before the 
inauguration. Majority and minority 
staff should begin preparation for those 
hearings 
as 
President-Elect 
Biden 
names his Cabinet. 
Now, President-Elect Biden’s slate of 
intended nominees provides a stark 
contrast to the caliber of nominees ad-
vanced by the current Trump adminis-
tration over the past 4 years. The early 
days of the Trump Presidency were de-
fined by high-level appointments of in-
dividuals who were manifestly unquali-
fied, plagued by ethical complaints, or 
swimming in conflicts of interest— 
sometimes all three. 
At the time, Republicans in the Sen-
ate lined up to confirm President 
Trump’s appointments, arguing that a 
President deserves his Cabinet and 
broad deference on his nominees. I 
would hope the same deference would 
be extended to President-Elect Biden’s 
nominees, especially considering the 
obvious gulf in quality, experience, and 
ethics. 
Already, however, the Republicans 
are twisting themselves into pretzels 
to explain their reflexive opposition to 
these outstanding selections. Neera 
Tanden, who would be the first woman 
of color to ever run the OMB, the Office 
of Management and Budget, is so emi-
nently qualified that some on the Re-
publican side—grasping at straws— 
have taken issue with comments made 
on Twitter criticizing the policy posi-
tions of Republicans in Congress. 
Honestly, the hypocrisy is astound-
ing. If Republicans are concerned about 
criticism on Twitter, their complaints 
are better directed at President Trump, 
who has made a hobby out of deni-
grating Republican Senators on Twit-
ter. 
I fully expect to see some crocodile 
tears spilled on the other side of the 
aisle over the President-elect’s Cabinet 
nominees, but it will be very tough to 
take those crocodile tears seriously. 
Our Republican colleagues are on the 
record supporting some of the least 
qualified, most unethical, and down-
right sycophantic Federal nominees in 
recent memory. 
Many defended the conduct of pre-
vious OMB Director Russell Vought, 
who allowed foreign aid to be held up 
for political reasons, resulting in the 
President’s impeachment. Right now, 
Republicans in Congress are looking 
the other way while President Trump 
pardons a man who pled guilty to the 
FBI. 
So, again, it will be impossible to 
take these overblown complaints over 
President-Elect Biden’s nominees very 
seriously. Given the urgent need to ad-
dress COVID–19 and its economic fall-
out, the Senate should follow precedent 
and promptly hold hearings on Presi-
dent-Elect Biden’s nominees in Janu-
ary, immediately after the Georgia 
elections, before inauguration. 
The American people cannot afford 
to wait to have its government work-
ing at full force to keep them safe, de-
feat the virus, and get our economy 
back on track. 
I yield the floor.

AGENT ORANGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, before 
I yielded the floor, I talked about 
Agent Orange, maybe before he had 
come on the floor, and it would be out-
rageous—the Senator from Montana 
has done great work helping our vet-
erans who were exposed to Agent Or-
ange get the healthcare they need and 
deserve, and I hope that our Repub-
lican colleagues will relent and allow 
those provisions to stay in the NDAA 
bill, and I compliment him on the work 
he has done. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Montana.

NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I thank 
the minority leader. I would just say 
that the presumptive conditions that 
the fighting men and women were ex-
posed to in Vietnam are real, and the 
fact of the matter is these folks are 
getting old enough now that these con-
ditions are putting them in a world of 
hurt healthwise. It is the right thing to 
do to support our Vietnam veterans 
when it comes to the presumptive con-
ditions that were caused by Agent Or-
ange, and it needs to be in the NDAA. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO TRECIA MCEVOY 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, as we 
come here this week, back to Wash-
ington, DC, to deal with next year’s 
funding 
package 
and 
hopefully 
a 
COVID package, I want to step back for 
a second and talk about really what is 
the most important thing in this body, 
and that is relationships. 
Now, as a U.S. Senator, we have rela-
tionships with the people who elect us 
and for whom we work. Some of those 
relationships are outstanding; some 
may be not so outstanding. We also 
have relationships with the people who 
work for us, and, once again, some of 
those relationships are outstanding; 
some of them could use a little work. 
Today, I get to talk about somebody 
who is retiring from my office who has 
had an outstanding relationship with 
everybody in my office, which is a feat 
that not a lot of folks are able to ac-
complish. But she is retiring. She is my 
scheduler. 
Her name is Trecia Bickford McEvoy. 
I would just say that Trecia is not here 
today. Hopefully, she is watching on C– 
SPAN. The reason she is not here is be-
cause of COVID. My wife is not here 
today, and my wife dearly wanted to be 
here today to hear this speech in per-
son. She is not here greatly in part be-
cause of COVID. 
But the bottom line is, when it comes 
to Trecia McEvoy—and any Senator 
knows this—the most difficult job in 
any office in the U.S. Senate is the per-
son who schedules the Senator’s time. 
It is tough enough to be able to get to 
the committee meetings on time and 
be able to deal with the floor schedule 
and make sure you are meeting with 
constituents all in a timely order, not 
holding anybody up. But in my par-
ticular case, it is even more difficult 
because, as the folks in this body 
know, I still farm. So getting back to 
Big Sandy, MT, to that farm 12 miles 
west, to be able to do the things that I 
need to do, whether it is planting, 
whether it is harvesting, whatever it 
is, in a timely manner is also really 
important. 
Not only did Trecia have to deal with 
my schedule here in the Senate, she 
had to deal with a very, very uncertain 
schedule on the farm. Let me give an 
example. I may be peeling out of here 
on a Thursday night with full inten-
tions to plant some peas the next day. 
When I call my wife Sharla and say 
‘‘What is the weather like?’’ she will 
say ‘‘It is raining,’’ to which I call back 
Trecia and say ‘‘Trecia, you have to 
schedule for me for work in the State 
because I can’t do any farming’’ to 
which she would go to work and over 
the next 12 hours, starting at about 4 
or 5 in the afternoon, would help sched-
ule, working with my State schedule

November 30, 2020 
and working with the staff, a full day 
of work the next day. 
That didn’t happen once in a while. 
That happened almost every weekend 
because, as those of us involved in agri-
culture know, it either rains too much 
or not enough; the Sun either doesn’t 
shine enough or it shines too much. 
The truth is, Trecia had to juggle all 
of those balls in the air to make sure 
that everything got done, to make sure 
that I was able to do my job as a Sen-
ator, that I was able to meet with 
those constituents, that I was able to 
meet with those trade groups that were 
out there, and that I was able to meet 
with different businesses around the 
State of Montana and then also have 
time enough to be able to operate the 
farm. She did it, and she did it with a 
smile on her face. The reason that is 
important is because sometimes those 
calls didn’t come at 5 in the afternoon; 
sometimes those calls came at mid-
night Montana time, which, inciden-
tally, is 2 in the morning here, and she 
always answered the phone—always— 
and she was always there with a solu-
tion to any problem I might have. It 
made life so much easier. That is why, 
when I hired Trecia McEvoy, it was the 
best hire I have ever made in my near-
ly 14 years in this body. 
Trecia, when I hired her, was already 
a seasoned veteran. She spent more 
than 15 years scheduling for Senator 
Jim Jeffords before I was able to hire 
her. We asked her former colleagues in 
Jeffords’ office to reminisce on their 
time working with Trecia. One of them 
was something that is perfectly Trecia 
McEvoy. The quote goes like this: 
Trecia was a fierce keeper of the gate 
and protector of Senator Jeffords. The 
staff didn’t worry too much about Jim 
getting mad at us but, rather, Trecia 
getting mad at us. Whether she was 
protecting his time with an important 
dignitary, protecting his popcorn and 
his frozen yogurt lunches, or making 
sure that Jim wore his Senate softball 
uniform underneath his suit to hit the 
field after the vote, she never missed a 
beat. 
Coincidentally, here in the Senate, 
she met her husband Jeff when she 
worked in Jeffords’ office. Some of you 
may know Jeff. He is one of the Sen-
ate’s longest serving photographers. 
Jeff was an Army veteran, serving from 
1981 to 1989. Coming to the Senate after 
his retirement, where he has been ever 
since, he worked his way up, holding 
positions as official photographer, lead 
photographer, 
photographic 
services 
supervisor, and lastly, branch manager. 
Jeff and Trecia still have—at least 
until the pandemic hit—lunch in the 
Dirksen cafeteria every single day. Be-
tween the two of them, they had two 
kids, Zach and Ian. It has been a privi-
lege of my lifetime to watch those kids 
grow up, to go to an occasional hockey 
game—something that I know nothing 
about—and have Trecia tell me how 
the sport works. 
Look, it is never easy when you have 
somebody who sits right outside the 
door of your office—usually the first 
person you see when you come into the 
office, and it is usually the last person 
you see when you leave it. But Trecia 
was a pro. She is a pro. 
Today I should feel sad, but I don’t. I 
actually feel very happy for her be-
cause she gets to retire, and she gets to 
move up to New Hampshire. I think, if 
she is watching in Washington, DC, 
right now, she is probably sitting on 
cardboard boxes full of clothes or 
dishes or whatever it might be because 
my guess is, as of tomorrow, she will 
probably be in New Hampshire in short 
order. But the truth is, she will be able 
to go up there and enjoy life and look 
back at her time here in the Senate 
and understand that she has done a job 
well done. I would just say that the 
next chapter in her life, I have no 
doubt, will be just as exciting as the 
last one. 
Trecia said: I remember there was a 
day—she told me that when she retires, 
she will look up at the dome and no 
longer feel a sense of wonder. I don’t 
believe that is true. I think now that 
she is retired, she will look up at this 
dome that we all work under and think 
of the incredible stories and the incred-
ible experiences and the incredible peo-
ple, that she was able to enrich their 
lives and make life better for them. 
Even though, Trecia, you are going 
to be a shot up north in New Hamp-
shire, you will always be a part of my 
team, Team Tester. And I will tell you 
that Sharla and my kids and my staff 
and I thank you for everything you 
have done. Hopefully you won’t be a 
stranger. Hopefully you will come back 
on occasion, come into the office and 
tell us what we are doing wrong and 
what we are doing right, because you 
are the best. 
I yield my time. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LANKFORD). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NOMINATION OF TAYLOR B. 
MCNEEL 
Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I rise in 
strong support of the nomination of 
Taylor Brantley McNeel for the U.S. 
District Court for the Southern Dis-
trict of Mississippi. We will vote in a 
few minutes on the first vote for this 
outstanding nominee, the cloture vote, 
and then I have every reason to believe 
that tomorrow, this outstanding can-
didate will be confirmed for elevation 
to the U.S. District Court of the South-
ern District of Mississippi. 
Sometimes when we vote, those con-
firmation votes are party-line votes. I 
think, happily, many times they are bi-
partisan. 
Based 
on 
conversations 
across the aisle, I have every reason to 
believe that the vote on Taylor McNeel 
will, in fact, be bipartisan. I certainly 
hope it will be because his support 
back home in Mississippi is certainly 
bipartisan and multicultural because 
he is such an outstanding individual 
and such an outstanding attorney and 
an outstanding member of our State 
community. 
Taylor McNeel’s life has been marked 
by excellence at every point. Of course, 
he is a great lawyer. He is a partner in 
the law firm of Brunini, Grantham, 
Grower & Hewes, where he oversees the 
gulf coast office for this large law firm. 
Taylor McNeel has led a distinguished 
career in the firm, with extensive expe-
rience in both bench and jury trials in 
Federal and State courts. He has 
served as lead counsel for numerous ap-
peals to the Mississippi Supreme Court, 
the Mississippi Court of Appeals, and 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit. His clients include individuals, 
government entities, and businesses 
covering a vast range of law. 
I believe Senators should be im-
pressed also by his work on behalf of 
disadvantaged members of our commu-
nity back home. He maintains a strong 
pro bono practice, representing clients 
who would not normally be able to af-
ford legal services. I think he is to be 
commended for that. 
His academic credentials are impec-
cable. He was a cum laude graduate 
from the University of Mississippi, 
where he received his undergraduate 
degree. As an undergraduate, he was an 
outstanding athlete as well as leader. 
He was a member of the Ole Miss Rebel 
football team and was elected senior 
class president of that outstanding uni-
versity. 
He went on to receive his juris doctor 
degree cum laude from the University 
of Mississippi School of Law, where he 
served on the Mississippi Law Journal. 
Taylor McNeel has been widely rec-
ognized as a young lawyer to watch. He 
has been named a Mid-South Rising 
Star in business litigation for 8 years 
in a row and has been listed 3 years in 
a row in the 40 & Under Hot List for 
the United States in benchmark litiga-
tion. Is it any wonder, then, that he 
has received a unanimous ‘‘qualified’’ 
rating by the American Bar Associa-
tion? Of course, we know that the high-
est rating a candidate for district judge 
can receive is the rating of ‘‘qualified,’’ 
and the fact that this was done unani-
mously by the committee—it just 
doesn’t get any better than that for a 
candidate for district judge. 
It is important to note also that Mr. 
McNeel is an outstanding and active 
member in his community and is wide-
ly respected there. He serves on the 
school board of the Pascagoula-Gautier 
School District. I might add that is a 
racially diverse school district. He is 
an elder in his church, First Pres-
byterian Church in Pascagoula, and he 
has been a member of the Rotary Club 
of Biloxi. 
Pascagoula is in Jackson County, 
where he is an outstanding citizen. Bi-
loxi is in Harrison County, and he is a

leader there. They are two of our most 
populous counties in the State of Mis-
sissippi, and he stands head and shoul-
ders above the crowd in both of those. 
He has been president of the Harrison 
County Bar Association and holds 
memberships in the American Inns of 
Court, the Federal Bar Association, 
Fifth Circuit Bar Association, and the 
Federalist Society. 
Taylor and his wife Jessica have 
three children: Mollie, age 10; Taylor, 
age 7; and Brantley Rose, born on the 
2nd day of this month. 
He has his hands full. I think he will 
be able to balance being a dad as well 
as a district judge. He has outstanding 
qualifications in the academic field, 
the judicial field, and his personal 
qualifications are absolutely out of 
this world. I am confident he will serve 
the Southern District of Mississippi 
and our country well if confirmed. 
We will vote on cloture in a few mo-
ments. Again, I am sincerely hoping 
and believe we will—based on conversa-
tions—have a bipartisan vote, and I 
urge my colleagues to join me in vot-
ing yes on the confirmation of Taylor 
McNeel. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
f 
PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see no-
body within 15 or 20 feet of me, so I will 
take the mask off, and I appreciate the 
fact the distinguished Presiding Officer 
recognized who it was even with the 
mask. 
I have a couple of things that con-
cern me. I was going through the his-
tory and looking at transitions be-
tween Presidents. I was struck by— 
even Presidents who did not like their 
successor—how hard they worked to 
make sure that everything was done 
properly for the good of the country. 
No matter how they might feel about 
themselves personally, they set the 
country first and foremost. I contrast 
that with what is happening now. 
Former Vice President, former U.S. 
Senator—I served with him—Joe Biden, 
got the most votes of any Democratic 
nominee for President in the history of 
this country—millions more than what 
President Trump got. He has an insur-
mountable lead in certified electoral 
votes. Yet the President, for weeks, re-
fused even to carry out the law that we 
all voted for—Republicans and Demo-
crats alike—to provide for transition 
whenever there is a transition, a law 
that was used quickly when President 
Trump was elected. Even though Hil-
lary Clinton had millions more votes 
than he did, she conceded the election, 
and within a day, the transition began. 
The idea is, whoever is President 
must know what is going on. Certainly, 
the distinguished Presiding Officer, 
like all of us, has access to and gets in-
telligence briefings on what is hap-
pening around the world. I think it dis-
closes nothing to say we live in per-
ilous times, and there are decisions any 
President must make, even if it is 5 
minutes after they are inaugurated, as 
was 
the 
potential 
when 
President 
Obama was inaugurated the first time. 
He actually had talking points to alert 
people to clear the malls in case there 
was an attack. 
Instead, today is only the first day 
that President-Elect Biden is getting 
the Presidential briefing. Vice Presi-
dent-Elect KAMALA HARRIS, of course, 
has the advantage as a member of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee to have 
a lot of that material anyway, but now 
they both do. 
But we look so foolish in the eyes of 
the rest of the world. We lecture dicta-
torships when they have rigged an elec-
tion so they can stay. We lecture them 
for doing that. We lecture those people 
who refuse to give up their office. Yet 
now they see the United States, the 
leading democratic country in the 
world, the country that always es-
pouses democracy, saying: Well, we are 
not going to follow our Constitution. 
We are not going to follow our laws. We 
will allow a lot of tweets from the in-
cumbent, but we are not going to fol-
low our law. 
What kind of example is that? 
Then the President does even worse 
by saying: Well, I am getting these 
calls from all these world leaders say-
ing to stick it out. But, of course, when 
asked ‘‘Well, who were they?’’ suddenly 
he can’t seem to remember who it was 
who called—if there were any such 
calls; I suspect there weren’t. 
Let’s stop the charade. Let’s make 
more of an effort to have a smooth 
transition. There are enough things 
that face this country. We should not 
have, for the first time in our history, 
this kind of foolishness. 
I applaud those few members of the 
Republican Party who have been hon-
est enough to say: It is over. We know 
it is over. 
I think when you go back in history, 
when Richard Nixon faced impeach-
ment and ultimate conviction here in 
the Senate, some of the most respected 
Republican Senators went down to see 
him quietly—people like Hugh Scott, 
the Republican leader, whom I got to 
know well, and Barry Goldwater, ‘‘Mr. 
Conservative,’’ whom I got to know 
well. They went down—not with any 
happiness in doing this, as one of them 
told me subsequently there was actu-
ally sorrow in their hearts—to tell the 
President he had to leave; the time had 
come. 
The President did, and the Repub-
licans and Democrats came together to 
help install the next President, Jerry 
Ford, and the next Vice President, Nel-
son Rockefeller. The two of them be-
came the first President and Vice 
President never to have been elected. 
Jerry Ford and Nelson Rockefeller 
were the first President and Vice Presi-
dent never to be elected but to be ap-
pointed. That was about the time I 
came to the Senate. 
I remember hearing Republicans and 
Democrats alike saying: We might not 
like to say what happened, but we 
knew the government had to keep 
going, and we had to show credibility 
to the rest of the world. So long as we 
pretend that we have a Presidency by 
tweet, we don’t show that integrity to 
the rest of the world. 
I was there for the inauguration of 
President Trump. Even though I had a 
different candidate and voted for her, 
Secretary and former Senator Hillary 
Clinton, I was there—as was Secretary 
Clinton and her husband, former Presi-
dent Clinton, and outgoing President 
Obama and outgoing Vice President 
Biden—to show the world that we have 
continuity. Even though there is a vast 
difference of opinion, we have con-
tinuity. 
That is not the image we are showing 
now. With everything that is hap-
pening, whether it is in Iran or, eco-
nomically, with Brexit and the United 
Kingdom or a COVID epidemic around 
the world, we, the United States of 
America, should show unity, at least 
under our Constitution. 
Of course, Republicans should be sup-
porting Republicans and, of course, 
Democrats should be supporting Demo-
crats. But the one thing we should all 
be supportive of is our Constitution 
and our laws. 
We stand down there—the proudest 
moments of my life were standing 
down here and taking my oath to up-
hold the Constitution as United States 
Senator, just as I did when I became 
President pro tempore. I did it to up-
hold the Constitution of the United 
States, not the Constitution of the 
Democratic Party, not the Constitu-
tion of the Republican Party, but the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America. 
Let’s get on with the transition. 
Let’s make America strong again. 
Let’s do what is necessary to be done 
to fight this COVID epidemic. 
In that regard, we have two matters 
that should be the most important 
matters before us. One is getting an 
omnibus because, after all, in a couple 
of weeks, funding for the United States 
of America will run out, and we don’t 
want to have one of those foolish shut-
downs that we had before that cost the 
taxpayers billions and billions of dol-
lars. Only four of us—Senator SHELBY 
and myself and our counterparts in the 
House just down the hall—met in my 
office and worked out a bipartisan res-
olution and passed the spending bill so 
that we could put the government back 
in order. Ironically, it was exactly 
what we had offered weeks before. For 
some reason the White House didn’t 
want to accept it, and billions of dol-
lars of taxpayers’ money were lost. 
Now we have a life-or-death issue 
that goes beyond even the spending, 
and that is COVID. The House of Rep-
resentatives, back in June, I believe it 
was, passed the Heroes Act to have 
money, equipment, and so forth for 
those who are suffering because of the 
COVID epidemic, like the small stores, 
inns, restaurants, and so forth in my

State, to say nothing about our hos-
pitals that are overwhelmed. 
We had money in there. The Repub-
lican leader refused to even bring the 
bill up for a vote. I can’t say why. The 
Republicans are in the majority. Bring 
it up. Have four or five amendments on 
both sides. Have four or five Repub-
lican amendments and four or five 
Democratic amendments. Vote them 
up or down. What are we afraid of? Why 
would we refuse to vote? If the Repub-
lican leader doesn’t like the bill, in-
stead of blocking it and not even hav-
ing a vote on it, vote it up or down. 
The Republicans are in the majority. 
They could vote down any aid for the 
States that are suffering with COVID, 
but vote it up or down. 
I have heard some Senators say: But 
they are nervous. Whichever way they 
vote, it might be uncomfortable back 
home. It might not be politically good 
for them back home. 
Balderdash. The fact is that we were 
sent here to vote. I have voted more 
than any Senator in the history of this 
country, save one. I have cast well over 
16,000 votes. If people were to go back 
to those votes and ask: ‘‘What were you 
thinking on this vote in 1978 or 1986 or 
1995,’’ I would probably look at it and 
say, ‘‘Hmm. In retrospect, I think I 
probably screwed up.’’ Yet I was will-
ing to vote. I was willing to vote. 
When I was the key vote in the 
Armed Services Committee to stop the 
war in Vietnam, I knew that our 
State’s largest newspaper would attack 
me mercilessly, and it did for months 
after that. It would be hard today to 
find anybody who would be in favor of 
continuing that war in Vietnam, but 
we had five votes in a row in the Armed 
Services Committee, and each one 
failed by one vote. I was its newest 
member, but I was there to vote, which 
is what we have to do. 
I look at some of my friends on the 
Republican side who have joined me on 
some very tough votes. I don’t want to 
embarrass the senior Senator from 
Texas, but he is on the floor. With re-
gard to the Freedom of Information 
Act, we stood up against both Repub-
licans and Democrats and said: No, we 
are standing up for the people of Amer-
ica, and we are going to have votes on 
this so they can see what their govern-
ment is doing. That is what we have to 
go back to. We have to go back to the 
time when we could do that. 
What I would urge of the Republican 
leadership is to bring up a COVID bill— 
a real COVID bill. Have a few amend-
ments on both sides. Vote them up or 
down. If you don’t like an amendment 
somebody has, vote against it. If you 
like it, vote for it. Let the American 
people at least have some hope that we 
are doing something for them. 
Too many businesses are going out of 
business. Too many families don’t 
know what they are going to do when 
the schools close. Too many small hos-
pitals, especially in rural areas, wonder 
what they are going to do as COVID 
sweeps through. Let’s give them some 
hope. Let’s say to the people: No, you 
are not going to be kicked out of your 
home. No, you are not going to be liv-
ing in your car. We will give you 
money to get through this, knowing 
that the economy can be much strong-
er afterward if you do. Certainly, it is 
going to be much stronger for those in 
our labor force if they are still in their 
homes, as the jobs open back up, than 
if they are homeless. 
So let’s do that. Let’s bring it up and 
vote. Senator SHELBY
and I have 
worked very, very hard on bipartisan 
legislation for the omnibus. We prob-
ably have, maybe, 95 to 98 percent of it 
agreed on. Bring it up. Then, on the 2 
or 3 or 4 percent, bring votes up. Vote 
it up or vote it down. After all, the Re-
publicans are in the majority. If they 
don’t like it, vote it down, but let’s get 
the vast bulk of it through, which is 
something that both Republicans and 
Democrats have worked together on. 
My staff has worked together with the 
Republicans’ staff, and we have some-
thing we can do there. So vote it up or 
vote it down. Let’s just vote on it. 
Then let’s let people leave here. Let 
our staffs, the people who work in the 
hallway, and the people who are here 
on the floor go where it is safe. I am 
glad to see the distinguished Presiding 
Officer has gotten over his own bout of 
COVID. He and everybody else here 
who has suffered from it have been in 
my prayers, but there are millions of 
others who are suffering from it, and in 
the highest number we have ever had, 
they are dying from it. 
Let’s get together. Let’s do what the 
American people want. Let’s do what 
we were elected to do. Let’s not be 
afraid to vote. Don’t be afraid to vote. 
Certainly, I may have thought long and 
hard about some of those 16,000 votes I 
have cast, but I have never been afraid 
to vote. I have never been afraid to 
vote. 
I see my colleague and friend waiting 
for the chance to speak, so I yield the 
floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCOTT of Florida). The Senator from 
Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, first, 
while he is still on the floor, let me say 
that I agree with the senior Senator 
from Vermont. If you don’t want to 
vote, you probably ought to look for 
another line of work. Congress is a bad 
place to come if you don’t want to ac-
tually vote and be on record. 
f 
FOREIGN ACTORS 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Mr. 
President, 
as 
America waits for the results of the 
2020 election to be certified in a couple 
of weeks, former Vice President Joe 
Biden has begun to announce his picks 
for his Cabinet and other high-ranking 
positions. 
Some of these nominees have close 
ties to investment and other con-
sulting firms whose clients are largely 
unknown or who may be even the sub-
jects of nondisclosure agreements. The 
truth is that these individuals could be 
working on behalf of a ‘‘feel good’’ non-
profit, a malicious foreign actor, or a 
large company with business before the 
government. The truth of the matter 
is, we have simply no idea what kind of 
business 
or 
financial 
relationships 
these individuals have with foreign 
powers that could influence their ac-
tions as high-ranking government offi-
cials. This goes way beyond compliance 
with the Foreign Agents Registration 
Act. This is an ethical issue. It is a 
conflict-of-interest issue, and Ameri-
cans deserve to know if these nominees 
have connections or relationships that 
could cloud their judgment on behalf of 
the American people if they are con-
firmed. 
When it comes to the business deal-
ings of those who could serve in high- 
ranking 
government 
positions, 
full 
transparency is the only option. So I 
encourage each of these individuals, if 
nominated, to take an open-book ap-
proach throughout the hearings and 
confirmation processes. In fact, I will 
make a pledge here today that I will 
not support any nominee who doesn’t 
provide full transparency into his work 
on behalf of a foreign government. I 
will not do it. The American people de-
serve to know if these or any future 
nominees are beholden to anything 
other than our national interest. 
Just to make the point that this is 
not some imaginary or hypothetical 
problem, let me refer to an article that 
was written today in the Associated 
Press 
News, 
entitled: 
‘‘ ‘Mercenary’ 
donor sold access for millions in for-
eign money.’’ This is a story of a so- 
called elite political fundraiser, Imaad 
Zuberi, who, maybe not surprisingly, 
raised a lot of money for Hillary Clin-
ton and President Barack Obama and 
who also became the top donor to the 
Trump Presidential Inaugural Com-
mittee. In other words, he wasn’t par-
ticularly partisan. He just wanted to be 
close to power and be able to influence 
it. 
Prosecutors who have now pros-
ecuted him for a variety of violations 
of campaign finance laws and foreign 
lobbying laws have called him a merce-
nary political donor. His foreign entan-
glements were quite extensive. He lob-
bied as an unregistered foreign agent 
for at least half a dozen countries and 
officials, including a Ukrainian oli-
garch who was close to Russian Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin. He lobbied for 
countries like Turkey and Sri Lanka, 
among others. As I said, it really 
doesn’t make a difference so much 
which country. It was the fact that he 
was lobbying in an undisclosed fashion, 
raising money for political candidates, 
and violating campaign finance laws 
for which he has now pled guilty and 
will be awaiting sentencing after the 
first of the year. 
We spent a lot of the last 4 years— 
and, certainly, as a member of the Sen-
ate Select Committee on Intelligence, 
we spent about 31⁄2 years—investigating 
Russian interference with the 2016 elec-
tion. Yet, as this story makes clear,

Zuberi’s story shows there are far easi-
er ways to bend American foreign pol-
icy than by using sophisticated hack-
ing tools or well-funded troll farms. In 
other words, you can do it the way he 
has done it, which is by violating our 
foreign agent registration laws, rep-
resenting foreign governments and for-
eign interests, and hiring lobbyists and 
cutting out donors in a way that fun-
nels foreign money into the American 
political process—unbeknownst to peo-
ple like us unless it is disclosed. 
Between 1966 and 2015, the Depart-
ment of Justice brought just seven 
criminal cases for violating the law re-
lating to registering as a foreign lob-
byist, according to a 2016 inspector 
general’s report. So this is a serious 
topic. 
The incoming chairman of the Com-
mittee 
on 
the 
Judiciary, 
Senator 
GRASSLEY, and the current ranking 
member, Senator FEINSTEIN, and I have 
a bipartisan bill to reform the Foreign 
Agents Registration Act, but this is 
going to be front and center in the con-
firmation process for any nominee by 
the incoming administration, and I 
just think it is fair to place everybody 
on fair notice that full transparency is 
the only option. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, the Senate has, of 
course, returned for a last end-of-the- 
year legislative dash, and we have a lot 
of work to do before we cross the finish 
line. 
As we know, government funding will 
expire in less than 2 weeks, and we 
have to reach an agreement, as the sen-
ior Senator from Vermont mentioned, 
before the December 11 deadline of the 
current continuing resolution. With 
millions of Americans already facing 
economic uncertainty, a government 
shutdown is, surely, not an option. 
We need to pass the National Defense 
Authorization Act to support Amer-
ica’s brave servicemembers and ensure 
that our military leaders have the abil-
ity to plan and operate with certainty 
and provide peace through American 
strength. Also, as we move into the 
winter months, which the experts have 
told us will present new challenges in 
our war against the COVID–19 virus, it 
is time to cut the partisanship and de-
liver another round of relief to the 
American people. 
It is worth recounting—because peo-
ple have short memories, apparently, 
in Washington, DC—that, over the last 
several months, our Democratic col-
leagues have consistently talked about 
the need to bolster our support in the 
fight against COVID–19. Yet, despite 
the repeated rhetoric and calls to ac-
tion, they have unapologetically stood 
in the way of each and every attempt 
to make real progress. 
This summer, we proposed something 
called the HEALS Act—as the Pre-
siding Officer knows, for he was instru-
mental in that work—as a starting 
point for negotiations on a new relief 
package. It was a starting place, a 
place to begin bipartisan negotiations 
in the hope of crafting a package that 
could get the requisite number of 
votes. Unfortunately, before the elec-
tion, our Democratic colleagues had 
simply no interest in amending the bill 
or trying to find any kind of common 
ground. I think they thought it was to 
their political advantage for the Amer-
ican people to be experiencing the anx-
iety and the pain before the election. I 
can’t imagine holding them hostage, 
but that is what appeared, to me, to be 
the case. 
Instead of trying to find common 
ground—in 
particular, 
the 
Speaker 
made the amazing statement that 
nothing was better than something 
when it came to COVID–19 relief, which 
is just the opposite of what I have al-
ways believed—she demeaned the bill 
of half a trillion dollars in spending as 
‘‘pathetic.’’ The minority leader called 
it ‘‘unworkable,’’ but then they didn’t 
lift a finger to try to get anything 
done. 
So the next month we took another 
shot. We attempted to narrow the 
scope of negotiations to the most ur-
gent matters—things like continuing 
Federal unemployment benefits, which 
expired at the end of July. This is last 
July. This time our Democratic col-
leagues rejected what they called a 
‘‘piecemeal’’ approach. 
Well, never mind the fact that the 
House returned to Washington to help 
pass a bill that supported the U.S. 
Postal Service. We all believe in sup-
porting the Postal Service, but appar-
ently they thought that piecemeal bill 
was acceptable as long as it was a 
Democratic-authored bill and didn’t 
provide any additional relief to the 
American people. 
Well, being unsuccessful those first 
two times, we tried again a third time. 
So in September the majority leader 
tried to bring a bill to the floor to pro-
vide $500 billion for our shared bipar-
tisan priorities. There weren’t any real 
differences in what was in the bill. The 
only difference was that our Demo-
cratic colleagues wanted to spend mul-
tiples of that for unrelated activities. 
We wanted to concentrate the effort on 
helping small businesses keep their 
employees on payroll, giving schools 
the resources they needed to keep their 
students and teachers safe, strength-
ening testing nationwide, and investing 
in the continued success of Operation 
Warp Speed, which is going to deliver 
an FDA-approved vaccine before the 
end of the year—not just one, maybe as 
many as two or three, and more, per-
haps, to come. 
Anyone who has spent time watching 
C–SPAN over the last several months 
has heard both Republicans and Demo-
crats talk about the importance of 
every single one of these things, but 
when legislation that includes all of 
these priorities came up for an initial 
vote, 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
wouldn’t even allow us to get on the 
bill. In other words, here in the Senate 
you have to vote to get on the bill be-
fore you can then offer amendments 
and try to make it better. 
So they killed it. Without batting an 
eye, our Democratic colleagues voted 
in lockstep to block the bill and unani-
mously oppose legislation that would 
have invested an additional half-tril-
lion 
dollars 
in 
our 
fight 
against 
COVID–19. 
When the majority leader tried to 
bring the bill to the floor again in Oc-
tober, we saw exactly the same thing. 
It was the same bad movie all over 
again. Our Democratic colleagues re-
fused to let us even debate, much less 
to amend, the bill. 
It is not just these targeted packages 
that have been blocked by our Demo-
cratic colleagues. They stood in the 
way of our commonsense proposals, 
like the one from the now-former Sen-
ator from Arizona, Senator MCSALLY, 
which would have extended unemploy-
ment benefits for 1 week while we ne-
gotiated a larger compromise. 
Our friends on the other side of the 
aisle have repeatedly said that Con-
gress needs to act, but the reality is 
their own actions have prevented us 
from doing so. 
Month after month, they have dem-
onstrated it is either the House’s 
multitrillion-dollar, 
leftwing-policy 
grab-bag wish list or nothing. They 
have consistently told the American 
people: It is our way or the highway. 
You don’t get an extension of unem-
ployment insurance unless we get tax 
breaks for blue-State millionaires and 
billionaires. You don’t get vaccine 
funding unless we get diversity studies 
on the marijuana industry. You don’t 
get funding for schools unless we get 
permanent changes to hijack and take 
over our election laws and run them 
out of Washington, DC. 
Well, even rank-and-file Democrats 
have now understood and criticized 
this sort of bogus approach to legis-
lating. It has been the same song and 
dance 
month 
after 
month—fiery 
speeches, press conferences, tweets, 
and letters calling for action. But each 
time our Democratic colleagues have 
been given an opportunity to actually 
do something—to do more than spout 
off some meaningless, vapid rhetoric at 
the nearest microphone—they have 
simply stood in the way. 
The fact of the matter is our Demo-
cratic colleagues have blocked more 
COVID relief bills than they have 
passed. Yet they continue to feign out-
rage over Congress’s failure to pass a 
bill—we heard it again here today—as 
though they aren’t the ones responsible 
for the impasse. 
Our jobs here in the Senate aren’t 
simply to vote against imperfect bills. 
If that were the case, no bill would ever 
pass, because none of them is perfect. 
But this body is built on making im-
perfect legislation better through a de-
bate-and-amendment 
process—two 
processes we haven’t seen much at 
work this year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S7105 
November 30, 2020 
So the bottom line is Congress needs 
to act. The American people want 
Democrats and Republicans to come to 
an agreement on the things our coun-
try actually needs to make it through 
this crisis. 
It won’t be the last piece of legisla-
tion we pass, but we do need to do this 
next step, and we need to do it soon— 
as soon as possible. 
It is time for our Democratic col-
leagues to realize the election is over 
and the only real people being hurt by 
their intransigence are the people they 
represent in their various States. 
So it is time to start getting back to 
work for all the American people on a 
bipartisan piece of legislation and to 
quit the partisan games. I can’t say it 
any more directly than that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
this week, as we return to DC, we are 
going to resume consideration of the 
2021 National Defense Authorization 
Act. Around DC we call it the NDAA. 
And before I get into discussing some 
of my priorities in this legislation, I 
want to encourage each and every one 
of my colleagues to carefully consider 
why we go through the lengthy process 
of drafting and reconciling this author-
ization. And we do this every single 
year. 
The easy answer, of course, is that we 
have a duty to provide for our common 
defense and that of our allies and part-
ners. But every year the media devotes 
most of their attention to how much 
money we have agreed to spend on the 
tools of war—the Chinook helicopters, 
the Virginia-class submarines, and the 
Reapers. They want to know about the 
flashy hardware and end up ignoring 
the people who are in the driver’s seat. 
Thousands of service men and women 
call Tennessee home, and when I ac-
cepted the role of Senator, I took on a 
special responsibility to look after and 
to take care of each and every one of 
them. 
Their decision to serve came with 
necessary and serious lifestyle changes, 
both for themselves and for their fami-
lies. Anyone who knows a servicemem-
ber knows that their lives are not their 
own. They go where they are told to go. 
They do the job they are told to do. 
They do it without hesitation because 
they have accepted that serving their 
country is more important than the 
autonomy they sacrificed when they 
put on that uniform and took their 
oath. 
‘‘Sacrifice’’ is the key word here be-
cause it applies not only to the service-
member, but it also applies to their 
family. This is why we spend so much 
time focusing on programs that make 
their lives as seamless as possible. 
For example, this year, I continued 
work on military spouse license port-
ability to make it easier for spouses 
who wish to continue working in their 
chosen field after they have changed 
locations, moved from one State to an-
other, because they were told this was 
going to be their new duty station. We 
hope these spouses are able to continue 
their careers, to be fulfilled in their 
jobs and responsibilities. Last year, we 
established a pilot program for licen-
sure reciprocity, and this year, we 
worked to increase funding for this 
very important program. 
With my remaining time, I want to 
focus on our special operations commu-
nity, especially the 5th Special Forces 
Group and the 160th Special Operations 
Aviation Regiment. They each call 
Fort Campbell their home. 
For those who serve in these elite 
units, uncommon bravery is an every-
day occurrence. They go to some of the 
worst places on the face of the Earth, 
to be surrounded by the most dan-
gerous people alive, to do work that no 
one can ever know about and at a high-
er occupational tempo than any other 
aspect of our forces. Their operational 
tempo is unbelievable. The physical, 
spiritual, and psychological toll of that 
work and the stigma attached to it by 
those who do not understand its impor-
tance cannot be overstated. It is not a 
unique burden, but it is an especially 
heavy burden. 
U.S. Special Operations Command 
knows this and has made taking care of 
the people behind this mission a pri-
ority. They created the Preservation of 
the Force and Families Program to 
support these warriors and their fami-
lies, but, like any program of this na-
ture, it requires continuous innovation 
and evolution to stay effective. 
This year’s Senate-passed NDAA re-
affirms the importance of this initia-
tive to both servicemembers and their 
families and improves human, psycho-
logical, spiritual, and social perform-
ance programs. It also requires a deep-
er study on new opportunities for spe-
cial and incentive pay parity in order 
to increase retention of our valuable 
special operators. 
This is only one aspect of an expan-
sive piece of legislation, but it provides 
a useful reminder that every dollar— 
every single taxpayer dollar that we 
spend to defend the cause of freedom is 
gone to waste if we ignore the unique 
needs of the people fighting our battles 
for us. We have to put the emphasis on 
this human capital—on the individual, 
on their family. 
This is one of those moments where 
it would be in everyone’s best interest 
and our Nation’s best interest to avoid 
playing politics with a very important 
policy—protecting 
these 
men 
and 
women in uniform, providing for the 
common defense, providing the tools, 
the training, and the services they 
need in order to be ready to deploy, in 
order to take care of their families, in 
order to treat their wounds when they 
return—to care for the whole of the 
soldier. 
At the risk of sounding like a broken 
record, delay isn’t an inconvenience 
when it comes to the NDAA. It is not a 
bump in the road. When it comes to our 
Nation’s defense spending, delay is dan-
gerous. It is dangerous for our national 
defense, it is dangerous for the allies 
and the partners who depend on us, and 
it is dangerous for our troops and their 
families. It is my hope that we will be 
able to proceed with consideration of 
the final 2021 NDAA with that above all 
else at the forefront of our minds. 
I yield the floor.

TRIBUTE TO TIMOTHY P. WHITE 
∑ Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to recognize and pay tribute 
to the honorable service of Dr. Tim-
othy P. White, who will be retiring as 
chancellor of the California State Uni-
versity, CSU. 
Chancellor Timothy P. White has 
served as the California State Univer-
sity’s seventh chancellor since Decem-
ber 2012. His leadership of the Nation’s 
largest and most diverse university 
system—23 campuses, 482,000 students, 
53,000 faculty and staff, and 3.8 million 
alumni—has been characterized by his 
heartfelt and unwavering dedication to 
the students. 
In fact, it was that commitment to 
student success that led Chancellor 
White in 2015 to launch the ‘‘Gradua-
tion Initiative 2025,’’ an ambitious sys-
temwide effort to increase graduation 
rates and to eliminate equity and op-
portunity gaps between underserved 
students and their peers. The initiative 
has already resulted in record numbers 
of baccalaureate degrees earned. 
Further, Chancellor White has been a 
strong advocate for diversity and gen-
der equity, ensuring campus leaders, 
faculty, and staff reflect the commu-
nities they serve. In July 2018, CSU 
achieved national recognition for hav-
ing 12 female campus presidents—rep-
resenting more than half of the CSU’s 
campuses—quadrupling the number of 
female presidents from the time Chan-
cellor White assumed office and far 
surpassing the national average of 30 
percent female leadership at higher 
education institutions. 
A caring and forward-thinking lead-
er, he has been committed to compas-
sionate action on behalf of Dreamers 
and has spearheaded efforts to support 
title IX rights and to prevent sexual 
assault on campus. Chancellor White 
commissioned the first-ever study of 
homelessness and hunger among uni-
versity students and has instituted in-
novative programs to help students 
meet their basic needs. He has also 
worked to ensure that the CSU shines 
as a leader on environmental sustain-
ability and climate change education 
and policy. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has proven 
to be a difficult challenge for higher 
education, but Chancellor White has 
displayed bold leadership, delaying his

planned retirement to ensure steady 
decision making that has not only al-
lowed the CSU to sustain its high-qual-
ity instruction and operations but also 
helped the university to thrive, with 
record-setting 
numbers 
of 
degrees 
awarded in spring 2020 and the univer-
sity’s largest ever student body en-
rolled in the fall. 
A clarity of vision, a heartfelt and re-
lentless focus on student success, and 
an emphasis on collaborative leader-
ship, combined with a ready sense of 
humor and a warmth and generosity of 
spirit, have defined Chancellor White’s 
tenure. 
I applaud Dr. White’s lifetime of 
service to the betterment of our State 
and its students, and I wish him the 
best as he begins this next chapter of 
his life.∑

REMEMBERING DENNIS RUSSELL 
WEDDLE 
∑ Ms. ROSEN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life and service of 
my friend and a great Nevadan, Dennis 
‘‘Denny’’ Russell Weddle, who passed 
away on August 2, 2020. Denny served 
our country in the U.S. Air Force for 
over 20 years and retired as lieutenant 
colonel with a distinguished military 
career, serving in Vietnam and as the 
information officer on the U.S. Air 
Force 
Thunderbirds 
Demonstration 
Team from 1969 to 1971. 
In 1969 Denny was first stationed at 
Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada—the 
proud home of the U.S. Air Force 
Thunderbirds Demonstration Team— 
and after retiring from the Air Force, 
he stayed in Las Vegas and became the 
director of corporate public affairs at 
Summa Corporation, which is where I 
had the pleasure of working with him. 
Later, Denny founded his own full-serv-
ice marketing, public relations, and 
government 
affairs 
agency, 
called 
Denny Weddle & Associates. 
Denny was a dedicated public servant 
with an exceptional history of commu-
nity engagement, serving as the presi-
dent of the Military Officers Associa-
tion, a member of the Vietnam Vet-
erans Association and the American 
Legion, and the founder of the Nellis 
Support Team. Denny also was the 
chair of the board of the Las Vegas 
Chamber of Commerce and served as 
the president or the chair of over 30 
major nonprofits in our community. 
I am so pleased to have known Denny 
Weddle, and I am so thankful for his 
engagement and commitment to Ne-
vadans. Denny’s contributions to both 
the Las Vegas and the Nellis Air Force 
Base communities will be missed.∑

E1073 
November 30, 2020 
DR. ANN ALBRIGHT 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 30, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor Dr. Ann Louise Albright, Ph.D., RDN, for 
her work on the prevention and treatment of 
diabetes. Dr. Albright, who retires at the end 
of this year, should be celebrated and honored 
for her dedication and commitment to bringing 
an end to this disease that affects so many 
Americans. 
Dr. Albright’s career has spanned political 
and international boundaries. She has rep-
resented the United States before the World 
Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) and as 
a member of the Board of Directors of the 
International Diabetic Athletes Association. 
Ann has worked for national agencies since 
early 2003. She first worked as a health policy 
advisor for the U.S. Surgeon General, and 
then in 2007 became Director of the Division 
of Diabetes Translation, where she has been 
since. 
Dr. Albright’s extensive knowledge and ex-
perience in her field have led to many awards. 
She has been recognized with the Hubert H. 
Humphrey Award for Service to America, a 
Lifetime Achievement Award from the YMCA, 
the Surgeon General’s Medallion Award, and 
multiple awards from the American Diabetes 
Association, including the Outstanding Educa-
tor in Diabetes Award and the Josiah Kirby 
Lilly Distinguished Service Award, among oth-
ers. 
I thank Dr. Albright for all she has done for 
those who live with diabetes every day. Her 
work with Congress, and particularly with the 
Diabetes Caucus, has been invaluable, and 
her unwavering commitment is an example for 
all those who continue her work. We wish her 
all the best in her well-deserved retirement.

NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP ACT 
OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, November 19, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of my amendment. 
The registered apprenticeship system is our 
nation’s most successful federal workforce 
program and has created a pathway for mil-
lions of Americans to achieve the American 
Dream since its creation more than 80 years 
ago. 
With more than 600,000 apprenticeships na-
tionwide, including more than 6,000 in my 
home state of Colorado, apprenticeships pro-
vide workers with paid, on-the-job training, and 
more than 94 percent are employed upon 
completion. 
However, while this time-proven apprentice-
ship model is successful, we can and must do 
more to expand and equip it to meet the de-
mands of our changing workforce. 
The National Apprenticeship Act of 2020 
would do that by greatly expanding upon the 
apprenticeship system and investing more 
than $3.5 billion to create nearly 1 million new 
apprenticeship opportunities over the next five 
years in nontraditional industries. 
And my amendment will ensure that the 
education sector is included in this expansion. 
Across the United States, there is a growing 
demand for qualified teachers. Schools—par-
ticularly low income schools—are struggling to 
hire and retain qualified teachers, which fur-
ther perpetuates a cycle of inequality that 
harms students, teachers, and the public edu-
cation system as a whole. 
Including the education sector in the expan-
sion of the registered apprenticeship system 
would address this crisis and help build a 
pipeline of qualified teachers that are prepared 
to teach on day one. As a product of public 
schools, I know the lasting impact teachers 
can have on students. Improving American 
education by investing in our teachers should 
be a top priority. 
I urge my colleagues to support this amend-
ment.

IN HONOR OF DR. JOSEPH 
DONNELL CARLEY, JR. 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 30, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to an 
outstanding educator, man of God, and dear 
friend of longstanding, Dr. Joseph Donnell 
Carley, Jr. Sadly, Dr. Carley passed away on 
Sunday, November 22, 2020. A home-going 
celebration was held graveside on Sunday, 
November 29, 2020, at 2pm in Thomasville, 
Georgia at Peaceful Rest Cemetery. 
Dr. Joseph Donnell Carley Jr. was born on 
November 11, 1955, in Thomasville, Georgia, 
as the fourth of seven children to the late Mr. 
Joseph Eugene Carley, Sr. and Mrs. Rosa-
mond Louise ‘‘Colvin’’ Carley. He grew up in 
the Tockwotten community and went on to 
earn an Associate’s degree in Biology and 
Early Childhood Education from Birdwood Jun-
ior College (now Thomas University); a Bach-
elor’s degree in Psychology from Valdosta 
State University (then Valdosta State College); 
and a Master’s in Early Childhood Education 
from Valdosta State University. In addition to 
receiving an honorary Doctorate degree in 
Early Childhood Education from the University 
of America, an affiliate of New York University, 
he also attended Continuing Education training 
for Early Childhood Education for Child Care 
leaders with the National Early Childhood Pro-
gram Accreditation’s National Administrators 
Credential (NECPA-NAC) and at University of 
Georgia, Albany State University, Bainbridge 
College, and Georgia State University. 
Dr. Carley had an immense passion for 
knowledge and bettering the lives of others 
through teaching. During his professional ca-
reer as an educator, he taught at every level 
of education. He was the owner of Mu-Dear 
Child Care Center and Preparatory Preschool, 
where he served in a number of roles for 39 
years. He taught in the Thomas County 
School System, the Thomasville City School 
System, and the Bainbridge State Hospital 
Special Education Department, also serving as 
an Adjunct Professor at Albany State Univer-
sity and Thomas University. In addition to his 
extensive career in Education and Administra-
tion, he was also a Consultant, Gospel An-
nouncer, Gospel Recording Artist, Motivational 
Speaker, Counselor, Mentor, School Board 
Member, and a National Instructor for the 
NECPA-NAC. 
Dr. George Washington Carver once said, 
‘‘No individual has any right to come into the 
world and go out of it without leaving behind 
distinct and legitimate reasons for having 
passed through it.’’ We are so blessed that Dr. 
Joseph Donnell Carley, Jr. passed this way 
and shared with us his legacy of service that 
will stand the test of time. Surely, the pearls 
of wisdom that Dr. Carley has given to all 
those whose lives he has touched will forever 
resonate in their hearts and spirits. 
On a personal note, Donnell Carley wowed 
me as a dynamic choral director of soul stir-
ring capacity. His body drama in directing a 
gospel choir drove countless congregations to 
stand on their feet and wave their hands dur-
ing worship and concert renditions. His pas-
sion for excellence and his God-given talents 
made a joyful noise of praise to God from 
whom all blessings flow. 
Donnell’s zeal for Early Childhood Edu-
cation, his years of dedication to Mu-Dear’s 
Child Care Center, and his effective service on 
the Thomasville City Board of Education re-
sulted in numerous phone calls, letters, and 
visits to my Congressional Office in Wash-
ington, DC. in support of improving education 
in America. Over the 28 years that I have 
known Dr. Carley, he has given me sage ad-
vice and counsel. He was direct and always 
told me not what he thought I wanted to hear, 
but what he thought I needed to hear. 
Dr. Carley was preceded in death by his 
parents and his sister, Armogene, but his leg-
acy lives on through his siblings Barbara, 
Susan, Gail, Rosamond, and Eugene; and a 
host of family and friends, who will miss him 
dearly. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second 
Congressional District, in honoring the life and 
legacy of Dr. Joseph Donnell Carley, Jr. and 
in extending our deepest sympathies to his 
family, friends, and loved ones during this dif-
ficult time of bereavement. Moreover, we pray 
that we will all be consoled and comforted by 
an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the 
days, weeks, and months ahead.

HONORING THE LIFE OF TOM 
UNTERMANN 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 30, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Tom Untermann who 
passed away on October 27, 2020, at the age 
of 73 after a lifetime of exemplary public serv-
ice to his community. 
Born in 1947 to Anne and Karl Untermann, 
Tom followed in his family’s footsteps in devel-
oping deep roots in the community through the 
family business. His great uncle, Richard 
Lohrmann, emigrated from Germany in 1909 
to San Rafael in pursuit of the American 
dream. Upon arrival, he purchased a small 
plot of land and opened a neighborhood nurs-
ery. In 1954, having inherited the family green 
thumb, Tom’s father purchased the nursery. 
Today, West End Nursery celebrates 110 
years as a valued business of San Rafael. 
In his youth, Tom excelled as an athlete 
both at San Rafael High School and the Uni-
versity of California, Davis, where he won two 
conference championships as a power forward 
for the basketball team. It was at UC Davis 
that Tom met his wife, Merrie, and the two re-
turned to San Rafael to raise their sons, Chris 
and Kurt. Once back in San Rafael, Tom in-
herited West End Nursery from his father, be-
coming a third generation family owner. 
Working closely with his son Chris, Tom fos-
tered a welcoming environment at the nursery, 
sharing his vast knowledge of plants with all 
customers, from experienced green thumbs to 
first time gardeners. Every December, with the 
support of Merrie and his daughter-in-law Bar-
bara, Tom would construct a beautiful Christ-
mas display within the nursery inviting commu-
nity members to visit and marvel in the holiday 
spirit. 
Tom’s positive impact on the community ex-
tended beyond the nursery. He spent many 
years coaching San Rafael High School ath-
letics and played a lead role in the construc-
tion of the high school’s new baseball field, in-
vesting many years and his personal funds 
into the project. In honor of his tireless dedica-
tion to community athletics, Tom was awarded 
a special recognition by the Marin Athletic 
Foundation Hall of Fame in 2007. 
Tom was a well-respected community lead-
er who will be remembered for his generosity 
of spirit and enduring commitment to public 
service. He is survived by wife, Merrie; sons, 
Chris and Kurt; daughters-in-law, Barbara and 
Elizabeth; 
grandchildren, 
Walker, 
Wade, 
Waylen, Tanner, Hudson, and Emilia; and sib-
lings, Richard, Dennis and Jeanne. Madam 
Speaker, while Tom Untermann will be greatly 
missed, his legacy will live on through the in-
delible positive impact he had on his many 
friends, family and the community at large. 
Please join me in extending our deepest con-
dolences to his family and friends.

HONORING MAYOR JILL TECHEL 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 30, 2020 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Jill 
Techel for her leadership and accomplish-
ments, and to mark her retirement after 16 
years as Mayor of the City of Napa. 
Jill Techel grew up in Grand Forks, North 
Dakota and earned a Bachelor’s degree in so-
cial work from the University of North Dakota. 
She moved to Napa in 1971, where she 
began her public service career as a member 
of the Napa Parks and Recreation Commis-
sion and the Napa Valley Unified School Dis-
trict Board, eventually serving as the leader of 
both organizations, all while raising her two 
children. In 1996, she was appointed to the 
Napa City Council, where she was reelected 
twice before being elected Mayor in 2005. 
One of Mayor Techel ’s most important 
achievements during her tenure was cham-
pioning the Napa River and Napa Creek Flood 
Protection Project, which rerouted the Napa 
River to prevent devastating floods in down-
town Napa, a consistent problem in the city 
before her efforts. Without Mayor Techel’s per-
sistence in advocating for funding in Wash-
ington on behalf of Napa, this project would 
not have been realized. 
Mayor Techel’s legacy extends far beyond 
her commitment to flood prevention. She has 
helped build up Napa ’s world-class reputation 
by cultivating a vibrant arts scene through the 
creation of the Rail Arts District, BottleRock 
Festival, and the Napa Art Walk. She has also 
supported arts education, collaborating with 
the school district to allow students to display 
their art at the Napa Lighted Art Festival, 
Napa ’s newest public art efforts. Through her 
calming presence, Mayor Techel has led the 
city through multiple crises, including the 2005 
flood, the 2014 earthquake, the 2017 fires, 
and the coronavirus pandemic. 
Throughout her time as mayor, Mayor 
Techel has been recognized countless times 
for leadership and dedication to her commu-
nity. In 2004, she received the Preceptor 
Award for Outstanding Leadership Profes-
sionals from the National Community Leader-
ship Association. Following the 2014 South 
Napa Earthquake, Mayor Techel was named 
the Napa Chamber Citizen of the Year for 
demonstrating immense leadership in her fight 
for resources to assist in Napa’s recovery. 
Madam Speaker, I join Napa in wishing 
Mayor Techel well as she goes from caring for 
her city to caring for her grandchildren in re-
tirement. Mayor Jill Techel exemplifies a 
strong, commonsense leader with admirable 
dedication to serving her community. It is 
therefore fitting and proper that we honor her 
today.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 30, 2020 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, due 
to a family obligation, I was absent from the 
House on November 20, 2020. Had I been 
present for Roll Call Vote 225 on House 
Amendment 901, I would have voted ‘‘yea.’’ 
Had I been present for Roll Call Vote 226 on 
House Amendment 902, I would have voted 
‘‘nay.’’ Had I been present for Roll Call Vote 
227 on Final Passage of H.R. 8294, the Na-
tional Apprenticeship Act of 2020, I would 
have voted ‘‘yea.’’ I am pleased that this legis-
lation to modernize our nation’s system of reg-
istered apprenticeships passed decisively in

IN 
HONOR 
OF 
THE 
EXTRAOR-
DINARY LIFE AND SERVICE OF 
STATE REPRESENTATIVE ALVIN 
HOLMES 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, November 30, 2020 
Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the extraordinary life and 
legacy of long-serving Alabama State Rep-
resentative Alvin Holmes of Montgomery. Rep. 
Holmes dutifully served as a member of the 
Alabama House of Representatives for 44 
years. Rep. Holmes passed away at home at 
the age of 81. Rep. Holmes was a dedicated 
public servant and community leader. Rep. 
Holmes led with dignity and a strong sense of 
justice throughout his career. He is remem-
bered by colleagues and the community as an 
individual who knew and acted on what was 
right, no matter the challenge. He is survived 
by his daughter, Veronica Holmes. 
Born in Montgomery on October 26, 1939 to 
John H. Holmes and Willie Ann Holmes, he 
was born and raised in Montgomery, AL. Rep. 
Holmes attended Rochester Business Institute, 
Alabama State University, Atlanta University, 
the University of Pennsylvania, the University 
of Alabama, and Jones School of Law. He 
held a Bachelor of Science degree, Master of 
Education degree, Master of Arts degree, and 
a Doctor of Law degree. Rep. Holmes 
marched with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a 
student and fought for the equal treatment of 
all Americans in every role he served. 
Rep. Holmes was a proud member of 
Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity, the NAACP, Mont-
gomery Improvement Association, a member 
of the State Democratic Executive Committee, 
and was a member of the Hutchinson Mis-
sionary Baptist Church. 
After graduating from Alabama State Univer-
sity, Rep. Holmes was an Alabama delegate 
to the historic 1968 Democratic National Con-
vention. He was a member of the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference, where he 
helped lead civil rights demonstrations in be-
tween his studies. Rep. Holmes served once 
more as an Alabama delegate to the 1996 
Democratic National Convention. 
In 1974, Alvin Holmes was elected to the 
Alabama House of Representatives. During 
the four decades of his service, Rep. Holmes 
gave a voice to the voiceless—a champion for 
equal rights and justice for all citizens. He led 
multiple efforts to deconstruct the remnants of 
segregation and to remove racist language 
from the State Constitution. One of his proud-
est accomplishments was establishing Martin 
Luther King Day as a state holiday and en-
couraging the hiring of African Americans for 
professional position at the Alabama Legisla-
ture. Rep. Holmes spearheaded the annual 
parade that is held on the Martin Luther King 
Jr. holiday. 
In 1993, Rep. Holmes successfully led the 
effort to remove the confederate flag from Ala-
bama’s State Capitol building. In addition, he 
sponsored a constitutional amendment to re-
move an interracial marriage ban from the Ala-
bama Constitution and fought for years to

have sexual orientation included in the state 
hate crime statute. 
Throughout his career, Rep. Holmes was 
known to extend his passion for justice by en-
suring tax dollars were spent wisely to best 
serve the people of Montgomery. Rep. Holmes 
always fought for what was right, a sharp critic 
and voice of truth in the Alabama Legislature. 
Rep. Holmes was a rigorous interrogator, 
often highlighting flaws or unintended con-
sequences in bills and other official actions. 
During his time on the Contract Review Com-
mittee, which oversees state government con-
tracts, Rep. Holmes was a watchful eye of 
government spending. 
On a personal note, State Representative 
Alvin Holmes stood as a towering giant of 
what was possible as a black Alabamian. For 
over forty years, his very presence in the Ala-
bama State legislature was a guiding example 
to boys and girls, like me, that African Ameri-
cans could get elected and succeed in politics. 
He was unapologetic about his race and al-
ways profound in his rejection of racism and 
discrimination. He taught us to fight for what 
we believe in and be willing to stand alone in 
our convictions. Rep. Holmes paved the way 
for so many of us to be in positions of power 
today. I know that I would not be Alabama’s 
first black Congresswoman, if not for his tire-
less efforts to promote fairness and equity for 
all in Alabama. The legacy of Rep. Holmes will 
live on in hearts and minds of all those he 
touched and for future generations of Alabam-
ians. 
On behalf of Alabama’s 7th Congressional 
District, I ask my colleagues to join me in rec-
ognizing the extraordinary life and service of 
Alabama State Representative Alvin Holmes 
and his incredible contributions to the Civil 
Rights movement, Alabama Legislature and 
the community of Montgomery.
