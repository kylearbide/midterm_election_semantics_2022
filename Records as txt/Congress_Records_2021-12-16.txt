f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, You have brought us to 
this season of great expectations as we 
prepare our hearts to welcome Your in-
tervening in human affairs. 
Lord, use our Senators to bring peace 
and unity to our Nation and world. In-
spire them to embrace optimism as 
they serve You and humanity. Help 
them yield to the inflow of Your in-
sight, vision, and guidance. 
Lord, we also pray for the millions 
who live in constant deprivation: the 
homeless and hungry, the oppressed 
and persecuted. Teach us how to share 
our more than enough with those who 
rarely have enough. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the

Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
pursuant to S. Res. 27, the Committee

question of reporting, I move to dis-
charge the Senate Committee on the 
Judiciary from further consideration of 
the nomination of Holly A. Thomas, of 
California, to be United States Circuit 
Judge for the Ninth Circuit from the 
Committee on the Judiciary. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the provisions of S. Res. 27, there will 
now be up to 4 hours of debate on the 
motion, equally divided between the 
two leaders or their designees, with no 
motions, points of order, or amend-
ments in order. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The yeas and nays are ordered. 
TRIBUTE TO JACK REED 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Madam Presi-
dent, I want to begin today with some 
celebrations. 
Recently, our dear colleague and 
friend Senator JACK REED of Rhode Is-
land cast his 8,000th vote as a Sen-
ator—a remarkable milestone for one 
of the most beloved and respected 
Members of this body. 
A lifelong Rhode Islander, a graduate 
of West Point, and the dean of the 
Rhode Island congressional delegation, 
Senator REED is one of America’s best 
examples of doing politics and public 
service the right way: no fuss, no non-
sense—just results. 
Over the years, he has been a mentor, 
a friend, and an invaluable resource for 
countless Members on both sides of the 
aisle. Few in this Chamber can match 
his expertise on matters of national de-
fense, veterans affairs, and the mili-
tary. I would also add that the same 
can be said about matching his attend-
ance. Over the years, he has missed 
just 38 votes on his way to 8,000—good 
for an attendance percentage of 99.5 
percent. Wow. 
As the Senate has undergone change 
over the years, Senator REED has re-
mained the same: focused on Rhode Is-
land, focused on our country, focused 
on keeping this Chamber working on 
behalf of the American people. We are 
lucky to call Senator REED our col-
league and friend. 
And so congratulations, JACK, on this 
milestone, and here is to 8,000 more 
votes to come. 
NOMINATIONS 
Madam President, last night, I filed 
cloture on 22 of President Biden’s 
nominees who, to date, have been 
pointlessly stalled by Republican ob-
struction—22. We are going to work 
until they are all confirmed by this 
Chamber, and we may need to add 
more. 
In past years, many of these nomi-
nees would have sailed through with 
consent and cooperation, but, this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9220 
December 16, 2021 
year, a handful of Republicans have hi-
jacked the rules of the Senate to slow 
the process down. It is cynical; it is en-
tirely pointless; and worst of all, it is 
damaging—seriously damaging—to our 
national security. 
This is the consequence of Repub-
lican obstruction. We are going to 
work on getting these nominees con-
firmed as long as it takes, and we could 
be back here in the near future doing 
this whole thing over again. 
For all the tortured logic we hear 
coming from the other side for why 
these nominations remain frozen, the 
fact is that my Republican colleagues 
who are holding these nominations up 
are deliberately making the American 
people less safe and making it harder 
for the administration to address the 
national security and economic chal-
lenges that face our Nation. 
It is unacceptable, and we are going 
to work to confirm these important 
nominees. 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Now, on voting rights, Madam Presi-
dent, as we continue working to bring 
the Senate to a position where we can 
move forward on Build Back Better, 
Senate Democrats have spent the past 
few weeks engaged in a separate discus-
sion on addressing another critical and 
urgent priority—protecting the right 
to vote and safeguarding our elections. 
Yesterday, I joined with a number of 
my colleagues in detailed conversa-
tions about how the Senate will get 
voting rights done in time for the 2022 
elections, 
including 
advancing 
the 
Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Act. 
In State after State, Republican-led 
legislatures are approving the most 
draconian voter registration laws that 
we have seen since segregation, and 
they are doing it on an entirely par-
tisan basis. Let me repeat that. Repub-
licans at the State level are passing 
the most egregious restrictions on vot-
ing rights that we have seen since seg-
regation, and they are doing it on an 
entirely partisan basis. 
Senate Democrats are working to 
find a path forward to respond to these 
attacks by passing legislation like the 
Freedom to Vote Act and the Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. Part of that 
conversation involves finding ways to 
restore the Senate so it can, once 
again, work as it is supposed to, as it 
has worked for generations before the 
gridlock of the past decade or so. 
These conversations are ongoing. The 
fight to protect voting rights is far 
from over in the Senate. Just because 
Republicans will not join us to defend 
democracy does not mean that Demo-
crats will stop fighting. This matter is 
too important not to act, even if it 
means we must act alone to get the 
Senate working. 
TRIBUTE TO SARA SCHWARTZMAN 
Madam President, finally, a fare-
well—as anyone who has been here a 
while knows, the U.S. Senate is more 
than just the sum of its elected Mem-
bers. Making this institution work is a 
daunting and awesome responsibility, 
and while the spotlight often falls on 
the men and women who stand behind 
these desks, this place would quickly 
unravel without the staff who work 
their magic behind the scenes. 
Today, we say goodbye and thank 
you to one of those incredible staffers, 
Sara Schwartzman, who will soon leave 
the Senate to pursue an opportunity 
with NASA. 
I join with all of my colleagues and 
with the rest of the Senate staff in say-
ing thank you, Sara, and best of luck 
on the road ahead. 
Thirteen years ago, Sara came to the 
Senate as a legislative support clerk 
with the executive clerk’s office. Over 
the years, she climbed up the ranks, 
thanks to her skill and to her dedica-
tion, eventually becoming bill clerk in 
2015. 
For those who don’t know, the bill 
clerk is one of the first gatekeepers for 
all new bills and resolutions that are 
introduced to the Senate. It is the bill 
clerk who brings order and sequence to 
the actions of this body, recording the 
Senate’s legislative activities, assign-
ing numbers to every bill and resolu-
tion, cataloging the status of each. 
In good times, this is difficult and 
precise work. But over the last few 
years, as we all know, Sara fulfilled her 
duties in the midst of a global pan-
demic and has had to adapt in unprece-
dented ways. Through it all, she never 
missed a beat. 
After 13 years, Sara deserves her 
gleaming sendoff as she pursues her 
next adventure in life. And as we say 
goodbye, we hope she knows she can al-
ways call this place home, and we will 
forever be grateful for all she has done 
to make this Chamber come to life. 
So to Sara, thank you. Thank you for 
everything. We will miss you, and we 
can’t wait to see what the future has in 
store for you. 
(Applause.) 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
KENTUCKY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Western Kentucky is still reeling from 
last weekend’s devastating storm, but 
support is rolling in from around the 
Commonwealth, our region, and the 
country as well. 
Yesterday, I spoke with the CEO of 
LifePoint Health. They operate 10 hos-
pitals in Kentucky, including one in 
hard-hit Mayfield. Miraculously, their 
Jackson Purchase Medical Center sur-
vived the tornado mostly intact. Now 
it is offering much needed medical 
services right there in Mayfield. 
Nurses and doctors have worked lit-
erally day and night. LifePoint Health 
shipped water tankers to their facility 
to bolster local supply, and the com-
pany has pledged a million dollars to 
help Kentucky rebuild. 
Across our region, individuals and 
companies are opening their hearts, 
homes, and wallets to help. 
We have received important assist-
ance from here in Washington as well. 
Yesterday, the President announced 
the Federal Government will fund the 
entire cost of debris removal and emer-
gency protective measures in the eight 
counties hardest hit by the storm for 
the next month. Local officials won’t 
need to worry about overstretching 
budgets. They can just focus on re-
building. 
My team and I are working hard to 
continue connecting Kentuckians with 
the resources they need. I have set up 
a portal on my Senate office website to 
help my constituents access govern-
ment assistance. It has a full list of 
services provided by our disaster re-
sponse Agencies. 
Because of the Federal Government’s 
swift action in the past week, victims 
of these tornadoes can access housing 
assistance, legal aid, crisis counseling, 
and more. 
I recommend every impacted Ken-
tuckian take advantage of these re-
sources, and my office is here to help 
you navigate. 
I will travel back to Kentucky to-
morrow to visit several of the commu-
nities that were hit hardest and meet 
with local leaders who are spear-
heading recovery efforts. I will listen 
to their concerns and bring their sto-
ries back to Washington to ensure that 
they get the help they desperately 
need. 
The scene on the ground in Western 
Kentucky is still devastating and quite 
discouraging. For far too many fami-
lies, this Christmas will be tragically 
abnormal. But we will continue to 
work together to provide Kentucky 
with the resources it needs to recover, 
bigger and better than before. 
BUILD BACK BETTER ACT 
Now, Madam President, on an en-
tirely different matter, two in three 
Americans want the Federal Govern-
ment to ‘‘cut back on spending and 
printing money.’’ That is two out of 
three Americans want the Federal Gov-
ernment to cut back on spending and 
printing money. But our Democratic 
colleagues 
spent 
the 
last 
several 
months trying as hard as possible to do 
exactly—exactly—the opposite. 
Washington Democrats have spent 
months trying to borrow, print, and 
spend trillions more dollars, right into 
the teeth of the worst inflation in al-
most 40 years. 
They have sought to turn their 
monthly welfare entitlement with no 
work requirements from a temporary 
COVID measure into a permanent pol-
icy—cash welfare with no work re-
quirements, literally forever. 
Seventy-six percent of Americans say 
these handouts haven’t helped their 
families at all. Yet Democrats want to 
dump many billions more. 
Just step back and look at all the 
ways their leftwing wish list could hurt 
a young family in middle America. 
First, they would need to cross their 
fingers that the private or employer- 
sponsored insurance they chose to

December 16, 2021 
meet their family’s specific needs isn’t 
shoved off a cliff in Democrats’ latest 
lurch toward more socialized medicine. 
And they will have to hope their war 
on 
the 
medical 
innovation 
sector 
doesn’t prevent the development of 
lifesaving cures their family might 
have relied on some years down the 
road. 
Say the family has one or two young 
kids. Maybe their ideal arrangement is 
a church-based daycare. They would 
need to say a prayer their faith-based 
center isn’t sued and chased out of 
business thanks to Washington Demo-
crats’ toddler takeover. 
Their plan would give nothing to full- 
time parents, grandparent caregivers, 
nanny shares, or neighborhood co-ops. 
It would push faith-based providers out 
of the public square by design, and it 
could inflate daycare costs—listen to 
this—by up to $12,000 or $13,000 per 
child per year. 
If Democrats get their way, let’s 
hope neither parent is one of the many 
Americans who work in our domestic 
energy sector. Our colleagues’ bill has 
a huge pile of new redtape aimed at 
putting their industry literally out of 
business. 
But no matter where they work, they 
will face inflated prices to heat their 
homes and fill up at the gas pump. 
For all of these bad ideas and many 
more, our colleagues wanted to spend 
trillions upon trillions more dollars 
right into the teeth—into the teeth—of 
runaway inflation that they have al-
ready caused. 
Yesterday, we got indications the far 
left’s slapdash sprint may be hitting 
the pause button. Well, that would cer-
tainly be great news for the American 
people. The best Christmas gift Wash-
ington could give working families 
would be putting this bad bill on ice. 
SENATE RULES 
Madam President, now, on another 
matter, as cracks keep forming in the 
Democrats’ reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree, some of our colleagues 
seemed to channel their frustration 
into even more radical attempts to at-
tack our government institutions. 
In the span of a few hours, one Sen-
ate Democrat had renewed calls to 
‘‘nuke’’ the Senate and break the rules, 
and another published a national op-ed 
arguing that Democrats should attack 
the rule of law and pack the Supreme 
Court—two frontal assaults on two 
branches of government proposed in 
the space of about 2 hours. Entire gen-
erations of statesmen would have seen 
either one of these unhinged proposals 
as Armageddon for our institutions. 
Ah, but apparently today’s Democrats 
try both at once and just call it 
Wednesday. 
We have heard false claims that the 
Senate obeying our rules to address the 
debt limit somehow paves the way for 
radicals to break the rules. 
Madam President, I would ask unani-
mous consent that an additional state-
ment on that subject be printed in a 
different place in the RECORD. 
ELECTIONS 
Madam President, so, look, we have 
discussed over and over again why 
Democrats will not be allowed to fed-
eralize our elections and lord over all 
50 States like a self-appointed board of 
elections on steroids. My colleagues 
across the aisle have pushed absurd 
bills that would do things like neuter 
voter ID laws; make every State legal-
ize ballot harvesting; turn the Federal 
Election Commission into a biased, 
partisan body; and even send taxpayer 
money to political campaigns. 
It isn’t about ‘‘voting rights’’; it is a 
naked power grab. Democrats have 
been pushing the same kinds of bills 
literally for years, even as their stated 
justifications 
have 
changed 
wildly. 
When Republicans win elections or 
start polling well, Democrats and the 
media say our democracy is badly bro-
ken, on death’s door, and needs a rad-
ical overhaul. The answers presented 
are these policies. When Democrats win 
elections, Democrats and the media 
say our democracy is sterling, beyond 
reproach, and just needs modest safe-
guards to protect the status quo, but, 
again, the answers presented are the 
very same policies. 
Lately, their pretext has been dema-
gogic attacks on State voting laws and 
proposals. If any State scraps any of 
the temporary pandemic procedures 
that Democratic operatives favor, the 
radical left says the sky is falling. But 
outside of the liberal bubble, nobody 
buys this nonsense. The country is not 
buying the hysteria. 
On election day last month—listen to 
this—even in deep-blue New York, vot-
ers rejected liberal ballot measures 
that would have liberalized no-excuse 
absentee voting and loosened up the 
rules on voter registration. Both those 
were voted down in New York. Not 
even blue New York wants these poli-
cies to weaken their elections. But 
some Democrats want to break the 
Senate and trash its rules to force 
these sorts of things on all 50 States? It 
is beyond absurd. 
I understand my colleagues are frus-
trated they may not get to spend $4.9 
trillion on the way out the door for 
Christmas, but, believe me, lashing out 
at our democracy, at the Supreme 
Court, and at the Senate itself is not 
going to solve anything. 
SENATE RULES 
Madam President, last week, bipar-
tisan majorities in the Senate and 
House passed S. 610 and the President 
signed the bill into law. 
This law prevented painful Medicare 
cuts and established a one-time, expe-
dited, simple-majority process to make 
Senate Democrats raise the nation’s 
debt limit with only Democratic votes. 
This week, some far-left activists and 
Senate Democrats who have spent 
months agitating to ‘‘nuke’’ the Senate 
are pretending that S. 610 represented 
some novel watershed for the Senate 
that gives them license to attack the 
institution. 
These are factual claims, and they 
are false. 
First, S. 610 needed to clear and did 
clear a 60-vote threshold. Sixty-four 
Senators voted to invoke cloture on 
the motion to concur in the House 
amendment. The Senate’s consider-
ation and passage of the bill fully 
obeyed the Standing Rules of the Sen-
ate. 
By contrast, ramming through a dif-
ferent fast-track procedure—or any 
other piece of legislation—with 50 
votes over the objections of Senators 
requesting the 60-vote threshold would 
mean ‘‘going nuclear,’’ shredding the 
rules, and destroying the filibuster. 
Last week, the Senate followed the 
rules. The far left wants Democrats to 
break the rules. There is no compari-
son. 
Second, there was nothing novel 
about S. 610 establishing a new, lim-
ited, expedited, simple-majority Senate 
procedure via statute. 
The Senate has passed many such 
laws creating many such procedures. 
Examples date back at least to the 
1930s. 
The much-used budget reconciliation 
process—with its limited, expedited, 
simple-majority Senate procedure—is a 
statutory creation of the Congressional 
Budget and Impoundment Control Act 
of 1974 and its amendments. 
Other examples include the Trade 
Act of 1974, the Defense Base Realign-
ment and Closure Act of 1990, the Con-
gressional Review Act of 1996, the 
Budget Control Act of 2011, and the Bi-
partisan Congressional Trade Priorities 
and Accountability Act of 2015. In all 
these instances, the Senate passed laws 
that set up new, limited, expedited, 
simple-majority Senate procedures for 
considering specific issues within spe-
cific parameters. 
In this historical context, the one- 
time Senate process that S. 610 created 
was notably limited and minimalistic. 
It could only be accessed once, during a 
narrow stretch of time, for one specific 
purpose, with no other provisions or 
amendments permitted. 
In sum, the Senate’s recent action on 
the debt limit did not change the fili-
buster any more than BRAC, TPA, or 
the 
Budget 
‘‘Super-Committee’’ 
changed the filibuster—which is to say, 
not at all. 
As the widely admired and acclaimed 
expert on Senate procedure Marty Gold 
summarized last week, ‘‘this expedited 
procedure will be created in accordance 
with the Standing Rules of the Senate, 
through passage of a regular order bill. 
The entire process must begin with 60 
votes. [And] if it becomes law, it will 
be the narrowest expedited procedure 
ever passed.’’ 
Last week’s episode did not give radi-
cals any pretext to wreck the Senate. 
Just the opposite. The Senate’s func-
tioning confirmed again that the cur-
rent Senate rules generate bipartisan 
compromise when the country needs it. 
TRIBUTE TO SARA SCHWARTZMAN

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9222 
December 16, 2021 
for the holidays, we will also bid fare-
well to a talented Senate staff leader 
who has kept our institution running. 
Sara Schwartzman is one of the Sen-
ate’s finest. Sara has been a familiar 
face around the Senate and on the dais 
for more than a decade, and the most 
visible parts of her work as the Sen-
ate’s bill clerk have certainly made her 
‘‘C–SPAN famous.’’ 
For years, she was among the fore-
most experts on the pronunciation of 
‘‘Mr. Alexander.’’ More recently, she 
has become well practiced in the deliv-
ery of ‘‘Ms. BALDWIN.’’ But Sara’s 
speaking role barely scratches the sur-
face of her crucial responsibilities as 
the bill clerk. Day in and day out, she 
and her team are the traffic cops for 
mountains 
of 
legislative 
text 
and 
amendments. Sara tracks the paper 
and the records. Before the Senate can 
formally pass anything, it has to make 
a stop at her desk. 
As if these core duties weren’t 
enough to keep even the most meticu-
lous multitasker busy, Sara has gener-
ously made herself available to folks 
throughout the institution as an infor-
mal resource. Bill status? Procedural 
hurdles? Sara’s encyclopedic expertise 
has been just a phone call away. It is 
safe to say her colleagues will miss this 
other sort of Senate hotline. 
As for Sara, one might worry that 
someone whose job is a part of every 
late-night vote and weekend session 
would struggle to fill her newfound free 
time, but I understand that, in this 
case, the Senate’s loss is another sto-
ried institution’s gain. Sara is leaving 
Washington but staying in public serv-
ice, working in an exciting role with 
NASA. 
So, Sara, thank you for your years of 
service, and good luck in the exciting 
chapters ahead. 
(Applause.) 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, let 
me first echo the comments of Senator 
MCCONNELL, as well as Senator SCHU-
MER
earlier, 
in 
wishing 
Sara 
Schwartzman the very best in her next 
undertaking. 
Whatever the challenge may be, I 
hope the hours are better because I 
know that the sacrifices made by you 
and members of our staff because of 
our peculiar scheduling in the Senate 
have caused some strains and stress 
and pressure and hardship. 
But thank you so much for making 
the Senate better with your service 
every single day. 
LITHUANIA AND BELARUS 
Madam President, I have tried to vis-
ualize this experience so many times: 
It was in July of 1911, and a ship ar-
rived in Baltimore from Germany. A 
family came down the gangplank. One 
of the members of the family was my 
grandmother, and she brought her 
three children. One of them was a 2- 
year-old 
little 
girl—blonde-haired— 
named Ona, my mother. 
How they managed to navigate their 
way through Baltimore and catch a 
train to East St. Louis, IL, I will never 
know because there were virtually 
none of them able to speak English, 
but they did. They arrived, and I grew 
up the son of a Lithuanian immigrant 
who was proud of what her family left 
behind and prouder still of what they 
found in this great country as Lithua-
nian Americans. 
I have had a special attachment and 
interest in the Baltic States—and par-
ticularly Lithuania—ever since. It has 
been my good fortune to follow their 
history from Soviet occupation and op-
pression to freedom and democracy 
today. 
If you go on a search engine on your 
computer and type in the word ‘‘fear-
less,’’ don’t be surprised if the map of 
Lithuania pops up. This small nation, 
2.6 million in population, has done 
some remarkable things in history and 
remarkable still in modern history. 
For half a century, millions lived 
under the tyranny and oppression of 
the Soviet Union. Before I was elected 
to public office, I went to visit Vilnius 
in Lithuania in 1978, and I saw Soviet 
rule firsthand. I am glad I did because 
it is such a sharp contrast to the Lith-
uania of today. 
In the late 1980s, things began to 
change, particularly in the Baltic 
States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lith-
uania. Who can forget when 2 million 
people—2 million people—joined hands 
across these three nations to form a 
420-mile Baltic Chain of Freedom in 
August of 1989. Not long thereafter, in 
February of the following year, Lith-
uania held its first free elections since 
World War II, voting for the country’s 
first post-war noncommunist govern-
ment. Immediately thereafter, the new 
Parliament voted to make Lithuania 
the first occupied Soviet republic to 
declare independence. Lithuania’s bold 
move was followed later that year by 
Latvia and Estonia. 
These brave efforts culminated a 
year later in February of 1991 when the 
Lithuanian people voted for independ-
ence. Those brave Lithuanians 30 years 
ago, including my friend, music pro-
fessor, and national leader Vytautas 
Landsbergis, led that country back to 
democracy. 
That Lithuanian effort three decades 
ago is still alive today. As a vibrant 
and vital member of the European 
Union and NATO, this small and brave 
nation is standing firm against re-
newed Russian aggression and now Chi-
nese economic intimidation and de-
fending heroic efforts to end tyranny in 
Belarus. It is one of the most vocal 
countries on Earth in defending demo-
cratic values and norms. Is it because 
they have a nuclear stockpile? No. A 
massive army? No. They are just deter-
mined, principled people who are cou-
rageous. 
Some years ago, I visited the Lithua-
nian town of Rukla, where U.S. and 
German forces were rotating through 
as part of the European Reassurance 
Initiative aimed at keeping the Baltic 
safe from Russian aggression. There 
was good reason for it. They knew they 
had to take seriously what Putin 
might do against them. 
Russia, under Vladimir Putin, has 
undertaken regular military, cyber, 
and political efforts to destabilize 
Lithuania and the Baltic States, but 
Lithuania will not be bullied. And I am 
glad that in the just-passed National 
Defense Authorization Act, we re-
affirmed our commitment to Baltic se-
curity in the amendment that I offered. 
Lithuania 
is 
also 
standing 
firm 
against the giant nation of China, 
which is trying to cut off supplies and 
punish the Lithuanian economy simply 
because the Lithuanians have estab-
lished trade ties with Taiwan. Yet 
again, Lithuania will not be bullied. 
On Lithuania’s immediate border, 
there is a heroic struggle to end the 
last dictator in Europe, Lukashenko in 
Belarus. Most of us remember last year 
when 
this 
Belarusian 
dictator, 
Lukashenko, once again, after the 
bogus election results were announced, 
proceeded to jail those who had the te-
merity to run against him in the elec-
tion. That has become normal with 
this man. This dictator, if somebody 
shows the nerve to run against him, 
will announce that he has beaten them 
by 80 percent-plus and then put them 
in jail. 
When popular social media person-
ality Sergei Tikhanovsky found him-
self arbitrarily jailed, his wife Svetlana 
Tikhanovskaya courageously stepped 
in to run in his place. She probably 
won 
that 
election, 
but 
of 
course 
Lukashenko would never allow those 
results to be announced. So what did 
she do after the election, her husband 
in jail? She fled Belarus. Where did she 
go for safety for herself and her chil-
dren? 
Lithuania. 
Not 
surprisingly, 
Lithuania. She found a welcoming na-
tion next door, and she continues her 
struggle for a free and democratic 
Belarus out of Vilnius, Lithuania. 
Belarus and Russia have retaliated 
against Lithuania with cruel and man-
ufactured migrant flows and other in-
timidation, but once again, Lithuania 
will not be bullied. 
Secretary of State Blinken under-
stands the importance of this Lithua-
nian nation and continues to make 
sure they know they have friends in 
the United States. He recently hosted 
Lithuanian 
Foreign 
Minister 
and 
grandson of Vytautas Landsbergis at 
the State Department and then trav-
eled to the Baltic States to reaffirm 
American solidarity. 
Blinken said clearly at the State De-
partment 
that 
Foreign 
Minister 
Landsbergis ‘‘has been such a strong 
voice for democracy and human rights 
not just in Lithuania, but around the 
world.’’ 
I 
couldn’t 
agree 
more. 
I 
couldn’t be more proud. 
So let’s use this 30th anniversary of 
Lithuanian independence to stand firm 
with our brave ally and recommit to 
our continued support for our Baltic al-
lies through economic and security co-
operation. Doing so will help ensure

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9223 
December 16, 2021 
the next 30 years of the longstanding 
U.S.-Baltic 
friendship 
are 
equally 
strong and fruitful. 
In early 2011, a trip through these 
same Baltic countries gave me one 
more extraordinary experience in my 
Senate career. I went on a road trip 
from the free, democratic Lithuania 
back in time to the closed, totalitarian 
nation of Belarus. Crossing over that 
border was like driving onto a Holly-
wood movie set. I looked along the 
roads for telephone poles or evidence of 
electricity and found none. It looked 
like a bucolic, rural village, mile after 
mile after mile, indicating how eco-
nomic development has still yet to ar-
rive in Belarus. 
You see, this last dictatorship of Eu-
rope held a Presidential election in De-
cember 2010, and I wanted to be there 
in 2011 to meet with the families of 
those who had the temerity to run 
against Lukashenko and were in jail. 
So I drove from Vilnius to Minsk to 
meet with those family members. They 
had been arrested by the security serv-
ices of Belarus, which are still called 
the KGB. 
It was a sobering meeting. Many 
tears were shed. Fortunately, over 
time, by working at it doggedly, we 
eventually saw the release of all the 
brave Belarusians who had been jailed 
at that time. 
Yet, tragically, the Belarusian people 
found themselves in the same out-
rageous 
situation 
last 
year 
when 
Lukashenko jailed these candidates 
with the courage to run, including 
Sergei Tikhanovsky. 
Some of you may have read the out-
standing 
profile 
about 
his 
wife, 
Svetlana, in this month’s New Yorker. 
It is entitled ‘‘The Accidental Revolu-
tionary Leading Belarus’s Uprising.’’ It 
describes how her campaign speeches 
galvanized boisterous crowds. She had 
a 
very 
simple 
message 
to 
the 
Belarusian people and the courage to 
say it. She said she was ‘‘fed up with 
living in humiliation and fear’’ in 
Belarus. Lukashenko, this mighty dic-
tator, didn’t even have the courage to 
debate this woman. 
She likely won that election, as we 
know, but we will never know the offi-
cial 
outcome 
because 
Lukashenko 
wouldn’t allow it. 
I was proud to host her last year with 
my Senate colleagues Senator SHAHEEN 
and SULLIVAN. And I am glad to see 
that President Biden met with her as 
well. 
She is a brave woman, soldiering on, 
despite the fact that the Belarusians 
announced just a week ago that her 
husband has now been sentenced to 18 
years in prison. 
Tragically, since Lukashenko stole 
that most recent election, he has con-
tinued to double down on his out-
rageous behavior, including forcing 
down a commercial airline in May to 
arrest the Belarusian activists and just 
this week, after months of closed hear-
ings, that 18-year prison sentence for 
her husband. 
Five other defendants, including an-
other Presidential candidate and a 
journalist from Radio Free Europe, re-
ceived an equally outrageous sentence 
from Lukashenko. What a waste; what 
an outright theft of the Belarusian peo-
ple’s future. 
These people must be freed, and we 
must 
continue 
to 
support 
Ms. 
Tikhanovskaya’s effort, and her hus-
band, and the thousands upon thou-
sands who peacefully protest on her be-
half. 
LITHUANIA 
Madam President, this morning I was 
listening to the news, as I came in, on 
National Public Radio. And I will close 
by just noting that the most recent re-
port led me to make this statement on 
the floor today. 
It seems that the Lithuanians have 
been compelled to close their Embassy 
in Beijing. The Chinese Government 
will no longer promise the most basic 
tenet of ambassadorial representation: 
diplomatic immunity. They are still 
angry because this little country of 2.6 
million people is establishing trade re-
lations with Taiwan. 
The Chinese have said they are cut-
ting off all exports and imports to 
Lithuania, putting pressure on them 
for their political courage. It won’t 
work, I might say, to Prime Minister 
Xi. These people are not going to be 
bullied or pushed around. They have 
shown an extraordinary amount of 
courage. And I hope all of the world, 
particularly their great allies here in 
the United States, understand that 
these Baltic States—and my mother’s 
country of Lithuania—are standing up 
for values which we all treasure as 
Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ECONOMY 
Mr. 
THUNE. 
Madam 
President, 
Democrats’ push to pass their tax-and- 
spending spree continues to throw into 
sharp relief the difference between Re-
publicans’ and Democrats’ vision of 
government. And it is about a lot more 
than just the amount of money we 
want to spend. Of course, the amount 
of money we are spending matters, but 
it is also about what that money rep-
resents. 
In general, more money means more 
government. And more government 
usually means less freedom. Repub-
licans don’t oppose Democrats’ tax- 
and-spending spree just because it 
would cost a lot of money or drive up 
our national debt. 
It would do both of those things, of 
course, with negative consequences for 
our economy and the prosperity of 
American families. And the negative 
economic consequences alone are suffi-
cient reason to oppose Democrats’ 
‘‘Build Back Bankrupt’’ plan. But it is 
a lot more than just about excessive 
spending. 
With their ‘‘Build Back Bankrupt’’ 
plan, Democrats envision a society 
which government is intimately in-
volved in nearly every aspect of Ameri-
cans’ life—from, to quote a New York 
Times article, ‘‘cradle to grave.’’ And 
that is not a vision Republicans share, 
primarily because a government that is 
intimately involved in nearly every as-
pect of your life is a government that 
is going to exert control over your life. 
More government inevitably means 
more government control. 
Take Democrats’ childcare plan in 
their Build Back Better legislation. To 
hear Democrats talk about it, you 
might think this plan involves nothing 
more than cutting checks to American 
parents to help with their childcare 
bills, but that is not the case. 
First, of course, Democrats take the 
opportunity to add a lot of new 
childcare mandates and regulations. 
According to one estimate, Democrats’ 
childcare subsidy measure could drive 
up the cost of daycare by somewhere 
around $13,000 per child. Good luck 
working that into your family budget. 
Democrats’ government subsidy pro-
gram is set up to favor certain kinds of 
childcare and childcare providers. It is 
set up to favor institutional childcare, 
rather than home care or other models 
like neighborhood co-ops, and it is set 
up to place religious providers at a dis-
advantage. 
That is right. Despite the fact that a 
majority of working families who use 
center-based care opt for faith-based 
centers, Democrats’ program is set up 
to put these providers at a disadvan-
tage. It denies them facilities funding 
that is granted to secular providers. 
And it would disqualify—I should 
say, it could disqualify many providers 
with traditional religious beliefs like 
those shared by millions upon millions 
of Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and 
Muslim families around the country. 
It could even disqualify a provider 
simply 
because 
the 
provider 
gave 
placement preference to families of its 
own faith. So if you are a Catholic 
Church with a childcare program and 
you give preference to families who at-
tend your church, you could be accused 
of discrimination and disqualified from 
receiving government subsidies. 
And if you are a parent who can’t af-
ford that program without those gov-
ernment subsidies—thanks to govern-
ment mandates and regulations that 
have hiked up the childcare bill—you 
are out of luck. If you need those gov-
ernment subsidies, you will have to 
send your child to one of the providers 
the government prefers. 
The childcare program in the Demo-
crats’ tax-and-spending spree provides 
a perfect example of what happens 
when government gets involved. And it 
is about a lot more than how much 
money the government is spending.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9224 
December 16, 2021 
With government money comes gov-
ernment control. The decision is no 
longer just in the individual’s hands. 
And the more substantial the govern-
ment involvement, the larger the gov-
ernment’s role in decision making is 
likely to be—whether the issue is 
childcare, healthcare, education, or 
anything else. 
In his 1967 inaugural address as Gov-
ernor of California, Ronald Reagan 
said: 
Freedom is a fragile thing and it’s never 
more than one generation away from extinc-
tion. It is not ours by way of inheritance; it 
must be fought for and defended constantly 
by each generation, for it comes only once to 
a people. 
Freedom is a fragile thing. 
Here in the United States, we have 
enjoyed an unprecedented degree of in-
dividual liberty—a liberty that it is 
very easy for us to take for granted. 
But that liberty is not guaranteed. It is 
something that must be fought for and 
protected. 
And that doesn’t involve simply safe-
guarding our liberty from external 
threats from foreign powers; it involves 
ensuring making sure that our govern-
ment doesn’t start to exceed its proper 
role. 
The loss of freedom can come dra-
matically or it can come quietly 
through a steady increase of govern-
ment encroachment. 
And it is important to remember 
that freedom can be eroded or taken 
away by the well-meaning, and not just 
those who are actively hostile to it. 
I believe that my Democrat col-
leagues likely do not see their ideas for 
dramatic 
government 
expansion 
as 
threatening Americans’ personal free-
dom. The problem is that when you ex-
pand the reach of government, the di-
minishment of liberty is inevitable. 
Expand the reach of government into 
Americans’ lives, and it is inevitable 
that you are going to transfer some of 
Americans’ 
decision-making 
power 
over to politicians and bureaucrats in 
Washington. 
Democrats’ tax-and-spending spree— 
and its major expansion of govern-
ment—is far from the only threat to 
Americans’ liberties that we are seeing 
from the Democratic Party. 
I am increasingly disturbed by Demo-
crats’ tendency to play fast and loose 
with religious liberty and the First 
Amendment—whether 
that 
involves 
disadvantaging religious childcare pro-
viders, threatening individuals’ right 
to live according to their conscience, 
questioning judges’ fitness for office 
based on religious belief, or, as we 
learned recently from a courageous 
whistleblower FBI agent, even opening 
the door for the FBI to collect informa-
tion on parents voicing their opposi-
tion to local school policies during 
school board meetings. 
I am also disturbed by Democrats’ 
clear belief that Americans should 
defer to government and Democrat-ap-
proved experts, as spectacularly evi-
denced in the Virginia Governor’s race, 
which 
was 
unquestionably 
decided 
based partly on the Democrat can-
didate’s repeatedly expressed belief 
that parents shouldn’t be involved in 
the content of their children’s edu-
cation. 
I am puzzled as to why Democrats 
are so convinced—so convinced—that 
Washington 
elites 
or 
Democrat-ap-
proved experts are better at making de-
cisions than ordinary Americans. 
As Ronald Reagan said in that same 
speech: 
[I]t’s hard to explain those among us who 
even today would question the people’s ca-
pacity for self-government. I’ve often won-
dered if they will answer, those who sub-
scribe to that philosophy: if no one among us 
is capable of governing himself, then who 
among us has the capacity to govern some-
one else? 
I believe that the American people 
are capable of governing themselves— 
of making their own decisions—and 
that they are actually generally going 
to be better at it than a bunch of bu-
reaucrats in Washington. 
And I strongly oppose efforts to sub-
stitute the judgments of Washington 
bureaucrats—or Democrat politicians— 
for the judgment of individual Ameri-
cans. 
It states in the Declaration of Inde-
pendence that governments are insti-
tuted 
to 
preserve 
our 
unalienable 
rights, including the rights to life, lib-
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
Preserving liberty is a fundamental 
purpose of government, but, of course, 
before you can enjoy liberty, you have 
to enjoy the right to life. For a long 
time now, the Democratic Party has 
consistently denied the right to life to 
a whole segment of the American popu-
lation: unborn Americans. 
There is no better example of their 
aggressive 
pro-abortion 
extremism 
than the so-called Women’s Health 
Protection Act the Democrats in the 
House passed in September. This legis-
lation, which would more accurately be 
termed the ‘‘Abortion on Demand 
Act,’’ would eliminate almost every 
democratically passed State abortion 
restriction, no matter how mild. It 
would endanger the religious and con-
science rights of doctors and nurses, 
and, of course, it ignores the clear posi-
tion of the American people, a strong 
majority of whom support restrictions 
on abortion. 
Apparently, Democrats are not con-
tent with joining repressive regimes 
like China and North Korea as one of a 
tiny handful of nations that allow elec-
tive abortion past 20 weeks of preg-
nancy. No, they want to remove even 
the mildest and most widely supported 
restrictions on abortion. That is yet 
another example of Democrats’ tend-
ency to think they know better than 
the American people. 
The Republican vision—the conserv-
ative vision, the vision that I share—is 
a vision that foregrounds liberty, not 
government; that believes individuals 
acting freely generally tend to do a 
better job of making decisions than a 
small handful of politicians and bu-
reaucrats in Washington. 
We believe in government as a back-
stop, not Big Brother. A system of per-
manent government dependence erodes 
individual liberty, to say nothing of 
the ways in which it undermines pros-
perity, robs individuals of the purpose 
and pride that comes with work and 
achievement. 
Government should create the condi-
tions in which freedom, opportunity, 
and prosperity can flourish, not at-
tempt to secure particular outcomes or 
to dictate the paths that Americans 
should take. 
We are privileged to live in the freest 
country the world has ever known. It is 
not a privilege we can or should take 
for granted, and it is a privilege that 
we can all too easily lose. Our liberty 
is, as Ronald Reagan said, ever only 
one generation away from extinction. 
I will continue to make safeguarding 
that liberty that we have been given 
one of my most cherished priorities, 
whether that involves fighting for the 
right to life of unborn Americans, op-
posing attempts to restrict religious 
liberty, or fighting against an expan-
sion of government that would push 
out parents and put the government in 
the driver’s seat on way too many 
issues. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
BALDWIN). The senior Senator from 
Maryland. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, on 
March 3 of this year, over 9 months 
ago, 
President 
Biden 
nominated 
Dilawar Syed to be the Deputy Admin-
istrator of the Small Business Admin-
istration. 
Mr. Syed has spent decades building 
and scaling successful businesses, as 
well as advocating for struggling entre-
preneurs and small business owners in 
underserved areas. It is clear that he is 
eminently qualified to help lead the 
SBA at a time when the Agency is pro-
viding 
unprecedented 
assistance 
to 
help small businesses survive and re-
cover from the ongoing COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Last April, during Mr. Syed’s hearing 
before the Senate Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Committee, my Re-
publican colleagues raised concerns 
about PPP and EIDL loans received by 
Lumiata, the company for which Mr. 
Syed served as CEO. As chairman of 
the committee, I gave a commitment 
to work in a bipartisan manner to se-
cure additional information from the 
SBA about these loans. 
I kept my word. On June 8, the SBA 
made materials on the loans available 
for my review, for the ranking mem-
ber’s review, and for the review of 
every Member of the committee. The 
materials proved that there was abso-
lutely nothing irregular about these 
loans. In fact, the company did the 
right thing and repaid the forgivable 
PPP loan after its lenders determined

December 16, 2021 
that the company did not require that 
level of government assistance. You 
wish more companies would have fol-
lowed the lead that this company did. 
But then, a week later, a new issue 
arose. Republican Members accused 
Mr. Syed of having anti-Israel bias be-
cause of his involvement with Emgage, 
a nonprofit organization that supports 
the Muslim American community. This 
accusation was completely unfounded. 
As the American Jewish Committee 
wrote: 
The unsupported accusation that somehow 
Jewish businesses or those with ties to Israel 
may not fare as well under Mr. Syed’s leader-
ship in the Small Business Administration 
(SBA) has no factual grounding. Indeed, he 
has specifically disavowed support for the 
boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) 
movement, which seeks the dissolution of 
Israel. 
The AJC went on to say that Repub-
lican accusations against Mr. Syed 
were ‘‘un-American.’’ 
Two weeks later, after the AJC re-
leased its statements, Republicans on 
the committee concocted yet another 
reason to block Mr. Syed’s nomination. 
This time it was Planned Parenthood. 
Committee 
Republicans 
announced 
that they would boycott all votes on 
the nomination because Planned Par-
enthood affiliates received loans under 
the Paycheck Protection Program, de-
spite the fact that these loans were 
made during the Trump administration 
and had nothing to do with Mr. Syed. 
In response to Republican demands, 
on 
November 
24, 
Administrator 
Guzman sent the committee a detailed 
four-page response that gave a full ex-
planation of SBA’s policy on providing 
PPP loans to nonprofits, including 
Planned Parenthood. The SBA provided 
the specific data on the number of 
loans to Planned Parenthood affiliates, 
as well as the total dollars loaned and 
forgiven. The Administrator’s letter 
makes clear that the SBA is imple-
menting 
affiliation 
standards 
for 
Planned Parenthood in the same man-
ner it is implementing the affiliation 
standards for other nonprofits such as 
United Way, Boys and Girls Clubs, Girl 
Scouts, Boy Scouts, and Goodwill. 
Then there was another request for 
information and, once again, the SBA 
sent another detailed letter to our 
committee to the ranking member, 
Senator RAND PAUL, dated December 
15, 2021. That letter spells out the spe-
cifics on every loan given out by the 
SBA—again, under the Trump adminis-
tration, initially—to the Planned Par-
enthood affiliates: the numbers that 
apply for PPP; the numbers that with-
drew those applications; the total dol-
lar amounts; the loans that were for-
given under the original PPP amount 
and the total dollar amounts; the 
amount of PPP No. 2 loans given out 
requested by Planned Parenthood; the 
number that were withdrawn; the dol-
lar amount that was given out; the dol-
lar amount that has been forgiven. All 
that has been made available to our 
committee by the Small Business Ad-
ministration. 
Quite frankly, I don’t know what else 
we can do. The SBA is required to 
carry out the laws that Congress 
passed. We made it clear we wanted 
nonprofits eligible for the help under 
the small business loan programs that 
we created. We made it clear that the 
affiliation rules would be applied, and 
the affiliation rules were applied the 
same way they were applied to all non-
profits that have a national affiliation. 
And the initial determination made 
under the Trump administration was 
reviewed under the Biden administra-
tion to make sure that those affiliate 
rules were applied and they were ap-
plied fairly to all nonprofits. 
Thanks to the hard work of the SBA 
personnel, tens of millions of small 
businesses and nonprofits have received 
Federal assistance to keep their doors 
open and their employees on staff. The 
SBA has provided relief through mul-
tiple rounds of the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, EIDL loan program, tar-
geted grant programs, the Shuttered 
Venue Operators Grant Program, and 
the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. 
Unfortunately, the SBA has had to 
implement these programs without the 
benefit of a Deputy Administrator, the 
person whose job it is to oversee the 
day-to-day operations of the Agency, 
and it gives us an opportunity to have 
a confirmed person at the SBA who is 
answerable to Congress and the Amer-
ican people. 
Many nonpartisan, small business or-
ganizations support the nomination of 
Mr. Syed, including the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce, the Small Business In-
vestor Alliance, and the Small Busi-
ness Entrepreneurship Council. I could 
read into the record numerous rec-
ommendation letters from the whole 
gambit of the stakeholder community. 
In April, the Chamber of Commerce 
wrote to the committee stating: 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce supports 
the nomination of Dilawar Syed to be Dep-
uty Administrator of the U.S. Small Busi-
ness Administration (SBA). We believe that 
it is essential for SBA’s senior leadership 
team to be in place to deliver on the agen-
cy’s COVID–19 small business emergency re-
lief responsibilities and we believe Mr. Syed 
is well qualified for this position. 
I agree. That is why, again, I am 
going to ask that the nomination be 
discharged from the Small Business 
Committee and Mr. Syed receive an up- 
or-down vote on this nomination. I 
might tell you that we have had action 
in our committee. So this is not incon-
sistent with the action of our com-
mittee. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the Small Business Com-
mittee be discharged and the Senate 
proceed to the following nomination: 
PN231, Dilawar Syed, of California, to 
be Deputy Administrator of the Small 
Business 
Administration; 
that 
the 
nomination be confirmed; that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table with no inter-
vening action or debate; that no fur-
ther motions be in order to the nomi-
nation; that any related statement be 
printed in the RECORD; and that the 
President be immediately notified of 
the Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The junior Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. Reserving the right to ob-
ject, the Hyde Amendment was passed 
in 1976. This amendment prohibits Fed-
eral funds from going directly to pay 
for abortion. For 40-some-odd years, 
this has had some effect on trying to 
prevent money directly going from the 
taxpayer to fund abortion. 
The reason for this amendment was 
that many people have profound reli-
gious beliefs that their money, their 
taxpayer dollars, shouldn’t go to kill 
the unborn. This is a big deal, the Hyde 
Amendment. 
Right now, currently, appropriations 
for the last 40 years have always had 
Hyde Amendment protections. But now 
we discover, under duress, the Small 
Business Administration admits that 
$100 million has been given to Planned 
Parenthood without Hyde protections. 
So this $100 million, which is essen-
tially about one-third of what they get 
every year from the Federal Govern-
ment, has no Hyde prescriptions, no 
Hyde restrictions, and this money can 
go directly to those performing abor-
tions. So the abortionist that does 
thousands of abortions each year is 
getting money directly from the Fed-
eral Government to pay his or her sal-
ary. This is a first in 40 years, and it is 
not a small matter. 
This is an extraordinary thing that 
the Federal Government, for the first 
time in 40-some-odd years, is directly 
paying for abortions. This shouldn’t 
happen. 
This is worth a debate, and we only 
discovered this because of holding up a 
nominee to try to get information. The 
Small Business Administration has 
steadfastly hidden this information, 
tried not to reveal it and is slowly, lit-
tle by little, giving some, which they 
gave yesterday a little bit more, but 
they have been resisting and resisting 
and resisting. 
The Small Business Administration 
originally ruled that Planned Parent-
hood was a big business—an extraor-
dinarily big business, a business with 
16,000 
people. 
Planned 
Parenthood 
themselves 
calls 
them 
‘‘affiliates.’’ 
They count their income all together. 
They pool their income and put out 
documents saying this is how much we 
have all together. 
Thirty-eight of these Planned Par-
enthoods were sent a notice saying: 
You 
have 
illegally 
obtained 
this 
money. You are not a small business, 
and you should return it. 
Supposedly, these entities then pro-
tested and appealed the process. 
The Small Business Administration, 
after months and months and months, 
still refuses to reveal the appeals proc-
ess or what the complaints were. We 
have not gotten those documents, al-
though we asked repeatedly for these 
documents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9226 
December 16, 2021 
This nomination does directly have 
to do with this because, whoever is in 
charge of PPP, you would want some-
one to be an honest broker who says: 
By golly, this looks suspicious. How 
come this information is not being re-
vealed to Congress? How come Con-
gress is not allowed to see this? 
The Small Business Administration 
will say it is confidential. That does 
not apply to Congress’s oversight. That 
might apply to releasing it to the pub-
lic, 
but 
that 
doesn’t 
apply 
to 
Congress’s oversight of the Small Busi-
ness Administration. 
This is an extraordinary thing that 
has happened—$100 million given di-
rectly to pay for people to do abor-
tions. It is outside the scope and con-
trary to the scope of the Hyde Amend-
ment, and it is something worth having 
a significant and prolonged and pro-
tracted battle until all the documents 
are revealed. 
Madam President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The senior Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. I certainly regret that 
an objection has been made, but let me 
at 
least 
correct 
the 
record. 
PPP 
money, Paycheck Protection money, 
does not go to healthcare services. It 
goes to personnel costs. It goes to re-
lated expenses. It does not go to 
healthcare services. 
The law that we pass is the law that 
the 
administration 
implemented. 
There were no restrictions referenced 
to what Senator PAUL is referring to 
included in the Paycheck Protection 
Program. The restrictions on a non-
profit 
dealt 
with 
affiliation 
rules. 
Those affiliation rules were applied to 
Planned Parenthood as they were ap-
plied to similar organizations that I al-
ready put into the RECORD. 
What Senator PAUL is complaining 
about could have been taken up during 
the debate of the Paycheck Protection 
Program, but it was not. 
The bill was passed with Republican 
majorities in this body and with Presi-
dent Trump signing it into law. It 
would have been against the will of 
Congress for the Trump administration 
under the SBA or under the Biden ad-
ministration under the SBA to use its 
own judgment and not the judgment of 
the policymaking branch of govern-
ment—the legislative branch of govern-
ment. 
So I just want to put on the record 
that the response by Senator PAUL is 
not the factual circumstances that we 
are dealing with. We are dealing with a 
qualified person who should be con-
firmed by this body, and the adminis-
tration is carrying out the will of Con-
gress in the way that it has imple-
mented the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, the 
eyes of the world are on Russia as it 
stages a military buildup on the 
Ukrainian border. Russia could lit-
erally invade Ukraine at any time. And 
the United States and the inter-
national community need to take 
strong, decisive action to dissuade a 
Russian 
offensive 
from 
invading 
Ukraine. I was glad to see the Sec-
retary General of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, NATO, denounce 
Russia’s 
action 
earlier 
today, 
but 
clearly words are not enough. State-
ments of support are not enough to 
counter an invasion. The United States 
and our NATO allies must provide addi-
tional support to Ukraine as they de-
fend their borders, and time is of the 
essence. 
Senator DURBIN, the Senator from Il-
linois, and I have introduced a resolu-
tion to provide complete clarity on the 
U.S. Senate’s position on this immi-
nent conflict. Our resolution affirms 
the unwavering support of the United 
States for a secure, democratic, and 
independent Ukraine, but it also as-
serts the need for action. Our resolu-
tion calls on the Biden administration 
to provide additional lethal aid to 
Ukraine to counter ongoing Russian 
aggression. 
Senator DURBIN
and I have been 
proud to notch a long list of bipartisan 
cosponsors, and I hope the Senate will 
pass this resolution before we break at 
the end of the year. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, the first year of the Biden Presi-
dency and the Democratic-majority 
controlled Congress is quickly coming 
to an end. Looking at everything that 
has happened so far this year, it is 
tough to imagine the American people 
are happy with how things are going. 
President Biden raised all of our 
hopes and expectations during his inau-
guration, as he built his campaign and 
then spoke at his inauguration on a 
simple theme: unity. He talked about 
the need for people across the country 
to come together and empathize with 
one another and to work together. He 
promised to be a uniting force in Wash-
ington, DC, and pointed to his service 
in the U.S. Senate as evidence of his 
ability to work across the aisle to 
broker bipartisan deals. 
Clearly, this message was welcomed 
by the American people. After all, they 
gave him the job in the first place. But 
just because voters picked a Demo-
cratic President doesn’t mean they 
signed off on a radical transformation 
of our country. The American people 
elected a 50–50 Senate and lessened the 
Democratic majority in the House. 
In short, Americans selected a Presi-
dent who promised to work across the 
aisle and a closely divided Congress— 
and gave us a closely divided Congress 
to ensure that he kept his word, but 
the American people have not gotten 
what they expected. 
Right from the start, there were 
clear signs of where things were head-
ed. At the beginning of the year, the 
two party leaders negotiated an orga-
nizing statement to determine how the 
50–50 Senate would function. In light of 
the far-left’s newfound obsession with 
eliminating 
the 
filibuster, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL asked for assurances from 
Leader SCHUMER
that the filibuster 
would remain intact. After all, it is not 
unreasonable to ask your negotiating 
partner to commit to not breaking the 
rules. 
Even though Senator SCHUMER once 
said we should ‘‘build a firewall around 
the legislative filibuster,’’ he refused 
to agree to leave it alone, which was 
not very encouraging. Fortunately, 
two of our Democratic colleagues have 
committed to protect the filibuster, 
which ensures that there will be some-
thing that maybe is a little unnatural 
for human nature—to try to force us to 
work together to build consensus to do 
things like we did yesterday: pass the 
National Defense Authorization Act. 
That is not necessarily our first in-
stinct. 
But protecting the filibuster is im-
portant. It provides stability and con-
tinuity and predictability in our Na-
tion’s laws and to make sure that we 
don’t add to the chaos by, every 2 
years, after every election, reversing 
everything that had been done the pre-
vious 2 years. 
We saw how tempted our Democratic 
colleagues were to use their newfound 
powers in the majority. That meant, 
unfortunately, forget working across 
the aisle or striking bipartisan deals— 
Senator SCHUMER made clear he want-
ed an easy path for purely partisan leg-
islation. 
The first item on his agenda was a $2 
trillion 
liberal 
wish 
list 
uncon-
vincingly disguised as pandemic relief. 
It included things like backdoor fund-
ing for Planned Parenthood, a blank 
check for mismanaged union pension 
systems, and money for climate jus-
tice. This had very, very little to do 
with COVID–19 and the pandemic, 
which is how it was sold. 
The Democratic leader got a taste of 
partisan legislating and decided that 
he wanted more of it, so he tried to 
break the two Democratic Members on 
his side of the aisle who were pro-
tecting bipartisanship and consensus 
building. He lined up votes on some of 
our 
colleagues’ 
most 
controversial 
bills, all of which were designed to fail. 
There was a bill that exploited the 
cause of pay fairness to line the pock-
ets of trial lawyers. Unsurprisingly, it 
did not pass. 
Senator SCHUMER forecasted votes on 
two bills that were so unpopular among 
Democrats that they didn’t even make 
it to the Senate floor. One was to erode 
the American people’s Second Amend-
ment rights, and another would punish

schools and hospitals that refused to 
comply with ‘‘woke’’ social norms. 
But without a doubt, the most dan-
gerous 
legislation 
Democrats 
have 
pushed is to overhaul America’s elec-
tion system. The version of the bill we 
voted on this summer was so bad that 
I was surprised Democrats even had the 
gall to hold a vote on it. 
The bill would have turned the bipar-
tisan Federal Election Commission 
into a Democratic-controlled, partisan 
body. It would have seized States’ con-
stitutional authority to draw their own 
congressional districts, instead hand-
ing all the power to independent redis-
tricting commissions. It would have 
federalized ballot harvesting—literally 
vacuuming up ballots and delivering 
them to a paid campaign staffer and 
political operatives who had a stake in 
the outcome of the election. The only 
thing it would have done for the people 
is decide the outcome of virtually 
every 
future 
election 
and—spoiler 
alert—make 
sure 
that 
Democrats 
would never lose. 
If this bill weren’t so dangerous, it 
would have been laughable. It is no sur-
prise that the only bipartisan thing 
about this bill was the opposition. In 
both the House and the Senate, Repub-
licans and Democrats joined together 
to defeat this bill. 
Still, our Democratic colleagues re-
fused to throw in the towel. They re-
wrote the bill, tried to rebrand it, and 
brought it up for another vote in Octo-
ber. Once again, it failed. The Demo-
cratic leader has said this partisan leg-
islation will resurface again sometime 
before the end of next year, but I don’t 
expect the outcome to change. 
Of course, amid all the partisan jock-
eying, there has been a large, dark 
cloud looming overhead known as the 
Build Back Better—or, rather, I think 
more accurately, ‘‘Build Back Bank-
rupt’’—bill. 
This 
legislation 
would 
drive up the cost of childcare for fami-
lies and cut healthcare for the unin-
sured. It would hurt our energy secu-
rity and increase the already sky-high 
energy costs. It would put taxpayers on 
the hook for massive handouts to blue 
State millionaires, organized labor, 
trial lawyers, wealthy media corpora-
tions, and a host of powerful friends of 
the Democratic Party. 
Our Democratic colleagues have used 
every trick in the book to make the 
price of this spending spree look as 
small as possible. One of our Demo-
cratic colleagues even acknowledged 
the disingenuous advertising. 
Fortunately, the Congressional Budg-
et Office and the Joint Tax Committee 
have provided an honest score of the 
bill that passed the House and that has 
been proposed here in the Senate—one 
which ignores the gimmicks our col-
leagues initially tried to use. The Con-
gressional Budget Office says that this 
bill would cost $4.9 trillion in the first 
10 years alone—not zero, as President 
Biden has disingenuously claimed; not 
$1.75 trillion, as our Democratic col-
leagues have claimed; but $4.9 trillion, 
nearly triple the price Democrats have 
previously been willing to acknowl-
edge. And deficits—money that would 
have to be repaid by the next genera-
tion and beyond—would increase by a 
staggering $3 trillion over the next dec-
ade. 
As it turns out, spending trillions of 
dollars on unnecessary programs and 
dolling out handouts for the wealthy is 
not an easy sell. Senator SCHUMER ap-
parently can’t convince all 50 Demo-
crats to vote for the bill. 
While our colleagues have focused on 
these wholly partisan endeavors, they 
have ignored clear opportunities to 
work together in a bipartisan effort. 
For example, Members of both par-
ties agree that something must be done 
to bring down prescription drug prices 
for the American people. This was a 
major focus last Congress, and there 
are a range of bipartisan bills that sup-
port this goal, including one I have in-
troduced with Senator BLUMENTHAL 
from Connecticut. So far, we have 
made no progress for the American 
people on high prescription drug costs. 
Then there is the crisis at the border. 
On President Biden’s watch, annual 
border apprehensions have hit an all-
time high. For most of the year, 
though, Democrats refused to acknowl-
edge that any sort of problem actually 
existed at the southern border. They 
adopted the same rules as ‘‘Fight 
Club’’—they just didn’t talk about it. 
Vice President HARRIS, named ‘‘border 
czar’’ by President Biden, didn’t even 
visit the border until late last June, 
long after the humanitarian crisis had 
ballooned to unimaginable heights, and 
even then, she stayed away from the 
hardest hit sectors. 
Senator SINEMA, a Democrat from 
Arizona, and I have introduced legisla-
tion with commonsense reforms to ad-
dress the crisis, but the chairman of 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
Senator 
DURBIN, has declined to mark up the 
bill or even convene a hearing of the 
Judiciary Committee to investigate 
the border crisis and explore possible 
responses to it. 
Democrats 
and 
Republicans 
have 
shown a willingness to work together 
to put DACA recipients on a strong 
legal footing. These are young people 
known as Dreamers but frequently re-
ferred to as DACA, deferred action on 
childhood arrival, which is the name of 
the administrative process used by the 
Obama administration to provide them 
some legal standing in which to stay in 
the country. But they have been em-
broiled in 10 years of unnecessary liti-
gation, and they are uncertain about 
the outcome of their case. I think this 
is an area where we could work to-
gether to provide them some certainty 
and some finality. 
There are other things we could and 
should be doing, like securing our most 
critical supply chains, encouraging in-
novation in the energy sector, and 
solving many of the challenges Amer-
ican families are facing every day. But 
rather than work across the aisle to 
address these bipartisan priorities, our 
colleagues have wasted a year on pure-
ly partisan exercises. Again, this is not 
what the American people thought 
they were getting when they elected 
Joe Biden President and when they 
gave the Senate a 50–50 split. 
The 2020 election wasn’t an invita-
tion to codify a liberal wish list; it was 
a call to work together. And there is no 
better place for the work that can be 
done than in the U.S. Senate. There is 
a lot we can and should accomplish 
next year, but this sort of partisan, 
unilateral approach to governing has 
made that nearly impossible. You can 
only hope for better next year. 
Our colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle got what they wanted, which 
was a Democratic majority, given the 
tie-breaking vote of the Vice Presi-
dent. They have been given the keys to 
the kingdom, and now, next year, we 
will see how long they can hold on to 
them, or perhaps they can change 
course and return to bipartisan legis-
lating and consensus building for the 
benefit of the American people. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CRIME 
Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the rising crime in America and spe-
cifically in Democrat-run cities. 
This year, 12 American cities have al-
ready broken records for murder, and 
the year isn’t even over. Every one of 
those cities is run by Democrats. 
Last summer, Democrat cities adopt-
ed a rallying cry, and that cry was 
‘‘defund the police.’’ Joe Biden said 
America was ‘‘systemically racist.’’ He 
said police funding should be ‘‘redi-
rected.’’ NANCY
PELOSI
talked about 
‘‘shuffling 
. . . 
money 
around.’’ 
KAMALA HARRIS, our Vice President, 
said America should ‘‘reimagine public 
safety.’’ 
Well, lots of Democrat cities put 
those slogans into practice. Bill de 
Blasio, the mayor of New York City, 
cut the New York City Police Depart-
ment by $1 billion. The Los Angeles 
City Council voted to cut police fund-
ing by $150 million. San Francisco cut 
$120 million from police over 2 years. 
Nearly two dozen cities across the 
country defunded the police. Again, 
these are all cities run by liberal may-
ors and administrations. As a result, 
last year, America experienced the 
largest surge in homicide ever re-
corded. 
According to the Major Cities Chiefs 
Association, 63 of America’s 66 biggest 
cities saw at least 1 category of violent 
crime go up last year. Minneapolis cut 
police funding, and homicide nearly

doubled. New York City police funding 
and homicide went in opposite direc-
tions: The funding for police went 
down, and homicide went up by half. 
Last year’s historic increases in homi-
cides was evident. This year, homicide 
has gone up even more. The number of 
police killed in the line of duty is also 
up. 
Here in Washington, DC, President 
Biden has effectively endorsed the 
‘‘defund the police’’ movement. He did 
that by stacking his administration 
with supporters of defunding the po-
lice. 
The Secretary of Labor of the United 
States, confirmed by this Senate, cut 
funding for police when he was mayor 
of Boston. 
The No. 3 official at the Department 
of Justice, confirmed by this Senate, 
the Democrats in this Senate, testified 
that she supports ‘‘calls from Black 
Lives Matter . . . activists to decrease 
police budgets and the scope, role, and 
responsibility of police in our lives.’’ 
Joe Biden’s Secretary of the Treas-
ury called for an economics professor 
to be fired because the professor said 
he opposed defunding the police. It had 
nothing to do with what he was teach-
ing. It wasn’t because of a problem 
with his work in the classroom. But 
Janet 
Yellen 
said 
his 
comments 
against defunding the police were ‘‘ex-
tremely troubling.’’ 
She went on to say: 
It would be appropriate for the University 
of Chicago . . . to review [that professor’s] 
performance and suitability. 
Well, Janet Yellen is not known for 
being a crime expert. She is a well-con-
nected, well-known liberal. The univer-
sity bowed to Janet Yellen and put the 
professor under investigation. This is 
Janet Yellen, who was confirmed to be 
Secretary of the Treasury under Joe 
Biden. 
In October, Joe Biden was asked if 
police officers should be fired if they 
weren’t vaccinated. He didn’t hesitate. 
He immediately said: Yes, fire them. 
These are officers who have been put-
ting their lives on the frontline every 
day since day one of the pandemic. Joe 
Biden’s mantra for the police: Vac-
cinate or terminate. 
This is happening all across America. 
For example, more than 150 Massachu-
setts State Police have resigned over 
the vaccine mandate. Joe Biden would 
rather see unvaccinated police sit at 
home than let them continue doing the 
job they have done all through the pan-
demic. The last thing we need to do 
right now is reduce the number of po-
lice officers on our streets. 
Last week, Democrats in this body 
gave another promotion to an anti-po-
lice liberal. Every Democrat—every 
Democrat—in this Senate voted to con-
firm Rachael Rollins as the top pros-
ecutor in the State of Massachusetts. 
Why does this matter to anybody out-
side of Massachusetts? Well, because 
Rachael Rollins is the face of the rogue 
prosecutor movement. This is the 
movement led by George Soros and 
other powerful liberals. They have in-
vested millions of dollars in electing 
radical prosecutors. They have suc-
ceeded in major cities. We have seen it 
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and 
Philadelphia. Once these prosecutors 
get into office, they impose radical 
leftwing policies. The result has been 
chaos and carnage from coast to coast. 
As the district attorney in Boston, 
Rachael Rollins announced she would 
not prosecute 15 different crimes, laws 
on the books. She would not prosecute 
15 different crimes, including shop-
lifting, trespassing, and resisting ar-
rest. Rachael Rollins is supposed to be 
a prosecutor. Her job is to enforce the 
law. Instead, she has nullified the law. 
Joe Biden saw this lawlessness, and 
he was so impressed that he gave her a 
big promotion. Every single Democrat 
in this Senate has given her their 
stamp of approval. So has Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS. Every Republican voted 
no on this radical nominee, so the Vice 
President was needed to come to the 
Senate to break the tie. There is al-
ready talk of Rachael Rollins’ getting 
even more promotions in this very rad-
ical, extreme, dangerous, and scary 
Democratic Party. 
Mark my words: Rachael Rollins is 
the first rogue prosecutor to be given a 
Federal job. She will not be the last. 
With Democrats in charge in Wash-
ington, Rachael Rollins’ policies are 
coming to a neighborhood near you. 
So it is worth asking, how are these 
policies working out in liberal big cit-
ies? Not well, no. San Francisco fol-
lowed the Rachael Rollins model. They 
tried legalizing shoplifting; how about 
that? Now San Francisco looks like a 
city from the Dark Ages. 
Here is how the Associated Press de-
scribed it last week: 
San Francisco residents and visitors scurry 
past scenes of lawlessness and squalor. 
In August, San Francisco broke city 
records with 3,700 reports of retail 
theft. Now there is a mass exodus of re-
tail stores from San Francisco. 
Last year, twice as many people in 
San 
Francisco 
died 
from 
drug 
overdoses than from coronavirus. The 
local news reported this week about 
people leaving their cars unlocked in 
San Francisco to prevent their win-
dows from getting smashed out. Even 
the Democrat mayor spoke recently 
about the ‘‘rein of criminals who are 
destroying our city.’’ 
San Francisco is one of the wealthi-
est cities in the world. It is the home-
town of the Speaker of the House and 
is now a homicide haven on the west 
coast. Yet, in just a few years, liberal 
policies have turned what had been a 
beautiful city into a war zone. 
NANCY PELOSI, the Speaker of the 
House, admitted just yesterday that 
‘‘there is an attitude of lawlessness in 
our country’’ today. Then she added, 
‘‘It springs from,’’ as she said, ‘‘I don’t 
know where.’’ 
Well, NANCY PELOSI should look at 
her own city. It is painfully obvious. 
The fact that roars out from liberal 
city to liberal city is this: The lawless-
ness comes from the policies of the 
Democratic Party. Criminals seek op-
portunity, and when criminals see that 
opportunity, they pounce. 
Look at Los Angeles. This is another 
city with a rogue prosecutor. In just 10 
days last month, looters stole $340,000 
worth of goods from stores. In one case, 
police arrested 14 of the looters. And 
then what happened? They were all re-
leased. Now they are all walking free. 
Austin, TX, made some of the largest 
police funding cuts last year. This 
year, Austin has seen a 70-percent in-
crease in murder. It is one of the larg-
est increases in homicide in America. 
In KAMALA
HARRIS’s hometown of 
Oakland, the city council voted to 
defund the police in June. Now murder 
in Oakland, the Vice President’s home-
town, is up by two-thirds since just 
2019. 
Last month, a toddler was shot and 
killed while he slept in the back of his 
mother’s car on the Oakland freeway. 
Even leftwing Oakland has now had 
enough. The city is now planning to re-
verse the cuts to police. For the tod-
dler, it is too late. The damage that 
took that innocent life from that fam-
ily can’t be undone, can’t be repaired. 
The family will never be reunited. 
It is time for the Democrats to wake 
up, to wake up before it is too late for 
so many others. 
Democrats have controlled the Sen-
ate now for 10 months. Yet they have 
done nothing to improve law enforce-
ment in America. They have done 
nothing to reduce crime. In fact, Sen-
ate Democrats have only tried to re-
ward 
criminals. 
Forty-nine 
Senate 
Democrats sponsored a bill to give vot-
ing rights to felons as soon as they 
walk out of their jail cells. 
The American people reject this bill 
and Democrats’ entire agenda. Voters 
are speaking out. Just last month, vot-
ers rejected defunding police in the cit-
ies of Buffalo, New York, and even in 
Minneapolis. 
New York City has just elected a 
former police officer as its mayor who 
used the issue of crime and law and 
order as a winning issue in the cam-
paign. People are tired of what the 
Democrats are force-feeding the Amer-
ican people. 
The lessons should be screamingly 
obvious. The American people don’t 
want Democrats’ soft-on-crime agenda. 
Americans 
want 
safe 
communities. 
They want Democrats and all Ameri-
cans to stop coddling criminals, to 
stand for public safety, and to stop this 
reckless Democrats’ war on police. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

S9229 
December 16, 2021 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, the 
foundation of American democracy is 
built upon the sacred right to vote, and 
there is no doubt that right is under at-
tack today. 
This year alone, 550 voter suppression 
bills have been introduced in State leg-
islatures across the country. In Texas, 
it is now illegal to compensate workers 
who help voters who don’t speak 
English and for election officials to en-
courage eligible voters to apply to vote 
by mail. 
In Fulton County, GA, a county that 
historically 
votes 
Democratic, 
the 
number of ballot boxes has been re-
duced from 38 to 8. That is one ballot 
box for every 100,000 voters. 
And in Florida, ballot dropoff boxes 
can only be utilized during early voting 
hours, and boxes must be located at ei-
ther a county’s elections office or early 
voting sites. 
Before President Trump, Republicans 
at least tried to pretend their laws 
weren’t blatantly discriminatory, but 
now they aren’t even attempting to 
hide the fact that they are purposefully 
trying to make it darn near impossible 
for Black people and other people of 
color, elderly individuals, students, 
working families, and people with dis-
abilities to vote. 
The fact that Republicans continue 
to claim that these voter suppression 
tactics are necessary to protect elec-
tion integrity would be laughable if it 
weren’t so deeply dangerous to our de-
mocracy. We all know that countless 
investigations have uncovered abso-
lutely no evidence of systemic or wide-
spread voter fraud. We all know that 
the 2020 election was the most secure 
election in our country’s history. And 
we certainly all know this is not about 
voter fraud. It is about advancing a po-
litical agenda by denying large swaths 
of Americans their fundamental right 
to vote. 
If this isn’t un-American, I don’t 
know what is, which is why voter sup-
pression is the most urgent crisis fac-
ing our country today and which is 
why it is the single most pressing issue 
the Senate must address. 
Yes, we need to pass Build Back Bet-
ter, and we need to fight against at-
tacks on a woman’s right to make deci-
sions about her own body, attacks on 
the LGBTQ community, attacks on 
unions, and much more because battles 
for rights that we thought we had won 
don’t stay won. But we won’t succeed 
in preserving these hard-won rights if 
we don’t protect the right to vote. 
To quote my friend and colleague 
Senator WARNOCK, ‘‘Voting rights are 
preservative of all other rights.’’ 
We are nearing the 1-year anniver-
sary of the attack on the U.S. Capitol. 
This violent insurrection and mob vio-
lence was the direct result of blatant 
lies told by the former President and 
his supporters about systemic fraud 
and a stolen election. 
We 
are 
still 
learning 
the 
con-
sequences of what happened that day, 
but we know for certain this act of do-
mestic terrorism was an attack on free 
and fair elections in this country. Yet 
Republicans continue to spread the 
same lies about election fraud and con-
tinue to push through legislation at 
the State level to silence Americans 
across the country. 
Congress must take action to restore 
the integrity of our voting system and 
make sure every American’s voice is 
heard and counted. And we have tried. 
We have tried four times to stop these 
unconstitutional, State-level laws from 
undermining our elections. 
We have tried to pass commonsense 
reforms that would, for example, allow 
all eligible voters to vote by mail; 
make election day a Federal holiday so 
all working families can vote; and es-
tablish Federal criminal penalties for 
deceiving voters with false and mis-
leading information about voting. 
And most importantly, we have tried 
to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act, which would give 
the Department of Justice the tools to 
keep these blatant voter suppression 
laws from being enacted in the first 
place. 
Only one Republican joined us in vot-
ing for this bill—the same bill that was 
being touted as bipartisan. 
It is crystal clear by now that Repub-
licans have absolutely no interest in 
protecting the right to vote. For Re-
publicans, voter suppression and gerry-
mandering is their path to victory 
Democrats cannot sit back and allow 
a political party to maintain power by 
denying Americans their right to vote. 
I want to quote Senator WARNOCK 
again. He said: 
[A]s we cast that vote to begin addressing 
the debt ceiling, this same Chamber is allow-
ing the ceiling of our democracy to crash in 
around us. 
We figured out a way to save our 
economy; we can surely figure out a 
way to save our democracy. 
Filibuster reform is the path Demo-
crats need to take to fight back 
against the Republicans’ all-out voter 
suppression assault on our democracy. 
I call on my Democratic colleagues to 
act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
INFLATION 
Mr. 
LANKFORD. 
Mr. 
President, 
there are so many problems going on 
right now in the country. As I interact 
with people in Oklahoma, they are 
frustrated with where things are going 
with the economy. The rising inflation 
is literally inflation we have not seen 
for 40 years. 
People who are 40 years old and 
younger have never experienced an 
economy like we are experiencing right 
now. But for those who lived during the 
time of Jimmy Carter, they all remem-
ber extremely well what it was like— 
what it was like to literally every sin-
gle week when you go to the grocery 
store for prices to be higher, to be able 
to watch prices accelerate month after 
month after month. 
The policies that have been put in 
place this year by the Biden adminis-
tration and folks in this body have led 
directly to rampant inflation across 
our Nation and are causing a major 
problem. 
The debt ceiling was voted on just 
days ago here in this body. It was $21⁄2 
trillion. That $21⁄2 trillion has been set 
aside for the next 13 months or so. 
There is an enormous gathering of 
debt. We continue to be able to see the 
inflation continue to rise. And in the 
middle of it is a conversation about 
this bill that is called Build Back Bet-
ter. 
Now, we haven’t seen all the bill yet. 
It is 2,000-plus pages. But the pages 
change every week, and they have for 
weeks and weeks. We still have large 
sections of the bill that is being 
dropped out that just says: ‘‘We will 
add in more information here later.’’ 
But the sections that we do have, and 
that have been scored, there are major 
problems here. This is not just a Re-
publican-Democrat conversation; this 
is the direction-of-the-country con-
versation. Is this really what we want 
to do and the direction that we want to 
go? 
This bill—it was scored independ-
ently by CBO, looked at this bill and 
said if it looks out over 10 years with 
these policies in place, it would add $3 
trillion more in debt. 
Now, as it is written, with all the 
budget gimmicks and everything in it, 
they say: Well, it actually will only 
add $365 billion in debt—though the 
White House continues to claim that it 
is all paid for; it is all paid for; it is 
free; it is free; it is free. 
The more we dig into it, the more 
problems we see. Some of those are 
philosophical 
changes. 
This 
bill 
changes what has been entitlements in 
the past. Entitlements have been con-
nected to actually work to incentivize 
people to be able to work, knowing 
that people don’t grow out of poverty 
by constantly getting government ben-
efits. You are trapped in poverty. Work 
is what actually helps people escape 
out of poverty. 
That is what Bill Clinton talked 
about often, about changing welfare as 
we know it. This bill actually changes 
it back to welfare as we knew it and 
shifts back entitlements to say you 
don’t have to actually be working to 
receive all these government benefits. 
In fact, this bill even says you don’t 
even have to be an American citizen to 
receive all these benefits; that if you 
are illegally present in the country, 
you get thousands and thousands of 
dollars in government benefits. If you 
are not working, but you are able to 
work and you choose not to, you get 
thousands and thousands and thou-
sands of dollars in benefits. 
I have to tell you, for the folks I 
know who leave for work at 6 a.m. and 
head to work, they are a little frus-
trated that their tax dollars are going 
to people still in bed, who are not en-
gaging. But that is what this bill does;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9230 
December 16, 2021 
it changes us from a situation where 
we incentivize work to we incentivize 
not working. 
Part of that is in the child tax credit 
that is being discussed. I and my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
voted to change the child tax credit for 
this year that was already in place, 
that already incentivizes work, that 
helps individuals with small children 
who need help. That has been in place 
in the Tax Code. In fact, Republicans 
also voted for that in the past with a 
work incentive. 
That was changed in March of this 
year in a straight partisan vote. And it 
was done for a temporary basis because 
of COVID, to actually allocate dollars 
to families, regardless of if they are 
working or not during the time of 
COVID. 
Now, the conversation is, that needs 
to be extended, not just through COVID 
but to just keep extending it, to take 
away the work requirements, to take 
away the requirement to be a citizen of 
the United States to receive these dol-
lars, and to actually make it where you 
are getting a monthly check rather 
than just a tax incentive at the end of 
the year based on if you were working 
or not. 
And the working requirement is not 
high. It is, literally, if you worked and 
earned $2,500 in a year, you qualify for 
the tax credit. But they take away 
even that requirement for your family. 
The childcare piece has been inter-
esting because I have heard a lot of my 
Democratic 
colleagues 
talk 
about, 
well, 
we 
are 
going 
to 
give 
free 
childcare to folks. 
The problem is—a multitude of issues 
with this. One is, if you are a faith- 
based entity for childcare, you are ex-
cluded from this, which about half of 
the childcare facilities around the 
country are provided by churches and 
faith-based nonprofits—rural and urban 
areas, they are all cut out. 
The other challenge is, while they 
talk 
about 
free 
childcare, 
free 
childcare, free childcare, a very liberal 
think tank just did the math on this, 
what it would mean for middle-class 
families who actually do childcare at 
that same facility. Middle-class fami-
lies who are paying right now for 
childcare would, after this bill is put in 
place—they estimate that it would cost 
$13,000 more a year for childcare if you 
are not getting the subsidies. 
So if you are getting the subsidies, it 
is free. If you are a dollar past the sub-
sidies, you are going to pay $13,000 
more a year for your childcare. 
I hope you are tracking the cost of 
natural gas as it is raised because it is 
about to go up again. If this bill—what 
I call the ‘‘Build Back Broke’’ bill— 
passes, the cost of natural gas and the 
cost of heating across America will go 
up because there is a new fee on meth-
ane. 
I could go on and on and on with the 
issues that are in this bill that are con-
tent, that are philosophical issues, that 
are issues that affect people who live in 
my State and will raise the cost for 
them. 
Some people ask me: Who are the 
folks who actually like this bill? 
Well, there are quite a few folks who 
like this bill. The folks who are in 
wealthy Democrat-run States, they 
love this bill because the wealthiest in-
dividuals in the highest tax States— 
and those are the blue States—the 
wealthiest individuals in the highest 
tax States, they get a huge tax break 
in this bill. For the wealthiest individ-
uals, they get an $80,000-a-year cut in 
their taxes, what they call State and 
local taxes. So if you are in New York 
or New Jersey or Illinois or in Cali-
fornia and you are in the top 1 percent, 
you get an $80,000 cut in your taxes. 
They like this bill. 
Somebody else who likes this bill are 
the wealthy who actually buy electric 
vehicles—incredibly expensive, beau-
tiful vehicles, many of them, but they 
get $12,500 off of their vehicle based on 
this bill. 
The environmental activists love this 
bill because billions of dollars actually 
go directly to these environmental ac-
tivist groups. Many who were active in 
the Biden campaign, they get addi-
tional billions of dollars coming in. In 
fact, there are billions of dollars to cre-
ate a new Civilian Climate Corps—a 
group of young people who will travel 
around the country actually promoting 
environmentalism, paid for with Fed-
eral tax dollars. They like this bill. 
Unions like this bill because, cur-
rently, if you donate to a nonprofit, 
you are able to take some of that off of 
your taxes. But under this bill, that 
goes away, and it is replaced with if 
you pay union dues, you get to write 
this off your taxes. So unions defi-
nitely like this bill. 
And the folks who really, really like 
this bill—reporters and journalists. Re-
porters and journalists love this bill. 
So some of them are not talking about 
the content of this bill. The reason I 
say that, because this bill pays half the 
salary for reporters and journalists all 
over the country. This bill puts in 
place that half the salary of reporters 
and journalists in every city and every 
community across America will get 
half of their salary paid for by the Fed-
eral tax dollars. 
Let’s see, government-paid reporters 
and journalists—what could go wrong 
with that? 
There are a lot of issues in this bill. 
And as we talk through this bill, and 
as, thankfully, this bill is slowing down 
dramatically so that people are able to 
see the contents of this bill, I have 
more and more people who catch me 
and say: I have a major concern with 
this bill and, I have to tell you, I have 
had for months. And we continue to be 
able to speak out on issues that change 
the direction for our Nation that are 
actually built into this bill. 
CHRISTMAS 
Mr. President, it is the middle of De-
cember, and we are still hanging out in 
DC. We are actually past the date that 
we were supposed to not be here any 
longer, according to our official cal-
endar, but there is work to be done. 
And we continue to be able to do the 
work. It is a contentious body and, at 
times, a contentious nation. 
I was with a group of folks yesterday 
for an early morning breakfast. And as 
we prayed together, one of them looked 
at me and said: I need a little ‘‘Prince 
of Peace’’ right now. 
So can I just for a moment in this 
Chamber pause and just do a quick re-
minder of what is coming over the next 
couple of weeks, not about the heat of 
battle in this room but where we are in 
this season? 
Reading from the Book of Isaiah, Isa-
iah 9:6 says: For a child will be born to 
us. A son will be given to us; and the 
government will rest on His shoulders, 
and His Name will be called Wonderful 
Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal Fa-
ther, Prince of Peace. And there will be 
no end to the increase of this govern-
ment or of his peace. It sounds like this 
in Luke, Chapter 2: 
Now in those days a decree went out from 
Caesar Augustus, that a census be taken of 
all the inhabited earth. This was the first 
census taken while Quirinius was governor of 
Syria. And everyone was on his way to reg-
ister for the census, each to his own city. Jo-
seph also went up from Galilee, from the city 
of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David 
which is called Bethlehem, because he was of 
the house and family of David, in order to 
register along with Mary, who was engaged 
to him, and was with child. While they were 
there, the days were completed for her to 
give birth. And she gave birth to her first-
born son; and she wrapped Him in cloths, and 
laid Him in a manger, because there was no 
room for them in the inn. 
In the same region there were shepherds 
staying out in the fields and keeping watch 
over their flock by night. And an angel of 
the Lord suddenly stood before them, and 
the glory of the Lord shone around them; 
and they were terribly frightened. But the 
angel said to them, ‘‘Do not be afraid; for be-
hold, I bring you good news of great joy 
which will be for all the people; for today in 
the city of David there has been born for you 
a Savior, who is Christ the Lord. This will be 
a sign for you: you will find a baby wrapped 
in cloths and lying in a manger.’’ And sud-
denly there appeared with the angel a mul-
titude of the heavenly host praising God and 
saying, ‘‘Glory to God in the highest, and on 
earth peace among men with whom He is 
pleased.’’ 
When the angels had gone away from them 
into heaven, the shepherds began saying to 
one another, ‘‘Let’s go straight to Bethlehem 
then, and see this thing that has happened 
which the Lord has made known to us.’’ So 
they came in a hurry and found their way to 
Mary and Joseph, and the baby as He lay in 
the manger. When they had seen this, they 
made known the statement which had been 
told them about this Child. And all who 
heard it wondered at the things which were 
told them by the shepherds. But Mary treas-
ured all these things, pondering them in her 
heart. The shepherds went back, glorifying 
and praising God for all that they had heard 
and seen, just as had been told to them. 
A little peace on Earth will be help-
ful to this body and to our Nation on 
this day. 
Merry Christmas to you. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
f 
ENSURING 
THAT 
GOODS 
MADE 
WITH FORCED LABOR IN THE 
XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS 
REGION OF THE PEOPLE’S RE-
PUBLIC 
OF 
CHINA 
DO 
NOT 
ENTER 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
MARKET 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, we have 
come down to the floor multiple times 
in the last few weeks trying to push 
the passage of our bipartisan Uyghur 
Forced Labor Prevention Act. 
For those who are not familiar with 
it at this point, it basically says that 
you can’t import products into the 
United States that are made by slave 
labor in Xinjiang or entities that are 
associated with the government of that 
region. If you are a company that is 
manufacturing in that area, you need 
to prove that slaves didn’t make it; the 
presumption is on you. 
It is already illegal, by the way, to 
bring goods made with slave labor. It 
has been that way since the thirties. 
Yet it still happens, and we know it is 
happening at an alarming, horrific 
rate, with the genocide that we now 
witness being carried out by the Chi-
nese Government in the Xinjiang re-
gion. 
This bill, which we hope, here in a 
few moments, passes today, will head 
to the President and will become law, 
and it will help tremendously in stop-
ping that from happening. 
Many companies have already taken 
steps to clean up their supply chains, 
and, frankly, they should have no con-
cerns about this law. Yet for those that 
have not done that, they will no longer 
be able to continue to make Ameri-
cans—every one of us, frankly—unwit-
ting accomplices in the atrocities and 
genocide that are being committed by 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
As if in legislative session, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of H.R. 6256, which was received 
from the House; that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed; and 
that the motion to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Reserving the right to 
object, first, let me thank the Senator 
from Florida for doing such great 
work, along with Senator MERKLEY and 
others, on this incredibly important 
piece of legislation. We are going to be 
able in a few moments to speak to-
gether, Republicans and Democrats, on 
our commitment to ending genocide in 
China. 
I want to thank the Senator for 
working with me to make sure that, as 
part of his unanimous consent request, 
we are going to be able to make sure 
we have personnel in place to properly 
implement this policy. We have dozens 
of State Department and Department 
of Defense nominees pending on this 
floor—more so than we have ever had 
at the end of a first-term, first-year 
Presidency—and we will, hopefully be-
fore we leave—we have to, before we 
leave, make substantial progress on 
this list in order to adequately protect 
our country. 
At the very least, as we put forward 
this important new policy, it does 
make sense to accompany it and its 
passage with three key personnel who 
will be in charge of implementing it. 
I believe we are going to be able to 
modify this request in the following 
manner. I would formally ask Senator 
RUBIO to modify this request that he 
has made to include the following re-
quest. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT 
Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that notwithstanding rule XXII, if 
applicable, at 4:30 p.m. today, the Sen-
ate proceed to the following nomina-
tions: Executive Calendar No. 525, R. 
Nicholas Burns, of Massachusetts, to 
be 
Ambassador 
Extraordinary 
and 
Plenipotentiary of the United States of 
America to the People’s Republic of 
China; Calendar No. 626, Ramin Toloui, 
of Iowa, to be an Assistant Secretary of 
State (Economic and Business Affairs); 
and Calendar No. 619, Rashad Hussain, 
of Virginia, to be Ambassador at Large 
for International Religious Freedom; 
that there be 10 minutes for debate 
equally divided in the usual form on 
the nominations en bloc; that upon the 
use or yielding back of that time, the 
Senate vote without intervening action 
or debate on the nominations in the 
order listed; that if the nominations 
are confirmed, the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table with no intervening action or 
debate; and that the President be im-
mediately notified of the Senate’s ac-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, I have no 
objection to the modification. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the request, as modified? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (H.R. 6256) was ordered to a 
third reading, was read the third time, 
and passed. 
f 
RECESS 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate stands 
in recess until 2 p.m. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 12:52 p.m., 
recessed until 2 p.m. and reassembled 
when called to order by the Presiding 
Officer (Mr. SCHATZ). 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR—Continued 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, this is 
Holly Durben from Shenandoah, IA. 
Holly was someone who loved animals 
and loved nature. She was a people per-
son. The thing that she loved most in 
the world was her family. 
But tragically, Holly took her last 
breath on the morning of July 18, 2009. 
Brian Davis murdered her in a small 
farmhouse just south of Shenandoah. 
Holly is one of the hundreds of women 
murdered annually by a current or 
former intimate partner—nearly three 
women a day. 
Americans are being devastated by a 
wave of violent crime. Night after 
night, folks turn on their local news 
and hear of yet another tragic story of 
murder, of rape, and violent crimes of 
all natures that are ravaging their 
community. 
In October, the United States re-
corded its highest spike in homicides 
in modern history. Last year the mur-
der rate in this country rose by 30 per-
cent. These murders are not being com-
mitted by law-abiding citizens. They 
are being committed by extremely dan-
gerous and violent criminals, like 
Brian Davis. 
The reality is victims like Holly 
Durben and violent criminals like 
Brian Davis have been locked in homes 
together for nearly 2 years during this 
pandemic. Violent convicted criminals 
like Brian Davis, who murdered Holly, 
his fiancee, should not have access to 
firearms. 
Law-abiding 
Americans 
need 
the 
ability to protect themselves from vio-
lent criminals like Brian Davis. Iowans 
are common sense. We are pragmatic. 
We take our Second Amendment rights 
incredibly serious. We value the safety 
of our communities, and we think it is 
right to punish violent criminals when 
they break the law and are convicted. 
This isn’t some crazy idea. Under 
current Federal law which has been on 
the books for decades and in State 
codes all across the country, there are 
violent crimes that result in con-
sequences like the inability to possess 
a firearm. For example, someone con-
victed of a felony forfeits many of their 
rights. Felons can’t be on a jury. They 
can’t work for the Federal Government 
or serve in the military. 
Felons, like murderers and drug 
kingpins, lose these rights when they 
commit and are convicted of their 
crimes. A fugitive from justice is not 
permitted to have a firearm; the same 
for those who are in this country ille-
gally. 
Under current law—current law—in-
dividuals who have been convicted of a 
misdemeanor domestic-violence crime 
are also on this list. As of today, if two 
individuals are married, the convicted 
abuser is held accountable, and that 
makes sense. But if they are not mar-
ried, the convicted violent abuser is 
not held accountable. 
I believe we need to get tough on 
crime, and I believe law-abiding gun 
owners in this country agree with me. 
Brian Davis, a violent, convicted crimi-
nal is not law abiding. 
I want to be crystal clear about a few 
things. One, what we are talking about

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9232 
December 16, 2021 
here depends on a conviction—a convic-
tion of domestic violence. That is a 
guilty verdict after a just trial, an ad-
judicated-fairly trial. Due process is 
completely intact, fully present, and I 
will not be compromised on that, I can 
promise you. 
Two, domestic violence does not 
mean emotional distress. Domestic vio-
lence does not mean a verbal argu-
ment. Domestic violence means a vio-
lent crime. 
Three, not a single innocent or law- 
abiding gun owner will or should be im-
pacted. Today there are women trapped 
in relationships with violent criminals, 
our 
daughters 
and 
mothers, 
our 
friends, and our neighbors. 
Convicted 
violent 
criminals 
have 
proven themselves to be unfit to fully 
participate in our society. We can’t 
choose to just protect women with a 
ring on their finger from violent abus-
ers. We must hold violent criminals ac-
countable. Let’s protect our daughters 
and punish the criminals. 
Speaking from personal experience, 
domestic violence is a crime worth 
being tough on. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from California 
is recognized. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today to share my support of the 
ongoing bipartisan efforts to reauthor-
ize the Violence Against Women Act. 
As you know from the prior speaker, 
the distinguished Senator, negotiations 
to reauthorize the Violence Against 
Women Act on a bipartisan basis have 
been ongoing now for three years. 
Since the beginning of this year, my of-
fice has been working closely with Sen-
ator ERNST’s, Senator DURBIN’s, and 
Senator MURKOWSKI’s offices to nego-
tiate bipartisan agreement to reau-
thorize this important and critical law. 
I am thrilled that we are now able to 
share that we have reached a bipar-
tisan framework which will strengthen, 
modernize, and reauthorize the Vio-
lence Against Women Act. 
We are committed to introducing 
this bill next month. This bipartisan 
agreement would reauthorize the Vio-
lence Against Women Act through 2026 
and provide important opportunities to 
modernize the law that has been so 
critical to protecting and supporting 
survivors of domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, and stalking. 
Our bipartisan agreement would en-
hance and expand services for survivors 
of domestic violence—including sur-
vivors in rural communities, LGBT 
survivors, survivors with disabilities, 
and survivors who experience abuse 
later in life. 
Our agreement would reauthorize and 
strengthen the criminal justice re-
sponse to domestic violence, including 
by improving the Justice Department’s 
STOP grant program, closing the ‘‘dat-
ing partner loophole’’ on a prospective 
basis, and strengthening the ability of 
Tribal courts to address instances of 
domestic violence on Tribal land. 
Our agreement would also invest in 
prevention education efforts. It would 
expand access to emergency housing 
support for domestic violence sur-
vivors, and it would improve the 
healthcare response to sexual violence 
across the country. 
These protections are urgently need-
ed, and the time to act is now. I have 
been here for a while. I have never seen 
the coming together of the two sides of 
the aisle any stronger than it is now to 
work together to solve this problem. 
So I look forward to participating in 
the introduction of this bipartisan bill 
to reauthorize the Violence Against 
Women Act next month. 
NOMINATION OF HOLLY A. THOMAS 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would, if I could, 
also like to speak briefly in support of 
Holly Thomas, who has been nomi-
nated to serve as a judge on the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
Judge Thomas is an experienced appel-
late litigator and currently serves as a 
judge of the Superior Court of Los An-
geles County. And I hope my colleagues 
will support her. 
Mr. President, I rise today in support 
of the nomination of Holly Thomas to 
serve as a judge on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
Judge Thomas is an experienced ap-
pellate litigator and sitting State 
court judge in California. I believe she 
would make an outstanding addition to 
the NinthCircuit. 
Her credentials are impeccable. She 
is a graduate of Stanford University 
and Yale Law School. 
After law school, Judge Thomas 
spent more than a decade gaining expe-
rience and insight into the Federal ap-
peals courts as a litigator whose pri-
mary focus was on appellate cases. She 
has served as a public interest lawyer 
with the NAACP, in the Federal Gov-
ernment as an appellate attorney with 
the Civil Rights Division of the Justice 
Department, and in State government 
in both California and New York. 
Though she began her career as an 
appellate litigator, Judge Thomas has 
been fascinated by judicial service 
since her childhood. When she was a 
young child, her mother—who was a 
bookkeeper—would take her to the San 
Diego courthouse to watch the legal 
proceedings in court. 
So it is fitting that in 2018, she was 
appointed to serve as a judge on the 
California Superior Court for Los An-
geles County. Judge Thomas works in 
the Family Law Division, where she 
hears between 10 and 30 cases on aver-
age each day, including a mix of hear-
ings and trials. She has also served on 
a temporary basis as a State appeals 
judge on the California Court of Appeal 
for the Second Appellate District. 
Judge Thomas has a breadth of expe-
rience and knowledge that would make 
her well-suited to sit on the Ninth Cir-
cuit. 
If 
confirmed, 
Judge 
Thomas 
would be the first Black woman to 
serve on the Ninth Circuit from Cali-
fornia and only the second Black 
woman to ever serve on the Ninth Cir-
cuit. 
I encourage all my colleagues to vote 
for her confirmation. 
I thank the Presiding Officer. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska is recognized. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I 
am pleased to be on the floor today 
with my colleagues, both the Senator 
from Iowa behind me and the Senator 
from California, because I want to 
thank them publicly for their leader-
ship as they work to address these 
issues of domestic violence. They have 
been leaders in this arena for years, 
and I appreciate that. 
I am pleased to have worked with 
them on this framework that has been 
discussed by both Senators and to ac-
knowledge the work of Senator DURBIN 
as part of this initiative as well. 
I think as both of them have spoken, 
it is recognized that this is a matter of 
urgency. This is a matter for all of us, 
on a bipartisan basis. Domestic vio-
lence, unfortunately, knows no polit-
ical bounds, and our response to those 
who are truly among the most vulner-
able of us—that response—should also 
be bipartisan. 
So I want to commend Senator 
ERNST, Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator 
DURBIN for their work in really coming 
to find common ground on this very 
important 
matter. 
It 
has 
been 
years—— 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Permit me a mo-
ment to interrupt you. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Please. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. One of my great 
joys is to work on a bipartisan basis, 
and the Senator from Alaska has been 
just wonderful. She is a 10, in my book. 
You have listened to us on this side. 
Our staffs have been able to work 
closely together, and I think, thanks to 
you, we have a workable, bipartisan 
product. So I just want to say thank 
you. I wish the Senate could be more 
like this all the time, but I think we 
made a great notch in the right track. 
So thank you very much. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Well, thank you. 
Again, it takes a lot of people, and 
the years that Senator ERNST has been 
working this initiative on this side of 
the aisle is something that, again, we 
want to build on, and we need to build 
on it together. 
It has been years in the making. The 
last time we had a VAWA reauthoriza-
tion was VAWA 2013, and so we are 
high past time to be addressing this 
very significant matter. 
No compromise is perfect. I think ev-
eryone recognizes that. But what has 
been developed through this framework 
is a proposal that will really help to 
prevent violence, to support our sur-
vivors, and to hold perpetrators to ac-
count. 
The effort to be here where we are 
today on the floor, speaking to this, is 
one thing, but we all want to get to 
that next step, which is filing the legis-
lation so we can get it moving through 
this process, and I look forward to 
doing that in the new year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9233 
December 16, 2021 
I can tell you, as a Senator from 
Alaska, 
this 
is 
an 
extraordinarily 
pressing issue in my State. As the vice 
chairman of the Indian Affairs Com-
mittee, I can affirm that this is a very 
real need across Native lands, and it is 
the disproportionate victimization of 
Native people that I want to focus my 
comments on today. 
By now, I would hope that every Sen-
ator understands the crisis of missing 
and murdered indigenous women and 
girls. We refer to this as MMIW. That 
is why we passed Savanna’s Act and 
the Not Invisible Act. 
I want to acknowledge my colleague, 
who has been working this issue with 
us for so long, Senator CORTEZ MASTO. 
I think we recognize that we have 
made good progress there, but to fully 
address the root causes of this crisis— 
the high rates of domestic violence, 
sexual assault, and trafficking, the vio-
lent crime in Native communities—we 
have an awful lot more to do. 
The rates of violence experienced by 
Alaska Natives are particularly hor-
rific, and the statistics should shock us 
all. I repeat them a lot, and they still 
shock me. According to a report pre-
pared by the Indian Law and Order 
Commission, Alaska Native women are 
overrepresented by nearly 250 percent 
among female domestic violence vic-
tims around our country. 
Putting it in context here, a couple 
years ago, there was an investigation 
that was conducted by Anchorage 
Daily News that determined that one 
in three Native communities in rural 
Alaska has no local law enforcement 
that is physically present, leaving Na-
tive women and children at greater 
risk of violence. Think about what that 
means for just a minute, to live in a 
community where there is no one to 
turn to, no law enforcement presence 
to turn to. Maybe you are able to share 
your story with a local health aide 
there, but that is about as far as you 
can go. 
Beyond that, you have many Alaskan 
Tribes that lack the tools they need to 
address violence in their communities. 
A couple years ago, the Attorney 
General at the time, William Barr, was 
invited to the State and came up, and 
we said: We need to get you out to one 
of these remote villages. 
He saw firsthand, and he was so dra-
matically impacted after his just mul-
tiple hours on the ground there, he de-
clared a law enforcement emergency— 
a law enforcement emergency—after 
hearing directly from those who had 
suffered due to lack of public safety. He 
said at the time that it was harder for 
him to imagine a more vulnerable pop-
ulation than the women and children 
he saw in rural Alaska. He took that 
back to DC with him and acted on it. 
His declaration was based on the fact 
that Alaska has the highest per capita 
crime rate in this country, and, of 
course, we face very unique geographic 
and jurisdictional landscapes. 
Then comes COVID–19, and you have 
a pandemic where you have to be in 
your social bubbles, you have to be in-
side, and you have to be where it is safe 
to be away from the virus, but that 
safe place was not a safe place for far 
too many people. 
Last summer, rural Alaska saw five 
domestic violence homicides in 10 days. 
Again, these are small, rural commu-
nities—five homicides in a matter of 10 
days; domestic violence. In the 5 weeks 
after the State of Alaska declared a 
public health disaster due to the 
coronavirus pandemic, calls to our do-
mestic violence shelter increased by 52 
percent. 
You cannot let this go unaddressed. 
We have an opportunity here in this 
Congress to build on our previous work 
with VAWA 2013, where we have taken 
steps to resolve jurisdictional com-
plexity when it imperils the safety of 
people. The jurisdiction issues should 
not deny justice. It just should not. 
In the 2013 reauthorization of VAWA, 
Congress recognized the inherent au-
thority of Tribes to prosecute and pun-
ish certain domestic violence crimes 
committed by non-Indians against In-
dian people. 
At the time, that was described as 
unprecedented, and some Members of 
Congress and the media as well pushed 
a narrative that Tribal governments 
somehow were not going to be fair, 
that they would not safeguard the 
rights of non-Indian defendants. We 
knew that was going to be far from the 
truth, and nearly 8 years later, despite 
all of the horror stories that were pre-
dicted, the record shows that non-In-
dian defendants experienced a Tribal 
justice system that treats them fairly 
and in some ways with more attention 
than State or Federal systems. 
So I think now what we need to focus 
on, folks, we need to focus on the real 
horror story, and that horror story is 
the acts of violence being perpetrated 
against Native women and children. So 
I have set out to do that through the 
Tribal title that will be included in 
this larger VAWA reauthorization once 
it is introduced. 
Chairman SCHATZ, on the Indian Af-
fairs Committee, and I have worked on 
this together. We posted our text to 
the committee website last week. Our 
title closes loopholes and builds upon 
the success of the 2013 reauthorization, 
and we include specific solutions to 
protect Alaska Native people. 
The Tribal title will further restore 
and improve the implementation of the 
special Tribal criminal jurisdiction 
over non-Indians who commit violent 
crimes in Native communities, and it 
will do so by allowing Tribes that exer-
cise this special jurisdiction to charge 
defendants with crimes that are adja-
cent to domestic violence, such as vio-
lence against children or assault on 
law enforcement. 
I think it is important to know that 
children were involved in 58 percent of 
all incidents of domestic violence in 
these VAWA 2013 cases. This is accord-
ing to a report by the Federal Govern-
ment a couple years ago, in 2019. By 
empowering Tribal courts this way, we 
can help combat this major public safe-
ty issue. 
American Indians and Alaska Natives 
are the victims of rape, sexual assault, 
and domestic violence in numbers far 
out of proportion to the level these 
crimes are committed outside of Na-
tive communities. This is a moral im-
perative. It is a wrong that we must 
make right, and we also need to do it 
in a way that recognizes the unique sit-
uation we have in the State of Alaska. 
You are going to hear later discus-
sion about ANCSA. Two days from now 
is the 50th anniversary of the Alaska 
Native Claims Settlement Act. ANCSA 
created a new approach to Tribal land 
tenure that is very, very different from 
the lower 48 reservation system. While 
Alaska is home to almost 40 percent of 
the Tribes in the country, we have only 
one Indian reservation in the State. 
After the Supreme Court decision in 
the Venetie case in which the Court 
held that ANCSA lands are not ‘‘Indian 
Country,’’ it became the State’s duty, 
largely alone, to provide for public 
safety and justice for Alaska Natives. 
The Tribal title that we have devel-
oped includes an Alaska solution to a 
complex jurisdictional situation. It in-
cludes an Alaska pilot program which 
builds on previous legislation that I 
have introduced and will empower a 
limited number of Alaskan Tribes to 
exercise special criminal jurisdiction 
over certain crimes that occur in vil-
lages in Alaska. 
Similar to how the pilot rolled out 
for the lower 48 Tribes, Alaskan Tribes 
will have to meet certain criteria, in-
cluding having a Tribal justice system 
that can adequately and appropriately 
safeguard the rights of defendants. 
In addition to the provisions essen-
tial to bringing justice and safety to 
Alaska Native people, our critical leg-
islation will ensure that VAWA’s tools 
and resources will better serve the 
needs of survivors of domestic violence, 
dating violence, sexual assault, and 
stalking. 
I am proud to have authored text 
that will help to address this ongoing 
epidemic that Alaska faces with vio-
lence, which has left long-lasting trau-
ma for too many of our women, our 
children, and our families. Congress-
man YOUNG on the House side has in-
troduced similar language to help in 
this. We simply cannot allow survivors 
and the needs of the most vulnerable to 
go unmet. 
Very quickly, I want to just outline a 
couple different provisions that are 
contained in this bipartisan framework 
that recognize some of the matters we 
have been working on in Alaska. 
There is a provision named in mem-
ory of an Alaskan, Breanna Moore. 
Bree’s Law is what we call it. In 2014, 
Cindy and Butch Moore experienced a 
tragedy that no parents should ever 
have to experience. They received a 
call that their 20-year-old daughter had 
been shot by her boyfriend in Anchor-
age. In the wake of that devastation,

they turned their energy to and they 
put their hearts and their passion into 
working around the State and now at 
the Federal level to ensure that edu-
cation is provided to teens to prevent 
future tragedies. So Bree’s Law drives 
education initiatives to enable youth, 
parents, and advocates to recognize, 
prevent, and mitigate teen dating vio-
lence. 
Another provision addresses support 
services for victims. We know it is dif-
ficult to access the necessary medical 
forensic services in Alaska. These 
allow for evidence collection and aid in 
a survivor’s journey to justice. 
While we have very troubling statis-
tics on sexual assault and domestic vi-
olence, Alaskans have also been on the 
frontlines of innovation, offering solu-
tions. 
The 
Alaska 
Comprehensive 
Training Forensic Academy, which is a 
pilot program run through the Univer-
sity of Alaska Anchorage, is making a 
difference in the lives of Alaskans who 
have experienced interpersonal vio-
lence. 
Built on the belief that all victims of 
violence deserve evaluation and care 
from forensically trained healthcare 
providers, I have been able to secure 
some provisions in our VAWA proposal 
that will allow other universities and 
States to model the successful program 
and expand access to trauma-informed 
care. 
There is clearly a public safety crisis 
that we are dealing with in rural Alas-
ka and across Indian Country, but we 
have an opportunity in this Congress 
to work together across the aisle to 
find solutions and to restore justice. I 
look forward to building strong, bipar-
tisan support for VAWA reauthoriza-
tion that will make a positive dif-
ference in the safety of Native commu-
nities and for victims of domestic vio-
lence and entire communities in Alas-
ka and, of course, across the country. 
We must let our women, children, 
and families who have been affected by 
devastating violence know that you are 
heard and that we stand with you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois recognized. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I just 
want to join the comments of Senator 
MURKOWSKI
and Senator ERNST
and 
Senator FEINSTEIN. I want to thank 
them for allowing me to join a pretty 
power-packed team working on the Vi-
olence Against Women Act. 
Senator FEINSTEIN is our lead sponsor 
on the Democratic side. I am happy to 
work with her all the time. I want to 
especially thank Senator ERNST on the 
Republican side, who has been des-
ignated as the official negotiator on 
the reauthorization of VAWA for the 
last 3 years, and, as you have just 
heard, a passionate supporter of our ef-
forts, Senator LISA MURKOWSKI of Alas-
ka—we worked closely together on 
other legislation, and this one is ex-
tremely important. 
This 
afternoon, 
Senators 
ERNST, 
FEINSTEIN, 
MURKOWSKI, 
and 
myself 
have announced that we have reached a 
bipartisan agreement and that we will 
be introducing an updated version of 
VAWA next month when we return. We 
are coming together in supporting the 
simple premise that VAWA will save 
lives. We need to ensure every survivor, 
whether they live in rural Alaska or 
urban Illinois, can reach out for a life-
line in a moment of crisis. 
We still have work to do. We still 
need cosponsors. We are going to be 
working individually, Member to Mem-
ber, to make sure this important legis-
lation passes. 
It is a statistic that should shock us 
all: Nearly one in three women living 
today—nearly one in three—has experi-
enced some form of physical or sexual 
violence. That finding came from the 
WHO, surveying women in more than 
160 countries across the globe. It proves 
that this crisis of sexual and domestic 
violence touches every community in 
the world. But our responsibility, first, 
is here at home, in all of the 50 States, 
to make sure that we are doing every-
thing we can to protect women who are 
vulnerable. 
Let me tell you about one of those 
survivors; her name is Meaghan. And 
she reached out to my office to share 
her story. Five years ago, Meaghan was 
brutally assaulted by her ex-husband. 
The beating was so violent that, today, 
she is still suffering from hearing loss. 
While Meaghan was being attacked, 
her 2-and-half-year-old son—who is on 
the autism spectrum—ran over to help 
her. 
Her 
ex-husband 
responded 
by 
throwing the child through a closet. 
Meaghan says the experience was so 
traumatizing that her son didn’t speak 
for a full year after the attack. 
When Meaghan finally broke free 
from her ex-husband, she packed her 
bags, buckled her two children into the 
car, and fled for her life. But he contin-
ued tracking her, requiring Meaghan 
and her children to move 10 times in 
the last few years. 
As Meaghan and her family have 
begun to heal from this horrifying or-
deal, she says they have found much- 
needed compassion and support in the 
detectives and social workers that 
came to their aid. 
She wrote that service providers 
‘‘were patient with me and didn’t push 
me, [they] only showed me they cared, 
and most of all didn’t give up . . . with 
their support and guidance I found the 
light at the end of the tunnel and I 
fought my way out of the darkness 
that my ex-husband had cast . . . on 
my life.’’ 
Meaghan’s story illustrates how laws 
like VAWA have the potential to 
change—and even save—lives. In her 
case, VAWA provided critical resources 
to law enforcement and social service 
agencies that helped her and her family 
escape a perilous situation. 
And today, at a moment when sexual 
and domestic violence are on the rise 
in America, we need to do more than 
reauthorize VAWA. We need to build on 
its achievements—and we need to do it 
on a bipartisan basis. 
I thank the group for allowing me to 
join them. 
We have work to do, and I am look-
ing forward to doing it with you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak for up to 
10 minutes prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF HOLLY A. THOMAS 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, the 
next vote is going to be a motion to 
discharge from the Judiciary Com-
mittee Judge Holly Thomas for the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth 
Circuit. I am going to vote no because 
I have not had the opportunity to actu-
ally meet Judge Thomas. 
In a remarkable undermining of sen-
atorial tradition, the Biden adminis-
tration White House is now saying that 
no Senator is allowed to meet a circuit 
court judge prior to the confirmation 
vote of that judge. 
The Presiding Officer might be tilt-
ing his head at me like that seems 
crazy. Well, it is crazy. Every Ninth 
Circuit judge—a court of appeals that 
has enormous power over my State— 
who has been nominated by any Presi-
dent since I have been a U.S. Senator, 
I have met with to discuss issues. This 
is part of our advice-and-consent role. 
Yet this White House is now saying no 
Senator can meet with a circuit court 
judge, even for an hour, prior to the 
vote despite the fact that they are get-
ting ready to have life tenure. 
This is in line with this administra-
tion and with, unfortunately, some of 
my Democratic colleagues who are just 
smashing institutional norms in this 
body that have significant bipartisan 
support. 
We saw the junior Senator from Mas-
sachusetts yesterday saying she wants 
to pack the Supreme Court. I am sure 
that is going to lead to a charge of 
other Democrat Senators. My col-
leagues are all very focused on getting 
rid of the filibuster despite the fact 
that more than half the Democratic 
conference, in April of 2017, wrote a let-
ter to the majority and minority lead-
ers of the Senate, saying: Don’t get rid 
of 
the 
filibuster. 
Now 
only 
JOE 
MANCHIN and KYRSTEN SINEMA seem to 
be the ones defending it. I would love it 
if the press asked questions of the 
other 26 of my Democratic colleagues 
who, just 4 years ago, said: Don’t do 
this. But this norm that is being under-
mined right now—of Senators being 
able to meet with nominees to circuit 
courts—is a new low. 
I raised this with senior Biden ad-
ministration White House officials just 
last week, and they said they would 
look into it. They seemed a little con-
fused. The White House Counsel for the 
President finally called me back after I 
had been trying to get ahold of her be-
cause I had heard it was her idea. Then 
I asked her ‘‘Why are you doing this?’’ 
By the way, the Trump administra-
tion didn’t do this. To the contrary,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9235 
December 16, 2021 
their White House Counsel actually 
tried to get Republican and Democrat 
Senators to meet with circuit court 
nominees to help maybe get bipartisan 
votes. So it wasn’t the precedent of the 
previous administration. 
The White House Counsel actually 
told me—she used this language: ‘‘We 
are doing it to protect the judges’’—‘‘to 
protect the judges.’’ From what—Sen-
ators doing their constitutional duty? 
What are they hiding? Are they really 
that unimpressive that they have to 
have their own nominees being pro-
tected from us here in the Senate? 
So the bottom line is that all of this 
is patently absurd, and I think many of 
my Democratic colleagues actually 
agree with me. I have talked to a num-
ber of them, and I don’t think this is a 
precedent that anyone who is a U.S. 
Senator should want, whether you are 
a Democrat or a Republican. 
Remember, these judges are going to 
have enormous power over the people 
we represent, and they are going to 
have life tenure. It is not like voting 
for an Assistant Secretary who will be 
2, 3, 4 years on the job. This is life ten-
ure, and they can’t take an hour out of 
their time prior to the vote to meet 
with Senators. 
I asked these judges in a speech just 
last week: Hey, give me a call. You 
don’t have to get permission from the 
White House. This is actually a first 
test of your judicial independence. Call 
me. I want to talk to you. 
We didn’t hear back from any judges, 
and the White House is still blocking 
it. 
What is really surprising is that the 
current President is the former chair of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee. I 
wonder if he actually knows what is 
going on with his senior staff of his 
White House Counsel where, right now, 
no Member of the U.S. Senate who is 
trying to do his advice-and-consent 
constitutional role can even meet—can 
even meet—with a circuit court judge. 
I am pretty sure most of my colleagues 
don’t agree with this. 
What I am hoping for is to get the 
White House to change its outlook on 
this, to follow the example of the 
Trump administration—I know that 
might be a hard swallow—and have 
these judges meet with us. 
When I meet with them, I talk about 
Alaska legal issues, and if you are a 
judge who grew up in L.A. and you are 
an L.A. judge, you don’t know any-
thing about Alaska, but you will have 
an enormous impact on the people I 
represent. 
So I think what you are going to see 
until we get some cooperation with the 
White House is that I hope most of my 
colleagues, 
Republican 
colleagues, 
whether they think these nominees are 
qualified or not, are going to vote no. 
They are going to vote no, and the rea-
son is a core principle: We should be 
able to do advice and consent. 
If there were a Republican President 
in the White House and if some of my 
Democratic colleagues said ‘‘Hey, can 
you help me get a meeting with a cir-
cuit court nominee who is going to 
have big impacts on my State?’’ I 
would certainly do it. Like I said, we 
didn’t have to do it the last time be-
cause that was the Trump administra-
tion’s standard operating procedure. 
I hope we can get to an agreement on 
this, and I hope all Senators can agree 
with this. I am hopeful that you are 
going to see, at least with my col-
leagues, that there are going to be no 
‘‘yes’’ votes on any of these nominees, 
and that is not good. These circuit 
court judges want a bipartisan con-
firmation. Well, they are not going to 
get it until we are able to do our con-
stitutional duty of advice and consent 
for judges, life-tenured judges, who 
have enormous power over the people 
we represent. 
I am hopeful that every Member of 
this body can work with us, work with 
me, work with the White House, maybe 
even call the President and say: Do you 
know what? This is probably a stand-
ard principle that you guys want to get 
rid of. Making sure U.S. Senators can-
not meet with judges who are going to 
have lifetime tenure is smashing a bi-
partisan institutional norm. That is 
not going to serve this body well at all. 
I yield the floor, and I encourage my 
colleagues to all vote no in the upcom-
ing vote to discharge this nominee 
until we can actually talk to her and 
see what kind of judge she would be. 
This is a very, very reasonable posi-
tion, so I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
from all of my colleagues. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Judge 
Holly Thomas is a nominee for the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
She went through the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. It is a bipartisan com-
mittee of 11 to 11. She was before the 
committee, available for questions and 
available for written questions soon 
afterward. 
If the Senator from Alaska or any 
other Senator has a grievance with the 
White House’s procedure on how to 
handle his nominees, so be it, but is she 
going to be punished because that deci-
sion was made at the White House 
level? She went through the com-
mittee, as we asked her to, and made 
herself available. She has an extraor-
dinary record as a jurist, and to dis-
miss her because of a disagreement 
with the White House on the procedure 
on his nominees, I don’t think it is fair. 
I think she deserves to be judged on her 
merits, and on her merits, she should 
be sitting on the Ninth Circuit. 
Mr. President, today, the Senate will 
consider the nomination of Judge Holly 
Thomas for the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Ninth Circuit. 
Judge Thomas is a highly qualified 
nominee. Her extensive experience as 
an appellate litigator and a California 
State court judge will serve her well on 
the Ninth Circuit. 
And, if confirmed, she would be the 
first Black woman from California to 
serve on that court. 
A San Diego native, Judge Thomas 
was drawn to a career in law at a 
young 
age. 
Her 
mother—a 
book-
keeper—used to take her to the San 
Diego courthouse to watch the pro-
ceedings. That experience inspired her 
to pursue a law degree at Yale Law 
School—which she did after receiving 
her undergraduate degree from Stan-
ford University with Honors and Dis-
tinction. 
After law school, Judge Thomas 
began her legal career as a clerk for 
Judge Kim McLane Wardlaw on the 
Ninth Circuit. 
She then began an expansive appel-
late litigation career, initially working 
at the NAACP Legal Defense and Edu-
cational Fund, where she focused on 
education and issues related to crimi-
nal justice. 
In 2010, Judge Thomas joined the Jus-
tice Department, where she worked as 
a Senior Attorney in the Appellate 
Section of the Civil Rights Division. In 
this role, she argued appeals on behalf 
of the United States before multiple 
U.S. Courts of Appeals—including the 
First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Ninth 
Circuits. 
After 5 years at the Justice Depart-
ment, Judge Thomas went on to work 
for the Office of the New York Solicitor 
General, where she served as special 
counsel. In this role, Judge Thomas ar-
gued multiple cases before the Second 
Circuit and in the State courts of New 
York. 
In 2016, Judge Thomas became the 
deputy director of the California De-
partment of Fair Employment and 
Housing, where she helped enforce 
State and Federal civil rights laws. 
Since 2018, she has served on the Los 
Angeles County Superior Court—with 
the exception of this past summer. In 
May, the chief justice of the California 
Supreme Court chose Judge Thomas to 
serve as judge pro tem on the Cali-
fornia Court of Appeals. And she re-
turned to the LA County Superior 
Court earlier this year. 
During her time on the bench, Judge 
Thomas has handled hundreds of cases 
that have gone to verdict or judgment, 
and she has presided over thousands of 
hearings. As judge pro tem on the Cali-
fornia Court of Appeals, she sat on nu-
merous appellate court panels and au-
thored seven opinions, all of which 
were unanimous. 
In short, Judge Thomas has dem-
onstrated that she is a fair, impartial, 
and evenhanded jurist. 
She has extensive experience as a 
both a trial and appellate court judge. 
And before her appointment to the 
bench, she represented a wide range of 
litigants. 
The American Bar Association unani-
mously rated Judge Thomas as ‘‘Quali-
fied’’ to sit on the Ninth Circuit. 
And she has the strong support of her 
home State senators—Senators FEIN-
STEIN and PADILLA. 
Additionally, as only the second 
Black woman to ever serve on the 
Ninth Circuit, Judge Thomas will help

bring much needed diversity to our 
Federal judiciary. 
Given her varied professional back-
ground, years of appellate experience, 
and her accomplishments on the bench, 
Judge Thomas will be an excellent ad-
dition to the Ninth Circuit. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in supporting her 
nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I ask 
my friend and colleague from Illinois, 
who is the chairman of the Judiciary 
Committee, if he could actually work 
with us—I have already reached out to 
him and some other Democrat Sen-
ators—on this very reasonable request. 
He has been here a lot longer than I 
have. But every time there is a Ninth 
Circuit judge who has been nominated, 
I have met with him because it is so 
important to my State. Alaska has 1 
Ninth Circuit judge, and there are 29 
judges on the court. 
So I would ask, respectfully, the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee 
to work with me because this is a 
precedent that I don’t think any Sen-
ator, Democrat or Republican, wants. 
Literally, you are going to have the 
White House saying ‘‘You know what? 
You are not on the Judiciary Com-
mittee, so your advice-and-consent role 
under article II, section 2, is null and 
void’’ because the White House Counsel 
wants to ‘‘protect the judges’’? Protect 
them from what? 
So I want to work with my col-
leagues—all of them—particularly the 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, 
as he has a lot of influence, I am sure, 
with the White House and the White 
House Counsel’s Office, but, again, I en-
courage my colleagues to vote no until 
we start getting meetings and are able 
to do our duty. This is going to benefit 
my colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
over 
the 
long 
term, 
and 
it 
will 
strengthen this body, not weaken it, 
which is what is happening right now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me 
in closing say: I think we should be re-
spectful and try to work with one an-
other and cooperate. That also includes 
the over 100 nominees sitting on this 
calendar who have been obstructed by 
two or three Republican Members for 
weeks, if not months. If there is going 
to be fairness, let’s make sure that the 
road travels in both directions. 
I yield back all remaining time.

I come to the floor to speak in support 
of legislation that is critical to our de-
mocracy—the Freedom to Vote Act. 
And this is a bill that was the product 
of work by many, many Senators from 
across the country with different views 
but all committed to one thing: our de-
mocracy. 
And I want to thank Senator SCHU-
MER for bringing the group together as 
well as the other Senators: Senator 
MANCHIN, whose name is on the bill, 
whose experience as secretary of state 
really was so helpful to us in forming 
this bill and also realizing the dif-
ferences between so many jurisdic-
tions, including world jurisdictions, 
that have different staffing levels and 
different needs; Senator MERKLEY, an 
expert 
on 
election 
law; 
Senator 
PADILLA, also a former secretary of 
state; Senator KING, bringing his inde-
pendent spirit from the State of Maine; 
Senator KAINE, former civil rights law-
yer; Senator TESTER, who sees this and 
understands all of this firsthand in the 
State of Montana, where, by the way, 
for decades they have had same-day 
registration, which when you look at 
the States, whether they are red or 
blue—States that have same-day reg-
istration, like my State—tend to have 
some of the highest voter turnouts in 
the country, and, sadly, they have dis-
posed of that in the State of Montana 
recently; and Senator WARNOCK, from 
the great State of Georgia, who was 
the host, along with Senator OSSOFF, of 
a Rules Committee field hearing we re-
cently held in Georgia, where we saw 
firsthand why so many leaders in the 
business community across the coun-
try and in Georgia have voiced their 
concern about a bill that recently 
passed there that would literally say 
that you cannot vote on weekends dur-
ing the runoff period, during a critical 
period of votes in Georgia. 
That was a group that came together, 
different views, different levels of expe-
rience, but all committed to one idea: 
that democracy will prevail. 
The freedom to vote is fundamental 
to all of our freedoms. That is why this 
bill is called the Freedom to Vote Act. 
It ensures that people are part of the 
franchise and that government is ac-
countable to the people, but this funda-
mental right that is the very founda-
tion of our system of government is 
under attack. 
Since the 2020 election, we have seen 
a persistent and coordinated assault on 
the freedom to vote in States across 
the country. These attacks on our de-
mocracy demand a Federal response. 
The Constitution anticipated that per-
haps we would need a Federal response 
when, in the words of the Constitution, 
as written by our Founding Fathers, 
that Congress can make or alter the 
rules regarding Federal elections. 
The need for action could not be 
more serious. It has been almost a year 
since the violent mob of insurrection-
ists stormed into this Chamber and 
desecrated our Capitol. They came into 
this very room, rifled through the 
desks, were up there right on the dais 
where the Presiding Officer now pre-
sides. They came here, but what they 
did was not just an attack on a build-
ing, it was an attack on our Republic— 
an attack on our Republic. 
I still can picture it like it just hap-
pened. Senator BLUNT and I were the 
last two remaining Senators in the 
Chamber at 3:30 in the morning, along 
with the incredible staff from the Par-
liamentarian’s office, with the pages, 
along with Vice President Pence, and 
the two young women with that ma-
hogany box filled with the remaining 
electoral ballots. We made our way 
over to the House of Representatives, 
where glass was smashed against the 
sides, where there was still spray paint 
on statues and on columns, and we fin-
ished our job. 
Two weeks later, as we stood on that 
inaugural stage—Democrat and Repub-
lican leaders from both parties from 
this Chamber, all the Senators from 
this Chamber, leaders nationally—Re-
publicans, Democrats stood on that

stage under that beautiful blue sky 
with little flakes of snow, and it was 
like everything was in technicolor. I 
said that day, this is a moment where 
democracy brushes itself off, stands 
straight and moves forward, one Na-
tion under God, indivisible with liberty 
and justice for all. 
Maybe I was naive. I thought this 
was the moment in the middle of this 
raging pandemic that we were going to 
move forward as a country. And we did, 
but 
lurking—lurking—in 
the 
back-
ground were claims, false, incredibly 
dangerous claims that somehow the 
election was invalid and, along with 
that, a coordinated effort across the 
country to introduce bills—over 425 of 
them now—to make it harder, not easi-
er, for people to vote. 
What has been the result of this de-
mocracy on fire? What happened here 
in the Capitol is that canister of bear 
spray has been replaced by bill after 
bill after bill. Those flagpoles that 
were used to poke and jab at our brave 
officers who are here to defend us, re-
sulting in several of their deaths—that 
has been replaced by repeated efforts to 
lie about the results of the election. 
What has happened to our democ-
racy? Members in this Chamber know 
well. This year alone, Capitol Police 
have responded to nearly 9,000 threats 
against Members of Congress since the 
beginning of the year—9,000 threats. 
That is nearly double the threats faced 
by Members just 3 years ago. 
Election officials across the country 
have also been targeted by an over-
whelming increase in the number of 
threats. Senator BLUNT and I held a 
Rules Committee hearing on this deep-
ly disturbing trend this fall. We heard 
from the Kentucky Republican sec-
retary of state who said if we do not 
act, States and localities will be unable 
to retain or recruit people to admin-
ister future elections. He talked about 
the need to make it very clear that 
local elected officials who are admin-
istering the election should be safe; 
that they should not be threatened. 
Then we heard from others. Repub-
lican Philadelphia City Commissioner 
Al Schmidt shared some of the horri-
fying threats that he and his family 
have received after he stood up to lies 
about election fraud, including a mes-
sage that said: ‘‘Tell the truth or your 
three kids will be fatally shot,’’ with 
the names of his 7-year-old son and his 
11- and 14-year-old daughters, their ad-
dress, photos of their house out on the 
internet. 
Arizona Secretary of State Katie 
Hobbs, received a voice mail saying: 
I am a hunter—and I think you should be 
hunted. 
These aren’t just a few examples; this 
is happening across our country. This 
is why we have united on this side of 
the aisle behind the Freedom to Vote 
Act. It takes these threats against 
these election officials head-on by es-
tablishing a right to vote and have 
every vote counted and protects elec-
tion officials from improper removal 
by partisan actors. You have to have— 
malfeasance has to occur to be re-
moved. 
There are protections against sham 
audits like the ones we saw in Arizona 
and the ones being advanced in Wis-
consin, Michigan, Texas, and Pennsyl-
vania and strengthens the protections 
for election workers by making it a 
Federal crime to ‘‘intimidate, threat-
en, or coerce’’ election workers. 
It was during Senator Bob Dole’s fu-
neral service in Washington that Presi-
dent Biden reminded us what Senator 
Dole had once said. You see, Senator 
Dole stood against the tide. He sup-
ported civil rights legislation when 
that was a really hard thing to do. He 
supported the Martin Luther King holi-
day. And the words he said at that time 
ring true today. He said this: 
No first-class democracy can treat people 
like second-class citizens. 
No first-class democracy can treat people 
like second-class citizens. 
His warning is exactly what is going 
on today: efforts to treat some Ameri-
cans as second-class citizens by making 
them stand for hours and hours and 
hours to vote in lines; by telling them: 
Oh, by the way, you are not going to be 
able to, like you did before, get water 
or food from certain people who might 
give it to you while you are standing in 
line. That is the story we heard in 
Georgia; by telling them—like a bill 
that passed in Wisconsin that would 
have been put into law except for the 
Governor there. It said we are only 
going to have one dropoff box in the en-
tire city of Milwaukee; or like what we 
saw in the last election in Texas, in 
Harris County, a county that has about 
as much people as my entire State: We 
are only going to have one dropoff box 
there in that county; taking away op-
tions for registering to vote; making it 
harder for people with disabilities or 
elderly voters to receive the assistance 
they need to make their voices heard; 
telling people: Oh, hey, if you have 
COVID and you are in the hospital and 
you want to apply for a mail-in ballot 
because you obviously aren’t going to 
be able to go in and vote, you need to 
get a notary public to sign the applica-
tion. South Carolina had taken that re-
quirement away, and then they put it 
back in. 
Over 400 bills were introduced in 
nearly every State to limit the free-
dom to vote, and over 30 already were 
signed into law. That is why we must 
now establish national standards for 
voting—completely allowed for in the 
Constitution—to make sure all voters 
can cast their ballots in the way that 
works best for them, regardless of what 
ZIP Code they live in. 
The need for Federal action is ur-
gent. Redistricting is underway to 
draw congressional maps that will de-
fine our democracy for the next decade. 
You know how many of these maps do 
not come close to reflecting, on a non-
partisan basis, what goes on in the 
State. 
We know what has been happening in 
Wisconsin. Actual—actual—ideas and 
actual proposals are supported by 
someone in this very Chamber to take 
away the right of the bipartisan elec-
tion board to count the ballots and in-
stead have them counted by the legis-
lature. 
With 19 States having enacted laws 
this year to roll back the freedom to 
vote, we can’t simply sit back and 
watch our democracy be threatened. 
As Senator Rev. RAPHAEL WARNOCK 
has said, What is this all about? 
Some people don’t want some people to 
vote. 
Whether our democracy is threatened 
with bear spray, crowbars, and axes, or 
long lines, no dropoff boxes, and secret 
money, it is still under siege, and we 
must stand up and do what is right. We 
want trust in our government—trust 
regardless of where people are politi-
cally. 
You know, my State has one of the 
highest voter turnouts in the country, 
if not the highest every single time. We 
have elected a Republican Governor 
with those standards in Tim Pawlenty; 
we have elected a Democratic Governor 
in Tim Walz; and we have elected an 
Independent Governor in Jesse Ven-
tura. What is the difference? People are 
part of the franchise. They come up, 
and they say: Look, I didn’t vote for 
you, but I agreed with you on that; I 
didn’t like what you did on that. They 
are part of the franchise. 
As we have seen in States like Geor-
gia, 
Florida, 
Iowa, 
Montana, 
and 
Texas, we are up against this coordi-
nated attack. Our democracy cannot 
wait. 
The infamous new law in Georgia 
says you can’t vote on weekends, as I 
mentioned, in the runoff or register to 
vote during the runoff, and there are 
limitations when it comes to dropoff 
boxes for voting by mail and a new re-
quirement—one that used to be in that 
was taken out for the pandemic be-
cause it was so confusing, and then it 
was put back in with this law—that 
you have to put a date on the outside 
of your inside envelope. What date 
would you think that would be? Any-
one casting the ballot would think the 
date that I am voting. No, no. It is 
your birthday that has to be put on the 
outside of the envelope when you put 
that ballot in. 
In Iowa, a new law cut the days of 
early voting by 9 days and will close 
the polls an hour early. This was after 
the State, in the words of its own Re-
publican secretary of state, had ‘‘shat-
tered’’ its voter turnout record last 
year. 
Why do that except that you are try-
ing to make it harder for certain peo-
ple to vote. The words of a court about 
a North Carolina law years ago: Dis-
crimination with surgical precision. 
A new law in Montana that I noticed 
says you can no longer register to vote 
on election day after that having been 
an option in the State for 15 years. 
In Texas, another new law eliminates 
drop boxes and puts new restrictions on 
vote-by-mail by also empowering par-
tisan poll watchers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9238 
December 16, 2021 
That is why we need the Freedom to 
Vote Act, which builds on the frame-
work put forward by our colleague and 
the former West Virginia secretary of 
state, JOE MANCHIN, in June. It in-
cludes key reforms like ensuring voters 
have access to at least 2 weeks of early 
voting and same-day registration and 
that voters can cast a mail-in ballot 
without an excuse. 
Increasing transparency through the 
DISCLOSE Act. I don’t care if you are 
a Democrat, Republican, Independent— 
whatever party you are in—you don’t 
want to have money coming in an elec-
tion, dark money that you can’t even 
figure out where it is from, telling you 
stuff that you can’t even figure out if 
it is true. This part of the bill would 
simply require super PACs and issue 
advocacy groups to disclose donors who 
contribute more than $10,000 so at least 
we know who is putting in all that 
money to run ads so you understand 
why they are doing it. 
It would prohibit partisan gerry-
mandering so voters choose their elect-
ed officials, not the elected officials 
choosing who votes for them. 
And we need to enact the bill now to 
give States time to implement these 
reforms. 
As I noted, the Freedom to Vote Act 
has the support of all 50 Senate Demo-
crats. We have talked to our Repub-
lican colleagues about this as well as 
the John Lewis bill. Why have we done 
that? Well, for decades voting rights 
has been a bipartisan issue. In 2006, the 
Voting Rights Act was reauthorized by 
a vote of 98 to 0. Yes, 2006; it is not that 
long ago—98 to 0. 
This bill already includes bipartisan 
profiles that included many of our Re-
publican colleagues. I know the Honest 
Ads Act is in this bill. That is a bill I 
did first with John McCain, whom we 
so dearly miss, and now with Senator 
GRAHAM; the Secure Elections Act, 
which is about backup paper ballots 
and making sure that we don’t have 
foreign interference on our elections. 
That is the bill Senator LANKFORD and 
I introduced together with the support 
of Senators BURR and WARNER and Sen-
ator GRAHAM. 
But in October, when we had a vote 
to open debate on the Freedom to Vote 
Act, not a single one of our Republican 
colleagues voted to even debate the 
bill. I see Senator MURKOWSKI is here 
who did allow a vote to open debate on 
the John Lewis bill, which is very im-
portant to our country. She stood up 
and said: Look, I may not agree with 
everything in this bill, but we should 
allow for debate. 
Let’s be clear again, article I, section 
4 of the Constitution of the United 
States of America empowers Congress 
to make or alter rules for Federal elec-
tions at any time. I believe this provi-
sion was designed to help us in times 
like these, in times where we are see-
ing an assault on elections, where peo-
ple are increasingly starting to dis-
trust the results of elections. 
In the face of complete obstruction 
on something so fundamental as the 
Freedom to Vote Act, we must restore 
the Senate with rule changes that will 
allow us to debate this bill. 
Now, I just want to briefly address 
this. Throughout Senate history, rules 
governing debate have changed mul-
tiple times. 
We just somehow found a way to vote 
on what was good, and that was the 
debt ceiling vote—hmm, a little bit of 
a change to allow us to do that with a 
51-vote margin. In fact, there are al-
ready 161 exceptions—exceptions to the 
filibuster. 
Even the number of votes needed to 
end debate has changed. In 1975, Sen-
ator Mondale led the successful and bi-
partisan effort that reduced the cloture 
threshold from 67 to 60 votes. 
There have been cries for standing 
debates—standing—what is called a 
standing filibuster. Why is that? Be-
cause instead of an empty Chamber 
right now, except for me and Senator 
MURKOWSKI and the Presiding Officer 
from the great State of Nevada, there 
is no one else here. 
And yet we have so many serious 
things before us. We have a continuing 
raging pandemic. We have climate 
change that is causing weather events 
we never thought possible, including 
thunderstorms in the middle of the 
State of Minnesota in the middle of De-
cember. Never in history have we had a 
tornado warning in our State in the 
middle of December. 
We have had tragedies across the 
Midwest with storms of magnitude we 
never thought possible. We have ris-
ing—no. Are we discussing that? No. 
Are we discussing voting and what is 
happening in this country right now, 
except for me giving this long speech? 
No, we are not. 
So I think we know that this isn’t 
the Senate that is supposed to be the 
world’s greatest deliberative body, that 
is supposed to allow us to have votes 
on amendments and discussions on se-
rious issues, not to ram through things 
but to have discussions on serious 
issues so we can make decisions. 
Do you think the rest of the world 
isn’t watching what is going on here 
right now? Simple attempts to do 
something about childcare or preschool 
or reducing the prices of prescription 
drugs, when we pay more in our coun-
try for prescription drugs than any 
other country in the world, and we are 
getting blocked from bringing those 
bills forward to have actual discussions 
on them or trying to fit them in little 
boxes of how they fit some archaic Sen-
ate rule. 
Even Senator Robert Byrd said, when 
he was advocating for rule reforms way 
back in 1979: ‘‘Certain rules that were 
necessary . . . must be changed to re-
flect changed circumstances.’’ 
Well, I think an all-out assault on 
our democracy—that is a changed cir-
cumstance, where at least we should be 
debating the solution in this Chamber. 
I think being unable to advance things 
that we know we have to tackle, not 
just immediate crisis, because we are 
pretty good at those—we are pretty 
good when a financial crisis occurs or 
when we have storms or floods or tor-
nadoes or hurricanes. We are pretty 
good at getting the funds out and res-
cue help out there. 
But not everything is an immediate 
crisis. It is just a crisis about to hap-
pen, and our job, our duty when we 
take that oath is to protect the Con-
stitution. That is what we want to de-
bate right now on this floor, instead of 
in another empty Chamber. And with 
the standing filibuster, requiring peo-
ple to be here and debate and speak, it 
is not just an old movie, then; it is real 
life. Requiring people to actually be 
here and do their jobs—big surprise, 
news bulletin—we are here debating 
real issues and legislation and voting 
on amendments and doing our jobs, in-
stead of just running back in here 
every four hours and making a vote 
and then going back out and making 
phone calls. 
Protecting the freedom to vote has 
never been easy. Throughout our coun-
try’s 245-year history, we have had to 
course-correct to ensure that our de-
mocracy for the people, by the people 
actually lived up to its ideals. Voting 
is how Americans control their govern-
ment and hold elected officials ac-
countable. 
So for anyone watching this at home, 
do you want to hold people account-
able? It is by making sure that they 
have the right to vote, so they can ex-
ercise their right to vote, and their 
views at the polls in a safe way, across 
this Nation. 
And do you want to hold them ac-
countable? It is by actually having 
votes on bills and actually debating the 
issues of our time as the rest of the 
world watches what should be the bea-
con of democracy. 
It strengthens our hand with the rest 
of the world. It makes us stronger 
when our democracy is functioning and 
working, and not when we have a 
bunch of people in here with bear spray 
and bayonets going after our police of-
ficers. 
That is the vision, I am sorry to say, 
that much of the world saw less than a 
year ago. And that is not the lasting 
vision that we want of this Chamber or 
of this democracy. 
Americans have fought and died to 
protect our freedom to vote. They have 
done so on the battlefield and in 
marches during the civil rights move-
ment, and 56 years after the Voting 
Rights Act was passed by this Chamber 
and signed into law, we still continue 
this fight. 
But just as we know from those try-
ing to keep their fellow Americans 
from voting, those trying to undermine 
our very system of government in 
State after State across the country, 
they are not going to stop until we 
make clear that there is something 
larger than ourselves. As John McCain 
used to say, there is nothing more lib-
erating than a cause larger than your-
self.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9239 
December 16, 2021 
That cause, my friends in this Cham-
ber, is our very democracy, and that is 
why we won’t stop. Our Nation was 
founded on the ideals of democracy, 
and we have seen for ourselves in this 
building how we can’t afford to take it 
for granted. 
We have a lot of work to do in re-
building our country. And, no, we 
should not go home tomorrow. No, we 
should not, not when this is at stake. 
We must stand up for the salvation of 
our democracy. 
And each day that we delay, it gets 
harder and harder to undo what is 
being done. We owe it to our country 
and to the future generation of Ameri-
cans to take care of this country. 
We are the stewards, my friends, of 
this Nation right now and our democ-
racy. So many people before us have 
found a way to do the right thing. And 
in the words of Bob Dole, in a first- 
class democracy, the people deserve 
better than being treated like second- 
class citizens. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska is recognized. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I have come to this floor to speak on a 
matter that is very local to Alaska, 
very important to Alaska. But before I 
begin my comments, I want to ac-
knowledge a few of the comments of 
my friend from Minnesota. 
Clearly, we share some of the same 
passions about the protections of our 
democracy, and I would absolutely 
agree that key and most fundamental 
is that right to vote. And I have clearly 
expressed that we, as lawmakers, need 
to be there to ensure that our elections 
are free, fair, and accessible to all, that 
barriers to voting need to be addressed. 
She has noted that I have joined with 
others to try to address what I believe 
are some of those impediments to vot-
ing through a measure that has been 
proposed to the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Act. It is not perfect by any 
stretch of the imagination, in my view, 
but I do think that it is something that 
is worthy of the debate. I was going to 
call it grand debate on the floor, but as 
she appropriately points out, there is 
not a lot of grand debate that goes on. 
More often than not, it is individuals 
who are speaking to those who are tak-
ing the time out of their day to tune in 
to C–SPAN. 
But these are important discussions 
for us to have. But I also recognize 
that enduring legislation comes about 
not because one party is able to make 
that happen on their own. Enduring 
legislation, whether it is the Civil 
Rights Act or whether it was the Vot-
ing Rights Act—the enduring legisla-
tion that stays with us for generations 
and decades—is that that is achieved 
when we have come together. 
We will never—it is very, very dif-
ficult to get entire consent of the body. 
But when we can achieve that bipar-
tisan support and a recognition that 
this is good for both parties, good for 
all areas of America, this is when we do 
our best, when we come together to ad-
dress these. 
And I hear the clear frustration that 
she has expressed, but I also recognize 
that how we do what we do is impor-
tant. And if we peel away the last 
vestiges of protection for minority 
rights in the Senate, the Senate be-
comes a smaller version of the House, 
where you are able to effectively move 
things through just by the raw num-
bers. 
And so these are hard, these are chal-
lenging, these are worthy of our fur-
ther and additional efforts. But I would 
remind us that as we are seeking to 
make these generational differences, as 
we are seeking to provide for these en-
during protections for democracy, that 
how we get there is also a matter of 
importance to this body. 
(The remarks of Ms. MURKOWSKI per-
taining to the submission of S. Res. 482 
are printed in today’s RECORD under 
‘‘Submitted Resolutions.’’) 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Utah. 
VACCINES 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I am here on 
the Senate floor now for the 21st time 
specifically to oppose President Biden’s 
sweeping vaccine mandates. 
I have introduced over a dozen bills 
to one way or another limit, clarify, or 
counteract the mandates. Every time I 
have come to ask the Senate to pass 
what 
should, 
frankly, 
be 
uncontroversial matters, one of my 
colleagues or another from the other 
side of the aisle has come to object. 
This is unfortunate. It is unfortunate, 
really, for a number of reasons. 
These 
mandates, 
while 
currently 
being challenged in court in a number 
of 
jurisdictions, 
show 
the 
terrible 
power that even the threat of a vaccine 
mandate can wield. Businesses across 
the country are suspending, punishing, 
and firing employees who haven’t had 
the COVID shot. The threat of the 
mandate is making it harder for every-
day American families just to put food 
on the table and to do so, moreover, in 
increasingly difficult economic times. 
Now, these are not our enemies. 
These are not people to be feared. 
These are not people to shun or loathe 
entirely, as the mandates seem to sug-
gest. No. No. These are our friends and 
our neighbors. These are mothers and 
fathers. These are people who, like far 
too many Americans, are just strug-
gling to get by. 
I am going to continue to fight for 
them and to protect them because they 
understand something that President 
Biden has yet to accept even though, 
deep down, I know he does know it, and 
that is, this isn’t right. It is not right 
for him to do. It is not right constitu-
tionally for about a dozen reasons, but 
it is also just not right morally. 
It is a morally unacceptable propo-
sition to suggest that someone should 
get fired just because they don’t con-
form to Presidential medical ortho-
doxy. It is immoral to tell someone 
that their ability to put food on the 
table for their children depends on 
whether they get a shot—a shot that 
they may or may not want; a shot that 
may or may not conflict with their re-
ligious or sincerely held beliefs, that 
might be contraindicated by one or 
more conditions, resulting in their doc-
tors advising them not to get the shot. 
This is not something that anyone 
should do. In fact, the American people 
agree. According to a recent Axios poll, 
only 14 percent of Americans—just 14 
out of every 100 Americans—agree with 
the apparent position of the President 
of the United States that if someone 
doesn’t get the shot, they should be 
fired. I would imagine it is even fewer 
than that. Fourteen out of a hundred 
isn’t very many to begin with, but I am 
pretty sure it is even fewer than that— 
far fewer—who would say that it is OK 
for one person within the Federal Gov-
ernment to decide to fire everyone who 
doesn’t comply within the government 
and also to tell private employers that 
they will receive crippling, company- 
destroying fines—that no company, not 
even the wealthiest out there, could 
live with—if they don’t fire every one 
of their employees or otherwise take 
adverse action against them in their 
declining to take the shot. It is not OK. 
In this effort, I have, to be sure, been 
supremely clear. I am not in any way 
against the COVID–19 vaccinations— 
quite to the contrary. I have been vac-
cinated. I have encouraged people to 
seek out all the relevant information 
and be vaccinated. I believe that the 
COVID–19 vaccines are keeping count-
less Americans safe from the harm 
threatened by the COVID–19 virus. 
This is different than that. As a mat-
ter of fact, there is an undercut, and it 
can’t offset the fact that this mandate 
is pushing government control beyond 
the constitutional limits and into the 
private decisions of the American peo-
ple. 
That is why I am against all of these 
mandates for all age groups, and that 
is why I have come to the Senate floor 
repeatedly to help and to call on my 
colleagues and President Biden himself 
to end this madness once and for all, to 
end it before it is too late, to end it be-
fore irreparable harm is inflicted on 
those who, for whatever reason, can’t 
or are otherwise inclined not to comply 
with his directions. 
I have even offered a bill, one that 
should 
be 
unusually, 
uniquely 
uncontroversial, but even that one met 
objection. It was a simple reaffirma-
tion of parental rights that our govern-
ment has respected and honored and 
even protected from the beginning. 
My Parental Consent for Vaccination 
Act would simply require that any 
COVID–19 vaccine mandate issued by 
the Federal Government—to be clear, 
it shouldn’t be issuing any at all, but 
any of them that it happens to issue 
must be a mandate that includes a re-
quirement that informed parental con-
sent be provided before the shot can be 
administered to a minor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9240 
December 16, 2021 
Now, this one is so far afield from the 
broader question of whether we should 
have these mandates at all. It is the 
slightly narrower question of whether 
the President of the United States 
should 
administer 
them. 
It 
really 
should not be controversial. 
Now, allow me to put this issue in 
some context here. Parental consent is 
required for all sorts of things. Paren-
tal consent, as every parent with 
school-aged children knows, is required 
for field trips. Parental consent is re-
quired for pretty much all extra-
curricular activities. For that matter, 
it is required for many in-class activi-
ties. Parental consent is required be-
fore most schools can administer so 
much as a Tylenol or a baby aspirin to 
a child. Everyone knows that. None of 
that is happening without parental 
consent. 
That is, to be sure, the right ap-
proach. It is as it should be. Despite 
what some candidates have said in 
some recent political campaigns, par-
ents should be informed and involved 
in their children’s education and cer-
tainly in their child’s health decisions, 
in matters of medical treatment. 
Parents, it is important to remem-
ber, are simply better equipped to 
make these decisions. Parents know 
their children, and they know their 
children’s medical histories. Parents 
know their moral, their religious, and 
their health requirements that are, in 
many cases, unique to their families. It 
is certainly something that no govern-
ment and no school can keep track of 
in the same way that a government or 
a school does. Parents also love their 
children—that is important here—and 
parents, because they love their chil-
dren, have their children’s best inter-
ests at heart when they make decisions 
affecting them. 
The government can’t do any of 
those things. It certainly can’t do any 
of those things anywhere close to as 
well as a parent could. The reason for 
that is fairly simple. It is because gov-
ernment doesn’t have arms with which 
to embrace children. The government 
doesn’t have a heart with which to love 
children. The government doesn’t even 
have eyes to see or ears to hear because 
government, of course, when reduced to 
its essence, when we really define it as 
what it is, is simply force. It is legally 
authorized violence. 
Now, thank Heaven that God and the 
law have always assigned the primary 
care of their children to parents and 
not to government. Government is just 
the official actual or threatened use of 
force. We need government. It is also 
one of the many reasons we have to be 
careful with it just like other things 
that we rely on in so many ways— 
things like electricity, like moving 
water, like fire. They are all necessary 
to our day-to-day lives, and yet when 
left uncontrolled, they are dangerous 
and quickly become fatal when we 
don’t exercise due caution. 
This has, of course, been acknowl-
edged for millennia. It has been written 
about widely for many, many cen-
turies, even centuries before the found-
ing of our Republic. And it has been ac-
knowledged since the very earliest 
days of our Republic. 
George Washington himself warned 
the people about this, warning that 
government is itself forced and is 
therefore dangerous and has to be care-
fully managed. That is why we have a 
Constitution. That is why we have all 
these rules about government. 
If men were angels, we wouldn’t need 
government. If we had access to angels 
to run our government, as James Madi-
son described it in Federalist 51, then 
we wouldn’t have to bother about gov-
ernment abusing its power, and we 
wouldn’t need all these rules. 
But we are not angels. Men and 
women are not angels. And we don’t 
have access to angels to run our gov-
ernment, and so we have to have rules 
governing the use of government. And 
it is for our own safety. 
Nowhere is this more important than 
with respect to our children. That is 
where we can really see laid bare the 
essential, core facts of what govern-
ment is, which is the actual or threat-
ened use of coercive force. 
Now, I also thank heaven above that 
God 
didn’t 
assign 
the 
anonymous 
masses on the internet to care for chil-
dren. The pressure children receive 
through social media, through news 
publications, and common video sites 
lacks nuance and any specific under-
standing of a child’s health condition 
or history or religious beliefs. 
There are even reports in prominent 
magazines of children being advised to 
commit fraud or cross State lines to be 
vaccinated specifically against their 
parents’ advice, circumventing paren-
tal authority. 
There is a reason why the FDA re-
quires the fine print and the sometimes 
very painfully exhaustive and descrip-
tive side-effect warnings on pharma-
ceutical advertisements and why those 
ads always encourage viewers to con-
sult their doctors. But in the brave new 
world of Big Brother healthcare, stu-
dents aren’t encouraged to consult 
their parents, let alone their doctors. 
Unfortunately, in some places, like 
here in our Nation’s Capital, govern-
ment has completely lost the plot. In 
the District of Columbia school sys-
tem, for example, minors can receive 
medical procedures without the school 
even informing the parents. In other 
places across the Nation, this slippery 
slope is already leading governments to 
consider life-changing, school-provided 
medical procedures without parental 
notice and without parental consent. 
As a parent, this thought sends shiv-
ers down my spine. I know I am not 
alone in that respect—far from it. Most 
Americans, regardless of what part of 
the country they come from, regardless 
of creed, political affiliation, socio-
economic status, or any other single 
factor, if they are parents, they are 
going to feel the same way. They don’t 
like the idea of someone else taking 
over the raising of their child. They 
don’t like the idea of government tak-
ing over control of medical decisions 
on behalf of their child. You see, that 
is supplanting their role. That is mov-
ing them out of the way. 
School-aged kids are also some of 
those least at risk of contracting, 
spreading, and suffering long-term or 
serious effects from COVID. The data 
has shown this all along. The vaccines, 
on the other hand, may pose a more se-
rious risk to some young people than 
they do the general population. Var-
ious countries, including France and 
Germany, have ceased recommending 
some COVID vaccines to those under 
the age of 30 because of complications. 
Again, I am not against the vaccines, 
but the thought of schools, social 
media, or, heaven forbid, government 
pressuring students into vaccination 
without parental consent is rightfully 
troubling. It is downright chilling, and 
it should not happen—not here, not in 
the United States of America. 
While the Federal Government has 
almost no legitimate role in influ-
encing local education decisions, we 
can make sure that the Federal Gov-
ernment does not endorse or, heaven 
forbid, mandate this dangerous ap-
proach to medical decisions for minors. 
That is not too much to ask. That is 
not something that should be con-
troversial here in the U.S. Senate. 
That is not something that is remotely 
controversial among the good people of 
this country—left and right, rich and 
poor. 
If they are parents, they are deeply 
disturbed by the thought of the cold, 
impersonal force that is government 
pushing them out of the way to make 
these medical decisions for them and 
for their children. 
So let’s provide assurance to parents 
and children. Let’s reaffirm our com-
mitment to supporting parents in mak-
ing decisions for their children. Let’s 
protect kids, and let’s end these man-
dates. 
They are illegal. They are unconsti-
tutional, and they are morally indefen-
sible.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9241 
December 16, 2021 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, fellow 
Senators, I rise today to urge an af-
firmative vote on all three of the next 
appointments that are up. 
The first one is Nicholas Burns to be 
Ambassador to China; and next is Mr. 
Toloui, who is up for Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Economic and Busi-
ness Affairs; and also Mr. Hussain, who 
is up for Ambassador for International 
Religious Freedom. The Foreign Rela-
tions Committee has looked at all 
three of these very closely. 
Let me spend just a moment with Mr. 
Burns. I have known Mr. Burns since 
his postings in Europe many, many 
years ago. If you are looking for a bi-
partisan person to put in the position, 
this is your guy. When I knew him, he 
was working for an administration, a 
Republican administration. 
He has done an outstanding job, has 
an outstanding reputation amongst the 
cadre of Ambassadors, and I would urge 
that we confirm him and have him in 
place in China. This is a tough posting, 
as we all know, at the current time. We 
have got a lot of issues that exist be-
tween us and China, and certainly Am-
bassador Burns is the one to carry our 
water there. 
The other two I can tell you that, 
without hesitation, both have been 
scrubbed by the committee and been 
asked the questions that are appro-
priate for both of these positions. We 
feel very comfortable in recommending 
them to the body. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know 
we are about to go to the vote. Frank-
ly, with what my distinguished col-
league just said, I don’t know why 
these aren’t all voice votes. 
But I understand Senator MENENDEZ 
is on his way here and wishes to speak. 
Otherwise, I would move that it be a 
voice vote. But out of respect for him 
and his committee, I will suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
APPROPRIATIONS 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while we 
are waiting for the Senator who wishes 
to speak, I would note that I appreciate 
those who worked very hard, including 
my friends on the floor, on the Na-
tional Defense Act. Yesterday, that 
passed with a pretty overwhelming ma-
jority, and I voted for it. But as I have 
noted, that does not provide money; 
that provides an authorization. 
Right now, if we go on continuing 
resolutions, the Department of Defense 
will see a multibillion-dollar cut in 
what is available for them, as will non-
defense matters. 
So I would urge Senators to work 
with our leaders and get the appropria-
tions bills done. They could all be done 
in an omnibus by the end of January, 
the 1st of February. I would urge Sen-
ators to do that. Otherwise, there is 
going to be a dramatic cut in defense 
and nondefense matters. 
I yield to the senior Senator from 
New Jersey. 
f 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to the consideration of the fol-
lowing nominations, en bloc, which the 
clerk will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nations of R. Nicholas Burns, of Massa-
chusetts, to be Ambassador Extraor-
dinary and Plenipotentiary of the 
United States of America to the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China; Ramin Toloui, 
of Iowa, to be an Assistant Secretary of 
State (Economic and Business Affairs); 
and Rashad Hussain, of Virginia, to be 
Ambassador at Large for International 
Religious Freedom. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
will now be 10 minutes of debate, equal-
ly divided in the usual form. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise to express my support for the 
nominations of Ambassador Nicholas 
Burns to be Ambassador to China, Mr. 
Ramin Toloui to be an Assistant Sec-
retary of State for Economic and Busi-
ness Affairs, and Mr. Rashad Hussain 
to be Ambassador at Large for Inter-
national Religious Freedom. 
These are a superb group of highly 
qualified nominees, deserving of the 
positions for which they have been 
nominated, and I will speak briefly 
about them. 
Ambassador Burns is an outstanding 
public servant, one of the Nation’s 
best, and I am pleased to support his 
nomination as the next Ambassador to 
China. He has a long and distinguished 
record in public service, including as 
Under Secretary of State for Political 
Affairs under the Bush administration 
and U.S. Ambassador to NATO. 
If there is a place that we need an 
Ambassador, it is China. We have spent 
so much time, both in committee and 
on the floor, hearing about the chal-
lenges of China, but we don’t have a 
U.S. Ambassador to help us meet those 
challenges. 
It is no secret that the China of 
today is challenging the United States 
and 
destabilizing 
the 
international 
community in almost every dimension 
of power—political, diplomatic, eco-
nomic, military, and even cultural. 
That is why Ambassador Burns’ experi-
ences and skill will be crucial as he 
confronts the monumental task ahead 
of him. 
I am also pleased to be supporting 
Mr. Ramin Toloui’s nomination to be 
the Assistant Secretary for Economic 
and Business Affairs at the State De-
partment. His experience and skill set, 
including as a former Assistant Sec-
retary of the Treasury for Inter-
national Finance, where he represented 
the United States in forums like the G7 
and the G20, will be necessary in order 
to be an effective Assistant Secretary, 
especially one who will play such a 
critical role in our economic diplomacy 
vis-a-vis China and as we must reinvig-
orate the instruments of our economic 
diplomacy at home. I believe Mr. 
Toloui represents the importance of 
getting our economic statecraft right. 
Lastly, I am also pleased to support 
Mr. Rashad Hussain to be our Ambas-
sador at Large for International Reli-
gious Freedom. Throughout his impres-
sive public service, Mr. Hussain has 
demonstrated his strong commitment 
to protecting the rights of religious 
and ethnic minorities, including as the 
U.S. Special Envoy for Strategic Coun-
terterrorism Communications, where 
he led efforts to counter anti-Semitism 
and protect Christian minorities in 
Muslim-majority countries. 
Religious freedom, like every human 
right, is universal, but for many people 
around the world, this right is out of 
reach, and religious persecution is on 
the rise. That is why it is important 
that we confirm Mr. Hussain. 
While it is positive news that we are 
confirming these three nominees today 
and a few more, I hope, in the next day, 
I am deeply concerned that we have 
more than 50 nominees who will remain 
pending on the Senate floor, having 
passed the committee, almost all of 
them by strong bipartisan votes, who 
are subject to delays and obstacles. 
We are less safe when our national 
security Agencies are so short-staffed. 
We owe it to the American people to fix 
this problem so that we can be rep-
resented abroad. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. We yield back also. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. We yield back any 
other time we had. 
VOTE ON BURNS NOMINATION 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is yielded back. 
The question is, Shall the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Burns nomina-
tion? 
Mr. MENENDEZ. I ask for the yeas 
and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Louisiana (Mr. CASSIDY), the Sen-
ator from North Dakota (Mr. CRAMER),

Senator from Nebraska (Mr. FISCHER), 
the Senator from Wisconsin (Mr. JOHN-
SON), the Senator from Wyoming (Mr.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor tonight because I 
want to remind our colleagues and the 
people of the United States of America 
that we did pass an infrastructure bill, 
and it was bipartisan. 
But we are here tonight because the 
very people that it takes to implement 
that bill, the very people that work at 
the Department of Commerce, the very 
people who work at the Department of 
Transportation are being held up in not

December 16, 2021 
being able to be fully confirmed by this 
body to do the work that it takes to 
implement that legislation. 
I know this is incredibly important 
to people across the United States of 
America because we know how popular 
that bill was. My colleagues are with 
me tonight—two members of the Com-
merce Committee—who worked hard 
and contributed mightily to the Sur-
face Transportation Act that passed 
out of the Commerce Committee in a 
robust bipartisan fashion to come here 
to the floor. It was added with other 
legislation from other committees. 
So we are here tonight—myself, my 
colleague from Montana, who has a 
State as big as any State in the United 
States. It probably is the largest State. 
All I know is it takes me at least an 
hour to fly over it. So I guarantee you 
that is a lot of roads, that is a lot of 
bridges, that is a lot of railroad, that is 
a lot of infrastructure. If it is not fixed 
and it is not taken care of, then the 
Montana economy is hurt. 
My colleague from Wisconsin is here, 
and she played a major role in the in-
frastructure bill as well. She made sure 
that we focused on at-grade crossings 
and the safety of our rail system. Why? 
Because we have to move products 
from the Midwest to reach Asian mar-
kets. If they can’t get there because 
they are stuck in congestion, then, we 
aren’t going to be competitive as a na-
tion. 
It is ridiculous that we are in this po-
sition tonight, ridiculous that there 
are dozens of nominees from the De-
partment of Transportation and the 
Department of Commerce that the ma-
jority of our colleagues support, but 
they are being held up by one or two 
people who don’t want to see them 
move through the process. 
I am talking about nominees that are 
part of the Federal Railroad Adminis-
tration—the Administrator. We are 
giving a bunch of money to the Federal 
Railroad Administration so they can 
put grants out, authorize this new pro-
gram for at-grade crossings to improve 
the speed of moving our product, and 
people don’t want the FRA, or the Fed-
eral Railroad Administration, to have 
an Administrator. I don’t know what 
possibly could be wrong with that. 
Someone doesn’t want us to have the 
CFO for the Department of Transpor-
tation. The CFO—you don’t want us to 
have a CFO? How political could the 
CFO of the Department of Transpor-
tation be? I guarantee you, not very 
political. The CFO is a person who is 
going to make sure that we spend the 
money correctly, administer the new 
programs as they get set up, and make 
sure the money goes out the door. It is 
hard to imagine a lot of money will go 
out the door of the Department of 
Transportation if we don’t have a CFO. 
There are other people here that are 
part of the transportation system on 
analysis. There are people I am pretty 
sure my colleague from Montana will 
talk about. 
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration—why? Again, because I 
guarantee you there are a lot of trucks 
in Montana. There is a lot of moving of 
product. You have to have trucking 
safety, and you have to have help in 
administering that. And if you have to 
have help administering that, then, 
you need to have an Administrator of 
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Ad-
ministration. 
These are basic positions. These are 
positions that are part of the infra-
structure that we need for the Depart-
ment of Transportation and, as I men-
tioned, the Department of Commerce. 
These are issues that are important to 
us. 
Let me just say a few words about 
Commerce nominees. We have someone 
who is supposed to do the analysis of 
industry for the Department of Com-
merce. We have someone who is sup-
posed to help us with trade and inter-
national matters. 
I am pretty sure my colleague from 
Florida, who is objecting to some of 
these nominees, is going to say: It is 
about the supply chain. 
These are the very people that we 
need for the supply chain. You need the 
analysis and the construct of the De-
partment of Commerce to say: These 
are the problems that we have with the 
Department moving forward on various 
issues that we have with a major focus 
on our infrastructure. 
The infrastructure bill provided $1.2 
trillion in funding for transportation, 
for energy, for disparities that we have 
in our infrastructure and that has to 
get spent, and it has to get spent as 
soon as possible. 
Markets in China and India are ex-
pected to be worth $26 trillion by 2030, 
but some people think: Well, we will 
just take that money we gave to move 
ahead on our infrastructure—some-
thing that has been dilapidated for a 
long time. 
That is what people don’t under-
stand. Over several administrations, 
our investment in transportation infra-
structure fell to less than 1 percent of 
GDP, and we didn’t correct it. The last 
administration didn’t correct it, but 
this administration came in—a Demo-
cratic administration—and said we are 
going to correct that because econo-
mists will tell you that you are not 
keeping pace if your infrastructure in-
vestment is less than 1 percent. Now 
President Biden is going to get that 
number up over the next several years, 
and that is the kind of investment we 
need to make. 
We don’t need to slow down because 
there is a big world economy, and 95 
percent of consumers live outside the 
United States. But, OK, let’s just take 
our sweet time in implementing this 
bill and getting U.S. products to inter-
national markets, when 95 percent of 
consumers 
are 
outside 
the 
United 
States. Let’s just take our sweet time 
because someone wants to object to 
these nominees—the CFO, the Adminis-
trator, these people who have been 
moved out of committee in a bipar-
tisan fashion. 
This is a once-in-a-lifetime, once-in- 
a-generation investment that we have 
to make. But they have to have people 
over there to make the investment and 
they have to have people to be fully 
staffed. And we have to make sure that 
these important steps that the Presi-
dent is taking on supply chain are met. 
That is why these issues of working on 
various logistics of operations, of pric-
ing, of transparency, and overseeing 
shippers and making sure that some of 
our largest shippers are committed to 
moving cargo during off-peak hours are 
important. 
My colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle know how important agricultural 
products being delivered to market on 
time is. And we need to make sure that 
our farmers, our people who have U.S.- 
manufactured products, like in the 
State of Wisconsin, are getting a fair 
deal on their shipping. 
And that is why we also have to have 
the nominee for the Federal Maritime 
Commission and get somebody on the 
Commission who is going to hold peo-
ple accountable to make sure that our 
products get somewhere safely and se-
curely and in a timely fashion. 
So these issues that we are facing on 
the supply chain are complex. They are 
not going to be fixed overnight, but 
they have to have people in the jobs. 
They have to have people who are 
going to answer the questions, work to-
gether, and to get this done. 
So I would ask my colleagues, who I 
know are going to join me in making 
several nominations, I ask unanimous 
consent to consider the following nomi-
nation: Executive Calendar No. 315, 
Karen Jean Hedlund, of Colorado, to be 
a Member of the Surface Transpor-
tation Board for a term expiring De-
cember 31, 2025; that the Senate vote 
on the nomination without intervening 
action or debate; that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table with no intervening ac-
tion or debate; that any statements re-
lated to the nomination be printed in 
the Record; and that the President be 
immediately notified of the Senate’s 
action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Hedlund nomi-
nation? 
The nomination was confirmed. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUESTS 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I ask 
that it be in order to make the same 
request with respect to Calendar No. 
550, Max Veckich to be the Federal 
Maritime Commissioner for a term ex-
piring June 30, 2026. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Reserving the 
right to object, as my colleague is 
aware, I have an outstanding request

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9244 
December 16, 2021 
my colleague chairs, for us to hear tes-
timony 
from 
Commerce 
Secretary 
Raimondo 
and 
Transportation 
Sec-
retary Buttigieg or their Senate-con-
firmed leadership about the supply 
chain crisis. 
I have been clear that until we hear 
from these Agency leaders, either in 
the Commerce Committee or in an 
open meeting, that I would be holding 
all Department of Transportation and 
Department of Commerce nominees 
from moving forward in an expedited 
manner. 
We have had crisis after crisis due to 
the failed leadership of President Biden 
and his appointees. Just look at the in-
flation crisis caused by the Democrats’ 
reckless spending that is hurting fami-
lies and putting too many Americans 
in the position of deciding whether to 
fill their gas tank, heat their house 
this winter, or put food on the table. 
Just this week, I spoke with a vet-
eran in Land O’ Lakes, FL. He is a 
small business owner, and he has seen 
prices on raw materials rise by 50 per-
cent just this year. Even though he has 
seen greater demand, he is not making 
more money because of the rising 
prices. 
If he tries to pass those costs on to 
his customers, he will lose business. On 
top of that, rising gas prices are mak-
ing it difficult to afford taking his kids 
to basketball and karate practices. 
I have also talked to an operator of a 
food bank in Osceola, FL. She used to 
see 15 families each day, and now she is 
seeing upward of 70 families each day. 
Food prices have gone through the 
roof, making it more expensive for her 
to get food to give to people who are 
hurting at the very time demand is up. 
I talked to a mom in Punta Gorda, FL. 
Her gas costs have more than doubled, 
and 
her 
monthly 
grocery 
budget 
doesn’t go as far as it used to. 
Recently, she has started visiting her 
local food pantry once a month so she 
has enough to feed her kids. That is 
something she has never had to do be-
fore. These are real Floridians who are 
hurting. Thank goodness for organiza-
tions like food pantries and everyone 
else who is helping families who are 
struggling because the Biden adminis-
tration has spent months doing noth-
ing to solve this crisis. 
In fact, they are actively hurting 
them as inflation rises to record highs 
and is threatening to rise even more as 
Biden pushes his reckless tax-and- 
spend agenda. 
I cannot and I will not consent to al-
lowing these nominees to move forward 
in an expedited manner. We should 
take a vote so every Senator can get on 
the record with their support or opposi-
tion to these nominees. 
Therefore, Mr. President, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
think my colleague knows darn well 
the President of the United States has 
been doing something about this. That 
is why he used his leadership to make 
sure that we made major infrastruc-
ture investment so we could move 
products. That is why he has gotten 
the ports to work 24 hours to move 
product more expeditiously. 
That is why he has been focused on 
all of the infrastructure needs in mov-
ing our country forward and con-
tinuing 
to 
deal 
with 
chokepoints, 
whether they are on the highways, our 
ports, or our rail system. 
My colleague knows, too, that the 
Secretary of Transportation and the 
Secretary of Commerce—whom I am 
sure he has talked to—are working 
very diligently on this. I am sure they 
are willing to talk to him. 
There is no secret here. There is the 
administration and a bipartisan group 
of people who are working together to 
try to solve these issues, but there are 
those on the other side of the aisle, 
probably those who didn’t support the 
infrastructure investment, who also 
don’t support having people spend the 
money and make the investments. 
I am going to yield to my colleagues 
who are also here to try to move some 
of these important nominees to make 
this investment work in the United 
States. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Shortly, I will re-
quest unanimous consent to confirm 
the nomination of Mr. Chris Coes to be 
Assistant Secretary for Policy at the 
Department of Transportation. 
As we have discussed, we face supply 
chain challenges created by several 
compounding factors, increased de-
mand for goods, a growing reliance on 
e-commerce, as well as production and 
labor market disruptions caused by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Additionally, we have underinvested 
in our freight infrastructure for dec-
ades. The bipartisan infrastructure law 
reverses that trend. It provides a his-
toric $567 billion for the Department of 
Transportation. This includes $37 bil-
lion for freight infrastructure invest-
ments. 
The Department of Transportation 
will be responsible for implementing 
and managing these funds, including 
INFRA and the Port Infrastructure De-
velopment Program. The Department 
needs leaders like Mr. Coes to coordi-
nate implementation of these programs 
and get the funding Congress has ap-
proved out to the States and local gov-
ernments. 
Mr. Coes is very qualified to serve as 
Assistant Secretary for Transportation 
Policy for the Department of Transpor-
tation, having served as the Principal 
Deputy Assistant Secretary for Trans-
portation Policy. 
He received strong and bipartisan 
support in the Commerce Committee. 
In fact, there are several nominees, in-
cluding Mr. Coes, who have been passed 
out of the Commerce Committee with 
bipartisan support for key posts at the 
Department of Transportation, the De-
partment of Commerce, the Surface 
Transportation Board, and the Federal 
Maritime Commission who all play in-
tegral roles in addressing the ongoing 
supply chain issues. 
And yet some of our Republican col-
leagues are refusing to provide these 
Agencies with the leadership resources 
necessary to help address the supply 
chain crisis. 
The issues facing our supply chain 
are complex and have been years in the 
making. They will not be fixed over-
night, and that is why it is important 
to have confirmed, sustained leader-
ship at the Agencies responsible for 
helping to address these multifaceted 
issues over the next several years. 
So I ask that it be in order to make 
the same request with respect to Exec-
utive Calendar No. 549, Christopher A. 
Coes to be Assistant Secretary of 
Transportation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I still can’t understand, if the Biden 
administration 
is 
doing 
so 
many 
things, why wouldn’t they want to 
come brag about it? Why wouldn’t they 
want to tell all Americans exactly 
what they are doing? 
The reason they don’t want to do it is 
it is not getting better. I am still hear-
ing day in and day out from people all 
over my State who are hurting because 
the Biden administration is not doing 
anything to solve the supply chain cri-
sis. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in support of Meera 
Joshi to be the head of the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administration. 
Now, there may be some folks out 
there who are not familiar with this 
Agency, but I can tell you Montanans 
are. I can tell you commercial truckers 
are because this is an Agency that is 
critical to tackling our supply chain 
issues and lowering costs for American 
families. Let me repeat that again be-
cause this issue has been brought up 
before. 
This Agency, of which Ms. Joshi is to 
be the head of, is critical to attacking 
our supply chain issues and lowering 
the costs for American families. 
In my real life, I am a farmer. I use 
a Peterbilt truck to get my product to 
market, my food to market, so I know 
more about this than the average per-
son who serves in the Senate. 
And I know what a huge role that 
trucking plays in our supply chain and 
our economy. And I am going to tell 
you, the American trucker is one of the 
hardest working people in this country. 
I know that because I tried to do it for 
a while. It is hard work. 
They have been on the frontlines of 
this pandemic delivering goods to 
every corner of this country. And a 
strong and a stable, safe trucking 
workforce that offers good-paying jobs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

December 16, 2021 
to millions of truckdrivers is a critical 
lifeblood of our economy. 
Our quality of life in this country is 
simply not possible without the hard 
work that truckdrivers put in day and 
night. They deserve more credit than 
they get. 
And there are a lot of challenges out 
there: our outdated infrastructure, the 
COVID–19 pandemic, a historic—a his-
toric—volume of goods moving through 
our economy that have strained capac-
ity across our supply chain, including 
trucking. 
The Agency is critical in ensuring 
that goods moving by truck do it safely 
and efficiently. 
Now, as the chairman of the Com-
merce Committee has already pointed 
out, the President last month signed 
the bipartisan infrastructure package 
into law. It included $568 billion in 
transportation funding that will im-
prove 
freight 
bottlenecks, 
ease 
chokepoints across ports, rails, and 
highways. 
The middle-class markets in China 
and India are expected to be worth a 
combined $26 trillion by 2030. Now, if 
we want to grow this U.S. economy, 
maintain our position as an economic 
world leader, we must be able to grow 
our reach to those huge market oppor-
tunities. 
The bipartisan infrastructure pack-
age also included parts of my HAULS 
Act. The HAULS Act will cut burden-
some hour-of-service requirements so 
that Montana’s egg and livestock haul-
ers can do their jobs and do their jobs 
safely, but we need a head of the Fed-
eral Motor Carriers Safety Administra-
tion to be able to say that earnestly. 
If we are going to effectively imple-
ment these new guidelines that will 
boost our economy in rural America 
and across this country, we need to 
confirm Ms. Joshi as soon as possible, 
which is why I am here tonight. 
Ms. Joshi is a qualified nominee to 
lead this Agency. She passed through 
the Senate Commerce Committee with 
overwhelming bipartisan support. She 
is backed by the trucking industry. 
It is unfortunate that a few of my 
colleagues—a minority of the minor-
ity—are blocking this confirmation at 
a time when we need transportation 
and commerce Agencies fully staffed 
and empowered to carry out their 
work, 
reducing 
costs 
for 
families, 
smoothing the supply chain, and grow-
ing our economy. 
The Senate has had an opportunity 
to address supply chain issues and 
lower costs by confirming this nomi-
nee. I am going to say it again. The 
Senate has an opportunity tonight to 
address supply chain issues and lower 
costs by confirming this nominee. 
There is absolutely no reason to keep 
this critical position vacant, and I urge 
my colleagues to support her confirma-
tion tonight. 
Mr. President, I would also ask that 
it be in order to make the same request 
with respect to Executive Calendar No. 
464, Meera Joshi, to be Administrator 
of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety 
Administration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, you 
know, my father was an over-the-road 
truckdriver. He drove for Admiral 
Freight Line. My uncle was an over- 
the-road truckdriver. He drove for a 
consolidated freight line. 
I watched the difficulties my father 
and my uncle had performing their 
jobs, and it was at a time when truck-
ers weren’t paid well, and, actually, 
most truckers were laid off by Thanks-
giving because most of the goods were 
there for the Christmas season. 
In my father’s case, I don’t remember 
a Christmas that my dad was actively 
working. So I think it is very, very im-
portant that we do everything we can 
to help truckers, and I am glad that 
truckers today are paid better than 
they were back when my father and my 
uncle drove. 
My uncle actually died in a trucking 
accident. So I think it is very impor-
tant that we do everything we can to 
support our truckers. And what I still 
can’t understand is why the Commerce 
Committee does not want to hear ex-
actly what the Secretary of Transpor-
tation or the Secretary of Commerce is 
doing to help our truckers. What are 
they doing to improve the supply 
chain? 
You would think they would want to 
come down here to say exactly what 
they have done to make the life of 
truckers better so that we get more 
people in trucking rather than less. 
So I think we should—I cannot allow 
these nominees to go forward in an ex-
pedited manner. Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. So if you truly want to 
help the trucking industry, and it 
sounds like you have personal experi-
ence with it—the good Senator from 
Florida—putting the head of the Fed-
eral Motor Carrier Safety Administra-
tion would be a great start. If you want 
to reduce the problems with our supply 
chain, putting a head into the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administration 
would be a great start. If you want to 
make our roads safer for everybody— 
truckers, cars, everybody—I would say 
putting in the head of the Federal 
Motor Carrier Safety Administration 
would be a good start. 
I am going to tell you that the objec-
tions of the good Senator from Florida 
ring hollow. I have heard the good Sen-
ator from Florida stand up in com-
mittee and stand up on this floor and 
talk about how the administration— 
this administration—has failed. Yet 
that very same person who claims that 
this administration has failed is stand-
ing up here and perpetuating the prob-
lems that we have because we can’t get 
Agencies staffed up. This is ridiculous. 
So you ask yourself: Why can’t the 
Department of Transportation and De-
partment of Commerce come before the 
committee? 
Look, we are all U.S. Senators here. 
Pick up the phone. Give him a call. 
With 
this 
kind 
of 
attitude—you 
talked about the fact that food was 
going up. Why aren’t we demanding the 
Secretary of Agriculture show up? 
You said there are small business 
problems. Why aren’t we demanding 
the Small Business Administration 
show up? 
This could go on forever. 
If you really want to fix a problem, 
let’s look for solutions. And the solu-
tions we have here tonight—this one— 
is to confirm Ms. Meera Joshi to the 
Federal Motor Carriers Safety Admin-
istration. 
We can make excuses all the time 
about why we are going to do this, why 
we are going to do that. Pick up the 
phone. Give them a call. Ask them to 
meet with you. 
That is all it would take. You don’t 
need to shut down the whole adminis-
tration, shut down the Motor Carriers 
by not putting the head in. 
This is ridiculous. 
Mr. President, I now want to speak of 
my support for the nomination of 
Amitabha Bose to be Administrator of 
the Federal Railroad Administration. 
Consisting of almost 140,000 miles of 
railroad track, the U.S. freight rail 
network is the largest in the world and 
carries 1.4 billion tons of freight every 
year worth $430 billion to our economy. 
Some estimate that the global de-
mand for freight will triple by 2050, 
which is why we need to improve the 
capacity for our system to meet the 
supply chain needs of today and pre-
pare for the future. 
Last month, as the chair of the Com-
merce Committee has already pointed 
out, the President signed my bipar-
tisan infrastructure package into law 
that included $567 billion in transpor-
tation 
funding 
that 
will 
improve 
freight bottlenecks, ease chokepoints 
across our ports, railways, and high-
ways. It will lower costs for families. It 
will grow our economy. 
Gosh, does this sound familiar? It is 
awful lot like the last nominee. 
And this legislation also includes the 
Right Track Act, which I support and 
which I sponsored. My bill addresses 
blocked rail crossings—by the way, a 
bipartisan bill—which improves rail 
safety at rural train crossings and ad-
dresses instances of blocked highway 
railroad crossings across the United 
States that put our families in danger 
and slow down our economy. 
I point that out because all too often 
we have accidents involving a train and 
a car. Get this person confirmed, and 
we can hold people accountable. 
The infrastructure package also in-
cluded $15 million to study Amtrak’s 
long-distance 
passenger 
rail 
travel 
service, 
including 
authorization 
to 
form working groups, like the Greater 
Northwest 
Passenger 
Rail 
Working 
Group, to study and advocate for in-
creased access to long-distance pas-
senger rail travel.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9246 
December 16, 2021 
These freight rail programs are ad-
ministered by the FRA, and grants 
must get out the door as quickly as 
possible if we are going to get the bang 
for the dollar, if the taxpayer is going 
to get the bang for the dollar. 
Holding up Amit Bose’s nomination 
risks delaying these critical resources 
from reaching local communities. 
Now, that might make some people 
in here happy. There was a bunch of 
folks—it passed by 69 votes, but there 
were 30-some folks that voted against 
it. So maybe they don’t want this. 
Maybe they don’t want infrastructure. 
Maybe they want to turn the keys of 
the economy over to China. Maybe that 
is what they want. 
But the fact is that these critical re-
sources will end up enriching our com-
munities, improving our freight rail 
service, and growing our economy. 
Additionally, the FRA is working 
closely with railroads to provide regu-
latory expertise and assistance to en-
sure 
that 
significant 
operational 
changes—including setting up new rail 
yards that can help move goods across 
our country, solving the supply chain 
problem—is done both quickly and 
safely. 
Mr. Bose is a very qualified nominee 
to lead the FRA, having previously 
worked in multiple roles at FRA, in-
cluding Deputy Administrator, Chief 
Counsel, Senior Adviser, and Director 
of Governmental Affairs. 
He, too, received a strong bipartisan 
support in committee and, in fact, ad-
vanced by a voice vote. 
Once again, it is unfortunate—and 
maybe it won’t happen on this one— 
that some of my colleagues are block-
ing nominees from confirmation at a 
time when we can’t afford to leave our 
Agencies understaffed, and they are 
blocking it because of supply chain 
issues and because of the high costs for 
small business. And with the blockage 
of these nominees, what is ending up 
happening is that the supply chain 
issues will get worse, which, maybe, 
that is what they want. 
But that is not why I am here. I am 
here to get things done, to move this 
country forward. I know what China is 
doing right now, and it is why we had 
69 people vote for the bipartisan infra-
structure bill. 
But if we leave the Agencies under-
staffed, then maybe that is going to 
help somebody. I don’t know who it is 
going to help. But there is no reason to 
keep this critical position vacant, and 
I would urge my colleagues to support 
his confirmation. 
Therefore, I would ask that it be in 
order to make the same request with 
respect to Executive Calendar No. 465, 
Amitabha Bose to be Director of the 
Federal Railroad Administration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object, you 
know, my colleagues keep talking 
about the infrastructure bill. The dif-
ference between their infrastructure 
bill and what we did while I was Gov-
ernor of Florida is this: I actually 
spent our infrastructure money on 
roads, bridges, airports, and seaports, 
and, at the same time, we spent $85 bil-
lion in 8 years in one State doing that. 
We also cut taxes and fees 100 times, 
and we actually reduced our debt by a 
third, over $10 billion. 
The infrastructure bill—the so-called 
infrastructure bill—had less than 50 
percent of it in infrastructure. People 
said it was paid for, and it wasn’t. 
So I am glad people want to keep 
saying that it is a so-called infrastruc-
ture bill, but let’s remember: It wasn’t 
paid for; they said it was. And it wasn’t 
all for roads, bridges, airports, and sea-
ports, which is what they said it was in 
the beginning. 
So, therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, facts 
are a nasty thing. Do you know that? 
I would ask the good Senator from 
Florida to read the damn bill. This bill 
is to put money into roads and bridges, 
to put money into our electrical grid, 
to put money into our ports, to make 
our ports safer, to put money into 
water systems—the list goes on and on 
and on. 
For you to say that 50 percent of this 
bill is all that goes into infrastructure 
is not factual at all, and I will debate 
you on that until midnight tonight and 
longer—until Christmas Eve, because it 
is not factual. 
But I will tell you what is factual: 
The fact is that you, the good Senator 
from Florida, have stopped Amit Bose 
from being Administrator of the Fed-
eral Railroad Administration, thereby 
stopping any sort of improvements in 
the supply chain that we have, thereby 
stopping any sort of lowering of costs 
for small businesses and working fami-
lies in this country. That is a fact. 
And if you would like to respond to 
that, I would be more than happy to 
yield. 
That is a fact. The truth is the same 
people who stand up here and say this 
administration has got problems are 
creating those problems, because a mi-
nority of the minority are stopping 
good people from being in positions in 
this administration. That is a fact. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
first of all, facts are facts. Less than 50 
percent of the bill had anything to do 
with roads and bridges, airports and 
seaports. 
We were told all along it was going to 
be paid for; it wasn’t. The Congres-
sional Budget Office confirmed that. 
So facts are facts. 
On top of that, the majority leader 
could have, if these were important 
nominees, as my colleagues keep say-
ing they are, they could have filed clo-
ture and done these nominees. 
I mean, think of what we have done 
this last 2 weeks that we have been up 
here. Very few nominees have come 
through. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Very crafty—fifty per-
cent is used on roads, bridges, and sea-
ports, and you make it sound like the 
rest isn’t used on infrastructure. 
Since when did water not become in-
frastructure? Since when did improving 
our transmission lines not become in-
frastructure? 
The fact of the matter is this bill is 
a really good bill, and that is why 69 
people in this Senate voted for it, and 
it did not raise taxes on a single Amer-
ican family. 
You can make excuses all you want, 
but the facts are this: That infrastruc-
ture bill will help set us up for a vi-
brant 
economy 
for 
generations 
to 
come, and the most important thing 
that infrastructure bill will do is it will 
help us compete with China, unless you 
want to give the reserve currency to 
them. 
And the fact of the matter is, unless 
the Agencies are staffed up, we can’t 
implement that infrastructure bill. 
And if that is the impetus for this, 
shame on the folks who have objected 
to this, because the last time I 
checked, we are U.S. Senators, and we 
are not here for ourselves. We are here 
for this Nation, to make this Nation 
great, to keep this Nation great, to 
move this Nation forward. 
Our forefathers worked to do that. 
They didn’t have these kinds of silly 
arguments on the Senate floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
so I think my colleague doesn’t under-
stand that when you borrow money, 
you eventually have to pay it back. 
The government doesn’t produce in-
come. It takes money from people. 
That means that when that bill—the 
so-called infrastructure bill—runs defi-
cits, somebody’s taxes are going up. 
Whether they go up today or tomorrow, 
they are going to go up. 
And, by the way, it is part of why the 
Democrats had to raise the debt ceiling 
by $2.5 trillion, and that is $2.5 trillion 
that Americans families are going to 
have to pay for. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. So are you suggesting 
we shouldn’t raise the debt and not pay 
our debts and default? Is that the sug-
gestion? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I would do what I did in Florida. I 
walked into a $4 billion budget deficit. 
I balanced the budget. I cuts taxes and 
fees 100 times. I paid off a third of the 
State debt. I never increased my State 
debt. I actually cut it by $10.5 billion. 
That is exactly what we ought to be 
doing here. We can’t keep wasting 
money because somebody is going to 
pay for it.

ator from Montana.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9247 
December 16, 2021 
Mr. TESTER. Did the good Senator 
vote for the CARES Act? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Say again? 
Mr. TESTER. Did the good Senator 
from Florida vote for the CARES Act? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Absolutely. 
Mr. TESTER. Was it paid for? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Part of it. 
Last year, what we did was suspend the 
debt ceiling. 
Mr. TESTER. Yes, it wasn’t paid for. 
It added to the debt. Had the good Sen-
ator been here when we passed the 
Trump tax cuts, that also added $2 tril-
lion a year to the debt, and he would 
have justified that. 
If you want to talk about building 
our economy, there are two things you 
could do to build our economy: No. 1 is 
to invest in infrastructure, and the 
other one is to invest in education and 
workforce training. 
If we are going to get the infrastruc-
ture part of this stuff out the door, we 
cannot have a minority of the minority 
on the other side continuing to object 
to people in the very Agencies that will 
help get this infrastructure built up. 
That is the truth. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
my experience is totally different than 
my colleague from Montana’s experi-
ence. 
My experience is you build your 
economy by growing jobs. You build 
your economy by investing in edu-
cation, where you get a return. So, in 
my 8 years as Governor of Florida, we 
added 1.7 million jobs. We cut taxes and 
revenues grew. It allowed us to make 
record investments in education, in 
transportation, and in the environ-
ment. By the time I left office in Flor-
ida, we had the second lowest tuition of 
higher education in the country. Ac-
cording to the U.S. News & World Re-
port, we were No. 1 in education, but 
we did it by getting a return on all of 
the dollars. We didn’t do it by just 
spending money without getting a re-
turn. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I heard 
the Senator from Florida just say that 
he invested in education, workforce 
training, and infrastructure. If he 
would have not had an administration 
that would have been able to have got-
ten that money out the door, then he 
wouldn’t have been able to have suc-
ceeded. All we are asking is that we 
offer the President of the United States 
and this Nation, as a whole, that same 
opportunity. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, my 
colleague from Montana is making 
some great points in this debate. 
I can’t emphasize this enough to my 
colleague from Florida, a member of 
our committee. He knows how hard we 
have all worked on these. He knows 
how bipartisan this effort was. He 
knows that he is not joined by a bunch 
of other colleagues here tonight, you 
know, in making these objections. It is 
because they want these nominees. 
They voted for them. 
To come from a State like mine, 
where one in four jobs is related to 
trade, it is all about infrastructure. It 
is about our ports, our airports, our 
railroads, our roads. It is about getting 
the products from Montana out to the 
Pacific and to those destinations. It is 
all about making this infrastructure 
investment, and we finally have a 
President who is willing to put every-
thing on the line to get us back to 
making an infrastructure investment 
that is more than 1 percent of GDP and 
who is smart enough to know that 
those ports and everything else are not 
going to function well and that we are 
not going to be competitive with Can-
ada or with South America or with 
other places if we don’t make this in-
vestment. 
Well, now we have made it. We have 
made the investment. Now, we just 
need the people to execute on it, and 
our colleague doesn’t want those indi-
viduals to be part of this process. He is 
not ready for them. 
Everybody gets frustrated with the 
position of an administration. Every-
body wants to hear from a nominee. I 
have called nominees. You would think 
that some of those people might call 
me, but, no, I have had to pick up the 
phone and call them and say: Here is 
what my concern is. Where are you 
going to be on this issue? What are you 
going to do about this problem? 
Did I have everything guaranteed? 
Did I have every policy that I wanted 
to see for that nominee? No, but I 
picked up the phone and got the com-
mitment that I needed to see things 
through and get things moving. 
So, now, the fact that we have these 
nominees who continue to be held, as 
my colleague said, by a minority of the 
minority because they don’t want to 
see the infrastructure investments that 
we have already voted on put in place 
is just really holding up government. It 
is just holding it up. 
I think the President deserves to 
have his nominees. We deserve to get 
to vote on them. We deserve to give the 
President of the United States our 
opinion, but we also deserve to have 
these nominees voted on and not held 
in this process so that the govern-
ment—so the actual functioning of the 
infrastructure 
bill—can’t 
be 
imple-
mented even though the majority of 
the Senate voted that way. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to make the 
same request of Executive Calendar No. 
468, Mohsin Raza Syed, of Virginia, to 
be an Assistant Secretary of Transpor-
tation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
Let’s remember why I am here. 
For weeks, I have been asking the 
chair of the Commerce Committee to 
invite the Secretaries of Transpor-
tation and Commerce to come tell us 
what they are doing to fix this supply 
chain crisis. We still have 100 cargo 
ships off the coast of California. Is it 
getting better? No, it is not getting 
better. I was on a call this week, and I 
did not hear one thing that has been 
done to solve this supply chain crisis. 
When I was the Governor of Florida, 
we had hurricanes. We had to work 
hard to make sure we didn’t run out of 
fuel. To make that happen, what we 
would do is we would put everybody to-
gether. I often went to the ports to 
make sure that we got the fuel 
through, and we did. We got it done. 
I have not seen the Secretary of 
Transportation go out to the Port of 
Palm Beach to solve any problems at 
all. I have not heard of anything the 
Secretary of Commerce has done to go 
out to California and solve this supply 
chain crisis. On these nominees, clo-
ture could have been filed by the ma-
jority leader. For whatever reason, the 
majority leader decided not to do it. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, my 
colleague knows very well that, just 
yesterday, the Deputy Secretaries of 
Commerce, Transportation, and Agri-
culture met with—and it may have 
been on a Zoom call or on the phone— 
Senators to talk about exactly what is 
going on to help work on the supply 
chain. The Senator knows very well. 
Now, he may not have liked exactly 
what he heard in the outcome, but 
there are no harder working people 
than the Secretary of Commerce and 
the Secretary of Transportation in im-
plementing the things that need to be 
implemented to keep our country mov-
ing. 
The problem, I think, is that the Sen-
ator from Florida may not understand 
that there is a huge upside. We just had 
a hearing yesterday with all of the air-
lines, and we acted on the Payroll Sup-
port Program. The end result of that 
has been a big boon to our economy be-
cause they were there and in place to 
capture the upside when the vaccines 
worked and the flying public returned. 
So we, the United States of America, 
have outdone Europe and Asia and Can-
ada. Basically, the upside is having our 
air transportation system now back up 
to 90 percent of capacity. We did that 
because we acted. We made an invest-
ment, and the investment is paying off, 
and it kept a workforce that otherwise 
would have been on unemployment 
benefits. 
So this administration is working. 
This administration is working, and it 
needs people to help them implement 
the bill we just passed. The administra-
tion has been working with major ports 
to have night and weekend cargo oper-
ations. It has been working with com-
panies to improve the transparency of

logistics and pricing. It has been work-
ing with shippers to get the cargo and 
containers in and out of the ports fast-
er. 
He is urging some of the largest ship-
pers—Walmart, Target, Home Depot, 
Samsung, FedEx, and UPS—to commit 
to moving cargo during off-peak hours 
and making those commitments. 
Two major railroads—Union Pacific 
and BNSF—have announced that they 
will create new incentives for cargo 
owners to move cargo on the weekends. 
CMA CGM—one of the largest car-
riers—has begun providing $100 dis-
counts on the containers if they are 
picked up immediately, which is help-
ing move them off the docks. One of 
the problems is that empty containers 
have been left on the docks, and this 
has caused congestion at the ports. So 
the administration has worked with 
these carriers to help incent people 
who have been part of the shipping sys-
tem to get that product off of the 
docks. We have begun to see positive 
results from this. 
This month, the CEOs of the major 
retailers told President Biden that the 
supply chain conditions have begun to 
show signs of improvement. This is 
from the major retailers. 
As to the issues that we are focusing 
on here, we are talking to two people 
who are out fixing the problem. The 
Senator had a chance to talk to their 
Deputies about this. These are people 
who are definitely available to be 
talked to about this problem. Yet they 
are asking us to continue to have a 
workforce. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar 
No. 
469, 
Victoria 
Marie 
Baecher Wassmer, of the District of Co-
lumbia, to be Chief Financial Officer, 
Department of Transportation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
First, I want to thank my colleague 
from Washington for holding the hear-
ing with the airlines, and there are two 
things about that. 
I was surprised that I didn’t get a 
very good answer from the airlines 
about, did we get a return on the— 
what?—$54 billion we provided the air-
line industry? I was extremely dis-
appointed that United Airlines was 
cavalier with the employees in my 
State who were basically let go or laid 
off without pay only because they de-
cided not to get the vaccine for reli-
gious purposes. 
In coming back to this issue, I still 
am waiting for the Secretary of Trans-
portation and the Secretary of Com-
merce to come to a public event so all 
of our constituents in my State can 
hear exactly what they are doing to 
solve the supply chain problem. I can 
tell you that I was on this phone call, 
and this problem is not getting better. 
There are still 100 cargo ships off the 
coast of California. I want to hear ex-
actly what they are doing and so do the 
citizens of my State. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. 
CANTWELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
these nominees we are talking about 
are nominees who are literally just the 
people who are going to help get these 
things done within the Agencies. The 
Senator is basically denying people the 
ability to have analysis, to talk about 
competition, to talk about the effec-
tive strategies that we need to put in 
place. 
The Commerce Committee has had 
three hearings on the supply chain. In 
fact, we had some fabulous testimony, 
starting in—I think it was—February 
or March, about the supply chain. It 
was a fabulous panel of experts, and it 
was about the complexity of what was 
happening to the supply chain and 
what our problems were going to be. 
The one thing that is clear is that 
this isn’t an issue for just COVID; that 
this isn’t an issue for just this adminis-
tration; and that this isn’t an issue 
even for the next, you know, few years. 
This is an issue about the fact that, in 
the world economy in 2019, prior to the 
pandemic, something miraculous hap-
pened: The majority of the population 
of the world reached middle class. That 
meant the majority of people outside 
the United States was going to be a 
huge market opportunity for our goods 
and our products. It is a huge economic 
opportunity that 95 percent of con-
sumers are outside the United States. 
That means we have to get things to 
those 
markets 
cost-effectively 
and 
competitively. 
For us in Seattle, the Port of Seattle 
has to compete with the Port of Van-
couver. The Port of Vancouver and the 
infrastructure of—Canada has made all 
sorts of infrastructure investment all 
across Canada with rail and port in-
vestment so that they can have the 
state of the art and so that it can be 
cheaper to ship through Canada than 
the United States. The same thing is 
happening in South America and other 
parts of the world. This is about who is 
going to reach the Asian market and 
how fast they are going to reach the 
Asian market. 
The infrastructure investment was 
critical. It was critical to making sure 
that our railroads worked, that our 
ports worked, that our motor carriers 
had the right people and had the right 
safety. This was, literally, upgrading 
our infrastructure that had been ig-
nored—basically kept on life support— 
for so long, and now, we have a Presi-
dent and a bipartisan group of people 
who are going to make the investment. 
So the fact that those Agencies now 
need people—even the next nominee we 
are talking about—it is just literally 
about making investments so that they 
can figure out the strategy and the 
strategy moving forward on these indi-
viduals. 
I don’t understand why so many of 
these nominees my colleague has to ob-
ject to because these nominees are in-
dividuals who are part of our infra-
structure investment and, in this case, 
are part of where we are with the De-
partment 
of 
Commerce 
in 
under-
standing what is even happening in the 
supply chain and what we also want to 
do. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to make the 
same request with respect to Executive 
Calendar No. 355, Grant T. Harris, of 
California, to be an Assistant Sec-
retary of Commerce. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President 
reserving the right to object. 
I want to be clear. I like infrastruc-
ture. I spent $85 billion on infrastruc-
ture. With $10 billion a year, we had a 
dramatic increase in infrastructure. It 
is part of the reason we added 1.7 mil-
lion jobs. I also did a lot of work to try 
to make sure we increased trade in 
Florida. We have 15 seaports. I believe 
in all of this. 
I also believe we have a supply chain 
crisis right now. It is not getting bet-
ter. I am shocked that my colleague 
does not want to ask the Secretary of 
Transportation and the Secretary of 
Commerce to explain to the American 
public why this is not getting better. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. We are here on 
whatever today is—December 16. We 
are here, you know, as Congress ca-
reens toward trying to get some work 
done before we break for the holiday 
season. 
I am sure that my colleague knows 
very well where the administration is 
on getting its nominees. We are not 
even the only committee that is out 
here on a weekly basis complaining 
about the number of nominees who are 
not allowed to serve. Even though they 
come out of committee with bipartisan 
support, they are not being allowed to 
be taken up and acted upon. 
We have had people out here from the 
Foreign Affairs Committee. We have 
had nominees. We have had various 
committees—the HELP Committee. So 
we are just here now talking about the 
Transportation Committee. 
So, yes, we have a minority within 
the minority that doesn’t want the ad-
ministration to have the nominees it 
needs to get things done. In this case, 
it is infrastructure. The importance of 
that is that the majority of people 
voted for infrastructure. The majority 
of people have voted for these nomi-
nees, and these nominees deserve to get 
in their place so that individuals can 
do their work. 
If the Senator from Florida doesn’t 
want to support—didn’t want to sup-
port the infrastructure bill, doesn’t be-
lieve that it was done just like he

would do it, I would ask him to con-
sider the fact that his colleagues, the 
majority of whom did support it, are 
now going to be delayed in getting 
those resources out the door. 
Now, maybe that is what he wants. 
Maybe he is playing a game of the cal-
endar. He is just hoping that those 
nominees won’t ever get into these 
spots, that it will take forever for us to 
get these programs implemented. Our 
economy can’t wait for that. Our econ-
omy and the investments that we all 
decided to make can’t wait for this 
kind of gamesmanship. The small busi-
nesses that my colleague from Mon-
tana talked about can’t wait for that 
gamesmanship. 
I guarantee you those Secretaries 
will be in front of the Commerce Com-
mittee in the new year at some point 
in time. I guarantee it. That is what 
happens around here. I am pretty sure 
they will be asked these questions. I 
am sure they are asked these questions 
every single day. I am pretty sure they 
would take a call from my colleague 
tonight or tomorrow. I am pretty sure 
they would have the input from him 
that he would want to give in these sit-
uations. 
But this is an issue about whether 
you are for the infrastructure invest-
ment and whether you are for making 
that a reality by having the people 
whom it takes to implement it. And if 
you don’t have CFOs, if you don’t have 
the Administrators of the Agencies, if 
you don’t have the people who are tar-
geted to do the investment, I am not 
sure how you can do it. 
One 
of 
those 
nominees, 
Arun 
Venkataraman, currently serves as a 
counselor to the Secretary of Com-
merce on trade and international mat-
ters. He has more than 20 years of expe-
rience in working on these issues and is 
somebody who could benefit us in this 
analysis of the challenges that we are 
facing to get our products into these 
markets and get them into these mar-
kets quickly. 
So I ask unanimous consent that it 
be in order to make the same request 
with respect to Executive Calendar No. 
586, Arun Venkataraman to be Assist-
ant Secretary of Commerce and Direc-
tor General of the United States and 
Foreign Commercial Service. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Reserving the 
right to object, the one thing that has 
not been addressed is, if this were so 
important, why didn’t my colleagues 
go 
to 
the 
majority 
leader—same 
party—and ask him to file cloture on 
these nominees? 
I still also have never been told why, 
when I have been asking for this for 
weeks, these two Secretaries won’t 
show up and tell my citizens why they 
can’t solve the supply chain problem. 
Therefore, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I 
think we have had a good discussion of 
exactly what these individuals—the 
Secretary of Commerce and the Sec-
retary of Transportation—have been 
doing. They have been making their 
deputies available for conversations 
about supply chains. We have had sup-
ply chain hearings. We will continue to 
address this issue. I am pretty sure 
they will take his phone call. 
I am pretty sure that the reason we 
are out here is because when the other 
side of the aisle holds up so many 
nominees, there are only so many clo-
ture motions that you can file. But I 
guess we will be here this weekend, and 
we will find out exactly how many clo-
ture motions and how long it will take 
to continue to get these nominees. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
ELECTIONS 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak about a grave threat 
that we face, a threat to the very idea 
of America. 
By law, every 2 years, Americans 
cast their votes for Federal office on a 
Tuesday in early November. Like many 
Americans, I have always treasured 
that day. I have gone to my polling 
place, and I have cast my vote. When I 
have left, usually from a townhall or a 
school, I have done so with the con-
fidence that the votes would be count-
ed, a winner declared, and my town, 
my State, and my country would move 
forward, accepting the results not be-
cause of which candidates won but be-
cause of our confidence that the elec-
tion system was run impartially by 
people who believe in our democracy 
and believe that democracy is about 
free, fair, and impartially administered 
elections. 
This great democracy of ours depends 
on the existence of a free and fair cast-
ing and telling of the votes and the 
public’s acceptance of that result. That 
is the prerequisite for a functioning de-
mocracy, and every other piece of our 
society, from our economy to our na-
tional security, depends on it. 
Without free, fair, and impartially 
administered 
elections, 
the 
United 
States of America as we know it would 
not exist. Yet, right now, our beloved 
democracy is under attack. 
In States around the country, par-
tisan lawmakers are proposing to ig-
nore properly cast votes, essentially 
trying to throw out the votes and si-
lence the voices of those with whom 
they disagree. These partisans are 
more concerned about losing power 
than protecting the rights of citizens 
and preserving the foundation of our 
country. 
Here in Washington, a set of arcane 
Senate rules are being used as an ex-
cuse not to act. This cannot stand. We 
must change the rules to allow a sim-
ple majority of this body, as our 
Founders intended, to pass laws that 
will protect the right to vote and pro-
tect American democracy. 
In States across the country, par-
tisan politicians are calling into ques-
tion the sacred American right to free, 
fair, and impartially administered elec-
tions. These politicians are trying to 
reject the will of the people, trying to 
interfere with elections and, yes, over-
turn results. This is not an idle threat; 
it is happening right now. 
As the Presiding Officer well knows, 
earlier this year in Georgia, a new law 
enabled the legislature to seize control 
of the State election board, allowing 
elected legislators to install a partisan 
majority beholden to that legislature, 
with the ability to suspend and replace 
local election officials. 
In Arizona, legislators have proposed 
a bill that would enable the State leg-
islature to override an election certifi-
cation with a simple majority vote. 
These efforts threaten the integrity 
of our election system. That, in turn, 
threatens our peace, stability, and cer-
tainty—the very rule of law that 
makes individual liberty, a vibrant 
economy, and, yes, the peaceful trans-
fer of power possible. 
There is no single aspect of American 
life that isn’t related to free, fair, and 
impartially administered elections. We 
have public schools, safe neighbor-
hoods, access to healthcare, support for 
small businesses, and access to the 
great outdoors all because ordinary 
Americans can make their voices heard 
and hold their government—a govern-
ment of, by, and for the people—ac-
countable. 
In America, as imperfect as we are, 
everybody has the opportunity to suc-
ceed because everyone has the oppor-
tunity to vote. But that all changes 
when our election system is corrupted 
by politicians who are more interested 
in clinging to power than being respon-
sive to the people whom they were 
elected to represent. 
When those in power work to create 
a partisan electoral system where the 
focus is not on ensuring that every 
vote is counted but is instead on ensur-
ing a predetermined outcome, those in 
power become less and less responsive 
to the will of the people. And as citi-
zens become disenfranchised and angry, 
those in power increasingly rely on au-
thoritarian methods to stay in power. 
That is the road that we risk going 
down if this systematic undermining of 
our elections and our democracy con-
tinues. 
Authoritarian regimes like China, 
Russia, Iran, and North Korea would 
like nothing more than to see our great 
American experiment fail, to see Mem-
bers of this Congress stand by while 
our democracy withers on the vine. 
When Americans lose trust in our de-
mocracy, when the integrity of our 
elections is thrown into doubt, neither 
Republicans nor Democrats win; our 
enemies do. 
But we in the Senate can stop this 
threat to our democracy by acting to

protect the fundamental right to vote. 
The Constitution gives Congress the 
power to oversee Federal elections. 
That means that Congress has the au-
thority to protect democracy and the 
right to vote, and we have a constitu-
tional and moral obligation to do so. 
That was part of the oath I swore, to 
‘‘support and defend the Constitution’’ 
and ‘‘bear true faith and allegiance to 
the same.’’ 
Congress has a responsibility to act 
now to ensure that the right of every 
American to vote is never taken away. 
We must pass legislation to prevent 
partisan politicians from rejecting the 
will of the people and overturning elec-
tion results. Because that effort here in 
Congress is being blocked by a minor-
ity, which is abusing its power, I be-
lieve the time has come to change the 
Senate rules to allow a straight up-or- 
down majority vote on this funda-
mental issue of democracy. 
Our Founders understood that our de-
mocracy was a fragile thing that we 
would always have to fight to protect. 
Across every generation, Americans 
have signed up to serve not just to pro-
tect our physical security but to pro-
tect our freedom. 
American soldiers, like my father, 
fought in World War II. They saved the 
world from Hitler, preserving freedom 
around the globe. My dad fought in the 
Battle of the Bulge. When I was grow-
ing up and we were having breakfast, 
Dad would sometimes look up at my 
brother, my sister, and me, and he 
would say, ‘‘So what are you going to 
do for freedom today?’’ Sounds like 
kind of a big question to ask a kid, but 
he was serious because every single 
American has a responsibility to help 
protect our democracy, including and 
perhaps especially U.S. Senators. 
We must change the Senate rules to 
protect the right to vote because if we 
don’t, we face a very different kind of 
election day than the one we have now. 
If the partisans who are attacking our 
democracy have their way, our Tues-
day election day in early November 
will be different. We will wake up, cast 
our vote, drop our kids at school, and 
go to work. We will tune back in at the 
end of the day to see the election re-
sults, only to learn that the vote tally 
is being ignored, that our votes don’t 
matter much. We will learn that our 
legislatures are going to throw out the 
results and pick their own winner. We 
will see an election day that is a cha-
rade just like in countries where de-
mocracy doesn’t exist. 
Our democracy is too important to 
allow a minority of this body to let it 
slip away. We must pass legislation to 
protect 
American 
democracy. 
Our 
country depends on it. 
I yield the floor.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the 
information of the Senate, while I was 
necessarily absent for the confirmation 
votes of Ramin Toloui and Rashad 
Hussain, I want the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD to reflect my support for their 
confirmations. Had I been present, I 
would have voted in the affirmative. 
Ramin Toloui is nominated to be the 
Assistant Secretary of State for Eco-
nomic and Business Affairs. He is the 
professor of the Practice for Inter-
national Finance at Stanford Univer-
sity, and the Tad and Diane Taube Pol-
icy Fellow at the Stanford Institute for 
Economic Policy Research. His teach-
ing and research focus on international 
economic policy, financial crises, and 
the economic impact of artificial intel-
ligence. He began his career as a civil 
servant at the Department of the 
Treasury. His nomination was favor-
ably reported by the Foreign Relations 
Committee, and he is superbly quali-
fied to hold this position. 
Rashad Hussain is nominated to be 
Ambassador at Large for Religious 
Freedom. He is a senior counsel at the 
Department of Justice’s National Secu-
rity Division. He previously served as 
President Obama’s Special Envoy to 
the Organization of Islamic Coopera-
tion—OIC—as U.S. Special Envoy for 
Strategic Counterterrorism 
Commu-
nications, and as Deputy Associate 
White House Counsel. In his role as OIC 
Envoy, Professor Hussain helped de-
velop U.S policy and deepen and expand 
partnerships 
with 
Muslim-majority 
countries, civil society organizations, 
and the OIC, the world’s second largest 
multilateral organization after the UN. 
As Special Envoy for Strategic Coun-
terterrorism 
Communications, 
Pro-
fessor Hussain led an interagency body 
that worked with international part-
ners to amplify credible narratives in 
countering terrorist propaganda. Hav-
ing been reported favorably by the For-
eign Relations Committee, I have no 
doubt of his qualifications for this posi-
tion.

December 16, 2021 
CELEBRATING ITALIANS IN 
VERMONT 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, those 
who know me, and even those who 
don’t, are well aware of the pride I 
have in my Italian heritage. My mater-
nal grandparents emigrated from the 
Friuli region of Italy, coming to South 
Ryegate, VT, to work in the granite 
quarries. Since the 1880s, many Italians 
have followed this same immigration 
pattern, 
settling 
across 
Vermont, 
where the beautiful hills and lakes re-
mind them of their ancestral home. 
Today, Vermont boasts a strong com-
munity of Italian Americans, many of 
whom, including me, are members of 
the Vermont Italian Cultural Associa-
tion, VICA. Led by President Lisa 
DeNatale, the association preserves 
and 
promotes 
Italian 
culture 
in 
Vermont, hosting language and travel 
groups, presentations, movies, cooking 
classes, luncheons, and bocce socials. 
Last year, Marcelle and I were de-
lighted to join VICA and Trattoria 
Delia for a virtual wine-tasting. Join-
ing with dear friends online helped us, 
like so many Vermonters, get through 
the earliest and harder months of the 
pandemic. 
It is nearly impossible to travel 
across our State without seeing the in-
fluence of the Italian-American com-
munity. In Northfield, the streets out-
side of La Panciata smell of Carrara, 
Italy, 
where 
founder 
Glenn 
Loati 
learned the ancient art of baking Latin 
leavened 
breads. 
In 
Burlington, 
Trattoria Delia serves traditional Nea-
politan pizzas baked in an imported 
Acunto oven. And of course in Barre, 
where so many Italians immigrated, 
the Societa di Mutuo Soccorso provides 
community support, and the Vermont 
Salumi and Alimentari Roscini Market 
keeps us fed with some of the best 
cured meats in the State. 
Some Italian philosophies have also 
made their way to Vermont. The Slow 
Food movement, founded by Carlo 
Petrini in Turin, Italy, found a wel-
coming home in our State less than 10 
years after its conception. The prac-
tices of growing and producing good, 
clean, and fair food certainly weren’t 
new to Vermonters, but Slow Food 
Vermont has become an important part 
of our local food economy. 
I am proud to be a member of VICA 
and so grateful for the rich culture 
that Italian Americans have fostered in 
Vermont. The Green Mountain appre-
ciation for artisanal products created 
with craftsmanship and traditional 
methods will always remind me of my 
Italian ancestors. I look forward to 
being back in Vermont, breaking bread 
and sharing wine, with this incredible 
community. 
‘‘We the Italians’’ recently inter-
viewed VICA President Lisa DeNatale. 
Her comments so resonated with me. I 
recognize many of the businesses, 
friends 
and 
communities 
she 
ref-
erences. Even when far from Vermont 
and at work in Washington, these 
kinds of interviews take me home. 
I ask unanimous consent that the re-
cent interview with Lisa DeNatale be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[Dec. 7, 2021] 
WE
THE
ITALIANS: INTERVIEW
WITH
LISA 
DENATALE
(PRESIDENT
OF
THE
VERMONT 
ITALIAN CULTURAL ASSOCIATION) 
If since the beginning of the pandemic I 
personally have not yet had the opportunity 
to physically travel back to visit any of the 
many friends of We the Italians scattered 
across the United States, thanks to our 
interviews I often have the chance to take a 
virtual trip and get to know the various 
Italian communities both in the most fa-
mous areas of America and in the lesser 
known ones here in Italy. 
Vermont may be not that famous in Italy, 
but Italian emigration to the Green Moun-
tain State was very important and I am 
pleased to thank and host Lisa DeNatale, 
President of the Vermont Italian Cultural 
Association and also Ambassador of We the 
Italians in Vermont. I’m hosting her on We 
the Italians, but by telling me about the his-
tory and present of Italy in Vermont, it’s a 
bit like she’s also hosting me in Burlington 
and Barre. Are you ready? Come with me 
LISA, PLEASE TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT YOU 
AND YOUR ITALIAN HERITAGE 
My 
grandparents, 
Maria 
Tripi 
and 
Salvatore 
DiNatale 
emigrated 
from 
Pietraperzia, Sicilia in 1910. They married 
and settled in Boston, eventually buying a 
home, and raising their six children in Ever-
ett, Massachusetts. 
Giuseppe Salvatore DiNatale, my father, 
was born in 1924. He was deeply proud of his 
Sicilian heritage and often sang songs and 
occasionally spoke to his children in Italian 
(not dialect). If the truth be told, he mostly 
spoke 
in 
the 
imperative! 
‘‘Vieni 
qui’’; 
‘‘lasciala’’; ‘‘mangia’’; ‘‘andiamo subito’’ are 
some of the phrases I recall. 
I had a large extended family which gath-
ered at my grandparent’s home for Pasqua, 
Natale, Onomastici and almost any other oc-
casion. I remember celebrating my father’s 
Onomastico with zeppole in honor of San 
Giuseppe. Each celebration included more 
people than there were chairs, crowded 
around tables in my grandparent’s home. As 
children we played bocce alongside the grape 
vines and pear trees in their yard and danced 
the tarantella. 
From a young age I recall attending the 
Feast of Maria Santissima Della Cava, pa-
troness of Pietraperzia, one of the many 
feasts celebrated in Boston’s North End each 
summer. In 1967 my parents and grand-
parents traveled together to Sicily and Italy, 
reestablishing family connections and invig-
orating our ties to Sicily. Upon returning 
my father began a life-long focus on pre-
paring authentic Italian foods such as ri-
sotto milanese, calamari, polenta, pesto and 
panettone, well before these gained popu-
larity in the US. 
In my twenties I began to visit Italy and 
have since traveled there dozens of times, in-
cluding twice to Sicily. It may be surprising 
to hear that on my first trip to Sicily, I was 
struck by how many of my childhood friends 
surnames corresponded with places in Sicily 
such as Siracusa and Mondello, and how 
many more had relatives buried in the 
Cimitero di Pietraperzia. I understood then 
how much of my childhood was inextricably 
tied to Sicily. 
I am currently pursuing my Italian citizen-
ship and am awaiting my appointment at the 
Boston Consulate schedule for March 2022. 
YOU
ARE
THE
PRESIDENT
OF
THE
VERMONT 
ITALIAN
CULTURAL
ASSOCIATION. 
PLEASE 
TELL US ABOUT THE HISTORY AND THE ACTIVI-
TIES OF THIS ASSOCIATION 
The Vermont Italian Cultural Association 
was founded in 1983 by Italians and Italian 
Americans many of whom had relocated to 
Vermont in the late 70’s. Dr. Ken Ciongoli, 
an Italian American born in Philadelphia 
and Dr. Mario Morselli, born in Bologna, 
were lecturing about Italy in Burlington, 
Vermont and attracted interest from the 
community and in particular from other 
Italians and Italian Americans in the area. 
Some of the early VICA members were new 
to Vermont and sought an Italian commu-
nity in which to continue their family tradi-
tions and celebrate their Italian heritage. In 
time, a small group formed, drawn together 
by a mutual passion for preserving and shar-
ing Italian culture. During the early years 
the group met in living rooms and later, in 
restaurants and community centers that 
could accommodate the growing numbers. 
Membership extended south to Barre and 
Rutland; communities steeped in Italian her-
itage. The growing community shared the 
bond of family and Italian traditions and 
preserved these for generations to follow. 
VICA has for many years celebrated 
Epifania with a visit from La Befana and 
Carnevale which included a mask making ac-
tivity. In addition, VICA has sponsored trips 
to Italy as well as opera excursions to Mon-
treal, a short 90-minute drive from Bur-
lington. Programs and activities have ex-
panded over the years, ranging from lectures 
on art, travel and genealogy to film, cook-
ing, dance, language groups and bocce tour-
naments. Monthly amici lunches bring to-
gether members for socializing, and Italian 
conversation groups have continued in class-
rooms, in coffee shops and on zoom. 
More recently, VICA has turned to virtual 
events which have proven to be very popular. 
These include book readings hosted by Phoe-
nix 
Books, 
a 
VICA 
partner, 
featuring 
Vermont 
authors 
Vincent 
Panella, 
Jay 
Parini and Charlie Nardozzi, along with trav-
el author Carla Gambescia. A recent lecture 
on Slow Food with the Slow Food Vermont 
chapter attracted over 100 people and earlier 
this year VICA held two virtual presen-
tations entitled In Pursuit of Italian Citizen-
ship, attracting over 200 VICA and commu-
nity members. 
And because Vermont winters can be cold 
and snowy in December 2020, and almost bi- 
monthly since then, we’ve co-hosted virtual 
wine-tastings with VICA partner Trattoria 
Delia, showcasing Italian wines from every 
region. In celebration of Women’s History 
Month in March we featured wines produced 
by women in Italy. Participants were treated 
to personal video messages sent from three 
producers: Cinzia Sommariva, Elisa Sesti 
and Giulia Negri. Each event includes a se-
lection of hand-curated antipasti prepared 
locally. These events have proven to be enor-
mously popular, engaging our members and 
successfully recruiting others to VICA. Up-
coming events include virtual cooking class-
es, opera lectures and a trip to Puglia in Oc-
tober 2022. 
Promoting knowledge and appreciation of 
Italian culture in our community is at the 
heart of the Vermont Italian Cultural Asso-
ciation’s mission. Each year VICA awards 
small grants and scholarships to support 
projects 
and 
endeavors 
consistent 
with 
VICA’s mission. The VICA Scholarship and 
Grants Fund encourages those who are seek-
ing to broaden their knowledge of Italy, in-
cluding the Italian American experience, the 
Italian experience, its language, arts, music, 
history, and culture to apply. Most recently 
(prior to covid) two scholarships were award-
ed. One went to a University of Vermont stu-
dent who participated in an archaeological

cient Roman villa in the commune of 
Mompeo in the Lazio region. The other re-
cipient, also a UVM student, attended an ar-
chaeological field school in Badia Pozzeveri 
in Tuscany, where she participated in the ex-
cavation of the remains of a thirteenth cen-
tury church. At the conclusion of each 
project, the scholarship recipients gave pres-
entations to VICA members and the broader 
community. 
In the last year VICA has become a big 
part of my life. On January 1st, 2021, my fa-
ther passed away at the age of 96, and I won-
dered how I might hold onto the traditions 
and heritage he shared so proudly with his 
family. While I have only been a VICA mem-
ber since 2015, and only recently was elected 
President, I am delighted for the opportunity 
to honor my father in my role. His absence 
has left me with a deeper commitment to 
VICA’s mission, and that in truth, VICA is 
the key to keeping my own heritage alive. 
WHAT’S THE STORY OF THE ITALIAN EMIGRATION 
TO VERMONT? 
I am not a historian, so I have relied on re-
sources and information found in news arti-
cles, historical societies, and other docu-
ments. I am grateful to those writers who 
have shared their knowledge and perspective 
so that we remember the contributions of 
Italian immigrants to Vermont’s economy 
and culture. My response is based on articles 
from two sources and used with permission 
from Vincent Feeney, Vermont Historian 
and The (Barre-Montpelier) Times Argus. 
Many people are surprised that Vermont 
had such a large Italian immigrant popu-
lation, but one need look no further than the 
granite and marble quarries to understand 
the immigrant story. Vermont welcomed 
Italian immigrants beginning in the 1880’s. 
The first Italian stone workers came from 
Carrara to work at the Vermont Marble 
Company in Rutland. They were skilled mar-
ble carvers who were drawn to America for 
economic 
reasons 
and 
specifically 
to 
Vermont because its hills and lakes re-
minded them of their ancestral home. 
Italians came to Barre, from 1890 to 1910 as 
stonecutters to work in the granite quarries. 
By the turn of the century there were several 
thousand Italians in Barre. By 1910, about 14 
percent of Barre’s population was Italian, 
and Barre was the home of Vermont’s largest 
Italian population. Most immigrants to 
Barre came from the granite area around 
Viggiu` and Bisuschio in Lombardy as well as 
from the marble area around Carrara in Tus-
cany. Some of Barre’s outstanding pre-World 
War II carvers and sculptors were Italian im-
migrants: Carlo Abate, Joseph Calcagni, 
John Comi, Elia Corti, William Corti, Enrico 
Mori, Samuel Novelli, Augusto Sanguinetti, 
and Geno Tosi. 
Other Italian immigrants came from the 
north as businessmen or landowners. Others 
from southern Italy first worked for U.S. 
railroads and then migrated to Barre estab-
lishing a variety of businesses. Novelli & 
Corti was established by Samuel (‘‘Sandro’’) 
Novelli and Elia Corti in 1901 and also in-
cluded John (‘‘Crosta’’) Comi and William 
(‘‘Bigin’’) Corti. Novelli & Corti became 
Barre’s premier sculpture and carving studio 
of the early 1900s. There are many out-
standing examples of the skill of Barre’s 
carvers in monuments throughout Barre. 
And a walk through Hope cemetery, where 
many Italian immigrant stonecutters are 
buried, is a testament to their skills. 
Later, due to a shortage of skilled granite 
workers a small number of master sculptors 
and carvers were lured from Italy through 
substantial wage increases to work in Barre. 
These artists led a renaissance of stone art 
in Barre and trained a whole new generation 
of Barre sculptors and carvers. Some of 
Barre’s 
outstanding 
post-World 
War 
II 
carvers 
and 
sculptors 
include 
Angelo 
Ambrosini, 
Angelo 
Bardelli, 
Giuliano 
Cecchinelli, Alcide Fantoni, Flavio Furloni, 
Frank Gaylord, Ernesto Malnati, Orazio 
Marselli, 
Gino 
Sassi, 
and 
Lambruno 
Sarzanini. 
Italian immigrants were also settling in 
Burlington’s urban core in large numbers, as 
laborers working on the railroads and others 
in the lumber yards. Some became peddlers 
selling fruit and vegetables, later opening 
markets to serve the growing Italian popu-
lation. For the Italians of this Burlington 
neighborhood—despite the hardships of the 
Great Depression—the pre-World War II 
years were something of a social/cultural 
‘‘Golden Age.’’ Their businesses dotted the 
neighborhood. For groceries in general, but 
particularly for pasta, salami, and olives, 
neighbors shopped at Colaceci’s, Izzo’s and 
Merola’s. For a night out people dined at 
Bernardini’s Cafe, and beginning in 1941 and 
continuing for the next 70 years Bove’s was 
the restaurant to treat family and friends to 
an inexpensive Italian dinner. 
The neighborhood was also home to Italian 
institutions. In 1933 Italian men of Bur-
lington joined with their fellow countrymen 
of Winooski to form the Twin City Italian 
Club (TWIC). Its professed purpose was to 
‘‘raise the standards’’ of the Italian commu-
nity and to prepare immigrants for citizen-
ship, but it was also a place where old-coun-
try Italian men could socialize, talk about 
news from home, and perhaps make job con-
nections. By 1936 the club was sufficiently 
prosperous that it bought a vacant lot and 
built a social hall. The hall was the center of 
Italian social life in Chittenden County for 
the next dozen years. Italian women social-
ized in an organization called Regina of 
Mount Carmel, a group that attended Mass 
together once a month. The Regina of Mount 
Carmel was Mary, who for centuries had a 
devoted following in the impoverished south 
of Italy from where so many Italians had 
emigrated. 
YOU’VE ALREADY MENTIONED A FEW, BUT ARE 
THERE OTHER IMPORTANT ‘‘ITALIAN’’ PLACES 
IN VERMONT? 
Barre is one of the most Italian places in 
Vermont, and is home to The Societa`
di 
Mutuo Soccorso, founded by Italian immi-
grants in Barre in 1906 as a fraternal and 
community support group. Along with the 
Societa`, are several businesses including 
Vermont Salumi and (Alimentari Roscini) 
AR 
Market 
in 
downtown 
Barre. 
Peter 
Roscini Colman, born in Assisi to an Italian 
father and American mother is the founder 
and proprietor of both. Pete grew up on an 
organic farm in Vermont and spent summers 
in Umbria with his babbo’s family. There, he 
used to ‘‘warm up’’ for lunch at his grand-
parents’ house by eating prosciutto. He loved 
it so much he decided he wanted to learn to 
make it himself. His uncle Franco intro-
duced him to Pepe, who introduced him to 
Francesco and David. Soon, he was appren-
ticing with these norcini, the famed butchers 
of Umbria, who taught him the methods, 
techniques, and centuries-old traditions of 
salumi-making. 
There’s also Campo di Vino an authentic 
grocery, chock full of Italian specialties 
made on the premises. Refrigerators are 
stocked with homemade pastas including 
ravioli, gnocchi, tagliatelle, and more; fresh-
ly stuffed luganiga and sausages as well as 
cannoli and pies. 
Not far from Barre, located in Northfield is 
La Panciata, a family owned and operated 
wholesale bakery. Founder Glenn Loati 
learned the ancient art of making Latin 
leavened loaves of bread in Carrara, Italy 
where he traveled in 1992 to work in the bak-
ery of a local market. Today the bakery is 
owned and operated by Glenn’s son Justin. 
La Panciata produces and distributes a wide 
variety of breads including Pane Siciliano, 
Pane Altamura, Focaccia and an assortment 
of biscotti. 
Perhaps one of the most important and 
representative Italian places is Hope Ceme-
tery located in Barre. Strolling through the 
cemetery, it’s impossible not to notice the 
gradual refinement of granite tombs over the 
course of the 20th century. The earliest 
gravestones are rough and weathered, as 
though the earth had coughed them from the 
ground. Many stonecutters died performing 
their craft, having succumbed to the ‘‘Amer-
ican disease’’ silicosis. Because the climate 
in Italy was milder, workers labored in sheds 
with open sides, naturally ventilating the 
area, allowing the fine dust to escape. One 
such stonecutter, Louis Brusa, died in 1937 at 
age 50 from silicosis. His monument is one of 
the most unusual (and disturbing) in Hope 
Cemetery. Brusa is shown exhausted and 
slumped backward with his wife Mary com-
forting him. His chest is merged into the 
granite base symbolic of his lungs filled with 
granite dust. Looking around, the names on 
the tombstones conjure far-away places: 
Columbo, Benvenuti, Peduzzi, Corti, and 
more. More than a few are engraved in 
Italian: Nata Novembre 1872, Mo11a Febbraio 
1936. There are prominent mausoleums where 
generations of Italian families are buried 
side by side, close in death as in life. 
Not so much a place but a philosophy is 
Slow Food, the movement founded by Carlo 
Petrini in Turin in 1989. Vermont led the US, 
establishing the first Slow Food chapter here 
in 1998. Good, clean, fair food is a practice 
that has long been at the root of Vermont 
agriculture, respect for the land, the ani-
mals, and workers. In 2000 Carlo Petrini vis-
ited Vermont, and in 2008 Vermont began 
sending a delegation to Terra Madre, the 
most important international Slow Food 
event. 
AND WHAT ABOUT THE MOST REPRESENTATIVE 
ITALIANS WHO MARKED A SPOT IN THE HIS-
TORY OF THE ITALIAN PRESENCE IN VERMONT? 
I’ve already mentioned many of the sculp-
tors who have made their mark in the cities, 
towns and public spaces in Vermont and else-
where having created lasting monuments 
with their hands. One of the most notable 
Italian Americans is Vermont Senator Pat-
rick Leahy, whose maternal grandparents 
were Italian immigrants. Senator Leahy is 
the most senior member in the US Senate 
and Vermont’s longest-serving Senator. He 
and his wife Marcelle are also VICA mem-
bers. 
IS THERE AN ITALIAN FESTIVAL IN VERMONT? 
To my knowledge there has not been an 
Italian festival in Vermont, however we 
would like to plan one for the future. I’m 
certain there would be a great deal of inter-
est from Vermonters, including many from 
the business community. One of Vermont’s 
family 
owned 
and 
operated 
businesses, 
Torronecandy.com would be very popular. 
Since 1988, the Andriola family has attended 
a number of Italian festivals throughout the 
Northeast, offering delicious Italian sweets 
and treats from their traveling cart. Absent 
a festival in Vermont, we can still order deli-
cious imported treats shipped to our homes, 
or we can invite Anne Marie Andriola, 
Torronecandy.com founder and VICA mem-
ber to a meeting!

in Vermont’’ which I think lends itself very 
well to our mission. For many, there is joy 
in discovering the individuals, businesses, 
small producers, and artisans who are pre-
serving the traditions and craftsmanship 
made famous by Italians both in Italy and 
here in Vermont. For example, there are 
many businesses valued for their commit-
ment to sharing Italian culture as business 
owners, native-born Italians, Italian Ameri-
cans and purveyors of Italian food, wine and 
Italian made products. And like Italy, 
Vermont has its own brand with its reputa-
tion built on local production, appreciation 
for quality and craftsmanship. 
Vermont and Italy share similar values 
and I believe there is already a deep appre-
ciation for Made in Italy. We are fortunate 
to have Italian farms like Agricola, a small 
diversified farm in Panton, VT run by 
Alessandra and Stefano. Both native Italians 
they are continuing the traditional methods 
for making authentic Italian salumi and 
have established Monti Verdi Salumi. More 
recently Trenchers Italian Farmhouse began 
producing and selling home-made pastas, 
sauces, bomboloni, focaccia and more at 
local farmers markets. Jenny and Giacomo 
Vascotto are also sharing traditional Italian 
techniques, practices and delicious food with 
a growing number of devoted followers. So 
you see, in some ways Made in Italy is also 
Made in Vermont. 
f 
RECOGNIZING DAN & WHIT’S 
GENERAL STORE 
Mr. 
LEAHY. 
Mr. 
President, 
in 
Vermont, the general store is the epi-
center of a community. It is where peo-
ple not only buy their groceries and 
newspapers, but also tools and hard-
ware, mittens and hats, axes and 
chainsaws, gas for their cars, and too 
many other things to name. But just as 
important, general stores are where 
Vermonters meet their neighbors, and 
when the weather is good, pass the 
time and talk about their families, 
things going on in town, or the state of 
the world. 
Marcelle and I have been to just 
about every general store in Vermont, 
and each one has its own history and 
character. One of them, Dan & Whit’s, 
stands out. Located in Norwich about 
halfway up the eastern side of the 
State bordering on the Connecticut 
River, the store that became Dan & 
Whit’s has been operating since 1891. It 
was originally called Merrill’s Store, 
and the old Merrill’s sign is still af-
fixed to the front. The same neon 
clock, mounted high on the front of the 
store’s fac¸ade, has told the time to the 
town since the 1950s. Made by the Elec-
tric Neon Clock Co. in Cleveland, it 
was recently restored and made energy 
efficient. 
In 1955, Dan Fraser and Whit Hicks, 
who had both worked at the store for 
over 20 years, bought it from Mr. Mer-
rill. Since then, Dan & Whit’s has been 
open for business 365 days a year, in-
cluding a half day on Christmas and a 
half day on Thanksgiving. Dan and 
Whit ran the store as partners, and 
Dan’s wife Eliza, known to all as 
‘‘Bunnie’’, did the bookkeeping in the 
raised office near the stationery and 
greeting cards until Whit retired and 
sold out in 1972. 
Dan, who from what I am told hardly 
took a day off during all those years, 
retired in 1993, and turned the manage-
ment of the store over to his sons 
George and Jack, and their sister Jane 
pitched in off and on. George’s wife 
Susan took over Bunnie’s job in the of-
fice, which hadn’t changed in decades, 
except the typewriter was replaced by 
a computer. Ownership of the store is 
currently shared between George and 
his two sons Dan and Matt. Dan, after 
a 14-year career as a special education 
teacher, has taken over the day-to-day 
management. 
Most townspeople have an account, 
so they can simply sign the register 
and pay the bill at the end of the 
month. At no charge for local calls, 
anyone can use the push-button phone 
with its long cord by the ice machine, 
and before cell phones, it was a vital 
link from the magical abundance of the 
store to the outside world: ‘‘Do we need 
anything at Dan & Whit’s?’’ 
There is a reason why the sign in the 
store window says, ‘‘If we don’t have it, 
you don’t need it,’’ because when you 
walk in and keep walking, the store 
never seems to end. Dan & Whit’s has 
got absolutely everything, at least ev-
erything a person could reasonably 
want or need. There is fresh fruit and 
vegetables, a selection of wines, kitch-
en utensils, bins of nails and boxes of 
screws, fishing tackle, ladders and 
rakes, paint, bags of horse feed, maple 
syrup and candy, toys, ice cream 
scooped on the premises in summer-
time, home-brewed beer, bright orange 
hunting caps, snow boots, plumbing 
and electrical supplies, shovels and 
wheelbarrows, wood stoves, birdseed, 
the local and national newspapers, a 
deli, gasoline pumps and an electric ve-
hicle charging station, and lots more. 
The place is kept warm in the winter 
by a wood-fired furnace in the base-
ment, requiring cords and cords of 
wood—delivered, split, and stacked be-
hind the Frasers’ homes, and there are 
solar panels on the roof. Dan & Whit’s 
has long been a favored stop for hikers 
on the Appalachian Trail, which passes 
through the center of Norwich. 
Over the years, Dan & Whit’s has 
hired local high school students to run 
the cash registers, and there was a 
time not that long ago when the em-
ployees who stocked the shelves and 
helped you find what you were looking 
for were long-timers like Larry Smith, 
who worked there for over 50 years. 
Recently, like so many other busi-
nesses in our State and around the 
country, it has been hard to find help. 
In fact, Dan & Whit’s was facing the 
real possibility of closing, which would 
have been devastating for the people of 
Norwich, as well as countless others 
who come there to shop, as well as 
former residents of Norwich who stop 
at the store just to be sure that it is 
the same as it always was. 
As many have remarked, Dan & 
Whit’s is the heart of Norwich, and los-
ing it would have changed everything. 
I can’t imagine Norwich without Dan & 
Whit’s, and I suspect just about every-
one who knows the store feels the same 
way. Real estate listings for property 
sales in the town include the distance 
from Dan & Whit’s. Hundreds of notices 
are along the wall by the entrance: dog 
lost, secondhand items for sale, yoga 
lessons, a free concert, snow plowing. 
It all happens at the general store. 
Fortunately, but not surprisingly, 
when word got out that the store might 
close, the people of Norwich came to 
the rescue, and Dan & Whit’s has not 
lost a day of business. I want to add my 
thanks to Dan and the volunteers who 
saved the heart of Norwich. They have 
reminded us of what is best about 
Vermont and, in doing so, have set an 
example for people everywhere. 
I ask unanimous consent that a piece 
written on December 7 by Robert 
Reich, former U.S. Secretary of Labor, 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
THE HEART OF A COMMUNITY: A SMALL 
BUSINESS 
(By Robert Reich) 
I’ve got a special place near my heart for 
Dan & Whit’s general store in Norwich, 
Vermont. It was there for me during my un-
dergraduate years in college in nearby Han-
over, New Hampshire—often on snowy eve-
nings when I couldn’t get supplies elsewhere. 
Years later, when my parents moved to 
Vermont for their retirement, Dan & Whit’s 
was there for them, too. 
Like many places around the country, 
Vermont has been struggling with finding 
enough workers to fill jobs. But unlike most 
urban centers, where the obvious answer is 
to pay workers more, rural towns can’t al-
ways count on higher wages to elicit more 
job applicants because populations are thin 
and often declining. And unlike profitable 
national retail chains, mom-and-pop busi-
nesses can’t just absorb higher labor costs. 
And they can’t simply pass them on to cus-
tomers in higher prices, because small-town 
customers might not have the ability to pay. 
So when Dan & Whit’s owner Dan Fraser 
recently put up a ‘‘Help Wanted’’ sign, the 
inhabitants of Norwich knew it was bad 
news. (I never met the younger Dan but I’m 
sure I met his grandfather, who passed the 
store on to his father, who passed it on to 
Dan.) After three generations, Dan would 
have to close the place down if he didn’t get 
help. So what was he to do? I heard the rest 
of the story on the radio. It turned out that 
Dan didn’t need to do anything. Word went 
out. Soon, Dan’s customers began applying 
for the jobs. Rick Ferrell, a local doctor, 
took on a shift at the register. A retired fi-
nance director applied for the deli counter. A 
nurse, a teacher, a psychology professor, a 
therapist, a school principal—nearly two 
dozen customers have stepped up to stock 
shelves, do the inventory, and clean up the 
place, so that Dan & Whit’s can remain open. 
(Virtually all of these new hires are donating 
their hourly wages to some of Dan’s favorite 
charities.) 
I’ve spent a lot of time over the years ex-
amining what happens to communities when 
important 
businesses 
close 
or 
abandon 
them—often because some bean counters 
back in headquarters hundreds or thousands 
of miles away decide it’s not worth the cost 
of keeping the businesses going where they 
are. Economists often praise capitalism’s 
wondrous ‘‘efficiencies’’ at moving assets to 
their ‘‘highest and best uses.’’ Well, there’s

something to that. But what’s left out of the 
equation are the social costs of these moves. 
They can be quite high. 
When asked why the people of Norwich 
stepped in to help Dan & Whit’s keep going, 
employee Dianne Miller said it was ‘‘because 
Dan & Whit’s is the heartbeat of this com-
munity.’’ Others described it as the ‘‘heart of 
the town.’’ That’s the best quick summary of 
the social benefits of a place like Dan & 
Whit’s I’ve ever heard. Communities do have 
hearts. When businesses at those hearts dis-
appear, more is lost than an economic asset. 
The community loses a place that allows it 
to be a community—a place where people 
meet up, congregate, exchange gossip and in-
formation, barter, learn about common prob-
lems, sometimes decide to take action. 
I remember Dan & Whit’s as such a place. 
I can’t imagine Norwich without it. Luckily, 
it won’t have to be. But this isn’t just a ‘‘feel 
good’’ story about one country town coming 
together to save an iconic general store. It 
seems to me there’s an important lesson here 
for all of us, wherever we live. 
American capitalism is the harshest form 
of capitalism in all of the world’s advanced 
economies. It takes almost no account of so-
cial costs and benefits. Businesses swoop in 
and swoop out wherever and however profits 
can be maximized and losses minimized. 
But communities are different. They aren’t 
nearly as footloose as financial capital. 
They’re built on social capital, which often 
takes years to accumulate and can’t be 
cashed in. 
I think people owe something to businesses 
that are the hearts of our communities. 
Maybe we shouldn’t allow big chains or 
Walmarts to drain our main streets of the 
commerce they need to survive. (Even if 
Walmart’s items are cheaper, the social costs 
of losing the small businesses that undergird 
our community are often way higher.) Maybe 
we should donate some of our own time and 
labor to account for the importance of these 
core businesses. Maybe those of us who can 
afford to should buy shares in them, to give 
them an added financial cushion. At the very 
least, we owe them our patronage—rather 
than, say, the Waltons or Jeff Bezos. 
What do you think?

NOMINATION OF DILAWAR SYED 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today to reiterate my strong support 
for Dilawar Syed to serve as Deputy 
Administrator of the U.S. Small Busi-
ness Administration. 
For those who are unfamiliar with 
Mr. Syed, he is a highly qualified and 
widely-supported nominee for Deputy 
Administrator, who has the backing of 
numerous business groups and organi-
zations. In many ways, he is the very 
picture of the American Dream, a 
businessowner, entrepreneur, and job 
creator who was born in Pakistan and 
educated in the United States. Mr. 
Syed also has firsthand experience 
dealing with challenges small busi-
nesses have faced during this pan-
demic. 
As Deputy Administrator, he would 
largely be responsible for running the 
day-to-day operations at SBA. He has 
repeatedly made himself available to 
discuss any concerns Republicans may 
still have related to his background 
and qualifications, things that actually 
matter in his ability to do his job. 
However, for reasons completely unre-
lated to his background and qualifica-
tions, Republicans on the Small Busi-
ness Committee have continued to 
block his nomination, for months. 
Earlier this summer, they disputed 
the results of a committee meeting we 
held to advance the nominee based on a 
technicality, even though Mr. Syed was 
approved during that meeting by voice 
vote. Since then, they have taken a dif-
ferent approach, deciding to boycott 
committee meetings on five separate 
occasions, denying a quorum to con-
sider the nominee. We are now at the 
point where Senate Republicans, even 
on this normally very bipartisan com-
mittee, will not even show up to pro-
vide fair consideration for this nomi-
nee. Not one Republican will show up. 
Over the course of the process, Re-
publicans have changed their reasons 
for blocking the nominee. First, they 
were concerned about SBA loans his 
company received during the pan-
demic, even though these loans were 
lawfully obtained and fully repaid be-
fore he was even nominated to be Dep-
uty Administrator. 
Then, they insinuated he was some-
how anti-Jewish and anti-Israel, de-
spite broad support he has received 
from within these communities. 
Now, they are concerned about lawful 
SBA loans to Planned Parenthood 
health centers. Just to be crystal clear, 
these health centers lawfully received 
loans through bipartisan COVID legis-
lation that was signed by President 
Trump. It is unacceptable to unfairly 
and unlawfully target organizations for 
political reasons. And it is even worse 
to then stall a qualified nominee be-
cause of this. 
When it comes down to it, Mr. Syed 
would be an asset to SBA and the busi-
nesses they serve. He deserves fair con-
sideration in the U.S. Senate. 
If Republicans actually cared about 
helping the small businesses struggling 
during the pandemic, they would stop 
blocking nominees to fill positions 
that are critical to helping them. 
Republicans should do their job and 
let us consider his nomination. Every 
day they continue this obstruction, 
they are doing a disservice to busi-
nesses in our country, which cannot af-
ford uncertainty at this time. 
Enough is enough. 
f 
NATIONAL DEFENSE 
AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to speak on the National Defense 
Authorization Act for fiscal year 2022. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act provides crucial resources for our 
Armed Forces and our national de-
fense, including a 2.7 percent pay in-
crease for our servicemembers and 
DOD civilian employees, parental and 
bereavement leave for servicemembers, 
and the creation of basic needs allow-
ance. I am glad that the Senate was 
able to come together on a bipartisan 
basis to pass this legislation to support 
our servicemembers, strengthen our 
national security, and invest in critical 
projects in my home State of Mary-
land, including over $500 million in au-
thorized military construction projects 
across the State. This legislation also 
includes several important pieces of 
legislation 
that 
I 
introduced 
to 
strengthen our Foreign Service, ensure 
that all students have a fair shot at at-
tending one of our Federal service 
academies, and support our Federal 
firefighters. While there are parts of 
this legislation that I have concerns 
with and important priorities that 
were left out, I believe that, on bal-
ance, this bill serves our national in-
terest. 
In particular, I am pleased that this 
NDAA includes the Foreign Service 
Families Act of 2021, which I intro-
duced with Senator Sullivan, with 
whom I cochair the Foreign Service 
Caucus. As the son of a Foreign Service 
Officer, I know the challenges that 
Foreign Service families face in access-
ing education and employment when 
they accompany our diplomats abroad. 
That is why I introduced this legisla-
tion, which authorizes expanded em-
ployment services for the spouses of 
Foreign Service officers serving over-
seas. It also extends in-state tuition at 
public colleges and universities for 
Foreign Service members and their 
families after 30 days of residency in a 
State and allows Foreign Service fami-
lies to terminate leases without pen-
alty when ordered to move for work. 
This legislation will make a real dif-
ference in the lives of our Foreign 
Service families and will help reduce 
attrition and attract the talented and 
diverse diplomatic workforce we need 
to compete on the global stage. It is 
modeled after benefits we extend to 
military families, who also have to 
move frequently in service to our coun-
try. 
I am also glad that this legislation 
includes the SERVE Act, which I intro-
duced with Senator CARDIN and Rep-
resentative BROWN. This bill ensures 
that high school students applying to 
attend one of our Federal service acad-
emies do not lose out on opportunities 
to be nominated because of a vacancy 
in Congress. After the tragic loss of my 
friend and colleague, Representative 
Elijah Cummings, my office learned 
that nomination slots at our service 
academies, like the U.S. Naval Acad-
emy in Annapolis, cease to exist if a 
seat in Congress is vacant at the time 
nominations are due. This meant that 
a student from Congressman Cum-
mings’ district had one-third fewer op-
portunities to receive a nomination to 
a service academy. As a result of this 
new law, Senators may make nomina-
tions on behalf of a vacant seat, ensur-
ing that students do not lose an oppor-
tunity to serve their country through 
no fault of their own. 
Further, I am glad Armed Services 
Committee agreed to include the Fed-
eral Firefighter Flexibility and Fair-
ness Act, which I introduced with Sen-
ators TESTER, COLLINS, and CARPER and 
Representatives SARBANES and WITT-
MAN. This legislation grants additional

flexibility to our Federal firefighters 
that their State and local counterparts 
have enjoyed for many years. As a re-
sult of this bill, Federal firefighters 
will be able to trade shifts across pay 
periods without negatively affecting 
their pay. 
This NDAA also establishes a consor-
tium on irregular warfare threats, a 
critical step in the transfer of the Na-
tional Consortium for the Study of 
Terrorism 
and 
Responses 
to 
Ter-
rorism—START—from the sponsorship 
of the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity to the Department of Defense, 
which has the resources to maintain 
this national security research. I pre-
viously worked to secure funding for 
this transition in the FY21 defense ap-
propriations bill. The National Consor-
tium for the Study of Terrorism and 
Responses to Terrorism, better known 
as START, is a university-based re-
search and education center based at 
the University of Maryland and com-
prised of an international network of 
scholars committed to the scientific 
study of the causes and human con-
sequences of terrorism in the United 
States and around the world. 
I am also glad the NDAA incor-
porates the Enhancing Military Base 
Resilience and Conserving Ecosystems 
through Stormwater Management Act, 
which 
I 
introduced 
with 
Senators 
KAINE, CARDIN, and WARNER. This bill 
authorizes the Defense Department to 
carry 
out 
stormwater 
management 
projects 
on 
military 
installations. 
These projects will improve installa-
tion resilience and essential infrastruc-
ture that supports military installa-
tions and protect nearby waterways 
like the Chesapeake Bay. In August, I 
worked to secure language in the FY22 
Military Construction-VA Appropria-
tions bill encouraging the Department 
of Defense to use Energy Resilience 
and Conservation Program funds to 
support 
stormwater 
management 
projects in the Chesapeake Bay water-
shed in order to better protect and con-
serve the health of the bay. 
I also want to thank my colleagues 
on the Senate Armed Services Com-
mittee for working with me to address 
the Army’s incorrect application of the 
law pertaining to the Prisoner of War 
Medal, which has negatively affected a 
Maryland veteran. In 2020, I asked the 
Army to award the POW Medal to 
Marylander Ronald Dolecki for his 
military service in Ethiopia in 1965, 
which he has been denied for over a 
decade. Mr. Dolecki clearly qualifies 
for the Medal under the criteria estab-
lished by Congress in the 2013 National 
Defense Authorization Act, but the 
Army continued to incorrectly apply 
the previous standard to his case. I am 
grateful to Chairman REED and Rank-
ing Member INHOFE for including lan-
guage directing the Army to rectify its 
incorrect application of the law to en-
sure that this Marylander who served 
his country with honor and distinction 
and others like him are appropriately 
recognized. 
Lastly, this bill includes funding and 
language that is critical to supporting 
Maryland’s military installations, in-
cluding more than $350 million for Fort 
Meade, more than $150 million for Wal-
ter Reed National Military Medical 
Center, and more than $30 million for 
Joint Base Andrews. The bill also in-
cludes report language ensuring the 
Army’s continued support for the dem-
olition of contaminated facilities at 
Aberdeen Proving Ground and provi-
sions to continue responding to the re-
cent crisis in privatized military hous-
ing which affected installations in 
Maryland and across the country. 
While I am pleased with many of the 
provisions included in this bill and 
voted for its passage, I do have signifi-
cant reservations. 
I appreciate that this bill codifies the 
GAO’s recommendations related to tac-
tical vehicle rollover accidents in re-
sponse to the tragic loss of lLT Conor 
McDowell, a U.S. marine who lost his 
life in a training accident at Camp 
Pendleton. 1LT McDowell showed ex-
traordinary bravery, saving the life of 
a fellow marine, and Congress has a re-
sponsibility to ensure that these pre-
ventable crashes end. The bill also in-
cludes a directive that the Department 
of Defense report on the cost and feasi-
bility of a pilot program that Senators 
CARDIN and Representatives BROWN and 
WITTMAN and I proposed in the the 1LT 
Hugh Conor McDowell Safety in Armed 
Forces Equipment Act of 2021. This 
simple, straightforward bill directs the 
Departments of the Army and the Navy 
to jointly implement a 5-year pilot pro-
gram to evaluate the prospect of using 
data recorders to monitor, assess, and 
improve the readiness and safety of the 
operation of military tactical vehicles. 
This commonsense program will im-
prove the safety of our men and women 
in uniform and save lives. I believe we 
could have proceeded with this pilot 
today, but look forward to receiving 
the mandated report no later than 
March 1, 2022, as directed, and I will 
continue to advocate vigorously for the 
implementation of this program. 
I am disappointed that the NOAA 
does not include my amendment to 
prohibit the use of funds for the re-
search and development, production or 
deployment of the nuclear-armed sea- 
launched cruise missile—SLCM–N—and 
its associated nuclear warhead. The 
United States already possesses an 
array of nonstrategic nuclear capabili-
ties that fulfill our theater nuclear de-
terrence missions and reassure our al-
lies of our extended deterrence com-
mitments. In its 2019 cost estimate of 
U.S. nuclear weapons programs, the 
CBO projected that the SLCM-N would 
cost $9 billion through 2028. This pro-
jection does not account for production 
costs after 2028, nor does it factor in 
costs associated with integrating the 
missile 
on 
ships, 
nuclear 
weapons 
training for personnel, and storage and 
security for nuclear warheads on naval 
bases. Not only is the program a waste 
of money, it will also dangerously raise 
the risk of nuclear miscalculation and 
escalation. 
I also believe that this bill fails to 
tackle the long-term budget challenges 
facing our country. In the midst of a 
pandemic that has taken the lives of 
more than 800,000 of our fellow Ameri-
cans, we simply cannot afford to con-
tinue this level of investment in de-
fense at the expense of other critical 
national priorities. I oppose the deci-
sion to invest an additional $25 billion 
over the President’s budget request for 
defense while we continue to under-
invest in diplomacy, development, and 
a wide range of critical domestic prior-
ities. 
Lastly, I am disappointed that the 
bill did not include my amendment 
with Representative JACOBS to close a 
loophole that allows some U.S. secu-
rity assistance to foreign forces with-
out being subject to Leahy law restric-
tions that bar U.S. military assistance 
to units credibly believed to have en-
gaged in gross violations of human 
rights. This is a simple, straight-
forward matter of the United States 
living up to our most basic commit-
ments as a member of the inter-
national 
community. 
The 
accom-
panying NDAA report language does 
require the presentation of a report de-
tailing the processes through which the 
Defense Department seeks to ensure 
that consideration is given to any cred-
ible information relating to violations 
of human rights by such entities, be-
fore support is given to them. I will be 
reviewing that report closely to deter-
mine what further action is necessary 
to safeguard human rights and ensure 
that no U.S. security assistance is ex-
empt from these commonsense restric-
tions. 
While I am opposed to some of the 
provisions in this bill and disappointed 
by the omission of others, I believe 
that, on balance, the NDAA will 
strengthen our national security and 
advance other important national pri-
orities. For that reason, I voted in sup-
port of final passage.

REMEMBERING DR. SHERIF R. 
ZAKI 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the life of Dr. Sherif R. 
Zaki, an exceptional leader at the CDC 
who passed away on November 21, 2021. 
Dr. Zaki, who joined the CDC in 1988, 
was the founder and branch chief of 
CDC’s Infectious Disease Pathology 
Branch, IDPB. During his tenure at 
CDC, Dr. Zaki’s vision and determina-
tion took the pathology laboratory to 
the forefront of the Agency’s work in 
responding to public health threats 
posed by various infectious disease 
agents and established this team to be 
as one of the most highly respected in-
fectious disease pathology laboratories 
in the world. 
Dr. Zaki was an internationally rec-
ognized expert in infectious disease pa-
thology, whose work over the past sev-
eral decades transformed CDC’s ap-
proach to the integration of pathology

as a core component of outbreak inves-
tigations. The rigorous and innovative 
laboratory work carried out by his 
team has advanced infectious disease 
experts’ knowledge of many pathogens 
and their role in the human disease 
process. These included investigations 
of hantavirus, leptospirosis, West Nile 
virus, anthrax, SARS coronaviruses, 
avian and human influenza viruses, 
Ebola virus, Zika virus, and numerous 
transplant-associated 
infections, 
to 
name only a few. As an author of hun-
dreds of publications and numerous 
textbook chapters, he is widely consid-
ered to be among the most influential 
infectious disease pathologists of his 
generation. 
As chief of IDPB, Dr. Zaki is widely 
recognized for his personal leadership, 
scientific contributions, and commit-
ment to CDC’s public health mission. 
Among his many awards are the HHS 
Secretary’s Awards for Distinguished 
Service, which he received nine times 
and is the highest honor at HHS. 
Known and respected for his humble-
ness, Dr. Zaki was uncomfortable with 
personal accolades and always quick to 
point to the efforts of his IDPB col-
leagues and others. Dr. Zaki was a gen-
erous teacher and mentor of younger 
scientists, friends, and former col-
leagues. 
My prayers are with Dr. Zaki’s wife 
Nadia, his two children, and friends 
during this difficult time. I am grateful 
for his dedication at the CDC, and I am 
honored to recognize his extraordinary 
contributions today.

TRIBUTE TO CHIEF MASTER 
SERGEANT JASON JENKINS 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize CMSgt Jason Jen-
kins for his dedicated service to the 
U.S. Air Force and the Senate as a Leg-
islative Defense Fellow. Jason served 
as a vital part of my team in 2020. He 
was a trusted adviser on issues relating 
to the Department of Defense, Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, and the De-
partment of Homeland Security. 
Jason’s effort and reliability distin-
guished him as a valuable member of 
my legislative team. In particular, 
Jason played an integral role in the re-
covery of Fort Smith native and World 
War II combat pilot Lt. Henry Donald 
Mitchell’s remains, a mission 77 years 
in the making. 
Jason took his responsibility to bring 
his fellow airman home very seriously. 
His steadfast dedication and persist-
ence were crucial to its success. He 
worked tirelessly to ensure the United 
States and Austrian officials, private 
landowners, and Defense POW/MIA Ac-
counting Agency leaders coordinated 
and engaged to achieve the right out-
come. It would not have been possible 
without the efforts of Jason. He helped 
bring closure and resolution to Lt. 
Mitchell’s community and loved ones, 
allowing them to close that chapter 
and find the comfort that been so elu-
sive after his remains were buried in 
the Fayetteville National Cemetery. 
Jason also diligently worked to help 
secure resources for our servicemem-
bers, their families, and Arkansans 
through his support of the Senate Ap-
propriations 
Defense 
Subcommittee 
and the successful passage of the fiscal 
year 2021 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. His passion to serve veterans 
and their families was demonstrated 
through his contributions to veteran 
legislation he advised on, including the 
John Scott Hannon Mental Health Care 
Improvement Act of 2019. 
I also want to thank Jason’s wife, 
Jami, and his children, Mike and 
Skyla, for their support of Jason’s con-
tinued service to the U.S. Air Force. As 
the son of an Air Force master ser-
geant, I understand service to the 
Armed Forces is a family affair and is 
impossible without their sacrifice and 
unconditional 
support. 
Jason’s 
son 
Mike has followed in his dad’s footsteps 
and is currently serving in the U.S. Air 
Force in London. 
A special highlight during Jason’s 
time in my office was his promotion to 
chief master sergeant, a testament to 
his family, unlimited potential, and 
passion to serve others. 
Jason, thank you for your continued 
service to the U.S. Air Force and for 
your time working in my office. It was 
our privilege to have you as a part of 
our team. My office will always wel-
come you. I know that you will be an 
asset to whatever future endeavors you 
pursue, and I wish you and your family 
the best.

TRIBUTE TO SENIOR MASTER 
SERGEANT CARLOS SANCHEZ 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize SMSgt Carlos San-
chez for his dedicated service to the 
U.S. Air Force and the Senate as a Leg-
islative Defense Fellow. Carlos has 
served as a vital part of my team since 
January 2021. He has been a trusted ad-
viser on issues relating to the Depart-
ment of Defense, Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, and the Department of 
Homeland Security. 
Carlos enlisted in the U.S. Air Force 
in 2002. His continued service is a re-
minder of the sacrifices necessary to 
maintain the opportunities available 
to us as U.S. citizens. 
Carlos’s effort and passion to serve 
distinguished him as a valuable mem-
ber of my legislative team. His deter-
mination was evident and helped lead 
to passage of the transformative SAVE 
LIVES Act, which allowed the VA to 
provide COVID–19 vaccinations to all 
veterans and their spouses. When pre-
paring for a Senate Veterans’ Affairs 
Committee hearing earlier this year, 
Carlos posed a question that led to the 
introduction and passage of this crit-
ical legislation. 
Carlos was also instrumental in the 
final months of the effort that led to 
the recovery of World War II combat 
pilot Lt. Henry Donald Mitchell. After 
years of work by Lt. Mitchell’s broth-
er, Bob Mitchell, and my office to lo-
cate and return this Fort Smith native 
home, Carlos helped ensure the au-
thorities could access and correctly 
identify Lt. Mitchell. 
His desire to serve his fellow airmen 
was demonstrated through his work in 
coordinating the first visit by Chief 
Master Sergeant of the Air Force Jo-
Anne Bass to Little Rock Air Force 
Base. Because of that experience, I be-
lieve the needs of our airmen and their 
families were further elevated and will 
result in an even higher prioritizing of 
getting them the resources and support 
needed to successfully execute their 
mission. 
Carlos’s steadfast dedication to serve 
and support the people of Arkansas has 
been inspirational. While in Arkansas, 
he spoke with and listened to the con-
cerns of Arkansan veterans and their 
families, then worked tirelessly to en-
sure their concerns were heard and 
issues were resolved. 
We have been very fortunate during 
Carlos’s time in my office. I also want 
to thank his wife, Laura, and his 
daughters Sophia and Isabella, for 
their support of Carlos’s time in uni-
form. As the son of an Air Force mas-
ter sergeant, I understand service to 
the Armed Forces is a family affair and 
is impossible without their sacrifice 
and unconditional support. 
Carlos, thank you for your continued 
service to the U.S. Air Force and for all 
your heartfelt, committed work as a 
member of my staff. It was our privi-
lege to have you as a part of our team, 
and our office will always welcome 
you. I know that you will remain an 
asset to our military and veterans in 
addition to any other endeavors you 
pursue, and I wish you and your family 
the best.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MARIA GOMEZ 
∑ Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, I 
rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary 
leader, a visionary healthcare advo-
cate, and a tireless champion for the 
people of my state and for citizens 
across the National Capital Region: 
Maria Gomez. Ms. Gomez is retiring 
this month after 33 years as the presi-
dent and CEO of Mary’s Center, a re-
nowned federally-qualified health cen-
ter that she founded in 1988, and which 
has transformed the lives of countless 
individuals and families throughout 
our region. Her tireless efforts to im-
prove the health and well-being of un-
derserved families and individuals in 
the Washington, DC, metropolitan area 
have left an indelible mark on our 
communities, and her lifetime of serv-
ice has inspired a new generation of ac-
tivists, advocates, healthcare leaders, 
and public servants. I would like to 
share her story today and have the 
course of her life forever written into 
the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
Ms. Gomez immigrated to the United 
States from Colombia with her mother

December 16, 2021 
at age 13 to escape violence and find 
new opportunities. Together, they built 
a life in Washington, DC, through hard 
work, courage, and the determination 
to succeed. By means of her own grit 
and skill, along with the support of a 
loving mother, Ms. Gomez obtained a 
bachelor of science in nursing from 
Georgetown University and a master of 
public health from the University of 
California at Berkeley. Following grad-
uation, she returned to the District of 
Columbia to empower the very same 
community that had empowered her 
when she first arrived in the United 
States. 
After first working at DC Health, the 
Red Cross, and the Visiting Nurses As-
sociation, Ms. Gomez founded Mary’s 
Center with a group of health advo-
cates and the DC Mayor’s Office on 
Latino Affairs. Her goal was to help 
immigrant women fleeing war and pov-
erty in Central America. But what 
began as the shared vision of one per-
son and a small group of community 
and government partners would soon 
grow into a nationally renowned health 
center that has touched the lives of 
thousands. 
Under 
Ms. 
Gomez’s 
leadership, 
Mary’s Center went from serving 200 
participants in a small basement with 
a budget of $250,000 to serving more 
than 60,000 participants across seven 
locations in DC and Maryland, with an 
annual budget of $76 million in just 
over 30 years. The center and the peo-
ple who work there are committed to 
providing the highest quality of care to 
each and every patient, regardless of 
their ability to pay, and the mission of 
Mary’s Center is guided by core prin-
ciples of care, education, social justice, 
and respect. I have had the privilege of 
visiting Mary’s Center locations in my 
State of Maryland while serving in the 
Senate, and I have witnessed, first-
hand, 
the 
extraordinary 
attention, 
compassion and professionalism that 
the entire Mary’s Center family brings 
to everything they do. It is because of 
their work that so many within our 
communities can receive support and 
critical services. 
That is Maria Gomez’s legacy, and 
our State and our Nation are deeply 
grateful for all she has given to our fel-
low citizens in need. Her extraordinary 
achievements have made Ms. Gomez 
one of the most effective and highly re-
garded 
leaders 
in 
the 
region 
and 
throughout the country. It was Ms. 
Gomez’s hard work and dedication that 
led First Lady Michelle Obama to 
choose Mary’s Center for her first offi-
cial visit to a nonprofit organization in 
February 2009. In 1995, First Lady Hil-
lary Clinton also visited Mary’s Center 
during National Immunization Week in 
recognition of the center’s efforts to 
get children vaccinated and ready to 
learn and thrive in school. What is 
more, President Barack Obama se-
lected Maria Gomez as one of the 18 re-
cipients of the 2012 Presidential Citi-
zens Medal, the Nation’s second-high-
est civilian honor, as a testament to 
her leadership and service. 
Ms. Gomez has accrued decades of 
wisdom over the course of her distin-
guished career, and she has always 
been willing to share that wisdom and 
knowledge with those who seek it. DC 
Mayor Muriel Bowser, as well as 
former Mayors Vincent Gray and Adri-
an Fenty, named her to their mayoral 
transition teams. She currently serves 
as cochair of the Human Services, So-
cial Services, and Health Committee of 
the DC Mayor’s ReOpen DC Advisory 
Group for COVID–19, and she is a mem-
ber of the Mayor’s Commission on 
Healthcare Systems Transformations, 
which 
makes 
recommendations 
on 
strategies and investments necessary 
to transform healthcare in the District 
of Columbia. 
Ms. Gomez also shares her expertise 
by serving as a board member for the 
DC Primary Care Association and the 
Primary Care Coalition of Montgomery 
County. She is a member of the Subur-
ban Hospital Board of Trustees, is co-
chair of the Latino Health Steering 
Committee of Montgomery County, 
and serves on the advisory boards for 
the Smithsonian American Women His-
tory Initiative, the DC Fiscal Policy 
Institute, and the AmeriHealth Caritas 
National FQHC Initiative. In addition, 
she is a member of the Washington 
Housing Conservancy—WHC—Board. 
While Ms. Gomez is the recipient of 
numerous well-earned awards and acco-
lades, no medal or trophy that we can 
give to her can truly speak to all that 
she has given us throughout her inspir-
ing life and career. She has been a bea-
con of hope for so many families in 
need over the past three decades. She 
leaves behind a legacy of deep compas-
sion for all whom she has met and 
known and helped and served. Ms. 
Gomez’s colleagues regard her as a 
strong leader, a dedicated mentor, and 
a friend to all, and the entire Mary’s 
Center 
community 
treasures 
the 
warmth, grace, and respect she has im-
parted throughout the organization 
these past 33 years. 
Our Nation’s Capital is healthier and 
stronger because of Maria Gomez’s 
many years of visionary leadership and 
dedicated service. I ask my colleagues 
to join me in expressing our deepest 
gratitude to her and in extending our 
best wishes to her and to her husband 
Michael 
Rexrode 
and 
daughter 
Amalia—as she begins the next chapter 
of her life of service to her community 
and her country.∑

PETITIONS AND MEMORIALS 
The following petitions and memo-
rials were laid before the Senate and 
were referred or ordered to lie on the 
table as indicated: 
POM–99. A resolution adopted by the House 
of Representatives of the State of Michigan 
urging the United States Congress to take 
action to mitigate the depletion of the So-
cial Security and Medicare trust funds; to 
the Committee on Finance. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 157 
Whereas, Social Security benefits are paid 
to more than 65 million Americans, includ-
ing some who use the financial resource to 
stay out of poverty. Approximately 21.7 mil-
lion Americans would have been in poverty 
in 2020 without Social Security benefits. Vul-
nerable individuals, including the aging pop-
ulation and people with disabilities, depend 
on Social Security to supplement other 
forms of income. The Social Security Admin-
istration reports that Social Security bene-
fits account for at least one-third of the in-
come of the elderly; and 
Whereas, Medicare helps pay medical costs 
for over 57 million individuals per year on 
average. Medicare allows for individuals to 
receive medical care and prescription drugs 
that they otherwise may not be able to af-
ford. Many people enrolled in Medicare live 
with health problems and almost half of en-
rollees have incomes below 200 percent of the 
federal poverty level. Estimates showed that 
19 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had no 
other form of supplemental insurance in 2016; 
and 
Whereas, Projections in Social Security 
and Medicare trustees reports estimate that 
Social Security will only be able to pay 78 
percent of scheduled benefits by 2034, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S9259 
December 16, 2021 
Medicare will only be able to pay 91 percent 
of full costs by 2026. Americans will suffer 
without essential benefits paid by these pro-
grams, despite paying tax dollars towards 
Social Security and Medicare. Lacking full 
Medicare benefits, many Americans will not 
be able to afford crucial medical services. 
The depiction of these social safety nets 
poses a great threat to not only current 
beneficiaries, but all those who may benefit 
in the future; now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the House of Representatives, 
That we urge the United States Congress to 
take action to mitigate the depletion of the 
Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds; 
and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States Senate, the Speaker of the United 
States House of Representatives, and the 
members of the Michigan congressional dele-
gation. 
POM–100. A resolution adopted by the 
House of Representatives of the State of 
Ohio urging the United States Congress and 
the President of the United States to, with 
haste, take action to bring home the mis-
sionaries who have been taken hostage in 
Haiti; to the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions. 
HOUSE RESOLUTION NO. 147 
Whereas, Seventeen missionaries were kid-
napped by a gang in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, as 
they were leaving an orphanage; and 
Whereas, Local authorities said the group 
that was kidnapped included sixteen Ameri-
cans and one Canadian; and 
Whereas, Haiti has been in a state of polit-
ical upheaval for years, and kidnappings of 
the rich and poor alike are alarmingly com-
mon; and 
Whereas, Violence is surging across Port- 
au-Prince, which is controlled by gangs. By 
some estimates, gangs now control roughly 
half of the city; and 
Whereas, The kidnappers have released a 
video threatening to put a bullet in the 
heads of the hostages, including an eight- 
month-old baby if their demands are not 
met; and 
Whereas, The fate of the hostages should 
not be left in the hands of kidnappers who 
have no regard for human life; and 
Whereas, An evaluation of the nation’s 
conscience demands that the federal govern-
ment use any and all means available to en-
sure that the seventeen missionaries, who 
without fault were acting in good faith to 
help Haitians in need, be brought to safety; 
now therefore be it 
Resolved, That we, the members of the Ohio 
House of Representatives of the 134th Gen-
eral Assembly of the State of Ohio, urge the 
United States Congress and the President of 
the United States, with haste, to take action 
to bring home the missionaries who have 
been taken hostage in Haiti; and be it fur-
ther 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives transmit duly authenticated 
copies of this resolution to the President of 
the United States, the Secretary of the 
United States Department of Defense, the 
President of the United States Senate, the 
Speaker of the United States House of Rep-
resentatives, each member of the Ohio con-
gressional delegation, and the news media of 
Ohio. 
POM–101. A resolution adopted by the Sen-
ate of the State of Michigan urging the fed-
eral government to allow persons under the 
age of 21 to operate commercial vehicles on 
interstate routes; to the Committee on Com-
merce, Science, and Transportation. 
SENATE RESOLUTION NO. 89 
Whereas, In most states, including Michi-
gan, drivers 18 years and older may obtain a 
commercial driver’s license (CDL) to operate 
commercial vehicles within state lines. How-
ever, federal regulations prohibit persons 
under the age of 21 from operating a com-
mercial motor vehicle across state lines; and 
Whereas, Since the start of the COVID–19 
pandemic, trucking companies have lost be-
tween 5% to 15% of their drivers. Age restric-
tions on interstate trucking has made it 
more difficult to replace outgoing drivers ex-
asperating an already tight labor market; 
and 
Whereas, The Developing Responsible Indi-
viduals for a Vibrant Economy Act (DRIVE 
Safe Act) has been introduced in the United 
States Senate to address the shortage of 
truck drivers across the country. Introduced 
in March 2021, the DRIVE Safe Act would di-
rect the U.S. Department of Transportation 
to create regulations to implement an ap-
prenticeship program for licensed commer-
cial motor vehicle drivers under the age of 
21; require apprentice drivers to complete at 
least 400 hours of on-duty time and 240 hours 
of driving time with an experienced driver; 
and require all commercial motor vehicles 
used in the apprenticeship program to be 
equipped with safety technology. This legis-
lation would ensure that individuals between 
the ages of 18 and 21, many of whom are al-
ready licensed and driving in their resident 
states, are trained and available to address 
the truck driver shortage. Further, the act 
will create additional career opportunities 
for young adults at the time they are enter-
ing the workforce; Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate, That we urge the 
federal government to allow persons under 
the age of 21 to operate commercial trucks 
on interstate routes; and be it further 
Resolved, That copies of this resolution be 
transmitted to the President of the United 
States, the Speaker of the United States 
House of Representatives, the President of 
the United States Senate, and members of 
the Michigan congressional delegation. 
POM–102. A petition from a citizen of the 
State of Texas relative to amending federal 
laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary. 
POM–103. A resolution adopted by the 
Board of Supervisors of the City and County 
of San Francisco, California, urging the 
President of the United States to extend 
funding assistance from FEMA to maintain 
non-congregate 
shelter 
in 
place 
hotels 
through the year of 2022; to the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Governmental Af-
fairs.

Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3412 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Preventing 
Mandates on Toddlers Act’’. 
SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING THE HHS 
RULE ON HEAD START COVID VAC-
CINE AND MASK REQUIREMENTS. 
Notwithstanding any other law, no funds

ices shall be obligated or expended to— 
(1) implement or enforce the rule sub-
mitted by the Department of Health and 
Human Services relating to ‘‘Vaccine and 
Mask Requirements To Mitigate the Spread 
of COVID–19 in Head Start Programs’’ (86 
Fed. Reg. 68052 (November 30, 2021)); or 
(2) promulgate, implement, or enforce any 
rule, regulation, or other agency statement, 
that is substantially similar to the rule de-

By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, and Mr. PADILLA): 
S. 3422. A bill to establish a grant 
program to support schools of medicine 
and schools of osteopathic medicine in 
underserved areas; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, commu-
nities of color and those living in rural 
and underserved areas face significant 
barriers to healthcare, including physi-
cian shortages that have only been ex-
acerbated during the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Unfortunately, in many commu-
nities of color and rural areas, there 
are few pathways to enter the medical 
profession. While medical school en-
rollment is up by 30 percent, the num-
ber of students from rural areas enter-
ing medical school declined by 28 per-
cent between 2002 and 2017, with only 
4.3 percent of all incoming medical stu-
dents coming from rural areas in 2017. 
Similarly, Black, Hispanic/Latino, and 
Native American students face several 
barriers to matriculate and graduate 
from medical school, and there is sig-
nificant underrepresentation of these 
students at all U.S. medical schools 
with 
the 
exception 
of 
historically 
Black medical schools. These medical 
schools represent 2.6 percent of all 
medical schools but 15 percent of Black 
medical students, indicating the im-
portant role that these institutions 
play in increasing the diversity of the 
physician workforce. Health outcomes 
for patients of color improve when they 
receive care from doctors of their own 
racial or ethnic background, and the 
shortage of providers of color exacer-
bates the barriers to care that these 
communities experience. The COVID–19 
pandemic 
worsened 
long 
standing 
health inequities, and it is critical that 
we expand the diversity of our physi-
cian workforce to tackle these rampant 
disparities and the systemic biases 
within our health care system. 
This is why I am introducing the Ex-
panding Medical Education Act, which 
aims to tackle the lack of representa-
tion of rural students, underserved stu-
dents, and students of color in the phy-
sician pipeline by encouraging the re-
cruitment, enrollment, and retention 
of students from disadvantaged back-
grounds. The bill would provide grants 
through the Health Resources and 
Services Administration, HRSA, to col-
leges and universities to establish or 
expand allopathic or osteopathic med-
ical schools in underserved areas or at 
minority-serving institutions, includ-
ing historically Black colleges and uni-
versities, HBCUs. These grants can be 
used for planning and construction of a 
medical school in an areas in which no 
other school is based; hiring diverse 
faculty and staff; recruitment, enroll-
ment, and retention of students; and 
other purposes to ensure increased rep-
resentation of rural students, under-
served students, and students of color 
in our physician workforce. 
Our rural communities and commu-
nities of color face significant chal-
lenges accessing healthcare. It is time 
our physician workforce reflected these 
communities. We need to diversify our 
physician pipeline and change the dis-
parity in representation, and this bill 
will help get us there. I am proud to re-
introduce this important legislation to 
help us get one step closer to ensuring 
communities across Virginia and the 
Nation have access to the medical pro-
fessionals they need. I hope the Senate 
passes this legislation quickly. 
By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Mr. LUJA´ N): 
S. 3427. A bill to authorize the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to establish a Neuroscience Center of 
Excellence; 
to 
the 
Committee 
on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President I rise 
today with my colleague, Senator BEN 
RAY LUJA´ N, to introduce the Neuro-
science Center of Excellence Act of 
2021, legislation that would establish a 
Neuroscience Center of Excellence at 
the Food and Drug Administration, 
FDA. This program would be modeled 
after FDA’s Oncology Center or Excel-
lence, which was authorized through 
the 2lst Century Cures Act. Building 
off 
that 
successful 
and 
bipartisan 
model, I hope we can make critical ad-
vances for those living with neuro-
logical diseases. 
In July, FDA’s Director of the Center 
for Drug Evaluation and Research tes-
tified that neuroscience is an area of 
medicine where there is tremendous 
unmet need, and neurodegenerative 
diseases are particularly challenging 
from both a research and a drug devel-
opment perspective. I have seen this 
firsthand as founder and cochairman of 
the Senate Alzheimer’s Disease Caucus. 
I have vigorously advocated for record 
funding increases to support additional 
NIH research over the past 25 years. 
Over the past year, many have noted 
the success of Operation Warp Speed 
and wondered why we can’t achieve the 
same rapid progress in other health 
conditions. 
The Neuroscience Center of Excel-
lence would encompass more than 20 
neurological diseases, including condi-
tions that are very rare. For example, 
Huntington’s disease is an inherited

disease characterized by the progres-
sive loss of brain and muscle function. 
It has sometimes been described as 
having ALS, Parkinson’s, and Alz-
heimer’s 
simultaneously. 
It 
is 
an 
autosomal dominant condition, so fam-
ilies with a history of Huntington’s dis-
ease can see it appear in every genera-
tion. In Maine, Nancy Patterson has 
seen Huntington’s disease in four gen-
erations of family. In addition, I lost a 
friend and coworker in former Senator 
Bill Cohen’s office to this devastating 
disease. Sadly, there is no cure. 
Through our bill, this new Neuro-
science Center of Excellence would es-
tablish several programs aimed at sup-
porting innovation. The first is to iden-
tify some of the current and emerging 
regulatory science and public policy 
challenges associated with developing 
medical products for neuroscience dis-
eases and disorders through a series of 
public meetings and guidances. The 
Center of Excellence would also estab-
lish a program to facilitate both the 
collection and the systematic use of 
patient experience data in the develop-
ment of medical products for neuro-
science diseases and disorders. 
Another component of the Center’s 
work would be around using digital 
technologies, an area of much promise. 
In 2018, the National Academies of 
Medicine Forum on Neuroscience and 
Nervous System Disorders hosted a 
workshop on using mobile technology 
to advance research and treatment of 
central nervous system disorders. As 
Dr. William Marks, head of clinical 
neurology at Verily Life Sciences, ob-
served, the current state of assessing 
brain disorders is ‘‘exquisitely crude’’ 
and there is a large unmet need for bet-
ter measures of disease burden that are 
objective, 
quantitative, 
more 
fre-
quently measured, and in the context 
of normal life. 
Finally, the center would help pro-
mote inclusion of traditionally under-
represented populations in the research 
and development of medical products 
for neuroscience diseases and disorders 
through public meetings and industry 
guidance. Senator LUJA´ N and I have 
worked together on this issue before as 
part of our Equity in Neuroscience and 
Alzheimer’s Clinical Trials Act of 2021. 
Whether the barrier to participation is 
a distrust of the medical community or 
logistics concerns like time and travel, 
we need to overcome those hurdles in 
order to ensure the best possible 
science. 
Researchers from the University of 
South Florida looked at the nine most 
prevalent and costly diagnosed neuro-
logical disorders and found the annual 
cost totaled nearly $800 billion. We des-
perately need to change this trajectory 
and renew our focus on these critical 
unmet needs. I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation.

ance that Russia would respect its sov-
ereignty; 
Whereas, on February 8, 1994, Ukraine was

protests 
began 
on 
Independence

pend signing the Ukraine-European Union 
(EU) Association Agreement and instead pur-
sue closer ties with the Russian Federation;

Ukraine’s integration with the European 
Union and against widespread Yanukovych 
regime corruption; 
Whereas, from February 18-20, 2014, an esti-
mated 104 people were killed and 2,500 in-
jured as a result of violent crackdowns by 
authorities against protesters;

Russian Federation clandestinely invaded 
Ukraine, with Russian troops claiming to be 
Ukrainian separatists, and since then have 
militarily occupied the regions of Crimea

implemented; 
Whereas at least 14,000 Ukrainians have 
been killed defending their homeland and 
millions more displaced since the conflict 
with Russia began; 
Whereas, on September 1, 2017, the Euro-
pean Union-Ukraine Association Agreement 
came into force; 
Whereas, on April 21, 2019, President

form of fighting corruption and restarting 
peace talks with Russian-backed separatists; 
Whereas, on July 16, 2019, the United 
States Senate unanimously passed S. Res. 74 
(116th Congress), marking the fifth anniver-
sary of Ukraine’s Revolution of Dignity by 
honoring the bravery, determination, and 
sacrifice of the people of Ukraine during and 
since the Revolution, and condemning con-
tinued Russian aggression against Ukraine; 
Whereas, in early and again in late 2021, 
Russia deployed a massive troop and weap-
ons buildup on the border with Ukraine; 
Whereas, on December 1, 2021, NATO Sec-
retary General Jens Stoltenberg said that if 
Russia decides to once again ‘‘use force 
against Ukraine, then we have made it 
clear. . . during the NATO Foreign Minister 
meeting in Latvia today that Russia will 
then have to pay a high price; there will be 
serious 
consequences 
for 
Russia. . .And 
that’s a clear message from NATO.’’; 
Whereas, on December 7, 2021, President 
Joseph R. Biden warned Russian President 
Vladimir Putin that the West would impose 
‘‘strong economic and other measures’’ if 
Russia invades Ukraine; and

ing in Liverpool, delegates of the Group of 
Seven (G7) released a joint statement saying, 
‘‘Russia should be in no doubt that further 
military aggression against Ukraine would 
have massive consequences and severe cost 
in response. . . We reaffirm our unwavering 
commitment to Ukraine’s sovereignty and 
territorial integrity, as well as the right of 
any sovereign state to determine its own fu-
ture.’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) denounces the current Russian military 
buildup on the Ukraine boarder as provoca-
tive, reckless, and contrary to established 
international norms; 
(2) reaffirms unwavering United States 
support for a secure, democratic, and inde-
pendent Ukraine free to choose its own lead-
ers and future; 
(3) reaffirms unwavering United States and

ACT 
AND 
THE 
LASTING IMPACT OF THAT ACT 
ON THE STATE OF ALASKA AND 
ALASKA NATIVE PEOPLE 
Mr. SULLIVAN (for himself and Ms. 
MURKOWSKI) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Indian Affairs: 
S. RES. 482 
Whereas the Alaska Native Claims Settle-
ment Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (referred to 
in this preamble as ‘‘ANCSA’’) was signed 
into law on December 18, 1971, to settle long- 
standing issues of Alaska Native aboriginal 
land claims in the State of Alaska (referred 
to in this preamble as the ‘‘State’’); 
Whereas the 1970s welcomed a new era of 
Federal Indian policy, one of economic and 
self-determination, 
with 
the 
passage 
of 
ANCSA; 
Whereas title to 44,000,000 acres of land and 
$962,500,000 were transferred to Alaska Native 
people as a result of the land claims settle-
ment under ANCSA, including— 
(1) title to property in the clearly defined 
traditional homelands of Alaska Native peo-
ple; and 
(2) money to help compensate for the land 
Alaska Native people would not receive; 
Whereas the purpose of the land claims set-
tlement under ANCSA was to ensure the so-
cial and economic well-being of Alaska Na-
tive people without creating a lengthy ward-
ship under the Federal Government; 
Whereas ANCSA mandated— 
(1) the creation of— 
(A) 12 land-owning and for-profit Re-
gional Corporations covering all of the 
State; and 
(B) 1 non-land-owning Regional Corpora-
tion for non-residents of the State; and 
(2) the incorporation of over 200 Village 
Corporations and Urban Corporations within 
each region of the State, either as for-profit 
or nonprofit corporations, with the land, as-
sets, and businesses of those corporations to 
be owned by Native shareholders; 
Whereas ANCSA redefined Alaska Native 
land ownership by conveying Native-owned 
fee simple title to the newly-created Native 
Corporations and, through those Corpora-
tions, to Alaska Native shareholders of each 
Corporation, rather than using the land own-
ership model used in the 48 contiguous 
States of designating reservations held in 
trust by the Federal Government; 
Whereas, recognizing the uneven distribu-
tion of natural resources in the State among 
the 12 regions in the State, subsections (i) 
and (j) of section 7 of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 1606) 
include provisions that reflect the Alaska 
Native values of sharing and cooperation; 
Whereas, under section 7 of ANCSA (43 
U.S.C. 1606)— 
(1) 70 percent of the annual revenues of 
each land-owning Regional Corporation de-
rived from the land of that Regional Cor-
poration are required under subsection (i) of 
that section to be shared with all other Re-
gional Corporations; and 
(2) Regional Corporations are then re-
quired, under subsection (j) of that section, 
to share 50 percent of the revenues described 
in paragraph (1) with— 
(A) the Village Corporations and Urban 
Corporations that are located in the same 
region as the applicable Regional Corpora-
tion; and 
(B) the at-large shareholders of the appli-
cable Regional Corporation; 
Whereas each Regional Corporation, at 
times, has received more shared revenue 
under section 7(i) of ANCSA (43 U.S.C. 
1606(i)) than internally produced revenue, 
demonstrating the importance of incor-
porating the Alaska Native values of sharing 
and cooperation into ANCSA; 
Whereas, under ANCSA during the 50-year 
period preceding the date of adoption of this 
resolution, Alaska Native people have man-
aged their land successfully, fostering sus-
tainable businesses and creating employ-
ment opportunities for all Alaskans, Native 
and non-Native, and people across the United 
States and around the world; 
Whereas ANCSA has benefitted all Alas-
kans— 
(1) through diversifying the economy of the 
State; and 
(2) by bringing revenue and expertise back 
to the State through Native Corporation 
business ventures in the national and inter-
national realms; 
Whereas ANCSA has been amended by al-
most every Congress since the enactment of 
that Act in 1971, with some of the most sig-
nificant and lasting amendments being en-
acted in the Alaska Native Claims Settle-
ment Act Amendments of 1987 (Public Law 
100–241; 101 Stat. 1788) (commonly known as 
the ‘‘1991 amendments’’) (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘1991 amendments’’); 
Whereas among the provisions in the 1991 
amendments was an extension of the prohibi-
tion on the sale of Native Corporation stock 
in perpetuity unless a majority of all share-
holders of the applicable Native Corporation 
voted to remove that restriction, which— 
(1) enabled shares to be held mostly by the 
Alaska Native people; and 
(2) allowed Alaska Native people to pass 
that stock from 1 generation to the next and, 
as a result, increase the number of Alaska 
Native shareholders in a Native Corporation; 
Whereas another provision in the 1991 
amendments allowed shareholders of each 
Native Corporation to vote to include de-
scendants of original shareholders born after 
the date of enactment of ANCSA to become 
shareholders regardless of date of birth; 
Whereas the pioneering work of Alaska Na-
tive leaders of the mid-20th century created 
a lasting legacy of professional, personal, 
and historic economic success; 
Whereas Alaska Native people have pros-
pered from their own initiative and innova-
tive approaches to fostering economic devel-
opment through self-determination; 
Whereas Alaska Native resiliency, leader-
ship, and relentless work ethic have devel-
oped and supported some of the previously

most underserved regions in the United 
States into some of the most thriving, im-
proving life expectancy and health condi-
tions in those very regions; 
Whereas subsequent to ANCSA ushering in 
the era of self-determination in Federal In-
dian policy, the Indian Self-Determination 
and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 5301 
et seq.) (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘ISDEAA’’) was enacted in 1975; 
Whereas the ISDEAA defined Native Cor-
porations as Indian Tribes for the purposes 
of that Act; 
Whereas, because of the ISDEAA, federally 
recognized Alaska Native Tribes and Native 
Corporations have worked together to serve 
as providers for health, housing, and other 
Tribal services; 
Whereas, beyond monetary benefits to 
shareholders, Native Corporations, through 
the structure and mandates of ANCSA, pro-
vide countless additional benefits, includ-
ing— 
(1) scholarships; 
(2) burial and funeral assistance; 
(3) internships; 
(4) language revitalization programs; 
(5) careers; and 
(6) culture camps; 
Whereas education has, and continues to 
be, a key focus for Regional Corporations, 
which is evidenced by the fact that all 12 
land-owning Regional Corporations have— 
(1) education foundations to help support 
shareholders and descendants who want to 
advance their educational endeavors; and 
(2) as of the date of adoption of this resolu-
tion, awarded more than 54,000 individual 
scholarships; 
Whereas Alaska Native people hold numer-
ous positions of leadership in the State and 
beyond, inspiring younger generations of 
Alaskans; 
Whereas further improvements to ANCSA 
must continue in order to fulfill all of the 
promises of ANCSA and all of the promises 
made by the Federal Government to Alaska 
Native people; 
Whereas the dedication and enthusiasm of 
the next generations of Alaska Native lead-
ers honors the previous generations of Alas-
ka Native leaders who worked diligently to 
achieve the most significant Native land set-
tlement in the history of the United States; 
Whereas, with the adoption of Senate Res-
olution 351, 112th Congress, agreed to Decem-
ber 17, 2011, the Senate recognized the impor-
tance of ANCSA; and 
Whereas the people of the United States 
have reason to honor the tremendous edu-
cational, social, political, economic, and cul-
tural achievements of Alaska Native people 
over the past 50 years: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes December 18, 2021, as the 50th 
anniversary of the passage of the Alaska Na-
tive Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.) (referred to in this resolution as 
‘‘ANCSA’’); 
(2) commemorates the extensive achieve-
ments 
made 
by 
Alaska 
Native 
people 
through the implementation of ANCSA, 
while simultaneously maintaining their cul-
ture, traditions, and ways of life, during the 
50-year period preceding the date of adoption 
of this resolution; and 
(3) celebrates the successes of Alaska Na-
tive people during that 50-year period, with 
optimism for the next 50 years and beyond. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, 
I mentioned that I came to the floor to 
speak about a significant matter for 
Alaska. It is a significant milestone for 
my State. Just 2 days from now, on De-
cember 18, we will mark the 50th anni-
versary of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act being signed into law 
by President Nixon back in 1971. 
For those who are not familiar with 
Alaska’s history, ANCSA, as we call it, 
is one of the foundational laws for my 
State. It settled aboriginal land names. 
It chartered hundreds of Alaska Native 
corporations to own lands and to em-
power 
their 
Alaska 
Native 
share-
holders. 
Now, this structure is very unique. I 
think most of us think about a cor-
poration and you think about an IBM 
or a General Electric, but an Alaska 
Native corporation and the share-
holders who are part of them are very, 
very 
different 
from 
the 
corporate 
structure that most know. 
This approach that was arrived at 
with the Alaska Native Claims Settle-
ment Act was new. It was a clear, clear 
departure from the reservation model 
in the lower 48. It ushered in a new 
level of economic self-determination 
through private land ownership. 
Alaska Native leaders took a look at 
the 
reservation 
system 
that 
was 
throughout other parts of America, and 
in most of them—not all, but most of 
them—decided on another path, saying: 
That is not the route that we would 
take. 
They wanted to manage their lands, 
manage their resources on their own 
terms, and to have greater economic 
prosperity and independence. 
So in Alaska, we have 229 Tribes in 
the State, and, as someone who comes 
from a State where you do have many 
Tribes, I think it always gets people’s 
attention when I say we have about 40 
percent of the Tribes in the Nation 
that are located in Alaska. 
ANCSA established more than 200 vil-
lage corporations along with regional 
and urban corporations. And under this 
settlement, Congress transferred some 
44 million acres of land in Alaska to 
the private ownership of these newly 
created corporations. They also appro-
priated $962 million in compensation. 
So there was the transfer of ownership, 
as well as the conveyance of dollars. 
So as shareholders, the Alaska Na-
tive people would then be able to de-
cide for themselves how to use, how to 
protect, and how to guide development 
of their lands and their resources. As 
Marlene Johnson put it, ANCSA meant 
that Alaska Natives ‘‘were able to sur-
round and put their arms around the 
land that belonged to their forefathers 
and will belong to their grandkids,’’ 
and she said, ‘‘That is really impor-
tant.’’ It really is. 
Today 
the 
economic 
success 
of 
ANCSA is as self-evident as it is self- 
determined. ANCSA has positively im-
pacted not just Alaska Native people 
but Alaska as a whole. ANCs, as we call 
them, have become key economic driv-
ers, creating jobs and industry in Alas-
ka but also across the country and 
even around the globe. 
ANCs consistently rank as the top 10 
Alaska-owned businesses by gross rev-
enue, and many of the largest office 
buildings and employers in Anchorage 
and Fairbanks and Juneau are home to 
ANCs. 
They also provide important services 
for their people, like scholarships and 
cultural stewardship, often through 
their nonprofit foundations. Because of 
ANCSA, significant investments have 
been made in real estate, construction, 
tourism, workforce development, pro-
fessional services, and so much more. 
We have also seen the very clear ben-
efit of resource development. We see 
this up in the NANA region with the 
Red Dog Mine. We are hoping that can 
be replicated at prospects like Donlin 
Gold in the Calista region. Revenue 
sharing—very, 
very 
unique 
within 
ANCSA—revenue sharing with village 
corporations and leadership in the area 
of cultural resource protection—we see 
that down in the southeast region. 
These are just a few of the examples of 
where ANCSA really got it right. 
As we look back at ANCSA, we recog-
nize that there were many, many peo-
ple who helped to make it happen—not 
just President Nixon, as I mentioned, 
the congressional delegation, of course, 
but 
more 
importantly, 
the 
many 
strong Alaska Native leaders, like 
Emil Notti, Etok Edwardsen, and John 
Borbridge, among many, many others. 
We are fortunate that some of the 
key ANCSA advocates are still with us 
today, but, sadly, many of the vision-
ary leaders who were so instrumental 
in the negotiations have passed on, and 
there are far too many to mention 
here, but I will share the story of one 
of them. 
Don Wright, this individual right 
here, was born in Nenana back in 1929. 
He is shown here with Ted Stevens, 
over to the right. This is Don’s wife 
Carol, and this is the Senator from 
Vermont, Senator Stafford. 
Don was known for his charisma and 
his skill as a negotiator and a political 
leader. Many Alaska Natives at the 
time were just very, very personally in-
vested in this effort, and he was one 
who really led in this. He personally 
contributed to the advocacy effort, 
both in time and money. Don led that, 
along with others. 
He and others spent nights sleeping 
on the streets here in Washington, DC, 
or in the Halls of Congress. They 
maxed out credit cards to pay for the 
long trips all the way from Alaska to 
come here to DC to the Capitol. Don 
once paid the way for 20 Alaskans to 
travel with him to lobby for the legis-
lation. He was really all in. He fought 
tirelessly to secure Native land rights. 
He was president of the Alaska Fed-
eration of Natives when ANCSA actu-
ally became law. He was able to meet 
with President Nixon in 1971 to encour-
age passage of the bill and was truly a 
driving force behind the effort. 
He framed it well by saying that 
year: 
The President and the Congress must de-
cide whether this last chapter is to be writ-
ten in dignity or dishonor. 
I think, thanks to Don Wright and 
many other Native leaders, it was writ-
ten in dignity. 
I am really very, very humbled by all 
of the incredible people who helped

shape ANCSA, many of whom I am for-
tunate to know and to call my friends. 
It is a privilege to be able to honor and 
thank them here on the Senate floor 
for their fortitude, their determina-
tion, and their perseverance. 
I remain unwavering in my commit-
ment to help today’s leaders as we con-
tinue to improve ANCSA and ensure 
that the Federal Government upholds 
its promise to Alaska Native people. 
Now, we say around here all the time 
that there is no law that we have writ-
ten and passed that is perfect, and 
ANCSA is certainly no exception. It is 
really a living document, if you will, 
still changing, still evolving. There are 
gaps; we recognize that. There are 
shortcomings, and we still have unfin-
ished business, important issues that 
we have to resolve. One of these is re-
cent, unfortunately, and it does not in-
volve amending ANCSA, but, instead, 
it calls for flexibility for the unique 
corporations it created. 
After the COVID pandemic struck 
our country, those of us in Congress 
came together. We were seeking to pass 
the CARES Act to provide relief across 
the spectrum. As part of that—and I 
was really very pleased to be able to be 
part of that effort that was able to 
dedicate significant funding for Tribes 
and Tribal entities. It was $8 billion 
that was dedicated for Tribes, Tribal 
entities, including ANCs. 
But ANCs’ eligibility for that funding 
was quickly challenged despite the 
very clear intention here in Congress. 
The case ultimately went to the Su-
preme Court. It wasn’t decided until 
June 25 of this year, when they ulti-
mately prevailed. 
As a result of that litigation, ANCs 
received their allocations under that 
CARES funding, but they only recently 
received this. So they got the litiga-
tion through, and they received their 
allocation but very late. But now we 
have a new problem. The new problem 
is, that CARES Act money needs to be 
spent by December 31—a matter of a 
couple weeks. That is just not right. 
That is not fair here. It is clearly not 
long enough to be able to responsibly 
utilize these very important funds, and 
it is really not fair as a result of the 
litigation they faced. 
So the congressional delegation— 
Senator 
SULLIVAN, 
Congressman 
YOUNG, and I—is seeking to extend the 
deadline through the end of next year. 
We are basically saying: Look, fair is 
fair. ANCs should have the time that 
they need and that others had. 
While the Senate has agreed to pass a 
broader bill that includes this exten-
sion, it is stalled over on the House 
side and really has left us with no clear 
path forward, even at this very late 
hour. So that is something I am asking 
my colleagues and the administration 
for their support on in gaining this 
flexibility. 
Another top priority for me is some-
thing that was left out of ANCSA all 
those years ago. Five communities in 
Southeast Alaska were missing from 
its text and therefore unable to create 
what 
we 
call 
urban 
corporations. 
Today, this is a 50-year injustice for 
these five Alaska Native communities 
of Haines, Ketchikan, Wrangell, Peters-
burg, and Tenakee. I have had the 
privilege to live in Wrangell and to be 
born in Ketchikan, so these are com-
munities that are pretty close to my 
heart. 
The situation in terms of being left 
out was challenging enough. It is not 
made easier by their location in the 
Tongass National Forest. But I would 
remind the Senate that they and their 
ancestors lived in this area. They took 
care of these lands long before the Fed-
eral Government came along and made 
the designation of a national forest. 
That nearly all of their region has 
since been taken and classified as a 
Federal forest is no reason to refuse to 
acknowledge and work with us on this. 
So I have recently reintroduced legisla-
tion to allow those five southeast com-
munities to receive their rightful land 
entitlements under ANCSA. 
I would urge my colleagues, take a 
look at this. Recognize that this is a 
matter of the Federal Government 
making good on its promise to thou-
sands of Alaska Natives. I would ask 
that you would join me and Senator 
SULLIVAN and Congressman YOUNG as 
we work to advance this bill into law, 
as we, again, continue to address 
unfulfilled promises within ANCSA. 
A third matter is a provision in 
ANCSA that, quite honestly, is just 
outdated, no longer needed. 
Congress, in trying to do the right 
thing, required village corporations to 
take a portion of the lands they re-
ceived under ANCSA and give them to 
the State of Alaska to hold in trust for 
future community needs. 
Fast-forward some 50 years, and 
many of these lands are simply being 
held in trust now even though they are 
not needed for municipal purposes and 
quite likely will never be. It is just 
time to end that requirement and en-
able the village corporations to receive 
these lands back if they so choose. 
We also have to remember that this 
is a land settlement, but it is not fully 
implemented. Keep in mind—it has 
been 50 years now. It is a land settle-
ment that hasn’t been implemented 
fully after 50 years. A total of 5.5 mil-
lion acres are still under interim con-
veyance, and another 1.5 million acres 
remain unconveyed from the original 
entitlement. 
We have to provide the resources to 
the Department of the Interior to com-
plete this very important work. 
There are at least four more issues 
that we need to help resolve as well 
that I will mention. 
The first here on this list is really 
concerning to me, and it is actually 
really very devastating when you think 
about it. This is the matter of contami-
nated lands. This problem is not only 
not going away, it is getting worse. 
It really pains me to say, but signifi-
cant lands in Alaska, including for-
merly used defense sites, were con-
taminated. The Federal Government 
knew they were contaminated, but 
they were still conveyed to the ANCs 
as contaminated lands, and the govern-
ment is saying: OK. This is part of your 
land settlement. We are going to give 
you these lands, but you can’t use 
these lands because they are contami-
nated. 
There are horrible consequences that 
we are seeing to this. We have clusters 
of illnesses, cancer. I just had a report 
that was presented to the Alaska Fed-
eration of Natives Convention just this 
past week. This is causing real suf-
fering, true consequences, death in 
these communities. 
It is no fault of the people who live 
there and received these lands in set-
tlement from the Federal Government. 
It is a Federal responsibility for us to 
take care of this, so we have a plan we 
have—we have a plan in the sense that 
we have identified where these con-
taminated lands are, but what we need 
is a comprehensive plan in terms of the 
action, what we are actually going to 
do to clean up the land and make it 
right and make it right as soon as pos-
sible. 
Another issue that we need to resolve 
is the issue of ‘‘afterborns.’’ 
The day that ANCSA became law, 
December 18, 1971, was kind of an arbi-
trary deadline, if you will, for Alaska 
Native people to be included in its ben-
efits. So if a Native person was alive on 
the date of enactment, December 18, 
1971, they were included as an eligible 
shareholder in the ANCSA corporation 
that aligned with their traditional 
Tribal homelands. But if a Native per-
son, even from the same family—same 
area, same family—if they were born 
after December 18, 1971, they were not 
included, and they did not receive 
shares in any Native corporation. So 
what you had, you created two distinct 
classes of Native people. You had origi-
nal shareholders and nonshareholder 
descendants—they 
call 
them 
afterborns—who were effectively disen-
franchised from the benefits that Con-
gress intended for them. 
There was a past amendment to 
ANCSA that dealt directly with this 
issue but didn’t sufficiently solve this 
problem. This was an effort that we ad-
vanced several years ago, a decade or 
so. Congress has allowed ANCSA cor-
porations to open enrollment to de-
scendants through an affirmative vote 
of their current shareholders. As a re-
sult, what we have seen is that about 5 
regional corporations have opened en-
rollment, and about 5 of the more than 
200 village corporations have done the 
same. Unfortunately, so many of these 
small village corporations that want to 
open enrollment simply can’t afford 
this process. It is a relatively com-
plicated process. 
This is a problem that we are prob-
ably going to have to address legisla-
tively—not by directing Alaska Na-
tives on what to do but by providing 
some support and resources so that

they can make that choice at their dis-
cretion. 
One of the more significant promises 
made to Alaska Native people dealt 
with the issue of subsistence. 
In Alaska, subsistence is hunting, it 
is fishing, and it is gathering. It is in-
extricably tied to Native culture. It is 
food security for places where grocery 
stores simply don’t exist, or if they do 
exist, the food is so expensive that the 
average family can’t afford it. So this 
is, again, something where we need to 
find fair solutions for Alaska Native 
subsistence rights. 
The last issue I will bring up today is 
something too significant not to ac-
knowledge. ANCSA was meant to be a 
fair and just settlement, accomplished 
rapidly, with certainty and in con-
formity with the real economic and so-
cial needs of Native people without 
litigation. Congress wrote that into 
ANCSA itself. Yet, in reality, ANCSA 
severed Alaska Tribes from the Tribal 
land base. 
While many Alaska Native people are 
owners in Native corporations that 
manage Native traditional homelands, 
Alaska Tribal governments were not a 
consideration 
in 
the 
law. 
Alaska 
Tribes, 
whose 
collective 
aboriginal 
land rights led to the creation of 
ANCSA, were left without a viable re-
source stream to effectively govern. 
They, too, need tools and resources to 
create opportunities, and that is also 
an issue that we must consider in going 
forward. 
But all of this—all of this—requires 
education and understanding. That is 
going to be key, and that has been, un-
fortunately, 
lacking—severely 
lack-
ing—as we have seen, repeatedly, mis-
guided attacks from Members here in 
Congress against ANCSA and its cor-
porations. I will tell you, it is hard to 
express how frustrating that is, how in-
furiating these attacks truly are. But 
one additional benefit of this 50th anni-
versary is the opportunity that it pro-
vides us to help Congress, to help the 
administration, to help, really, the 
American public understand ANCSA 
and the promises that were made with-
in that settlement act. 
Alaska Pacific University and the 
Wilson Center’s Polar Institute have 
held a series of events that are free for 
anyone who wants to learn and under-
stand more about ANCSA. The Ted 
Stevens Foundation is developing a 
documentary on this. Indian Country 
Today, First Alaskans magazine, Alas-
ka Public Media, and the Anchorage 
Daily News, among others, have all 
published long-form articles, exploring 
ANCSA’s history, its meaning, its im-
pacts, and its future. So I would en-
courage folks to take a look at that. 
I think it is also important to re-
member that, while ANCSA’s passage 
ushered in a period of self-determina-
tion and self-governance for Alaska Na-
tive communities, it provided opportu-
nities for these communities to really 
look to the future. In short, ANCSA 
was designed to address the past by 
looking to the future. 
At the annual meeting of the Alaska 
Federation of Natives, which, I men-
tioned, just took place earlier this 
week, I reflected and recognized the 
generation of Alaska Native leaders 
who fought for the passage of ANCSA. 
It was their efforts that helped pave 
the way for the many Alaska Native 
youth who may be watching back in 
Alaska, across the country, and maybe 
even around the world. I want them to 
know about the work that was done to 
pass this historic law and how it is ap-
preciated. As I reflect here today on 
the passage of this important law, I am 
hopeful about what ANCSA will rep-
resent for our Alaska Native youth in 
the future. 
My colleague Senator SULLIVAN and I 
have introduced a resolution to ensure 
that the U.S. Senate recognizes the 
50th anniversary of ANCSA. Our reso-
lution acknowledges the incredible ac-
complishments that Alaska Native peo-
ple have made through their ANCs over 
these past 50 years. There are many 
successes to acknowledge and to cele-
brate, but in its text, we also reflect on 
the work that is left ahead and the 
promises left unfilled—the promises 
the Federal Government has made to 
Alaska Native people that must be 
honored. 
So I thank Senator SULLIVAN
for 
standing with me to submit this impor-
tant resolution, which acknowledges 
the tenacity of the Alaska Native peo-
ple and the success of ANCs over the 
past 50 years. I know that the dean of 
the House, Congressman YOUNG, joins 
with us in acknowledging this golden 
anniversary. 
I would certainly encourage all of 
those who have had an opportunity to 
hear my comments—I know my col-
league Senator SULLIVAN is going to 
speak later as well—to just take a bit 
of time to better understand this 
foundational law for Alaska Natives’ 
self-determination. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, today 
I introduced a resolution with Senator 
MURKOWSKI celebrating the 50th anni-
versary of the Alaska Native Claims 
Settlement Act—ANCSA, as we call it 
back home in Alaska—which was an 
enormously consequential piece of leg-
islation that, after years and years of 
debate right in this body, passed the 
House, then passed the U.S. Senate, 
and then was signed into law by Presi-
dent Nixon on December 18, 1971, al-
most exactly 50 years ago to this day. 
It was a great day for Alaska. 
I know Senator MURKOWSKI was on 
the floor earlier talking about ANCSA 
and why it is so important and why in 
Alaska, right now, we have been cele-
brating 50 years of this important piece 
of legislation. 
I want to go back in time a little bit 
to help explain, because part of what 
Senator MURKOWSKI and I do here is we 
are constantly talking about and edu-
cating our colleagues about this very 
unique legislation, which happened 
right here in the U.S. Senate. 
If you go back in time to 1867, that is 
when the United States purchased 
Alaska from Russia. Within the agree-
ment, there was acknowledgement of 
the Alaska Native people and their 
lands, but, still, almost 100 years after 
the purchase from Russia, even fol-
lowing 
statehood 
for 
Alaska, 
the 
claims settlement that the Native peo-
ple had to their own lands was still in 
limbo. 
It got a kick and a turbo charge 
when oil was discovered on Alaska’s 
North Slope during a worldwide short-
age, which created new urgency to de-
velop Alaska for our resources but to 
do so by settling these land claims. 
There were allies in the Federal Gov-
ernment who were helpful, but it was 
truly the Alaska Native people and 
their determination to themselves and 
to future generations and their resil-
iency and brilliance which led to the 
passage of ANCSA 50 years ago, which 
became the largest and, certainly, 
most innovative indigenous land set-
tlement, certainly, in U.S. history, and 
it is no exaggeration to say probably in 
the world—44 million acres of land 
going to the Native people of my State. 
It brought tremendous educational, 
social, political, economic, and cul-
tural achievements for the Alaska Na-
tive people. It certainly wasn’t perfect, 
but this body played a very important 
role. 
Now, there were obstacles, chal-
lenges. In fact, when you look back on 
the history over 50 years ago, it was 
kind of a classic David-and-Goliath 
story. 
Let me spend a few minutes going 
back in time to set the stage for what 
was happening in Alaska. 
In 1954, the U.S. Department of the 
Interior did a health survey on the Na-
tive people of Alaska. Here is a quote 
from that survey: ‘‘The indigenous peo-
ple of Native Alaska are the victims of 
sickness, crippling conditions and pre-
mature death to a degree exceeded in 
very few parts of the world. . . . health 
problems are nearly out of hand. If . . . 
Americans could see for themselves the 
large numbers of the tuberculosis, the 
cripple, the blind . . . the malnour-
ished, the desperately ill among [this] 
relatively small [Native] population,’’ 
it would have a profound impact on 
them. And it did. 
Even in the face of these crippling 
conditions, the Alaska Native people 
joined hands, joined hearts and said: 
This is our land. We need rights to it. 
They did this by coming together. In 
the mid-1960s, they formed the Alaska 
Federation of Natives—AFN, as we call 
it back home—an entity that is very 
important to our communities. 
Of course, the Native people in our 
State looked for potential allies. In the 
lower 48, they gave speeches. They 
wrote columns. They formed their own 
newspaper, The Tundra Times, edited 
by legendary Howard Rock, which was 
highly read throughout the State, cele-
brated throughout the globe, and had 
an enormous impact on bringing people 
together. 
A few years ago, my team and I 
combed through some of the hearings

December 16, 2021 
that led to ANCSA. It was many years 
in development. There were field hear-
ings that took place in Alaska in 1968, 
1969—3 years before the passage of 
ANCSA. 
Incredibly proud and determined first 
peoples from all over the State— 
Tlingit, Haida, Athabascan, Inupiat, 
Yupik, Aleut—travel to Anchorage, to 
Fairbanks to give their testimony in 
field hearings to U.S. Senators. Some 
of them had never even left their vil-
lages. Some of them didn’t even speak 
English. 
Many were veterans—and I am going 
to talk briefly about that. Dozens and 
dozens of young men and women, old 
men and women, all of them testifying 
before U.S. Senators and Congressmen, 
telling their stories of how they lived 
off the land and the rights that they 
needed for thousands of years on the 
land. 
They told stories of strong and resil-
ient people who had been able to thrive 
in some of the harshest conditions in 
the planet. But as I mentioned earlier, 
they also told stories of health chal-
lenges. 
The first AFN president, Emil Notti, 
who is still a great leader in Alaska, 
then only 36 years old, spoke with pas-
sion at these hearings and heartbreak 
about the conditions in rural Alaska. 
He said to a group of Senators in a 
hearing: 
The indigenous people of Native Alaska are 
the victims of sickness, crippling conditions 
and premature death to a degree exceeded in 
very few parts of the world. 
He told the committee then that life 
expectancy for the average Native 
Alaskan was 34 years old. This is in the 
late 1960s. The average life expectancy 
in the United States at that time was 
69—34 years old to 69. 
Many spoke of how much they had 
sacrificed for their country. And this is 
an issue I never tire of talking about. 
Alaska Natives serve at higher rates in 
the U.S. military than any other eth-
nic group in the country. So they are 
fighting for their country in World War 
II and Korea and Vietnam, and they 
are coming home and they are being 
denied fundamental rights themselves. 
Here is what Jerome Trigg, a leader 
and a marine from Nome, had to tell 
U.S. Senators who were in Alaska. His 
testimony was said to have brought 
tears to the eyes of many. He looked at 
the U.S. Senators and said this: We 
have showed our patriotism as proudly 
as any Americans on Earth. We have 
answered the call of duty with pride in 
serving in our military. In World War 
II, we answered the call 100 percent. 
Every man—old and young—in every 
village volunteered with the Alaska 
National Guard. 
On Vietnam, which was raging at the 
time, he said: I have never heard of an 
Alaska Native burning their draft card 
or our Nation’s flag. We love our land, 
and we will sacrifice and fight to pro-
tect it. 
He concluded with this thought, 
which I love: ‘‘Sometimes I think the 
wrong people are running this hearing 
and taking our testimony,’’ he said to 
the Senators. ‘‘It seems that [maybe] 
we should be on the bench and you peo-
ple should be . . . giving [us] the testi-
mony.’’ 
I love that—strong words from Ma-
rine Jerome Trigg, who had a very im-
portant point to make. 
So many in our communities testi-
fied in front of Congress. One happened 
to be a beautiful, young Alaska Native 
woman in her thirties from the village 
of Rampart named Mary Jane Fate, 
who not only worked on this but came 
to Washington, DC, to lobby U.S. Sen-
ators to pass ANCSA. I had the very 
great privilege of being the son-in-law 
of that great Native woman who, un-
fortunately, 
passed 
away 
recently. 
That was my mother-in-law, Mary 
Jane Fate, who came to this body and 
made sure Senators understood what 
was happening in Alaska and got them 
to vote for ANCSA 50 years ago. 
So here is what it did in a nutshell. 
As I mentioned, it was the largest in-
digenous land settlement in the history 
of the country: 44 million acres of land, 
almost a billion dollars from the State 
and Federal Government to transfer 
land in fee simple—not the reservation 
system like you have in the lower 48, 
which was a huge innovation at the 
time. They own this land. It is theirs. 
It is not held in trust by the United 
States like it is in the lower 48 on In-
dian reservations. 
Congress mandated the creation of 
for-profit Alaska Native corporations 
solely owned by Alaska Native share-
holders. Twelve of these regional cor-
porations and 200 village ANCs were 
created by the Congress. Sometimes 
people talk about ANCs as if they were 
some foreign entity. They were actu-
ally created right here 50 years ago. 
What did all of this do? It provided 
economic opportunity. These were not 
typical entities, but they were more 
than just corporations. They were kind 
of a combination: social, cultural, eco-
nomic. They passed on the values to 
the different shareholders. 
One of the great things about ANCSA 
was that it required, actually, the 
sharing of revenues. Some of these re-
gional corporations did very well; oth-
ers didn’t. There were provisions early 
on that said, if these corporations are 
doing great and these aren’t, there is 
going to be some sharing. It was called 
the 7(i) provision. These provisions 
have been critical to the survival of 
ANCs, which regional ANCs at times, 
as I mentioned, were receiving more 
revenue than others. 
So that day 50 years ago—December 
18, 1971—was really an important day 
for our State. How has it worked out? 
It has worked out well, but, of course, 
we always have more work to do. 
Over the last 50 years, the Alaska Na-
tive people have managed their lands 
to foster sustainable businesses, cre-
ated employment opportunities for all 
people—Native 
and 
non-Native—in 
Alaska, across the country, and across 
the globe. They have become the heart 
and soul of our economy in Alaska, em-
ploying thousands of both Alaska Na-
tive and non-Native people. 
And they have prospered with their 
own initiative and with innovative ap-
proaches to fostering economic devel-
opment 
through 
self-determination. 
And beyond the economic benefits, 
these ANCs, these groupings, these 
shareholders in these Alaska Native 
entities created right here on this 
floor, provided benefits in terms of cul-
ture, language revitalization, scholar-
ships, burials, funeral assistance, and 
an enormous focus on education. Over 
54,000 
individual 
scholarships 
were 
given to younger Alaska Native people. 
And, importantly, this law, passed by 
this body, gave the Native people the 
opportunity to thrive; to continue to 
live on their land, practice their cul-
ture, create leaders throughout the 
State. In what was once one of the 
most impoverished places in the coun-
try are now, in many areas, strong, dy-
namic—health, 
education, 
housing, 
food security, and sanitation have all 
improved immensely. 
We have a long way to go. There is 
still a lot of misunderstanding. In Alas-
ka, you have Tribes, Tribal members, 
you have ANCs, and shareholders. 
These are the Native people. You have 
crossover. And sometimes there is a 
misunderstanding. 
For example, the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act specifically ex-
cluded tens of thousands of Alaska Na-
tives because they were members of an 
organization that Congress created. My 
own view was that was outrageous. 
So that is why we need to keep edu-
cating our colleagues here. But overall, 
this was a story of success, of resil-
ience, of what can happen when you 
allow people to take charge of their 
own destiny. It is a story of self-deter-
mination and, in many ways, heroism, 
and it is a story for the ages. 
I am honored to represent these peo-
ple, wonderful people—many of whom 
the leaders are still alive who made 
this happen 50 years ago—and their 
children and grandchildren. We have 
more work to do, but 50 years ago, on 
December 18, 1971, it was the start of a 
new, positive, innovative chapter in 
the history of Alaska. And that is why 
Senator MURKOWSKI and I wanted to 
celebrate this very important mile-
stone this afternoon.

TRIBUTE TO SHARI DAUGHERTY 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, it is 
Thursday. The Senate is still very busy 
here. We have a lot of work to do, as we 
are all trying to get home for the holi-
days. And I thought it was still the ap-
propriate time to come down and talk 
about somebody who is making our 
State such a great State, somebody 
who is contributing to the community, 
somebody who I refer to as our Alaskan 
of the Week. 
Now, we have been doing this for, 
gosh, going on almost 6 years, maybe 5 
years. But it is always one of my favor-
ite times of week, even when the 
speech is late. So I appreciate the ma-
jority leader and the Presiding Officer 
letting us stay open here for one more 
speech. And I know the pages—I mean, 
they love the Alaskan of the Week. So 
this is a little bit of a treat. 
But I always start this speech with a 
little bit of an update on what is going 
on in Alaska. So right now, Utqiagvik, 
formerly known as Barrow—that is 
Point Barrow. That is the northern 
most community in North America. 
They haven’t seen the sun in nearly a 
month. The sun went down, and it is 
not rising again until January 23. So 
they get a lot of darkness. There are 66 
days of darkness. Great people up 
there. Wonderful people up there. I love 
it up there. 
We have had some pretty significant 
cold spells already. That, for now, 
doesn’t seem to be lifting. It was 40 
below 0 in Fairbanks yesterday. In An-
chorage, the high was 4 degrees above 
0. Forty below is chilly. Tough people 
throughout the State. Four degrees 
above is pretty cold for Anchorage. 
But everybody is excited because 
Christmas is right around the corner, 
and it is, of course, a great time to be 
in Alaska. We do have a place—I was 
just talking with the Presiding Officer 
and the majority leader. We have a 
great community in Interior Alaska 
called North Pole, AK. Santa actually 
lives there. We have a city council 
member in North Pole named Santa 
Claus, and a reindeer there. 
And, of course, I am like everybody 
else here, looking forward to getting 
home, going to Midnight Mass, eating 
my special Alaska seafood Newburg, 
having friends over, and family, of 
course. And I think we all know we are 
very fortunate. I, certainly, believe I 
am a very blessed man. 
And we are blessed in Alaska because 
of people like Shari Daugherty, who is 
our Alaskan of the Week. And so I 
want to talk a little bit about Shari be-
cause what she has done is literally the 
definition of the Christmas spirit. 
For the last month, as she has done 
for the last 30 years, she has been 
working pretty much around the clock, 
volunteering her time for the nonprofit 
Share the Spirit. Share the Spirit— 
that is the nonprofit that Shari helped 
found in 1992—30 years. 
Share the Spirit’s mission is to make 
sure that hundreds of less fortunate 
families in Homer, AK, her hometown, 
get all of the ingredients for a proper 
Christmas dinner and presents for the 
kids. 
Share the Spirit—it sounds pretty 
simple, but, as you can imagine, this is 
no easy task. And Shari would tell you 
that it involves so many others in 
Homer to make sure that the children 
in the community, who might not oth-
erwise have anything under the tree, 
can experience the magic of Christmas 
that every child deserves. 
So who is Shari, this great volunteer 
who has been doing incredible work in 
Homer? Originally from Chico, CA, 
Shari and her parents moved to Homer 
when she was in the 10th grade. Her fa-
ther was a fisherman. 
And for those of you who have been 
to Homer or want to come to Homer, I 
will tell you, it is one of the most stun-
ningly beautiful places in all of Amer-
ica—really, in all of the world. It is 
known as the ‘‘Halibut Fishing Capital 
of the World.’’ But anyone who goes 
there falls in love with Homer. It is 
surrounded by the glistening waters of 
Kachemak Bay, jagged mountains, gla-
ciers, snowcapped volcanoes, and a 
great tight-knit community. 
After college at the University of 
Alaska in Fairbanks, Shari moved 
around a little. But in 1991, she came 
back home with her daughter. She did 
so because she had family there in 
Homer. And even if she didn’t, as she 
put it, she had a whole town full of 
family in Homer. 
Now, volunteering was in her blood. 
She said her mom stressed the impor-
tance of giving back to the community 
since she was a young girl. So she al-
most immediately joined the Emblem 
Club. That is the unofficial auxiliary of 
the Elks. And during one of their first 
meetings, it was announced that a 
Christian minister’s group that every 
year provided food and presents for 
people in the community was actually 
going to disband. 
A meeting was called. The talking 
lasted for a very long time—at such 
volunteer meetings, that can happen, 
of course—until Shari finally cut in 
and said: Hey, guys, we are really burn-
ing daylight here. Here is what needs 
to happen: We need to form a com-
mittee, form a plan, form a nonprofit, 
and get busy—get busy. 
And as such things go, she and an-
other woman, Norma Foust, were put 
in charge. And boy, did they make a 
difference. That year, with Christmas 
only weeks away, a nonprofit was 
formed and a fundraiser to organize 
with the help of a strong community. 
They put together 57 baskets of food: 
turkey, stuffing, potato, sugar, salt, 
eggs, celery, pie crusts, cards with rec-
ipes on them—all the fixings for a nice

Christmas dinner. And then there were 
the presents for more than 100 children. 
There were 220 gifts that first year, 30 
years ago. 
And the program has grown ever 
since. Hundreds of families each year 
are referred to Shari’s program by so-
cial agencies, including food banks and 
anywhere people go for help. The infor-
mation is passed on to Shari and the 
whole Share the Spirit team. Each 
family is identified by their needs: a 
family of three, say, with a 4-year-old 
girl who needs boots and would like a 
princess costume. They are then as-
signed a number that goes onto a 
Christmas decoration and put on one of 
the numerous trees posted by local 
businesses in Homer. Homer residents 
pick up a decoration and buy the pre-
sents. It is pretty well organized. 
And Shari and the volunteers then 
get busy organizing a huge spaghetti 
feed to raise the funds, and then they 
go shopping for the food. 
A few days before Christmas, the 
group stages the location, normally at 
the high school. The presents and the 
food baskets are then disbursed. 
As I mentioned, Shari has done this 
for 30 years—30 years—and throughout 
the years, many stories and people 
stand out. 
This is Alaska. So, of course, this 
was the year of the huge blizzard. No-
body could drive. So they enlisted a 
club of snow machine riders to deliver 
the presents and the food throughout 
the area. 
There is the woman who now lives in 
Pennsylvania, who lived in Homer for a 
while, with a young child. That child, 
because of the group, was able to expe-
rience Christmas. And now, like clock-
work, this woman sends a quarterly do-
nation to Share the Spirit. 
You see how the spirit is literally 
being shared all over the country: Alas-
ka, Homer, Pennsylvania. 
There are many people now adults, 
some with children of their own, who 
got help, who got presents because of 
Share the Spirit and are now regular 
volunteers. Shari knows of many peo-
ple who got presents as children be-
cause of her group’s efforts and decided 
to stay in Homer, have families of their 
own, and now help out at Share the 
Spirit. She said: They decided that this 
is where they were going to live. This 
is the town they are going to live in 
and to contribute to, because this is 
the place that took care of them when 
they were young and needed it. 
Shari is retiring this year from both 
the program and from her job as a med-
ical biller at South Peninsula Hospital. 
She will be leaving Share the Spirit in 
good hands, though: Kelly Glidden, who 
began volunteering as a sixth grader in 
1993; John Adams, who started when he 
was 8 years old volunteering; and 
Emmy Olsem Drye, who has been in-
volved in Share the Spirit since she 
was 3, and who is also Shari’s daughter. 
They will take on the mantle of this 
great volunteer effort, focused on the 
Christmas spirit, that Shari started. 
And there are those who have been 
there since the beginning: DeeDee 
Shoultz and Fran Van Sandt. 
And then there is the great commu-
nity of Homer—a community that 
takes care of its own. 
So thank you, Shari, for all you have 
done throughout the years—three dec-
ades to keep the Christmas spirit alive. 
Thank you for making our State a 
much better place, a more generous 
place, a caring place for all, and touch-
ing the lives of so many, and especially 
for making sure that children in Homer 
and across Alaska—and really across 
America—experience the joy and the 
magic of Christmas. Congratulations, 
Shari, on being our Alaskan of the 
Week, and Merry Christmas. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING MEREDITH SMITH 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
and pay tribute to Meredith Isaac Smith, 76, 
who passed on Friday, November 26, 2021. 
He was born on July 28, 1942, in Cleveland, 
son of Osceola Smith and Consuela Evans. 
Meredith was a 1960 graduate of Sollers Point 
Junior/Senior High School in Maryland and a 
1964 alum of the University of Maryland East-
ern Shore, a historically black university, 
where he earned a bachelor’s degree in kine-
siology. 
Upon graduating, Meredith would return to 
academia, teaching physical education at 
Southern High School for 40 years. He would 
become the boys’ basketball coach, holding 
the position for 21 years and finishing with a 
398–144 record. Although he never personally 
played any sport in both high school and col-
lege, Meredith’s passion for coaching would 
lead him to win a Maryland Scholastic Asso-
ciation A Conference title in 1990 and three 
Maryland Public Secondary Athletic Associa-
tion state titles in 1993, 1994, and 1996. His 
success would lead him back to his alma 
mater, the University of Maryland Eastern 
Shore, in 2004, serving as an assistant coach 
for three seasons before becoming the pro-
gram’s interim head coach during the 2007– 
2008 season. 
While helping his athletes achieve athletic 
greatness, Meredith’s compassion also in-
cluded being a mentor to the youth. When he 
knew that coaching high school basketball 
was his calling, Coach Meredith gave his all to 
his athletes, treating them like his own chil-
dren. While a coach at Southern, Meredith de-
manded academic excellence from his ath-
letes and wanted his students to continue their 
education past high school. Several of his re-
markable players were able to continue their 
careers in college, which was one of his major 
priorities. 
Meredith is survived by his children Ali 
Smith, Darryl Smith, Atman Smith, Lydia Jack-
son, and Lisa Robinson; two brothers, James 
Smith, and Carlton Smith; two sisters, Mary 
Livingston, and Alexis Smith; 12 grand-
children; and nine great-grandchildren.

IN RECOGNITION OF COMMANDER 
DON LIND 
HON. BLAKE D. MOORE 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to recognize Mr. Don Lind of Utah; 
a proud Naval Aviator, esteemed scientist, and 
veteran astronaut who has contributed signifi-
cantly to our nation’s exploration of space. 
After serving a church mission to the North-
eastern United States and graduating from the 
University of Utah, Mr. Lind went on to pursue 
a Ph.D. in High-Energy Nuclear Physics from 
the University of California, Berkeley in 1964. 
During this time, he held the rank of Com-
mander in the Naval Reserve as an aviator 
and logged more than 4,500 flight hours. 
Don began working at NASA in 1964 during 
a time of intense competition when America’s 
dominance in space was still in question. He 
quickly set himself apart and was selected into 
NASA Astronaut Group 5 just two years later. 
Commander Lind’s proficiency in developing 
tools for use on the lunar surface, studying the 
properties of low-energy particles in interplan-
etary space, and developing payloads for early 
space missions made him an invaluable mem-
ber of the group. 
In 1985, Commander Lind became the final 
member of the ‘‘Original Nineteen’’ to go to 
space when he served as Mission Specialist 1 
on STS–51–B. This important mission was in-
strumental in capturing images of the Earth’s 
aurora and deploying the Northern Utah Sat-
ellite, which was designed to measure an-
tenna patterns of L-band radars. The program 
faced immense adversity, yet Don’s deter-
mination ensured its success. 
Following his time with NASA, Commander 
Lind returned to his home state of Utah and 
moved to Cache Valley, where he inspired 
countless students as a professor at Utah 
State University. 
Back home, Don continues to serve others 
by magnifying church callings and loving his 
seven 
children 
and 
many 
grandchildren. 
Today, Commander Lind, now 91, resides in 
Smithfield, Utah and remains an icon of Utah’s 
many contributions to space exploration. 
I join with Americans across our nation in 
thanking Commander Lind for his dedication to 
our community, to our greatest ideals, and to 
the state of Utah. The sacrifices of men and 
women like Don Lind have buoyed our collec-
tive 
conscience, 
encouraged 
our 
nation 
through times of great uncertainty, and lifted 
our eyes and minds to the endless possibilities 
that surround us.

THANKING THE HOUSE OFFICE OF 
THE LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL 
HON. BENNIE G. THOMPSON 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I join with my fellow committee 
chairs in thanking the House Office of the Leg-
islative Counsel for their incredible work during 
the First Session of the 117th Congress. They 
have produced landmark legislation amid 
some of the most challenging working condi-
tions Congress has ever known. 
In just the First Session of the 117th Con-
gress, attorneys within the House Office of the 
Legislative Counsel have provided steadfast 
guidance on not just the ‘‘American Rescue 
Plan Act,’’ the ‘‘For the People Act,’’ the ‘‘Build 
Back Better Act,’’ or the ‘‘National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022,’’ but 
also more than 7,000 measures introduced in 
the House. 
My fellow committee chairs and I have 
joined in a letter thanking the office, led by 
Wade Ballou, which I include in the RECORD 
along with a roster of the entire HOLC staff. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, December 16, 2021. 
E. WADE BALLOU, Jr., 
House Legislative Counsel, Office of the Legisla-
tive Counsel, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. BALLOU: The committee chairs 
of the House of Representatives would like 
to express our profound thanks to you and 
the entire staff of the House Office of the 
Legislative Counsel (HOLC) for your extraor-
dinary work during the First Session of the 
117th Congress. 
Since its authorization more than a cen-
tury ago, HOLC has offered professional, 
nonpartisan, and confidential advice on 
drafting legislation to all Members and com-
mittees of the House. Few Congresses in that 
time have been as legislatively active and 
demanding as the 117th. Amid a pandemic, 
your talented and patriotic non-partisan 
staff has helped our committees and all 
Member offices draft more than 7,000 pieces 
of legislation. The body of work produced by 
HOLC includes some of the most broadly sig-
nificant and transformational measures our 
Nation has ever seen, which include the 
‘‘American Rescue Plan Act,’’ the ‘‘For the 
People Act,’’ the ‘‘Build Back Better Act,’’ 
and the ‘‘National Defense Authorization 
Act for Fiscal Year 2022,’’ as well as addi-
tional measures that were significant prior-
ities for each of our committees. 
What follows are committee-specific state-
ments of appreciation of your counsels’ ex-
pert work, which together with the names of 
the HOLC attorneys and staff whose work we 
acknowledge here, will be included in the 
Congressional Record: 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE 
The Committee on Agriculture would like 
to thank the non-partisan staff at the House 
Office of the Legislative Counsel for their ex-
traordinary work supporting our commit-
tee’s legislative priorities. We are grateful 
for the invaluable legal and legislative draft-
ing expertise of HOLC’s agriculture and nu-
trition attorneys: Michelle Vanek, Kathryn 
Swiss, James Grossman, Kakuti Lin, and 
Jean 
Harmann. 
Their 
expertise, 
profes-
sionalism, and tireless commitment to pub-
lic service has been key to our committee’s 
work, including the agriculture components 
of the American Rescue Plan Act and the 
Build Back Better Act, as well as the 10 bi-
partisan measures that this committee fa-
vorably reported or successfully advanced to 
the House floor this session of Congress. 
These efforts could not have been accom-
plished without HOLC and its dedicated non-
partisan staff. 
DAVID SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture. 
COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS 
On behalf of the Committee on Appropria-
tions, I would like to recognize and express

the Legislative Counsel. We thank the Of-
fice’s attorneys and staff for their dedication 
to public service, for their professionalism 
and expertise, and for their indispensable 
contributions and service to the House of 
Representatives. We are especially grateful 
for the assistance of Wade Ballou, Noah 
Wofsy, Tom Cassidy, Kalyani Parthasarathy, 
and Donalene Roberts and the Office of the 
Legislative Counsel team for providing the 
support necessary for the Committee to craft 
appropriations bills. 
ROSA L. DELAURO, 
Chair, Committee on Appropriations. 
COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES 
The Committee on Armed Services is very 
grateful for the tremendous contributions of 
the House Office of the Legislative Counsel 
to the committee’s legislative efforts, espe-
cially the HOLC’s prodigious contributions 
to the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2022. The committee com-
mends Hadley Ross, Tony Sciascia, Thomas 
Anderson, Tom Cassidy, Ken Cox, Mathew 
Eckstein, Brendan Gallagher, Brenna Marie 
Gautam, 
Greg 
Kostka, 
Keith 
Nemeth, 
Kalyani Parthasarathy, Veena Srinivasa, 
and Mark Synnes of the HOLC’s amazing de-
fense group and Karen Anderson, Marshall 
Barksdale, Hallet Brazelton, Jordyn Coad, 
Lisa Daly, Michael Sribinder, Billy Wilson, 
Noah Wofsy, and everyone on the indispen-
sable HOLC team for sharing their critical 
expertise and their extraordinary devotion 
to public service with the committee. 
ADAM SMITH, 
Chair, Committee on Armed Services. 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET 
The Committee on the Budget is extremely 
grateful for the entire hardworking, non-par-
tisan staff of the HOLC that worked on the 
American Rescue Plan Act as well as the 
Build Back Better Act. Budget Reconcili-
ation is, necessarily, a multicommittee and 
a multi-counsel effort, and our committee 
appreciates the complexity of this task and 
all of your staffs contributions. This effort 
was ably led by the talented, hardworking, 
and relentlessly cheerful team of Tom Cas-
sidy and Parker Johnson. Their work over 
weekends, early mornings, and late at night 
was invaluable. 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chair, Committee on the Budget. 
SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS 
The House Select Committee on the Cli-
mate Crisis greatly appreciates the invalu-
able guidance and advice provided by the 
House Office of the Legislative Counsel 
(HOLC). One constant in climate forward leg-
islation across jurisdictions, is the thorough, 
professional and essential work of the HOLC. 
While we are not a traditional legislative 
committee, our role in helping the House and 
the standing committees tackle the climate 
crisis head-on requires innovative, cross-cut-
ting policy that is not always easily trans-
lated into legislative text. HOLC’s drafting 
the bills passed by the House this Congress 
has already led, and will continue to lead, to 
immeasurable improvements to the lives of 
so many across this country, especially as it 
relates to the climate crisis. We extend our 
gratitude to the entire HOLC staff and wish 
you a restful holiday season. 
KATHY CASTOR, 
Chair, Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. 
COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION AND LABOR 
The House Office of the Legislative Coun-
sel (HOLC) has been invaluable to the work 
of the Education and Labor Committee this 
year. Thanks to the dedication and patience 
of HOLC’s expert staff, the Committee was 
able to include historic relief for students, 
workers, and families through both the 
American Rescue Plan and the Build Back 
Better Act. Additionally, HOLC provided 
round-the-clock support throughout the year 
to ensure the Committee advanced key legis-
lative priorities for the American people, in-
cluding legislation to strengthen workers’ 
collective bargaining rights, prevent child 
abuse and neglect, and address workplace 
discrimination. The Committee would like 
to give special thanks to Wade Ballou, Anna 
Shpak, Justin Gross, Brenna Culliton, Susan 
Fleishman, 
Brendan 
Gallagher, 
Karl 
Hagnauer, Jean Harmann, Paul Kubicki, 
Molly Lothamer, Donalene Roberts, Adam 
Schilt, Jessica Shapiro, Kathryn Swiss, and 
Adrienne Thomas. 
ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Education 
and Labor. 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE 
The nonpartisan Office of the Legislative 
Counsel has played a critical role in the 
work of the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce this year, including efforts to address 
the COVID–19 pandemic, make prescription 
drugs more affordable, invest in efforts to 
modernize the nation’s infrastructure, and 
combat the climate crisis. Such work re-
quired your staff to dedicate many late 
nights, early mornings, and weekends. While 
that work took place out of the public 
view’s, your superb drafting and technical 
expertise was vital to the passage of legisla-
tion that responds to the needs of the Amer-
ican people. For that, the Committee is ex-
tremely grateful. In particular, I would like 
to thank those who have contributed di-
rectly to the Committee’s work: Warren 
Burke, Casey Ebner, Karl Hagnauer, Alison 
Hartwich, Kakuti Lin, Chris Osborne, Adam 
Schilt, Brandon Senger, Jessica Shapiro, 
Adrienne Thomas, Michelle Vanek, and Sally 
Walker. 
FRANK PALLONE, JR., 
Chairman, Committee on 
Energy and Commerce. 
COMMITTEE ON FINANCIAL SERVICES 
As Chairwoman of the House Financial 
Services Committee, I am grateful for the 
tireless work and counsel that your staff 
provided our Committee during the First 
Session of the 117th Congress. Specifically, 
I’d like to thank Paul Callen, Marshall 
Barksdale, Veena Srinivasa, Sarah Rens 
Zavislan, Kathryn Swiss, Jim Grossman, and 
Lauren Anderson, all of whom worked with 
my Committee staff throughout the session. 
They helped prepare many pieces of legisla-
tion for our hearings and markups and 
worked into the dead of night to draft key 
pieces of legislation in our jurisdiction. No-
tably, they were essential in ensuring the 
housing provisions in the Build Back Better 
Act, our amendments to the National De-
fense Authorization Act for FY 2022, and the 
Financial Services pieces of the American 
Rescue Plan were ready for inclusion and 
carefully written. Additionally, they assisted 
my staff in preparing several critical pieces 
of housing legislation, including ‘‘The Hous-
ing is infrastructure Act,’’ ‘‘The Ending 
Homelessness Act,’’ ‘‘The Down-payment To-
ward Equity Act,’’ and the ‘‘Expediting As-
sistance to Renters and Landlords Act.’’ 
They were also instrumental in turning 
the Committee’s policy into a reality, using 
their unparalleled knowledge of consumer 
protection law on legislation such as the 
‘‘Comprehensive Debt Collection Improve-
ment Act,’’ legislation to regulate America’s 
largest banks and improve credit reporting. 
Once again, I want to thank everyone for 
their work on these key pieces of legislation 
over the past year, and I look forward to 
their continued work with us in the upcom-
ing year. 
MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, Committee on 
Financial Services. 
COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS 
The House Foreign Affairs Committee 
would like to express our deepest gratitude 
to the House Office of the Legislative Coun-
sel, especially to Mark Synnes, Mathew 
Eckstein and Kalyani Parthasarathy and 
their clerks. Their talent, commitment and 
mastery of foreign affairs statutes have re-
sulted in over 75 measures passed by the 
Committee this year. I want to particularly 
thank them for the work on the State De-
partment Authorization Act and the EAGLE 
Act. The work by this team has given the 
United States Congress a voice in serious 
matters of security, peace, development, 
human rights and democracy abroad. Count-
less individuals and countries have benefited 
from their work supporting the House For-
eign Affairs Committee, which has enabled 
America to lead and build lasting relation-
ships around the globe. We salute all of the 
Office of the Legislative Counsel for a job 
well done and look forward to our continued 
work together. 
GREGORY W. MEEKS, 
Chair, Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
COMMITTEE ON HOMELAND SECURITY 
The Committee on Homeland Security has 
benefitted greatly from the excellent work of 
several counsels, but we would specifically 
acknowledge the contributions of three sen-
ior attorneys that provided invaluable coun-
sel, Mat Eckstein, Hadley Ross, and Tom 
Cassidy. With the support of the talented 
HOLC team, the Committee has successfully 
advanced 30 measures to the House floor 
under suspension of the rules and the ‘‘Na-
tional Commission to Investigate the Janu-
ary 6 Attack on the United States Complex 
Act’’ (H.R. 3233) under a rule. In addition to 
the homeland security components of the 
‘‘Build Back Better Act’’ and the ‘‘National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 
2022,’’ the HOLC team provided the Com-
mittee with expert advice on other impor-
tant priorities, such as the ‘‘Rights for the 
TSA Workforce Act of 2021’’ (H.R. 903), the 
‘‘DHS Reform Act of 2021’’ (H.R. 4357), the 
‘‘State and Local Cybersecurity Improve-
ment Act’’ (H.R. 3138), and the ‘‘Cyber Inci-
dent Reporting for Critical Infrastructure 
Act of 2021’’ (H.R. 5440), to name just a few. 
BENNIE G. THOMPSON, 
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security. 
COMMITTEE ON HOUSE ADMINISTRATION 
As Chairperson of the Committee on House 
Administration, I extend the sincere grati-
tude of our Committee’s Members and staff 
for the exceptional work of the House Office 
of the Legislative Counsel. Among other 
issues, our committee’s jurisdictional re-
sponsibilities include oversight of federal 
elections. The talented HOLC team has pro-
vided invaluable technical assistance in our 
drafting of and contributions to major legis-
lation to strengthen our democracy and pro-
vide access to the franchise for all Ameri-
cans, including the ‘‘For the People Act,’’ 
the ‘‘John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advance-
ment Act,’’ and other important measures. 
In addition, HOLC staff provide significant 
assistance when we consider measures re-
lated to the internal procedures and prior-
ities of the daily operations of the institu-
tion, including legislative branch agencies 
and offices that provide vital services to 
Members, staff, and the public. Among the 
many experts on the HOLC staff who provide 
invaluable assistance to Members and com-
mittees every day, from the perspective of 
the Committee on House Administration, we 
take this opportunity to thank and recognize 
in particular Wade Ballou, Noah Wofsy, and 
Parker Johnson. I have seen firsthand how 
their technical expertise improves the work 
of all Members, in turn, improving the work

PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON 
INTELLIGENCE 
Drafting legislation can be a complex, de-
manding, and technical enterprise; drafting 
intelligence legislation can be especially so. 
Yet time and again, attorneys from the 
House Office of the Legislative Counsel 
(‘‘HOLC’’) have provided expert assistance to 
the House Permanent Select Committee on 
Intelligence (‘‘HPSCI’’)—at all hours and on 
the tightest of deadlines. Their efforts have 
run the gamut of intelligence and related 
subject matter, from foreign interference in 
U.S. elections, to human rights, to cyberse-
curity, to counterintelligence, and to the 
protection of Intelligence Community whis-
tleblowers. Whatever the subject or the 
project, HOLC lawyers consistently have 
been extraordinary. 
HPSCI wishes, in particular, to recognize 
the 
tremendous 
contributions 
by 
Tony 
Sciascia and Brenna Marie Gautam—who 
have been vital to the drafting of the Intel-
ligence Authorization Act, including under 
the extreme conditions imposed by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. The enormity of their 
contribution cannot be overstated. HPSCI is 
deeply grateful. 
ADAM B. SCHIFF, 
Chairman, Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence. 
COMMITTEE ON JUDICIARY 
The Committee on the Judiciary is very 
grateful for the expertise, professionalism, 
and patience of our House Office of the Leg-
islative Counsel (HOLC) colleagues. We deep-
ly appreciate the work of Hallet Brazelton, 
Megan Chasnoff, Ebony Holder, and Allison 
Gilley, the HOLC team that has worked so 
well with us this year to draft and report a 
steady stream of legislation on such issues 
as criminal justice, civil rights, and bank-
ruptcy reform. Because antitrust reform has 
been a focus this year, we are also grateful 
for Jean Harmann’s expert assistance. Fi-
nally, we express our sincere thanks to 
Susan Fleishman for working with us on im-
migration legislation, especially the immi-
gration language included in the Build Back 
Better Act. 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on Judiciary. 
COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES 
The Committee on Natural Resources owes 
much of its success to the dedicated staff at 
the HOLC. Under the leadership and expert 
guidance of Lisa Daly and her team mem-
bers, Brandon Senger, Michael Sribinder, 
Kathryn Swiss, and Billy Wilson, the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources has success-
fully ordered to be reported 63 bills and 
passed 30 bills under suspension of the rules. 
During the first session of the 117th Con-
gress, Daly and her team provided invaluable 
subject matter expertise and drafting assist-
ance for House passage of the Committee’s 
historic, nearly $20 billion-dollar, reconcili-
ation measure included in the ‘‘Build Back 
Better Act’’, the ‘‘Protecting America’s Wil-
derness and Public Lands Act’’ (H.R. 803), 
and several measures for the betterment for 
the Indigenous Peoples of the United States. 
HOLC’s efforts, often requested through late 
nights and weekends, were integral to the 
passage of legislative measures that will 
benefit the American people and our envi-
ronment for years to come. 
RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources. 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM 
The staff of the House Office of the Legis-
lative Counsel has provided the Committee 
on Oversight and Reform excellent service 
throughout the strenuous first session of the 
117th Congress. From the American Rescue 
Plan, to Postal Service Reform, the Build 
Back Better Act, and D.C. Statehood, the ex-
pertise, guidance, and drafting services of 
HOLC, especially Tom Cassidy, Sally Walk-
er, Casey Ebner, and Noah Wofsy, have been 
invaluable. The hard work and dedication of 
all the attorneys at HOLC is greatly appre-
ciated. Thank you! 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman, Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. 
COMMITTEE ON RULES 
Each week, the House Rules Committee re-
lies on the expertise of the talented staff at 
the House Office of the Legislative Counsel 
to move legislation to the House floor. Quite 
simply, we couldn’t do it without you. On be-
half of the Members and staff of the Rules 
Committee, I write to thank each and every 
attorney and staff person at HOLC for their 
dedicated service to the House of Represent-
atives. We call upon you late at night, early 
in the morning, on weekends, and every time 
in between to produce legislative text that 
will help the lives of people across the coun-
try. You’ve drafted thousands of amend-
ments and revisions that enable the voices of 
Members across the Congress—Democratic 
and Republican alike—to be heard. Some-
times, we need this text at a moment’s no-
tice, and you never fail to deliver. In par-
ticular, I’d like to thank Wade Ballou for his 
incredible leadership of HOLC, as well as 
Noah Wofsy and Bob Weinhagen who have 
worked over multiple holidays to help our 
committee finalize rules packages at the 
start of the past two Congresses. 
JAMES P. MCGOVERN, 
Chairman, House Committee on Rules. 
COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE, SPACE, AND 
TECHNOLOGY 
The Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology is grateful for the incredibly 
hard work of the House Office of the Legisla-
tive Counsel during the 117th Congress. This 
has been a very active year for the Com-
mittee, with comprehensive authorizations 
of most of the major research agencies in ad-
dition to the complex and difficult work as-
sociated with the Build Back Better Act. 
Through all this legislative activity, the 
counsels and staff of the Office of the Legis-
lative Counsel have been integral players in 
advancing the Committee’s work. Quite lit-
erally, the Committee’s legislative work 
would 
not 
have 
been 
possible 
without 
HOLC’s dedicated staff. Frequently this ses-
sion, this work included long nights and 
weekends working with Committee staff on 
legislation. In spite of these difficult hours 
and circumstances, the staff and counsels of 
the HOLC have always engaged with the 
Committee with the utmost professionalism. 
Paul Kubicki, Justin Gross, and Donalene 
Roberts have all assisted the Committee dur-
ing the 117th Congress, and their hard work 
is very much appreciated. 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology. 
COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS 
The non-partisan staff at the House Office 
of the Legislative Counsel provide invaluable 
services fundamental to the work of the 
House Small Business Committee. Veena 
Srinivasa and Thomas Anderson are dedi-
cated public servants with a work ethic rare-
ly matched on Capitol Hill. Throughout the 
COVID crisis, our committee has sped to pro-
vide relief to struggling small businesses. As 
my staff and I worked late nights and early 
mornings to meet the urgency of the mo-
ment, Veena and Tom have always been 
there to lend their sharp legal minds to our 
legislative efforts. Our office knows them as 
consummate experts in small business law, 
among many others such as government pro-
curement and financial services. Their work 
with our committee’s legislation, in addition 
to other major bills like the National De-
fense Authorization Act highlights their 
dedication to this institution and our coun-
try. Lastly, I’d like to thank Wade Ballou for 
his leadership of this critical office. HOLC is 
a vital component in the legislative process. 
Without their services, Congress would be 
much less efficient in fulfilling our duties to 
the American people. 
NYDIA M. VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business. 
COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION AND 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The non-partisan staff of the House Office 
of the Legislative Counsel have provided the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure with expert legislative drafting 
and guidance over the years. Their hard 
work has been essential to the Committee’s 
contributions this Congress to major pieces 
of legislation including the American Rescue 
Plan Act and the Build Back Better Act, as 
well as the INVEST in America Act, a five 
year surface transportation reauthorization 
that passed the House in July. We’d like to 
extend particular thanks to Karen Anderson, 
Robert Casturo, Jordyn Coad, and Kakuti 
Lin, who worked extensively with the Com-
mittee during the 117th Congress. We appre-
ciate the dedication, attention to detail, and 
professionalism of the entire HOLC staff. 
PETER A. DEFAZIO, 
Chair, Committee on Transportation 
and Infrastructure. 
COMMITTEE ON VETERANS’ AFFAIRS 
The Committee on Veterans’ Affairs is 
grateful to the dedicated staff of HOLC for 
their invaluable work during the first ses-
sion of the 117th Congress. The Committee 
has a significant legislative agenda each 
year and could not accomplish its work on 
behalf of veterans without the outstanding 
work of Hadley Ross, Tony Sciascia, Ken 
Cox, and Brenna Marie Gautam. The Com-
mittee is particularly fortunate to be able to 
collaborate with counsels who are well- 
versed on veterans matters and Title 38. The 
Committee is grateful for the work of our 
HOLC counsels—through many redrafts and 
late nights—on the ‘‘American Rescue Plan 
Act’’ and the ‘‘Build Back Better Act of 
2021’’. We are deeply appreciative of Hadley 
and Tony’s willingness to attend bicameral 
meetings to bring their expertise to thorny 
legislative drafting issues. 
The HOLC team assisted the Committee in 
developing legislation in support of military 
toxic exposure presumptions, burial benefits, 
and other disability benefit program en-
hancements this year, like the ‘‘Mark 
O’Brien VA Clothing Allowance Improve-
ment Act’’. The Committee would like to 
specifically thank Tony Sciascia and Brenna 
Marie Gautam for their efforts in developing 
the Committee’s comprehensive military 
toxic exposure package. The ‘‘Honoring our 
PACT Act’’ would not be possible without 
the support and hard work of these individ-
uals. The HOLC team was excellent in draft-
ing the ‘‘Responsible Education Mitigating 
Options 
and 
Technical 
Extensions 
(RE-
MOTE) Act’’. Their due diligence means 
50,000 veterans will have housing during 
their next school term. It also means many 
School Certifying Officials will be able to do 
their job better, and finally it will save the 
jobs of hundreds of educational employees 
from schools around the nation. The Com-
mittee is also grateful to the HOLC team for 
its work on technology-related legislation, 
to include the ‘‘VA Electronic Health Record

Finally, the HOLC team has been incredibly

pieces of legislation on mental health and re-
search, to include the ‘‘STRONG Veterans 
Act’’ and the ‘‘VA VIPER Act of 2021’’. 
MARK TAKANO, 
Chairman, House Committee on 
Veterans’ Affairs. 
COMMITTEE ON WAYS AND MEANS 
Over the last year, the Office of the Legis-
lative Counsel has worked alongside the staff 
of the House Committee on Ways and Means 
as we undertook the herculean task of mov-
ing both the American Rescue Plan and 
Build Back Better Act through the com-
mittee and on to the House floor. This proc-
ess has been anything but straightforward 
and has required late nights, last minute 
drafting sessions, and even work through 
holidays and weekends. Throughout, this 
learned band of legislative counsels with 
deep expertise across the varied jurisdiction 
of the Committee has provided expert advice 
and drafting assistance. Their unfaltering 
commitment to their craft and continued 
professionalism under extraordinary pres-
sure distinguish them as true public serv-
ants. The Committee on Ways and Means 
thanks you and the following members of 
your staff for tireless work on behalf of the 
American people: James Grossman, Jessica 
Shapiro, Scott Probst, Henry Christrup, 
Mark Synnes, Justin Gross, Paul Kubicki,

HONORING THE LIFE OF RICHARD 
BANBURY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to ask the members of the House to join 
me in mourning the passing of Richard Ban-
bury, a highly respected attorney, dedicated 
public servant, loving husband, father, and 
grandfather, and a cornerstone of the Marl-
borough community for decades. Richard 
sadly passed away on December 2, 2021, at 
the age of 83. He represented the pinnacle of 
civic and community engagement, leaving be-
hind a legacy of service and commitment to 
others. His service in the legal and political 
spheres will be held in high regard by all those 
he impacted. 
A son of Connecticut, Richard was born in 
Hartford in 1938. He excelled academically, 
attending Yale University where he graduated 
with his Bachelor’s in Economics in 1960. 
Upon graduation, Richard remained at Yale to 
pursue his passion in law, later graduating 
from Yale Law School in 1963. Immediately, 
Richard began making an impact within the 
legal field, serving as the Chair of the Jerome 
Frank Legal Aid Society in 1963 where he 
guided the organization in providing legal as-
sistance to those who could not afford private 
attorneys. He continued this passion into his 
budding career, serving as a Law Clerk to As-
sociate Justice John P. Cotter, of the Con-
necticut Supreme Court. As a result of his un-
wavering dedication to helping others through 
the law, Richard became a State’s Attorney 
and later Chief Assistant Attorney for Hartford 
County, where he served for nearly a decade. 
Richard’s legal career evolved throughout 
the years, as he began to find new areas in 
which he could make an impact. Amidst this 
evolution, Richard was chosen in a highly se-
lective process to become a Guggenheim Fel-
low at Yale Law School from 1976 through 
1977. This respected fellowship allowed Rich-
ard to further delve into his legal passions and 
develop legal academia. Richard’s next legal 
pursuit began with Rome McGuigan, P.C. in 
Hartford, where he worked as a civil litigator, 
an arbitrator, and defense counsel. As a de-
fense counsel, Richard represented the Mohe-
gan Tribe and the Mohegan Tribal Gaming 
Authority located here in Southeastern Con-
necticut. Throughout these years, Richard 
served an additional twenty-five years on the 
Connecticut Bar Examining Committee as well 
as thirty years as the Executive Director and 
Counsel to the Council on Probate Judicial 
Conduct in Connecticut. Throughout each and 
every one of his legal endeavors, Richard con-
tinuously held himself and the practice of law 
itself to higher standards of success, improv-
ing upon the quality of representation available 
throughout the region and beyond. On a per-
sonal note, I first met Richard at the Hartford 
Superior Court at 95 Washington Street when 
I was an intern in the public defender’s office 
in 1978 and had a chance to watch him argue 
cases before judges and juries. He stood out 
as a very effective advocate who conveyed a 
deep grasp of the law and a friendly but very 
strong persona that connected with his audi-
ence. Later, after I passed the bar and en-
countered him as a young lawyer, he always 
had an encouraging word in the hallways of 
the courthouse that I will never forget and still 
deeply appreciate. Years later, in 2006 he was 
a staunch supporter of my race for Congress 
which succeeded by only 83 votes out of 
241,000. He was a tireless campaigner and 
once again, I will be forever grateful to him for 
his friendship and good counsel. 
Richard lived a life of service, actively par-
ticipating on various town committees in Marl-
borough and the town’s Democratic Town 
Committee. He used his voice to advocate for 
the well-being of his community members and 
for the issues he was passionate about, in-
cluding through his published editorials in the 
Hartford Courant. His active engagement tran-
scended politics, and he spent substantial time 
fostering a community with his graduating 
class of Yale. He found enjoyment through 
service and the many pastimes he enjoyed, in-
cluding swimming in the beautiful Lake 
Terramuggus. His passion for life was admi-
rable and showcased the wealth and joys of 
community. 
All those who had the pleasure of knowing 
Richard saw firsthand his tireless work ethic 
and love of life. He is survived by his wife of 
twenty-seven years, Nicolette Banbury, six 
children—Michael, Anthony, Andrea, Jennifer, 
Samantha, Thomas, and twelve grandchildren. 
He has left an immeasurable impact on his 
beloved Marlborough community and the en-
tirety of Eastern Connecticut. I am honored to 
have known Richard and have felt the impact 
of his life’s work. As a chamber, please join 
me in sending our deepest condolences to the 
Banbury family and expressing our greatest 
respect for Richard’s work. Madam Speaker, 
to that end, I ask that we immortalize the life 
and legacy of Richard Banbury.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1383 
December 16, 2021 
IN HONOR OF THE RETIREMENT 
OF 
WILLIAM 
LEFEVRE 
FROM 
THE TRENTON CITY COUNCIL 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Councilman 
William 
LeFevre on the occasion of his retirement 
from the Trenton City Council after over thirty 
years of service to the City of Trenton, Michi-
gan. His significant contributions to our 
downriver community are worthy of com-
mendation. 
William LeFevre was born in Columbus, 
Ohio in 1948, his family moved to Southgate, 
Michigan that same year. A 1966 graduate of 
Southgate High School, he attended Central 
Michigan University from 1966 to 1970. In 
1971, he joined his parents in running the 
family business, B & D Vacuum, where he re-
mains today. In 1973, Trenton became his 
home. 
Councilman LeFevre was appointed to the 
Trenton City Council in February 1990 to fill a 
vacant seat, since then he has been reelected 
every year since. A trusted colleague among 
his peers, he’s served as Mayor Pro Tem six 
times. He is also the chairman of the Trenton 
Brownfield Committee. While serving on the 
Council he has been an advocate for Tren-
ton’s financial growth and development and 
strong voice for the City’s public safety offi-
cers. 
An active member of the community, Coun-
cilman LeFevre is a Trenton Rotarian, a Tren-
ton Jaycee, and a longtime member of Tren-
ton Faith United Methodist Church. His sharp 
wit, caring personality, and compassionate 
ways—as well as his colorful wardrobe— 
makes Councilman LeFevre someone that 
leaves a mark on each person that he meets. 
All who know him can attest to his generosity 
and love for his community. A gifted emcee, 
he has been the host of the annual Trenton 
City Awards Banquet, Trenton Education 
Foundation events, the Trenton Rotary Wild 
Game Lunch, and the Trenton Memorial Day 
and Christmas Parades for countless years. 
Councilman LeFevre and his wife Linda reside 
in Trenton, along with their two children Mat-
thew and Andrea who are proud graduates of 
Trenton High School. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Councilman William LeFevre 
for his dedicated service to the citizens of 
downriver. We are immensely grateful for all 
that he has done to improve the lives of Tren-
ton, Michigan. I join with Bill’s family, friends, 
and colleagues in extending my best wishes to 
him in retirement.

HONORING RAYMOND VENNITTI 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
and pay tribute to Raymond Vennitti, of Min-
eral Ridge, who passed away on Saturday, 
November 20th, 2021, at his residence sur-
rounded by his loving family. He was 76 years 
old. 
Ray was a great friend and supporter. He 
loved his wife, his daughter, his church, and 
his community. He was a quiet and strong 
man who was always behind the scenes to 
help and support others. He was humble, 
never looking for credit. He was prayerful, 
dedicated, and genuinely happy to be with 
people. He was old school in these ways, and 
it was always so refreshing to see. 
He was born February 15th, 1945, in 
Youngstown, 
son 
of 
William 
and 
Mary 
Belcastro Vennitti. 
Raymond was a 1963 graduate of Niles 
McKinley High School and a graduate of All-
state Barber College in Cleveland. He was a 
barber at Union Barber Shop in Niles from 
1967 to 1972 and then went on to work at 
Delphi Packard Electric for 32 years, retiring in 
2003. 
Ray was a member of Our Lady of Mount 
Carmel Parish in Niles, where he served as a 
church usher and adult alter server. He was a 
member of St. Vincent DePaul Society, 
Mahoning Valley Olde Car Club, and enjoyed 
gardening, winemaking, and their ’55 T-Bird. 
Raymond was a sergeant in the U.S. Army, 
serving one year of active duty in Vietnam. 
He will be missed by his wife, Laura Pajank 
Vennitti, whom he married on November 1st, 
1975; a daughter, Clarise of Strongsville; and 
two sisters, Nancy DeGood of Howland and 
Angela Vandegrift and her husband, Richard, 
of Howland. 
He was preceded in death by his parents 
and an infant brother, William Raymond 
Vennitti. Ray will be missed. And our commu-
nity and church were much better because of 
his total commitment to serve others. God 
Bless Ray. I was honored to call you friend.

RECOGNIZING WILLIAM T. JOHN-
SON FOR HIS SERVICE AND EF-
FORTS THAT SAVED THE LIVES 
OF NUMEROUS AFGHAN PART-
NERS 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the work of Colonel 
(Ret.) William T. Johnson, a retired U.S. Army 
officer and member of the Armed Services 
Committee’s professional staff. 
The work of this legislative body is sup-
ported by staff who work determinedly on be-
half of the American public. These public serv-
ants provide valuable policy advice to Mem-
bers of Congress, assist in crafting legislation 
and facilitating Congress’ oversight respon-
sibilities, among many important duties. While 
the work of all congressional staff should be 
recognized, I want to take a moment to single 
out COL Johnson for going above and beyond 
his professional responsibilities. 
COL Johnson has served for many years on 
the Armed Services Committee as an expert 
on Afghanistan policy. This past year, COL 
Johnson provided invaluable advice to Mem-
bers of Congress both on and off the Armed 
Service Committee, staffed critical hearings 
and briefings, drafted essential, late-breaking 
updates to the Department’s authorities for the 
scope of its work in Afghanistan. As events 
unfolded in Afghanistan, offices across Capitol 
Hill received countless requests for assistance 
from Americans, Afghan partners, and mem-
bers of the international community seeking 
safe passage out of Afghanistan. Many of 
those seeking assistance approached the 
Committee and COL Johnson took great initia-
tive. He not only navigated the formal Defense 
and State Department process but also lever-
aged his own informal networks, based on his 
prior military service and time serving in Af-
ghanistan. COL Johnson made connections 
that helped vulnerable individuals navigate 
their way safely to the United States. His tire-
less efforts and hours of work saved countless 
lives. 
The Armed Services Committee and Mem-
ber offices received many testimonials in the 
form of pictures, emails, and text messages 
confirming that individuals COL Johnson as-
sisted had made it to safety. Without the tire-
less work of the men and women of the 
United States Armed Forces, the State De-
partment, and public servants like COL John-
son, such messages of gratitude would not 
have been possible. This was a tremendous 
accomplishment. Speaking for myself, other 
Members of Congress, the American people, 
Afghans, and other partners, I thank him for 
his service and efforts.

INTRODUCTION OF A BILL TO DES-
IGNATE THE DISTRICT OF CO-
LUMBIA AS AN EMPOWERMENT 
ZONE 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to in-
troduce a bill that would statutorily add the 
District of Columbia to the national empower-
ment zone program, which provides federal 
tax incentives for businesses to locate and in-
vest in low-income areas. In 1993, Congress 
created the national empowerment zone pro-
gram and left it to federal agencies to des-
ignate a certain number of low-income areas 
as empowerment zones. The District was not 
one of the areas selected. However, in 1997, 
working primarily with Republicans in Con-
gress, I created federal tax incentives for in-
vestment in the District by businesses and in-
dividuals. The business incentives were similar 
to, but more generous than, those available 
under the national empowerment zone pro-
gram. I got the D.C. incentives reauthorized 
regularly until 2011, when Congress refused to 
extend only the D.C. incentives. At the same 
time, the national empowerment zone program 
continued to be extended and was last ex-
tended through 2025. Under my bill, certain 
low-income 
neighborhoods, 
particularly 
in 
Wards 5, 7 and 8, would be treated as em-
powerment zones as long as the national em-
powerment zone program remains in effect. 
The wisdom of the bipartisan, modest, tar-
geted business tax incentives for D.C. has 
been amply and visibly demonstrated in the 
economic resurgence of parts of the nation’s 
capital where they were utilized. Among the 
most visible examples are the formerly run-
down area around Capital One Arena, which 
is now surrounded by offices, restaurants and

vibrant nightlife, and the Penn Quarter neigh-
borhood, which had limited residential, com-
mercial and retail spaces, and is now a pop-
ular mixed-use neighborhood. 
Unfortunately, the D.C. tax incentives were 
allowed to expire before the poorest D.C. 
neighborhoods were ready to make use of 
them, especially in Wards 5, 7 and 8. With-
drawing the D.C. tax incentives, particularly 
after they had proven to be effective, has left 
the nation’s capital with essentially half of a 
revival, and was tragically timed just as the 
lower-income parts of the District, which need 
the incentives most, are ready for redevelop-
ment. The effectiveness of these incentives for 
the District has been demonstrated and their 
costs have been de minimis compared to the 
measurable benefits they have generated in 
the District. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

HONORING SALVATORE J. PONZIO 
III 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, December 16, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
and pay tribute to Salvatore J. Ponzio III, 36, 
of Girard, who passed away peacefully on 
Sunday, December 12, 2021, at his home. 
Sal was born August 8, 1985, in Youngs-
town, Ohio, the son of Salvatore J. and Judy 
(Demas) Ponzio. 
Sal was a 2004 graduate of Girard High 
School, a graduate of Youngstown State Uni-
versity with his bachelor’s degree, and a grad-
uate of Kent State University with his MBA. 
Sal had worked for Ernst & Young in Cleve-
land for six years and had previously lived in 
Rocky River, Ohio. He was a member of St. 
Rose Church. 
Sal loved all kinds of sports, especially golf. 
He was a personal trainer and had even vol-
unteered for coaching this year for the Girard 
High School football team. Sal was the author 
of ‘‘F.I.T. Finance,’’ a book which he wrote to 
help young adults manage their finances. 
He leaves to cherish his memory, his par-
ents; grandmother, Regina Demas; brother, 
Joe (Lucille) Ponzio of Lake Wylie, South 
Carolina; sister, Gina (Dave) Sherock of Co-
lumbus; nephew, Dominic Ponzio; nieces, 
Lucia and Viviana Ponzio and Carmella 
Sherock and his loving girlfriend, Alessandra 
LaMonica. He also leaves aunts, uncles, cous-
ins, and many wonderful friends. 
The Girard community is devastated by the 
loss of this amazing young man. We will all 
work to make sure he is never forgotten be-
cause he set a standard of kindness and com-
passion for which we all need to strive. God 
Bless Sal. He left our world a lot better than 
he found it.
