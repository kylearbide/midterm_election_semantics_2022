DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
September 14, 2021.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, deal with us according to 
Your love, and by Your grace trans-
form all that we set forth to do this 
day. Reveal Your loving kindness to us. 
Direct our steps; give us evidence of 
Your mercy that we would be com-
pelled to follow Your commands and 
live according to Your law. 
It is clearly time, O Lord, for You to 
act. We are beholden to Your faithful 
promises to step in on our behalf. Your 
law is being broken. Your gracious de-
sign for peace in our land is being over-
whelmed by acts of terrorism. And 
Your desire for unity is being under-
mined by seeds of spite and doubt. 
When all around us threatens to sub-
vert even our most noble efforts, may 
we appreciate that as Your servants we 
must yield our whole selves to the way 
You would have us go. 
When our own eyes fail and we long 
for Your salvation, may we have faith 
enough in Your mercy to know that 
You will give us Your vision. 
And when we are depleted of energy 
and ideas, may we trust that You will 
grant us discernment and embolden our 
efforts. 
We commit this day, and all it 
throws in our way, to the redemption 
of Your hands. And we pray this prayer 
trusting in Your sovereign name. 
Amen.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
have a busy day in store for the Senate 
as we aim to hold a number of impor-
tant votes before the start of Yom 
Kippur. 
Today, we will vote to advance four 
Presidential nominations. First, we 
will confirm James Kvaal to be Under 
Secretary of Education, and we will 
also confirm both David Estudillo and 
Angel Kelley to serve as district judges 
in Washington and Massachusetts, re-
spectively. 
This afternoon, we will also advance 
the 
nomination 
of 
Ms. 
Veronica 
Rossman of Colorado, who has been 
nominated by President Biden to sit on 
the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. Ms. 
ROSSman has spent practically her en-
tire legal career in public service as a 
Federal defender, giving a voice in the 
courtroom to those who often cannot 
afford legal representation. 
She is also an immigrant, who fled 
Russia with her parents as a child after 
her family endured anti-Semitic perse-
cution in their home country. She un-
derstands personally the damage faced 
by those who endure discrimination. 
If confirmed, Ms. ROSSman would be 
the only Federal defender to sit on the 
Tenth Circuit, and one of the few in the 
entire country. I am proud to have 
nominated Eunice Lee to the Second 
Circuit Court of New York. She, too, 
has been a Federal defender. 
We also have plenty of prosecutors 
and corporate lawyers wearing black 
robes. 
Like so many other of President 
Biden’s 
judicial 
nominees, 
Ms. 
ROSSman is going to bring a sorely 
needed perspective to our courts. The 
more we work to make our courts re-
flective of the diversity of this coun-
try, both demographic and profes-
sionally, the more we will strengthen 
the public’s trust in our judicial sys-
tem. 
Now, secondly, today, the Senate 
Democrats will also continue work to 
turn President Biden’s Build Back Bet-
ter agenda into law. It bears repeating: 
This is a historic effort. This is not 
just another simple piece of legisla-
tion. We are laying a foundation for an-
other century of American prosperity. 
Just like the Great Society and the 
New Deal before it, our legislation will 
bring transformational change to help 
build ladders so that those can climb 
up into the middle class, while making 
it easier for those already in the mid-
dle class to enjoy that middle class life 
and stay there. Too many in the middle 
class worry they are going to slip out 
with all the changes occurring in our 
society. We strengthen their ability to 
stay. 
And too many who are trying to 
climb those ladders find the ladders 
steep and unavailable. We are pro-
viding those ladders so they can get 
there, too. It is strong, bold, important 
legislation, and it is really a privilege 
to be here in the Senate and consider 
something as strong and bold as this. 
Later today, our caucus will discuss 
the latest elements of the reconcili-
ation bill. Working with our colleagues 
in the House, we will have met the tar-
get date of September 15 set in the

budget resolution for producing text to 
review. 
I expect our committee chairs will 
provide an overview of all the work 
that each of their committees have 
done over the last 4 weeks in drafting 
legislative text, and the entire caucus 
will have the chance to offer feedback 
so we can continue to move this proc-
ess forward. 
This will continue to be a collabo-
rative process. Everyone—everyone—is 
going to have input into this legisla-
tion. But, of course, our unity is our 
strength, and if we are not unified with 
50 votes, we can’t get anything done. 
So we all must come together. 
Now, I am pleased to say, after work-
ing for weeks over the summer on our 
reconciliation bill, we are making 
great progress toward bringing the bill 
to the floor. 
Now, while Democrats are fighting to 
strengthen the middle class, our Re-
publican colleagues, unfortunately, are 
resorting to the same, tired, predict-
able objections they raise about prac-
tically any Democratic proposal. Rath-
er than explain why they oppose sup-
porting 
families 
or 
expanding 
healthcare or taking action on climate 
change, they spent the last several 
months 
recycling 
old 
accusations 
about ‘‘liberal wish lists.’’ And rather 
than engage our policies on the merits 
and have a real debate, too often they 
raised 
unwarranted 
and 
incorrect 
points about how these programs will 
impact inflation. 
I remind my colleagues of a report 
released not long ago by the chief econ-
omist at Moody’s Analytics, Mr. Mark 
Zandi. When Mr. Zandi examined the 
Democrats’ two main legislative pro-
posals, our infrastructure bill and our 
Build Back Better legislation, he con-
cluded these packages would provide a 
massive boost to our economy. Specifi-
cally, he said our program would ‘‘lift 
the economy’s longer-term growth po-
tential’’ and would ‘‘lift productivity 
and labor force growth’’; that is, our 
proposal will do exactly what we said it 
would do, according to this impartial 
arbiter, Mark Zandi. 
And as for the Republicans’ over-
heated rhetoric on inflation, Mr. Zandi 
dismisses such concerns as ‘‘overdone’’ 
and said our two infrastructure bills 
are designed to ‘‘ease’’—his words—in-
flation pressures. 
Let me repeat that. According to 
Moody’s top economist—hardly a fer-
vent liberal—the Democratic proposals 
would actually ease inflation pressures, 
not raise them. 
When you strengthen worker produc-
tivity, 
when 
you 
increase 
supply 
chains, 
the 
push 
to 
inflation 
de-
creases—decreases. And he also said 
that, in the long term, it would help 
grow our economy so that more Ameri-
cans can get to and stay in the middle 
class. 
Compare that to the signature ac-
complishments 
that Senate Repub-
licans forced when they were in charge: 
a massive tax break for corporations 
and the wealthy that did little to help 
everyday Americans. 
That is the difference between a 
Democratic majority and a Republican 
one. We are fighting to strengthen 
American workers and American fami-
lies. Republicans seem only worried 
about protecting those at the very top. 
And, in addition, to those with infla-
tionary concerns, we are going to pay 
for our proposal. The Trump tax cuts, 
which every Republican voted for, cre-
ated a $2 trillion deficit. 
So let’s be realistic here. Let’s be 
honest here. The charges of runaway 
inflation are just wrong, especially 
when you consider we are paying for it, 
when Republicans were so willing to 
give tax cuts to the rich without pay-
ing for them at all. 
f 
VOTING RIGHTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on another subject—one that the Pre-
siding Officer cares about a great deal, 
among the many other things you care 
about a great deal—voting rights. All 
year long, Senate Democrats have com-
mitted to passing legislation to protect 
the most sacrosanct right in our de-
mocracy, the right to vote. On two oc-
casions, 
Senate 
Democrats 
voted 
unanimously to begin debate in the 
Senate on this critical issue, and both 
times Republicans formed a wall of 
total opposition against any progress 
on voting rights in the U.S. Senate. 
But Republicans’ refusal to work 
with us is no excuse for not getting 
something done. So later today, my 
colleague, Senator KLOBUCHAR, along 
with Senators KAINE, KING, MANCHIN, 
MERKLEY, 
PADILLA, 
TESTER, 
and 
WARNOCK, will be introducing the Free-
dom to Vote Act, a compromise voting 
rights bill that I intend to schedule a 
vote on in the very near future. 
To piece this bill together, I am 
proud to have convened and worked 
with eight Members of my caucus—four 
progressives and four moderates—in 
bringing this bill to fruition. The com-
promise proposal contains many of the 
important provisions of previous vot-
ing rights bills championed by Senate 
Democrats, particularly by my col-
league Senator MERKLEY. It will pro-
tect the right to vote and put a stop to 
partisan 
gerrymandering 
and 
the 
scourge of dark money in our politics. 
Critically, the legislation also incor-
porates important feedback from elec-
tion officials and includes new meas-
ures to promote greater voter con-
fidence in our elections while stopping 
partisan election subversion. This is a 
good proposal, one that nobody in this 
Chamber should oppose. 
My colleague Senator MANCHIN
is 
working with Republicans to secure 
support for the bill, and we look for-
ward to hearing what changes they 
might make on legislation. I applaud 
Senator MANCHIN for his work here. He 
has always said that he wants to try 
and bring Republicans on, and now 
with the support of Democrats and this 
compromise bill that Senator MANCHIN 
had great input into, he can go forward 
in that regard. 
The fact of the matter is that this 
legislation is critical for stopping some 
of the most egregious assaults against 
voting rights happening at the State 
level. A few weeks ago, the Governor of 
Texas signed one of the most sweeping 
voter suppression bills in the entire 
country. It comes on the heels of other 
restrictions sprouting across the coun-
try—from ending election day registra-
tion in Montana, limiting after-hour 
drop boxes in Florida, and even making 
it a crime to give food and water to 
voters at the polls in Georgia. 
No one can look at these restrictions 
with a straight face and say they have 
a legitimate purpose. They have only 
one goal. It is a despicable goal. It is a 
nasty goal, making it harder for 
younger, poorer, non-White, and typi-
cally Democratic voters to access the 
ballot. 
Republicans lost the election. Biden 
is President. I am majority leader. In-
stead of doing what you are supposed 
to do in a democracy—win over the 
people you didn’t win before—they are 
trying to stop the people who didn’t 
vote for them from voting. That is 
autocratic, 
anti-democratic—small 
‘‘D’’—and not what America is all 
about. It is a new phase of what used to 
be called ‘‘Jim Crow.’’ 
The Freedom to Vote Act is a nec-
essary step to put an end to these as-
saults on the franchise. As majority 
leader, it is my intention to hold a vote 
on this bill as soon as next week, as I 
mentioned. 
f 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
finally, on debt ceiling. In the long his-
tory of our country—the long, long his-
tory—the United States has never de-
faulted on its obligations to pay its 
debt. The full faith and credit of the 
United States has been the bedrock of 
our country’s economic prosperity—a 
spotless record that both parties have, 
for years, worked together to preserve. 
No matter who was President, Demo-
crat or Republican, in the past, the 
other party always stepped up to the 
plate and said: We can’t let the country 
default. 
Until most recently, when President 
Trump 
was 
in 
office, 
Democrats 
stepped up on three separate occasions 
to work with Republicans to suspend 
the debt ceiling and continue to ensure 
that the U.S. was able to pay its bills, 
even when there was a Democratic ma-
jority in the House. We did not resort 
to hostage-taking or proclaim that it 
was the other side’s responsibility. We 
simply knew that when it came to the 
debt ceiling, it was important to put 
aside political differences and act re-
sponsibly, no matter who sits in the 
Oval Office. 
We know that failing to raise the 
debt ceiling would be—as the Repub-
lican leader has said in the past when

S6465 
September 14, 2021 
Trump was President and he was argu-
ing that Democrats should join him, 
would be a disaster. Well, if anything, 
that is an understatement. 
Just yesterday, one top forecaster 
said that ‘‘a failure to raise the debt 
limit will have serious negative con-
sequences.’’ So in the immediate fu-
ture, we need to raise the debt ceiling 
again. As in previous instances, it 
must, must, be a bipartisan endeavor, 
and the reason is simple: We have to 
get this done. 
But much of the recent debt we need 
to pay for was incurred during the 
Trump administration. In fact, Presi-
dent Trump added nearly $8 trillion to 
the national debt, $51⁄2 trillion of which 
was since the last time the debt limit 
was suspended until Trump’s final day 
in office. 
So, in other words, $51⁄2 trillion of 
this debt is totally under Republican 
management, 
in 
a 
sense, 
because 
Trump was the President and Leader 
MCCONNELL was the majority leader. 
Democrats think that we got that. 
That is when the debt was created, 
with Republican votes—lots of Repub-
lican votes. Both sides, led by a Repub-
lican Senate, as I said, incurred much 
of this debt. Senators from both parties 
overwhelmingly voted in support of the 
many laws that contributed to this ob-
ligation. So neither party can wash its 
hands of responsibility to pay the bills. 
Leader MCCONNELL
keeps talking 
about the new spending the Democrats 
have done. That is not this debt. This 
debt, $51⁄2 trillion, was all under Trump 
and when McConnell was the majority 
leader. Leader MCCONNELL was the ma-
jority leader. 
Some Republicans recklessly, irre-
sponsibly, so overwhelmingly politi-
cally seem eager to push our economy 
to the brink of total catastrophe by 
suggesting they will oppose any effort 
to raise the debt ceiling. And rather 
than urging their colleagues to imme-
diately drop this reckless idea, the Re-
publican leader—shame on him—seems 
to be giving it his blessing, if not pro-
moting it. 
If the United States defaults on its 
debt, it will harm every single Amer-
ican in this country, including poten-
tially those who rely on Social Secu-
rity and the members of our military. 
The 
consequences 
will 
reverberate 
around the world and will cause irrep-
arable harm to the global economy at a 
time when we are all working to lift 
ourselves out of a once-in-a-century 
pandemic. 
So any efforts to play nasty, political 
games with the full faith and credit of 
the United States is reckless, irrespon-
sible, and despicable. It could pose per-
manent damage to the U.S. economy 
and is a complete nonstarter. 
In America, when it is time to pay 
the bills, we do it without exception. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

LEADER

f 
DEBT CEILING 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
here is a quote to start the day: 
I do think we’re in very serious danger of 
repeating almost all the mistakes of the 
1960s and early 1970s. 
That is Larry Summers, the senior 
advisor to two Democratic Presidents, 
about the risk of inflation we face 
today. 
As one report explained: 
The former Treasury secretary has been 
warning since February that President Joe 
Biden’s big-spending agenda was creating the 
risk of an inflation spike this year, poten-
tially cutting into the economic recovery 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Oh, but Washington Democrats have 
spent trillions—trillions—of dollars on 
pet liberal projects. They have been 
printing and wasting money like there 
is no tomorrow, and American families 
are hurting as a result. 
Inflation has more than overtaken 
the average worker’s wage growth 
since last year. Employers are raising 
wages higher and higher, but their 
workers’ paychecks go less and less far. 
Families’ incomes and savings are 
eroding right before their eyes. 
Democrats have done this proudly— 
proudly—on a party-line basis. Back in 
2020, during the teeth of the COVID 
emergency, Congress worked across 
party lines to pass massive rescue 
packages that Republicans and Demo-
crats had written together. Virtually 
every serious expert agreed that after 
the last relief bill that we passed in De-
cember, the economy was primed and 
ready to go. 
But our Democratic colleagues want-
ed more. Like they admitted from the 
start of the pandemic, they wanted to 
use the crisis to ‘‘restructure things to 
fit [their] vision’’ [from a temporary 
emergency to permanent socialism]. 
They bragged the bipartisan bill they 
passed in March was the most leftwing 
legislation in American history. Now 
they want to dwarf that bill with a 
reckless 
taxing-and-spending 
spree 
that would cost trillions more and bury 
the country in job-killing tax hikes. 
When it comes to spending and the 
economy, President Biden, Speaker 
PELOSI, and the Democratic leader 
have made a conscious decision: They 
don’t want Republican-governing part-
ners. They want to go it alone. Well, 
with one exception—just one exception. 
No, Republicans won’t have any 
input into the massive, reckless tax-
ing-and-spending spree that will stick 
middle-class families with higher costs, 
lower wages, and a socialist country 
they didn’t vote for. 
But Democrats do want Republicans’ 
help with just one thing. They want us 
to help raise the credit limit to make 
it happen. They want us to help clear 
the path for their partisan, job-killing 
agenda, which we oppose. 
So let’s make this perfectly clear, in 
case anybody is in doubt. The debt sus-
pension that just expired in August 
automatically covered the borrowing 
that had been accumulated before that 
date. This is the discussion about the 
future. This isn’t the last 4 years, when 
we were reaching bipartisan govern-
ment funding agreements, bipartisan 
appropriations, and bipartisan COVID 
bills. 
Democrats have made a different 
choice. They want to make policy all 
by themselves. So they can come up 
with the financing on their own as 
well. The Democratic leaders have 
every tool and procedure they need to 
handle the debt limit on a partisan 
basis, just like they are choosing to 
handle everything else. 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
now, on a completely different matter, 
providing for the common defense and 
protecting the American people is one 
of the fundamental responsibilities our 
Founders entrusted to the Federal Gov-
ernment. It is a core obligation of the 
Commander in Chief. 
Yet, to a deadly degree, a parade of 
mistakes in Afghanistan tells us Presi-
dent Biden and his team have failed 
this most basic test of competence. For 
20 years, the United States has success-
fully kept terrorists from staging an-
other major attack on our homeland. 
Over the years, we have reduced our 
own military presence in Afghanistan, 
secured greater assistance in foreign 
partners, and supported local Afghan 
forces who did the vast majority of the 
fighting. This strategy kept al-Qaida 
on the run. It kept the Taliban from 
taking control, and it kept Afghani-
stan from becoming a safe haven for 
terror. 
In only a matter of months, Presi-
dent Biden and his team have squan-
dered all of that—squandered it. The 
collapse we witnessed wasn’t inevi-
table. It didn’t happen on its own. It 
happened 
because 
President 
Biden 
pulled the plug on our Afghan partners 
and pulled the rug out from under our 
allies who were with us in this shared 
fight. 
Everyone seemed to realize this is a 
historic disaster for the United States, 
except maybe the President and his 
loyal retainers. 
Secretary Blinken points to the fran-
tic evacuation of 100,000 desperate peo-
ple as a huge success. Seriously? They 
initially didn’t envision having to 
evacuate anyone. The number of people 
evacuated is not a metric of success for

this administration; it is a measure of 
their failure. 
Back in April, my colleague the 
Democratic leader heaped praise on 
what he called President Biden’s ‘‘care-
ful and thought-out plan with a real 
timetable and a firm end date.’’ Does 
he stand by this lavish praise for a 
careful and thought-out plan? Crickets. 
Was it wise to conduct our retreat dur-
ing the height of the fighting season? 
Was it sound strategy to preemptively 
abandon the strategic Bagram Air Base 
in the middle of the night without tell-
ing our partners? Was it careful and 
prudent to tie our departure to the 20th 
anniversary of September 11? 
Our botched retreat from a so-called 
endless war cost more American lives 
than nearly the prior 2 years combined. 
And make no mistake, the war against 
terror hasn’t ended—far, far from it. In 
a rare moment of candor, the Biden ad-
ministration’s own experts have admit-
ted explicitly that we will face new ter-
rorist threats from inside Afghanistan 
sooner rather than later. We will have 
to 
face 
a 
more 
entrenched 
and 
emboldened 
enemy 
with 
fewer 
re-
sources, fewer friends, and more con-
straints. 
So virtually every reason and advan-
tage that President Biden said this pol-
icy would bring about has already 
proven absolutely false. 
The administration said leaving Af-
ghanistan would let us focus more re-
sources on China, but its catastrophic 
retreat has tied up even more re-
sources, including strategic naval as-
sets from the Indo-Pacific. And while 
the administration’s officials are con-
sumed—consumed—with 
this 
catas-
trophe, China is cultivating deeper ties 
with the Taliban. 
The administration told us our mili-
tary and intelligence community could 
keep terrorists at bay with over-the- 
horizon capabilities, but longer dis-
tances, fewer assets, and less intel-
ligence are already taking their toll, 
and innocent civilians appear to be 
paying the price. 
Even still, the White House continues 
to peddle misleading comparisons with 
operations in other theaters, ignoring 
the unique challenges of keeping close 
eyes on a landlocked country with a 
hostile government thousands of miles 
from U.S. bases. 
Administration officials like to say 
there is no imminent threat posed by 
al-Qaida emanating from Afghanistan. 
But their abandonment of Afghanistan 
has already allowed that threat to 
grow, and we will have fewer resources 
with which to confront the gathering 
threat. According to press reporting, 
just this very morning, the Deputy Di-
rector of the CIA has acknowledged 
they are seeing al-Qaida terrorists 
flowing back—back—into Afghanistan, 
and our intelligence capabilities are al-
ready diminished. 
But there is a larger pattern of bro-
ken promises. The President said that 
everyone who wanted to get out would 
be able to do so, that we would leave no 
one behind. Instead, we left Americans 
and vulnerable Afghans behind. 
Secretary Blinken said the Taliban 
committed to allow Americans and 
vulnerable Afghans safe passage to the 
airport. Instead, we know Americans 
and Afghans were prevented from get-
ting to the airport. Many still cannot 
leave. 
The administration said that we 
would have tremendous leverage over 
the Taliban, that they would need 
international recognition and funding. 
Yet the Taliban doesn’t seem to be ter-
ribly concerned with global PR. 
The administration said they would 
hold the Taliban accountable. They 
haven’t. 
The administration seems to believe 
the Taliban would establish an inclu-
sive and representational government. 
Look, we are talking about a govern-
ment of medieval theocrats—medieval 
theocrats—the same killers, kidnap-
pers, and hostage-takers who aided and 
abetted the terrorist architects of 9/11. 
Well, their government is, however, 
inclusive in one way. It is inclusive in 
one way. Listen to this. It includes 
four—four—of the Guantanamo Bay 
terrorists released by President Obama 
in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl; four 
people who were at GTMO, exchanged 
for Bowe Bergdahl. And that is only 
part of the government. It also in-
cludes a senior Haqqani terrorist with 
a $5 million bounty on his head and 
American blood on his hands—another 
top official in the government. This is 
not a government that cares about 
staying in the good graces of the so- 
called international community. 
Enough fluff. Enough spin. It is time 
for hard truths and accountability. The 
Biden administration’s conduct over 
the past several months demands thor-
ough instigation by the Senate. That 
will begin with Secretary Blinken’s 
hearing at the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee today. I hope the Secretary and 
the administration he represents are 
prepared to answer some tough ques-
tions about past decisions, as well as 
future plans. The American people and 
the vulnerable partners we have left 
behind deserve nothing less.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, in just a 
moment, I want to talk a little bit 
about the situation in Afghanistan. 
But before I do that, I just wanted to 
speak to something that the majority 
leader said earlier regarding some of 
the upcoming business that we have to 
deal with this fall. 
We have a whole series of deadlines 
in front of us. The fiscal year ends on 
September 30, meaning that we have to 
at some point fund the government, 
which presumably would be in the form 
of a continuing resolution. We are told 
that the House of Representatives, 
when they move that and send it over 
here, will include a debt-limit increase. 
The debt limit does run out, and we 
will hit that at some point. There are 
varying estimates of when exactly that 
would be—some say as early as mid-Oc-
tober; some say perhaps mid-Novem-
ber—but inevitably that will be upon 
us. There has been a discussion here 
about how that ought to be lifted and 
who ought to deliver the votes to get 
that done. 
I just want to make the point that 
the majority leader, as he was down 
here making his remarks earlier, indi-
cated that this was all debt that was 
accumulated during the previous ad-
ministration. Certainly there was some 
debt because, obviously, during the 
coronavirus pandemic, all of us re-
sponded in a very bipartisan way. Most 
of the debt was at that point in time. It 
was the votes that we made in March 
of 2020 and subsequently to that. 
Of course, there was another $2 tril-
lion earlier this year in February, 
which no Republican voted for—that 
was all Democratic votes—most of 
which had nothing to do with the virus; 
most of which had to do with other ele-
ments of their agenda, including ex-
panding the government. 
But, nevertheless, when the debt 
limit hit its expiration at the end of 
July, it reset, and it covered every-
thing up until that point. What we are 
talking about now is raising the debt 
limit to accommodate trillions and 
trillions of new spending proposed by 
the Democrats here in Washington and 
by the President and his administra-
tion. 
It strikes me, at least, that that 
being the case, if the Democrats on 
their own, without a single Republican 
vote—and there won’t be any Repub-
lican votes for the $31⁄2 trillion bill they 
are talking about, which the Com-
mittee for a Responsible Federal Budg-
et says really isn’t $31⁄2 trillion; it is 
$51⁄2 trillion—$51⁄2 trillion of new spend-
ing, massive expansion of the govern-
ment, financed some with tax increases 
but inevitably some with adding to the 
debt—that it would make sense, since 
the Democrats are going to do that 
through reconciliation, which is a 
purely partisan exercise, with only 
their votes, that it could accommodate

September 14, 2021 
an increase in the debt limit to pay for 
all of that spending. 
I think that is a fair—very fair way 
to look at this. It strikes me, at least, 
that since the Democrats have em-
barked upon this one-party-rule ap-
proach, that if they are going to spend 
another $31⁄2 to $51⁄2 trillion, that they 
ought to raise the debt limit to accom-
modate all that additional spending. I 
think that is a reasonable way to ap-
proach this, and I, frankly, think it is 
consistent if you look at what has hap-
pened in the past. 
The last time we raised the debt 
limit was in the summer of 2019. That 
was a bipartisan deal, and it was a bi-
partisan deal that actually put caps on 
spending. We were limiting spending as 
we were raising the debt limit. Repub-
licans and Democrats joined together 
at the time to do that. 
The spending that I referenced in 
March of 2020, the $41⁄2 trillion or there-
abouts that was spent on the response 
to the pandemic, was also bipartisan. 
In fact, it was so bipartisan, it passed 
in the Senate 96 to 0. Does anybody 
here ever remember anything around 
here passing 96 to 0, particularly of 
that consequence? Clearly—clearly— 
there was strong bipartisan support for 
doing something that needed to be 
done in response to the worst pandemic 
we have seen in this country in a cen-
tury. 
Those were things that were done in 
a bipartisan fashion. Now, this is an 
entirely different scenario. And I don’t 
think anybody can dispute the fact 
that the Democrats, as they embark 
upon this $31⁄2 trillion reckless tax-and- 
spending spree, and, again, other esti-
mates—the Committee for a Respon-
sible Federal Budget says it is not $31⁄2 
trillion; it is actually $51⁄2 trillion when 
you look at the spend out in the var-
ious budget windows and timelines. 
But let’s just say for the sake of ar-
gument that it is $31⁄2 trillion to $51⁄2 
trillion. It is still a massive amount of 
spending, none of which is related to 
the coronavirus, all of which is part of 
a dramatic expansion of government, 
which I have referred to before here on 
the floor as the ‘‘free everything’’ bill— 
literally cradle to grave, the govern-
ment, the Federal Government, will 
take care of you—in addition to a lot of 
other leftwing agenda priorities like 
green energy provisions and all sorts of 
things in this that are Democratic pri-
orities with no buy-in from Repub-
licans, no attempt to reach out to Re-
publicans or to do anything in a bipar-
tisan way. 
This is a strictly, purely partisan ex-
ercise in which the Democrats are try-
ing to include things that have abso-
lutely no relationship to spending, 
debt, or revenues, which is what the 
reconciliation process is designed for. 
They are talking about doing immi-
gration—immigration—major, 
major 
policy that needs to be done on a bipar-
tisan basis that affects this country in 
a profound way, as we can see from the 
crisis at the border. Already in the 
month of July of this year, there was a 
420-percent increase over the previous 
year in the number of illegal crossings. 
Two hundred and twelve thousand peo-
ple came across the border illegally 
just in the month of July. It is a major, 
consequential crisis. The Democrats 
are going to try to do something to le-
galize people who are here illegally 
without addressing the other elements 
of the immigration debate on a strictly 
partisan basis as a part of the rec-
onciliation bill. This is a purely, purely 
partisan exercise done without any 
input from Republicans. 
I don’t think there is a single Repub-
lican who ought to be pushed into or 
feel like they in any way need to sup-
port the massive expansion of govern-
ment we are talking about here, the 
trillions and trillions and trillions of 
dollars in new spending. 
That is what the debt limit is about. 
It is about raising the amount of debt, 
the amount that this country can bor-
row, to pay for a massive expansion— 
massive 
expansion, 
reckless 
expan-
sion—of our government that moves us 
more in the direction of a Western Eu-
ropean social democracy rather than 
the American country that I think we 
all know and love. 
We have a heritage in this country. It 
is built around freedom. It is built 
around individual responsibility. It is 
built on the need to protect our coun-
try and maintain a strong national de-
fense. I think that is one thing I hope 
that, as we look at spending, we can 
agree upon. 
But this massive expansion of what 
they call social or human infrastruc-
ture is nothing more and nothing less 
than the biggest expansion of govern-
ment that we have seen literally in 
decades, and it will be financed— 
some—with tax increases, which I 
could spend a lot of time talking about, 
which will harm the economy, but also 
with additional debt. 
And that debt, the debt that is ac-
quired for the huge runup in spending 
that will be supported purely by Demo-
crats through reconciliation, a proce-
dure that is a partisan procedure, that 
ought to be paid for—that ought to be 
done by Democrat votes. And it can be 
done. There is a way in which the rec-
onciliation procedure can be used to 
raise the debt limit to pay for all of the 
new spending that the Democrats have 
in this bill. 
So when they get down here and talk 
about how important it is to be bipar-
tisan, well, it would be one thing if 
there was actually any kind of a bipar-
tisan negotiation going on, but there 
isn’t. And the last time the debt limit 
was raised, there was, in 2019, and at 
that time it was about caps. It was 
about reducing spending. There was a 
bipartisan agreement to reduce spend-
ing as the debt limit was being in-
creased. 
The other thing I would mention in 
response to what the majority leader 
said earlier is that the debt that was 
accumulated in the previous adminis-
tration, much of which was done on a 
bipartisan basis in response to the big-
gest pandemic that this country has 
seen in a hundred years, in March of 
2020—$4.5 trillion of that debt was put 
on the bill because of a bipartisan 
agreement that was reached, as I said 
earlier, 96 to 0. Ninety-six to 0 was the 
vote here in the U.S. Senate. 
So Democrats want to go down this 
path. If they want to spend, spend, 
spend like there is no tomorrow and 
tax, tax, tax like there is no tomorrow 
and borrow, borrow, borrow like there 
is no tomorrow, then they ought to 
pay, pay, pay with their votes when it 
comes to raising the debt limit and, 
unfortunately, handing the bill for that 
to our kids and grandkids. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. President, 20 years ago, on a 
clear September morning, the unthink-
able happened: an attack on our Nation 
here at home on our own soil. Almost 
3,000 Americans died that day, and our 
Nation reeled. But in the midst of grief 
and fear, there was also hope. 
We saw evil on September 11, but in 
the days and weeks that followed, we 
saw good as well: the first responders 
who raced to the scene and spent the 
weeks after combing through the rub-
ble, the heroic Americans who fought 
back against the terrorists on United 
Flight No. 93, the hours-long lines for 
blood donations as Americans scram-
bled to do anything they could to help. 
And out of the ashes of the World 
Trade Center and the Pentagon and the 
field near Shanksville, PA, came a new 
birth of patriotism and resolve. Amer-
ica might be bloodied, but she would 
not break. Evil and terror would not 
win. 
The 9/11 generation of warriors and 
intelligence personnel took the fight to 
the terrorists in the Middle East and 
around the world. Our men and women 
in uniform dismantled terrorist safe 
havens, 
disrupted 
terrorist 
groups, 
thwarted attacks, and hunted down and 
delivered justice to Osama bin Laden. 
In Afghanistan, the downfall of the 
Taliban at the hands of our soldiers 
and our NATO allies allowed a genera-
tion of Afghans to grow up in freedom. 
I was honored to get to spend part of 
September 11 with members of the 
South Dakota Air National Guard, 
many of whom served overseas in the 
fight against terrorism. 
As we marked the 20th anniversary of 
September 11 on Saturday, our soldiers 
and our veterans should have been able 
to reflect on their successes in the 
fight against terrorism over the past 
two decades, but I know that today 
many of them are struggling with the 
recent events in Afghanistan. 
The U.S. disastrous, hasty with-
drawal is a stain on our Nation’s his-
tory and a betrayal of the men and 
women who fought there. But I hope 
they know that their sacrifices and the 
sacrifices of their comrades were not in 
vain. As I said, their actions enabled a 
generation of Afghans to grow up free 
from 
the 
oppressive 
hand 
of

Taliban and kept the country from 
being a haven for al-Qaida and other 
terrorists. 
Despite the grim current situation in 
Afghanistan, I am convinced that the 
seeds of freedom sown by our military 
men and women will yet bear fruit on 
Afghan soil. 
I and many others warned that a 
total troop withdrawal in Afghanistan 
that ignored conditions on the ground 
was going to be a strategic disaster, 
and it has been. The United States has 
historically maintained a limited mili-
tary presence in foreign countries when 
it is in our national security interest 
to do so. And with the presence of just 
2,500 to 3,000 troops, we were maintain-
ing stability for a country that was 
fighting to find its way toward freedom 
and democracy and simultaneously 
protecting the interests of our own 
country. 
All of that, of course, is now at an 
end. President Biden’s disastrous deci-
sion 
to 
completely 
withdraw 
U.S. 
troops on a timeline he announced to 
our enemies allowed the Taliban to 
bide their time until our ultimate de-
parture. American citizens are still 
trapped in Afghanistan, and thousands 
of Afghans who worked with U.S. 
troops and U.S. intelligence are in 
great danger. 
And Afghanistan is well on its way to 
once again becoming a terrorist haven. 
In fact, the Taliban has already ap-
pointed terrorists to top posts in its 
new government. There is also every 
reason to fear that government oppres-
sion will once again become the norm 
in Afghanistan, particularly—particu-
larly—for women and girls. 
We heard over and over again that 
President Biden was going to restore 
America’s standing in the world and re-
pair our relationships with our allies, 
particularly our NATO allies. In fact, 
he has done the opposite. His Afghani-
stan disaster is a national embarrass-
ment. He failed our troops; he failed 
the American people; he failed our al-
lies; and he failed the Afghans who 
risked their lives with and for us. 
The Parliament of a key U.S. ally, 
the United Kingdom, condemned Presi-
dent Biden in the strongest terms for 
his dishonorable withdrawal from Af-
ghanistan. The fact that we have left 
behind 
thousands 
of 
Afghans 
who 
worked with our country and whom we 
promised to protect is unconscionable. 
It is a stain on our country’s record 
that will not easily be wiped away. 
I hope—I really hope—that the Presi-
dent does everything within his power 
to get Afghans who worked with us and 
any remaining U.S. citizens out of the 
country as soon as humanly possible. 
In the coming weeks, the relevant 
committees in the House and Senate 
need to conduct thorough oversight 
and investigations to understand why 
this withdrawal was done in a manner 
that further empowered and strength-
ened the Taliban and their al-Qaida al-
lies. We also need to discover why 
there was no effective plan to get our 
citizens and our Afghan allies to safe-
ty. 
The scenes of chaos at Hamid Karzai 
Airport should never have happened, 
and we need to find out why they did. 
Thirteen brave Americans died pro-
tecting our withdrawal: 11 marines, 1 
soldier, and 1 sailor. It is hard not to 
wonder if their deaths could have been 
avoided had there been a better plan in 
place for evacuation. The families of 
these men and women and the Amer-
ican people deserve answers, and the 
Biden administration must provide it. 
The weeks of August 2021 will live in 
infamy. The President’s ill-considered, 
untimely 
withdrawal 
and 
complete 
lack of an effective plan to evacuate 
Americans and our Afghan allies cre-
ated a humanitarian crisis and the con-
ditions that allowed the Taliban to 
swiftly take over the country. 
The President’s actions have helped 
condemn women and girls and the en-
tire Afghan people to once again live 
under pre-9/11 oppression, and he has 
emboldened terrorists and increased 
the security risk facing our Nation. 
It is tragic that all the good we have 
done in Afghanistan has come to this. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Alabama. 
HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President, 
sometimes we don’t all agree on things 
here in this Chamber, but I think we 
can all agree that a quality education 
has the power to uplift and transform 
someone’s life. It is the key to freedom 
and the key to opportunity. 
I know this because I have seen it 
firsthand. I have coached and mentored 
hundreds of student athletes over my 
40-year career. I witnessed the dif-
ference an education can make in the 
outcome of someone’s life, how it truly 
creates a pathway to success. 
In fact, that is one of the reasons I 
was inspired to be an advocate for bet-
ter educational opportunities for all 
Americans—because investing in our 
children’s education is investing in our 
country. It is like putting a downpay-
ment on our country’s future success 
by creating opportunity. 
I have recruited hundreds and hun-
dreds of students from across our coun-
try. I have been in their homes. I have 
seen how they live, and I have seen how 
they have grown up. Unfortunately, for 
many children from difficult back-
grounds, a large percent coming from 
one- or no-parent homes, real opportu-
nities can be hard to come by—very 
hard. 
Regardless of what town that they 
lived in or what their family was like, 
I wanted my athletes to know that 
education can open many, many doors. 
Most of them understood and appre-
ciated. As I have said many times be-
fore, the only thing that this country 
owes you as a citizen is an opportunity, 
and I still believe that is true. 
There is a lot that goes into making 
the decision to go to college. Students 
often think first about the cost, or 
they could be the first in their families 
to attend college. My parents didn’t at-
tend college. One worked in manufac-
turing. The other worked on a line. 
They were very supportive of my deci-
sion, but I still had to figure out a lot 
on my own, and it is a huge decision. 
But there is always the question: Is 
this the right place for me? Will this 
school provide me with a path forward 
for success and a productive future? 
Many students across the country 
have turned to historically Black col-
leges and universities, better known as 
HBCUs, to answer these questions be-
cause of the pathway HBCUs provide. 
While they are respected for their 
strong traditions, HBCUs are the ulti-
mate opportunity creators for students 
all across this country. Serving nearly 
300,000 students annually in 21 States 
and territories, HBCUs have made tui-
tion costs more affordable, costing 30 
percent less, on average, than other 
higher education institutions. And be-
cause of that, 60 percent of the HBCU 
attendees are low-income, first-genera-
tion college students. HBCUs not only 
knock down barriers, but they build 
upon the inherent potential of their 
attendees. 
I am proud that the great State of 
Alabama is home to 13 HBCUs, the 
most of any State in the Nation. These 
colleges are major contributors to 
communities across our State, pro-
ducing more than 15,000 jobs annually 
for our local economies. And they also 
prepare students for the 21st-century 
job market. 
Let me tell you a bit about some of 
the great things that HBCUs in my 
State have accomplished. Among their 
many contributions, Alabama HBCUs 
have helped to fill the continuing need 
for more African Americans in STEM— 
or science, technology, engineering, 
and math—professions. For companies 
desperate to recruit top talent for 
entry-level STEM roles, HBCUs offer 
thousands of highly qualified can-
didates. 
As part of this effort, Alabama State 
University offers the Minority Science 
and Engineering Improvement Pro-
gram. This program focuses on giving 
undergrad STEM students a chance at 
hands-on research and professional de-
velopment opportunities. In fact, Ala-
bama State University just announced 
a new partnership with Apple where it 
will become a center for coding and 
creativity. 
In Montgomery, Trenholm State of-
fers free STEM courses for dual enroll-
ment students to allow high school stu-
dents to get a jump start on their col-
lege careers. 
But it is also important to recognize 
that HBCUs support low-income, first- 
generation college students in meeting 
and exceeding their postsecondary edu-
cational goals. 
Alabama A&M University recently 
announced its new master’s apprentice-
ship program for social work—the first 
of its kind by any HBCU in the coun-
try. This investment in our students

and communities will help to ensure 
that we will have more social workers 
to meet the needs of the underserved 
that are in our population. 
Tuskegee University, home of the re-
nowned scientist George Washington 
Carver and the Tuskegee Airmen, leads 
the country in African-American aero-
space 
science 
engineer 
graduates— 
leads the country. 
Oakwood University in Huntsville is 
one of the top universities sending mi-
nority undergraduate students to med-
ical schools. 
And, just this year, the achievements 
of two Stillman College students and 
two Talladega College students were 
recognized by the White House as part 
of the prestigious HBCU Scholars Pro-
gram. 
Traditional 
4-year 
degrees 
aren’t 
suited for everyone. I noticed that in 
my years of coaching. Everybody does 
not need to go to a 4-year university. 
And Alabama HBCUs have a strong tra-
dition of empowering students through 
the vocational and technical programs 
that they offer. 
In as little as 6 months, a student at 
Lawson State Community College in 
Birmingham can launch a career—just 
in 6 months. Their vocational program-
ming 
provides 
low-cost 
and 
fast- 
tracked avenues for students to gain 
subject-matter expertise in industries 
like HVAC work and building construc-
tion. 
Meanwhile, Gadsden State Commu-
nity College is working to make a new 
Advanced Manufacturing Center part 
of its future to help prepare students 
for the roles that the manufacturing 
industry will be filling in the coming 
years. 
Finally, we have repeatedly seen that 
when Alabama HBCUs collaborate with 
local businesses and government agen-
cies, communities thrive, innovation 
occurs, and progress is made. 
Shelton State’s Fire College is re-
sponsible for training paid and volun-
teer firefighters and EMTs. 
Bishop State Community College just 
partnered with Alabama Power to offer 
a 9-week electric line worker training 
program—only 9 weeks. The graduates 
of this new program will be the power 
restoration experts that people rely on 
in times of need, such as a hurricane, 
which we have just gone through sev-
eral in the last few months in the 
South. 
Drake 
State 
created 
a 
satellite 
tracking station in partnership with 
NASA and an amateur radio station 
that serves as FEMA’s relay station 
during local weather watch activities. 
And throughout its history, Miles 
College has had a strong relationship 
with the surrounding community, pro-
moting racial equality for African 
Americans. During the civil rights era, 
President Lucius Pitts helped to nego-
tiate race relations and supported his 
students’ desires to participate in non-
violent protests. 
Overcoming decades of adversity and 
opposition, HBCUs continue to be com-
petitive educational institutions with 
programs for students who want higher 
education, career-tech training, or to 
position themselves for better employ-
ment opportunities. We need to honor 
accomplishments by the HBCUs and 
celebrate their significant contribu-
tions to our society. 
Over the last decade, my colleague 
Senator TIM SCOTT from South Caro-
lina has been focused on doing just 
that. I am thankful to have joined him 
the last month to introduce a resolu-
tion to formally designate the week of 
September 6 as National HBCU Week. 
Because of their work and the work of 
their leaders, these institutions are de-
serving of national recognition. 
Last week, during National HBCU 
Week, there were many tributes about 
the work of these great colleges and 
universities, about the impact they 
have made in the lives of so many peo-
ple across this country and the impact 
they have made on many, many lives. 
While this week was a chance to rec-
ognize the many ways HBCUs con-
tribute to our society, our recognition 
shouldn’t stop at one week. We should 
honor their work by continuing the 
conversation for how we can support 
these institutions for years and years 
to come. 
HBCUs have given a gift—a gift of 
education and an opportunity—to so 
many in Alabama and across our Na-
tion. I hope my colleagues join me and 
Senator SCOTT in recognizing their tre-
mendous, tremendous impact on a lot 
of young lives of people all across our 
country.

ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that I, along with 
Senator MORAN and Senator MURRAY, 
be permitted to complete our remarks 
before the scheduled rollcall vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about the crisis in 
Afghanistan and to honor the distin-
guished service of those who gave the 
last full measure of their devotion pro-
tecting Americans there. 
For the last month, Americans have 
watched, horrified, at the scenes of 
chaos and terror and bloodshed: Ameri-
cans trapped at the Kabul Airport, ter-
rified as the enemy closed in; innocent 
civilians fleeing for their lives, aban-
doned by their government; a young 
man desperately clinging to a depart-
ing plane’s landing gear, he was so des-
perate to escape, only to fall then to 
his tragic death; 13 marines, the pride 
of our Nation, cut down by terrorists, 
never to see home again; and, then, as 
American planes finally departed, hun-
dreds of American civilians left behind 
to the enemy. 
Let me say that again: hundreds of 
American civilians left behind to the 
enemy. 
And after all of that, who can forget 
the image of the President of the 
United States, declaring this mission 
that he planned, that he executed, that 
he oversaw—this mission that left 13 
marines dead, that left hundreds of 
American civilians behind enemy lines; 
this mission that resulted in chaos and 
terror and bloodshed—who can forget 
this President saying that this mission 
was, and I quote, ‘‘extraordinarily suc-
cessful’’? 
An 
extraordinary 
success—really? 
Has a Commander in Chief in American 
history ever before uttered words like 
that? Has a Commander in Chief ever 
celebrated as ‘‘successful’’—‘‘success-
ful’’—the abandonment of American ci-
vilians to an enemy, the death of 
American soldiers, terrorizing of Amer-
ican citizens and American allies? 
I hope I will not live to ever hear 
again in my lifetime such shameful and 
disgraceful words from a President of 
the United States. 
And make no mistake, this President 
is a disgrace. His behavior is disgrace-
ful. He has dishonored this country 
with his shameful leadership in this 
crisis, and it is time for him to resign. 
And if he had the responsibility of lead-
ership, he would resign for the crisis 
that he has himself led this Nation into 
and the responsibility he bears for the 
lives that have been lost and for the 
American citizens who are, even now as 
I speak, trapped in Afghanistan, left to 
the enemy because of his failures and 
his shameful, disgraceful leadership. 
Even the shameful performance of 
America’s leaders cannot disguise or 
cover over the heroism of America’s 
soldiers, and I want to talk about one 
of those soldiers now. He was Marine 
Corps LCpl Jared Schmitz. He was from 
Missouri. 
He was from Wentzville, in St. 
Charles County, to be exact, and he had 
wanted to be a marine since he was a 
teenager. Lance Corporal Schmitz was 
only 6 months old when terrorists at-
tacked this country on September 11, 
2001. He wasn’t old enough to remem-
ber the beginnings of this long war in 
which he would go on to so valiantly 
serve. He had only graduated from high 
school, from Fort Zumwalt South High 
School, in 2019. 
Jared signed up to join the Marines 
shortly before his 18th birthday. He had 
dreamed of it since before his sopho-
more year. He began training with re-
cruits even before he enlisted. He want-
ed to serve this Nation because he was 
a man who served others. His father 
said Jared was always smiling nonstop. 
He brought light and hope to every 
place he went, and he wanted to bring 
those gifts and service to his country— 
and he did. 
He was a fine marine. He was sent on 
his first deployment to Jordan earlier 
this year and then received orders to 
Afghanistan. Jared Schmitz, Lance 
Corporal Schmitz, was there on August 
26—there at the Kabul airport, doing 
his duty, serving his country, smiling 
nonstop when the enemy attacked. And 
it was there that Lance Corporal 
Schmitz, age 20, gave his life for the

people he loved and for the Nation he 
served. He died so that others might 
live. 
I had the privilege of speaking to 
Lance Corporal Schmitz’s family just 
hours after we learned of Jared’s death. 
I said this to them, and I promised that 
I would say it for the whole Nation: 
that Jared Schmitz lived a life of 
honor, he lived a life worth living, and 
his sacrifice was not in vain. 
Jared didn’t have to serve. He didn’t 
have to deploy halfway around the 
world. He didn’t have to stand pro-
tecting Americans and other innocent 
people as disaster unfolded. He didn’t 
have to do any of it. He chose to do it. 
He chose to serve. He chose to give his 
life for others. That is a hero. That is 
an American. 
Lance Corporal Schmitz deserves this 
honor. He deserves this recognition. 
Frankly, it is the least of what he de-
serves. And so, today, I am introducing 
in this body a resolution to honor 
Lance Corporal Schmitz and all the 
Missourians who made the ultimate 
sacrifice during the war in Afghani-
stan. They will not be forgotten. 
Over the last 20 years, we have often 
heard numbers used to describe the 
costs of this long war: $2 trillion spent, 
over 20,000 soldiers wounded in action 
and thousands more who came home 
with invisible wounds, and 2,461 Amer-
ican personnel who gave their very 
lives. But each of these numbers was a 
son, a daughter, a husband, or wife, or 
father, or friend. They have names. 
They have lives. And they deserve to be 
honored. 
As this chapter of American history 
concludes, I want to recognize in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD each of my fel-
low Missourians who, during the war in 
Afghanistan, made the ultimate sac-
rifice serving this Nation. I ask that 
each of us reflect together and pray to-
gether for each one of the fallen, and 
also their families who have sacrificed 
so much, who have sacrificed all they 
have to sacrifice. These men and 
women will live in our hearts and in 
the memory of this Nation.

Mr. President, the sacrifices of so 
many brave men and women demand 
that we in Congress bring all the facts 
of this long war to light. These sac-
rifices demand that we in Congress 
prioritize transparency and full ac-
countability. And these sacrifices de-
mand that we hold responsible those 
who bear the blame for the failure of 
the last month and of all the months 
that preceded it. 
For 20 years, our soldiers who fought 
in Afghanistan did what we sent them 
there to do. They went after al-Qaida, 
killed Osama bin Laden, and prevented 
terrorists from using Afghanistan as a 
base for attacking our homeland. They 
did their duty, and they did it honor-
ably. 
But by now it is abundantly clear 
President Biden has not done his. 
President Biden turned an orderly 
evacuation into a disaster; that much 
is painfully clear. 
First, Joe Biden pulled our troops 
out; then he sent thousands back in. He 
failed to protect Americans still in the 
country. He failed to account for lethal 
American military equipment he left 
behind. He failed to anticipate wors-
ening conditions on the ground. He 
failed in his judgment that the Afghan 
security forces would hold their own 
when our own intelligence estimates 
said that they wouldn’t. He failed to 
anticipate a new offensive by the 
Taliban. He failed again and again and 
again until American blood at the 
Kabul airport paid the price for that 
failure. Then he celebrated it as an 
‘‘extraordinary success.’’ 
Joe Biden’s team is responsible too. 
Men like Secretary Austin; Secretary 
Blinken; Jake Sullivan, the National 
Security Adviser, they overestimated 
the Afghan security forces’ willingness 
to hold the line; and instead of plan-
ning for the worst, they planned for the 
best. Because of them, we have Ameri-
cans stranded behind enemy lines and 
over 100,000 Afghan refugees arriving 
now to this country at this eleventh 
hour without vetting or precautions. 
This was never necessary. It did not 
have to be this way and it shouldn’t 
have been. Joe Biden is responsible for 
today’s failure and now there must be 
accountability. Instead, the President’s 
team is even now coming to Capitol 
Hill and blaming others, shirking re-
sponsibility. That is cowardly. 
I, for one, am not willing to look the 
other way. Let me be clear. I will not 
consent to the nomination of any 
nominee for the Department of Defense 
or for the Department of State until 
Secretary 
Austin 
and 
Secretary 
Blinken and Jake Sullivan resign. 
Leaders take responsibility for their 
failures. And the failure of these indi-
viduals, the failure of this administra-
tion has cost Americans their lives and 
has left American civilians to the 
enemy. There must be accountability 
and there must be a new start. 
I believe that a century from now, 
when the history of this long war is 
written by our children’s children, they 
will note the heroism and the honor of 
our soldiers and veterans who, in the 
aftermath of the worst attacks on our 
Nation’s soil in a century, stood stead-
fast and resolute in unity; and who, de-
spite the grave mistakes of their lead-
ers over many years, served their coun-
try with bravery and distinction and 
defense of our freedom. 
The great Winston Churchill, who 
was himself the veteran of one war and 
leader of another, said this almost 70 
years ago: 
We have surmounted all the perils and en-
dured all the agonies of the past. We shall 
provide against and thus prevail over the 
dangers and the problems of the future, with-
hold no sacrifice, grudge no toil, seek no sor-
did gain, fear no foe. All will be well. We 
have, I believe, within us the life-strength 
and guiding light by which the tormented 
world around us may find the harbour of 
safety, after a storm-beaten voyage. 
Mr. President, I believe, as Ameri-
cans, we have that life-strength. I be-
lieve we have in us the light and the 
hope to survive this troubled time and 
to provide the world around us the har-
bor of safety after a storm-beaten voy-
age. 
God bless our troops. 
I yield floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, I join the 
Senator from Missouri and his col-
league, Senator BLUNT, expressing my 
condolences and concern for the family 
of Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz from 
the great State of Missouri and others 
who died at the Kabul airport in the ef-
fort to free Americans and Afghans 
who helped Americans from their coun-
try and from their deaths. 
It takes us back to this weekend, 
Saturday, September 11. Our Nation re-
membered the horrific attacks that oc-
curred 20 years previous and reflected 
upon the fight against terrorism, which 
was set in motion on that very fateful 
day. 
The events that unfolded in Afghani-
stan these past few weeks have made 
the 20th anniversary of September 11 
that much more painful; painful espe-
cially for the men and women who 
served our Nation in Afghanistan. 
The chaos and collapse of that coun-
try cost American lives, opened old 
wounds, and left many Americans ques-
tioning how all this could happen in 
this manner. 
The American people require answers 
from the administration on how our 
withdrawal from Afghanistan went so 
horribly—so horribly, horribly wrong.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6471 
September 14, 2021 
Officials should be, must be, held ac-
countable for their weak leadership 
and mismanaged withdrawal. 
During my tenure in the U.S. House 
of Representatives and here in the U.S. 
Senate, following the attack of 9/11, I 
visited Afghanistan four times. Over 
the course of those visits, I saw 
progress being made by our troops and 
by civilians, by our NATO allies, and 
by Afghan partners. 
My last visit was about 4 years ago 
just to the day about a week ago. At 
that time, the U.S. had less than 15,000 
servicemembers in Afghanistan and our 
men and women were operating as ad-
visers to the Afghan military. For the 
most part, the war seemed to be being 
fought by the Afghan military. Cer-
tainly, several terrorist groups had a 
presence in the region, but our mili-
tary was preventing them from gaining 
the ability to strike our homeland. 
President Biden’s withdrawal plan, if 
it could be called that, led to the dead-
liest day for American servicemembers 
in Afghanistan since 2011. Thirteen of 
our servicemembers returned home in 
flag-draped caskets. Most of them were 
too young to remember 9/11, yet they 
laid down our lives to help Americans 
and Afghans flee the Taliban and find 
safety. 
Americans remain in Afghanistan 
and thousands of our Afghan partners 
who are likely to face persecution or 
death at the hands of the Taliban have 
little hope of escaping the country. Our 
own office continues the effort to try 
to find and help those individuals re-
move themselves from a country where 
death seems certain. 
I thank my staff, and I pray for those 
people, and I thank the Kansans who 
brought them to our attention. 
People at home worried about Chris-
tians being persecuted for being Chris-
tians in Afghanistan. Those who serve 
in Afghanistan worried about someone 
who saved their life—an Afghan who 
saved their life or who was their inter-
preter or who was there side by side 
with them—now being left to the fate 
of the Taliban. 
I am a member of the Senate Appro-
priations Subcommittees that fund the 
Departments of Defense and State. We 
must hold hearings to examine the 
President’s 
decision-making 
process 
and his consideration of the advice pro-
vided by his military and intelligence 
community leaders. We need to deter-
mine what steps, if any, were taken to 
plan for the withdrawal of Americans, 
with Special Immigrant Visas holders 
from Afghanistan. 
We also need to hear directly from 
the administration how costly the le-
thal American weapons ended up in the 
hands of Taliban. The high-ranking of-
ficials who were responsible for this 
failure must answer to the American 
people why this operation failed so 
spectacularly and why their taxpayer 
dollars were left behind for the Taliban 
in the form of helicopters, combat ve-
hicles, and weapons. 
How is it that we came to rely upon 
the Taliban to help those we are re-
sponsible for, we owe a debt to, to be 
able to escape from the Taliban? 
The administration must also be held 
accountable for its mismanagement 
and for the precarious security situa-
tion that this incompetent withdrawal 
created. Hastily withdrawing thou-
sands of troops, apparently in the in-
terest of a symbolic departure before 
the 20th anniversary of 9/11, made this 
world a more dangerous place. It cre-
ated an environment that will allow 
radical terrorists to find refuge under 
the Taliban rule, and produced one 
that was the most pressing humani-
tarian crisis in history. 
We deserve answers on how we will 
remedy this complex security situa-
tion, how we will help Afghan women 
and girls who are already being per-
secuted, and how we will learn from 
mistakes that were made to make cer-
tain it cannot happen again. 
Finally, our veterans who served 
honorably in Afghanistan need to know 
that their service—and when I say ‘‘fi-
nally,’’ this is not the least important 
point. It is made at the end to make 
the point so clear. Our veterans who 
served honorably in Afghanistan need 
to know that their service was not— 
was not—in vain. More than 775,000 
servicemembers were deployed to Af-
ghanistan over the two decades since 9/ 
11. 
To those servicemembers: Make no 
mistake, your service has left a lasting 
and unparalleled impact upon the 
world. 
Our country has been safe from a ter-
rorist attack from the region of Af-
ghanistan since their arrival in Af-
ghanistan. Their work and efforts, 
their sacrifice and service made a dif-
ference for the safety of their fellow 
Americans. Those who served signifi-
cantly reduced the threat from al- 
Qaida and brought Osama bin Laden to 
justice. 
You deserve to know that the col-
lapse of Afghanistan does not fall on 
your shoulders but on the failure of 
leadership here in the Nation’s Capital 
City. Our sudden, disastrous, and poor-
ly executed withdrawal opened old 
wounds and created new ones. 
I commit as the ranking Republican 
on the Senate Committee on Veterans’ 
Affairs to work side by side with our 
chairman, the Senator from Montana, 
to make certain that our veterans re-
ceive the care and attention they de-
serve and are entitled to, the respect 
and honor from their fellow American 
citizens, and the benefits that we 
promised to be available, available. 
We have made the world a more dan-
gerous place by our failing departure, 
and we have left Americans and our Af-
ghan partners behind. 
I served in the House of Representa-
tives on 9/11, 20 years ago. I remember 
the day and the attack. I was one of 
the first Members of Congress to visit 
Ground Zero, where I saw the remains 
of the two Twin Towers—still smoke 
coming from the ground, steam—a bit 
like a construction site as they were 
trying to remove the rubble that were 
the remains of those towers. 
First, family members were brought 
in to see the site where their loved 
ones died, which captured my heart as 
I watched them see where their loved 
ones died. After paying my respects to 
those family members and as I was 
leaving, I found a makeshift memorial 
that New Yorkers had placed there. It 
was a series of long tables at which 
people had brought flowers and cards, 
stuffed 
animals—teddy 
bears—and 
notes to pay tribute to those who had 
died just a few weeks before at that lo-
cation. 
I picked up one thing from that table 
of remembrance and honor and respect. 
It was a piece of notebook paper with a 
jagged edge along the side, torn out of 
a spiral notebook, with a child’s hand-
writing: 
Dear Daddy, how much I love you, how I 
hope Heaven is a wonderful place, and I hope, 
Daddy, that I live a life good enough to join 
you there someday. 
Amanda, aged 12. 
That moment has stuck with me for 
20-plus years now—the point being that 
we have a responsibility to make sure 
that there are no more Amandas who 
suffer the fate that this young girl suf-
fered that day with the death of her fa-
ther. It occurred because of a terrorist 
attack occurring on the lands of Af-
ghanistan, held by the Taliban, that al-
lowed ISIS to attack the United States 
of America. 
I have tried to change my conduct as 
a Member of Congress, since that day, 
to be a more responsible Member, to do 
the things necessary to be more world-
ly and understand what is going on, to 
make sure that I make the decisions 
that help make the world a safer place. 
What we have seen in the last few 
weeks discourages me in making the 
world a safer place, but I rise to the 
call again to say we have responsibil-
ities left in Afghanistan; we have re-
sponsibilities to the people we left be-
hind to allow and to help them escape 
near certain death; and we also have 
responsibilities 
to 
those 
men 
and 
women who served in Afghanistan, who 
answered the call because they saw 
what happened to our Nation on 9/11 
and said: I have something to give. I 
have something—perhaps my life—to 
give to see that this doesn’t happen 
again. 
I hope that we, despite the cir-
cumstances that we have seen in the 
last days, now have the ability as a 
U.S. Congress, as a Member of the U.S. 
Senate, to rise to the occasion in which 
we are still needed in this world to pro-
tect American lives, to save lives in Af-
ghanistan, and to make certain—to 
make certain—that there are no more 
Amandas asking for the opportunity to 
see their fathers someday in Heaven. 
The burdens are great for us. The re-
sponsibilities are real. Those who have 
failed us to date need to be held ac-
countable, and the rest of us need to 
rise to the occasion to protect this 
country we love, the United States of 
America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6472 
September 14, 2021 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
LUJ´AN). The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are 
about to take two votes, and I will 
speak on both of them for just a few 
minutes. 
NOMINATION OF JAMES RICHARD KVAAL 
Mr. President, right now, many stu-
dents in higher education across the 
country are back on campus for the 
start of a new school year, and al-
though I know many of them are ex-
cited to finally be able to return to 
their classrooms and their friends, 
there are still many challenges in high-
er education we need to tackle imme-
diately, including keeping our students 
safe and healthy as the COVID–19 crisis 
continues. 
We also cannot lose sight of the fact 
that student debt is at a historic high 
as borrowers across our country are 
drowning in student debt. The cost of 
higher education continues to rise, 
forcing students to give up on higher 
education dreams simply because they 
can’t afford it. Predatory for-profit col-
leges continue to target first-genera-
tion students, students of color, and 
our veterans. Across the country, cam-
pus sexual assault, harassment, and 
discrimination, and systemic racism 
leave too many students feeling unsafe 
in their own school communities. 
Students across our country deserve 
leaders who are committed to address-
ing these urgent problems and who will 
work to always put students and bor-
rowers first. I believe James Kvaal is 
exactly that kind of leader, and I urge 
my colleagues to join me in supporting 
his nomination to serve as Under Sec-
retary of Education. Mr. Kvaal’s back-
ground reflects a deep commitment to 
our Nation’s students and the experi-
ence needed to hit the ground running 
on day one. 
As president of the Institute for Col-
lege Access and Success, Mr. Kvaal 
fought to improve student outcomes 
and quality, reform Federal and State 
financial aid, support student loan bor-
rowers, and increase State and Federal 
investments in higher education. He 
also has a long record in public service, 
including as Deputy Under Secretary of 
Education and as Deputy Director of 
the Domestic Policy Council in the 
Obama 
administration, 
where 
he 
helped 
strengthen 
college 
account-
ability, expand investments in Pell 
grants, and worked to ensure students 
had critical information about the out-
comes of the colleges and universities 
they might attend. 
To me, it is a clear vote to confirm 
Mr. Kvaal. It is a vote to support our 
students and borrowers and to help 
build a stronger, more equitable higher 
education system. 
NOMINATION OF DAVID G. ESTUDILLO 
Mr. President, the second vote we 
will take is on Judge Estudillo’s con-
firmation, and I rise today in support 
of the nomination of Judge David 
Estudillo to serve as U.S. District 
Court judge for the Western District of 
Washington in the Tacoma courthouse. 
I had the honor of recommending 
that President Biden nominate Judge 
Estudillo for this position, and I am so 
glad he did. Judge Estudillo is tremen-
dously qualified for this job, currently 
serving in his third term as a Grant 
County Superior Court judge, and he is 
someone who will bring a powerful and 
important perspective to the Federal 
bench. 
Let me tell you a little bit about him 
and the kind of person he is. He was 
born and raised in the Yakima Valley 
of Washington State. Judge Estudillo 
is the son of immigrants—the 9th child 
of 10—his parents coming here from 
Mexico through the Bracero Program. 
His mother and father were farm-
workers until they were able to open 
up a small grocery store, where Judge 
Estudillo worked while growing up and 
through college. 
He is someone who worked hard to 
give back to his community in working 
as an immigration lawyer. He rep-
resented clients in tough removal pro-
ceedings, successfully presenting and 
trying claims for asylum, cancelations 
of removal, and other forms of relief 
from deportation. He also consistently 
provided pro bono services at immigra-
tion legal clinics to help immigrants 
applying for citizenship and often pre-
sented information in Spanish about 
immigration policy and procedure all 
around the community. 
That work as an immigration attor-
ney is important to me because it 
means, when Judge Estudillo is in the 
Tacoma courthouse and Washington 
State families look up to the judge’s 
bench—who maybe don’t speak English 
or just aren’t familiar with our court 
system—Judge Estudillo is someone 
who will make sure that every person 
who walks into his courtroom feels 
heard and that every person who walks 
out believes equal justice under the law 
is real in America. 
Don’t just take my word for it. The 
judge is endorsed by both the Repub-
lican and Democratic Parties of Grant 
County, where he first ran for his cur-
rent post, and he was recommended to 
me by my Judicial Merit Selection 
Committee, which has both Republican 
and 
Democratic 
members. 
He 
has 
earned an outstanding reputation for 
leading a courtroom where everyone is 
treated with respect and dignity. 
If we want people in this country to 
have faith in our Federal courts—an 
absolutely vital part of our democ-
racy’s checks and balance system— 
then we need to appoint judges who 
will serve with integrity and independ-
ence and who will reflect the commu-
nities 
they 
serve. 
I 
know 
Judge 
Estudillo will do exactly that. He will 
be an exceptional Federal district 
court judge for the Western District of 
Washington, and I urge my colleagues 
to join me in supporting his nomina-
tion. 
I yield the floor.

NOMINATION OF DAVID G. ESTUDILLO 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
come to the floor this afternoon to sup-
port the nomination of David Estudillo 
to serve as district court judge for the 
U.S. District Court for the Western 
District of Washington. 
I am pleased to join my colleague 
Senator MURRAY in supporting Judge 
Estudillo, who was voted out of the 
Senate Judiciary Committee on a bi-
partisan basis, and I certainly appre-
ciate the support of both the chairman 
and the ranking member on this nomi-
nation. 
Mr. Estudillo is the son of Mexican 
immigrants who came to the Yakima 
Valley as part of the Bracero Program 
in the 1960s. 
Growing up, he learned and embraced 
both the culture of his parents and that 
of the United States. Judge Estudillo is 
a great example of the successes and 
contributions many immigrant fami-
lies make to our great Nation. 
Judge Estudillo earned an associate 
of arts degree from Columbia Basin 
Community College and his bachelor of 
arts degree and juris doctorate from 
the University of Washington. 
After graduating from law school, 
Judge Estudillo practiced general and 
civil litigation and immigration law in 
Moses Lake and Seattle and tried cases 
in both Seattle and Tacoma immigra-
tion courts. He is well experienced in 
many issues of the law. 
He was appointed to the Grant Coun-
ty Superior Court in 2015 and was the 
only Latino judge in any Eastern 
Washington 
State 
court. 
Judge 
Estudillo received bipartisan support, 
with endorsements from both Demo-
cratic and Republican local officials 
and support from all nine of Wash-
ington State Supreme Court justices. 
He has earned the respect and the 
support of his community. To quote a 
letter that was sent to the Judiciary 
Committee from Mayor David Curnel 
of Moses Lake, WA, he said Judge 
Estudillo ‘‘is a respected member of 
our community. He is involved in our 
community. He is committed to our 
community. This is what I understand 
about Judge Estudillo and why I can 
recommend him highly for a Federal 
judge position.’’ 
In short, Judge Estudillo is a well- 
qualified jurist, and he has dedicated 
his entire legal career to practicing 
and supporting his community. I am 
pleased to have recommended him 
along with my colleague Senator MUR-
RAY to the President. I know his strong 
character and respect for the rule of 
law, a sense of justice, fairness, humil-
ity, empathy, and capacity for compas-
sion and understanding would be a ben-
efit to the court and all the parties 
concerned. 
I urge my colleagues to support 
Judge Estudillo’s nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant bill clerk pro-
ceeded to call the roll. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Estudillo nomination?

There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT DARIN TAYLOR 
HOOVER, JR. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the 
United States lost 13 servicemembers 
in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021. The 
heroic service and the ultimate sac-
rifice of these men and women will 
never be forgotten. They are Marine 
LCpl David L. Espinoza from Texas, 
Marine Sgt Nicole L. Gee from Cali-
fornia, Marine SSgt Darin Taylor Hoo-
ver from Utah, Army SSG Ryan C. 
Knauss from Tennessee, Marine Cpl 
Hunter Lopez from California, Marine 
LCpl Rylee J. McCollum from Wyo-
ming, Marine LCpl Dylan R. Merola 
from California, Marine LCpl Kareem 
M. Nikoui from California, Marine Sgt 
Johanny Rosario Pichardo from Massa-
chusetts, Marine Cpl Humberto A. San-
chez from Indiana, Marine LCpl Jared 
M. Schmitz from Missouri, Navy Hos-
pital Corpsman Maxton W. Soviak from 
Ohio, and Marine Cpl Daegan W. Page 
from Nebraska. Over the next hour, 
Senators representing many of these 
fallen servicemembers and the States 
from which they hail will honor their 
service and their memory. 
Utah’s SSgt Darin Taylor Hoover was 
only 11 years old on September 11, 2001. 
From that moment on, he knew that 
he wanted to serve his country. Nearly 
21 years later, he was killed in Kabul, 
Afghanistan, performing his duty val-
iantly, as always, as a U.S. marine. 
Staff Sergeant Hoover and his fellow 
marines were on the frontlines of the 
operation, securing an entrance to the 
Hamid Karzai International Airport 
and screening vulnerable Afghans on 
their escape to safety as the extremist 
Taliban took hold of their country. 
Staff Sergeant Hoover was killed by 
an ISIS-K suicide attack that targeted 
him, his teammates, and the sur-
rounding innocent civilians. 
Staff Sergeant Hoover, like all ma-
rines, learned the Marine Corps’ values 
at boot camp. Those values are honor, 
courage, and commitment. He was told 
that being a marine and living these 
values does not begin or end with 
training or service as an Active-Duty 
marine; these values forever guide ma-
rines’ decisions, their service, and, in 
fact, their entire lives. 
Staff Sergeant Hoover lived these 
values throughout his entire life. You 
see, Staff Sergeant Hoover did, always, 
what he said he would do. He was hon-
est, respectful, caring, and compas-
sionate. He dedicated his life to the 
service of others, in and out of uni-
form. He wanted to be the best and to 
provide the very best for others, and he 
was always willing to work hard to 
make that happen. 
His friends and his family knew him 
as a loving, thoughtful, hard-working 
man. He loved and was dedicated to 
serving those around him, his family, 
and his country. As a young man, he 
made a lasting impression on those 
who knew him. They described him 
as—and these are their words, not 
mine—‘‘the best friend,’’ ‘‘selfless,’’ 
‘‘always levelheaded,’’ ‘‘hard-working,’’ 
‘‘a teammate you could count on,’’ ‘‘a 
born leader,’’ and as ‘‘a good, kind per-
son.’’ By being the type of man he was, 
he honored those who knew him. He 
honored the uniform he wore. And in 
his service and sacrifice, he honored 
the United States by representing and 
being the best of us. 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Hoover 
certainly 
knew the risks of his duty. He under-
stood the risks of this deployment in 
particular. In particular, he knew what 
was at stake and on the line on this 
particular day. 
American civilians had been warned 
not to travel to the airport due to spe-
cific credible threats of an attack. The 
marines at the gate did not, of course, 
have the option of standing down or 
shirking their duty; they had a mission 
to complete. Despite knowing the very 
real threat to their lives that day, 
Staff Sergeant Hoover and his marines 
followed orders and did their duty. 
They stood in close physical proximity 
with hundreds as they checked identi-
fication and shuffled people through 
the gate one after the other. They 
didn’t know if or ultimately when an

September 14, 2021 
attack might come; they just knew of 
the threat. Nonetheless, those marines 
carried on, guiding countless innocent 
civilians to safety. 
His father Darin put it best. He said: 
That’s just the type of man that he was, 
doing what he needed to do and getting the 
job done for those that couldn’t do it for 
themselves, and he was standing out front 
leading his men. 
You see, Staff Sergeant Hoover dem-
onstrated uncommon courage in ful-
filling his duty that day, as with all 
other days in which he valiantly 
served. 
This was not Mr. Hoover’s first de-
ployment to Afghanistan. In fact, he 
served three tours of duty there in his 
11 years in the Marine Corps. He knew 
what war and Afghanistan were like. 
He decided to carry on and continue 
serving because that is what he had 
committed to do. Since high school, he 
knew he wanted to be a marine specifi-
cally. His father said that ‘‘he was dead 
set on it.’’ 
When the news in Afghanistan devel-
oped, Staff Sergeant Hoover told his 
family he wanted to be in the action to 
help with the evacuation mission. He 
died doing what he loved: serving his 
country and leading his men. 
Staff Sergeant Hoover was the oldest 
of the 13 servicemembers killed in this 
attack. His life had been defined by his 
love of family and of country. He was 
committed to serving, and he lived and 
gave his life, showing the last full 
measure of devotion, demonstrating ex-
actly what it means to be a U.S. ma-
rine. 
Staff Sergeant Hoover leaves a leg-
acy with his family, the State of Utah, 
and our Nation. He represents the best 
among us and the commitment of a 
servicemember and a marine. His dedi-
cation to the values of the Marine 
Corps and full-fledged devotion to what 
is right will remain with us forever. He 
will never be forgotten. 
As the preparations are made to inter 
him along with other American heroes 
at Arlington National Cemetery, he 
can behold what the Marine Corps 
hymn promises and millions of good 
marines before him have seen: On 
Heaven’s scenes, you will find the 
streets are guarded by United States 
marines. 
Staff Sergeant Taylor Hoover joined 
the ranks of American heroes before 
him, always faithful. May God rest his 
soul, may God comfort his family, and 
may God bless us with the honor, cour-
age, and commitment that Taylor Hoo-
ver truly lived.

ator from Nebraska. 
HONORING CORPORAL DAEGAN WILLIAM-TYELER 
PAGE 
Mrs. FISCHER. Madam President, 
last Friday, I joined Nebraskans to 
honor the dignified return of Cpl 
Daegan William-Tyeler Page of the 
U.S. Marine Corps, one of 13 service-
members killed in the terrorist attack 
at the Kabul airport. It was heart-
breaking, but to see the thousands of 
people who lined the streets of Omaha 
between Eppley Airfield and Braman 
Mortuary was truly amazing. The out-
pouring of honor by the community 
during the procession was a solemn dis-
play of Nebraskans’ love for one an-
other and for this country. Nebraskans 
showed their gratitude for Corporal 
Page’s service and offered support to 
his grieving family. 
Corporal Page was only 23 years old 
when his life was needlessly cut short 
in Kabul. He was born in Iowa, but his 
family moved to Nebraska when he was 
5. 
He was a proud U.S. marine. He en-
listed shortly after graduating from 
Millard South High School in Omaha. 
He was stationed in Pendleton, CA, but 
multiple deployments took him all 
around the world, to Japan, South 
Korea, Australia, Jordan, and Afghani-
stan. 
After he finished his service, he 
planned to attend trade school in Ne-
braska, hoping to eventually become a 
lineman. 
Corporal Page was also a beloved son, 
brother, grandson, and friend. He was 
especially adored by his younger sib-
lings. To them, his family said, he was 
not just a hero in the Marines; he was 
their real-life hero, too. 
And he had a soft spot in his heart 
for animals, most of all his three dogs. 
He loved hockey. He played on a 
State champion club team in high 
school, Omaha Westside. And he was a 
diehard fan of the Chicago Blackhawks. 
He was a member of Boy Scout Troop 
331, where he gained an appreciation 
for the outdoors and of St. Paul’s Lu-
theran Church in Millard. 
Hunting and being outside with his 
dad were among his favorite ways to 
spend his time, but he was also an avid 
skateboarder, amateur photographer, 
and an excellent sketch artist. 
His family has asked Americans to 
remember him for his ‘‘fun-loving spir-
it, tough outer shell, and [his] giant 
heart.’’ 
Corporal Page’s dignified return to 
Omaha came just 1 day before the 20th 
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, which 
brought us to Afghanistan in the first 
place. He was just 3 years old on Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and his death came at 
the very end of a war that had lasted 
nearly his entire lifetime. 
We are also going to hear this after-
noon about the other servicemembers 
who lost their lives in Kabul on August 
26. Like Corporal Page, most of these 
men and women had their whole lives 
ahead of them. Like Corporal Page, 
most of them were probably too young 
to have any memory of the event that 
took us to the country where they gave 
their lives. His sacrifice and that of 
these 12 other servicemembers must 
not be in vain. It is now up to us, both 
here in Congress and in our daily lives 
across this country, to live up to the 
lofty example that is set by their self-
lessness. 
I ask that we remember him and his 
family in our prayers and that he rest 
in peace. 
I yield the floor.

HONORING STAFF SERGEANT TAYLOR HOOVER 
Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, this 
past weekend, we gathered to reflect on 
the anniversary of a national tragedy. 
The visible and invisible wounds in-
curred on that day continue to impact 
the lives of all of us. 
In the last two decades since 9/11, our 
Nation has demonstrated enormous re-
silience, imponderable sacrifice, and 
pursued justice in dangerous lands, 
often under perilous conditions. We 
have asked our servicemembers to do 
so very much to keep us safe, and they 
have responded with uncommon cour-
age. Last month, 13 of our Nation’s fin-
est upheld their sacred oath at the cost 
of their lives. 
They were struck down by the cow-
ardice of terrorists while, at the same 
time, they were helping innocent Af-
ghan civilians reach a better life. Over 
100 Afghan civilians were also killed on 
August 26 in that terrorist attack at 
the Kabul airport, and many more were 
grievously wounded. We also hold in 
our hearts the American servicemem-
bers who suffered those terrible inju-
ries that day. 
On September 11, 2001, Taylor Hoo-
ver, from Sandy, UT, was just 11 years 
old. Nine years later, he was a staff ser-
geant in the Marine Corps. He would go 
on to serve three tours of duty in Af-
ghanistan and earned both the respect 
of his fellow soldiers abroad and the ad-
miration of those who knew him well 
and loved him here at home. 
As we recently gathered in Salt Lake 
City to mourn the life of Staff Ser-
geant Hoover, it was clear that this 
deep admiration was shared by thou-
sands of the people of Utah. While our 
hearts were heavy with grief as his 
family shared their memories of Staff 
Sergeant Hoover, they were embraced 
by the crowd one by one as the cere-
mony concluded, and our communal 
bonds emerged ever stronger. 
TRIBUTE TO CORPORAL WYATT WILSON 
Madam 
President, 
another 
brave 
Utahn also risked his life and sustained 
life-threatening 
injury 
while 
sup-
porting the evacuation operations at 
the Kabul airport that day. Our Nation 
thanks you, Cpl Wyatt Wilson, and we 
pray for your complete and speedy re-
covery. You and your brothers and sis-
ters in arms have answered the call to 
serve with valor and devotion, and 
your service rendered continues to pro-
tect us to this day. 
Let us carry forward these shared 
values and reflections on sacrifice in 
our 
daily 
lives 
and 
endeavor 
to 
strengthen our national bonds of unity. 
May God bless our Nation’s fallen 
and our wounded, and may He bless 
also their families and all the service-
members who are today in harm’s way. 
We are indebted to those known for 
their bravery, sacrifice, and heroism. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio.

HONORING HOSPITAL CORPSMAN THIRD CLASS 
MAXTON SOVIAK 
Mr. PORTMAN. Madam President, I 
am here today on the floor to remem-
ber the life of Navy Fleet Marine Force 
Hospital Corpsman Third Class Maxton 
Soviak. Max was a 22-year-old native of 
Berlin Heights, OH, a young patriot 
who died far too soon in service to all 
of us. 
Max was one of 13 brave American 
service men and women who were trag-
ically killed when an ISIS-K suicide 
bomber in Kabul on August 26 exploded 
a bomb that wounded dozens of others 
and killed many Afghans. He was there 
working to evacuate Americans and Af-
ghan allies from a city that was sud-
denly overrun by the Taliban. 
Max was a special guy. They say he 
was quick to make friends and quick to 
earn the respect of those he interacted 
with. As a student at Edison High 
School, Max was a member of the wres-
tling team that won the 2016 State 
championship and a football team that 
made it to the semifinals 2 years in a 
row. He was an athlete and a leader. He 
achieved the rank of Life Scout, the 
second highest rank a scout can reach. 
He was a lover of the outdoors, spend-
ing his free time doing rock climbing, 
skiing, scuba diving, and other extreme 
sports. 
And he was one of those rare individ-
uals who, at a young age, had that 
drive to defend his Nation as a member 
of the U.S. Armed Forces. He joined 
the Navy and was signed as a Fleet Ma-
rine Force hospital corpsman, serving 
side by side with the infantry marines 
of the Second Battalion, First Marine 
Regiment. 
Affectionately known as a ‘‘devil 
doc,’’ a takeoff on the Marines’ ‘‘devil 
dog’’ nickname, Max was a member of 
a select group of medical specialists 
trained to operate side by side with the 
men and women of the U.S. Marine 
Corps on the frontlines, just as he was 
doing in Kabul the day he died, helping 
evacuate Americans and our allies who 
were 
fleeing 
the 
tyranny 
of 
the 
Taliban. 
In his far too short time with us, Max 
did his duty, and he did it with distinc-
tion and valor. He took care of his ma-
rines and, while in Kabul, cared for in-
nocent Afghans who were fleeing the 
Taliban. 
Kathleen, Max’s sister, said it well: 
‘‘In Maxton’s final days, he spent his 
time helping others stay alive, as he 
had developed a passion for saving the 
lives of others, so much so, that he was 
willing to risk his own life and made 
the ultimate sacrifice.’’ So true. 
Before the attack in Kabul, Max was 
able to FaceTime his mom, Rachel. As 
they said their good-byes, his mom told 
him to be safe. 
Max replied: 
Don’t worry, mom, my guys got me. They 
won’t let anything happen to me. 
That was the last time she spoke to 
him before Max and his fellow marines 
and soldiers gave their lives in service 
of keeping so many others—moms, 
dads, kids, and fellow servicemem-
bers—safe. He didn’t want anything to 
happen to us. 
For his bravery and sacrifice, Max 
was awarded the Purple Heart and a 
Combat Action Ribbon. When he came 
home to Berlin Heights, OH, he was 
greeted with a hero’s welcome that he 
richly deserved. Families lined the 
streets as his casket, draped in the 
American flag, was brought home to 
his family. 
When I visited his hometown over the 
weekend to deliver an American flag 
flown over the U.S. Capitol in honor of 
his service, there were flags in every 
yard and posters and flowers; you could 
sense the love and support for Max and 
for his family from his grateful neigh-
bors. Yesterday, hundreds came to the 
Edison High School football stadium, 
where Max had helped lead the Char-
gers to victory time and time again; 
they came to pay their last respects to 
an honorable American life taken too 
soon in service of all of us. 
Max’s sacrifice, along with that of 
the other marines and soldiers who 
died or were grievously wounded that 
day, reminds us of how blessed we are 
to have such courageous and selfless 
fellow citizens willing to stand guard 
for us. We must be grateful for the sac-
rifices our troops make every day to 
keep America safe. My thoughts and 
prayers are with Max’s parents, Kip 
and Rachel Soviak, and his entire fam-
ily, as well as those he knew and who 
loved him. May God comfort them in 
the days and weeks ahead. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
HONORING LANCE CORPORAL RYLEE MCCOLLUM 
Ms. LUMMIS. Madam President, Wy-
oming’s heart is heavy with grief 
today. I rise to honor the life, sacrifice, 
and memory of Wyoming native LCpl 
Rylee McCollum. He, along with 12 of 
his fellow servicemembers, lost their 
lives while defending the airport in 
Kabul as American citizens and allies 
escaped the clutches of the Taliban. 
Their selfless service and sacrifice will 
be honored and remembered, and they 
will be forever cherished by a grateful 
nation. 
Rylee was a Wyoming guy through 
and through. His life’s goal of serving 
in the U.S. Marine Corps began seem-
ingly while he was still in diapers, be-
fore he could even comprehend what 
that entailed. He was born with the 
heart of a soldier. 
He joined the military right out of 
high school. He heard the call to defend 
our Nation, and he didn’t hesitate to 
answer that call. He had plans to be-
come a history teacher and coach once 
he finished his commitment to the Ma-
rines. He was about to become a father. 
I had the opportunity to meet with 
some of Rylee’s family this past week-
end. I had the great honor of expressing 
my deepest appreciation of Rylee’s sac-
rifice to them in person on behalf of a 
very grateful Wyoming. Wyoming’s 
very special way of honoring its be-
loved Rylee was on full display last 
Friday. 
People waving Americans flags lined 
the streets of Jackson to give Rylee a 
hero’s welcome as his remains were re-
turned home. The people of Wyoming 
are heartbroken but infinitely proud of 
his bravery and sacrifice. 
Just yesterday, September 13, 2021, 
Rylee’s 
family 
welcomed 
into 
the 
world his daughter, Levi Rylee Rose—8 
pounds, 10 ounces. Although she will 
never meet her father, who was killed 
before she was born, she will be sur-
rounded by love from mother Gigi, 
proud 
grandfather 
Jim 
McCollum, 
Rylee’s sisters, and many other rel-
atives who will share with Levi what a 
wonderful and heroic father she had. 
Our hearts, our love, our prayers, and 
our embrace are with Rylee’s wife, 
child, friends, and family as they 
grieve his loss and remember his brav-
ery. 
Madam 
President, 
Wyoming 
will 
never ever forget. 
I yield back. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Nebraska. 
HONORING CORPORAL DAEGAN WILLIAM-TYELER 
PAGE 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to speak in memory and in honor 
of Corporal Page, a 23-year-old marine 
from Nebraska. He gave his life defend-
ing Americans and our allies in the 
chaos of the Kabul airport as many 
tried to escape the capture of Afghani-
stan by a band of blood-thirsty terror-
ists. 
Corporal Page is 1 of 13 heroes who 
gave his life that day defending the 
Kabul airport in the midst of that cha-
otic evacuation. The American people 
owe these men and women a debt of 
gratitude that we will never be able to 
repay. 
Corporal Page lost his life while hon-
oring our Nation’s promise that we 
would leave no one behind. He and his 
fellow marines never wavered. They 
didn’t fail in executing their duty. 
They were given an impossible mission, 
and these men and women fought to 
the end. It is now our duty to stand 
with these families, the families of 
each of these 13, and to honor their sac-
rifices. 
Last Friday, in Omaha, thousands 
and thousands and thousands of Ne-
braskans lined the streets to give Cor-
poral Page a hero’s welcome as his 
body was returned home. As his family 
said, ‘‘Our hearts are still broken, but 
we are the lucky few who know what it 
is’’ to have the entire city of Omaha 
give you a hug. 
We are called to gather around one 
another. We are called to join with the 
grieving and to mourn the loss of these 
brave men and women. 
Corporal Page was a Nebraskan who 
made his family and his State and his 
entire Nation proud. He left for boot 
camp shortly after graduating from 
Millard South High School, and he was 
proud to serve in the 2nd Battalion, 1st 
Marine Regiment with his fellow ma-
rines. 
He enjoyed playing hockey. One of 
my kids played hockey against him. He

went to Millard South High School, but 
he played hockey for Westside and the 
Fremont team my kids played on. They 
got to compete against him and know 
him as a competitor. 
He enjoyed hunting, being in the out-
doors. He especially enjoyed the water. 
He was a Boy Scout in Troop 331. He 
loved spending time with his family 
and friends. He was a member of his 
local church, the Lutheran church of 
Millard, St. Paul’s Lutheran Church of 
Millard. 
Like so many Nebraskans, he was a 
die-hard sports fan, his favorite team 
being the Chicago Blackhawks. 
Corporal Page gave the last full 
measure of devotion to his country. His 
mission was clear. In the chaos of 
Kabul, Corporal Page was there to pro-
tect and save lives, and that is exactly 
what he did. Marines held the line and 
pulled both Americans and our Afghan 
allies to safety. Marines pulled chil-
dren out of hell, gave them water, and 
got them to safety. 
Corporal Page gave his life so that 
others would live. Nebraskans will 
never forget him. Heroes like Corporal 
Page didn’t fail us, and we can’t forget 
them. We must keep our promise to 
honor his family, to teach our families 
about their sacrifice, and to strive to 
live lives of gratitude. It is times like 
this where we rediscover the heart of 
our country. Communities that pull to-
gether—as happened last Friday and 
will happen this Friday at his funeral 
at St. Paul’s Lutheran—we pray to-
gether, make meals for each other, and 
we are reminded of the sacrifice so 
many families have made. 
Today, and in the days to come, we 
in Nebraska will honor Corporal Page, 
and we across this country will honor 
the 13 who fell that day. Your sacrifice 
is a debt we can never repay. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
HONORING LANCE CORPORAL DAVID LEE 
ESPINOZA 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I rise today 
to honor the life of David Lee Espinoza, 
who died in defense of our Nation on 
August 26. 
David was a marine who was helping 
with the evacuation of the Kabul air-
port when he was murdered by a sui-
cide bomber, along with 12 other serv-
ice men and women who so senselessly 
had their lives taken from them that 
day. His mother got the call that every 
parent of every servicemember fears 
when she was told at 2:30 in the morn-
ing that her son had lost his life in Af-
ghanistan. 
David was just 20 years old. David 
was a lifelong Texan. He was born in 
Laredo and raised nearby in Rio Bravo, 
where he was the eldest of four chil-
dren. 
David always wanted to be a marine. 
And as a child, he loved to consider dif-
ferent military strategies as he played 
with toy soldiers. David joined the Ma-
rines the summer after he graduated 
from LBJ High School in Laredo in 
2019, and he spent time serving in Jor-
dan before being sent to Kabul the 
week before he died. It has been said 
that other service branches wanted 
David to join their ranks, but David al-
ways knew he was meant to be a ma-
rine. 
David was a beloved son, a brother, a 
friend, and a fellow marine. He was a 
patriot who had a passion for service, 
and our Nation can never repay the 
debt that we owe to David and to his 
family for giving what President Lin-
coln hailed as ‘‘the last full measure of 
devotion.’’ 
Yesterday, at David’s funeral mass, 
Father Francisco Stodola said: 
As tragic as this loss is, and as deep as the 
wounds of sorrow have pierced the hearts of 
his loved ones, and particularly his mother— 
because a mother would rather lose an arm 
or a leg than to have to lose a child—we can 
console ourselves with the fact that David 
died doing what he wanted to do with the 
people he wanted to do it with. 
We will remember David and the in-
credible sacrifice he gave for our coun-
try. He will also be remembered by his 
community. The Laredo City Council 
has already voted to name the road in 
front of LBJ High School, David’s alma 
mater, as the ‘‘Lance Corporal David 
Lee Espinoza Memorial Boulevard.’’ 
To 
David’s 
parents, 
Elizabeth 
Holguin and Victor Manuel Dominguez, 
and to his siblings, Angel Martin 
Espinoza, Victor Manuel Dominguez, 
Jr., and Delilah Alyssa Dominguez, I 
want to say that your son and your 
brother was a brave patriot who will 
never be forgotten. Heidi and I are lift-
ing you up in prayer as you mourn the 
loss of your beloved David. 
The 91st Psalm is sometimes called 
the soldier’s or the warrior’s psalm be-
cause it asks the Lord for protection 
against many foes, and it assures us 
that the Lord will be with us in times 
of trouble: 
Because he loves me, says the Lord, I will 
rescue him; 
I will protect him, for he acknowledges my 
name. 
He will call on me, and I will answer him; 
I will be with him in trouble, 
I will deliver him and honor him. 
David’s sacrifice was not in vain. He 
died as he lived, giving of himself in 
the service of others. David now rests 
from his labors, having been a good and 
faithful servant. 
And to the families of all of those 
whose lives were lost in Afghanistan 
this year and in the 20 years that pre-
ceded it, know that your sacrifice, 
know that your loss was not in vain. 
America is better. America is safer. 
American lives are more secure be-
cause your sons and daughters an-
swered the call. America is better and 
safer and more secure because David 
Espinoza answered the call. Texas and 
America are better for having known 
him, and we are in his debt. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
HONORING LANCE CORPORAL JARED SCHMITZ 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I rise 
today to join my colleagues in hon-
oring the 13 servicemembers who were 
killed in action in Afghanistan last 
month doing what only the bravest and 
the most extraordinary Americans do: 
risking their lives to save others. 
Every name has been mentioned on 
the floor today, but no matter how 
often we mention those names, we 
can’t restore those individuals to their 
families. We can’t restore them to 
their communities. We can’t restore 
them to the people they served side by 
side with in the military. 
But we can remember what they 
did—what they did collectively, and 
what they did individually. 
One of the marines we tragically lost 
in the attack at Kabul airport was 
Lance 
Corporal 
Jared 
Schmitz 
of 
Wentzville, MO. He was just 6 months 
old on 9/11. In fact, we have seen that 
discussion many times of people who 
now give their life who were babies or 
not yet born on 9/11, 20 years ago. 
Even though he was 6 months old on 
9/11, he knew what he wanted to be, and 
he knew he wanted to be a marine by 
the time he was a sophomore in high 
school. He started training as a teen-
ager, years before he enlisted. After 
graduating from Fort Zumwalt South 
High School in St. Peters, MO, he real-
ized his dream. He joined the Marines 
and served as an infantryman. 
Jared’s father Mark Schmitz says his 
son—this is his father’s quote and it is 
a great thing to be able to say about 
your son. Mark Schmitz said his son 
‘‘looked out for everybody. Anyone 
who needed help, he was there. He was 
selfless. He never put himself first.’’ 
Of course, we see another moment 
when he and the others whose lives 
were lost and others who were in-
jured—some 
dramatically 
injured— 
didn’t put themselves first; they put 
others first. 
Friends remember Jared as energetic, 
as happy, as a faithful fan of the St. 
Louis Blues. Others will remember him 
as 1 of 56 Missourians who made the ul-
timate sacrifice as part of the either 
Operation Enduring Freedom or Oper-
ation Freedom’s Sentinel. 
We remember and honor each and 
every one of these heroes from our 
State and heroes from every State who 
have given their lives for freedom in 
this post-9/11 world, where we don’t 
know exactly where the borders are or 
who—where the enemy might be at any 
given time, whether they are going to 
strike at home, where we live, or 
whether they are going to strike far 
away, where others are representing us 
and defending us. We remember and 
honor each of them. 
We pray for their families and all 
who will feel the loss for the rest of 
their lives. We need to now do our part 
every day to live lives worthy of their 
sacrifice, never taking for granted the 
freedom and security we have because 
they were called to serve and support it 
and guarantee it for another genera-
tion. 
I know I join all my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle as we think of

these 13 individuals who did pay that

I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
NOMINATION OF ANGEL KELLEY 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the confirmation 
of Judge Angel Kelley to serve as a 
judge on the U.S. District Court for the 
District of Massachusetts. 
In a legal career that has already 
spanned almost 30 years, Judge Kelley 
has excelled in everything she has 
done, and she has done a lot. She has 
been a trial attorney, a legal instruc-
tor, and a State court judge in my 
home State of Massachusetts. 
She has devoted her entire profes-
sional career to serving the public. She 
began her practice of law representing 
children in delinquency and protective 
care cases in New York. She went on to 
serve as a senior trial attorney and as-
sistant chief for litigation in the fast- 
paced and demanding Port Authority 
of New York and New Jersey. She 
served as an assistant U.S. attorney. 
She has taught litigation skills to 
students at Harvard University Law 
School 
and 
supervised 
them 
rep-
resenting indigent clients appearing in 
probate and family court. 
As a judge sitting in the Massachu-
setts District and Superior Courts, she 
has presided over hundreds of trials. 
She has issued opinions in civil and 
criminal proceedings, addressing topics 
including employment discrimination, 
judicial immunity for testifying wit-
nesses, grand jury integrity, the right 
against self-incrimination, and public 
records access. Her opinions suggest a 
thoughtful, balanced, and evenhanded 
approach. 
Judge Kelley has throughout her ca-
reer demonstrated one thing above all 
else, and that is an abiding commit-
ment to our Nation’s promise of equal 
justice under the law. She has been a 
leader in the Massachusetts judiciary 
on fulfilling this promise, especially to 
litigants of color. She has been a friend 
and mentor to many members of the 
legal community and their affinity 
groups, with her nomination receiving 
strong support from the Massachusetts 
Black Lawyers Association, the Massa-
chusetts Hispanic Lawyers Associa-
tion, and the Asian American Lawyers 
Association of Massachusetts, among 
others. 
At a time when our Federal bench 
needs both diversity of experience and 
diversity of background more than 
ever, Judge Kelley meets the moment 
with qualifications that are, unfortu-
nately, too rare for Federal judges. It 
is my sincere hope to see more nomi-
nees like Judge Kelley in the near fu-
ture as we help reshape America’s judi-
ciary to better suit the people it 
serves. 
In light of her qualifications, experi-
ence, and service, including a unani-
mous ‘‘well qualified’’ rating from the 
American 
Bar 
Association, 
Judge 
Kelley received bipartisan support in 
the Judiciary Committee to advance 
her nomination. I urge my colleagues 
to support her nomination here on the 
floor and vote yes to confirm her so 
that we can fill a long vacancy on the 
Massachusetts Federal court with a 
true, outstandingly qualified jurist 
who represents the best of our judicial 
system and our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Colorado. 
NOMINATION OF VERONICA S. ROSSMAN 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak about Veronica Rossman, Presi-
dent Biden’s nominee for the U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit. 
Ms. Rossman comes to this floor with 
broad legal experience and a sterling 
reputation in Colorado. Veronica cares 
deeply about justice and the rule of law 
because she knows what it means to 
live without it. 
Veronica was born in Russia, where 
her family faced anti-Semitism at 
every turn. Her grandparents couldn’t 
openly practice their faith because 
they feared retaliation at work. Her fa-
ther was a brilliant career scientist 
who was routinely denied promotions. 
Her mother, a talented pianist and 
music teacher, never openly shared her 
faith until the family fled Russia. 
In the end, Veronica’s parents knew 
that anti-Semitism would stand in the 
way of her enormous potential, and 
they wanted her to grow up with a free-
dom that they never enjoyed. And like 
so many others in our country’s his-
tory, Veronica and her family came to 
America as political refugees. 
And from virtually nothing, Veronica 
built a distinguished legal career. She 
worked hard and earned a BA from Co-
lumbia University, and then a JD from 
the University of California at Has-
tings. 
She clerked for Justice William 
Maupin of the Nevada Supreme Court, 
who could say not enough about her 
brilliant legal mind. Veronica then 
practiced appellate litigation at Morri-
son & Foerster, where she worked on 
one of the largest international patent 
cases in history. 
Later, she served as a staff attorney 
for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
Ninth Circuit, and taught for 3 years at 
the University of Denver as a visiting 
professor of law. 
In private practice, Veronica special-
ized in complex civil litigation and 
handled cases about everything from 
antitrust law to intellectual property 
law. 
At this point, Veronica could have 
pursued any number of high-paying 
legal jobs, but, instead, she became a 
Federal public defender for the dis-
tricts of Colorado and Wyoming. 
And over the past 12 years, Ms. 
Rossman developed rare expertise as an 
appellate specialist, handling direct 
criminal appeals from every judicial 
district in the Tenth Circuit. 
In her time as a public defender, she 
has handled or supervised over 100 ap-
pellate matters before the Tenth Cir-
cuit. She has represented more than 250 
indigent 
clients—from 
controversial 
defendants to people sentenced to long 
terms for a nonviolent offense, even 
though they had no criminal history. 
She fought for every one of those 
Americans, often against long odds. 
But more than that, she fought for the 
American ideal that everyone deserves 
equal justice under the law. 
If confirmed, Veronica would be the 
only judge on the Tenth Circuit with 
experience as a public defender. We 
need more judges like Veronica, who 
are not only highly qualified, but who 
know what it means to be on the wrong 
end of the legal system that too often 
fails the most vulnerable in our soci-
ety. 
I know some of my Republican col-
leagues worry about confirming public 
defenders because they don’t know that 
much about civil procedure. I don’t 
share that view. But in Veronica’s 
case, it doesn’t apply anyway. When 
she was in private practice, as I men-
tioned, she worked exclusively on civil 
matters. She taught civil procedure at 
the University of Denver. 
And some others have suggested that 
public defenders bring in an ideological 
agenda to the bench. In Veronica’s 
case, that couldn’t be further from the 
truth. Her family’s story has proven 
her profound appreciation for how, at 
its best, the rule of law is an antidote 
to the arbitrary administration of law 
based on prejudice. 
And you don’t have to take my word 
for it. Here is what she told the Judici-
ary Committee under oath. She said: 
[I]f confirmed. . . . In every case, I will 
treat all litigants respectfully and impar-
tially;. . . . I will carefully review the record 
on appeal; I will put aside any personal 
views; I will faithfully adhere to the rule of 
law. 
Ms. Rossman’s qualifications are ob-
vious. She has been a first-rate lawyer, 
and she would make a first-rate judge. 
That is why the Judiciary Committee 
sent her to the floor with a bipartisan 
vote. Now I hope all of us can come to-
gether and confirm this outstanding 
nominee.

JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate will continue the im-
portant work of confirming President 
Biden’s judicial nominees. 
From the moment President Biden 
entered office, Senate Democrats have 
worked closely with his administration 
to identify nominees with impeccable 
credentials and extensive experience. 
Together, we have worked to restore 
balance to our Nation’s Federal courts 
by confirming nominees with diverse 
professional and demographic back-
grounds. 
Today, I would like to speak in sup-
port of three such nominees: David 
Estudillo, nominated to the Western

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6479 
September 14, 2021 
District of Washington; Angel Kelley, 
nominated to the District of Massachu-
setts; and Veronica Rossman, nomi-
nated to the Tenth Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. 
Judge David Estudillo is a native son 
of Washington State who has devoted 
his entire legal career to serving his 
community. He was born in Sunnyside, 
WA, where his parents run a small gro-
cery store bearing the family’s name. 
His mom and dad first arrived in the 
United States in the 1960s as agricul-
tural workers through the Bracero pro-
gram. Inspired by his family’s deter-
mination and tenacious work ethic, 
Judge Estudillo decided to pursue a ca-
reer in law. He received his under-
graduate and law degrees from the Uni-
versity of Washington and has since 
practiced law in the State where he is 
now nominated to serve. 
Since 
2015, 
Judge 
Estudillo 
has 
served as a Grant County Superior 
judge. When he ran for reelection in 
2016, his record as a litigator and a 
judge earned him broad support within 
Grant County and throughout the 
State. He received endorsements from 
the Grant County Democratic and Re-
publican Parties, as well as all nine 
State supreme court justices. 
Before his appointment to the bench, 
Judge Estudillo served as a litigator 
for 16 years. He spent much of that 
time as an immigration attorney, a 
role in which he assisted his neighbors 
with asylum applications and helped 
explain the complexities of immigra-
tion law at a host of community fo-
rums. 
Over the course of his judicial career, 
Judge Estudillo has presided over near-
ly 50 jury and bench trials that have 
gone to final verdict or judgment. He 
will be more than prepared to take on 
the demanding work of the district 
court from day one. Judge Estudillo 
has the strong support of his home 
State Senators, Senators MURRAY and 
CANTWELL, and received a ‘‘Qualified’’ 
rating from the American Bar Associa-
tion. He also received a strong, 15–7 bi-
partisan vote in the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting his nomination to the West-
ern District of Washington. 
Today, the Senate will also vote on 
Judge Angel Kelley’s nomination to 
the Federal District Court of Massa-
chusetts. A graduate of Georgetown 
University Law Center, Judge Kelley 
has the credentials, experience, and 
temperament 
needed 
to 
effectively 
serve the people of Massachusetts. 
Prior to her appointment to the Mas-
sachusetts State court in 2009, Judge 
Kelley was a prolific litigator who de-
voted her practice to public service. 
She worked as a Federal prosecutor, an 
attorney for indigent juvenile defend-
ants, and as a senior litigator for the 
Port Authority of New York and New 
Jersey, where she helped represent the 
families of the 87 Port Authority em-
ployees who tragically lost their lives 
on 9/11. 
With 13 years of judicial experience, 
Judge Kelley has handled both civil 
and criminal cases and presided over 
more than 100 trials. At every turn, 
Judge Kelley has demonstrated the 
qualities we expect from the best of ju-
rists: thoughtfulness, evenhandedness, 
and impartiality. 
Judge Kelley has the strong support 
of her home State Senators, Senators 
WARREN and MARKEY, and received a 
unanimous ‘‘Well Qualified’’ rating 
from the American Bar Association. 
Like Judge Estudillo, Judge Kelley re-
ceived a bipartisan 15–7 vote in com-
mittee, a testament to her qualifica-
tions and commitment to the rule of 
law. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in supporting Judge Kelley’s nomina-
tion. 
Finally, the Senate will also consider 
today the nomination of Veronica 
Rossman to a Colorado seat on the 
Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. With 
her extensive appellate experience in 
both private practice and as a Federal 
public defender, Ms. Rossman will be 
an outstanding addition to the Tenth 
Circuit. 
She has spent the majority of her ca-
reer at the Office of the Federal Public 
Defender for the Districts of Colorado 
and Wyoming, where she has handled 
and supervised over 100 criminal appel-
late matters arising out of every judi-
cial district in the Tenth Circuit. 
As I have said many times, former 
public defenders, like Ms. Rossman, 
offer a crucial perspective that is often 
underrepresented within our Federal 
judiciary. And I applaud President 
Biden 
and 
Senators 
BENNET
and 
HICKENLOOPER for supporting her nomi-
nation. 
In private practice, Ms. Rossman spe-
cialized in complex civil litigation, in-
cluding appellate cases and matters in-
volving antitrust law and intellectual 
property law. She has received a 
‘‘Qualified’’ rating from the American 
Bar Association and earned bipartisan 
support in the Judiciary Committee. 
Ms. Rossman is a seasoned practi-
tioner in Federal courts, and she is 
well prepared to serve on the Tenth 
Circuit. I look forward to supporting 
her nomination, and I encourage my 
colleagues to join me. 
During the first 8 months of the 
Biden administration, this Senate has 
made tremendous progress in con-
firming to the bench individuals who 
have dedicated their careers to defend-
ing the rule of law. 
With the three nominees before the 
Senate today, we can continue building 
on that progress and bring our Federal 
judiciary closer to reflecting the full 
diversity of the American experience.

September 14, 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. I know of no further 
debate on the bill, as amended. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
any further debate? 
If not, and the bill having been read

passed, as follows: 
S. 273 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Driftnet 
Modernization and Bycatch Reduction Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITION.

Fishery Conservation and Management Act

SEC. 3. FINDINGS AND POLICY.

and inserting ‘‘; and’’; and

‘‘(8) within the exclusive economic zone, 
large-scale driftnet fishing that deploys nets 
with large mesh sizes causes significant en-
tanglement and mortality of living marine 
resources, including myriad protected spe-
cies, despite limitations on the lengths of 
such nets.’’. 
(b) POLICY.—Section 206(c) of the Magnu-
son-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Man-
agement Act (16 U.S.C. 1826(c)) is amended—

SEC. 4. TRANSITION PROGRAM. 
Section 206 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fish-
ery Conservation and Management Act (16

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—During the 5-year period 
beginning on the date of enactment of the 
Driftnet Modernization and Bycatch Reduc-
tion Act, the Secretary shall conduct a tran-
sition program to facilitate the phase-out of 
large-scale driftnet fishing and adoption of 
alternative fishing practices that minimize 
the incidental catch of living marine re-
sources, and shall award grants to eligible 
permit holders who participate in the pro-
gram. 
‘‘(2) PERMISSIBLE USES.—Any permit holder 
receiving a grant under paragraph (1) may 
use such funds only for the purpose of cov-
ering— 
‘‘(A) any fee originally associated with a 
permit authorizing participation in a large- 
scale driftnet fishery, if such permit is sur-
rendered for permanent revocation, and such 
permit holder relinquishes any claim associ-
ated with the permit; 
‘‘(B) a forfeiture of fishing gear associated 
with a permit described in subparagraph (A); 
or 
‘‘(C) the purchase of alternative gear with 
minimal incidental catch of living marine 
resources, if the fishery participant is au-
thorized to continue fishing using such alter-
native gears. 
‘‘(3) CERTIFICATION.—The Secretary shall 
certify that, with respect to each participant 
in the program under this subsection, any 
permit authorizing participation in a large- 
scale driftnet fishery has been permanently

The resolution with its preamble, as

S. RES. 339 
Whereas ataxia is a clinical manifestation 
indicating degeneration or dysfunction of 
the brain that negatively affects the coordi-
nation, precision, and accurate timing of 
physical movements; 
Whereas ataxia can strike individuals of 
all ages, including children; 
Whereas the term ‘‘ataxia’’ is used to clas-
sify 
a 
group 
of 
rare, 
inherited 
neurodegenerative diseases including— 
(1) ataxia telangiectasia; 
(2) episodic ataxia; 
(3) Friedreich’s ataxia; and 
(4) spinocerebellar ataxia; 
Whereas there are many known types of 
genetic ataxia, but the genetic basis for 
ataxia in some patients is still unknown; 
Whereas all inherited ataxias affect fewer 
than 200,000 individuals in the United States 
and, therefore, are recognized as rare dis-
eases under the Orphan Drug Act (Public 
Law 97–414; 96 Stat. 2049); 
Whereas some genetic ataxias are inher-
ited in an autosomal dominant manner, 
while others are inherited in an autosomal 
recessive manner; 
Whereas ataxia symptoms can also be 
caused by noninherited health conditions 
and other factors, including stroke, tumor, 
cerebral palsy, head trauma, multiple scle-
rosis, alcohol abuse, and certain medica-
tions; 
Whereas ataxia can present physical, psy-
chological, and financial challenges for pa-
tients and their families; 
Whereas symptoms and outcomes of ataxia 
progress at different rates and include— 
(1) lack of coordination; 
(2) slurred speech; 
(3) cardiomyopathy; 
(4) scoliosis; 
(5) eye movement abnormalities; 
(6) difficulty walking; 
(7) tremors; 
(8) trouble eating and swallowing; 
(9) difficulties with other activities that 
require fine motor skills; and 
(10) death; 
Whereas most patients with ataxia require 
the use of assistive devices, such as wheel-
chairs and walkers, to aid in their mobility, 
and many individuals may need physical and 
occupational therapy; 
Whereas there is no treatment or cure ap-
proved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for ataxia; and 
Whereas clinical research to develop safe 
and effective treatments for ataxia is ongo-
ing: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the need for greater public 
awareness of ataxia; 
(2) expresses support for the designation of 
September 25, 2021, as ‘‘National Ataxia 
Awareness Day’’; 
(3) supports the goals of National Ataxia 
Awareness Day, which are— 
(A) to raise awareness of the causes and 
symptoms of ataxia among the general pub-
lic and health care professionals; 
(B) to improve diagnosis of ataxia and ac-
cess to care for patients affected by ataxia; 
and 
(C) to accelerate ataxia research, including 
on safe and effective treatment options and, 
ultimately, a cure; 
(4) acknowledges the challenges facing in-
dividuals in the United States who have 
ataxia and the families of those individuals; 
and 
(5) encourages States, territories, and lo-
calities to support the goals of National 
Ataxia Awareness Day.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO PAUL COSTELLO 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, few peo-
ple have advocated for their home 
States as tirelessly and as effectively 
as Paul Costello has advocated for 
Vermont. After 21 years at the helm of 
the Vermont Council for Rural Devel-
opment, Paul is retiring from his post, 
but I know he will never retire from his 
steadfast support for Vermont. 
Paul has dedicated his entire career 
to fostering dialogue and embracing 
civic engagement to move our commu-
nities forward by bringing people to-
gether to inspire constructive change. 
His decades of service deserve special 
recognition. As I was as well, Paul was 
born and raised in Vermont. He grew 
up in Burlington and spent his under-
graduate years at the University of 
Vermont. He later crossed the border 
to earn a Ph.D. in intellectual history 
from Montreal’s McGill University. 
After completing his education, Paul 
lectured at his alma maters and at 
Saint Michael’s College, and he served 
as an adviser at Sterling College in 
Craftsbury. He served for 5 years at 
Central Vermont Basic Adult Edu-
cation, bringing literacy instruction to 
teens and adults in rural Vermont 
counties, before stepping into his long-
time role as executive director at the 
Vermont Council on Rural Develop-
ment—VCRD—in 2000. 
The VCRD is truly a Vermont insti-
tution. The council does important 
work to help strengthen our rural com-
munities. Known for their community 
visits, VCRD travels to towns through-
out the State, where leaders from dif-
ferent sectors in Vermont listen to 
community members identify and ac-
knowledge the challenges and opportu-
nities they have before them. Sticking 
to Paul’s dedication to a locally driven 
process, the visiting VCRD team re-
flects on the community discussion and 
offers guidance and potential resources 
to help the community meet their 
needs and goals. The VCRD has facili-
tated community visits in over 75 
Vermont towns, and success from these 
events is seen in the form of new 
projects, grants, job creation, imple-
mentation of green energy, and so 
much more. These visits also have the 
effect of bringing our rural commu-
nities together and adding to the sense 
of unity that is already so strong in 
our small towns. 
Through Paul’s leadership, the VCRD 
has followed through with initiatives 
that have a lasting positive influence 
on our State as a whole. The council’s 
Working Lands Enterprise Initiative 
has created hundreds of new jobs and 
generated more than $35 million for 
Vermont’s 
economy. 
Under 
Paul’s 
steady hand, the VCRD has also helped 
to improve and expand Vermont’s dig-
ital economy, something which our 
State continues to expand to make 
ours a competitive economy, locally, 
regionally, and internationally. 
Paul has lived by his mantra of ‘‘lis-
tening, learning and helping,’’ and the 
benefits can be seen across rural 
Vermont. He is a Vermonter through 
and through, and I am proud to call 
him a dear friend. 
In honor of Paul’s retirement and 21 
years 
of 
exceptional 
service 
to 
Vermont, I ask unanimous consent 
that the article ‘‘Moved the Needle,’’ 
by Steve Pappas, published in the 
Barre Montpelier Times Argus, be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Barre Montpelier Times Argus, 
June 3, 2021] 
MOVED THE NEEDLE 
(By Steve Pappas) 
Paul Costello is too humble to say it, so we 
will: As the 21-year director of the Vermont 
Council on Rural Development he has prob-
ably done more for Vermont than most law-
makers or governors. 
It’s a bold statement, we understand. But 
consider that Costello has worked for a non-
partisan nonprofit agency that has influ-
enced most of the major public policy initia-
tives in this state during these two decades. 
Only our three members in the congressional 
delegation—and they are definitely par-
tisan—have had that much sway for any 
similar length of time. Less than a week 
after hosting the Summit for the Future of 
Vermont, which brought together hundreds 
of Vermonters to tackle head-on some of the 
most difficult challenges facing our state, 
the announcement that Costello is stepping 
down stunned the state. 
Costello says he will step down Sept. 30. 
Through his work, Costello has led efforts 
through VCRD’s talented staff to facilitate 
some of the hardest conversations out there: 
economy, workforce, climate change, edu-
cation, community development, broadband, 
digital economy, social equity . . . the list 
goes on. 
From these conversations, whether they 
happened in town halls or large lecture halls 
or virtually, Costello, in his even-keeled, 
thoughtful manner, has facilitated strategies 
aimed at setting priorities, and charting 
paths toward progress. Many of those deci-
sions frame our quality of life today. 
According to the news release issued by 
VCRD this week, ‘‘Over these years Paul has 
engaged communities throughout the state 
to help them set priorities and connect to re-
sources, led a dozen policy council efforts to 
advance local opportunities, developed a 
score of statewide summits to build unity 
and common purpose to answer key rural 
needs, and worked in myriad ways to bring 
people together for the common good of their 
communities and for Vermont.’’ 
Being the person who coordinates, directs 
and often moderates those methods of com-
munication and openness is powerful. In the 
same release, Costello noted, ‘‘In so many 
ways this is the best job in Vermont. At 
VCRD we have a window into communities 
like no other. Our role of listening, learning, 
and helping to move ideas toward action in 
communities and in policy circles is end-
lessly interesting and rewarding. I want to 
thank all the incredible people I’ve been able 
to work with in this role, from board mem-
bers to state, federal and nonprofit leaders, 
experts in all aspects of rural issues and es-
pecially the local leaders who do the hard 
work of lifting up their communities and 
building progress. Working with you all has 
been the greatest honor.’’ 
Julie Moore, chair of the VCRD board of 
directors noted, ‘‘Paul Costello is a Vermont 
treasure. Our state has benefited beyond 
measure from his wise counsel to everyone 
from governors to select board members to 
community leaders. We look forward to cele-
brating all of his accomplishments.’’ 
But here’s the thing about Paul Costello: 
He is committed to Vermont because he 
loves it. To him, the work is not a paycheck. 
It is about making our communities strong-
er. It is about making our policies supportive 
of those communities. It is about preserva-
tion and conversation when needed, but with 
an eye toward answers. It is about being a 
part of this magnificent state. 
He knows every corner of the state. He has 
been at the select board meetings and talked 
to residents about what they want, and he 
has been hiking and experiencing Vermont. 
His love for the place is real. He grew up 
here, in a large family, with a great appre-
ciation that goes back decades. He hears 
what others want for Vermont, and he knows 
what he wants for Vermont. And he’s so flip-
ping nice about it all. There have to be indi-
viduals out there who don’t want Paul Cos-
tello coming around and getting people 
thinking about how to implement change. 
But even those people can’t point to the man 
and say, ‘‘I didn’t like that guy.’’ They did. 
Costello listens. Even in the most serious 
conversation, he can find humor and a laugh. 
He makes every person he speaks to feel as 
if they are the most important person, be-
cause in that moment, they are. He is mild- 
mannered and kind. He goes out of his way 
to ask how people’s days are going, even 
when he knows they are strapped and 
swamped. He treats governors and citizens 
with the same respect. Opinions and solu-
tions do not require titles and doctorates 
and years of service. They need common 
ground on which to build, and that was what 
Costello has practiced and mentored his staff 
to find for more than 20 years now. 
Ted Brady, who used to work with Costello 
and now runs the Vermont League of Cities 
and Towns, posted online yesterday, ‘‘I can 
count on one hand the number of people I 
have met as selfless, thoughtful and kind as 
Paul Costello. He’s given so much to 
Vermont . . . and deserves a chance to play 
in his favorite spots in the woods and moun-
tains of the communities he has helped to 
strengthen and empower. Buy him a beer if 
you see him.’’ 
Costello may never have to buy his own 
beer again. Each one of us owes him a great 
debt of gratitude for the Vermont he has 
given everyone.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
India—Harpoon Joint Common Test Set 
(JCTS) 
The Government of India has requested to 
buy one (1) Harpoon Joint Common Test Set 
(JCTS). Also included is one (1) Harpoon In-
termediate Level maintenance station; spare 
and repair parts, support, and test equip-
ment; publications and technical documenta-
tion; personnel training; U.S. Government 
and contractor technical, engineering, and 
logistics support services; and other related 
elements of logistics and program support. 
The estimated total cost is $82 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by helping to strengthen the U.S.-In-
dian strategic relationship and to improve 
the security of a major defensive partner, 
which continues to be an important force for 
political stability, peace, and economic 
progress in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia 
region. 
This proposed sale will improve India’s ca-
pability to meet current and future threats 
by providing India with flexible and efficient 
Harpoon missile maintenance capabilities to 
ensure maximum force readiness. India will 
have no difficulty absorbing this equipment 
into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be The Boe-
ing Company, St. Louis, MO. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. Any offset 
agreement required by India will be defined 
in negotiations between the purchaser and 
the contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the assignment of one (1) U.S. con-
tractor representative to India for a duration 
of one (1) year to support technical reviews, 
support, and oversight. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Georgia—Javelin Missiles 
The Government of Georgia has requested 
to buy eighty-two (82) Javelin FGM–148 Mis-
siles; and forty-six (46) Javelin Command 
Launch Units (CLU). Also included are En-
hanced Producibility Basic Skills Trainers; 
Missile Simulation Rounds; Security Assist-
ance Management Directorate Technical As-
sistance; Tactical Aviation and Ground Mu-
nitions Project Office Technical Assistance; 
other associated equipment and services; and 
other related elements of logistical and pro-
gram support. The estimated total cost is $30 
million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of Georgia 
which is a strategic partner and a key con-
tributor to security and stability the region. 
The Javelin system will help Georgia build 
its long-term defense capacity to defend its 
sovereignty and territorial integrity in order 
to meet its national defense requirements. 
The proposed sale will improve Georgia’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by increasing its anti-armor capac-
ity. Georgia will have no difficulty absorbing 
these weapons into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The prime contractors will be Raytheon/ 
Lockheed Martin Javelin Joint Venture of 
Orlando, Florida, and Tucson, Arizona. How-
ever, these articles are being provided from 
U.S. Army stock. There are no known offset 
agreements proposed in conjunction with 
this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any U.S. Gov-
ernment or contractor representatives to 
Georgia. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–48 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Javelin Weapon System is a me-
dium-range, 
man 
portable, 
shoulder- 
launched, fire and forget, anti-tank system 
for infantry, scouts, and combat engineers. 
It may also be mounted on a variety of plat-
forms 
including 
vehicles, 
aircraft 
and 
watercraft. The system weighs 49.5 pounds 
and has a maximum range in excess of 2,500 
meters. The system is highly lethal against 
tanks and other systems with conventional 
and reactive armors. The system possesses a 
secondary capability against bunkers. 
2. Javelin’s key technical feature is the use 
of fire-and-forget technology, which allows 
the gunner to fire and immediately relocate 
or take cover. Additional special features are 
the top attack and/or direct fire modes, an 
advanced tandem warhead and imaging in-
frared seeker, target lock-on before launch, 
and soft launch from enclosures or covered 
fighting positions. The Javelin missile also 
has a minimum smoke motor, thus decreas-
ing its detection on the battlefield. 
3. The Javelin Weapon System is com-
prised of two major tactical components, 
which are a reusable Command Launch Unit 
(CLU) and a round contained in a disposable 
launch tube assembly. The CLU incorporates 
an integrated day-night sight that provides a 
target engagement capability in adverse 
weather and countermeasure environments. 
The CLU may also be used in a stand-alone 
mode for battlefield surveillance and target 
detection. The CLU’s thermal sight is a sec-
ond generation Forward Looking Infrared 
(FLIR) sensor. To facilitate initial loading 
and subsequent updating of software, all on- 
board missile software is uploaded via the 
CLU after mating and prior to launch. 
4. The missile is autonomously guided to 
the target using an imaging infrared seeker 
and adaptive correlation tracking algo-
rithms. This allows the gunner to take cover 
or reload and engage another target after fir-
ing a missile. The missile has an advanced 
tandem warhead and can be used in either 
the top attack or direct fire modes (for tar-
get undercover). An onboard flight computer 
guides the missile to the selected target. 
5. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
6. If a technologically advanced adversary 
obtains knowledge of the specific hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems that might reduce weap-
on system effectiveness or be used in the de-
velopment of a system with similar or ad-
vanced capabilities. 
7. A determination has been made that 
Georgia can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
8. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Geor-
gia.

rica. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity of the United States by helping to im-
prove the security of NATO allies and part-
ner nations that are an important force for 
ensuring peace and stability in Europe.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6487 
September 14, 2021 
Greece has demonstrated a continued com-
mitment to modernizing its military and 
will have no difficultly absorbing this addi-
tional sustainment support into its armed 
forces. 
The proposed sale of these services will not 
alter the basic military balance in the re-
gion. 
The principal contractors for this proposed 
sale are L3/Harris International, Melbourne, 
Florida; Lockheed-Martin Aero Corporation, 
Fort Worth, Texas; Collins Aerospace, Char-
lotte, North Carolina; Northrop Grumman 
Corporation, 
Falls 
Church, 
Virginia; 
Raytheon Company, Waltham, Massachu-
setts; 
and 
Atec, 
Incorporated, 
Houston, 
Texas. The purchaser typically requests off-
sets. Any offset agreement will be defined in 
negotiations between the purchaser and the 
contractor(s). 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives outside the United States. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Export Control Act. 
POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Japan—AEGIS Class Destroyer Support 
The Government of Japan has requested to 
buy Follow-On Technical Support (FOTS) of 
AEGIS 
Class 
Destroyers, 
to 
include 
sustainment support and services; AEGIS 
computer software updates, system integra-
tion and testing, in-country and on-site engi-
neering 
support; 
familiarization,

This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a major ally that is a force for polit-
ical stability and economic progress in the 
Asia-Pacific region. It is vital to U.S. na-
tional interest to assist Japan in developing 
and maintaining a strong and effective self- 
defense capability. 
The proposed sale is critical to ensure 
Japan 
Maritime 
Self 
Defense 
Force’s 
(JMSDF) Aegis Destroyer fleet and the Japa-
nese Computer Program Test Sites (JCPTS) 
remain ready to provide capabilities in the 
defense of Japan. Specifically, the requested 
CPM services will provide JMSDF with soft-
ware patches and adaptation data support 
that are vital to the effective and safe oper-
ations of the Aegis Combat Systems (ACS) 
suite. The in-country engineering and emer-
gent support will assist JMSDF to address 
any malfunctions or faults that may arise 
with the ACS suite. Japan will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing these services and support 
into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment will 
not alter the basic military balance in the 
region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin Corporation, Moorestown, NJ. There 
are no known offset agreements proposed in 
connection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
require the temporary assignment of five (5) 
U.S. Government and two (2) contractor rep-
resentatives to Japan. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–44 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Paladin M109A6 howitzer is the fifth 
product improvement to the original M109 
self-propelled howitzer. It features improve-
ments in the areas of survivability; reli-
ability, availability, and maintainability 
(RAM); responsiveness; and terminal effects. 
The M109A6 is an armored, full tracked how-
itzer carrying 37 complete conventional 
rounds and two Copperhead projectiles and is 
operated by a crew of four. It is designed 
with a new turret structure that facilitates 
integration of the various turret improve-
ments and vulnerability reduction measures. 
It improves overall crew compartment lay-
out and space. The howitzer can travel at a 
maximum speed of 38 miles per hour and has 
a maximum cruising range of 186 miles. The 
M109A6 can operate independently, on the 
move, it can receive a fire mission, compute 
firing data, select and take up its firing posi-
tion, automatically unlock and point its can-
non, fire and move—all without external 
technical assistance. Firing the first round 
following a move in under 60 seconds, a 
‘‘shoot and scoot’’ capability protects the 
crew from counterbattery fire. The M109A6 is 
capable of firing up to four rounds per 
minute to ranges of 30 kilometers. The 
M109A6 
features 
increased 
survivability 
characteristics such as day/night operability, 
Nuclear, Biological, Chemical (NBC) protec-
tion with climate control and secure voice 
and digital communications. The crew re-
mains in the vehicle throughout the mission. 
2. The Inertial Navigation Unit (INU) com-
ponent provides the vehicle with its own po-
sition location utilizing sensors that con-
tinuously calculates its direction and veloc-
ity without the continuous dependency of a 
GPS; the INU receives GPS data from an ex-
ternal GPS receiver as an input when avail-
able to provide better precision. The INU al-
lows the vehicle to more precisely calculate 
its position to other components in the vehi-
cle to improve its functions and safety of 
use; these functions include movement and 
maneuver of the vehicle, movement of the 
turret, and pointing of the gun tube. 
3. The Electronic Fire Control System 
(EFCS) commonly referred to as the Paladin 
Fire Control System (PFCS) is the major 
change for the Paladin M109A6 Howitzer 
from the manual fire control system used on 
the M109A5. This gives the howitzer the abil-
ity to operate over a widely dispersed area 
and to move and emplace using the on board 
fire control navigation and GPS system. The 
MI09A6 can move and position within an as-
signed position area, process technical firing 
data, and fire a mission without relying on 
aiming circles and wire lines. The M109A6 
can change position more frequently, an ad-
vantage against enemy fire. Such advance-
ments give new meaning to the artillery’s 
ability to move, shoot and communicate. In 
addition, the EFCS with embedded elec-
tronic diagnostics improves maintenance 
and repair functions by assisting in pin-
pointing faults. 
4. The Defense Advanced GPS (Global Posi-
tioning System) Receiver (DAGR) is a light-
weight (less than 2 pounds) hand-held or host 
platform-mounted, dual frequency (L1/L2), 
Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module 
(SAASM) based, Precise Positioning Service 
(PPS) device that receives and decodes the 
L1 and L2 signals-in-space which are trans-
mitted by the NAVSTAR GPS satellite con-
stellation. The DAGR provides real-time po-
sitioning, velocity (ground speed), naviga-
tion, and timing (PVNT) information, in 
standalone 
(dismounted) 
and 
mounted 
(ground facilities, sea, air, and land vehicles) 
configurations. The DAGR can support mis-
sions involving land-based war-fighting and 
non-war fighting operations. The DAGR can 
also be used as a secondary or supplemental 
aid to aviation-based missions which involve 
operations in low-dynamic aircraft, and as 
an aid to navigation in water-borne oper-
ations. 
5. The M1156 Precision Guidance Kit (PGK) 
is a Global Positioning System (GPS) Guid-
ance Kit with fuzing functions for the M795 
and M549A1 155mm High Explosive (HE) Ar-
tillery Projectiles. The PGK corrects the bal-
listic trajectory of the projectile to reduce 
delivery errors and thus improves projectile 
accuracy. The PGK will effectively reduce 
target delivery error of conventional artil-
lery munitions and reduce the number of 
projectiles required to execute a fire mis-
sion. 
6. The 155mm M232Al Propelling Charge 
(DODIC DA13), will be used in M109 series 
howitzers. The Modular Artillery Charge 
System (MACS) consists of two propelling 
charge module types, the M231 and the M232/ 
M232A1, and their associated packaging. The 
system is compatible with all current and 
planned 155mm field artillery weapons. 
7. The M82 Percussion Primer (DODIC 
N523) will be used in M109 series howitzers. 
8. The International Field Artillery Tac-
tical Data System is the international ex-
port version of the Army’s Advanced Field 
Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). 
It provides networked and fully automated 
support for the planning, coordination, con-
trol, and execution of fires and effects such 
as mortars, field artillery, rockets and mis-
siles, and close air support. International 
versions are developed for each customer 
unique to the weapon and targeting systems 
in their inventory. 
9. Field Artillery Ammunition Support Ve-
hicle (FAASV) M992A2 this ammunition ve-
hicle has no turret, but has a taller super-
structure to store 95 rounds with a cor-
responding number of powders and primers. 
Until recently, much of the remaining inter-
nal crew space was taken up by a hydrau-
lically powered conveyor system designed to 
allow the quick uploading of rounds or their 
transfer to the M109-series howitzer. 
10. Heavy Equipment Recovery Combat 
Utility Lift and Evacuation System (HER-
CULES) Improved Recovery Vehicle—M88A2

moves and replaces tank turrets and power 
packs, and uprights overturned heavy com-
bat vehicles. The main winch of the M88A2 is 
capable of a 70-ton, single-line recovery, al-
lowing the HERCULES to provide recovery 
of the 70-Ton M1A2 Abrams Tank. 
11. The A-frame boom and hoist winch of 
the M88A2 can lift 35 tons. The spade can be 
used to anchor the vehicle when using the 
main winch and can be used for light earth 
moving to prepare a recovery area. The 
M88A2 employs an auxiliary power unit to 
provide auxiliary electrical and hydraulic 
power when the main engine is not in oper-
ation. It can also be used to slave start other 
vehicles, as well as a means to refuel or 
defuel 
vehicles. 
The 
M88A2 
can 
refuel 
Abrams tanks from its own fuel tank. 
12. The Browning M2 is an air-cooled, belt- 
fed machine gun. The M2 fires from a closed 
bolt, operated on the short recoil principle. 
The M2 fires the .50 BMG cartridge, which of-
fers long range, accuracy, and immense stop-
ping power. 
13. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
14. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems, which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
15. A determination has been made that 
the recipient can provide substantially the 
same degree of protection for the sensitive 
technology being released as the U.S. Gov-
ernment. This sale is necessary in further-
ance of the U.S. foreign policy and national 
security objectives outlined in the Policy 
Justification. 
16. All defense articles and services listed 
in this transmittal have been authorized for 
release and export to the recipient.

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Australia—Defense Services Related to 
Future Standard Missile Production 
The Government of Australia has re-
quested to buy defense services related to 
the future purchase of Standard Missile 6 
Block I (SM–6) and Standard Missile 2 Block 
IIIC (SM–2 IIIC) missiles. These services in-
clude development; engineering, integration, 
and testing (EI&T); obsolescence engineering 
activities required to ensure readiness; U.S. 
Government 
and 
contractor 
engineering/ 
technical assistance, and related studies and 
analysis support; technical and logistics sup-
port services; and other related elements of 
program and logistical support. The total es-
timated value is $350 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States. Australia is one of our 
most important allies in the Western Pa-
cific. Australia is strategically positioned to 
contribute significantly to ensuring peace 
and economic stability in the region. It is 
vital to the U.S. national interest to assist 
our ally in developing and maintaining a 
strong and ready self-defense capability. 
The proposed sale will support the readi-
ness and future sale of vital anti-air warfare 
capability that can be deployed from Aus-
tralia’s 
newest 
Hunter-Class 
Destroyers 
equipped with the latest AEGIS Combat Sys-
tems. The purchase of Standard Missile 6 
Block I (SM–6) and Standard Missile 2 Block 
IIIC (SM–2 IIIC) missiles is currently in-
cluded in Australia’s procurement roadmap 
and will improve their ability to operate 
alongside 
U.S. 
and 
Allied 
naval 
forces 
against the full spectrum of naval threats. 
Australia will have no difficulty absorbing 
these defense services into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal U.S. contractor will be 
Raytheon Missiles and Defense (RMD), Tuc-
son, AZ. There are no known offset agree-
ments proposed in connection with this po-
tential sale. 
Implementation of the proposed sale will 
require U.S. Government and contractor per-
sonnel to visit Australia on a temporary 
basis in conjunction with program technical 
oversight and support requirements, includ-
ing program and technical reviews. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

transfer of sensitive and classified technical 
data related to obsolescence engineering, in-
tegration, and test activities required to en-
sure readiness for the future procurement of 
Standard Missile 6 Block I (SM–6) and Stand-
ard Missile 2 Block IIIC (SM–2 IIIC) missiles. 
No SM–6 Blk I or SM–2 IIIC hardware or soft-
ware will be transferred under this proposed 
sale. Australia currently employs SM–2 
Block IIIA and IIIB on Royal Australian 
Navy (RAN) AEGIS surface combatants, and 
has been afforded access to similar technical 
information for these delivered systems. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary

stantially the same degree of protection for 
the sensitive technology being released as 
the U.S. Government. This sale is necessary 
in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and 
national security objectives outlined in the

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Korea—Precision Guided Munitions 
The Republic of Korea has requested to 
buy three thousand nine hundred fifty-three 
(3,953) Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) 
Guidance Kits, KMU–556 for GBU–31; one 
thousand nine hundred eighty-one (1,981) 
JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU–557 for GBU–31, 
GBU–56; one thousand one hundred seventy- 
nine (1,179) JDAM Guidance Kits, KMU–572 
for GBU–38; and one thousand seven hundred 
fifty-five (1,755) FMU–139 Fuze Systems. Also 
included are DSU–42/B Detectors, Laser Illu-
minated Target for GBU–56; weapon spare 
parts, components and accessories; weapons 
training aids, devices, and spare parts; U.S. 
Government and contractor 
engineering, 
technical assistance, and logistical support 
services; and other related elements of 
logistical and program support. The esti-
mated total cost is $258 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by helping to improve 
the security of a Major Non-NATO ally that 
continues to be an important force for polit-
ical stability, peace, and economic progress 
in the Indo-Pacific region. 
The proposed sale will improve the Repub-
lic of Korea’s capability to meet current and 
future threats by increasing available stores 
of munitions on the Korean Peninsula in 
support 
of 
Alliance 
Operations 
Plans 
(OPLANs), as well as to fulfill conditions 
outlined by the Condition-Based Operational 
Control (OPCON) Transition Plan. The Re-
public of Korea will have no difficulty ab-
sorbing these articles into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Boeing 
Corporation, St Louis, Missouri. There are 
no known offset agreements proposed in con-
nection with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the Republic of Korea. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 21–54 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act 
Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The Joint Direct Attack Munition 
(JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts ex-
isting unguided free-fall bombs into an accu-
rate, adverse weather ‘‘smart’’ munition. 
The Guidance Set consists of a Tail Kit, 
which contains the Inertial Navigation Sys-
tem (INS) and a Global Positioning System 
(GPS), a set of Aerosurfaces and an umbilical 
cover, which allows the JDAM to improve 
the accuracy of unguided, General Purpose 
bombs. The JDAM weapon can be delivered 
from modest standoff ranges at high or low 
altitudes against a variety of land and sur-
face targets during the day or night. The 
JDAM is capable of receiving target coordi-
nates via preplanned mission data from the 
delivery aircraft, by onboard aircraft sensors 
(i.e., FLIR, Radar, etc.) during captive carry, 
or from a third-party source via manual or 
automated aircrew cockpit entry. The Guid-
ance Set, when combined with a warhead and 
appropriate fuze, forms a JDAM Guided 
Bomb Unit (GBU). 
(a) The KMU–572 is the tail kit for a GBU– 
38 500LB JDAM. 
(b) The KMU–556 is the tail kit for a GBU– 
31 2,000LB Mk–84 (General Purpose bomb 
body) JDAM. 
(c) The KMU–557 is the tail kit for a GBU– 
31/–56 2,000LB BLU–109 (General Purpose 
bomb body) JDAM. 
2. The Laser JDAM (GBU–56) is a 2,000LB 
JDAM that incorporates all the capabilities 
of the JDAM guidance tail kit and adds a 
DSU–42/B precision laser guidance set. The 
DSU–42/B sensor gives the weapon system an 
optional semi-active laser seeker. The addi-
tion of the DSU–42/B laser sensor combined 
with additional cabling and mounting hard-
ware turns a GBU–31 JDAM into a GBU–56 
LJDAM. The DSU–42/B consists of a laser 
spot tracker, a cable connecting the DSU–42/ 
B to the basic JDAM guidance set, a cable 
cover, cable cover tie-down straps, modified 
tail kit door and wiring harness, and associ-
ated modified JDAM software that incor-
porates navigation and guidance flight soft-
ware to support both LJDAM and standard 
JDAM missions. The DSU–42/B adds the 
flexibility to strike targets of opportunity, 
including mobile and moving targets, to an 
already accurate adverse weather GPS/INS 
guided JDAM. 
3. The Joint Programmable Fuze (JPF) 
FMU–139D/B is a multi-delay, multi-arm and 
proximity sensor compatible with general 
purpose blast, frag and hardened-target pene-
trator weapons. The JPF settings are cock-
pit selectable in flight when used numerous 
precision-guided weapons. It can interface 
with the following weapons: GBU–31, GBU–38, 
and GBU–56. 
4. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
5. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
6. A determination has been made that the 
Republic of Korea can provide substantially 
the same degree of protection for the sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S. 
Government. This sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
7. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Republic of Korea.

(i) Purchaser: Government of Spain. 
(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 
10–60; Date: September 29, 2010; Military De-
partment: Navy. 
(iii) Description: On September 29, 2010, 
Congress was notified by Congressional cer-
tification transmittal number 10–60, of the 
possible sale under Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act of (6) SH–60F 
Multi-Mission Utility Helicopters being of-
fered as Excess Defense Articles, (13) T700– 
GE–401C engines (12 installed and 1 spare), 
inspection and modifications, spare and re-
pairs parts, support equipment, personnel 
training and training equipment, publica-
tions and technical documentation, U.S. 
Government and contractor engineering, 
technical, and logistics support services, and 
other related logistics and program support. 
The estimated total cost was $155 million. 
Major Defense Equipment (MDE) constituted 
$47 million of this total. 
On July 28, 2017, Congress was notified by 
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber 0K–17 of the inclusion of four (4) Embed-
ded Global Positioning Units/Inertial Navi-
gation Systems (EGI) with GPS Selective 
Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 
and three (3) AN/AAR–47E(V)2 (one (1) for 
each aircraft and one (1) spare). The EGIs 
and AN/AAR–47E(V)2 were MDE. Also in-
cluded were two (2) CPS Anti-Jam System 
(GAS–1), two (2) Missile Warning System sets 
with certification and installation in each 
aircraft, and three (3) AN/ALE–47 Counter-
measure Dispensing Systems (one (1) for 
each aircraft and one (1) spare) along with 
integration, certification, and installation 
on each aircraft. These items were to be used 
to equip two (2) of the six (6) total EDA SH– 
60 helicopters. The inclusion of these MDE 
items did not result in a change to the esti-
mated MDE value of $47 million. The total 
estimated case value remained $155 million. 
On June 26, 2018, Congress was notified by 
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber 0J–18 of the inclusion of eight (8) Embed-
ded Global Positioning Units/Inertial Navi-
gation Systems (EGI) with GPS Selective 
Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) 
and four (4) AN/AAR–47E Missile Warning 
Systems (MWS) (MDE items). Also included 
were four (4) GPS Anti-Jam Systems (GAS– 
1), four (4) AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dis-
pensing Systems and eight (8) AN/ARC– 
210(V) RT–1990A(C) radios. These items were 
to be used to equip the remaining four (4) of 
the original six (6) total EDA SH–60F heli-
copters. The estimated value of the addi-
tional MDE items was $4.26 million, but the 
addition did not result in a change to the es-
timated MDE value of $47 million. The total 
estimated case value remained $155 million. 
On November 16, 2018, Congress was noti-
fied by Congressional certification trans-
mittal number 0T–18 of the inclusion of four 
(4) additional EDA SH–60F helicopters (two 
flyable/two 
spares 
non-flying), 
including 
eight (8) T700–GE–401C engines (installed). 
Two (2) aircraft were to be equipped with the 
following additional systems: four (4) EGIs 
with GPS SAASM, two (2) AN/AAR–47E MWS 
(both items MDE); two (2) GAS–1s, two (2) 
AN/ALE–47 Countermeasure Dispensing Sys-
tems, 
and 
four 
(4) 
AN/ARC–210(V) 
RT– 
1990A(C) radios. The estimated value of the 
additional MDE items was $11.6 million, but 
the addition did not result in a change to the 
estimated MDE value of $47 million. The 
total estimated case value remained $155 
million. 
On May 21, 2019, Congress was notified by 
Congressional certification transmittal num-
ber 0K–19 of an increase in total case value 
that had not been recently reevaluated. The 
total case value increase was based on the 
following factors. The previous value was 
calculated before the open and inspect phase 
of the first aircraft. As retired aircraft 
stored at the Aerospace Maintenance and Re-
generation Group (AMARG), Spain’s aircraft 
contained more damage that could be discov-
ered only during a full teardown and inspec-
tion, and the last aircraft had been demili-
tarized and assessed in overall poor condi-
tion with a planned date to be shredded. Re-
turning these aircraft to flight condition re-
quired extensive work and greater expense 
than anticipated. There was also a cost in-
crease to provide for return-and-repair serv-
ices, engineering hours, and spare parts. No 
additional MDE was added and the estimated 
MDE value remained $47 million. The esti-
mated additional non-MDE value increased 
by $61 million. The total estimated case 
value increased to $216 million. 
On January 14, 2020, Congress was notified 
by Congressional certification transmittal 
number 0A–20 of an additional four (4) Em-
bedded 
Global 
Positioning 
Units/Inertial 
Navigation Systems (EGIs) with GPS Selec-
tive 
Availability 
Anti-Spoofing 
Module 
(SAASM). The estimated MDE value was $1 
million, for a total estimated MDE value of 
$48 million. The total estimated case value 
increased to $217 million. 
This transmittal reports the inclusion of 
additional MDE articles and services that 
were not previously notified: Three (3) 
7.62MM M240D Machine Guns. The total esti-
mated MDE value will increase to $48.7 mil-
lion. The total estimated case value will in-
crease to $217.7 million. 
(iv) Significance: This notification is being 
provided as the additional MDE items were 
not enumerated in the original notification. 
The inclusion of this MDE represents an in-
crease in capability over what was pre-
viously notified. The proposed articles and 
services will augment the Spanish Navy’s 
multi-mission, multi-role helicopters to per-
form humanitarian missions, search and res-
cue, medical evacuations, firefighting, and 
anti-piracy efforts. 
(v) Justification: This proposed sale will 
support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity of the United States by improving the 
security of a NATO ally which is an impor-
tant force for political stability and eco-
nomic progress in Europe. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The 7.62MM 
M240D Machine Gun is a belt-fed, gas oper-
ated medium machine gun that chambers the 
7.62x51mm NATO cartridge. The M240D has 
two configurations, both aircraft mounted 
and egress kit designed to provide downed 
aircrew personnel with increased firepower. 
The highest level of classification of defense 
articles, components, and services included 
in this potential sale is UNCLASSIFIED. 
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: 
September 7, 2021.

NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION 
DAY 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in honor 
of the observation of National POW/ 
MIA Recognition Day this September 
17, 2021, I join in raising awareness 
about the more than 81,600 Americans 
the 
Defense 
POW/MIA 
Accounting 
Agency, DPAA, reports remain missing 
from World War II, the Korean war, the 
Vietnam war, the Cold war, the gulf 
wars, and other conflicts. Thank you to 
the members of the POW*MIA Aware-
ness Rally Corp. of Pocatello, ID, and 
other similar groups for their unwaver-
ing commitment to keeping the need 
to 
bring 
all 
missing 
American 
servicemembers home at the forefront 
of our national focus. 
Etched on the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier at Arlington National Ceme-
tery are the words, ‘‘Here Rests In Hon-
ored 
Glory 
An 
American 
Soldier 
Known But To God.’’ The tribute 
prompts reflection on the American 
servicemembers, many also in graves 
known but to God, who have not yet 
been identified or returned home. This 
year marks 100 years since the first un-
known soldier, a World War I veteran, 
was interred at the tomb. Over the cen-
tury since, a World War II, a Korean 
war, and a Vietnam war veteran were 
also laid to rest in the tomb. Following 
the identification and exhumation of 
the 
interred 
Vietnam 
veteran 
Air 
Force First Lieutenant Michael Joseph 
Blassie, the empty crypt was rededi-
cated 
to 
honor 
American 
servicemembers who remain missing in 
Southeast Asia. 
The DPAA reports 75 percent of lost 
Americans are located in the Indo-Pa-
cific, and more than 41,000 of the miss-
ing are presumed lost at sea. My heart 
remains with the families of the miss-
ing and those working tirelessly, often 
through significant challenges to get 
needed answers, to bring them home. 
Despite the difficulty, the DPAA has 
reported accounting for more than 100 
of America’s missing since the start of 
this year. This includes Navy Fireman 
2nd Class Carl M. Bradley who was

killed in action aboard the USS Okla-
homa on December 7, 1941. He was re-
turned to rest in his hometown of Shel-
ley, ID, earlier this year. 
To support these efforts, work con-
tinues toward reintroducing the Bring 
Our Heroes Home Act to provide a 
more efficient process for accessing 
records needed for recovery efforts of 
missing servicemembers. We can never 
let up in bringing home all our Na-
tion’s heroes, including the 358 Ida-
hoans, who have yet to be returned. 
Our country’s dedication to bringing 
our lost servicemembers home must 
mirror the precision, stamina, for-
mality and respect with which The Old 
Guard unwaveringly protects the Tomb 
of the Unknown Soldier. They reso-
lutely honor our Nation’s unidentified 
and missing servicemembers, as we 
must in steadily pressing forward to 
get answers for the families who await 
their return.

TRIBUTE TO MARCUS GAMBLE 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, I wish 
today to honor Marcus Earl Gamble, a 
member of my Senate staff who has de-
parted to explore exciting opportuni-
ties in the great State of Wisconsin. 
Marcus, who is from Eagle River, AK, 
has been an invaluable member of my 
Senate staff since May of 2018. Marcus 
is the son of Tonya and Brad Gamble, 
who recently left Alaska for sunny Ari-
zona. After attending Chugiak High 
School, Marcus graduated from the 
University of Montana in 2018 with 
bachelor of arts degree in political 
science. 
I first met Marcus in the summer of 
2016, when he served as an intern in my 
Washington, DC office. He immediately 
distinguished himself with his incred-
ible positive attitude and his ever- 
present smile. He lit up every room he 
entered and he soon became a staple of 
the front office and was lauded by 
many Alaskan visitors for his friendly, 
informative banter during tours of the 
U.S. Capitol. 
Following his graduation from the 
University of Montana, Marcus joined 
my Senate staff as a staff assistant. He 
quickly became a staff favorite, seem-
ing to never have a bad day as he took 
calls and greeted visitors to the office. 
Marcus quickly earned additional re-
sponsibility, eventually becoming the 
internship coordinator and systems ad-
ministrator. 
The COVID–19 pandemic showed us 
all how vital Marcus is to my office. In 
a matter of hours, he had every staff 
member outfitted with equipment and 
made sure everyone was connected and 
ready to work. Thanks to Marcus, my 
office didn’t miss a beat and was able 
to continue to serve Alaska. 
In addition to being an effective 
member of my staff, Marcus is a trust-
ed colleague. His high regard for his 
fellow Alaskans is evident in the excel-
lent service he has provided to my staff 
and the public. His can-do, positive at-
titude and his know-how for all things 
big and small is greatly missed. 
My staff and I will miss Marcus 
greatly, but are sure he will continue 
to be a brilliant example of Alaska’s 
indomitable spirit. Thank you, Marcus, 
for your outstanding service and best 
of luck as you start this new chapter in 
life.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SENIOR MASTER 
SERGEANT JEREMY MAYO 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize SMSGT Jeremy 
Mayo who has earned the Military 
Times 2021 Airman of the Year award 
after a remarkable 19 years of military 
service. 
Jeremy Mayo is a proud Arkansan 
who has dedicated his life to protecting 
and defending his country. Mayo grew 
up hearing stories about his grand-
father’s 20 years in the military and 
says it had a big influence in his life 
and served as his inspiration to join 
the Armed Forces. 
In his 10 deployments, he has handled 
a variety of crucial operations from 
dropping personnel to refilling heli-
copters, as well as resupply, infiltra-
tion, and exfiltration missions. He was 
initially drawn to the position for its 
unpredictability and the opportunity 
to work with some of the top military 
groups from a variety of branches. 
Mayo has demonstrated, time and time 
again, the grit and work ethic so cru-
cial to the success of members of our 
military. To Mayo, the most important 
part of his job was simply to get the 
crew and the team he was supporting 
in and out and to get them home safe-
ly. 
Mayo praised the U.S. Air Force for 
instilling in him important traits such 
as leadership, saying the roles he has 
taken on forced him to really step up. 
As a Special Operations Command 
loadmaster, Mayo had been trained to 
roll with the punches, so when the 
coronavirus pandemic hit, he did just 
that. 
Mayo recognized the significance of 
the chemical aircrew survivability bar-
rier, a tent-like, air-filtering structure 
for C–130 airframes. He then helped de-
velop plans to utilize this tool during 
the pandemic, making special oper-
ations crews increasingly self-suffi-
cient and mobile in dangerous medical 
evacuations. 
His quick thinking and creativity in 
repurposing this chemical and biologi-
cal contamination tent to protect 
troops from the coronavirus earned 
him this prestigious award and, more 
importantly, has helped protect count-
less servicemembers. 
While the pandemic presented a vari-
ety of challenges, Senior Master Ser-
geant Mayo clearly demonstrated his 
perseverance in the face of adversity. 
He deployed to three different regions 
of the world and served as the senior 
enlisted leader in an exercise that 
trained French special operations heli-
copter crews on refueling and seizure 
skills to prepare for combat in Africa. 
I applaud SMSGT Jeremy Mayo for 
his outstanding commitment and dedi-
cation to our Nation. He richly de-
serves this recognition for his inge-
nuity and determination, and we are 
proud of this Arkansan’s distinguished 
record of service on behalf of our coun-
try. I commend him for all his efforts 
that have culminated in this honor and 
express my gratitude for his leadership 
and example.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING STATE AUTO 
INSURANCE COMPANIES 
∑ Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize the 100-year anni-
versary of the founding of State Auto 
Insurance Companies. 
Founded with $30,000 in borrowed 
funds by Robert S. Pein in 1921, the 
State Automobile Mutual Insurance 
Association had three employees in a 
rented room at 257 East Broad Street 
in Columbus, OH. 
Pein believed that the insurance in-
dustry at the time was ripe for im-
provement to customer service and in-
creased affordability. The company’s 
early mission statement was ‘‘Prompt 
and Satisfactory Service in the Settle-
ment of All Claims and operated by a 
golden rule of ‘‘do unto others as you 
would have them do unto you.’’ Those 
guiding principles remain to this day. 
State Auto’s geographic footprint ex-
panded as the company entered new 
States and acquired or affiliated with 
companies throughout the country. 
Today, the company offers products in 
33 States. State Auto has grown stead-
ily and now is among the 40 largest 
property and casualty insurance com-
panies in the United States. 
Throughout its history, State Auto 
has been an innovator in the insurance 
industry. The company introduced the 
industry’s first auto insurance pay-
ment plan and recently transformed 
into an entirely digital provider of 
auto, home, and business insurance. 
This required a transformation not 
only of its technology but also of its 
products and culture. State Auto’s cul-
ture is open and inclusive, with a belief 
that every voice is important. Feeling 
comfortable, even obligated, to speak 
up, challenge, and disagree is critical. 
It is an impressive feat for a com-
pany to reach its 100th anniversary. 
State Auto has reached this milestone 
while being a great community partner 
in central Ohio. 
I wish State Auto Insurance Compa-
nies a future of continued success.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself and 
Ms. WARREN): 
S. 2730. A bill to direct the Secretary 
of Education to establish a pilot grant 
program to develop, implement, and 
evaluate comprehensive mental health 
services 
programs 
in 
elementary 
schools and secondary schools, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the ‘‘Comprehen-
sive Mental Health in Schools Pilot 
Program Act of 2021,’’ which I intro-
duced today. 
Millions of children and adolescents 
across the Nation struggle every day 
with mental health concerns 
that 
threaten their emotional well-being 
and academic achievement. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has under-
scored the need for comprehensive 
school mental health systems that can 
provide the support and services that 
students desperately need. 
This bill is a targeted effort to ad-
dress the worsening mental health cri-
sis in this country. If enacted, this leg-
islation would help schools as they 
work to promote positive school cli-
mates, improve social and emotional 
learning, and reduce the prevalence 
and severity of mental illness. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention 
reported 
that 
between 
March and October of 2020, the propor-
tion of children between the ages of 5 
and 11 who visited an emergency de-
partment because of a mental health 
crisis climbed 24 percent compared to 
the same time period in 2019, and 
climbed 31 percent for children between 
the ages of 12 and 17. More people are 
reporting frequent thoughts of suicide 
and self-harm than have ever been re-
corded. The full effects of increased 
learning loss, social isolation, uncer-
tainty, and trauma may not manifest 
for years, and schools must be prepared 
to deal with this preventatively. 
That is why I am proud to introduce 
this bill, which would direct the Sec-
retary of Education to establish a $20 
million 4-year pilot grant program to 
help schools serving low-income stu-
dents address mental and behavioral 
wellbeing, as well as academic, cog-
nitive, and social and emotional devel-
opment, through multi-tier, evidence- 
based interventions that foster positive 
learning environments. More specifi-
cally, this funding may be used for pro-
viding professional development oppor-
tunities, encouraging restorative poli-
cies, establishing racially, culturally, 
and linguistically appropriate trauma- 
informed practices, and hiring more 
school-based mental and behavioral 
health professionals. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Representative 
DAVID TRONE for introducing this bill 
with me, and I hope our colleagues will 
join us in support of this solution to 
our youth mental health crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S6501 
September 14, 2021 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor. 
By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Ms. 
WARREN, 
Mr. 
MARKEY, 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. 
CRUZ, 
Mr. 
RUBIO, Mr. PADILLA, and Mr. 
CASEY): 
S. 2738. A bill to award a Congres-
sional Gold Medal to the United States 
Army Dustoff crews of the Vietnam 
War, collectively, in recognition of 
their extrodinary heroism and life-sav-
ing actions in Vietnam; to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to print my bill for 
introduction 
in 
the 
CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. The bill’s purpose is to award 
a Congressional Gold Medal to the 
United States Army Dustoff crews of 
the Vietnam War, collectively, in rec-
ognition of their extraordinary her-
oism and life-saving actions in Viet-
nam. 
S. 2738 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Dustoff 
Crews of the Vietnam War Congressional 
Gold Medal Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
The Congress finds that— 
(1) a United States Army Dustoff crewman 
(pilot, crew chief, and medic) is a helicopter 
crew member who served honorably during 
the Vietnam War aboard helicopter air am-
bulances, which were both non-division and 
division assets under the radio call signs 
‘‘Dustoff’’ and ‘‘Medevac’’; 
(2) Dustoff crews performed aeromedical 
evacuation for United States, Vietnamese, 
and allied forces in Southeast Asia from May 
1962 through March 1973; 
(3) nearing the end of World War II, the 
United States Army began using helicopters 
for medical evacuation and years later, dur-
ing the Korean War, these helicopter air am-
bulances were responsible for transporting 
17,700 United States casualties; 
(4) during the Vietnam War, with the use 
of helicopter air ambulances, United States 
Army Dustoff crews pioneered the concept of 
dedicated and rapid medical evacuation and 
transported almost 900,000 United States, 
South Vietnamese, and other allied sick and 
wounded, as well as wounded enemy forces; 
(5) helicopters proved to be a revolutionary 
tool to assist those injured on the battle-
field; 
(6) highly skilled and intrepid, Dustoff 
crews were able to operate the helicopters 
and land them on almost any terrain in near-
ly any weather to pick up wounded, after 
which the Dustoff crews could provide care 
to these patients while transporting them to 
ready medical facilities; 
(7) the vital work of the Dustoff crews re-
quired consistent combat exposure and often 
proved to be the difference between life and 
death for wounded personnel; 
(8) the revolutionary concept of a dedi-
cated combat life-saving system was cul-
tivated and refined by United States Army 
Dustoff crews during 11 years of intense con-
flict in and above the jungles of Southeast 
Asia; 
(9) innovative and resourceful Dustoff 
crews in Vietnam were responsible for taking 
the new concept of helicopter medical evacu-
ation, born just a few years earlier, and revo-
lutionizing it to meet and surpass the pre-
viously unattainable goal of delivering a bat-
tlefield casualty to an operating table within 
the vaunted ‘‘golden hour’’; 
(10) some Dustoff units in Vietnam oper-
ated so efficiently that they were able to de-
liver a patient to a waiting medical facility 
on an average of 50 minutes from the receipt 
of the mission, which saved the lives of 
countless personnel in Vietnam, and this leg-
acy continues for modern-day Dustoff crews; 
(11) the inherent danger of being a member 
of a Dustoff crew in Vietnam meant that 
there was a 1 in 3 chance of being wounded or 
killed; 
(12) many battles during the Vietnam War 
raged at night, and members of the Dustoff 
crews often found themselves searching for a 
landing zone in complete darkness, in bad 
weather, over mountainous terrain, and all 
while being the target of intense enemy fire 
as they attempted to rescue the wounded, 
which caused Dustoff crews to suffer a rate 
of aircraft loss that was more than 3 times 
that of all other types of combat helicopter 
missions in Vietnam; 
(13) the 54th Medical Detachment typified 
the constant heroism displayed by Dustoff 
crews in Vietnam, over the span of a 10- 
month tour, with only 3 flyable helicopters 
and 40 soldiers in the unit, evacuating 21,435 
patients in 8,644 missions while being air-
borne for 4,832 hours; 
(14) collectively, the members of the 54th 
Medical Detachment earned 78 awards for 
valor, including 1 Medal of Honor, 1 Distin-
guished Service Cross, 14 Silver Star Medals, 
26 Distinguished Flying Crosses, 2 Bronze 
Star Medals for valor, 4 Air Medals for valor, 
4 Soldier’s Medals, and 26 Purple Heart Med-
als; 
(15) the 54th Medical Detachment displayed 
heroism on a daily basis and set the standard 
for all Dustoff crews in Vietnam; 
(16) 6 members of the 54th Medical Detach-
ment are in the Dustoff Hall of Fame, 3 are 
in the Army Aviation Hall of Fame, and 1 is 
the only United States Army aviator in the 
National Aviation Hall of Fame; 
(17) Dustoff crew members are among the 
most highly decorated soldiers in American 
military history; 
(18) in early 1964, Major Charles L. Kelly 
was the Commanding Officer of the 57th Med-
ical Detachment (Helicopter Ambulance), 
Provisional, in Soc Trang, South Vietnam; 
(19) Major Kelly helped to forge the Dustoff 
call sign into history as one of the most wel-
comed phrases to be heard over the radio by 
wounded soldiers in perilous and dire situa-
tions; 
(20) in 1964, Major Kelly was killed in ac-
tion as he gallantly maneuvered his aircraft 
to save a wounded American soldier and sev-
eral Vietnamese soldiers and boldly replied, 
after being warned to stay away from the 
landing zone due to the ferocity of enemy 
fire, ‘‘When I have your wounded.’’; 
(21) General William Westmoreland, Com-
mander, 
Military 
Assistance 
Command, 
Vietnam (1964–1968), singled out Major Kelly 
as an example of ‘‘the greatness of the 
human spirit’’ and highlighted his famous 
reply as an inspiration to all in combat; 
(22) General Creighton Abrams, Westmore-
land’s successor (1968–1972), and former Chief 
of Staff of the United States Army, high-
lighted the heroism of Dustoff crews, ‘‘A spe-
cial word about the Dustoffs . . . Courage 
above and beyond the call of duty was sort of 
routine to them. It was a daily thing, part of 
the way they lived. That’s the great part, 
and it meant so much to every last man who 
served there. Whether he ever got hurt or 
not, he knew Dustoff was there.’’; 
(23) Dustoff crews possessed unique skills 
and traits that made them highly successful 
in aeromedical evacuation in Vietnam, in-
cluding indomitable courage, extraordinary 
aviation skill and sound judgment under fire, 
high-level medical expertise, and an un-
equaled dedication to the preservation of 
human life; 
(24) members of the United States Armed 
Forces on the ground in Vietnam had their 
confidence and battlefield prowess reinforced 
knowing that there were heroic Dustoff 
crews just a few minutes from the fight, 
which was instrumental to their well-being, 
willingness to fight, and morale; 
(25) military families in the United States 
knew that their loved ones would receive the 
quickest and best possible care in the event 
of a war-time injury, thanks to the Dustoff 
crews; 
(26) the willingness of Dustoff crews to also 
risk their lives to save helpless civilians left 
an immeasurably positive impression on the 
people of Vietnam and exemplified the finest 
American ideals of compassion and human-
ity; and 
(27) Dustoff crews from the Vietnam War 
hailed from every State in the United States 
and represented numerous ethnic, religious, 
and cultural backgrounds.

SACRIFICE 
IN 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. HAWLEY (for himself and Mr. 
BLUNT) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 357 
Whereas Marine Corps Lance Corporal 
Jared Schmitz of Wentzville, Missouri, was a 
dear and loving son, brother, and friend, who 
sought constantly to lift those around him 
and care for others in need; 
Whereas Lance Corporal Schmitz was a de-
voted patriot who knew that he wanted to 
serve in the Marine Corps by his sophomore 
year of high school and trained relentlessly 
on his own initiative so that he might one 
day wear the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor; 
Whereas Lance Corporal Schmitz enlisted 
in the Marine Corps before his 18th birthday 
and went on to serve with gallantry as a Ma-
rine 
Corps 
infantryman, 
upholding 
the 
standards and traditions of all the brave 
service members from the State of Missouri 
who came before him; 
Whereas Lance Corporal Schmitz went to 
Kabul, Afghanistan, in August 2021 and, de-
spite the risks, demonstrated heroic commit-
ment to supporting the evacuation of citi-
zens of the United States, allies of the 
United States, partners of the United States, 
and innocent civilians; 
Whereas, on August 26, 2021, at just 20 
years of age, while serving alongside his fel-
low citizens to provide safe passage to those 
in need, Lance Corporal Schmitz made the 
ultimate sacrifice at the international air-
port in Kabul, giving his life so that others 
might live; and 
Whereas Lance Corporal Schmitz was the

mate sacrifice as part of Operation Enduring

ORING MR. STEVE VERETT FOR 
MORE THAN 24 YEARS OF DEDI-
CATED SERVICE TO THE COTTON 
INDUSTRY AND TO PLAINS COT-
TON GROWERS, INC. 
Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. 
CRUZ) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 358 
Whereas the Texas High Plains region is 
one of the largest cotton-producing regions 
in the world, and the sale of cotton brings 
more than $2.2 billion annually to the Texas 
economy; 
Whereas, since 1956, Plains Cotton Grow-
ers, Inc., has provided premier service and 
support to the cotton industry in the High 
Plains region on matters including research, 
market development, and public policy at 
both the State and Federal levels; 
Whereas Steve Verett has served as the 
chief executive officer since 1997, being only 
the third person to hold this role since 
Plains Cotton Growers, Inc.’s formation in 
1956; 
Whereas throughout his 24 years of service, 
Steve Verett’s leadership has established an 
environment that encourages organizational 
staff and volunteer leaders to continually 
find ways to improve the organization in 
order to meet the unique challenges that 
face the region’s cotton economy; and 
Whereas Steve Verett has been a dedicated 
policy advocate for Plains Cotton Growers, 
Inc., and the cotton industry, working on 
countless legislative and regulatory efforts, 
including the development of four farm bills, 
Federal crop insurance reform, and numer-
ous ad hoc assistance programs, and one of 
the most notable efforts where he played a 
central role was getting cotton back into 
title I of the 2018 Farm Bill: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commends Steve Verett for his lifelong 
dedication and service to the cotton industry 
and to Plains Cotton Growers, Inc.;

erable achievements during his tenure as

TIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS 
Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. 
BURR) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 359 
Whereas the designation of an organization 
as a Foreign Terrorist Organization ‘‘play[s] 
a critical role in our fight against terrorism 
and [is] an effective means of curtailing sup-
port for terrorist activities’’, according to 
the Department of State; 
Whereas, under section 219 of the Immigra-
tion and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189), the 
Secretary of State may designate an organi-
zation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization if 
the organization is a foreign organization, 
the organization engages in terrorist activ-
ity or retains the capability and intent to 
engage in terrorist activity or terrorism, and 
the terrorist activity or terrorism of the or-
ganization threatens the security of United 
States nationals or the national security of 
the United States; 
Whereas, as of August 2021, there are 72 
designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, 
including radical Islamic terror groups such 
as Al-Qaida, which was designated as a For-
eign Terrorist Organization in 1999; 
Whereas, prior to the September 11, 2001, 
attacks on the United States, the Afghan 
Taliban provided a safe haven for Al-Qaida to 
plan, train, and operate freely; 
Whereas, following those attacks on the 
United States, which killed almost 3,000 peo-
ple, the Afghan Taliban continued to support 
Al-Qaida; 
Whereas Al-Qaida first pledged allegiance 
to the Afghan Taliban in the 1990s and have 
reaffirmed their loyalty to the Afghan 
Taliban repeatedly since 2001; 
Whereas, since the early 1990s, the Afghan 
Taliban have been responsible for the deaths 
of countless innocent civilians in Afghani-
stan, terrorizing the countryside and the cit-
ies alike; 
Whereas the United Nations report of the 
Analytical Support and Sanctions Moni-
toring Team released in June 2021 stated 
that ‘‘the [Afghan] Taliban and Al-Qaida re-

of breaking ties’’, and ‘‘Al-Qaida is resident 
in at least 15 Afghan provinces’’; 
Whereas, according to the Afghanistan 
Study Group, ‘‘the [Afghan] Taliban have 
fallen short of their commitments: they have 
failed to fulfill their guarantee that they 
will not ‘cooperate with groups or individ-
uals threatening the security of the United 
States and its allies’ and will ‘prevent them 
from recruiting, training, and fundraising 
and will not host them’ ’’; 
Whereas the Afghan Taliban have contin-
ued their terrorist actions through targeted 
assassinations of former Afghan leaders, 
prominent civilian leaders, judges, journal-
ists, and human rights advocates; 
Whereas an Afghanistan under Afghan 
Taliban control will result in further oppres-
sion of the Afghan people, including women 
and girls, and the creation of a safe haven for 
radical Islamic terror groups, which will re-
sult in the United States homeland being 
less safe; 
Whereas the threat to the United States 
homeland has greatly increased now that the 
Afghan Taliban have taken control of Af-
ghanistan; 
Whereas, on September 13, 2021, Secretary 
of State Antony Blinken testified before the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House 
of 
Representatives 
that 
‘‘the 
[Afghan] 
Taliban has been designated as a terrorist 
organization’’; 
Whereas it is critical that all elements of 
United States national power be used to pro-
hibit the Afghan Taliban from using Afghan-
istan as a base from which radical Islamic 
terror organizations can strike the United 
States homeland, as they did on September 
11, 2001; 
Whereas the Afghan Taliban share an ide-
ology and interact closely with designated 
Foreign Terrorist Organizations, including 
Al-Qaida in the Indian Subcontinent, the 
Haqqani 
Network, 
and 
Tehrik-e-Taliban 
Pakistan; 
Whereas the newly formed Afghan Taliban 
Government includes in its senior ranks in-
dividuals subject to sanctions imposed by 
the United Nations and leaders of the 
Haqqani Network, all of whom are hostile to 
the United States; 
Whereas Sirajuddin Haqqani, the leader of 
the Haqqani Network, which has targeted 
and killed United States citizens, has been 
named as the acting Interior Minister of Af-
ghanistan; 
Whereas Sirajuddin Haqqani is listed on 
the Most Wanted list of the Federal Bureau 
of Investigation, and the Rewards for Justice 
program of the Department of State is offer-
ing a reward of up to $10,000,000 for informa-
tion leading to his arrest; 
Whereas Khalil al-Rahman Haqqani, the 
uncle of Sirajuddin Haqqani and a specially 
designated global terrorist under Executive 
Order 13224 (50 U.S.C. 1701 note; relating to 
blocking property and prohibiting trans-
actions with persons who commit, threaten 
to commit, or support terrorism) for whom 
the Rewards for Justice program of the De-
partment of State is offering a reward of 
$5,000,000 for information leading to his ar-
rest, has been named acting Minister of Ref-
ugees of Afghanistan; 
Whereas the United States Government 
must do everything possible to limit the in-
fluence of the Afghan Taliban regime, in-
cluding denying the regime access to all 
money held by the United States Govern-
ment, and should pressure other countries to 
do the same; 
Whereas the Biden administration should 
use all authority and influence to prohibit 
international institutions and organizations 
from distributing funds within the jurisdic-
tion of those institutions and organizations 
to the Afghan Taliban regime; and 
Whereas the Biden administration should 
designate the takeover of Afghanistan by the 
Afghan Taliban as a coup d’e´tat, and all for-
eign assistance to Afghanistan, including 
funds administered by United States Agency 
for International Development, should be 
withheld: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) stands with the Afghan people who are 
now living under the brutal Afghan Taliban 
regime; 
(2) calls upon the Secretary of State to des-
ignate the Afghan Taliban as a Foreign Ter-
rorist Organization; 
(3) declares that the takeover of Afghani-
stan by the Afghan Taliban should be des-
ignated as a coup d’e´tat; 
(4) states that the United States Govern-
ment must deny the Afghan Taliban regime 
access to funds held by the United States 
Government and work to ensure other coun-
tries do the same; and 
(5) calls upon the United States Govern-
ment to use all authority and influence to

ganizations to deny the Afghan Taliban re-
gime access to funds held within the jurisdic-
tion of those institutions and organizations.

lowing resolution; which was referred

S. RES. 360 
Whereas, on January 21, 1990, more than 
300,000 Ukrainians called for unity and inde-
pendence from the Soviet Union by forming 
a human chain between the cities of Kyiv 
and Ivano-Frankivsk; 
Whereas, on August 24, 1991, the elected 
Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine declared the 
independence of Ukraine from the Soviet 
Union with an overwhelming majority of the 
vote; 
Whereas, on December 1, 1991, more than 90 
percent of Ukrainian citizens voted in a na-
tional referendum in support of independ-
ence, with majorities in every region; 
Whereas, on February 8, 1994, Ukraine was 
the first member state of the Commonwealth 
of Independent States to join the Partner-
ship for Peace program of the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization and has since deepened 
its relationship with the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization, recognized as an En-
hanced Opportunities Partner; 
Whereas, on November 22, 2004, Ukrainians 
peacefully took to the streets in protest of a 
fraudulent presidential election, beginning 
the Orange Revolution and resulting in new 
elections under free and fair conditions, 
Whereas, 
on 
November 
21, 
2013, 
the 
Euromaidan protests began, resulting in the 
Revolution of Dignity and the removal of 
President 
Viktor 
Yanukovych 
by 
the 
Verkhovna Rada; 
Whereas, on February 20, 2014, the Russian 
Federation invaded the independent state of 
Ukraine, and Ukraine continues to confront 
malign Russian activity, including the ongo-
ing occupation of the Crimea region, conflict 
in the Donbas region, and threats to freedom 
of navigation in the Black Sea and the Sea of 
Azov; 
Whereas Ukraine has made significant 
progress on defense reforms and has deployed 
in numerous conflicts with the North Atlan-
tic Treaty Organization in support of allied 
and coalition operations; 
Whereas the United States-Ukraine Trade 
and Investment Council continues its mis-
sion of reducing trade barriers in the bilat-
eral relationship, and Ukraine continues to 
seek economic alignment with Europe and 
the West; and 
Whereas Ukraine has continued to progress 
on a path toward democracy and has 
prioritized closer engagement with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Euro-
pean Union: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the courage and resolve 
shown by the Ukrainian people in their pur-
suit of sovereignty and democracy; 
(2) remembers the Euromaidan demonstra-
tions of November 2013 as a major step for-
ward in the journey of Ukraine toward de-
mocracy; 
(3) condemns the illegal military invasion 
and occupation of Crimea by the Russian

by Russian proxies in eastern Ukraine, two 
active conflicts that continue in 2021; 
(4) affirms the Crimea Declaration issued 
and announced by the Department of State 
on July 24, 2018, which rejects the illegal an-

until the territorial integrity of Ukraine is

Euro-Atlantic norms and standards and im-
proving military combat readiness and inter-

to immediately cease all activity that seeks

the Russian Federation until the Russian

Whereas the Senate is proud to recognize

the contributions of Muslim Americans; 
Whereas in keeping with its time-honored 
traditions, the Senate recognizes and pays 
tribute to those who foster cultural pride 
and enhance the profile of diverse commu-
nities across the United States; 
Whereas immigration of Muslims to the 
colonies of the United States began with the 
arrival of indentured workers; 
Whereas, during the 17th, 18th, and 19th 
centuries, a significant number of slaves of 
Muslim heritage were brought to the United 
States; 
Whereas, in the 19th, 20th, and 21st cen-
turies, successive waves of immigration 
brought additional Muslims to the United 
States, who sought to pursue economic and 
social opportunity as well as freedom of reli-
gion and enriched the fabric of the society of 
the United States as business owners, entre-
preneurs, health care professionals, humani-
tarians, scientists, and students; 
Whereas Muslim Americans contribute 
greatly to charitable organizations that help 
people from all faiths in the United States 
and around the world by feeding the hungry, 
providing recuperation efforts following nat-
ural disasters, and providing medical assist-
ance, family services, scholastic supplies, 
and before- and after-school programs; 
Whereas Muslim Americans have contrib-

the Willis ‘‘Sears’’ Tower in Chicago; 
Whereas many Muslim Americans pursue

parts company Flex-N-Gate and the National

Whereas, in 2008, Ambassador Sada Cumber

Whereas Imam Warith Deen Mohammed, 
the first Muslim American to deliver the in-

former also known as Malcolm X, were 
prominent religious leaders and scholars; 
Whereas professional athletes like Na-

members Kareem Abdul Jabbar, Hakeem 
Olajuwon, and Shaquille O’Neal, and 2-time 
world heavyweight champion Hasim Shariff

S. RES. 362 
Whereas student parents are individuals 
with children who attend postsecondary edu-
cational institutions; 
Whereas student parents make up roughly 
a quarter of the student population, totaling 
nearly 4,000,000 individuals; 
Whereas 70 percent of student parents are 
women and 43 percent of student parents are 
single mothers, with nearly half of such stu-
dent parents being first-generation college 
students; 
Whereas 51 percent of student parents are 
students of color; 
Whereas 47 percent of student parents are 
military-connected students; 
Whereas nearly 2⁄3 of student parents have 
incomes at, below, or near the Federal pov-
erty line; 
Whereas 42 percent of student parents at-
tend community colleges and 30 percent at-
tend public or private nonprofit 4-year insti-
tutions of higher education; 
Whereas 1 in 3 college students enrolled in 
a health care program is a student parent; 
Whereas, prior to the COVID–19 pandemic, 
53 percent of student parents reported food 
insecurity and 68 percent reported housing 
insecurity; 
Whereas 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
placed additional burdens on student par-
ents, including the closure of child care cen-
ters, the delay or cancellation of college 
plans, and increased workloads for the 64 
percent of employed student parents who are 
essential workers; 
Whereas, on average, student parents have 
higher grade point averages than their non- 
parenting peers, but student parents are 10 
times less likely to complete a bachelor’s de-
gree within 5 years than students without 
children; 
Whereas a low-income student parent who 
earns a degree or credential boosts their in-
come, and the earning potential of their chil-
dren when they become adults, by 17 percent; 
Whereas student parents are uniquely mo-
tivated to excel in their course of study 
while often facing challenges, including lack 
of affordable child care and balancing work 
responsibilities 
while 
attending 
postsec-
ondary education: Now, therefore be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—

PHYSICIAN SUICIDE AND TO RE-

HEALTH ISSUES 
Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. 
KAINE, and Mr. REED) submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 364 
Whereas, prior to the Coronavirus Disease 
2019 (COVID–19) pandemic, numerous health 
care workers suffered from work-related 
burnout and depression; 
Whereas physicians work under intense 
pressure and are exposed to trauma on the 
job; 
Whereas the suicide rate among— 
(1) male physicians is 1.41 times higher 
than the general male population; and 
(2) female physicians is even more pro-
nounced, being 2.27 times higher than the 
general female population; 
Whereas physicians, nurses, and allied 
health providers serving on the frontlines of 
the COVID–19 pandemic are under a criti-
cally high degree of stress and burnout; 
Whereas shortages of personal protective 
equipment, difficult working conditions, bur-
densome administrative tasks, long hours, 
grief over losing patients, and watching the 
families of patients suffer added a layer of 
extreme stress for many frontline workers; 
Whereas mental health and physical health 
are equally important components of overall 
health; 
Whereas there are structural barriers in 
place that discourage self-care and mental 
health help-seeking behaviors among physi-
cians; and 
Whereas a day of public awareness and edu-
cation campaigns to shine a light on the 
tragedy of physician suicide is held on Sep-
tember 17 each year: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of National Physi-
cian Suicide Awareness Day to bring na-
tional attention to the mental health crisis 
affecting physicians in the United States; 
(2) dedicates a day of reflection to honor 
the memory of physicians who have died by 
suicide; 
(3) recognizes the need for greater research 
into understanding and addressing the issue 
of physician suicide, including the barriers 
to treatment, help-seeking behaviors to ad-
dress burnout, and mental care options to 
prevent physician suicide; and 
(4) encourages the President to issue a 
proclamation calling on the people of the 
United States to observe National Physician 
Suicide Awareness Day with appropriate 
awareness and educational activities.

previous order, following the remarks 
of Senator LANKFORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, last 
week, President Biden announced that 
he had lost patience with the American 
people and that he was demanding peo-
ple get a vaccination. 
Now, I have had the vaccine. I am 
grateful for the vaccine. But it is an 
entirely different issue for the Presi-
dent of the United States to wag his 
finger at the American people and to 
say: I know what you have chosen, but 
I choose something different, and you 
are going to follow me. 
To literally instruct every employer 
with 100 employees or more, every Fed-
eral contractor, every Federal em-
ployee to bend to the will of the Presi-
dent and take this injection, that is a 
very different thing. 
There are over 39 million Americans 
right now, that we know of, that have 
already had COVID–19, have survived 
it, and have natural immunity. The 
President’s demand for a vaccine ig-
nored those almost 40 million Ameri-
cans that already have natural immu-
nity. His demand was: I know you have 
natural immunity. I want you to get 
this vaccine as well. 
It ignores cancer survivors who are 
very, very careful about what goes into 
their system. It ignores people with re-
ligious objections, and there are mil-
lions who have religious objections. It 
ignores individuals who just don’t want 
to do it because they are an American 
and they don’t have to and they do not 
like to have a Federal Government in-
structing them what they are going to 
actually put in their body. 
Now, ironically, this was a random 
selection of companies that have 100 
employees and up, so I assume that if 
you have 99 employees, you are all fine, 
but if you have 100 employees, it is to-
tally different. There seems to be no 
accounting for where your employees 
work. Are your employees all tightly 
packed, all 100 in one small room, or 
are your employees all working out-
side? Do you have 100 employees, but 
they are in 19 different locations? 
There seems to be no accommodation 
for any of those. It is just the Presi-
dent saying: I have lost patience. You 
need to go get the vaccine imme-
diately. 
So, by Thanksgiving, he is planning 
on laying this vaccine mandate down 
on the country. There are multiple 
problems there, as I have already out-
lined: the 40 million people who have 
already survived COVID and don’t want 
to do the vaccine, the individuals in 
different medical treatments, the indi-
viduals with different other religious 
issues that they have. 
But it is also an issue of trying to 
have a mandate come down from the 
Federal Government with an Executive 
order. That is not how our system 
works. The President of the United 
States does not have the ability to be 
able to just demand behavior from the 
American people. That is not their 
role. 
It has been interesting to me. I have 
had several people who have reached 
out to me and said: I found out that the 
President’s order exempts Congress. So 
how come you get an exemption and I 
don’t? 
I quickly responded back to them: 
Because we are a coequal branch of 
government, and the President is try-
ing to find everybody under his pur-
view to be able to do this. But the judi-
cial branch and the legislative branch 
aren’t 
under 
his 
purview. 
Neither 
should be the American people because 
the American people do not work for 
the President of the United States. And 
companies of 100 people or more, their 
chief executive, their leadership does 
not work for the President of the 
United States. 
So now what? There are lawsuits that 
are pending, but those lawsuits can’t 
move forward until the actual paper-
work comes out from the White House. 
When the actual paperwork comes out 
in the next couple of weeks, we as-
sume—we have not been told—then 
they will have what is called standing 
in the courts, and litigation from 
across the country will be able to 
speak into and Federal judges across 
the country will be able to move on an 
injunction on this out-of-control man-
date and to be able to say they cannot 
just compel people to be able to go 
take a shot because the President 
wants them to get it. 
So that will be the first big step. 
There will be legislative challenges 
that will come through this body. They 
are slower, so the Federal courts are 
the fastest response to this. But there 
will be multiple other groups that will 
push back on this, myself included. 
Listen, why would we not respect 
those individuals who have already had 
COVID–19? According to an article that 
is in the Wall Street Journal just 
today, there was a study out of Israel 
that shows that the immunity from 
natural immunity is 27 times more ef-
fective than the shot—27 times, accord-
ing to the study that has just recently 
come out. 
To ignore that and to say that is not 
enough is absurd—or to compel Ameri-
cans, whether they have had COVID or 
not, to be able to have a behavior just 
because the President has ‘‘lost pa-
tience’’ is not who we are as Ameri-
cans. It is not constitutional. It will 
not stand in the courts and should not 
stand. We should push back on this. 
f 
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, you 
are very aware because in the com-
mittee that we both sit on, we have 
worked through a process of trying to 
form an answer to a problem that is 
coming at us again in 2 weeks. 
Two weeks from now, we will hit the 
end of the fiscal year. At the end of the 
fiscal year, according to the Budget 
Act of 1974, we should have already 
passed 12 appropriations bills out of 
this body, 12 appropriations bills out of 
the House, have conferenced those two 
bills, sent it to the White House for a 
signature. That is the instructions that 
should be done by the end of the fiscal 
year. 
The problem with that is the Senate 
has not passed a single one of those ap-
propriations bills even out of com-
mittee—not one. So our government is 
not funded 2 weeks from now, which 
means the countdown clock will begin 
again toward when we are headed to 
another government shutdown, and the 
conversation will be: Are we going to 
have another government shutdown? 
Are we going to be open? What is going 
to happen to Federal workers? 
Agencies across Washington, DC, and 
across the country will shortly get in-
structions for here is what to do in 
case of a shutdown in your Agency. 
Here is who, of employees, would be 
nonessential, what needs to happen to 
them; essential, what needs to happen 
to them. 
And the chaos will begin in all these 
Agencies because 2 weeks from now we 
are headed toward the end of the fiscal 
year and not a single appropriations 
bill, of the 12, has been taken up in 
committee. Not one of them is even 
scheduled even to be debated on the 
floor of the Senate. We will not have 
appropriations bills done 2 weeks from 
now. It is not going to happen. 
So here are the alternatives: There 
will be what is called a short-term con-
tinuing resolution of some length or we 
will have a shutdown 2 weeks from 
now. 
For the past 3 years, Senator MAGGIE 
HASSAN and I have proposed a very 
straightforward solution to end the 
threat of government shutdowns. Our 
straightforward proposal to stop gov-
ernment shutdowns is a simple way to 
be able to solve this issue. If we get to 
the end of the fiscal year, September 
30, midnight, and we have not finished 
the work that needs to be done on 
those 12 appropriations bills, automati-
cally a continuing resolution will kick 
in to prevent a government shutdown. 
But starting the very next day, Octo-
ber 1, the Senate and the House have 
mandatory quorum calls every single 
day until we finish the 12 appropria-
tions bills. We stay here to be able to 
finish our work. But the work has to be 
done. 
Why is that important? Because Fed-
eral Agencies shouldn’t constantly be 
worried 
about 
another 
government 
shutdown, and the American people 
should be able to interact with their 
own government. Now, all of us know 
the government actually doesn’t shut 
down, but it moves into shutdown 
mode. Some people have to show up for 
work; some people do not. But every-
one is paid. Some people can get access 
to a permit when they contact their

Federal Agency; some people cannot. 
Some people can get licensing; some 
people cannot. Some people can work 
through the process with the Corps of 
Engineers; some people cannot. 
And this chaos for the American peo-
ple and for people who work for the 
Federal workforce happens all over the 
country simply because Congress did 
not get its job done. 
Well, the solution is simple. Hold the 
American people and the Federal work-
ers harmless and push Members of Con-
gress to actually finish the work. This 
is not a partisan solution. It is just a 
solution. That is why Republicans and 
Democrats alike have agreed to the 
simple solution that MAGGIE HASSAN 
and I have come to, to be able to end 
government shutdowns and to say let’s 
continue the conversation that needs 
to be done, but let’s not have yet an-
other shutdown. 
This body knows, in the past 40 
years, we have had 21 government shut-
downs—21. The last one needs to be our 
last, but I don’t know if it will be be-
cause 2 weeks from now we are headed 
to the end of the year, and there is no 
solution on the table for how to avoid 
a government shutdown again. 
Senator HASSAN and I and multiple 
others again filed our bill today and 
said: We know how to stop government 
shutdowns. Keep us at work. Hold the 
American people harmless, and let’s 
get the task done. 
Honestly, I have had people say: That 
is such a creative solution, and it is 
such a simple process to get done. I 
have smiled at them and said: Actu-
ally, it is not all that creative. It is the 
same thing that my mom did when my 
brother and I were growing up at the 
house. When my brother and I were in 
an argument, she would put the two of 
us in our room and would say: You 
guys work it out. When you work it 
out, then you can come out of the 
room. 
It is really no different than that to 
say Members of Congress should stay 
at the task until we solve the budget 
work and we should not leave with the 
budget work undone and leave the 
American people experiencing another 
government shutdown. 
Let’s not have shutdown 22. Let’s end 
government shutdowns, and let’s get 
our actual budget work done, on time, 
as is expected by the American people. 
With that, I yield the floor.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF JAMES 
‘‘SKILLET’’ MARLIN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Mr. James Alvin Marlin who passed away on 
Friday, August 27 at the age of 88. I join his 
family, friends, and loved ones in mourning his 
loss. 
Born on October 16, 1932 in Fawn Grove, 
Mississippi to Theron Kendall and Vivian 
Lucas Marlin, Skillet went on to graduate from 
Iuka High school in 1951. He attended 
Itawamba Junior College before joining the 
United States Army. He served as a Tank 
Commander in the Korean War in the ‘‘Hell 
On Wheels’’ division. 
After service, Skillet moved to Tupelo to 
work in car sales. He co-owned the Lincoln- 
Mercury dealership and later purchased and 
managed it. Years later in Iuka, he purchased 
and managed the Marlin-Moore Chevrolet 
dealership. In Iuka he served on the A71 
board for the state of Mississippi. For six 
years he was the Game and Fish Commis-
sioner. For 11 years he served on the 
Tombigbee Water Management Board and 
worked as an investigator for the State Insur-
ance Commissioner. Mr. Marlin was the presi-
dent of the board for NASA Facilities Oper-
ations and served on the TCEPA board for 
more than fifteen years. 
Skillet was an avid outdoorsman. He was in-
strumental 
in 
bringing 
Turkey 
back 
to 
Tishomingo County and was a friend to Elvis 
Presley. He was beloved by all who had the 
opportunity to know him. Mr. Marlin is survived 
by his two sons, Bob and Scott. 
Mr. Marlin served his country proudly, and I 
am thankful for his life of service to this Na-
tion.

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
MELVIN 
ROSSON POST’S 75 YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of Melvin Rosson Post 
8356, Veterans for Foreign Wars’ seventy-fifth 
anniversary. Melvin Rosson Post 8356 was 
founded on September 18, 1946, by veterans 
who had just returned home after World War 
II as a sanctuary for combat veterans to gath-
er. 
Over seventy-five years, the Post has dis-
played Virginia’s commitment to advocacy and 
civic engagement. The Melvin Rosson Post 
lends a needed and well-deserved voice to 
America’s veterans, going above and beyond 
to raise awareness and honor the Nation’s 
brave heroes in our community. Their displays 
of courage and determination set an excellent 
example for all of those around us. 
Today the Post’s mission remains much the 
same. With a membership of forty plus, the 
current members strive to serve the commu-
nity and veterans. The Melvin Rosson Post 
has served as a support system to not just the 
veterans but the surviving spouses and chil-
dren of military, lending a hand whenever pos-
sible. 
Therefore Madam Speaker, I ask that you 
rise with me today to honor and celebrate the 
seventy-fifth anniversary of the Melvin Rosson 
Post 8356, Veterans for Foreign Wars. I look 
forward to hearing about the future projects 
and stories of your continued commitment to 
our community and great nation.

CONGRATULATING FRANK 
MANCINI 
HON. JOHN B. LARSON 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. 
LARSON 
of 
Connecticut. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Frank 
Mancini, of Berlin, Connecticut, on his recent 
selection to the Board of Directors of the Na-
tional Association of Federally-Insured Credit 
Unions (NAFCU). 
Frank currently serves as President and 
Chief Executive Officer of Connex Credit 
Union in North Haven, Connecticut. He has 
over 30 years of experience in the financial 
services industry, including having served as 
CEO of Connex since 2012, after having 
served as its Chief Financial Officer since 
2003. Under his leadership, Connex has 
grown in total assets from $378M to $810M 
over the past eight years. Connex currently 
ranks as the 5th largest credit union in Con-
necticut in terms of asset size and 3rd in Con-
necticut in terms of loan balance. 
Frank has served on a number of Boards, 
including New Haven’s Financial Empower-
ment Commission, Credit Union Executive So-
ciety of New England (Board Chair), Connex 
Insurance Services, Constitution State Cor-
porate Credit Union, the Tax Exempt Pro-
ceeds Fund, and the Association for Senior 
Credit Union Officers. In 2016, he was award-
ed the Mayor’s Community Champion Award 
for his advocacy efforts in assisting low-in-
come households get increased access to 
banking services. He holds a Bachelor of 
Science in Business Administration from The 
University of Connecticut in Storrs, Con-
necticut, and a Master of Business Administra-
tion from The University of Connecticut in 
West Hartford, Connecticut. 
Frank has a wealth of financial services and 
leadership knowledge. His vision and decision- 
making skills will be a valuable addition to the 
NAFCU Board and credit unions for years to 
come. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in congratu-
lating Frank Mancini and wishing him the best 
of luck in his new role on the NAFCU Board 
of Directors. I look forward to working with him 
in this regard.

HONORING THE BUTLER COUNTY 
FARM BUREAU’S 100 YEAR ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. RON ESTES 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. ESTES. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the 100th Anniversary of the Butler 
County Farm Bureau Association (BCFBA). 
Now, one hundred years later, BCFBA con-
tinues to offer advocacy, education, and serv-
ice on behalf of those involved in an evolving 
food and agriculture system. 
Founded in 1921, BCFBA serves the agri-
cultural and local communities by providing 
leadership on agriculture, natural resources, 
safe and nutritious food, educating school chil-
dren about how and where food and fiber are 
grown, and informing legislators and the public 
on a broad spectrum of agriculture-related 
issues. The elected board of directors consists 
primarily of local farmers and ranchers who 
know how important it is to have the resources 
the Farm Bureau provides. 
Beyond their membership services, the 
Farm Bureau strives to educate the public 
about the vital role that farmers and ranchers 
play in feeding our country and the world. But-
ler County Farm Bureau’s annual Farm to 
Fork and So Much More event allows people 
from all over Kansas to take educational tours 
of farms, ranches, orchards, wineries, and 
other agri-businesses while enjoying Butler 
County’s 
beautiful 
Kansas 
scenery. 
This 
event, along with many other events the Farm 
Bureau offers throughout the year, highlights 
the connections between our lives and our 
state’s agricultural community. As a result of 
their commitment, our fields grow richer, our 
abundance grows greater, and our country 
stands stronger. 
Please join me in congratulating the Butler 
County Farm Bureau Association on their cen-
tennial anniversary and wishing them contin-
ued success in serving Butler County for years 
to come.

HONORING ERIN BELL AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize a tireless advocate for the refugee 
community, Ms. Erin Bell, as Iowan of the 
Week. 
Erin runs the non-profit organization ‘‘Des 
Moines Refugee Support’’ based in Des 
Moines and the metro area. Erin is known as 
someone who has a big heart and an even 
bigger vision for supporting thousands of refu-
gees in central Iowa. Des Moines Refugee 
Support strives to serve as a voice, friend, and 
mentor for all refugees as they make a new 
home in Iowa. Their focus as an organization 
is on empowerment, and they strive to ad-
dress shared issues and work together to up-
lift all communities. 
Upon arrival in the United States, refugee 
families receive about 90 days of assistance 
from a caseworker to help them learn about 
their new home. That’s not much time when 
there’s so much to learn. Erin’s goal is to fill 
the gaps when refugees arrive in Iowa. 
One of the programs designed to help fill 
the gaps is their youth soccer sponsorship 
program. Erin saw the passion for soccer 
among many of the refugee children, and 
knew she had to find a way to bring their 
dream of playing organized soccer to life. Des 
Moines Refugee Support partnered with Des 
Moines Soccer club to raise money through 
the nonprofit to pay for the kids’ cleats, shin 
guards, registration fees and other items asso-
ciated with playing an organized sport. This 
has allowed the kids that are brand new to 
Iowa an opportunity to make new friends, get 
involved in their community, and of course 
play soccer. 
Advocates like Erin, and organizations like 
Des Moines Refugee Support, are what 
makes our Iowa communities across the state 
such great places to live. I will always fight in 
Congress to be a voice for refugees, and to 
ensure Iowa is a welcoming place. It is my 
pleasure to name Erin Bell as Iowan of the 
Week.

COMMENDING 
MR. 
PAUL 
COS-
TELLO ON HIS SERVICE TO THE 
STATE OF VERMONT 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate and honor my friend Paul Cos-
tello, who has served since 2000 as Executive 
Director of the Vermont Council on Rural De-
velopment (VCRD), part of the National Rural 
Development Partnership established by Con-
gress. Although Paul is retiring from VCRD, 
his legacy will continue in the projects and ini-
tiatives that he has inspired in rural commu-
nities across Vermont. 
Throughout his years as Executive Director, 
Paul has established himself as a respected 
neutral facilitator of community conversations. 
Paul has a unique ability to unite diverse view-
points and lead people to consensus, action 
and success. He is dedicated to the ideals of 
democracy and to the promotion of social and 
economic opportunity for all Vermonters. He is 
a patriotic enthusiast for civic engagement, en-
ergizing all who venture into his orbit. 
Among his many activities, Paul coordinates 
the annual VCRD Governor’s Rural Summit to 
build federal and state cross-agency action 
plans. Each year he facilitates multiple com-
munity visits with teams of state, federal, non- 
profit and private leaders to help rural commu-
nities evaluate and prioritize opportunities, de-
velop action plans, connect to resources and 
rally to action. 
Over the past twenty years, Paul has pro-
duced and facilitated numerous Vermont Pol-
icy Councils and Community Development ef-
forts including the Vermont Forest Products 
Council, the Vermont Agriculture Viability 
Council, the Vermont Council on Culture and 
Innovation, the Vermont Council on Planning, 
the Vermont Rural Energy Council, the VT 
Creative Communities Program, the Council 
on the Future of Vermont, the Vermont Work-
ing Landscape Council, the Vermont Working 
Landscape Partnership, and the Vermont 
Working Lands Coalition, the e-Vermont Com-
munity Broadband Project and Vermont Digital 
Economy Project, the Vermont Higher Edu-
cation 
Food 
Systems 
Council, 
and 
the 
Vermont Climate Change Economy Council. 
Most recently, Paul has chaired the Gov-
ernor’s Covid–19 Local Support and Commu-
nity Action Team. 
A native Vermonter, Paul obtained his B.A. 
and M.A. at the University of Vermont and 
earned a PhD in intellectual history at McGill 
University in Montreal. He has devoted a sub-
stantial part of his career to the cultivation of 
Vermont civic institutions, and the state is a 
better place because of it. I wish him a pro-
ductive and fulfilling retirement.

Ms. SPEIER. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor Wayne Freedman, one of the Bay 
Area’s most intrepid television reporters and a 
fixture on ABC 7 for 30 years who is retiring 
after a remarkable and award-winning career. 
Wayne has covered a vast variety of events 
here at home and abroad, from major earth-
quakes, fires, and hurricanes, to national and 
local elections, to major sports events, to the 
September 11th attacks, to the COVID–19 
pandemic, to NASA space missions, to 
beached whales. In 1992, ABC 7 sent him 
solo to Moscow to cover Russia’s Second 
Revolution. He traveled across the U.S. by 
train visiting small towns to capture the pulse 
of America after 9/11. No matter the content of 
a story, Wayne will get to the truth and he has 
a knack for finding the human angle that reso-
nates with viewers. He likes to put it this way: 
‘‘My philosophy is to find, small stories within 
large ones, and large stories in the small 
ones. Those are the most telling.’’ 
His philosophy and work have earned him 
over 50 Emmy Awards and several Edward R. 
Murrow awards. Many of his pieces were 
picked up by ABC’s national show World 
News Tonight. Wayne is also the author of a 
book that is required reading in several col-
lege journalism programs in the U.S., Canada, 
and Europe, It Takes More Than Good Looks 
To Succeed at Television News Reporting. 
Television is part of the Freedman family’s 
DNA. Wayne’s father, Mike Freedman, started 
working for the ABC network in 1948. He pio-
neered the use of live, hand-held video cam-
eras for covering news and sports events. As 
soon as Wayne could walk, his dad took him 
into the field with him. 
Wayne had his first byline in 1968 when he 
started writing a weekly column about life in 
middle school for a paper that is now the Los 
Angeles Daily News. That same summer he 
worked in San Francisco as a grip for ABC on 
a profile about heavyweight boxing champion 
Sonny Liston. 
Wayne received his Bachelor’s Degree in 
Political Science from UCLA in 1977 and his 
Master’s Degree in Journalism from the Uni-
versity of Missouri at Columbia in 1978. In 
1981 he moved to San Francisco from where 
he has been reporting ever since. Before he 
joined ABC 7 in 1991, he worked for CBS 
News traveling the country to produce a week-
ly segment called Only in America for CBS 
This Morning. 
For those who have seen Wayne Freedman 
reporting out in the field, they will have noticed 
an ever-present still camera in his hand with 
which he snaps behind the scenes photo-
graphs that he posts on social media. It’s an 
eye-opening way to see the world from 
Wayne’s perspective.

Wayne and his wife Susan live in Marin 
County. They are the proud parents of daugh-
ter Lauren who lives in New York. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the 
House of Representatives to rise with me to 
recognize Wayne Freedman for his lifelong 
passion for storytelling and his ability to trans-
fer that passion to his viewers. He is an out-
standing journalist who has thrived throughout 
decades of changes in the journalism profes-

While we will miss his booming voice and 
captivating presence on our TV screens and 
smart phones, we wish him well in his well-de-

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF ROB-
ERT LANCE ‘‘BOBBY’’ CRABTREE 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Major Bobby Crabtree who passed away on 
Thursday, August 26 at North Mississippi 
Medical Center. He served with the Mississippi 
Army National Guard within the HHC, 115th 
Armored Brigade in Tupelo. 
Bobby was born in Louisiana to William and 
Aleta Best Crabtree. He was raised in Houma 
and graduated from H.L. Bourgeouis High 
School. He studied Business Administration at 
Nicholls State University in Louisiana and 
began his career at Sears. In 2002 he was 
transferred to Tupelo, where he retired and 
began his career as a truck driver. 
Bobby served for twenty-three years in the 
Mississippi Army National Guard and retired 
as a Major. He was deployed to Iraq during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom. He was an active 
member of the Orchard Church in Tupelo. He 
was a lifelong LSU football fan, but gladly 
cheered for Mississippi State, where his sons 
attended. In his free time he played bass gui-
tar and fished. 
Left to cherish his memory are his wife, 
Pamela Smith Crabtree; sons Wesley, Mat-
thew, and Lance; his mother, Aleta; and broth-
er, Billy. 
I am grateful for Major Crabtree’s many 
years of service to the state of Mississippi and 
I join his family, friends, and loved ones in 
grieving his loss.

IN RECOGNITION OF CHIEF RON-
ALD HADDAD AND THE DEAR-
BORN POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Chief Ronald Haddad of 
the Dearborn Police Department who was re-
cently chosen to be featured in the National 
Law Enforcement Museum’s new exhibit: 
Post-9/11: The Evolution of American Law En-
forcement. His honorable years of service to 
our community is worthy of commendation. 
Two decades after the terrorist attacks on 
our nation that shook the world, we remember 
the lives lost on that terrible day. Dearborn, 
Michigan is home to the largest Arab Amer-
ican and Muslim populations in the United 
States and faced unique challenges in the 
days and months following the horrendous at-
tacks by extremists. Muslim-owned businesses 
and mosques faced threats, Islamophobia, 
and hatred—but the Dearborn police ensured 
their safety and routinely checked in on our 
neighbors. 
For their courageous actions in the face of 
hate, Chief Haddad and the Dearborn Police 
Department are featured in an exhibit on post- 
9/11 policing at the National Law Enforcement 
Museum in Washington, D.C. Though Chief 
Haddad was working in Detroit on September 
11th, he took it upon himself to work with area 
police departments to build relationships with 
the Arab American community and to do what 
was needed to protect them amidst rising ha-
tred. 
Chief Haddad became Dearborn’s first Arab 
American police chief in 2008, as well as the 
first Arab American police chief in Michigan. 
He serves on several state and national advi-
sory boards, including on the Law Enforce-
ment Immigration Reform Commission. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Chief Ronald Haddad for his 
invaluable service to the Dearborn Police De-
partment and for his lasting impact on our 
community following the events of September 
11, 2001. Chief Haddad and the Dearborn Po-
lice Department are hardworking, everyday 
heroes that we are fortunate to have here in 
Michigan.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE SERVICE 
OF JAMES ‘‘HONDO’’ GEURTS 
HON. MIKE GALLAGHER 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize James ‘‘Hondo’’ Geurts. 
After retiring from the Air Force as a colonel, 
Hondo served in the Senior Executive Service 
as United States Special Operations Com-
mand’s Acquisition Executive as well as As-
sistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, 
Development and Acquisition. He is formally 
retiring again after continuing his faithful serv-
ice by performing the duties of the Under Sec-
retary of the Navy. He is not only an advocate 
for the hardworking men and women of North-
east Wisconsin, but also a dedicated patriot in 
service to his Nation. 
During his more than 30 years of service, 
Hondo served for 22 years in uniform as ac-
quisition program manager with engineering 
and in program management leadership posi-
tions in numerous weapon systems. As a de-
fense civilian, Hondo served in all levels of de-
fense-related acquisition leadership including 
Acquisition Executive, Program Executive Offi-
cer, and Program Manager of a variety of 
Major Defense Acquisition Programs to in-
clude ballistic missiles, surveillance platforms, 
tactical fighter aircraft, advanced avionics sys-
tems, stealth cruise missiles, training systems, 
and manned and unmanned special oper-
ations aircraft. 
After retiring from the Air Force, Hondo 
served an additional 8 years as Acquisition 
Executive for USSOCOM and Assistant Sec-
retary of the Navy for Research, Development 
and Acquisition until Feb. 2021 when he was 
designated as performing the duties of the 
Under Secretary of the Navy. 
Amidst his commitment as a service mem-
ber, acquisitions leader, and performing the 
duties of Under Secretary of the Navy, his 
greatest contribution to both national security 
and to the people of Northeast Wisconsin has 
been his incredible work on the frigate pro-
gram. Thanks to his uncommon skill and un-
paralleled dedication, the world is a safer 
place. I am incredibly thankful for his selfless 
and dedicated service. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members of this 
body to join me in applauding James ‘‘Hondo’’ 
Geurts for his patriotism and inspiring service 
to a grateful Nation.

REMEMBERING RONN MEREDITH 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of my longtime friend, Ronn 
Meredith. I want to extend my deepest sym-
pathies to his wife Marni, his children Cole, 
Ava and Reese, and the rest of his family. We 
know how heartbroken they are, and we all 
share in their grief of losing such a wonderful 
human being at such a young age. He truly 
loved Marni and their children with his entire 
being and his eyes twinkled whenever he 
spoke about them. I know he will continue to 
love his family night and day and his love will 
never fade away. 
I first met Ronn in college as we were both 
members of the Delta tau Delta fraternity. To 
say Ronn was a big personality is an under-
statement. I can honestly say, in all my life, I 
never met anyone quite like Rondo. He was 
smart, had a great sense of humor, and un-
questionably the best laugh in the business. 
His family and friends were always number 1, 
but his second love was Cleveland sports 
(which if you’ve followed sports for the last 50 
years, wasn’t always an easy task). 
His energy was absolutely electric. He could 
express himself on such a wide array of sub-
jects and was passionate about so many 
things, from golfing to the Grateful Dead. 
What’s more is he could comfortably banter 
with CEO’s on the links, as easily as he could 
jam out with a 75-year-old hippy at a live 
show. He could have fun with longtime friends 
or a new acquaintance; an old-timer or a little 
kid. They all loved him as he did them, be-
cause through him we could feel his lust for 
life. That’s what made him unique. That is 
what made him special. But no matter who his 
company, these interchanges almost always 
ended with a lot of laughs and a room full of 
love. We all just wish we had one more Satur-
day night with him. One more chance to ram-
ble on with Rondo. 
It’s hard to lose a guy like Ronn because he 
was always just so full of life. His cup was al-
ways full, and he made you feel like your cup 
was full too. He innately knew that the 
happiest people don’t have the best of every-
thing, they just make the best of everything. 
He drank from the fountain that was not made 
from the hands of men. He was special that 
way. He understood at a deep level that we

are all connected; that we are all tied to that 
song that the morning brings. 
It’s been difficult, to say the least, for those 
of us who loved him to come to grips with his 
passing. So many stories, so much fun. So 
many good times that we want to hold on to. 
But I believe God sometimes gives us people 
like Ronn, and takes them way to early, so 
that we remember more profoundly how they 
lived. So that we may take their best qualities 
and assimilate them into our lives. The real 
characteristic which I think we can take from 
Ronn, was that he just loved life in all its 
forms. His family, sports, work, music, and so 
much more. I can still see him dancing at con-
certs, bear hugging his people, and LOUDLY 
cheering on his favorite teams. Ronn loved it 
all and he did it with all of his heart. 
Madam Speaker, it’s our responsibility to 
take on Ronn’s philosophy that we are all the 
eyes of the world. That we need to connect to 
that love Ronn embodied every day. We need 
to be excited about our lives and share our 
dreams with those around us. We need to 
love more, share more, care more. We need 
to ask ourselves, are we kind? We need to be 
that ripple even if the water is still. 
So, we say fare thee well my brother, we 
love him more than words can say. Although 
he is not with us physically, he will forever be 
in our hearts. We here promise, his friends 
and family, that we will honor him and his 
amazing life, by being true to ourselves, com-
passionate to one another, and always, no 
matter what, enjoying the ride.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF TONY 
M. AUSTIN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Mr. Tony 
Austin who passed away on August 15. I join 
his family, friends, and loved ones in mourning 
his loss. 
Tony was beloved by his community. He 
proudly served in the United States Army as 
a Sergeant in the Korean war from 1950– 
1953. After returning he continued to serve his 
community as a Memphis police officer driving 
car #1 on Beale Street. He was affectionately 
known by his colleagues as Mr. Smiley. 
In his free time, Mr. Austin enjoyed a round 
of golf, singing gospels, and playing the guitar. 
He was a father, grandfather, great-grand-
father and a friend. 
Mr. Austin was a fixture in his community 
and his legacy will be long remembered. I 
offer my most sincere condolences to all who 
had the opportunity to know and love him.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE AND 
SACRIFICE OF THE THORNTON 
FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the service and sacrifice of the 
Thornton Fire Department in my district. 
When COVID–19 vaccines became avail-
able, the city of Thornton jumped into action 
and tasked the Thornton Fire Department with 
administering vaccines to residents. Thornton 
Fire was uniquely qualified for this rollout as 
they had been providing mass COVID–19 test-
ing during the pandemic. 
As of this past June, Thornton Fire adminis-
tered over 82,000 doses of the COVID–19 
vaccine. These efforts went above and beyond 
their call of duty and drew in Coloradans from 
all over the state. 
In late-April, the Congressional Fire Serv-
ices Institute awarded Thornton Fire their ‘‘Fire 
Service-Based EMS Award,’’ a highly coveted 
award that recognizes the work of the depart-
ment in testing and vaccinating our community 
members and implementing a monitoring pro-
gram for COVID-symptomatic firefighters. 
I thank Thornton Fire for their service, sac-
rifice, and unfailing commitment to all Colo-
radans. 
CELEBRATING WASHINGTON FIRE 
COMPANY NO. 2 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA

Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate the Washington Fire Company 
No. 2 of Madison, Indiana on its 175th anni-
versary. 
Established on January 22, 1846, the fire-
house is one of the last remaining Greek Re-
vival firehouses in the United States. Wash-
ington Fire Company No. 2 is the oldest active 
firehouse in the Hoosier state. 
I congratulate Washington Fire Company 
No. 2 and thank them for 175 years of service.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF MRS. 
FANNIE ‘‘CINDY’’ MCCLAIN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, September 14, 2021 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Mrs. 
McClain who turns 100 years old on Sep-
tember 26, 2021. I congratulate her on a long 
and healthy life and decades of service to her 
community. 
Mrs. McClain is a gifted seamstress. She is 
known for her ability to adapt any pattern and 
create something beautiful overnight. She was 
also an athlete with the Hernando Community 
Ladies Softball Team. She was a domestic 
worker and a seamstress at Minor France 
Dress Shop in Memphis before retiring. 
Mrs. McClain was married to Mr. Cornelius 
Lloyd McClain and the mother of two sons, Al-
fred and Calvin. She is a lifelong member of 
Rising Sun Missionary Baptist Church in 
Hernando. 
I am thrilled to wish Mrs. McClain a happy 
100th birthday and offer my most sincere con-
gratulations.
