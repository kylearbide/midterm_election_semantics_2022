PRAYER 
Reverend Alisa Lasater Wailoo, Cap-
itol Hill United Methodist Church, 
Washington, D.C., offered the following 
prayer: 
Listening Lord, what a privilege it is 
to carry everything, everything to You 
in prayer. 
Oh, how easy it is to allow these 
prayers to feel pro forma. In the still-
ness, help us hear You call us by name, 
not first as Member, staffer, clerk, lob-
byist, unpaid activist, or any earthly 
title, but rather, as Your beloved child. 
Share with us, God, both about our 
own hopes, dreams, trials or tribu-
lations, and the work You have for us 
today. Speak to any trauma, be that 
from individual pains or the insurrec-
tion through which this whole House 
suffered together. Empower us to be 
trustworthy companions to anyone 
struggling, those in our own office, in 
our home, around our district, and 
across the aisle. 
In this pro forma prayer, open us to 
real conversation with You, both now 
and throughout this congressional ses-
sion so that we, like You, on that first 
Passover, might hear the cries of Your 
people, and like Jesus at the cross, 
may bear one another’s burdens. 
Amen and amen.

RECOGNIZING BRITTANI ACUFF IN 
HONOR 
OF 
WOMEN’S 
HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 29, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Brittani Acuff is 
a philanthropist, creator, storyteller and most 
importantly, an ally. In 2010, Brittani left Cen-
tral Florida to attend the University of Mis-
sissippi where she studied broadcast jour-
nalism and theatre arts. At Ole Miss, Brittani 
was 
a 
lead 
anchor 
and 
reporter 
for 
Newswatch99. She was ranked in the Top 
Four Feature Reporters in the Southeastern 
Journalism Conference’s Best of the South, 
beating out reporters from over 30 colleges. 
As a reporter, she learned the value of rela-
tionships and branding, and transitioned to 
working in public and community relations. In 
2014, she returned to Orlando and imme-
diately plugged back into Orlando’s charitable 
scene. 
Brittani is the community relations and 
events manager at one of Central Florida’s 
leading LGBTQ+ and Allied Healthcare Cen-
ters, serves on the onePulse Foundation’s Me-
morial Task Force and the Orlando Youth Em-
powerment Summit Steering Committee, is an 
ally 
on 
Congressman 
DARREN
SOTO’s 
LGBTQ+ roundtable, is the marketing chair for 
the Provisional Class of the Junior League of 
Greater Orlando, and hosts and plans shows 
at New York Fashion Week. Her past commu-
nity involvement also includes Dance, Dream 
and Inspire for Community Based Care of 
Central Florida, volunteering with Cystic Fibro-
sis Foundation of Central Florida and being 
chair of the opening reception committee for 
the United States Conference on AIDS. In 
2020, Brittani was named one of Orlando 
Magazine’s Women of the Year. 
Brittani broke the mold in the pageant indus-
try by starting at age 25 and doing it her way. 
Brittani served as Miss Orange County USA, 
Miss Orange County Galaxy and Miss South-
ern States Galaxy. At Galaxy Internationals, 
Brittani was the only American to place in the 
Top 5 in her division and is the current reign-
ing Orange County’s Perfect Miss. In 2019, 
Brittani was named ‘‘The Most Influential Per-
son in Pageantry’’ by Art&Beauty Magazine. 
For this and more, we honor Ms. Acuff.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
WASH-
INGTON, D.C. AREA HELICOPTER 
NOISE INFORMATION EXCHANGE 
ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 29, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Washington, DC Area Helicopter 
Noise Information Exchange Act of 2021, 
which would require the Federal Aviation Ad-
ministration (FAA) to implement a Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) recommendation 
to create a mechanism to exchange informa-
tion about helicopter noise in the Washington, 
DC area between FAA and helicopter opera-
tors. I am pleased that Representatives GER-
ALD E. CONNOLLY and DONALD S. BEYER, Jr. 
from 
Virginia 
and 
Representatives 
JAMIE 
RASKIN, ANTHONY G. BROWN and DAVID J. 
TRONE from Maryland join me in introducing 
this bill, underscoring its regional importance. 
Residents of the District of Columbia and 
the national capital region (NCR) have been 
plagued by helicopter noise for years. Yet, 
there is no centralized complaint system nor 
any comprehensive data about helicopter 
noise in the NCR. In January 2019, Rep-
resentatives 
CONNOLLY, 
BEYER, 
RASKIN, 
BROWN, TRONE and I wrote GAO requesting 
that it conduct a study of helicopter noise in 
the NCR. In that letter, we wrote, ‘‘Many of our 
constituents live with the impacts of regular 
helicopter noise that interrupts sleep patterns, 
causes their homes to shake and negatively 
impacts their quality of life. While disturbances 
from helicopter noise have been a long-
standing problem for some, others have noted 
recent increases in the frequency and severity 
of helicopter noise in their neighborhoods. We 
understand that helicopter activity is an essen-
tial part of law enforcement, military and med-
ical operations and appreciate the critical ef-
forts of employees serving in those sectors. 
However, we also believe that, through infor-
mation collection, analysis and coordination, 
we can identify strategies to minimize the neg-
ative impacts of helicopter activity without im-
peding the work of the agencies operating hel-
icopters within the region.’’ 
In response to our request, GAO announced 
in June 2019 that it would conduct the study. 
GAO released its report in January 2021. 
GAO found that FAA’s current ability to work 
with helicopter operators in the NCR is limited 
because of the absence of effective informa-
tion sharing mechanisms. GAO recommended 
that FAA direct its Office of Environment and 
Energy to develop a mechanism to exchange 
helicopter noise information with operators in 
the NCR. FAA concurred with GAO’s rec-
ommendation, but this bill would require FAA 
to develop such a mechanism. 
This bill would direct the creation of a more 
effective 
information 
sharing 
mechanism, 
which would also allow for better, more com-
prehensive data on helicopter noise com-
plaints. This data would in turn help us de-
velop solutions to address helicopter noise. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF HERMON 
RUDOLPH NETHERLAND 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 29, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Hermon Rudolph Netherland, 
who passed away on Friday, March 19, 2021, 
at the age of 94. Hermon was a U.S. Navy 
World War II veteran, longtime resident of 
Tyler County, and deeply respected by all who 
knew him. 
Hermon was born on April 21, 1926, in En-
terprise, 
Louisiana, 
to 
Anne 
and 
Neal 
Netherland. At a young age, his family moved 
to Port Arthur, where he was raised. Like 
many kids of his generation, Hermon worked 
from an early age. His family had a large gar-
den and they grew an assortment of fruits and 
vegetables from bell peppers to cantaloupes. 
Hermon had the responsibility of tending the 
garden. His duties included hoeing, watering, 
and picking the vegetables. At the onset of 
WWII, Hermon felt led to serve his country 
and wanted to enlist. However, Hermon’s fa-
ther was against this decision, fearing his 15- 
year-old son would go to war. After spending 
the next year convincing his father, Hermon 
was finally allowed to enlist in the Navy. 
After completing Basic Training in San 
Diego, California, and signal school in Chi-
cago, Illinois, Hermon enrolled in underwater 
demolition training at Fort Pierce in Florida. He 
soon qualified as both a Navy signal man and 
frog man, (someone who assisted with under-
water demolitions). After a deployment in 
Newport, Rhode Island, Hermon went on to 
participate in nearly every major campaign in 
the Pacific Theater. Throughout the war, he 
would be based on the USS Birgit, a troop 
transport and cargo ship. His duties would ro-
tate between signalman, frog man, and man-
ning a landing craft taking troops to shore on 
several of the most dangerous invasion cam-
paigns. Hermon was present for the U.S. inva-
sion of Guam, Sai Pan, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, 
the Philippines, and the Marshall Islands. 
While in the Philippines, Hermon and fellow 
Navy frogmen were tasked with helping to 
open the Straits of Hormuz. 
The USS Birgit returned to America after the 
war via the Panama Canal. Conveniently, its 
final stop was the Port of Orange, where the 
ship was then decommissioned and sold. Es-
sentially, the ship he had spent the entirety of 
the war on, traveling across the Pacific Ocean, 
delivered Hermon to his own front door. Short-
ly after returning home, Hermon met Velma, 
the love of his life. They were married soon 
after she completed high school. They were 
blessed with 64 years of marriage and a won-
derful baby girl. Following his time in the mili-
tary, Hermon went to work for Texaco in Port 
Arthur and retired from there after many years 
of service. During his retirement, Hermon en-
joyed spending time at his cabin located on 
Lake Amanda in Colmesneil to hunt and fish.

Hermon is survived by his sister-in-law, 
Charlene Netherland of Oregon, and numer-
ous friends. He is preceded in death by his 
parents, Neal and Anne Netherland; wife, 
Velma Netherland; and daughter, Sharon 
Netherland. 
Madam Speaker, I honor my friend Hermon 
Netherland as one of the last members of the 
Greatest Generation. His faithful service to our 
country will not be forgotten, and my heartfelt 
prayers remain with his family and friends dur-
ing this difficult time.

seek positivity and hope in each day as we 
weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for 
the opportunity to recognize these hard-

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF CADE 
GEBBERS 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 29, 2021 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, today 
we commemorate the life of one of my con-
stituents, Cade Gebbers of Brewster. 
At just 19 years old, Cade was already an 
integral part of his community and a remark-
ably accomplished student athlete with a 
bright future ahead of him. 
From being named the Washington Inter-
scholastic Activities Association Athlete of the 
Week and the State B Basketball Player of the 
Year, to making the winning shot at the State 
tournament with only 1.3 seconds left on the 
clock, Cade’s talent with a basketball was an 
inspiration to many fellow young athletes in his 
community. 
1 Thessalonians 5:11 tells us to ‘‘encourage 
one another and build each other up,’’ and 
that’s exactly what friends and family will al-
ways remember Cade for, on and off the 
court: a young man with a gentle heart and a 
warm smile who was a constant source of en-
couragement for his classmates and team-
mates. 
Even in their time of grief, Cade’s family is 
taking action by supporting Only 7 Seconds, a 
Washington-based organization dedicated to 
spreading individual expressions of positive 
support to combat the feelings of isolation and 
depression that so many teenagers experi-
ence. I commend them for their strength and 
commitment to this worthy cause. 
My thoughts and prayers, as well as those 
of neighbors across Central Washington, are 
with Cade’s entire family—especially his par-
ents, Johnny and Nikki, and his siblings 
Kelson, Cort, Karden, and Capri. May the 
Gebbers family find peace and comfort in their 
faith, in their family and community, and in 
Cade’s memory.
