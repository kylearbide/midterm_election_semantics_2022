DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable ERIC

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
O God, our refuge and our strength, a 
very present help in times of discord 
and 
trouble. 
Mountains 
crumble, 
waters rage, nations roar, and yet we 
need not be afraid, for even now You 
abide with us in these times of great 
discord, uncertainty, and unrest. 
We, who have pledged to defend our 
Constitution against all enemies, we 
pray Your hedge of protection around 
this Nation. Defend us from those ad-
versaries, both foreign and domestic, 
outside these walls and perhaps within 
these Chambers, who sow seeds of acri-
mony to divide colleagues and conspire 
to undermine trust in Your divine au-
thority over all things. 
The journey of this experiment in de-
mocracy is perilous and demanding, 
fraught with anger and discontent. But 
wise rulers still seek You. 
So help us, God, to find You in the 
midst of us. 
So help us, God, to see Your gracious 
plan even in the events of these days. 
So help us, God, to serve You and 
this Nation with Godliness and dignity. 
We lay before You the gifts of our 
hopes, our dreams, our deliberations, 
and our debates, that You would be re-
vealed and exalted among the people. 
We pray these things in the strength 
of Your holy name. 
Amen.

to the Committee on Foreign Affairs

To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-

1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.),

national emergency with respect to the 
information and communications tech-
nology and services supply chain de-

software developed or controlled by 
Chinese companies. 
The pace and pervasiveness of the 
spread in the United States of certain 
connected mobile and desktop applica-
tions and other software developed or 
controlled by persons in the People’s 
Republic of China (PRC), to include 
Hong Kong and Macau (China), con-
tinue to threaten the national secu-
rity, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States. By accessing per-
sonal 
electronic 
devices 
such 
as 
smartphones, tablets, and computers, 
Chinese connected software applica-
tions can access and capture vast 
swaths of information from users, in-
cluding sensitive personally identifi-
able information and private informa-
tion. The continuing activity of the 
PRC and the Chinese Communist Party 
to steal or otherwise obtain United 
States persons’ data makes clear that 
there is an intent to use bulk data col-
lection to advance China’s economic 
and national security agenda. To deal 
with this threat, additional steps are 
required against those who develop or 
control certain Chinese connected soft-
ware applications to protect our na-
tional security. 
The Executive Order prohibits cer-
tain future transactions, as determined 
by the Secretary of Commerce (Sec-
retary), involving the following Chi-
nese connected software applications: 
Alipay, 
CamScanner, 
QQ 
Wallet, 
SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat 
Pay, and WPS Office. The Secretary is 
also directed to: 
(i) continue to evaluate Chinese con-
nected software applications that may 
pose an unacceptable risk to the na-
tional security, foreign policy, or econ-
omy of the United States, and to take 
appropriate action in accordance with 
Executive Order 13873; and 
(ii) in consultation with the Attorney 
General and the Director of National 
Intelligence, provide a report to the 
Assistant to the President for National 
Security Affairs with recommenda-
tions to prevent the sale or transfer of 
United States user data to, or access of 
such data by, foreign adversaries, in-
cluding through the establishment of 
regulations and policies to identify, 
control, and license the export of such 
data. 
I have delegated to the Secretary, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury and the Attorney General, 
the authority to take such actions, in-
cluding adopting appropriate rules and 
regulations, and employing all other 
powers granted to the President by 
IEEPA, as may be necessary to imple-
ment the Executive Order. The heads of 
all executive departments and agencies 
are directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to im-
plement the provisions of the Execu-
tive Order. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

THE WHITE HOUSE, January 5, 2021. 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair

proximately 12:55 p.m. today. 
Accordingly (at 12 o’clock and 6 min-

was called to order by the Speaker at

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. As the House comes 
to order for this important, historic 
meeting, let us be reminded that each 
side, House and Senate, Democrats and 
Republicans, each have 11 Members al-
lowed to be present on the floor. Others 
may be in the gallery. This is at the 
guidance of the Attending Physician 
and the Sergeant at Arms. 
The gentlemen on the Republican 
side of the aisle will please observe so-
cial distancing and the agreement to 
have 11 Members on each side so that 
we can honor the responsibility to this 
Chamber of this House of Representa-
tives. 
Please exit the floor if you do not 
have an assigned role from your leader-
ship. You can share with your staff if 
you want to have a few more, but you 
cannot be that close together on the 
floor of the House with that many peo-
ple in here. 
I thank the Senate, and the Demo-
crats and Republicans, for following 
the rules.

COUNTING 
ELECTORAL 
VOTES— 
JOINT SESSION OF THE HOUSE 
AND SENATE HELD PURSUANT 
TO THE PROVISIONS OF SENATE 
CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 1 
At 12:59 p.m., the Sergeant at Arms, 
Paul D. Irving, announced the Vice 
President and the Senate of the United 
States. 
The Senate entered the Hall of the 
House of Representatives, headed by 
the Vice President and the Secretary of 
the Senate, the Members and officers 
of the House rising to receive them. 
The Vice President took his seat as 
the Presiding Officer of the joint con-
vention of the two Houses, the Speaker 
of the House occupying the chair on his 
left. Senators took seats to the right of 
the rostrum as prescribed by law. 
The joint session was called to order 
by the Vice President. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Vice President, 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The gen-
tleman from Virginia will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Mr. Vice President, 
in order to follow the Speaker’s in-
structions that only a limited number 
of people be on the floor, may I ask 
how one would make an objection or 
make a parliamentary inquiry in the 
future if you are not on the floor but in 
the gallery. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Under sec-
tion 18 of title 3, United States Code, 
debate is not permitted in the joint 
session. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Further parliamen-
tary inquiry. 
Mr. Vice President, I am not at-
tempting to debate. I am trying to find 
out how a parliamentary inquiry or a 
parliamentary point of order would be 
made in following with the Speaker’s 
request that most of us not be on the 
floor. How do you make one of those 
points of order when you don’t know 
what is going to happen later? 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Respectfully, 
the gentleman’s parliamentary inquiry 
constitutes debate, which is not per-
mitted in the joint session under sec-
tion 18 of title 3, United States Code. 
Madam Speaker, Members of Con-
gress, pursuant to the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States, the Sen-
ate and House of Representatives are 
meeting in joint session to verify the 
certificates and count the votes of the 
electors of the several States for Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States. 
After ascertainment has been had 
that the certificates are authentic and 
correct in form, the tellers will count 
and make a list of the votes cast by the 
electors of the several States. 
The tellers on the part of the two 
Houses will take their places at the 
Clerk’s desk. 
The tellers, Mr. BLUNT and Ms. KLO-
BUCHAR on the part of the Senate, and 
Ms. LOFGREN and Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of 
Illinois on the part of the House, took 
their places at the desk. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Without ob-
jection, the tellers will dispense with 
the reading of the formal portions of 
the certificates. 
There was no objection. 
The 
VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
After 
ascertaining that the certificates are 
regular in form and authentic, the tell-
ers will announce the votes cast by the 
electors for each State, beginning with 
Alabama, which the Parliamentarians 
have advised me is the only certificate 
of vote from that State, and purports 
to be a return from the State, and that 
has annexed to it a certificate from an 
authority of that State purporting to 
appoint or ascertain electors. 
Senator BLUNT. Mr. President, the 
certificate of the electoral vote of the 
State of Alabama seems to be regular 
in form and authentic, and it appears 
therefrom that Donald J. Trump of the 
State of Florida received 9 votes for 
President and MICHAEL R. PENCE of the 
State of Indiana received 9 votes for 
Vice President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there 
any objections to counting the certifi-
cate of vote of the State of Alabama 
that the teller has verified appears to 
be regular in form and authentic?

dent.

self and 60 of my colleagues to object

from Arizona. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is the objec-
tion in writing and signed by a Sen-
ator? 
Mr. GOSAR. Yes, it is. 
Senator CRUZ. It is. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. An objection 
presented in writing and signed by both

plies with the law, chapter 1 of title 3,

the objection and Members speaking in 
opposition to the objection. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to object to a number of States 
that did not follow the constitutional 
requirement for selecting electors. 
Madam Speaker, this is something 
that is clear that our Founding Fathers 
debated about as a fundamental deci-
sion of how we choose our President. 
There was a lot of back and forth, if 
anyone reads the founding documents 
of our country, about the different 
versions they went through to ulti-
mately come up with a process where 
each State has elections; each State 
has a process for selecting their elec-
tors and sending them to Washington. 
Madam Speaker, in a number of 
those States, that constitutional proc-
ess was not followed, and that is why 
we are here to object. 
If you look at what the requirement 
says, nowhere in Article II, Section 1

does it give the secretary of state of a 
State that ability; nowhere does it give 
the Governor that ability; nowhere 
does it give a court that ability. It ex-
clusively gives that ability to the leg-
islatures. In fact, in most States, that 
is the process that was followed. But 
for those States, this wasn’t followed. 
Unfortunately, this is not new. We 
have seen over and over again more 
States where the Democratic Party has 
gone in and selectively gone around 
this process. That has to end, Madam 
Speaker. We have to follow the con-
stitutional process. 
Now, there might be reasons why 
some people don’t like the process laid 
out by a legislative body. 
Madam Speaker, I served on one of 
those legislative bodies when I was in 
the State legislature for 12 years. I 
served on the House and Governmental 
Affairs Committee, where we wrote the 
laws for our State’s elections. And I 
can tell you, when we had to make 
changes, those were extensively nego-
tiated. We would have people on both 
sides come. 
Republicans and Democrats, Madam 
Speaker, would get together to work 
through those changes, any minute 
change to how a precinct would func-
tion, to how a change would be made in 
the time of an election, signature re-
quirements, all the many things that 
involve a clerk carrying out the duties 
in each parish, in our case. 
You would see people come and give 
testimony, Madam Speaker. Both sides 
could come. Clerks of court were there 
in the hearing rooms. 
It was an open process, by the way, 
not behind closed doors in a smoke- 
filled room where somebody might 
want to bully a secretary of state to 
get a different version that might ben-
efit them or their party or their can-
didate. That is not what our Founding 
Fathers said is the process. Maybe it is 
how some people wanted to carry it 
out. But they laid out that process. 
So when we would have to make 
those changes, they were in public 
view; they were heavily debated; and 
then, 
ultimately, 
those 
laws 
were 
changed in advance of the election so 
everybody knew what the rules were. 
People on both sides knew how to play 
by the rules before the game started, 
not getting somewhere in the process 
and saying, well, you don’t think it is 
going to benefit you, so you try to go 
around the Constitution. 
That is not how our system works. It 
has gotten out of hand. So President 
Trump has called this out, and Presi-
dent Trump has stood up to it. So 
many of us have stood up to it. 
In fact, over 100 of my colleagues, 
Madam Speaker, asked the Supreme 
Court to address this problem just a 
few weeks ago, and, unfortunately, the 
Court chose to punt. They didn’t an-
swer it one way or the other. They 
didn’t want to get in the middle of this 
discussion. 
We don’t have that luxury today. We 
have to discuss this. We have to fix 
this. 
In fact, on our first full day of this 
Congress, many of us brought legisla-
tion onto the House floor to start fix-
ing the problems with our elections, to 
restore integrity to the election proc-
ess, which has been lost by so many 
millions of Americans. And we had a 
vote. Every single Republican voted to 
reform the process. Every single Demo-
crat voted against it. They don’t want 
to fix this problem. 
But the Constitution is our guide, 
and it is time we start following the 
Constitution. It is time we get back to 
what our Founding Fathers said is the 
process for selecting electors: that is 
the legislatures in public view, not be-
hind closed doors, not smoke-filled 
rooms, not bullying somebody that 
might give you a better ruling. 
Let’s get back to rule of law and fol-
low the Constitution, Madam Speaker. 
The SPEAKER. For what purpose 
does the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. LOFGREN) seek recognition? 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to strike the last word. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LOFGREN) is recog-
nized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, this 
day marks a crossroads for American 
democracy. Those who object to the 
counting of the electoral college votes, 
which reflect the votes of the American 
people, want to substitute their pref-
erences for the voters’ choice. That is 
not what our Constitution requires, 
and it is at odds with our American 
democratic Republic. 
If Congress selects the next President 
instead of the American voters, we 
would have no need for an electoral 
college. In fact, we would have no need 
for Presidential elections at all. We 
would be moving from a government 
elected by the people to a government 
selected by those already governing. 
That is not America. In the United 
States, we abide by the choices of the 
people, not by an elite few. 
The Framers of our Constitution con-
sidered to have Congress select the 
President and specifically rejected it. 
Instead, they wrote Article II and the 
12th Amendment. 
Article II creates the electoral col-
lege, where each State appoints elec-
tors. Laws of all 50 States and D.C. re-
quire electors to vote for the winner of 
the State’s popular election. Each 
State provides for the orderly conduct 
of elections, including lawful chal-
lenges, recounts, and the like. 
The 12th Amendment is what brings 
us to today. It says the electors meet 
in their States. That happened Decem-
ber 14. 
The amendment says the electors 
shall cast their votes, sign and certify 
them, and transmit them to us, sealed. 
That has been done. The sealed enve-
lopes containing the signed and cer-
tified ballots from each State’s elec-
tors reflecting the votes of the people 
are in those mahogany boxes. 
The 12th Amendment directs the Vice 
President, as the President of the Sen-
ate, to do only this: open the sealed en-
velopes and then the votes shall be 
counted. Simple. It doesn’t say counted 
in a manner that some Members of 
Congress or the Vice President might 
prefer. No. The votes are simply to be 
counted as certified and transmitted by 
the States. 
b 1130 
During reconstruction after the Civil 
War, more than one slate of electors 
were appointed by States. Dueling lists 
were sent and protracted processes 
were undertaken in Presidential elec-
tions. And, as a result, to make an or-
derly process, Congress enacted the 
Electoral Count Act of 1887. This law 
governs our proceedings today. The act 
provides 
dispute 
resolution 
mecha-
nisms. 
Under the ECA, if a Governor cer-
tifies a slate of electors and there are 
no competing slates in that State, the 
Governor-certified must be counted. 
Today, every single slate of electors 
won by Joe Biden, or won by Donald 
Trump, got their Governor’s certifi-
cation. Not a single State submitted a 
competing slate. There is no dispute to 
resolve. 
The 2020 election was the most secure 
election conducted in modern history. 
Challenges were resolved by lawful re-
counts and audits. 
The result? 
Vice President Biden won the 2020 
election. 
More than 60 lawsuits were filed con-
testing elements of the election proc-
ess. None of these lawsuits prevailed. 
Why? 
As even President Trump’s own judi-
cial appointees ruled, there was no evi-
dence of any wrongdoing that would 
change the outcome. 
The people spoke. It was not a close 
election. The margin of victory for 
Biden in 2020 was larger than Trump’s 
margin in 2016. In fact, the Biden vic-
tory is one of the most decisive in mod-
ern times, exceeding the margin en-
joyed by Reagan when he defeated Car-
ter in 1980. 
Congress has gathered in a joint ses-
sion to count electoral votes every four 
years since 1789. I understand the dis-
appointment people feel when their 
candidate for President loses. I have 
felt the same several times in my vot-
ing life. 
When that happens, it is not an invi-
tation to upend the Constitution and 
the laws of the United States. It is an 
invitation to work with the new Presi-
dent for the good of the country and to 
wait for the next election in 4 years if 
you are dissatisfied. 
In that spirit, I urge my colleagues 
to uphold the American democracy and 
reject the objection. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
JORDAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
Americans instinctively know there 
was something wrong with this elec-
tion. During the campaign, Vice Presi-
dent Biden would do an event and he

would get 50 people at the event. Presi-
dent Trump, at just one rally, gets 
50,000 people. President Trump in-
creases votes with African Americans; 
increases votes with Hispanic Ameri-
cans; won 19 of 20 bellwether counties; 
won Ohio by 8; Iowa by 8; and Florida 
by 3. President Trump got 11 million 
more votes than he did in 2016, and 
House Republicans won 27 of 27 toss-up 
races. 
But somehow the guy who never left 
his house wins the election? 
Eighty million Americans, 80 million 
of our fellow citizens, Republicans and 
Democrats, have doubts about this 
election; and 60 million people, 60 mil-
lion Americans think it was stolen. 
But Democrats say: No problem. No 
worries. Everything is fine. 
We asked for an investigation. We 
asked Chairman NADLER, Chairwoman 
MALONEY
for an investigation. They 
said no. They wouldn’t want to inves-
tigate something that half the elec-
torate has doubts about. It is just the 
Presidency of the United States. 
Why? Why not one single investiga-
tion? Why not even one single hearing 
over the last 9 weeks in the United 
States House of Representatives? Why? 
Because all the Democrats care about 
is making sure President Trump isn’t 
President. For 41⁄2 years that is all they 
have cared about. 
July 31, 2016, before he was elected 
the first time, Jim Comey’s FBI takes 
out the insurance policy; opens an in-
vestigation on the President based on 
nothing. 
May 17, 2017, Bob Mueller was named 
special counsel. Two years they inves-
tigate the Russia hoax. Nineteen law-
yers, 40 agents and $40 million of tax-
payer money for nothing. 
December 18, 2019, Democrat House 
Members vote to impeach President 
Trump based on an anonymous whistle-
blower with no firsthand knowledge, 
who was biased against the President 
and who worked for Joe Biden. 
But none of that worked. As hard as 
they tried, none of that worked. They 
threw everything they had at him. 
So what did they do next? 
They 
changed 
the 
rules. 
They 
changed the election law and they did 
it in an unconstitutional fashion, and 
that is what we are going to show over 
the next several hours of debate. 
The Constitution is clear, as Whip 
SCALISE just said. State legislatures 
and only State legislatures set election 
law. 
In Arizona, the law says voter reg-
istration ends on October 5. 
Democrats said: We don’t care what 
the law says. 
They went to a court, got an Obama- 
appointed judge to extend it 18 days. 
No debate, as Steve talked about. No 
debate. No discussion. They just did it. 
Pennsylvania, same thing. Pennsyl-
vania laws says mail-in ballots have to 
be in by 8 p.m. election day. 
Democrat Supreme Court said: Nope. 
We are going to extend it. 
Election day doesn’t end on Tuesday 
now. They took it to Friday. Extended 
the election 3 days; not the legislature, 
the partisan Supreme Court. 
Pennsylvania law says mail-in bal-
lots require signature verification. 
Democrat secretary of state said: 
Nope. I am going to decide by myself 
that it doesn’t, for 2.6 million ballots. 
Pennsylvania law says mail-in bal-
lots can’t be processed until election 
day. Some counties said no. And you 
can imagine which counties they were. 
Democrat-run counties said no and al-
lowed ballots to be cured and fixed be-
fore election day. 
They did an end-run around the Con-
stitution in every State that Repub-
licans will object to today. Every sin-
gle one. It was a pattern. It was their 
template. They did it in Arizona. They 
did it in Georgia. They did it in Michi-
gan. They did it in Pennsylvania. They 
did it in Nevada. They did it in Wis-
consin. 
Yet, some of our Members say: Don’t 
worry about it. We shouldn’t do any-
thing. Just let it go. It was just six 
States who violated the Constitution. 
What if it is 10 States next time? 
What if it is 15? What if, in 2024, 2028, it 
is 26 States? What if it is half the 
States that do an end-run around what 
the Constitution clearly spells out? 
We are the final check and balance. 
The authority rests with us, the United 
States Congress, the body closest to 
the American people, right where the 
Founders wanted it. We should do our 
duty. We should object to and vote for 
this objection to the Arizona electors. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, a little 
more than 2 months ago, America per-
formed an extraordinary feat. Under 
some of the most trying circumstances 
in our history, our fellow citizens con-
ducted a free and fair election, vindi-
cating our Founders’ belief once again, 
that we were capable of self govern-
ment and a peaceful transition of 
power. 
On November 3, the American people 
chose Joe Biden to be their next Presi-
dent by an enormous margin. The suc-
cessful conduct of that election, among 
the most secure in American history, 
was not an accident. It was the result 
of the dedicated work of thousands of 
volunteers, canvassers, poll workers, 
electors, and State and local election 
officials. 
When the conduct of any State elec-
tion 
was 
challenged, 
the 
courts, 
through judges appointed by Demo-
crats and those appointed by Repub-
licans, heard unsubstantiated claims of 
fraud, found they had no merit, and 
said so. 
But most important, the American 
people persevered. In the midst of the 
worst pandemic in a century, America 
had one of the most impressive elec-
tions in a century, with historic voter 
turnout. 
Our fellow citizens did their civic 
duty. The question we face today is: 
Will we do ours? 
That we are here, with a substantial 
number of our Members seeking to 
overturn an election is remarkable, 
tragic, and all too predictable, for it is 
the natural result of a locomotive set 
in motion months ago with a myth. 
For weeks and weeks, before, during, 
and after our election, a dangerous 
falsehood was propagated: That our 
election would be marred by massive 
fraud. 
Never mind it was the same election 
which brought the very men and 
women to this Chamber who would 
challenge its results. What value has 
consistency when measured against 
ambition? 
A former Senator from Georgia, re-
marking on a contested election over a 
century ago, said: ‘‘Able men, learned 
men, distinguished men, great men in 
the eyes of the nation, seemed intent 
only on accomplishing a party tri-
umph, without regard to the con-
sequences to the country. That is 
human nature. That is,’’ he said, ‘‘un-
fortunately, party nature.’’ 
Was he right? 
We stand in a House which was once 
the place of giants. Have we become so 
small? Does our oath to uphold the 
Constitution, taken just days ago, 
mean so very little? 
I think not. I believe, to quote our 
dear departed friend, Elijah Cummings, 
that we are better than that. I think 
Elijah would be proud that the debate 
here today is not between Democrats 
and Republicans, and that some Repub-
licans, including the Republican leader 
of the Senate, remain devoted to the 
principle that we are a nation of laws, 
not individuals, let alone a single indi-
vidual. 
It may seem unfair to the new Mem-
bers who have only just taken the oath 
for the first time, that they should be 
so soon tested with one of the most 
consequential votes they may cast, no 
matter how long they serve. But it is 
so, and none of us can shrink from that 
responsibility. Nor can we console our-
selves with the intoxicating fiction 
that we can break that oath without 
consequence because doing so will not 
succeed in overturning the election. An 
oath is no less broken when the break-
ing fails to achieve its end. 
We must be mindful that any who 
seek to overturn an election will do in-
jury to our Constitution, whatever the 
result. For just as the propagation of 
that dangerous myth about this elec-
tion made this moment inevitable, our 
actions today will put another train in 
motion. This election will not be over-
turned. 
But what about the next? Or the one 
after that? 
What shall we say when our demo-
cratic legacy is no more substantial 
than the air, except that we brought 
trouble to our own house and inherited 
the wind? 
This isn’t the first time we have had 
a contentious election, and it won’t be 
the last. In 1800, John Adams lost a 
closely contested election to Thomas

Jefferson, in the first peaceful transi-
tion of power from one party to an-
other in our history. Adams was hardly 
pleased with the result, choosing to 
skip the inaugural activities, but he 
did what leaders are required to do in a 
democratic 
government 
when 
they 
lose. He went home. He went home. 
Jefferson would later refer to his vic-
tory as the Revolution of 1800, but mar-
veled that the Revolution had occurred 
‘‘by the rational and peaceful instru-
ments of reform, the suffrage of the 
people.’’ 
It has never been our place to over-
turn an election, and if we hope to re-
main a democracy, it never will be. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I join 
the objection to counting votes of elec-
tors from my home State of Arizona, as 
well as Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wis-
consin, Michigan, and Nevada, because 
election integrity is the heart of our 
American constitutional republic? 
In a representative form of govern-
ment, we must be able to trust that our 
elections accurately represent the will 
of the American voter. This is the ap-
propriate forum anticipated and pro-
vided for by our Founders to debate 
whether this election complied with 
the Constitution that we have all 
sworn to protect. 
Every particular of the Constitution 
is to be protected, including Article II, 
Section 1. The debate as to the legit-
imacy of the 2020 Presidential election 
has been suppressed by the left and its 
propagandists in the media until today. 
State legislatures are required to de-
termine the manner in which electors 
are chosen. Arizona names its electors 
on the general election ballot and iden-
tifies what candidate those electors are 
required to vote for should that can-
didate obtain the majority of votes in 
the general election. 
As part of the manner for deter-
mining electors, Arizona also estab-
lishes deadlines for voter registration. 
The deadline has been in place for 30 
years. 
b 1345 
This year, that voter registration 
deadline was October 5. Early voting 
commenced 2 days later. Five days be-
fore the deadline, a group filed a law-
suit demanding that Arizona election 
officials not enforce the deadline. 
The Federal District Court decided 
that since other States have a deadline 
later than Arizona’s and some even 
allow for registration when voting, 
that Arizona’s new deadline would be a 
time he chose, not the legislature’s 
timeline. 
The appellate court effectively over-
turned the lower court ruling and 
noted that the Arizona deadline estab-
lished by the State legislature was 
sound and appropriate and complied 
with the Constitution. But the appel-
late court merely shortened the exten-
sion, the bypassing of the deadline to 
10 days. 
The appellate court, without legal 
justification, also decided that every-
one who registered after the legal dead-
line, but before the deadline created by 
judicial fiat, could still vote. 
Note that the Arizona legislature was 
no longer in control of determining the 
manner 
of 
appointing 
Presidential 
electors because the court had set a 
new deadline, even though the appel-
late court found the legislature’s dead-
line was constitutionally sound. 
During that window, more than 32,000 
voters registered in Maricopa County 
alone. Here are copies of those voter 
registration records. In going around 
the deadline set by the legislature, the 
court ignored the Arizona legislature’s 
obligation and right to direct the man-
ner of choosing Presidential electors as 
set forth in Article II, Section 1. 
As a consequence of that judicial 
usurpation, more than 32,000 people 
were allowed to unlawfully cast ballots 
in Arizona’s Presidential election in 
2020. 
The Arizona legislature seeks an 
independent audit of the election. The 
Governor refuses now to call them into 
a special session. The Maricopa County 
Board of Supervisors has refused to 
comply with legislative subpoenas. In 
Arizona, the people who control the 
evidence related to the election have 
done everything possible to prevent an 
independent audit directed by the leg-
islature. 
Arizonans have used the limited 
amount of records available to inves-
tigate the 2020 Presidential election. Of 
a limited sample of 1,000 addresses of 
voters, they found 539 voters did not 
live at the addresses on the voter rolls. 
Here is a stack of 1,000 declaration of 
affidavits supporting that. 
I object to counting the votes of Ari-
zona 
electors 
because 
the 
Federal 
courts went around the legislatively 
constructed mechanism for choosing 
Arizona’s Presidential electors, allow-
ing tens of thousands of voters to un-
lawfully cast votes. The court usurped 
a key component of the Arizona legis-
lature’s manner of selecting Presi-
dential electors, thus violating Article 
II, Section 1. The legislature is being 
obstructed in its efforts. And what lit-
tle evidence we have and what little in-
formation we have has produced this 
kind of evidence, which indicates a sig-
nificant problem with the integrity of 
the Presidential election. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD
my written comments, to-
gether with the voter registration 
records that reflect the 32,000 registra-
tions permitted in contravention of 
State law; letters and resolutions from 
Arizona legislators pertaining to the 
count of votes from electors; along 
with approximately 1,000 affidavits and 
declarations pertaining to potential 
voter fraud in Arizona in the 2020 Pres-
idential election; and the statement of 
Congressman RANDY WEBER of Texas. 
DECEMBER 31, 2020. 
DEAR VICE PRESIDENT PENCE: As the Chair-
woman of the Arizona House Elections Com-
mittee, I write to you with upmost urgency 
to communicate to you several occurrences 
that thwart our ability as legislators to in-
vestigate legitimate and concerning allega-
tions of election fraud in the most recent 
general election. On December 14, 2020, Ari-
zona sent an alternate slate of electors, 
along with a resolution from 21 current and 
8 newly elected legislators asking you to re-
frain from accepting the Biden electors until 
we could adequately investigate these claims 
of fraud. 
Soon after the election, I requested an 
Elections Committee discovery hearing in 
order to use subpoena power to acquire the 
voting machines and ballots in order to do a 
comprehensive and forensic audit. I was told 
that it was not a good idea and was denied 
the ability. I continued to request the hear-
ing with the Speaker of the House, asked 
publicly, and tried every avenue to no avail. 
A full month later on December 9th, the Sen-
ate President authorized a hearing via the 
Judiciary committee, and that did result in 
subpoenas to the Maricopa County Super-
visors (who oversee the elections process) 
that have yet, as of the writing of this letter, 
been complied with. 
Court cases have been dismissed due to not 
having evidence, however our efforts to do an 
audit to obtain such evidence have been sup-
pressed. We held a hearing on 11/30/2020 with 
Rudy Giuliani to at least hear testimony 
from citizens who experienced irregularities, 
along with subject matter experts who re-
ported severe irregularities and probable 
tampering with the machine apparatus. On 
11/30/2020, a group of Arizona citizens re-
ported publicly that they had uncovered 
with great confidence a minimum estimation 
of 160,000 fraudulent voters, based on over 
1000 declarations/affidavits collected. This 
supports an earlier document submitted to 
the Attorney General and would largely im-
pact the outcome of the election. 
We have experienced obstruction at every 
turn. For your reference, I have itemized, in 
Exhibit A, many of the various ways we have 
been stopped from investigating claims of 
fraud and gross irregularities. It is my hope 
that you will see that the Arizona Presi-
dential election is still in dispute and unre-
solved. We call on you to take this into con-
sideration as you perform your duties on 
January 6th, and not accept the electors 
until we have resolution to these matters. 
With utmost respect, 
KELLY J. TOWNSEND, 
Senator-Elect. 
EXHIBIT A 
1. Requests from the House Elections 
Chairwoman (myself) and the House Federal 
Relations Chairman (Mark Finchem) to hold 
an evidentiary hearing were repeatedly de-
nied and have yet to be honored. Multiple 
Chairmen of various committees requested a 
hearing in order to investigate claims, to no 
avail. We were forced to hold an unofficial 
hearing on November 30th where many came 
forward with very concerning evidence and 
claims. 
2. The Senate Judiciary Committee hear-
ing was not held until 41 days after the elec-
tion on 12/14/2020, the same day as the Elec-
tors were to cast their votes. This delay ren-
dered the hearing of little effect regarding 
having confidence in the correct votes cast. 
The Chairman thus issued a subpoena for the 
equipment and ballots, but the Maricopa 
Board of Supervisors has countersued and 
refuse to comply. They will not release any 
machine or ballot info, even though within 
the RFP for the Dominion machines, it is 
stated that their key features are their abil-
ity to conduct hand counts, perform risk 
limiting audits, and publish ballot images 
and adjudication records with markings on a

public website, calling it their open data ini-
tiative. Now that they are being asked for it, 
they are refusing to make it available, citing 
voter confidentiality. There is no voter in-
formation contained in the machine or on a 
ballot, however, so that reasoning is insuffi-
cient. Their inaction and nonfeasance pre-
vent us from proper discovery. 
3. I, along with several others, requested 
the Governor to call us in for special session 
to be able to deal with the issue. It is our un-
derstanding that we cannot enforce the sub-
poena for equipment and ballots unless we 
are in session. His ongoing unwillingness to 
call us into session to address these issues 
had kept us from adequate discovery. On 12/ 
02/2020, Governor Doug Ducey was asked by 
the media if he was going to honor the Legis-
lator’s request for a special session. He pro-
ceeded to incorrectly name Monday January 
13th as our first day back in regular session. 
In response, the reporter asked, ‘‘So you see 
no need for a special session to look at any 
of these issues or the issue of Presidential 
electors...,’’ to which the Governor inter-
rupted and said, ‘‘I’ll see the Legislature in 
January.’’ 
4. The House leadership attempted to deter 
Representative Bret Roberts from sending a 
letter to Attorney General Brnovich and the 
Maricopa County Board of Supervisors re-
garding the accurate performance of a hand 
count based on the statutory requirement to 
do so by precinct, versus vote center. By 
doing a hand count based on voting centers, 
it renders it impossible to tell if there was a 
rogue precinct involved in fraud. Neverthe-
less, Rep. Robert’s efforts to enforce statute 
were thwarted by House leadership. 
5. One week prior to the Electors voting, 
on December 7th, the House and Senate lead-
ership closed the buildings in the name of 
COVID–19, preventing any in-person hearings 
or work to be performed. This greatly hin-
dered our ability to push for discovery re-
garding election integrity during the last 
days before the Elector’s votes were cast. 
6. The Maricopa County Board of Super-
visors held a closed meeting on 11/20/2020 in 
order to certify the election results, where 
the public was not allowed to participate and 
ask questions. Prior to that meeting, on 12/ 
08/2020, Merissa Hamilton (a data integrity 
expert) delivered to the Attorney General a 
statistically significant listing of deceased 
voters that received a ballot and those de-
ceased who actually returned a ballot. At the 
aforementioned meeting, the Maricopa Coun-
ty Elections Director Ray Valenzuela stated 
that the list of deceased voters casting a bal-
lot was mere folklore and dismissed it as a 
nonissue. This accusation is still pending an 
investigation. 
7. After submitting a public records re-
quest for the Federal only voters who cast a 
ballot in the 2020 General election, I was told 
by a staff member that the Elections Direc-
tor was ‘‘vetting the list’’ before he gave it 
to me. I did not request a cleaned-up list of 
voters, but the list in its entirety. This di-
minished my confidence in that list, that I 
have a true representation of persons who 
cast a ballot that cannot establish their 
identity or citizenship. 
8. Arizona State House leadership pre-
vented Legislators from issuing press re-
leases having to do with the election that did 
not conform to their own opinion. This di-
minished our ability to communicate to the 
public our concerns about how the election 
and post procedures were being handled. 
9. On 12/01/2020, I requested the Attorney 
General’s Elections Integrity office to inves-
tigate the claims made at the November 30th 
Giuliani hearing and provided them the link. 
I was told that none of the items listed at 
the Giuliani hearing would be investigated 
by that office. 
10. The Maricopa County Recorder at-
tended more than one DefCon conference 
that focused on the ability to hack voting 
machines. The Legislature was never in-
formed that the outcome of these con-
ferences recommended that elected officials 
be notified due to unprotected ports on the 
machines, passwords left unset or left in de-
fault configurations and security features of 
the underlying commercial hardware were 
left unused or even disabled. It was rec-
ommended that to improve election security, 
paper ballots should be used, and a rigorous 
post-election audit be performed. We learned 
about this issue via social media, and it was 
obfuscated by the Election officials. 
11. Arizona Republican State Chair Kelli 
Ward reports the following malfeasance and 
obstruction: 
a. No allowed review of the digitally adju-
dicated ballots—over 200,000. 
b. Only 100 of the duplicated ballots re-
viewed—3% error rate in favor of President 
Trump. Maricopa County refused to look at 
the other 28,000 ballots. 
c. No meaningful signature verification. 
County 
employees 
doing 
signature 
verification offsite, over the internet, with-
out oversight, and at times at a rate of 30 
signatures or more per minute. 
12. The Secretary of State took 24 days to 
answer a public records request by Merissa 
Hamilton, asking them to deliver the meet-
ing minutes from their technical committee 
to certify the Dominion voting equipment. 
Only after four requests and the involvement 
of the Ombudsman did she obtain the infor-
mation. The results of that request showed 
that despite the voting equipment not being 
able to calculate the votes properly, which 
was never addressed, the machines were still 
certified. The Maricopa County RFP for the 
Dominion equipment did not give the public 
a chance to give input on the procurement. 
There was never any discussion or an offer of 
various options to choose from. The Board of 
Supervisors went straight to a vote with no 
discussion and approved the machines unani-
mously. 
13. There are multiple/numerous examples 
of how on election day observers and poll 
workers were prevented from overseeing the 
various procedures, thereby undermining 
confidence that there was no illegal activity 
and violating Arizona’s statutes regarding 
election integrity. We have had no formal in-
vestigation into the vast majority of these 
accusations. 
SUMMARY 
Arizona has many unresolved issues that 
we would like to have investigated in order 
to confidently say our electors voted for the 
true victor in the 2020 Presidential election. 
We still have outstanding issues left unre-
solved and are being stopped at nearly every 
turn from investigating. For example, the 
Maricopa County Recorder’s office started 
counting early ballots 14 days before election 
day. During that time, the backup server 
was removed each night by a Dominion em-
ployee. This is of significant concern because 
the information on those servers could have 
been manipulated and/or provided to nefar-
ious people as to how many ballots/votes 
were needed to change the results of the 
election as time went on. 
Many in the Legislature believe that if we 
are able to do a forensic audit, we could in-
vestigate these and other serious claims 
brought forward to us. However, as you can 
see by the list above (not exhaustive but 
brief for your benefit) we have many entities 
who appear to be blocking our efforts to get 
to the bottom of the issue. One can only ask, 
in a supposedly secure and fair election, why 
discovery is being quashed. 
CONCLUSION 
It is asked that all of these issues be con-
sidered when contemplating the eleven Ari-
zona electoral votes. Our election is still in 
dispute, and we have obfuscation and at-
tempts at running out the clock to prevent 
discovery of the facts. We believe it is impos-
sible to conclusively declare a winner in Ari-
zona and pray that you would refrain from 
counting the electoral votes from our state, 
and consider the alternate slate should we be 
able to establish validity to the various 
claims of election fraud on such a scale that 
would change the outcome. 
Thank you, kindly, for your attention to 
these matters. 
A RESOLUTION TO CONGRESS 
Whereas, it is the constitutional and legal 
obligation of the Legislature of the State of 
Arizona to ensure that the state’s presi-
dential electors truly represent the will of 
the voters of Arizona; and 
Whereas, pursuant to the direction of Con-
gress as set forth in United States Code, title 
3, section 1 as authorized by Article II, sec-
tion 1, clause 4 of the Constitution of the 
United States, and state law adopted pursu-
ant thereto, Arizona conducted an election 
for presidential electors on the Tuesday next 
after the first Monday in November of 2020– 
that is, on November 3, 2020; and 
Whereas, that election was marred by 
irregularities so significant as to render it 
highly doubtful whether the certified results 
accurately represent the will of the voters; 
and 
Whereas, Congress has further directed in 
U.S. Code, title 3, section 2 that when a state 
‘‘has held an election for the purpose of 
choosing electors, and has failed to make a 
choice on the day prescribed by law, the elec-
tors may be appointed on a subsequent day 
in such manner as the legislature of such 
State may direct’’; and 
Whereas, that provision implicitly recog-
nizes that Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of 
the U.S. Constitution grants to each state 
legislature, with stated limitations, the sole 
authority to prescribe the manner of ap-
pointing electors for that state; and 
Whereas, the United States Supreme Court 
and other courts have explained that when a 
state legislature directs the manner of ap-
pointing electors, it does so pursuant to a 
grant of authority from the U.S. Constitu-
tion rather than by reason of any state con-
stitutional or other legal provision; that this 
authority may be exercised by the legisla-
ture alone without other aspects of the nor-
mal lawmaking process; and that the state 
legislature’s authority over the appointment 
of presidential electors is plenary and may 
be resumed at any time; and 
Whereas, because U.S. Code, title 3, section 
7 mandates that all presidential electors 
vote for President and Vice President of the 
United States on December 14, 2020, it is im-
possible to pursue the Legislature’s preferred 
course of action, which would be for Arizo-
na’s voters to participate in a new and fair 
and free presidential election before that 
date; and 
Whereas, in view of the facts heretofore re-
cited, the Legislature is required to exercise 
its best judgment as to which slate of elec-
tors the voters prefer; and 
Whereas, legal precedent exists where in 
1960 the State of Hawaii sent an alternate 
slate of electors while the Presidential elec-
tion was still in question in order to meet 
the deadline of selecting electors, and upon 
recount the alternate slate of electors’ bal-
lots were ultimately counted; and 
Whereas, the undersigned have an obliga-
tion to find the truth. For this reason, on 
several occasions since November 3, we state 
lawmakers have requested fact-finding hear-
ings to include a comprehensive and inde-
pendent forensic audit. At this time, no such

audit has been authorized. This leaves the 
uncertainty of the election results in a state 
that requires further investigation and reso-
lution; and 
Whereas, ongoing election irregularity liti-
gation is currently active, and there are un-
resolved disputes by both the Legislature 
and at least one Presidential campaign, ren-
dering the election inconclusive as of date of 
signing of this letter, 
Therefore, be it 
Resolved by the undersigned Legislators, 
members of the Arizona House and Senate, 
request that the alternate 11 electoral votes 
be accepted for to Donald J. Trump or to 
have all electoral votes nullified completely 
until a full forensic audit can be conducted. 
Be it further resolved that the United States 
Congress is not to consider a slate of electors 
from the State of Arizona until the Legisla-
ture deems the election to be final and all 
irregularities resolved.

Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition to the ob-
jection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank you first and all my dear beloved 
colleagues for your love and tender-
ness, which my family and I will never 
forget. 
Abraham Lincoln, whose name is a 
comfort to us all, said: ‘‘We have got 
the best government the world ever 
knew.’’ 
It is best because the first three 
words of the Constitution tell us who 
governs here: We the People. 
Watch this proceeding today and tell 
the world with pride, as Lincoln did, 
about the brilliant meaning and prom-
ise of our country. Our Government be-
longs to the people. 
As President Ford said: Here the peo-
ple rule. 
Today we are in the people’s House to 
complete 
the 
people’s 
process 
for 
choosing the people’s President. We as-
semble into joint session for a solemn 
purpose that we have all sworn a sa-
cred oath to faithfully discharge. The 
12th Amendment obligates each and 
every one of us to count the electoral 
votes to recognize the will of the peo-
ple in the 2020 Presidential election. 
We are not here, Madam Speaker, to 
vote for the candidate we want. We are 
here to recognize the candidate the 
people actually voted for in the States. 
Madam Speaker, the 2020 election is 
over and the people have spoken. Joe 
Biden received more than 80 million 
votes. Seven million more than Presi-
dent Trump. A number larger than any 
other President has received in U.S. 
history. The sweeping popular victory 
translated into an electoral college vic-
tory of 306–232, a margin which Presi-
dent Trump pronounced a landslide 
when he won by those exact same num-
bers in 2016. 
So now we count the electoral votes 
that were just delivered to us in the 
beautiful mahogany cases brought by 
those hardworking Senate pages. These 
mahogany cases contain only the 538 
electoral votes that were sent in by the 
States, not the 159 million ballots that 
were cast by our constituents. Those 
were counted 2 months ago by hun-
dreds of thousands of election officials 
and poll workers across America who 
risked their health and even their lives 
in the time of COVID to deliver what 
our Department of Homeland Security 
called the most secure election in 
American history. Many of these offi-
cials have endured threats of retribu-
tion, violence, and even death just for 
doing their jobs. 
Just as the popular vote was for 
Biden, so was the electoral vote. On 
December 15, Senate Majority Leader 
MITCH MCCONNELL recognized it. ‘‘The 
electoral college has spoken,’’ the Sen-
ator 
said 
from 
the 
Senate 
floor. 
‘‘Today I want to congratulate Presi-
dent-elect Joe Biden.’’ 
Yet, we have seen escalating attacks 
on our election with unfounded claims 
of fraud and corruption. More than 60 
lawsuits have been brought to date 
seeking to overturn the results. They 
have failed repeatedly and they have 
failed spectacularly. 
Every objection we hear today ma-
ligning our States and their officials— 
both Republican and Democrat—has 
been litigated, adjudicated, and oblit-
erated in both Federal and State 
Courts. The President has not just had 
his day in court, Madam Speaker, he 
has had more than 2 months in court 
looking for a judge to embrace these 
arguments. In more than 50 cases, 
Madam Speaker, at least 88 different 
judges, including many appointed by 
the President himself, have meticu-
lously rejected the President’s claims 
of fraud and corruption. 
Take Georgia U.S. District Court 
Judge 
Steven 
Grimberg, 
who 
was 
named to the bench by President 
Trump last year. He rejected President 
Trump’s prayer to block certification 
of Biden’s victory in Georgia, saying it 
‘‘has no basis in fact or law.’’ 
Take U.S. District Judge Brett Lud-
wig, another Trump nominee who took 
the bench in September. He dismissed a 
lawsuit seeking to overturn the results 
in 
Wisconsin, 
calling 
it 
‘‘extraor-
dinary.’’ 
He said: ‘‘A sitting President who did 
not prevail in his bid for reelection has 
asked for Federal Court help in setting 
aside the popular vote based on . . . 
issues he plainly could have raised be-
fore the vote occurred. 
‘‘This court allowed the plaintiff the 
chance to make his case, and he has 
lost on the merits.’’ 
Trump has asked for the rule of law 
to be followed, Judge Ludwig observed, 
and he said definitively: It has been. 
I have been a constitutional law pro-
fessor for 30 years, and if I were to test 
my students on these decisions, it 
would be the easiest test in the world 
because the plaintiffs have lost nearly 
every case and every issue in the most 
sweeping terms. That is all they would 
have to remember. There is no basis in 
fact or law to justify the unprece-
dented relief that is being requested of 
nullifying these elections. 
We are here to count the votes. Let 
us do our job. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman 
from Colorado is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Madam Speaker, to 
ease everyone’s nerve, I want Members 
to all know that I am not here to chal-
lenge anyone to a duel like Alexander 
Hamilton or Aaron Burr. 
Madam Speaker, my primary objec-
tion to the counting of the electoral 
votes of the State of Arizona is based 
on the Constitution and the direction 
of State legislatures through State 
law, as spelled out in the following two 
clauses of Article II, Section 1, Clause 
2: ‘‘Each State shall appoint, in such 
manner as the legislature thereof may 
direct, a number of electors.’’ 
And the election clause of the Con-
stitution provides State legislatures 
with explicit authority to prescribe 
‘‘the times, places, and manner of hold-
ing elections.’’ 
For more than three decades, Arizona 
law, set by the State legislature, has 
required that voter registration end no 
later than 29 days before an election. 
This is clear. It is law, unless amend-
ed by the State legislature. This is the 
way it needs to be carried out. 
In Arizona, the deadline for voter 
registration for the 2020 Presidential 
election was October 5, 2020. Using 
COVID as a reasoning, Democrats filed 
a lawsuit to extend this deadline by 18 
days. An injunction was made by an 
Obama-appointed judge preventing the 
Arizona secretary of state from enforc-
ing the constitutional deadline set by 
the State legislature. 
As a result of this frivolous, partisan 
lawsuit, 10 extra days were added via

judicial fiat to allow voter registra-
tion. These 10 days were added after 
voting had already begun. This is com-
pletely 
indefensible. 
You 
cannot 
change the rules of an election while it 
is underway and expect the American 
people to trust it. 
Now, in this 10-day period, at least 
30,000 new voters were registered to 
vote in Arizona. All of these votes are 
unconstitutional. It does not matter if 
they voted for President Trump or if 
they voted for Vice President Biden. 
They did not register in time for the 
election. The law states October 5. Ei-
ther we have laws or we do not. 
If we allow State election laws as set 
forth by the State legislatures to be ig-
nored and manipulated on the whims of 
partisan lawsuits, unelected bureau-
crats, unlawful procedures, and arbi-
trary rules, then our constitutional Re-
public will cease to exist. 
The oath I took this past Sunday to 
defend and support the Constitution 
makes it necessary for me to object to 
this travesty. Otherwise, the laws 
passed by the legislative branch merely 
become suggestions to be accepted, re-
jected, or manipulated by those who 
did not pass them. 
Madam Speaker, I have constituents 
outside of this building right now. I 
promised my voters to be their voice. 
In this branch of government in which 
I now serve, it is my separate but equal 
obligation to weigh in on this election 
and object. 
Are we not a government of, by, and 
for the people? 
They know that this election is not 
right; and as their Representative, I 
am sent here to represent them. I will 
not allow the people to be ignored. 
Madam Speaker, it is my duty under 
the U.S. Constitution to object to the 
counting of the electoral votes of the 
State of Arizona. The Members who 
stand here today and accept the results 
of this concentrated, coordinated, par-
tisan effort by Democrats, where every 
fraudulent vote cancels out the vote of 
an honest America, has sided with ex-
tremists on the left. 
The United States Congress needs to 
make an informed decision, and that 
starts with this objection. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. MAST). 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I rise as 
well to support the objection, and I rise 
with the simple question: Can the 
Chair honestly tell Americans, with a 
pending Supreme Court case over legal 
observers not being allowed to observe 
and inspect signatures, that the laws 
and the Constitution of that State 
were not violated to change voting out-
comes? 
Madam Speaker, I will wait for a re-
sponse. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. MAST) has 25 seconds re-
maining. 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I will re-
peat my question. 
Can you honestly tell Americans, 
with a pending Supreme Court case 
over legal observers not being able to 
observe and inspect signatures, that 
the laws and Constitution of Arizona 
were not violated to change voting out-
comes? 
And I will wait for a response. 
The SPEAKER. The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
b 1400 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today 
is an important day. In 1862, during the 
depths of the Civil War, President Lin-
coln submitted his annual message to 
Congress, to this body, and in it, he 
wrote the following: ‘‘Fellow citizens, 
we cannot escape history. We, of this 
Congress and this administration, will 
be remembered in spite of ourselves. 
. . . The fiery trial through which we 
pass will light us down, in honor or dis-
honor, to the latest generation. . . . We 
shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the 
last best hope of Earth.’’ 
Madam Speaker, we gather today to 
ensure the survival of our grand Amer-
ican experiment, the greatest democ-
racy this world has ever known, and 
there are millions of people watching 
today’s proceedings. The eyes of the 
world are on us now, my colleagues, 
wondering if we will keep the faith, 
wondering if our constitutional Repub-
lic will hold. 
Will we adhere to our Constitution, 
that solemn visionary document that 
has guided us so well for so long and 
enabled the peaceful transfer of power 
for the last 230 years? 
Will we continue to be a country pre-
mised on the consent of the governed, a 
Congress that respects the will of the 
people, and a Republic that will en-
dure? 
Madam Speaker, those are the ques-
tions before us today. With respect to 
my new colleague from Colorado, the 
question is not whether Joe Biden was 
elected the 46th President of the 
United States. He clearly was. The peo-
ple of Arizona, like so much of the 
country, spoke clearly and resound-
ingly. They voted in record numbers, 
and over 81 million Americans selected 
Joe Biden as the next President. 
Now, today, we hear from some in 
this Chamber—not all, but some of my 
colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle—vague claims of fraud. 
No substance. 
No evidence. 
No facts. 
No explanation for why over 88 
judges across this land have rejected 
the very same claims. 
Madam Speaker, the bottom line is 
this. As my colleague, Representative 
RASKIN, so eloquently put it, the people 
have spoken, and that is why, on De-
cember 14, the electoral college met to 
certify the election of a duly elected 
President, just as they have done for 
centuries during terrible world wars, 
recessions, depressions, plagues, and 
pandemics. 
They met their duty, and they once 
again rose to the occasion and certified 
the election. And the question now is, 
will we do ours? 
Now, 
I 
know 
there 
are 
many 
textualists among us, many of my col-
leagues who would understand that the 
Constitution must guide our work 
today. And the Constitution is crystal 
clear: Our duty today is a narrow one. 
Article II, Section 1, Clause 3 reads: 
‘‘The President of the Senate shall, in 
the presence of the Senate and House 
of Representatives, open all the certifi-
cates, and the votes shall then be 
counted. The person having the great-
est number of votes for President shall 
be the President.’’ 
That is it, period. Our job is not to 
replace the judgment made by the 
American people with our own. Yet, 
that is precisely what so many of my 
House and Senate Republican col-
leagues ask this body to do, to sub-
stitute their judgment for the ex-
pressed will of the American people. 
In America, we don’t do that. In the 
United States, we accept the results of 
free and fair elections. 
Madam Speaker, we don’t ignore the 
will of the voters and attempt to in-
stall a preferred candidate into power. 
That doesn’t happen here. 
Madam Speaker, I will close with 
this. Our duty, our task, is a very sim-
ple one: to honor the voice of the peo-
ple, to honor our Constitution, to 
count the votes, to certify this elec-
tion, and begin to heal this great coun-
try of ours. 
I pray each of us may find the cour-
age to do so. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the objec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Louisiana is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, we have a solemn responsi-
bility today. We must vote to sustain 
objections to slates of electors sub-
mitted by States that we genuinely be-
lieve clearly violated the Constitution 
in the Presidential election of 2020. 
This is the threshold legal question 
before us, and it is an issue before us 
for the State of Arizona. We have to re-
peat this for emphasis because a lot of 
people seem to be confused. 
Because judges and not the State leg-
islature changed the rules of the elec-
tion, Arizona clearly violated the plain 
language of Article II, Section 1 of the 
Constitution in its selection of Presi-
dential electors. 
The Framers of our Constitution rec-
ognized that elections were susceptible 
to corruption. We all know that. So, 
how did they fix it? How did they pro-
vide for that? They created the elec-
toral college as a safeguard, and they 
expressly empowered State legislatures 
to ensure the integrity of our unique 
election system. 
Only the State legislatures, because 
they are a full body of representatives 
and not rogue officials, were given the 
authority to direct the manner of ap-
pointing Presidential electors because 
it was so important.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H84 
January 6, 2021 
The Supreme Court has acknowl-
edged this over and over. They pre-
viously affirmed in Article II, Section 
1, Clause 2: ‘‘The appointment of these 
electors is thus placed absolutely and 
wholly with the legislatures of the sev-
eral States.’’ That authority can never 
be taken away or abdicated. 
The Arizona Legislature did enact de-
tailed rules and procedures that the 
State was supposed to follow to choose 
its electors. But in the months pre-
ceding the 2020 election, as we have 
heard—and by the way, a thousand 
pages of evidence have just been sub-
mitted on the facts on this—those well- 
established rules and procedures were 
deliberately changed. 
They weren’t changed by the legisla-
ture, friends. They were changed by 
judges. And those actions taken by the 
judiciary were not limited to mere in-
terpretations of existing law. No, they 
were substantive, wholesale changes to 
those statutes. 
Madam Speaker, that is a usurpation 
of the authority that the legislature 
had. That usurpation was repeated 
across the country this year. It is the 
primary reason—it is one of the rea-
sons why the election of 2020 became 
riddled with an unprecedented number 
of serious allegations of fraud and 
irregularities all over the country. 
National polls, it has been said, indi-
cate that a huge percentage of Ameri-
cans now have serious doubts about not 
just the outcome of this Presidential 
contest but also the future reliability 
of our election system itself. 
Since we are convinced that the elec-
tion laws in Arizona and some other 
key States were changed in this uncon-
stitutional manner, we have a responsi-
bility today. The slates of electors pro-
duced under those modified laws are 
thus unconstitutional. They are not 
‘‘regularly given’’ or ‘‘lawfully cer-
tified,’’ as required by the Electoral 
Count Act, and they are invalid on 
their face. That is just the conclusion 
that you have to reach. 
Madam Speaker, given these inescap-
able facts, we believe we have no 
choice today but to vote to sustain ob-
jections to those slates of electors. 
Mr. RASKIN and others today have 
cited the 12th Amendment, and they 
cite Article II, Section 1, Clause 3—re-
member that, Clause 3. And they have 
asserted that Congress has only one 
narrow role today; we are just supposed 
to count the electoral votes that have 
been submitted. But those advocates 
have overlooked a critical first prin-
ciple. 
Their assertion is only true so long 
as Congress first is convinced that the 
electoral votes were not produced by a 
process that violated the Constitution 
is there. We have to get through Clause 
2 of Article II, Section 1, before we get 
to Clause 3 is the point. 
Look, in our unique system, Congress 
is positioned as the last bulwark in a 
Presidential election to ensure the 
Constitution has been followed. Indeed, 
just two decades ago, the Supreme 
Court spoke to this. They plainly ac-
knowledged this important delibera-
tive role of Congress. It was the famous 
Bush v. Gore litigation that everybody 
remembers from 2000. 
In a per curiam opinion—meaning all 
nine Justices, that it was unanimous— 
they noted strict adherence to the pro-
visions of the Electoral Count Act may 
create ‘‘a ‘safe harbor’ for a State inso-
far as congressional consideration of 
its electoral votes is concerned.’’ 
However, unanimously, the Court 
said since title 3, section 5 contains a 
principle of Federal law that would as-
sure finality of the State’s determina-
tion if they followed all the proscrip-
tions there, if the will of the legisla-
ture is attempted to be changed by a 
State court, that is a problem. That, 
they said, Congress might deem to be a 
change in the law. 
That is precisely why we are here 
right now. Go read Bush v. Gore, and 
you will see this. 
Chief Justice William Rehnquist and 
Justices Scalia and Thomas joined in a 
concurring opinion 8 days later, and 
they reiterated this point. 
A significant departure from the leg-
islature’s scheme for appointing Presi-
dential electors presents a Federal 
question. It is a big problem for us, and 
it is one we cannot get around. That is 
why we are here. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues today to look at the facts, to 
follow the law, and to follow our con-
gressional oath. We are supposed to 
support and defend the Constitution. 
That is what we do here today. I urge 
everyone to do the right thing. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, 
this exercise in futility that Congress 
is undertaking is at the behest of Re-
publican Members of Congress. The ef-
fort to overturn the Presidential elec-
tion and grant Donald Trump 4 more 
years is the motivation behind it. And 
to continue a baseless conspiracy- 
fueled threat to our democracy makes 
no sense because there is no viable con-
stitutional or legal path to overturn 
the election that will make Vice Presi-
dent Biden and Senator HARRIS Presi-
dent and Vice President of the United 
States after January 20. 
One certain outcome of this whole 
process is the weakening of our democ-
racy and the threatening of our democ-
racy. Beginning with Arizona, Congress 
is being asked to chase down a rabbit 
hole baseless, discredited, and judi-
cially discarded fringe conspiracy theo-
ries. 
Madam Speaker, for the record, let’s 
talk a little bit about Arizona. Arizona 
and State and local officials did an un-
believable job to ensure that the 2020 
elections ran smoothly. Mr. Hickman, 
the Republican chairman of the Mari-
copa County board, the largest county 
in the State of Arizona, said: ‘‘No mat-
ter how you voted, this election was 
administered with integrity, trans-
parency, and in accordance with State 
laws.’’ 
Arizonans showed up to the polls in 
record numbers. More than 3.4 million 
people voted, with increases in every 
county, and 65 percent of all eligible 
voters in Arizona voted in the 2020 elec-
tion. Arizonans cast their ballots up 
and down for Republicans and Demo-
crats, and 11 electoral votes were 
granted to Joe Biden and KAMALA HAR-
RIS based on their victory in Arizona. 
That is the story. 
Arizonans voted in hundreds of races 
this year. In addition to the Presi-
dency, these races include nine mem-
bers of the State’s congressional dele-
gation that are with you—four of them, 
my Republican colleagues. These Mem-
bers have already been seated in the 
117th Congress. They do not question 
the accuracy of Arizona’s 2020 elections 
to select the congressional delegation, 
yet my four Republican colleagues 
question the Presidential election. 
Our colleagues may say they are only 
asking questions and seeking to reas-
sure voters, but let us be clear: These 
questions have been answered by the 
voters and by the courts. Rather than 
accepting the answers and the results 
of the election, they are fanning the 
flames of unfounded suspicion and once 
again creating a threat, a very real and 
dangerous threat to our democracy. 
Again, our friends do not question 
the outcomes of their own elections. 
That is because they have no reason to, 
just as they have no legitimate reason 
to question the results of the Presi-
dential election in Arizona. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to reject this objection, to respect the 
will of the voters in the State of Ari-
zona and throughout this country, and 
to fundamentally add some preserva-
tion to our democracy from any future 
damage, that this effort that we are 
undertaking in this House and in the 
Senate today does not further damage 
our democracy. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of my objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I filed 
my challenge on the slate of electors 
from the State of Arizona that was ac-
tually put forward by Governor Ducey 
of Arizona. 
My ask to you, the Speaker, through 
the Vice President, is simple. Do not 
count these electors until and unless 
the secretary of state allows a forensic 
audit of the election, a request she has 
denied repeatedly. 
We have been told over and over that 
even though this was a public election 
using public money and public ma-
chines utilizing public employees, the 
public today has no ability to simply 
double-check the veracity of these re-
sults.

correction of a controversial decision. 
But not so, we are told by our sec-
retary of state, for the Presidential 
election, no review for you. 
No access to the Dominion voting 
machines with a documented history of 
enabling fraud through its now discred-
ited adjudication system, a system 
that literally allows one person to 
change tens of thousands of votes in 
mere minutes. 
In the only audit done in Arizona, a 
court 
found 
3 
percent 
error 
rate 
against President Trump. Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s margin of error was one- 
tenth of that, at 0.03 percent. By the 
way, a 3 percent error rate at minimum 
is 90,000 ballots. After finding the 3 per-
cent error rate, the court stopped the 
audit and refused to go further. 
In Arizona, as my attachments make 
clear, mail-in ballots were altered on 
the first day of counting as shown in 
data graphs we have provided, as con-
cluded by data analysts. Over 400,000 
mail-in ballots were altered, switched 
from President Trump to Vice Presi-
dent Biden, or completely erased from 
President Trump’s totals. 
The proof is in the counting curves, 
the curves that cannot occur except 
with odds so rare and unlikely that 
winning the Mega Millions lottery is 
more probable. 
Mr. Speaker, can I have order in the 
Chamber? 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MCGOVERN). Pursuant to clause 12(b) of 
rule I, the Chair declares the House in 
recess subject to the call of the Chair. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 18 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b 1426 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mr. MCGOVERN) at 2 o’clock 
and 26 minutes p.m. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) has 
23⁄4 minutes remaining. 
The gentleman may proceed. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, as I was 
saying, the probability of these ectopic 
curves, you have a better likelihood of 
winning the Mega Millions lottery than 
you do having statistical issues here. 
Over 30,000 illegal aliens voted in Ari-
zona using the Federal ballot, yet our 
secretary of state refused the public ac-
cess to review the ballots. 
Over a thousand residences were vis-
ited for proof of residency and address; 
456 failed that test. They were vacant 
lots. Even the Recorder’s office was 
used as an address. 
What are they hiding? If the process 
was fair, these would be improbable. 
These would be once-in-a-lifetime-type 
applications. 
So let’s look at the ballots, the sig-
natures, and the adjudicated records. 
Until this is done, Mr. Speaker, we 
should not count this slate. 
You have a letter from the Arizona 
Legislature stating its intent to review 
the issue on January 11. Our Governor 
has refused to allow the State to prop-
erly convene to do its proper oversight. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask you one question 
today: Are you a ceremonial figurehead 
in your current role, or did the drafters 
of the 12th Amendment and Congress, 
in the Electoral Count Act of 1887, en-
vision a role where you made discre-
tionary decisions about ballot fraud 
and fair elections? 
If you are merely ceremonial, then 
let’s be done with this. Let’s eat our 
tea and crumpets and witness our na-
tional decline. 
But if you are not merely ceremonial 
but vested with discernment, ration-
ality, and legal authority to not just 
count from 1 to 270, then do not accept 
Arizona’s electors as certified. Remand 
the slate back to the secretary of state, 
back to the Governor, with the fol-
lowing instructions: Until a full, com-
plete electoral forensic audit is allowed 
by the secretary of state, the electors 
currently certified will not be counted. 
It will then fall on the State of Ari-
zona to decide are its electors in the 
game or not. Anything less is an abdi-
cation of our constitutional Republic 
and our ethos: one man, one vote. 
We ask: Why? What is there to hide? 
Shouldn’t the lawful victor of an elec-
tion be proud, open, and transparent 
about an election audit? I would. In-
stead, we are met with denials, cover- 
ups, and contempt of subpoenas. 
There is too much evidence of fraud, 
demonstrated by statistical anomalies 
that experts have determined cannot 
happen in the absence of fraud, to ac-
cept such a slate. I am not asking these 
electors never be counted; it is just 
that they need to be certified the prop-
er way. 
Our beloved Constitution is but a 
mere piece of paper if we do not follow 
the law, upholding the law. But now, 
alas, we find ourselves lawless, destroy-
ing the very thread that binds us to-
gether. But we need to get back to the 
rule of law. That is what has been vio-
lated, truly, by the actions in these 
States. 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(b) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess subject to 
the call of the Chair. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 29 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
b 2102 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker at 9 
o’clock and 2 minutes p.m. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will ad-
dress the Chamber. 
Today, a shameful assault was made 
on our democracy. It cannot, however, 
deter us from our responsibility to 
validate the election of Joe Biden and 
KAMALA HARRIS. For that reason, Con-
gress has returned to the Capitol. 
We always knew that this responsi-
bility would take us into the night, and 
we will stay as long as it takes. Our 
purpose will be accomplished. We must, 
and we will, show to the country, and 
indeed to the world, that we will not be 
diverted from our duty, that we will re-
spect our responsibility to the Con-
stitution and to the American people. 
On Sunday, it was my great honor to 
be sworn in as Speaker and to preside 
over a sacred ritual of renewal as we 
gathered under the stone of the temple 
of democracy to open the 117th Con-
gress. I said, as we were sworn in then, 
we accept a responsibility as daunting 
and demanding as any previous genera-
tion of leadership has ever faced. 
We know that we are in difficult 
times, but little could we have imag-
ined the assault that was made on our 
democracy today. 
To those who stoked deterrence from 
our responsibility, you have failed. To 
those who engaged in the gleeful dese-
cration of this, our temple of democ-
racy, American democracy, justice will 
be done. 
Today, January 6, is the Feast of the 
Epiphany. On this day of revelation, let 
us pray that this instigation to vio-
lence will provide an epiphany for our 
country to heal. 
In that spirit of healing, I invoke the 
song of Saint Francis. I usually do. 
Saint Francis is the patron saint of my 
city of San Francisco, and the ‘‘Song of 
Saint Francis’’ is our anthem. 
Lord, make me a channel of thy 
peace. 
Where there is darkness, may I bring 
light. 
Where there is hatred, let us bring 
love. 
Where there is despair, let us bring 
hope. 
We know that we would be part of 
history in a positive way today, every 
4 years when we demonstrate again the 
peaceful transfer of power from one 
President to the next, and despite the 
shameful actions of today, we still will 
do so. We will be part of a history that 
shows the world what America is made 
of, that this assault, this assault is just 
that. It shows the weakness of those 
who have had to show through violence 
what their message was. 
My colleagues, it is time to move on. 
I wear this pin quite frequently. Actu-
ally, I gave it to our beloved JOHN 
LEWIS just the weekend or so before he 
left us. It is the flag of our country, a 
flag of the United States of America. 
On it, it says, ‘‘One country, one des-
tiny.’’ 
‘‘One country, one destiny’’ is writ-
ten on the flag. That was also what was 
embroidered 
in 
Abraham 
Lincoln’s 
coat that he had on that fateful night— 
Lincoln’s party, Lincoln’s message: 
One country, one destiny. 
So on this holy day of Epiphany, let 
us pray. I am a big believer in prayer. 
Let us pray that there will be peace on 
Earth and that it will begin with us. 
Let us pray that God will continue to 
bless America.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H86 
January 6, 2021 
With that, let us proceed with our re-
sponsibilities to the Constitution to 
which we have just, within 72 hours, 
taken the oath to uphold. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Maryland is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, it is a 
sad day in America. It is a wrenching 
day in America. It is a day in which 
our words and our actions have had 
consequences of a very, very negative 
nature. We ought to watch our words 
and think what it may mean to some. 
My remarks were written before the 
tragic, dangerous, and unacceptable ac-
tions—and ‘‘unacceptable’’ is such a 
tame word. My remarks started with, 
‘‘Madam Speaker, the American people 
today are witnessing one of the great-
est challenges to our democracy in its 
244-year history.’’ 
Little did I know that this Capitol 
would be attacked by the enemy with-
in. I was here on 9/11 when we were at-
tacked by the enemy without. 
We need to all work together to tame 
and reduce the anger and, yes, the hate 
that some stoke. What some—not all, 
Madam Speaker, but some—in this 
House and this Senate are doing today 
will not change the outcome of the 
election, which is the clear and insur-
mountable victory of President-elect 
Biden and Vice-President-elect Harris. 
Instead, all they will accomplish is to 
further the dangerous divisions. 
This was written before this Capitol 
was assaulted, before this democracy 
was put aside by thousands, encour-
aged by the Commander in Chief. 
Instead, all they will accomplish is to 
further the dangerous divisions, as I 
said, among our people and energize 
conspiracy theories stoked by our for-
eign adversaries, which seek to erode 
America’s confidence in our democracy 
and our system of free and fair elec-
tions. 
I was here in 2000. I was strongly in 
favor of Al Gore for President, and my 
candidate got more votes than the 
other candidate. His name was George 
Bush, of course. And one of the saddest 
days was January 20th of 2001 when our 
candidate, who won the election, in my 
view, was not elected. But it was also 
one of the proudest moments of my ca-
reer because the greatest power on 
Earth passed peacefully from Bill Clin-
ton to George W. Bush. 
Not a shot was fired. Nobody as-
saulted this Caucus or this Congress or 
this Chamber. Because we were not dis-
appointed? No. Because we were not 
angry? No. Because we believe in de-
mocracy. We believe in ‘‘We the peo-
ple.’’ 
One of the speakers, I think it was 
the Senator from Texas, expressed: We 
are here for the people. 
If those were the people, we are in a 
lot of trouble. 
Our electoral system, our democratic 
system, however, did not break under 
the strains of the misinformation, the 
claims of fraud, which court after court 
after court have dismissed out of hand, 
not because there was a little evidence, 
but because there was no evidence. 
That is why we are the longest-last-
ing constitutional democracy in the 
world. I hope all of us in this body are 
proud of that and understand why that 
is the case. Because, as Dick Gephardt 
said on this floor many years ago, de-
mocracy is a substitute for war to re-
solve differences. It proved once more 
the ever-beating strong heart that 
gives life to our Republic and our free-
doms. 
That strength, Madam Speaker, is 
derived in part from our institution 
and our laws, but most importantly, it 
is powered by citizens’ and leaders’ 
commitment to our Constitution. Not 
just us. We swear an oath. But it is all 
of America. 
Barack 
Obama 
spoke 
from 
that 
Chamber, and he said: I am going to be 
taking another title next year—citizen. 
And he was proud to take that. And 
every citizen needs to protect, pre-
serve, and uplift our democracy. 
Some today did not do that, many 
today. 
Sixty-eight years ago in Springfield, 
Illinois, 
Governor 
Adlai 
Stevenson 
gracefully conceded his loss to General 
Dwight Eisenhower. He said this: ‘‘It is 
traditionally American,’’ he told his 
deeply disappointed supporters, ‘‘to 
fight hard before an election.’’ 
b 2115 
But then he added, it is equally tradi-
tional to close ranks as soon as the 
people have spoken—not the Congress, 
not the electors, the people have spo-
ken. 
That which unites us as American 
citizens is far greater than that which 
divides us as political parties. 
It was another man from Springfield, 
fourscore and 8 years earlier, who won 
reelection to the Presidency in the na-
tional crisis that tested our country 
and its democratic institutions, who 
pleaded even in his hour of victory for 
the same spirit of reconciliation. That 
was the party of Lincoln. That hasn’t 
happened to this hour. 
Lincoln said: ‘‘. . . now that the elec-
tion is over,’’ he asked, ‘‘may not all, 
having a common interest, reunite in a 
common effort to save our common 
country?’’ 
Such is the duty of an American who 
stands for elections, or participates in 
our politics, to be either humble in tri-
umph or gracious in defeat. 
I have lost some elections—not too 
many—and I have won a lot of elec-
tions. I hope that I have been gracious 
in defeat and humble in victory. I hope 
that I put my State and my country 
first, not myself. 
It is clear to all that the outgoing 
President has not followed the path 
that Stevenson and Lincoln urged. So, 
we, the people—each one of us rep-
resents about 750,000 to 800,000 people, 
some a few less. The people, they have 
spoken in the way that our Constitu-
tion set for them to be heard by us and 
by the country—they voted, and they 
voted pretty decisively. 
We, the people, together, must turn 
away from division and its dangers. 
The senior Member of our body, DON 
YOUNG from Alaska, spoke the other 
day when we were sworn in and said: 
Ladies and gentlemen of this House, we 
are so divisive that it is going to de-
stroy our country. We need to reach 
out and hold one another’s hands. 
We all have a title that we honor 
more than any other—perhaps parent, 
perhaps husband. But we are all Ameri-
cans. Not Americans-R; not Americans- 
D. We are Americans. 
Let us hope tonight that we act like 
Americans. Not as Ds and Rs, but as 
Americans, just as Al Gore, just as Hil-
lary Clinton, just as Adlai Stevenson, 
just as Abraham Lincoln, who had won 
that election, of course. But he had de-
feated people, and he said that is not 
the issue; the issue is to reunite. 
We, the people, must again be the 
strong heart of our American democ-
racy. 
We, the people, on this day in Con-
gress, must be agents of unity and con-
structive action to face the grave 
threats that confront us and tell those 
who would assault our Capitol: That is 
not the American way. 
We, the Members of Congress, who 
swore an oath before God to preserve 
and protect the Constitution of the 
United States and our democracy, 
must do so now. 
I don’t usually read Senator MCCON-
NELL’s speeches, but I am not speaking 
as a Democrat, nor was he speaking as 
a Republican just a few hours ago. 
‘‘We’re debating a step that has never 
been 
taken 
in 
American 
history, 
whether Congress should overrule the 
voters and overturn a Presidential 
election.’’ 
He went on to say that he supports a 
strong State-led voting reform. 
‘‘The Constitution,’’ he said, ‘‘gives 
us here in Congress a limited role. We 
cannot simply declare ourselves a na-
tional board of elections on steroids. 
The voters, the courts, and the States 
have all spoken.’’ 
Five people said the election of 2000 
was over. We didn’t agree with them. 
But Al Gore said: We are a nation of 
laws. Five people—yes, they were mem-
bers of the Supreme Court, but they 
were five people—said the election is 
over. I sat on that podium and saw that 
power transfer to George W. Bush. 
MCCONNELL went on to say: ‘‘If we 
overrule them, it would damage our 
Republic forever.’’ 
He said that, MCCONNELL, the Repub-
lican leader of the Senate, about 2 
hours ago, 3 hours ago, now 4 hours. 
He went on to say: ‘‘If this election 
were overturned by mere allegations 
from the losing side, our democracy 
would enter a death spiral.’’ 
He concluded: ‘‘It would be unfair 
and wrong to disenfranchise American 
voters and overrule the courts and the 
States on this extraordinarily thin 
basis. And I will not pretend such a

How presciently he spoke. People 
who think that the election has been 
stolen with some fraud, why do they 
think it? Because the Commander in 
Chief said so, and they respect him and 
they follow him. And words matter. 
‘‘Pete,’’ as he ended, ‘‘I will not pre-
tend such a vote would be a harmless 
protest gesture while relying on others 
to do the right thing. I will vote to re-
spect the people’s decision and defend 
our system of government as we know 
it.’’ 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this objection, as MCCONNELL said, a 
danger to our democracy. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise for a point of personal privilege to 
address the House for 5 minutes. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to address what happened in this 
Chamber today and where do we go 
from here. 
The violence, destruction, and chaos 
we saw earlier was unacceptable, un-
democratic, and un-American. It was 
the saddest day I have ever had serving 
as a Member of this institution. 
The Capitol was in chaos. Police offi-
cers were attacked. Guns were drawn 
on this very floor. A woman tragically 
lost her life. 
No one wins when this building and 
what it stands for are destroyed. Amer-
ica, and this institution, is better than 
that. 
We saw the worst of America this 
afternoon. Yet, in the midst of violence 
and fear, we also saw the best of Amer-
ica. 
It starts with our law enforcement— 
the Capitol Police, the National Guard, 
the FBI, and the Secret Service—who 
faced the most difficult challenges but 
did their duty with confidence and 
strength. Many of them are injured 
right now. 
It also extends to this Chamber, 
where both Democrats and Republicans 
showed courage, calm, and resolve. 
I would like to recognize the Mem-
bers now who helped to hold the line: 
MARKWAYNE MULLIN, TONY GONZALES, 
JASON CROW, PAT FALLON, and TROY 
NEHLS. Working with the Capitol Po-
lice, they ensured the floor of this 
Chamber was never breached. These are 
the heroes among us. Thank you for 
the show of courage. 
Looking back on the past few hours, 
it is clear this Congress will not be the 
same after today, and I hope it will be 
the better. I hope not just this institu-
tion, but I hope every American pauses 
for that moment and thinks among 
themselves that we can disagree with 
one another but not dislike each other; 
we can respect the voices of others. 
There are many times we debate in 
this body, and we should. There are 
many times we can get heated. I still 
consider STENY
HOYER
a very good 
friend. There are times I get upset, and 
I will call him at home to express the 
things I may not see fair or just, but 
that is the way we should handle 
things. 
The majority leader is right: We are 
all Americans first. 
But we should also think for a mo-
ment: What do we put on social media? 
What do we convey to one another? 
Just because you have a personal opin-
ion different than mine, you have a 
right to say it, but nobody has a right 
to become a mob. And we all should 
stand united in condemning the mob 
together. 
We solve problems before our Nation, 
not through destruction, but through 
debate. That is the heart of this democ-
racy. I know what we debate today is 
tough, but it is just; it is right. 
This isn’t the first side of the aisle 
that has ever debated this issue. I 
thought of what Madam Speaker said 
back in 2005, ‘‘this is democracy at its 
best,’’ when they talked about a Presi-
dential election in Ohio. 
These are the moments that we 
should raise the issue about integrity 
and accountability and accuracy in our 
elections. But you know what we 
should do, the next difference? Not just 
raise the issue, but work together to 
solve the problems. 
Now is the moment to show America 
we can work best together. I will tell 
you, the size of the majority is slim, so 
it gives us the opportunity to make 
that happen. The only thing that can 
hold us back is the will of one another 
to do it. 
This side of the aisle always believes 
in working with anybody who wants to 
move it forward. That does not mean 
that we are going to agree 100 percent 
of the time. That does not mean our 
voice cannot be heard. That does not 
mean we cannot be treated fairly; we 
should be. That may mean on the size 
of committees, that means on our abil-
ity to offer an amendment, that means 
on our ability to have our voice. But at 
the end of the day, it helps us come to 
a better conclusion. 
By returning here to complete the 
work we were sent to do, we are prov-
ing that our democracy cannot be dis-
rupted by criminal behavior. We will 
not falter; we will not bend; and we 
will not shrink from our duty. 
Let me be very clear: Mobs don’t rule 
America. Laws rule America. It was 
true when our cities were burning this 
summer, and it is true now. 
When Americans go to bed tonight, 
their lasting memory should not be a 
Congress overrun by rioters. It must be 
a resolute Congress conducting healthy 
debate. 
We may disagree on a lot in America, 
but tonight we should show the world 
that we will respectfully, but thor-
oughly, carry out the most basic duties 
of democracy. 
We will continue with the task that 
we have been sent here to do. We will 
follow the Constitution and the law 
and the process for hearing valid con-
cerns about election integrity. We will 
do it with respect. 
b 2130 
We will respect your opinion, we will 
respect what you say, and we are will-
ing to listen to it. I think the Nation 
will be better for it on both sides of the 
aisle. Let’s show the country the mob 
did not win. We have a job to do. Let’s 
do it with pride and let’s be better 
when the sun rises tomorrow. 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, over 
the last few hours, we have seen the 
consequences of dangerous un-Amer-
ican rhetoric; an armed insurrection 
against the seat of government of the 
most powerful country on Earth; a 
breach of this Capitol building to at-
tack Congress, something that has not 
taken place since the British occupied 
this building during the War of 1812; an 
attempted coup spurred by rhetoric 
coming from those who are looking out 
for themselves, not country. 
It is stunning, Madam Speaker, that 
there are some in this House who have 
voiced support for what happened. It 
was not a protest. It was treason. It 
was sedition. And it should be pros-
ecuted as such. 
At its root is a disease that has in-
fected our politics, one that will make 
some political leaders do anything, in-
cluding lie and incite violence to hold 
on to power. That is what we are seeing 
before our very eyes. 
In contesting the outcome of this 
election, my Republican colleagues 
make a contradictory argument that 
puts party and power before country. 
They argue the election results were 
valid when it showed they won their 
races, but the same ballots were some-
how fraudulent when it produced a re-
sult President Trump did not like. 
Keep the results we like, they de-
mand, cancel the one we don’t. 
That is not how democracy works, 
and neither is armed insurrection. 
Here is the truth: Arizona has a long 
bipartisan record of conducting safe, 
secure, and fair elections. And I say 
that as someone whose party has more 
often than not been on the losing end 
of those elections. This last election 
was, once again, safe and secure. And I 
commend our State and county elec-
tion officials, public servants on both 
sides of the aisle, for making Arizona 
proud once again. 
We are here because the case that Re-
publicans have brought before us has 
failed in court over and over and over 
again. 
My colleagues say: Let’s go back to 
the State, let them decide. 
My friends, Arizona has spoken. They 
have sent the correct electors. 
Arizona’s Republican attorney gen-
eral, one of the most partisan in the 
country, said: ‘‘There is no evidence, 
there are no facts that would lead any-
one to believe the election results will 
change.’’ 
The Republican speaker of our State 
house has told us he doesn’t like the

results of the election, but they are the 
right results. Joe Biden has won Ari-
zona. 
The State supreme court, made up 
entirely of justices appointed by Re-
publican Governors, has spoken, too. 
The court said the President’s chal-
lenge ‘‘fails to present any evidence of 
misconduct, illegal votes, or that the 
Biden electors did not in fact receive 
the highest numbers of votes for of-
fice.’’ 
Look to the words of one of the 
President’s own campaign chairs in my 
State, our Governor, Doug Ducey. Our 
Governor loves the President. He has 
been so loyal. He made sure the Presi-
dent could hold large rallies in our 
State in the middle of a pandemic. The 
Governor personally attended them. 
They spoke so often that the Governor 
gave the President a special ‘‘Hail to 
the Chief’’ ring tone on his phone. 
After election day, as the legal chal-
lenges played out, the Governor kept 
quiet; but when the truth became 
clear, even he acknowledged ‘‘Joe 
Biden did win Arizona.’’ 
I am grateful that, in this instance, 
the Governor put law, not partisan pol-
itics, first. And I urge my colleagues in 
the House to follow his lead. 
Each and every one of us in this 
House, the people’s House, swore an 
oath to preserve, protect, and defend 
our Constitution against all enemies, 
foreign and domestic. Over the last few 
hours, we have gained a better under-
standing of what that means. 
The future of the Constitution, the 
most precious of the founding docu-
ments 
of 
the 
greatest 
democracy 
human kind has ever known, is in our 
hands. Defending democracy is not, and 
should not be, a partisan task. It is a 
sacred one. Right here, right now, we 
must recognize that fidelity to the 
founding principles of our Nation are 
not about loyalty to one man, but rath-
er to ensure that government of the 
people, by the people, and for the peo-
ple shall not perish from the Earth. 
The world is watching us all right 
now. We must get it right. Reject this 
ill-conceived attack on our democracy. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise with a heavy heart. This has been 
a truly tragic day for America. We all 
join together in fully condemning the 
dangerous violence and destruction 
that occurred today in our Nation’s 
Capitol. 
Americans will always have their 
freedom of speech and the constitu-
tional right to protest, but violence in 
any form is absolutely unacceptable. It 
is anti-America, and must be pros-
ecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
Thank you to the heroic United 
States Capitol Police. And thank you 
to the bipartisan professional staff of 
the United States Capitol for pro-
tecting the people’s House and the 
American people. 
This hallowed temple of democracy is 
where generations of Americans have 
peacefully come together to face our 
Nation’s greatest challenges, bridge 
our deepest fissures, and create a more 
perfect system of government. This is 
the appropriate place we stand to re-
spectfully and peacefully give voice to 
the people we represent across our di-
verse country. 
The Representatives of the American 
people in this House are standing up 
for three fundamental American be-
liefs: The right to vote is sacred, that 
a Representative has a duty to rep-
resent his or her constituents, and that 
the rule of law is a hallmark of our Na-
tion. 
And in the spirit of healing—those 
are not my words—those are the words 
of you, Madam Speaker, from this very 
Chamber, when some of my colleagues 
and friends across the aisle objected to 
the 2005 electoral college certification. 
In fact, there were objections on this 
floor to the certification of nearly 
every Republican President in my life-
time: In 1989, in 2001, in 2005, and in 
2017. 
So history is our guide that the peo-
ple’s sacred House is the appropriate 
venue for a peaceful debate. And this 
peaceful debate serves as a powerful 
condemnation to the violence that per-
petrated our Capitol grounds today. 
The violence that was truly un-Amer-
ican. 
Today’s discussion is about the Con-
stitution and it is about the American 
people, but it must also be about clear-
ly and resolutely condemning the vio-
lence that occurred today. 
I am honored each and every day to 
represent New York’s 21st Congres-
sional District, and I believe it is my 
solemn and sacred duty to serve as 
their voice and their vote in the peo-
ple’s House. 
Tens of millions of Americans are 
concerned that the 2020 election fea-
tured unconstitutional overreach by 
unelected State officials and judges ig-
noring State election laws. We can and 
we should peacefully and respectfully 
discuss these concerns. 
In Pennsylvania, the State supreme 
court and secretary of state unilater-
ally and unconstitutionally rewrote 
election 
law 
eliminating 
signature 
matching requirements. 
In Georgia, there was constitutional 
overreach when the secretary of state 
unilaterally 
and 
unconstitutionally 
gutted signature matching for absentee 
ballots and, in essence, eliminated 
voter verification required by State 
election law. 
In Wisconsin, officials issued illegal 
rules to circumvent a State law, passed 
by the legislature as the Constitution 
requires, but required absentee voters 
to provide further identification before 
obtaining a ballot. 
In Michigan, signed affidavits docu-
ment numerous unconstitutional irreg-
ularities: Officials physically blocking 
the legal right of poll watchers to ob-
serve vote counts, the illegal counting 
of late ballots, and hand-stamping bal-
lots with the previous day’s date. 
My North Country constituents and 
the American people cherish the Con-
stitution. They know, according to the 
Constitution, elected officials closest 
to the people in State legislatures have 
the power of the pen to write election 
law, not unelected bureaucrats, judges, 
Governors, or secretaries of state. 
To the tens of thousands of constitu-
ents who have reached out to me, 
thank you. Please know that I am lis-
tening and I hear you, both those who 
agree and those who disagree. Our Con-
stitutional Republic will endure this 
tragic day because the Founding Fa-
thers understood Congress and the 
American people would face unprece-
dented and historic challenges by de-
bating them on this very floor. 
I believe that the most precious foun-
dation and the covenant of our Repub-
lic is the right to vote, and the faith in 
the sanctity of our Nation’s free and 
fair elections. We must work together 
in this House to rebuild that faith so 
that all our elections are free, fair, se-
cure, safe and, most importantly, that 
they are according to the United 
States Constitution. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, today, the 
people’s House was attacked, which is 
an attack on the Republic itself. There 
is no excuse for it. A women died. And 
people need to go to jail. And the Presi-
dent should never have spun up certain 
Americans to believe something that 
simply cannot be. 
I applaud House leadership of both 
parties for bringing us back to do our 
job, which is to count the electors and 
no more. 
The problem we face, though, is even 
bigger. We are deeply divided. We are 
divided about even life, liberty, and the 
pursuit of happiness. The words which 
used to bind us together now, at times, 
tear us apart because we disagree 
about what they even mean. 
My constituents at home in Texas 
are genuinely upset. I say to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle, 
we have a constant barrage of those 
who wish to remake America into a so-
cialist welfare State, efforts to attack 
our institutions, tear down statues, 
erase our history, defund our police. 
We have seen the debasing of our lan-
guage. We teach our children that 
America is evil. We destroy our sov-
ereignty, empower cartels. We attack 
our Second Amendment. We destroy 
small businesses through lockdowns. 
We divide ourselves by race. We can’t 
even agree that there is man and 
woman. We extinguish the unborn be-
fore they even have a chance to see 
daylight. 
But at the heart of our path forward 
lies the essence of our Republic, its 
cornerstone. That we are a union of 
States bound together for common de-
fense and economic strength, and more

so bound together through federalism 
in which we may live together peace-
fully as citizens in this vast land agree-
ing to disagree, free to live according 
to our own beliefs and according to the 
dictates of our conscience. 
Now, many of my colleagues were 
poised this afternoon to vote to insert 
Congress into the constitutionally pre-
scribed decisionmaking of the States 
by rejecting the sole official electors 
sent to us by each of the States of the 
Union. I hope they will reconsider. 
I can tell you that I was not going to, 
and I will not be voting to reject the 
electors. And that vote may well sign 
my political death warrant, but so be 
it. I swore an oath to uphold the Con-
stitution of the United States, and I 
will not bend its words into contor-
tions for personal political expediency. 
Number one, rejecting the electors 
certified to Congress by sovereign 
States violates the 12th Amendment 
and the entirety of the Constitution it 
amends, notwithstanding claims that 
you must read certain sections first. It 
is clear, it is black and white, we 
count. It is ministerial. And our only 
job is to count the electors before us. 
We have only one slate of electors per 
State sent to us under color of law, and 
no more. 
Number two, to the extent you be-
lieve we do have constitutional author-
ity to reject, we are arguing using in-
complete and often misleading data 
points to prove it. I am not afforded 
time to go point by point, but there are 
more misleading claims than legiti-
mate ones. 
b 2145 
Three, rejecting the electors ignores 
the Founder’s specific admonition that 
Congress not choose the President, as 
articulated in Federalist No. 68. 
Four, indeed, the Founders drafted 
the inclusion of a phrase specifically 
putting Congress into the manner of 
the election process then specifically 
rejected it. 
Five, if more than a trivial bloc of 
this body votes to reject a sovereign 
State’s electors, it will irrevocably em-
power Congress to take over the selec-
tion of Presidential electors, and doing 
so will almost certainly guarantee fu-
ture Houses will vote to reject the elec-
tors of Texas or any of our States for 
whatever reason. 
Six, voting to reject the electors is 
not remotely consistent with our vote 
on Sunday, a vote I forced to highlight 
the very hypocrisy: to accept the out-
come of the election of ourselves 
through elections conducted under the 
same rules, by procedures put in place 
by the same executive branch officials, 
impacted by rulings from the same 
judges, State and Federal. To do so is 
entirely inexplicable on its face. 
Seven, the argument for rejection 
most given by my colleagues is based 
on the allegations of systemic election 
abuse by executive or judicial branch 
officials interfering with the ‘‘legisla-
tures thereof’’ in Article II. 
Many States made poor policy deci-
sions. Whether these poor policy deci-
sions violate State laws is a contested 
matter and a matter for the States to 
resolve for themselves. 
More, five of the six legislatures are 
controlled by Republicans. Not one 
body has sent separate electors. Not 
one body has sent us even a letter by a 
majority of its whole body. The only 
body, the Pennsylvania Senate, who 
managed to come up with a majority of 
Republicans to complain only did so 
yesterday in an eleventh-hour face-sav-
ing political statement. Not one GOP 
statewide official has formally called 
on us to change. Not one law enforce-
ment organization, State or Federal, 
has presented a case of malfeasance. 
History will judge this moment. 
Let us not turn the last firewall for 
liberty we have remaining on its head 
in a fit of populist rage for political ex-
pediency when there is plenty of look-
ing into the mirror for Republicans to 
do for destroying our election systems 
with expansion of mail-in ballots. 
I may well get attacked for this, but 
I will not abandon my oath to the Con-
stitution. And I will make clear that I 
am standing up in defense of that Con-
stitution to protect our federalist order 
and the electoral college, which em-
powers the very States we represent to 
stand athwart the long arm of this 
Federal Government by its very design. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the objec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam 
Speaker, for years, Democrats and 
their media allies deceived America 
about Trump-Russian collusion and the 
extent of foreign interference in the 
2016 elections. Yet, in 2020, Democrats 
promoted massive foreign interference 
in American elections by helping ille-
gal aliens and other noncitizens vote in 
American elections, thereby canceling 
the votes of and stealing elections from 
American citizens. 
Want evidence? Exhibit A. In 1993, 
Democrats rammed through Congress 
the National Voter Registration Act, 
making it illegal—illegal—to require 
proof of citizenship that prevents ille-
gal aliens and noncitizens from reg-
istering to vote. 
Why did Democrats do that? Simple. 
To steal elections, of course. 
Exhibit B. How bad is the noncitizen 
voting problem? In 2005, Democrat 
President Jimmy Carter’s Commission 
on Federal Election Reform warned 
that ‘‘noncitizens have registered to 
vote in several recent elections’’ and 
recommended that ‘‘all States should 
use their best efforts to obtain proof of 
citizenship before registering voters.’’ 
Exhibit C. A June 2005 General Ac-
countability Office report discovered 
that up to 3 percent of people on voter 
registration lists are not U.S. citizens. 
Exhibit D. In 2008, Electoral Studies 
surveyed 339 noncitizens. Eight percent 
admitted voting in American elections. 
As an aside, I have seen higher per-
centages in other studies. 
Exhibit E. The 2010 Census counted 11 
million illegal aliens in America. 
Exhibit F. A 2018 Yale study esti-
mated as many as 22 million illegal 
aliens in America. 
Exhibit G. The math means between 
880,000 and 1.72 million illegal aliens il-
legally voted in the 2020 elections. 
Exhibit H. In 2014, Old Dominion Uni-
versity and George Mason University 
professors surveyed noncitizens and il-
legal aliens and found they vote Demo-
crat roughly 80 percent of the time. 
Exhibit 
I. 
The 
math 
is 
again 
straightforward. The 60 percent Biden 
advantage times the illegal alien vot-
ing number means Joe Biden gained 
roughly 1,032,000 votes from illegal 
alien voting. That is the high number. 
Exhibit J. While no one knows for 
sure how massive the illegal alien vot-
ing bloc is, we do know Joe Biden and 
his campaign believed it large enough 
and critical enough to winning the 
Presidential race that, at the October 
22 Presidential debate, Joe Biden pub-
licly solicited the illegal alien bloc 
vote by promising: ‘‘Within 100 days, I 
am going to send to the United States 
Congress a pathway to citizenship for 
over 11 million undocumented people.’’ 
Ladies 
and 
gentlemen, 
Madam 
Speaker, that is the pot of gold at the 
end of the rainbow for illegal aliens. 
Joe Biden knew exactly what he was 
doing by seeking the illegal alien bloc 
vote. After all, on May 11, 1993, then- 
Senator Joe Biden voted for the Na-
tional Voter Registration Act, which 
makes it illegal to require proof of citi-
zenship from illegal aliens and other 
noncitizens when they seek to register 
to vote. 
Madam Speaker, the evidence is com-
pelling and irrefutable. Noncitizens 
overwhelmingly voted for Joe Biden in 
exchange for the promised amnesty and 
citizenship and in so doing helped steal 
the election from Donald Trump, Re-
publican 
candidates, 
and 
American 
citizens across America. 
Madam Speaker, in my judgment, if 
only lawful votes cast by eligible 
American citizens are counted, Joe 
Biden lost and President Trump won 
the electoral college. 
As such, it is my constitutional duty 
to promote honest and accurate elec-
tions by rejecting electoral college 
vote submissions from States whose 
electoral systems are so badly flawed 
as to render their vote submissions un-
reliable, untrustworthy, and unworthy 
of acceptance.

the United States of America. And 
what I saw today was mob rule that 
spat upon the blood of my father that 
is in the soil of Europe and in the soil 
of Korea, and who gave us through that 
blood this sacred Constitution and the 
sacred ability to lead this world as a 
power that says we settle our dif-
ferences not with mob rule; we settle 
our difference through elections. And 
when those elections are over, we have 
a peaceful transition of power. 
Now, make no mistake to my col-
leagues on the Democratic side of the 
aisle, I will be passionate in my dis-
agreement with you. I will be pas-
sionate in my ideas for the future of 
this country, and I will fight for my 
Republican ideas that I hold near and 
dear. But I will stand with you tonight 
and send a message to the Nation and 
all Americans that what we saw today 
was not American, and what we see to-
night in this body shall be what we do 
in America, and that is to transfer 
power in a peaceful way. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. REED. I yield to the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank my friend for yielding and for 
standing with me and with all of us. 
TOM REED is my co-chair of the Prob-
lem Solvers Caucus. He is a Repub-
lican, and I am a Democrat. When it 
comes to policy views, we often dis-
agree. But at the end of the day, we are 
united as Americans. My good friend, 
like me, always puts country first. 
Today, a group of lawless thugs 
sought to upend the Constitution and 
the peaceful transition of power be-
cause they didn’t like the outcome of 
the Presidential election. So, they 
tried to nullify it using improvised ex-
plosives, shattering windows, breaking 
down doors, injuring law enforcement, 
and even tearing down the American 
flag that rises above this beacon of de-
mocracy. 
But their attempt to obstruct democ-
racy failed. Their insurrection was 
foiled. The American people and the 
greatest democracy the world has ever 
known won. 
Abraham Lincoln, who served in this 
very body, famously said: ‘‘A house di-
vided against itself cannot stand.’’ 
That is why, for the sake of this coun-
try, we must stand together, united, 
and celebrate a peaceful transition of 
power. 
In 14 days, President-elect Biden will 
be sworn in. And despite all of our dif-
ferences, I have faith that, for the 
American people, we will come to-
gether, Democrats and Republicans, 
committed 
to 
unity, 
civility, 
and 
truth. We will recognize our higher 
purpose to help America through these 
dark days. 
That is the only way we will beat 
COVID, rebuild our economy, and stand 
up to threats at home and abroad. 
Working together as Democrats and 
Republicans, I know our best days will 
always be ahead of us. 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I encour-
age my colleagues to always search 
their conscience and their souls. I re-
spect my Republican colleagues and 
my Democratic colleagues, but today, 
let us pause and remember what hap-
pened here today. Let us pause that our 
tenure in this Congress will far surpass 
the time that we stay here. And let us 
pause and cast our votes today recog-
nizing that what we do here today will 
set the course of this institution for 
years to come. 
This institution, Madam Speaker, 
shall not fail because the United States 
of America shall forever be the beacon 
of hope, the inspiration to all. 
May God bless our great country. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
New York is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, my 
constitutional oath is sacred, and I 
have a duty to speak out about con-
firmed evidence-filled issues with the 
administration of the 2020 Presidential 
election 
in 
certain 
battleground 
States. 
Signature verification, ballot obser-
vation, voter roll integrity, voter ID 
requirements, and ballot collection 
protections were weakened on top of 
the millions of mailboxes that were 
flooded with unrequested mail-in bal-
lots. 
Many of my constituents have been 
outraged and demanding that I voice 
their objections here today. 
This debate is necessary because 
rogue election officials, secretaries of 
state, and courts circumvented State 
election laws. They made massive 
changes to how their State’s election 
would be run. These acts, among other 
issues, were unlawful and unconstitu-
tional. 
Congress has the duty to defend the 
Constitution and any powers of State 
legislatures that were usurped. 
Some claim today’s objections set 
new precedent by challenging State 
electors. That claim, of course, ignores 
that Democrats have objected every 
time a Republican Presidential can-
didate has won an election over the 
past generation. If you don’t have any 
observations today, that is your call, 
but don’t lecture about precedent. 
Over the past 4 years, Democrats 
boycotted President Trump’s inaugura-
tion and State of the Union Addresses, 
pushed the Trump-Russia collusion 
conspiracies and investigations and 
knowingly lied about it, voted to im-
peach the President before even know-
ing what to impeach him for, and then 
actually passed Articles of Impeach-
ment before Senate Democrats voted to 
remove him from office. 
Today’s debate is necessary, espe-
cially because of the insistence that 
everything President Trump and his 
supporters say about the 2020 election 
is evidence-free. That is simply not 
true. 
No one can honestly claim it is evi-
dence-free. When I say that, in Arizona, 
courts unilaterally extended the legis-
latively set deadline to register to 
vote. 
b 2200 
The Arizona State Senate issued sub-
poenas post-election to get information 
from the Maricopa County board on 
various election matters, but the board 
and the courts refused to help at all to 
let the State senate complete its con-
stitutional duties. 
In Pennsylvania, where State legisla-
tors wrote us about their powers being 
usurped, the Democrat majority on the 
State supreme court changed signa-
ture, signature matching and postal 
marking requirements. The date to 
submit mail-in ballots was extended 
contradictory to the date set by State 
law. 
The State legislature expanded no- 
excuse mail-in balloting without a con-
stitutional amendment. Constitutions 
apply to the acts of all branches of gov-
ernment. 
The issue was magnified by the voter 
rolls being so inaccurate that more 
voters submitted ballots than there 
were registered voters. Signature au-
thentication rules for absentee and 
mail-in ballots were weakened by the 
Democrat secretary of the Common-
wealth without authorization. Ballot 
defects were allowed to be cured in 
some counties but not others. There 
were poll watchers denied the ability 
to closely observe ballot counting oper-
ations. 
In Georgia, the secretary of state 
unilaterally entered into a settlement 
agreement with the Democratic Party, 
changing statutory requirements for 
confirming voter identity. Challenging 
defective signatures was made far more 
difficult, and the settlement even re-
quired election officials to consider 
issuing training materials drafted by 
an expert retained by the Democratic 
Party. 
In Wisconsin, election officials as-
sisted voters on how to circumvent the 
State’s voter ID laws and signature 
verification laws, while also placing 
unmanned drop boxes in locations 
picked to boost Democrat turnout. The 
Democracy in the Park event in Wis-
consin had over 17,000 ballots trans-
ferred that shouldn’t have been. 
These are all facts and certainly not 
‘‘evidence free.’’ 
Americans deserve nothing less than 
full faith and confidence in their elec-
tions and a guarantee that their vote— 
their voice—counts and that their con-
cerns are being heard. That is why we 
need to have this debate today, wheth-
er you like it or not. 
This isn’t about us. This is about our 
Constitution, our elections. This is 
about our people and our Republic. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I 
am the proud son of immigrants. Grow-
ing up, I heard stories about parties,

politicians, and Presidents invalidating 
elections when the people took power 
for themselves. That is why, when I 
joined the Marine Corps, the most sa-
cred part of my oath was to protect the 
Constitution of the United States. 
I never thought I would have to do 
that on the floor of Congress, but here 
we are. The people have spoken, and 
the power of the people, the Constitu-
tion, will be preserved. 
Madam Speaker, I left my youth, I 
left my sanity, I left it all in Iraq for 
this country because there is this one 
precious idea that we all had, that we 
all believed: that this country was 
going to protect everyone’s individual 
rights, that you were going to be able 
to vote, that you were going to be able 
to preserve democracy and pass it on as 
a legacy, as an inheritance to every 
American. 
But today—today—there was treason 
in this House. Today, there were trai-
tors in this House. 
So I am not asking my Republican 
colleagues to help me and stop this ob-
jection to Arizona; I am asking you to 
get off all these objections. It is time 
for you to save your soul. It is time for 
you to save your country. 
That man at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave-
nue will forget you. He will use you 
and he will dump you to the side, but 
what will be left will be the stain—the 
stain—on democracy that you are en-
gaging in right now. 
Listen to yourselves. I consider most 
of you very smart, believe it or not, 
but the idea that we would rig an elec-
tion for the President but not preserve 
the congressional seats for all of our 
friends that we just lost in the last 
election is absurd. 
The idea that we would help Vice 
President Biden win but wouldn’t make 
sure that we got enough Senators in 
the Senate for us to pass a full agenda 
is absurd. 
The idea that there was somehow ne-
farious border registration in Arizona 
that tipped the scale when, during that 
same time of border registration, there 
were more registered voters that were 
Republicans than Democrats is absurd. 
You are better than this. Many of 
you did serve, many of you have never 
served, but there is an opportunity and 
a time for courage. I hope you never 
have to face fire or bullets or bombs for 
your country, but right now—right 
now—this country is asking you to be 
better. Right now, this country is ask-
ing you to show courage. 
That man will leave. Your soul will 
stay with you for the rest of your life. 
You owe it to democracy. You owe it 
to the hundreds and thousands of men 
and women that have sacrificed their 
life. 
You know better. You are better. Be 
the good American. Be the American 
you want. Preserve this democracy; re-
ject this movement; and stop this ter-
rorism that is happening from the 
White House. 
The SPEAKER. Members are re-
minded to address their remarks to the 
Chair. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in 
favor of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
North Carolina is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, it has been quite a 
day. And in contrast to the gentle-
man’s comments just now, I couldn’t 
get over this text that I received from 
the mayor of Charlotte, Vi Lyles, 
about 30 minutes ago. She is a progres-
sive Democrat, a political opponent for 
years, a tremendous and graceful per-
son. She said: 
Representative Bishop, I hope you are safe 
and well. It must have been a day of anguish 
for the world to see our Capitol buildings 
under siege. I know you have a long night 
ahead and want you to know I was thinking 
about you, your family, and staff. 
God bless. 
Vi. 
Back home, the generosity of spirit 
still exists. 
And I understand the sharp words 
and feelings on the other side tonight, 
but there are also good people back 
home, and I have heard from many, 
many, many of them. 
News would suggest there are mil-
lions of Americans—that is a big num-
ber—millions, tens of millions, who be-
lieve something went awry in this elec-
tion. And they aren’t dumb. They 
aren’t mindless. They don’t believe 
things simply because the President 
says them. There were problems. 
I know that Joe Biden will be Presi-
dent, but I don’t know that it hurts or 
would hurt any of us to have the gen-
erosity of spirit to continue to reflect 
on what might be better or what might 
seriously have gone wrong here, even if 
you reject the notion that the result 
was wrong. 
I would like to offer a slightly dif-
ferent perspective, a distinct perspec-
tive. Perhaps it will be rejected. I 
think if I were sitting on the other side 
of the aisle, it would be very difficult 
for me to listen to tonight, but you all 
have heard it said, and it certainly is 
true, that many executive branch offi-
cials around the Nation departed from 
State legislatures’ enacted laws. 
I know it is less understood how this 
came to pass. 
It was not a spontaneous, inde-
pendent decisionmaking, but it re-
sulted, I would argue, from a coordi-
nated, nationwide partisan plan. And 
the fact and scope of the plan really 
isn’t disputed. 
If you go to democracydocket.com, it 
is the website of Marc Elias, the na-
tional Democratic election lawyer who 
appeared in hundreds of cases across 
the country in the course of the elec-
tion year. 
This plan was not a response to 
COVID, by the way. It preexisted that. 
And his website shows that as well. He 
explained that in January of 2020. 
It was a chaos strategy, a plan to 
flood State and Federal courts with 
hundreds of simultaneous election year 
lawsuits aimed at displacing State leg-
islative control. 
Now, as I have seen it, only the most 
experienced and independent judges ap-
pear to have recognized what was 
afoot. In the fourth circuit, dissenting 
judges Wilkinson and Agee said this: 
‘‘Let’s understand the strategy that is 
being deployed here . . . Our country is 
now plagued with a proliferation of 
preelection litigation.’’ And as they 
put it, 385 election year cases to that 
point on October 20, and they referred 
to the website healthyelections.org to 
verify that. 
‘‘Around the country,’’ they wrote, 
‘‘courts are changing the rules of the 
upcoming elections at the last minute. 
It makes the promise of the Constitu-
tion’s Elections and Electors Clauses 
into a farce.’’ 
This 
was 
a 
political 
operation 
masquerading as a judicial one. And in 
keeping with that, it featured gross 
breaches of litigation ethics: forum 
shopping, repetitive suits after losses, 
and collusive settlements with cooper-
ating Democratic officials of State and 
local governments. 
That is what led to officials changing 
the rules in State after State, mainly 
through consent orders, or the prelimi-
nary, unreviewed decisions of State 
and Federal trial judges inclined by 
partisanship or having limited experi-
ence with the Electoral Clause. 
In turn, the displacement of rules set 
by State legislatures led to chaotic 
conditions on the ground, about which 
so many Americans are angry and dis-
heartened. 
I think we can do better. I think that 
strategy was unwise, and I think, par-
ticularly in light of what has happened 
here today, we should. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise tonight in opposition to the ob-
jection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
as a nation, we have endured trying 
times and overcome many challenges, 
and now we face an unprecedented ef-
fort to ignore the will of the American 
people and the people of Arizona. Given 
the facts and the unprecedented events 
of tonight, this effort must be finished, 
and America can be united again. That 
is going to take leadership. 
We are all leaders. 
We are elected to be leaders. And if 
we are going to do that, we have to do 
it from respect to others, the idea that 
truth is important, that factual con-
tent is important, that we are going to 
tell the American people what is going 
on in this country and not what we 
hope they hear from a 30-second sound 
bite. 
I used to be a homicide investigator. 
My job was to follow the facts, develop 
a 
case, 
make 
decisions 
and 
rec-
ommendations based on where those 
facts led me. Following the process 
means that decisions cannot be made 
on rumors and innuendos alone. 
I am proud to say that Arizona has 
used mail-in voting for over two dec-
ades. Both Republicans and Democrats

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H92 
January 6, 2021 
have long been proud of how our State 
has administered elections. 
In 2020, over 65 percent of eligible Ar-
izonans voted, a record number. Our 
Republican Governor, Republican at-
torney general, Democratic secretary 
of state, and our State’s election ad-
ministrators and volunteers worked 
with integrity to administer a fair 
election. 
We saw turnout increases in both Re-
publican and Democratic areas, and, in 
fact, more Republicans registered in 
this election than any other party. I 
am proud that many of our Tribal, 
rural, and underserved communities 
voted in record numbers, all during a 
pandemic. In 2020, Arizonans made 
their voices heard. 
The fact is, multiple Federal and 
State judges, agencies, and State elect-
ed officials concluded the winner was 
Joe Biden. 
In Arizona, this process was adminis-
tered and overseen by officials from 
both parties. Election officials con-
ducted random, hand-counted audits of 
many precincts that confirmed there 
were no errors that would change the 
result of the election. 
The fact is that the Republican 
chairman of Maricopa County, the 
largest Republican county in the State, 
the biggest population county, stated: 
‘‘More than 2 million ballots were cast 
in Maricopa County, and there is no 
evidence of fraud or misconduct or 
malfunction.’’ 
He concluded: ‘‘No matter how you 
voted, this election was administered 
with integrity, transparency, and in 
accordance with State laws.’’ 
The fact is, the President, his cam-
paign, 
and 
several 
Republican-led 
groups filed eight election lawsuits, all 
of which were dismissed. The Arizona 
Supreme Court, a body where all jus-
tices have been appointed by Repub-
lican 
Governors, 
unanimously 
dis-
missed the case. 
b 2215 
The justices found that the party had 
‘‘failed to present any evidence of ‘mis-
conduct,’ or ‘illegal votes’ . . . let 
alone establish any degree of fraud or a 
significant error rate that would un-
dermine the certainty of the election 
results.’’ 
After these judicial rulings, the Gov-
ernor said: ‘‘I trust our election sys-
tem. There’s integrity in our election 
system.’’ 
The fact is, Joe Biden is the certified 
winner of Arizona’s 11 electoral votes. 
Arizona’s elected and appointed offi-
cials from both parties followed the 
facts and came to this conclusion. I 
urge my colleagues to do the same. 
To my colleagues across the aisle, I 
know we may disagree on who we want 
as President, but what we personally 
want is not what matters here. Rather, 
the people’s influence, as reflected in 
the certified electoral college results, 
is what matters. Facts matter. 
Undermining faith in our election 
process by attempting to mislead the 
American public only serves to weaken 
us and make us vulnerable to foreign 
actors who do us harm. For the good of 
our country, this must stop. Now is the 
time to come together to preserve our 
democracy and to protect our national 
security. 
I know my constituents are looking 
to Congress to move past its divisions, 
find common ground, and pass legisla-
tion to improve the lives of struggling 
families. We must stay focused on 
fighting the pandemic. We must work 
to ensure all Americans can be vac-
cinated as soon as possible so we can 
save American lives, safely reopen 
schools, get people back to work, and 
visit loved ones again. I urge my col-
leagues to follow this. 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, one of 
the first things we did when the House 
convened today was to join together to 
extend our grace and our kindness and 
our concern for a colleague who has ex-
perienced 
just 
an 
insurmountable 
amount of grief with his family. And I 
want all of our fellow Americans 
watching to know that we did that be-
cause we care about each other and we 
don’t want bad things to happen to 
each other, and our heart hurts when 
they do. 
Now, I am sure there are plenty of 
folks over there who don’t like me too 
much and there are few of them that I 
don’t care for too much. But if anybody 
had been hurt today, it would have 
been even more of a catastrophe than 
we already saw, and I think that is an 
important point for the country. 
Another important point for the 
country is that this morning, President 
Trump explicitly called for demonstra-
tions and protests to be peaceful. He 
was far more—you can moan and 
groan, but he was far more explicit 
about his calls for peace than some of 
the BLM and leftwing rioters were this 
summer when we saw violence sweep 
across this Nation. 
Now, we came here today to debate, 
to follow regular order, to offer an ob-
jection, to follow a process that is ex-
pressly contemplated in our Constitu-
tion; and for doing that, we got called 
a bunch of seditious traitors. 
Now, not since 1985 has a Republican 
President been sworn in absent some 
Democrat effort to object to the elec-
tors; but when we do it, it is the new 
violation of all norms. And when those 
things are said, people get angry. 
Now, I know there are many coun-
tries where political violence may be 
necessary, but America is not one such 
country. 
Madam Speaker, it was wrong when 
people vandalized and defaced your 
home. It was wrong when thugs went to 
Senator HAWLEY’s home. And I don’t 
know if the reports are true, but The 
Washington Times has just reported 
some pretty compelling evidence from 
a facial recognition company showing 
that some of the people who breached 
the Capitol today were not Trump sup-
porters. They were masquerading as 
Trump supporters, and, in fact, were 
members of the violent terrorist group 
antifa. 
Now, we should seek to build Amer-
ica up, not tear her down and destroy 
her. And I am sure glad that, at least 
for one day, I didn’t hear my Democrat 
colleagues calling to defund the police. 
Now, I appreciate all the talk of com-
ing together, but let us not pretend 
that our colleagues on the left have 
been free of some antidemocratic im-
pulses. Just because we signed on to 
legal briefs and asked courts to resolve 
disputes, there were some on the left 
who said that we should not even be 
seated in the body, that we ought to be 
prosecuted, maybe even jailed. Those 
arguments anger people. 
But people do understand the con-
cepts of basic fairness, and no competi-
tion, 
contest, 
or 
election 
can 
be 
deemed fair if the participants are sub-
ject to different rules. 
Baseball teams that cheat and steal 
signs should be stripped of their cham-
pionships. 
Russian 
Olympians 
who 
cheat and use steroids should be 
stripped of their medals. And States 
that do not run clean elections should 
be stripped of their electors. 
This fraud was systemic; it was re-
peated; it was the same system; and, I 
dare say, it was effective. We saw cir-
cumstances 
where, 
when 
Democrat 
operatives couldn’t get the outcomes 
they wanted in State legislatures, 
when they couldn’t get the job done 
there, they went and pressured and liti-
gated and usurped the Constitution 
with 
extra-constitutional 
action 
of 
some officials in some States. They 
fraudulently laundered ballots, votes, 
voter registration forms, and then they 
limited review. 
In 2016, Democrats found out that 
they couldn’t beat Donald Trump at 
the ballot box with voters who actually 
show up, so they turned to impeach-
ment and the witness box. And when 
that failed, they ran to the mailbox, 
where this election saw an unprece-
dented amount of votes that could not 
be authenticated with true ID, with 
true signature match, and with true 
confidence for the American people. 
Our Article III courts have failed by 
not holding evidentiary hearings to 
weigh the evidence. We should not join 
in that failure. We should vindicate the 
rights of States. We should vindicate 
the subpoenas in Arizona that have 
been issued to get a hold of these vot-
ing machines, and we should reject 
these electors.

Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, I am

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H93 
January 6, 2021 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Colorado 
for yielding time. 
I will be very brief, Madam Speaker. 
There is really nothing left to say. This 
challenge brought by Members of this 
House, Republican Members from this 
House from Arizona and a Senator 
from 
Texas, 
the 
whole 
discussion 
today, this challenge to the 11 electoral 
votes that are designated for President 
Biden and Vice President Harris, the 
discussion today proves there is no 
merit to denying those electoral votes. 
There is no legal standing. The courts 
have proven that in Arizona time and 
time again. There is no precedent. 
There was no constitutional violation. 
But we are here today, Madam 
Speaker, because of one man and those 
who are desperate to please him. 
So what do we have to show for this 
process today? Fear, a lockdown, vio-
lence, 
and, 
regrettably 
and 
sadly, 
death, arrests, present and real danger, 
threats, an assault on our institution, 
this House, this Congress, and the very 
democracy that we practice here. 
And to what end? What did we ac-
complish? 
The reality is that the challenges 
will be defeated. Come January 20, 
President Biden and Vice President 
Harris will be the President and Vice 
President of the United States. 
So what have we accomplished? To 
further divide this Nation? To continue 
to fan the same rhetoric of division and 
us versus them? To paralyze and dis-
mantle our democracy? Is that what we 
attempted to accomplish today? 
The mob that attacked this institu-
tion, I hold no Member specifically re-
sponsible for that madness that was 
around us, but we do share a responsi-
bility, my friends, to end it. It is past 
time to accept reality, to reaffirm our 
democracy and move on. 
I would urge my colleagues from Ari-
zona who filed this challenge to with-
draw their challenge to this, to Arizona 
and to the electors that have been cho-
sen to give their 11 votes to the win-
ners in that election. 
But if that doesn’t happen, then I 
would urge my colleagues to reject this 
challenge and defend all voters, defend 
the voters of Arizona and that democ-
racy that we practice daily in the rep-
resentation of our constituents. That is 
what is at stake today. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, on 
Sunday, every Member in this Chamber 
took an oath to uphold the Constitu-
tion, and there is only one vote tonight 
for those who took that oath, and that 
vote is to reject this challenge. 
The SPEAKER. All time for debate 
has expired. 
The question is, Shall the objection 
to the Arizona electoral college vote 
count submitted by the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR) and the Sen-
ator from Texas (Mr. CRUZ) be agreed 
to. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
3(s) of House Resolution 8, the yeas and 
nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 121, nays 
303, not voting 7, as follows:

House Democrats, 11 House Senate 
Democrats, 11 Senate Republicans. 44

social distancing. 
Please, my colleagues, if you are not 
participating in the next part of this, 
please return to your offices.

the proceedings from there, in a rel-
ative number. So first come, first 
serve. 
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A message from the Senate by Ms. 
Byrd, one of its clerks, announced that 
the Secretary of the Senate shall in-
form the House of Representatives that 
the Senate is ready to proceed in joint 
session with the further counting of 
the electoral votes for President and 
Vice President. 
At 11:35 p.m., the Sergeant at Arms, 
Paul D. Irving, announced the Vice 
President and the Senate of the United 
States. 
The Senate entered the Hall of the 
House of Representatives, headed by 
the Vice President and the Secretary of 
the Senate, the Members and officers 
of the House rising to receive them. 
The Vice President took his seat as 
the Presiding Officer of the joint con-
vention of the two Houses, the Speaker 
of the House occupying the chair on his 
left. Senators took seats to the right of 
the rostrum as prescribed by law. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The joint 
session of Congress to count the elec-
toral vote will resume. The tellers will 
take their chairs. 
The two Houses retired to consider 
separately and decide upon the vote of 
the State of Arizona, to which an ob-
jection has been filed. 
The Secretary of the Senate will re-
port the action of the Senate. 
The Secretary of the Senate read the 
order of the Senate, as follows: 
Ordered, That the Senate by a vote of 6 
ayes to 93 nays rejects the objection to the 
electoral votes cast in the State of Arizona 
for Joseph R. Biden, Jr., for President and 
KAMALA D. HARRIS for Vice President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Clerk of 
the House will report the action of the 
House. 
The Clerk of the House read the order 
of the House, as follows: 
Ordered, That the House of Representatives 
rejects the objection to the electoral vote of 
the State of Arizona. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to 
the law, chapter 1 of title 3, United 
States Code, because the two Houses 
have not sustained the objection, the 
original certificate submitted by the 
State of Arizona will be counted as pro-
vided therein. 
The tellers will now record and an-
nounce the vote of the State of Arkan-
sas for President and Vice President in 
accordance with the action of the two 
Houses. 
This certificate from Arkansas, the 
Parliamentarians have advised me, is 
the only certificate of vote from that 
State, and purports to be a return from 
the State, and that has annexed to it a 
certificate from an authority of that 
State purporting to appoint or ascer-
tain electors. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
President, the certificate of the elec-
toral vote of the State of Arkansas 
seems to be regular in form and au-
thentic, and it appears therefrom that 
Donald J. Trump of the State of Flor-
ida received 6 votes for President and 
MICHAEL R. PENCE of the State of Indi-
ana received 6 votes for Vice President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there

cate of vote of the State of Arkansas

be regular in form and authentic? 
There was no objection.

purpose does the gentleman from Geor-
gia (Mr. HICE) rise? 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. President, 
myself, members of the Georgia delega-
tion, and some 74 of my Republican col-
leagues and I object to the electoral 
vote from the State of Georgia on the 
grounds that the election conducted on 
November 3 was faulty and fraudulent 
due to unilateral actions by the sec-
retary of state to unlawfully change 
the State’s election process without 
approval from the General Assembly 
and thereby setting the stage for an 
unprecedented amount of fraud and 
irregularities. I have signed the objec-
tion myself. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Sections 15 
and 17 of title 3, United States Code, 
require that any objection be presented 
in writing and signed by a Member of 
the House of Representatives and a 
Senator. 
Is the objection in writing and signed 
by a Member and a Senator? 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. President, 
prior to the actions and events of 
today, we did, but following the events 
of today, it appears that some Senators 
have withdrawn their objection. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, 
the objection cannot be entertained.

The SPEAKER. The Chair will en-
deavor to alternate recognition be-
tween Members speaking in support of 
the objection and Members speaking in 
opposition to the objection. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY) for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, this is 
a somber day for the defense of the 
Constitution. You see, the Constitution 
is just a piece of paper. It cannot de-
fend itself. That is why our leaders 
swear an oath to uphold and defend the 
Constitution, and that is what I am 
doing here this evening. 
The Constitution states: ‘‘The times, 
places, and manner of holding elections 
. . . shall be prescribed . . . by the leg-
islature’’—not the courts, not the Gov-
ernor, not the secretary of state or 
other bureaucrats or elected officials, 
the legislature. 
In Pennsylvania, the supreme court 
unilaterally extended the deadline for 
ballots to 3 days after the election. 
They actually wanted 10. The supreme 
court is not the legislature. The su-
preme court mandated un-postmarked 
ballots to be received, destroying the 
validity of all the votes that were cast 
timely. 
The supreme court action defied the 
law, the legislature, and the will of the 
people. 
The supreme court authorized the 
use of drop boxes, where ballot har-
vesting could occur. The legislature 
never authorized that form of voting, 
and the court had absolutely no right 
to do so. 
Responding to the secretary of state, 
Kathy Boockvar, the supreme court 
ruled that mail-in ballots need not au-
thenticate signatures. 
Once again, the court not only defied 
the Constitution and the will of the 
people, but by so doing, they created a 
separate class of voters, thereby vio-
lating the Equal Protection Clause pre-
scribed in the Constitution. 
How can we have two legally sepa-
rate classes of voters? Yet, the court 
made it so, not the legislature. 
The Constitution doesn’t mention 
the court when determining the time, 
place, and manner of elections because 
they are not authorized to make those 
decisions. Yet, they did it. 
And the U.S. Supreme Court has re-
fused to hear the case, denying the evi-
dence and denying the demands for jus-
tice from the people of Pennsylvania 
and America. 
These aren’t my opinions. These 
aren’t partisan viewpoints. These are 
irrefutable facts. 
Six days before the election, guid-
ance emailed from the secretary of 
state required that the counties shall 
not pre-canvass or canvass any mail-in 
or civilian absentee ballots received be-
tween 8 o’clock Tuesday and 5 o’clock 
Friday and that they must be kept sep-
arately. That was 6 days before the 
election. 
Madam Speaker, 2 days before the 
election, counties received new guid-
ance from the secretary of state, in-
forming counties that they shall can-
vass segregated absentee and mail-in 
ballots as soon as possible upon re-
ceipt. 
The secretary of state is not elected 
by the people. She is not a member of 
the legislature. Yet, she, and she alone, 
determined the time and manner of 
elections. That was unconstitutional. 
In defiance of a U.S. Supreme Court 
order that all ballots received after 
election day be segregated, the sec-
retary of state knew, once they were 
canvassed, that is opened and commin-
gled with all the other ballots, they 
would be counted with all the rest. 
And what is the remedy for this defi-
ance, for this lawbreaking? So far, the 
court has decided there is no remedy. 
There is no penalty for this lawless-
ness, this dilution of lawfully cast 
votes, this defiance of the Constitu-
tion—no remedy. When the State legis-
lature requested the Governor to con-
vene a special session to address the 
unanswered questions and try to pro-
vide a remedy, he refused. 
When votes are accepted under un-
constitutional means without fair and 
equal protection for all, the only result 
can be an illegitimate outcome—ille-
gitimate. 
The voters did not create this mess, 
but the will of the people is absolutely 
being subverted by the deliberate and 
willful actions of individuals defying 
their oath, the law, and the Constitu-
tion. 
In Pennsylvania, we use the State-
wide Uniform Registry of Electors, or 
SURE, system as the basis of deter-
mining who can vote. Unfortunately, a 
recent attempted audit by the Demo-
crat State auditor general concluded 
that he was unable to establish with 
any degree of reasonable assurance 
that the SURE system is secure and 
that Pennsylvania voter registration 
records are complete and accurate. 
That is what we are relying on. That 
right there. This is the very same sys-
tem used to certify the election in the 
contest for President of the United 
States. This is the very same system 
that the State used to certify the 2020 
election, even though its figures do not 
match more than half of Pennsylva-
nia’s 67 counties. 
To this day, right now, while we 
stand here, how can this election be 
certified using a system that after 2 
months still displays that over 205,000 
more votes were cast in Pennsylvania 
than people who voted in the November 
election? Let me say that again: 205,000 
more votes than voters. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Colorado is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, to my 
colleague from Pennsylvania, I will say 
this: I carry the same Constitution 
that you do. And the Constitution, sir, 
does not allow you, me, or any Member 
of this body to substitute our judgment 
for that of the American people. It does 
not allow us to disregard the will of the 
American people. Because under this 
Constitution, under our Constitution, 
Congress doesn’t choose the President. 
The American people do. And they 
have chosen in resounding numbers, as 
every single Member of this body well 
understands. 
Madam Speaker, I have been at a loss 
to explain what happened today, but 
there is a statement that I found that 
largely summarized my thoughts on 
the matter. 
‘‘The scenes of mayhem unfolding at 
the seat of our Nation’s government’’ 
are a ‘‘sickening and heartbreaking 
sight. This is how election results are 
disputed in a banana republic, not our 
democratic Republic. I am appalled by 
the reckless behavior of some political 
leaders since the election and by the 
lack of respect shown today for our in-
stitutions, our traditions, and our law 
enforcement. The violent assault on 
the Capitol, and the disruption of a 
constitutionally mandated meeting of 
Congress, was undertaken by people 
whose passions have been inflamed by 
falsehoods and false hopes. Insurrec-
tion could do grave damage to our Na-
tion and our reputation. 
‘‘In the United States of America, it 
is the fundamental responsibility of 
every patriotic citizen to support the 
rule of law. To those who are dis-
appointed in the results of the election: 
Our country is more important than 
the politics of the moment.’’ 
b 0030 
Those are not my words. Those are 
the words of former Republican Presi-
dent George W. Bush. 
To my colleagues, it is after mid-
night tonight. It has been a long day

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H100 
January 6, 2021 
for our country, a long day for our Re-
public. 
Let us dispense with this. Let’s do 
the right thing. Let’s honor our oath. 
Let’s certify the results, and let’s get 
back to the work of the American peo-
ple. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, our 
duty today is significant but straight-
forward. We must count the votes of 
the electors as cast in the electoral 
college and announce the results. 
As discussed, our roles and respon-
sibilities are established by the Con-
stitution and Federal law, and they are 
clear. The facts before us are also 
clear. 
Pennsylvania 
submitted 
one 
slate of electors, as chosen by the vot-
ers of the State. The slate was certified 
according to State law. Now those law-
ful results must be counted and an-
nounced. 
Despite disinformation and any num-
ber of false claims that you may have 
heard, including here today, as former 
Attorney General Barr said: ‘‘We have 
not seen fraud on a scale that could 
have effected a different outcome in 
the election.’’ 
This is not simply a conclusory 
statement. The results of the election 
have been litigated. The record is 
clear: The lawsuits challenging the 
election results failed. They failed be-
cause there is simply no evidence to 
support these baseless claims. 
Now, it is one thing to tweet a belief, 
quite another to provide actual evi-
dence. These cases failed because there 
is no evidence. Judges ruled in the law-
suits that the 2020 election was sound. 
It should come as no surprise that 
Republican officeholders have recog-
nized the election results as legitimate 
and accurately determined in an elec-
tion that was conducted safely, se-
curely, and with integrity. 
We all take an oath to support and 
defend the Constitution. As we near 
the end of the task before us, let’s re-
member the beginning of the Constitu-
tion. Before Article II and the 12th 
Amendment, which spell out the elec-
toral college, and before Article I, 
which creates Congress, the Constitu-
tion begins with the preamble. The pre-
amble is short and bold: ‘‘We the peo-
ple.’’ 
The people spoke in historic num-
bers. Their votes have been counted. 
Their choice is clear. It is time, as the 
law requires, to announce the state of 
the people’s vote. 
The violence and disorder inflicted 
on our democracy by seditious rioters 
today is an indication of why adher-
ence to our Constitution is so vital. 
I urge all of us to stand up for law, 
for democracy, for our Constitution, 
and to stand up for America and reject 
this objection. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, a day 
that was intended to debate the impor-
tance of election integrity and the rule 
of law tragically became a day that 
will be a black mark in our Nation’s 
history. Nevertheless, the work of this 
House must go on, as America will go 
on. 
We must all sincerely thank the Cap-
itol Police and Metro Police for their 
selfless actions today, putting their 
safety and lives on the line to protect 
this House. The lawlessness and vio-
lence of today must be condemned, just 
as all violent protests must be con-
demned. 
Nevertheless, the fact remains, a 
large number of Pennsylvanians are 
enormously frustrated with actions 
taken by elected and appointed offi-
cials in Pennsylvania, which have led 
to a high level of distrust for this past 
election. 
We have the United States Constitu-
tion, which is the reason we have been 
and will continue to be a great country 
and a country of laws. 
The U.S. Constitution is unambig-
uous, Madam Speaker, in declaring 
that State legislatures are the entity 
with the authority to set election pro-
cedures and to enact any changes to 
election law. Article I, Section 4, 
Clause 1 states: ‘‘The times, places, and 
manner of holding elections . . . shall 
be prescribed in each State by the leg-
islature thereof.’’ 
The authority of election procedures 
lies with the State legislature, period. 
In Pennsylvania, this authority was 
indisputably usurped by the Pennsyl-
vania Governor’s office, by the Penn-
sylvania secretary of state, and by the 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court. 
These unlawful actions include, but 
are not limited to, accepting ballots 
past 8 p.m. on election day; incon-
sistent application of verified signa-
ture requirements for in-person ballots 
versus mail-in ballots; authorizing the 
curing of mail-in ballots with less than 
24 hours’ notice, leading to incon-
sistent preparedness between counties; 
and authorizing the use of unsecured 
drop boxes, which is not permitted in 
statute. 
If such unlawful actions are to be ac-
cepted, what do we have to look for-
ward to next year? The Pennsylvania 
secretary of state allowing online vot-
ing because it may be raining in Phila-
delphia? It was a free-for-all. 
Madam Speaker, it was back in 2005 
when then-Minority Leader PELOSI, 
while leading 31 Democrats as they ob-
jected to the Presidential elector cer-
tification, as they did in the last three 
Presidential elections when a Repub-
lican won, stated quite well, actually: 
The 
Members 
of 
Congress 
have 
brought this challenge and are speak-
ing up for their aggrieved constituents, 
many of whom have been disenfran-
chised in this process. This is their 
only opportunity to have this debate 
while the country is listening, and it is 
appropriate to do so. 
Thank you for those words, Madam 
Speaker. They were appropriate then, 
as they are now. 
If there is an American ideal that all 
citizens, regardless of party affiliation, 
can agree upon, it is that we must have 
election integrity. We should not cer-
tify these electors, which were derived 
by unlawful actions and a result of in-
accurate vote tallies. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the remain-
der of my time to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the objec-
tion. 
Tonight, my heart is heavy as we 
consider the dark acts that transpired 
in this Chamber today. But, Madam 
Speaker, the American people can be 
assured that violent and irrational at-
tacks on this body cannot derail the 
constitutional responsibility that lies 
in front of us. 
This has always been about uphold-
ing the law. It has always been about 
protecting government of, by, and for 
the people. Preserving the rule of law 
is more important than ever. 
We must acknowledge that unconsti-
tutional acts unduly impacted the 
Presidential election in Pennsylvania. 
Contrary to law, the supreme court ex-
tended the deadline for mail-in ballots 
for 3 days beyond the election day. 
Contrary to law, the secretary of the 
Commonwealth discarded mail-in bal-
lot signature verification safeguards. 
These leaders took advantage of a 
deadly pandemic and seized the State 
legislature’s rightful authority. 
I took an oath to uphold the law and 
defend the Constitution. I pledged to 
protect free and fair elections. I can-
not, in good faith, certify electors that 
were selected under an unlawful proc-
ess. 
I will object to the electoral college 
certification to protect the will of 
Pennsylvania voters, to uphold the 
law, to restore trust in our electoral 
system, and, ultimately, to save our 
Constitution. 
At Gettysburg, which is in my dis-
trict, 
President 
Abraham 
Lincoln 
spoke about the great task of ensuring 
government by, of, and for the people 
shall not perish from the Earth. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, nearly 7 mil-
lion Pennsylvanians showed up to vote 
in the 2020 elections. They cast their 
votes for Democrats and Republicans 
up and down the ballot, including the 
entire U.S. House delegation, the en-
tire State house, half of the State sen-
ate, and other State and local races. 
Since the election, there have been 
allegations 
of 
widespread 
election 
fraud in Pennsylvania; but, remark-
ably, the 20 suits filed by the Trump 
campaign, Pennsylvania Republicans, 
and others challenging the results in 
Pennsylvania have never claimed that 
there was voter fraud.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

Perhaps that is because attorneys 
could lose their licenses when they 
make unsubstantiated claims in court. 
That is where the rubber really meets 
the road. 
So if these lawsuits didn’t claim elec-
tion fraud, what did they claim? 
Most of the legal challenges to the 
Presidential election in Pennsylvania 
question relatively small numbers of 
ballots that were allegedly tainted by 
technical violations. Even assuming 
that all of these ballots had been cast 
for Joe Biden, throwing them out 
wouldn’t have changed the result of the 
election. 
Now, one exception is the lawsuit 
filed by one of our colleagues from 
Pennsylvania, Kelly v. Commonwealth, 
which would have thrown out all the 
mail-in votes cast in the 2020 general 
election on the grounds that Act 77, the 
State law allowing those votes, was un-
constitutional. That suit would have 
disenfranchised 21⁄2 million Pennsylva-
nians. Let’s let that sink in, 21⁄2 million 
Pennsylvanians would have had their 
votes nullified. 
Now, I want to provide my colleagues 
with some background about the State 
law at the heart of this challenge. In 
2019, the Republican-controlled State 
legislature approved Act 77, a bipar-
tisan bill to reform the State’s election 
laws, which instituted no-excuse mail 
balloting. Act 77 was supported almost 
unanimously by Republicans in the 
State House and State Senate. In fact, 
it was unanimous in the State Senate 
and all but two Republicans in the 
State House. 
Moreover, once this Act was passed, 
Act 77 had a 120-day period where chal-
lenges could be filed against the Act if 
people thought it was unconstitu-
tional. Well, 4 months went by, nobody 
files a challenge. On June 3, Pennsyl-
vania had their primary under this new 
system. Nobody challenged the pri-
mary election. It was only challenged 
in November, when Republicans didn’t 
get the result they wanted at the top of 
the ticket. Not surprisingly, this case 
was dismissed by the Pennsylvania Su-
preme Court and an appeal to the U.S. 
Supreme Court was denied. 
Another exception is Texas v. Penn-
sylvania. They asked the court to re-
ject the results of the Pennsylvania 
Presidential contest in Pennsylvania 
and 
several 
other 
States, 
disenfranchising tens of millions of the 
voters. Seven Republican members of 
the Pennsylvania U.S. House delega-
tion signed the U.S. House Republican 
brief in support of Texas v. Pennsyl-
vania. 
While I feel compelled to point out to 
my colleagues that the same voters 
who sent them to the 117th Congress 
cast their votes for the President by 
marking the very same ballots, which 
were read by the very same ballot scan-
ners and monitored by the very same 
election workers. Yet our colleagues 
who signed the brief only want to in-
validate the Presidential votes. This is 
illogical and inconsistent, colleagues, 
and I am pleased to note that the Su-
preme Court rejected it as well. 
The fact is, the election has received 
unprecedented scrutiny in the courts. I 
believe it is irresponsible and undemo-
cratic to argue today that the U.S. 
Congress ought to relitigate the 2020 
Presidential election and second-guess 
the will of the voters in multiple 
States, the decisions of numerous 
State and Federal courts, including the 
Supreme Court, and the counts and re-
counts conducted by State election of-
ficials. 
There were 20 lawsuits filed in Penn-
sylvania challenging aspects of the 
Presidential election. In 19 of them you 
got laughed out of court. The one case 
you won affected roughly 100 votes. Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS won by over 
80,000. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to support the 
objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise this evening 
with a heavy heart. The violence that 
occurred today at the U.S. Capitol was 
senseless, destructive, and counter to 
our American values. 
This past Sunday, each Member of 
this body took an oath to uphold the 
United States Constitution. And while 
the path of least resistance, particu-
larly following today’s events, would 
be to remain silent, my oath to uphold 
the Constitution does not permit me to 
maintain silence. 
While systemic voter fraud was not 
something proven, we witnessed a sys-
temic failure in the application of 
Pennsylvania’s voting law when it 
comes to the 2020 general election. 
In late 2019, the Commonwealth re-
visited and modernized its election law 
with the bipartisan Act 77. Granted, in 
late 2019, the Commonwealth’s legisla-
ture did not have the foresight to an-
ticipate how COVID–19 would present 
challenges to voting. Despite that, it is 
not up to the Governor, the secretary 
of the Commonwealth, nor the State 
supreme court to unilaterally create 
law. 
The election abuses to Pennsylvania 
Act 77 taken by the Pennsylvania exec-
utive branch and upheld by the Penn-
sylvania judicial branch were clearly 
unconstitutional and had an obvious, if 
not major, impact on the 2020 election, 
particularly when it comes to the citi-
zens’ faith in the electoral process. 
Irregularities in Pennsylvania in-
cluded: Uneven application of the law; 
ballot curing; ignoring signature vali-
dation requirements; using unsecured 
drop boxes; accepting ballots beyond 
the deadlines; and interfering with cer-
tified poll watcher access, among oth-
ers. 
These actions were taken by the 
Commonwealth’s Governor and sec-
retary of state where the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court circumvented the au-
thority of the State legislature. Fur-
thermore, the chief law officer of the 
Commonwealth sat idly while this 
process unfolded. 
Now, I joined many of my colleagues 
in Pennsylvania requesting the legisla-
tors in Harrisburg conduct an inves-
tigation and audit to ensure such neg-
ligence will be prevented in future elec-
tions. 
I have serious concerns about how 
these irregularities in the application 
of the Commonwealth’s election laws 
will play in future elections. Only with 
equal application of law will the voters 
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
have certainty in their election proc-
esses. 
Now, I remain committed to ensuring 
the voters receive an electoral system 
they deserve and where equal applica-
tion of law is guaranteed. If our elec-
tion integrity is compromised, we have 
failed the very voters who have sent us 
here to defend the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. HARRIS). 
Mr. HARRIS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The oath I took is very simple. 
Madam Speaker, you administered it. 
It is to support and defend the Con-
stitution. 
Now, as you walk back to the office 
buildings, you will walk by that wall 
that has when the various States ac-
cepted that Constitution. Remember, 
when a State accepts the Constitution, 
it agrees to accept every part of the 
Constitution. It doesn’t get to pick and 
choose. 
Pennsylvania was there when it was 
written. They were so enthusiastic 
about the Constitution, they approved 
it in 1787. 
My State, Maryland, is a little fur-
ther down the wall, 1788. They were 
there when it was written. 
The clause that gave the legislature 
the power over the elections was there 
when they accepted it. It has been 
there since. How dare the judicial 
branch or the executive branch of that 
State usurp the legislative authority. 
That is a clear violation of the Con-
stitution. 
Now, we heard there is no evidence. 
Evidence? 
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
unilaterally extended the deadline to 
receive absentee and mail-in ballots. 
Does anybody contest that over here? 
Does it say the legislature did that? 
No, it doesn’t. It says the court did 
it. 
That is a violation. That is what the 
Texas lawsuit was all about. We dis-
advantage other States when States 
like 
Pennsylvania, 
the 
executive 
branch and judicial branch, cheat on 
the Constitution; and that is what they 
did here. 
But there is more evidence. But wait, 
there is more. The Democrat secretary 
of the Commonwealth eroded integrity 
by dismissing signature authentication 
on a ballot. 
Does anyone here believe the Penn-
sylvania legislature would have agreed

to create a separate system for mail-in

you mail it in, you don’t need a signa-

and it has to be authenticated? 
Of course not. The legislature clearly 
wouldn’t have agreed to that. But that 
didn’t stop the usurpation of constitu-
tional authority.

Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposi-
tion. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, tonight, we 
will not be picking the President, for 
the people did that on November 3. 
Rather, tonight, in this House, we will 
decide whether American democracy 
survives. Let us be under no illusion. 
These are the stakes. If this objection 
succeeds and the will of 7 million Penn-
sylvania voters is cast aside, it will be 
the end of our representative democ-
racy. 
Now, there is no reasonable debate 
about what happened in this election in 
Pennsylvania. 
Seven 
million 
Penn-
sylvanians voted. Joe Biden won by 
over 81,000 votes. This was certified in 
67 counties by bipartisan local-elected 
officials, including Republicans. And 
every single court, whether the judge is 
a Democrat or a Republican, has re-
affirmed this outcome. 
The objectors, however, claim we do 
not know the will of the people because 
the election in Pennsylvania was some-
how conducted corruptly. Much of 
their objection centers around the 
State law passed in 2019 known as Act 
77 that gives voters the option of ex-
panded mail-in voting. Objectors are 
alleging that this law was somehow a 
brilliant plot by Democrats to dis-
advantage Republicans and rig elec-
tions. This is laughable. 
Here are the facts. Act 77 was a Re-
publican-led effort in a Republican- 
controlled legislature. Literally, every 
single Republican in the Pennsylvania 
Senate voted for it. And in the state-
house, the vote among Republicans was 
105–2. 
Here is what the Republican speaker 
of the Pennsylvania House had to say 
about Act 77: This bill does not benefit 
one party or the other or any one can-
didate or single election. It serves to 
preserve the integrity of every election 
and lift the voice of every voter in the 
Commonwealth. 
So there is no question as to the 
facts surrounding this election. They 
are as clear as they are overwhelming. 
The only question that remains is this: 
Will this House reaffirm our fidelity to 
our democracy, or will we end it? 
I must concede, Madam Speaker, I 
have been naive about one subject. I al-
ways just assumed our democracy 
would naturally endure, almost as if it 
was predestined, I never even ques-
tioned it until the last several years. 
Two centuries ago, one of our Found-
ing Fathers cautioned against this no-
tion. John Adams wrote, ‘‘Remember, 
democracy never lasts long. It soon 
wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. 
There was never a democracy yet that 
did not commit suicide.’’ 
I now realize the wisdom of his 
words. Never again will I take for 
granted our democracy. It must be 
jealously defended by every generation. 
Always. 
But, Madam Speaker, despite the 
alarm, I feel that our democracy has 
been brought to this breaking point, as 
we have seen today. Nonetheless, I still 
maintain hope. 
Growing up in Philadelphia, raised in 
an immigrant family, I was often 
brought down to visit the historic 
sights. Every summer, without fail, we 
would spend a day seeing Independence 
Hall, Congress Hall, the Liberty Bell. 
It was at Independence Hall where 
our Nation was declared free and our 
Constitution born. At the Constitu-
tional Convention, the oldest and most 
widely accomplished delegate was Ben-
jamin Franklin, one of our greatest 
Founding Fathers and my city’s great-
est citizen. 
On the final day, as the last delegates 
were signing the Constitution, Frank-
lin pointed to the painted Sun on the 
back of the Convention chair. Observ-
ing the painters had found it difficult 
to distinguish a rising Sun from a set-
ting Sun, Franklin went on to say: 
I have often, during the course of this ses-
sion, looked at that Sun without being able 
to tell whether it was rising or setting. But 
now, at length, I have the happiness to know 
it is a rising Sun. 
Madam Speaker, on a day like today, 
when a mob has stormed the Capitol, 
and some Members are threatening the 
core of our democracy, it can be hard 
to tell whether for American democ-
racy the Sun is rising or setting. But I 
maintain my faith that tonight, by an 
overwhelming bipartisan majority in 
Congress, we will uphold the will of 
‘‘We the People,’’ and our democracy 
will live. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to support the objec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman 
from Georgia is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. GREENE of Georgia. I would 
like to point out that all the cases that 
have 
been 
thrown 
out 
have 
been 
thrown out on standing, not the evi-
dence of voter fraud. I would also like 
to point out the same people who, for 4 
years, have failed to find a shred of evi-
dence to convict President Trump of 
Russian collusion are the same people 
trying to discredit hardworking Amer-
ican poll watchers who are risking per-
jury by signing affidavits confirming 
massive voter fraud in multiple States. 
The same fake news who took the 
word of Christine Blasey Ford against 
Justice 
Kavanaugh, 
who 
her 
own 
friends denied happened, also dismissed 
the sworn under penalty of perjury ac-
counts from people who witnessed the 
election fraud. 
The same fact-checkers who told you 
that Dominion machines weren’t con-
nected to the internet and couldn’t be 
hacked are the same people telling you 
that there has been no voter fraud and 
no violations of election law. But it has 
been proven that these machines are 
connected and that they can be hacked. 
We have heard repeatedly argued 
that objecting to these ballots is un-
constitutional and violates the rights 
of State legislatures. They would rath-
er us affirm fraud and pass the buck 
back to States rather than following 
the process Madison, Hamilton, Jeffer-
son, and the Framers of the Constitu-
tion designed. 
When States fail to do their job, we 
are the last line of defense. Congress is 
here for this exact situation. We are 
here to be the fail-safe when States 
refuse to protect the people’s votes. 
By objecting today, we are telling 
the thousands of witnesses who signed 
affidavits that we have their back, and 
we will not allow local officials who 
violate their own election laws to steal 
this election from those who lawfully 
voted. 
I yield to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. NORMAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to support the foundation of our 
democracy, the Constitution of the 
United States of America. This docu-
ment is the fabric and the solid founda-
tion of a nation we call America, which 
has been a beacon of hope and a shining 
city on the hill for over 230 years. 
The words of our Constitution, as 
spelled out in Article II, Section 1, are 
very clear when it comes to our elec-
tions: mandating, not suggesting, not 
implying, but mandating that State 
legislatures, not secretaries of State, 
not State commissions, not county of-
ficials, not Governors, but State legis-
lators prescribe the time, place, and 
manner of holding elections. 
This mandate was not followed in the 
great State of Pennsylvania. If we 
allow this fraud to go on—in a football 
analogy, the moving of the goalpost 
after the ball has been kicked and in 
the air—the preview of coming attrac-
tions will be future elections that do 
not adhere to honest and open voting 
by ‘‘We the People’’ and the loss of our 
great Republic. 
As a lady told me not long ago, don’t 
spit in my face and tell me it is rain-
ing. This is exactly what has happened 
to the American people in this elec-
tion. In the words of Winston Church-
ill, when Great Britain was under siege 
by Germany, he said: There will be a

time when doing your best is not good 
enough. We must do what is required. 
And we must do what is required to 
save this great Republic. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. WILD. Madam Speaker, as terri-
fying as today was here in the people’s 
House, it was, thankfully, fairly short 
in duration. In contrast, the pain and 
fear that so many Americans are expe-
riencing this year has been long and 
continuous to this very moment. 
Rather 
than 
pitting 
Americans 
against Americans, as we are here, we 
should be working to ensure rapid dis-
tribution of vaccines and adequate re-
lief to Americans who are struggling 
economically because of this horrific 
pandemic. But we are not doing that. 
Instead, we have witnessed a stunning 
assault on our democracy itself. 
This challenge is not an act of patri-
otism. The position of the objectors is 
completely incompatible with patriot-
ism. 
Our country is defined by her great 
people, and our democracy is defined 
above all else by our Constitution, a 
Constitution that these individuals 
want to ignore because they have de-
cided that their judgment, the judg-
ment of a small minority of partisan 
elites, should somehow override that of 
the more than 155 million Americans 
who participated in this election. That, 
my friends, is not democracy. 
b 0100 
We should all remember this coun-
try’s founding was a rejection of mon-
archy, a rejection of the notion that 
any one person could be all-powerful. 
Our commitment to self-determination 
is what gave rise to our Declaration of 
Independence and our Constitution. It 
is why our Founders made the choice 
to build a country anchored in respect 
for the rule of law rather than one tied 
to the whims of men. It is why we have 
free and fair elections that allow us to 
vote out those who hold office. 
I am proud to join the vast majority 
of my colleagues in both Chambers, Re-
publicans and Democrats alike, in 
making it clear that our democracy is 
bigger than any of us. 
Let’s be clear: Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS won a victory of 306 electoral 
votes in the electoral college, the same 
margin that President Trump won by 
in 2016 when he called it a landslide. 
Nearly 7 million of my fellow Penn-
sylvanians 
braved 
this 
devastating 
pandemic and economic crisis to cast 
their ballots, culminating in a total 
turnout of more than 70 percent, the 
highest in the history of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. And nation-
wide, we saw record-breaking turnout. 
Both in Pennsylvania and nationally, 
the President’s efforts to overturn the 
election results in the courts failed re-
soundingly, with many of the strongest 
rebukes coming from judges the Presi-
dent himself appointed. 
In fact, contrary to the assertion of 
my colleague from Georgia across the 
aisle, not a single lawsuit in Pennsyl-
vania alleged fraud. The gentlewoman 
may not be aware of this, but allega-
tions of fraud require specificity and 
detail, and no lawyer could risk his or 
her license to make such false claims. 
I am heartened that several of the 
country’s leading Republicans, includ-
ing Senate Republican Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL, Senator MITT
ROMNEY, 
and former Republican Speaker of the 
House Paul Ryan, have spoken out 
against this political stunt. 
Senator ROMNEY said: ‘‘The egregious 
ploy to reject electors may enhance the 
political ambition of some, but dan-
gerously threatens our democratic Re-
public.’’ 
And as former Republican Represent-
ative Charlie Dent from my district 
said, the claim by the President of 
voter fraud in our State ‘‘was simply 
reprehensible; the truth is that he sup-
pressed his own vote by discouraging 
mail-in voting.’’ 
And as Pennsylvania State Senator 
Gene Yaw, also a Republican, has said: 
‘‘My question is, if the mail-in voting 
of Act 77 was so bad, why did The 
Trump Organization send out a mail-in 
ballot application to every registered 
Republican in the State?’’ 
Today, I am thinking of all of the 
people who took the time to do their 
civic duty and vote, many standing in 
long lines or painstakingly researching 
how to vote by mail correctly. 
We reject these disgraceful attacks 
on the voters of Pennsylvania and this 
attempt to throw out their votes. 
To those in this Chamber who may 
cynically believe that stoking the 
forces of disinformation and division 
may be worth a short-term benefit to 
their political careers, I would urge se-
rious self-reflection. 
Our democracy is one of the most 
precious resources of the American 
people, protected against enormous 
odds and at great sacrifice by each gen-
eration of servicemembers and every-
day citizens who put their lives on the 
line to build a freer and more equitable 
nation. They deserve better than what 
is happening in this Chamber today. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. SMUCKER. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to start by making two 
basic points: 
Number one, individual States who 
administer elections must ensure that 
they are conducted fairly, uniformly, 
and in accordance with the law; and 
Number two, every American wants 
to be, and deserves to be, confident 
that our elections are secure and that 
all eligible legal votes are counted ac-
curately and in a transparent manner. 
And I will say this. In my district in 
Lancaster and York Counties, I think 
that occurred. I am very proud of my 
county election officials, who upheld 
the Pennsylvania Constitution and fol-
lowed the letter of the law; but, unfor-
tunately, that sentiment is not shared 
across the Commonwealth. 
Today, my objection is not about 
voter fraud; it is grounded on unconsti-
tutional measures taken by bureau-
crats and partisan justices in the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania that have 
unlawfully changed how this election 
was 
carried 
out. 
This 
potentially 
changed the outcome and certainly 
caused millions of our States’ voters to 
question the election results. Other 
speakers have outlined this issue. 
In brief, the Pennsylvania State Leg-
islature, in 2019, passed a bipartisan 
election law reform bill, and then the 
partisan Pennsylvania Supreme Court 
took it upon themselves to rewrite 
that law just 7 weeks before the elec-
tion. They unlawfully legislated from 
the 
bench 
and 
made 
substantive 
changes to the law, including allowing 
for unsecured drop boxes and ordering 
that ballots received after the election 
be counted, among other things. 
The Pennsylvania Secretary of State 
took it even further. Her unilateral, 
unconstitutional changes resulted in 
counties treating ballots differently so 
that some voters had the opportunity 
to change mail-in ballots to correct de-
ficiencies, while in other counties, 
their ballots simply were not counted. 
As Members of Congress, we serve as 
a voice for our constituents. This is the 
one time I have a voice in this process, 
and I cannot simply look away when 
tens of thousands of my constituents 
have real and legitimate concerns 
about how this election was conducted 
in Pennsylvania. 
In fact, I think an inadequate re-
sponse to those concerns by Pennsyl-
vania officials is one of the major prob-
lems. Simple measures like audits 
should be routine and random and sup-
ported by both parties, and I believe 
they are critical for restoring faith in 
Pennsylvania’s elections moving for-
ward. 
The bottom line for my constituents 
is that Pennsylvania’s officials, at all 
levels, failed to conduct a uniform and 
legal election, and for that reason, 
they inappropriately and unlawfully 
certified the State’s electors. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLER), my col-
league. 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. SMUCKER) for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the violence that 
occurred in the Capitol today was 
shameful, unacceptable, and un-Amer-
ican. We are a nation of laws, not law-
lessness, and we will never give in to 
the mob. 
Thank you to the men and women of 
our Capitol Police and other law en-
forcement agencies who heroically de-
fended this building. 
The criminal behavior we witnessed 
today does not erase the facts before 
us.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H104 
January 6, 2021 
I am objecting to the certification of 
Pennsylvania’s electoral votes because 
Governor Tom Wolf, Secretary of State 
Kathy Boockvar, and the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court violated the State leg-
islature’s clear constitutional author-
ity to set election proceedings. 
Under the Pennsylvania Constitu-
tion, only the General Assembly has 
the power to set election law. 
Additionally, Article II of the U.S. 
Constitution explicitly grants State 
legislatures, not the Governor acting 
alone and not the courts, the explicit 
power to determine the manner of ap-
pointing Presidential electors. 
Pennsylvania’s court unlawfully ex-
tended the deadline to receive absentee 
and mail-in ballots. Governor Wolf’s 
administration dismissed signature au-
thentication procedures for absentee 
and mail-in ballots, allowed for the un-
even administration of the election 
across 
counties, 
and 
unilaterally 
changed Pennsylvania’s election code 
without the State legislature’s con-
sent. 
The Constitution is clear and the 
facts are indisputable. 
This past weekend, each Member of 
this body stood in this Chamber and 
swore an oath to protect and defend 
our Constitution. I intend to fulfill my 
constitutional oath which the people of 
Pennsylvania have entrusted in me. My 
objection is grounded in the Constitu-
tion and rule of law. 
If we allow the Governor to violate 
the constitutional rights of the Gen-
eral Assembly, what is stopping him 
from 
violating 
the 
constitutional 
rights of the 12.8 million Pennsylva-
nians our State legislators were elected 
to represent? 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rep-
resent the Third District of Pennsyl-
vania, which includes part of Philadel-
phia, the birthplace of America. It was 
in Philadelphia that the Constitution 
of the United States was written and 
signed, the very Constitution that we 
are all sworn to uphold as Members of 
the House of Representatives. 
We are elected to serve our constitu-
ents, and it is our job to represent 
them and their interests in Congress. 
Yesterday, I spoke to the son of the 
late Dick Thornburgh, who is a two- 
time Republican Governor of Pennsyl-
vania and was Attorney General under 
President Ronald Reagan and Presi-
dent Bush. His son stressed to me that 
his father would have wanted the rule 
of law to prevail regardless of the polit-
ical outcome, because he cared more 
about the safeguarding of democracy 
than partisanship. 
In addition, Al Schmidt, who was a 
Republican commissioner of elections, 
said, when Philadelphia certified its re-
sults on November 23: ‘‘I’m proud that 
the birthplace of our Republic held the 
most transparent and secure election 
in the history of Philadelphia.’’ 
Instead of using this time to dispute 
the results of our fair and lawful elec-
tion, we should be spending this time 
making sure vaccines are quickly given 
to essential workers and our most vul-
nerable communities, that people are 
getting housing. 
We should look at rental assistance. 
We should ensure that that is avail-
able. 
Small businesses, the engines of our 
economy, should be getting needed 
grants and loans. 
That should be our focus. 
Hospitals desperately need support 
and help. We should be paying atten-
tion to the needs of hospitals. 
We are in the middle of a pandemic 
where hundreds of thousands of people 
are dying, and we are in a recession 
that is putting millions of Americans 
at risk of hunger, homelessness, or 
both. It is time we start legislating for 
the people. 
One last person I want to mention is 
our junior Senator, Senator TOOMEY. 
There are very few things that he and 
I agree on, but he has stated very 
clearly that Joe Biden has won this 
election. He has stood up on the Senate 
floor and he has stated that. 
So it needs to be very clear that the 
late 
Governor 
Thornburgh; 
Albert 
Schmidt, the commissioner; and our 
current junior Senator all have one 
thing in common: democracy first, par-
tisanship second. Let’s keep that in 
mind. 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The Chair recognizes 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico for 
5 minutes. 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, this 
is not how I imagined my first speech 
in the House of Representatives or my 
first week to be in Washington. 
The violence that occurred in this 
building yesterday is reprehensible and 
inexcusable. I am appalled by anyone 
who assaults our Nation’s law enforce-
ment officers. 
I swore an oath on Sunday to support 
and defend the Constitution of the 
United States. We are here today de-
layed, but not deterred, to debate a 
constitutional question and follow a 
constitutional process. 
The Constitution gives State legisla-
tors, not State executives or judges, 
the sole authority to determine how 
their State selects Presidential elec-
tors. 
Nobody disputes that in Pennsyl-
vania, as well as in other States, rules 
and regulations were changed by execu-
tive fiat or judicial edict. 
These changes were significant and 
irregular. They included changes to 
vote-by-mail deadlines, identity verifi-
cation requirements, and other ballot 
handling practices. 
In 
Pennsylvania 
specifically, 
the 
Democrat Secretary of the Common-
wealth and the Democrat-controlled 
Pennsylvania Supreme Court usurped 
the constitutional authority of the 
State legislature. 
b 0110 
Together, they exceeded their au-
thority by extending the deadline for 
absentee ballots and by waiving signa-
ture requirements for those ballots. 
In their haste to make these changes, 
the secretary and the court created 
two different and unequal standards for 
voters. Pennsylvanians who chose to 
vote in person still had to have their 
signatures verified at their polling 
place, but those who chose to vote by 
mail did not. How is this process fair? 
This objection is about Pennsylvania, 
but it affects every State. As a State 
Representative of New Mexico, Penn-
sylvania’s unconstitutional actions dis-
enfranchised my constituents and the 
constituents of my colleagues. It is my 
duty to give my constituents a voice. 
Signing these objections raises their 
concerns to the fullest extent my office 
allows. 
I, again, condemn in the strongest 
terms the violence that took place here 
yesterday. We have many issues to 
solve, including reforms to restore all 
Americans’ faith in the fairness of our 
elections. I look forward to those seri-
ous civil and peaceful debates. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the gentleman from 
South Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, this 
process we are going through today 
isn’t about personalities. This isn’t 
about Joe Biden or Donald Trump. As 
hard as some try to paint it that way, 
let me say that names and personal-
ities don’t matter. This is, gravely, 
about the Constitution of the United 
States. 
Almost 20 years ago, after the at-
tacks on 9/11, Americans were per-
suaded to give up some of their con-
stitutional liberties. Using the jus-
tification of that global crisis, the ter-
rorist attacks on that fateful day, 
America saw the erosion of their lib-
erties for the safety and security many 
felt they may receive through the USA 
PATRIOT Act and other resulting 
processes too many felt would keep us 
safe from another attack here on our 
shore. 
This year, using the justification of 
the global pandemic, COVID–19, we 
once again saw our Nation’s Constitu-
tion violated. You see, the Constitu-
tion is clear in Article II, Madam 
Speaker, that the power and duty to 
set the manner of national elections 
rests solely with the State legislatures. 
That power doesn’t rest with us. That 
power didn’t rest in the hands of 
unelected county election officials, sec-
retaries of state, or a supreme court 
but, rather, in the hands of the State 
legislatures, which pass laws setting 
the manner of elections held in their 
States. 
This year, using the extraordinary 
circumstance of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, we witnessed these duly passed 
laws circumvented and usurped time 
and again, not by having the laws 
changed in the respective State legisla-
tive bodies, but those laws arbitrarily

and unilaterally changed by county 
clerks; secretaries of state; and, in this 
case of Pennsylvania, an elected su-
preme court, which is supposed to in-
terpret the law, not make law. 
When those nonlegislative entities 
change the laws without getting the 
general assemblies to change the law, 
in my opinion, the resulting ballots 
cast, either by mail or in person, those 
ballots were illegal under the law. 
Illegal ballots should not be counted. 
Therefore, the resulting electoral votes 
should be considered invalid. 
What bothers me is that so many of 
you are okay with that, that so many 
Americans, because their person won, 
you are okay with the manner in which 
that victory was gained. 
It is politics. Look, I get it. But we 
didn’t swear an oath to play politics. 
We swore an oath to the United States 
Constitution. As George Washington 
said: The Constitution is the guide 
which I will never abandon. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. HOULAHAN. Madam Speaker, 
first, I do want to acknowledge the 
devastating events of the last 12 hours 
and to express my deep appreciation 
for those who have worked to secure 
this building and safeguard our democ-
racy. On behalf of my colleagues, we 
are all grateful for your service. 
I ran for this office on a platform of 
civility and decency, and many of my 
colleagues and constituents know that 
I am a third-generation veteran, and I 
grew up in a military household. 
b 0120 
Madam Speaker, what you may not 
know, though, is that I grew up in a di-
vided household. Throughout my child-
hood, one parent voted Democrat and 
the other Republican. In my purple 
household, I learned that duty to coun-
try was far more important than party 
allegiance. With each election, my fa-
ther would say: ‘‘And when the election 
is done, we salute smartly and we carry 
on.’’ 
Now I live in and I serve in a commu-
nity that has a lot in common with the 
home that I grew up in. It, too, is a 
purple place that honors civility and 
decency. Pennsylvania’s Sixth District 
is, in many ways, a microcosm of the 
Commonwealth and of our Nation. Our 
voter registration in Chester County is 
40–40–20, R, D, and I. Voters across my 
district commonly split their ticket, 
some voting for President-elect Biden 
while also voting down the ballot for 
Republicans for our State legislature. 
What some of my colleagues are ar-
guing today is that those very ballots 
are illegitimate. My colleagues cannot 
honestly believe that. In fact, just this 
week they joined me on the House floor 
to be sworn in to this hallowed body, 
and they trusted that the votes cast in 
their favor were legitimate. And they 
are right. If those votes counted, then 
so too must the votes for President- 
elect Biden. 
We have also heard today concerns 
about mail-in ballots. I am not a law-
yer, but I am an engineer and, there-
fore, a student of numbers. It wasn’t 
just Democrats who voted by mail. It 
was not a free-for-all, as it was de-
scribed earlier. Madam Speaker, 600,000 
Republicans in Pennsylvania across the 
State voted by mail. By questioning 
the election results, you are telling 
those Pennsylvanians that the hours 
they spent in line to cast their ballot 
or the trip they took to the post office 
in the middle of a pandemic just didn’t 
matter. 
Alan Novak is a man who served as 
the chair of the Republican Party in 
Pennsylvania for nearly a decade. I will 
say that again. The Chair of the Repub-
lican Party of Pennsylvania for a dec-
ade is one of those voters I am talking 
about in Pennsylvania. He lives in my 
district, and he split his ticket. He 
voted for me as his Member of Congress 
and also for President Trump. And he 
eloquently said: 
What makes America great, exceptional, 
and enduring is our commitment to our gov-
ernment of laws, our orderly constitutional 
process that settles our election disputes, 
and our peaceful transfer of power with re-
spect and civility. It is easy when it is pretty 
and the outcome is not controversial. But 
when it is not pretty and there is con-
troversy, then it is even more important 
that we respect, honor, and abide by our re-
vered and tested process for the orderly 
transfer of power. Perhaps that may be all 
that we can agree on, and it is the need for 
grace, respect, and civility. 
So I ask my colleagues across the 
aisle: Are you willing to disenfranchise 
people like Mr. Novak and the more 
than 400,000 people in Pennsylvania’s 
Sixth District? 
Perhaps some of the independent and 
pragmatic spirit that is so prevalent 
among voters in my community comes 
from the history of the place that we 
call home. Many Americans have vis-
ited Philadelphia and our historic 
sites, but very few make it out to my 
community, which is the home of Val-
ley Forge. Here, General George Wash-
ington led the Continental Army to 
winter quarters. The war had not been 
going well for our young soldiers, and 
that winter was harder still. It was bit-
terly cold, and food shortages and 
smallpox were abundant. Many people 
died. 
We remember what happened there 
because it was a test of our endurance, 
a demonstration of devotion to mission 
and to our country over ourselves. 
Coming out of that awful winter expe-
rience, 
our 
troops 
emerged 
better 
trained, united, and ultimately vic-
torious. In those harsh, dark times, 
they found their common ground and 
their fortitude. 
Just like then, it is in these trying 
moments when we learn who our lead-
ers truly are. They are the ones who 
don’t just represent the people or give 
orders or ready us for a fight. They are 
those who educate and who speak 
truth. They inspire confidence and 
unity rather than sowing division and 
strife. There is a striking parallel be-
tween our nascent country and what 
they endured in Valley Forge and what 
we are enduring right now: A hard win-
ter of division, illness running ramp-
ant, and an uncertain future. 
Today, our country’s resolve is being 
tested, and I know that we will pass 
this test together and be made strong-
er. We now have the opportunity and 
the responsibility to do that tonight by 
upholding the will of the people, by 
voting to certify the results of this 
electoral college and by moving for-
ward with a servant heart and a com-
mon resolve to preserve this great ex-
periment that is the United States of 
America. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. BABIN. It is with great pride and 
a profound sense of responsibility that 
I object to the 2020 election in the 
State of Pennsylvania. 
I am very proud to stand alongside 
fellow patriots who have pushed back 
against a fraudulent and criminal elec-
tion process—a process that was the 
antithesis to the very rule of law that 
governs these United States. 
At the same time, standing here to-
night is surreal because this is a crit-
ical juncture that will undoubtedly de-
termine the survivability of this great 
Republic. 
Our free and fair election process— 
and by extension, the people’s trust in 
its legitimacy—is what has separated 
us as a nation. A process that we have 
shared with the world, its moral force. 
A process that now, sadly, has been 
bastardized by those more interested in 
the maintenance of power than they 
are in the free and open voice of the 
American people. 
If I remember correctly, Democrats 
were calling for transparency in 2000 
and 2004, when George W. Bush was 
elected; and again in 2016, when Presi-
dent Trump took office. 
Where are you now? 
I ask this, Madam Speaker: What do 
you have to lose by having a thorough 
investigation to determine the validity 
of these votes? 
Why not encourage an investigation 
to relieve the concerns of half of the 
people in this country? 
If you are so convinced that Biden 
was elected legitimately, what do you 
have to fear? 
If there was no fraud, simply show us 
the proof. Investigate it. Validate it. 
This isn’t about one candidate versus 
another. This is about upholding the 
principles that are indispensable to the 
existence of the democratic Republic 
that we are so fortunate to call home. 
I have no doubt that there was wide-
spread election fraud this past Novem-
ber, and I am not alone. I stand here 
today speaking for 75 million Ameri-
cans whose voice was unconstitution-
ally silenced.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H106 
January 6, 2021 
To you, the silenced, I say this: I will 
continue to fight for you. You have 
been heard. For more than 240 years, 
tyranny has sought to extinguish the 
light of freedom. 
As Ronald Reagan said before: Free-
dom is a fragile thing, and it is never 
more than one generation away from 
extinction. 
The Constitution and the Bible on 
which it stands is stronger than the 
cheap tyrannical tactics of those who 
seek to destroy it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
BUDD). 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, mob vio-
lence is not representative of our coun-
try or of this building. The American 
people—at least the ones who are still 
up watching right now—have seen this 
body return to a peaceful debate. And 
that is the American way. So let’s get 
back to that debate and let’s talk for a 
moment about Pennsylvania. 
For decades, absentee voting was re-
served for members of the military and 
citizens who are medically or phys-
ically unable to get to the polls. But in 
2019, Pennsylvania dramatically in-
creased the amount of ballots that 
would be cast in the Presidential elec-
tion 
through 
expanded, 
no-excuse, 
mail-in voting. 
On 
September 
17, 
Pennsylvania’s 
Democrat-controlled 
Supreme 
Court 
violated the Constitution by extending 
the deadline to receive mail-in ballots. 
Article II states that legislatures, not 
the courts, determine the time, man-
ner, and place of their States’ elec-
tions. But Pennsylvania’s high court 
directed the State officials to assume 
that non-postmarked ballots were re-
ceived on time without any evidence 
that they were sent before election 
day. 
On October 23, while early voting was 
already underway, the State supreme 
court ruled that election officials did 
not have to authenticate signatures for 
mail-in ballots. 
To sum it up, Pennsylvania officials 
illegally did three critical things: 
One, they radically expanded vote by 
mail for virtually any reason. 
Two, they removed restrictions when 
a ballot can be sent in. 
Three, they removed signature verifi-
cation on those very ballots. 
Just this week, the Pennsylvania 
Senate pleaded with Members of this 
body to delay certification until the 
Supreme Court resolves these disputes. 
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
violated their own constitution. They 
violated the U.S. Constitution. They 
opened the door for thousands of un-
verifiable ballots. 
Because they failed to guarantee the 
integrity of their votes, I cannot con-
sent to accepting Pennsylvania’s elec-
toral votes. 
b 0130 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the challenge. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman 
from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, this is a 
sad day for America—a day of shame, a 
day of ignominy, an attack on this 
Capitol, an attack on our country. 
Madam Speaker, our words matter. 
Mobs, thugs, insurrectionists, domestic 
terrorists attacked our government 
with the aim of attacking our free and 
fair elections. 
Make no mistake, these terrorists 
came armed, armed with false flags; 
armed with hate; armed with weapons; 
and, tragically, armed with lies force- 
fed to them by those at the highest 
level of government, including some 
from the legislative and, yes, the exec-
utive branches. Incited by the one at 
the highest level of government, they 
attacked people, property, this Capitol, 
this cathedral of democracy. 
Words matter. In his last words to 
our Nation and to all of us here, our 
dear colleague, John Lewis, wrote last 
July: ‘‘Democracy is not a state. It is 
an act.’’ And each generation has an 
obligation to preserve its institutions. 
Democracy is a series of acts, acts by 
you and by me, by citizens, one build-
ing upon the other and another—not 
acts that we have heard and seen and 
suffered today, words and acts to incite 
violence, acts that tear at the very fab-
ric of our democracy. 
Madam Speaker, yet, I have hope. 
We, too, are armed. We are armed with 
the facts. We are armed with the truth. 
We are armed with the love of our 
country. We are armed with our sworn 
oaths. And we are armed with our pre-
cious Constitution. 
We have faced tyranny and insurrec-
tion before. We are here tonight to her-
ald to America and to the world: We 
will defend our democracy, and we will 
endure. 
Madam Speaker, when I came into 
work this morning, as I was preparing 
to come to the floor, I read Tom Fried-
man’s op-ed, which began with the 
words from the Gospel of Mark: For 
what shall it profit a man if he gain 
the whole world but lose his soul? 
For what shall it profit any man. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my Repub-
lican colleagues to have the courage to 
uphold their oath, courage like that of 
Congresswoman 
Margaret 
Chase 
Smith, a lifelong Republican and the 
first in her party to speak out against 
McCarthyism. Putting duty over fear, 
she said: ‘‘I do not want to see the Re-
publican Party ride to political victory 
on the Four Horsemen of Calumny— 
Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry, and Smear. 
Surely, we Republicans are not that 
desperate for victory.’’ 
Madam Speaker, for today, we have 
seen the cost of victory by such means. 
It shook the very walls of this building. 
Our colleagues know there is no truth 
to this challenge. 
For what shall it profit a man. 
Madam Speaker, it has been my sol-
emn honor to participate in this sad 
day. I pray for our country. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support the objection of the 
electoral certification of the Common-
wealth of Pennsylvania. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman 
from Florida is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, as 
a new Representative here, I did not 
envision my first speech on the House 
floor to be this, here tonight, but rath-
er, a tribute to our first responders and 
frontline workers who have been a 
shining light in an otherwise tough 
year for us all. 
After the events tonight, I am espe-
cially grateful for our men and women 
who put service above self, confronting 
lawlessness and danger while pro-
tecting this very Chamber, its Mem-
bers, and our constitutional Republic. 
As a Member of the people’s House, 
and the wife of a first responder, thank 
you to our law enforcement here today. 
But, especially, after tonight’s unac-
ceptable breach of the people’s House, I 
am furthermore resolved in the fact 
that we, as representatives of the peo-
ple, must take a stand for every Ameri-
can’s right to a free and fair election as 
guaranteed by the Constitution. 
Article I, Section 4, Clause 1 of the 
Constitution explicitly rests the time 
and manner of our elections in the 
hands of our State legislatures. How-
ever, State law in the 2020 election was 
modified or circumvented without ap-
proval of the State legislature. These 
actions are in clear violation of the 
Constitution, specifically Article II, 
Section 1, Clause 2, which grants State 
legislatures the sole authority to es-
tablish how State Presidential electors 
are appointed. 
These changes, along with other elec-
tion irregularities throughout the 2020 
election, require me, as a Member of 
this body, to object to the certification 
of these electoral votes, just as my col-
leagues across the aisle have objected 
to every Republican Presidential elec-
tion over the last 20 years. 
Tonight, as we undertake the very 
serious responsibility of debating these 
State electoral certifications, I urge 
my colleagues to listen earnestly and 
with an open mind, remembering that 
just 3 days ago, we swore an oath to 
the United States Constitution, not a 
political party. 
Our constituents are counting on us. 
Our country is counting on us. Our 
children are counting on us, and we 
cannot let them down. 
Madam Speaker, in December, 25 of 
my freshman colleagues and I sent you 
a letter imploring you to investigate 
these election irregularities. To date, 
we have not received a response. That 
brings us to today. 
My colleagues across the aisle have 
repeatedly invoked our Founding Fa-
ther, 
Benjamin 
Franklin, 
who 
fa-
mously said: We have a republic, if we 
can keep it. 
I say, let’s keep it. 
Madam Speaker, it is with that senti-
ment in mind that I ask my colleagues 
to defend the power vested in this leg-
islative branch by the U.S. Constitu-
tion and reject the certification of the 
electoral votes of the State in ques-
tion. It is our responsibility to have

courage in the face of adversity and 
bring integrity back to this process. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the gentleman from the 
great State of Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from the great 
State of Florida (Mrs. CAMMACK), my 
friend. 
Madam Speaker, as Americans, we 
believe governments receive their just 
powers from the consent of the gov-
erned. That sacred transaction can 
only happen legitimately in a free and 
fair election. 
Election integrity is the very life-
blood of our unrivaled system of self- 
government. The law and the Constitu-
tion gave Congress not only the au-
thority but, I believe, the responsi-
bility to serve as the last check on the 
integrity of our Presidential elections. 
We either believe, according to statute, 
that every elector was ‘‘lawfully cer-
tified’’ and ‘‘regularly given,’’ or we 
don’t. 
States certainly have broad dele-
gated powers to administer Federal 
elections, but they still must operate 
within the bounds of the Constitution. 
Despite 
receiving 
numerous 
peti-
tions—to the detriment of the country, 
I might add—the Supreme Court failed 
to answer the most important question 
of the 2020 election: Can entities out-
side of the State legislatures make 
election law? 
The plain language of Article II of 
the Constitution answers the question 
unequivocally no. 
The decisions made today in these 
Chambers are of the utmost con-
sequence, and the horrible precedent 
that will be established if we don’t act 
will have lasting impact on our beloved 
Republic. 
Madam Speaker, this proceeding is 
not just about the integrity of this 
election. It is about ensuring the integ-
rity of all future elections. 
I take no pleasure or pride in making 
my objection today, nor do I wish for 
any State electors to be disqualified. 
However, based on the law, the Con-
stitution, and my conscience, I cannot 
support certifying votes from any 
State that violated the Constitution. 
Madam Speaker, this decision is not 
about loyalty to a President. It is 
about my fidelity to the Constitution 
and the oath that I swore. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, I came 
here tonight prepared to talk about the 
place I represent and how well the 
Democratic and Republican county of-
ficials ran our election. I wanted to 
point out that in my home county of 
Allegheny County, in the place they 
were counting the votes, there were 31 
video cameras—31—in the same place, 
just showing people counting votes, 
every single one of them on paper, with 
representatives from both campaigns 
watching. 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to point 
out to all these great lovers and sup-
porters of the Pennsylvania legislature 
that it was the Republican Pennsyl-
vania legislature that passed a Repub-
lican bill that they all voted for and 
supported that set up the system under 
which we just ran the election, and 
that the reason the President lost was 
because he was not as popular as other 
Republicans in our State. He got fewer 
votes than all of them. 
Madam Speaker, I wanted to lay out 
all this evidence because I thought it 
was a sign of respect for my colleagues 
and for all the Americans out there 
who don’t know who to trust. I was 
raised on that. I was raised on that re-
spect, which makes this a hard speech 
for me to give. Because to do this with 
any kind of honesty means admitting 
and declaring in this House that these 
objections don’t deserve an ounce of re-
spect—not an ounce. 
b 0140 
A woman died out there tonight, and 
you are making these objections. 
Let’s be clear about what happened 
in this Chamber today. Invaders came 
in for the first time since the War of 
1812. They desecrated these Halls and 
this Chamber and practically every 
inch of ground where we work. For the 
most part, they walked in here free. A 
lot of them walked out free. There 
wasn’t a person watching at home who 
didn’t know why that was—because of 
the way that they look. 
My point, Madam Speaker, is this: 
Enough has been done here already to 
try to strip this Congress of its dignity, 
and these objectors don’t need to do 
anymore. 
We know that that attack today 
didn’t materialize out of nowhere. It 
was inspired by lies, the same lies that 
you are hearing in this room tonight. 
And the Members who are repeating 
those lies should be ashamed of them-
selves. Their constituents should be 
ashamed of them. 
We know what is going to happen as 
soon as I walk away, what has hap-
pened all night tonight, what will con-
tinue to happen. They will take these 
same symbols, these same concepts, 
smuggle them into their arguments, 
and make the same arguments. I want 
people at home, anyone who is still 
watching, to know that these argu-
ments are not for them; they are for 
you. 
None of the evidence we wanted to 
discuss here tonight will change their 
opinions or what they are about to say. 
But you need to know that is not the 
end. It is not as if there is nothing we 
can do because of that. And if there 
was, I don’t think this Nation would 
have made it to almost 250 years. 
The fact is, Madam Speaker, that at 
the end of the day, people— 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. 
GRIFFITH. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
point of order. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will 
state his point of order. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Yes, ma’am. The 
point of order would be that the gen-
tleman said that there were lies on this 
floor here today, looking over in this 
direction. I ask that those words be 
taken down. 
We may have a disagreement on mat-
ters, but— 
The SPEAKER. 
The gentleman’s demand is not time-
ly. 
The gentleman from Pennsylvania 
will proceed. 
Mr. LAMB. Madam Speaker, the fact 
is, at the end of the day, it hurts. It 
hurts them; it hurts this country. It 
hurts all of us. But the fact is that the 
people have made this country work by 
not giving in. 
Go ahead. Shout it out. 
One last thing to say, Madam Speak-
er. And I thank you for your patience. 
All people need to know tonight, 
Madam Speaker— 
Madam Speaker, the truth hurts. But 
the fact is this: We want this govern-
ment to work more than they want it 
to fail. 
After everything that has happened 
today, we want that more than ever. 
Know that. Know that, the people 
watching at home. We want this gov-
ernment to work. We will make it 
work. They will not make it fail. 
PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, par-
liamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman will 
state his parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. PERRY. When is the appropriate 
time to ask that the words be stricken, 
be taken down? 
The SPEAKER. Immediately after 
the words are uttered. 
For what purpose does the gentleman 
from Louisiana seek recognition? 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the objec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman is 
recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. HIGGINS of Louisiana. Madam 
Speaker, my, my, my. Let us take a 
deep breath, shall we? 
Madam Speaker, the cornerstone of 
the strength of our American Republic 
is not only the peaceful transition of 
power; it is the peaceful transition of a 
lawful power. It is within the param-
eters of our oath, indeed, is our duty to 
inquire if we suspect that perhaps our 
elections have been compromised. 
Much has been said about what we do 
not know. What we do not know calls 
for investigation. 
What we do know is that, in the dis-
puted States, Governors, secretaries of 
state, or local election commissions 
acted in violation of the Election 
Clause of the U.S. Constitution, where-
in State legislatures are granted the 
sole authority to determine how Presi-
dential electors are appointed. It is 
that simple. State executive officials 
usurped the constitutionally vested au-
thority of State legislatures within 
several of the sovereign States. 
Now, why we are involved in Con-
gress? Because the Founders gave us a

narrow role. If we suspect that an elec-
tion was compromised in a sovereign 
State, then we have a role in the seat-
ing of those electors and the counting. 
America is not a confederacy of 
States. We are a union of States. We 
are a representative republic. There-
fore, each sovereign State has a deep 
obligation to follow the writ of its own 
election law during a Federal election. 
We would not be having this con-
versation if our objections were solely 
rested upon the elections of sovereign 
State Governors or State senators and 
representatives. It is a Federal election 
for the President and Vice President of 
the United States. We certainly have a 
role, and we should investigate and 
support that role. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
America 
is 
an 
anointed nation, born of imperfect men 
driven by perfect intent. May we be 
worthy of what it is to be an American, 
what it is to be a representative of the 
American people. 
May I ask, may we seek the quiet 
whisper of God’s own voice within us. 
And I ask my colleagues to consider 
supporting this objection. 
I yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN 
DREW). 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, be-
fore I start, something I didn’t plan on 
saying. This is a debate. It is a discus-
sion. Everybody has a right to an opin-
ion. That is American. Because some-
one doesn’t agree with your view or 
your ideas does not mean that they are 
liars. It means they have a different 
view, a different opinion. 
And I think, for God’s sake, as people 
watch this or see it or hear it, they ex-
pect more from us than that. We can 
disagree at a certain level. There is 
nothing worse than moral pomposity. 
You know, today was an amazing and 
terrible day. But one thing that we do 
know is that our law enforcement pro-
tected lives, and they protected and 
preserved our democracy. I watched 
firsthand, as I always have, just as I do 
back home in south Jersey, these brave 
men and women put their lives on the 
line to defend all of us. 
May God bless the woman who lost 
her life today, and may God bless what 
will always be the greatest Nation in 
the history of the world: the United 
States of America. 
At the core of our country’s great-
ness is our democratic system of gov-
ernment. Without faith in the integrity 
of our elections, Americans will not 
have faith in our democracy. 
The United States of America is the 
international embodiment of freedom 
and opportunity, the shining city on a 
hill. Free and fair elections have al-
ways been a hallmark of America’s 
greatness. 
After this past Presidential election, 
approximately 60 million Americans 
have serious doubts about the outcome. 
That is a number that we cannot ig-
nore.

Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentlewoman

Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
started this day disheartened that our 
colleagues were going to drag us 
through this cynical political charade 
of objecting to duly certified electoral 
college votes, but I was ready and 
eager to defend Pennsylvania’s elec-
tions and the will of Pennsylvania’s 
voters. 
Never did I expect to be answering 
calls from family and friends concerned 
for my safety or to have to barricade 
myself in an office. But most impor-
tant of all, never did I expect to see our 
Capitol overrun by armed insurrection-
ists intent on disrupting our govern-
ment at the urging of the President. 
What happened here today has made 
me heart-sick for our country, but it 
only strengthens my resolve to uphold 
the rule of law and to protect the deci-
sion of Pennsylvania’s voters. 
Earlier this week, we raised our 
hands and swore an oath to bear true 
faith and allegiance to the Constitu-
tion of the United States. But, today, 
those who are blocking the counting of 
electors from Pennsylvania are show-
ing that their allegiance lies not to the 
Constitution or to their constituents, 
and many would argue not even to the 
Republican Party, but to their own po-
litical fortunes and the outgoing Presi-
dent. 
Pennsylvania’s voters, not Members 
of Congress, are tasked with choosing 
Pennsylvania’s Presidential electors, 
and particularly not congressmen from 
other States. The people have spoken, 
and Pennsylvania certified our elec-
tors. We must respect our oath here by 
rejecting this unfounded objection to 
Pennsylvania’s electoral votes, and not 
substitute Congress’ judgment for that 
of the people of Pennsylvania. 
Legal challenges to elections are se-
rious matters, and that is why there is 
a place to consider those challenges: In 
courtrooms before impartial judges. 
And Pennsylvania’s legal process has 
worked. The pseudo-legal arguments 
that are being raised by the objectors 
here today are not new. Over the past 
2 months, the President and his allies 
have filed more than 20 lawsuits to 
challenge the Pennsylvania election. 
Those challenges have been rejected in 
Federal courts, State courts, appellate 
courts, and the United States Supreme 
Court. Challenges have been rejected 
by judges who are registered Demo-
crats, Republicans, Independents, and 
who have been appointed by Demo-
cratic and Republican Presidents. 
And why did they lose all those 
cases? 
As Third Circuit Judge Bibas, a 
Trump appointee, wrote, ‘‘Free, fair 
elections are the lifeblood of our de-
mocracy. Charges of unfairness are se-
rious. But calling an election unfair 
does not make it so. Charges require 
specific allegations and then proof. We 
have neither here.’’ 
What the Court said points to an im-
portant distinction about when and 
how claims of election misconduct are 
made. It is easy to make wild claims of 
election fraud on cable television or 
Twitter, but those claims are not facts. 
And while there may be no immediate 
consequences for misleading the public 
with such statements, there is cer-
tainly a penalty for misleading the 
courts. 
A lawyer faces fines, jail, and loss of 
his or her license for making frivolous 
or false claims. The lawyers for the 
Trump campaign never alleged wide-
spread fraud or illegal voting had im-
pacted Pennsylvania’s elections be-
cause those claims are false. 
When our colleagues indulge in this 
political theatre and endorse fringe 
conspiracy theories, they may think 
there are no consequences because they 
know that this time the majorities of 
the House and Senate will overrule 
them. But as the entire world saw 
today, their baseless claims of election 
fraud do have consequences. They un-
dermine faith and respect for our elec-
tions and our government. They chip 
away at the foundation of our constitu-
tional Republic and they take a sledge-
hammer to the peaceful transfer of 
power. It is our job to respect the rule 
of law and reject this political charade. 
Finally, I want to offer my deepest 
respect to our Republican colleagues in 
both the House and the Senate who 
have withstood intense political pres-
sure, and today honor their oath in the 
rule of law by rejecting these un-
founded objections. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in favor of the objec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Texas is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I would first like to say to my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
who said we should be ashamed over 
here, I am not ashamed, and neither 
are my colleagues over here. We are ac-
tually proud of what we are doing and 
what we are standing for. So I hope the 
RECORD will show that. 
Yesterday’s cowardly attack on our 
American democracy was a horrible 
act. While Congress attempted to exe-
cute their constitutional duty to de-
bate and vote on this certification of 
the electoral college, violence inter-
rupted the proceedings in an attempt 
to stop the democratic process. 
Those who committed these acts are 
domestic terrorists and should be pros-
ecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 
And I thank the Capitol Police and all 
of the law enforcement organizations 
that pushed back against this mob. 
I can’t help but be reminded of the 
bravery during the baseball shooting 
on myself and my Republican col-
leagues in June of 2017. I thank God 
every day for their presence. 
The American people deserve full 
transparency in the electoral process, 
with confidence that any irregularities 
and inconsistencies in that process will 
be fully investigated. 
As a former Texas secretary of state, 
I know the electoral process well. And

above all, I know what the courts, the 
executive branch, and the elections of-
ficials can and cannot do without ap-
proval of the State legislature. During 
my tenure, I knew that my authority 
was confined to the powers the legisla-
ture provided me. If States fail to abide 
by the Constitution and follow their 
owns laws, it calls into question wheth-
er the votes in Texas, or any other 
State, are fairly represented. 
And now, as a duly elected Member of 
Congress, the Constitution outlines my 
rights to speak and voice my constitu-
ents’ concerns with my vote. It is piv-
otal that we have free and fair elec-
tions in our representative democracy 
and, more importantly, that we trust 
in the results of those elections. 
In no way is voicing an objection an 
attempt to overturn an election. And 
when this process is complete and all 
objections have been heard, I acknowl-
edge that we will have a peaceful trans-
fer of power on January 20. 
Faith in our system must be restored 
and Americans must be confident that 
their vote matters, and only lawful 
votes will be counted. This is a sad day 
in our Nation’s history, but a solemn 
reminder that our country will not fal-
ter and will not fail. In God we trust. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
CAWTHORN). 
Mr. CAWTHORN. Madam Speaker, as 
I said in my convention speech, I want 
a new generation of Americans to be 
radicals—to be radicals for freedom 
and for liberty, but not radicals for vio-
lence. I am bitterly disappointed by the 
protest that happened yesterday. The 
actions of a violent few were cowardly 
and pathetic, and I am not afraid to 
call it out. 
The Republican Party is a party of 
limited government. It is the big tent 
party. It is not the party of destruc-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, the oath I took just 
days ago demand that I speak out in 
defense not of one President or an-
other, but in defense of a hallowed doc-
ument that has safeguarded this Re-
public for over 200 years. The Constitu-
tion grants power solely to State legis-
latures to determine how elections are 
carried out. When other officials who 
are not vested with constitutional au-
thority usurp their role and grind the 
Constitution under their heel, I must 
object. 
b 0200 
Our Nation is a nation of resilience. 
In Valley Forge, George Washington 
prayed for a republic to be formed from 
the ashes of a monarchy. At Gettys-
burg, Americans gave their lives to de-
fend a very simple idea, that the Amer-
ican democracy that had been earned 
with the blood of their forefathers 
would not perish due to internal divi-
sion. 
Then, on the islands of Iwo Jima and 
Okinawa, American servicemen gave 
their lives to defend this Nation’s free-
dom from fascism. 
What unites each and every genera-
tion of Americans is the idea that 
those who submit themselves to the 
authority of government ought to have 
a voice in that same government. 
We are Americans here in this Cham-
ber and in this country. But what does 
it really mean to be an American? It 
means believing in the rule of law. It 
means speaking up in defense of our 
founding principles and in defense of 
the Constitution. 
Being an American means that you 
are proud of your country but that you 
never beat your chest. And being an 
American means that sometimes you 
must stand alone while others sit. 
Now, obviously, I can’t stand, but 
trust me, if I could stand, I would stand 
in defense of our Constitution today. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I rise in opposition. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I completely agree with my colleague 
Representative DWIGHT EVANS, and I 
remind this Chamber that Pennsyl-
vania is the cradle of American democ-
racy. 
We can’t claim to be the birthplace 
of American democracy. That would be 
a disservice to James Otis, Jr., who, in 
1761, stood up in a Massachusetts 
courtroom and argued against the 
King’s writs of assistance. 
But Pennsylvania is the cradle of de-
mocracy. It is where we hosted the 
signing of the Declaration of Independ-
ence and the American Constitution. 
It was Pennsylvanians who imme-
diately went to battle to defend this 
idea of democracy. They went right 
after Bunker Hill to the Siege of Bos-
ton. American riflemen were instru-
mental at the transformational Battles 
of Trenton and Saratoga in victory. 
And it is Independence Hall where 
these documents got signed, the Dec-
laration of Independence and the Con-
stitution. 
You heard my colleagues. You heard 
Representative 
HOULAHAN
talking 
about the privations at Valley Forge, 
all in support of creating democracy. 
You heard Representative BRENDAN 
F. BOYLE quoting John Adams, that de-
mocracy only dies by suicide. 
You 
heard 
Representative 
DEAN 
quoting John Lewis, our hero, who 
said: Democracy is not a state. It is an 
act. 
You heard Representative WILD talk-
ing about this stunning assault on our 
democracy. 
If it seems like we get a little prickly 
in Pennsylvania about assaulting de-
mocracy, you are right. We do. Penn-
sylvania is the cradle of democracy. 
You heard how foolish and empty 
these challenges are. Representative 
LAMB said it: 31 cameras filming the 
place where the count was happening, 
resulting in thousands of hours of vid-
eotape—you can see it on YouTube— 
proving there was no fraud. 
You heard Representatives MICHAEL 
F. DOYLE and BRENDAN F. BOYLE talk-
ing about Act 77, how the Republicans 
in Pennsylvania were falling all over 
themselves to pass this law for mail-in 
voting because they thought it would 
help them. 
You heard Representative SCANLON 
explaining why there were no allega-
tions of fraud made in court because a 
lawyer going into court and lying to 
the court gets his or her ticket to prac-
tice law punched. They can be dis-
barred. 
Politicians can say anything on cable 
TV, but they have to be darn careful 
when they are in court. So all these big 
TV talkers never alleged fraud in 
court. 
Let me tell you about one court case. 
It was a case where they brought on 
their best legal talent. It was a case 
where they drew as a judge a staunch, 
principled, 
conservative 
Republican, 
Judge Matthew Brann. He called this 
case ‘‘strained legal arguments without 
merit’’ and ‘‘speculative accusations.’’ 
He called it ‘‘like Frankenstein’s mon-
ster,’’ a ‘‘haphazardly stitched to-
gether’’ case. 
Judge Brann said he ‘‘has no author-
ity to take away the right to vote of 
even a single person, let alone millions 
of citizens.’’ 
On appeal Judge Bibas, a Trump ap-
pointee writing for the Third Circuit, 
agreed. He said: ‘‘Calling an election 
unfair does not make it so. Charges re-
quire specific allegations and then 
proof. We have neither here.’’ 
So, we have judges—dozens and doz-
ens of them, Federal judges, State 
judges, Democrats, Republicans—turn-
ing away these challenges. All they 
ever wanted was evidence. 
Here is the number-one rule when 
you go to court: Don’t forget to bring 
the evidence with you. 
This objection, in all seriousness, re-
flects the most profound disrespect to 
our American judiciary. We Pennsylva-
nians understand democracy. It was in 
Pennsylvania that our Founders signed 
the Constitution, and Article II makes 
it plain as day: We elect our President. 
We don’t have a king. 
If you can undo a Presidential elec-
tion simply by alleging that something 
was amiss, then we don’t have a democ-
racy at all. We have something else en-
tirely. 
And if we vote to sustain this objec-
tion, we are not upholding our Con-
stitution at all. We are doing some-
thing else entirely. 
Let’s vote ‘‘no’’ on this objection. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of this objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Ohio is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, 
every one of us swore an oath to sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States against all enemies, both 
foreign and domestic. I swore that oath 
in uniform, and the first part of that 
oath is the same as what we swear here 
in Congress. 
The last time we needed to defend 
our Constitution against a domestic

January 6, 2021 
enemy, we fought a civil war. And at 
the conclusion of that Civil War we 
passed the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amend-
ments that make clear that no State is 
so sovereign that they can deprive 
their citizens of equal protection of the 
laws. 
When it comes to elections, that 
means one person gets one vote. It 
doesn’t mean that other citizens can 
dilute the votes of other citizens and 
deprive them of equal protection. And 
it doesn’t mean that a State can do 
that by law or by practice. 
So whether the law was changed and 
made it such that there is no way to 
provide equal protection—one person, 
one vote—or the practice was cor-
rupted, it cannot stand. Frankly, last-
ly, it must guarantee that there is a 
proof that it was equal protection 
under the law. 
None of that happened in a number of 
States. The people of America, tens of 
millions of them who came out to vote, 
have been unheard by this body and by 
far too many courts. We need to show 
them the respect they are due by the 
Constitution of the United States of 
America, the Constitution that we 
fought to sustain to end the era of Jim 
Crow to pass civil rights legislation, 
the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights 
Act, and so many other pieces of juris-
prudence. 
Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. DAVIDSON. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Ohio. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman needs to maintain his position 
and control of the time. 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of this objec-
tion and to give voice to the 249,386 
men and women of Ohio’s Sixth Con-
gressional District who have had their 
voices silenced by the rogue political 
actors in Pennsylvania who unilater-
ally and unconstitutionally altered 
voting methods to benefit the Demo-
cratic candidate for President. 
Secretaries of state and State su-
preme courts cannot simply ignore the 
rules governing elections set forth in 
the Constitution. They cannot choose 
to usurp their state legislatures to 
achieve a partisan end, Constitution be 
damned. 
Madam Speaker, this is a sad day for 
America. We have seen too many sad 
days like this recently: assaults on 
courthouses, police stations, and now 
the U.S. Capitol. People who disagree 
with the results of police work and 
court decisions are wrong to respond 
violently. And people who disagree 
with the results of an election are also 
wrong to respond with violence. Thank 
you to the Capitol Police and all the 
law enforcement involved for pro-
tecting the people’s House today. 
Madam Speaker, some may question 
our motives for raising these objec-
tions, but other than the Bible, our 
Constitution is the most sacred docu-
ment known to man because it created 
the most free and prosperous nation in 
human history. 
b 0210 
2021 has the chance to be remembered 
for when the leaders of a deeply divided 
America came together to defend that 
sacred document and to ensure that 
the integrity of future Presidential 
elections is ensured. It is imperative 
we take this opportunity. The future of 
our Republic depends on it. 
Benjamin Franklin, in the summer of 
1787, during the heated debate to create 
our sacred Constitution, said these fa-
mous words: ‘‘I have lived long, sir, a 
long time . . . and the longer I live, the 
more convincing proofs I see of this 
truth . . . that God governs in the af-
fairs of men. 
‘‘And, if a sparrow cannot fall to the 
ground without His notice, is it prob-
able that an empire can rise without 
His aid? We have been assured, sir, in 
the sacred writing that ‘Except the 
Lord build it, they labor in vain that 
build it.’ ’’ 
Madam Speaker, I pray that we 
would turn to the God Almighty that 
ordained our Nation into being to help 
us in our time of need. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Illinois is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, as 
a student of foreign policy, if somebody 
described to me the actions that we 
saw, I would have assumed we were in 
a failed nation or a banana republic. 
Storming past police, some carrying 
the flag of the Confederacy, the mob 
breached this House. 
But there is good news: The democ-
racy held today. 
For the last few years, misinforma-
tion and fear has been fed into people 
for profit and power, and for too many 
years, leaders around the country said 
nothing and sometimes echoed those 
messages because of the belief that 
winning, no matter the cost, was worth 
everything. 
Today, we saw the result of ignoring 
these warning signs. 
People look to Washington to give 
hope. Instead, we simply amplify fears. 
People look to us for expertise on 
what can and can’t be possible. Some-
times it is easier to say what makes 
people feel good instead of the hard 
facts. 
Today, some Members of Congress 
argue that we can unilaterally pick the 
next President, that with our glorious 
wisdom, armed with Twitter, we know 
better than the American people. Some 
have shown that, if conspiracies are re-
peated enough, they become facts and 
they aren’t disputed. 
Even here in this Chamber after the 
events today, some speeches have been 
shockingly tone-deaf. I have seen peo-
ple applaud cheap political lines that 
are embarrassing. 
Power and cultural fights have di-
vided us so much that they are the ul-
timate goal now, and sometimes the 
oath we swear to uphold feels like a 
prop. 
People have been lied to by too many 
for too long. 
So here is the truth: Joe Biden won 
this election, the effort will fail, and 
everybody knows it. 
For some out there, this isn’t about 
making a statement for the betterment 
of our country; it is about avoiding the 
pain of leveling with the people and 
telling them the truth: the emperor 
has no clothes. 
I know many are disappointed in the 
result, but what legacy are we leaving? 
Have our kids seen the day where Ron-
ald Reagan and Tip O’Neill had a beer 
over their differences, or have they 
learned that to lead, you must tweet, 
and sometimes all in caps, because now 
this is Hollywood, fame is the ultimate 
goal? 
But the first step that we can take to 
restore this is to reject the charade, 
and what happens next is up to us. 
We get threatened with primaries; we 
worry about the political implications. 
But our names will long be forgotten; 
the legacy of now will exist. 
The bottom line: If we ask men and 
women to be willing to give their lives 
for this Nation and we talk about their 
service 
with 
tears 
in 
our 
eyes, 
shouldn’t we be willing to give up our 
jobs to uphold that Constitution? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Washington (Ms. HER-
RERA BEUTLER). 
Ms. HERRERA BEUTLER. Madam 
Speaker, is this a country, is this an 
America that we want to give to our 
children, a country of lawlessness, of 
might makes right, of mob rule? 
Previous generations of Americans 
have laid down their lives to answer 
‘‘no’’ to that question. I do not want to 
be the first generation of Americans so 
selfish as to answer ‘‘yes.’’ Nothing is 
more important to me than preserving 
this constitutional Republic as a Rep-
resentative. 
Article II of the Constitution states: 
‘‘Each State shall appoint, in such 
manner as the legislature thereof may 
direct, a number of electors,’’ meaning 
that it is the duty of the State legisla-
tures to select their electors in a man-
ner they stipulate. It is right here. 
The Founders of our Republic did not 
want to federalize elections, which is 
why they reserved the selection of elec-
tors to the State legislatures. 
Historically, when Congress inter-
vened in the electoral process, it was in 
the Civil War. It was when States were 
sending multiple slates of electors. But 
that is not the case today. 
Of the six States actively being con-
tested, five have Republican legisla-
tures; five are controlled by one party; 
five have the authority to get together 
and to vote to change the elector that 
they sent to us. 
How many of the six did? Not one. 
Pennsylvania did not get together 
and vote as a body and send us a new 
slate of electors. They did not send us 
a bill or a resolution citing injustice at 
the State level. 
None of them. 
Are they cowards? Do they not know 
the Constitution? Have they not read

it, like you and I? Or are they merely 
passing the buck? 
Here is the reality. Look, I believe 
this was not a fraud-free election. I be-
lieve that there were problems in Penn-
sylvania and in Georgia. But the Con-
stitution gives us the right to fix that 
at the State level, not throw out the 
electoral college. We do not want to ab-
solve the responsibility of the people in 
those States to hold their own law-
makers accountable. 
I, as a Washington State Congress-
woman, don’t know better than the 
people in Pennsylvania and Georgia. 
Folks, we can’t vote to undermine 
the electoral college today. We have to 
uphold it. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the objection. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
Florida is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, as you 
have heard from both sides of the aisle 
over and over and over today and to-
night, Members of Congress take an 
oath to protect and defend the Con-
stitution. 
Clearly, the Constitution says State 
legislatures make voting laws, period, 
end of subject. And, clearly, in Penn-
sylvania and some other States, non-
legislators changed those voting laws. 
No matter who wins or who loses, 
those are violations of the Constitution 
whether you, me, or anyone else likes 
it or not. 
As Congressman DAVIDSON
pointed 
out, over a dozen FBI agents were im-
mediately dispatched to fully inves-
tigate Bubba Wallace’s garage door. 
But, sadly, the FBI never responded to 
my request to investigate massive vot-
ing irregularity accusations, like the 
video footage from Georgia that we all 
wished we didn’t see. 
Neither has the Department of Home-
land 
Security, 
the 
Department 
of 
State, the Postal Inspector General, 
the Director of National Intelligence, 
the CIA, and, saddest of all, the U.S. 
Department of Justice. 
The right to vote is not only a con-
stitutional right, it is also a civil right, 
and we must protect it. Running a fair 
and transparent election is not some-
thing America should run away from. 
It is something we must live up to. 
Every eligible American has a right 
to have their vote counted and the 
right to feel confident that his or her 
vote was counted, not neutralized by 
an illegal vote. 
b 0220 
Otherwise, I fear our Republic is 
doomed. That is why I implore you to 
support a full investigation. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance 
of my time to the fine gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. KELLY). 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, this has been an interesting 
day. And I know we want to debate 
this, and we brought up all kinds of 
things, all kinds of points of history 
and what happened and where it hap-
pened and all the rest of this, and we 
are very, very grateful to the Capitol 
Police and all those who came in to 
protect us. 
But the real debate right now about 
Pennsylvania is Pennsylvania’s Act 77. 
Was it constitutional or was it uncon-
stitutional? All the rest of the trim-
mings you can set aside and just de-
cide: Was it constitutional or unconsti-
tutional? 
Act 77 changed Pennsylvania’s voting 
law and Pennsylvania’s Constitution. 
Now, Pennsylvania could change that 
law, but it is done through an amend-
ment to the constitution. It is not just 
done because somebody would like to 
see that done. 
We had a mail ballot that was avail-
able. It was an absentee ballot. We did 
not have a no-excuse ballot. 
What did Pennsylvania have to do to 
get to the point where they would have 
a no-excuse mail-in ballot? 
Number one, in two successive ses-
sions of the Pennsylvania Legislature, 
that had to be passed in that legisla-
tion, one session after the other. If it 
passed both times, then it had to be 
published in every one of the 67 coun-
ties of Pennsylvania, twice. When that 
was finished, it then had to go before 
the Pennsylvania voters to decide 
whether they wanted the constitution 
amended. 
Pennsylvania did the first one. They 
actually did take a vote, and it was 
overwhelming. But then they scrapped 
it, and they put it in an omnibus bill. 
That is an unconstitutional change. 
You cannot do it. It is that simple. 
So I love the idea about Washington 
crossing the Delaware. I love the idea 
about Washington going through a ter-
rible winter. 
I hate the idea of what we had to go 
through today. But if oaths don’t mat-
ter, and we have all taken them, and if 
the Constitution doesn’t matter, why 
do we even do it? Why go through this 
charade that somehow we are really 
close friends, except when it comes to 
the really important things? 
We have driven this country apart 
through the people’s House, and we 
wonder what happened? 
The biggest loss on November 3 was 
not by Donald Trump; it was the faith 
and trust that the American people 
lost in this voting system because we 
have allowed it to happen. It is uncon-
stitutional. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
California is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, 80 
years ago today, Franklin Roosevelt 
delivered his third inaugural address. 
‘‘Every realist knows,’’ he said, ‘‘that 
the democratic way of life at this mo-
ment is being directly assailed in every 
part of the world—assailed either by 
arms, or by the secret spreading of poi-
sonous propaganda by those who would 
seek to destroy unity and promote dis-
cord in nations still at peace.’’ 
Today, the principal threat to our de-
mocracy comes from a different but 
also poisonous propaganda of those 
who seek to destroy our unity and pro-
mote discord. 
According to this propaganda, Amer-
ica cannot conduct a free or fair elec-
tion. Our elections are rigged and 
doomed. 
According to this propaganda, the 
voters can no longer decide who shall 
be President. The Congress must decide 
for them. 
At a time when our Nation faces an 
unprecedented health crisis, with thou-
sands dying every day, with Americans 
struggling to put food on the table and 
keep a roof over their head, who are we 
to say that the man America chose to 
lead us out of this calamity shall not 
take office? 
The coronavirus will claim more 
American lives than all of the casual-
ties in World War II. To meet that mo-
ment will require unity, not discord; 
will require an abiding faith in our 
country, in our democracy, in our gov-
ernment’s ability to function and pro-
vide for the needs of its citizens. 
The Members of this body cannot 
continue to challenge the merits of an 
election that was fairly conducted and 
overwhelmingly won by Joe Biden. It 
must stop. 
Look 
at 
the 
damage 
that 
was 
wrought in this House today, to this 
country today. Is that not enough? 
Roosevelt said: ‘‘This Nation has 
placed its destiny in the hands and 
heads and hearts of its millions of free 
men and women. . . . Our strength,’’ he 
concluded ‘‘is our unity of purpose.’’ 
Let us unite once again in defense of 
the greatest hope of freedom-loving 
people around the world, this precious 
democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. RASKIN). 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, the 
baseless attack on Pennsylvania and 
its electors brought to mind, for me, 
the great Tom Paine, the champion of 
popular democracy, who came over to 
America to fight with us in the Revolu-
tion against the king. He lived in 
Philadelphia, where he wrote ‘‘Com-
mon Sense’’ and ‘‘The Age of Reason.’’ 
And Paine said: In the monarchies, the 
king is the law; but in the democracies, 
the law will be king. 
When you think about it, the peace-
ful transfer of power is the central con-
dition of maintaining democracy under 
the rule of law. That is why the famous 
election of 1801 was such a big deal. 
When John Adams relinquished the 
Presidency to his passionate adversary 
and lifelong friend Thomas Jefferson, 
it was the first peaceful transition of 
power between democracies in a demo-
cratic republic in the history of the 
world. 
And he said, as he rode back to Mas-
sachusetts from Washington, Adams 
said that he did this because we are a 
government of laws and not of men. We 
will betray this principle if we trade a 
government of laws for a government 
of men or, even worse, a single man, or 
an impressionable and dangerous mob

intent on violent sedition and insurrec-
tion against our beloved democratic 
Republic. 
Here is Abraham Lincoln right before 
the war. At what point, then, is the ap-
proach of danger to be expected? I 
would answer, if it ever reaches us, it 
must spring up amongst us. It cannot 
come from abroad. If destruction be 
our lot, we must, ourselves, be its au-
thor and its finisher. 
Madam Speaker, my family suffered 
an unspeakable trauma on New Year’s 
Eve a week ago. But mine was not the 
only family to suffer such terrible pain 
in 2020. Hundreds of thousands of fami-
lies in America are still mourning 
their family members. Many families 
represented in the Congress are still 
mourning their family members who 
have been taken away from us by 
COVID–19, by the opioid crisis, by can-
cer, by gun violence, by the rising fa-
talities associated with the crisis in 
mental and emotional health. 
Enough, my beloved colleagues. It is 
time for America to heal. It is time for 
our families and communities to come 
together. Let us stop pouring salt in 
the wounds of America for no reason at 
all. Let us start healing our beloved 
land and our wonderful people. 
The SPEAKER. All time for debate 
has expired. 
The question is, Shall the objection 
submitted by the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY) and the Sen-
ator from Missouri (Mr. HAWLEY) be 
agreed to. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker announced that the noes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, on that I demand the yeas 
and nays. 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
3(s) of House Resolution 8, the yeas and 
nays are ordered. 
Members are reminded to vote when 
their group is called and to leave the 
Chamber after they have voted. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 138, nays

Ms. CLARKE of New York changed her 
vote from ‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ 
So the objection was not agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
The SPEAKER. The Clerk will now 
notify the Senate of the action of the 
House, informing that body that the 
House is now ready to proceed in joint 
session with the further counting of 
the electoral vote for the President and 
Vice President. 
FURTHER MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE 
A further message from the Senate 
by Ms. Byrd, one of its clerks, an-
nounced that the Secretary of the Sen-
ate shall inform the House of Rep-
resentatives that the Senate is ready 
to proceed in joint session with the fur-
ther counting of the electoral votes for 
President and Vice President. 
(By unanimous consent, Mr. HOYER 
was allowed to speak out of order.) 
HONORING SHUWANZA GOFF 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, this 
would not be the time I would have 
chosen, but it may be the last time 
that we are in session before the new 
administration comes in. 
We are losing an extraordinary young 
woman who has been with me for over 
a decade and who is our floor leader, 
our floor director. All of you know her. 
Her name is Shuwanza Goff, and she 
has been with me for a significant pe-
riod of time. 
Shuwanza is a wonderful person. And 
the problem with having wonderful, 
talented, good staff is that at an ad-
ministration change, they steal your 
people. It is just a terrible thing that 
happens. Two of my staff, Shuwanza 
Goff and Mariel Saez, will be going to 
the administration as well, and I have 
asked the administration to please do 
not take any more of my people. 
But Shuwanza Goff has just been ex-
traordinary. Those of you who have 
dealt with her understand how bright 
she is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H113 
January 6, 2021 
That is the bad news, Madam Speak-
er, that they have taken her. But the 
good news is, she is going to be the ad-
ministration’s representative to the 
House of Representatives, so we are 
going to see a lot of Shuwanza. I am 
sure she will be talking to both of us 
on both sides of the aisle and urging us 
to vote one way or the other or getting 
us information or doing all sorts of 
things that we might ask her to do and 
that she would want to do for us. 
I want to say, Madam Speaker, and I 
know you share my view, those of us 
who have had an opportunity to work 
closely 
with 
Shuwanza, 
I 
love 
Shuwanza Goff. She is just a wonderful 
spirit. She is smart. She knows the 
rules. She knows the floor. I think Mr. 
MCCARTHY’s and Mr. SCALISE’s staffs 
would say the same thing if I had given 
them any notice that we were going to 
do this, but I thought we had some 
time. 
Shuwanza, I really do want to thank 
you, and we wish you the best of luck. 
We know you are not going far. I know 
we are going to see a lot of you, but we 
wish you great success in everything 
you do. 
I tell my staff, Madam Speaker, that 
they can go off the payroll, but they 
cannot go off the staff. 
God bless, Shuwanza, and good luck. 
b 0322 
At 3:22 a.m., the Sergeant at Arms, 
Paul D. Irving, announced the Vice 
President and the Senate of the United 
States. 
The Senate entered the Hall of the 
House of Representatives, headed by 
the Vice President and the Secretary of 
the Senate, the Members and officers 
of the House rising to receive them. 
The Vice President took his seat as 
the Presiding Officer of the joint con-
vention of the two Houses, the Speaker 
of the House occupying the chair on his 
left. Senators took seats to the right of 
the rostrum as prescribed by law. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The joint 
session of Congress to count the elec-
toral vote will resume. The tellers will 
take their chairs. 
The two Houses retired to consider 
separately and decide upon the vote of 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to 
which an objection has been filed. 
The Secretary of the Senate will re-
port the action of the Senate. 
The Secretary of the Senate read the 
order of the Senate, as follows: 
Ordered, That the Senate by a vote of 7 
ayes to 92 nays rejects the objection to the 
electoral votes cast in the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania for Joseph R. Biden, Jr., for 
President and KAMALA D. HARRIS for Vice 
President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Clerk of 
the House will report the action of the 
House. 
The Clerk of the House read the order 
of the House, as follows: 
Ordered, That the House of Representatives 
rejects the objection to the electoral vote of 
the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Pursuant to 
the law, chapter 1 of title 3, United 
States Code, because the two Houses 
have not sustained the objection, the 
original certificate submitted by the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania will be 
counted as provided therein. 
The tellers will now record and an-
nounce the vote of the State of Rhode 
Island for President and Vice President 
in accordance with the action of the 
two Houses. 
This certificate from Rhode Island, 
the Parliamentarians have advised me, 
is the only certificate of vote from that 
State that purports to be a return from 
the State and that has annexed to it a 
certificate from an authority of that 
State purporting to appoint and ascer-
tain electors.

fornia received 4 votes for Vice Presi-

cate of the vote of the Commonwealth 
of Virginia that the teller has verified 
as appearing regular in form and au-
thentic? 
There was no objection. 
The 
VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
Hearing 
none, this certificate from Washington, 
the Parliamentarians have advised, is 
the only certificate of vote from that 
State that purports to be a return from 
the State and that has a certificate of 
an authority from the same State pur-
porting to appoint or ascertain elec-
tors. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. Mr. Presi-
dent, the certificate of the electoral 
vote of the State of Washington seems 
to be regular in form and authentic, 
and it appears therefrom that Joseph 
R. Biden, Jr., of the State of Delaware 
received 12 votes for President and 
KAMALA D. HARRIS of the State of Cali-
fornia received 12 votes for Vice Presi-
dent. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there 
any objections to counting the certifi-
cate of the vote of the State of Wash-
ington that the teller has verified and 
appears to be regular in form and au-
thentic? 
There was no objection. 
The 
VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
Hearing 
none, this certificate from West Vir-
ginia, the Parliamentarians have ad-
vised, is the only certificate of vote 
from that State that purports to be a 
return from the State and that has an-
nexed to it a certificate of an authority 
from the State purporting to appoint 
or ascertain electors. 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of ILLINOIS. 
Mr. President, the certificate of the 
electoral vote of the State of West Vir-
ginia seems to be regular in form and 
authentic, and it appears therefrom 
that Donald J. Trump of the State of 
Florida received 5 votes for President 
and MICHAEL R. PENCE of the State of 
Indiana received 5 votes for Vice Presi-
dent. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there 
any objections to counting the certifi-
cate of the vote for the State of West 
Virginia that the teller has verified ap-
pears to be regular in form and authen-
tic? 
There was no objection. 
The 
VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
Hearing 
none, this certificate from Wisconsin, 
the Parliamentarians have advised, is 
the only certificate from that State 
that purports to be a return from the 
State and that has annexed to it a cer-
tificate of an authority from the State 
purporting to appoint or ascertain elec-
tors. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. President, the 
certificate of the electoral vote of the 
State of Wisconsin seems to be regular 
in form and authentic, and it appears 
therefrom that Joseph R. Biden, Jr., of 
the State of Delaware received 10 votes 
for President and KAMALA D. HARRIS of 
the State of California received 10 
votes for Vice President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. For what 
purpose does the gentleman from Texas 
rise? 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. President, I ob-
ject to the electoral votes of the State 
of Wisconsin because 71 House Mem-
bers, all of who condemn violence as we 
witnessed today, are firmly committed 
to the resolution of disagreements in 
civil, lawful, peaceful institutions with 
full and fair debate, free of violence. 
And though not a single court has al-
lowed an evidentiary hearing to listen 
to the significant body of evidence of 
fraud, and though some seize on the 
court’s failure to misrepresent that no 
court would listen to the evidence as 
saying evidence did not exist; while 
Democrat leaders in Milwaukee ille-
gally and unconstitutionally created 
more than 200 illegal polling places; 
tens 
of 
thousands 
of 
votes 
were 
changed by workers, despite election 
workers’ objections, plus so many 
other illegalities to fraudulently create 
a 20,000-vote lead, we object, along with 
a Senator who now has withdrawn his 
objection. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Sections 15 
and 17 of title 3 of the United States 
Code require that any objection be pre-
sented in writing, signed by a Member 
of the House of Representatives and a 
Senator. 
Is the objection in writing and signed 
by a Member and a Senator? 
Mr. GOHMERT. It is in writing. It is 
signed by a Member, but it is not 
signed and objected to by a Senator, 
Mr. President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. In that case, 
the objection cannot be entertained. 
This certificate from Wyoming, the 
Parliamentarians have advised, is the 
only certificate of vote from that State 
and purports to be a return from the 
State and has annexed to it the certifi-
cate of an authority from the same 
State purporting to appoint or ascer-
tain electors. 
Senator BLUNT. Mr. President, the 
certificate of the electoral vote of the 
State of Wyoming seems to be regular 
in form and authentic, and it appears 
therefrom that Donald J. Trump of the 
State of Florida received 3 votes for 
President and MICHAEL R. PENCE of the 
State of Indiana received 3 votes for 
Vice President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Are there 
any objections to counting a certifi-
cate of the vote of the State of Wyo-
ming that the teller has verified ap-
pears to be regular in form and authen-
tic? 
There was no objection. 
The 
VICE 
PRESIDENT. 
Hearing 
none, the Chair advises Members of 
Congress the certificates having been 
read, the tellers will ascertain and de-
liver the result to the President of the 
Senate. 
Senator KLOBUCHAR. The under-
signed, ROY
BLUNT
and AMY
KLO-
BUCHAR, tellers on the part of the Sen-
ate; ZOE LOFGREN and RODNEY DAVIS, 
tellers on the part of the House of Rep-

Chaplain BLACK. Lord of our lives 
and sovereign of our beloved Nation, 
we deplore the desecration of the 
United States Capitol Building, the 
shedding of innocent blood, the loss of 
life, and the quagmire of dysfunction 
that threaten our democracy. 
These tragedies have reminded us 
that words matter and that the power 
of life and death is in the tongue. We 
have been warned that eternal vigi-
lance continues to be freedom’s price. 
Lord, You have helped us remember 
that we need to see in each other a 
common humanity that reflects Your 
image. You have strengthened our re-
solve to protect and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States against 
all enemies domestic, as well as for-
eign. 
Use us to bring healing and unity to 
a hurting and divided Nation and 
world. Thank You for what You have 
blessed our lawmakers to accomplish 
in spite of threats to liberty. 
Bless and keep us. Drive far from us 
all wrong desires, incline our hearts to 
do Your will, and guide our feet on the 
path of peace. And God bless America. 
We pray in Your sovereign name. 
Amen.

The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority

f 
CHALLENGE TO THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, we 
are debating a step that has never been 
taken in American history: whether 
Congress should overrule the voters 
and overturn a Presidential election. 
I have served 36 years in the Senate. 
This will be the most important vote I 
have ever cast. 
President Trump claims the election 
was stolen. The assertions range from 
specific local allegations, to constitu-
tional arguments, to sweeping con-
spiracy theories. I supported the Presi-
dent’s right to use the legal system. 
Dozens of lawsuits received hearings in 
courtrooms all across our country, but 
over and over, courts rejected these 
claims, including all-star judges whom 
the President himself nominated. 
Every election, we know, features 
some illegality and irregularity, and, 
of course, that is unacceptable. 
I support strong State-led voting re-
forms. Last year’s bizarre pandemic 
procedures must not become the new 
norm. But, my colleagues, nothing be-
fore us proves illegality anywhere near 
the massive scale—the massive scale 
that would have tipped the entire elec-
tion, nor can public doubt alone justify 
a radical break when the doubt itself 
was incited without any evidence. 
The Constitution gives us here in 
Congress a limited role. We cannot 
simply declare ourselves a national 
board of elections on steroids. The vot-
ers, the courts, and the States have all 
spoken. They have all spoken. If we 
overrule them, it would damage our 
Republic forever. 
This election actually was not unusu-
ally close. Just in recent history, 1976, 
2000, and 2004 were all closer than this 
one. The electoral college margin is al-
most identical to what it was in 2016. If 
this election were overturned by mere 
allegations from the losing side, our 
democracy would enter a death spiral. 
We would never see the whole Nation 
accept an election again. Every 4 years 
would be a scramble for power at any 
cost. The electoral college, which most 
of us on this side been have defending 
for years, would cease to exist, leaving 
many of our States with no real say at 
all in choosing a President. 
The effects would go even beyond the 
elections themselves. Self-government, 
my colleagues, requires a shared com-
mitment to the truth and a shared re-
spect for the ground rules of our sys-
tem. We cannot keep drifting apart 
into two separate tribes with a sepa-
rate set of facts and separate realities 
with nothing in common except our 
hostility toward each other and mis-
trust for the few national institutions 
that we all still share. 
Every time—every time in the last 30 
years that Democrats have lost a Pres-
idential race, they have tried a chal-
lenge just like this—after 2000, after 
2004, and after 2016. After 2004, a Sen-
ator joined and forced the same debate. 
And, believe it or not, Democrats like 
Harry Reid, DICK DURBIN, and Hillary 
Clinton praised—praised and applauded 
the 
stunt. 
Republicans 
condemned 
those baseless efforts back then, and 
we just spent 4 years condemning 
Democrats’ shameful attacks on the 
validity of President Trump’s own elec-
tion. So there can be no double stand-
ard. The media that is outraged today 
spent 4 years aiding and abetting the 
Democrats’ attacks on our institutions 
after they lost. 
But we must not imitate and escalate 
what we repudiate. Our duty is to gov-
ern for the public good. The United 
States Senate has a higher calling than 
an endless spiral of partisan vengeance. 
Congress will either overrule the vot-
ers, the States, and the courts for the 
first time ever or honor the people’s de-
cision. We will either guarantee Demo-
crats’ delegitimizing efforts after 2016 
became a permanent new routine for 
both sides or declare that our Nation 
deserves a lot better than this. We will 
either hasten down a poisonous path 
where only the winners of elections ac-
tually accept the results or show we 
can still muster the patriotic courage 
that our forebears showed not only in 
victory but in defeat. 
The Framers built the Senate to stop 
short-term passions from boiling over 
and melting the foundations of our Re-
public. So I believe protecting our con-
stitutional order requires respecting 
the limits of our own power. It would 
be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise 
American voters and overrule the 
courts and the States on this extraor-
dinarily thin basis, and I will not pre-
tend such a vote would be a harmless 
protest gesture while relying on others 
to do the right thing. I will vote to re-
spect the people’s decision and defend 
our system of government as we know 
it. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
f 
CHALLENGE TO THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Vice President, 
as prescribed by the Constitution and 
the laws of the Nation, the purpose of 
this joint session is for tellers, ap-
pointed on a bipartisan basis by the 
two Houses, to read to the Congress the 
results of an election that has already 
happened. We are here to receive an an-
nouncement of a vote that has already 
been certified by every State in the 
Union and confirmed by the courts 
many times—many times over. We are 
here to watch the current Vice Presi-
dent open envelopes and receive the 
news of a verdict that has already been 
rendered. It is a solemn and august oc-
casion, no doubt, but it is a formality. 
The Congress does not determine the 
outcome of elections; the people do. 
The Congress is not endowed with the 
power to administer elections; our 
States are given that power. 
By the end of the proceedings today, 
there will be confirmed once again 
something that is well known and well 
settled: The American people elected 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS to be 
the next President and Vice President 
of the United States. Yet a number of 
our colleagues have organized an effort 
to undermine and object to that free 
and fair election. They are in the mi-
nority. They will lose; they know that. 
They have no evidence of widespread 
voter fraud upon which to base their 
objections. That is because there is 
none. There is none, not brought before 
any of the courts successfully. 
They know that President Trump 
and his allies have suffered a defeat in 
court after court across the country, 
losing no fewer than 62 legal chal-
lenges. And, I might add, many Repub-
lican-appointed 
judges—some 
ap-
pointed by President Trump—rendered 
those decisions. 
They know—you all know—that Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS are going to 
be sworn in as President and Vice 
President of the United States on Jan-
uary 20, but they are going to object to 
the counting of the vote anyway, and 
in the process, they will embarrass 
themselves, they will embarrass their 
party, and worst of all, they will em-
barrass their country. 
This insurrection was fortunately 
discouraged by the leadership of the 
majority party, but it was not quelled.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S15 
January 6, 2021 
It is a very sad comment on our times 
that merely accepting the results of an 
election is considered an act of polit-
ical courage. Sadder and more dan-
gerous still is the fact that an element 
of the Republican Party believes their 
political viability hinges on the en-
dorsement of an attempted coup, that 
anyone—much less an elected official— 
would be willing to tarnish our democ-
racy in order to burnish their personal 
political fortunes. 
Over the course of the afternoon and 
however far into the evening this band 
of Republic objectors wants to take us, 
Senators of good will from both sides of 
the aisle will explain why these chal-
lenges must be dismissed. The Senators 
from States whose electoral votes are 
being challenged will explain how the 
allegations of fraud are baseless. And a 
substantial bipartisan majority must 
vote to put down these objections and 
defend the sanctity of our elections and 
indeed—and 
indeed—our 
great 
and 
grand democracy because that is what 
we are talking about today: the health 
of power democracy, this wonderful, 
beautiful, grand democracy where the 
peaceful 
passing 
of 
the 
torch 
is 
extolled by schoolchildren in the sec-
ond grade but not by some here. 
As we speak, half of our voters are 
being conditioned by the outgoing 
President to believe that when his 
party loses an election, the results 
must not be legitimate. 
As we speak, the eyes of the world 
are 
on 
this 
Chamber, 
questioning 
whether America is still the shining 
example of democracy, the shining city 
on the Hill. 
What message will we send today to 
our people, to the world that has so 
looked up to us for centuries? What 
message will we send to fledgling de-
mocracies who study our Constitution, 
mirror our laws and traditions in the 
hopes that they, too, can build a coun-
try ruled by the consent of the gov-
erned? 
What message will we send to those 
countries where democratic values are 
under assault and look to us to see if 
those values are still worth fighting 
for? 
What message will we send to every 
dark corner of the world where human 
rights are betrayed, elections are sto-
len, human dignity denied? 
What will we show those people? Will 
we show those people that there is a 
better way to ensure liberty and oppor-
tunity of humankind? 
Sadly, a small band of Republican ob-
jectors may darken the view of our de-
mocracy today, but a larger group of 
Senators and House Members from 
both sides of the aisle can send a mes-
sage, too; that democracy beats deep in 
the hearts of our citizens and our elect-
ed representatives; that we are a coun-
try of laws and of not men; that our 
traditions are not so easily discarded, 
even by our President; that facts mat-
ter; that truth matters; that while de-
mocracy allows free speech and free ex-
pression, even if that expression is 
antidemocratic, there will always, al-
ways be—praise God—a far broader and 
stronger coalition ready to push back 
and defend everything we hold dear. 
We can send that message today by 
voting in large and overwhelming num-
bers to defeat these objections. My col-
leagues, we each swore an oath just 3 
days ago that we would defend and sup-
port the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and 
domestic; that we would bear true faith 
and allegiance to the same. 
We swore that we took this obliga-
tion freely, without any mental res-
ervation or purpose of evasion, and 
that we could well and faithfully dis-
charge the duties of the office we were 
about to enter, so help us God. 
The precise words of that oath were 
shortly written after the Civil War, 
when the idea of true faith and alle-
giance to this country and its Con-
stitution took on enormous meaning. 
Let those words ring in the ears of 
every Senator today. Let us do our 
duty to support and defend the Con-
stitution of the United States, so help 
us God. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator 
from Texas, Senator CRUZ. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, we gather 
together at a moment of great division, 
at a moment of great passion. We have 
seen and, no doubt, will continue to see 
a great deal of moralizing from both 
sides of the aisle, but I would urge to 
both sides perhaps a bit less certitude 
and a bit more recognition that we are 
gathered at a time when democracy is 
in crisis. 
Recent polling shows that 39 percent 
of Americans believe the election that 
just occurred ‘‘was rigged.’’ You may 
not agree with that assessment, but it 
is, nonetheless, a reality for nearly half 
the country. 
I would note it is not just Repub-
licans who believe that. Thirty-one 
percent of Independents agree with 
that statement. Seventeen percent of 
Democrats believe the election was 
rigged. Even if you do not share that 
conviction, it is the responsibility, I 
believe, of this office to acknowledge 
that is a profound threat to this coun-
try and to the legitimacy of any ad-
ministrations that will come in the fu-
ture. 
I want to take a moment to speak to 
my Democratic colleagues. I under-
stand. Your guy is winning right now. 
If Democrats vote as a bloc, Joe Biden 
will almost certainly be certified as 
the next President of the United 
States. 
I want to speak to the Republicans 
who are considering voting against 
these objections. I understand your 
concerns, but I urge you to pause and 
think: What does it say to the nearly 
half the country that believes this elec-
tion was rigged if we vote not even to 
consider the claims of illegality and 
fraud in this election? 
And I believe there is a better way. 
The leaders just spoke about setting 
aside the election. Let me be clear. I 
am not arguing for setting aside the re-
sult of this election. All of us are faced 
with two choices, both of which are 
lousy. One choice is vote against the 
objection, and tens of millions of 
Americans will see a vote against the 
objection as a statement that voter 
fraud doesn’t matter, isn’t real, and 
shouldn’t be taken seriously. And a 
great many of us don’t believe that. 
On the other hand, most, if not all, of 
us believe we should not set aside the 
results of an election just because our 
candidate may not have prevailed. So I 
endeavored to look for door No. 3, a 
third option, and for that I looked to 
history, to the precedent of the 1876 
election, the Hayes-Tilden election, 
where this Congress appointed an elec-
toral commission to examine claims of 
voter fraud. 
Five House Members, five Senators, 
five Supreme Court Justices examined 
the evidence and rendered a judgment. 
What I would urge of this body is that 
we do the same; that we appoint an 
electoral commission to conduct a 10- 
day emergency audit, consider the evi-
dence, and resolve the claims. 
For those in the Democratic aisle 
who say there is no evidence, they have 
been rejected, then you should rest in 
comfort. If that is the case, an elec-
toral commission would reject those 
claims. 
But for those who respect the voters, 
simply telling the voters, ‘‘Go jump in 
a lake; the fact that you have deep con-
cerns is of no moment to us,’’ that 
jeopardizes, I believe, the legitimacy of 
this and subsequent elections. 
The Constitution gives to Congress 
the responsibility this day to count the 
votes. The Framers knew what they 
were doing when they gave responsibil-
ities to Congress. We have a responsi-
bility, and I would urge that we follow 
the precedent of 1877. The Electoral 
Count Act explicitly allows objections 
such as this one for votes that were not 
regularly given. 
Let me be clear. This objection is for 
the State of Arizona, but it is broader 
than that. It is an objection for all six 
of the contested States to have a cred-
ible, objective, impartial body hear the 
evidence and make a conclusive deter-
mination. That would benefit both 
sides. That would improve the legit-
imacy of this election. 
So let me urge my colleagues: All of 
us take our responsibility seriously. I 
would urge my colleagues: Don’t take, 
perhaps, the easy path, but, instead, 
act together. Astonish the viewers and 
act in a bipartisan sense to say we will 
have a credible and fair tribunal, con-
sider the claims, consider the facts, 
consider the evidence, and make a con-
clusive determination whether and to 
what extent this election complied 
with the Constitution and with Federal 
law.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S16 
January 6, 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Senator KLOBUCHAR. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I 
first would like to say I appreciate the 
words of our leader, Senator SCHUMER, 
as well as Senator MCCONNELL’s call 
for a higher calling. 
January 6 is not typically a day of 
historical significance for our country. 
For centuries, this day is simply the 
day that we receive each State’s cer-
tified electoral votes, and it has come 
and gone without much fanfare. 
In fact, this is only the third time in 
120 years that the Senate has gathered 
to debate an objection, and as Senator 
CRUZ well knows, both times these ob-
jections were resoundingly defeated. 
The last time the vote was 74 to 1. 
Why? Because Senators have long be-
lieved that they should not mess 
around with the will of the people. 
They have understood the words of our 
great former colleague John McCain 
from the State of Arizona, who once 
said that nothing in life is more liber-
ating than to fight for a cause larger 
than yourself. 
In this case, my colleagues, our 
cause, despite our political differences, 
is to preserve our American democ-
racy, to preserve our Republic because, 
as someone once said long ago, it is a 
republic if you can keep it. 
Now, I appreciate all my Democratic 
and Republican colleagues who have 
joined our ranks of coup fighters, who 
have stood up for our democracy, who 
stand tall for our Republic, and who be-
lieve in an ideal greater than ourselves, 
larger than our political parties. That 
ideal is America. 
And Senator CRUZ, he knows this: On 
January 20, Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS will be sworn in as President 
and Vice President of the United 
States. He knows that President-Elect 
Biden won more votes than any Presi-
dent in history and more than 7 million 
more votes than President Trump. 
Despite the unfounded conspiracy 
theories Senator CRUZ tells, he knows 
that high-ranking officials in President 
Trump’s own Homeland Security De-
partment have concluded that the 2020 
election was ‘‘the most secure in Amer-
ican history.’’ 
If he wants to improve the numbers 
in his own party that he just men-
tioned of people believing in our elec-
tions, maybe he should start con-
sulting with them or maybe he should 
start consulting with former Attorney 
General Barr, who said that he has 
found no evidence of widespread fraud 
in the 2020 election. 
We don’t have to go back to 1877, my 
colleagues. Senator CRUZ knows that 80 
judges, including conservative judges, 
including judges confirmed in this 
Chamber, 
nominated 
by 
President 
Trump, have thrown out these law-
suits, calling them baseless, inad-
equate, and contrary both to the plain 
meaning of the constitutional text and 
common sense. 
And he knows that all 10 living De-
fense Secretaries, including both of 
Trump’s 
Defense 
Secretaries—Dick 
Cheney, 
Donald 
Rumsfeld, 
William 
Cohen—he knows that all of these lead-
ers have come together to say that 
these scurrilous attacks on our democ-
racy must stop and we must allow for 
a peaceful transition of power. 
Senator SINEMA will fill you in on the 
specific facts as to why this election 
was sound and true in Arizona, but a 
summary: President Trump received 
1,661,686 votes in the State; President- 
Elect Biden won 1,672,143 votes, mean-
ing that he won the State by 10,457 
votes. 
On November 30, after Arizona’s Re-
publican Governor, the secretary of 
state, the attorney general, and the 
conservative chief justice of the Ari-
zona Supreme Court certified the re-
sults of the election, the Governor ac-
tually said: 
We do elections well here in Arizona. The 
system is strong. 
Eight postelection lawsuits brought 
in Arizona to challenge the results 
were dismissed by judges. Nine Mem-
bers of the House from Arizona were 
elected in the same election, including 
four Republicans. Colleagues, I did not 
see Senator CRUZ over at the swearing- 
in at the House of Representatives last 
Sunday asking for an audit. He did not 
stop their swearing-in because there 
was no fraud, and he did not ask for an 
audit because we had a fair election. 
I will end with this. My friend ROY 
BLUNT, my fellow Rules Committee 
leader, many years ago found a statue, 
a bust of a man at the top of a book-
case. He did research. He went to the 
historians. All he could find out was 
that no one knew who this guy was ex-
cept that he was a cleric. Hence, the 
statue is called ‘‘The Unknown Cleric.’’ 
Now, at the time, our leaders thought 
this man important enough that they 
would warrant a statue for him, but 
today no one knows who he is. Senator 
BLUNT’s message to schoolkids and 
Senators alike that visit his office, 
when he shows them the statue: What 
we do here is more important than who 
we are. 
Senators, what matters is not our fu-
tures, not our own short-term des-
tinies. 
What matters is our democracy’s des-
tiny because I think many of us know 
people will not know who we are 100 
years from now or 200 years from now, 
but what they will know is this: They 
will know what we did today, how we 
voted today. That is more important 
than who we are. It is a Republic, if we 
can keep it. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I yield up to 5 
minutes to the Senator from Pennsyl-
vania, Senator TOOMEY. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. I intend later to ad-
dress the specifics of Pennsylvania if 
and when an objection is raised in re-
gard to Pennsylvania. 
For now, I want to address my re-
marks to what I think is the funda-
mental question being posed by the ob-
jectors, and that is, does Congress have 
the constitutional authority to decide 
which States’ electoral college votes 
should be counted and which should 
not based on how well we think they 
ran their elections? This is what the 
objectors are really asking us to do—to 
federalize elections by rejecting elec-
toral college votes from States whose 
processes they say they disapprove of 
and thereby having Congress select the 
President of the United States instead 
of the American people. 
The answer, Mr. President, is no, 
there is no such authority under the 
Constitution. The Constitution assigns 
to the States the responsibility to con-
duct elections. It is clear in article II, 
section 1. It leaves courts with the re-
sponsibility to adjudicate disputes, and 
it assigns to Congress the ministerial 
function of counting ballots, except for 
extreme circumstances, such as when a 
State sends competing slates of elec-
tors to Congress, which brings me to 
the 1877 President. 
Some objectors claim to merely want 
a commission to conduct an audit and 
then let States decide whether to send 
electors. Well, first, the situations are 
not at all analogous. 
In 1877, Congress had before it two 
slates of electors from several States. 
There are no Trump electors from 
swing States; there are just Biden elec-
tors. 
Second, legislators from the swing 
States—they 
have 
already 
spoken. 
They have made their decision. They 
have chosen not to send us alternative 
electors. 
Third, a commission—really? It is 
completely impractical, and we all 
know it, with 14 days to go before a 
constitutionally mandated inaugura-
tion. 
Look at it this way: If the electors 
are right and it is Congress’s job to sit 
in judgment on the worthiness of the 
States’ electoral processes, what is the 
criteria for acceptable electoral proc-
esses? What investigations have been 
conducted of these processes? What 
body has deemed that certain States’ 
processes are unacceptable? What op-
portunities were these States given to 
challenge the findings? Why are the ob-
jectors objecting only to swing States 
that President Trump lost? What about 
the ones he won? I don’t know—North 
Carolina? What about California? They 
have ballot harvesting, I am told. If 
this is all supposed to be Congress’s 
job, you would think we would have an-
swers to these questions and proce-
dures in place because we would have 
done this every 4 years, right? But we 
don’t because it is not our job. 
If we adopt this new precedent that 
we sit in judgment of States’ processes, 
then we are federalizing the election 
law. We would necessarily have to es-
tablish the permissible criteria and 
rules for the States’ elections. 
The ballot harvesting example—it is 
illegal in some States; it is encouraged

January 6, 2021 
in others. Does it become mandatory or 
forbidden depending on who is in con-
trol of Congress? And, as the leader 
pointed out, it would be the end of the 
electoral college. The electoral college 
is the mechanism by which the people 
select the President. But if Congress 
gets to decide which States get to vote 
in the electoral college, then clearly 
Congress is electing the President, not 
the people. Whichever party controls 
both Houses of Congress would control 
the Presidency. 
The public would never tolerate Con-
gress picking the President instead of 
themselves, so they would abolish the 
electoral college, as many of our col-
leagues would like to do, and the end of 
the electoral college, of course, means 
the Nation will be governed by a hand-
ful of big blue States and regions that 
can drum up very large numbers. 
Mr. President, the Constitution does 
not assign to Congress the responsi-
bility to judge the worthiness of State 
election processes nor its adherence to 
its rules. That is the responsibility of 
the States and the courts. 
Let me conclude with this. I voted 
for President Trump. I publicly en-
dorsed President Trump. I campaigned 
for President Trump. I did not want 
Joe Biden to win this election. There is 
something more important to me than 
having my preferred candidate sworn 
in as the next President, and that is to 
have the American people’s chosen can-
didate sworn in as the next President. 
A fundamental defining feature of a 
democratic republic is the right of the 
people to elect their own leaders. It is 
now our duty. It is our responsibility 
to ensure that right is respected in this 
election and preserved for future elec-
tions. I urge you to vote against this 
objection. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Senator from the great State of Ari-
zona, Senator SINEMA. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Arizona. 
Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
I rise today to share the facts about 
Arizona’s recent election and to urge 
my colleagues to step away from divi-
sive political rhetoric and step towards 
renewing Americans’ faith in our de-
mocracy. 
The 2020 Arizona election was a suc-
cess, not for any one party or indi-
vidual but as a demonstration of the 
will of the voters. A record 80 percent 
of 
registered 
voters 
participated, 
thanks to local Arizona election offi-
cials who ensured our system worked 
and our laws were upheld. Arizona has 
offered early voting for more than 100 
years, and our vote-by-mail system in-
cludes strict safeguards. All ballots in-
clude tracking mechanisms and tam-
per-resistant envelopes. Election staff 
are trained to authentic signatures. 
And Arizona imposes severe criminal 
punishments for ballot tampering. 
The Arizona election produced bipar-
tisan results in which members of both 
parties won races, and these results 
have been confirmed by stakeholders 
across the political spectrum. 
The Republican chairman of the Mar-
icopa County Board of Supervisors 
said: 
No matter how you voted, this election 
was administered with integrity, trans-
parency, and . . . in accordance with Arizona 
State laws. 
The Republican speaker of the Ari-
zona State House rejected calls for the 
legislature to overturn the election, 
saying: 
As a conservative Republican, I don’t like 
the results of the presidential election . . . 
but I cannot and will not entertain a sugges-
tion that we violate current law to change 
the outcome. 
Eight challenges contesting the Ari-
zona election were brought to Federal 
and State courts. All eight were with-
drawn or dismissed, including a unani-
mous ruling by the Arizona Supreme 
Court. The chief justice wrote: 
[The] challenge fails to present any evi-
dence of ‘‘misconduct,’’ [or] ‘‘illegal votes’’ 
. . . let alone establish any degree of fraud or 
a sufficient error rate that would undermine 
the certainty of the election results. 
During a recent committee hearing, I 
asked a simple question of the former 
Director of Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security: Did he find any evi-
dence disputing the integrity or fair-
ness of Arizona’s election? His answer 
was simple: ‘‘No.’’ 
Arizona and our 15 counties should be 
congratulated for running a secure 
election. Perhaps the most heartening 
demonstration of Arizona’s election 
success 
is 
Jocelyn 
from 
Phoenix. 
Jocelyn is 18 years old and was a first- 
time voter in 2020. So was Rachel from 
Tucson and thousand more Arizonans 
who for the first time exercised their 
constitutional right to decide their 
own leaders. Today’s challenge to Ari-
zona’s election fails any factual anal-
ysis. More disturbingly, it seeks to rob 
Jocelyn and Rachel and more than 3 
million Arizonans of a free, fair elec-
tion. 
Those of us who are trusted with 
elected office are first and foremost 
public servants. We serve our constitu-
ents. We do not seek to substitute our 
personal ambitions for the will of the 
American people. Our system allows 
for a continuous contest of ideas. And 
those voters who support the losing 
side of a free, fair election have not 
been 
disenfranchised; 
rather, 
they 
maintain just as important a voice in 
America’s future. Leaders have a duty 
to serve all of our constituents, includ-
ing those who voted for other can-
didates. 
Great leaders in our history faced the 
choice of whether to take an action 
strengthening our democracy even if a 
different action would better serve 
their political ambitions. Many are re-
vered today because they chose our Re-
public over their self-interests, includ-
ing my personal hero, Senator John 
McCain. Following his Presidential 
loss, Senator McCain said: 
The American people have spoken . . . Sen-
ator Obama and I have . . . argued our dif-
ferences, and he has prevailed. . . . Whatever 
our differences, we are fellow Americans. 
He spoke to the nearly 60 million 
Americans who voted for him, saying: 
It is natural tonight to feel some dis-
appointment, but tomorrow we must move 
beyond it and work together to get our coun-
try moving again. 
Senator McCain was right. 
Today we have serious, significant 
work to do beating this pandemic and 
reviving our economy. I urge my col-
leagues to follow the example of Sen-
ator John McCain and so many others, 
reject this meritless challenge, and up-
hold the will of Arizona’s voters. 
Thank you. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator 
from Oklahoma, Senator LANKFORD. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, in 
America, we settle our differences in 
elections. What happens if you don’t 
trust the election count or you are con-
cerned that so many courts denied or 
dismissed cases within hours after they 
were given thousands of pages of evi-
dence? 
The reason we have a Congress to 
settle our Nation’s divisions and the 
rules of the Senate make sure that 
every opinion in the Nation is heard is 
so issues like this can be addressed. 
The constitutional crisis in our coun-
try right now is that millions of Amer-
icans are being told to sit down and 
shut up. Their opinions matter. 
During the electoral challenge on 
January 6, 2005, Senator Ted Kennedy 
stood on this floor and said this. He 
said: 
I commend the many thousands of citizens 
in Massachusetts and other States who in-
sisted that treating today’s electoral vote 
count in Congress as a meaningless ritual 
would be an insult to our democracy unless 
we register our own protest against the obvi-
ously-flawed voting process that took place 
in so many States. We are hopeful that this 
major issue that goes to the heart of our de-
mocracy is now firmly implanted on the 
agenda for effective action by . . . Congress. 
I agree. The U.S. Constitution does 
not allow me to assign different elec-
tors to a State, nor should it. The U.S. 
Constitution does not give the option 
to the Vice President of the United 
States 
to 
just 
unilaterally 
decide 
which States are in and out, and it 
should not. Each State decides its elec-
tors through its people. 
A small group of Senators, including 
myself, have demanded that we not ig-
nore the questions that millions of peo-
ple are asking in our Nation, so we 
have proposed a constitutional solu-
tion. Pause the count. Get more facts 
to the States before January the 20th. 
We proposed a 15-member commission, 
just like what was done after the failed 
election of 1876. We are encouraging 
people to spend 10 days going through 
all the issues so States can have one

last opportunity to address any chal-
lenges. Then the States, as the Con-
stitution directs, would make the final 
decision on their electors. 
I have some colleagues who have said 
that a 10-day commission is not enough 
time, so they have counterproposed 
just ignoring the lingering questions. 
We need to do something. 
(Mr. GRASSLEY assumed the Chair.) 
Mr. LANKFORD. My challenge today 
is not about the good people of Ari-
zona. 
f 
RECESS SUBJECT TO THE CALL OF 
THE CHAIR 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
Senate will stand in recess subject to 
the call of the Chair. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 2:13 p.m., 
recessed subject to the call of the Chair 
and reassembled at 8:06 p.m. when 
called to order by the Vice President of 
the United States. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Vice 
President, as President of the Senate, 
would like to give a brief statement 
with the indulgence of the Senate. 
Today was a dark day in the history 
of the United States Capitol, but 
thanks to the swift efforts of U.S. Cap-
itol Police, Federal, State, and local 
law enforcement, the violence was 
quelled, the Capitol is secured, and the 
people’s work continues. 
We condemn the violence that took 
place here in the strongest possible 
terms. We grieve the loss of life that 
took place in these hallowed Halls, as 
well as the injuries suffered by those 
who defended our Capitol today. And 
we will always be grateful to the men 
and women who stayed at their posts 
to defend this historic place. 
To those who wreaked havoc in our 
Capitol today, you did not win. Vio-
lence never wins. Freedom wins. And 
this is still the People’s House. 
As we reconvene in this Chamber, the 
world will again witness the resilience 
and strength of our democracy, for 
even in the wake of unprecedented vio-
lence and vandalism at this Capitol, 
the elected representatives of the peo-
ple of the United States have assem-
bled again on the very same day to sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the 
United States. 
May God bless the lost, the injured, 
and the heroes forged on this day. May 
God bless all who serve here and those 
who protect this place. And may God 
bless the United States of America. 
Let’s get back to work. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT 
AGREEMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the major-
ity leader and the Democratic leader 
be allowed to speak and that the time 
not count against the 2 hours of debate 
in relation to the objection raised on 
the State of Arizona. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there ob-
jection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I want to say to 
the American people, the United States 
Senate will not be intimidated. 
We will not be kept out of this Cham-
ber by thugs, mobs, or threats. We will 
not bow to lawlessness or intimidation. 
We are back at our posts. We will dis-
charge our duty under the Constitution 
and for our Nation, and we are going to 
do it tonight. 
This afternoon, Congress began the 
process of honoring the will of the 
American people and counting the elec-
toral college votes. We have fulfilled 
this solemn duty every 4 years for 
more than two centuries. Whether our 
Nation has been at war or at peace, 
under all manner of threats, even dur-
ing an ongoing armed rebellion and the 
Civil War, the clockwork of our democ-
racy has carried on. 
The United States and the United 
States Congress have faced down much 
greater threats than the unhinged 
crowd we saw today. We have never 
been deterred before, and we will not be 
deterred today. 
They tried to disrupt our democracy. 
They failed. They failed. 
This failed attempt to obstruct the 
Congress, this failed insurrection, only 
underscores how crucial the task be-
fore us is for our Republic. 
Our Nation was founded precisely so 
that the free choice of the American 
people is what shapes our self-govern-
ment and determines the destiny of our 
Nation—not fear, not force, but the 
peaceful expression of the popular will. 
We assembled this afternoon to count 
our citizens’ votes and to formalize 
their choice of the next President. Now 
we are going to finish exactly what we 
started. We will complete this process 
the right way, by the book. We will fol-
low our precedents, our laws, and our 
Constitution to the letter, and we will 
certify the winner of the 2020 Presi-
dential election. 
Criminal behavior will never domi-
nate the United States Congress. This 
institution is resilient. Our democratic 
Republic is strong. The American peo-
ple deserve nothing less. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is 
very, very difficult to put into words 
what has transpired today. I have 
never lived through or even imagined 
an experience like the one we have just 
witnessed in this Capitol. President 
Franklin Roosevelt set aside December 
7, 1941, as a day that ‘‘will live in in-
famy.’’ Unfortunately, we can now add 
January 6, 2021, to that very short list 
of dates in American history that will 
live forever in infamy. 
This temple to democracy was dese-
crated, its windows smashed, and our 
offices 
vandalized. 
The 
world 
saw 
America’s elected officials hurriedly 
ushered out because they were in 
harm’s way. The House and Senate 
floor were places of shelter until the 
evacuation was ordered, leaving rioters 
to stalk these hallowed Halls. Law-
makers and our staffs, average citizens 
who love their country and serve it 
every day, feared for their lives. I un-
derstand that one woman was shot and 
tragically lost her life. We mourn her 
and feel for her friends and family. 
These images were projected to the 
world. Foreign Embassies cabled their 
home 
capitals 
to 
report 
on 
the 
harrowing scenes at the very heart of 
our democracy. This will be a stain on 
our country not so easily washed 
away—the final, terrible, indelible leg-
acy of the 45th President of the United 
States and undoubtedly our worst. 
I want to be very clear. Those who 
performed 
these 
reprehensible 
acts 
cannot be called protestors. No, these 
were 
rioters 
and 
insurrectionists, 
goons and thugs, domestic terrorists. 
They do not represent America. These 
were a few thousand violent extremists 
who tried to take over the Capitol 
Building and attack our democracy. 
They must and should be prosecuted to 
the full extent of the law, hopefully, by 
this administration; if not, certainly 
by the next. They should be provided 
no leniency. 
I want to thank the many in the Cap-
itol Hill Police and Secret Service and 
local police who kept us safe today and 
worked to clear the Capitol and return 
it to its rightful owners and its rightful 
purpose. I want to thank the leaders, 
Democratic and Republican, House and 
Senate. It was Speaker PELOSI, Leader 
MCCONNELL, Leader MCCARTHY, and 
myself who came together and decided 
that these thugs would not succeed and 
that we would finish the work that our 
Constitution requires us to complete in 
the very legislative Chambers of the 
House and Senate that were desecrated 
but we know always belong to the peo-
ple and do again tonight. 
But make no mistake—make no mis-
take, my friends—today’s events did 
not happen spontaneously. The Presi-
dent who promoted the conspiracy 
theories that motivated these thugs, 
the President who exhorted them to 
come to our Nation’s Capital egged 
them on. He hardly ever discourages vi-
olence and more often encourages it. 
This President bears a great deal of the 
blame. 
This mob was, in good part, Presi-
dent Trump’s doing, incited by his 
words and his lies. This violence, in 
good part, is his responsibility and his 
everlasting shame. Today’s events cer-
tainly—certainly—would not have hap-
pened without him. 
Now January 6 will go down as one of 
the darkest days in recent American 
history—a final warning to our Nation 
about the consequences of a demagogic 
President, the people who enable him, 
the captive media that parrot his lies, 
and the people who follow him as he at-
tempts to push America to the brink of 
ruin.

really accomplished is to delay our

work by a few hours. We will resume 
our responsibilities now, and we will 
finish our task tonight. The House and 
Senate Chambers will be restored good 
as new and ready for legislating in 
short order. 
The counting of the electoral votes is 
our sacred duty. Democracy’s roots in 
this Nation are deep; they are strong; 
and they will not be undone, ever, by a 
group of thugs. Democracy will tri-
umph, as it has for centuries. 
So to my fellow Americans who were 
shocked and appalled by the images on 
their televisions today and who are 
worried about the future of this coun-
try, let me speak to you directly. The 
divisions in our country clearly run 
deep, but we are a resilient, forward- 
looking, and optimistic people. And we 
will begin the hard work of repairing 
this Nation tonight because here in 
America we do hard things. In Amer-
ica, we always overcome our chal-
lenges. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Vice Presi-
dent, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator 
from Oklahoma, Senator LANKFORD. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Vice President, 
you said things more eloquently than 
how we say it in Oklahoma. In Okla-
homa, we say something like: Why in 
God’s name would someone think at-
tacking law enforcement and occu-
pying the United States Capitol is the 
best way to show that you are right? 
Why would you do that? 
Rioters and thugs don’t run the Cap-
itol. We are the United States of Amer-
ica. We disagree on a lot of things, and 
we have a lot of spirited debate in this 
room, but we talk it out, and we honor 
each other, even in our disagreements. 
That person, that person, and that per-
son is not my enemy. That is my fellow 
American. And while we disagree on 
things, and disagree strongly at times, 
we do not encourage what happened 
today—ever. 
Now, I want to join my fellow Sen-
ators in saying thank you to the Cap-
itol Hill Police, the law enforcement, 
the National Guard, the Secret Service 
who stood in harm’s way. While we 
were here debating, they were pushing 
back. And I was literally interrupted 
midsentence speaking here because we 
were all unaware of what was hap-
pening right outside this room because 
of their faithfulness and because of 
what they have done. I want to thank 
them. 
Ronald Reagan once said: Peace is 
not the absence of conflict. It is the 
ability to handle conflict by peaceful 
means. 
The peaceful people in my State of 
Oklahoma want their questions an-
swered, but they don’t want this, what 
happened today. They want to do the 
right thing, and they also want to do it 
the right way. They want to honor the 
constitutional process, but they also 
want to have debate about election se-
curity because they want to make sure 
it is right, which is why it is an impor-
tant issue that still needs to be re-
solved. 
Transparency in government just 
doesn’t seem like a bad idea. Obvi-
ously, the Commission that we have 
asked for is not going to happen at this 
point, and I understand that. And we 
are headed tonight toward the certifi-
cation of Joe Biden to be the President 
of the United States, and we will work 
together in this body to be able to set 
a peaceful example in the days ahead. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from 
Nevada, Senator CORTEZ MASTO. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Nevada. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. Vice Presi-
dent, I know that this room is full of 
leaders of both parties who love this 
country, and many believe that for 
America to succeed, our politics must 
find common ground. That has never 
been clearer than today, when armed 
rioters 
stormed 
the 
U.S. 
Capitol, 
emboldened by President Trump’s false 
and inflammatory rhetoric about the 
2020 elections. 
I believe that we, in this Chamber, 
have a special duty as leaders to work 
together to lower the temperature of 
our politics, and I hope that my col-
leagues, who have questioned the legit-
imacy of this election in Arizona and 
all of these other States, now see the 
dire and dangerous consequences of 
sowing doubt and uncertainty. 
I also know that, as U.S. Senators, 
we all take solemnly the oath we swear 
to support and defend the Constitution 
of the United States against all en-
emies, foreign and domestic. At this 
moment in history, I can think of 
nothing more patriotic than renewing 
our faith in the Charters of Freedom 
that our Founding Fathers crafted for 
our Republic, starting with the funda-
mental American principle in our Dec-
laration of Independence that govern-
ments derive their just powers from 
the consent of the governed. 
The people have spoken in this elec-
tion, and our only job here today is to 
do what they ask. It is not to argue 
election security. That is not the place 
for what we are doing today. 
Our 
Constitution 
specifically 
re-
serves to the people the right to meet 
in their respective States and vote for 
the President and Vice President. As a 
result, individual States oversee and 
implement the election process, not 
the Federal Government. 
To guard against fraud or irregular-
ities in the voting process, the States 
are required to have robust election se-
curity measures. Likewise, State legis-
latures have the opportunity to exam-
ine evidence of voter fraud before they 
certify their electoral college votes. 
And our courts—from district courts to 
the United States Supreme Court—ad-
judicate legal challenges and election 
disputes. All of those things happened 
after the 2020 election. 
Statehouses and courts across the 
country took allegations of voter fraud 
seriously and followed the constitu-
tional process to hear challenges to 
this year’s election. No State found 
evidence of any widespread voter fraud 
and neither did any court ask to review 
the State’s findings. 
In 
Arizona, 
Republican 
Governor 
Doug Ducey; the Democratic secretary 
of state, Katie Hobbs; the Republican 
attorney general, Mark Brnovich; and 
the State supreme court chief justice, 
Robert Brutinel all certified the results 
of the election on November 30. 
And we know—we have heard—Arizo-
nans have been voting by mail for al-
most 30 years, and Governor Ducey has 
expressed confidence in the State’s 
process numerous times. In November, 
he said: 
We do elections well here in Arizona. The 
system is strong, and that is why I have 
bragged on it so much. 
He further stated: 
We have some of the strongest election 
laws in the country, laws that prioritize ac-
countability and clearly lay out our proce-
dures for conducting, canvassing and even 
contesting the results. 
And they are right. Arizona has one 
of the most transparent election proc-
esses in the country with built-in ac-
countability, starting with the internal 
auditing. 
We have heard unfounded allegations 
that voting machines in Arizona and 
elsewhere somehow changed vote tal-
lies or somehow improperly rejected 
ballots while claiming to accept them. 
These allegations all ignore the fact 
that Arizona counties conducted ballot 
audits by hand to double-check the ma-
chine counts, and these audits found no 
widespread fraud or irregularities. 
Maricopa County, the county where 
more than 60 percent of the State’s 
population resides, conducted a post-
election hand count audit in the week 
after the election, which showed per-
fect, 100 percent, accuracy in the ma-
chine tabulations. So why would we 
need, my colleagues, to call for a 10- 
day emergency audit to be conducted 
by a legislative commission when it 
has already been done by the State of 
Arizona? What happened to State’s 
rights? 
The audit involved checking ballots 
for the Presidential election but also 
ballots for Federal and State legisla-
tive elections. The audit report shows 
every precinct’s machine and hand 
count totals for each of the races au-
dited, and for every single race in every 
precinct, the difference between the 
hand count and the machine count was 
zero. Maricopa’s audit report stated: 
No discrepancies were found by the 
hand count audit boards. 
Seeking to find any reason to contest 
these results, some of the State Repub-
licans then tried to claim that Mari-
copa County failed to follow State law 
in conducting this audit by selecting 
voting center locations to audit in-
stead of voting precincts. This was

wrong. And this, too, went to a court. 
In rejecting this claim, the State court 
in Arizona found that the county fol-
lowed the properly issued guidance on 
hand audit procedures from the Ari-
zona Secretary of State. And the court 
found that Maricopa County officials, 
therefore, could not lawfully have per-
formed the hand count audit the way 
the plaintiffs wanted it done. If they 
had done so, they would have exposed 
themselves to criminal punishment. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Sen-
ator’s 5 minutes has expired. 
Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Thank you, 
Mr. Vice President. I would close by 
just saying, please, my colleagues, do 
not disenfranchise the voters of Ari-
zona and certify their votes tonight. 
Thank you. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Vice Presi-
dent, I yield up to 5 minutes to the 
Senator from Utah, Senator LEE. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. Vice President, from 
the time I prepared my remarks for 
today, it seems like a lifetime ago. A 
lot has changed in the last few hours. 
So I am going to deliver some of the 
same remarks, but it has a little bit of 
a different feel than it would have just 
a few hours ago. 
My thoughts and prayers go out to 
the family members of those who have 
been injured or killed today. My heart-
felt gratitude goes out to the Capitol 
Hill Police who valiantly defended our 
building and our lives. 
While it is true that legitimate con-
cerns have been raised with regard to 
how some of the key battleground 
States conducted their Presidential 
elections, this is not the end of the 
story. We each have to remember that 
we swore an oath to uphold, protect, 
and defend this document, written 
nearly two and a half centuries ago by 
wise men raised up by God for that 
very purpose. That document makes 
clear what our role is and what it isn’t. 
It makes clear who does what when it 
comes to deciding Presidential elec-
tions. 
You see, because in our system of 
government, Presidents are not di-
rectly elected. They are chosen by 
Presidential electors, and the Constitu-
tion makes very clear, under article II, 
section 1, that the States shall appoint 
Presidential electors according to pro-
cedures that their legislatures develop. 
Then comes the 12th Amendment. It 
explains what we are doing here today 
in the Capitol. It explains that the 
President of the Senate—the Vice 
President of the United States—shall 
open the ballots, ‘‘and the votes shall 
then be counted.’’ It is those words 
that confine, define, and constrain 
every scrap of authority that we have 
in this process. 
Our job is to open and then count. 
Open, then count—that is it. That is all 
there is. 
There are, of course, rare instances— 
instances in which multiple slates of 
electors can be submitted by the same 
State. That doesn’t happen very often. 
It happened in 1960. It happened in 1876. 
Let’s hope it doesn’t ever happen 
again. In those rare moments, Congress 
has to make a choice. It has to decide 
which of the electoral votes will be 
counted and which will not. That did 
not happen here—thank heavens—and 
let’s hope that it never does. 
Many of my colleagues have raised 
objections or had previously stated 
their intent to raise objections with re-
gard to these. I have spent an enor-
mous time on this issue over the last 
few weeks. I have met with lawyers on 
both sides of the issue, and I have met 
with lawyers representing the Trump 
campaign, reading everything I can 
find about the constitutional provi-
sions in question, and I have spent a 
lot of time on the phone with legisla-
tors and other leaders from the con-
tested States. I didn’t initially declare 
my position because I didn’t yet have 
one. 
I wanted to get the facts first, and I 
wanted to understand what was hap-
pening. I wanted to give the people 
serving in government in the contested 
States the opportunity to do whatever 
they felt they needed to do to make 
sure that their election was properly 
reflected. I spent an enormous amount 
of time reaching out to State govern-
ment officials in those States, but in 
none of the contested States—no, not 
even one—did I discover any indication 
that there was any chance that any 
State legislature or secretary of state 
or Governor or Lieutenant Governor 
had any intention to alter the slate of 
electors. That being the case, our job is 
a very simple one. 
This simply isn’t how our Federal 
system is supposed to work. That is to 
say, if you have concerns with the way 
that an election in the Presidential 
race was handled in your State, the ap-
propriate response is to approach your 
State legislatures, first and foremost. 
These protests—hearing from those 
who have raised concerns—should have 
been focused on their State capitols, 
not the Nation’s Capitol, because our 
role is narrow, our role is defined, our 
role is limited. 
Yes, we are the election judges when 
it comes to Members elected to our 
own body. And, yes, the House of Rep-
resentatives are the judges of their own 
races there. 
We also have the authority to pre-
scribe, as a Congress, rules governing 
the time, place, and manner of elec-
tions for Senators and Representatives. 
There is no corresponding authority 
with respect to Presidential elections— 
none whatsoever. It doesn’t exist. Our 
job is to convene, to open the ballots, 
and to count them. That is it. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from 
Colorado, Mr. BENNET. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Colleagues, it has been 
a terrible day for everybody here and 
for our country. 
One of the things I was thinking 
about today is something I often think 
about when I am on this floor, which is 
that the Founders of this country, the 
people who wrote our Constitution, ac-
tually knew our history better than we 
know our history. 
I was thinking about that history 
today, as we saw the mob riot in Wash-
ington, DC—thinking about what the 
Founders were thinking about when 
they wrote our Constitution, which was 
what happened to the Roman Republic 
when armed gangs, doing the work for 
politicians, prevented Rome from cast-
ing their ballots for consuls, for prae-
tors, for senators. These were the offi-
cers in Rome, and these armed gangs 
ran through the streets of Rome, keep-
ing elections from being started, keep-
ing elections from ever being called. In 
the end, because of that, the Roman 
Republic fell, and a dictator took its 
place, and that was the end of the 
Roman Republic—or any republic, for 
that matter—until this beautiful Con-
stitution was written in the United 
States of America. 
So it is my fervent hope that the way 
we respond to this today, my dear col-
leagues, is that we give the biggest bi-
partisan vote we can in support of our 
democracy and in support of our Con-
stitution and in rejection of what we 
saw today and what the Roman Repub-
lic saw in its own time. 
There is a tendency around this 
place, I think, to always believe that 
we are the first people to confront 
something when that is seldom the 
case and to underappreciate what the 
effect of our actions will be. We need to 
deeply appreciate, in this moment, our 
obligation to the Constitution, our ob-
ligation to democracy, and our obliga-
tion to the Republic. 
There are people in this Chamber 
who have twisted the words—twisted 
the words—of a statute written in the 
19th century that was meant to actu-
ally settle our electoral disputes, to 
leave them with the States, as the Sen-
ator from Utah was saying, to give us 
a ministerial role, except in very rare 
circumstances. That is what that law 
is about that the Senator of Texas was 
talking about today. And that is the 
law that is leading us to be asked to 
overturn the judgments of 60 courts in 
America, many of the courts in Ari-
zona, some of whom have howled the 
President’s lawyers out of the court-
rooms because there is no evidence of 
fraud. 
By the way, the fact that 37 percent 
or 39 percent of Americans think there 
is evidence of fraud does not mean 
there is fraud. If you have turned a 
blind eye to a conspiracy theory, you 
can’t now come to the floor of the Sen-
ate and say you are ignoring the people 
who believe that the election was sto-
len. Go out there and tell them the 
truth, which is that every single Mem-
ber of this Senate knows this election

wasn’t stolen and that we, just as in 
the Roman Republic, have a responsi-
bility to protect the independence of 
the judiciary from politicians who will 
stop at nothing to hold on to power. 
There is nothing new about that either. 
That has been true since the first re-
public was founded. 
So now we find ourselves in the posi-
tion, just days after many Senators 
here swore an oath to uphold and de-
fend the Constitution—every single 
Member of the House of Representa-
tives swore the same oath, as well, and 
I think we have a solemn obligation 
and responsibility here to prove, once 
again, that this country is a nation of 
laws and not of men, and the only re-
sult that we can reach together is one 
that rejects the claim of the Senator 
from Texas and the other Members of 
the House and Senate who seek to 
overturn the decisions that have been 
made by the States, by the voters in 
these States, and by the courts. 
If we follow what they have proposed, 
we will be the ones who will have dis-
enfranchised every single person who 
cast a vote in this election, whether 
they voted for the President or they 
didn’t. 
I urge you to reject this, and I deeply 
appreciate the opportunity to serve 
with every single one of you. 
Thank you. 
(Applause.) 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I yield up to 5 
minutes to the Senator from Georgia, 
Senator LOEFFLER. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Georgia. 
Mrs. 
LOEFFLER. 
Mr. 
President, 
when I arrived in Washington this 
morning, I fully intended to object to 
the certification of the electoral votes. 
However, the events that have tran-
spired today have forced me to recon-
sider, and I cannot now, in good con-
science, object to the certification of 
these electors. 
The violence, the lawlessness, and 
siege of the Halls of Congress are ab-
horrent and stand as a direct attack on 
the very institution my objection was 
intended to protect: the sanctity of the 
American democratic process. And I 
thank law enforcement for keeping us 
safe. 
I believe that there were last-minute 
changes to the November 2020 election 
process and serious irregularities that 
resulted in too many Americans losing 
confidence not only in the integrity of 
our elections but in the power of the 
ballot as a tool of democracy. Too 
many Americans are frustrated at 
what they see as an unfair system. 
Nevertheless, there is no excuse for the 
events that took place in these Cham-
bers today, and I pray that America 
never suffers such a dark day again. 
Though the fate of this vote is clear, 
the future of the American people’s 
faith in the core institution of this de-
mocracy remains uncertain. We as a 
body must turn our focus to protecting 
the integrity of our elections and re-
storing every American’s faith that 
their voice and their vote matter. 
America is a divided country with se-
rious differences, but it is still the 
greatest country on Earth. There can 
be no disagreement that upholding de-
mocracy is the only path to preserving 
our Republic. 
I yield the floor. 
(Applause.) 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield 21⁄2 minutes to 
Senator BOOKER
and 21⁄2
minutes to 
Senator KAINE, in reverse order. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President and my 
colleagues, I applaud the comments of 
my colleague from Georgia deeply. 
My first job after school was in 
Macon, GA, working for a Federal 
judge, Lanier Anderson. I learned a lot 
about integrity and a lot about law 
from him. I also learned some sad les-
sons, that in the history of Georgia— 
and, 
indeed, 
Virginia 
and 
many 
States—so many people, especially peo-
ple of color, had been disenfranchised 
over the course of our history. Our late 
friend, John Lewis, a Congressman 
from Georgia, was savagely beaten on 
Bloody Sunday just for marching for 
voting rights. That act of violence in-
spired this body, the U.S. Senate, to 
come together in March of 1965 and 
work to pass, in a bipartisan fashion, 
the Voting Rights Act. 
We 
should 
be 
coming 
together 
today—after acts of violence—as a U.S. 
Senate, to affirm the votes of all who 
cast ballots in November. Instead, we 
are contemplating an unprecedented 
objection that would be a massive dis-
enfranchisement of American voters. 
The Georgia result was very clear: a 
12,000-vote margin, 2 certifications by 
Republican officials, 4 separate re-
counts and canvases, 7 lawsuits, as in 
the other States. If we object to results 
like this, the message is so clear. We 
are saying to States: No matter how 
secure and accurate your elections are, 
we will gladly overthrow them if we 
don’t like who you voted for. But, more 
importantly, what we will be saying— 
really, what we will be doing—is as the 
body that acted together to guarantee 
Americans the right to vote, we will 
become the agent of one of the most 
massive disenfranchisements in the 
history of this country. 
So I urge all of my colleagues: Please 
oppose these objections. 
Thank you. 
I yield to my colleague from New 
Jersey. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Mr. Vice President, I 
can only think of two times in Amer-
ican history that individuals laid siege 
to our Capitol, stormed our sacred 
civic spaces, and tried to upend and 
overrun this government. One was in 
the War of 1812, and the other one was 
today. 
What is interesting about the par-
allel between the two is they both were 
waving flags to a sole sovereign, to an 
individual, 
surrendering 
democratic 
principles to the cult of personality. 
One was a monarch in England, and the 
other were the flags I saw all over our 
Capitol, including in the hallways and 
in this room, to a single person named 
Donald Trump. 
The sad difference between these two 
times is one was yet another nation in 
the history of our country that tried to 
challenge the United States of Amer-
ica, but this time, we brought this hell 
upon ourselves. 
My colleague from Texas said that 
this was a moment where there were 
unprecedented 
allegations 
of 
voter 
fraud. Yes, that is true. They were un-
precedented when the President, before 
the election even happened, said: If I 
lose this election, then the election 
was rigged. 
That is unprecedented. It is unprece-
dented that, before the night of the 
counting of the vote was even done, 
that he called it rigged. It is unprece-
dented that he is fanning the flames of 
conspiracy theory to create a smoke-
screen in this Nation to cover what he 
is trying to do, which is undermine our 
democratic principles. 
But it is not just that. The shame of 
this day is it is being aided and abetted 
by good Americans who are falling 
prey, who are choosing Trump over 
truth, who are surrendering to the pas-
sion of lies as opposed to standing up 
and speaking truth to power, who are 
trying to fundraise off of the shame of 
conspiracy theories as opposed to doing 
the incalculably valuable, patriotic 
thing: to speak truth to our Nation. 
Our democracy is wounded, and I saw it 
when I saw pictures of yet another in-
surgency, of a flag of another group of 
Americans who tried to challenge our 
Nation. I saw the flag of the Confed-
eracy there. 
What will we do? How will we con-
front this shame? How will we confront 
this dark second time in American his-
tory? I pray that we remember a Geor-
gian and his words. All I can say is we 
must, in spirit, join together like those 
Georgians on a bridge called the Ed-
mund Pettus, who joined hands, who 
were called threats to our democracy, 
who were called outrageous epithets 
when they sought to expand our de-
mocracy, to save it, to heal it—when 
they joined arm in arm and said what 
we should say now, commit ourselves 
to that ideal, that together, we shall 
overcome.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S22 
January 6, 2021 
office today. Obviously, it hasn’t been 
easy. 
Colleagues, today has been ugly. 
When I came to the floor this morning, 
I planned to talk about the lesson of 
1801 because I am kind of a history 
nerd, and I wanted to celebrate the glo-
ries of the peaceful transition of power 
across our Nation’s history. It feels a 
little naive now to talk about ways 
that American civics might be some-
thing that could unite us and bring us 
back together. 
Now, 1801 blew everybody’s mind all 
over the world, by the way. John 
Adams loses to Thomas Jefferson, and 
Adams willingly leaves the Executive 
mansion and moves back to Massachu-
setts, and Jefferson peacefully assumes 
power. People all over Europe said: 
That must be fake news. Those must be 
bad reports. There is no way any Exec-
utive would ever willingly lay down 
power. Yet Adams, in defeat, did some-
thing glorious to give all of us a gift. 
I wanted to celebrate that, and it 
feels a little bit harder now. This build-
ing has been desecrated. Blood has been 
spilled in the hallways. I was with oc-
togenarian Members of this Chamber 
who needed to have troops and police 
stabilize them to get down the stairs at 
a time when a lot of our staffs were 
panicked and under their desks and not 
knowing what was going to happen to 
them. 
It was ugly today. But you know 
what? It turns out that when some-
thing is ugly, talking about beauty 
isn’t just permissible; talking about 
beauty is obligatory in a time like 
that. Why? Why would we talk about 
beauty after the ugliness of today? Be-
cause our kids need to know that this 
isn’t what America is. What happened 
today isn’t what America is. 
They have been given a glorious in-
heritance for the 59th Presidential 
election. If the Vice President wasn’t 
in the Chair and if the President pro 
tempore was, I would have made some 
joke that CHUCK GRASSLEY has voted in 
two-thirds of those 59 Presidential elec-
tions. He is laughing. It is not as good 
as ‘‘hit deer, deer dead,’’ but it still got 
a Grassley laugh. 
I don’t think we want to tell the 
Americans that come after us that this 
republic is broken, that this is just a 
banana republic, that our institutions 
can’t be trusted. I don’t think we want 
that. We don’t want that in this body, 
and we don’t want that in our home-
towns. I don’t think we want to tell our 
kids that America’s best days are be-
hind us—because it is not true. That is 
not who we are. America isn’t Hat-
fields’ and McCoys’ blood feud forever. 
America is a union. 
There is a lot that is broken in this 
country but not anything that is so big 
that the American people can’t rebuild 
it, that freedom and community and 
entrepreneurial effort and that neigh-
borhoods can’t rebuild. Nothing that is 
broken is so big that we can’t fix it. 
Generations of our forefathers and 
our 
foremothers—probably 
not 
a 
word—and our ancestors have spilled 
blood to defend the glories of this re-
public. Why would they do that? Be-
cause America is the most exceptional 
nation in the history of the world and 
because the Constitution is the great-
est political document that has ever 
been written. Most governments in the 
past have said might makes right, and 
we saw some of that hooligan nuttery 
today. Might makes right. No, it 
doesn’t. 
God gives us rights by nature, and 
government is just our shared project 
to secure those rights. America has al-
ways been about what we choose to do 
together, the way we reaffirm our con-
stitutional system. We have some gov-
ernmental tasks, and we all in this 
body could do better at those govern-
mental tasks, but the heart of America 
is not government. The center of Amer-
ica is not Washington, DC. 
The center of America is the neigh-
borhoods where 330 million Americans 
are raising their kids and trying to put 
food on the table and trying to love 
their neighbor. That is the center of 
America. 
We are not supposed to be the most 
important people in America. We are 
supposed to be servant leaders who try 
to maintain a framework for ordered 
liberty so that there is a structure 
that, back home where they live, they 
can get from the silver-framed struc-
ture and order to the golden apple at 
the center, as Washington would have 
said, which is the things that they 
build together, the places where they 
coach little league, the places where 
they invite people to synagogue or 
church. 
Sometimes, the biggest things we do 
together are governmental, like kick-
ing Hitler’s ass or like going to the 
moon. Sometimes, there is govern-
mental stuff. But the heart of America 
is about places where moms and dads 
are raising kids, and we are supposed 
to serve them by maintaining order 
and by rejecting violence. You can’t do 
big things like that if you hate your 
neighbors. You can’t do big things to-
gether as Americans if you think other 
Americans are the enemy. 
Look, there is a lot of uncertainty 
about the future. I get it. There is a lot 
that does need to be rebuilt. But if you 
are angry—I want to beg you—don’t let 
the screamers who monetize hate have 
the final word. Don’t let needlists be-
come your drug dealers. There are 
some who want to burn it all down. We 
met some of them today. 
But they aren’t going to win. Don’t 
let them be your prophets—instead, or-
ganize, persuade, but most impor-
tantly, love your neighbor. Visit the 
widower down the street who is lonely 
and doesn’t want to tell anybody that 
his wife died and he doesn’t have a lot 
of friends. Shovel somebody’s drive-
way. You can’t hate somebody who just 
shoveled your driveway. 
The heart of life is about community 
and neighborhood, and we are supposed 
to be servant leaders. The constitu-
tional system is still the greatest order 
for any government ever, and it is our 
job to steward it and protect it. 
Let’s remember that today when we 
vote. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from Il-
linois, Mr. DURBIN. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Vice President, in 
March of 1861, a Springfield lawyer 
caught a train to Washington. His 
name was Abraham Lincoln. It wasn’t 
his first trip there. He served as Con-
gressman 15 years before and returned 
in the beginning of the Civil War to 
serve as President. 
It was a different place than he knew 
as a Congressman. In 15 years, it had 
changed a lot. The Sprigg’s boarding 
house across the street, which is now 
the Library of Congress, was gone. And 
this 
building 
was 
changing—big 
changes. They were building a dome on 
the Capitol. But they were also in the 
earliest days of war, and President Lin-
coln was counseled: Stop building the 
dome. It costs too much money. We 
can’t spend any more time on it. 
And he said: No. We are going to 
build that dome, and we are going to 
finish it. That dome and this building 
will be a symbol of this country that 
will survive this Civil War and come 
back strong. 
So they built the dome. They won 
the war. And since those days, that 
dome and this building have been a 
symbol to this country, a symbol of 
unity and of hope. 
Tours 
come 
through 
here—before 
COVID–19—by the tens of thousands. If 
you have ever noticed their tours, they 
are often shushed. People are saying: 
Show some respect for this building. 
We know this building and the Ro-
tunda as a place where some of the 
greatest American heroes of both polit-
ical parties lie in state, and we go 
there to honor them. We know this 
building because we work here. We 
enact laws here that change America. 
We gather for State of the Union mes-
sages from Presidents and honor the 
people in the gallery. 
This is a special place. This is a sa-
cred place. But this sacred place was 
desecrated by a mob today, on our 
watch. This temple to democracy was 
defiled by thugs who roamed the halls 
and sat in that chair, Mr. Vice Presi-
dent, the one that you vacated at 2:15 
this afternoon—sat and posed for pic-
tures, those who were roaming around 
in this Chamber. 
What brought this on? Did this mob 
spring spontaneously from America? 
No. This mob was invited to come to 
Washington on this day, by this Presi-
dent, for one reason: because he knew 
the electoral college vote was going to 
be counted this day. He wanted this 
mob to disrupt the constitutional proc-
ess which we are part of. This mob was 
inspired by a President who cannot ac-
cept defeat.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S23 
January 6, 2021 
If you wonder whether I am going too 
far in what I say, just read the tran-
script with the secretary of state from 
Georgia and listen to this President’s 
wild conspiracy theories, one after the 
other, swatted down by that Repub-
lican-elected official and his attorney 
as having no basis in fact. This Presi-
dent begs, he coaxes, he even threatens 
that secretary of state to find the votes 
he needs. In any other venue, that 
would be a simple, obvious crime. 
The lengths he will go to are obvious. 
The Texas Senator says to us: Well, 
many people still agree with him, you 
know, when it gets down to the bottom 
line. Many people have fallen for this 
Presidential position that it must have 
been a rigged election if I lost. 
Well, I would say that after—we have 
lost count—57 lawsuits, 62 lawsuits—I 
have heard so many different num-
bers—after 90 different judges; after 
this President took his case, the best 
he could put together, to the highest 
Court in the land across the street, 
where he had personally chosen three 
Justices on the Supreme Court—and I 
say to the Senator from Texas that he 
knows much more about that Court 
than I do—I don’t believe they let that 
paper that he sent up there even hit 
the desk before they laughed it out of 
the Court. And that is the best he had 
to offer—no evidence whatsoever of 
this 
rigged 
election 
and 
this 
fraudulence. 
The Senator from Texas says: We 
just want to create a little commis-
sion, 10 days; we are going to audit all 
of the States—particularly the ones in 
contention here—and find out what ac-
tually occurred. 
And it really draws its parallel to 
1876, to Hayes and Tilden. Don’t forget 
what that commission—that so-called 
political compromise—achieved. It was 
not just some ordinary governmental 
commission. It was a commission that 
killed reconstruction, that established 
Jim Crow, that—even after a civil war, 
which tore this Nation apart, it re- 
enslaved African-Americans, and it was 
a commission that invited voter sup-
pression we are still fighting today in 
America. 
Let me close by saying this. The vote 
we are going to have here is a clear 
choice of whether we are going to feed 
the beast of ignorance or we are going 
to tell the truth to the American peo-
ple. We saw that beast today roaming 
the halls. Let’s not invite it back. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I yield up to 5 
minutes to the Senator from Kansas, 
Senator MARSHALL. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Thank you, Mr. 
President. 
Freedom of speech and the freedom 
to protest are provided in our Constitu-
tion. While I share the same frustra-
tion many Americans have over the 
Presidential election, the violence and 
mob rule that occurred at the U.S. Cap-
itol today and across the country over 
the past year are unacceptable, and I 
condemn them at the highest level. 
Like all of us in the Chamber, I am 
thankful for the heroic law enforce-
ment officers who worked feverishly to 
restore order so that we get back to 
the electoral certification process. 
During my 29-year career as an obste-
trician and gynecologist, too often I 
had to sit down with patients and give 
them a very bad diagnosis. It might 
have been a young mother of three 
whose three babies I delivered, now 
with metastatic breast cancer, or per-
haps another woman with advanced 
cervical or ovarian cancer, all of which 
have very challenging prognoses. But 
before I sat down with each one of 
those patients, I carefully reviewed all 
the labs, their x rays, and the pathol-
ogy to make sure I had the facts 
straight, but at the end of the day, my 
final 
recommendation 
was 
always 
going to be a recommendation from my 
heart. 
I want my fellow Kansans and all 
Americans to know that I have given 
as much consideration and thought 
surrounding the issue of objecting to a 
State’s electoral college votes as I did 
considering the treatment plan for a 
serious health concern, and today’s de-
cision once again is from my heart. 
Mr. President, I rise today to restore 
integrity to our Republic, and I rise to 
do it knowing that many of our col-
leagues are all concerned for current 
and future generations. We must re-
store faith and confidence in one of our 
Republic’s most hallowed and patriotic 
duties: voting. 
There is no question our U.S. Con-
stitution empowers State legislatures 
to execute free, legal, and fair elec-
tions. Unfortunately, in several States, 
the clear authority of those State leg-
islatures to determine the rules for 
voting was usurped by Governors, sec-
retaries of state, and activist courts. 
Our laws and Constitution should al-
ways be followed, especially in a time 
of crisis. 
I don’t rise to undo a State’s legally 
obtained electoral college votes; rath-
er, I rise in hopes of improving the in-
tegrity of the ballot to hold States ac-
countable to the time-proven constitu-
tional system of the electoral college. 
This is why I urge the formation of 
an electoral commission to give con-
structive suggestions and recommenda-
tions that States can take to make our 
elections once again safe, free, and fair 
after a year of jarring irregularities. 
We must and will have a peaceful 
transition of power. 
To all my fellow Americans, I have 
no doubt that our Republic can grow 
stronger through this difficult day. 
May God bless this great Republic. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The minor-
ity leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from Il-
linois, Senator DUCKWORTH. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. In 2004, I packed 
up my rucksack, laced up my boots, 
and deployed to Iraq, ready to sacrifice 
whatever was asked of me, all because 
I love this Nation—willing to sacrifice 
my life, if needed, because I believe in 
the sanctity of our electoral system, 
which had declared George W. Bush my 
Commander in Chief. 
I earned my wounds proudly fighting 
in a war I did not support on the orders 
of a President I did not vote for be-
cause I believed in and I still do believe 
in the values of our Nation; because I 
believe in a government of, by, and for 
the 
people, 
where 
voters—voters— 
choose who leads them, not the other 
way around. 
I have spent my entire adult life de-
fending our democracy, but I never— 
never—thought it would be necessary 
to defend it from an attempted violent 
overthrow in our Nation’s own Capitol 
Building. Well, I refuse to let anyone 
intent on instigating chaos or inciting 
violence deter me from carrying out 
my constitutional duties. 
You know, when my Army buddies 
and I raised our right hands, when 
45,000 troops in Arizona raised their 
right hands and swore to protect and 
defend the Constitution, we did not 
qualify our oaths by saying that we 
would follow orders only when the 
Commander in Chief was someone 
whose election we were happy with. 
Just like when every Senator in this 
Chamber was sworn into office, we 
didn’t mutter under our breath that we 
discharge our duties only when it 
served our political interests or helped 
us to avoid the wrath of a petty, inse-
cure, wannabe tin-pot dictator on the 
precipice of losing power and rel-
evance. No, there is no ambiguity 
here—Joe Biden won the election with 
a record number of votes. Republican 
officials nationwide confirmed those 
results, including in Arizona, as has 
judge after Trump-appointed judge. 
Even Trump’s Attorney General admit-
ted that the U.S. Department of Jus-
tice had not found widespread fraud 
that would have affected the outcome. 
Yet still many of my Republican col-
leagues are asking us to ignore all of 
that. With no evidence of their own, 
they are asking us to ignore court rul-
ings, ignore Republican-elected offi-
cials, and even worse, ignore the will of 
the people across this vast, great Na-
tion by trying to overturn this elec-
tion. They are placing more trust in 
Reddit conspiracy theories than the 
Constitution, proving that appeasing 
Trump is more important to them than 
protecting the most basic tenet of our 
Republic—the adherence to free and 
fair elections. 
If there is one thing I know, it is that 
my troops didn’t sign up to defend our 
democracy in war zones thousands of 
mile away only to watch it crumble in 
these hallowed halls here at home. Yet 
that is what this effort amounts to—an 
attempt to subvert our democracy. In 
the process, it is threatening what 
makes America American, because in 
this 
country—in 
this 
country—the 
power 
of 
the 
people 
has 
always

S24 
January 6, 2021 
mattered more than the people in 
power. 
That is the ideal that this Nation was 
founded upon. That is why a few patri-
ots threw some tea in Boston Harbor, 
why Washington crossed the Delaware, 
why suffragists were arrested a century 
ago, and why my friend John Lewis 
crossed that bridge in Selma in 1965. It 
is why millions spent a Tuesday in No-
vember standing in line, braving a pan-
demic to make their voices heard. 
Listen, this administration has al-
ways had an adversarial relationship 
with the truth. Trump always cries 
conspiracy, 
always 
foments 
chaos 
whenever something doesn’t go his 
way. But today, we here in this Cham-
ber have the opportunity to prove that 
here in this country, truth matters, 
that right matters, that the will of the 
people matters more than the whims of 
any single powerful individual. 
I have no tea to throw in Boston Har-
bor tonight, and I regret that I have no 
rucksack to pack for my country, no 
Black Hawk to pilot, nor am I asking 
for any grand gesture from my Repub-
lican colleagues. All I am asking of you 
is to reflect on the oaths that you have 
sworn, on the damage done to our 
Union today, and on the sacrifices 
made by those who have given so much 
to this Nation, from the servicemem-
bers at Arizona’s Fort Huachuca and 
Marine Corps Air Station Yuma to the 
marchers who bent America’s moral 
arc a little bit more toward justice 
with every single step that they took, 
every bridge that they crossed. 
Then ask yourself whether the de-
mocracy they were willing to bleed for, 
the country that each of us in this 
Chamber has sworn to defend, is worth 
damaging in order to protect the por-
celain ego of a man who treats the Con-
stitution as if it were little more than 
a yellowing piece of paper. 
I think we all know the right answer. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator 
from Kentucky, Senator PAUL. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. I wrote a speech for 
today. I was planning to say that I fear 
the chaos of establishing a precedent 
that Congress can overturn elections. 
Boy, was I right. Chaos, anarchy—the 
violence today was wrong and un- 
American. 
The vote we are about to cast is in-
credibly important. Now more than 
ever, the question is, Should Congress 
override the certified results from the 
States and nullify the States’ rights to 
conduct elections? 
The vote today is not a protest; the 
vote today is literally to overturn elec-
tions. We have been told that this is a 
protest, that this is about an electoral 
commission. No, it is not. It is about 
whether to seat the electors certified 
by a State. It is not about an electoral 
commission. It is not about a protest. 
You can go outside if you want to pro-
test. This is about overturning a State- 
certified election. 
If you vote to overturn these elec-
tions, wouldn’t it be the opposite of 
States’ rights Republicans have always 
advocated for? 
This would doom the electoral col-
lege forever. It was never intended by 
our Founders that Congress have the 
power to overturn State-certified elec-
tions. My oath to the Constitution 
doesn’t allow me to disobey the law. I 
can’t vote to overturn the verdict of 
States. Such a vote would be to over-
turn everything held dear by those of 
us who support the rights of States in 
this great system of federalism that 
was bequeathed to us by our Founders. 
The electoral college was created to 
devolve the power of selecting Presi-
dential electors to the States. The 
electoral college is, without question, 
an inseparable friend to those who be-
lieve that every American across our 
vast country deserves to be heard. 
If Congress were given the power to 
overturn the States’ elections, what 
terrible chaos would ensue every 4 
years. Imagine the furor against the 
electoral college if Congress becomes a 
forum to overturn States’ electoral col-
lege slates. 
It is one thing to be angry. It is an-
other to focus one’s anger in construc-
tive ways. That hasn’t happened today, 
to say the least. 
We simply cannot destroy the Con-
stitution, our laws, and the electoral 
college in the process. 
I hope, as the Nation’s anger cools, 
we can channel that energy into essen-
tial electoral reforms at the State 
level. America is admired around the 
world for our free elections. We must— 
we absolutely must fix this mess and 
restore confidence and integrity to our 
elections. We must. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from 
Virginia, Senator WARNER. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think 
like most of us, I am still pretty reel-
ing from what happened today. What I 
was going to talk about was the work 
I am most proud of since I have been 
here, with my good friend RICHARD 
BURR and all the members of the Intel-
ligence Committee, about a multiyear 
report we did into foreign interference 
in our elections. Probably our top rec-
ommendation of that five-volume, bi-
partisan report was that any official or 
candidate should use restraint and cau-
tion when questioning results of our 
elections because when you do so, you 
often carry out the goals of our foreign 
adversaries. 
Use 
caution 
because, 
whether knowingly or unknowingly 
and whether that adversary is in Rus-
sia or China or Iran, their goals are 
pretty simple: They want to make it 
appear to Americans, to folks around 
the world, and to their own people that 
there is nothing special about Amer-
ican democracy. 
I was going to try in a feeble way, 
maybe, to reach some of the rhetorical 
heights of BEN SASSE. I knew I couldn’t 
do that, so instead—I know I am vio-
lating rules. Today is the day for vio-
lating rules. This is a photo that ap-
pears today in one of the most promi-
nent German newspapers. You don’t 
need to draw it up. You can draw up 
photos from any newspaper or any tele-
vision feed anywhere across the world. 
And what is this photo of? It is of 
thugs—thugs—in the Halls of this Cap-
itol, diminishing everything we say we 
believe in, in this democracy. 
When you look at those images, real-
ize that those images are priceless for 
our adversaries. I am willing, tonight, 
in an overwhelming way, to take a 
small step, in a bipartisan way, to 
start restoring that trust of our people 
and, hopefully, the billions of people 
around the world who believe in that 
notion of American democracy. Re-
member, these images are still there. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield 5 minutes to the Senator from 
Missouri, Mr. HAWLEY. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I want 
to begin this evening by saying thank 
you to the men and women of the Cap-
itol Police, the National Guardsmen, 
the Metropolitan Police, and others 
who came to this Capitol and put their 
lives on the line to protect everybody 
here who was working inside. I want to 
thank law enforcement all across this 
country—in my home State of Missouri 
and everywhere else—who do that day 
in and day out. 
I just want to acknowledge that, 
when it comes to violence, it was a ter-
rible year in America this last year. We 
have seen a lot of violence against law 
enforcement, and today, we saw it here 
in the Capitol of the United States. In 
this country, in the United States of 
America, we cannot say emphatically 
enough: Violence is not how you 
achieve change. Violence is not how 
you achieve something better. 
Our Constitution was built and put 
into place so that there would be, in 
the words of Abraham Lincoln, no ap-
peal from ballots to bullets, which is 
what we saw, unfortunately, attempted 
tonight. There is no place for that in 
the United States of America, and that 
is why I submit to my colleagues that 
what we are doing here tonight is, ac-
tually, very important because, for 
those who have concerns about the in-
tegrity of our elections and for those 
who have concerns about what hap-
pened in November, this is the appro-
priate means. This is the lawful place 
where those objections and concerns 
should be heard. This is the forum that 
the law provides for—that our laws 
provide for—for those concerns to be 
registered, not through violence—not 
by appealing from ballots to bullets— 
but here, in this lawful process.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S25 
January 6, 2021 
So to those who say that this is just 
a formality today—an antique cere-
mony that we have engaged in for a 
couple of hundred years—I can’t say 
that I agree. I can’t say that our prece-
dent suggests that. I actually think it 
is very vital, what we do. The oppor-
tunity to be heard and to register ob-
jections is very vital because this is 
the place where those objections are to 
be heard and dealt with, debated, and 
finally resolved—in this lawful means, 
peacefully, without violence, without 
attacks, without bullets. 
Let me just say now, briefly—in lieu 
of speaking about it later—a word 
about Pennsylvania, which is a State 
that I have been focused on and have 
objected to, as an example of why peo-
ple are concerned—why millions of 
Americans are concerned—about our 
election integrity. 
I say to Pennsylvania, quite apart 
from allegations of any fraud, you have 
a State constitution that has been in-
terpreted for over a century to say that 
there is no mail-in balloting permitted 
except 
for 
in 
very 
narrow 
cir-
cumstances, which is also provided for 
in the law. Yet, last year, Pennsylva-
nia’s elected officials passed a whole 
new law that allowed for universal 
mail-in balloting, and they did it, irre-
gardless of what the Pennsylvania Con-
stitution said. 
Then, when Pennsylvania’s citizens 
tried to be heard on this subject before 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, they 
were dismissed on grounds of procedure 
and timeliness, in violation of that su-
preme court’s own precedent. 
So the merits of the case have never 
been heard. The constitutionality of 
the statute, actually, has never been 
defended. I am not aware of any court 
that 
has 
passed 
on 
its 
constitu-
tionality. I actually am not aware of 
anybody who has defended the con-
stitutionality, and this was the statute 
that governed this last election in 
which there were over 2.5 million mail- 
in ballots in Pennsylvania. 
This is my point, that this is the 
forum. 
The 
Pennsylvania 
Supreme 
Court hasn’t heard the case, and there 
is no other court to go to, to hear the 
case in the State, so this is the appro-
priate place for these concerns to be 
raised, which is why I have raised them 
here today. 
I hope that this body will not miss 
the opportunity to take affirmative ac-
tion to address the concerns of so many 
millions of Americans—to say to mil-
lions of Americans tonight that vio-
lence is never warranted, that violence 
will not be tolerated, that those who 
engage in it will be prosecuted, but 
that this body will act to address the 
concerns of all Americans across the 
country. 
We do need an investigation into 
irregularities, fraud. We do need a way 
forward together. We need election se-
curity reforms. I bet my friends on the 
other side of the aisle don’t disagree 
with that. We need to find a way to 
move forward on that together so that 
the American people from both parties 
and all walks of life can have con-
fidence in their elections and so that 
we can arrange ourselves under the 
rule of law that we share together. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from 
Pennsylvania, Mr. CASEY. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to-
night to defend the people of the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania—to defend 
the more than 6.9 million voters who 
voted in this election—and to condemn, 
in the strongest possible terms, this at-
tempt to disenfranchise the voters of 
Pennsylvania based upon a lie, a false-
hood. That same lie sowed the seeds of 
today’s violence and today’s lawless-
ness here in the Capitol. 
One of my constituents, Susan, from 
Lehigh Valley—the community of our 
State where Senator TOOMEY lives—re-
cently wrote to my office and, perhaps, 
said it best: 
We cannot allow ANYBODY to overturn 
the legal votes of the citizens of Pennsyl-
vania. This would be the ultimate destruc-
tion of our democracy. 
Susan had it right. We cannot allow 
‘‘ANYBODY’’—and she put that word 
in all caps—to overturn the legal votes 
of the people of our State. 
Let me address the allegation regard-
ing the Pennsylvania Constitution and 
the general assembly and somehow 
that the general assembly didn’t have 
the authority to enact ‘‘no excuse 
mail-in voting’’—that process—for the 
people of our State. 
First, the law in question, Act 77, was 
passed in 2019 and was implemented 
without any serious question as to its 
constitutionality. The law was passed 
by a Republican-controlled general as-
sembly, house and senate. It was only 
after the 2020 election, when it became 
clear that President-Elect Joe Biden 
won Pennsylvania by a little more 
than 80,000 votes, that some Republican 
politicians in our State decided to 
challenge the constitutionality of the 
law. 
Second, Act 77 is plainly constitu-
tional. My colleagues allege that the 
State constitution requires in-person 
voting 
except 
under 
limited 
cir-
cumstances. This is not true. While 
Pennsylvania lays out specific situa-
tions in which absentee voting is re-
quired, there is no in-person require-
ment in our State constitution. The 
constitution sets a floor, not a ceiling, 
for this type of voting. 
Third, apart from the argument made 
by my colleague, there is bipartisan 
agreement across our State—at the 
local, State, and Federal levels—that 
our election was fair, secure, and law-
ful. On Monday, my colleague from 
Pennsylvania, Senator TOOMEY, wrote 
in an op-ed: ‘‘The evidence is over-
whelming that Joe Biden won this elec-
tion.’’ 
There is simply no evidence to justify 
the outrageous claims of widespread 
voter fraud or election irregularities 
that have been suggested by those 
seeking to overturn the election. There 
have been 60 cases in court after court, 
all throughout our State and through-
out the country, including in the Su-
preme Court, that have dealt with this 
bizarre argument that we know is 
based upon that lie. 
In one court, the U.S. Court of Ap-
peals for the Third Circuit, Judge 
Bibas, appointed by President Trump, 
wrote: 
The campaign’s claims have no merit. The 
United States has free and fair elections, 
which are the lifeblood of our democracy. 
Charges require specific allegations and then 
proof. We have neither here. 
So said Judge Bibas. 
Finally, a word about those election 
officials who did such work. These elec-
tion officials all across our State—Re-
publicans and Democrats from red 
counties and blue counties—did their 
jobs. They are patriots, and these ob-
jections are an attack on these Penn-
sylvania public servants. I will give 
you one example from Republican 
Commissioner Al Schmidt, of Philadel-
phia. 
He wrote: 
There really should not be a disagreement, 
regardless of party affiliation, when we’re 
talking about counting votes . . . by eligible 
voters. It is not a very controversial thing 
or, at least, it shouldn’t be. 
After election day, Commissioner Al 
Schmidt, his family, and his colleagues 
were subjected to death threats simply 
because he was trying to do his job 
with integrity. It calls to mind that 
great 
line 
from 
‘‘America 
the 
Beautiful″: ‘‘O beautiful for patriot 
dream, That sees beyond the years.’’ 
These election officials, like so many 
of our patriots—and we heard from 
Senator DUCKWORTH tonight, a real pa-
triot—did their jobs. Let’s support 
these patriots. Vote against this objec-
tion. 
I yield the floor. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I yield 5 minutes 
to the Senator from Utah, Mr. ROMNEY. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. Today was heart-
breaking, and I was shaken to the core 
as I thought about the people I have 
met in China and Russia and Afghani-
stan and Iraq and other places who 
yearn for freedom and who look to this 
building and these shores as a place of 
hope. I saw the images being broad-
casted around the world, and it breaks 
my heart. 
I have 25 grandchildren. Many of 
them were watching TV, thinking 
about this building, and whether their 
grandpa was OK. I knew I was OK. I 
must tell you, as well, that I am proud 
to serve with these men and women. 
This is an extraordinary group of peo-
ple. I am proud to be a Member of the 
U.S. Senate and meet with people of in-
tegrity as we do here today. 
Now, we gather due to a selfish man’s 
injured pride and the outrage of his

supporters, whom he has deliberately 
misinformed for the past 2 months and 
stirred to action this very morning. 
What happened here today was an in-
surrection that was incited by the 
President of the United States. Those 
who choose to continue to support his 
dangerous gambit by objecting to the 
results of a legitimate and democratic 
election will forever be seen as being 
complicit in an unprecedented attack 
against our democracy. Fairly or not, 
they will be remembered for their role 
in this shameful episode of American 
history. That will be their legacy. 
I salute Senators LANKFORD
and 
LOEFFLER and BRAUN and DAINES and, I 
am sure, others who, in light of today’s 
outrage, have withdrawn their objec-
tions. For any who remain insistent on 
an audit in order to satisfy the many 
people who believe the election was 
stolen, I would offer this perspective: 
No congressional audit is ever going to 
convince 
these 
voters, 
particularly 
when the President will continue to 
say that the election was stolen. The 
best way we can show respect for the 
voters who are upset is by telling them 
the truth. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
That is the burden. That is the duty 
of leadership. The truth is that Presi-
dent-Elect Biden won the election, and 
President Trump lost. I had that expe-
rience myself. It is no fun. 
(Laughter.) 
Scores of courts, the President’s own 
Attorney General, and State elections 
officials, both Republican and Demo-
crat, have reached that unequivocal de-
cision. 
In light of today’s sad circumstances, 
I ask my colleague: Do we weigh our 
own political fortunes more heavily 
than we weigh the strength of our Re-
public, the strength of our democracy, 
and the cause of freedom? What is the 
weight of personal acclaim compared 
to the weight of conscience? 
Leader MCCONNELL said that the vote 
today is the most important in his 36 
years of public service. Think of that 
after his authorizing two wars and vot-
ing against two impeachments. He said 
that not because the vote reveals some-
thing about the election but because 
this vote reveals something about us. 
I urge my colleagues to move forward 
with completing the electoral count, to 
refrain from further objections, and to 
unanimously affirm the legitimacy of 
the Presidential election. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. The Senator from 
New Hampshire, Senator SHAHEEN. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, on 
January 3, I, along with 31 of my col-
leagues, stood in this Chamber and 
swore an oath to support and defend 
the Constitution of the United States. 
It is both ironic and deeply dis-
appointing that only 3 days after 
swearing these oaths, some of my col-
leagues are coming close to breaking 
this promise. 
Since 1797, each U.S. President has 
peacefully handed over power to the 
next, and that will happen again on 
January 20, when Donald Trump, de-
spite the protesters today, the violence 
today—when Donald Trump leaves the 
White House at noon and Joe Biden be-
comes President. 
We have heard tonight from both 
Democrats and Republicans about the 
importance of the voters speaking in 
the election and about the fact that 
there is no evidence of widespread 
voter fraud. But this is not just an 
issue for us here in the United States; 
this is an issue for nascent democracies 
around the world, which, as Senator 
ROMNEY said, look to the United States 
as an example. We are the shining city 
on the hill. We give those struggling 
under oppression hope for a better fu-
ture. 
Now, like so many of us in this 
Chamber, I have traveled to developing 
democracies around the world—to Af-
ghanistan and Iraq, to the Western Bal-
kans, to Africa, to the country of Geor-
gia. I went there with my colleague 
Senator RISCH. 
In 2012, we went to Georgia to ob-
serve officially, on behalf of the Sen-
ate, the election between outgoing 
President Mikheil Saakashvili and his 
United National Movement Party and 
the challenge by Georgian Dream, 
which was a newly formed party sup-
ported and funded by billionaire oli-
garch Bidzina Ivanishvili. It was a bat-
tle for Parliament, but also for control 
of the government. 
Senator RISCH and I visited multiple 
polling places on election day, and we 
agreed with the international assess-
ment that that election was free and 
fair and that Georgian Dream were the 
winners. 
But there was real concern in the 
country that Saakashvili was going to 
refuse to give up power—that that 
would lead to violence, and it would 
end the nascent democratic reforms 
that were happening in that former So-
viet Republic. 
So Senator RISCH and I, the day after 
the election, went to visit President 
Saakashvili to try and talk him out of 
staying in power. I remember very 
clearly going to his home, and we sat 
down with him, and we pointed out 
that the hallmark of a democracy— 
what he had worked so hard for in his 
8 years as President of Georgia—the 
hallmark of that was to turn over 
power in a peaceful election to the per-
son the voters chose. Well, President 
Saakashvili listened to us, and he did 
leave office peacefully. 
But it is important that future gen-
erations recognize that America—like 
democracies everywhere—depends on a 
peaceful transition of power, on believ-
ing in what the voters say, and ensur-
ing that happens. 
Unfortunately, we have heard from 
some Senators today who have been en-
abling President Trump’s willful dis-
regard of the votes of our citizenry, 
even as they speak out against foreign 
leaders who ignore their own people. 
They will fail, and history will re-
member them. 
I hope that future generations will 
view the actions of some of those folks 
today as little more than an unfortu-
nate anomaly. 
Future opportunists may use this ill- 
fated effort to seek short-term polit-
ical gain over the long-term stability 
of our Republic. But for the sake of our 
great country and America’s standing 
in the world, I ask my colleagues today 
to fully endorse the results of the free 
and fair election and set aside this par-
tisan attempt to subvert the will of the 
people. We should be venerating the 
peaceful transition of power, even if 
our own preferred candidate didn’t win. 
That is, after all, who we are in the 
United States of America. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield up to 5 minutes to the Senator 
from Ohio, Senator PORTMAN. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. Vice President, 
you have fulfilled your duties as Presi-
dent of the Senate tonight with dis-
tinction, and we all appreciate it. 
I thought about changing my mind 
and not speaking tonight, given the 
lateness of the hour, and I know all of 
my colleagues would have appreciated 
that greatly. But I thought it was nec-
essary to speak because I want the 
American people, particularly my con-
stituents in Ohio, to see that we will 
not be intimidated, that we will not 
disrupted from our work, that here in 
the citadel of democracy, we will con-
tinue to do the work of the people. Mob 
rule is not going to prevail here. 
Now, let’s face it. We did not reclaim 
this Chamber tonight. Brave and self-
less law enforcement officers stood in 
the breach and ensured that the citadel 
of democracy would be protected and 
that we would be defended, and we are 
deeply grateful for that—as is the Na-
tion. 
I have listened carefully to com-
ments of my colleagues, and I have lis-
tened over the past couple of weeks as 
this issue has been discussed, and I tell 
you, for me, it is not a hard decision. I 
stand with the Constitution. I stand 
with what the Constitution makes 
clear: The people and the States hold 
the power here, not us. 
My oath to the Constitution and my 
reverence for our democratic principles 
make it easy for me to confirm these 
State certifications. 
By the way, I opposed this process 
some 15 years ago, when some Demo-
crats chose to object to the electors 
from my home State of Ohio after the 
2004 elections. I opposed it then, and I 
oppose it now. I said at the time that 
Congress must not thwart the will of 
the people. That is what we would be 
doing.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S27 
January 6, 2021 
Let’s assume for a moment that 
those who object to the certifications 
are right, that the Constitution in-
tended that a bare majority of Mem-
bers of Congress could circumvent the 
States that have chosen to certify the 
popular votes of their own State citi-
zens. I ask the objectors to think about 
the precedent that would be set if we 
were to do that. 
What if the majority in the House 
and the Senate were of the other party 
when a Presidential candidate of our 
party came through a close Presi-
dential election? Would you want a 
Congress controlled by the Democrats 
to play the role you now intend for us? 
It is asking Congress to substitute its 
judgment for the judgment of the vot-
ers and its judgment for the judgment 
of the States that certified the results. 
And even forgetting the dangerous 
precedent that would be set, what 
would be the basis for objecting in this 
election? 
Look, I voted for President Trump. I 
supported him because I believe the 
Trump administration’s policies are 
better for Ohio and for the country. 
And I supported the Trump campaign’s 
right to pursue recounts—they had 
every right to do it—and legal chal-
lenges. 
I agree that there were instances of 
fraud and irregularities in the 2020 
elections. I think we all do. And by the 
way, there are fraud and irregularities 
in every Presidential election. 
But it is also true that after 2 
months of recounts and legal chal-
lenges, not a single State recount 
changed the result. And of the dozens 
of lawsuits filed, not one found evi-
dence of fraud or irregularities wide-
spread enough to change the result of 
the election. This was the finding of 
numerous Republican-appointed judges 
and the Trump administration’s own 
Department of Justice. 
Every State has now weighed in and 
chosen to certify its electoral slate 
based on the popular vote, as set out in 
the Constitution. 
I understand that many Americans 
who would never storm this Capitol 
don’t trust the integrity of the 2020 
election, don’t think the States should 
have certified, don’t think we should 
have accepted the results from the 
States, and are insisting on more 
transparency and accountability. 
In the 2016 elections, lest we forget, 
many Democrats objected to the re-
sults and distrusted the election. 
I challenge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to listen but also to 
do our part to try to restore faith in 
our elections. We should all work to 
improve the integrity of the electoral 
system and the confidence of the Amer-
ican people in this bedrock of our great 
democratic Republic. 
Today, I will do my constitutional 
duty and oppose these efforts to reject 
the State-certified results. 
And tomorrow, in the wake of this 
attack on the Capitol, the pandemic 
that engulfs us, and other national 
challenges, let’s work together for the 
people. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Demo-
cratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I be-
lieve we have 8 minutes left, so I would 
like to divide 4 to Senator KING and 4 
to Senator VAN HOLLEN. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. That is cor-
rect. 
The Senator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, Winston 
Churchill once said that he could do a 
2-hour speech extemporaneously, but a 
10-minute speech took immense prepa-
ration. I don’t know what he would 
have said about a 4-minute speech. 
We are a 240-year anomaly in world 
history. We think that what we have 
here in this country is the way it has 
always been. 
It is a very unusual form of govern-
ment. The normal form of government 
throughout world history is dictators, 
kings, czars, pharaohs, warlords, ty-
rants. And we thought 20 years ago the 
march of history was toward democ-
racy, but it is in retreat in Hungary 
and Turkey—goodness knows, in Rus-
sia. 
Democracy as we have practiced it is 
fragile. It is fragile, and it rests upon 
trust. It rests upon trust in facts. It 
rests upon trust in courts, in public of-
ficials, and, yes, in elections. 
I don’t sympathize or justify or in 
any way—in any way—support—that is 
putting it mildly—what happened here 
today, but I understand it. I under-
stand it because I saw those people 
interviewed today, and they said: We 
are here because this election has been 
stolen. 
And the reason they said that is that 
their leader has been telling them that 
every day for 2 months. 
We cannot afford to pull bricks out 
from the foundation of trust that 
underlies our entire system. And I 
agree with Governor ROMNEY that the 
answer to this problem is to tell people 
the truth—is to tell them what hap-
pened. 
It is easy to confront your opponents. 
It is hard to confront your friends. 
It is hard to tell your supporters 
something they don’t want to hear, but 
that is our obligation. That is why the 
word ‘‘leader’’ is applied to people in 
jobs like ours. It is not supposed to be 
easy. It is supposed to be something 
that we take on as a sacred obligation, 
and if people believe something that 
isn’t true, it is our obligation to tell 
them: No, I am sorry, it isn’t, just as 
Senator PORTMAN just said, as MIKE 
LEE just said: I am sorry we can’t do 
this here. We don’t want to do this 
here. This is a power reserved to the 
States, not to the Congress. 
And I agree with the majority leader. 
I think this is one of the most impor-
tant votes any of us will ever take. 
On December 1, 1862, Abraham Lin-
coln came to this building. He came to 
this building in the darkest days of the 
Civil War. He was trying to awaken the 
Congress to the crisis that we were fac-
ing, and he didn’t feel that they were 
fully and effectively engaged. He ended 
his speech that day with words that I 
think have an eerie relevance tonight. 
Here is what Abraham Lincoln said: 
Fellow-[Americans], we cannot escape his-
tory. We of this Congress and this adminis-
tration, will be remembered in spite of our-
selves. No personal significance, or insignifi-
cance, can spare one or another of us. 
And here are his final words: 
The fiery trial through which we pass will 
light us down in honor or dishonor to the lat-
est generation. 
The fiery trial through which we 
pass, will light us down in honor or dis-
honor to the latest generation. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Thank you, Mr. 
President. The mob violence and at-
tack we saw on our Capitol today 
should be a wake-up call to each and 
every one of us of what happens when 
we fail to come together, not as Demo-
crats and Republicans but each of us as 
Americans, to stand up to a President 
who time and again has shown con-
tempt for our democracy, contempt for 
our Constitution. 
Today, here on the Capitol, we wit-
nessed people taking down an Amer-
ican flag and putting up a Trump flag. 
That is not democracy in the United 
States of America. 
As every Senator who has spoken has 
mentioned, we have for hundreds of 
years had a peaceful transfer of power. 
Nobody likes to lose, and supporters of 
the losing candidate are always dis-
appointed. What is different this time? 
We all know what is different this 
time. We have a President who, as the 
Senator from New Jersey said, even be-
fore a vote was cast, that if he didn’t 
win the election, it was going to be a 
fraud and every day since then has per-
petrated that lie. 
We have a President who just today 
criticized the very loyal Vice Presi-
dent, who is presiding right now, urg-
ing him to disregard his responsibil-
ities under the Constitution of the 
United States in order to reinstall Don-
ald Trump as President; the same per-
son who got on the phone to the sec-
retary of state in Georgia and threat-
ened him to change the results of the 
election. 
Mr. President, I read something this 
week I never thought I would read in a 
newspaper in the United States of 
America. It was an op-ed by all the liv-
ing former Secretaries of Defense, in-
cluding Secretaries Rumsfeld, Cheney, 
and 
Mattis, 
warning—warning—the 
country about our tradition of peaceful 
transfer of power and that it would be 
inappropriate for the military to take 
sides in the United States of America. 
We talk to the world about how we 
want to promote democracy and our 
values, and right here at home too 
many are undermining those values. 
Mr. President, Donald Trump could 
not do this alone. He could only do it if 
he is aided and abetted by individuals

who are willing to perpetrate those lies 
and those conspiracies, and that is why 
it is so important that we as Demo-
crats and Republicans and Senators 
stand up together—stand up together 
and tell the truth. You know when you 
go into a court of law, like those 60 
cases, you are testifying under penalty 
of perjury. That is very different than 
here in the House and the Senate, and 
in all those 60 cases, under penalty of 
perjury, there was no evidence of wide-
spread fraud. So it should be easy for 
us all together to tell the truth. 
On January 20, Joe Biden will be 
sworn in as the next President of the 
United States. He has said he wants to 
bring the country together. He has said 
he wants to bring Democrats and Re-
publicans together to do some of the 
pressing business of this country, to 
defeat this pandemic, to get the econ-
omy going again, to face challenging 
issues of racial and social justice. I 
hope we will learn from what happened 
today—the mob attack on this Cap-
itol—the price we pay when we don’t 
stand up for the truth and for democ-
racy. 
James McHenry, Maryland’s delegate 
to 
the 
Constitutional 
Convention, 
wrote about a famous exchange in his 
diaries 
between 
Elizabeth 
Willing 
Powel and Benjamin Franklin. A lady 
asked Dr. Franklin, ‘‘Well, Doctor, 
what have we got, a Republic or a mon-
archy?’’ 
‘‘A 
republic,’’ 
replied 
Dr. 
Franklin, ‘‘if you can keep it.’’ 
My colleagues, this is a test of 
whether we unite to keep our Republic. 
I hope we will pass the test together. 
Thank you. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President. January 
6, 2021, will forever mark a historic day 
for our Nation. Not simply because our 
beloved 
Capitol 
building—the 
very 
heart of our democracy—laid under 
siege. 
Not 
simply 
because 
rioters 
stormed the Senate and House floors, 
assaulting Capitol Police officers and 
leaving a wake of destruction along the 
way. Not simply because the President 
of the United States encouraged his 
supporters to commit these felonies— 
to march to the Capitol and ‘‘to fight,’’ 
in his words. No, today will also be re-
membered because of what happened 
before all of that. Today, over 100 Mem-
bers of the House and a dozen Senators 
supported a ploy to deprive the States 
and the American people of their con-
stitutional role to choose our next 
President—a ploy that amounts to 
nothing less than an assault on our 
Constitutional republic. 
The President’s obscene claim that 
the election was stolen from him, 
which he continued to spout even while 
his rioting supporters roamed the Halls 
of 
the 
Capitol 
today, 
has 
been 
disproven time and again. Every single 
Senator knows that Vice President 
Biden won the election and did so deci-
sively. Claims that President Trump 
won reelection are not just fantasy; 
they are delusional. And citing voters’ 
mistrust in the election results as 
grounds for this stunt is particularly 
disingenuous given that those concerns 
have been fueled by the President’s 
own baseless conspiracy theories—not 
by the evidence, not by the facts, and 
not by State election administrators, 
both Republicans and Democrats, who 
actually oversaw these elections and 
know what they are talking about. 
President Trump and his allies have 
now lost more than 60 cases in courts 
across the country, by judges of every 
political stripe, including those ap-
pointed by the President. The lopsided-
ness of these decisions has been ex-
traordinary. It has been nothing less 
than a wholesale rejection of the Presi-
dent’s claims. But this is not sur-
prising. The President’s own Attorney 
General said there is no evidence of 
widespread fraud. His own Department 
of Homeland Security described it as 
the ‘‘most secure election in American 
history.’’ 
President Trump serves no one but 
himself. He is not a custodian or guard-
ian of our democracy. He is a man 
whose every decision is driven by his 
shallow self-interest. I did not expect 
him to be gracious in defeat. I expected 
him to throw tantrums. I am not even 
surprised that his rhetoric has incited 
violence, as it has today. That is who 
President Trump is; we have all known 
that for some time. I am surprised and 
disappointed that so many Members of 
this body have let it get this far. After 
he incited rioters and criminal actions 
by a mob attacking America’s symbol 
of democracy, our Capitol, what more 
will he do? He should just leave. He has 
damaged the country enough. 
Our job today is simply to count the 
votes and to certify that Joe Biden won 
the election. Pretending that Congress 
could effectively overturn the will of 
the American people has, predictably, 
poured gasoline on an already lit fire. 
We must now get to work to put this 
fire out. I am glad that Congress is 
taking the first step now—that is, to 
stop with this nonsense and certify this 
election. The next step will be harder. 
The only way we stand a chance of 
coming together as a country, let alone 
making progress for the American peo-
ple, is by working together. 
I am thankful to the many Senate 
Republicans who have forcefully re-
jected this dangerous political stunt, 
even before the violence. Your words 
had meaning and sent a message to the 
country that our democracy will en-
dure. 
I have served in the Senate for 46 
years. I can tell you that history will 
remember this sad day. So let us en-
sure that it is not just remembered for 
the destruction, for the President’s 
recklessness, and for those in Congress 
who so casually attempted to overturn 
the will of the American people. Let us 
work together now and certify this 
election, so this day will also be re-
membered for those who stood up and 
rejected this dangerous political stunt 
for the good of the Republic and for the 
good of the American people. 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN. 
Mr. 
President. 
Today has been a dark day that will 
take a long time and a lot of work to 
overcome. It has been a day truly un-
worthy of our Nation. 
I thank the U.S. Capitol Police, the 
U.S. Secret Service, the law enforce-
ment officers from Washington, DC, 
Maryland, and Virginia, the National 
Guard, and others who have protected 
this institution and the U.S. Congress 
today. 
There will be time to say more about 
today’s events, but I rise now to speak 
about the unprecedented actions today 
to attempt to undermine a fairly and 
properly conducted democratic elec-
tion. 
Under our system of government, 
States bear the primary responsibility 
for runninq elections and certifying 
election results, and that is exactly 
what we have seen—all 50 States and 
the District of Columbia have certified 
the results of the 2020 Presidential 
election. 
The results of the election are clear: 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS won. 
Challenging these electoral votes 
now is the height of hypocrisy for a 
party that prides itself on States’ 
rights. 
Even worse, today’s actions are based 
on the faulty premise that this election 
was somehow tainted by widespread 
fraud, which is flat out wrong. 
Protesting these votes today is a dis-
service to our constitutional order and 
the more than 81 million Americans 
who voted for Joe Biden and KAMALA 
HARRIS. 
We must also recognize that today’s 
actions could echo far beyond this elec-
tion. Our democratic Republic has sur-
vived as a result of certain bedrock 
principles, 
including 
the 
peaceful 
transfer of power and the right of the 
people to elect their leaders. 
For Congress to challenge the legit-
imacy of electoral votes because Presi-
dent Trump is upset that he lost far ex-
ceeds our role as envisioned by our 
Founding Fathers. 
These challenges threaten the very 
core of a functioning democracy—that 
voters and votes matter. 
If a State’s electoral votes can be set 
aside by Congress based on conspiracy 
theories dreamed up by the President 
and his followers, the value of free and 
fair elections is damaged. 
Mr. President, those who feel they 
needed to protest today’s results say 
they do so because of allegations of 
fraud. The problem is, those allega-
tions all originate from President 
Trump himself. 
The Justice Department found no 
evidence of widespread fraud. Attorney 
General Barr himself said there were 
no irregularities that could have af-
fected the outcome of the election. 
Likewise, our courts—including the 
Supreme Court—have tossed out law-
suit after lawsuit filed by President 
Trump and his allies, more than 60 in 
total. 
I appreciate those Republicans Sen-
ators who have stood up for democracy 
and against these baseless objections 
to the election results.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S29 
January 6, 2021 
Senator ROMNEY called it an ‘‘egre-
gious ploy.’’ 
Senator TOOMEY said, ‘‘Allegations of 
fraud by a losing campaign cannot jus-
tify overturning an election.’’ 
Senator PORTMAN
said, ‘‘I cannot 
support allowing Congress to thwart 
the will of the voters.’’ 
And Senator THUNE added, ‘‘It’s time 
for everybody to move on.’’ 
He is right; the election is over. 
President-Elect Biden won. 
Especially now, after all of the 
events of the day. It is truly time to 
get to work repairing our country. 
Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the 
floor. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, ‘‘free, 
fair elections are the lifeblood of our 
democracy. Charges of unfairness are 
serious, but calling an election unfair 
does not make it so. Charges require 
specific allegations and then proof. We 
have neither here.’’ 
Those aren’t my words. Those are the 
words of a judge on the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the Third Circuit, rejecting 
President Trump’s legal challenges to 
the Pennsylvania election—a judge 
who, I might add, was a longtime mem-
ber of the conservative Federalist Soci-
ety and was nominated to the bench by 
President Trump. 
Mr. President, the 2020 presidential 
election 
was 
hard-fought, 
but 
the 
American people spoke clearly and de-
cisively: 81.2 million votes for Joe 
Biden, 74.2 million votes for Donald 
Trump, 51.3 percent of the vote for Joe 
Biden, 46.8 percent of the vote for Don-
ald Trump, 306 electoral college votes 
for Joe Biden, 232 electoral college 
votes for Donald Trump. 
Accepting the outcome of an election 
can be difficult when our political 
party doesn’t win, but calling an elec-
tion unfair does not make it so. 
More than 60 Federal and State 
courts, involving more than 90 judges, 
many of whom were nominated by Re-
publican Presidents, including Presi-
dent Trump, are all in agreement. No 
evidence of widespread fraud, wrong-
doing, or other irregularities have been 
uncovered during the 2020 election. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
our 
col-
leagues today ask us to do the same 
thing Donald Trump asked of the sec-
retary of state of Georgia: to overturn 
the results of the 2020 election without 
specific allegations and without proof. 
Our colleagues are asking us not to 
abide by the will of the people but to 
bend to the will of one man, Donald 
Trump. 
In 1787, delegates from 13 States con-
vened in Philadelphia to debate the fu-
ture of our country. Our Founders dis-
agreed on many things, but they did 
agree that they didn’t want a King, and 
they set up an intricate system of 
checks and balances to ensure that we 
would never have an all-powerful King. 
That system of checks and balances is 
being pushed to a dangerous limit here 
today, but it will prevail. 
Here are just some of the claims Don-
ald Trump and his legal team have 
made and that our colleagues lend cre-
dence to today: that Venezuela, Cuba, 
and China rigged our country’s voting 
machines in favor of Joe Biden; that 
dead people voted in this election and 
they only voted for Joe Biden; and that 
poll watchers and election observers— 
who risked their lives during this pan-
demic to uphold the integrity of our 
elections—stuffed ballot boxes with 
Biden votes and shredded Trump votes. 
Not one—let me repeat—not one of 
these things is true. There is no evi-
dence to back up these ridiculous 
claims. 
Many of these absurd claims from 
Donald Trump and his legal team are 
nothing more than conspiracy theories 
circulating online. This misinforma-
tion and dangerous rhetoric from the 
President and his allies, including calls 
for violence, have polluted our dis-
course and imperiled our peaceful tran-
sition of power. And when our col-
leagues show indifference or outright 
support 
for 
these 
unsubstantiated 
claims and conspiracy theories, they 
lead our nation and our Constitution 
down a dangerous path. We all swore 
an oath to support and defend our Con-
stitution—not our political party, and 
certainly not any individual candidate. 
Colleagues, for the safety of our citi-
zens and our Republic, we must lead by 
example and turn the temperature 
down. It was a hard-fought campaign, 
but the campaign is over, the votes 
have been counted, the count has been 
certified in all 50 States, and in 2 
weeks, on January 20th, Joe Biden and 
KAMALA
HARRIS
will be sworn-in as 
President and Vice-President of the 
United States. 
We have serious and urgent chal-
lenges that will require working with 
our new President and Vice President 
and with one another, including mak-
ing sure hundreds of millions of Ameri-
cans can be vaccinated, getting our 
kids back to school, and getting their 
parents back to work, just to name a 
few. 
It is time to stop trying to overturn 
the will of the people and get back to 
working on their behalf. 
President Lincoln observed at the 
end of the Gettysburg Address that 
ours is a ‘‘government of the people, by 
the people, and for the people.’’ Even in 
the midst of a Civil War, President Lin-
coln put his unwavering faith in ‘‘the 
people’’ to chart our Nation’s course. 
We would be wise to remember Lin-
coln’s words in this moment. We are 
not a government of Trump, by Trump, 
and for Trump. We are a government of 
the people, by the people, and for the 
people. And the people have spoken. 
Our only job today is to listen to them. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, not lik-
ing whom the voters choose to vote for 
in an election does not mean it is a 
fraudulent election. Enabling such talk 
and actively working to disseminate 
false information that cripples our gov-
ernment is in itself a fraud committed 
against the American people and our 
Constitution. 
This past November, the American 
people voted in the highest numbers we 
have seen in our Nation’s history. More 
than 155 million Americans cast a bal-
lot in what was a free and fair election. 
A clear majority voted for former 
Vice President Joe Biden over Presi-
dent Donald Trump. This was not the 
closest election in our Nation’s history 
by a long shot. President-Elect Joe 
Biden won by more than 7 million 
votes. He and Vice President-Elect 
KAMALA
HARRIS
won 
306 
electoral 
votes. Donald Trump and Mike Pence 
received 232 electoral votes. 
Given the tremendous impact the 
COVID–19 pandemic has had on our 
country, everyone should be over-
whelmed that Americans turned out in 
such strong numbers for this election. 
People should not have to choose be-
tween casting their ballot and pro-
tecting their own health and their fam-
ily’s health. The pandemic wreaked 
havoc in so many of our lives for much 
of last year, which is why our election 
officials in most States responded by 
taking 
special 
measures 
and 
pre-
cautions to protect the right to vote 
while safeguarding the health and well- 
being of voters and election judges 
alike. 
Election security officials, Federal 
and those in all 50 States and the Dis-
trict of Columbia—Democrats, Repub-
licans, and Independents—have all cer-
tified that we held a free and fair elec-
tion despite these extraordinary cir-
cumstances. The Department of Home-
land Security, DHS, stated that the 
November 3 election was ‘‘the most se-
cure in American history’’ and that 
‘‘there is no evidence that any voting 
system deleted or lost votes, changed 
votes, 
or 
was 
in 
any 
way 
com-
promised.’’ 
President Trump responded how we 
would expect a would-be autocrat to re-
spond, by firing the head of the DHS 
agency overseeing election security, 
pursuing baseless and groundless law-
suits, and promoting wild conspiracy 
theories about a rigged election. These 
lawsuits repeatedly have been dis-
missed as frivolous by both State and 
Federal judges appointed by both Re-
publican and Democratic Chief Execu-
tives. 
There is simply no evidence of wide-
spread voter fraud claims in this elec-
tion that can credibly affect the out-
come of the election, which even 
former U.S. Attorney General William 
Barr—speaking on behalf of the De-
partment of Justice—acknowledged. In 
December, the electoral college met to 
certify the results, and all of the 
States and the District of Columbia 
have now regularly reported their re-
sults to Congress, pursuant to the 12th 
Amendment to the Constitution. 
In Pennsylvania, a panel of the Third 
Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously 
rejected President Trump’s lawsuit 
making claims that a State court had 
already dismissed. Stephanos Bibas—a 
judge 
whom 
President 
Trump 
ap-
pointed—wrote, ‘‘Free, fair elections

are the lifeblood of our democracy. 
Charges of unfairness are serious. But 
calling an election unfair does not 
make it so. Charges require specific al-
legations and then proof. We have nei-
ther here.’’ 
On Monday, January 4, in the U.S. 
District Court for the District of Co-
lumbia, James Boasberg—whom George 
W. Bush originally appointed to the 
bench—dismissed yet another frivolous 
lawsuit seeking to stop Congress from 
certifying 
President 
President-Elect 
Joe Biden’s victory when it meets in 
joint session to tally the electoral col-
lege votes on Wednesday. 
In a 7-page opinion, Judge Boasberg 
noted that the plaintiffs had filed in 
the wrong court; did not have standing 
to sue; and had made no effort to serve 
defendants with the suit, a legal re-
quirement. He indicated that he was 
contemplating referring the case to the 
Court’s Committee on Grievances ‘‘for 
potential discipline of Plaintiffs’ coun-
sel.’’ More importantly, he wrote, ‘‘the 
suit rests on a fundamental and obvi-
ous misreading of the Constitution.’’ 
He concluded, ‘‘It would be risible were 
its target not so grave: the under-
mining of a democratic election for 
President of the United States.’’ 
After being shut down again and 
again by the courts and State election 
officials—the people who run the elec-
tions—President Trump has continued 
his sordid campaign to undermine the 
rule of law in our Nation. He continues 
to fan the flames of division in our Na-
tion, including encouraging fringe ele-
ments seeking to declare martial law 
or have the military intervene to over-
turn the election results. This dema-
goguery led all 10 former Secretaries of 
Defense who are still living—Repub-
licans and Democrats alike—to warn 
against any attempt to involve the 
military in pursuing claims of election 
fraud, arguing that it would take the 
United States into ‘‘dangerous, unlaw-
ful and unconstitutional territory.’’ 
President Trump and his enablers’ 
ceaseless provocations call into ques-
tion whether we can have a peaceful 
and orderly transition of power in the 
United States. This concern is not the-
oretical, as we saw today, as a lawless 
mob encouraged by the President tem-
porarily took control of our sacred 
Capitol. 
President Trump’s recent phone call 
to pressure the Georgia secretary of 
state to ‘‘find’’ the votes he needs to 
win the State is his latest failure to 
take care that the laws be faithfully 
executed. 
Historically, 
American 
Presidents 
have understood that America is a de-
mocracy and not an autocracy or a cult 
of personality. I find it unfathomable 
that we even need to say that out loud. 
Elected legislators cannot, in good 
conscience, allow President Trump to 
continue to act like a dictator by try-
ing to undermine valid election results 
and trash and burn our Republic on his 
way out of office. 
If a foreign leader acted in such a 
blatant way to overturn legitimate 
election results, the full U.S. Congress 
would forcefully condemn such auto-
cratic and undemocratic moves. 
My congressional colleagues who are 
objecting to the electoral college re-
sults without any evidence or legal 
basis must stop coddling President 
Trump’s insatiable ego. They must re-
member their oath is to the Constitu-
tion and not the President. 
Sixty years ago, John F. Kennedy 
warned that people who foolishly seek 
power by riding the back of the tiger 
ultimately end up inside its belly. Peo-
ple should heed that advice. It is time 
to 
put 
country 
before 
personal 
ambition. 
Mr. 
TILLIS. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
American people should have full faith 
in our election system, which is why I 
led the passage of voter ID legislation 
in North Carolina and why I supported 
President Trump’s right to call for re-
counts and bring challenges to the 
courts. I share the concerns of many 
Americans regarding the lack of secu-
rity of widespread mail-in voting and 
the partisan actions of activist Demo-
cratic lawyers who succeeded in mak-
ing questionable changes to the voting 
process while Americans were already 
casting their ballots. Even if it wasn’t 
enough to change the outcome of the 
election, irregularities and fraud are 
never acceptable, and they should be 
investigated and prosecuted when ap-
propriate. 
The Framers of our Constitution 
made it clear that the power to certify 
elections is reserved to the States, not 
Congress. Refusing to certify State 
election results has no viable path to 
success, and, most importantly, it 
lends legitimacy to the left’s stated 
policy objective of completely federal-
izing elections and eliminating the 
electoral college. Congress should not 
overstep its constitutional authority 
by overturning the results of States 
and the will of American voters, espe-
cially absent legitimate requests from 
States for Congress to intervene. 
It is a precedent we should not set, 
and NANCY PELOSI and CHUCK SCHUMER 
should not have the power to set aside 
electors after the 2024 election and 
overrule Federal courts and the Con-
stitution as they see fit. 
I was proud to support President 
Trump’s agenda and campaign with 
him, and I am deeply disappointed he 
was not reelected despite his success in 
creating jobs, cutting taxes, securing a 
conservative judiciary, reforming the 
VA, and rebuilding our military. Al-
though I certainly wish the results 
were different, Congress cannot change 
them without inflicting irreparable 
damage to our constitutional Republic. 
I will not oppose the certification of 
the electoral college votes, and I will 
not embolden politicians in the future 
to appoint our Presidents instead of 
having the American people duly elect 
them. 
Mr. KELLY. Mr. President. In Amer-
ica, we have fair elections and peaceful 
transitions of power. In America, de-
mocracy prevails over chaos. And in 
America, those who commit violent 
acts against our government are held 
accountable. These are the values that 
I served to defend in the U.S. Navy and 
that I have sworn an oath to uphold in 
the Senate, and they have not failed 
us. 
Our democracy was tested today— 
first, by a baseless objection to Arizo-
na’s electoral votes, despite the fact 
that Arizona’s elections were fairly ad-
ministered and certified by a Repub-
lican Governor, a Democratic Sec-
retary of state, and public servants at 
every level of government and rep-
resenting both political parties; and 
then again when individuals, spurred 
on by the President, stormed the Cap-
itol in an unpatriotic attempt to over-
turn our election. They will fail. To-
night we will count Arizona’s electoral 
votes and those of every other State. 
For centuries, our democracy has 
thrived because after elections we have 
come together to find common ground 
and solve our challenges, and that is 
the work we begin tonight. My focus 
will continue to be on representing Ari-
zonans by working with Republicans 
and Democrats and the incoming ad-
ministration to beat this virus and re-
build our economy. 
Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. President, it is 
the privilege of a lifetime to represent 
the people of Wyoming in this great de-
liberative body. I genuinely look for-
ward to joining each of you to make a 
difference for the American people and 
to uphold my solemn oath to support 
and defend the Constitution. 
Let me be clear. An attack on our 
Capitol is an attack on our Constitu-
tion and democracy itself. I strongly 
condemn the violence that occurred 
today, which did more to thwart the 
democratic process than to protect it. 
Today, many Members of the Senate 
were trying to peacefully use our 
democratic process to ensure each and 
every American’s vote counts. In the 
best tradition of the U.S. Senate, we 
will fulfill our constitutional duty and 
complete the electoral count tonight. 
In 1833, Senator Daniel Webster said 
that ‘‘duty binds . . . the conscience of 
the individual member’’ in counting 
the votes for President and Vice Presi-
dent. Each of us has a solemn duty to 
ensure that the slate of Presidential 
electors we certify is beyond reproach, 
respecting the people’s voice and up-
holding the Constitution. 
Congress will not overturn the peo-
ple’s voice. A president will be inaugu-
rated on January 20. Congress cannot 
and shall not dictate the results of a 
Presidential election to our States. 
That would be the death of our Repub-
lic. 
In the coming months, Congress 
must take a fresh look at troubling 
concerns from the election that simply 
don’t add up. After the 2000 Presi-
dential election, millions of voters in 
Florida felt disenfranchised, and now 74 
million Americans deserve the assur-
ance and the dignity that their votes

count the same as every other Amer-
ican. We owe our first duty to the 
American 
people, 
following 
proce-
dures—like the Electoral Count Act— 
used for nearly 150 years. 
It is my fervent hope that our State 
legislatures will consider meaningful 
election reform to ensure that our elec-
tion laws are applied uniformly, to en-
sure the technology we use is accurate 
and secure, and, most importantly, to 
ensure that all Americans treasure our 
precious right to vote and feel their 
voices are heard. States are at the very 
center of elections in our country and 
will remain so. 
Many ask why Congress should be in-
volved in election matters that have 
been considered by the courts. Some 
argue that Congress’ role in certifying 
our Presidential elections is merely 
ministerial. Under our constitutional 
separation of powers, it is too often 
forgotten that Congress has the right 
and duty to interpret the Constitution, 
especially on matters which by the 
Constitution have been delegated to 
Congress, like the electoral count. Con-
gress interpreted the Twelfth Amend-
ment in passing the Electoral Count 
Act in 1887 and continues to breathe 
new life into these provisions by its ac-
tions today. Our Founders understood 
Congress would play a key role in de-
bating constitutional issues as a co- 
equal branch of government. Thomas 
Jefferson commented in an 1819 letter 
that ‘‘each of the three departments [of 
government] has equally the right to 
decide for itself what is its duty under 
the Constitution.’’ 
I remain deeply concerned that the 
electoral votes of the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania were not ‘‘regularly 
given’’ under Pennsylvania law, as re-
quired by the Electoral Count Act. Se-
rious concerns have been raised about 
the constitutionality of Pennsylvania’s 
vote-by-mail statute. Also, Pennsyl-
vania election law may have been ap-
plied unevenly by State officials, in-
cluding 
signature 
verification 
and 
voter identification requirements. 
In 2005, Senator Barbara Boxer and 
the 
late 
Representative 
Stephanie 
Tubbs Jones objected to the slate of 
electors from Ohio. They rightfully 
drew attention to the fact that many 
African-Americans and other commu-
nities suffered disproportionate wait 
times at the polls, broken voting ma-
chines, and high ballot rejection rates. 
Raising this objection led to some of 
these issues being remedied and more 
Americans having the precious oppor-
tunity to vote. That is a legacy our 
Senate and every American should 
value today. 
Thank you. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield 5 minutes to the Senator from 
South Carolina, Senator GRAHAM. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Many times, my State 
has been the problem. I love it. That is 
where I want to die but no time soon. 
Tim and I have a good relationship. I 
love TIM SCOTT. In 1876, South Caro-
lina, Louisiana, and Florida sent two 
slates of electors—they had two Gov-
ernors, by the way—and we didn’t 
know what to do. Why did South Caro-
lina, Florida, and Louisiana do it? To 
hold the country hostage to end Recon-
struction. It worked. 
The Commission was 8 to 7. It did 
work. Nobody accepted it. The way it 
ended is when Hayes did a deal with 
these three States: You give me the 
electors. I will kick the Union Army 
out. The rest is history. It led to Jim 
Crow. If you are looking for historical 
guidance, this is not the one to pick. 
If you are looking for a way to con-
vince people there was no fraud, having 
a commission chosen by NANCY PELOSI, 
MITCH MCCONNELL, and John Roberts is 
not going to get you to where you want 
to go. It ain’t gonna work. So it is not 
going to do any good. It is going to 
delay, and it gives credibility to a dark 
chapter of our history. That is why I 
am not with you, but I will fight to my 
death for you. You are able to object. 
You are not doing anything wrong. 
Other people have objected. I just 
think it is a uniquely bad idea to delay 
this election. 
Trump and I have had a hell of a 
journey. I hate it being this way. Oh, 
my God, I hate it. From my point of 
view, he has been a consequential 
President. But today, the first thing 
you will see, all I can say is, count me 
out. Enough is enough. I tried to be 
helpful. But when the Wisconsin su-
preme court ruled 4 to 3 that they 
didn’t violate the Constitution of Wis-
consin, I agreed with the three, but I 
accept the four. If Al Gore can accept 5 
to 4 he is not President, I can accept 
Wisconsin 4 to 3. 
Pennsylvania went to the Second Cir-
cuit. So much for all the judges being 
in Trump’s pocket. They said: No, you 
are wrong. I accept the Pennsylvania 
Second Circuit that Trump’s lawsuit 
wasn’t right. 
Georgia, they said the secretary of 
state took the law in his own hands, 
and he changed the election laws un-
lawfully. A Federal judge said no. I ac-
cept the Federal judge, even though I 
don’t agree with it. 
Fraud. They say there is 66,000 people 
in Georgia under 18 voting. How many 
people believe that? I asked: Give me 
10. I haven’t had one. They said 8,000 
felons in prison in Arizona voted. Give 
me 10. I haven’t gotten one. 
Does that say there are problems in 
every 
election? 
I 
don’t 
buy 
this. 
Enough is enough. We got to end it. 
Vice President PENCE, what they are 
asking you to do, you won’t do because 
you can’t. 
Talk about interesting times. I asso-
ciate myself with RAND
PAUL. How 
many times will you hear that? The 
mob has done something nobody else 
could do to get me and Rand to agree. 
Rand is right. If you are a conserv-
ative, this is the most offensive con-
cept in the world that a single person 
could disenfranchise 155 million people. 
[T]he President of the Senate shall, in the 
presence of the Senate and the House of Rep-
resentatives, open all certificates and the 
votes shall then be counted;-The person hav-
ing the greatest number of votes for Presi-
dent shall be President. 
Where in there does it say that Mike 
can say, ‘‘I don’t like the results; I 
want to send them back to the States; 
I believe there was fraud’’? 
To the conservatives who believe in 
the Constitution, now is your chance 
to stand up and be counted. 
Originalism, count me in. It means 
what it says. 
So Mike—Mr. Vice President, just 
hang in there. They said: We can count 
on Mike. All of us can count on the 
Vice President. You are going to do the 
right thing. You are going to do the 
constitutional thing. You have a son 
who flies F–35s. You have got a son-in- 
law flying F–18s. They are out there 
flying so we can get it right here. 
There are people dying, to my good 
friend from Illinois, to make sure we 
have a chance to argue among our-
selves, and when it is over, it is over. It 
is over. 
The final thing. Joe Biden. I have 
traveled the world with Joe. I hoped he 
lost. I prayed he would lose. He won. 
He is the legitimate President of the 
United States. I cannot convince peo-
ple, certain groups, by my words, but I 
will tell you by my actions that maybe 
I, above all others in this body, need to 
say this. Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS 
are lawfully elected and will become 
the President and the Vice President of 
the United States on January the 20th. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority 
leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
yield back the balance of our time.

The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, 
the yeas are 6, the nays are 93. 
The objection is not sustained. 
The Secretary will notify the House 
of the action of the Senate, informing 
that body that the Senate is now ready

counting of the electoral vote for 
President and Vice President. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. So, colleagues, 
here is where we are. We have a few 
more speakers now as we wait for the 
House to finish their debate and vote. 
We expect the House to finish voting 
on Arizona between 11:30 and midnight. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate be in a period of morning business, 
with the following Senators permitted 
to speak therein for up to 5 minutes 
each: Senator TOOMEY, Senator RUBIO, 
and Senator COLLINS. 
Mr. SCHUMER. And on our side, Sen-
ators WYDEN, HIRONO, and COONS. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
f 
OBJECTION 
TO 
COUNTING 
OF 
PENNSYLVANIA 
ELECTORAL 
VOTES 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, I appre-
ciate the indulgence of my colleagues 
allowing me to speak twice today. But 
my understanding is that later this 
evening, objectors will object to the 
certification of Pennsylvania’s elec-
toral votes because they disapprove of 
the process that my State used in the 
last election. So in light of my expec-
tation of this objection, I rise to defend 
the right of my citizens, my constitu-
ents, to vote in the Presidential elec-
tion. 
Let’s be clear. That is exactly what 
this objection is about. It is what it 
would do. It would overturn the results 
of the Presidential election in Pennsyl-
vania, and it would thereby deny Penn-
sylvania’s voters the opportunity to 
even participate in the Presidential 
election. 
Even if Congress did have the con-
stitutional responsibility to judge the 
worthiness of a State’s election proc-
ess, which it does not, rejecting Penn-
sylvania’s electoral votes would still be 
wildly out of proportion to the pur-
ported offenses and very damaging to 
our Republic. 
Let me go through a few facts about 
Pennsylvania. 
First, some of the objectors and, in 
fact, even the President of the United 
States this morning have observed that 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dis-
regarded existing law when it ruled 
that mail-in ballots could be counted 
even if they arrived up to 3 days after 
election day. 
Now, the objectors are right about 
that. In my view, the Supreme Court of 
the United States should overturn that 
illegal decision. But only 10,097 ballots 
arrived in Pennsylvania during the 3 
days after the election, and those 10,097 
ballots have been excluded from the 
vote count that resulted in President- 
Elect Biden winning Pennsylvania by 
about 80,000 votes. What greater rem-
edy could the objectors possibly want 
than the complete exclusion of the 
late-arriving ballots? How could we 
possibly invalidate the entire Pennsyl-
vania election over 10,000 votes that 
were not even included in the vote 
count? 
A second charge we heard—and the 
Senator from Missouri alluded to it 
this evening—is that a 2019 Pennsyl-
vania law that allows mail-in ballots 
for any reason—that that might vio-
late the Pennsylvania Constitution. 
First of all, as Senator CASEY observed, 
this was a bipartisan law passed with 
nearly unanimous Republican support. 
Clearly, the State legislators and the 
Governor believe it is consistent with 
the Pennsylvania Constitution. 
Secondly, this law was not chal-
lenged when it was passed. It wasn’t 
challenged when it was applied during 
the June primary election. It was chal-
lenged only after President Trump lost 
the general election. But 2.6 million 
Pennsylvanians voted by mail-in ballot 
in the general election. Over 37 percent 
of Pennsylvania voters, in good faith, 
relied on a law to cast their votes, as 
they had done previously. Now, I un-
derstand you can make a theoretical 
argument about whether this is con-
sistent with Pennsylvania’s Constitu-
tion, and that needs to be resolved for 
future elections. But because of this 
constitutional question that some peo-
ple have, the objectors want to prevent 
Pennsylvania voters from participating 
in the Presidential election entirely. 
That would be an outrageous remedy 
to this purported offense. 
A third charge we have heard is that 
Pennsylvania officials did not properly 
implement Pennsylvania election law 
in a variety of other ways. But the 
Trump campaign has shown that many 
of these issues have—well, first of all, 
none 
of 
these 
issues 
would 
have 
changed the election outcome, but 
more importantly, the campaign had 
many opportunities, of which it availed 
itself, to litigate these issues. They did 
time and again, and they lost repeat-
edly, often in unanimous, bipartisan 
decisions. 
Some of the objectors also cite 
Congress’s own failure to investigate 
allegations of election irregularities, 
and that is their justification for refus-
ing to certify the election results. But 
the allegations of election irregular-
ities and fraud have been investigated. 
They have been adjudicated. They were 
adjudicated in the States in which they 
were alleged to have occurred. 
In Pennsylvania, the Trump cam-
paign took their case of election irreg-
ularities into the courtroom of Judge 
Matthew Brann of the Federal district 
court. Judge Brann is a conservative 
Republican Federalist Society member. 
Here is what he said about the Trump 
campaign case: 
This 
court 
has 
been 
presented 
with 
strained legal arguments without merit and 
speculative accusations . . . unsupported by 
evidence. In the United States of America, 
this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of 
a single voter, let alone all [the] voters of 
the sixth most populated state. 
So the campaign then appealed Judge 
Brann’s decision to the Third Circuit, 
and they drew a three-judge panel, all 
Republican-appointed judges, one ap-
pointed by President Trump. The panel 
concurred with Judge Brann. 
Certainly there were irregularities in 
this election—there always are—but 
there is no evidence of significant 
fraud, conspiracies, or even significant 
anomalies that cast any serious doubt 
on who actually won the election. 
You know, one of the ways you can 
tell is to look at the big picture in 
Pennsylvania. Look at what happened. 
In 2016, President Trump won Pennsyl-
vania by eight-tenths of 1 percent. In 
2020, he lost Pennsylvania by a little 
over 1 percent. Is there anything at all 
that is implausible or surprising about 
a 2-percent change in the election out-
come? 
Relative to 2016, in Pennsylvania the 
President lost a little ground in most 
of the rural counties he had carried. He 
lost a lot of ground in the big suburban 
counties, and he slightly narrowed his 
large loss in Philadelphia. There are no 
surprises here. This reflects a pattern 
that occurred all across the country. 
My colleagues, as I have said, it is 
not our responsibility to sit in judg-
ment of State election procedures in 
the first place, but if it were, there 
would not be nearly sufficient reason 
to deny my constituents their right to 
participate in this Presidential elec-
tion. 
Joe Biden won the election. That is 
not what I had hoped for, but that is 
what happened. It was an honest vic-
tory with the usual minor irregular-
ities that occur in most elections. 
We witnessed today the damage that 
can result when men in power and re-
sponsibility refuse to acknowledge the 
truth. We saw bloodshed because the 
demagogue chose to spread falsehoods 
and sow distrust of his own fellow 
Americans. Let’s not abet such decep-
tion. Let’s reject this motion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S33 
January 6, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, with just 
a few minutes to speak, I am going to 
get right to the point. 
Gunfire in the halls here, IEDs on the 
Capitol grounds—I will say to my col-
leagues, with the domestic terrorists 
roaming the halls just a few hours ago, 
I have been stunned that this debate is 
actually going forward, and that is be-
cause, colleagues, this is a fake debate 
on electoral certifications; that is be-
cause it lends credibility to the bogus 
idea that the Congress can actually 
toss out the results of the election, 
and, as we saw today, it serves to fuel 
insurrection. 
Contrary to what some of my ‘‘aye’’ 
voting colleagues believe by votes cast 
just a few minutes ago, this debate has 
never been about setting up some kind 
of routine election tribunal. This isn’t 
about election security. If the Republic 
majority for the last 2 years had actu-
ally been interested in election secu-
rity, they would not have worked re-
lentlessly to block my legislation to 
secure our 2020 elections with hand- 
marked paper ballots and post-election 
security audits. 
By the way, those are the kinds of 
approaches that are part of the Oregon 
system, where for 25 years we voted by 
mail. I am the Nation’s first mail-in 
U.S. Senator. The second—and I see my 
colleagues from Maine and Alaska here 
because they are very fond of him, like 
I am—Gordon Smith, a Republican, 
was the second mail-in U.S. Senator in 
our country. That is because we do the 
job right. It is efficient. 
Our 
late-Republican 
secretary 
of 
state, Dennis Richardson, actually told 
President Trump there was no evidence 
of fraud. 
So if Republicans had been interested 
over the last 2 years in actually work-
ing with me and colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle and secretaries of 
state, we could have had an approach 
that would have empowered the Oregon 
idea to go national. Instead, we are 
now debating tonight the idea of—a 
discussion grounded in total fiction, 
brewed in cauldrons of conspiracies on-
line. 
These, 
colleagues, 
are 
fever 
dreams—fever dreams laundered by 
people with election certificates and 
real power. And I will tell you, it has 
been painful to watch colleagues sidle 
up to some of those conspiracies that 
would inflict so much damage on the 
American experiment. 
Colleagues, I am going to close with 
one last point. We saw today an effort 
by domestic terrorists to try to punch 
our democracy to the ground, to the 
ropes. I am going to close by simply 
saying something that hadn’t been said 
tonight, and that is that Donald Trump 
can do enormous damage to our coun-
try in the next 2 weeks. In the next 2 
weeks, colleagues, Donald Trump can 
do enormous damage to our wonderful 
country. 
This afternoon—I don’t know if my 
colleagues saw it—the National Asso-
ciation of Manufacturers—an organiza-
tion with thousands of businesses, 
thousands of companies, and not ex-
actly a leftwing outfit—they called for 
moving forward with the 25th Amend-
ment. That was all over the news al-
ready this afternoon, colleagues. The 
National Association of Manufacturers. 
That is what we are seeing in our coun-
try with respect to the fear of Ameri-
cans, having watched what happened 
here. 
I am just going to close by way of 
saying that I believe that for the next 
2 weeks, we have an enormous respon-
sibility to watchdog Donald Trump day 
in and day out, to do everything pos-
sible to prevent the kinds of abuses 
that we saw today, where an American 
lost her life, and we saw the fear 
among our citizens at what went on. 
Let’s do everything we can as leaders, 
Democrats and Republicans, to make 
sure that in the next 2 weeks, Donald 
Trump’s abuses are checked and we do 
everything we can to protect this won-
derful Nation of ours. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida is recognized. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. President, over the 
last weeks and days leading up to this 
vote here today, I have heard from a 
lot of people about this vote, and I 
guess I want to address it as much to 
them as anybody else. These are people 
I know. These are friends. These are 
neighbors. These are longtime sup-
porters, generally people on my side of 
the political aisle. 
And they are upset. They are upset. 
They look at the media, and the media, 
they censored stories that might have 
been negative toward Joe Biden or 
were negative toward Joe Biden, and 
social media companies helped them 
out. And they saw how some States 
tinkered with and even mutilated 
State election laws, and they have 
doubts that the election was legiti-
mate. 
It gives this country this extraor-
dinary crisis of confidence, which is 
very dangerous because democracy is 
very fragile, and it is not held together 
by elections. Democracy is held to-
gether by people’s confidence in the 
election and their willingness to abide 
by its results. 
So the notion was we need to do 
something; we need to fight. Several of 
my colleagues have adopted the idea— 
and I respect it—that they are going to 
object. 
Now, listen, it is important to under-
stand something. Even the people ob-
jecting in the Senate recognize that it 
is not going to pass. It is not going to 
change the outcome, but it is going to 
send a message, and it is going to make 
a point. 
The problem is I think it is a terrible 
idea at this moment. Just hours ago, a 
young lady died in this Capitol. That 
means somebody, somewhere in this 
country, got a phone call that their 
daughter was dead. Their daughter was 
going to a political rally; she is dead— 
died in this Capitol, somewhere not far 
from where we are standing. 
We had police officers—the men and 
women we walk by every single day, 
who guard the doors and we say hello 
to—out there with riot gear getting 
spit on and attacked today—not 10 
weeks ago; just a few hours ago. I 
think it is important to think about all 
those things on a night like tonight 
with everything that has happened. 
I wouldn’t even be here today—I 
doubt very much whether I would have 
even been interested in politics—had it 
not been for my grandfather. He died 
when I was 14, but I grew up at his 
knee. He would sit on the porch and 
would smoke three cigars a day, and he 
loved history. 
He was born in 1899 in rural Cuba. It 
was still governed by the United 
States. It was a protectorate. Three 
years later, it gained its independence 
and became a republic. 
During my grandfather’s first 60 
years of life, he saw his country have 
an armed insurrection after a con-
tested election, multiple Presidents go 
into exile, two military coups, and the 
rise of a Marxist dictator—a tyranny 
that stands to this day. 
My entire life—my entire life I have 
lived with and next to people who came 
to America because their country was 
chaotic and their country was unsafe. 
What I saw today—what we have seen— 
looks more like those countries than 
the extraordinary Nation that I am 
privileged to call home, and I think 
about the mockery that it makes of 
our country. 
A lot of people say: Oh, well, China, 
China. Let me just say something. In 
all modesty, no one here has worked 
harder on the issue of China. They hate 
my guts. I am sanctioned—I don’t 
know what they are sanctioning—dou-
ble sanctioned, and I can’t travel there. 
I wasn’t planning to anyway. 
China is laughing. They are loving 
this tonight. In Beijing they are high- 
fiving because they point to this and 
they say: This is proof the future be-
longs to China. America is in decline. 
Vladimir 
Putin—there 
is 
nothing 
Vladimir Putin could have come up 
with better than what happened here. 
It makes us look like we are in total 
chaos and collapse—not to mention the 
Ayatollah, who is probably bragging, if 
he has buddies, to his buddies: Look 
what is happening to the Great Satan. 
I think politics has made us crazy. 
Everybody in this country has lost 
their minds on politics, and we have 
forgotten that America is not a govern-
ment, America is not a President, 
America is not a Congress. 
Let me tell you what America is. 
America is your family. America is 
your faith. America is your commu-
nity. That is America. That is what our 
adversaries don’t understand, and that 
is what we need to remember. That is 
how we are going to rebuild this coun-
try and turn the page and have a future 
even brighter than our past. 
So that is why I feel so strongly 
about this and why I hope those who 
disagree with me will understand.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S34 
January 6, 2021 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii is recognized. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, it has 
been hard, at times, to find the words 
to describe the full harm that Donald 
Trump has inflicted on our country. We 
can spend hours dissecting how his 
policies have made us less safe and less 
healthy, but his Presidency has also 
been a profound moral failure. 
Let me tell you a story. A few years 
ago, a father from Hawaii joined me at 
one of my talk-story sessions in my of-
fice, and he asked me a question that 
struck me hard at that time and has 
stuck with me until today. He said: 
How can I tell my son that lying is not 
OK when the President of the United 
States lies every single day? I strug-
gled to answer his question then, and I 
am not sure I could offer an adequate 
answer now. 
But this conversation remains a clear 
example of how we do not live in nor-
mal times. How is it normal as we and 
the world watched in horror as an 
angry mob stormed the U.S. Capitol? 
Blood was shed. People were hurt. Van-
dalism occurred. 
It is not normal when we have a 
President who lies every single day. 
And even in the face of this vandalism, 
this mob, he really doesn’t have much 
to say except: I love you. You should 
go home now. 
It is not normal when, in the middle 
of a pandemic that has claimed the 
lives of over 350,000 Americans, which 
is nearly the combined population of 
the islands of Maui and the Big Island, 
we have a President who only seems to 
care about spreading conspiracies to 
undermine confidence in our elections 
and our democracy. 
It is not normal when duly elected 
Senators who took an oath to uphold 
the Constitution pull a stunt to try and 
nullify millions of votes in six States 
so that Donald Trump can remain 
President. I call this effort a stunt be-
cause it is doomed to fail. 
We have a strong bipartisan major-
ity, as noted in the vote that we just 
took, in both Chambers of Congress 
who reject this stunt, and courts have 
ruled against Trump and his allies in 
more than 60 cases. 
So whenever this farce ends, the re-
sult will be the same: Donald Trump 
will have lost the election, and Joe 
Biden will become the 46th President of 
the United States. 
You can tell a lot about a person 
from the way they handle defeat. The 
way Donald Trump has handled defeat 
says a lot about who he is. Watching so 
many of our colleagues indulge the 
President tells us a lot about them too. 
We don’t have to look back very far 
in history to find examples of can-
didates who lost tough races but dem-
onstrated their character in defeat. 
Our colleague Senator ROMNEY
gra-
ciously conceded his defeat to Presi-
dent Obama in noting: 
At a time like this, we can’t risk partisan 
bickering and political posturing. Our lead-
ers have to reach across the aisle to do the 
people’s work, and we citizens also have to 
rise to the occasion. 
And in 2000, during an election with 
substantial irregularities and partisan 
intervention from the Supreme Court, 
Al Gore, nevertheless, put his country 
first and he said: 
Let there be no doubt, while I strongly dis-
agree with the Court’s decision, I accept it. 
. . . And tonight, for the sake of our unity as 
a people and the strength of our democracy, 
I offer my concession. 
As I reflect on the service of these 
distinguished public servants and the 
acts they took to maintain our democ-
racy, I am also drawn to remarks 
President Obama made 4 years ago in 
his farewell address to the Nation when 
he warned that our democracy is 
threatened whenever we take it for 
granted. 
It is a particularly sage warning as 
we contend with the President of the 
United States seeking to nullify a free 
and fair election simply because he 
lost. We have to stand up, speak out, 
and fight back because our democracy 
itself is at stake. 
American democracy has endured 
over these centuries in large part be-
cause our institutions serve as guard-
rails to keep us from going over the 
cliff. As elected officials, we can 
strengthen these guardrails by listen-
ing to our own conscience in moments 
of peril, by having what our friend 
John Lewis called ‘‘an executive ses-
sion with myself.’’ 
Before making a big decision, John 
would say: Listen self, this is what you 
must do; this is where you must go. 
Today, we can follow John’s example, 
listen to our conscience, stand up for 
our Constitution, and do what is right. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine is recognized. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, let me 
begin my remarks tonight by express-
ing my heartfelt gratitude to the mem-
bers of the law enforcement commu-
nity and the National Guard whose 
hard work and courage made it possible 
for us to resume our deliberations to-
night. 
We return to this Chamber tonight 
undeterred by the violence we wit-
nessed and strengthened in our deter-
mination to fulfill our constitutional 
duty. The Constitution is the founda-
tion of our American democracy, and 
the Constitution is what must guide 
our decisions on the Presidential elec-
tion. 
The process the Constitution sets 
forth for electing Presidents through 
the 
electoral 
college 
is 
straight-
forward. The people vote. Electors are 
chosen. The electors vote. Then Con-
gress counts the electors’ votes. 
That final step in the process is why 
we have convened today. Counting the 
votes of the electors, a function that 
the 12th Amendment assigns to Con-
gress, is an administrative and largely 
ceremonial act. Our job is simply to 
count the votes certified by each 
State—nothing more. We should not 
attempt to usurp the roles of the vot-
ers, the States, or the electoral college. 
The American people have done their 
job, turning out in record numbers to 
vote in the midst of a frightening pan-
demic. Indeed, as a percentage of the 
voting-eligible population, the turnout 
was the highest in 120 years. Similarly, 
in the midst of this pandemic, hun-
dreds of election officials and volun-
teers have done their job, staffing poll-
ing places and faithfully counting and 
often recounting votes. The States 
have done their job by certifying the 
election results. 
Now, I have heard the proponents of 
these objections raise questions about 
whether the various States conducted 
their elections properly. When disputes 
over elections arise, candidates are 
able to appeal to our legal system, not 
Congress, for recourse. 
In the 2 months since the 2020 elec-
tion, the President’s lawyers and allies 
have had the opportunity to make 
their arguments and challenge election 
results before the courts. Notably, 
every one of nearly 60 lawsuits they 
have brought forward have been re-
jected. In fact, the Supreme Court has 
twice refused to hear their election 
challenges. 
We must abide by these rulings. The 
time has now come for Congress to do 
its job. We should affirm the certified 
results of each State by counting the 
votes of their electors. Altering the re-
sults of the electoral college would set 
a terrible precedent in which the party 
in control of Congress could override 
the will of the voters and overrule our 
courts to unilaterally choose the next 
President. One Senator attempted such 
a maneuver after the election in 2004, 
and the Senate overwhelmingly re-
jected that effort. The Senate has dem-
onstrated by its vote tonight that it 
will follow that precedent and do so 
again. 
Today—tonight, Mr. President, I will 
continue to vote to reaffirm the foun-
dation of our democracy, the Constitu-
tion of the United States. And I will re-
ject these challenges to the electoral 
college. 
Thank you, Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon is recognized. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I in-
vite all of my colleagues to cast your 
eyes upon these three boxes sitting on 
the table in front of the dais. These 
three boxes contain the certified re-
sults from every State in our Union re-
garding how that State voted, how 
their electors have voted for the Presi-
dent of the United States of America. 
You cast your eyes on these three 
boxes, and you know that there is 
something special. You see that there 
are straps on them holding the top on 
and straps around the side and they are 
engraved—beautiful handle, beautiful 
leather work, crafted in the cabinet 
shop of our very Senate to say to the 
world that their cargo is precious. 
There are three of these boxes. The 
third box is brand new. It was crafted

January 6, 2021 
because so many States were cele-
brating this process that they started 
to use very large forms, very large en-
velopes, very large seals to put those 
ballots into and, thus, a third box was 
needed. These boxes contain the voice 
of the American people weighing in, as 
they have election after election after 
election. They have been used—these 
two smaller boxes—for the last 14 elec-
tions. They are transported through 
those doors to the House of Represent-
atives, where the Senate and House 
gather to witness the opening of the 
envelopes to determine who will be the 
President of the United States. It is 
our constitutional responsibility to 
witness the counting. That is what the 
Constitution calls for. 
Tonight, when this Senate Chamber 
was under attack by domestic terror-
ists, we were held here in this room, 
doors locked to protect us with the 
help of the Capitol Police. They did an 
excellent job. And then they escorted 
us to a safe room. That announcement 
came quickly. And when that an-
nouncement came, our senior assistant 
parliamentarian, Leigh Hildebrand, or-
ganized the team to rescue these boxes 
and keep them safe. 
Thank you to her and the entire 
team that rescued the voice of the 
American people. Had they not done so, 
then 
the 
hooligans 
outside, 
dis-
respecting 
the 
Constitution, 
would 
have come in here and opened these 
boxes and burned the ballots, destroy-
ing the voice of the people symboli-
cally. I know no one in this Chamber 
wanted something like that to happen 
because we are here to defend the Con-
stitution, to defend the integrity of the 
election process, not to allow it to be 
destroyed. 
But, colleagues, although we are 100 
Senators—or 99, actually, now because 
there are only 99 of us who are duly 
elected at the moment. We are 99 Sen-
ators united across party, defending 
these ballots from the hooligans out-
side. 
There is more than one way these 
ballots can be destroyed, and that is 
for this Chamber and the House Cham-
ber to vote that one of those envelopes 
representing the State will be shred-
ded, will be burned, that those votes 
will be discounted. 
We just held a vote on whether or not 
the envelope containing the electoral 
votes from Arizona should be burned. 
We defended these ballots against the 
hooligans outside, but there are those 
in this Chamber supporting the de-
struction of the voice of the citizens of 
Arizona—six voted. And we are coming 
back later tonight to vote on whether 
to shred or burn the ballots for the peo-
ple of Pennsylvania. 
We have to stand together to say ab-
solutely not. The constitutional re-
sponsibility is for us to defend the 
process, not to proceed to destroy these 
ballots. 
Now, in spite of all the troubling 
things that have happened in this 
Chamber this evening, something beau-
tiful happened, and that is, we sat here 
in this Chamber, all of us listening to 
each other, 5-minute speeches, hearing 
each other out, diverse views, wrestling 
with a complicated issue. It is really 
the first time that has happened in the 
12 years I have served in the Senate. 
We need to restore the process of 
struggling with America’s issues to-
gether on the floor of the Senate. That 
is the Senate I saw when I first came 
here as an intern for my home State 
Senator in 1976. That is the Senate that 
I saw when I worked for Congress in 
the 1980s. That is the Senate that has 
disappeared. 
There is a conversation going for-
ward between Democrats and Repub-
licans to restore the ability to hold de-
bate on the floor, to restore the ability 
to have amendments on the floor so 
that we deliberate and wrestle with—in 
a very public and transparent fashion— 
the big issues. 
So let’s take this moment, when we 
are rethinking how to restore the insti-
tutions of our government, to restore 
and improve how this Senate operates 
to deal with the issues ahead of us, so 
that this moment is a moment where 
we come together rather than be di-
vided; where, in a bipartisan fashion, 
we craft a strategy to restore issues to 
the floor—bills and amendments—and 
debate and decisions before the public. 
Out of a dark moment can shine a 
bright light, a renewal, and it is a mo-
ment much needed now—a moment 
much needed in the executive branch 
as we, on the 20th of January, welcome 
new leadership. 
And it is a moment much needed for 
us to restore the Senate to be the de-
liberative body once renowned and re-
spected around the world. Let’s defend 
these ballot boxes, both from the hooli-
gans outside and those who would vote 
to destroy the ballots from any given 
State. And let us come together and re-
store the Senate and fight for the vi-
sion of our ‘‘we the people’’ Republic. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware is recognized. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, ‘‘Free, 
fair elections are the lifeblood of our 
democracy. Charges on fairness are se-
rious.’’ I think we will all agree. ‘‘But 
calling an election unfair does not 
make it so. Charges require specific al-
legations and then [they require] proof. 
We have neither here.’’ 
Those are not my words. Those are 
the words of a judge on the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit 
rejecting President Trump’s legal chal-
lenges to the Pennsylvania election. I 
might add, a judge who was a longtime 
member of the conservative Federalist 
Society and was nominated to the 
bench by none other than Donald 
Trump. 
The 2020 Presidential election was 
hard-fought—we will all agree. But the 
American people spoke clearly, and 
they spoke decisively: 81.2 million vot-
ers voted for Joe Biden—81.2; 74.2 mil-
lion voted for Donald Trump; 51.3 per-
cent of the vote went for Joe Biden; 
46.8 percent of the vote was for Donald 
Trump; 306 electoral college votes for 
Joe Biden; 232 electoral college votes 
for Donald Trump. Four years earlier, 
Donald Trump referred to that kind of 
outcome as a ‘‘landslide’’ for him, and 
he lost the popular vote by 3 million 
votes. 
But accepting the outcome of the 
election can be difficult when our po-
litical party doesn’t win. We have all 
felt that before. But calling an election 
unfair does not make it so. More than 
60 Federal and State courts involving 
more than 90 judges—many of whom 
were nominated by Republican Presi-
dents, including Donald Trump—are all 
in agreement. That is pretty amazing, 
isn’t it? All in agreement. No evidence 
of widespread fraud, wrongdoing, or 
other irregularities have been uncov-
ered during the 2020 election. That is a 
victory for democracy, for our democ-
racy. 
Unfortunately, 
some 
of 
our 
col-
leagues today ask us to do the same 
thing that Donald Trump asked of the 
secretary of state for the State of 
Georgia—to overturn the results of the 
2020 election without specific allega-
tions and, more importantly, without 
any proof. Our colleagues are asking us 
not to abide by the will of the people 
but to bend to the will of one man—one 
man—Donald Trump. 
In 1787, delegates from the Thirteen 
Colonies convened in Philadelphia to 
debate the future of what would be-
come the United States of America. 
Our Founders disagreed on a lot of 
things, but, you know, they all agreed 
on one thing for sure: They did not 
want a King; they did not want a Mon-
arch. Many of them had been there, 
done that. They didn’t want to see it 
and feel it again, and they set up this 
intricate system of checks and bal-
ances to ensure that we would never 
have that all-powerful King in this 
country. 
That system of checks and balances 
is being pushed to a dangerous limit 
here today, but that system will pre-
vail—along with it, our democracy. 
Here are just some of the claims Don-
ald Trump and his legal team have 
made and that our colleagues lend cre-
dence to here today: that Venezuela, 
Cuba, and China rigged our country’s 
voting machines in favor of Joe Biden; 
that dead people voted in this election, 
and they only voted for Joe Biden; that 
poll watchers and election observers 
who risked their lives during this pan-
demic to uphold the integrity of our 
elections stuffed ballot boxes with 
Biden votes, and then they shredded 
Trump votes. 
Not one—let me repeat—not one of 
these things is true. There is no evi-
dence—no evidence—to back up these 
ridiculous claims. Many of these ab-
surd claims from Donald Trump and 
his legal team are nothing more than 
conspiracy theories circuiting online. 
This misinformation and dangerous 
rhetoric from the President and his al-
lies—including calls for violence—have

polluted our discourse and imperiled 
our peaceful transfer of power. 
When our colleagues show indiffer-
ence to outright support for these un-
substantiated claims and conspiracy 
theories, they lead our Nation and our 
Constitution down a dangerous, dan-
gerous path. 
All of us who serve here swore an 
oath to support and defend our Con-
stitution. I swore that same oath as a 
naval flight officer many times and as 
midshipman before that. But all of us 
here have sworn to support and defend 
our Constitution, not our political 
party and certainly not any individual 
candidate. 
Colleagues, for the safety of our citi-
zens and our Republic, we must lead by 
example. We must turn the tempera-
ture down. It was a hard-fought cam-
paign, but the campaign is over. The 
votes have been counted. The count has 
been certified in all 50 States. 
In 2 weeks, on January 20, Joe Biden 
and KAMALA HARRIS will be sworn in as 
President and Vice President of the 
United States, as they should be. We 
have serious and urgent challenges 
that will require working together 
with our new President and new Vice 
President, with one another in this 
Chamber—Democrats, 
Republicans, 
and Independents—and with our col-
leagues over in the House of Represent-
atives. 
What is on our ‘‘to do’’ list? 
We can start with making sure that 
hundreds of millions of Americans get 
vaccinated—that we get off the dime 
and start vaccinating. We vaccinated 4 
million people last month. We were 
supposed to have vaccinated 20 million. 
How are we ever going to get to 250 
million at this rate? 
What else is on our ‘‘to do’’ list? 
We are getting our kids back to 
school. We have kids who are unable to 
get on the internet, who are unable to 
participate in their classes, and who 
may not have any adult supervision at 
home. They are struggling, and they 
are falling even further behind. We 
need to do something to help them. 
What else is on our ‘‘to do’’ list?— 
getting their parents back to work, 
just to name a few things. Think of all 
of the millions of people who have lost 
jobs and don’t have skills anymore to 
fill the jobs that are needed. They need 
our help. They need to be retooled and 
retrained. It is time to stop over-
turning the will of the people. Let’s get 
back to working on their behalf. 
Abraham Lincoln has been quoted a 
couple of times here tonight, but he ob-
served at the end of the Gettysburg Ad-
dress that ours is a ‘‘government of the 
people, by the people, for the people.’’ 
Even in the midst of a civil war, Presi-
dent Lincoln put his unwavering faith 
in the people to chart our Nation’s 
course. We would be wise to remember 
Lincoln’s words at this moment, at 
this special moment, in our Nation’s 
history. 
We are not a government of Trump, 
by Trump, and for Trump. We are a 
government of the people, by the peo-
ple, and for the people, and the people 
have spoken. The people have spoken. 
Our job here today is to listen to them. 
I intend to do that. I trust that my col-
leagues will join me in doing that as 
well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, first, I 
want to thank all of the first respond-
ers who helped to protect this sacred 
Chamber today and protect those elec-
toral college ballots. 
Today is a special day. On a day 
when some 2,500 or more Americans 
will lose their lives to the coronavirus, 
when another 130,000 will be hospital-
ized with it, when hundreds of small 
businesses will close their doors and 
put thousands of Americans out of 
work—on this day—the U.S. Senate is 
not debating how to get more life-
saving vaccines into Americans’ arms 
or how to put 2,000 badly needed dollars 
into their pockets. No. Instead, we are 
using the first days of the new Senate 
and Congress to give time to our rad-
ical Republican colleagues’ baseless 
and 
damaging 
claims 
of 
election 
fraud—all in an attempt to keep Don-
ald Trump in office in violation of the 
U.S. Constitution. There is a word for 
this. It is called ‘‘sedition.’’ All of 
these unfounded objections to State 
electors are seditious. They are noth-
ing short of an insurrection against the 
established order of the U.S. Constitu-
tion and our democratic Republic. 
This is a historically shameful day 
for the Senate and for our country. To 
be clear, the notion that there is any 
meaningful voter fraud that has been 
identified in the 2020 Presidential elec-
tion is a dangerous, anti-democratic, 
treasonous fiction. Joe Biden won. 
Donald Trump lost—period—but that 
hasn’t stopped the President and his 
supporters from making allegations of 
voter fraud in some 60 legal challenges 
across the country, heard by some 90 
judges, including Trump judicial ap-
pointees. Not one of these challenges 
succeeded—not one. Despite this re-
ality, 
my 
radical 
Republican 
col-
leagues claim we must have a commis-
sion to investigate the fraud. 
Well, we do know one of the most un-
deniable instances of substantial and 
significant election fraud ever. We even 
have a recording and a transcript of it. 
It is of President Trump, talking like a 
Mafia boss to the Georgia Secretary of 
State—a 
Republican 
no 
less—pres-
suring and threatening him to fix the 
election in Trump’s favor, and holding 
out the prospect of criminal prosecu-
tion if he doesn’t. 
‘‘Find me 11,780 votes,’’ Trump said. 
Well, someone should find Donald 
Trump a real lawyer and measure him 
for an orange jumpsuit, because the 
list of statutes that this latest, shock-
ing Presidential phone call may violate 
is too long to recite. The President’s 
words on that phone call—indeed, his 
conduct since his election—demand a 
serious response, one much more seri-
ous than the sham before us today. 
First, Federal and State law enforce-
ment authorities should investigate 
Donald Trump for election fraud, ex-
tortion, 
conspiracy, 
and 
whatever 
other charges fit the bill and, if war-
ranted, indict and try him for any 
crimes he has committed. 
Second, we must recognize that Don-
ald Trump is and will remain a danger 
to our Constitution and our democ-
racy. So, while time is certainly lim-
ited, we should impeach Trump again 
and bar him from holding office in the 
future. 
Finally, we should abolish the elec-
toral college. It is a vestige of a racist 
Jim Crow America, and we have out-
grown it. Every person’s vote in every 
State should count just the same—one 
person, one vote. 
Election fraud and reform are very 
serious issues. Election reform abso-
lutely should be debated in Congress, 
which is why, instead of today’s Ka-
buki theater, I invite my Republican 
colleagues to stand up and say: Yes, we 
need to protect and expand voting 
rights and election security. We need 
automatic voter registration. We need 
online voter registration. We need 
same-day voter registration. We should 
make election day a Federal holiday. 
We should restore voting rights to peo-
ple with prior felony convictions. We 
should 
support 
independent 
redis-
tricting commissions. Let’s spend our 
time debating that on the floor—debat-
ing how to reduce the influence of big 
money in our political system, to slow 
the revolving door between government 
officials and lobbyists, to stop gerry-
mandering and voter suppression. That 
is the real election reform that we 
should be debating and supporting, not 
these shameful, craven, baseless objec-
tions. 
More than 350,000 Americans have 
died from the coronavirus. That is the 
truth. Nearly 8 million people have 
fallen into poverty because of the eco-
nomic crisis caused by this virus. That 
is the truth. Wearing a mask saves 
lives. Vaccines are safe and effective. 
That is the truth. Joe Biden won. Don-
ald Trump lost. That is the truth. 
I urge all of my Senate colleagues to 
vote against these objections, affirm 
our democracy, and recognize that Joe 
Biden and KAMALA HARRIS will right-
fully be sworn in on January 20 as the 
President and Vice President of the 
United States. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, 
today was a stomach-turning, gut- 
wrenching moment in our history. 
Truly, it was an assault on the heart of 
our democracy. 
I want to join in thanking the first 
responders and the police. 
I also want to thank others who have 
been heroes of our democracy—unsung 
in many instances. First, they are all 
of the election officials, all of the poll 
workers, all of the members of boards

of election who actually counted the 
votes—who went to the polls and made 
sure that votes could be cast—and who, 
ultimately, stood firm for the integrity 
of that voting system. 
I want to thank the judges. There are 
now about 90 of them who, except for 
one or two who ruled the other way on 
a technicality, have stood firm for the 
integrity of that voting system. In 
those 60 to 70 cases, except for that one 
who ruled on a technicality, they went 
with the integrity of our voting system 
and the rule of law. 
Today was, indeed, disgusting and 
sickening. It was shocking and des-
picable. It was heartbreaking, but it 
was not surprising. In fact, today’s as-
sault on our democracy—the mob vio-
lence, the riots, the thugs and goons 
who were inspired and incited by the 
President of the United States—all 
were of a piece, in these past 4 years, of 
a President who has no respect for the 
truth or the rule of law. 
Donald Trump’s Presidency is com-
ing to a close in the very same way it 
began—with an attack on our democ-
racy. In 2016, the Trump campaign wel-
comed hostile foreign interference with 
our election. The President refused to 
acknowledge that he would accept the 
results of the election if he lost. Then, 
again and again, he demonstrated his 
contempt for the rule of law and for 
laws themselves. He obstructed justice, 
and he would have been charged with it 
had he not been the President of the 
United States. He invited a foreign 
government to interfere in our elec-
tions and find dirt on his political op-
ponent. 
Most disturbingly, these actions by a 
President who demonstrated that con-
tempt for the rule of law were met with 
silence from many political leaders, 
our colleagues here in the Senate 
among them—silence in the face of 
that contempt for the rule of law and 
disrespect for the law enforcers. 
So we could have seen today coming. 
In fact, we did. I warned about it, and 
others did because the fantasies and 
falsehoods that drove those rioters— 
not protesters but the mob who as-
saulted the temple of democracy—were 
fueled 
by 
the 
President’s 
misstatements and lies and contempt 
for the truth, and he was enabled. He 
had enablers. 
Today, we are stopping, in one in-
stance, that enabling, but we must also 
make sure to stop it going forward. 
The political stunt that brought us 
here today offers no great solace that 
it 
will. 
These 
stunts 
have 
con-
sequences. We say words have con-
sequences, and the actions today will 
have significant consequences. They 
are an attack on our democracy that 
undermines the core tenets of our 
American Government and a disrespect 
for the will of the people and a peaceful 
transition 
of 
power. 
The 
political 
stunts themselves, driven by oppor-
tunism, blaze a path that can be fol-
lowed by more competent challenges 
just as the dictatorial instincts and ac-
tions of this President can be followed 
by more effective would-be tyrants in-
tent on destroying our Republic. 
Yes, we have more important tasks 
that we should be addressing as well— 
the pandemic, the economic revival. 
Yet, today, we must be mindful of the 
threat to our democracy that we face 
down and come together on a bipar-
tisan basis, but silence is never excus-
able in the face of lawlessness at the 
very top of our political structure. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I have a 
question for all of my colleagues this 
evening, which is this: What happened 
here today, and how is it different from 
what we expected as we assembled in 
this Chamber early this afternoon? 
Sadly, much like the impeachment 
trial of just a year ago, I think as 
many of us slogged our way to the Na-
tion’s Capital and dutifully filed into 
this Chamber, we expected hours and 
hours of debate and discussion, know-
ing the outcome, knowing that what 
was being engaged in by a handful of 
our colleagues was a political stunt, 
feeding the ego of our President, who is 
chasing conspiracy theories about how 
he actually won the election 2 months 
ago that he lost and indulging his be-
lief that somehow, somehow, the Con-
gress could still, at the last moment, 
snatch victory from the jaws of defeat. 
Even in the last day, President 
Trump had been haranguing his own 
incredibly loyal Vice President, MIKE 
PENCE, as if somehow Vice President 
PENCE would simply declare him Presi-
dent today. 
We knew that President Trump had 
been stirring up the spirits of thou-
sands, urging them to come to Wash-
ington. We had an inkling that he 
might go out and speak to them, but I 
don’t think, as we filed into this Cham-
ber, any of us—any of us—expected 
that, for the second time in our Repub-
lic’s history, the perimeter of this Cap-
itol would be breached, Members of the 
Senate would be rushed to safety; that 
not just the Capitol Police but U.S. 
Marshals and FBI officers and fully 
combat-geared soldiers would be in the 
U.S. Capitol, taking it back from a ri-
otous mob of thugs. 
Just a few moments ago, I went to 
the Rotunda to see the litter and the 
trash, the residue and the remnants of 
those who took over this building 
today, and to say thank you to the men 
and women of law enforcement who 
helped secure it after it fell to an angry 
mob. 
But, folks, we have to think about 
the consequences of what happened 
here today, why this happened, and 
what it means and what it teaches, be-
cause, frankly, tonight, now, the whole 
world is watching. The entire world is 
watching a montage of scenes—of folks 
cavorting in the Capitol, half-naked 
men taking that seat, scrawling things 
on different surfaces, parading up and 
down the Capitol corridors with a Con-
federate flag and a Trump flag, and in 
other ways signaling that they had 
done something significant. No. In fact, 
what they have actually done is weak-
ened our democracy, showed some of 
its fragility, and encouraged our oppo-
nents around the world. 
In the last 2 months since the elec-
tion, we have one man who has aban-
doned his post, who has mostly spent 
his time golfing and tweeting and in-
dulging himself in conspiracy theories 
and been less and less attuned to our 
national security and to a raging pan-
demic, and another man, our Presi-
dent-elect, who is preparing to take 
over the responsibility for leading this 
country out of this pandemic and out 
of its current state of deep, deep divi-
sion. 
President Trump has abandoned his 
post. He does not deserve to be Presi-
dent any longer, and he poses a real 
and present threat to the future of our 
democracy. 
But let me also say this to my col-
leagues, half of whom changed their in-
tended vote today after seeing what 
happened in the Capitol. There were, as 
we began, roughly 13 Senators—Repub-
licans—who said they were going to 
vote against the certification of the 
election, and when we actually finally 
called the roll, it was just 6—7 of them 
having been chastened by the events of 
today. But two who continue on this 
quest clerked for the Supreme Court 
Chief Justice, are deeply schooled in 
the law, and know better than what 
they did today. And in the House, in 
the debate going on over in the House 
even now, more than 100 House Repub-
licans continue with this effort. 
On this floor earlier today, this 
evening, there were strong and clear 
and brave speeches by Republicans and 
Democrats alike. 
So I have a question as we move for-
ward. When will this fever break? When 
will we finally say to each other: 
Enough is enough of indulging and fol-
lowing populism and demagoguery. Is 
it time to finally show who the leaders 
are and to uphold our Constitution 
that every one of the House Members 
and a third of us swore to uphold just 
3 days ago? 
I will tell you, as I look ahead, that 
I am confident that 2 weeks from now, 
Joseph Biden will be sworn in as the 
next President, KAMALA HARRIS sworn 
in as the next Vice President, and we 
have a unique moment in my lifetime, 
because, as Presidents and leaders in 
the Senate of both parties over the last 
decades have observed, the Senate has 
steadily shrunk in its significance, its 
role, in its power, and the Presidency 
has steadily grown. Not in my life-
time—not since LBJ—have we had an 
incoming President who spent 36 years 
in this Chamber. 
We have a chance with Joe Biden, a 
President-elect who ran on bringing 
our country together, a President-elect 
who ran on turning the page from our 
moment of national division, and a

President-elect who respects and hon-
ors and understands the significance of 
this body. 
So we have to take this opportunity 
to heal, to hear each other, to com-
promise, to work together, and to see 
the real challenges facing the Amer-
ican people and take this last best mo-
ment. 
What happened here today should 
leave all of us gravely concerned about 
the health and the future of our democ-
racy, and the opportunity we will have 
2 weeks from today is one we should 
not let pass us by. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. President, more 
than 350,000 of our loved ones have died 
from a terrible disease. Small busi-
nesses have gone under, never to re-
open. Millions have lost their jobs, and 
too many families don’t know how 
they are going to pay the rent or put 
groceries on the table. 
It is tough out there, but Americans 
are fighters, and despite all the chal-
lenges, in November they did what 
Americans do when they are unhappy 
with their leadership—they voted for 
change. They turned their backs on a 
sitting President who fans the flames 
of hatred while bodies pile up in the 
morgue. Instead, they elected a new 
President who wants to save lives, to 
save our economy, and to save our de-
mocracy. 
Even as the pandemic raged, Ameri-
cans showed up for democracy. States 
worked overtime to set up safe sys-
tems, ballot drop boxes, early voting, 
and gallons of hand sanitizer. Voters 
mailed their ballots earlier, put on 
masks, and stood in line at the polls. 
The election of 2020 shattered voting 
records. 
So here we are on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate in the aftermath of a his-
toric election held in the middle of a 
pandemic. People are suffering, and we 
should be working to get them the help 
they need. Instead, we are here because 
Donald Trump wants to overturn the 
results of that election. The Repub-
licans objecting to the results of this 
election will be judged by history, but 
the rest of us will be judged as well. 
It is our responsibility to stand up 
for our democracy even while other 
Senators work to undermine it. 
Losing is hard. I ran for President 
myself. It was a hard-fought primary, 
but Joe Biden won and I lost. I am not 
the only one to live through that; a 
number of Senators in this room have 
run for President. None of us was suc-
cessful, and when we lost, we conceded 
and we got out of the race because that 
is how democracy works. None of us 
lied about the results. We didn’t throw 
temper tantrums. We didn’t tell our al-
lies in Congress or the States to over-
turn the results. We didn’t feed poi-
sonous propaganda to our supporters. 
We didn’t urge people to march on 
State capitals or to descend on Wash-
ington. We accepted the will of the vot-
ers. 
And it is not just us; it is everyone 
who has run for President since the be-
ginning of America. Only once in 
America’s history have the people who 
lost tried to burn down our democracy 
on the way out. They caused a civil 
war that nearly destroyed our Nation. 
Make no mistake, the violence we 
witnessed in this Chamber today was 
the direct result of the poisonous lies 
that Donald Trump repeated again and 
again for more than 2 months. His 
words have consequences. Our democ-
racy has been grievously injured by 
this lying coward. 
This effort to subvert our democracy 
is not merely one last Presidential tan-
trum. This effort is designed to knock 
out the basic pillar on which democ-
racy is founded: the idea that the vot-
ers—not the sitting President and not 
the Members of Congress but the voters 
decide who will lead this Nation. 
A democracy in which the elected 
leaders do not bend to the will of the 
voters is no democracy. It is a totali-
tarian state. And those who pursue this 
effort are supporting a coup. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no on 
this effort to overthrow our democ-
racy. 
I yield the floor.

ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess subject to the call

draw from the joint session to count 
the electoral vote for separate consid-
eration of an objection, a Senator may 
speak to the objection for 5 minutes 
and not more than once. Debate shall 
not exceed 2 hours, after which the 
Chair will put the question: Shall the 
objection be sustained? 
The clerk will report the objection 
made in the joint session. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows:

souri and Representative PERRY from Penn-
sylvania, ‘‘We, a U.S. Senator and Member of 
the House of Representatives, object to the

of Pennsylvania on the ground that they 
were not, under all of the known cir-
cumstances, regularly given.’’

leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I know of no fur-
ther debate.

ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE 
ON JANUARY 5, 2021—PM 1 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Pursuant to the International Emer-
gency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National 
Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), 
and section 301 of title 3, United States 
Code, I hereby report that I have issued 
an Executive Order declaring addi-
tional steps to be taken concerning the 
national emergency with respect to the 
information and communications tech-
nology and services supply chain de-
clared in Executive Order 13873 of May 
15, 2019 (Securing the Information and 
Communications Technology and Serv-
ices Supply Chain) to deal with the 
threat posed by applications and other 
software developed or controlled by 
Chinese companies. 
The pace and pervasiveness of the 
spread in the United States of certain 
connected mobile and desktop applica-
tions and other software developed or 
controlled by persons in the People’s 
Republic of China (PRC), to include 
Hong Kong and Macau (China), con-
tinue to threaten the national secu-
rity, foreign policy, and economy of 
the United States. By accessing per-
sonal 
electronic 
devices 
such 
as 
smartphones, tablets, and computers, 
Chinese connected software applica-
tions can access and capture vast 
swaths of information from users, in-
cluding sensitive personally identifi-
able information and private informa-
tion. The continuing activity of the 
PRC and the Chinese Communist Party 
to steal or otherwise obtain United 
States persons’ data makes clear that 
there is an intent to use bulk data col-
lection to advance China’s economic 
and national security agenda. To deal 
with this threat, additional steps are 
required against those who develop or 
control certain Chinese connected soft-
ware applications to protect our na-
tional security. 
The Executive Order prohibits cer-
tain future transactions, as determined 
by the Secretary of Commerce (Sec-
retary), involving the following Chi-
nese connected software applications: 
Alipay, 
CamScanner, 
QQ 
Wallet, 
SHAREit, Tencent QQ, VMate, WeChat 
Pay, and WPS Office. The Secretary is 
also directed to: 
(i) continue to evaluate Chinese con-
nected software applications that may 
pose an unacceptable risk to the na-
tional security, foreign policy, or econ-
omy of the United States, and to take 
appropriate action in accordance with 
Executive Order 13873; and 
(ii) in consultation with the Attorney 
General and the Director of National 
Intelligence, provide a report to the 
Assistant to the President for National 
Security Affairs with recommenda-
tions to prevent the sale or transfer of 
United States user data to, or access of 
such data by, foreign adversaries, in-
cluding through the establishment of 
regulations and policies to identify, 
control, and license the export of such 
data. 
I have delegated to the Secretary, in 
consultation with the Secretary of the 
Treasury and the Attorney General, 
the authority to take such actions, in-
cluding adopting appropriate rules and 
regulations, and employing all other 
powers granted to the President by 
IEEPA, as may be necessary to imple-
ment the Executive Order. The heads of 
all executive departments and agencies 
are directed to take all appropriate 
measures within their authority to im-
plement the provisions of the Execu-
tive Order. 
I am enclosing a copy of the Execu-
tive Order I have issued.

CONGRATULATING GILPIN COUNTY 
COMMISSIONER 
GAIL 
WATSON 
ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish 
to recognize the accomplishments of an in-
credible public servant. Since 2012, Gail Wat-
son has served as a County Commissioner for 
Gilpin County. During her time in office she 
has proven that hard work and determination 
are the cornerstones of implementing change. 
As a County Commissioner, Gail has been 
a huge proponent of environmental protection. 
She has spent endless hours ensuring that 
Gilpin County’s public lands remained free of 
invasive plant species and protected from de-
velopment. Commissioner Watson has been a 
huge asset to her community and her work 
has positively impacted the people she has 
been so proud to serve. 
She has shown a passion for maintaining 
the safety and wellbeing of her constituents. 
During her time as a County Commissioner, 
Gail prioritized access to broadband internet 
and phone service in Gilpin County, empha-
sizing that access to broadband service is a 
necessity in cases of emergency and for edu-
cation. She also ensured that Gilpin County 
was well prepared for any natural disaster that 
might hit and focused on bolstering Gilpin’s 
emergency preparedness. 
I am grateful for Gail’s dedicated service as 
a Gilpin County Commissioner, and I know 
that the impact of her work will continue to be 
felt for many years to come. I wish her a rest-
ful and well-deserved retirement.

HONORING FORMER PHOENIX CITY 
COUNCILMAN AND CIVIL RIGHTS 
LEADER CALVIN C. GOODE 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
honor the life and legacy of a civil rights icon 
and progressive giant, former Phoenix City 
Councilman Calvin C. Goode, who passed 
away on December 23, 2020 at the age of 93. 
Calvin spoke softly but carried with him the 
moral authority of having fought—and won— 
many civil rights battles throughout his long 
career. 
Calvin was just 10 months old when his 
family moved from Oklahoma to Gila Bend, 
Arizona. The family relocated again to Pres-
cott when the local school refused to enroll 
Calvin because of the color of his skin. He 
went on to attend Carver High School in 
Phoenix, Arizona’s only high school built for 
Black students. After growing up attending 
segregated schools, Calvin devoted his life to 
improving education access in our community 
alongside his beloved late wife Georgie. He 
earned degrees in business and education 
from Phoenix College and Arizona State Uni-
versity, and served as an accountant for 
Carver and other Phoenix Union High School 
District schools for 30 years. 
First elected in 1971, Calvin served a record 
22 years on the Phoenix City Council. During 
his time at City Hall, Calvin continued to be 
guided by his deeply held belief in the equality 
of all people. Known as the ‘‘Conscience of 
the Council,’’ his legacy of creating opportunity 
for all endures in Phoenix—from the early 
childhood education and jobs programs he 
championed to the anti-discrimination ordi-
nance he helped broker. He was instrumental 
in pushing the City to recognize Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day, paving the way for the holiday to 
be observed statewide. 
Even after his time on the Council, Calvin 
remained one of the most impactful leaders in 
the Phoenix community. He fought to protect 
the history of his beloved Eastlake Park neigh-
borhood where he lived for most of his life— 
an area shaped by segregation and redlining 
that became a gathering place for civil rights 
leaders. In his later years, he was instrumental 
in turning his alma mater, the formerly seg-
regated Carver High School, into a museum 
and worked to ensure the institution would 
survive and thrive to hold African American Ar-
izonans’ history for future generations. 
He was above all a man of quiet courage 
and unshakeable conviction, and we are all 
better because of his lifetime of service. God-
speed, Calvin.

INTRODUCTION OF THE BUILD 
AMERICA ACT OF 2021 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to introduce the Build America Act of 
2021, legislation that will provide $10 billion 
annually for merit-based infrastructure grants 
across the country. For years, House Demo-
crats have called for a dramatic investment in 
infrastructure, and for years, these calls have 
gone unanswered. I am hopeful that this will 
be the year that we finally make the invest-
ments we need. I am proud to introduce my 
legislation today—not for a massive, all-en-
compassing infrastructure package—but rath-
er, for a commonsense expansion of success-
ful programs based on need and merit that will 
ensure we put money towards the greatest in-
frastructure needs regardless of any additional 
package passed in the House. 
My legislation will significantly increase the 
size and scope of two existing infrastructure 
grant programs, the Capital Investment Grant 
Program (CIG), also known as New Starts/ 
Small Starts, and the BUILD Grant Program, 
formerly known as the Transportation Invest-
ment Generating Economic Recovery Grant 
Program, or TIGER Grants. These programs 
have been immensely successful in the past, 
assisting 
rural 
and 
urban 
communities 
prioritize their own needs. Each program re-
quires matching funds from those seeking as-
sistance, making them smart and effective 
avenues for leveraging federal funding to 
make a real impact across the country. 
My bill takes these programs out of the an-
nual appropriations process. Instead, it estab-
lishes them as mandatory programs with per-
manent and expanded funding streams total-
ing more than $10 billion annually. 
This expansion will be welcome news to the 
thousands of communities like those I rep-
resent. Consider this, since 2009, Congress 
has dedicated more than $8 billion for multiple 
rounds of TIGER/BUILD funding. In FY2020 
alone, the program received over $9 billion in 
applications. That is more than the total 
amount of funding over a 10-year period in 
just a single fiscal year. The process is com-
petitive, and it allows the U.S. Department of 
Transportation (DOT) to reward applicants that 
exceed eligibility criteria and demonstrate 
commitments to their projects. 
By increasing these funding levels and re-
moving the programs from the annual appro-
priations process, we will take the guesswork 
and uncertainty out of the programs. This in 
turn will allow communities around the country 
to submit funding requests for projects of na-
tional, regional, or metropolitan-area signifi-
cance, including the construction and repair of 
roads, bridges, and tunnels, the installation of 
high-speed internet, revitalization of drinking 
water infrastructure, and the construction and 
expansion of fixed-guideway public transpor-
tation systems, including subways, light rail, 
commuter rail, and bus rapid transit (BRT). 
Madam Speaker, we have talked about 
prioritizing a large-scale infrastructure package 
for years. Last Congress, the House passed 
H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, a $1.5 trillion 
plan to rebuild American infrastructure. How-
ever, like so many other bills passed during 
the 116th Congress, it was ignored by the Re-
publican controlled Senate. We need to get 
serious. 
Every four years, the American Society of 
Civil Engineers issues a ‘‘Report Card’’ for 
America’s Infrastructure. The report depicts 
the condition and performance of American in-
frastructure, assigning letter grades based on

JEFF DORSCHNER 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Jeff Dorschner of the U.S. 
Attorney’s Office, District of Colorado, for his 
more than 20 years of service to the state and 
people of Colorado. 
Throughout Jeff’s time with the U.S. Attor-
ney General’s office, he has had many dif-
ferent responsibilities and roles—from Spokes-
man and Public Affairs Specialist to a Member 
of the Executive Management Team. He is 
best known and will be remembered for his 
hard work and dedication to the office and the 
people it serves. 
During his tenure, Jeff handled media rela-
tions for the office on issues large or small, 
and no matter what time or day of the week. 
This required Jeff to know about all office ac-
tivities, stay up to date with major investiga-
tions and law enforcement events, and be well 
versed in all offices policies and programs. He 
served as a spokesperson on many diverse 
subjects, ranging from criminal law to civil law 
and financial litigation, and served as a cred-
ible voice on behalf of the U.S. Attorney and 
Assistant U.S. Attorneys. He developed long- 
standing, close relationships with members of 
the news media, referred to by many reporters 
upon his retirement as one of the state’s ‘‘top- 
tier’’ Public Information Officers (PIO), always 
helpful, trustworthy and responsive. 
In his role in public affairs and as part of the 
Executive Management team, Jeff provided 
sound advice and counsel to the U.S. Attorney 
as well as responded to citizen inquiries. On 
occasion, Jeff would also handle inquiries from 
Members of Congress or state or local elected 
officials. Jeff was on duty on 9/11/2001 and 
was subsequently assigned as the Chief Infor-
mation Officer for the U.S. Attorney’s Anti-Ter-
rorism Advisory Committee (ATAC). 
During his tenure with the U.S. Attorney’s 
Office, Jeff coordinated more than ten different 
visits by other U.S. Attorneys General as well 
as visits by the Deputy Attorneys General of 
the United States. He served four Presidents 
(Clinton, Bush, Obama and Trump) along with 
many presidential appointed and acting U.S. 
Attorneys (Tom Strickland, Richard ‘‘Dick’’ 
Spriggs, John Suthers, William ‘‘Bill’’ Leone, 
Troy Eid, David Gaouette, John Walsh, Bob 
Troyer and Jason Dunn). 
I want to extend my deepest appreciation 
for Jeff’s long career in public service and 
countless contributions to our community. I 
wish him the best in retirement and future en-
deavors.

REMEMBERING CHRISTINE 
TERLESKY 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
memory of Christine Terlesky, a beloved 
mother, wife, teacher, coach, daughter, sister 
and friend who passed away after a long bat-
tle with ALS. 
While Christine played many roles, I first 
came to know her as an advocate. Soon after 
being diagnosed, she came to Capitol Hill as 
a passionate voice for families living with ALS 
to champion additional funding, research, and 
legislation that would benefit those afflicted 
with this debilitating disease. 
That’s just who Christine was; a person who 
immediately was spurred into action on behalf 
of others despite being confronted with a dis-
ease that impacted all aspects of her and her 
family’s lives. 
Forever the teacher, she continued to tell 
her story to teach others about the realities of 
ALS. Forever the Coach, she used that plat-
form to fight for ALS funding and affordable, 
universal healthcare for all. 
I saw firsthand how Christine passionately 
gave her time and energy—even as it was in 
increasingly limited supply—to what she be-
lieved in. And for Christine, that meant com-
munity. It meant family. It meant Youngstown. 
We had that in common. 
I have fond memories of a dinner we had in 
D.C. with her sisters, swapping stories of our 
days as Youngstown State University athletes, 
our big Italian families, our love of sports, and 
her 19 years teaching history and government 
and coaching at Boardman High School. The 
evening went on for hours. 
That dinner was also when I learned of 
Christine’s deep admiration for Hillary Clinton. 
In 2016, during one of Secretary Clinton’s 
campaign stops in Youngstown, I was able to 
connect Christine to Secretary Clinton. I will 
never forget the joy in Christine’s face when 
she first met the Secretary. And in that mo-
ment, Christine did what she always did, put 
others first. She used her short time with the 
Secretary to advocate for those suffering with 
ALS. 
In her final months, Christine continued to 
use her online presence to educate and advo-
cate. She never lost her faith in government, 
advocacy, and enacting policies to improve 
the lives of Americans. 
Christine Terlesky is survived by her par-
ents, 
Ronald 
and 
Judy 
Moschella 
of 
Boardman; her husband, Brian Terlesky; their 
three children, Brian (21), Tyler (16) and 
Emma (12); two younger sisters, Nadine 
(Nick) Colla and Jolene (Donald) Ross; her in- 
laws, Mary Lou and Ted Terlesky and nieces 
and nephews, Jenna and Jimmy Vivo, Lia and 
Nicholas Colla and Tessa, Gianna and Lena 
Ross. 
Christine was one of the most caring, brave, 
and passionate people I have ever met. She 
gave her life to helping others and never 
backed down from a fight. I’m honored to have 
known her. 
She will be sorely missed, but her commu-
nity—our community—will continue to work to-
gether to carry out her mission. My prayers 
are with her family.

CONGRATULATING SUMMIT COUN-
TY COMMISSIONER THOMAS DA-
VIDSON ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I 
seek to highlight the career of an exemplary 
public servant from Colorado’s Second Con-
gressional District. For fourteen years, Summit 
County Commissioner Thomas Davidson tire-
lessly devoted himself to the betterment of his 
community. 
Thomas has never strayed during his public 
service from his commitment to health, safety, 
and equity. As the Chairman of the Combined 
Housing Authority, he advocated for affordable 
housing for all. He spent 13 years on the 
board of Early Childhood Options which start-
ed the County’s Head Start program—pro-
viding critical resources to low-income families 
in this mountain county. In 2013, he was ap-
pointed by the Governor of Colorado to the 
State’s Early Childhood Leadership Commis-
sion, and in 2015, was called on by the Gov-
ernor once more to serve on the State Board 
of Human Services—a testament to his lead-
ership and tenacity. 
As Summit County’s first openly gay County 
Commissioner and a vocal advocate for 
LGBTQ rights, Commissioner Davidson has 
broken barriers for the next generations and 
set an excellent example for his community. I 
am so proud to represent such a dedicated 
public servant and member of his community. 
I am grateful for all the work Commissioner 
Davidson has done as a Summit County Com-
missioner and am glad that he will continue 
his involvement in his community even after 
his time as a County Commissioner is over. I 
wish him a restful and well-deserved retire-
ment from public service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E11 
January 6, 2021 
President of Government and Community Af-
fairs at the American Printing House for the 
Blind (APH), on his retirement. For more than 
34 years, Gary has been a tireless advocate 
for thousands of students and adults who are 
blind or visually impaired. 
Gary has been the face of APH on Capitol 
Hill for decades. His approach to educating 
Members of Congress and their staff was to 
emphasize the importance of increased fund-
ing for the blind and visually impaired; dem-
onstrating the many technologies developed 
by APH; and making clear how that invest-
ment helps expand educational opportunities 
for those without sight. Gary’s determination, 
both personally and professionally, proved to 
all who know him that a blind man can 
achieve great success. Gary is a proud grad-
uate of the University of Louisville where he 
received his Bachelor of Science Degree in 
Sociology. 
Gary was known to many on Capitol Hill, 
and his guide dogs were often more recogniz-
able than their owner. When Gary called for 
an appointment, the first question was: ‘‘Is the 
dog coming?’’ Heathcliff was his first com-
panion. When he passed away, Denver filled 
the coveted position. Not that we weren’t 
pleased to see Gary, but his companions were 
always a highlight of the day. Gary was a val-
uable resource for members of the Capitol Hill 
community and was always available to an-
swer any questions about educating the blind 
and visually impaired. 
Gary’s accomplishments are many: he 
played a key leadership role on the APH exec-
utive board; helped establish the National Pris-
on Braille Network—a partnership with the 
APH and prisons across the United States to 
learn braille to transcribe textbooks for blind 
students; and played an integral role at the 
APH Museum, the InSights Arts Competition, 
and the National Instructional Materials Acces-
sibility Center resources services team. Gary 
was not only instrumental in ensuring that the 
APH facility was an accessible workplace for 
all, but also led the team to include accessi-
bility for the blind for the Louisville Metro re-
gion to expand accessibility and technology for 
transit, buildings, and streets, and he worked 
tirelessly to help incorporate changes into city 
planning documents for our city. 
As Helen Keller said, ‘‘The only thing worse 
than being blind is having sight but no vision.’’ 
Gary’s work at the APH demonstrated more 
than vision. He inspired others to join in his 
quest to provide the best for blind students, 
adults, and the visually impaired all over this 
great nation. 
I wish Gary the very best in retirement and 
send my good wishes to him, his wife Susan, 
daughters Kelly and Rachel, and grand-
children Cate, Carter, Davis, and Kase.

IN HONOR OF THE LATE MR. 
ANTONIO DIAS CHAVES 
HON. LORI TRAHAN 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mrs. TRAHAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the contributions and legacy of Mr. 
Antonio Dias Chaves, a proud Portuguese im-
migrant who made Hudson, Massachusetts his 
home and dedicated his life and career to 
public service and the prosperity of the Por-
tuguese community in Massachusetts. He 
tragically passed away due to COVID–19 on 
December 31, 2020. 
From 1967 when Antonio immigrated to the 
United States from the Azores until his death, 
he worked tirelessly to make his country and 
community a better place. Shortly after his ar-
rival, he enlisted in the Army and proudly 
served his country during the Vietnam War. 
His public service did not end there. Rather, it 
was just the beginning. In 1978, Antonio be-
came the first Portuguese-American elected to 
the Hudson Board of Selectmen and just the 
second elected Portuguese-American in all of 
Massachusetts. His passion for politics blos-
somed and he developed friendships with 
many political leaders throughout the Com-
monwealth and beyond—all to give back to his 
country, support his community, and most im-
portantly, help others. 
Antonio’s impact on the Portuguese dias-
pora in Massachusetts cannot be understated 
nor can his commitment to helping other immi-
grants achieve the American Dream. Antonio 
helped thousands of people make a life for 
themselves and their families in America as 
both an immigration consultant and a public 
servant with the Massachusetts Office of Refu-
gees and Immigrants. As a former congres-
sional staffer and member of Congress, I had 
the opportunity see first-hand Antonio’s deter-
mined advocacy for helping others, his devo-
tion to his community, his pride in his heritage, 
and of course, his passion for the Hudson 
Portuguese Club. I will miss seeing him 
among families and friends during dinners or 
feasts at the Club, where he could usually be 
found as the resident Master of Ceremonies, 
hosting in the restaurant, cheering on his fa-
vorite team (Sporting Clube de Portugal), hav-
ing a toast with friends, or tending to duties as 
the president of the general assembly. 
For his contributions and accomplishments, 
he was awarded one of the highest civilian 
honors bestowed by the Portuguese Govern-
ment, the Order of Merit and the title of 
‘‘Comendador’’. Throughout his life, Antonio 
would receive numerous recognitions from 
State and local government and other distin-
guished organizations for his work in the com-
munity through the Hudson Portuguese Club 
and Portugal 73, one of the oldest continually 
running Portuguese radio shows in the world. 
Recently, Antonio authored and published ‘‘Os 
Meus Imperios’’, a memoir of establishing the 
Holy Ghost Festival or ‘‘Imperio’’ in Massachu-
setts and Rhode Island. 
Antonio will be remembered for his love for 
his family, our great nation, unparalleled 
friendship, passion for helping others, and 
pride in his Portuguese heritage. His contribu-
tions to our community and grateful nation will 
never be forgotten. My heart goes out to Zelia, 
Derek, and the entire Chaves family during 
this difficult time. Antonio’s legacy will live on 
through his loving family and all of us who had 
the honor of calling him a friend.

HONORING AUGUSTUS BENTON 
‘‘BEN’’ CHAFIN, JR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Virginia state Senator Augustus Ben-
ton ‘‘Ben’’ Chafin, Jr. of Lebanon, Virginia, 
who died on January 1, 2021 at the age of 60. 
Ben was a dedicated and effective state legis-
lator and a kind and decent man. 
Ben was a true son of Southwest Virginia. 
He was born on May 18, 1960 in Abingdon, 
Virginia. He earned a bachelor’s degree from 
East Tennessee State University and a law 
degree from the University of Richmond. Ben 
practiced law in Lebanon as a principal of the 
Chafin Law Firm. He also served as a board 
member of the First Bank and Trust, which his 
father had helped to found, and ran a beef 
cattle farm. 
In 2013, Ben won a seat in the Virginia 
House of Delegates. A year later, he won a 
special election to represent the 38th District 
in the Virginia Senate. The 38th District in-
cludes all of the Counties of Bland, Buchanan, 
Dickenson, Russell, Tazewell, and Pulaski, 
parts of the Counties of Smyth, Wise, and 
Montgomery, and the Cities of Norton and 
Radford. He was a great representative for the 
citizens of these jurisdictions, focused on lis-
tening to their concerns and addressing them 
with compassion and integrity. He was a voice 
in Richmond for the region he had long called 
home and the people he had known as his 
friends and neighbors. 
Ben was my friend and a good friend to all 
of us in Southwest Virginia. He and I knew 
each other well as we often campaigned to-
gether across our region. The wide respect 
and affection Ben earned is indicated by the 
statement 
of 
Virginia 
Governor 
Ralph 
Northam: ‘‘With the passing of Senator Ben 
Chafin, Southwest Virginia has lost a strong 
advocate—and we have all lost a good man.’’ 
A similar sentiment was expressed by Virginia 
Delegate Terry Kilgore, a close friend of Ben: 
‘‘Ben was a fighter, both in the Virginia Senate 
and in the courtroom as an attorney. I am 
honored to have been able to know and work 
with him. Ben is one of the most honorable 
and genuine individuals I have ever known, 
and his passing is a tremendous loss for our 
region.’’ 
Ben is survived by his wife Lora and his 
children Audra, Sophie, and Gus. I offer my 
condolences on the loss of this good man and 
great legislator.

ADOPTING 
THE 
RULES 
OF 
THE 
HOUSE 
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
FOR THE 117TH CONGRESS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 4, 2021 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N. Madam Speaker, 
I express my opposition to the proposed 
House Rules governing the 117th Congress. 
As the Congresswoman for Puerto Rico, I 
represent 3.2 million Puerto Ricans, American 
citizens by birth since 1917. Yet as such I 
have no vote on passage of measures. 
While House Resolution 8 will continue to 
provide the Delegates and the Resident Com-
missioner a vote in the Committee of the 
Whole, the vote will only count if the votes 
cast are not deciding votes. 
If Delegates or the Resident Commissioner, 
while in the Committee of the Whole, cast de-
ciding votes, the measure will receive a re- 
vote without any delegate or Resident Com-
missioner casting a vote during the second 
vote. 
This is just a reflection of a continued injus-
tice and a step that does little or nothing to 
address it. 
More than a symbolic expression, my con-
stituents need equal standing. 
This past November, Puerto Ricans exer-
cised their choice by casting 623,053 votes for 
statehood, capturing 52-percent of the total 
vote. This referendum was a straight yes-no 
question as to the ultimate will of the Puerto 
Rican voters. 
Puerto Rico demands equality. My constitu-
ents voted for equal voting representation in 
the U.S. House of Representatives and the 
United States Senate, which can only be 
achieved through statehood. 
Puerto Rico would have at least four U.S. 
Representatives in the House and the Con-
stitutionally mandated two Senators when it 
becomes a state. This would give the island 
six electoral votes during a Presidential elec-
tion cycle. 
And still, there are those who still try to sub-
vert the will of the voters who actually live in 
the island. 
All the crises that Puerto Rico has suffered 
during the past four years, including hurri-
canes, earthquakes, the coronavirus pan-
demic, and the fiscal crisis, demonstrate the 
urgency of achieving equality with the states. 
That is why statehood cannot wait any 
longer. The island must receive the same 
treatment that is received in the rest of the na-
tion. There is strength in the Union, particu-
larly in moments of collective crisis. 
The territorial status is also primarily respon-
sible for the island’s economic underdevelop-
ment and decline. 
According to the Census there are 5.4 mil-
lion Puerto Ricans living in the rest of the 
United States as opposed to 3.26 million living 
on the island—a difference of 2.1 million peo-
ple, driven by the lack of opportunity. 
It’s a pleasure to serve in this House, the 
most diverse in its history. However, we are 
failing to address the pressing issue of Puerto 
Rico’s need for real, not symbolic votes in 
Congress. 
The island deserves equality, and my con-
stituents deserve representation.

CONGRATULATING 
LARIMER 
COUNTY COMMISSIONER STEVE 
JOHNSON ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish 
to recognize the incredible work and achieve-
ments of Larimer County Commissioner Steve 
Johnson. For 24 years, Steve has devoted 
himself to serving his community and the 
State of Colorado, including spending 12 
years serving in the Colorado Legislature and 
12 years serving as a Larimer County Com-
missioner. 
Prior to becoming a Larimer County Com-
missioner, Mr. Johnson served in the Colorado 
House of Representatives for 6 years, during 
which time he served as the Majority Caucus 
Chairman. He followed that service with an 
equally long 6-year stint in the Colorado Sen-
ate, serving on the Joint Budget Committee 
and Senate Appropriations Committee. 
While serving as Larimer County Commis-
sioner, he helped the county’s recovery efforts 
as Larimer County faced some of the largest 
natural disasters in the county’s history. The 
High Park Fire in 2012, the One Hundred Year 
Flood in 2013, and the Cameron Peak Fire 
and COVID–19 in 2020 have caused exten-
sive damage and posed great challenges to 
the county’s leadership. Commissioner John-
son helped steer the community through these 
disasters with level-headed determination and 
a commitment to the people of Larimer Coun-
ty. 
He was also instrumental in helping to pass 
the Behavioral Health Initiative, a measure 
which led to Larimer County being a leader in 
Colorado for providing mental health services 
and substance abuse care and increased 
available resources for his community. 
After 24 years of public service, Commis-
sioner Johnson certainly deserves a happy 
and restful retirement. On behalf of the people 
of Colorado’s 2nd Congressional district, thank 
you Commissioner Johnson for your out-
standing dedication to public service. 
RECOGNIZING SHARON STARK FOR 
HER SERVICE AS DISTRICT DI-
RECTOR 
FOR 
THE 
11TH 
CON-
GRESSIONAL DISTRICT OF VIR-
GINIA 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor my dear friend and District Di-
rector, Sharon Stark, on her retirement after 
more than a decade of dedicated and faithful 
service to our community. 
Mrs. Stark’s strong work ethic started at a 
young age when she got her first job selling 
shoes at the age of 15. After college, she 
began her career as a bank teller and worked 
her way up to be a Vice President of Oper-
ations by the time she was 29. She then start-
ed a second career as Vice President of a 
Top 25 title company for residential and com-
mercial real estate. 
In 2005, Sharon was selected to be a mem-
ber of Virginia’s 11th Congressional District 
Democratic Committee where she served as 
the Treasurer for many years with our dear 
friend Chairman George Burke. Two years 
later, in 2007, she was named finance chair 
for George Barker’s campaign for the Senate 
of Virginia. The success of the Barker cam-
paign flipped control of the Senate and helped 
Democrats secure the majority. 
Sharon has managed my Congressional dis-
trict offices since 2009. Under her leadership, 
the office has established a stellar reputation 
for constituent services and community en-
gagement. 
It was during the depths of the 2008 finan-
cial crisis and the subsequent collapse of the 
housing market that Sharon demonstrated just 
how hard she was willing to fight for constitu-
ents. She put her considerable talent and ex-
pertise to work for our constituents. People 
came to our office at risk of being foreclosed 
upon, having their utilities turned off, not 
knowing where they would be sleeping the 
next night, and Sharon took up their cause. 
She fought with the banks, gave people hope 
where they saw none, and even went to the 
courthouse steps to prevent foreclosures. She 
saved people’s homes and changed their lives 
for the better. 
Since 2011, our offices have kept track of 
the financial assistance we have been able to 
secure for our constituents. This assistance in-
cludes helping constituents receive their re-
fund from the IRS or benefits from the Vet-
erans Administration, helping someone resolve 
their Social Security Disability Insurance claim, 
and other efforts that result in constituents re-
ceiving financial assistance owed to them. 
Over the past 9 years, Sharon and her team 
have helped our constituents obtain nearly 
$20 million in one-time or retroactive benefits 
plus $9 million per year in recurring benefits. 
Sharon has organized countless events for 
the benefit of our constituents. She has estab-
lished an Open Season event that brings to-
gether various health plan providers and in-
dustry experts to educate thousands of federal 
employees, retirees, survivor annuitants, and 
veterans on their health plan options for the 
coming year. Sharon spearheaded the annual 
Congressional Art Competition for VA–11 and 
has grown the event into something truly

memorable for the participants and their fami-
lies. Students compete for more than $1,000 
in scholarship prizes and have the opportunity 
to see for the first time their own artwork in a 
professional gallery setting. 
Sharon has also coordinated countless town 
halls, roundtables, fairs and festivals outreach 
booths, and numerous other community en-
gagements. The events often grapple with se-
rious topics such as gun control, the opioid 
epidemic, health care, and she has always 
striven to ensure that they are meaningful ex-
changes of information and viewpoints for 
attendees. 
One particular area into which Sharon has 
thrown herself and her considerable energy is 
the Military Service Academy nomination proc-
ess for VA–11. She organizes and coordinates 
the advisory boards from each service acad-
emy, sets the interview calendar, supports the 
deliberations, and in the end helps nominate 
the future military leaders of our nation. Under 
Sharon’s leadership, our district is routinely in 
the top three nationally for having the most 
students accepted into one of the prestigious 
U.S. Military Academies. For Sharon, it is a 
labor of love and service to both our country 
and the promising young students who seek to 
serve their nation in uniform. 
This past year as we endured the COVID– 
19 pandemic, Sharon once again stepped into 
the breach, deferring her retirement by work-
ing tirelessly to help constituents who have 
faced personal tragedies and financial hard-
ships. During the pandemic, Sharon has 
helped small businesses secure desperately 
needed grants and loans, helped families re-
solve issues with economic impact payments, 
and made every effort to ensure that our con-
stituents who were stuck abroad were able to 
make it back to the United States safely. In 
2020 alone, Sharon and our staff were able to 
help more than 1,800 individuals overcome 
personal crises directly related to the global 
pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, Sharon Stark is a model 
public servant and I ask my colleagues to join 
me in wishing Sharon Stark health and happi-
ness as she concludes a distinguished career 
in service to her country and community. 
There are people who have their health, a roof 
over their head, or food on the table thanks to 
Sharon. I am proud to have had her lead my 
district offices for the past 13 years and rep-
resent me in our community. Our office, con-
stituents, and district will miss her immensely; 
as will I, and I wish her nothing but the best 
in retirement in which she will be able to 
spend more time with her husband Seth, her 
daughter Christine, and her granddaughter 
Jacqueline. Job well done Sharon Stark.

OPPOSITION TO THE ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE OBJECTION 
HON. RON KIND 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. KIND. Madam Speaker, today is sup-
posed to be a celebration of our democracy— 
the peaceful transfer of power in our Country. 
Instead we saw mob rule descend on our Na-
tion’s Capitol. That’s why I rise today in de-
fense of a pillar of our democracy—the right 
for a free and fair election decided by the will 
of the voters and, ultimately, respected and 
accepted by the losing candidate and their 
supporters. 
The other side can indulge in all the con-
spiracy theories they want, but when you in-
volve the integrity of our elections in my home 
State of Wisconsin, well then I have a prob-
lem. 
In our federal system of government, the 
administration of elections are controlled by 
our States—not Congress. 
What happens in Wisconsin is up to Wis-
consin—not Washington. 
Our job in Congress is to count the electoral 
college votes, not overturn them. 
Wisconsin has a long history of open, fair, 
and accurate elections because of the laws 
that our State has established and executed 
by 2,000 state and local officials, and count-
less volunteers, all who take their responsi-
bility seriously with the highest form of hon-
esty, integrity, fairness, and accuracy. 
What is being attempted here tonight is an 
attempt to invalidate 3.3 million valid Wis-
consin votes merely because their preferred 
candidate didn’t win. 
But if they succeed, democracy dies and 
dictatorship reigns. 
The Trump campaign has filed state and 
federal court cases challenging the outcome of 
the vote in Wisconsin—all of which have been 
dismissed due to lack of any evidence of 
fraud. 
Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Brian 
Hagedorn, who was former Republican Gov-
ernor Scott Walker’s chief legal counsel, wrote 
in dismissing one of these challenges: 
‘‘We are invited to invalidate the entire pres-
idential election in Wisconsin by declaring it 
‘‘null’’—yes, the whole thing . . . this is a dan-
gerous path we are being asked to tread. The 
loss of public trust in our constitutional order 
resulting from the exercise of this kind of judi-
cial power would be incalculable.’’ 
And he is not alone in that assessment. 
The former Republican Speaker of the 
House from Wisconsin, Paul Ryan, said in a 
statement: 
‘‘Efforts to reject the votes of the electoral 
college and sow doubt about Joe Biden’s vic-
tory strike at the foundation of our republic. 
It is difficult to conceive of a more anti- 
democratic and anti-conservative act than a 
federal intervention to overturn the results of 
state-certified elections and disenfranchise mil-
lions of Americans. 
The fact that this effort will fail does not 
mean it will not do significant damage to 
American democracy.’’ 
He concluded by stating: 
‘‘The Trump campaign had ample oppor-
tunity to challenge election results, and those 
efforts failed from lack of evidence . . . Joe 
Biden’s victory is entirely legitimate.’’ 
Or consider the third ranking Republican 
leader in this House, Rep. LIZ CHENEY who 
described this attempt as ‘‘deeply troubling’’. 
She went on to state: 
‘‘This is directly at odds with the Constitu-
tion’s clear text and our core beliefs as Re-
publicans.’’ 
‘‘Doing so’’ she said ‘‘Would be establishing 
a tyranny of Congress and stealing power 
from the States and the people in those 
States.’’ 
Finally consider what my friend and Repub-
lican colleague from Wisconsin, MIKE GALLA-
GHER, had to say about this: 
‘‘I just don’t think we want to endorse the 
principle that January 6 is a legitimate forum 
for Congress to overturn the will of the States 
and the people . . . if you’ve endorsed that 
principle, then you’ve already destroyed the 
idea of American government. At least you’ve 
destroyed the conservative idea of American 
government.’’ 
What these Republican leaders understand 
is this— 
If Congressional Members vote to reject 
valid Presidential electors for invalid reasons, 
There is nothing anyone can do about it. 
The ugly truth is that, despite a nationwide 
vote, fenced in with legal and technical safe-
guards, after 244 years of history, the U.S. 
President is elected on the honor system of 
535 Members of Congress, each sworn to pre-
serve, protect, and defend our Constitution 
and our representative democracy enshrined 
in it. 
It’s not an oath to any individual or to any 
party. 
Now it’s easy to play war when you think 
that you’re firing blanks, but these are not 
blanks being fired at our Constitution. 
This is dangerous today because of the col-
lateral damage that is being done to the sanc-
tity of the ballot box. 
It is also dangerous because it now pro-
vides a blueprint for next time. 
President Trump will not be successful this 
time, but next time when some authoritarian 
wannabe takes a run at our Constitution, all 
bets are off. 
We have a tendency in this Country to kick 
our Democracy around like it’s a football—it’s 
more like an egg, very fragile. You break it, 
good luck putting it back together again. 
Please, do not put Donald Trump ahead of 
our Constitution, ahead of the rule of law, 
ahead of the sanctity of the ballot box. 
Vote no on this attempt to overturn a valid 
election. 
Vote no on this objection.

ELECTION IRREGULARITIES 
HON. CHRISTOPHER H. SMITH 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, 
after rigorous analysis and much reflection, I 
will not oppose the counting of certified elec-
toral votes from any state. 
I share some of the concerns about election 
irregularities. Today’s proceedings give Con-
gress the opportunity to raise concerns about 
alleged election wrongdoing in several states 
which I hope will ultimately lead to bipartisan 
state investigations and reform to ensure fair 
and free elections. 
Today, however, Congress is tasked with 
counting the electoral votes sent by each 
state. Nullifying the electors of any state re-
quires proof that electors were not ‘‘lawfully 
certified’’ according to state laws. 
In early December, Attorney General Wil-
liam Barr told the Associated Press that ‘‘U.S. 
attorneys and FBI agents have been working 
to follow up specific complaints and informa-
tion they’ve received, but ‘‘to date, we have 
not seen fraud on a scale that could have ef-
fected a different outcome in the election.’’ 
All elections in the United States must be 
free and fair—any action to subvert, cheat,

suppress or steal any election should be in-
vestigated and prosecuted. 
Even if the nefarious activity was minor— 
and not likely to alter the outcome of an elec-
tion—individuals who engage in such acts 
should be held accountable in a court of law. 
Noone has a license to cheat. 
Sixteen years ago, some Democratic mem-
bers of the Senate and House tried to overturn 
the results of the Bush-Kerry Presidential elec-
tion. They failed. When counting the electoral 
votes on January 6, 2005, I voted ‘‘no’’ on the 
objection 
to 
accepting 
Ohio’s 
electors— 
enough to reverse the outcome of the elec-
tion—sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Tubbs 
Jones (D–Oh) because the allegations lacked 
both merit and proof. Only 31 Members of the 
House voted in favor of the election changing 
objection. 
Congress, states and local governments 
need to undertake a top-to-bottom review of 
election law and administrative polices to en-
sure that elections are free and fair. 
The future of our Nation depends on it. 
Finally, I unequivocally condemn the assault 
on the Capitol today. And those who com-
mitted violence, vandalism and other crimes 
should be prosecuted to the greatest extent of 
the law. 
Special thanks to the Capitol Police and all 
law enforcement for their brave and decisive 
actions to mitigate and then end today’s crisis. 
Despite its many flaws, the U.S. Congress 
continues to be an extraordinary marketplace 
of ideas and differing opinions. 
The enactment of wise public policy to ben-
efit all Americans requires robust dialogue and 
debate—and genuine respect for one another 
especially when there is fundamental dis-
agreement. 
We must be committed to zero-tolerance to-
wards violence in any form.

OBJECTION TO ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I am 
filled with sadness and anger following the at-
tack on the U.S. Capitol today. It is the result 
of a fever that has been building for weeks, 
months and years and which has only been 
further incited by President Trump. Today is a 
point of inflection and reflection, and we need 
to say enough. This only strengthens our re-
solve to get the Electoral Votes counted and 
certified and continue with a peaceful transi-
tion of power, as has been a hallmark of our 
nation. 
The vote was decisive. Despite the ongoing 
pandemic, we saw a historic 158 million Amer-
icans vote. Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS 
won 306 votes in the Electoral College after 
earning the support of more than 81 million 
Americans. After 60 failed lawsuits and doz-
ens of recounts, there is not one shred of evi-
dence of major fraud in this election. Yet ever 
since Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS won this 
election, there has been a concerted effort to 
overturn the will of the voters. These objec-
tions are unfounded, absurd and dangerous. 
They are contrary to 60 courts which denied 
claims of fraud or vote improprieties. I am sad-
dened to see many of my colleagues continue 
to peddle these lies and falsehoods instead of 
supporting the peaceful transition of power en-
shrined in our Constitution. 
Our elections are among the safest and 
most transparent in the world. For that, I want 
to thank the tens of thousands of Americans 
who work to secure our elections each and 
every year, including Colorado’s elections offi-
cials and workers who continue to exemplify a 
successful mail-in voting system and workers 
for Dominion Voting Systems based in Colo-
rado. Unfortunately, due to these baseless at-
tacks on the election results, many of these 
election workers have been threatened and in-
timidated. Yet these poll workers did their duty 
and counted the votes, shepherding and over-
seeing one of the most fundamental and inte-
gral pillars of our democracy—free, fair and 
open elections. 
Today, Congress resolves to complete our 
work in Joint Session to formally receive the 
votes of the Electors, which have not been 
disputed by any state. Our job is not to over-
turn the will of the voters or the states, it is 
simply to certify their decision on who will be 
the next President and Vice President of the 
United States. I urge all my colleagues to re-
ject these frivolous and dangerous objections 
to the vote of the Electoral College and join 
with the country in supporting the peaceful 
transition of power. It’s time to get back to the 
business of the people and of the country as 
we build a better future.

Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish 
to recognize and honor the work of retiring 
Summit 
County 
Commissioner 
Karn 
Stiegelmeier. Karn has continuously devoted 
much of her time and energy to maintaining 
our beautiful public lands and environment in 
Summit County, Colorado—a community I am 
so proud to represent. Prior to serving as a 
County Commissioner, she worked for the Na-
tional Forest Service and National Park Serv-
ice, where she served in the crucial roles of 
wildland firefighter and park ranger, and also 
taught students in Summit County. 
During her time as a Summit County Com-
missioner, Karn continued to advocate for the 
protection of our environment and was fiercely 
determined to preserve the precious quality of 
life we enjoy in Colorado. She also continu-
ously advocated for forest health and wildfire 
prevention, both of which have helped Colo-
rado’s Second Congressional District in incal-
culable ways. 
She has truly shown an incredible deter-
mination to better her community, and I thank 
her for her many years of service as County 
Commissioner. I am grateful for all the work 
Karn has done during her time as a Summit 
County Commissioner and wish her a restful 
and well-deserved retirement from public serv-
ice. 
CONCERNS ABOUT THE CERTIFI-
CATION 
OF 
THE 
ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE VOTE 
HON. SCOTT DesJARLAIS 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. DESJARLAIS. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
voice my concerns about the certification of 
the Electoral College vote. 
First, I think it is imperative to highlight the 
importance of how our nation’s elections are 
conducted. I have received many calls, emails, 
letters, and I have spoken to many of my con-
stituents who are concerned about the irreg-
ularities in the 2020 election cycle. 
Today, I have many concerns about our 
most recent election, but my objection is fo-
cused on one primary constitutional question 
around changes to election laws made by 
state officials without the approval of their 
state legislatures. This is, of course, a legal 
question, concerning the constitutionality of 
last-minute election law changes made by ex-
ecutive orders without the approval of the 
state legislatures. Article II, Section 1 includes 
the ‘‘Electors Clause,’’ stating: 
Each State shall appoint, in such Manner 
as the Legislature thereof may direct, a 
Number of Electors, equal to the whole Num-
ber of Senators and Representatives to which 
the State may be entitled in the Congress: 
but no Senator or Representative, or Person 
holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the 
United States, shall be appointed an Elector. 
There is no question that changes in state 
election laws were made by executive orders 
without legislative approval (usually under the 
guise of COVID) to allow for ballots to be al-
lowed after deadlines had passed and mail-ins 
and absentees to be allowed under far more 
liberal circumstances which created an envi-
ronment that allowed ‘‘vote harvesting’’ and 
thousands of ballots to be counted days and 
weeks after the election—without the requisite 
standards of verification that we should expect 
for a secure election. 
It is a valid constitutional question and I 
note a recent observation by Justice Gorsuch 
in an unrelated recently decided case between 
the Brooklyn diocese and Governor Andrew 
Cuomo in New York on unlawful forced shut-
downs: 
‘‘Government is not free to disregard the 
[Constitution] in times of crisis. . . . Yet re-
cently, during the COVID pandemic, certain 
States seem to have ignored these long-set-
tled principles.’’ 
All of these issues are just some of the con-
cerns and questions regarding the 2020 elec-
tion and were not limited to these three states. 
Many other concerns of voting irregularities 
have been reported across the country includ-
ing fraud and government officials changing 
state laws without legislature approval. 
These are serious concerns and allegations. 
It should be the state legislatures, and not 
government 
officials 
or 
judges, 
making 
changes to election laws. 
The timing of these election law changes is 
also problematic. In some states, changes 
were made to state election laws during the 
year 
of 
the 
election. 
These 
last-minute 
changes only allow for confusion and chaos, 
as we have seen since November 2020. 
From a global pandemic to one of the most 
consequential Presidential elections in our life-
times, 2020 was a year of many unknowns.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E15 
January 6, 2021 
What should not be an unknown are the 
laws and rules states have on implementing 
our elections. However, the actions by many 
state officials and judges, along with improper 
voting activities, have allowed the 2020 Presi-
dential election to be called into question. 
It is because of these questions and irreg-
ularities, that I object to today’s certification 
process and today, our challenge asks for a 
simple remedy—an appointment of an elec-
toral commission that can hear the claims of 
election irregularities, review the evidence, 
and decide as to what the facts are and 
whether or not election laws were followed. I 
do not believe that to be an unreasonable de-
mand. 
I am proud to represent the state of Ten-
nessee—a state that gets the election process 
done right and should be a role model for the 
nation. In addition to our open Election Day 
procedures, Tennessee provides a generous 
early voting process of 2 weeks in order for 
people to choose a day and time convenient 
to their schedule. In unique circumstances, 
there are also a number of statutory reasons 
where a citizen can request a mail-in or ab-
sentee ballot by mail and have their votes 
counted as well. 
It is a process that works and is fair and eq-
uitable to everyone in the state. It is not unfair, 
it does not suppress voting, and it provides an 
orderly, secure method for conducting elec-
tions and counting votes in a timely fashion. 
Everyone has the ability to do their civic duty 
with a minimum amount of effort—no drama, 
no long lines and waits, and a process that is 
free and fair to all candidates. Votes are tab-
ulated, and results are provided in a timely 
fashion on election night. It’s not complicated, 
we have done this for many election cycles 
now, and we did not change our procedures 
on the fly in 2020. 
We are very fortunate to do things the right 
way in Tennessee and we did once again in 
2020. Sadly, there were a few states that got 
it wrong and call into question the integrity of 
the Presidential election. It is ridiculous and 
unacceptable in the 21st Century that other 
states have processes that lead to a situation 
where it took weeks to have votes tabulated, 
vote totals remaining uncertain, and the num-
bers of uncounted votes being uncertain for 
days—and weeks—after Election Day. 
I respectfully and vigorously disagree with 
people who suggest that the processes that 
were opened and expanded in 2020 in many 
states are not subject to fraud and abuse— 
under these new standards ballots are mailed 
on behalf of people, ballots are sent to the 
wrong addresses, and ballot harvesting is en-
couraged. And again, one of the biggest prob-
lems with mail-in ballots is managing this proc-
ess in a way that allows votes to be counted 
and winners to be determined in a timely fash-
ion. It should not take weeks to determine a 
winner in state and federal races, and the 
prospects of all future Presidential elections 
being undecided for weeks on end leads to 
uncertainty and a lack of confidence in the re-
sults and the fairness of the process. 
It is absurd. Even if you accept that every-
thing is above board, no one should sit here 
and say that this process doesn’t stink. Elec-
tion reform is needed and the mail-in process 
will always be vulnerable to delays and the 
suggestion that foul play is involved—espe-
cially with the evidence being presented. 
Widespread mail in balloting with undefined 
rules and limitations is a solution in search of 
a problem and is unnecessary to conduct a 
fair election in this country. We need a defined 
in-person voting process that includes early 
voting. We need voter ID requirements. We 
need a limited mail in ballot process that al-
lows for absentee votes for military personnel 
serving overseas or away from their homes, 
people traveling abroad for extended periods, 
and those that have serious health issues that 
would legitimately keep them from being able 
to make it to the polls. Beyond that, people 
should take a brief moment out of their lives 
to show up and make an informed vote for the 
candidates and issues on the ballot. 
Since the disputed Presidential election in 
2000, this nation has spent billions upon bil-
lions of dollars for updated machines and 
processes, and 20 years later we are arguably 
in a worse position in terms of having a trans-
parent process. There is no reason—NONE— 
that we can’t have a procedure in this day and 
time to have almost all votes accounted for on 
Election Day. 
We cannot keep conducting our elections in 
a way that does not provide surety and con-
fidence in its results. We need uniform proc-
esses for our federal elections, and we need 
laws in place to ensure that all legal voters are 
given their constitutionally protected rights to 
participate in civic engagement, but not 
through a process in which votes are gathered 
and harvested without their participation in the 
process. Tennesseans demand this fair proc-
ess, and I will always fight for it.

ELECTION IRREGULARITIES 
CANNOT BE IGNORED 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to support the objection. Peo-
ple across the United States are rightfully con-
cerned about the mishandling of their votes 
and irregularities in the 2020 federal election. 
I share this concern given the incredible irreg-
ularities, additionally because the Constitution 
provides that election laws are the sole juris-
diction of state legislators which must be 
maintained, and not to be changed by obscure 
unilateral and judicial abuse with unfounded 
defiance of state laws. As a nation of laws, vi-
olence must never be excused by any one for 
any reason. 
As a former Lexington County Election 
Commissioner, not just as a Member of Con-
gress, I am disgusted at the irregularities in 
the 2020 presidential election. The failure to 
validate signatures, the omission of witnesses, 
the interruption of counting before completion, 
the denial of poll watchers for access to fully 
observe, the extension of ballots received be-
yond Election Day, and the registration of ille-
gal aliens, allowing non-citizens to vote, are all 
an open invitation for fraud. I had counted on 
courts to fully consider lawsuits by 18 states 
and 126 members of Congress, but the Courts 
have declined to act. 
In four states, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsyl-
vania, and Wisconsin, the authority of the 
state legislatures to enact election rules and 
procedures, which is delegated by Article II, 
Section 1, Clause 2 of the Constitution was 
unlawfully subverted. This is an unconstitu-
tional act. 
For these reasons, I will object to certifi-
cation of the Electoral College.

SUPPORTING THE 2020 ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE OBJECTIONS 
HON. BOB GOOD 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speaker, 
first, I want to thank the incredible men and 
women serving as U.S. Capitol Police for their 
dedicated efforts to keep everyone safe and to 
secure our Capitol. 
On January 3rd I took an oath to uphold 
and defend the Constitution. The lawlessness 
that broke down our Capitol doors today is a 
reminder of just how sacred our duty is to up-
hold the rule of law. I want to extend my 
thanks to my colleagues who join me in con-
tinuing the constitutional duties of Congress 
and having this debate tonight with civility and 
without fear. 
Tonight is about more than the 2020 presi-
dential election; it is about all future elections, 
and Congress doing its constitutional duty to 
ensure election integrity, and not accept elec-
toral votes from states with sufficient evidence 
of fraud that has not been fully investigated, 
and whose state legislators did not ensure the 
law was followed or ensure the integrity of 
their elections. 
This challenge is not uncharted territory or a 
new exercise, as Democrats have objected on 
this floor to every recent presidential victory by 
Republicans, most recently challenging the 
electoral votes for 10 states following the 2016 
presidential election, with their primary jus-
tification being the phony Russian collusion 
charges. 
What is unprecedented about this presi-
dential election is first, the number of people 
who believe the election was stolen, second, 
the amount of evidence that indicates fraud 
and other violations of election law that has 
not been investigated, and third, the number 
of members who are objecting to some of the 
electoral votes, a number not seen since 
1876—or 144 years. 
The 2005 bipartisan commission headed by 
Jimmy Carter and James Baker warned of this 
type of widespread voter fraud through illegal 
aliens 
voting, 
not 
requiring 
identification 
verification, and mass voting by mail. 
These three issues clearly facilitate the 
compromise of election integrity. 
Yet, there have not been any evidentiary 
hearings to even consider these allegations of 
voter fraud. 
Georgia is one of the most egregious exam-
ples of violations of legal election procedures 
to the degree that it almost certainly deter-
mined the outcome of the election allegedly 
decided by a mere 12,000 votes. 
The legislators in Georgia failed to protect 
and ensure the integrity of their election. 
We, the Congress, are the forum for the 
voices of the American people. It is our re-
sponsibility to evaluate the validity of these 
electoral votes and to either accept them as 
legitimately cast or reject them as question-
able or unreliable. 
It is my judgment that the electoral votes 
submitted by the state of Georgia are unreli-
able and therefore should not be accepted.

HONORING TREVER AUBRIA ‘‘T.A.’’ 
CARTER, JR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Trever Aubria ‘‘T.A.’’ Carter, Jr., who 
passed away on December 27, 2020 at the 
age of 93. T.A. was a veteran, architect, and 
philanthropist in Virginia’s Roanoke Valley. 
T.A. was born on December 20, 1927 to 
Trever Aubria Carter, Sr. and Pernell Jackson 
Carter Smith. He graduated from Jefferson 
High School. After serving in the United States 
Navy at the end of World War II, he earned a 
degree in architecture from Virginia Tech. 
The properties T.A. helped develop dot the 
landscape of western Virginia. He launched 
the Double T Corporation with T.D. Steele and 
also worked in partnerships with other busi-
nessmen. Among the locations T.A. helped 
develop were Crossroads Mall, the first en-
closed 
shopping 
mall 
in 
Virginia, 
and 
Tanglewood Mall in Roanoke, University Mall 
in Blacksburg, Hunting Hills Country Club, 
properties for the Marriott hotel chain in Roa-
noke and Blacksburg, and residential neigh-
borhoods including the Stonegate neighbor-
hood and the Stonegate Swim Club. He was 
a hands-on developer who visited his projects 
every day they were under development. 
T.A. contributed to the architecture of west-
ern Virginia but he contributed in other ways. 
He advocated for Explore Park in Roanoke 
and Bedford Counties. As a devotee of his 
alma mater, Virginia Tech, he established the 
T.A. Carter Professorship in the College of Ar-
chitecture, and he supported Roanoke College 
in Salem as well. T.A. also belonged to the 
Salem Rotary for many years. 
T.A. was known for his kind and charitable 
nature, taking an interest in the people of his 
community and his profession and supporting 
their endeavors. I was a recipient of his gen-
erosity. The Stonegate Swim Club which he 
built and owned had an initiation fee and a 
membership fee, but he let a single-parent 
schoolteacher in the area pay the fees in in-
stallments for her children so they could use 
the facility. As one of those children, I enjoyed 
the opportunity to swim and took it up as a 
lifelong hobby. I am a member of that swim 
club to this day. 
T.A. is survived by his wife of 71 years, Jea-
nette Watson Carter; his daughter, Treva Jean 
Carter and fiance´ Alan; his son, Edward Paul 
Carter and wife Juliette; his granddaughter, 
Amber Miller Mason; grandsons Jeremy Wyatt 
Carter and wife Kel and Benjamin Gerald Car-
ter and wife Melissa, and great-grandchildren 
Maggie, Carter, Wyatt, and Millie. I wish to 
offer my condolences on the loss of T.A., who 
did so much for the development and support 
of the Roanoke Valley.

CONGRATULATING 
STATE 
SEN-
ATOR MIKE FOOTE ON HIS RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I 
want to honor an extraordinary leader and col-
league of mine who has worked tirelessly for 
his constituents, Colorado State Senator Mike 
Foote. After serving 5 years in the Colorado 
House of Representatives, Senator Foote then 
served an additional two years as State Sen-
ator for District 17 in the Colorado Senate. 
The time and effort Senator Foote put into 
representing his community is a testament to 
his ability and dedication to his constituency. 
Senator Foote worked hard to generate bipar-
tisan agreements on legislation, putting his 
constituents above politics. He worked tire-
lessly to represent the values of his constitu-
ents, especially as a leader in critical efforts to 
fight climate change and preserve our environ-
ment for generations to come. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, he au-
thored legislation that was signed into law to 
protect consumers from price gouging and 
other deceptive business practices, and he 
has long worked to protect consumers all 
across Colorado. 
Senator Foote has been a dedicated public 
servant to the people of Boulder County for 
many years, and he has made a tremendous 
impact on his community. I am grateful for his 
work, and I am sure that he will leave a lasting 
legacy in our great state. I thank him for his 
service and contributions to the state of Colo-
rado and wish him a restful and well-deserved 
retirement from public service.

SUPPORTING 
THE 
ELECTORAL 
COLLEGE 
OBJECTIONS 
IN 
THE 
STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the objection to counting the electoral 
votes from Pennsylvania. 
Violence today did not prevail. We are back 
in this chamber, carrying out our constitutional 
duty by holding this debate and eventually 
moving forward with our American tradition of 
a peaceful transfer of power. I want to echo 
the Majority Leader’s statements tonight that 
we need to act as Americans, as ‘‘we the peo-
ple,’’ and that is what I am doing—fighting to 
ensure the election integrity of this nation so 
that all Americans can have trust in the proc-
ess that defines us. I am fighting today to pre-
serve our democratic republic through a 
thoughtful debate on the obvious flaws of the 
2020 election process. 
While our actions today may not reverse the 
blatant failure of some states to properly vet 
the votes, this is an important venue to dis-
cuss the concerns of the many people who 
are dissatisfied with the 2020 election process. 
Serious irregularities and improprieties in 
several states raise legitimate concerns about 
the election administration in those states. 
These documented irregularities were then 
under reported or ignored altogether by the 
media. 
Although states have long been empowered 
to administer their elections, when a state or 
states blatantly fail to a provide a trustworthy 
process, those states should expect calls for 
accountability and transparency from citizens, 
officials, and states nationwide. 
This 2020 presidential election has shone a 
bright light on the fact that states need to step 
up and properly reform their election proc-
esses, where needed, to deliver trustworthy 
results for all Americans. 
Madam speaker, I urge my colleagues today 
to support this objection and to join me in the 
fight for election integrity.

DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, 
for the first time since 1814, the United States 
Capitol Building was breached by an angry 
mob. More than 200 years ago, it was British 
troops. This time it was domestic terrorists, in-
spired and encouraged by President Donald 
Trump. 
I started the day prepared to uphold my 
oath of office—an oath I took this past Sunday 
at the launch of the 117th Congress to ‘‘sup-
port and defend the Constitution of the United 
States against all enemies, foreign and do-
mestic.’’ 
I planned to uphold that oath by voting to 
certify the results of the Electoral College, and 
we are getting back to our work and certifying 
Joe Biden and KAMALA HARRIS as our next 
President and Vice President. We will do that 
work thanks to the efforts and bravery of the 
Capitol Police and other law enforcement 
agencies who have intervened. While there 
will be many questions about how this security 
breach occurred, I am incredibly grateful for 
the men and women who risked their lives to 
keep us safe today. 
As for the domestic terrorists who sought to 
overthrow our democracy, they must be pros-
ecuted. Their leader must be removed from of-
fice as soon as possible and their enablers in 
Congress must be held responsible for their 
role in this catastrophe. 
Despite 81 million votes for President-elect 
Joe Biden and Vice President-elect KAMALA 
HARRIS, multiple recounts, and more than 60 
failed lawsuits challenging the election results, 
many of my Republican colleagues followed 
Trump’s lead and pushed outlandish con-
spiracy theories and baseless claims of voter 
fraud without any evidence, entirely void of re-
ality. 
Many Congressional Republicans are seek-
ing to overturn the results of a free and fair 
election because they don’t like the results. 
They didn’t realize—or didn’t care—that their 
actions could result in a violent coup attempt. 
That’s exactly what happened today. 
The question now is a vital one: where does 
our country go from here? 
For many decades, we have had passionate 
but peaceful political disagreements—a shin-
ing beacon of democracy. We Americans do 
not support insurrection or mob rule. In short, 
we are so much better than this. 
We are now at a crossroads in our great na-
tion’s history, a moment where we see two di-
vergent paths in front of us. We can continue 
down a path of hyper-partisanship, divisive-
ness, and democratic decay, or we can try to 
heal our country. We can come together to re-
ject the violence we saw today and recommit 
to upholding the values that unite us as Ameri-
cans: democracy, justice, and equality. It is 
paramount that we choose the right path.

tions will be remembered as among the most 
shameful in our nation’s history. Generations

To those other colleagues—Republicans

path, I thank them for defending our democ-
racy. Our Constitution must never be taken for 
granted. We must continue to support and de-
fend it every day, as our oath demands. I am 
proud to serve alongside them, and I look for-
ward to addressing our nation’s greatest chal-

ELECTORAL COLLEGE CONTEST 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, today we will not pick the 
next president. For the people did that on No-
vember 3rd. Rather, today, in this House, we 
will decide whether American democracy sur-
vives. 
Let us be under no illusion. These are the 
stakes. 
If this objection succeeds, and the will of 7 
million Pennsylvania voters is cast aside, it will 
end our representative democracy. 
There is no reasonable debate about what 
happened in this election in Pennsylvania. 
Almost 7 million Pennsylvanians voted. 
Joe Biden won by over 80,000 votes. 
This was certified by bipartisan local elected 
officials, including Republican officials; 
And every single court, whether the judge is 
a Democrat or Republican, has reaffirmed the 
outcome. 
Now, the objectors claim we do not know 
the will of the people because the election in 
Pennsylvania was somehow conducted cor-
ruptly. Much of their objection centers around 
the state law passed in 2019, known as Act 
77, that gives voters the option of expanded 
mail-in voting. Objectors are alleging this law 
was somehow a plot by Democrats to dis-
advantage Republicans and rig elections. This 
is false. 
Here are the facts: 
Act 77 was a Republican-led effort in the 
Republican-controlled legislature. 
Literally every single Republican in the 
Pennsylvania Senate voted for it. 
In the state House, 105 Republicans voted 
for it; and only 2 voted against it. 
Here is what the Republican Speaker of the 
Pennsylvania House said about Act 77: 
‘‘This bill does not benefit one party or the 
other, or any one candidate or single elec-
tion. It was developed over a multi-year pe-
riod, with input from people of different 
backgrounds and regions of Pennsylvania. It 
serves to preserve the integrity of every elec-
tion and lift the voice of every voter in the 
Commonwealth.’’ 
There is no question as to the facts sur-
rounding this election. They are as clear as 
they are overwhelming. The only question that 
remains is this: will this House reaffirm our fi-
delity to our democracy, or will we end it? 
I must concede, Madam Speaker, I have 
been naı¨ve about one subject. I always just 
assumed our democracy would naturally en-
dure. I never even questioned it until the last 
several years. 
Two centuries ago, one of our Founding Fa-
thers, cautioned against this. John Adams 
wrote, ‘‘Remember democracy never lasts 
long. It soon wastes, exhausts, and murders 
itself. There never was a democracy yet that 
did not commit suicide.’’ 
I now realize the wisdom of his words. 
Never again, will I take for granted our democ-
racy. It must be defended by every generation. 
Always. 
But despite the alarm I feel that our democ-
racy has been brought to this breaking point, 
I still maintain hope. 
Growing up in Philadelphia, and raised in an 
immigrant family, I was often brought down to 
tour the historic sites. Every summer, without 
fail, we would spend a day seeing Independ-
ence Hall, Congress Hall, the Liberty Bell . . . 
It was at Independence Hall, where our na-
tion was declared free and our Constitution 
born. At the Constitutional Convention, the 
oldest and the most widely accomplished dele-
gate was Benjamin Franklin, one of our great-
est Founding Fathers, and my city’s greatest 
citizen. Physically feeble, he rarely spoke 
throughout the Convention. In a notable ad-
dress toward the close of the Convention, he 
gently urged dissenting delegates to put aside 
their legitimate criticisms and unite to adopt 
our Constitution. 
On the final day, as the last delegates were 
signing the document, Franklin pointed toward 
the sun on the back of the Convention presi-
dent’s chair. Observing that painters had 
found it difficult to distinguish between a rising 
sun from a setting sun, Franklin went on to 
say: 
‘‘I have often . . . in the course of the ses-
sion . . . looked at that sun behind the Presi-
dent without being able to tell whether it 
was rising or setting. But now at length I 
have the happiness to know it is a rising and 
not a setting sun.’’ 
Madam Speaker, on a day like today, when 
a mob has stormed the Capitol and some 
Members are threatening the core of our de-
mocracy, it can be hard to tell whether, for 
American democracy, the sun is rising or set-
ting. But I maintain my faith, that with an over-
whelming bipartisan majority in Congress, we 
will uphold the will of the people and our de-
mocracy will live.

CITIZEN’S COMMITTEE FOR ELEC-
TION INTEGRITY’S FINDINGS ON 
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS 
HON. RUSS FULCHER 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, election 
law and regulations must be developed and 
administered at the state and local level. To 
that end, I believe criteria and engagement 
from all Idahoans must be included in this de-
bate and want to enter the Committee’s rec-
ommendations into Congress’ current debate 
on free and fair elections. 
The Citizen’s Committee for Election In-
tegrity’s findings and recommendations: 
All political power rests with the people. 
Our Constitutionally guaranteed Repub-
lican form of government relies on free, fair, 
and honest elections to select our represent-
atives and leaders. 
To ensure equal protection and equal rep-
resentation of the people, laws governing our 
elections must meet certain minimum stand-
ards. 
It is the purpose of this Citizens Com-
mittee to concisely articulate the minimum 
standards for free, fair, and honest elections. 
These standards shall then be used by our 
local, state and federal legislators as a met-
ric for reviewing and revising election law to 
ensure free, fair, and honest elections where 
the outcome is accepted by all citizens of 
good will. 
Minimum Standards for Fair and Honest 
Elections 
Our Constitutionally guaranteed repub-
lican form of government relies on free, fair, 
and honest elections to select our represent-
atives and leaders. The standards listed here 
shall be used by our local, state, and federal 
legislators as a metric for reviewing and re-
vising election law to ensure free, fair, and 
honest elections where the outcome is ac-
cepted by all citizens of good will. 
All voting processes, other than those 
needed to preserve the privacy of a citizen’s 
vote, must be open and available for direct 
observation, with no minimum distance re-
quirements, and audit by agents of the can-
didates or parties. 
All election materials must have a secure 
chain of custody at all times. Election offi-
cials must be accompanied by observers 
when 
accessing 
any 
election 
materials. 
Records of the chain of custody shall be com-
plete and available for audit. 
All votes, regardless of voting method, 
shall be held to equal standards. 
Voters shall only be qualified electors that 
are able to verifiably provide their govern-
ment issued photo identity before being 
issued a ballot. Voters who provide false in-
formation, including information of voter 
qualification, should face severe penalties. 
As a condition of being issued a ballot, the 
voter’s identity and signature must be re-
corded in a permanent record (Poll Book). 
Original Ballots must have a physical form 
that allows voting choices to be examined 
and properly interpreted by the naked eye. 
Ballots must have features designed to pre-
vent counterfeiting. 
An auditable system for tracking the sta-
tus of all ballots must be implemented and 
maintained in the State of origin. The total 
number of printed ballots must equal the 
sum of the number of cast ballots, spoiled 
ballots, and unvoted ballots. 
Ballot tabulation must be conducted by 
two independent and unrelated systems. The 
difference in totals between the two systems 
must be less than one half the margin of vic-
tory or 0.1% of the vote total, whichever is 
less. Tabulating machines must only tab-
ulate and not modify ballots in any way, or 
be connected to the internet. 
Before the results of an election can be cer-
tified, the ballot counts must be reconciled 
with the voter records. The margin of uncer-
tainty must be less than one half the margin 
of victory or 0.1% of the vote total, which-
ever is less. 
Lists of qualified electors must be purged 
of unqualified persons 180 days before an 
election. Voter Rolls should be vetted and 
compared with available government records 
to identify duplicate or Ineligible registra-
tions. 
Laws and regulations governing an elec-
tion may not be changed for 180 days prior to 
that election. 
All election records should be retained and 
preserved for not less than 22 months.

CONGRATULATING 
BOULDER 
COUNTY 
COMMISSIONER 
DEB 
GARDNER ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, today I wish 
to recognize Ms. Deb Gardner, who has 
served the people of Boulder County for over 
a decade, and since 2012, has tirelessly de-
voted herself to serving her community as a 
Boulder County Commissioner. Over the past 
eight years, Deb has worked hard to make 
Boulder County a better place. In light of 
Deb’s retirement, I want to take the oppor-
tunity to commend her distinguished career in 
public service. 
Deb has never been afraid to stand up for 
what she believes in. Her work in Boulder is 
a reflection of her passion for equity, edu-
cation, and the environment. A truly indispen-
sable community member, she has fought to 
maintain Boulder County’s natural beauty and 
ensure that everyone feels welcome in the 
community. 
Prior to becoming a County Commissioner, 
she represented Colorado’s 11th district, and 
the people of Boulder County, in the Colorado 
State Legislature as a State Representative, 
where she served on the House Transpor-
tation, Legislative Audit, Business and Eco-
nomic Development, and Health Benefit Ex-
change Review committees. She has helped 
her community through countless disasters, in-
cluding the 2013 flooding, historic wildfires, 
and the immense challenges posed by the 
COVID–19 pandemic this year, and I am 
grateful for her leadership. 
For the entirety of her career, Deb has led 
by example and inspired countless others 
along the way. I am grateful for her distin-
guished record of service, and I thank Com-
missioner Gardner for her service to her com-
munity. I wish her a restful and well-deserved 
retirement.

Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to voice my concerns regarding the 
irregularities and improprieties in the 2020 
General Election. As I have said time and time 
again, the American people deserve to have 
full faith in our elections. The numerous votes 
cast by mail this year—due to the pandemic— 
have been plagued by allegations of fraud and 
wrongdoing. I watched with great concern as 
President Trump’s legal team brought forth 
witnesses, sworn affidavits, and reams of le-
gitimate evidence to courts in various states. 
There are countless, incontestable examples 
wherein governors, election officials, and 
judges altered states’ election procedures in 
clear violation of Article II of the U.S. Constitu-
tion. Article II grants state legislatures—and 
only the state legislatures—the explicit power 
to determine the manner of appointing presi-
dential electors. 
In keeping with this constitutional responsi-
bility, state legislatures have established de-
tailed rules by which that state’s electoral 
process and appointment of presidential elec-
tors should be conducted. However, in the 
months before the 2020 election, it is undeni-
able that—in several key states—either state 
court judges or state executive officials acted 
deliberately to fundamentally change state 
election law, usurping the state legislature’s 
express authority under the Constitution. 
In violation of the Constitution and with full 
knowledge of mail-in voting vulnerabilities, 
state officials, activists, and Democrat-led law-
suits in numerous states opened our electoral 
processes to fraud and abuse. The sheer vol-
ume of mail-in voting alone triggered not just 
administrative errors and clerical mistakes but 
actual election crimes. 
As an alumnus of the Texas House of Rep-
resentatives, I understand and guard zealously 
the prerogatives of state legislatures. As such, 
I feel strongly that the Supreme Court should 
have upheld the authority of those legislatures 
to establish the manner of appointing electors. 
Moreover, it was incumbent upon the court to 
determine the constitutional validity of any bal-
lots that were cast under rules and procedures 
established by entities other than state legisla-
tures. 
Put bluntly, the usurpation of legislative 
power in several states produced unconstitu-
tional ballots. As we asserted in our amicus 
brief that accompanied the Texas case, any 
state executive or judicial attempt to determine 
the manner of choosing electors-especially 
any attempt that directly contradicts the will of 
the state legislature—is void ab initio (‘‘from 
the beginning’’). 
Regrettably, on December 11th, SCOTUS 
denied Texas’ motion for lack of standing, 
without ruling on the merits of the case or the 
questions of fact therein. However, Justice 
Samuel Alito, joined by Justice Clarence 
Thomas, disagreed with the high court’s ruling, 
writing that, ‘‘In my view, we do not have dis-
cretion to deny the filing of a bill of complaint 
in a case that falls within our original jurisdic-
tion . . . I would therefore grant the motion to 
file the bill of complaint . . . ’’ I, too, believe 
that the Supreme Court got it wrong. That 
highest court has original jurisdiction over, 
specifically, suits involving two or more states. 
Today, we the Congress—on behalf of ‘‘We 
The People’’—will exercise our constitutional 
duty as the final judge, jury, and arbiter of all 
contested congressional, senatorial, and presi-
dential elections. The legitimacy of our repub-
lic rests on the foundation that our elections— 
whether for President of the United States or 
any other office—are transparent, fairly admin-
istered, and above board. With the undeniable 
knowledge of illegal changes to various state 
election laws, enacted by parties other than 
the respective state legislatures, we (the Con-
gress) constitute the last line of defense in en-
suring the trust of our citizens in the integrity 
of their ballots. 
Every single member of Congress swore an 
oath to uphold the Constitution of the United 
States of America. Our constitutional republic 
has endured for nearly-two and a half cen-
turies based on the consent of the governed. 
That consent is grounded in the confidence of 
our people in the legitimacy of our institutions 
of government, the most fundamental being 
free and fair elections. The erosion of that 
foundation jeopardizes the stability of the re-
public. 
I will therefore join my colleagues today in 
objecting to counting the electoral votes of Ari-
zona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsyl-
vania, and Wisconsin, to restore the integrity 
of our electoral process.

CITIZEN’S COMMITTEE FOR ELEC-
TION INTEGRITY’S FINDINGS ON 
FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, election 
law and regulations must be developed and 
administered at the state and local level. To 
that end, I believe criteria and engagement 
from all Idahoans must be included in this de-
bate and want to enter the Committee’s rec-
ommendations into Congress’ current debate 
on free and fair elections. 
The Citizen’s Committee for Election In-
tegrity’s findings and recommendations: 
All political power rests with the people. 
Our Constitutionally guaranteed Repub-
lican form of government relies on free, fair, 
and honest elections to select our represent-
atives and leaders. 
To ensure equal protection and equal rep-
resentation of the people, laws governing our 
elections must meet certain minimum stand-
ards. 
It is the purpose of this Citizens Com-
mittee to concisely articulate the minimum 
standards for free, fair, and honest elections. 
These standards shall then be used by our 
local, state and federal legislators as a met-
ric for reviewing and revising election law to 
ensure free, fair, and honest elections where 
the outcome is accepted by all citizens of 
good will. 
Minimum Standards for Fair and Honest 
Elections 
Our Constitutionally guaranteed repub-
lican form of government relies on free, fair, 
and honest elections to select our represent-
atives and leaders. The standards listed here 
shall be used by our local, state and federal 
legislators as a metric for reviewing and re-
vising election law to ensure free, fair, and 
honest elections where the outcome is ac-
cepted by all citizens of good will. 
All voting processes, other than those 
needed to preserve the privacy of a citizen’s 
vote, must be open and available for direct 
observation, with no minimum distance re-
quirements, and audit by agents of the can-
didates or parties. 
All election materials must have a secure 
chain of custody at all times. Election offi-
cials must be accompanied by observers 
when 
accessing 
any 
election 
materials. 
Records of the chain of custody shall be com-
plete and available for audit. 
All votes, regardless of voting method, 
shall be held to equal standards. 
Voters shall only be qualified electors that 
are able to verifiably provide their govern-
ment issued photo identity before being 
issued a ballot. Voters who provide false in-
formation, including information of voter 
qualification, should face severe penalties. 
As a condition of being issued a ballot, the 
voter’s identity and signature must be re-
corded in a permanent record (Poll Book).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E19 
January 6, 2021 
Original Ballots must have a physical form 
that allows voting choices to be examined 
and properly interpreted by the naked eye. 
Ballots must have features designed to pre-
vent counterfeiting. 
An auditable system for tracking the sta-
tus of all ballots must be implemented and 
maintained in the State of origin. The total 
number of printed ballots must equal the 
sum of the number of cast ballots, spoiled 
ballots, and unvoted ballots. 
Ballot tabulation must be conducted by 
two independent and unrelated systems. The 
difference in totals between the two systems 
must be less than one half the margin of vic-
tory or 0.1% of the vote total, whichever is 
less. Tabulating machines must only tab-
ulate and not modify ballots in any way, or 
be connected to the internet. 
Before the results of an election can be cer-
tified, the ballot counts must be reconciled 
with the voter records. The margin of uncer-
tainty must be less than one half the margin 
of victory or 0.1% of the vote total, which-
ever is less. 
Lists of qualified electors must be purged 
of unqualified persons 180 days before an 
election. Voter Rolls should be vetted and 
compared with available government records 
to identify duplicate or ineligible registra-
tions. 
Laws and regulations governing an elec-
tion may not be changed for 180 days prior to 
that election. 
All election records should be retained and 
preserved for not less than 22 months. 
Voter identification for provisional ballots 
must be verified, with information provided 
by the voter, prior to that ballot being 
counted.

REGARDING 
JOINT 
SESSION 
OF 
CONGRESS 
TO 
COUNT 
ELEC-
TORAL BALLOTS 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 6, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the House Committees on 
the Judiciary and Homeland Security Com-
mittee; Ranking Member of the Judiciary Sub-
committee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Se-
curity, and Investigations, and the Congres-
sional Voting Rights Caucus, I rise today to 
offer thoughts and reflections on the congres-
sional responsibility to bear witness to the 
counting of electoral votes to determine for-
mally the persons elected President and Vice 
President of the United States and on the 
campaign and election that brought us to this 
day. 
The outcome of that count is not in doubt 
and has not been since November 7, 2020, 
when it became clear that Democratic can-
didates Joseph R. Biden and KAMALA HARRIS 
had won the states of Georgia, Pennsylvania, 
and Arizona to become the 46th President and 
59th Vice-President of the United States, earn-
ing 306 electoral votes, 36 more than the 270 
needed for election. 
The results in those states, as well as every 
other state that chose presidential electors on 
November 3, 2020, has been certified and 
wherever necessary upheld against legal chal-
lenge by the courts in the affected states. 
On December 14, 2020, presidential elec-
tors met in their respective state capitols to 
cast their votes for President and Vice-Presi-
dent, with the documentary and video evi-
dence clearly demonstrating that the Biden/ 
Harris ticket was the clear and unassailable 
choice of the Electoral College. 
The counting of the electors’ ballot today will 
ratify the outcome that has been foretold for 
months and only those with the most conspira-
torial mindset and the willing suspension of 
disbelief, like the current occupant of the 
White House and his band of acolytes con-
sisting of 140 Members of the House and 12 
U.S. senators, could persist in the delusion 
that the vox populi, the voice of the people, 
has not spoken clearly and definitively. 
Madam Speaker, the Biden/Harris ticket 
won the national popular vote going away, by 
more than 7 million votes, 81.3 million to 74.2 
million. 
Their victory was so sweeping that it won 
the majority of states, including five states won 
four years ago by the loser, including Georgia, 
which a Democratic candidate had not won 
since 1992, and Arizona, which last voted 
Democratic in 1996. 
This day is not like its counterpart of 2001, 
when the determination of the winner hung in 
the balance on the outcome of the contest in 
Florida, where 537 votes out of 5.82 million 
votes cast separated the candidates and the 
U.S. Supreme Court halted the vote recount 
ordered by the Supreme Court of Florida, thus 
leaving reasonable persons to question who 
was the true winner of that state’s decisive 25 
electoral votes. 
This day is not like 2005, where the out-
come hinged on the 18 electoral votes of 
Ohio, and where state officials refused to 
count provisional ballots and engaged in other 
tactics alleged to be taken to suppress the 
votes of racial minorities. 
And certainly this day is not like 2017, when 
Congress met to count the electoral votes cast 
in the state’s first American presidential elec-
tion in which the U.S. Intelligence Community 
had confirmed was the subject of cyberattacks 
and other subversive activities of entities allied 
with the Government of Russia that were un-
dertaken for the express purpose of influ-
encing the outcome to secure the election of 
its preferred candidate, Donald Trump, who it 
should be added, openly invited a hostile for-
eign power to launch cyberattacks against his 
political opponent. 
Another important distinction involving the 
2016 election is that it was the first presi-
dential election held since the Supreme Court 
issued the notorious decision in Shelby Coun-
ty v. Holder, which neutered the preclearance 
provisions of the Voting Rights Act and ad-
versely affected the ability of hundreds of 
thousands of persons to cast a ballot and 
have their vote counted. 
In contrast, American voters in 2020 were 
forewarned and forearmed against Russian in-
terference, propaganda, and disinformation 
and with no backing but with the active resist-
ance of the Chief Executive, the governments 
of the United States and the individual states 
took active measures to ensure the security 
and integrity of election systems against fraud 
and undue interference. 
This effort was so successful that the Elec-
tion Infrastructure Government Coordinating 
Council (GCC) Executive Committee, con-
sisting of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infra-
structure Security Agency (CISA), U.S. Elec-
tion Assistance Commission, National Asso-
ciation of Secretaries of State, and the Na-
tional Association of State Election Directors, 
issued the following statement on November 
12, 2020: 
The November 3rd election was the most 
secure in American history. Right now, 
across the country, election officials are re-
viewing and double checking the entire elec-
tion process prior to finalizing the result. 
When states have close elections, many 
will recount ballots. All of the states with 
close results in the 2020 presidential race 
have paper records of each vote, allowing the 
ability to go back and count each ballot if 
necessary. This is an added benefit for secu-
rity and resilience. This process allows for 
the identification and correction of any mis-
takes or errors. There is no evidence that 
any voting system deleted or lost votes, 
changed votes, or was in any way com-
promised. 
Even United States Attorney General Wil-
liam P. Barr, the most politically biased per-
son, to hold that office, publicly acknowledged 
that although U.S. attorneys and FBI agents 
had followed up on specific complaints and in-
formation they had received, ‘‘to date, we 
have not seen fraud on a scale that could 
have effected a different outcome in the elec-
tion.’’ 
Under the laws of every state, the Trump 
Campaign was entitled to bring legal chal-
lenges to the administration of the election in 
any state where it felt aggrieved, and it took 
ample advantage of these opportunities, bring-
ing scores of lawsuits alleging ‘‘wide-spread 
fraud,’’ requesting recounts, or demanding that 
votes cast for the Democratic candidate be 
thrown out or simply not counted. 
These legal challenges were met with colos-
sal failure, the Trump Campaign suffering 
stinging defeats in more than 65 cases; its 
lone success came in Pennsylvania where a 
court granted its request to allow monitors to 
observe ballot tabulation from a distance of six 
rather than 10 feet away . 
Which brings us to this day, when die-hard 
followers of the current occupant of the White 
House, a group I call the ‘‘Lost Cause Cau-
cus,’’ now seek to revive and press forward 
with the discredited and rejected claims of the 
Trump Campaign that the elections in the 
states that were key to bringing about his re-
sounding defeat were ‘‘rigged’’ or ‘‘fraudulent’’ 
or the result of some vague conspiracy by the 
‘‘Deep State.’’ 
Madam Speaker, this is utter nonsense; 
which I show by examining the challenge to 
the electors from Pennsylvania, where like 
Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg, Trump pitched 
his flag and made his grand stand. 
Over 6.9 million Pennsylvanians voted in 
that election, with over 2.6 million of those vot-
ers using mail-in or absentee ballots; Vice 
President Biden received 3,459,923 votes, 
easily beating Trump, by 81,660 votes. 
Vice-President Biden’s vote margin was 
twice as large as was Trump’s when he won 
the state in an upset in 2016. 
Madam Speaker, it is not difficult to under-
stand why so many Pennsylvanians voted in 
2019, and by mail in unprecedented numbers. 
In 2019, with broad and bipartisan support, 
the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted 
Act 77 of 2019, which made several important 
updates and improvements to Pennsylvania’s 
Election Code, Act of Oct. 31, 2019 (P.L. 552, 
No. 77), 2019 Pa. Legis. Serv. 2019–77 (S.B. 
421) (West) (‘‘Act 77’’). 
Among these were provisions that, for the 
first time, offered the option of mail-in voting to

all 
Pennsylvania 
electors. 
See 
25 
P.S. 
§§ 3150.11–3150.17. 
This change was a significant development 
that made it easier for all Pennsylvanians to 
exercise their right to vote and brought the 
state in line with the practice of dozens of 
other states. 
Under Act 77, voters had until October 27, 
2020, to request a mail-in ballot for this year’s 
November 3rd General Election. 25 P.S. 
§ 3150.12a(a). 
Act 77 set 8:00 p.m. on Election Day as the 
due date for returning those ballots to the 
county boards of elections. 25 P.S. § 3150.16. 
The Election Code provides for a variety of 
safeguards to ensure the integrity of this proc-
ess. See 25 P.S. § 3146.8(g)(3); 25 P.S. 
§ 3146.2c; 25 P.S. § 3146.8 (g)(4); 25 P.S. 
§ 3150.12b(a)(2). 
The presidential election results were cer-
tified, and Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf 
signed the Certificate of Ascertainment on No-
vember 24, 2020, long in advance of the re-
quired date to fall under the ‘‘Safe Harbor’’ 
provision of three-day the governing Electoral 
Count Act of 1887, 3 U.S.C. § 5, making the 
certification of Pennsylvania’s electors conclu-
sive. 
Madam Speaker, multiple challenges were 
made to the certification of Pennsylvania’s 
electors, all of which were rejected by both 
state and federal courts. 
First, there is no merit or truth to the claim 
that the Pennsylvania Secretary of State ‘‘ab-
rogated’’ the mandatory signature verification 
requirement for absentee or mail-in ballots. 
See In re Nov. 3, 2020 Election, 240 A.3d 
591, 610 (Pa. 2020) (Election Code does not 
authorize county election boards to reject mail- 
in ballots based on an analysis of a voter’s 
signature. ‘‘[A]t no time did the Code provide 
for challenges to ballot signatures.’’). 
Far from usurping any legislative authority, 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court refused ‘‘to 
rewrite a statute in order to supply terms 
which [we]re not present therein.’’ Id. at 14. 
A federal judge reached the same result. 
See In Donald Trump for President, Inc. v. 
Boockvar, 2020 WL 5997680, at *58 (W.D. 
Pa. Oct. 10, 2020) (‘‘[T]he Election Code does 
not impose a signature-comparison require-
ment for mail-in and absentee ballots.’’). 
Second, there is a similar lack of merit and 
truth to the claim that certain Pennsylvania 
county boards of elections did not grant 
pollwatchers access to the opening, counting, 
and recording of absentee and mail-in ballots. 
See In re Canvassing Observation, lA.3d l, 
2020 WL 6737895, *8–9 (Pa. 2020) (holding 
that state law re-quires candidate representa-
tives to be in the room but the viewing dis-
tance is committed to the county boards, 
which, in that case, was reasonable); Trump 
for President, Inc. v. Sec’y of Pennsylvania, 
2020 WL 7012522, at *8 (3d Cir. Nov. 27, 
2020) (affirming dismissal of poll-watcher 
claim, in part, because the Trump Campaign 
‘‘has already raised and lost most of these 
state-law issues, and it cannot relitigate them 
here.’’). 
Third, there is no basis to a claim that cer-
tain Pennsylvania counties adopted differential 
standards favoring voters in Philadelphia and 
Allegheny Counties with the intent to favor 
former Vice President Biden. 
This claim was raised and dismissed in 
Trump v. Boockvar, 4:20––cv–02078 (M.D. 
Pa. Nov. 18, 2020) because those charges 
were backed by neither specific allegations 
nor evidence. Trump for President, Inc. v. 
Sec’y of Pennsylvania, 2020 WL 7012522, at 
*8 (3d Cir. Nov. 27, 2020). 
Fourth, that certain counties permitted vot-
ers to cure minor defects in mail-in ballots was 
permissible under Pennsylvania law because 
minor defects—such as a failure to handwrite 
the voter’s name and/or address on the dec-
laration—did not, in fact, void the ballot. See 
In re Canvass of Absentee & Mail-in Ballots of 
November 3, 2020 Gen. Election, 29 WAP 
2020, lA.3dl, 2020 WL 6866415, *15 (Pa. 
Nov. 23, 2020) (‘‘We have conducted that 
analysis here and we hold that a signed but 
undated declaration is sufficient and does not 
implicate any weighty interest. Hence, the lack 
of a handwritten date cannot result in vote dis-
qualification.’’); Trump v. Boockvar, 2020 WL 
6821992, *12 (M.D. Pa. 2020) (‘‘it is perfectly 
rational for a state to provide counties discre-
tion to notify voters that they may cure proce-
durally defective mail-in ballots’’), aff’d 2020 
WL 7012522. 
Fifth, there was no state law violation when 
the Pennsylvania Supreme Court temporarily 
modified the deadline for the receipt of mail-in 
and absentee ballots, because state constitu-
tional law required it. See Pa. Democratic 
Party v. Boockvar, 238 A.3d 345, 369–72 (Pa. 
2020). 
Nothing in the Elections Clause of Article I 
‘‘instructs, nor has the Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court ever held, that a state legislature may 
prescribe regulations on the time, place, and 
manner of holding federal elections in defiance 
of provisions of the State’s constitution.’’ Ari-
zona State Legislature v. Arizona Indep. Re-
districting Comm’n, 576 U.S. 787, 817–18 
(2015) (AIRC). The same is true for the Elec-
tor Clause in Article II. 
Sixth, there is no truth to the claim that 
Pennsylvania ‘‘broke its promise to the U.S. 
Supreme Court to segregate ballots and co-
mingled illegal late ballots . 
The Pennsylvania Secretary of State had al-
ready instructed that all ballots received during 
the three-day period be segregated and count-
ed separately and Justice Alito adopted these 
instructions by the Secretary as an order of 
the Court. 
The Pennsylvania county boards of elec-
tions complied with that order; qualified ballots 
received during the three-day extension were 
segregated and counted separately. 
The number of such ballots is too small to 
change the outcome of any federal election in 
Pennsylvania. 
Finally, there is nothing sinister, surprising, 
or fraudulent in the fact that late-counted mail- 
in ballots eviscerated Trump’s temporary lead 
in the popular vote by disproportionately favor-
ing Vice-President Biden. 
The votes counted before 3 a.m. and those 
counted afterwards were indisputably not ‘‘ran-
domly drawn’’ from the same population of 
votes, as those counted earlier were predomi-
nantly in-person votes while those counted 
later were predominantly mail-in votes . 
Even the proponents of this bogus chal-
lenge to Pennsylvania’s electors admit that 
Democratic voters voted by mail at two to 
three times the rate of Republicans. 
Both this fact and the expectation that it 
would result in a shift in President-Elect 
Biden’s favor as mail-in votes were counted 
were widely reported months ahead of the 
election. 
Madam Speaker, as I noted at the outset, 
we are here today to exercise a duty imposed 
on Members of the House and the Senate by 
the Constitution and laws of the United States. 
But it is true that although we are called 
upon to bear witness to the counting of elec-
toral votes, our role is not confined to passive 
observation. 
The Constitution and the law, specifically 
Section 15 of the Electoral College Act, 3 
U.S.C. § 1 et seq., authorizes Representatives 
and Senators to object to the counting of any 
vote cast by an elector if in their judgment the 
vote was not ‘‘regularly given’’ or the person 
casting the vote was not ‘‘lawfully certified’’ as 
an elector. 
The Constitution devolves this solemn duty 
upon the people’s representatives, the Con-
gress, because the linchpin of representative 
democracy is public confidence in the political 
system, regime, and community. 
That confidence in turn rests upon the ex-
tent to which the public has faith that the sys-
tem employed to select its leaders accurately 
reflects its preferences. 
At bottom, this means that all citizens cast-
ing a vote have a fundamental right and rea-
sonable expectation that their votes count and 
are counted. 
For these reasons, I owe it to my constitu-
ents and to the American people to consider 
each electoral vote certificate as it is pre-
sented and accept those that appear to be 
meritorious. 
Were any electoral vote certificate not to 
satisfy the statutory requirement that the votes 
reflected on the lists were ‘‘regularly given’ by 
‘‘lawfully certified’’ electors I would oppose it. 
But that is not the case before us because 
the votes before us were regularly given by 
lawfully certified electors, whose status was 
resolved, where need be, at least six days be-
fore the meeting of electors pursuant to laws 
that were in place before the election as re-
quired by Section 5 of the Electoral Count Act, 
3 U.S.C. § 5. 
That means the validity of their appointment 
is conclusive and their vote preferences bind-
ing on us. 
For this reason, I oppose the objections 
raised and accept the final vote tally that will 
be announced by the President of the Senate 
at its conclusion, and in doing so will be keep-
ing faith with the admonition and prayer made 
by President Lincoln over the graves of patri-
ots that ‘government of the people, by the 
people, for the people, shall not perish from 
the earth.’’

measures that would help combat climate 
change and protect our treasured public lands 
and open spaces. During her time as a Coun-
ty Commissioner, she also represented Boul-
der County on the Denver Regional Council of 
Governments, and as the Representative to 
the Statewide Transportation Advisory Com-
mittee. She has served as a member of the 
Metro Area County Commissioners, which she 
chaired in 2016, and was recently appointed 
by the Governor of Colorado to the Colorado 
Air Quality Control Commission. In this latter 
position, Commissioner Jones has been able 
to utilize her extensive experience to fight for 
cleaner air for all Coloradans. She has helped 
her community through countless disasters, in-
cluding the 2013 flooding, historic wildfires, 
and the immense challenges posed by the 
COVID–19 pandemic this year, and I am 
thankful for her leadership. 
I am grateful that Commissioner Jones 
plans to continue her environmental work. 
While she leaves enormously big shoes to fill, 
her legacy will not be forgotten. On behalf of 
the people of Colorado’s 2nd Congressional 
district, I would like to express my deepest 
gratitude for her service.
