PRAYER 
Reverend Dr. Dan C. Cummins, Cap-
itol Worship, Washington, D.C., offered 
the following prayer: 
Heavenly 
Father, 
creator 
of 
all 
things, throughout our history have 
plagues 
and 
diseases 
pillaged 
our 
human frailties. Still another levia-
than plunders Your children—stealing, 
destroying, and killing without preju-
dice. We beseech You this morning 
without timidity, but in all reverence 
and humiliation, reminding You of 
Your promise to us, Your children, 
that if destruction should come in the 
guise of drought or by the hordes of lo-
custs or the peril of pestilence, and 
whether it comes with the morning’s 
sun, the noonday heat, or the darkness 
of night, or whether it comes by na-
ture’s chance, man’s nefarious deed, or 
by Your outstretched hand, You prom-
ised that if Your people, who are called 
by Your name, shall humble them-
selves, pray, seek Your face, and turn 
from our wicked ways, You will hear us 
from heaven, forgive our sin, and heal 
our land. 
For this we shall do and plead today, 
O Lord. 
In Jesus’ name, amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1698 
March 16, 2020 
DIRECTING THE CLERK OF THE 
HOUSE 
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES 
TO MAKE CORRECTIONS IN THE 
ENGROSSMENT OF H.R. 6201 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the Chair lays before the 
House the following resolution (H. Res. 
904) directing the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives to make corrections in 
the engrossment of H.R. 6201. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the consideration of the 
resolution? 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the right to object. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas is recognized on his 
reservation. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we 
had rushed this bill to the floor—I 
would say rush. It had been an all-day 
thing Thursday and and all-day event 
Friday, and most of us were not part of 
the negotiations. We kept getting dif-
ferent versions of the bill that was 
going to be coming to the floor, and 
about 9 o’clock I got the latest ren-
dition and had read that. I made a lot 
of notes and tags and things I was con-
cerned about, and then I thought that 
was what we were going to be voting on 
that night; but then there was a new 
version filed immediately before mid-
night, and we voted about 12:30. 
So I had real concerns about some of 
the wordings, some of the problems. Of 
course, as President Obama said, elec-
tions have consequences; the majority 
is going to get a whole lot more of 
what they want in a bill than the mi-
nority. I totally understand that, but 
there were some concerns about mat-
ters. 
I am very concerned about small 
businesses. It had been changed from 
other laws, exempting those with over 
50 or more—like in ObamaCare—em-
ployees. Yet in this one, it changed ex-
empting under 500 to under 50—I’m 
sorry—applying to everybody under 
500. That included all those under 50. 
A big concern is that it was going to 
overwhelm some of our smallest busi-
nesses. We know a majority of Ameri-
cans work for small businesses. They 
create more job opportunities. So this 
was a big deal. But though I didn’t sup-
port the bill, and I still have big con-
cerns, I am very grateful for the efforts 
of the majority, the President, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, and staff mem-
bers of our minority leader who have 
continued to negotiate and work to try 
to get some of these problems figured 
out. 
So there is no question in my mind 
at this point that what are being called 
technical corrections make the bill 
better than it was when it got passed in 
the wee hours Saturday morning. So 
because of that, Madam Speaker, I 
withdraw my objection to the technical 
corrections so there may be unanimous 
consent now that I withdraw my objec-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
ervation of the gentleman from Texas 
is withdrawn. 
Is there objection to consideration of 
the resolution? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 904 
Resolved, That the Clerk of the House of 
Representatives shall, in the engrossment of 
bill H.R. 6201, make the following correc-
tions:

Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, MONDAY, MARCH 16, 2020 
No. 50 
Senate 
The Senate met at 3 p.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, as our Nation faces this 
national state of emergency, we pause 
to thank You with our whole hearts for 
the gift of this day. In spite of chal-
lenges that often seem insurmountable, 
You remain our hope for the years to 
come. As our Senators strive to meet 
the challenge of the coronavirus, vali-
date their efforts with Your Divine 
blessings. 
You are the righteous judge who 
knows even the motives of our hearts. 
May Your providential purposes be ful-
filled in our Nation and world. Touch 
this land we love with Your healing 
hands. 
We pray in Your powerful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
HAWLEY). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to speak in morn-
ing business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
Friday, President Trump declared a na-
tional emergency concerning the novel 
coronavirus 
disease 
outbreak. 
This 
proclamation frees up additional re-
sources to further efforts to contain 
and combat the virus. 
Over the weekend, my Governor of 
Iowa, Kim Reynolds, confirmed Iowa’s 
first case of community-spread COVID– 
19, which was in Dallas County, Iowa. 
It is very important to continue to 
take commonsense precautions. Stay 
home if you are sick, wash your hands, 
avoid large gatherings, and heed the 
advice of health officials. Extra cau-
tion now will save lives later. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the 
new coronavirus has spread from China 
throughout the world, and it is chal-
lenging our Nation in new ways. Across 
our country, daily routines are being 
disrupted, families are grappling with 
school 
closings 
and 
changes 
to 
childcare, major American companies 
and institutions are literally modifying 
how they do business, and a growing 
number of Main Street small busi-
nesses face the possibility of signifi-
cant disruptions as more and more 
communities begin to ‘‘hunker down,’’ 
as Dr. Fauci put it, on the advice of 
public health experts and local leaders. 
As an aside, I have noticed that a lot 
of the discussion in the media has fo-
cused on individuals who may be tem-
porarily transitioning from office work 
to working from home. So I want to es-
pecially acknowledge the many other 
hard-working 
Americans 
for 
whom 
telework is not an option. Now, more 
than ever, we are reminded who really 
keeps this country running: the hard- 
working men and women who grow 
things, who make things, who drive 
trucks and move goods across the 
country, who mine coal or otherwise 
produce domestic energy and, literally, 
power our communities, who run the 
stores and shops we rely on, who serve 
our communities as police and first re-
sponders, and, of course, especially the 
dedicated frontline healthcare profes-
sionals, who work tirelessly to heal 
and protect all the rest of us. 
To all Americans—but, most espe-
cially, to those hard-working people 
whose efforts are going to get our 
country through this challenge—I have 
one message: The Senate stands with 
you. We stand with American workers 
and families, we stand with American 
businesses, and we stand with the pub-
lic health experts and the heroic front-
line medical professionals whom our 
Nation seems poised to lean on as heav-
ily as we have at any point in recent 
memory. 
The Senate is committed to meeting 
these uncertain times with bold and bi-
partisan solutions. That is what we did 
a little more than a week ago, when 
the Senate passed billions of dollars in 
emergency funding for health and 
small businesses with an overwhelming 
bipartisan vote and put it on the Presi-
dent’s desk. That is what we are going 
to keep doing this week, particularly if 
the House of Representatives can actu-
ally complete its work and transmit a 
finished product of its relief over to us. 
And it is what we are going to keep 
doing in the days and weeks ahead. 
With respect to the House-passed leg-
islation, I understand the House chose 
to proceed with their planned 1-week 
recess, despite not having finished 
processing their bill. As of this after-
noon, we are still waiting for the House 
to reach a decision on possible tech-
nical corrections and to submit a final

S1748 
March 16, 2020 
product to us here in the Senate. We 
cannot consider the legislation until 
we get it, but I know that Senators on 
both sides have spent the last several 
days carefully studying the House pro-
posal, and I know that all of us are 
eager to act quickly to support Amer-
ican workers, families, and small busi-
nesses. 
Even more broadly, Senate Repub-
licans are absolutely convinced that 
the House’s bill can only be the begin-
ning—just the beginning—of Congress’s 
efforts to secure our economy and sup-
port American families. This is a 
unique challenge—a unique challenge. 
Unlike 
in 
any 
other 
tough 
cir-
cumstances, our short-term goal is not 
simply to bring economic activity 
right back to normal starting tomor-
row. Instead, our task is to secure the 
historically strong foundation of our 
Nation’s economy and support Ameri-
cans during this period when public 
health may require that some normal 
activities simply be scaled back. 
I have spoken with countless col-
leagues and committee chairmen over 
the last several days. We agree there 
are three major areas where the Senate 
must continue to develop bold and bi-
partisan action: 
No. 1, we will need to take further 
steps to assist individual Americans 
and families with financial challenges 
in the weeks and months ahead. 
No. 2, we will need to further signifi-
cant actions to secure our Nation’s 
economy—particularly 
Main 
Street 
small businesses—and safeguard our 
historically strong economic founda-
tion through this period. 
No. 3, we will need further steps to 
ready our healthcare system and sup-
port 
our 
Nation’s 
medical 
profes-
sionals. 
The Senate majority is already work-
ing toward next steps on all three of 
those fronts. I hope further bold action 
can be just as bipartisan and collabo-
rative as the process by which we 
passed the first set of additional funds. 
We must work with each other in the 
bipartisan 
spirit 
this 
moment 
de-
mands—and with the administration 
and the House—to deliver results for 
our country. 
f 
USA FREEDOM REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2020 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on one other important matter, 
late last night, several critical authori-
ties that law enforcement uses to keep 
Americans safe lapsed into expiration. 
Barring Senate action, these important 
tools, which help protect the homeland 
from terrorists and counter foreign in-
telligence activities on U.S. soil, will 
remain offline. 
Fortunately, in the weeks leading up 
to this deadline, the Attorney General 
engaged in extensive bipartisan talks 
with Members of the House—of both 
parties—to try to reach a solution. The 
resulting legislation, which the House 
passed last week by large margins 
within each party, strikes a key bal-
ance. It reauthorizes the tools which 
our national security requires, while 
also imposing a number of new reforms 
which basic accountability demands. 
We can’t let the relative success of 
these tools at preserving the safety and 
security of our country mislead us to 
believe they are unnecessary. It is just 
the opposite. Terrorist organizations 
still search constantly for opportuni-
ties to strike on American soil. Hostile 
foreign intelligence services—whether 
Chinese, Russian, or Iranian—still seek 
to conduct operations within our bor-
ders, to recruit assets and agents 
among our population. 
These threats will not wait around if 
the United States delays restocking 
our toolbox, so the Senate should not 
wait to act. I sincerely hope that even 
our colleagues who may wish to vote 
against the House bill will not make us 
prolong this brief lapse in authorities 
and that we will be able to get these 
tools back online this week.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
USA FREEDOM REAUTHORIZATION 
ACT OF 2020—MOTION TO PROCEED 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to consideration of the motion to 
proceed to H.R. 6172, which the clerk 
will report. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
Motion to proceed to Calendar No. 440, 
H.R. 6172, a bill to amend the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act of 1978 to prohibit 
the production of certain business records, 
and for other purposes. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first 
let me thank the staff who are here 
today 
under 
these 
difficult 
cir-
cumstances—here at the desk, the Ser-
geant at Arms, the doorkeepers, the 
police officers, and the many others 
who are here today. We thank them, as 
always. They are the unsung heroes of 
the Senate. 
Now, as the Senate returns this week 
in a time of extraordinary challenge 
for our country, COVID–19, known as 
the coronavirus, continues to spread 
rapidly. In less than a week, the num-
ber of confirmed cases in the United 
States has grown from around 1,000 to 
well over 4,000. The actual number of 
cases is probably higher. 
Here in the Capitol, public tours are 
suspended, and much of our staff is 
working from home. In a further effort 
to limit interactions, Senate Demo-
crats will not be holding our regular 
caucus lunch, which will instead be 
conducted by conference call. 
In my home State of New York alone, 
there are nearly 1,000 confirmed cases. 
The State is doing everything in its 
power to treat those afflicted, to pre-
pare for future cases, and to limit the 
spread of the virus. Residents in the 
tristate area—New York, New Jersey, 
and Connecticut—are now under new 
restrictions on gatherings at bars, res-
taurants, and other public places. 
I urge everyone to stay safe and to 
listen to the advice of public health ex-
perts. Practice good hygiene, follow 
the recommendations issued by State 
and Federal governments about public 
gatherings, 
and 
please—please—stay 
home if you feel sick. 
As these important safeguards go 
into effect, there will be economic con-
sequences. Businesses will face short-
falls. Employees will not be able to 
work. Families will bear the responsi-
bility of childcare as school closures 
mount. For millions of families who 
live paycheck to paycheck, for parents 
who have to choose between keeping 
their jobs or taking care of their kids, 
and for so many others—the small 
business owner who has no liquidity 
even though it was a healthy business 
a few weeks ago—these are all very, 
very difficult times. The Congress and 
the Federal Government as a whole 
must take steps immediately to pro-
vide relief to those American workers, 
families, and businesses. 
Last Friday, the House of Represent-
atives passed legislation to provide for 
free coronavirus testing, extensions of 
paid sick leave, food assistance for 
schoolkids and the elderly, and assist-
ance to States overburdened by Med-
icaid costs and expanded unemploy-
ment insurance. The Senate should 
take up this bill and pass it imme-
diately by consent—today. We cannot 
wait. 
It was my preference to keep the 
Senate in session over the weekend so 
that we could have passed this bill al-
ready, but Leader MCCONNELL—regret-
tably and almost inexplicably—decided 
to send everyone home and then call 
them back today. Many Members on 
my side of the aisle were extremely 
upset by Leader MCCONNELL’s decision. 
There should be no further delay in 
passage of this legislation because, 
surely, we must move on to other nec-
essary 
measures 
to 
address 
the 
coronavirus and its widening impact on 
the medical, economic, and social fab-
ric of this country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1749 
March 16, 2020 
Testing capacity and public health 
infrastructure 
like 
hospital 
beds, 
masks, ventilators, and more remain a 
very urgent priority. Economic assist-
ance for working families and small 
businesses must continue to be a focus 
of our efforts, as well as broader mac-
roeconomic policies. Families will be 
without 
salaries, 
small 
businesses 
without liquidity, and they will need 
help immediately. 
As early as tomorrow, I will present 
a series of proposals to congressional 
appropriators that Senate Democrats 
believe should be part of the next bill 
to address the coronavirus. In con-
sultation with the ranking members of 
the committees of jurisdiction, we are 
proposing an immediate and initial in-
fusion of at least $750 billion to wage 
war against COVID–19 and the eco-
nomic crisis it is now causing. The pro-
posal will get money directly into the 
hands of the American people and, 
among other priorities, include Federal 
funding to address hospital and treat-
ment capacity issues; expand unem-
ployment insurance and increase Med-
icaid funding; ensure that everyone can 
afford treatment for coronavirus; pro-
vide immediate loan payment forbear-
ance for all Federal loans—student 
loans, mortgages, small business loans, 
and others—and moratoriums on evic-
tions and foreclosures; deliver imme-
diate help to small businesses; fund 
emergency childcare, especially for 
healthcare workers and first respond-
ers; help schools with remote learning; 
provide assistance to keep public trans-
portation 
running; 
address 
public 
health and economic needs in Indian 
Country; and utilize the Defense De-
partment to provide personnel, equip-
ment, supplies, and critical response 
capabilities to support the nationwide 
response. 
There will be other proposals that 
will be needed, and we will talk about 
these as well, but, in sum, we need big, 
bold, immediate Federal action to deal 
with the crisis. The kinds of targeted 
measures we are putting together will 
mainline money into the economy and 
directly into the hands of families who 
need it most. 
Importantly, this proposal will en-
sure that our medical professionals 
have the resources—including physical 
space and equipment—they need to 
provide treatment and keep Americans 
safe. Our proposal does not include 
every possible measure, nor must it. 
There will be multiple legislative vehi-
cles to respond to the coronavirus. But 
in the near term, our proposal takes a 
comprehensive approach to dealing 
with the issues that workers, families, 
and the health of America face today. 
I strongly urge my House and Senate 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
review our proposal and incorporate 
our ideas into the next bill we will con-
sider here in Congress. Now, the road 
ahead will be difficult. The disease will 
continue to spread and test our capac-
ity—as a Congress and as a country—to 
respond with the necessary urgency, 
foresight, and cooperation. 
Leaders in public office, from the 
President of the United States on 
down, must communicate clearly and 
honestly and set aside politics on be-
half of the public good. Leaders in Con-
gress must work together and with un-
common speed to respond to a set of 
national challenges unlike any we have 
faced in the recent past. Public health 
officials and researchers and doctors on 
the frontlines must continue to do the 
difficult and noble work they are now 
engaged in. We are all in their debt for 
their courage, their dedication, their 
duty. 
The American people must hunker 
down and follow the guidance of ex-
perts until the cloud of this disease has 
passed. And it will pass. But until skies 
clear, we must all pull in the same di-
rection and do what is necessary to en-
sure the health, safety, and security of 
the American people—today and in the 
weeks and months to come. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, 
right now, across New York State, the 
country, and the world, we are facing a 
crisis not seen in a century. It risks 
the health of our families and the 
health of our fellow Americans as well 
as our economic present and future. We 
are at the edge of a precipice, and lives 
are on the line. It poses a deep chal-
lenge to our collective psyche. How do 
we 
defend 
against 
such 
an 
over-
whelming danger? How do we overcome 
our fear? 
If you are a person who looks to his-
tory, you may turn to great leaders of 
the past. If you are a veteran or serv-
ing in our military today, you might 
look to your training. We are at war 
with this invisible threat. How do we 
create the right strategy, tactics, and 
assault plans? 
If you are a person of faith, you 
might turn to scripture. The book of 
Ephesians tells us how to fight against 
such fears: ‘‘Put on the full armor of 
God, so that when the day of evil 
comes, you may be able to stand your 
ground.’’ It calls us to take up our 
‘‘shield of faith,’’ to wear our ‘‘belt of 
truth,’’ and to stand firmly with our 
feet ‘‘fitted with the readiness that 
comes from the gospel of peace.’’ 
Regardless of where your inspiration 
comes from, in times like these, we are 
afraid, and we need to be brave. We 
need to be selfless, and we need to be 
courageous. We have to look inward to 
find our inner strength, our resilience. 
We have to use our God-given common 
sense, and we need to fight—fight far 
harder than we could ever imagine. 
Our 
enemy 
is 
clear—a 
novel 
coronavirus that is at our doorstep and 
taking lives. Our mission is to stop the 
spread, protect the vulnerable, and ul-
timately 
prevent 
future 
outbreaks. 
Every blocked transmission is a vic-
tory. 
Our frontline defenders are our doc-
tors, our nurses, our first responders. 
Our National Guard is rightfully being 
called in to support these actions. To 
defeat this enemy, though, we need far 
more support. Mothers and fathers, 
sons and daughters, and all caregivers 
are going to be essential in limiting 
the spread of this virus. We need them 
added to the frontlines today—all of 
them. 
The House passed a bill last week 
that takes a first step in beginning to 
address these needs. It provides manda-
tory emergency sick days and up to 3 
months of coronavirus-related paid 
leave for some workers. This puts us 
closer 
to 
helping 
those 
on 
the 
frontlines of this crisis so they no 
longer have to face the impossible 
choice of whether to stay home to care 
for themselves, for a child who is home 
from school, for a loved one who is 
sick, or to risk public health to put 
food on the table for their families. 
Unfortunately, the bill falls short. 
First, over half of the private sector 
workforce was left out of the paid sick 
and family leave provisions. Let me 
say that again. Of the over 100 million 
private sector workers in this country, 
over half will not be helped by this bill. 
Companies with more than 500 workers 
are not required to provide any paid 
sick leave, and the administration can 
give exemptions to companies with 
fewer than 50 employees. Taken to-
gether, this could amount to exemp-
tions for about 75 percent of workers. 
Worse, it fails to take care of many of 
those who are most at risk—low-wage 
workers. These are the workers who 
are the least able to afford to take a 
day off, let alone weeks to self-quar-
antine. 
In order to fight this crisis, we must 
slow the spread of this virus and ulti-
mately stop its transmission. We must 
provide paid sick days and paid family 
and medical leave to every American 
worker now. There can be no excep-
tions or carve-outs, especially not for 
the wealthiest companies in the world. 
For those who say this can’t be done, 
they could not be more wrong. We 
should never send Armed Forces into 
battle without a plan, the right equip-
ment, and the resources they need to 
win. If we don’t equip all of our front-
line defenders, including our parents 
and caregivers, we will fail to limit 
this spread. 
Second, it is clear that, in a matter 
of days, most public school children in 
America will be out of school. The 
stress this puts on working parents is 
truly hard to articulate with or with-
out there being guaranteed paid leave. 
Many low-income children rely on 
school meals for the best meal of the 
day. A school lunch can often make the 
difference between being healthy and 
being malnourished. Therefore, we need

a surge in food stamps, food distribu-
tion, and emergency meal delivery pro-
grams. 
Third, we need a surge of testing. 
Without this critical information, we 
cannot reopen schools or businesses. To 
ensure universal free testing, we must 
authorize testing by all labs and hos-
pitals and remove burdensome restric-
tions. 
From the start of this crisis, public 
health officials have uniformly high-
lighted the importance of there being 
widely available testing and have de-
cried our lack of it. As we have more 
fully grasped the magnitude of this cri-
sis, States have developed their own 
tests, and their labs and hospitals are 
ready to conduct them. However, the 
approval process is still lagging. We 
are testing below our capacity because 
the FDA and CDC have yet to approve 
testing methods. 
This is not the time to let redtape 
stand in our way. The administration 
must authorize States to utilize their 
own testing methods in their own fa-
cilities in order to try to keep up with 
the spread of this virus. Again, fighting 
a war without facts on the ground, 
without critical intelligence, cannot 
prevail. We need this information—yes-
terday. 
Fourth, I support Governor Cuomo’s 
call to deploy the Army Corps of Engi-
neers to build temporary medical fa-
cilities so that when hospitals are over-
whelmed, we can move people into 
those temporary facilities. The Federal 
Government must work aggressively to 
help our States increase hospital ca-
pacity. 
Finally—and I can’t emphasize this 
enough—every future policy that we 
debate here must put families and 
workers first—no half measures. These 
are the people on the frontlines of this 
crisis. They deserve our unwavering 
support. Just like we give the troops 
the resources they need, we have to 
have the same war footing today. 
The very next piece of legislation be-
fore this Chamber must extend full- 
paid sick and family leave to every 
American worker. It must deal with 
the strain caused by the shuttering of 
our public schools, and it must in-
crease our testing capacity and build 
more capacity for urgently needed 
care. We must pass it without further 
delay. Anything less will be a failure of 
government in this time of need. Any-
thing less is defeat before the battle 
has even begun. This is how we fight. 
Every person we protect is a victory. 
This is our shared duty. 
God bless America. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
ERNST). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I sat 
at this very desk 2 months ago during 
the impeachment trial, where I read 
news, oftentimes from East Asian 
sources, about a viral pneumonia from 
an unknown virus emerging from cen-
tral China. From those earliest days, I 
began calling for drastic measures to 
prevent this virus from reaching our 
shores and to prepare for its potential 
arrival. I cannot claim any special ex-
pertise. I am not a doctor. I am not a 
scientist. I am not an epidemiologist. 
But I could tell from the very begin-
ning that the Chinese Communist 
Party was lying about everything re-
lated to this virus, and that we had to 
be prepared for the worst. 
That is why in January I called for a 
travel ban from mainland China. That 
is why in February I began to call for 
crash approvals of laboratory-devel-
oped testing kits or the use of the kind 
of testing kits the World Health Orga-
nization approved or that South Korea 
has been using. That is why I urged a 
Manhattan Project level of investment 
in rapid testing and approval for thera-
peutic products and vaccines. 
That travel ban and some other 
measures taken has bought us some 
time, but our hour of great national 
testing has arrived. The moment of de-
cision is upon us. The time has come 
for extraordinary measures. 
Look at what has happened to Italy 
just over the last 2 weeks. Two weeks 
ago, 
Italians 
were 
enjoying 
early 
spring weather, sipping coffee and wine 
in restaurants and bars—just 2 weeks 
ago. Today, elderly Italians are being 
denied care and instead administered 
last rites because their healthcare sys-
tem is totally overloaded. It is time to 
take extraordinary measures to avoid 
that fate. What seems extreme today 
will seem obvious tomorrow. 
Here are a few of the measures whose 
time has come, regrettably. First, we 
need to stop all nonessential business 
activity in this country. You can call 
it a shutdown. You can call it quar-
antine. You can call it curfew. You can 
call it whatever you want, but no one 
should be going to work in this country 
unless they are involved in essential 
activities—groceries, pharmacies, de-
livering goods to those places, elec-
tricity, water, sanitation, public safe-
ty. Anything else poses too great a risk 
to public health. 
Second, it is time for nonessential 
government services to shut down, as 
well, at the Federal, State, and local 
levels. Anyone who is involved in try-
ing to arrest the spread of this virus or 
to mitigate its economic impact or 
provide other essential services, like 
food aid to the needy or care for other 
kinds of patients in a VA hospital, 
must come to work, and we must be 
prepared to work extremely long hours. 
But anyone else in government at any 
level should be telecommuting, if they 
can, and staying home, in any case. 
Third, it is time for our military to 
prepare to provide advanced support of 
civilian authorities. This is a mission 
the military long plans for. They are 
rarely called upon to do so, but an ur-
gent hour is approaching, especially at 
our hospitals and our nursing homes 
and other healthcare facilities, when 
our young men and women in uniform 
could be called upon to support our 
great doctors and our nurses to provide 
additional capacity to treat patients, 
not just with this coronavirus but with 
other urgent needs as well. That plan-
ning is in its infancy. It needs to accel-
erate immediately. 
Again, I know these are extraor-
dinary measures, and they will impose 
hardship and pain and dislocation, but 
the faster we arrest the spread of this 
virus, the faster things can get back to 
normal and our economy will heal. We 
will protect ourselves, and we will pro-
tect our well-being. 
In the meantime, this Congress will 
be called upon for some pretty drastic 
measures, as well, to ensure that all 
those persons affected by steps taken 
on this day and the steps I am calling 
for can make ends meet, can put food 
on the table, and keep a roof over their 
head and pay their bills. 
The House, over the weekend, passed 
a bill that has many important provi-
sions that I support and I suspect will 
pass unanimously from this Chamber: 
free virus testing; provisions for school 
lunches for those whose schools have 
closed, like the children all across Ar-
kansas; liability protection for the 
manufacturers of respirator masks, 
which need it so we can get millions of 
more masks out to doctors and nurses. 
But the House bill doesn’t go far 
enough, and it doesn’t go fast enough. 
The centerpiece of the House bill pro-
viding aid to affected workers is a new 
kind of tax credit for paid sick leave. 
Unfortunately, that is wrongheaded on 
both counts. First, a tax credit—even a 
refundable one, even one on which you 
can get an advance from the IRS—will 
not do much good if a business has no 
revenue whatsoever. Imagine all those 
restaurants, all those bars, all those 
gyms that are going to come to a 
screeching halt today or tomorrow. 
They will have no cash to pay their dis-
located workers. They will not be send-
ing anything to the Treasury every 3 
days in the form of payroll taxes, from 
which they can get an advance. They 
will have nothing. They will go bank-
rupt if we force them to advance sick 
leave with no revenue whatsoever. 
But, also, it doesn’t go far enough on 
the sick leave front. That is a mis-
guided category error. Yes, we should 
take care of those who are sick with 
this virus. But there are so many oth-
ers, as well—those who are quarantined 
but are not sick, as some of those in 
the Senate have done; those whose 
businesses are shuttered but are per-
fectly healthy, if they work in a bar or 
restaurant or theater or gym; those 
who have children whose schools have 
closed and have no means to provide 
for childcare so they can get to work. 
They all have bills to pay as well. They 
all have mouths to feed. So the House 
approach simply doesn’t go far enough 
or fast enough to create a complicated

March 16, 2020 
new system that doesn’t cover enough 
of America’s workers and families. 
So I would suggest a better approach. 
We simply need to use existing systems 
to get cash in the hands of workers and 
their families as quickly as possible. 
One approach is instant tax refunds or 
rebates—call them what you will—to 
anyone who filed taxes last year, espe-
cially those in the lower tax brackets, 
who are most likely to struggle to 
make ends meet if they are not bring-
ing home a paycheck. That can be done 
almost instantly. 
A second approach is to use existing 
social welfare agency programs to get 
cash out the door and into the hands of 
displaced workers and their families. 
Take unemployment insurance, for in-
stance. The whole point of unemploy-
ment insurance is to get checks quick-
ly in the hands of those who need it. 
I consulted this weekend with our 
State officials. I consulted today with 
Federal officials. We don’t have to re-
design the unemployment system. We 
don’t have to set new parameters and 
criteria in 50 different information 
technology systems in our States. All 
we simply do is treat someone who is 
sick with this virus or quarantined be-
cause of potential exposure or who is 
furloughed from a job or who is caring 
for a child as if they were unemployed. 
The cash stipend may not be their 
full wage, but it will be enough, and it 
will be in their hands immediately so 
they can feed their kids and so they 
can pay their bills. That can be done 
right now—immediately. We don’t have 
to use employers and tax credits as a 
middleman or a conduit. 
Third, we have to think about all 
those businesses that are essentially 
going into a self-protective shutdown— 
all those restaurants and bars and 
gyms and theaters and I suspect many 
more in the days ahead. They are not 
making payroll. They are probably cut-
ting supplies. They still have other 
debts to pay, though. We should help 
them get through this short period of 
testing, whether with loans or loan 
guarantees or grants—what have you. 
We have to remember, though, that 
when small businesses and medium- 
sized businesses run out of cash, they 
go into chapter 7 bankruptcy. They liq-
uidate. Those jobs don’t come back. 
When giant businesses have a cash 
crunch, they go into chapter 11. Sure, 
the owners may change, but they come 
back into business. 
Those are just a few of the steps we 
have to take to mitigate the economic 
harm this virus is inflicting on our peo-
ple and to ensure that no one, not a 
single person in this country, has any 
financial incentive to go to work when 
they are sick or when they even may 
be feeling sick or to go out to try to 
find another job because their work-
place is shut down and they can’t get 
any support from the government. 
Again, I know these are extraor-
dinary measures, but these are also ex-
traordinary times, and the faster we 
act, the more aggressively we act, the 
shorter these times will last. We will 
stop the spread of this virus; we will 
get our people back to work; our mar-
kets will come back; and we will be 
stronger on the back end of this crisis 
than we were coming into it. 
Nothing I have said here is a Repub-
lican idea or Democratic idea. I don’t 
have partisan objections to what the 
House has proposed. I simply want to 
make sure that the action we take will 
work and will get relief to all of those 
displaced workers and their families in 
a timely fashion, when they need it, to 
put food on the table and keep a roof 
over their kids’ heads and pay for med-
icine and make car payments. That is 
why the Senate is here today. That 
should be our focus in the days ahead, 
and that is something we can accom-
plish together this week. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, fami-
lies across the country are facing an 
unprecedented challenge, and we must 
act, and act now, on solutions that put 
families and the American people first. 
The Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act takes a substantial step to-
ward providing the relief and assurance 
communities need as we face this pub-
lic health crisis. 
Families should not be forced to 
choose between a paycheck and their 
own health and safety, or the health 
and safety of their community. A res-
taurant worker in Vermont cannot af-
ford to stay home from work for sev-
eral days or several weeks and still af-
ford to pay her rent or feed her family, 
but staying home is exactly what we 
are asking waitresses, store clerks, gas 
station attendants, hourly workers, 
and many other employees to do. To 
contain this virus, we must address 
this reality. 
Today, I am strongly urging Repub-
licans and Democrats to drop their la-
bels and support this emergency relief 
package, and pass it now. The Amer-
ican people need leadership, not polit-
ical 
battles. 
The 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act creates two 
weeks of emergency paid sick leave so 
that people who work for small busi-
nesses are able to stay home from work 
if they are sick or must quarantine due 
to coronavirus. It creates up to 12 
weeks of job protection under the Fam-
ily and Medical Leave Act, and allows 
an employee to stay home for a longer 
period of time to recover from illness, 
or take care of a sick family member, 
or care for a child who must be at 
home because of school and daycare 
closures. These are commonsense solu-
tions. Not only is it the right thing to 
do, it is a critical step if we want to 
contain and defeat this public health 
crisis. It means employees won’t have 
to choose between going to work when 
they are sick and potentially spreading 
the virus and missing a paycheck. This 
bill also makes important changes to 
the unemployment insurance program 
to help those that lose their job during 
this crisis. I hope, as Congress con-
siders further steps to help address this 
crisis, we further support the small 
businesses that are supporting these 
employees and are the backbone of our 
local economies. 
The Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act would inject $500 million 
into the Special Supplemental Nutri-
tion Program for Women, Infants and 
Children (WIC) and contains legislative 
changes to free up funding to help chil-
dren who would go without breakfast 
or lunch if their schools closed. It 
would provide $400 million for the 
Emergency Food Assistance Program 
to ensure that food banks have the re-
sources they need to serve their com-
munities and provide $250 million for 
senior nutrition programs. These are 
common sense proposals to help fami-
lies where they are in their commu-
nities. 
Importantly, this bill will provide $1 
billion to help cover the cost of testing 
for people who are uninsured. This 
virus does not discriminate between 
the rich or the poor, or between those 
who have insurance and those who do 
not. Our approach to address this crisis 
cannot discriminate either. Nothing 
can help our country make up the 
ground we have lost because of the 
failed policies and poor execution of 
this administration of testing for the 
coronavirus. Because of the delays in 
getting the tests to State and local 
governments where they are needed, we 
do not fully understand the scope or 
spread of this disease in our country. 
We cannot compound these mistakes 
by denying the coronavirus test to 
those who can least afford it. Cost can-
not be a barrier to seeking medical 
treatment during a public health crisis. 
This bill is not perfect. As currently 
drafted, the paid sick leave benefits 
and Family Medical Leave Act polices 
extend only to companies with 500 em-
ployees or fewer. That leaves many 
workers in this country without these 
important protections. I understand 
this was the price of securing White 
House support for this bill. I would like 
the White House to explain why it 
thinks 
hourly 
workers 
at 
Target, 
Walmart, or McDonald’s are less de-
serving of these protections. If we had 
the luxury of time, I would join other 
Senate 
Democrats 
in 
offering 
an 
amendment to close this gap, but we do 
not have that luxury. This bill was a 
product of compromise, and any change 
risks a threat of delay at a time when 
delay is our greatest enemy. 
To my friends across the aisle who 
also want changes in this bill, I urge 
you to stand down. We need to pass 
this bill today, without delay. We do 
not have time for a lengthy debate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1752 
March 16, 2020 
The American people are looking to us 
for leadership and swift action; let’s 
provide it. 
This bill is the first step toward 
meeting American families where they 
are as they confront this crisis. In my 
more than 40 years in the United 
States Senate, few moments have de-
manded our bipartisan leadership more 
than this crisis. We must provide the 
protections 
in 
this 
bill—paid 
sick 
leave, unemployment insurance, nutri-
tion assistance, and affordable testing 
for the American people—and we must 
do it now. 
I this time of uncertainty, concern, 
and fear, I want to remind my fellow 
Vermonters and all Americans: We are 
all in this together. We can be smart 
about how we conduct our lives, while 
being good neighbors. We can support 
our communities, our first responders, 
healthcare workers, store clerks, and 
shelf stockers, and all those providing 
essential services. I am confident that 
our country will emerge from this cri-
sis stronger than we were before, as we 
always have. I strongly encourage Re-
publicans and Democrats to support 
this bill. 
I see nobody else seeking recognition. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOZMAN). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 6172 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I entered 
the Senate in the wake of Watergate in 
1975. The very first vote I cast was in 
favor of creating the Select Committee 
to Study Government Operations with 
Respect to Intelligence Activities and 
the Rights of Americans—that is, the 
Church Committee. Through that Com-
mittee’s work, the American public 
soon learned of years of abuses that 
had occurred at the hands of the execu-
tive branch’s intelligence agencies. In 
response, the Senate passed sweeping 
reforms to rein in this overreach. 
Since then, more flaws and occa-
sional abuses have been documented 
within our surveillance authorities, 
but the Senate rarely has had an op-
portunity to debate and improve them. 
We did so in 2015, when Senator LEE 
and I led the effort in the Senate to 
pass the USA FREEDOM Act. Senator 
LEE and I strongly believe the Senate 
should do the same now. We should 
strengthen the amicus program, ensure 
that all exculpatory information is 
provided to the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court, and make other 
basic changes to better protect the 
civil liberties of all Americans. 
I am thankful that Majority Leader 
MCCONNELL today has agreed to what 
Senator LEE
and I requested last 
week—that we pass a short extension 
of the expiring FISA authorities to 
give us an opportunity to both review 
and improve the House bill with a lim-
ited number of amendments. Critically, 
this will give us time to take up this 
issue after the Senate responds to the 
coronavirus. 
I am particularly thankful to Sen-
ator LEE, who has tirelessly worked to 
reform surveillance authorities since 
he came to the Senate. With today’s 
agreement, we will have the next 2 
months to build consensus around im-
portant reforms, and I hope all of you 
will join us in this effort. That is what 
the Senate did when confronted with 
abuses documented by the Church 
Committee, and that is what the Sen-
ate must do now. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent to receive permission to 
complete my remarks before any vote 
is conducted. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I came to 
the floor several days ago in connec-
tion with the expiring national secu-
rity provisions. We have three provi-
sions of our national security system 
of laws that are set to expire and have 
been set to expire for a long time. In 
fact, they expired yesterday, the 15th 
of March. 
We have known that this was going 
to happen for a long time. When the 
USA FREEDOM Act was passed in 
2015—a bill that I authored, along with 
my distinguished friend and colleague 
Senator 
LEAHY
from 
Vermont—we 
knew those three provisions known as 
lone wolf, 215, and roving wire taps 
would expire at the end of 2019. 
We got to the end of 2019, and we 
found ourselves up against a spending 
cliff, and the Senate decided, with the 
concurrence of the House of Represent-
atives and the President, that we 
should postpone until March 15 the ex-
piration of those three provisions that 
I just mentioned. 
I came to the floor on Thursday to 
raise concerns that we needed to be 
able to amend and reform these provi-
sions of the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act, or FISA, for a number of 
reasons. Among other reasons, I noted 
that the President of the United States 
found that his own rights as an Amer-
ican citizen were abused, as this law 
was manipulated, was abused in an un-
holy alliance of partisan political in-
terests against him. 
For that reason, the President of the 
United States has, quite thankfully, 
made this point clear to the American 
people. Even though the abuses that we 
know of that occurred with respect to 
the President of the United States were 
not themselves one of these expiring 
provisions, we note the law itself as a 
whole is subject to abuse and that at 
moments like these, when these provi-
sions are expiring, it is appropriate for 
us to take a broader look at the overall 
legal framework in which FISA oper-
ates and to bring about reforms. 
I came to the floor on Thursday, and 
I asked that we simply reauthorize 
these three expiring provisions for a 
period of a few weeks—that we reau-
thorize them cleanly and without any 
modification to give us a few weeks to 
deal with the immediate crisis sur-
rounding the coronavirus. I asked that, 
at the end of that period, we proceed 
with the understanding that the Sen-
ate be allowed to vote on a small hand-
ful of amendments—proposed reforms— 
to FISA. 
This, unfortunately, drew an objec-
tion, resulting in the expiration of 
these three provisions over the week-
end. This was unnecessary. As I point-
ed out at the time, I and my bipartisan 
group of colleagues, who have been 
concerned about these and other for-
eign intelligence surveillance provi-
sions, didn’t necessarily want it to ex-
pire. In fact, we believed that this was 
an unnecessary step. It was unneces-
sary to allow the law to go through the 
uncertainty of an expiration without 
having something to put in its place. 
We could have and would have and 
should have done it differently. Fortu-
nately, we were able to reach a deal— 
a deal that is still unfolding but a deal 
that is about to be announced on the 
Senate floor, whereby we will be ex-
tending for a few weeks these three ex-
piring provisions, and, at the end of 
that time, we will be able to vote on a 
small handful of provisions, amend-
ments to the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act framework. 
This is necessary. We ought not wait 
until the President of the United 
States himself becomes a victim of 
this. When he has been a victim, we 
should assume that there are other vic-
tims—people whose rights have been 
invaded, violated as the law has been 
abused. We know that to be the case. 
For that reason, we have negotiated 
this agreement, whereby we will be 
able to receive votes on amendments to 
improve and reform the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act. 
I want to thank President Trump for 
bringing this issue to the attention of 
the American people and for reminding 
them of the importance of reforming 
this law. I want to thank the lead co-
sponsor of the legislation that I have 
filed in connection with this and of the 
amendments that we will be consid-
ering. 
PAT LEAHY from Vermont and I have 
worked on FISA-related issues for basi-
cally the entirety of the 9 years I have 
spent in the U.S. Senate. I am grateful 
to him for working with me on this. 
I also want to point out that it 
shouldn’t have to come to this. We

shouldn’t have to wait until the mo-
ment when we are on the eve of the ex-
piration of some important legislation 
and where we have to wait for the 
President of the United States to weigh 
in and lean in and exercise as much 
leadership as he has to tell us that we 
ought to reconsider laws that we our-
selves have enacted. From time to 
time, laws require revision, review, and 
reform. That always, necessarily, re-
quires amendments, and we ought to be 
ready, able, and willing to vote on 
amendments as necessary. 
Finally, this has become all too 
symptomatic of a Senate in which 
amendment 
votes, 
while 
once 
the 
norm, have now become the exception. 
This is unacceptable. It is not a par-
tisan issue. It is neither Republican 
nor Democratic. It is neither liberal 
nor conservative. It is simply an Amer-
ican issue. The American people, in-
cluding each of our constituents from 
each of the 50 States that we represent, 
deserve and expect for us to be more 
than a rubberstamp. 
We can’t justify our pattern of wait-
ing for legislation to come over from 
the House of Representatives and then 
accepting the highly flawed propo-
sition that the House must have gotten 
it right and we, therefore, must accept 
as a binary choice the entirety of what 
they have done, without considering or 
voting on amendments. This isn’t ac-
ceptable. We can do better. I am en-
couraged that in this instance we have 
chosen to do better. I hope and expect 
and will continue to demand that we 
vote on more amendments and that 
this become the norm once again rath-
er than the exception. 
Finally, I am grateful that Senate 
leadership—Republican 
and 
Demo-
cratic alike—has chosen to allow us to 
consider amendments here. We are 
doing the right thing, and I look for-
ward to more of precisely this kind of 
activity, not just voting on amend-
ments pivotal to FISA but also broader 
issues. This isn’t just about FISA. This 
is about everything we do. The minute 
any of us ever hears an argument sug-
gesting that we have to accept what-
ever a handful of Senators or a com-
mittee or the other House of Congress 
has proposed and we ought to accept it 
or deny it—lock, stock, and barrel— 
without amendments, that is almost 
always an injurious and a dangerous 
argument, one that runs contrary to 
the very purpose for which this body 
exists. 
I am grateful for this opportunity we 
will have to vote on these amendments. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

hour each. I further ask that the only 
amendments in order be three amend-
ments to be proposed by the following 
Senators or their designees: LEE, on 
amicus reforms and exculpatory evi-
dence; PAUL, on rights of Americans; 
DAINES, on section 215 web browser/

tion; and three side-by-sides to be pro-
posed by Senator MCCONNELL, or his 
designee, on the same topics, with all 
amendments and the bill subject to a 
60-affirmative vote threshold for pas-
sage; finally, that upon the use or

amended, be read a third time and the

CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are 
at an extraordinary moment in our Na-
tion’s history. The President of the 
United States has declared a national 
emergency. One has to go back to the 
early 1900s to the Spanish influenza to 
find a similar public health threat to 
the United States of America. We are 
in the midst of not just a threat in our 
own country but a global coronavirus 
pandemic. There are more than 173,000 
cases nationwide, and more than 7,300 
people have died. 
What you see today on the floor of 
the Senate is exactly the opposite of 
what we are being advised as a nation 
we need to do. What you see today on 
the floor of the Senate are staff peo-
ple—thank you for being here—protec-
tive forces outside the Chamber, and 
others who are invisible to those com-
ing and going who are part of the ordi-
nary business of the Senate. You see, 
we did today what the President has 
told America we should not do, what 
medical experts have told us we should 
not do. We have taken unnecessary air-
line flights to come here to Wash-
ington, DC. I was on a plane this morn-
ing from Springfield, IL, to Chicago. 
There were six passengers on the plane. 
Most people are listening to the advice 
of the medical experts and avoiding un-
necessary travel. 
Unfortunately, we were required to 
come back today from across the 
United States. Some Members stayed 
over the weekend because their homes 
are too far away. Some decided to drive 
this morning just to be extremely safe. 
But the fact is, we were asked to take 
unnecessary airline flights to come

S1754 
March 16, 2020 
back here today and this week and, 
frankly, expose ourselves to the possi-
bility of some public health risk and 
ask our staff to do the same. 
In addition to that, we have been 
counseled by the leaders—both at the 
State and the Federal levels—not to 
gather in groups of more than 10. It 
looks like we are breaking that rule 
right here on the floor of the Senate. 
The obvious question is why: Why 
would we put ourselves at risk? Why 
would we put our staff at risk and their 
families to come back here? 
There are two issues. The first issue 
is the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act, which was brought up on the 
floor of the Senate last Thursday, and 
Senator LEE and Senator LEAHY offered 
the extension of this act for a period of 
time in return for a few amendments to 
be debated on the floor. That was re-
jected. 
Just minutes ago, what was rejected 
last Thursday was accepted. We made 
this trip back here, and it was not nec-
essary. You have to ask yourselves: 
Are we being respectful of ourselves, 
our family, our staff? Are we being re-
spectful of our responsibility as setting 
a model for the rest of America? I am 
afraid not. 
Now there is this bill remaining that 
just passed the House of Representa-
tives, the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act. The coronavirus act was 
one that was negotiated by speaker 
NANCY PELOSI and the President of the 
United States through Mr. Mnuchin. 
That went on for a week, and the bill 
was agreed to and supported by both. 
The President even tweeted his support 
for it. That shows his level of commit-
ment, I suppose. Speaker PELOSI sup-
ported it as well. It was a measure that 
should have passed by a voice vote here 
in the Senate over the weekend. In-
stead, we are still talking about it 
today. 
There are measures included in it 
that are critical for public health. May 
I gave you one example? When the 
State of Illinois and the city of Chicago 
asked 
for 
protective 
masks 
for 
healthcare workers so that they can 
avoid infection, they sent us an allot-
ment of 25,000 masks. A State of 12.5 
million people was sent 25,000 masks. 
Those would protect the people work-
ing at one major hospital in Chicago 
for a month. It is totally inadequate. 
The last time we faced any kind of 
epidemic threat like this, we received 
1.5 million masks from the stockpile. 
What is holding up the masks? What is 
holding up the test kits? Those are le-
gitimate questions. 
One of the provisions in this bill that 
is still sitting here somewhere in Sen-
ate limbo would authorize new masks 
to be released across the United States 
to my State and others. So while we 
talk, the masks are not being deliv-
ered. 
Why, then, aren’t we taking up this 
bill 
tonight? 
The 
coronavirus 
bill 
should be taken up at this moment by 
unanimous consent. Let those who ob-
ject to it come to the floor if they wish 
and object and explain why. If they 
have an amendment to offer, so be it. 
But if it is just to let the ordinary 
course 
of 
things 
work 
their 
way 
through and maybe we will get around 
to this by Wednesday or Thursday, 
shame on us. This is a matter of na-
tional emergency and a public health 
crisis in this country. 
What kind of example are we setting 
by coming back to this Chamber at 
risk to our staff and the people and 
ourselves and our families? We have 
Members of the Senate going in and 
out of quarantine. They are self-quar-
antining themselves, and we are acting 
like it is business as usual. We will get 
around to it later this week. 
What are we waiting for? This is a 
healthcare emergency. It is time for 
both political parties to come to the 
floor—not this empty Chamber—and do 
our job tonight. There is no excuse for 
it. If someone has a substantive objec-
tion to the bill, state it on the floor. 
You have plenty of chance to do it. 
Offer an amendment, if you wish, or 
just vote no, but for goodness’ sake, 
the American people expect us to do 
our work. 
We are here at risk to ourselves and 
others. We should do our work, and do 
it quickly. If this is going to end up in 
some voice vote that is quietly reg-
istered tomorrow, a number of us are 
going to be very upset because we made 
this trip here because we had to rep-
resent our people who elected us and 
sent us here thinking we would have to 
vote. 
If we can do this without a vote, so 
be it. But couldn’t this have been done 
without exposing all of the staff people 
and all of the protective forces and ev-
eryone else to the obvious pandemic 
that we think is threatening our coun-
try in a massive way? 
I take this very seriously because I 
love my family and friends. I wouldn’t 
want any of them to be hurt because of 
something I have picked up—some 
virus I have picked up. I have increased 
my exposure today to be here on this 
floor, and, tonight, we are going to 
quietly sneak away and maybe come 
back tomorrow and actually do some 
work. We should do it tonight. 
This coronavirus emergency should 
be taken seriously by both parties and 
taken seriously by the U.S. Senate. It 
is time for us to act. That is what we 
were sent here to do. Let’s do it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho is recognized. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Illinois yield to an in-
quiry? 
Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I am told 
that Speaker PELOSI has not sent a bill 
to the Senate yet. Is that your under-
standing? 
Mr. DURBIN. I understand the bill 
has been sent. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I have a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Has the bill bent sent by Speaker 
PELOSI to the Senate yet? 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
Chair is unaware that the bill has ar-
rived. 
Mr. RISCH. It is probably tough for 
us to vote on a bill that hasn’t arrived 
yet. 
Mr. DURBIN. Let me defer to the 
Senator from Idaho. 
I have just had this explained by my 
staff. There is an enrollment correction 
that was supposed to be taken up on 
the floor of the House today and sent 
over with the bill. 
Mr. RISCH. I don’t disagree with you 
that we should take it up. 
Mr. DURBIN. I understand a Repub-
lican Member of the House is objecting 
to the enrollment correction at this 
point, and it is being held up there be-
cause of his objection. 
Mr. RISCH. Thank you, Mr. Presi-
dent. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. 
BROWN. 
I 
think 
you 
just 
watched what is wrong with this place. 
Senator DURBIN comes here and talks 
about the importance of doing some-
thing. Last Thursday, when Speaker 
PELOSI
and Secretary Mnuchin were 
close to coming up with a deal about 
what we have to do to stop this virus— 
keep in mind, the President of the 
United States first mentioned this in 
an answer to a question with all the 
elites in Davos, Switzerland. He first 
answered a question saying: Oh, this 
virus is nothing. It will mean nothing. 
I think it took him 8 weeks before he 
declared an emergency. Then, last 
Thursday, we were supposed to start 
working on this. We should have. I 
asked Senator MCCONNELL
on this 
floor—I opened this door, and I pointed 
down the hall. I said: Senator MCCON-
NELL should come back here, and let’s 
work on this bill. 
Whether they were actually finished 
doing it in the House down the hall or 
not, we should be working on this. 
Now we have had 4 more days. Sen-
ator MCCONNELL had to go back to 
Kentucky. I don’t know what he went 
back for. We asked him to stay and fin-
ish this, to negotiate and do it to take 
care of stopping this virus, to take care 
of all the people in my State in Illinois 
and Senator MARKEY’s State and Sen-
ator COONS’ State and Senator BOOZ-
MAN’s State, to take care of all these 
people who are losing their jobs and 
don’t know what to do. 
Senator MCCONNELL
went back to 
Kentucky and wasted 3 days—make 
that 4 days since today is another day 
we are wasting. Again, I don’t know 
why he went back. It is 3 more days of 
people being worried. It is 3 more days 
of people self-quarantining. It is 3 more 
days of businesses in Columbus and 
Dayton shutting down. It is the an-
guish you feel if you think one of your 
loved ones is sick. All of this—empty 
airplanes and all the things that are 
happening—and we are wasting another 
day. 
I always appreciate the Senator from 
Idaho bringing up a parliamentary

technical question, but why aren’t we 
doing this? Why aren’t we listening to 
what Senator DURBIN said? 
It has been 3 days since the House 
passed the comprehensive package. It 
is 3 days and counting for people wor-
ried about how they are going to take 
time off from work if they get sick. 
Think about this. The Presiding Offi-
cer knows all kinds of service workers 
in Arkansas; Senator DURBIN
knows 
them in Illinois; Senator MARKEY, in 
Massachusetts. I know all kinds of 
workers who are feeling sick. They are 
making $12 an hour. They don’t have 
any sick days. They think: Do I go to 
work and maybe I will get sick and 
maybe infect my neighbor? Or do I stay 
home and give up that $12 an hour— 
that $100 I need to make my rent—and 
then, tomorrow, face the same question 
and the day after? That is what we are 
forcing on people. Instead, we are just 
playing games. We wasted 3 days, and 
now we are wasting another day. 
When a situation changes this quick-
ly, people are scared at home. People 
are looking for leadership. Leader 
MCCONNELL and President Trump have 
failed the people they serve. We need to 
get help to people today. Let’s imme-
diately get to work on the next round 
of support. 
Let me tell you what that next round 
of support is. We should pass the bill 
today to help people with unemploy-
ment insurance, to help people with 
sick days, to help people with Med-
icaid. We should do all that. It means 
putting our workers first. We shouldn’t 
be bailing out Wall Street. That will be 
next. You can bet Senator MCCONNELL 
will hurry when the airlines come for 
their bailout package and hurry when 
the banks come for their bailout pack-
age and hurry when the big hotel 
chains come for their bailout package. 
We have to put money in the pockets 
of individuals first. The IRS needs to 
send an initial check of at least $2,000 
directly to every single working-class, 
low-income, and middle-class family 
who can use it so they won’t get evict-
ed or won’t get foreclosed on. We don’t 
need a corporate middleman to do that. 
We need to make sure every worker 
who needs unemployment insurance 
can get it. 
I have spoken to my Governor, who 
has done a good job on this. He served 
here with Senator DURBIN. He is Mike 
DeWine, a Republican. I talked to him 
three times this week. He will help us 
speed up the unemployment checks so 
that they get to workers. We need to 
make sure that all workers are eligible 
for unemployment insurance, including 
independent contractors and people 
who are self-employed. 
Second, we need a temporary expan-
sion of the earned income tax credit 
and the child tax credit for the next 
several years. 
Third, we need to hold any company 
accountable that is getting taxpayer 
dollars. If we are going to help the air-
lines—and I think we should—it means 
the airlines can do no stock buybacks. 
It means no sending of jobs overseas. It 
means no outsourcing of jobs to inde-
pendent and usually low-paid contract 
workers—food service, custodial, secu-
rity workers. It means no golden para-
chutes for executives. It means no 
using of taxpayer dollars, with which 
we are bailing them out, to bust unions 
that are trying to organize in the 
workplaces. If they want taxpayer 
money, you commit to using it to help 
people who make this country work. 
Fourth, we need to prevent evictions 
and foreclosures and provide emer-
gency rental and mortgage assistance 
to make up for lost wages. Millions of 
Americans are one lost paycheck away 
from eviction or foreclosure. You all 
know the number. Forty percent of 
Americans don’t have $400 extra to fix 
their cars. Also, if they lose their pay-
checks, they can’t pay their rent. We 
need to look at canceling some amount 
of student loan debt. Through no fault 
of their own, we know millions of 
Americans aren’t going to be able to 
make student loan payments. Can-
celing debt will allow people to get 
back on their feet. 
Since January 22, President Trump 
has had chance, after chance, after 
chance to get ahead of this public 
health crisis. In fact, 2 years ago, I sent 
him a letter, writing: Why did you fire 
Admiral Ziemer? Why did you elimi-
nate the office of 40 people in the White 
House that was in charge of surveilling 
the 
world 
to 
look 
for 
potential 
pandemics? Why did you fire them? 
Please reinstate them. 
He ignored the letter. He hasn’t ex-
plained why he eliminated that office. 
He would have known way before Janu-
ary about this potential pandemic, and 
if it had still existed, he might have 
done something about it at the urging 
of that office. The President has failed 
in this. Congress can’t make the same 
mistakes. We need to get ahead of the 
crisis facing family budgets before it is 
too late. 
Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question? 
Mr. BROWN. I yield to the Senator 
from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Through the Chair, I 
ask a question of the Senator from 
Ohio. 
The Senator from Idaho, who is a 
friend, raised a parliamentary issue, 
and you have gotten to the heart of the 
matter with the question of how fami-
lies are going to survive in the midst of 
the pandemic and what we are going to 
do about it. The Senator from Idaho 
raised a parliamentary issue, and we 
are guided by rules around here. 
To the knowledge of the Senator 
from Ohio, in the past, has the Senate 
entered into agreement on bills posted 
in the House before the papers actually 
arrived in the Senate? 
Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator 
from Illinois. 
Yes. Sure, we have. If we want to get 
something done, we get something 
done. We find a way, through unani-
mous consent, for all of us to agree. 
Who can say that this is anything 
but a national crisis? Are we going to 
make our unwillingness to do anything 
contingent 
on 
some 
parliamentary 
trick? No. We are paid to do this job. 
Just because Senator MCCONNELL has 
taken 4 days and not done it doesn’t 
mean that we shouldn’t. We should 
work. 
Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator. 
Mr. BROWN. I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. President, I echo 
what the Senator from Illinois has said 
and what the Senator from Ohio has 
said. 
We have a national emergency. We 
should have already finished this phase 
of dealing with this crisis, for there are 
many more phases to deal with. As 
part of this debate, we should ensure 
that there is sick leave for every single 
worker in our country. That is not in 
this package that is coming through 
right now. We have to make sure ev-
eryone is covered. We need unemploy-
ment insurance, and we need to ensure 
that it extends to workers in the gig 
economy—tip workers, domestic work-
ers, and contractors. We have to cover 
people so they stay home. We have to 
let them know that unemployment in-
surance is going to extend to them dur-
ing this crisis. 
We cannot allow our inaction—our 
thinking through of what we have to 
do—to shut down any potential for this 
crisis’ not growing to a level which we 
are seeing in other countries. We can 
do it, but it is the Senate that has to 
be here. It is the Senate that has to de-
liberate on these issues, find the solu-
tions, and deliver them to the Amer-
ican people. They are desperate for an-
swers right now. They are being told to 
go home right now. Waiters, bar-
tenders, and contractors are being told 
to just go home. 
What is going to happen to them if 
they don’t have sick time? What is 
going to happen to them if they don’t 
have unemployment insurance? What 
are they going to be doing in terms of 
caring for their families? 
We should be here this week, taking 
care of the package that has already 
been agreed to and beginning the de-
bate immediately on everything else 
we have to do. I will give you an exam-
ple. 
Let’s just take the hospitals of our 
country. For most of the major cities 
in America, a high percentage of the 
revenue for those hospitals comes from 
foreign patients who fly in from around 
the world and into our major cities. 
That revenue stream is going to be cut 
off for an indefinite period of time. 
Hospitals depend upon elective sur-
geries. That is going to be cut off for 
an indefinite period of time. That is 
the revenue flow that goes into hos-
pitals that then allows them to take 
care of the poorer people in each and 
every one of our communities. If they 
don’t have that revenue stream, it is 
going to place enormous pressure on

them to lay off doctors, to lay off 
nurses, and to lay off other key per-
sonnel because the revenue stream will 
not be there. 
We are the ones who are going to 
have to provide the revenue stream. At 
this time, we cannot have a hospital 
system in crisis in our country. We 
should be here, deciding whether we 
are going to provide a fund of $100 bil-
lion or $200 billion or $300 billion to en-
sure our healthcare system stays ro-
bust at this time of all times in our 
history. 
We are heading into issue after issue 
that this Senate has to deal with. If we 
are here—if we are back—we should 
deal with it. We should deal with it 
this week. We should deal with it on 
the emergency basis that we are telling 
every family to with regard to this cri-
sis, but every other family is dependent 
upon us to provide the answers for 
them and their families. 
So I agree with the Senators. This is 
something that requires our attention. 
We are here, and we are the answers for 
them. If we don’t give them, then there 
will be no answers. We know that the 
first bill—the $8 billion bill—was three 
times larger than the White House 
wanted, but we made sure that the 
extra funding was going into each and 
every one of our States. We know that 
this bill that was just negotiated with 
the Speaker and the President last 
week is just being held up by a Repub-
lican with regard to a procedural ob-
stacle. That is why. 
We have to deal with this on a war 
footing. We are at war with an invisible 
enemy that is moving into every single 
city and town and into every single 
part of our economy as we speak right 
now. If we don’t provide the defense for 
our families, then we are going to be 
looked at as being those who failed the 
American people. 
We should already have robust test-
ing, but we don’t. We should have the 
protective gear in the hands of every 
doctor and nurse all across our coun-
try, but our doctors and nurses are 
being told to reuse their masks—to 
reuse them. The Senator from Illinois 
was already talking about how hard it 
is to get that extra protective gear for 
his hospitals, and the same thing is 
true all across our country. 
We know there is a crisis. We know 
there is a shortage. We know there is a 
huge gap that exists between what we 
have and what we are going to need, 
but we don’t have any more time. We 
didn’t use the time in December. We 
didn’t use it in January, and we didn’t 
use it for most of February. There were 
warnings that were coming, but we now 
know it is real. We know it is in every 
community already and in every State 
already in our Nation. 
We should stay here, and we should 
do this work. We should make sure 
that our hospitals know for sure that 
they are going to have the help they 
need, especially the community hos-
pitals because they are going to be 
very 
fragile—very, 
very 
fragile—in 
terms of the revenue stream going in 
while great expectations will be ex-
pected from them in terms of what 
they are going to do for their local 
communities. 
So let’s stay. Let’s debate this. Let’s 
make sure that the frontline workers 
have the protective gear they need, 
have the testing equipment they need, 
and have the guarantee that their sala-
ries are going to be paid and that they 
are going to be taken care of, because 
we are going to need them to be put-
ting themselves in harm’s way in our 
country for, potentially, months. This 
is the time for us to stand up and to 
stay here in order to get these issues 
resolved this week. We shouldn’t do it 
next week. We should do it this week. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I agree 
with everything that has been said. I 
agree that, basically, we should never 
have left here Thursday night. So 
many of us could, maybe, drive home. I 
was able to drive home and was able to 
drive back. Yet so many people were 
put in harm’s way when they went 
home on airplanes. As you might know, 
we don’t have the youngest crowd—I 
think our average age is about 62 
here—so it is putting them and their 
families and, basically, the people they 
work with in danger also. 
Let me tell you what we are talking 
about here. If we are going to come to 
the aid of the economy of this country, 
I have no doubt that Democrats and 
Republicans will come together to take 
care and help people. I hope they real-
ize the people who really need help are 
the people who cannot make it from 
one week to the next, let alone from 
one paycheck to the next. 
I was out last week just in DC, and I 
talked to a young waiter—a very, very 
nice, young man. 
I asked: What happens if you have to 
go home for 2 weeks? 
He said: I am finished. I can’t make 
it. I can’t make my payments. I can’t 
make my house payment. I can’t make 
my rent payment. I can’t make my 
grocery payment. 
He was done. That is how worried he 
was. He said no one had asked him that 
question. These are the people we have 
to worry about. 
I want to bring to your attention one 
more thing. As of 2:30 this afternoon, 
my State didn’t have one reported 
case. Now, that is great. That is won-
derful. I pray to the good Lord that 
this is the case that we have none, but 
let me tell you the thing that scares 
me. I have the most at-risk population 
base in the Nation. The Kaiser report 
that came out showed the State of 
West Virginia as being the most in dan-
ger of all of the States with its having 
the most vulnerable people. 
I have over 720,000 elderly. I have 
over 220,000 who are critically ill under 
60 years of age. If you put all of this to-
gether, of the over 1.8 million people, I 
have over 1 million who could be abso-
lutely, totally devastated by this virus 
if it hits, and we haven’t shown one 
case yet. Of the 1.8 million people I 
have told you about and of the 1 mil-
lion who are in vulnerable situations, 
we have had only 84 tests in my State 
as of 2:30. Now, 80 have come back neg-
ative, and as of 2:30, 4 are unknown. 
I am surrounded by five States in 
this wonderful, little State of mine, 
West Virginia. These are the most 
beautiful people in the world, and they 
have worked hard. A lot of them have 
respiratory illnesses, and they will be 
the first to be attacked. If it hits my 
State and if we are not prepared for it 
because, basically, we won’t even have 
the tests to identify who will be ill and 
who will need these treatments and 
will need the healthcare, the hospital 
care, what will we do? I don’t have the 
ventilators, and I don’t have the res-
pirators. I don’t have anything avail-
able to that many people who are that 
vulnerable. What do we do? 
I know of all of the financial aid we 
are talking about and of all of the help 
that we are going to need. We had bet-
ter concentrate on how we find a cure— 
on how we basically take care of the 
people who are the most vulnerable— 
and that would, first and foremost, pro-
tect the people of America. They are 
scared to death. I am scared. I am con-
cerned. I am afraid that my State of 
West Virginia is falling into a lapse to 
where the people of West Virginia 
might think: Oh, we are protected. No 
cases have been reported, so we are in 
good shape. 
I pray to the good Lord that this is 
the case, but my gut tells me that it is 
not. We just don’t know. 
Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield 
for a question through the Chair? 
Mr. MANCHIN. I yield to the Sen-
ator. 
Mr. DURBIN. We have the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act that 
passed the House of Representatives 
early on Saturday morning, which we 
could consider—and have in the past on 
a parliamentary basis—and which I 
have called for, and others have joined 
me. We should move on this and move 
on it quickly. The Senator from Massa-
chusetts has expanded it to other areas 
that we should be considering. While 
we are here, let’s get some work done. 
Among the things included in this is 
the testing. The Senator said there 
have been 84 tests in the entire State? 
Mr. MANCHIN. This is out of 1.8 mil-
lion people in the most vulnerable 
State in America. 
Mr. DURBIN. It is obvious that you 
cannot measure the actual rate of in-
fection until you have enough tests of 
those who are suspicious—who have a 
fever or a cough. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Senator, if you have 
seen the map of the United States, 
West Virginia stands out and doesn’t 
show anything. I think, how could that 
happen? 
Mr. DURBIN. We have faced the same 
thing with 12.5 million people. We have 
tested 360 a day for the entire State. It 
is ridiculous.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1757 
March 16, 2020 
Mr. MANCHIN. We have tested 84 
total. 
Mr. DURBIN. I know. 
The Governor has told me that we 
really don’t know how many people are 
infected. We don’t know the rate— 
whether it is going up and at what 
rate—and whether it is in certain areas 
of our State and not in others. So, if 
you don’t have testing, you don’t have 
knowledge, and you can’t fight a pan-
demic. 
I would just say to the Senator that 
this was the highest priority in this 
bill that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives on Saturday. 
Mr. MANCHIN. We should have been 
here on Saturday. 
Mr. DURBIN. We should have been 
here on Saturday. We should take it up 
today. What are we waiting for? For 
goodness’ sakes, we ought to do it. 
Mr. DURBIN. The other thing is food 
assistance, and I know your State 
struggles. There are many people, as 
you said. It is not paycheck to pay-
check; it is week to week. Some of 
them qualify for food stamps, the 
SNAP program. 
Mr. MANCHIN. I will tell you what 
we were able to do on that. I sent a let-
ter last week immediately to Sonny 
Perdue, and he answered immediately. 
We were able to get all of the kids—be-
cause we have so many children in 
West Virginia who rely on their break-
fast and their lunch from the schools 
for nutrition, we are going to be deliv-
ering. The school is doing that. 
The State is taking some steps to 
shut things down. Schools have been 
shut down. They have said no more 
community 
gatherings 
whatsoever. 
They have done all of the things they 
were told to do. We just don’t know 
where the virus may be, if it is there, 
and how it is going to affect us. 
Mr. DURBIN. It starts with testing. 
It is food assistance, and it is also addi-
tional Medicaid money coming back to 
the State. I am sure the State of West 
Virginia, 
like 
Illinois, 
desperately 
needs it. 
I was surprised to learn today that 
the capacity of hospitals in the United 
States is less than 1 million patients, 
fewer than 1 million patients. In a na-
tion of 350 million people, we have hos-
pital capacity of less than 1 million, 
and when it comes to the intensive 
care units, it is a much, much smaller 
number than that. So that is our fear. 
If this goes rampant, it could over-
whelm our hospital system. 
Certainly Medicaid money back to 
your State and mine in this bill that 
passed the House should be authorized 
tonight. We should vote on this to-
night. 
Mr. MANCHIN. The economics of this 
whole thing right now is, first of all, 
we should know who is infected, where 
the infection is going, and how ramp-
ant this will be. We don’t know yet. 
Next of all, who is the most vulner-
able economically? The people who 
work day to day, paycheck to pay-
check, and week to week. That is 
where the relief—— 
Mr. DURBIN. Medical leave. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Exactly. We have to 
do some things and do them quickly. 
And if this thing doesn’t come up, we 
should sit here and protest until it does 
come up. There is no reason we can’t 
do it tonight. 
Mr. DURBIN. There is no reason. And 
if the President was credible—and I be-
lieve he was when he called this a na-
tional healthcare emergency—we ought 
to act like it. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Well, today he recog-
nized it and came forth and basically 
said today in that press release that I 
listened to—he basically acknowledged 
the threat of what we are dealing with 
and the enormity of what we are deal-
ing with. It was the first time I have 
heard basically the concern that we 
have that this thing is bigger than any 
of us, but all of us together can fight 
this. 
But I would ask the majority leader: 
Mr. Majority Leader, we should have 
stayed here. Yet we are here now. Let’s 
do it. 
Mr. DURBIN. Let’s do it. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Let’s do it. No blame. 
No blame. Let’s just do it. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to 
speak briefly about hard decisions. 
There are hard decisions that have 
been made all over our country in re-
cent days and weeks—decisions by su-
perintendents of school districts on 
whether to shut down their schools and 
send their children home; hard deci-
sions made by mayors about how to 
provide for first responders, for those 
who run the paramedic and ambulance 
and police services, and the 9/11 centers 
and the public hospitals; decisions by 
Governors about where and when and 
whether to declare states of emer-
gency. We have seen decisions made by 
faith leaders, by sports leaders, by 
school leaders—leaders of all types at 
all levels. 
But the most important decisions 
that are being made tonight are around 
America’s kitchen tables, where folks 
are looking at each other and saying: 
How much longer will I have a job? 
How much longer will we be able to put 
food on the table? How will we care for 
our kids who are unexpectedly home 
from school or college or overseas for 
days or weeks? How much longer can 
we stay in our home before we have to 
go see our mom, our grandmom, our 
uncle, our father, who is in a skilled 
nursing facility, who is scared and 
alone? 
Just this afternoon, seven counties in 
California announced a shelter-in-place 
order. We have seen counties, cities, 
and communities all over our country 
gradually move from a very relaxed 
and casual attitude, to a very con-
cerned attitude, to being on high alert, 
to now, in half a dozen communities 
around our country, looking more like 
Italy than they do like America of a 
month ago. 
It has been a slow-rolling response, 
and we should have been here this 
weekend to make sure that the Senate 
of the United States stepped forward 
and did our job and made our hard deci-
sions. 
I take some encouragement from the 
fact that the first round of support— 
$8.3 billion—got crafted, taken up, 
passed, and signed into law in just a 
matter of 2 weeks—long overdue, but 
$8.3 billion that went out for vaccine 
development, for test kits, for personal 
protective equipment, to put a floor 
underneath 
this 
burgeoning 
public 
health crisis that is COVID–19 as it has 
spread now to every State in our coun-
try. 
The next package that has already 
been passed by the House—that should 
be considered by this body—we must 
take up and pass immediately, and it 
directly speaks to those hard decisions 
at homes all over our country. It 
speaks to folks who are concerned that 
they don’t have health insurance. It 
speaks to folks who are concerned that 
they don’t have unemployment insur-
ance. It speaks to folks who don’t know 
where their kids—who used to get 
school lunches—are going to get their 
next good meal. It speaks to some of 
the challenges of the most vulnerable 
in our country. 
I don’t know about my colleagues, 
but I took a lot of phone calls this 
weekend from constituents who are 
concerned, who are anxious, who are 
angry, who want to know what we are 
doing at the Federal level to provide 
backup; folks who run nonprofits that 
are struggling to keep their services 
available and to stay open under great 
pressure; folks who run faith services 
in our community who canceled their 
services, closed their buildings, but 
now have half a dozen organizations 
communities rely on, whether it is a 
food pantry, a clothes closet, or a job- 
training service; folks who are anxious 
about what will happen to their staff 
and their students at their schools; in 
particular, folks who are anxious about 
what will happen to the seniors in their 
skilled nursing facilities or in their 
hospitals. 
As you have heard my colleagues 
speak to, our hospital system does not 
have the capacity for thousands and 
thousands of newly diagnosed folks to 
present 
themselves 
at 
emergency 
rooms, seeking hospitalization around 
our country. 
We should act immediately to deliver 
the sorts of mobilized Federal re-
sources that the Army Corps of Engi-
neers, the Veterans’ Administration, 
the Department of Defense, and State 
and local FEMA affiliates and agencies 
can deliver to scale up our response in 
a prompt and appropriate way. 
We should not leave this building and 
session until we have taken up and put 
together a package that will provide an 
appropriate stimulus for working fami-
lies all over our country, provide a 
floor for small businesses and for work-
ing families who will be gravely con-
cerned tonight about what will happen 
tomorrow.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1758 
March 16, 2020 
We have hard choices to make, but 
that is why people hire us. Instead of 
being here in a largely empty Chamber 
with nothing on our agenda tonight, we 
should be taking up, debating, passing, 
and sending to the President for signa-
ture bold strokes that will give con-
fidence to the American people and ad-
dress the concerns that families all 
over our Nation are facing tonight, and 
then, for our health and the health of 
our staff and our families, we should go 
into recess. But we should not do so, as 
we just did for a long weekend, until 
we take up and pass these pressing 
measures of national interest. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, let me 
associate myself with the remarks of 
the Senator from Delaware and others 
who spoke before him. 
We are here. We are all in town. We 
came back for an expected vote tonight 
that did not occur. There is no excuse 
for us not to be voting at this moment 
on an assistance package that is going 
to be dispositive on some of the tough-
est decisions that many American fam-
ilies will make over the course of this 
year or next. 
Let me drill down on what those de-
cisions are. Right now, there are par-
ents in my State of Connecticut who 
have to go to work tomorrow but have 
a child who is home from school, and 
they have to make a decision as to 
whether they are going to forgo tomor-
row’s paycheck and stay home from 
work, possibly face termination or dis-
cipline, or leave their child at home 
alone or in an unsafe environment. 
There are thousands and thousands of 
families in my State who cannot afford 
to miss a paycheck—a paycheck—that 
is the difference between being able to 
put food on the table or not, whether or 
not their kids have diapers, whether 
the lights stay on. That is the decision 
many families are making tomorrow in 
Connecticut. 
Here is another decision that many 
individuals are making in my State: 
Tonight there are a lot of moms and 
dads who have a cough, who are start-
ing to feel a little fever coming on, but 
they have work tomorrow, and they 
have a paycheck they need for their 
family, and they don’t have paid sick 
leave as part of their compensation 
package. That is not part of their con-
tractual deal with their employer. So 
they are making that decision. Do I 
forgo a paycheck? Do I risk getting 
fired or disciplined, or do I go to work 
even though I am not feeling well, even 
though I have symptoms that I know 
are problematic? 
They are facing those decisions to-
night because we weren’t here this 
weekend, because a bill passed the 
House that had in it an answer for 
many of those families—not all of 
those families—had guaranteed paid 
sick leave for thousands and thousands 
of workers all across this country who 
were waiting for that assurance that if 
they stayed home with their child who 
is home from school or they decided to 
stay home with the beginnings of 
symptoms that look like COVID–19, 
they would be protected financially. 
That bill was ready for action here in 
the Senate, and had we passed it on 
Saturday or Sunday, there would have 
been thousands of parents, thousands 
of workers, who would have stayed 
home today. But they didn’t. They 
didn’t. 
I know this to be true. I know this to 
be true—that there were many, many 
workers who went to work today even 
though they might not have been feel-
ing well, didn’t stay home with their 
kids because they didn’t feel they could 
go without that paycheck. So this is 
about real-life, minute-by-minute deci-
sions that are being made by families 
in this country. 
I know sometimes it doesn’t feel that 
important if we wait a day. I know 
sometimes it feels like a bummer if we 
have to miss out on a weekend. But not 
this weekend. Not today. These deci-
sions that families are making are fun-
damentally different if we do it a day 
ahead of time. 
The epidemic has less of a chance at 
winning if we pass this legislation to-
night rather than tomorrow or Wednes-
day or Thursday. And I worry about 
that because I have listened to some of 
my Republican colleagues suggest over 
the last 24 hours that we are not going 
to pass this bill, that we are going to 
change the bill, that we are going to 
amend it and we are going to send it 
back to the House. 
This bill is ready. It has bipartisan 
support. The President announced on 
Friday night that he was for it. No rea-
son to wait in order to give our con-
stituents some assurances, in order to 
make sure they are making the right 
decisions for their family and for their 
health and for all of our health rather 
than decisions necessary in order to 
guarantee that next paycheck comes, 
which is essential—essential—for their 
family’s financial health. 
Lastly, I just don’t want to let the 
President of the United States off the 
hook here. I watched yet another one 
of these press conferences yesterday in 
which he once again sort of glossed 
over the gravity of the moment, in 
which he hinted that young people 
didn’t have as much to worry about as 
older people, in which he once again 
savaged the press, attacking them 
right at the moment when Americans 
are relying on the media to give them 
information that is going to keep them 
safe. 
I talked to several of my hospital 
leaders today, and they talked about 
the fact that not only do they need per-
sonal protective equipment—they are 
running out—not only do they need 
more ventilators, but some of my hos-
pitals don’t even have the swabs nec-
essary to do the tests. That is not an 
issue today because they can’t get the 
tests processed, but once we get the 
testing capacity ramped up, they are 
not sure they will have the swabs nec-
essary to do the tests. 
It is just inexcusable that we got 
caught this unready. It is inexcusable 
that many of us were sitting in a meet-
ing with the President’s representa-
tives in early February, begging for a 
supplemental bill to be sent to the Sen-
ate and House then so that we would be 
ready when the disease ramped up and 
were told by the administration that 
they didn’t need it, that they had 
enough resources. 
It is unacceptable that to this day, 
this President doesn’t understand the 
urgency of this crisis. This is a crisis of 
a pandemic sweeping the country, but 
it is also a crisis of leadership. It is 
also a crisis of leadership. And at the 
very least, we need to keep the heat on 
this President to be accurate in his 
portrayal of the scope and the danger 
of this national public health emer-
gency, and on a daily basis, he is fail-
ing even to just be honest with the 
American people. 
I really hope that we get this done 
tomorrow. It doesn’t look like we are 
coming in tonight. For my constitu-
ents in Connecticut, they can’t wait 
another 24 hours, they can’t wait an-
other 48 hours to know whether they 
are going to have at least some mod-
icum of protection if they choose to do 
the right thing by their family, do the 
right thing by their health. We need to 
provide them that assurance, and we 
need to do it immediately. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am 
going to conclude for the sake of the 
staff and yourself and others who are 
here, who, as I mentioned earlier, are 
at risk. We are all at risk with this 
pandemic. 
But just to summarize as quickly as 
I can, we returned this week when we 
were supposed to be back in our States. 
We returned this week because there 
was pressing legislative business. One 
of the items before us, raised by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, the Republican lead-
er, was the Foreign Intelligence Sur-
veillance Act reauthorization. There 
are some Senators who have questions 
and objections to the bill that passed 
the House. Those Senators on the Re-
publican side and on the Democratic 
side came to the floor last Thursday 
and said: We will agree to an extension 
of this law if you will give us a chance 
to actually debate our concerns on the 
floor of the Senate. That request was 
rejected last week by Senator MCCON-
NELL. 
So tonight we were going to have the 
showdown vote to see whether or not 
we move forward on this, and, lo and 
behold, moments before that vote, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL agreed to what he re-
fused to agree to last Thursday. Yes, 
we will have a temporary extension, 
and we will have debate and amend-
ments before that extension expires. 
So one of the reasons that we were 
drawn back to Washington, when we 
were counseled by all the medical ex-
perts not to take unnecessary airline 
flights, was for a matter that was re-
solved without a vote tonight.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1759 
March 16, 2020 
I came to the floor after that and 
said: If that is the case, then, for good-
ness sakes, the only other remaining 
matter pending before us is the Fami-
lies First Coronavirus Response Act, 
passed by the House of Representatives 
in the early hours of Saturday: free 
testing for coronavirus, strengthening 
food assistance, safeguarding Medicaid 
benefits, enhancing unemployment as-
sistance, and establishing paid leave. 
My request then was and still is, Why 
don’t we pass that by voice vote? Let’s 
do it. 
This was a measure agreed to on a bi-
partisan 
basis 
by 
Speaker 
NANCY 
PELOSI and by the President of the 
United States, Donald Trump. If the 
two of them can come together and 
agree on it, are you telling me we can’t 
agree on it in the Senate? And if some-
one wants to vote no, so be it. Place 
your vote on the record. But for some 
reason we are not going to do that. We 
are going to sit around tonight and 
come back tomorrow. 
Will we do it tomorrow? I don’t 
know. But there is no sense of urgency 
in the Senate, as there should be—first, 
for the people in this country who are 
facing this virus and the disruption in 
their own personal lives. Some of those 
people are losing jobs, and some are 
sick and should stay away from their 
jobs. They want to know what this bill 
says that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives—that there is medical 
leave for them if they are sick and 
can’t work, and then, if they lose their 
jobs, if there is going to be some assist-
ance for their families in this time of 
trouble. Those are reasonable requests 
by every family. That is the highest 
priority. Why would we wait to take 
that up? Why would we delay that deci-
sion and leave more uncertainty among 
the people of Illinois and across Amer-
ica? There is no reason or excuse for it. 
Let’s get that done. 
Secondly, this measure also says that 
we are going to continue to work on a 
bipartisan basis to solve this problem. 
Let’s take this up tomorrow morning. 
As was noted before, we raised, in the 
initial bill to deal with this pandemic, 
the President’s ask from $2 billion to $8 
billion and did it on a bipartisan basis 
to put the medical and healthcare re-
sources to work across America. We 
should and we did, and we did it with a 
minimum of debate on a bipartisan 
basis. 
This bill, the second bill in the pack-
age, should have been treated exactly 
the same way. It should have moved 
through the Senate without asking all 
the Senators to return, the staff to 
come here, the Capitol Hill Police and 
others to protect us, and all the staff 
support that we have. We didn’t have 
to go through this. We should have 
done this. 
If Senator MCCONNELL and the Re-
publican leadership would have reached 
out, he would have found there was a 
lot of cooperation available on our side 
of the aisle—again, on a bipartisan 
basis. 
I don’t disagree with what the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts said. There is 
more to be done—a lot more to be done. 
We will discover it, and we should 
move on it quickly. But for the time 
being, pass this bill. Tell the American 
people we heard you and we know what 
we are up against, and we are in it to-
gether, on a bipartisan basis. 
Let’s not dream up some way in the 
Senate rules to drag this out day after 
weary day and expose one another to 
the virus that has been rampantly 
crossing this country and threatening 
us every single day. We need to do this 
work, get it done, and get it done 
quickly. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. SUL-
LIVAN). The Senator from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
came here today from Connecticut, 
where I have been to hospitals and 
local public health departments, small 
and large businesses, places where 
healthcare is provided and where the 
backbone of our economy is done. And 
I came here to vote. I came here to 
vote on a package passed by an over-
whelming bipartisan majority in the 
House of Representatives. 
That overwhelming bipartisan spirit 
should be what animates us as we seek 
to save lives and livelihoods. We are 
literally on the cusp of an existential 
crisis in this country that will trans-
form the lives of almost every Amer-
ican of almost every age and back-
ground and religious creed. Yet, in the 
face of that crisis, we will have no vote 
tonight. That is disgraceful. It is 
shameful. 
In the course of traveling around 
Connecticut, I have visited hospitals in 
Milford, Hartford, and in other places 
around the State and local health de-
partments and with local officials who 
have said to me that there is still inad-
equate testing because the Federal 
Government has still failed to fulfill 
its promise to provide that testing. 
There are fears that the surge of 
health cases as a result of coronavirus 
will deplete the resources of hospitals 
and other healthcare facilities because 
there are deficient numbers of ICUs 
and ventilators, and still the Federal 
Government 
has 
failed 
to 
provide 
them. 
There is fear and anxiety about the 
future of our economy when parents 
have to make decisions about whether 
to stay home now to take care of their 
children because they are out of school 
or because their family has one person 
who is ill from this virus, and they are 
all quarantined. 
Will they be able to pay their mort-
gages and put food on the table? They 
are literally living from paycheck to 
paycheck. They are trying to make it 
in real time, right now. 
Likewise, I met this morning with 
small business owners and managers 
who are fearful they will literally be-
come insolvent, they will go bankrupt, 
they will go under because they have 
insufficient resources to weather this 
financial storm. They are receiving no 
revenue, but they still have overhead 
expenses. If they are restaurants, they 
are now, in effect, closed. If they are 
retail establishments, most people are 
staying home. If they are small busi-
nesses, the backbone of the economy in 
providing jobs, they are challenged and 
they have to make real decisions in 
real time, right now. 
The package that is available for us 
to vote on would provide relief to those 
families and those businesses, to people 
who are anxious about the future of 
their lives and livelihoods, who have to 
make those hard decisions right now, 
tonight, about what they will do. It 
would provide paid sick leave and 
emergency medical and family leave 
and strengthen unemployment com-
pensation, as well as tax credits. For 
our States, it would provide a kind of 
expanded Medicaid support—$440 mil-
lion for Connecticut alone and hun-
dreds of millions for other States 
around the country. 
We need to embark on that program 
of massive support and sweeping inter-
national cooperation and unsparing 
truth telling about the dimension of 
this crisis—no more magical thinking 
or happy talk. We are about to see 
numbers soar, and, as Anthony Fauci 
said, we are about to see Americans 
hunker down, as they must do, and, in 
that period, what we have before us in 
legislation will mean, potentially, life 
and death decisions. Time matters. 
Hours and days are profoundly signifi-
cant when families have to make these 
decisions. We can delay, but it is to the 
ultimate profound damage of those 
lives, and we can make a difference if 
we act now. 
We could have acted by unanimous 
consent over the weekend. I am sorry 
that the Senate went home and that 
there was no action. But we need to act 
now—if not tonight, tomorrow morn-
ing. It should have been this afternoon 
because the loss of time is a loss of op-
portunity that we cannot afford. 
The small business people who met 
with me this morning, the health direc-
tors in New London and in other cities, 
such as Hartford, the hospital adminis-
trators in Hartford and Milford, the 
local officials, the mayors around the 
State of Connecticut, and the small 
business community who were hosted 
today by the MetroHartford Alliance 
said to me: We need action. 
We have an obligation to act. We can-
not allow time to pass without action. 
We owe it to the people of Connecticut 
and the American people that there be 
action to meet that surge and chal-
lenge for the hospitals, to provide that 
assistance in grants, not just loans, in 
this package and then in a next pack-
age. 
There must be additional steps. I sup-
port the initiative that I understand 
may be coming from Senator SCHUMER 
and others and join in that initiative 
for hundreds of billions of dollars in aid 
to meet this crisis on the homefront as 
well as in the economic arena.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1760 
March 16, 2020 
Truth telling to the American people 
means recognizing the extraordinary, 
unprecedented, historic magnitude of 
the challenge before us. The scope and 
scale of potential suffering can be re-
duced. We owe it to the American peo-
ple to act. There is no excuse for delay. 
The failure to act is unconscionable 
and inconceivable, given the mag-
nitude of the challenge but also given 
the resolute and resilient spirit that I 
have seen across Connecticut. Whether 
it is with Americans donating to people 
who need it—supplies and other kinds 
of necessities—or the spirit of giving 
that I have seen among faith leaders 
and public officials, the courage of po-
lice and firefighters and emergency re-
sponders, 
and 
the 
dedication 
of 
healthcare providers, whether it is in 
hospitals or clinics like Charter Oak in 
Hartford and across Connecticut, ev-
erywhere that I have visited, I have 
seen that American spirit coming for-
ward—the great, positive spirit of 
America and the ingenuity. That was 
the word that one of the small business 
people this morning used to myself and 
David Griggs at the MetroHartford Al-
liance. The ingenuity of meeting this 
challenge, whether it is in research for 
new vaccines or devising new ways to 
deliver the tests or providing for more 
ventilators and intensive care units— 
that ingenuity is truly American. The 
dedication of those healthcare givers, 
first responders, small business people, 
local officials, and others around the 
State and around the country ought to 
inspire us to do better and to take this 
vote and do our job. 
I yield the floor.

RESOLUTION 
544—SUP-
PORTING THE DESIGNATION OF 
MARCH 
2020 
AS 
‘‘NATIONAL 
COLORECTAL 
CANCER 
AWARE-
NESS MONTH’’ 
Mr. 
ENZI 
(for 
himself 
and 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions: 
S. RES. 544 
Whereas colorectal cancer is the second 
leading cause of cancer death among men 
and women combined in the United States; 
Whereas it is estimated that, in 2020, 
147,950 individuals in the United States will 
be diagnosed with colorectal cancer and ap-
proximately 53,200 individuals will die from 
the disease; 
Whereas colorectal cancer is one of the 
most preventable forms of cancer because 
screening tests can allow for the discovery 
and removal of polyps before the polyps be-
come cancerous; 
Whereas 
screening 
tests 
can 
detect 
colorectal cancer early, which is when the 
disease is most treatable; 
Whereas the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services estimates that if every indi-
vidual 50 years of age or older had regular 
screening tests, as many as 60 percent of 
deaths from colorectal cancer could be pre-
vented; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for pa-
tients with localized colorectal cancer is 90 
percent, but only 39 percent of all diagnoses 
occur at this stage; 
Whereas screening tests can reduce the in-
cidence of colorectal cancer and mortality, 
but approximately 1 in 3 adults between 50 
and 75 years of age are not current with rec-
ommended colorectal cancer screening;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

March 16, 2020 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JULIA BROWNLEY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 16, 2020 
Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Madam 
Speaker, I was unable to vote on Roll Call 
102, passage of the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act. Had I been present, I would 
have voted AYE. 
f 
FAMILIES FIRST CORONAVIRUS 
RESPONSE ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ANNA G. ESHOO 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, March 13, 2020 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of the Families First Coronavirus Response 
Act. Today’s legislation comes on the heels of 
an $8.3 billion bipartisan bicameral package 
passed last week to strengthen our nation’s 
public health response to the coronavirus. 
The Families First Act specifically protects 
working families from facing the terrible choice 
between staying home to avoid spreading the 
virus and losing the money they need to sur-
vive. It contains the following: free coronavirus 
testing for everyone who needs a test, includ-
ing the uninsured; paid leave for up to three 
months for those who have to stay home be-
cause of the virus; unemployment benefits for 
those who lose their job or are furloughed dur-
ing the crisis; increased federal funding to 
make sure our families have food through 
home-delivered meals to seniors, local food 
banks, and the SNAP program; and increased 
federal funds for Medicaid to support our local, 
state, tribal, and territorial governments and 
health systems in combatting this crisis. Cali-
fornia will receive $4.46 billion in Medicaid 
funding to fight coronavirus through this legis-
lation. 
Taken together, this legislation protects 
what’s most important—the families and chil-
dren who are at risk because of the 
coronavirus. I ask all my colleagues to join me 
in supporting the Families First Coronavirus 
Response Act today. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. RAU´L M. GRIJALVA 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, March 16, 2020 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to express my strong support for H.R. 
6201, the Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act. It is imperative that we keep our 
communities safe from the coronavirus by pro-
tecting our health care workers and keeping 
our working families financially secure. This 
legislation signals to employers that they 
should urge their employees to stay home 
when sick—one of the most important things 
we can do to slow transmission. Making test-
ing widely availability is vital to understanding 
the depth and course of the outbreak. The 
economic relief and safeguards for families, 
seniors, and children will help keep them 
healthy 
and 
allow 
appropriate 
social 
distancing. 
Had I been present, I would have voted 
YEA on Roll Call No. 102.
