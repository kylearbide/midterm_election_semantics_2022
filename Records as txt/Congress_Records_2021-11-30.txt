AMERICA IS FACING A DRUG 
CRISIS 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, as we speak today, America is 
facing a drug crisis that is crippling 
our communities. 
During the month of October, over 
800 pounds of fentanyl were seized at 
our southern border. The drug crisis of 
our Nation and what we are experi-
encing is a direct result of the failed 
border policies that have been put in 
place by the Biden administration. 
Recently, I spoke with the Chambers-
burg police chief, Ron Camacho, who 
said more and more deadly drugs like 
fentanyl are responsible for overdoses 
in our Pennsylvania communities. 
In my district alone, we saw a 30 per-
cent rise in overdose deaths between 
2019 and 2020, and sadly, that number is 
on the rise again. Now is the time for 
Congress to take swift and decisive ac-
tion. 
We must ensure that law enforce-
ment has the tools that they need to 
save lives, protect our communities 
and keep this lethal drug off of our 
streets. 
f 
HONORING PASTOR JAMES D. 
CORBETT 
(Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to pay a heartfelt 
tribute to Pastor James D. Corbett of 
Greenville, North Carolina, to honor 
his long and illustrious service to God 
and to his country. 
In his younger years, Pastor Corbett 
served this great Nation of ours in the 
United States Army. He then left mili-
tary service to begin his ministry. 
In 1984, Pastor Corbett and the late 
Pastor Delores Corbett founded Green-
ville Community Christian Church. 
God gave him a vision to minister to 
the whole man: spirit, soul and body. 
Pastor Corbett also currently serves 
as the Eastern Regional Director and 
Trustee for the International Conven-
tion of Faith Ministries. Their vision 
includes reaching communities with 
the Gospel and taking the message of 
Jesus Christ around the whole world. 
Lives are saved, healed, and delivered 
by the power of God through his min-
istry. I have personally been blessed by 
his wonderful services and sermons for 
many years now. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in hon-
oring the accomplishments of a won-
derful man, a caring father, grand-
father, and leader of his flock, Pastor 
James D. Corbett, and recognizing all 
that he has done for his community.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6680 
November 30, 2021 
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS LEAVING 
YOU BEHIND 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of all Americans who 
feel that they are being abandoned by 
the current administration. I share 
this sentiment. 
To be clear, President Biden is the 
President of now leaving you behind. 
He will leave you behind in Afghani-
stan. He will leave your job behind if 
you don’t comply with his mandates. 
He will leave our borders behind in 
favor of illegal immigrants. He will 
leave our economy behind for China to 
surpass. He plain old leads from behind. 
I propose we leave President Biden’s 
dangerous policies behind before our 
children’s futures are ultimately de-
stroyed. It is time for our leaders to 
put America first by securing our bor-
der, keeping our Nation’s promises to 
veterans and overseas allies, and in 
ending the senseless Washington spend-
ing addiction. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN IS LEADING IN 
THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
(Mr. COHEN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, President 
Biden is leading this country in the 
right direction. He is moving us for-
ward, but the Republicans refuse to see 
it. 
The Build Back Better bill will help 
middle class families, produce more 
jobs, reduce taxes, and make costs less 
on 
prescription 
drugs, 
on 
home 
healthcare for seniors, on childcare for 
working mothers, and give them an op-
portunity to participate in America’s 
economy. 
President Biden led us on the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill. Bipartisan? 
Yeah, not much. There were 17 Repub-
licans in the Senate, maybe 16, only 13 
in the House. There is nothing partisan 
about getting goods to market, about 
speeding up the supply chain, which 
happens when you get good roads and 
the opportunity for trucks to travel on 
them, trains to proceed, and airplanes 
to deliver their cargo. 
President Biden is leading us in the 
right direction. We just have to hope 
that the Senate and the Republicans 
here will help us in this last month as 
we try to raise the debt ceiling to pay 
for Trump’s tax scam and to pass a 
budget. 
f 
BUILD BACK BROKE 
(Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address the most expen-
sive bill and largest tax increase in 
American history, the recently passed 
build back broke bill. 
The legislation reads like a far-left 
Christmas wish list that isn’t com-
pletely paid for. It is filled with more 
than 150 social programs and budget 
gimmicks that make these expensive 
programs appear less costly on paper, 
although Democrats intend to make 
them permanent. 
Some of these include $7.4 billion for 
electric bicycles, a SALT tax cut of 
$25,900 for millionaires, $80 billion to 
the IRS, and $100 billion toward am-
nesty for illegal immigrants. 
What is equally concerning is what is 
not in the bill. Within the 2,000 pages, 
there is not a single mention of border 
control, China, or Afghanistan. This 
year especially, with record-breaking 
southern border apprehensions, Chinese 
missile testing, and the Taliban take-
over of Afghanistan, Congress should 
prioritize investing in our country’s 
safety and security. 
Mr. Speaker, Democrats have dou-
bled down on failed policies and irre-
sponsible spending. It is simply out of 
touch with the desires of the American 
people. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S ENERGY 
CRISIS 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, President 
Biden’s energy crisis is the Christmas 
gift that nobody asked for. 
The national average for a gallon of 
gas reached $3.39 as of last Friday, the 
most Americans have paid at the pump 
since the Obama-Biden administration. 
Home heating costs are projected to 
rise as much as 54 percent for some 
households this winter. House Demo-
crats are even pushing a ‘‘heat your 
home tax’’ just in time for the holi-
days. 
If Americans thought Thanksgiving 
cost an arm and a leg, just wait until 
President Biden’s failed policies tor-
pedo Christmas entirely. At this rate, 
the only things Americans will find 
under their Christmas trees and in 
their stockings are more bills, not pre-
sents. 
Mr. Speaker, this lunacy must end.

HONORING

MAINTE-
NANCE 
TECHNICIAN 
FIRST 
CLASS JOSHUA GAETA 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor a military serv-
icemember from my district for his his-
toric and heroic actions that saved 
over 30 lives. 
Earlier this year, Joshua Gaeta of 
Muscatine and his Coast Guard crew 
were successful in a daring search and 
rescue operation involving 31 fishermen 
stranded on a ship that caught fire 200 
miles off the coast of Nova Scotia, Can-
ada. 
Facing winds of over 50 miles an 
hour, waves 30-feet high, and freezing 
cold temperatures, our Coast Guard, 
with Gaeta on board, bravely flew their 
helicopters to the scene and were able 
to save all 31 crew members. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Avia-
tion 
Maintenance 
Technician 
First 
Class Gaeta and all our servicemem-
bers for all that they do to keep our 
country safe. 
f 
CONGRESS HAS A CHOICE TO 
MAKE 
(Mr. ROY asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, we have a 
choice to make this week. We have a 
choice to make whether we are going 
to fund the United States Government 
and to fund the executive branch when 
that executive branch is carrying out 
often unlawful, unconstitutional, but 
certainly, unhelpful and foolish man-
dates that are crushing small busi-
nesses and causing people to lose their 
jobs, forcing our members of the mili-
tary to lose their ability to serve, forc-
ing members of the Border Patrol, 
DEA, and hospitals across this country 
to lose workers because of these man-
dates. 
Why would anybody in this Chamber 
vote to fund a government that is 
going to mandate that people have to 
lose their jobs through these unlawful 
orders? 
And the second thing we have got to 
decide is whether we are going to vote 
for a National Defense Authorization 
Act that, for the first time in history, 
will add women, 18-year-old girls, to 
the draft, without so much as a debate 
in this Chamber. 
I think we have an easy call, but we 
have got to make that call this week 
and decide what we are going to do.

f 
MATERNAL VACCINATION ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 951) to direct the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to carry 
out a national campaign to increase 
awareness of the importance of mater-
nal vaccinations for the health of preg-
nant and postpartum individuals and 
their children, and for other purposes, 
as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 951 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Maternal 
Vaccination Act’’. 
SEC. 2. MATERNAL VACCINATION AWARENESS 
AND EQUITY CAMPAIGN. 
(a) CAMPAIGN.—Section 313 of the Public 
Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 245) is amend-
ed— 
(1) in subsection (a), by inserting ‘‘and 
among pregnant and postpartum individ-
uals,’’ after ‘‘low rates of vaccination,’’; 
(2) in subsection (c)(3), by striking ‘‘pre-
natal and pediatric’’ and inserting ‘‘prenatal, 
obstetric, and pediatric’’; 
(3) in subsection (d)(4)(B), by inserting 
‘‘pregnant and postpartum individuals and’’ 
after ‘‘including’’; and 
(4) 
in 
subsection 
(g), 
by 
striking 
‘‘$15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2021 
through 2025’’ and inserting ‘‘$17,000,000 for 
each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026’’. 
(b) 
ADDITIONAL
ACTIVITIES.—Section 
317(k)(1)(E) of the Public Health Service Act 
(42 U.S.C. 247b(k)(1)(E)) is amended— 
(1) in clause (v), by striking ‘‘and’’ at the 
end; and 
(2) by adding at the end the following 
clause: 
‘‘(vii) increase vaccination rates of preg-
nant and postpartum individuals, including 
individuals from racial and ethnic minority 
groups, and their children; and’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 951. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, today, we are con-
tinuing our work to combat the mater-
nal mortality and morbidity crisis fac-
ing our country. The legislation before 
us will help ensure that pregnant 
women and their healthcare providers 
are aware of the benefits and avail-
ability of safe and effective vaccines. 
Tragically, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention reports that 
about 700 women die each year in the 
United States as a result of pregnancy 
or delivery complications. 
While there is no one cause of preg-
nancy-related death or health com-
plications, we know that some illnesses 
like flu, pertussis, and COVID–19 can 
cause serious harm to pregnant women, 
including early labor and delivery and 
other complications. Vaccines prevent 
these illnesses and can save the lives of 
pregnant and postpartum women and 
their children. 
However, despite strong evidence of 
vaccines’ safety and efficacy, vaccine 
uptake among pregnant women is far 
below targeted goals. 
We can and should do more to in-
crease the vaccination rate of pregnant 
women. H.R. 951, the Maternal Vac-
cination Act, will ensure that our vac-
cination outreach and awareness cam-
paigns and public health grant pro-
grams include outreach to obstetric 
healthcare providers, as well as preg-
nant and postpartum women. The leg-
islation will also ensure that we are 
reaching women from racial and ethnic 
groups and their children. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support 
this 
commonsense 
public 
health effort, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, current data clearly 
suggests that vaccinations for women 
during pregnancy can protect mothers 
and newborns against infectious dis-
eases. The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention has long recommended 
various 
vaccinations 
for 
pregnant 
women to improve maternal and infant 
health outcomes. 
Despite these recommendations, vac-
cination rates among pregnant women 
remain relatively low. But according to 
the American College of Obstetricians 
and Gynecologists, when a vaccine rec-
ommendation comes directly from a 
patient’s own OB–GYN, the likelihood 
of accepting that vaccine could be up 
to 50 times higher. 
The Maternal Vaccination Act re-
quires the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services to include obstetric 
providers in existing vaccination pub-
lic awareness campaign programs to 
help increase vaccinations among preg-
nant and postpartum women. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
proud support of H.R. 951 ‘‘The Maternal Vac-
cination Act.’’ 
I would like to thank Congresswoman SE-
WELL for introducing this legislation. 
This bill establishes a national campaign to 
raise awareness and increase rates of mater-
nal vaccinations and calls for the CDC to con-
sult with various stakeholders to carry out this 
campaign. 
In addition, the CDC must focus on increas-
ing vaccination rates among communities with 
historically high rates of unvaccinated individ-
uals. 
The CDC must also make publicly available 
any materials and resources developed for the 
campaign. 
In addition, H.R. 951 would instruct the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention to 
broaden a public awareness campaign on vac-
cinations to include pregnant and postpartum 
individuals and require the campaign to dis-
seminate vaccine information to providers and 
facilities that provide obstetric care. 
The bill would also authorize an additional 
$2 million annually from 2021 through 2025 for 
the vaccination awareness campaign. 
This bill would put pregnant women at the 
focus of the fight to combat COVID–19. 
As 
the 
Chair 
of 
the 
Congressional 
Coronavirus Task Force, I have used every 
means possible to sound the alarm about the 
seriousness of the COVID–19 virus. 
On February 10, 2020, I held the first press 
conference on the issue of COVID–19 at 
Houston Intercontinental Airport. 
I then held a second press conference on 
February 24th to continue efforts to raise pub-
lic knowledge of the impending threat. 
On February 26th, I wrote the Chair and 
Ranking Member of the Committee on Home-
land Security requesting to be briefed by Act-
ing Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf 
regarding the preparedness of the Department 
of Homeland Security to address a possible 
pandemic. 
On March 19th, I announced an innovative 
partnership with United Methodist Medical 
Center (UMMC) to open the first drive-through 
Coronavirus Test Screening facility in the 
Greater Houston area, which proved beneficial 
to everyone in the Greater Houston area, as 
with UMMC’s help we have opened multiple 
sites that are located within high-risk commu-
nities in the Greater Houston area, to reduce 
the need for travel to get access to COVID– 
19 testing. 
Since the start of this pandemic, I have 
sought to proactively address the critical 
issues and concerns tied to the COVID–19 
virus. 
As I stated at the beginning of this pan-
demic, ‘‘We must not panic, but prepare.’’ 
I am pleased to see that this bill is not a 
panic-induced response, but a well-thought-out 
proposal to further protect our citizens. 
When pregnant women get vaccinated, they 
not only build their immune system to the 
virus, they also create antibodies for their un-
born child. 
Throughout history the vaccination of preg-
nant mothers has shown to be beneficial when 
it comes to viruses like tetanus, influenza, per-
tussis. 
With this bill we can help newborn children 
who have not yet developed their immune sys-
tems fight off a deadly virus such as COVID– 
19. 
This also gives mothers piece of mind that 
they’ll be safe as they advance in their preg-
nancy. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in proud support of H.R. 
951, the Maternal Vaccination Act.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1550. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1550, the PREVENT HPV Can-
cers Act. This bill will help prevent 
cancer in thousands of individuals by 
stepping up our outreach and education 
to ensure that we are reaching people 
eligible for human papillomavirus, or 
HPV vaccines. 
HPV causes nearly 36,000 cases of 
cancer in men and women each year. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention has found that nearly 33,000 
of these cases can be prevented through 
vaccination. 
The HPV vaccine has been shown to 
be highly effective in most forms of 
HPV, and in turn, preventing cancer 
caused by the virus. For example, 
women 
who 
have 
been 
vaccinated 
against HPV have been shown to be 90 
percent less likely to be diagnosed with 
cervical cancer. 
Mr. Speaker, despite the high effi-
cacy of the vaccines and increased vac-
cination rates, the rates are still below 
CDC targets and far lower for HPV 
than for other recommended vaccines. 
And while cervical cancer rates have 
gone down, other types of HPV-associ-
ated cancers, including head and neck 
cancers, have been on the rise. 
We must do more to improve our out-
reach to teens and young adults, and 
this bill does that by creating a na-
tional campaign to educate health pro-
viders and the public on HPV, HPV-as-
sociated cancers, and the importance of 
HPV vaccines in preventing these can-
cers. 
Mr. Speaker, this bipartisan legisla-
tion passed unanimously out of the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
It deserves our support here on the 
floor, so please join me in preventing 
cancer and supporting this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
the 
human 
papillomavirus, or HPV, is a common 
virus in the United States, infecting 
about 13 million Americans each year. 
While 9 out of 10 HPV infections are be-
nign, in some circumstances, HPV can 
cause cancer. Records from the CDC in-
dicate about 36,000 cases of cancer each 
year are caused by this virus. Sadly, 
many of these infections and cancer di-
agnoses can be prevented by the HPV 
vaccine. 
H.R. 1550 would carry out a national 
campaign to increase awareness for 
healthcare providers and patients re-
garding these cancers. Additionally, 
the campaign will highlight the bene-
fits associated with HPV vaccines in 
preventing HPV and HPV-related can-
cers. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as she may consume to the 
gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. CAS-
TOR), the sponsor of the legislation. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Mr. Speaker, 
I thank Chairman PALLONE for yielding 
the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bipartisan legislation with Rep-
resentative KIM Schrier, the PREVENT 
HPV Cancers Act. 
Mr. Speaker, if Dr. Francis Collins, 
the head of the NIH, called a press con-
ference today and announced that we 
had found a cure for cancer, there 
would be cause for celebration. 
Well, since 2006, there has been a safe 
and effective vaccine that prevents six 
types of cancer, including HPV-related 
cancers, including cervical cancer and 
throat cancer. It has been a remark-
able development. The problem is that 
with these HPV-related cancers, there 
are no screening tests for many of 
these cancers, other than cervical can-
cer, for which there is a screening test. 
So you have to rely on prevention in 
order to avoid ever contracting these 
types of cancers. 
The other problem is that during the 
pandemic, there has been a dramatic 
drop-off in childhood vaccinations. It is 
very troubling. All childhood vaccina-
tions have fallen way off, but particu-
larly with the cancer-preventing HPV 
vaccine. 
According to data from CDC, HPV 
vaccinations fell by almost 64 percent 
for children ages 9 to 12, and they fell 
71 percent for young people ages 13 to 
17 compared to the previous two years. 
Last year alone, more than 1 million 
doses were missed. 
Mr. Speaker, here is what is also 
troubling, the trends that are here: 
There is a distinct rise among men and 
HPV-related cancers. Four out of ten 
HPV-related cancers occur among men: 
a lot of throat cancer. There are now 
14,000 men annually being diagnosed 
with HPV-related cancers. That is a 
five-fold increase over the past 20 
years. 
We can tackle this problem by help-
ing educate families and parents all 
across America to avoid these cata-
strophic diagnoses and save lives in 
doing it. 
The PREVENT HPV Cancers Act 
builds on work the CDC is already 
doing to raise awareness about gyneco-
logical cancers through Johanna’s Law 
and includes HPV and HPV-related 
cancers in the national public aware-
ness campaign to educate providers, 
parents, and the general public about 
the lifesaving HPV vaccine. This is es-
pecially important in rural areas where 
there has also been a very dramatic 
drop-off. 
I thank my friends back home at the 
Moffitt Cancer Center, Florida’s only 
NCI-designated cancer center, Dr. Anna 
Giuliano, who is an expert in the field, 
for educating me, and for bringing to-
gether advocates across the country. 
I thank Chairman PALLONE, Chair 
ESHOO, Ranking Member MCMORRIS 
RODGERS, and Chairman GUTHRIE very 
much for their help, and Dr. BURGESS 
as well for his support. Thank you for 
making this a bipartisan effort. 
I also thank Stephen Holland with 
the 
majority 
staff 
and 
Kristen 
Shatynski with the minority staff. 
Mr. Speaker, to the parents and fami-
lies, it is vitally important to know 
that you can prevent your children 
from ever contracting cancer through 
the HPV vaccine. It is safe and effec-
tive, and more parents need to under-
stand the import of doing this. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption, a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on H.R. 1550, the PREVENT HPV 
Cancers Act. 
b 1545 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, it was 16 
years ago that we first authorized 
Johanna’s Law, it was a long time ago. 
I was a fairly junior Member and Con-
gresswoman DELAURO had worked on it 
for a number of years before that. It is 
something that today will easily be re-
authorized—and America has been and 
will be better for—and seems easy. But 
it is never easy to begin the process of 
helping people understand what they 
don’t know. 
Misinformation or a failure to have 
information continues to cause young 
women to die of cancer needlessly: 
whether it is ovarian cancer, gyneco-
logical cancer of any sort, whether it is 
related to HPV, or some other fashion. 
The fact is, Johanna’s Law, H.R. 1550, 
which it is merged with, in fact, is 
something that America needs to un-
derstand today and in the future. 
When we originally passed Johanna’s 
Law, we had 257 cosponsors and could 
have had more. More than 100 Repub-
licans and Democrats signed on before 
we brought it to the floor. On that day, 
we said, if we can only get $10 million 
to get the awareness. We passed the 
bill and then we went looking for the 
money.

Over time the money has increased. 
The fact is, Americans today, espe-
cially young women, are not as in-
formed as they need to be. Reauthor-
izing both of these bills in one goes a 
step further to educating people about 
preventable death, preventable cancer. 
The fact is, I am thrilled that Con-
gress, in such a tumultuous time, from 
time to time, comes together across 
the aisle and does something so impor-
tant. 
These bills do not cost much, but the 
lives they save are precious and price-
less. Mr. Speaker, I urge its support. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
urge support for this bipartisan and 
very important bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
full support of H.R. 1550, the ‘‘PREVENT HPV 
Cancers Act of 2021.’’ 
I would like to thank my colleagues Con-
gresswoman KATHY CASTOR and Congress-
woman KIM SCHRIER for introducing this impor-
tant legislation. 
The ‘‘Promoting Resources to Expand Vac-
cination, Education and New Treatments for 
HPV Cancers Act’’ or the PREVENT HPV 
Cancers Act has the ultimate goal of pre-
venting HPV-related cancers. 
Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a very com-
mon virus that causes six types of cancers, 
leading to nearly 36,000 cases of cancer in 
the United States every year, according to the 
CDC. 
Nearly 42 million people are currently in-
fected with HPV in the United States. 
The HPV vaccine provides safe, effective, 
and lasting protection against the HPV infec-
tions that most commonly cause cancer. 
This vaccine is so effective that the World 
Health Organization established a goal of total 
eradication of cervical cancer—and this legis-
lation can be part of our nation’s commitment 
to reaching that goal. 
This vaccine can help prevent these can-
cers, and it is the goal of the PREVENT HPV 
Cancers Act to increase vaccination rates. 
HPV-related cancers disproportionately af-
fect individuals who are living on a lower in-
come, have lower education levels, and are 
from a racial or ethnic minority group. 
Increased public awareness and immuniza-
tion initiatives would help improve vaccination 
rates in these underserved communities. 
More comprehensive research on the HPV 
vaccine, as authorized in the PREVENT HPV 
Cancers Act, would also help better identify 
these disparities and ways to address them. 
There is rampant societal mistrust and vac-
cine hesitancy, and while immunizations are 
one of the greatest public health tools we 
have, they work best when there is wide-
spread use. 
This legislation will spread awareness so 
that more people will be vaccinated against 
HPV, and fund research to help stop the 
largely preventable deaths caused by HPV 
linked cancers. 
When we have the tools to prevent cancer, 
we should without a doubt utilize them.

the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1550, as

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 550. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 550, the Immunization Infra-
structure Modernization Act. This bill 
would authorize $400 million for grants 
to expand, enhance, and improve im-
munization information systems ad-
ministered by health departments and 
used by healthcare providers. 
Immunization information systems, 
also known as IIS, or immunization 
registries, are confidential, population- 
based, computerized databases that 
record immunization doses adminis-
tered by providers to patients. They 
are 
critical 
in 
our 
fight 
against 
COVID–19 and other public health 
threats like measles and influenza. 
Local public health officials use IIS 
to collect, analyze, store, and view ag-
gregated 
vaccination 
information, 
which is kept confidential and separate 
from identifiable patient information. 
This information helps them under-
stand overall vaccination levels so they 
can better guide public health deci-
sions for their communities. 
IIS 
also 
helps 
patients 
and 
healthcare providers by allowing them 
to view a secure consolidated immuni-
zation history, helping them determine 
appropriate and necessary vaccina-
tions, and reminding patients about 
vaccination schedules. 
IIS have been critical in the COVID– 
19 pandemic. They have helped us un-
derstand where vaccines are getting to 
patients, and where we need to do more 
to reach people and provide access. 
They provided near real-time informa-
tion sharing, allowing State officials 
and leadership at the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention to under-
stand vaccination rates and where peo-
ple are choosing to receive their vac-
cines. 
Like all forms of infrastructure, IIS 
require maintenance and upgrades. As I 
mentioned, IIS have been an important 
tool in the fight against COVID–19, but 
the pandemic has also tested the abil-
ity of IIS to keep up with the pace of 
our massive vaccination efforts. 
According to the American Immuni-
zation Registry Association, one State 
went from an average of 17,000 doses re-
corded in its IIS each day to over 
500,000 this past spring. This dramatic 
increase required the State health de-
partment to nearly quadruple the num-
ber of digital servers used to host the 
data. These are not one-time costs. 
Going forward, these new servers and 
the new data collected during the pan-
demic will need to be maintained and 
secured. 
State and local leaders have also told 
us that inconsistent and antiquated 
technology, incomplete provider par-
ticipation, 
and 
faltering 
interoper-
ability are areas where we must im-
prove to ensure that we have useful 
and quality data. 
It is important that the systems used 
by physicians are able to communicate 
with the State and local public health 
departments, and that these systems

can 
also 
communicate 
with 
other 
States and the CDC. 
H.R. 550, the bill before us today, ad-
dresses these challenges by providing 
grants for technological upgrades, pro-
vider outreach and enrollment, policy 
development, and a skilled workforce 
to build and maintain these systems. 
The legislation also requires the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices to create an implementation strat-
egy and set clear data standards that 
must be followed by all grantees. And 
this should help ensure that States are 
coordinated going forward. 
H.R. 550 will ensure all IIS are 
brought up to modern standards, help 
control disease outbreaks, and put our 
public health infrastructure on a solid 
foundation for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives 
Kuster and Bucshon for their bipar-
tisan work on this bill. I urge all Mem-
bers to support this important bipar-
tisan legislation, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
550, the Immunization Infrastructure 
Modernization Act, a bill introduced by 
my Energy and Commerce Committee 
colleagues, 
Ms. 
KUSTER
and 
Mr. 
BUCSHON. 
Immunization information systems, 
or IIS, are important tools in providing 
immunization care for patients by al-
lowing providers to view a patient’s 
comprehensive immunization history 
to determine the appropriate vaccina-
tions throughout their life. 
The 
Immunization 
Infrastructure 
Modernization Act authorizes the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to conduct activities to improve immu-
nization information systems. These 
activities include designating data and 
technology standards, developing pub-
lic-private partnerships, and awarding 
grants or cooperative agreements to 
health departments to enhance their 
systems. 
Modernizing our immunization infra-
structure will give us a better under-
standing of our current vaccination ef-
forts and will also help us determine 
which communities may need addi-
tional 
vaccination 
outreach—better 
targeting our efforts to improve health 
outcomes across the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers at this time, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Indiana (Mr. BUCSHON). 
Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 550, the Immunization 
Infrastructure Modernization Act of 
2021. 
Immunization information systems 
serve as a vital link between public 
health officials, community providers 
and individuals, not only in cases of 
disease outbreak or emergencies, but 
also during routine vaccination efforts. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has made 
clear that our immunization informa-
tion systems are in need of moderniza-
tion. 
Decisions in response to outbreaks 
must be based on science, and we must 
ensure our States and localities have 
access to meaningful data to make tar-
geted decisions that lessen the spread 
and quickly reopen our economies. 
H.R. 550 would repurpose previously 
appropriated funds to be spent through 
an existing grant program to improve 
and enhance the ability of immuniza-
tion information systems to securely 
exchange 
real-time 
immunization 
record data between all public health 
programs. 
As a doctor, I would take my pa-
tients’ medical privacy very seriously. 
Therefore, I want to make clear that 
the immunization information systems 
are secure, confidential, population- 
based databases, and are completely 
deidentified. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
Representative KUSTER for her partner-
ship, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
ask that we support this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 550, the ‘‘Immunization Infra-
structure Modernization Act of 2021,’’ which 
will improve our public health infrastructure 
and expand information-sharing between state 
and federal governments, as well as public 
and private health care providers, to ensure 
vaccines are being administered effectively 
and efficiently across all states and territories. 
Mr. Speaker, public health agencies work 
every day to prevent disease and viruses, pro-
mote health, and prepare for and respond to 
both emergency situations and ongoing chal-
lenges—but they cannot do so without the 
ability to access the best available data and 
share information with other experts, and the 
COVID–19 pandemic highlighted this fact. 
As 
the 
Chair 
of 
the 
Congressional 
Coronavirus Task Force, I have used every 
means possible to sound the alarm about the 
seriousness of the COVID–19 virus. 
On February 10, 2020, I held the first press 
conference on the issue of COVID–19 at 
Houston Intercontinental Airport. 
I then held a second press conference on 
February 24th to continue efforts to raise pub-
lic knowledge of the impending threat. 
On February 26th, I wrote the Chair and 
Ranking Member of the Committee on Home-
land Security requesting to be briefed by Act-
ing Secretary of Homeland Security Chad Wolf 
regarding the preparedness of the Department 
of Homeland Security to address a possible 
pandemic. 
On March 19th, I announced an innovative 
partnership with United Methodist Medical 
Center (UMMC) to open the first drive-through 
Coronavirus Test Screening facility in the 
Greater Houston area, which proved beneficial 
to everyone in the Greater Houston area, as 
with UMMC’s help we have opened multiple 
sites that are located within high-risk commu-
nities in the Greater Houston area, to reduce 
the need for travel to get access to COVID– 
19 testing. 
Since the start of this pandemic, I have 
sought to proactively address the critical 
issues and concerns tied to the COVID–19 
virus. 
As I stated at the beginning of this pan-
demic, We must not panic, but prepare.’’ 
I am pleased to see that this bill is not a 
panic-induced response, but a well-thought-out 
proposal to further protect our citizens. 
The COVID–19 pandemic revealed a num-
ber of challenges for public health information 
systems, but worst among them is the limited 
capacity of existing state Immunization Infor-
mation Systems. 
The importance of these systems cannot be 
understated: they allow providers to keep vac-
cines and supplies in stock, prevent over—or 
under—vaccination, remind patients when they 
are due for a recommended vaccine, and 
identify areas with low vaccination rates to en-
sure equitable distribution of vaccines. 
However, states lack modern, comprehen-
sive information systems that can meet the 
challenges of COVID–19 and future public 
health threats through the secure exchange of 
real-time immunization data. 
Consequently, many state systems strug-
gled to accommodate additional demand, im-
plement new functionalities, onboard immuni-
zation providers, support interoperable ex-
change with health care partners and enable 
timely reporting of immunization data to fed-
eral partners. 
These issues are exactly what this legisla-
tion seeks to address. 
Through H.R. 550, HHS will develop a strat-
egy and a plan to improve immunization infor-
mation systems and designate data and tech-
nology standards for use in these systems. 
Additionally, HHS will award grants to health 
departments and other government agencies 
to improve their systems contingent upon 
meeting designated standards. 
As the vaccine rollout continues and the 
time for boosters is upon us, immunization 
data systems will be a critical tool in the suc-
cess of these efforts, and they are in need of 
modernization. 
That is why I rise in ardent support of H.R. 
550, and that is why the bill has strong bipar-
tisan backing. 
Lastly, I want to thank Congresswoman 
KUSTER and Congressman BUCSHON for intro-
ducing and shepherding this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 550, 
the ‘‘Immunization Infrastructure Modernization 
Act of 2021,’’ which will improve our public 
health infrastructure and expand information- 
sharing between state and federal govern-
ments, as well as public and private health

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2685. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2685, the Understanding Cyber-
security of Mobile Networks Act. 
There is no shortage of concerning 
headlines about cybersecurity attacks 
on our critical infrastructure, includ-
ing our communications networks. The 
reports range anywhere from a hacker 
looking for users’ personal information 
to sophisticated intelligence gathering 
on U.S. officials by foreign adversaries. 
The severe nature of these attacks 
coupled with the important informa-
tion carried across wireless networks 
demands our attention. We must be 
vigilant in ensuring our networks are 
as secure as possible. That is the goal 
of H.R. 2685, the Understanding Cyber-
security of Mobile Networks Act. It 
will help us gain additional data and 
insights from experts to determine 
what more we can do to make that 
happen. 
Specifically, Mr. Speaker, the legis-
lation requires the Assistant Secretary 
of Commerce for Communications and 
Information to lead a study with the 
Department of Homeland Security. 
This study will examine the cybersecu-
rity of mobile service networks and the 
vulnerability of those networks and 
mobile devices to cyberattacks and 
surveillance by adversaries. It not only 
includes an assessment of what pro-
viders are doing to keep their networks 
secure, but also an examination of con-
sumer expectations with respect to 
network security. 
I am proud of the bipartisan work 
that the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has undertaken over the past 
several years to secure our communica-
tion networks. This is another impor-
tant step toward that effort, and I ap-
plaud 
Representatives 
ESHOO
and 
KINZINGER for their leadership on this 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues 
to support this bill, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2685, the Understanding Cyber-
security 
of 
Mobile 
Networks 
Act, 
which was introduced by Representa-
tives ESHOO and KINZINGER. 
Congress tasked the National Tele-
communications and Information Ad-
ministration with ensuring the na-
tional security of our Nation’s tele-
communications networks. In recent 
years we have seen large scale cyberse-
curity attacks that put Americans at 
risk. 
b 1600 
While mobile service providers take 
numerous steps to address vulnerabili-
ties in their networks and respond to 
threats, we know that threats to our 
mobile networks continue to exist. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has focused on securing our 
communications supply chains, and 
today we are taking another step for-
ward to understanding these chal-
lenges. This legislation requires NTIA 
to study the cybersecurity of mobile 
networks and the vulnerabilities of 
these networks and mobile devices to 
cyberattacks 
and 
surveillance 
con-
ducted by our adversaries. 
This report will not only help inform 
NTIA’s cybersecurity activities, in-
cluding its work on the Communica-
tions Supply Chain Risk Information 
Sharing Program, but will also help 
providers understand the risks their 
networks face so they can respond ap-
propriately. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ma-
jority for working with us on this leg-
islation. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port H.R. 2685, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for this legislation, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 2685, the Understanding Cy-
bersecurity of Mobile Networks Act, bipartisan 
legislation I’m proud to have authored. 
While all of us are inundated by advertise-
ments for 5G, nearly all of our calls, texts, and 
mobile data traverse through 2G, 3G, and 4G 
networks today. We’re moving toward a 5G 
world, but for the foreseeable future these 
older networks will handle most of our wireless 
communications. 
Since cellphones became common in the 
1990s, 
government 
agencies, 
academics, 
think tanks, industry associations, and inde-
pendent researchers have discovered various 
cybersecurity vulnerabilities in our wireless 
networks. Wireless network companies, mobile 
devices manufacturers, and other companies 
have 
responded 
to 
many 
of 
these 
vulnerabilities, but recent cybersecurity devel-
opments depict that vulnerabilities continue to 
exit in mobile cybersecurity. For example, 
Stingray’s cell site simulators continue to inter-
cept calls, texts, and mobile data of unwitting 
victims; SIM swaps are increasing as a means 
of identity fraud; and mobile spyware made by 
NSO Group and others has threatened the 
safety of journalists, activists, dissidents, and 
government officials around the globe. ln each 
of these instances companies have taken cer-
tain actions to mitigate threats, but we lack a 
sophisticated, 
comprehensive, 
and 
inde-
pendent assessment of what vulnerabilities 
persist, what issues have been resolved, and 
where 
mobile 
cybersecurity 
policymaking 
should be focused. 
H.R 2685 solves this lack of information. 
The legislation requires the National Tele-
communications and Information Administra-
tion (NTIA), in coordination with the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security (DHS), to conduct 
a comprehensive study on the cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities of our 2G, 3G, and 4G net-
works. 
Specifically, the study will include an as-
sessment 
of 
responses 
to 
known 
vulnerabilities and deployment of best prac-
tices; an estimate of the prevalence of effec-
tive encryption and authentication techniques,

along with a discussion of barriers to adopting 
more efficacious techniques; a discussion of 
the prevalence, costs, availability, and usage 
of cell site simulators and other surveillance 
and interception technologies. 
In addition to coordinating with DHS, the 
NTIA is required to consult the various federal 
agencies with relevant expertise, academic 
and independent researchers, multistakeholder 
and international organizations, and industry 
groups. While the report will be public, it will 
include a classified annex so details about 
vulnerabilities that could aid our adversaries 
are not publicized. 
I first introduced the Understanding Cyber-
security of Mobile Networks Act last Congress 
with Rep. ADAM KINZINGER, and I thank him for 
his continued partnership on the legislation, 
and I thank Communications and Technology 
Subcommittee Chairman DOYLE and Ranking 
Member LATTA and the Energy and Com-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4045. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4045, the FUTURE Networks 
Act. Even as we await the full deploy-
ment and utilization of fifth genera-
tion, or 5G, wireless networks, U.S. 
communications and technology com-
panies are collaborating on the next 
generation of networks; specifically, 6G 
networks. 
We may not be able to predict now 
the technological innovation that will 
come with these networks, but based 
on our Nation’s experience to this 
point, we can foresee the issues that 
will need to be addressed to get 6G net-
works off the ground. Issues like sup-
ply chain availability, security, and 
equality in deployment and adoption 
will all need to be reviewed and re-
solved; and, therefore, it is not too 
early for government and relevant 
stakeholders to begin discussing these 
issues now. That is the goal of H.R. 
4045, the FUTURE Networks Act. 
This bipartisan legislation would re-
quire the FCC to convene a task force 
to examine relevant 6G issues. The 
task force will be made up of stake-
holders from industry, public interest 
organizations, academic institutions, 
and relevant Federal, State, local, and 
Tribal Government representatives. 
Finding agreed-upon approaches and 
solutions to these issues now will make 
for a smoother transition in the future. 
I want to thank our Communications 
and Technology Subcommittee chair-
man, MIKE
DOYLE, as well as Rep-
resentatives JOHNSON and MCBATH, for 
their bipartisan leadership on this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support it today, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4045, the FUTURE Networks 
Act, which was introduced by Rep-
resentatives 
DOYLE, 
JOHNSON, 
and 
MCBATH. 
This legislation will establish a task 
force at the Federal Communications 
Commission 
to 
follow 
industry-led 
progress in the development of 6G. The 
task force will be required to publish a 
report on the status of industry-led 
standards development, possible use- 
cases of 6G technology, and how best to 
facilitate the siting and infrastructure 
deployment of 6G technology. 
While many parts of our country are 
waiting to see the new use-cases that 
5G will drive, trusted vendors—includ-
ing American companies—are leading 
the way on the fundamental aspects 
that will inform 6G. As the private sec-
tor identifies the contours of what this 
next generation of technology will look 
like, we must make sure that our regu-
latory environment will facilitate in-
vestment and innovation.

broadband like 5G and eventually 6G 
across the country through the Boost-
ing Broadband Connectivity Agenda. I 
appreciate the majority including pro-
visions in this bill to support com-
prehensive broadband deployment solu-
tions to expand connectivity and fuel 
wireless innovation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. MI-
CHAEL F. DOYLE), who is the chairman 
of our Subcommittee on Communica-
tions and Technology. 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of 
the FUTURE Networks Act, which is a 
bill that I have introduced, along with 
my 
friends, 
Representatives 
LUCY 
MCBATH and BILL JOHNSON. 
Our Nation’s wireless networks are 
constantly evolving, bringing more in-
novative services and connectivity to 
our constituents. Over my time in Con-
gress, I have watched wireless net-
works 
transform 
from 
the 
first 
iterations of digital technology to 3G, 
then 4G, and now 5G networks with 
achievable speeds well over 1 gigabit. 
While these innovations have been 
extraordinary, the benefits have not 
flowed to all Americans equally, and 
we have seen related policy issues that 
have necessitated congressional action 
and regulatory steps from the FCC. To 
ensure that all Americans benefit from 
the next generation of wireless tech-
nology, 6G, we need to be considering it 
now. 
The FUTURE Networks Act will re-
quire 
the 
Federal 
Communications 
Commission to create a 6G task force 
with members appointed by the chair 
and comprising representatives from 
trusted 
companies, 
public 
interest 
groups, and government representa-
tives at every level of government, in-
cluding Tribes. The mandate of the 
task force would be to report on pos-
sible uses, strengths, and limitations of 
6G, including any supply chain, cyber-
security, or other limitations that 
would need to be addressed as the wire-
less technology evolves. 
This bill would lay the groundwork 
for the policy considerations that will 
certainly arise, and it is good, forward- 
looking governance. 
I want to thank the cosponsors for 
their efforts on the bill, Representa-
tives LUCY MCBATH and BILL JOHNSON, 
and my bipartisan colleagues on the 
Energy and Commerce Committee for 
their input and support to strengthen 
this measure throughout the process. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support the FUTURE Net-
works Act. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
bipartisan support for this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

AMERICAN CYBERSECURITY 
LITERACY ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4055) to establish a cybersecurity 
literacy campaign, and for other pur-
poses, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4055 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-

(c) ASSISTANT SECRETARY DEFINED.—In this 
section, the term ‘‘Assistant Secretary’’ means 
the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Commu-
nications and Information. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. LATTA) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4055. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4055, the American Cybersecu-
rity 
Literacy 
Act. 
Cybersecurity 
threats targeting Americans are in-
creasingly common, particularly since 
wireless devices proliferate our society. 
H.R. 4055, the American Cybersecu-
rity Literacy Act, is intended to help 
Americans arm themselves with the in-
formation and tools they need to pre-
vent being a victim of a cyberattack. 
The bipartisan legislation requires the 
Assistant Secretary for Communica-
tions and Information to create and 
conduct a cybersecurity campaign to 
increase the knowledge and awareness 
of best practices to avoid cyberattacks. 
The bill also requires the campaign 
to, among other things, provide in-
structions about how to identify com-
mon problematic attacks like phishing 
emails and unsecure websites. The 
campaign will also highlight the bene-
fits of changing default passwords and 
encouraging the use of cybersecurity 
tools like multifactor identification 
and complex passwords. 
Finally, to ensure that as many 
Americans as possible can benefit from 
this information, the legislation re-
quires the campaign to be in as many 
languages and formats as practicable. 
This legislation will arm the Amer-
ican people with critical information 
that they need to ensure they are not 
the victim of a cyberattack. It is im-
portant to note that by passing this 
bill we are not shifting the burden of 
preventing cybersecurity attacks away 
from large, sophisticated companies 
and onto individuals. Companies still 
have the primary responsibility of pre-
venting these attacks, and there is still

adds additional layers of protection by 
giving consumers the tools and infor-
mation to protect themselves. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to applaud Rep-
resentatives 
KINZINGER, 
ESHOO, 
VEASEY, HOULAHAN, and BILIRAKIS for 
their work on this important bipar-
tisan bill that continues our work of 
protecting consumers. I urge my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4055, the American Cybersecu-
rity Literacy Act, which was intro-
duced by Representatives KINZINGER 
and ESHOO. 
The Cybersecurity Solarium Com-
mission identified cyber hygiene as a 
key challenge affecting our readiness 
as a country. As many cybersecurity 
professionals will attest, there are 
common steps that Americans can take 
to prevent disruption to networks and 
the theft of personal information. 
This legislation directs the National 
Telecommunications and Information 
Administration to establish a cyberse-
curity literacy campaign to educate 
Americans on cybersecurity risks and 
best practices to reduce those risks. By 
increasing awareness of the simple 
steps that can be taken every day, we 
can reduce cybersecurity incidents. I 
urge my colleagues to support this leg-
islation. 
Mr. Speaker, again, this is a very im-
portant piece of legislation. I have had 
about seven different cybersecurity 
events with the FBI in my district for 
my constituents. One of the things that 
they have always stressed is good hy-
giene, and over 80 percent is good hy-
giene, to prevent these cybersecurity 
attacks. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this 
legislation, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support again for the bipartisan bill, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4055, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 2355) to facilitate responsible, in-
formed dispensing of controlled sub-

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 2355. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, in April of this year, 
the Energy and Commerce Health Sub-
committee held a hearing to discuss 
the dual threat of the concurrent 
COVID–19 pandemic and the opioid 
overdose crisis. In that hearing we con-
sidered a slate of bills targeted toward 
the opioid crisis including H.R. 2355, 
the Opioid Prescription Verification 
Act of 2021. 
b 1615 
We knew then, and we know now, 
that time was ticking. Millions of 
Americans were experiencing the dead-
ly pandemic and simultaneously living 
through hard-hitting mental health 
and substance use issues. Tragically, 
we have lost over 750,000 Americans to 
COVID–19 and over 100,000 to drug 
overdoses during the pandemic. 
H.R. 2355 seeks to reduce prescription 
opioid diversion by directing HHS, 
DEA, FDA, CDC, and SAMHSA to up-
date and disseminate training mate-
rials to help pharmacists that dispense 
opioid medications verify the identity 
of the patient. To incentivize States to 
facilitate verification, the bill also au-
thorizes the CDC to prioritize certain 
grant funding to States that maintain

prescription drug monitoring programs 
and require prescribers of controlled 
substances to issue prescriptions elec-
tronically. 
Grant 
funding 
would 
also 
be 
prioritized for States that require 
pharmacists to enter certain informa-
tion about controlled substance pre-
scriptions into prescription drug moni-
toring programs, including the quan-
tity dispensed, the date filed, and the 
patient identifier. 
This bill received unanimous support 
in the Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee and is part of a series of bills 
the committee has worked on to help 
prevent diversion of opioids and reduce 
harmful opioid use. 
I would like to thank the sponsors of 
this bill and my colleagues on the com-
mittee for their steadfast work in ad-
dressing the overdose crisis. We must 
continue to work in a bipartisan fash-
ion to combat this crisis in order to 
keep our constituents safe. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2355, the Opioid Prescription 
Verification Act, a bill led by Rep-
resentative RODNEY DAVIS along with 
Representatives BILIRAKIS
and WAG-
NER. 
The opioid epidemic continues to 
devastate 
communities 
across 
the 
country. According to the CDC’s Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics, 
there were over 100,000 drug overdose 
deaths in the United States from April 
2020 to April 2021. That is a 28.5 percent 
increase from the previous year. 
The Opioid Prescription Verification 
Act directs Federal agencies to de-
velop, disseminate, and periodically 
update training materials to help phar-
macists identify and report potential 
cases of bad actors who attempt to buy 
and sell controlled substances for il-
licit use. 
The bill also incentivizes States to 
utilize prescription drug monitoring 
programs and requires certain con-
trolled substances to be prescribed 
electronically. Additionally, this bill 
includes data entry requirements that 
help reduce the potential diversion of 
prescription drugs. 
This bill will help stop criminals who 
perpetuate the vicious cycle of addic-
tion. It is a crucial step toward ending 
the opioid epidemic and making our 
communities safer. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional Members who wish to 
speak, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS), my good friend. 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I ap-
preciate very much and want to thank 
the ranking member and, of course, the 
chairman of the committee as well. I 
won’t take all of the 3 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 2355, the Opioid Prescription 
Verification Act. I want to thank my 
colleague and good friend RODNEY 
DAVIS for sponsoring this legislation, 
which I was proud to colead in the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee. 
This bill, as amended, will allow HHS 
to give grant preference to States that 
require their practitioners to transmit 
prescriptions electronically in accord-
ance with a prescription drug moni-
toring program. I can add that the 
great State of Florida does this. 
This bill expands on the work we did 
in the SUPPORT Act with Medicare’s 
prescription drug programs to help pre-
vent opioid abuse. We have a mental 
health and addiction problem in our 
Nation, Mr. Speaker, and I know the 
gentleman is aware of that. We must 
all stand together to enact meaningful 
changes to help combat this ongoing 
crisis. This bill does just that, Mr. 
Speaker, and I urge my colleagues to 
support it. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no additional speakers, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. RODNEY 
DAVIS). 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Kentucky, the Speaker pro tempore 
from Kentucky, and also my good 
friend from New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) 
for their work. I would like to thank 
Mr. PALLONE
and Ranking Member 
MCMORRIS RODGERS for allowing this 
piece of legislation to come to the 
floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 2355, the Opioid Pre-
scription Verification Act of 2021. As 
my good friend Mr. BILIRAKIS just said 
a few minutes ago, this bill builds on 
the successes in the SUPPORT for Pa-
tients and Communities Act that was 
signed into law by President Trump in 
2018. Our bill adds to this success by 
incentivizing electronic prescribing of 
opioids. 
This bill also encourages the full use 
of States’ existing prescription drug 
monitoring programs to help facilitate 
informed and responsible dispensing of 
controlled substances. 
My bill will ultimately help doctors 
and pharmacists track the prescrip-
tions a patient has received and ensure 
they cannot be altered or copied and 
used multiple times in an illicit man-
ner. This will help reduce prescription 
shopping and curb illegal sales that re-
sult in unprescribed use of opioids, 
which have tragically led to millions of 
overdose deaths. 
This idea actually came from a meet-
ing I had with local law enforcement in 
the Bloomington-Normal area in cen-
tral Illinois. I have to thank Chief 
Bleichner 
and 
also 
Sergeant 
Kapchinske for coming up with the 
idea because they had to track down 
some illicit opioid pill shoppers in 
their communities. By the time they 
figured out this group was shopping for 
opioid pills, the criminals were able to 
secure over 300 pills that would have 
been sold on the black market and 
could have added to our death tolls. 
The dramatic increase in overdoses 
during the COVID–19 pandemic has also 
shown that we must be doing more to 
prevent opioid abuse. The Opioid Pre-
scription Verification Act is an impor-
tant tool in our fight against the 
opioid epidemic. 
The original concept of this bill was 
to encourage States to implement pro-
tocols for opioid prescriptions similar 
to the federally mandated ID check on 
Sudafed-type drugs that has been in 
Federal law since 2005 because they can 
simply be used to illegally manufac-
ture deadly methamphetamines. 
While I believe a Federal mandate for 
manual checks for opioids would stop a 
significant number of bad actors, ex-
panded use of e-prescribing will be an 
important and effective tool to combat 
the abuse. 
I thank, again, Chairman PALLONE, 
Ranking Member MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
and also Ranking Member GUTHRIE; my 
good friend Mr. BILIRAKIS; and also 
Congresswoman WAGNER
for helping 
move this bill and finding this good, 
principled compromise today. I also en-
courage my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this important bill. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time as I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. Speaker, our beloved home State 
has areas that have been really af-
fected by the opioid epidemic. We also 
know that our colleagues back home 
who serve in our general assembly have 
spent an enormous amount of time try-
ing to get verification through pre-
scription programs and other programs 
moving forward. 
There is so much to do and so much 
we need to do through treatment and 
through other methods, but this is an 
important tool that will help our phar-
macists realize when people are going 
around trying to get different prescrip-
tions. 
I strongly support this bill and thank 
my friends for working on this: Rep-
resentatives 
DAVIS, 
BILIRAKIS, 
and 
WAGNER. I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
all of my colleagues, again, to support 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2355, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE) and the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New Jersey. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude any extraneous material on H.R. 
2364. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, we have hit a tragic 
milestone in our battle against the 
opioid overdose crisis. From April 2020 
to April 2021, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention estimated that 
over 100,000 people died due to drug 
overdoses, no doubt exacerbated by the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
Synthetic opioids like fentanyl and 
fentanyl analogs significantly contrib-
uted to overdose deaths. In 2019, the 
CDC estimated that more than half of 
overdose 
deaths 
involved 
synthetic 
opioids and drugs mixed with synthetic 
opioids, such as methamphetamine and 
cocaine mixed with fentanyl. 
The Energy and Commerce Com-
mittee has worked throughout the pan-
demic to address this crisis. The Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, passed and signed 
into law earlier this year, included the 
largest-ever funding boost of over $3 
billion for mental health and substance 
abuse block grants to the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration, or SAMHSA. That $3 bil-
lion in funding has gone to critical 
services for addiction treatment, pre-
vention, harm reduction, and recovery. 
H.R. 2364, the Synthetic Opioid Dan-
ger Awareness Act, provides an addi-
tional tool to address one piece of the 
opioid crisis. This bill requires the De-
partment of Health and Human Serv-
ices to launch a public education cam-
paign on the health risks associated 
with synthetic opioids and services 
available to address misuse of these 
products. Further, HHS would be re-
quired to disseminate information re-
garding synthetic opioids to healthcare 
providers. 
The bill also directs HHS to produce 
training materials for first responders 
and other professionals at a higher oc-
cupational risk of coming into contact 
with synthetic opioids. It also requires 
the agency to conduct outreach about 
the availability of these materials in 
order to help those on the front lines 
be aware of the risks associated with 
synthetic opioids. 
The bill is another step the Energy 
and Commerce Committee has taken to 
address the opioid crisis and protect 
the health and safety of our commu-
nities. The committee passed this leg-
islation with unanimous, bipartisan 
support in July. 
I want to thank my New Jersey dele-
gation colleague, Representative KIM,

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2364, the Synthetic Opioid Dan-
ger Awareness Act. Synthetic opioids, 
including fentanyl and fentanyl-related 
substances, have been the primary 
drivers of the rise in overdose deaths 
that we have seen over the past year 
and beyond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6694 
November 30, 2021 
H.R. 2364 requires the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services to imple-
ment a public education campaign re-
lated to synthetic opioids. Addition-
ally, the Secretary is required to pub-
lish a training guidance and webinar 
for first responders and other individ-
uals to better understand synthetic 
opioid exposure prevention. This cam-
paign will promote awareness around 
the dangers of synthetic opioids and 
provide information about available 
services to address synthetic opioid 
abuse. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
support for this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 2364, the ‘‘Synthetic Opioid 
Danger Awareness Act’’, which will require 
several federal agencies to provide education 
and training related to synthetic opioids, in-
cluding fentanyl and its analogues. 
The CDC reports that more than 93,000 
Americans died from drug overdoses in 2020, 
an almost 30 percent increase from 2019. 
Regardless of income, race, gender, edu-
cation, or other demographics, America’s opi-
ate problem has morphed into a full-blown 
public health crisis. 
Synthetic opioids contribute greatly to this 
drug crisis and are a serious threat to fire 
fighters and emergency medical responders 
who are susceptible to encountering these 
deadly substances. 
Increased rates of opiate usage impact the 
types and volume of calls the fire service re-
sponds to and the dangers they encounter 
when they arrive on the scene, both of which 
stretch already limited resources even thinner. 
A 2021 Statista study found that nearly two- 
thirds of all fire department responses are for 
medical aid. 
When firefighters or EMS personnel come in 
contact with opioids—either through direct 
contact or secondary contamination—this cre-
ates a unique, and often unknown, risk for 
these individuals because many opioids can 
be ingested either by skin contact (namely 
fentanyl) or via inhalation, making it chal-
lenging to help the victim. 
Firefighters must be properly trained on how 
to safely respond to these life-threatening 
emergencies in a way that both helps the vic-
tim and minimizes risk to their health and 
safety. 
The Synthetic Opioid Danger Awareness 
Act would require the National Institute for Oc-
cupational Safety and Health to produce train-
ing materials to prevent exposure to synthetic 
opioids for first responders and others who are 
at high risk of exposure. 
In addition, the Substance Abuse and Men-
tal Health Services Administration will be re-
quired to disseminate the mentioned training 
materials to ambulance transport personnel, 
local sheriff deputies, and other first respond-
ers and individuals in high-risk occupations. 
H.R. 2364 would also direct the CDC to 
conduct a public education campaign that 
raises public awareness of the dangers of syn-
thetic opioids and explains the services avail-
able, with respect to opioid treatment. 
The health of American citizens is one of 
the most pressing issues facing this country. 
Continuing education on fentanyl and syn-
thetic opioids is essential for ensuring the 
health and safety of fire fighters and para-
medics. 
Passing 
the 
Synthetic 
Opioid 
Danger 
Awareness Act is a step towards ensuring the 
health and wellness of American citizens and 
reducing the impact synthetic opioids impose 
on American communities. 
I urge my colleagues to pass this bill and I 
thank Congressman ANDY KIM for introducing 
such an important piece of legislation. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3743. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3743, the Supporting the Foun-
dation for the National Institutes of 
Health and the Reagan-Udall Founda-
tion for the Food and Drug Administra-
tion Act. 
The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the 
FDA is an independent nonprofit orga-
nization established by Congress in 2007 
to advance the mission of the FDA to 
modernize medical product develop-
ment, accelerate innovation, and en-
hance safety. 
Likewise, the Foundation for the NIH 
is an independent nonprofit organiza-
tion established by Congress in 1990 to 
develop 
private-public 
partnerships 
that advance biomedical research, do-
mestically and globally. 
Both organizations work to advance 
the missions of the NIH and the FDA 
and have played important roles in our 
Nation’s fight against COVID–19. For 
example, the Foundation for the NIH 
has worked to coordinate the ACTIV 
program that is strategizing our re-
search and prioritizing and speeding 
development of the most promising 
COVID–19 
vaccines 
and 
treatment. 
Likewise, the Reagan-Udall Founda-
tion’s COVID–19 Diagnostics Evidence 
Accelerator has brought stakeholders 
together to collect and evaluate real- 
world data in a way that is scientif-
ically useful and meets the FDA stand-
ards so we can understand the efficacy 
of COVID–19 diagnostics in the real 
world. 
Mr. Speaker, the FDA and the NIH 
are currently authorized to transfer 
funding to their respective foundations 
within a statutory limit that has not 
been increased since 2007. 
H.R. 3743 would increase the transfer 
authority for both foundations from up 
to $1.25 million to up to $5 million. 
This legislation will allow the agencies 
to increase their support consistent 
with the increasing costs of medical 
product research and development. 
This bipartisan bill received unani-
mous support in the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. I would like to 
thank my colleagues, Representative 
HUDSON
and 
Health 
Subcommittee 
Chairwoman ESHOO, for their out-
standing leadership on this legislation.

November 30, 2021 
Health and the Reagan-Udall Founda-
tion for the Food and Drug Administra-
tion Act, led by my Energy and Com-
merce 
Committee 
colleagues, 
Rep-
resentative HUDSON and Representative 
ESHOO. 
Empowering biomedical innovation 
in the United States is critical to pro-
tecting our global competitiveness. We 
saw how important it was to invest in 
creating new treatments during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, and we need to 
carry that momentum into the future. 
H.R. 3743 authorizes increased trans-
fer authorities from the FDA and the 
NIH to both the Reagan-Udall Founda-
tion and the Foundation for the NIH, 
respectively. 
Allowing FDA and NIH to provide in-
creased funding to these public-private 
partnerships will give the Reagan- 
Udall Foundation and the Foundation 
for the NIH more flexibility to meet 
the growing research demands and to 
ultimately accelerate future medical 
innovations. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no Members who wish to speak at this 
time, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
as much time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. HUDSON). 
Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 3743, Supporting the 
Foundation 
for 
the 
NIH 
and 
the 
Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA 
Act. 
I introduced this bipartisan bill along 
with my friend, Chairwoman ANNA 
ESHOO, to build on our success of pub-
lic-private partnerships that have pro-
duced 
lifesaving 
medical 
break-
throughs. 
The Foundation for the NIH and the 
Reagan-Udall Foundation were created 
by Congress to support the NIH and the 
FDA by forging partnerships between 
the Federal Government and private 
industry experts. 
Providing additional support to these 
organizations would further accelerate 
research into novel vaccines, thera-
peutics, diagnostics, and other innova-
tions, helping us prepare for future 
emergencies. 
Due to partnerships such as these, we 
have already seen the success of the 
ACTIV program in speeding develop-
ments of COVID–19 vaccines and treat-
ments. 
It should be noted that we would not 
be where we are today without the in-
novation 
seen 
in 
Operation 
Warp 
Speed. This public-private partnership 
has not received the credit it deserves 
for creating, developing, and manufac-
turing life-saving vaccines in record 
time. 
Through my legislation, we can build 
on these successes and enhance part-
nerships across the healthcare indus-
try. 
I 
thank 
Chairman 
PALLONE
and 
Ranking Member GUTHRIE
for their 
support, and I urge my colleagues to

may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3894. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there

tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, environmental factors 
can have a tremendous effect on an in-
dividual’s health. Where a person lives, 
their level of education, their food se-
curity, and many other aspects of a 
person’s life, can affect their health 
and well-being. These are often called 
the social determinants of health. 
Healthcare providers and insurance 
plans are looking more and more at ad-
dressing some of these social deter-
minants in order to improve individual 
health. State Medicaid programs have 
been especially engaged on this front. 
Unfortunately, it can sometimes be 
difficult for States and insurance plans 
to understand the various authorities 
available in Medicaid to address the so-
cial determinants of health. Likewise, 
it can also be difficult to see how other 
States are using those authorities in 
creative new ways. 
H.R. 3894, the Collecting and Ana-
lyzing Resources Integral and Nec-
essary for Guidance for Social Deter-
minants Act, will give States a valu-
able new resource to ensure that they 
are able to use Medicaid to the fullest 
extent possible. 
H.R. 3894 will ensure that the Centers 
for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
regularly 
updates 
its 
guidance 
to 
States on how they can use Medicaid to 
address the social determinants of 
health. It will also require CMS to pro-
vide examples of how other States are 
using Medicaid to address the social 
and environmental factors that can af-
fect people’s health.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6696 
November 30, 2021 
Representatives BLUNT ROCHESTER and 
BILIRAKIS. 
Research shows that socioeconomic 
conditions, such as job loss, lack of 
transportation, 
inadequate 
housing, 
among others, can contribute to poor 
health outcomes. 
The Trump administration took a 
key step at the beginning of this year 
by releasing guidance to States on how 
to better utilize Medicaid to support 
social determinants of health. It pro-
vided real-world examples that States 
are taking to improve outcomes for 
beneficiaries. 
For example, Medicaid managed care 
plans in my home State of Kentucky 
are leading the way by using care coor-
dinators to connect vulnerable bene-
ficiaries to social support services like 
food pantries and daycare services. 
The CARING for Social Determinants 
Act would require HHS to update this 
guidance every 3 years in order to drive 
future innovation in State Medicaid 
programs. 
I am proud of the important steps 
this bill takes to improve health out-
comes for some of our most vulnerable 
populations. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this bill, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no Members who wish to speak, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield

RAKIS). 
Mr. 
BILIRAKIS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the ranking member and the 
chairman of the committee and, of 
course, the ranking member of the full 
committee, CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
for their work on this bill. 
I am honored to be here today to 
speak in support of H.R. 3894 and would 
like to thank my colleague and friend, 
Representative BLUNT ROCHESTER, for 
sponsoring this important piece of leg-
islation. This is a really good bill. 
I also want to thank my esteemed 
colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee for their continued 
bipartisan efforts to benefit American 
patients 
under 
innovative 
delivery 
models through increased data. 
The CARING for Social Determinants 
Act, which I proudly co-lead, would 
provide routine guidance and strategies 
to States to address the social deter-
minants of health under the Medicaid 
and the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program, or CHIP program. 
This bill also solidifies States’ au-
thority to continue innovative waiver 
payment models, which consequently 
improves 
Medicaid 
beneficiaries’ 
health outcomes. 
This is really a great bill, Mr. Speak-
er, and I want to thank the chairman. 
We truly do work in a bipartisan fash-
ion in this committee, in most cases. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in support of this bill.

revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 4026.

There was no objection. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, social determinants, or 
social drivers, of health affect every 
single person in our communities. They 
are aspects of our daily living, such as 
the conditions in the places where we 
live, learn, work, and play, which can 
positively or negatively affect a wide 
range of health risks and outcomes. 
Through our healthcare system, so-
cial determinants of health are being 
examined as part of a holistic view of a 
person’s healthcare. 
A noted example was highlighted by 
The New England Journal of Medicine 
linking the loop that determinants can 
play throughout a person’s life. Poor 
health or lack of education can impact 
employment opportunities which, in 
turn, constrains income. Low incomes 
reduce access to healthcare and nutri-
tious food and overall increase hard-
ship. Hardship causes stress which, in 
turn, promotes unhealthy coping mech-
anisms, such as substance abuse and 
poor nutrition choices. And poor nutri-
tion increases risk factors for heart 
disease, obesity, and diabetes. 
When not given an equal opportunity 
to thrive, these social factors can com-
pound and snowball to negatively im-
pact a person and their community. 
Fortunately, States are becoming inno-
vative in addressing social needs in the 
communities to improve health and de-
crease costs. 
b 1645 
Today, we are taking another step in 
the right direction by considering H.R. 
4026, the Social Determinants of Health 
Data Analysis Act of 2021. This bipar-
tisan legislation requires a report on 
programs undertaken by the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services to 
address social determinants of health. 
The report would include recommenda-
tions to foster private-public partner-
ships and include an analysis of pri-
vacy measures as part of social deter-
minants of health data collection. 
The report and research, Mr. Speak-
er, will help inform our future work on 
social determinants, and, therefore, it 
is important that we pass this bill. 
I urge my colleagues to support the 
legislation, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4026, the Social Determinants 
of Health Data Analysis Act of 2021, led 
by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS) and the gentlewoman from Dela-
ware (Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER), my En-
ergy and Commerce Committee col-
leagues.

can drive health outcomes. These de-
terminants are not routinely collected 
or utilized by healthcare providers to 
help address patients’ health condi-
tions and improve their quality of life. 
The Social Determinants of Health 
Data Analysis Act requires the GAO to 
submit a report to Congress on existing 
actions taken by the Department of 
Health and Human Services to address 
social determinants of health. This leg-
islation would, therefore, allow us to 
better understand existing Federal ini-
tiatives to address social determinants 
of health. 
It will also inform us of potential fu-
ture interventions that would be most 
effective in fully addressing these 
needs in our communities. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
prepared to close. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
PALLONE) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4026. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR 
OF THOSE WHO SUFFERED IN 
THE 
VIOLENCE 
AT 
THE 
WAUKESHA CHRISTMAS PARADE 
ON NOVEMBER 21, 2021 
(Mr. FITZGERALD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, 
I am joined by my colleagues, Con-
gressman KIND, Congressman POCAN, 
Congressman STEIL, and Congressman 
GROTHMAN. We are from Wisconsin, and 
we are here to request a moment of si-
lence and pay respects to those who 
suffered in the senseless violence at the 
Waukesha Christmas parade last week 
on November 21, 2021. 
The attack left a devastating impact 
on our friends and our neighbors in the 
community. Anyone who regularly at-
tends the Waukesha Christmas parade 
will tell you how joyous a celebration 
this parade typically is. It brings the 
community together. 
It is then inconceivable that an indi-
vidual would shatter lives and uproot 
our community in this horrific way. 
We are grateful for the firefighters, 
police 
officers, 
healthcare 
profes-
sionals, and volunteers who imme-
diately answered the call for help that 
evening and who continue to help those 
who remain in serious condition. 
I know the people of Waukesha; they 
are tough and kind. I know that we will 
get through this unspeakable difficulty 
together as a community. I pray for 
healing and peace for all those who 
were affected. May love and strength 
lead us forward in the face of this evil. 
Madam Speaker, I would ask my col-
leagues to join me in observing a mo-
ment of silence in honor of Virginia 
Sorenson, 
Leanna 
Owen, 
Tamara 
Durand, Wilhelm Hospel, Jane Kulich, 
and Jackson Sparks, as well as those 
still in critical condition and those suf-
fering from trauma following this trag-
edy. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House 
observe a moment of silence.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1440 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
hereby remove myself as a cosponsor of 
H.R. 1440. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BUSH). The gentleman’s request is ac-
cepted.

HONORING CHIEF MASTER 
SERGEANT RONNIE McGHEE 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to honor Chief Master Sergeant 
Ronnie McGhee as Tennessee’s Second 
District’s Veteran of the Month. He 
served in the Air National Guard dur-
ing the Gulf war. 
Chief Master Sergeant McGhee was 
born and raised in Anderson County, 
Tennessee, and graduated from Oliver 
Springs High School in 1963. Two years 
later, he enlisted in the Air National 
Guard and joined the 119th Aircraft 
Warning and Control Squadron as an 
administration 
specialist 
and 
per-
sonnel specialist. When the 228th Com-
bat Communication Squadron opened 
at the Tyson Air National Guard Base 
in Alcoa, he joined them as the com-
munications training manager. 
In 
1990, 
Chief 
Master 
Sergeant 
McGhee volunteered to go with the 
228th when it was deployed to Qatar in 
support of the Gulf war. While he was 
there, he participated in Operation 
Desert Shield and Operation Desert 
Storm. 
Following his time in Qatar, he was 
deployed to Germany and Italy before 
settling in Nashville where he served as 
the command chief at State head-
quarters. After more than 37 years of 
military service, he retired in 2002. 
Our country’s heroes are the men and 
women of our Armed Forces, Madam 
Speaker, not famous musicians, not 
athletes, and not actors. I am grateful 
to Chief Master Sergeant McGhee for 
his service and sacrifice to our great 
country.

REMEMBERING ROBERT JOSEPH 
‘‘JOE’’ ALLEN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Joe Allen from Folkston, Geor-
gia, who sadly passed away on Novem-
ber 13 at the age of 74. After graduating 
from Charlton County High School in 
1965, Joe earned a bachelor of science 
in forestry at the University of Geor-
gia. 
Following his graduation, Joe began 
a successful career in the forestry and 
logging industry where he served as a 
strong advocate for the industry in 
southeast Georgia. During his time as 
the executive director of Southeastern 
Wood Producers, Joe played a vital role 
in shaping legislation that benefited 
loggers throughout the United States. 
A faithful member of the First Baptist 
Church of Folkston, Joe served as head 
deacon and a dedicated Sunday school 
teacher. 
Known as a reliable friend with ex-
ceptional character and unwavering 
faith, Joe’s service to his community is 
truly remarkable. I am grateful for 
Joe’s service, and I know his memory 
will always be cherished. 
My thoughts and prayers are with all 
who knew him during this most dif-
ficult time.

RECOGNIZING AMY BREWER ON 
HER RETIREMENT 
(Mr. CHABOT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
this evening to recognize and thank for 
her 32 years of public service, Lebanon, 
Ohio’s, retiring mayor, Amy Brewer. 
I had the pleasure of working with 
Amy on issues both large and small for 
10 years now since Lebanon became 
part of my congressional district. 
Mayor Brewer has been a tireless ad-
vocate for all things Lebanon since she 
was first elected to city council there 
in 1989. After serving on council for 12 
years, she was elected mayor and has 
served in that capacity for the last 20 
years.

Anyone who knows Amy knows that 
she is a bundle of energy and that she 
puts that enthusiasm to work for the 
people of, in my opinion, one of the 
most picturesque, welcoming, and fam-
ily-oriented communities not only in 
Ohio, but in America. 
Although saddened by Amy’s retire-
ment, the citizens of Lebanon have 
benefited in so many ways from her 
leadership, from the overall quality of 
life to improvements in the downtown 
landscape. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mayor 
Brewer for sharing the last 32 years of 
her remarkable life with the good peo-
ple of Lebanon, Ohio.

TEXAS 24 HOMETOWN HERO OF 
THE WEEK, JEFF SPIVEY 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor our Texas 24 Home-
town Hero of the Week, my hometown 
hero, Irving Chief of Police, Jeff 
Spivey. 
Chief Spivey will be retiring this 
year after selflessly serving our com-
munity 
for 
35 
years 
working 
to 
strengthen community relations and 
serving in roles from patrol to criminal 
investigation. Irving is a better, safer 
city because of his dedication. He pio-
neered peer support services, formed a 
mental health response unit, and led a 
departmental reorganization. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank 
Chief 
Spivey for his service and the lasting 
impact he has made on our community.

RECOGNIZING THE 100TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF TEXAS SCOTTISH RITE 
FOR CHILDREN 
(Mr. TAYLOR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize and celebrate the Texas 
Scottish Rite for Children on their 100 
years of pediatric orthopedic excel-
lence. 
Founded by a group of Texas Masons, 
Scottish Rite for Children first opened 
its doors on October 10, 1921, with the 
mission of providing free medical care 
to children with polio. 
The success of the hospital would not 
have been possible without the help of 
volunteers, staff members, friends, and 
others who have a shared commitment 
to improving the lives of the children 
they serve. 
Consistently recognized as a top-per-
forming children’s hospital, it is no 
surprise Scottish Rite has been consist-
ently ranked among the top orthopedic 
programs in the Nation. 
Now as we recognize Scottish Rite 
for Children on this milestone occa-
sion, I ask my colleagues in the House 
of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring 100 years of exemplary care and 
innovation. 
RESPECTING THE DIGNITY OF THE 
UNBORN 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, as 
the Supreme Court hears oral argu-
ments in the case of Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization, I stand 
before the House to proclaim strongly 
my commitment to being pro-life. 
Three years ago Mississippi passed a 
law by an overwhelming majority to 
limit abortions after 15 weeks of preg-
nancy with reasonable exceptions. The 
State legislature and then-Governor 
Phil Bryant supported this bill to pro-
tect the life of mothers and the dignity 
of the unborn. Abortion precedents es-
tablished in Roe v. Wade and Planned 
Parenthood v. Casey have prevented 
States from passing laws to protect un-
born babies before viability—the age at 
which a child could survive outside the 
womb. 
Medical 
advancements 
like 
ultrasounds 
and 
prenatal 
surgeries 
have shown the humanity of the un-
born which points to the value of life 
from the moment of conception. Un-
born babies have a heartbeat as early 
as 5 weeks, and by 15 weeks they can 
taste, make facial expressions, and, of 
course, feel pain. 
Confronted by a culture that con-
tinues to take human lives for granted, 
I applaud the State of Mississippi for 
their pro-life stance and their chal-
lenge of outdated precedent that pre-
vents protections for the unborn. 
Madam Speaker, I will always stand 
for life. 
f 
OUTRAGEOUS SPEECH 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I have been in the House for a very 
long time, and I have grown to love the 
dignity, the power, and the respect of 
this body, not for individuals but for 
the respect of the United States of 
America. 
On November 17, 2021, a Member of 
the House from Colorado called an-
other Member the jihad squad member 
from Minnesota. These words have con-
tinued on. It is in the CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD. It was when we were leaving 
for a beautiful reflection of thanks-
giving. So the words were not pulled 
down. 
Over the past couple of days, it has 
been one attack after another, such as 
in an elevator: I thought this person, 
this Member from Minnesota, was a 
terrorist. 
Don’t we understand that the world 
watches this body? 
Besides those words having needed to 
be taken down, and they were not at 
that time, the world wonders: Is Amer-
ica viewing the more than 1 billion- 
plus Muslims around the world, obvi-
ously, every one as terrorists; the 
mothers and fathers, the doctors and 
lawyers, the countries that we seek to 
interact with, to collaborate with, and 
to be developing into democracies 
those that are not? 
It is outrageous when we use this 
place with such discourse or when we 
have a medical doctor who says the 
Omicron is used by Democrats. It is 
outrageous. 
Let us act as if God we trust, and let 
us act as if there is dignity in this 
place. Let us act as if we are leaders for 
the world.

NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. LAMBORN) is recognized for 60 
minutes as the designee of the minor-
ity leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Madam Speaker, before I begin, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous materials on the 
topic of this Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Colorado? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, in 
1941, President Franklin Delano Roo-
sevelt declared the week of Thanks-
giving to be National Bible Week. 
While facing a world entering a great 
war and a nation exiting a Great De-
pression, FDR led us to recognize that 
the Bible is a foundational building 
block 
of 
Western 
Civilization—the 
Judeo-Christian heritage. 
The ideas and principles that shaped 
the thinking of America’s foundation 
and Founding Fathers were found in 
the Bible. Today, 80 years later, we cel-
ebrate a book that is no less relevant 
and foundational than it was in 1941, or 
1776, or 2,000 years ago. 
Amidst worldwide pandemics that 
have shaken the foundations of edu-
cation, economy, healthcare, and every 
other source of personal and national 
security instability, we find that the 
Bible stands as the only foundation 
that can never be shaken. 
At the end of the Sermon on the 
Mount, Jesus said: 
Therefore whoever hears these sayings of 
mine and does them, I will liken him to a 
wise man who built his house on the rock: 
and the rain descended, the floods came, and 
the winds came and beat on that house and 
it did not fall for it was founded on the rock. 
It is a great honor for me to come to 
the House floor tonight to commemo-
rate National Bible Week. I am so 
thankful and blessed to live in a coun-
try where we have the freedom to wor-
ship and read the holy Scriptures with-
out fear. Many people across the globe 
live in countries where such freedoms 
do not exist. Our very Declaration of 
Independence confesses God’s truth 
that is self-evident:

November 30, 2021 
We hold these truths to be self-evident, 
that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these are life, 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
As a personal testimony for myself, 
the Bible has had a profound impact on 
my life and my family as it has on mil-
lions of Americans and people all over 
the world. 
b 1945 
God’s Word is so valuable to me be-
cause it has shaped my thinking and 
deeply influenced my relationship with 
God. The Bible has, indeed, been a 
source of guidance, wisdom, joy, and 
light in every area of my life. I agree 
with what King David said: ‘‘O, how I 
love Your law. It is my meditation all 
the day.’’ 
In this hour, we will hear Members of 
Congress from various faith traditions 
and denominations and from all over 
the United States speak about what 
the Bible means to them and their con-
stituents. We are here, in keeping with 
tradition, to recognize National Bible 
Week. 
I would first like to yield to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Missouri 
(Mrs. 
HARTZLER), my good friend and inspira-
tion to so many of us. 
Mrs. HARTZLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for holding this 
Special Order tonight so that we can 
recognize the book that means so much 
to many of us and certainly our Na-
tion, and that is the Bible. We are 
blessed to live in a nation that is 
founded on the truths of the Bible. 
Many people don’t know this, but of 
the 56 men who signed the Declaration 
of Independence, nearly half held semi-
nary or Bible school degrees. These 
Founders had a very deep religious con-
viction and faith in Jesus Christ, and it 
was based on the Bible. 
The 
following 
quotes 
from 
our 
Founding Fathers provide a window 
into the strong moral and spiritual 
convictions which helped form the 
foundations of our nation and our gov-
ernment. 
George Washington, our first Presi-
dent said: ‘‘While we are zealously per-
forming the duties of good citizens and 
soldiers, we certainly ought not to be 
inattentive to the higher duties of reli-
gion. To the distinguished character of 
patriot, it should be our highest glory 
to add the more distinguished char-
acter of Christian.’’ That was George 
Washington. 
John Quincy Adams was our sixth 
President, and he said: 
In the chain of human events, the birthday 
of the Nation is indissolubly linked with the 
birthday of the Savior. The Declaration of 
Independence laid the cornerstone of human 
government upon the first precepts of Chris-
tianity. 
That is very clearly saying that our 
Nation was founded on Christianity 
and the Bible. 
And our fourth President, James 
Madison, recorded 10 different ref-
erences to Scripture at the Constitu-
tional Convention, which was the piv-
otal event in our Nation’s history that 
codified our freedom and our God-given 
rights. So, our Founders quoted Scrip-
ture. 
Like the Constitution that it in-
spired, the Bible is timeless and im-
pacts us still today. The Bible is the in-
spired Word of God. 
I started reading the Bible every day 
at age 13. I went to Youth for Christ 
camp and learned that this was a great 
opportunity to have God be able to 
speak to you every day and to start 
your day. 
It has been a source of encourage-
ment when I was down, a source of 
guidance when I needed direction, and 
a source of comfort during life’s strug-
gles. The Bible speaks to every situa-
tion that people encounter, and it 
shows the path to blessings. 
Psalm 33:12 is really relevant today. 
It says: ‘‘Blessed is the nation whose 
God is the Lord.’’ Powerful for us to re-
member that. 
Psalm 1 says: 
Blessed is the one who does not walk in 
step with the wicked or stand in the way 
that sinners take or sit in the company of 
mockers, but whose delight is in the law of 
the Lord and who meditates on it day and 
night. That person is like a tree planted by 
the streams of water which shields its fruit 
and season and whose leaf does not wither. 
Whatever they do prospers. 
Good words. But the Bible also tells 
us the good news that we celebrate this 
season. 
Luke 2 says: 
But the angel said to them, ‘‘Do not be 
afraid. I bring you good news that will cause 
great joy for all the people. Today in the 
town of David a savior has been born to you. 
He is the Messiah, the Lord.’’ 
And the greatest news of all is sum-
marized in John 3:16–17: 
For God so loved the world that He gave 
His one and only Son, that whoever believes 
in Him shall not perish but have eternal life. 
For God did not send His Son into the world 
to condemn it but to save the world through 
him. 
So as we commemorate this National 
Bible Week, I would encourage all of us 
to pick up that Bible, dust it off, or 
download an app on your phone, read 
it, and receive the blessing it contains 
for us as individuals and as a nation. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Missouri 
for her comments. 
I yield to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. BABIN), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to thank my good friend from Col-
orado (Mr. LAMBORN) for having this 
Special Order. 
Madam Speaker, it is my great honor 
to stand in this sacred Chamber each 
year during National Bible Week to ex-
press the importance of a book that 
has influenced my life more than any 
other. Without a doubt and without 
fault, the Bible has been my comfort in 
sorrow, my counsel in decisionmaking, 
and my unwavering companion in day- 
to-day life. 
From running my dental practice to 
raising my family to serving the good 
people of Texas’ 36th Congressional 
District, God’s Word has always been 
the central hub that everything else re-
volves around, and it continues to mold 
and shape my life for the better each 
day. 
But the Scripture’s reach is much 
further than the life of one Texas Con-
gressman. If you take a single glance 
at a U.S. history book, you will see its 
footprint immediately. During our Na-
tion’s birth, the Bible was perhaps the 
most accessible book to our Founding 
Fathers, and in its pages, they learned 
valuable insights about human nature, 
civic virtue, and the rights of our citi-
zens. 
Biblical influence can also be seen in 
our founding documents, including the 
Declaration of Independence, which 
states that ‘‘all men are created equal, 
that they are all endowed by their cre-
ator with certain unalienable rights.’’ 
We are living in uncertain and per-
ilous times, and I pray daily that we as 
a country find our way back to the 
teachings of the Scripture. May we 
never forget that it was God’s divine 
providence and written word that pro-
vided the fortitude to those responsible 
for creating this grand experiment of 
America. 
Keeping His hand in all we do is the 
only way that we can preserve it. I will 
close with one of my favorite passages 
of encouragement and hope and life ev-
erlasting from the Bible, Job 19:25–27: 
For I know that my redeemer lives, and He 
shall stand at last on the Earth. And after 
my skin is destroyed, this I know, that in my 
flesh, I shall see God whom I shall see for 
myself. And my eyes shall behold Him and 
not another. How my heart yearns within 
me. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
Here we are in the Halls of Congress, 
and many things have happened here 
over the years. When you look back on 
what our country was like at the 
founding of our country, some things 
have changed. Many of the early Amer-
ican settlers came to the New World 
with the expressed purpose of living 
out their life with faith in God and His 
Word, according to their own con-
sciences. One of Congress’ first acts in 
the infancy of our Nation was the au-
thorization of an American-published 
Bible. 
The Revolutionary War with the 
British had cut off a lot of shipments of 
Bibles from England, and there was a 
shortage. So in 1782, Congress passed 
this resolution: ‘‘Resolved, that the 
United States in Congress assembled 
highly approve the pious and laudable 
undertaking of Mr. Aitken, as subser-
vient to the interest of religion, as well 
as an instance of the progress of arts in 
this country, and being satisfied from 
the above report of his care and accu-
racy in the execution of the work, they 
recommend this edition of the Bible to 
the inhabitants of the United States, 
and hereby authorize him to publish 
this recommendation in the manner he 
shall think proper.’’

Boy, can you imagine doing that 
today, the House of Representatives 
approving the printing of the Bible? 
Our country has changed over the 
years and not always necessarily for 
the better. 
Madam Speaker, I now yield to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of Na-
tional Bible Week and in celebration of 
my faith and of our Lord and Savior, 
Jesus Christ, the living God. 
Last week, we got to spend time with 
our families as we celebrated the 
Thanksgiving holiday, and I was able 
to use that time for reflection. Re-
cently, my family had the privilege of 
welcoming our sixth grandchild into 
the family. On October 28, Mary Emma 
Carter was born. 
Psalm 127:3 tells us that ‘‘children 
are a gift from the Lord; they are re-
ward from Him.’’

time 
with 
my 
grand-
children is my opportunity for me to 
witness true innocence, untouched by 
the evils of the world, as well as uncon-
ditional love. In moments such as 
these, we are reconnected with the true 
beauty and splendor of our Lord in His 
grand design. 
In Matthew 19:14, Jesus tells an audi-
ence: ‘‘Let the little children come to 
me and do not hinder them, for the 
Kingdom of Heaven belongs to such as 
these.’’ 
We are called to love one another as 
children do, to emulate this mindset, 
especially when it is difficult to do so. 
This past year has been difficult for 
many Americans. In this time of strug-
gle, discourse, and many disagree-
ments, I find comfort in the Bible, 
which serves as a reminder of God’s 
love for all of His children. It is this 
love that guided our Nation through 
the darkest days of the pandemic, 
where nurses and doctors selflessly sac-
rificed their own safety for their neigh-
bor’s health and protection. 
It is this love that drives our men 
and women in blue to risk their lives to 
defend, to protect ourselves and others. 
And it is this love that will fill our 
homes this Christmas as we gather to 
celebrate the Savior of the world and 
His ultimate sacrifice for our salva-
tion. Mary Margaret, Adalay, Chris-
topher, Bennett, Catherine, and Mary 
Emma, I love you, your Mamie loves 
you, and God loves you. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his comments. 
I now yield to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. 
JOHNSON 
of 
Ohio. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
The Bible, wow, what a book. You 
know, Billy Graham said in the 1950s in 
one of his early books called ‘‘Peace 
with God,’’ he said: 
There is one thing that has never changed 
since day one of creation. The truth has al-
ways been the truth, and it always will be. 
There is only one place to go to find that 
truth, and that is in God’s Holy Word, the 
Bible. 
You know, I think our Founders un-
derstood that nearly 2,000 years before 
Billy Graham ever spoke those words 
on the floor of the Constitutional Con-
vention. Benjamin Franklin, in a mo-
ment of frustration because they were 
at an impasse trying to write the Con-
stitution of the United States, brought 
focus to what was happening on the 
Convention floor. He was recognized by 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Convention, 
George Washington, and he stood up 
and said these words: 
I have lived long, sir, and the longer I live 
and the more I see, the more convincing 
proof I see of this truth that God deals in the 
affairs of men. And if a sparrow can’t fall 
from the sky without His notice, how do we 
think it probable that an empire can rise 
without His aid? 
Other Founders understood where the 
truth was to be found. John Adams 
went on to say: 
The Constitution of the United States is a 
document designed to govern a moral and re-
ligious people, and it is wholly inadequate 
for any other. 
I believe that is because our Found-
ers understood that to be a self-gov-
erning people, we had to be grounded in 
our faith. We had to be self-responsible 
people and that there were no more 
self-responsible people on the planet 
than those who lived by the truth con-
tained in the Scriptures. 
My prayer for our country and for 
each of us today is that we would live 
by the prayer that Paul prayed to the 
church in Ephesus: 
That God would send His Holy Spirit to 
give us His wisdom and His revelation that 
we might know Him better because it is only 
knowing God better that we can understand 
the truths that lie in that precious book, the 
Bible. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, and I yield to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. GOOD). 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Congressman LAMBORN for 
doing this very important work that 
we are doing here tonight. 
As a born-again Christian, I am 
proud to let everyone know that the 
most important thing in my life is my 
faith. When I ran for Congress a year 
ago, I identified as a Biblical and con-
stitutional conservative and was told I 
was too conservative to win. I start 
each day very early in the morning—I 
am a 4:30 riser—with 30 minutes in 
God’s Word before I spend my time in 
prayer from there. 
b 2000 
Why did FDR declare it National 
Bible Week 80 years ago on the eve of 
the entrance of the U.S. into the great-
est existential crisis that it would ever 
face, World War II? 
Because the Bible is the source of all 
truth, containing God’s complete rev-
elation of all that He wanted us to 
know, everything pertaining to this 
life and next. 
There is a reason why it is the num-
ber one, all-time best seller, with far 
more 
original 
manuscript 
evidence 
than any publication in human history, 
despite the efforts by oppressive re-
gimes to try to ban it and stamp it out. 
The Bible is God’s love letter to us. 
The Bible is God’s guidebook to us on 
how to live. The Bible is our map on 
how to get to heaven and how to have 
eternal life. It contains the Gospel, the 
good news of Jesus Christ and His 
death and resurrection that makes sal-
vation possible. 
It is the Bible that tells us that we 
are created in God’s image, male and 
female, that He knows us in the womb, 
even before our mother knows we are 
there, and He has unique plans for each 
one of us. 
It is the Bible that tells us of God’s 
laws and design for morality, for mar-
riage, for the family, the very founda-
tions of our society. 
Having been written between 2,000 
and 4,000 years ago, the Bible is still 
the tool that God uses to change lives 
today. It contains a story of a man 
named Jesus, born 2,000 years ago, who 
had no formal education, never trav-
eled more than a few miles from His 
hometown, never held public office, 
had no media or social media to help 
Him get His message out, and was exe-
cuted at age 33 after 3 short years of 
public ministry. 
He had a small group of disciples, all 
of whom were martyred for their faith 
and their personal witness to what 
they saw Him do, including His res-
urrection from the dead. 
And this Jesus has hundreds of mil-
lions of followers around the world 
today because they were introduced to 
Him through the Bible, God’s Holy 
Word. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, if 
you go to the discoveries that arche-
ology has made over the years, they 
have always validated Biblical ac-
counts. 
Time and time again, Biblical per-
sonalities, locations, and events actu-
ally existed in time and space as prov-
en by archeology. 
Claims by some critics that a Bib-
lical statement was simply made up 
have always been debunked by later 
discoveries, many more times than we 
could cite here tonight. 
For instance, the Dead Sea Scrolls 
proved the credibility and authority of 
Scriptures. Jewish archeologist Nelson 
Glueck has said: ‘‘It may be stated cat-
egorically that no archaeological dis-
covery has ever controverted,’’ or con-
tradicted, ‘‘a Biblical reference.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I now yield to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
John Adams said that the Constitution 
was made only for a moral and reli-
gious people and totally unfit for any 
other kind. 
How are we to know what John 
Adams meant by a ‘‘moral and reli-
gious people’’? 
In the 1600s, Massachusetts school 
children were required to study the 
Bible. I don’t think this was unusual 
for people who lived prior to the time 
of the Revolution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6703 
November 30, 2021 
I am going to quote a little bit here 
from three of our Founders to see what 
they felt about the Bible. 
George Washington, ‘‘It is impossible 
to govern the world without God and 
the Bible. Of all of the dispositions and 
habits that lead to political prosperity, 
our religion and morality are the indis-
pensable supporters.’’ 
John Jay, the original Chief Justice 
of the U.S. Supreme Court. I wonder if 
the Chief Justice would say this today. 
‘‘The Bible is the best of all books, for 
it is the Word of God and teaches us 
the way to be happy in this world and 
in the next. Continue therefore to read 
it and to regulate your life by its pre-
cepts.’’ 
I will go back to John Adams one 
more time. ‘‘Suppose a Nation in some 
distant region should take the Bible for 
their only law book, and every member 
should regulate his conduct by the pre-
cepts there exhibited. Every member 
would be obliged in conscience, to tem-
perance, frugality, and industry; to jus-
tice, kindness, and charity towards his 
fellow men; and to piety, love, and rev-
erence toward Almighty God . . . What 
a Eutopia, what a paradise would this 
region be.’’ 
It is primarily important to read the 
Bible to understand the history of the 
world, the commandments we are to 
live by, and also the life of Jesus 
Christ. 
I may also point out, in particular, 
we should pay attention to the books 
of the Old Testament in learning les-
sons that God taught Israel. 
We cannot understand our Constitu-
tion without a thorough reading of the 
Bible, and, therefore, I don’t think you 
can be a decent congressman without a 
thorough reading of the Bible, which is 
why we have National Bible Week 
today. I hope as many Members as pos-
sible read the Bible themselves. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois 
(Mrs. MILLER), my friend and col-
league. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my friend, Congress-
man LAMBORN, for hosting this wonder-
ful Special Order this evening. 
It is fitting that we commemorate 
the Bible’s central role in moral, edu-
cated, and free societies and that we 
get to celebrate the freedom that we 
have in this country to own, to share, 
and to speak about the Bible. 
Bible reading has been a great en-
couragement and comfort to people 
throughout history and has contrib-
uted to the spiritual, moral, and social 
fiber of our Nation. 
Millions of Americans have been im-
pacted by the Bible. It is especially im-
portant to my constituents back in the 
15th Congressional District of Illinois. 
It is a priority of our home. We have 
daily Bible reading and scripture mem-
ory, and we raised our children that 
way. 
John Quincy Adams said, ‘‘So great 
is my veneration for the Bible that the 
earlier my children begin to read it, 
the more confident will be my hope 
that they will prove useful citizens of 
their country and respectable members 
of society.’’ 
I do have to agree with Congressman 
BABIN when he said we live in perilous 
times. I would like to suggest that 
maybe we shouldn’t have neglected in 
recent times the Scriptures and maybe 
we need to give more earnest heed to 
the Bible and what it says. 
The Bible is the book above all oth-
ers, to be read at all ages and in all 
conditions of human life. The Psalms 
say, ‘‘Your word is a lamp to my feet 
and a light to my path.’’ 
It answers all the great questions of 
life: Where did we come from? Why am 
I here? How shall I live? What is good 
and evil? What is the remedy for my 
sin? And where is our destiny? 
May those of us who read and rev-
erence the Holy Scriptures be doers of 
the Word and not hearers only. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Ten-
nessee (Mrs. HARSHBARGER), another 
one of our great freshmen Members. 
Mrs. 
HARSHBARGER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and holding this Special Order 
hour tonight. 
Let me start with a couple of ques-
tions that people might have about the 
Bible. 
What is the Bible? It is 66 different 
books composed by different people in 
three different languages written in 
different circumstances. 
The writers were from different so-
cial ranks: statesmen, peasants, herds-
men, fishermen, kings, priests, tax col-
lectors, tentmakers, physicians. They 
were educated and uneducated, Jews 
and gentiles. Most of them were un-
known to each other, writing during 
various periods over 1,600 years, and 
yet it is one book about one subject. 
That subject is about mankind’s re-
demption. 
The Bible is inspired by God. It is 
without error and does not misrepre-
sent the facts. It is trustworthy and 
the final authority for everything it 
teaches. 
The next question is: Why would God 
give us the Bible? He did it to tell us 
the story of His infinite love and re-
demption for you and for me; to give us 
the amazing truth that the Lord not 
only offers forgiveness for our sins but 
also, He gives us the power to obey His 
law. 
Every problem you face has already 
been answered in the Bible. It says 
nothing is new under the Sun, and that 
is true. 
I have learned by reading God’s Word 
that there is an answer to every ques-
tion, if we just take the time to look in 
the Scriptures. 
God desires an intimate relationship 
with each one of His creations, and it 
should be our goal as Christians to be 
obedient to God’s Word, because obedi-
ence is better than sacrifice. 
God gives us that little bit of faith to 
believe that He loved us enough to die 
for us so we can live again with Him in 
Heaven. 
He already knows the desires of our 
heart before we even ask. Reading the 
Scriptures has taught me that nothing 
is wasted that happens in a person’s 
life. Our steps are ordered, and God has 
a plan for our lives. 
My prayer is this: That God would 
keep His hand on this great Nation. 
I am asking my fellow Christians to 
help me pray for our country that 
God’s will be done; that God will un-
cover what men or women try to de-
ceitfully cover up; that God will raise 
up men and women to serve in all 
places in the government throughout 
the world and will call upon His name 
and pray according to His will and 
faith, believing in the name of Jesus 
Christ. 
We should remember this: Our en-
emies are defenseless against our pray-
ers. 
I want to encourage America that 
there are Congressmen and Congress-
women who meet every Wednesday at 7 
o’clock to pray for our Nation, and I 
implore them to help us pray. 
Jeremiah 29:11 says, ‘‘ ‘For I know the 
plans I have for you,’ declares the 
Lord, ‘plans to prosper you and not to 
harm you, plans to give you a hope and 
a future.’ ’’ 
That is what I pray for America. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to tell you my story real 
briefly. 
When I was a freshman in college 
years ago, I was asked if I knew what 
the Bible was about. I said, yeah, I 
know what it is about. But I had never 
read it for myself, which was actually 
pretty presumptuous. 
Madam Speaker, I wonder if this 
might be true for anyone else who is 
listening here today? 
The only honest thing I could do 
when I was confronted with that ques-
tion was to actually read the Bible for 
myself. I started with the Gospel of 
John. 
When I read it, I discovered that I 
didn’t know what was in it at all. I had 
all of these preconceived ideas, but yet 
I discovered things like Jesus said: ‘‘I 
am the way, the truth, and the life. No 
one 
comes 
to 
the 
Father 
except 
through Me.’’ So I ended up discovering 
a personal relationship with Jesus 
Christ who became my Lord and Sav-
ior. 
Madam Speaker, I speak from per-
sonal experience when I say that it is 
better to read the Bible for one’s self 
and not just take someone else’s word 
for what it says. My life has been 
transformed by the truth that it con-
tains. The message of the good news of 
Jesus is still transforming many lives 
today. 
‘‘For God so loved the world that He 
gave His only begotten Son, that who-
ever believes in Him should not perish 
but have everlasting life,’’ John 3:16. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. NOR-
MAN).

November 30, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Congressman LAMBORN for hold-
ing this Special Order. 
As I was listening to him, I was re-
minded of the Museum of the Bible 
that we all went to 4 years ago when it 
opened up. I asked one of the leaders 
there: What is the theme of the Mu-
seum of the Bible? What is the over-
riding thing that you want the Museum 
of the Bible to ascend to? 
I will never forget his words. He said, 
Read the Bible. He said, It does not 
need any guardian; it does not need 
any interpretation. Read the Bible. It 
will change your life. That is what I 
have found to be true and what is so 
needed today in America. 
Madam Speaker, it is such an honor 
to come before you today to celebrate 
National Bible Week. What better 
place to celebrate the Bible than in 
what is called the people’s House but 
what is ultimately God’s house. 
As has been said, in 1941, President 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt issued a na-
tional proclamation to celebrate the 
impact of the Bible on our Nation. The 
Bible has been a light for so many and 
a source of hope in the darkest of 
times, and its influence on this Nation 
is unmistakable. 
In this Chamber, Moses, the mes-
senger of the Ten Commandments and 
witness of God in all of His glory upon 
the mountaintop, watches over this 
body from above the gallery doors each 
time we gather to conduct business. 
However, it is not merely the mul-
titudes of honorary monuments and 
portraits of Biblical figures and pas-
sages that exemplify the importance of 
Scripture to all Americans, but it is 
the impressions of our social fabric, so 
evident in our actions, which speaks 
volumes. 
This Nation was founded upon Judeo- 
Christian principles. A stroll past any 
of the extraordinary monuments here 
in Washington, D.C., makes that abun-
dantly clear. Our commitment to the 
principles enshrined in the written 
Word has sustained us throughout our 
rich history during the highest of 
times and during the lowest of times. 
The profound impact of the Bible, and 
particularly the Gospels, changed my 
life and continues to guide me as a pub-
lic servant today. 
I believe that if we continue to turn 
to God in all of what we do and love 
each other as God loves us, our best is 
yet to come. If we fail to do so, the 
worst is yet to come. 
Despite our political differences and 
well-known imperfections, God never 
fails us. An annual celebration of His 
Word and unending love is the perfect 
reminder for us to unite with the com-
mon goal of humbly serving our Cre-
ator and encouraging this Nation to do 
the same. 
b 2015 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from the great 
State of Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank Mr. LAMBORN for organizing 
this Special Order. The Scripture tells 
us in Psalm 100 that God is good, that 
His mercies are everlasting, that His 
truth endures to all generations, and 
that truth is revealed to us in God’s 
Word. 
This week we will see communities 
and churches and leaders all across the 
country 
celebrating 
National 
Bible 
Week for its importance in the role and 
life of our country and us as individ-
uals. 
I believe that we, as political leaders, 
have 
the 
responsibility 
to 
remind 
America and our citizens of the signifi-
cance of the Bible in our history, our 
life, and our culture. It is impossible to 
accurately describe the history of 
America without including the history 
of the Bible and its impact on our 
Founders and the impact it can have 
on us today. 
I think of all the magnificent truths 
of God’s Word, which I begin every day 
in, all the incredible things, the wis-
dom, the splendor of it all, but I think 
the most important thing ever that has 
transformed my life is how God took 
my sins away. 
The Scripture describes for us in Isa-
iah 53 that all of us, like sheep, had 
gone astray, that all of us had sin, 
heaped upon sin, but that God laid on 
Jesus the iniquity of us all. That is the 
story of the great love and the mercy 
of God, where He who was sinless took 
upon Himself our sins and made the 
pathway for us to have forgiveness and 
peace with God, both now and forever 
more. 
I urge my colleagues to be open and 
receptive to the love of God, to the for-
giveness of God. I urge our country to 
be receptive to the Word of God, the 
truth of God. The blessings of God 
await us as a Nation as we return to 
the truths of His Word. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from the great 
State of Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congressman LAMBORN for organizing 
tonight’s Special Order, as we honor 
the 80th anniversary of National Bible 
Week. 
We are a divided Nation, we are a di-
vided Congress. In fact, the church is 
having much division right now. Jesus, 
in the Scriptures, said it would be like 
this. That is why we recognize the im-
portance of God’s Word, which address-
es every issue that divides us, and it 
also has the power to unite us. 
Jesus prayed for us in John 17:21, 
‘‘that all of them may be one, Father, 
just as you are in me and I am in you.’’ 
Why did he pray that? He prayed that, 
and He said, ‘‘so that they would know 
that You sent me.’’ That is how impor-
tant unity is. 
The Bible is God’s incredible gift to 
each of us, providing guidance during 
times of joy and hardship. We are with-
out excuse. 
Over 21 years ago, as I was going 
through a time of trying to really de-
cide what my faith would look like— 
and actually this is a Bible that we are 
currently reading here in Congress. It 
is called the Change Your Life Daily 
Bible. We have a number of Members 
who read it. In fact, if you want to 
know what your Member of Congress 
reads every day, you can get one of 
these Change Your Life Study Bibles. 
Today’s reading was exactly what I 
was going through at that time 21 
years ago. He says: ‘‘If we claim we 
have no sin, we are only fooling our-
selves and not living in the truth, but 
if we confess our sins to Him, He is 
faithful and just to forgive us our sins 
and to cleanse us from all wickedness. 
If we claim we have not sinned, we are 
calling God a liar and showing that his 
Word has no place in our hearts.’’ That 
is today’s reading from I John 1:8–10. 
That cut through me like butter 21 
years ago, and I made a covenant with 
God. I said, You have forgiven my sins. 
And I prayed that He would forgive my 
sins on that day, and I told God that I 
would make him priority one. 
What that means, there are about 
five disciplines. One of them, of course, 
is reading the Scriptures, meditating 
on the Scriptures. In doing so, I 
learned that all of my strength and 
wisdom doesn’t come from me, but 
through Him and His spirit. 
Now could you imagine what this 
Congress and this Nation would look 
like if we all learned that our talent 
and wisdom is a gift from God to serve 
a purpose and to honor Him and glorify 
Him? We would have the power in this 
place to come together as one in truth. 
I will leave you with this: There are 
many promises in the Bible, but God’s 
instructions to us in Joshua 1:8, He 
said, do not let this Book of Law de-
part from your lips. Be careful to do 
what it says, meditate on it night and 
day, and you will be prosperous and 
successful. 
That is what the American people 
want. As Members of Congress, I pray 
that we will come together, that we 
will share in His Word, that we will 
test every piece of legislation with His 
Word; we will pray over every piece of 
legislation, and that it would be pleas-
ing and a blessing to God. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from the great 
State of Mississippi (Mr. GUEST). 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, former 
President Ronald Reagan once said, 
‘‘Within the covers of the Bible are the 
answers for all the problems men face.’’ 
The answers in the Bible have pro-
vided our Nation with valuable wisdom 
over the course of history. In times of 
fear, God’s Word has provided encour-
agement; in times of joy, it has sup-
plied words of praise; and in times of 
uncertainty, it has offered peace. 
My hope is that all Americans will 
continue to live by the truth and the 
wisdom of the Word of God. 
As we face the future, we must never 
forget that our Nation was divinely in-
spired on biblical principles. We must 
recognize that we are blessed to live in 
a country where we can worship freely, 
and we must work to see that we al-
ways remain one nation under God.

But perhaps most important to our 
challenges today is to heed the great-
est commandment, love the Lord your 
God with all your heart, with all your 
soul, and with all your might, and love 
your neighbor as yourself. 
May God continue to bless the United 
States of America. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for those words. 
I yield to the gentleman from the 
great 
State 
of 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
KELLY), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. LAMBORN for or-
ganizing this Special Order hour to-
night to talk about the Bible. 
When we have so much reverence for 
the Bible—and even though from this 
very city we have been ridiculed for 
clinging to our guns and our Bibles—I 
find it so unusual in a country that has 
been so blessed, a Nation that has been 
so blessed by God that we would actu-
ally at times ridicule His Word. 
President Franklin Roosevelt, as we 
have been told, first declared National 
Bible Week in 1941. Why did he do that? 
It was on the eve of World War II. 
Throughout history, the Bible has been 
our source of hope, inspiration, and 
strength for many. In times of peril, 
adversity, and tragedy, its words pro-
vide even greater comfort. 
President Lincoln said, ‘‘I have been 
driven many times upon my knees by 
the overwhelming conviction that I 
had nowhere else to go. My own wis-
dom and that of all about me seemed 
insufficient for that day.’’ 
And that is when we turn to our Bi-
bles, that is when we fall to our knees. 
That is when we know, as men, we are 
not able on our own to change the 
things that need to be changed, and we 
have to cling to our Bibles. That is 
where we find solace. That is where we 
find faith. That is where we find trust. 
What a wonderful opportunity not 
only for this House but for the people 
of the United States of America to stop 
and take survey of where we are and 
where we are going, and then go back 
and reference in the greatest book ever 
written to find out what it is that we 
need to do. 
It is when we turn away from God 
that America fails, and it is when we 
do fall to our knees when it seems like 
there is no other place to go that we 
find great solace, great faith, and great 
confidence in our God, through the 
Bible. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. LAM-
BORN for what he did tonight. This is 
the time for the United States of 
America to open her Bibles and follow 
what is written there. It comes directly 
from God. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. KELLY
for his heartfelt 
words. 
I now yield to the gentleman from 
the great State of Tennessee (Mr. 
ROSE). 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
LAMBORN) for yielding and for claiming 
the time this evening to acknowledge 
the significance of honoring God’s 
Word. 
Madam Speaker, as we gather to-
night to recognize the 80th celebration 
of National Bible Week, I am reminded 
of Matthew 18:20, ‘‘For where two or 
three gather in my name, there am I 
with them.’’ 
When the Pilgrims landed in the New 
World, they made a covenant with God 
that they would serve the Lord. When 
the Founding Fathers crafted our Con-
stitution, they remembered the prin-
ciples set forth in the Word of God. 
As a child growing up in the Upper 
Cumberland region of Tennessee, we 
used to begin each day at school with 
prayer and Bible reading. We would 
also stand, place our hand over our 
heart, and proudly recite the Pledge of 
Allegiance to our flag, which describes 
our Republic as one nation under God. 
But as a nation today, we are moving 
further away from these Godly prin-
ciples. We live in a culture and society 
that says the way we have always done 
things has to change. We are told to 
bend tradition, bend the truth, and 
bend conviction to accommodate the 
radical message of the day. And if we 
refuse, we run the risk of being tar-
geted by the cancel culture. 
Although it is often difficult to stand 
against societal trends such as those I 
describe, I believe it is better to walk 
with God’s truth, the truth which is 
found within the pages of the Holy 
Bible. 
As Christians, we are filled with the 
truth and hope found in God’s Word. In 
a time of uncertainty, where woke 
news and social media organizations 
malign those of us who espouse these 
traditional values, giving us less hope 
for a bright future, God’s Word remains 
the same. Our God is faithful, and He is 
the same yesterday, today, and forever. 
In America, freedom is something we 
often take for granted. We are free to 
speak, we are free to worship, and we 
are free to read the Holy Book, and we 
are free to spread the gospel to all the 
world and to all generations without 
fear of persecution. But all these free-
doms today are under attack like never 
before. 
It is in that that I was encouraged 
earlier today when a good friend of 
mine, 
David 
Fox, 
and 
his 
grand-
daughter, Audrey Jane Bowman, called 
as they were studying her fourth grade 
civics lessons. So I was encouraged to 
know that they are espousing and con-
tinuing. Mr. Fox is an elder in my 
church. 
As a devoted Christian, I am proud to 
recognize National Bible Week and 
usher in renewal of religious liberty in 
America. I pray to the God of Abra-
ham, Isaac, and Jacob for the fortitude 
and humility to properly represent 
David Fox and Audrey Jane Bowman, 
and all of the good people of the Sixth 
Congressional District of Tennessee; 
and that through this Word, I will be 
able to help bring more souls to know 
Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior. 
May God continue to bless our great 
nation and bless each one of us. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from the great 
State of North Carolina (Mr. BUDD), my 
good friend and colleague. 
b 2030 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. 
LAMBORN) for hosting this very special 
hour. 
Now, the Apostle Paul, when he was 
in prison and was persecuted for his 
faith and was awaiting execution for it, 
he wrote to his young mentee, Tim-
othy. He wrote in the original Koine 
Greek, which was the trade language of 
the day, and he penned these words: 
‘‘kyruxon ton logon.’’ That is, again, 
Greek, but the English translation 
would be ‘‘preach the word.’’ It is 2 
Timothy 4:2, and it is the motto of my 
alma mater, Dallas Theological Semi-
nary. 
The verse goes on to say: ‘‘be ready 
in season and out of season.’’ 
There are moments when the Word of 
God is popular and people want to hear 
it. Now it seems there are increasingly 
frequent moments when it is unpopular 
and out of season to preach the Word. 
Friends, colleagues, Madam Speaker, 
social trends, they come and go, and as 
the prophet Isaiah and then again the 
Apostle Peter hundreds of years later 
tells us, ‘‘The grass withers and the 
flowers fall, but the Word of the Lord,’’ 
the very one we honor this week and in 
this hour, the Word of God stands for-
ever. Peter closes out that chapter by 
saying: ‘‘And this Word is the good 
news that was preached to you.’’ 
So as we approach this Christmas 
season, might we do something a little 
out of season in this day and age. 
Might we turn to the Scriptures, 
whether it is the Old Testament that 
prophesies forward to the first Christ-
mas, or to Matthew and Luke’s ac-
count of that first Christmas, or to the 
rest of the Scriptures that show our 
saving response to that first Christ-
mas, that first Good Friday and the 
very first Easter, resurrection Sunday. 
Friends, the Word of God stands for-
ever in these tenuous times, and in 
these tenuous times, access to the eter-
nal is really what we need. The apostle 
Peter closes out this chapter and this 
verse that I referred to earlier and he 
says, ‘‘And this Word is the good news 
that was preached to you.’’ And, 
friends, good news it is. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for his kind 
words and for his heartfelt remarks. 
I yield to the gentleman from the 
great State of Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for hosting this Special 
Order in honor of National Bible Week. 
To my father who preached the Word 
as a minister of the Gospel, tonight, 
papa, you can hear me directly.

the earliest 17th century settlements

establishment of democracy, the Bible 
and its principles are intricately woven 
into our national fabric. This great ex-
periment that is democracy has been 
undoubtedly buttressed by the Bible 
for now over two centuries. 
It was because of their devotion to 
the Word of God that settlers rejected 
the oppressive rule of the Church of 
England and pursued a government free 
from religious tyranny. 
On September 7, 1774, when the first 
Congress met together, what was their 
first action? It was reading the Bible 
followed by prayer. And what did they 
read? It was Psalm 35, and the first 
three versus of Psalm 35 say: ‘‘Contend, 
Lord, with those who contend with me; 
fight against those who fight against 
me. Take up shield and armor; arise 
and come to my aid. Brandish spear 
and javelin against those who pursue 
me. Say to me, ‘I am your salvation.’’’ 
The British had just attacked and oc-
cupied Boston, and these Representa-
tives were seeking counsel from their 
creator. 
The Bible was also crucial to the 
unity and success of our Founding Fa-
thers. In 1813, John Adams wrote in a 
letter to Thomas Jefferson that ‘‘the 
general principles on which the Fa-
thers achieved independence’’ were the 
‘‘general principles of Christianity, in 
which all those sects were united and 
the general principles of English and 
American liberty.’’ 
The role of the Bible is evident in our 
Nation’s founding and so, too, will the 
Bible play a pivotal role in our Na-
tion’s preservation. The infallible Word 
of God not only proclaims God’s re-
demptive plan for mankind, but it acts 
as a moral compass for society and 
government that exceeds the bounds of 
time. 
Tomorrow is December 1, and we are 
now in the Christmas season. Over 2,000 
years ago, the prophet Isaiah spoke one 
of the greatest proclamations ever 
made in Isaiah 9:6, where the prophet 
says: ‘‘For unto us a child is born, unto 
us a son is given, and the government 
shall be upon his shoulder. And his 
name shall be called Wonderful, Coun-
selor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting 
Father, the Prince of Peace.’’ 
This prophecy was fulfilled with the 
birth of our savior, Jesus Christ. This 
is the Bible, the Word of God come 
alive, and the government shall be on 
his shoulder. He shall be the support 
and underpinning of the Government, a 
government whose foundation is built 
on God, and his Word is a government 
that will have peace, freedom, and lib-
erty. Jesus’ birth, death, and resurrec-
tion are what enables us to proclaim 
joy to the world because he is the 
prince of peace. 
As we celebrate Christmas, let us re-
flect on the Biblical principles that 
united and guided our Founding Fa-
thers, and let us strive to maintain 
those principles every day by reading 
the most important book on Earth, the 
book of God’s Word, the Bible. Soli Deo 
gloria. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD), my friend and colleague. 
Mr. CLOUD. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Mr. LAMBORN for his leadership in put-
ting this Special Order together. It is 
appropriate. It is right. It is certainly 
fitting for us to come here on the 80th 
anniversary of National Bible Week 
and talk about the Bible’s immense im-
portance to our identity as a Nation. 
George Washington said that religion 
and morality are indispensable sup-
ports of our Nation. Benjamin Franklin 
said that only a virtuous people are ca-
pable of freedom. 
Benjamin Rush said that without re-
ligion there can be no virtue; without 
virtue there can be no liberty; and lib-
erty is the object of all republican gov-
ernments. 
Thomas Jefferson warned us when he 
said: 
Can the liberties of a nation be secure 
when we have removed the only firm basis, a 
conviction in the minds of the people, that 
these liberties are a gift of God? They are 
not to be violated, but with his wrath I in-
deed tremble for my country when I reflect 
that God is just and that his justice cannot 
sleep forever. 
Indeed, even in this Chamber just 
outside the realm of the C–SPAN cam-
eras, this Chamber is circled by law-
makers. It is notable that Moses is the 
only lawmaker that is full faced; the 
rest are profile. Such is the importance 
of Scripture in this Nation’s founda-
tion and understanding of the rule of 
law. 
When I was sworn in, we had the 
Bible open in the ceremony to Proverbs 
14:3 that said that righteousness exalts 
a Nation. For me, it was a reminder to 
keep the important work that we do 
here in perspective because we can pass 
perfect laws, but if the hearts of the 
people are corrupt, we still have a poor 
Nation. 
So we need to do our best effort to do 
right by the people and to pass good 
laws, but we also need to acknowledge 
that God is the hope of this Nation. 
Our form of government, that thing 
that protects freedom and liberty, only 
works for people who have a respect for 
a 
moral 
framework. 
Indeed, 
John 
Adams said: ‘‘Our Constitution was 
made only for a moral and religious 
people. It is wholly inadequate to the 
government of any other.’’ 
It is reading through Scripture that 
gives us also an understanding of 
things like Romans 3:23 that says: ‘‘For 
all have sinned and fallen short of the 
glory of God.’’ That Scripture is what 
helps us to begin the path to find per-
sonal forgiveness and salvation, but it 
also helps us especially in times like 
we find ourselves in our Nation right 
now not to ignore our differences but 
to be able to look past them, to find 
the humility, to discuss and to em-
brace each other and to work toward a 
path of unity and healing in our Na-
tion. 
This book is still packed with wis-
dom for us as a Nation. We have often 
as a Nation turned to it in times when 
we needed comfort. May we now con-
tinue to turn to it at a time when we 
desperately need guidance. 
As Abraham Lincoln said: ‘‘I have 
been driven many times upon my knees 
by the overwhelming conviction that I 
had nowhere else to go. My own wis-
dom and that of all about me seemed 
insufficient for that day.’’ 
Let’s turn to Scripture, and may God 
bless this Nation. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
remember the time Mr. GOHMERT and I 
went to Israel together. That was a 
very special and, you can say, life- 
changing experience. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from the great State of Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend for yielding the time 
and for managing it. 
This is very important. We take 1 
week a year to acknowledge the impor-
tance of the Bible in America. The 
Bible was at the foundation of the 
great awakening in the first half of the 
1700s, the second great awakening in 
the first half of the 1800s, the 1700s. 
Many attribute that to leading to the 
liberty that drove the Revolution. 
The second great awakening leading 
to the desire for liberty that brought a 
war that ended slavery, no country had 
ever done that before. Fight a war? 
Lose 500,000, 600,000, 700,000 people in a 
war that would free people who were 
called slaves at the time? 
It took this Bible at the basis of an 
ordained Christian minister named Dr. 
King fighting for civil rights that 
brought us more freedom, that brought 
the Constitution into a fuller embrace 
of what this country is supposed to be 
about. 
C.S. Lewis talked about in this 
world, as the Bible teaches, that the 
prince of this world is not God. But 
Lewis said imagine being behind enemy 
lines and you get messages from your 
home headquarters, and you don’t pick 
them up and read them. Well, we have 
a book of messages from our home 
headquarters. You don’t have to be-
lieve that. We have the freedom to be-
lieve or not to believe so long as we 
don’t run this out of American society. 
This has to be the basis of morality. 
Otherwise, we lose the rights that are 
afforded us under our Constitution. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania (Mr. JOYCE). 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding and for holding this Special 
Order to highlight the importance of 
prayer as we work in the 117th Con-
gress. 
As we speak today, we know that God 
and not man has the final authority. If 
Congress is going to govern success-
fully, then we must rely on Him to do 
so. 
Perhaps one of our Founding Fathers 
from Pennsylvania said it best. At the 
Constitutional Convention, Benjamin

Franklin asked rhetorically: ‘‘If a spar-
row cannot fall to the ground without 
his notice, is it probable that an em-
pire can rise without his aid?’’ 
That question has the same implica-
tions today as it did in Philadelphia 
those 200-plus years ago. We know that 
those who build without the Lord, they 
labor in vain. 
In this body, we must strive to en-
sure that we are asking for God’s guid-
ance as we work to solve the difficult 
issues that we face here every day. 
Just yesterday, I spoke with Pastor 
Gary Dull, from the Faith Baptist 
Church of Altoona, who said if we are 
going to know the will of God for our 
Nation, we must go to Him in prayer. 
In everything that we do, we must seek 
his will. 
As we begin the final month, let us 
remember, let us together humbly 
pray. 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
f 
SHORTAGES IN FOOD CHAIN 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
prior to talking about the reconcili-
ation bill that passed last time we were 
here, I want to spend just a second to 
talk about possible shortages in the 
food chain that have been brought to 
my attention. I am not sure the admin-
istration is doing enough to deal with 
the problem. 
As with so many other things in to-
day’s world economy, critical ingredi-
ents, including glucosaminide, are pro-
duced abroad in China and Europe. 
These 
chemicals, 
including 
other 
things such as potash fertilizer, are sit-
ting in ships and not available for the 
United States. 
b 2045 
Our farmers only have one time a 
year to plant their crops. It is not like 
a factory when something is not avail-
able, you can just start up the factory 
again in 3 months. And we have real 
problems out there that I think have 
some farmers very concerned and some 
feed co-ops very concerned. I have not 
heard about this a lot. Though, when-
ever I tour my manufacturers, I hear 
the same thing. 
It is not unusual that some of these 
chemicals, which are very important to 
today’s agriculture, have gone up five 
times over what they were this time 
last year. Well, you can see what that 
is going to do to the cost of food, even 
if we get stuff. But I strongly encour-
age the Biden administration to edu-
cate themselves on shortages, which 
are hurting agriculture right now, to 
do something at the docks, to see if he 
could bring Congress in to maybe 
change the laws or do something about 
the draconian new laws they passed in 
California, making it more difficult to 
get these chemicals on trucks. 
But I do this just to warn people, in 
case anybody is listening from the 
Biden administration, and we will send 
them letters as well, if you want to 
avoid possible food shortages, dramatic 
increases in the cost of food, you have 
got to act now because farmers who are 
producing the corn and producing the 
soybeans are getting worried. And as 
far as I can see, rightfully so. 
VITAMIN D 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
the next issue that I am going to bring 
up is concerning vitamin D. 
I haven’t talked about vitamin D 
from this platform for quite a while. I 
know some people are worried that if 
you talk about it, it might discourage 
people from getting a vaccine, but I 
know somebody else who passed away 
in the last few weeks and I don’t be-
lieve they were taking the amount of 
vitamin D that is recommended. 
Vitamin D is very important for a va-
riety of things: Bone health, pre-
venting a variety of diseases. But the 
evidence suggests it could be very im-
portant in reducing both the severity 
and the amount of COVID. The number 
of Americans who are vitamin D defi-
cient is very high. I don’t normally 
like to talk about racial things, but I 
want to read some statistics that some 
people back home can take. 
Right now, there is disagreement as 
to the appropriate amount of vitamin 
D a person should have in their system, 
the number of nanograms per milli-
liter. Some people feel it is 20. Some 
people feel it is 30. But let’s assume, for 
the sake of an argument, that it should 
be 30. Right now, 65 percent of the 
White population of this country would 
be considered vitamin D deficient; 80 
percent of the Hispanic population 
would be considered vitamin D defi-
cient; and 96 percent of the Black popu-
lation would be considered vitamin D 
deficient. 
It is my opinion, and the opinion of 
the experts, that one reason certain 
groups have more people dying of this 
horrible disease is because of the 
much-elevated vitamin D deficiency. 
The way to handle it is simple: You 
should be taking vitamin D on a daily 
basis. We are told that Anthony Fauci 
takes 6,000 units a day. I don’t know if 
that is true or not. I wish he would 
talk about it a lot more, if he does. 
But you have to remember, when you 
begin to take vitamin D, it doesn’t get 
in your system right away. If you begin 
to take vitamin D today, it may get in 
your system 4 weeks from now. It may 
not get in your system until 30 weeks 
from now. 
There is a more expensive form of vi-
tamin D called calcifediol, which works 
in hours, not weeks or months. Unfor-
tunately, that formula, which is read-
ily available, I am told, in Australia, is 
quite expensive. I would encourage peo-
ple who are interested in it to famil-
iarize themselves with how to get 
ahold of it and educate their own doc-
tors as to how to get ahold of it, be-
cause if you do get COVID, a lot of 
times doctors now are prescribing vita-
min D for people. But despite pre-
scribing it for people, if they give them 
like 5,000 units a day, you are not going 
to have that kick in for a month. So 
you should familiarize yourself with 
how to get this fast-acting vitamin D, 
which will help people quite a bit 
quicker. 
There are a couple things I will point 
out to the public health establishment 
that the experts in vitamin D can’t un-
derstand. First of all, if you come in 
for an annual checkup, particularly an 
older person, you ought to be tested for 
vitamin D to find out whether you are 
deficient or not. It is not that expen-
sive. It is something that should be 
done automatically. And if you are di-
agnosed with COVID, again, you should 
right away be tested for vitamin D de-
ficiency, because if you are deficient, 
things can be done. People suggest tak-
ing as many as 50,000 units in a week if 
it is determined you are vitamin D de-
ficient. 
But in any event, I would strongly 
encourage the CDC and NIH to do more 
research regarding vitamin D. Again, I 
would strongly encourage them to 
make a vitamin D test both in the an-
nual checkup and it is something all 
hospitals should be doing if people 
come in and they find out they are 
COVID positive. 
I will also point out, we do not know 
yet whether this omicron variant, 
there are indications that it is going to 
be a little bit more difficult to be 
taken care of with a vaccine. And it is 
another reason why people ought to be 
paying more attention to vitamin D. 
It is my personal opinion—nobody 
knows the amount of lives that can be 
saved, but depending upon who the ex-
perts are that you are talking to, to 
guess maybe on the low side, maybe 25 
percent; on the high side, over 50 per-
cent. And the fact that this relatively 
cheap vitamin has been out there for 2 
years and has been left relatively un-
touched by the public health establish-
ment is, I think, a scandal. But I would 
strongly encourage anybody that is lis-
tening today to familiarize yourself 
with vitamin D, talk it over with your 
doctor, and get a vitamin D test. 
RECONCILIATION BILL 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Now, the reason I 
originally asked to speak today was 
with regard to the reconciliation bill. I 
think it is something that Americans 
should be paying attention to, not be-
cause of the cost, though the cost is 
horrific, and it is going to result in 
still more inflation and still more de-
struction of the value of the dollar. I 
think there are three areas that would 
permanently change America. I hope it 
is something that the public can bring 
up prior to the Senate taking up the 
bill. 
The number one issue is immigra-
tion. We are at a time where, depend-
ing on the month, over 100,000 people 
can come cross our southern border. 
The bill responds by changing the law 
and making up to 7 million people who

are currently in this country illegally, 
setting them on a path to citizenship. 
It is changing things so it will be more 
difficult to deport felons, even felons 
who have committed felonies. 
My goodness, if you are not going to 
deport a felon who has committed a fel-
ony, who are you going to deport? You 
are taking away the flexibility as to 
whether you can deport them or not. 
In this bill, we are giving free Pell 
grants, which are the grants we give to 
people to go to college. We are giving 
these away to illegal immigrants. I 
think this is such a bizarre decision be-
cause it is not difficult to find Ameri-
cans who are $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 in 
debt because they are regular, middle- 
class, hardworking families, but we are 
giving the people who come here ille-
gally free college. 
I just think that it is such a bizarre 
decision, but it goes to the apparent at-
tempt of the Biden administration and 
the majority party to do all they can 
to get as many people here as possible. 
I will point out, in this bill there was 
no money for new Border Patrol 
agents, which is another green light to 
have more people come here. 
Right now, the drug gangs will use 
this information, perhaps on ads on 
Central American television, to tell 
people now is the time to give the drug 
gangs $3,000, $5,000, $8,000 to come to 
the United States. 
A couple other comments on what is 
going on at the border: Last time I was 
down there, I saw on the path leading 
to this country, thrown-away identi-
fications—like driver’s licenses being 
thrown away. 
You have to ask yourselves, if people 
are coming to this country and throw-
ing away their identification from Hon-
duras, from Venezuela, from Brazil, 
wherever, why are they doing that? 
Why do you not want people to know 
what name you operated under in your 
prior country is? I can only think be-
cause you are running away from 
something in the past. This is common 
among the people that are coming here 
now. 
There are two other things I am 
going to point out for America, one is: 
They should weigh in with Congress on 
this significant bill. We are having the 
government take care of all the three- 
and four-year-olds. 
As I said before, insofar as we have 
flaws in our education system, it is 
more in the middle-school area, not the 
preschool area. Traditionally, in this 
country we are supposed to be a coun-
try of strong families in which parents 
raise their children. It is a funda-
mental change, I think, in the role of 
government for Congress to pass a law 
saying from here on out it is up to the 
government to take care of the three- 
and four-year-olds. 
The other thing I want America to 
look out for is 85,000 IRS agents. That 
is such a massive amount. I used to do 
taxes. I am somewhat familiar with au-
dits. It is not going to be pleasant for 
Americans, and at a time when every 
business I can think of—manufac-
turing, tourism, agriculture, medical 
field—everybody is short of people to 
work. 
And how are we responding? Let’s 
take 85,000 people and have them work 
for the IRS. Manufacturing needs those 
people. Hospitals need those people. 
Why in the world, 85,000 IRS agents? 
And, of course, the amount of jobs that 
will be necessary is multiplied because 
if you have more IRS agents poking 
around the businesses, you have to hire 
more accountants to deal with the IRS 
agents. 
So that is a very strange decision. 
But to me, it shows that this adminis-
tration wants to be the surveillance ad-
ministration. And that is another fun-
damental change in the way I think 
our forefathers imagined this country 
or the way this country should be. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the re-
mainder of my time.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, who protects us like a

continue to bless them, for You know 
their needs, motives, hopes, and fears. 
When our Senators grow faint and 
weary and the night overtakes them, 
renew their strength and enable them 
to soar on wings like eagles. May the 
different approaches expressed by both 
parties contribute to greater solutions 
to the problems in our Nation and

We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen.

and Programs. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
H.R. 4350 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, after 
spending—this 
is 
on 
NDAA. 
After 
spending months insisting that the 
Senate should take swift action on our 
annual Defense bill, last night, Repub-
licans mounted a partisan filibuster, 
blocking this Chamber from moving 
forward on the NDAA. 
For the information of all, before the 
vote closed last night, I changed my 
vote to ‘‘no’’ and then entered a mo-
tion to reconsider the cloture vote so 
we could find a path forward on this 
important bill. 
Now, we have heard over and over 
and over again from Republicans, in 
some form or another, that the Senate 
must act on NDAA and must act quick-
ly. One Republican colleague called it a 
core duty, a bare minimum. Yet an-
other colleague said it was ‘‘the best 
way to thank our soldiers and sailors 
for their service.’’ 
But, 
last 
evening, 
Republicans 
blocked legislation to support our 
troops, support their families, keep 
Americans 
safe, 
and 
support 
jobs 
across the entire country. Republican 
dysfunction has again derailed even bi-
partisan progress on our annual de-
fense bill—an outrageous outcome that 
shows how the Senate and Republican 
leadership have changed in recent 
years. 
Previous 
leaders, 
knowing 
that 
Democrats had offered Republicans a 
whole lot of amendments, would have 
said: ‘‘Let’s vote cloture’’—but not this 
leader, not yet. 
And there should be no mistake: The 
process that Democrats, and particu-
larly my colleague Chairman REED, 
have offered Republicans on NDAA has 
been more than fair and reasonable. 
For months, my colleagues in the 
Armed Services Committee have been 
working to produce a bipartisan prod-
uct that could come to the floor for a 
vote. 
The bipartisan Reed-Inhofe agree-
ment—a Reed-Inhofe agreement—was 
what we brought to the floor yesterday 
to vote on. 
During the markup, Members consid-
ered 321 amendments and adopted 143

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8806 
November 30, 2021 
bipartisan ones before reporting the 
bill out of committee by a vote of 23 to 
3—23 to 3, bipartisan. 
In preparation for the Senate floor, 
the managers worked on a substitute 
amendment, which had at least 50 
amendments—27 of them, the majority, 
from Republicans. Senator INHOFE, the 
ranking member of the Armed Services 
Committee, worked with Democrats 
and had agreed to this. 
And on top of all that, Senators REED 
and INHOFE also reached a bipartisan 
agreement to hold votes on 19 amend-
ments here on the floor before Repub-
licans blocked that proposal 2 weeks 
ago. 
Nineteen amendment votes—19—that 
is more than the total number of 
amendments to NDAA that received 
votes under the Republican majority 
and under Leader MCCONNELL when we 
debated this bill in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 
2020—not more than in each year, more 
than all of them put together. 
We just had 2 amendments on NDAA 
in 2017, when MCCONNELL was majority 
leader. We had 5 in 2018, when MITCH 
MCCONNELL was majority leader; 3 in 
2019; and 7 in 2020. Adding that up, that 
is a total of 17. That is over 4 years. 
This year, we offered 19 amendment 
votes, including bipartisan measures to 
combat ransomware, repeal the 2020 
Iraq AUMF, and support improved 
cyber defense of our critical infrastruc-
ture. But when we tried to get consent 
to move on this package of amend-
ments, our Republican colleagues came 
down to the floor and objected not once 
but seven times. 
So we have had ample debate. This 
has been a fair and reasonable process 
that has showed respect to the other 
side. But this is a new Republican 
Party, unfortunately, and it was not 
good enough for them even on the De-
fense bill. 
Passing 
the 
annual 
Defense 
bill 
should not be in question, and Repub-
licans’ blocking this legislation is 
harmful to our troops, to their families 
who sacrifice so much, and to our ef-
forts to keep Americans around the 
world safe. 
Now, we Democrats are not going to 
let Republican intransigence stop us. 
We are going to keep working forward 
on a path forward, and we hope our Re-
publican colleagues, as they discuss 
this among themselves, will see the 
light and come up with a fair proposal 
to allow this bill to go forward. 
Nineteen amendments—a total of 17 
on all the other NDAA bills—to say 
that we are being unfair, to say that we 
are not giving enough amendments is 
poppycock, and they know it. 
Let’s move forward. Let’s move for-
ward. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. President, now on government 
funding, there is another critical pri-
ority that the Senate must also ad-
dress before the week’s end: passing a 
continuing resolution that will keep 
the government funded beyond the De-
cember 3 deadline. 
As soon as tomorrow, the House is 
expected to take action to pass a CR 
that will fund the government into 
next year. Senate Democrats are ready 
to pass this legislation and get it done 
as quickly as possible. 
To avoid a needless shutdown, Repub-
licans will have to cooperate and ap-
prove the government funding legisla-
tion without delay. If Republicans 
choose obstruction, there will be a 
shutdown entirely because of their own 
dysfunction. 
We cannot afford to go down that 
road. As winter begins, the last thing 
Americans need right now is an avoid-
able, Republican-manufactured shut-
down that will potentially harm mil-
lions of Federal workers, harm their 
families, and harm local communities 
that rely on an open and functioning 
Federal Government. 
Democrats are going to work all 
week to make sure no government 
shutdown comes to pass, and we urge 
our Republican colleagues to work 
with us. 
DEBT LIMIT 
Mr. President, on debt limit, also, 
soon the Senate must take action to 
assure that the United States does 
not—does not—default on its sovereign 
debt for the first time in history. I re-
cently had a good conversation with 
the Republican leader about this issue, 
and I expect to continue those talks on 
achieving a bipartisan solution to ad-
dressing the debt limit. 
By now we know the dangers of an 
unprecedented 
default. 
Secretary 
Yellen has warned that failure to ex-
tend the debt ceiling would ‘‘evis-
cerate’’ our economic recovery and 
says our country could yet again slip 
into ‘‘a deep recession.’’ 
Both parties know that this is simply 
unacceptable, and so I look forward to 
achieving a bipartisan solution to ad-
dressing the debt limit soon. 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. President, finally, on Build Back 
Better, before we hit Christmas Day, it 
is my goal to have the Senate take ac-
tion to debate and pass President 
Biden’s Build Back Better legislation. 
This week, Senate Democrats will 
focus on continuing to meet with the 
Parliamentarian so we can finish mak-
ing the technical and procedural fixes 
necessary for reconciliation. Once that 
is complete, it will be time to bring 
Build Back Better here to the floor of 
the Senate. 
I have said many times before that 
nobody should expect legislation of 
this magnitude to be easy. We have 
been at the task for several months, 
but we need to take a step back and 
recognize that we are, hopefully, less 
than a month away from acting on the 
largest investment the American peo-
ple have seen in generations. 
Here is what we are going to do in 
this bill: lower the cost of childcare, 
make pre-K universally accessible, cut 
taxes for parents and working and mid-
dle-class families, and take the next 
bold step in our fight against the cli-
mate crisis. 
All this we want to tackle before the 
Christmas break. So we will keep 
working this week and until we get it 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
REMEMBERING MAJOR IAN FISHBACK AND 
GUANTANAMO BAY CLOSURE 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier 
this month, while we were all home for 
the Thanksgiving recess, an American 
patriot passed away. His name was 
MAJ Ian Fishback. 
During his life, Major Fishback de-
fended our Nation during four tours of 
duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was 
an accomplished scholar, with degrees 
from both West Point and the Univer-
sity of Michigan, and a lifelong cham-
pion of justice. 
Tragically, like too many of our Na-
tion’s veterans, Major Fishback’s life 
ended far too soon. He died at the age 
of 42. Though his time on Earth was 
short, he left behind a legacy. He 
changed our Nation for the better. He 
inspired the Members of the Senate to 
make a historic stand against injus-
tice. 
You 
see, 
in 
2005, 
while 
Major 
Fishback was serving as captain in the 
U.S. Army infantry, he spoke out 
against America’s inhumane treatment 
of detainees after 9/11. In a letter to 
then-Senators John McCain and John 
Warner, Major Fishback wrote: ‘‘I have 
been unable to get clear, consistent an-
swers from my leadership about what 
constitutes lawful and humane treat-
ment of detainees. I am certain that 
this confusion contributed to a wide 
range 
of 
abuses 
including 
death 
threats, beatings, broken bones, mur-
der, exposure to elements, extreme 
forced physical exertion, hostage-tak-
ing, stripping, sleep deprivation and de-
grading treatment. I and troops under 
my command witnessed some of these 
abuses in both Afghanistan and Iraq.’’ 
Major Fishback’s courageous letter 
shed light on the atrocities that were 
being committed shamefully in the 
name of our Nation, and he felt that he 
had ‘‘failed’’ the servicemembers under 
his command. The reality is, our lead-
ers failed Major Fishback. 
In the wake of 9/11, the Bush adminis-
tration tossed aside our constitutional 
principles as well as the Geneva Con-
ventions. By condoning torture, they 
dishonored our Nation and actually en-
dangered our servicemembers. 
After reports emerged about horrific 
abuses at Abu Ghraib in Iraq, I tried 
for a year and a half to pass legislation 
to make it clear that cruel, inhuman, 
and degrading treatment of detainees 
was illegal. Two military heroes, my 
former colleague Senator John McCain 
and Major Fishback, turned the tide in 
this effort. 
In speaking out, Major Fishback ral-
lied the Members of this Chamber to 
support a torture amendment authored 
by Senator McCain and myself, which 
was added to the defense spending 
package for that year over a veto

November 30, 2021 
threat from the George W. Bush admin-
istration. That provision explicitly 
banned inhumane treatment of any 
prisoner held by the American Govern-
ment—on American soil or overseas. It 
set us on a course to restoring Amer-
ican values that were cast aside after 9/ 
11—work that is still ongoing 20 years 
later. 
We have a defense bill before us on 
the floor with many things in it that 
are positive, and I will vote for it. But 
it is a moment to also reflect that this 
bill does more than protect our Nation 
and help our troops; it also protects 
our values. That is why I have an 
amendment to this bill, which I hope 
we will have a chance to offer, that will 
close the detention facility at Guanta-
namo Bay once and for all. 
Since the first group of detainees was 
brought to Guantanamo in January of 
2002, four different Presidents have pre-
sided over the facility. In that time, 
the Iraq war has begun and ended, and 
the war in Afghanistan, our Nation’s 
longest war, has come to a close. A 
generation of conflict has come and 
gone. Yet the Guantanamo detention 
facility is still open, and every day it 
remains open is an affront to our sys-
tem of justice and the rule of law. It is 
where due process goes to die. That is 
precisely why military officials, na-
tional security experts, and leaders on 
both sides of the aisle have demanded 
its closure for years. 
The facility was virtually designed to 
be a legal black hole where detainees 
can be held incommunicado—beyond 
the reach of law—and subjected to un-
speakable torture and abuse. In the 
words of a former senior official in the 
Bush administration, Guantanamo ex-
isted in ‘‘the legal equivalent of outer 
space.’’ 
It was created to circumvent the Ge-
neva Conventions. What are those con-
ventions? We know. They were the 
internationally accepted standard of 
humane treatment for detainees and 
prisoners. Guantanamo was designed to 
circumvent it and other longstanding 
treaties. This subversion of justice has 
harmed detainees, it has undermined 
our moral standing, and it has failed to 
deliver justice, which it promised. 
For two decades, the families of 
Americans who died on 9/11 have waited 
for the alleged conspirators, who are 
being detained in Guantanamo, to be 
brought to justice. For 20 years, they 
have been waiting, but the case still 
hasn’t come to trial. Imagine. If justice 
delayed is justice denied, how can this 
be justice at Guantanamo? Instead, the 
facility has become a symbol for 
human rights abuse, lawlessness, and 
everything Major Fishback decried in 
his letter to Senator McCain. 
The stories out of Guantanamo and 
CIA black sites are shocking. Let me 
tell you one of them. 
Last month, Guantanamo detainee 
Majid Khan testified before a military 
jury about the abuse he suffered in the 
facility and in CIA black sites. It was 
the first time a detainee has described 
his torture at a CIA black site. 
Let’s be clear. Majid Khan is a 
former member of al-Qaida who should 
be held accountable for his actions, but 
there is no justification for torture. 
Mr. Khan recounted being abused in 
unspeakable, unthinkable ways by our 
government, 
including 
being 
waterboarded and shackled to a ceiling 
until his ankles swelled with blood. In 
one part of his testimony, he described 
a CIA medic sexually violating him 
with a garden hose. 
As Mr. Khan shared the excruciating 
details of his torture, the members of 
the jury listened closely. But pay heed: 
These weren’t average citizens sitting 
on the jury; they were Active-Duty, 
senior military U.S. officials on the 
jury. When the hearing concluded, 
these high-ranking military leaders did 
something unheard of. Seven of the 
eight jurors signed a handwritten let-
ter recommending clemency for Majid 
Khan. This is what they concluded, and 
I want to quote it word for word: ‘‘Mr. 
Khan has been held without the basic 
due process under the U.S. Constitu-
tion. . . . [He] was subjected to phys-
ical and psychological abuse well be-
yond approved enhanced interrogation 
techniques, instead being closer to tor-
ture performed by the most abusive re-
gimes in modern history. . . . [T]his 
abuse was of no practical value in 
terms of intelligence or any other tan-
gible benefits to U.S. interests.’’ 
Remember, I have just quoted these 
senior U.S. military officials who sat 
on a jury where this man was being 
tried, and they, in a handwritten let-
ter, wrote what I just read. 
Now, that last point is crucial. The 
human rights abuses committed in 
Guantanamo and CIA black sites are 
not merely inhumane; they don’t work. 
They are ineffective. 
Khan testified: ‘‘I lied just to make 
the abuse stop.’’ 
Torturing him brought us no clarity, 
brought us no truth, and brought us no 
closer to eradicating terrorism. In-
stead, stories about the torture of pris-
oners at Guantanamo have only galva-
nized America’s enemies. They have 
been packaged into propaganda and re-
cruitment tools for terrorism, which in 
turn endangers our service men and 
women as well as our allies. 
These accounts of abuse have also di-
minished our international standing. 
How can we claim credibility as a na-
tion? How can we hold authoritarian 
dictators accountable if they can point 
to our own legacy of cruelty and indefi-
nite detention? The man was held for 
20 years, and others are still being held 
without being brought to trial. 
Worse yet, the degrading conditions 
at Guantanamo are being funded by 
American taxpayers. How much is the 
cost of Guantanamo? Astronomic, that 
is how high it is. We spend more than 
$500 million a year to keep Guanta-
namo open—$500 million. Half a billion 
dollars a year American taxpayers are 
wasting to detain how many people for 
half a billion dollars? Thirty-nine. 
Thirty-nine prisoners, $500 million, and 
13 have already been approved for 
transfer. That works out to nearly $14 
million a year on each prisoner like 
Majid Khan—$14 million a year. Let me 
put that in perspective for a moment. 
That is enough money to expand Med-
icaid coverage to 1.5 million Americans 
over 10 years. 
Setting aside the cost, we have to ac-
knowledge the larger truth. Guanta-
namo does not reflect who we are or 
should be. Indefinite detention without 
charge or trial is antithetical to Amer-
ica’s values. Yet more than two-thirds 
of the people detained in Guantanamo 
today have never been charged with a 
crime. How can that be any form of 
justice? 
With or without the amendment I 
have introduced to this year’s Defense 
authorization, we must accelerate the 
timeline to finally close Guantanamo. 
As I mentioned, 39 prisoners, $500 mil-
lion a year? 
President Biden transferred his first 
detainee earlier this summer, but that 
pace—one every 6 months—is not going 
to set us on course to finally close 
Guantanamo. Like the war in Afghani-
stan, America’s failures in Guanta-
namo must not be passed on to another 
administration or to another Congress. 
Can this Senate summon the courage 
to finally close this detention facility? 
I would like to test it on the floor of 
the Senate. As a matter of fact, isn’t 
that why we are elected—to test a 
basic question like that? 
Next week, the Judiciary Committee 
is going to hold a hearing on how we 
can close Guantanamo once and for all. 
There are more steps the Biden admin-
istration can take to accelerate this 
closure. One is by appointing a special 
envoy to the State Department to ne-
gotiate transfer agreements for those 
inmates who are scheduled to be trans-
ferred—13 of the 39—to transfer them 
to other nations. 
We must also reach swift resolution 
in the remaining cases where charges 
have been brought, instead of moving 
forward with military commissions. 
Let’s finally accept the obvious: Mili-
tary commissions are not the answer in 
Guantanamo and have not been for 20 
years. If there is one lesson we can 
learn from the shameful legacy of 
Guantanamo, it is that we need to 
trust our system of justice. The use of 
torture and military commissions that 
deny due process have hindered our 
ability to bring terrorists to justice. 
Going forward, we should adhere to the 
long-held values of humane treatment 
and the rule of law. 
Our Federal courts have proven more 
than capable of handling even the most 
serious, complex terrorism cases. Since 
9/11, hundreds of terrorism suspects 
have been tried and convicted in our 
Federal courts, and many are now 
being safely held in Federal prisons. 
Compare that to the military commis-
sion case against the alleged conspira-
tors behind 9/11. It still hasn’t come to 
trial more than two decades after that 
horrendous attack. The families who

lost loved ones on that day deserve bet-
ter. America deserves better. And 
American patriots like Major Fishback 
deserve better as well. 
We all deserve better than these 
black holes that violate our national 
values and make true legal account-
ability impossible. 
As Major Fishback wrote to Senator 
McCain all those years ago, ‘‘If we 
abandon our ideals in the face of adver-
sity and aggression, then those ideals 
were never really in our possession.’’ 
It is time to live up to those ideals 
that our troops have risked their lives 
to defend. 
It is time, at long last, to face reality 
and honestly say, Close the detention 
facility in Guantanamo. Let’s put this 
dark chapter behind us once and for 
all. 
And 
in 
the 
memory 
of 
Major 
Fishback and the U.S. officials on that 
jury who spoke out, I thank them. I 
know it wasn’t easy. It is far easier to 
remain silent and to avoid the obvious. 
But they showed courage in disclosing 
to the American people what occurred 
at Guantanamo. 
Now, do we even have the courage to 
even debate this issue and vote on it on 
the floor of the Senate? 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
H.R. 4350 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday, a bipartisan majority of Sen-
ators rejected the Democratic leader’s 
efforts to shut down debate on the Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act and 
block new measures to get tougher on 
Russia. 
The Democratic leader wants to 
block 
the 
Senate 
from 
fully 
and 
robustly debating a number of impor-
tant issues—from how to manage the 
fallout from the reckless Afghanistan 
retreat to how to respond to China’s 
dramatic and destabilizing military 
modernization, to how to restore deter-
rence against an emboldened Iran. 
The NDAA is supposed to be the bi-
partisan forum for debating and acting 
on these kinds of issues. Months ago, 
the Armed Services Committee moved 
this process forward—listen to this—23 
to 3, but the Democratic leader has 
botched the floor process. 
It is especially bizarre to see the 
Democratic leader so focused, so in-
tent, on blocking the Senate from deal-
ing seriously with the growing aggres-
sion from Putin’s Russia. He seems 
downright desperate to block new bi-
partisan action on Nord Stream 2. It is 
really quite strange to see. Senators 
Risch and Cruz have proposed language 
concerning this Putin pipeline that the 
House was able to pass almost unani-
mously. Unlike the House provision, 
the Risch-Cruz amendment includes a 
waiver provision that would give the 
President 
more 
flexibility, 
which 
makes the Democratic leader’s effort 
to shut the process down and block 
their amendment all the more baffling. 
If there is opposition to the amend-
ment—if it can be improved with modi-
fications—then, by all means, let’s 
have a public debate. 
Likewise, Senator PORTMAN has been 
a leading voice for bolstering our Euro-
pean partners and delivering more 
meaningful support to Ukraine’s mili-
tary. As Putin amasses forces on 
Ukraine’s border, the Senate should de-
bate how to help the Ukrainians defend 
themselves. The Democratic leader is 
trying to shut that down as well. 
So the NDAA is not finished yet. So 
the Senate cannot be finished yet ei-
ther. We need the same kind of normal, 
robust, bipartisan amendment process 
that always characterizes this bill, and 
we need the Democratic leader to stop 
trying to block the Senate from sanc-
tioning Putin’s cronies. 
INFLATION 
Now, Mr. President, on an entirely 
different matter, 88 percent of Ameri-
cans are concerned about inflation— 
most of them are very concerned—and 
77 percent of Americans say inflation 
has affected them personally. We have 
a big and diverse country. It is hard to 
get that many Americans to agree on 
anything. But President Biden did 
promise he would unite the country, 
and on the Democrats’ watch, under 
the Democrats’ policies, the American 
people are united in their fear and frus-
tration at runaway prices, falling pur-
chasing 
power, 
and 
all 
the 
con-
sequences of inflation. The men and 
women of this country are spending 20 
percent more than last year for beef at 
the grocery store, 50 percent more to 
fill up the gas tank, 26 percent more for 
less choice in used cars. 
One recent article in the New York 
Times suggested that perhaps Ameri-
cans should forget about trying to buy 
their family members normal gifts and 
settle 
for 
exchanging 
handwritten 
promises to tackle household chores, 
such as ‘‘washing out the reusable plas-
tic bags.’’ I guess the Grinch is doing 
some ghostwriting in his spare time. 
Some weeks back, the White House 
Press Secretary tried to laugh off re-
porters’ questions about the supply 
chain and inflation crises. She literally 
laughed at the idea that anybody 
would be worried about the ‘‘tragedy of 
the treadmill that’s delayed.’’ 
Well, 
the 
President’s 
staff 
are 
yukking it up, but working parents 
aren’t laughing. Middle-class families 
aren’t laughing. 
A Kentuckian named Mike Halligan 
isn’t laughing either. He runs a big 
food bank in Lexington called God’s 
Pantry. They distribute more than 40 
million pounds of food every year at 
the local pantries all across my State. 
Here is what he says: 
We’ve seen the cost of our ‘‘sharing 
Thanksgiving basket’’ go up this year by 14.5 
percent. . . . We’ve seen our costs go up by 
about 50 percent. The transportation compo-
nent of that is literally doubled. 
And he also explained that, since in-
flation is also hammering his contribu-
tors, charities and nonprofits may face 
‘‘donor fatigue’’ at precisely the time 
they cannot afford a fall-off. The 
Democrats’ inflation is hitting, lit-
erally, every part of our society. 
A famous economist once said that 
inflation is the only form of tax that 
can be levied without any legislation, 
but what is remarkable about 2021 is 
that Democrats did directly legislate a 
big chunk of this inflation into exist-
ence. It is unusually traceable to delib-
erate policy decisions they have made. 
One of the most famous Democratic 
economists in the country, Larry Sum-
mers, tried to warn them. On February 
4, he wrote that the Democrats’ stim-
ulus could ‘‘set off inflationary pres-
sures of a kind we have not seen in a 
generation.’’ He said the same thing all 
springtime long. 
So did President Obama’s CEA chair: 
Jason Furman . . . said that the American 
Rescue Plan is definitely ‘‘too big for the 
moment,’’ stating, ‘‘I don’t know of any 
economist that was recommending some-
thing the size of what was done.’’ 
But Washington Democrats had al-
ready decided months ago they would 
try to use the temporary pandemic as a 
Trojan horse for permanent socialism. 
Remember last spring, when one of 
the 
senior-most 
House 
Democrats 
called it a ‘‘tremendous opportunity to 
restructure things to fit our vision’’ or, 
earlier this fall, when President Biden 
himself 
said 
the 
pandemic 
‘‘does 
present us with an opportunity.’’ 
For Democrats, this go-around, it has 
never been about what families need; it 
has only been about what activists 
want. 
So we got the first massive spending 
bill in the springtime, and now a ma-
jority of Americans ‘‘worry they won’t 
be able to afford what they need during 
the holidays due to inflation.’’ 
President Biden inherited an econ-
omy that was primed and ready for a 
historic comeback—a fantastic inherit-
ance. Since then, they have had less 
than a year at the controls, and we 
have got more than half the country 
actively worried their checking ac-
counts 
might 
not 
even 
get 
them 
through the holidays. 
But Democrats aren’t offering the 
country any contrition, any apology, 
or, more importantly, any course cor-
rection. Amazingly enough, they want 
to come back around for an even bigger 
bite at the apple. They want to try to 
inflate their way out of inflation. 
Our colleagues have spent months 
huddled behind closed doors, neglecting 
the most basic governing duties, writ-
ing another reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree that even the most conserv-
ative estimates say would add about 
$800 billion to deficits over the next 5

years alone. They want to take the in-
flationary fire they helped start and 
pour jet fuel on it. Even the CBO, 
which has to swallow most of the 
Democrats’ gimmicky math, estimates 
this bill would spend nearly $2 trillion 
and pile almost hundreds of billions 
more onto deficits over the next dec-
ade. 
Perhaps more realistic are the out-
side, nonpartisan estimates that actu-
ally account for what we all know: 
Democrats would never let the new en-
titlements in their bill expire. Those 
more realistic estimates put the total 
cost—listen to this—just short of $5 
trillion, at a time when Chairman Pow-
ell, who has been willing to let the 
country run hot, is now warning that 
current uncertainties could keep infla-
tion elevated to a troubling level. 
Now, I could talk all day about how 
the actual contents of this bill would 
hurt American families even more, 
about how it would take another big 
step toward socialized medicine and 
pour cold water on the innovations and 
cures that save lives, how it would in-
cinerate huge chunks of our energy 
sector and the jobs it supports in order 
to keep pace with green preferences of 
California liberals, how it would wres-
tle authority over intimate decisions 
about childcare away from American 
families and put it in the hands of 
Washington bureaucrats, but the over-
all picture is impossible to mistake: In-
flation is hurting the American people, 
and Democrats want to print, borrow, 
and spend trillions more—the most 
out-of-touch agenda you could possibly 
imagine. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
ABORTION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, tomor-
row the Supreme Court will hear oral 
arguments in the Dobbs case, which 
deals with a Mississippi law that would 
prohibit most abortions after 15 weeks 
of pregnancy. This case offers the best 
opportunity in many years to see Roe 
v. Wade overturned or modified—some-
thing that is long overdue. 
Roe v. Wade was a bad decision that 
should long ago have been reversed. 
Legal scholars from across the ideolog-
ical spectrum have criticized the deci-
sion, noting, in the words of one ex-
pert: 
As constitutional argument, Roe is barely 
coherent. The court pulled its fundamental 
right to choose more or less from the con-
stitutional ether. 
As another legal scholar put it, Roe 
is ‘‘a very bad decision . . . because it 
is bad constitutional law, or rather be-
cause it is not constitutional law and 
gives almost no sense of an obligation 
to try to be.’’ 
Now, I should note that both of the 
individuals I just quoted are actually 
supportive—supportive—of 
abortion. 
But like many others, both recognize 
that Roe is simply bad law. 
In the Roe decision, the Supreme 
Court reached far beyond the Constitu-
tion in the Court’s interpretive role to 
impose a new abortion regime on the 
entire country, and it is past time for 
this unconstitutional decision to be 
overturned and for the Court to return 
jurisdiction 
over 
abortion 
to 
the 
States. 
It is important to note that over-
turning Roe would do just that: return 
jurisdiction over abortion to the States 
and to elected officials who can be held 
accountable for the decisions and ulti-
mately to the American people. 
Many assume, incorrectly, that over-
turning Roe would somehow automati-
cally ban abortion nationwide. It would 
not. It would simply return jurisdic-
tion to the people’s elected representa-
tives. 
Abortion law would become the do-
main of States and Congress, instead of 
the domain of unelected, activist mem-
bers of the judiciary. 
Members of the radical pro-abortion 
lobby, which controls the abortion 
policies of the Democrat Party, are, of 
course, up in arms over the Dobbs case. 
They are terrified—terrified—that the 
Supreme Court will overturn Roe, and 
I suspect that the root of that fear is 
the knowledge that they need an activ-
ist Court for the radical abortion agen-
da. 
Why? Because the American people 
do not agree with the radical abortion 
lobby on abortion. 
For all its efforts to paint abortion 
on demand at any time up until the 
moment of birth as the only possible 
position, the pro-abortion lobby has 
completely 
failed 
to 
convince 
the 
American people. 
Polls consistently show that a strong 
majority of the American people sup-
port at least some restrictions on abor-
tion. Gallup has been polling on abor-
tion for decades, and in all that time, 
the percentage of Americans who be-
lieve abortion should be legal under 
any circumstance has always remained 
under 35 percent. In fact, for most of 
the past several decades, that number 
has remained squarely under 30 per-
cent. 
An Associated Press poll from this 
June found that 65 percent of Ameri-
cans believe that abortion should gen-
erally be illegal in the second tri-
mester—or from about 13 weeks of 
pregnancy—while a whopping 80 per-
cent of Americans believe that abor-
tion should generally be illegal in the 
third trimester. And it is no surprise. 
Despite the abortion lobby’s at-
tempts to dehumanize unborn children 
and portray them as nothing more than 
clumps of cells or unwanted growths, 
most Americans are well aware that an 
unborn child is a baby, a human being, 
an innocent human being. 
And because Americans generally 
gravitate toward justice and the de-
fense of human rights and vulnerable 
human beings, they remain—despite 
the best efforts of the abortion lobby— 
fundamentally uncomfortable with un-
restricted abortion. 
And so I think the root of the abor-
tion lobby’s outrage is the knowledge 
that if Roe is overturned, their radical 
abortion agenda is unlikely to prevail 
nationwide because the American peo-
ple simply do not agree with them on 
abortion. 
The pro-abortion lobby and its allies 
in the Democrat Party would like 
Americans to believe that Mississippi’s 
15-week abortion ban is extreme, rad-
ical legislation. Well, nothing could be 
further from the truth. 
In fact, the United States of Amer-
ica—the United States of America—is a 
radical outlier on abortion. We are one 
of only seven countries in the world 
that allows elective abortion past 20 
weeks—one of just seven countries in 
the entire world. Among those other 
countries are China and North Korea, 
not exactly the kind of company you 
want to be keeping when it comes to 
defending human rights. 
Forty-seven out of fifty European 
countries—47 out of 50—either require 
women to have a specific reason for 
seeking an abortion or limit elective 
abortion to 15 weeks or earlier. Thirty- 
two 
European 
countries, 
including 
France, Denmark, Switzerland, Nor-
way, and many others, limit elective 
abortion to at or before 12 weeks’ ges-
tation. 
Now, let’s consider that for just a 
minute. A substantial majority of Eu-
ropean countries limit abortion to at 
or before 12 weeks. In other words, Mis-
sissippi’s 15-week abortion law is not 
on the radical fringe when it comes to 
abortion; it is squarely in the main-
stream for Western democracies, and it 
is, in fact, more permissive than the 
abortion laws of a majority of Euro-
pean countries. And yet the abortion 
lobby would have us believe that Mis-
sissippi is pushing some kind of ex-
treme abortion legislation. 
Let’s talk about unborn babies at 15 
weeks. Fifteen-week-old unborn chil-
dren have fully developed hearts that 
have already beaten more than 15 mil-
lion times. They yawn. They make fa-
cial 
expressions. 
They 
suck 
their 
thumbs. They respond to taste and 
touch. 
Scientific 
evidence 
suggests 
that they can feel pain. 
Pro-abortion activists may not like 
to hear it, but scientific evidence 
shows that the neural connections nec-
essary to transmit pain are fully in 
place by around 20 weeks and that ba-
bies may actually begin to experience 
pain as early as 12 weeks. 
So when we are talking about a 15- 
week-old unborn baby, we are talking 
about a baby who may very well al-
ready be able to experience pain and 
will certainly be able to experience it a 
few weeks later, if she can’t now. Yet 
in this country, it is perfectly legal to 
kill unborn children who are able to

feel pain and kill them with an abor-
tion procedure so brutal and barbaric it 
is difficult to even describe. 
Yet it needs to be mentioned because 
we need to acknowledge the reality 
that we are killing unborn babies in 
this country capable of feeling pain, 
using a widely employed abortion pro-
cedure that involves dismembering the 
unborn child. As I said, it is incredibly 
hard—in fact, it is heartbreaking, real-
ly—to even talk about it. 
The abortion lobby would like to 
draw a veil over what happens inside 
abortion clinics, but the truth is that 
abortions are brutal and inhumane— 
certainly to the baby but, in many re-
spects, to the mother as well. 
Since the Supreme Court handed 
down the Roe v. Wade decision, there 
have been an estimated 62 million-plus 
abortions in the United States. That 
number is so big, it is pretty much 
unfathomable. To put it in some kind 
of perspective, 62 million is nearly 
three times the population of the en-
tire State of Florida. That is how many 
unique, unrepeatable human beings we 
have lost to abortion since Roe. 
We are better than this, and we have 
to do better than this. Our country was 
founded to safeguard human rights. We 
haven’t always lived up to that prom-
ise, but we have never stopped trying. 
And it is time for us to continue that 
work by standing up for the most vul-
nerable human beings among us: the 
unborn children, whose human rights 
are not protected and whose lives can 
be taken away at any time. 
Thanks to medical advancements, it 
is possible for babies born at 22 weeks 
to survive outside their mothers. It is 
also perfectly legal to kill unborn chil-
dren at 22 weeks. Now, something is 
radically wrong with that picture. 
How can an unborn child of 22 weeks 
be regarded as a human being worthy 
of protection in one case and in the 
other case be regarded as nothing but a 
clump of cells to be disposed of in an 
abortion clinic? 
The cognitive dissonance is mind- 
boggling. 
The more we learn about unborn chil-
dren, the more we see their humanity. 
It is impossible to look at an unborn 
baby kicking her feet and sucking her 
thumb on an ultrasound and see her as 
anything but the human being that she 
is. Science, medical advancements, and 
plain old common sense all point inex-
orably to the humanity of the unborn 
child. 
And human beings deserve to be pro-
tected. A good place to start would be 
with laws like Mississippi’s, laws that 
would bring us into the mainstream of 
abortion laws worldwide. As I have 
said, the United States is one of just 
seven countries in the entire world, in-
cluding China and North Korea, that 
allow elective abortion past 20 weeks of 
pregnancy. I would like to think that 
we can do a better job of protecting un-
born children’s human rights than 
China and North Korea. 
So I hope that the Supreme Court 
will uphold Mississippi’s law and open 
the door to greater protection for un-
born children. But win or lose—win or 
lose—I and many, many, many others 
will continue to stand up for the 
human rights of unborn Americans; 
and I am confident that, in the end, 
right and justice and life will prevail.

NOMINATION OF COREY HINDERSTEIN 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I have the 
responsibility and the privilege to be 
the chair of something called the Stra-
tegic Forces Subcommittee of the 
Committee on Armed Services. 
Strategic forces is a euphemism for 
nuclear weapons, and it is one of the 
most serious threats that we continue 
to face. We face threats all over the 
world from pandemics, from terrorism, 
from a rising China, from a belligerent 
Russia, but one of the most serious 
that sometimes gets lost in the discus-
sion is the unthinkable catastrophe 
that would be a nuclear exchange. 
Throughout the last 70-plus years, 
our principle strategy for dealing with 
that threat has been deterrence, the 
idea that if you use nuclear weapons 
against the United States of America, 
you will pay the heaviest of prices, and 
that deterrence has worked. There 
hasn’t been a use of nuclear weapon 
since 1945, and there are now several— 
I can’t say the exact number for classi-
fication reasons—but there are a num-
ber of nuclear countries in the world, 
nuclear-armed countries, China and 
Russia among them. China is expand-
ing its nuclear capability exponen-
tially. Over the past several years, 
they have been embarked on an enor-
mous buildup of their nuclear capa-
bility. 
But I want to talk about a nuclear 
threat today in the context of the nom-
ination that I am going to move in a 
few moments that, to me, is one of the 
most terrifying because it is a nuclear 
threat that deterrence doesn’t work 
on—a nuclear threat that deterrence, 
the fundamental strategy of our pre-
vention of nuclear conflict for 70 years, 
doesn’t work. 
What is that threat? The threat of 
nuclear terrorism. If you are not rep-
resenting a country and if you don’t 
care about dying, then the idea of a nu-
clear response doesn’t scare you. It 
doesn’t deter you from taking that 
kind of action. 
How do we defend against that? What 
is deterrence 2.0 in the current world 
where 
international 
terrorism—al-
though it has not been on the front 
pages recently—is still there? 
ISIS-K, ISIS, al-Qaida, al-Qaida in 
the Arabian Peninsula are all still 
there. Boko Haram in Africa—they are 
all still there. They are all plotting. 
They are all working on ways that they 
can attack the West and the United 
States of America. 
If they could get ahold of the nuclear 
technology and nuclear building block, 
which is enriched uranium, they would 
use it. The terrorists who killed 3,000 
people on September 11 would kill— 
would have killed 3 million if they 
could have. 
And so keeping nuclear materials and 
nuclear technology out of the hands of 
terrorists is, to me, one of the most im-
portant functions that our government 
can perform. 
And that brings me to the nomina-
tion of Corey Hinderstein for the posi-
tion of Deputy Administrator for Nu-
clear Nonproliferation. She is im-
mensely qualified and has worked in 
this field for almost 20 years; has 
worked on nuclear proliferation and 
nonproliferation issues for most of 
those years, both in the government 
and in the private sector. I would ven-
ture to say there is probably no one in 
the United States who knows as much 
about this subject as she does. 
Ms. Hinderstein will be responsible 
for a major part of the budget—$1.9 bil-
lion—but she is responsible for control-
ling the proliferation of nuclear mate-
rials, and that is so critical in light of 
the threat of nuclear terrorism. The 
only way we can keep them from at-
tacking us is intelligence, knowing 
what is coming, and keeping these ma-
terials out of their hands; and that is 
why this job is so important. 
She was approved by the committee 
and recommended to the Senate 40 
days ago. It is time to move this nomi-
nation. Nominations can be held up for 
a variety of reasons and some policy 
reasons, and I understand that, but not 
in this case. And I am happy to report 
that it appears that this nomination 
will not be held up because I think all 
of our colleagues realize how important 
this function is in the government. 
The most—the best nuclear strike is 
the one that doesn’t occur. The only 
way to prevent that is to stop the pro-
liferation of nuclear materials. This 
problem is only growing. We know that 
Iran is now enriching uranium to a 
much higher extent than they did 
under the JCPOA. We know that North 
Korea is pursuing its own nuclear am-
bitions. India, Pakistan both have nu-
clear programs. So this is a clear and 
present danger to the United States of

BUILD BACK BETTER 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, our 
Democratic colleagues in the House 
and, to some extent, here in the Senate 
have talked about how the so-called 
Build Back Better legislation is pop-
ular, but I think the main reason it is 
popular is because, frankly, many 
Members of Congress and certainly the 
public at large don’t know what is in 
it. So I would like to spend just a few 
minutes talking about that. 
First of all, there is the size of the 
bill. Originally, the Budget Committee 
chairman, the Senator from Vermont, 
floated a $6 trillion spending bonanza. 
This, of course, was on top of about $5 
trillion we spent last year in a bipar-
tisan fashion dealing with the COVID– 
19 pandemic. But, of course, this $6 tril-
lion more was designed to be passed 
with a pure party-line vote through the 
reconciliation process. 
After some pushback, the $6 trillion 
figure that Chairman SANDERS
pro-
posed was cut back to 3.5, and now our 
colleagues in the House and elsewhere 
are touting a new pared-down bill 
which spends only—and I underline the 
word ‘‘only’’—$1.75 trillion. I dare say 
that is a number that none of us can 
fully comprehend given its magnitude, 
but it has become—sort of rolls off our 
tongues like everybody understands 
what a trillion dollars is like every-
body knows what a million is or a 
thousand or a hundred or ten dollars. 
But it is an enormous number. 
As our colleagues have slimmed and 
trimmed this bill to reach a pricetag 
that could get consensus in the House, 
some of their favorite provisions have 
fallen off the chopping block. They re-
alize that programs like free college 
actually cost a whole lot of money. So 
to live within this new number, which 
I will talk about in a moment, Demo-
crats in the House kept cutting and 
cutting, but they found—instead of real 
cuts, they found another solution to 
their problem of a topline. What they 
have basically done is to create the il-
lusion of a lower pricetag without 
making any real, substantive, long- 
term cuts. How do you do that? Well, it 
is the old-fashioned way; it is called 
budget gimmicks. 
Rather than remove these expensive 
programs entirely, they chose to create 
a number of arbitrary cliffs, sunsets, 
and expirations. That way, they could 
pretend to pass these bills at a lower 
cost with the tacit promise to continue 
them at another time and on another 
day. 
One example of this was the expanded 
child tax credit. Our Democratic col-
leagues originally crafted this as a 
temporary measure in their partisan 
bill that became law in March, just 8 
months ago. The first payments had 
barely gone out the door when they de-
cided to call for making those tem-
porary provisions permanent in the 
BBB, the so-called Build Back Better 
bill. Our colleagues knew that a perma-
nent extension and expansion would 
have been far too expensive to meet 
their topline, so they pretended to cut 
it by making it a temporary extension. 
Earlier drafts of this bill would have 
extended this policy through 2025. As 
time went on, the pricetag was still too 
high, so it was scaled back to a 1-year 
extension. But the truth is, nothing 
has really changed. Calls to make the 
expansion permanent have not gone 
away. I have seen no indication that 
our colleagues across the aisle are con-
tent to let this extension expire after 
just 1 year. 
The same is true of the earned in-
come tax credit, which also was ex-
panded in March. A number of our col-
leagues have spoken here on the Senate 
floor about the need to make this ex-
pansion of the earned income tax credit 
permanent. 
But the not-so-temporary extensions 
don’t end there. This bill extends the 
Affordable Care Act’s premium tax 
credits through 2025, which our col-
leagues claim will enable more Ameri-
cans to afford healthcare coverage. But 
at the same time, this bill cuts funding 
to safety net hospitals and States that 
did not expand Medicaid. If their goal 
was to expand access to low-income in-
dividuals under the Medicaid Program, 
their bill cuts that funding to safety 
net hospitals in States like mine that 
did not expand Medicaid. These cuts 
specifically target hospitals that treat 
underinsured and uninsured patients. 
In short, our colleagues are manipu-
lating the budget process in a way that 
appears to extend access to healthcare 
while at the same time cuts funding to 
our most vulnerable patients—all in 
the cause of pushing America closer to 
a single-payer system, something like 
Medicare for All. I have no doubt that 
our colleagues across the aisle will, if 
possible, not let these temporary provi-
sions expire. 
In the immortal words of Ronald 
Reagan, though, ‘‘The closest thing to 
eternal life on earth is a [temporary] 
government program.’’ 
We have seen this movie before, time 
and again. It is smoke and mirrors. It 
is budget gimmickry. It is starting new 
programs and claiming to cut them off 
after a year, knowing that, inevitably, 
Congress will be tempted to extend 
them much, much longer. 
Well, before this bill comes to a vote 
in the Senate, I hope our Democratic 
colleagues will agree with me that we 
need to know precisely how much this 
bill will cost the American people. We 
know that our colleagues across the 
aisle have struggled to try to make a $6 
trillion bill appear to be a $3.5 trillion 
and now a $1.75 trillion bill, but I don’t 
think anybody is really fooled or con-
fused. Because they have strategically 
chosen start dates, sunsets, and expira-
tion dates to make it appear that these 
programs cost less, we know that even-
tually, if they have the votes, they will 
be extended through eternity. 
Our colleagues gamed the Tax Code 
to partially fund the bill while handing 
out massive tax breaks to millionaires 
and billionaires. I am glad to see the 
chairman of the Budget Committee say 
that we really shouldn’t be focused on 
tax cuts to millionaires and billion-
aires in blue States and cities like New 
York or San Francisco, which is ex-
actly what the Democratic bill tries to 
provide—tax cuts to millionaires and 
billionaires in blue States. 
This bill is really chock-full of incon-
sistencies. It claims to extend access to 
healthcare while cutting off access to 
Medicaid or some of the safety net pro-
grams in States like mine. It claims 
that, well, we are going to tax the rich 
folks while at the same time providing

tax cuts to millionaires and billion-
aires in blue States by lifting or elimi-
nating the SALT deduction—the State 
and local tax deduction—which allows 
taxpayers, these millionaires and bil-
lionaires in blue States, to deduct their 
State and local taxes, which means not 
only do they get a tax cut, but the rest 
of us end up subsidizing them because, 
in order to get the revenue needed, 
that means regular working folks are 
going to have to pick up the gap. 
The best evidence of this maneu-
vering is the fact that there is not a 
single year over the next decade in 
which each tax provision would be used 
at the same time. Let me say that 
again. Of all of the gaming in the Tax 
Code, the fact is, under the proposal by 
the House of Representatives—that we 
at some point will consider here—the 
fact is there is not a single year over 
the next decade in which each of these 
tax provisions would be used at the 
same time. This is nothing but gim-
micks and sleight of hand accounting. 
In my previous life, I was the Attor-
ney General of Texas. We had some-
thing called the Consumer Protection 
Division. If anybody in the private sec-
tor would falsely advertise, like the 
Federal Government and Congress are 
trying to do in this so-called Build 
Back Better bill, we would go after 
them with a vengeance for defrauding 
consumers. Unfortunately, that doesn’t 
apply to Congress. I wish it did. 
We often talk, at least intermit-
tently, about needing to know what is 
in a bill before we actually vote on it. 
At one time or another, Senators on 
both sides of the aisle have griped 
about voting on thousand-page bills 
that were completed just hours before 
the vote. Knowing the true cost of this 
legislation is no different. Before vot-
ing on it, we have the duty to under-
stand how it will impact our debt and 
deficits and how big of a bill the Amer-
ican people will be stuck with. 
There 
is 
also 
this 
ugly 
animal 
rearing its head called inflation. Sev-
enty percent of the public said—I think 
in a recent public opinion poll I have 
seen—that inflation is eating away 
more and more of their income and is 
actually reducing their standard of liv-
ing. It is a silent tax on working fami-
lies. I would think that, if we are con-
cerned about the welfare of those fami-
lies, we ought to be very concerned 
about making inflation worse by pour-
ing more and more money into our 
economy, chasing fewer and fewer 
goods and services. 
That is part of the problem now. 
There is so much money sloshing 
around as a result of the spending by 
Congress—much of it associated with 
COVID–19, but not all of it. Some of it 
is with the American Recovery Act 
that was passed with the $1.9 trillion in 
the early days of the Biden administra-
tion. But the truth is inflation is eat-
ing our lunch, and we should not be 
making it worse by spending a lot more 
money, as our Democratic colleagues 
are proposing we do in the Build Back 
Better bill. 
So we need a cost estimate by the 
Congressional Budget Office, the offi-
cial scorer of these spending bills, be-
cause we know that what we have seen 
so far is full of gimmicks, tricks, phony 
cliffs, phony expiration dates, as I have 
said, and is, basically, a misleading of 
the public and Congress into knowing 
what exactly is in this bill and how 
much it will cost. 
Well, the cost estimate provided by 
the CBO, we know, given these phony 
assumptions, is not an accurate state-
ment of the true cost of the bill. This 
isn’t a reflection of the folks who work 
at the CBO but of the scoring rules 
they must follow. So, despite the fact 
that our Democratic colleagues have 
explicitly said that temporary pro-
grams will be extended at the first op-
portunity beyond the terms laid out in 
the bill, the Congressional Budget Of-
fice has to play along and act like that 
is true, but we know it is not true. 
Fortunately, there are groups on the 
outside that have conducted their own 
analysis. Assuming all of these phony 
cliffs and expiration dates and the 1- 
year creation of programs that will 
later be extended, they don’t have to 
buy this sort of smoke-and-mirrors ap-
proach to the budget. These groups 
have conducted their own analyses and 
have told us what they think the true 
cost of this $1.75 trillion bill, so-called, 
that passed the House will be. 
For example, the budget experts at 
the University of Pennsylvania’s Whar-
ton School of Business have analyzed 
this legislation as if these temporary 
provisions would be made permanent, 
which, I think, is the safest assumption 
to make. So, instead of $1.75 trillion, 
they have pegged the cost as close to 
$4.6 trillion over 10 years—more than 
21⁄2 times the amount the Democrats 
have claimed. 
Then there is the Committee for a 
Responsible 
Federal 
Budget 
that 
thinks that the number could even be a 
few hundred billion higher than that. 
They estimate the true cost of this bill, 
now claimed to be $1.75 trillion, to be 
approximately $5 trillion. This is a 
massive, massive jump from what the 
Democrats have said the cost of this 
bill will be. 
Even one of our colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle has acknowl-
edged that this is disingenuous—and I 
would just use the word ‘‘false’’—adver-
tising. The true cost of this legislation 
is much closer to Chairman SANDERS’ 
original $6 trillion request than the so- 
called scaled-back proposal of the cur-
rent bill. 
Before this legislation comes to the 
Senate floor, we need to see a true cost 
estimate based on reasonable assump-
tions, not a fairy tale scenario. It de-
fies all common sense to vote on a bill 
without knowing how much it is going 
to cost ahead of time. 
To this end, last week, I sent a letter 
to the leaders of the Congressional 
Budget Office and of the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation requesting an up-
dated estimate based on more reason-
able assumptions. If the temporary 
provisions of this bill are extended— 
and I fully expect them to be if our 
Democratic colleagues have the votes 
to do it—this legislation will cost a 
whole lot more than what the Amer-
ican people have been told; and we need 
to know, as close as we can, exactly 
how much that will be. 
Well, it is obvious what is going on 
here. These not-so-temporary provi-
sions won’t expire in a year or 4 years 
or 10 years. We need to operate under 
rational assumptions that our Demo-
cratic colleagues, when the chance is 
provided to them, will make these pro-
grams permanent and come up with a 
true and honest score for the bill. If 
this legislation is all of a sound invest-
ment as our Democratic colleagues 
claim, they shouldn’t have anything to 
be afraid of. 
We do have a duty, I believe, as Mem-
bers of Congress, in voting on legisla-
tion of this magnitude, to know what 
we are doing before we are asked to 
vote on it. I don’t think anybody, real-
ly, should have anything to be afraid 
of, unless they are afraid of a true ac-
counting as opposed to the smoke and 
mirrors we see so far on this phony, 
gimmickry bill.

Independence County Sheriff’s Depart-
ment as a patrol deputy. 
He had a passion for serving and pro-
tecting, and he followed through on 
that desire by becoming a law enforce-
ment officer, sworn to uphold the law 
and safeguard the vulnerable. 
Those who knew him, both in uni-
form and out, consistently described 
him as a good man. Even for someone 
so young, there is no better com-
pliment to be paid than that. It is a 
testament to the way he lived his life— 
doing the right thing, meeting his obli-
gations, and showing genuine care and 
compassion for others. 
Although his passing did not come at 
the hands of a suspect, it stings just 
the same. It should remind us of the 
harrowing, uncertain fate that awaits 
every man or woman who wears a 
badge. 
These citizen servants are not guar-
anteed comfort or safety or the oppor-
tunity to see the next day when they 
clock in, but they choose to shoulder 
the risk, put on their uniform, and step 
out the door, reporting for duty to pro-
tect and serve and do good in ways that 
are just as often unseen as seen. 
While danger comes in different 
forms throughout a shift or career, it 
nevertheless always lurks nearby. No 
assignment is ever completely without 
hazards or without jeopardy. Yet our 
police, sheriffs, and troopers do the job 
anyway because they have been called 
to and because they understand the 
need is great, even if the odds are long 
or the numbers are too few. 
That is what sets Deputy Ramirez 
and his colleagues apart. They run to-
ward danger and uncertainty when the 
rest of us flee. We must always remem-
ber and honor these fallen heroes and 
pray the character they embody carries 
on to new generations. 
But today, we are here to reflect on 
the life and sacrifice of one, Deputy 
Frank Ramirez, Jr., a noble, brave, 
public servant, a devoted husband and 
father, a protector of this community, 
and as so many have already remem-
bered, a good man. 
On behalf of all Arkansans, we are 
grateful for his dedication and his sac-
rifice. Our prayers are with his loved 
ones and the brothers and sisters in 
blue left to go on without him after his 
End of Watch. 
The thin blue line is without one 
more courageous officer today, but 
Deputy Ramirez’s legacy will help in-
still even greater pride and passion 
among its ranks because of the life he 
lived and gave for the benefit of so 
many others. 
May he rest in peace, and may God 
comfort all who mourn him. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
sadly join my colleague and friend Sen-
ator BOOZMAN to honor the life and 
service of Frank Ramirez. 
Every time that a police officer kiss-
es his or her family goodbye before 
their shift, every time they strap a side 
arm on or put on their badge, they 
know that it may be the last time they 
see their loved ones. These heroes ac-
cept that danger because the love of 
their 
families, 
neighborhoods, 
and 
communities is greater than any fear 
they may face on the job. 
Our men and women in blue don’t 
just talk about doing good, they actu-
ally do it each and every day. Sadly, 
far too many of them have had to make 
the ultimate sacrifice in the course of 
their service. 
One such hero was Arkansas Sheriff’s 
Deputy Frank Ramirez. A week before 
Thanksgiving, Deputy Ramirez was 
working after midnight when a call 
went out there was an accident. He an-
swered the call and quickly drove to-
ward the scene. But it was raining hard 
that evening. Roadways were slick. 
And as Deputy Ramirez rounded a left 
turn on Highway 14, he lost control of 
his car, ran into a culvert, and was 
sadly killed in the resulting crash. 
This 
heartbreaking 
tragedy 
has 
brought countless Arkansans to their 
knees in prayer. Deputy Ramirez was 
serving his community when he died. 
There are few causes more noble, and 
we recognize his supreme sacrifice and 
promise to remember him. 
Deputy Ramirez was a husband of 5 
years and a father of two young chil-
dren, a son and a daughter. He is also 
survived by both his parents and sev-
eral loving brothers and sisters. 
My prayers, Senator BOOZMAN’s pray-
ers, and the prayers of all Arkansans 
go out to his family. They, too, have 
paid an unbelievable price in the serv-
ice of our State, our communities, and 
our safety. 
Deputy Ramirez was only 29 years 
old. He served in the Batesville Police 
Department 
and 
the 
Independence 
County Sheriff’s Office. He was in law 
enforcement for nearly 21⁄2 years. In 
that short time and at his young age, 
Deputy Ramirez sacrificed more for his 
communities than many police vet-
erans who have been on the force for 
much longer. I join them in saluting 
his service and honoring his sacrifice. 
May God bless Frank Ramirez, may 
God bless his family, and may God 
bless all the brave men and women in 
law 
enforcement 
in 
Arkansas 
and 
around our Nation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL JOHN MEYER 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madame President, 
LTC John Meyer joined my office as 
our defense fellow this past January. It 
is hard to overestimate in the months 
since just how much he has contrib-
uted. 
Time and again, John has drawn on 
his rich background and his experi-
ences in the Middle East, the Pacific, 
and with some of the Army’s most elite 
units to inform our work on defense 
and national security. 
More than that, he has consistently 
stepped up, even when he didn’t have 
to, to help those in need—from vet-
erans and servicemembers at home in 
Missouri to those affected by the bomb-
ing in Kabul over the summer. 
For all of these reasons and more, it 
has been a real privilege to have John 
as a part of our team this year. We are 
going to miss him when he goes all too 
soon here, but I am confident he will 
continue to serve our Nation with the 
utmost distinction wherever his career 
takes him. 
I want to take this opportunity, in 
light of all of that, to request floor 
privileges for John as a small gesture 
of my gratitude for his service to my 
office, to Missouri, and to our Nation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
H.R. 4350 
Mr. MARKEY. Madam President, 60 
years ago, President Dwight David Ei-
senhower warned Americans about the 
unwarranted influence of the military- 
industrial complex. He told us of the 
relentless defense interests that would 
use their lobbying muscle to keep 
money flowing into the coffers of the 
Pentagon. While our adversaries and 
competitors have changed in the past 
six decades, the military-industrial 
complex’s revolving door is as well 
greased as Ike warned our country. 
Today, Congress is set to vote to in-
crease 
the 
already-bloated 
defense 
budget in the same year that we ended 
our longest war—the latest proof that 
the 
military-industrial 
complex 
is 
alive and well and banking on a pay 
raise, all while Americans struggle to 
afford groceries and gasoline. 
Here is the simple truth about the 
defense budget we are debating this 
week: We plan to spend $768 billion to 
fuel the military-industrial complex 
even in our moment of relative peace. 
Yet many in this Chamber are relent-
lessly attacking the Build Back Better 
act despite this spending bill being four 
times its size in new spending. 
What we are hearing in this Chamber 
this week are Cold War echoes—words 
that sound like talk of the bomber and 
the missile gap with the former Soviet 
Union that drove an arms race that 
brought us to the brink of annihila-
tion. 
Our top military general recently 
called China’s most recent hypersonic 
test a ‘‘Sputnik moment.’’ That is our 
top military general. But how in the 
world can it be a ‘‘Sputnik moment’’ if 
we are set to spend more on defense 
than the next 11 countries combined, 
many of which are U.S. allies and part-
ners? There is no technological or mili-
tary gap that we need to close. We have 
the strongest military in the world. 
Our rivals, our adversaries are not 10 
feet tall. We are the country that is 10

feet tall, and they are looking up at us 
militarily. We should just understand 
this, as people bad-mouth our military. 
It is not accurate. They are afraid of 
us. We are technologically superior to 
them, whoever they may be. 
But wait. As if we weren’t spending 
enough, Congress has tossed in an addi-
tional $25 billion that was not even re-
quested by the Pentagon in this year’s 
budget. You heard that right—an addi-
tional $25 billion. How many kids could 
go to pre-K for that? How many seniors 
could get dental or vision coverage? 
How many public housing units could 
we build with that, with the money 
that has not even been requested by 
the Pentagon? 
We should not accept the logic that 
says we can afford to build a $100 bil-
lion intercontinental ballistic missile 
that will never be used but we cannot 
possibly afford paid family leave that 
Americans desperately need. 
Universal prekindergarten is too ex-
pensive, but padding the wallets of de-
fense firm executives with taxpayer 
dollars is money well spent. That is in-
sane. That is immoral. 
We should not have to fight tooth 
and nail to meet our commitment to 
replenish the Green Climate Fund to 
help save the planet while being told to 
accept the need for new weapons sys-
tems that could lead to global annihi-
lation. 
It is time we stop thinking of na-
tional security solely in terms of our 
inventory of bombers and missiles and 
submarines. Trillions in defense spend-
ing did nothing to spare Americans 
from the greatest security threat in 
generations: COVID–19. We have to 
stop pretending that there are military 
solutions to the national security chal-
lenges that we face. The defense a fam-
ily needs right now is protection from 
eviction, hunger, electricity shut off, 
and pollution. 
Being strong on defense means learn-
ing critical lessons from the two-dec-
ade-long war in Afghanistan. Being 
strong on defense means that we do not 
shy away from telling the military-in-
dustrial complex and its army of lobby-
ists that we do not need to outspend 
our adversaries into oblivion. 
Nowhere has the gold-plated defense 
industry been harder at work than in 
gilding the whopping $1.5 trillion we 
are projected to spend through 2046 on 
upgrading our nuclear weapons enter-
prise. Say that again—$1.5 trillion on 
more nuclear weapons. There is one 
thing this country and this world does 
not need, and that is more nuclear 
weapons. 
We know that fear and distrust of an 
adversary’s intentions empower voices 
in the defense bureaucracy to sell new 
capabilities that spur the other side to 
justify weapon systems of their own. 
But we must avoid a rerun of the Cold 
War, where worst-case military plan-
ning leads to thousands of missiles 
pointed at Washington, Moscow, and 
Beijing, once again casting a terrible 
shadow over humanity. 
That is why I introduced amend-
ments to the NDAA that would trim 
$75 billion off the nuclear weapons en-
terprise, commit to robust diplomacy 
with Russia and China, and prevent the 
President—any President, Democratic 
or Republican—from firing the first 
shot, the first nuclear weapon in a nu-
clear war. The United States should 
never be first to launch a nuclear weap-
on against another country—ever. That 
should just be our policy. We will not 
be the first to use nuclear weapons 
when we have not been attacked with 
nuclear weapons. That is immoral. 
That is wrong. It must be the policy of 
our country that we will not do that. 
If it is true what Ronald Reagan 
said—that a ‘‘nuclear war cannot be 
won and must never be fought’’—then 
surely we should agree to shelve Don-
ald Trump’s new sea-based warfighting 
nuclear weapons. 
We could play Russian roulette with 
our future or we can adopt a saner nu-
clear policy, one that says we do not 
need the rubble to bounce over and 
over and over again to deter our adver-
saries and reassure our allies; one, 
through the President’s Nuclear Pos-
ture Review, that rejects the military- 
industrial complex efforts to make the 
world safe for nuclear weapons rather 
than from nuclear weapons. 
In 2020, the amount of money that 
one of the five biggest defense contrac-
tors received from the Pentagon—$75 
billion—was nearly double the entire 
development and diplomacy accounts 
at the State Department and the U.S. 
Agency for Development. 
As President Biden noted in Glasgow 
at the international climate summit 
earlier this month, we have an obliga-
tion to help the developing world leap-
frog the fossil fuel economy to reach a 
green economy. Lower and middle-in-
come countries deserve to develop and 
seek a higher standard of living, but we 
know that they can’t use the dirty 
fuels that powered our growth if we 
hope to keep global warming at 1.5 de-
grees Celsius. My climate amendment 
will help those countries least to blame 
for the climate crisis to adapt to the 
impacts that they are already over-
whelmingly and disproportionately ex-
periencing. 
The first of its kind National Intel-
ligence Estimate, released in October, 
warned 
us 
that 
the 
intensity 
of 
wildfires and the force of hurricane 
winds and unrelenting droughts are a 
mere preview of the extreme weather 
events to come. The Pentagon’s own 
report warns us of the cascading secu-
rity impacts if we fail to answer the 
national security challenge of our gen-
eration: Governments that are unable 
to meet the basic needs of their people 
risk collapse. Driven by the climate 
crisis, water, food, and resource scar-
city will lead millions to flood across 
borders as stateless climate refugees. 
That will lead to destabilization of 
countries. That will lead to national 
security crises in country after coun-
try as a result of the climate crisis. 
We have to just deal with the reality 
that the CO2 is still red, white, and 
blue that is up there. We are the leader 
historically, and the rest of the world 
wants us to be the leader historically 
right now in dealing with that crisis. 
My climate amendment says that we 
can avoid that grim future. We can re-
direct a mere 1 percent from the Pen-
tagon topline towards global climate 
accounts to fight the climate crisis. We 
can come to grips with the fact that 
the greatest adversary we face is not a 
foreign army, navy, or air force; it is 
the transnational threats of the cli-
mate crisis, of pandemics, and of nu-
clear weapons. 
We are not in a new Cold War. We are 
in a war for our common survival. 
Yesterday, in an act of political 
gamesmanship, 
Senate 
Republicans 
joined me to vote against moving for-
ward with this abominable $768 billion 
Defense bill. While I wish we could stop 
here and reassess the waste of three- 
quarters of a trillion dollars spent on 
defense, this was, sadly, just a Repub-
lican ploy to add even more pork onto 
this already fatty legislation. 
Now, I urge my colleagues to support 
Senator SANDERS’ and my amendment 
to return the defense budget to the 
level requested by the President—a 
level of spending which is greater than 
we spent during the Korean war, the 
Vietnam war, and at the height of the 
Cold War. 
Additionally, I urge my colleagues to 
support my amendment—co-sponsored 
by Senators WARREN, PADILLA, BOOKER, 
MERKLEY, and SANDERS—to make a 1- 
percent cut to the Defense authoriza-
tion to increase our support for global 
climate accounts. 
If we do not adopt these changes, I 
cannot, in good conscience, support 
that budget. It is time we stop funding 
the military industrial complex, whose 
profit is based in conflict and annihila-
tion. That is not an investment in our 
future; it is an invitation to destruc-
tion. 
The bottom line is we are either 
going to live together or we are going 
to die together; we are either going to 
know each other or we are going to ex-
terminate each other. 
This is a period where we should be 
talking to our rivals. We should be ne-
gotiating with our rivals. We should be 
trying to reduce the nuclear arsenals. 
We should be trying to reduce the ten-
sion; reduce the paranoia; reduce the 
threat that, by accident, we can actu-
ally fight a nuclear war. 
That is what we should be debating 
here and not just putting all of the ad-
ditional new weapons systems that 
have been on the blueprints of the de-
fense industry for a generation into 
this budget. That takes us in the wrong 
direction, towards less safety, more 
risk. 
The correct vote here is to deal with 
the reality that we have too many nu-
clear weapons already and we haven’t 
sufficiently 
dealt 
with 
the 
threat 
which the climate crisis is going to

pose as a national security risk to our 
country and the rest of the planet. 
Madam President, with that, I yield 
the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, our Na-
tion exists today in a time of relative 
peace, with limited and manageable ac-
tive hostilities threatening U.S. na-
tional security. 
On the horizon, the United States 
faces a militarily ambitious and formi-
dable but not yet insurmountable oppo-
nent in China and in its quest for re-
gional dominance in the Pacific. 
Yet in the face of this new age of 
great power competition, U.S. grand 
strategy continues to operate with out-
dated goals and across all regions of 
the globe, lacking prioritization and 
desperately needing scale. 
After the botched withdrawal from 
Afghanistan and the corresponding dip-
lomatic, military, and humanitarian 
disaster, one would think the instinct 
would be to jettison decades of mili-
tary-industrial groupthink. 
One would think the American peo-
ple, and certainly our men and women 
in uniform, deserve a thorough, ex-
haustive review of what is working and 
the huge swaths of what is failing in 
our military and defense strategy, in-
frastructure, and planning. 
One would think that Congress would 
reclaim powers assigned to it by the 
Constitution to make serious reforms 
to protect the security and prosperity 
of the United States. 
One would think we would reform our 
procurement process and trim the 
bloated, perversely incentivized mili-
tary-industrial complex. 
One would think we would prioritize 
resources toward the largest and most 
imminently looming threats to U.S. 
national security. 
One would think we would burden 
share with our allies where our secu-
rity interests align. 
One would think we, here in the U.S. 
Senate, would take specific steps to 
make sure that failures like the with-
drawal from Afghanistan don’t happen 
again, whether in the Middle East or in 
any other emerging theater of conflict. 
Unfortunately, this year’s National 
Defense Authorization Act fails to put 
the interests of U.S. citizens first. This 
is not the introspective or retrospec-
tive bill that the American people 
should be able to expect and largely 
continues the failed—the failed—poli-
cies of many decades past. The Amer-
ican people and the brave men and 
women of our military deserve better. 
We are, thank heavens, in a time of 
peace, with limited active hostilities. 
Despite that, we remain intimately en-
tangled in the affairs of too many na-
tions abroad. Our troops and equip-
ment scatter every region of the globe. 
We spend billions of dollars supporting, 
supplying, and training allies who, in 
many cases, contribute little to their 
own self-defense, let alone ours. 
We face an ambitious opponent in 
China, as it seeks military dominance 
in the Indo-Pacific region. There is no 
question that while Xi Jinping remains 
in power, the PLA and the PRC will 
not shy away from bold moves and the 
quest for regional hegemony. But the 
U.S. strategy should not presume unre-
strained, offensive intervention; rath-
er, targeted and scaled deterrence 
should frame the mission set across all 
U.S. forces postured in the region. Fur-
ther, the United States should accord-
ingly rescale resources in the war zones 
of 
yesteryear 
to 
appropriately 
prioritize protecting the U.S. homeland 
and military personnel from tomor-
row’s threats. 
Congress is responsible for raising 
and supporting armies, of making war, 
and of ratifying treaties. This bill ne-
glects those responsibilities. 
Regarding Afghanistan, the NDAA 
includes funding and new authorities 
for the nonexistent Afghan security 
forces, along with reimbursements to 
coalition partners for supporting U.S. 
operations and a sense of the Senate on 
future U.S. counterterrorism posture 
postwithdrawal, with little eye toward 
reforming or removing outdated and 
overbroad authorizations for the use of 
military force. 
Perpetuating funding and authority 
to support a nonexisting defense force 
is as much bad foreign policy as it is 
bad fiscal responsibility. We must do 
better. The American people expect 
and deserve for us to do better. 
Additionally, this NDAA fundamen-
tally changes the purpose and the 
scope of the military draft. The new 
purpose is greatly expanded to ‘‘ensure 
a requisite number of personnel with 
the necessary capabilities to meet the 
diverse mobilization needs of the De-
partment of Defense during a national 
emergency.’’ 
Instead of being a seldom-used tool 
only for the most extreme cases of 
compelling national defense, the draft 
could be morphed into compulsory na-
tional service in the face of any emer-
gency. 
Even more troubling is the manda-
tory registration of women for the 
draft. Look, all are immensely grateful 
for the incredible contribution women 
make to our Armed Forces, but that 
participation should never be forced. 
This bill paves that dangerous road 
without due consideration given to its 
impact on young families and single 
parents. 
Further, the policy provides no guar-
antee that women would not be sent di-
rectly to the frontlines of combat, 
alongside 
and 
simultaneously 
with 
able-bodied men. 
While I am opposed to all of the 
NDAA’s changes to the draft, at the 
very least, this body should consider a 
reasonable amendment, a few reason-
able amendments on this front, includ-
ing one of mine that would prohibit the 
disturbing scenario of mothers and fa-
thers being conscripted simultaneously 
out of the same family, leaving their 
children stranded without either par-
ent. It also provides a similar exemp-
tion for single parents. 
I hope this body will consider and 
pass this amendment in the near fu-
ture. I also hope that the body will 
make that unnecessary by, first, pass-
ing an amendment striking that provi-
sion altogether. We don’t need to be ex-
panding the draft, and we shouldn’t be 
making the draft applicable to women. 
This bill further reduces our military 
end strength by over 7,000 servicemem-
bers. Troublingly, the biggest cuts 
come from the Marine Corps and the 
Air Force. And in the face of an aggres-
sive China, the Navy also faces reduc-
tion in Active Forces when it arguably 
should be the first contender for an in-
crease in end strength, not a cut. 
As we pivot toward the Indo-Pacific, 
our naval and our air superiority are 
both vital. We need them. Our with-
drawal from the Middle East should re-
duce the level of Active-Duty Army 
personnel deployed overseas, and yet 
the Army faced a less than 1-percent 
reduction in that specific category. 
This bill places us on a dangerous 
footing regarding future mutual de-
fense commitments. This bill would 
provide a vague, near-authorization for 
the use of military force to defend Tai-
wan against an invasion from China. 
The question of war deserves here, as 
always, its own debate by Congress, 
rather than a haphazard statement of 
policy that may be abused by the exec-
utive branch in order to bring us into a 
new conflict, into a new conflict with-
out the people’s duly elected represent-
atives whose job it is to decide whether 
we go to war to make that decision 
under the light of day and with full de-
bate that the American people can wit-
ness. 
Like NDAAs of old, this bill appro-
priates more funds to procurement 
than anywhere else, with no reforms to 
the bureaucratic barriers that make 
procurement so costly and so ineffi-
cient. 
Finally, this NDAA does not suffi-
ciently bolster our defensive position 
in this hemisphere. The goals outlined 
by this bill are vague and equate to an 
abdication of Congress’s responsibility 
to give the Defense Department in-
structions for a strategic approach to 
the Western Hemisphere. 
It provides blank check authority for 
the Department of Defense to support 
programs and activities for purposes 
including 
institution-building 
to 
countercorruption and to serve human-
itarian infrastructure needs. This at-
tempt at nation-building is misguided, 
and it will not be helpful to us in our 
efforts to deter China. 
Thankfully, there are a few positives 
in this bill for U.S. national defense 
and for the security of the people of 
Utah. 
This bill continues to support the de-
velopment of fifth-generation air power 
capabilities in the F–35 Program, con-
tinuing a critical investment in our air 
defense—something that is also becom-
ing even more important. 
This bill also fully funds the mod-
ernization of our ground-based nuclear

deterrent, protecting the U.S. home-
land for generations to come. This im-
portant work will largely be done by 
the people of Utah and our dedicated 
servicemembers at Hill Air Force Base. 
The House version of the NDAA also 
includes my Military Spouse Licensing 
Relief Act. It is important to note here 
that one in four military spouses cur-
rently face unemployment or are ac-
tively seeking work largely because of 
frequent moves due to their spouse’s 
military orders, which keep them mov-
ing from place to place on a pretty rou-
tine basis. This provision in the House 
version of the bill would also allow 
spouses of our military servicemem-
bers to work in their chosen profession, 
wherever military orders may take 
them in the United States, without 
having to navigate the complicated re-
quirements of State occupational li-
censing. 
My State, the State of Utah, led the 
way with this commonsense type of re-
form that makes life and achieving 
prosperity easier for those families who 
serve our Nation. It should become law. 
We need it. Our military families need 
it. Our military and the American peo-
ple generally would be much better off 
with it. 
We could have done more. This Na-
tional Defense Authorization Act could 
be a pivot point where we reexamine 
our defensive stance in the world and 
reclaim our constitutional arrange-
ment here at home. 
This NDAA could have been a turning 
point in which we in Congress re-
asserted our authority over war-mak-
ing powers. My National Security Pow-
ers Act that I have introduced with 
Senator MURPHY and Senator SANDERS 
would clarify and update and mod-
ernize the War Powers Resolution. 
The bill would also restore congres-
sional authority over arms exports. It 
would additionally require congres-
sional approval of emergency declara-
tions and prevent the President from 
misusing emergency powers. 
The National Security Powers Act 
would rein in Presidential abuses of the 
war power and make our Nation safer 
and more aligned with the Constitu-
tion. It is bipartisan. It is exactly the 
type of reform that belongs in the 
NDAA. 
We must also make reforms to our 
emergency 
war 
spending. 
Though 
President Biden thankfully didn’t re-
quest, and Congress didn’t provide, the 
OCO slush fund in this bill, there is 
much that needs to be done to restore 
Congress’s power of the purse in the de-
fense environment specifically. 
The Cost of War Project estimates 
that post-9/11 war spending totals $8 
trillion from 2001 to 2022. Of the $8 tril-
lion, OCO and interest on OCO funds 
accounts for $3.3 trillion. That is real 
money, and a lot of it. 
My 
Restraining 
Emergency 
War 
Spending Act would define emergency 
war funding and require the Depart-
ment of Defense and Congress to limit 
spending set aside for emergencies to 
the purpose for which it was author-
ized. 
We also need to return account-
ability to our defense alliances by re-
quiring wealthy and capable Nations to 
contribute their fair share of their de-
fense. In the NATO alliance alone, only 
11 of the 13 NATO member countries 
meet the 2 percent defense spending re-
quirement. 
This means that 63 percent of the al-
liance shown here in red consists of 
countries that don’t foot their share of 
the bill. They are not holding up their 
end of the agreement. 
So my Allied Burden Sharing Report 
Act would help us know just how much 
or just how little our allies are contrib-
uting. Now, this report used to be pub-
lished annually. It should be still. This 
NDAA would have been an ideal venue 
in which to legislate the return of that 
report. 
We also must use these legislative 
opportunities to prepare the Depart-
ment of Defense for future defense fo-
cused on the technology, the reforms, 
and the regions of the future. 
Our 
defensive 
position 
regarding 
China and in the Indo-Pacific should 
focus on deterrence. Spreading our 
forces and our expensive equipment to 
the ports and the shores of allies in the 
region is ineffective and could prove 
more of a vulnerability than an advan-
tage against Chinese strike capabili-
ties. A deterrent posture would com-
bine defensive strategy and operations 
to fend off possible attacks from a posi-
tion of strength and limit risk to U.S. 
personnel and assets. 
Further, we must prioritize recruit-
ment and retention for the future 
fight. We need to provide a suitable and 
welcoming environment for those in 
uniform and for their families. We need 
to end the President’s sweeping vaccine 
mandate and give our servicemembers 
the respect they deserve. 
After a disastrous withdrawal from 
Afghanistan and the end of our Na-
tion’s longest war, this NDAA could 
have been—should have been—an op-
portunity to debate, rethink, and re-
form our Nation’s defenses. 
The National Defense Authorization 
Act—U.S. defense and security broad-
ly—is one of the few items this body 
regularly considers that is explicitly, 
unambiguously within the enumerated 
powers of Congress. Consequently, it is 
something that deserves due consider-
ation and significant debate on the 
floor in order for Members to be able to 
raise issues like those that I have de-
scribed today. 
Yesterday, this body attempted to 
close debate on this bill without con-
sideration of a single amendment—not 
a single one. 
While 
this 
bill 
does 
make 
key 
progress in limited areas, it does not 
get to the heart of many of our na-
tional defense problems. It does not re-
store Congress’s role in our national 
defense. It does not provide a holistic 
strategy to defend the United States 
and the people of Utah—or the people 
of any other State. 
This bill and the floor process yet re-
main missed opportunities, and I am 
going to continue to fight for both nec-
essary policy reforms and for an open 
process generally on the floor. Any-
thing less, particularly in this critical 
area, amounts to an abdication of the 
duties of this body to the detriment of 
the citizens we serve. We can and we 
must do better. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
ABORTION 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, to-
morrow morning at 10 a.m., the Su-
preme Court of the United States will 
hear oral arguments on a case out of 
Mississippi commonly known now as 
the Dobbs case. 
That case is all about a Mississippi 
law, where Mississippi passed a law 
saying, at 15 weeks, a child in develop-
ment in the womb can be protected 
after that time period. 
That strikes right at the heart of Roe 
v. Wade, where, in the arbitrary ruling 
from the Supreme Court in 1973, they 
made up a new rule saying when a child 
is viable—not something that is in law 
at any spot. It created that out of 
whole cloth. 
Tomorrow morning, the Supreme 
Court will reopen that conversation 
about viability. It is an important dis-
cussion for us to be able to have as a 
nation, and it is vital that we talk 
about it here as well. As it is being dis-
cussed across the street at the Su-
preme Court, there are issues that we 
should discuss as well. 
So, for the next few moments, there 
are multiple different Senators who are 
going to speak on this one issue: When 
is a child a child, and when should 
States have the rights to protect their 
own citizens’ lives? 
The Supreme Court has made that 
murky and has the option tomorrow to 
be able to make that clear. This con-
versation, though, will circle around 
what should that legal standard be and 
how should we protect the lives of 
every citizen, no matter how small 
they are. 
There will be multiple Senators who 
will be speaking on this, the first of 
which will be Senator STEVE DAINES, 
who leads the Pro-Life Caucus in the 
U.S. Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Mr. President, I rise 
today ahead of one of the most impor-
tant moments in our decades-long bat-
tle to protect life. 
When our Founding Fathers laid out 
the Declaration of Independence, they 
talked about life, they talked about 
liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
They called them certain unalienable 
rights endowed by our Creator. The re-
ality is you can’t have liberty and the 
pursuit of happiness without first hav-
ing that unalienable right given by 
God, and that is the right to life. 
Tomorrow, the U.S. Supreme Court 
will hear oral arguments on the Mis-
sissippi late-term abortion case Dobbs

November 30, 2021 
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion. 
This puts our Nation at the cross-
roads of history. Our Nation has a mo-
ment to finally modernize our laws. We 
have got the aptitude to catch up with 
the 
great 
advancements 
seen 
in 
science, in technology, and medicine 
that indisputably show the humanity 
of unborn children. 
We have the opportunity to end an 
extreme judicially imposed abortion 
regime that is aligned with nations 
such as China and North Korea. The 
United States is just one of seven na-
tions that allows late-term abortions. 
We have the opportunity to write a 
new chapter of American history where 
the people’s elected representatives get 
to decide abortion policy in this coun-
try. 
The Supreme Court of the United 
States has the chance to right a his-
toric injustice and finally overturn Roe 
v. Wade. Our Court’s nine Justices have 
the opportunity to reconsider a wrong-
ly decided case. 
And, by the way, that wrongly de-
cided case that became case law, it was 
nine men in black robes that really 
have overruled the will of the people. It 
wasn’t a State legislature. It wasn’t 
the U.S. House. It wasn’t the U.S. Sen-
ate. It was nine men in black robes in 
1973 that has since resulted in the 
death of over 62 million innocent ba-
bies—62 million. 
They have the opportunity to reverse 
this horrific decision that imposed 
abortion on demand until the moment 
of birth across the United States. They 
have the opportunity to recognize that 
Roe was based on flawed and outdated 
science and that the right to abortion, 
which Roe invented, has no support in 
the text, the history, or the structure 
of the Constitution. 
The Supreme Court has an oppor-
tunity to restore the Constitution and 
defend our most fundamental right, 
and that is a right to life. 
Now, let’s go back to 1973, when Roe 
was decided. Many things were dif-
ferent than they are today. Why? Well, 
one reason is because science and tech-
nology—and certainly fashions—have 
advanced greatly. 
Our phones in the 1970s went from 
large brick-like devices with anten-
nas—in fact, the first cell phone call 
was placed in 1973, the very year that 
Roe v. Wade was decided. They were 
called bricks. They were about 21⁄2 
pounds. Compare that to these thin, 
touchscreen smartphones that we fit in 
our pockets today that are less than 6 
ounces in weight. 
In the 1970s, computers were the size 
of an entire desk, and now we have 
laptops that can be as thin as literally 
a child’s story that I read to my grand-
children over the Thanksgiving holi-
days. 
Now, when we drove in the seventies, 
compare that to what we drive today. I 
am thankful that has changed. 
And in the seventies, if you were a 
woman 
at 
the 
doctor 
getting 
an 
ultrasound at 15 weeks of pregnancy, 
you would have seen something like 
this. That is hard to recognize, but 
that was the technology that some 
ultrasounds had—the best—back in the 
seventies. 
But, today, an ultrasound of a baby 
at 15 weeks, when they are using the 
latest 4D technology, looks like this. 
You literally can see this little one 
here at 15 weeks sticking her tongue 
out—15 weeks. 
A baby this size is who Mississippi’s 
historic, lifesaving law would protect 
from the brutal violence of a late-term 
abortion. That is a 15-week baby. If you 
don’t 
believe 
me, 
take 
out 
your 
smartphone, google ‘‘15-week baby,’’ 
and click on—images.— 
Roe and Casey made it illegal for 
States like Mississippi to enforce laws 
that protect babies like this one on the 
grounds that this baby could not sur-
vive outside the womb. It was a point 
called viability. 
Roe and Casey’s viability line is arbi-
trary. It is unscientific. It is morally 
repugnant because, in 1973, babies 
could survive outside of the womb at 28 
weeks of pregnancy. Today, babies are 
surviving outside the womb as early as 
21 weeks but not yet as early as 15 
weeks. 
It is barbaric to deny lifesaving pro-
tections to a helpless, pre-born child 
like this one simply because she cannot 
survive outside the womb. 
The reality is, even a full-term, 40- 
week-old baby needs nurturing, care, 
and medical assistance to survive out-
side the womb. A full-term baby deliv-
ered at 40 or 41 weeks still requires the 
nurturing and the care of the parent to 
survive outside the womb. They have 
got to be fed. They have got to be kept 
warm. They have got to be taken care 
of. They can’t do it on their own. 
Martin Luther King once said: ‘‘In-
justice anywhere is a threat to justice 
everywhere.’’ 
This is also true in the case of the 
Supreme Court’s prior unjust decisions 
on abortion. In fact, the logic of Roe 
and Casey’s viability test undermines 
the moral coherence of civil rights pro-
tections for everyone who is unable to 
survive without assistance from others. 
That includes infants, young children, 
the elderly, and persons with disabil-
ities. 
A pre-born child is not a ‘‘potential 
life,’’ as Roe so wrongly concluded. 
This precious child and all children in-
side the womb, at any stage of develop-
ment, are whole. They are distinct. 
They are living human beings. They 
are fully human and fully living. They 
are beautifully living children made in 
the image of God, who should be pro-
tected by the law. 
Now, we have come a long way since 
1973. Our laws must now do the same. 
As you just saw, at the time that Roe 
v. Wade was decided, it was very hard 
to clearly see a baby in the womb. But 
because of science and technology 
today, it is impossible to ignore the hu-
manity of this growing baby. 
If I took this image and we had the 
American people say, ‘‘What is that?’’ 
they would say, ‘‘That is a baby.’’ 
At 15 weeks, a baby has arms and 
legs, can hiccup, can yawn. The heart 
is fully developed. At 15 weeks, the 
heart has already beaten 15 million 
times. That baby has distinct facial ex-
pressions. It can hear the voice of the 
mother and respond. It can taste, suck 
a thumb, and, as you can see in that 
other image I had, even stick out her 
tongue. 
I am a father of four and grandfather 
of two. We have another grandchild 
coming any day. Our daughter’s due 
date is December 3. It is Friday. My 
wife and I, who have been married now 
35 years, have our favorite way of 
tracking our grandbaby’s growth. This 
didn’t happen in 1973, but today we 
have apps on our phones. I have been 
using an app called Sprout. There are 
several out there. I downloaded it. I 
can see how my little grandson is doing 
in each week of the pregnancy. It is re-
markable—remarkable. We have been 
following this little baby now since 
week 8. We are at week 40 here this 
weekend. This cutting-edge technology 
is at the tip of our fingers—something 
we couldn’t imagine 50 years ago. We 
have that at the tip of our fingers. Our 
laws must catch up with the advance-
ment of science and technology. 
It is very important that we are clear 
about what overturning Roe would 
mean for our country because there is 
a lot of misinformation out there. Let 
me state this as clearly as I can. Over-
turning Roe will not—let me say that 
again—will not ban abortion nation-
wide, as many on the left like to claim 
in an attempt to mislead Americans. 
That is absolutely false. It will not ban 
abortions nationwide. Instead, it re-
turns the power to the States. It re-
turns the power to Federal lawmakers, 
allowing them to protect the most vul-
nerable and act on behalf of the people 
they are elected to represent, because 
today under Roe, State lawmakers are 
robbed of their ability to represent the 
values of their constituents. Yet, be-
cause of Roe, the will of the people of 
Mississippi 
to 
protect 
life 
is 
ob-
structed. 
According to a recent Marist poll, 80 
percent of Americans are opposed to 
abortions after the first 3 months— 
that is 12 weeks—of pregnancy. That is 
an 
overwhelming 
majority 
of 
the 
American people, but because of Roe, 
their voices are being silenced. 
It is time for the Supreme Court to 
allow the States and Federal law-
makers—those of us who are elected, 
who are held directly accountable by 
the people—to protect the most vulner-
able among us. It is time that we, as 
the United States of America, a nation 
that is supposed to be a leader in the 
world on human rights, recognize that 
innocent babies in the womb deserve 
equal protection under our laws. 
I am sure many of my colleagues and 
most Americans would agree that na-
tions like communist China and North

Korea 
egregiously 
violate 
human 
rights. Yet when it comes to abortion, 
sadly, 
America 
stands with them. 
There are just seven countries, and we 
are on that list. The United States is a 
global outlier on abortion. We are just 
one of seven nations that allow abor-
tions on demand past the point where a 
baby feels pain, all the way up, in fact, 
until the moment of birth. Standing 
with North Korea and China on abor-
tion is horrifying. It is a disgraceful 
place for the greatest country in the 
world to be. We must do better. 
I want to thank Mississippi Attorney 
General Lynn Fitch, her entire team, 
and the Mississippi Legislature for 
their unwavering support of life. We 
stand with you. Millions of Americans 
stand with you, young and old. They 
are praying for this momentous mo-
ment that will be occurring before our 
Court tomorrow. 
As we stand here today, we are mere 
hours away from a pivotal point in our 
Nation’s history. I pray that we re-
member tomorrow as the turning point 
that closes a really dark chapter of our 
Nation’s history and heralds the dawn 
of truly a new day in America for those 
who have no voice to finally have a 
voice; one that honors the human dig-
nity, the God-given potential of all life; 
one that positions the United States as 
a leader in the world, that stands up 
and puts an end to the horrific violence 
of abortion, especially painful late- 
term abortions. I pray that we see the 
Supreme Court of the United States 
correct a historic injustice, that they 
would 
uphold 
Mississippi’s 
15-week 
abortion law and send Roe v. Wade to 
the ash heap of history. 
For the pro-life movement, over-
turning Roe is not the end but just the 
beginning. 
As I stated earlier, this does not ban 
abortions nationwide. What it does is it 
will return the decisionmaking back to 
the States. 
No matter how the Court rules, we 
will continue to fight on the State and 
Federal level to pass laws to end the vi-
olence of abortion. We will not rest 
until the day that every life is pro-
tected under laws from conception 
until natural death. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
being here today to talk about the im-
portance of the Dobbs case. I want to 
thank my friend Senator LANKFORD for 
helping me with this fight for life. I am 
grateful to the two Senators from Mis-
sissippi, where this case originated, 
this law originated. I am grateful for 
Senator WICKER, who is here today, and 
I know he has some comments he 
wants to share as well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mr. WICKER. I congratulate my 
friend from Montana for his passionate 
and analytical and, in my view, correct 
assessment of this issue. 
I rise this afternoon in support and 
encouragement of the public officials 
and the attorneys who will bring this 
case before the Supreme Court in argu-
ment tomorrow. I rise, as does my col-
league from Mississippi, Senator HYDE- 
SMITH, in appreciation for the State 
legislature, where she and I both served 
before coming to Congress, and in ap-
preciation for the Governor and the 
legislature enacting the Gestational 
Age Act, which is the subject of this 
Dobbs case which will be argued tomor-
row. 
This is a serious issue. It is an issue 
that will determine whether millions 
of American children have an oppor-
tunity to be born and to enjoy the good 
life in this, the greatest system of rep-
resentative government that the world 
has ever seen. It is a serious issue. 
I am happy today. I am encouraged 
and hopeful today. One of the reasons 
that I am so encouraged is that the 
American people steadily over the dec-
ades have been moving in the direction 
of protecting life. This has not always 
been the case. As my friend from Mon-
tana so accurately pointed out, we just 
know so much more. Science knows so 
much more today in 2021 than science 
knew and Americans knew and the 
world knew back in 1973, so we see 
more and more people becoming pro- 
life. 
Since 1995, the share of Americans 
who identified themselves as pro-life 
has jumped to 47 percent from 33 per-
cent. You say: Well, that is not that 
great. Of course, it leaves some folks 
undecided. But when you sort it out 
and become more specific, two out of 
three Americans support a ban on sec-
ond trimester abortions. This is what 
the Mississippi law does. This is the 
law that will be allowed to stay in ef-
fect if the Supreme Court rules in favor 
of Mississippi based on the argument 
tomorrow. 
Four out of five Americans oppose 
late-term abortions. 
My friend the distinguished Senator 
from Montana encouraged people with-
in the sound of his voice to take their 
smartphones out and type in ‘‘15-week- 
old baby.’’ I did that. I don’t know if 
the rules quite permit that yet on the 
floor, but I dare say it is not the first 
time that has been done, so I did that. 
I clicked on ‘‘15-week-old baby,’’ and 
that very picture, along with other 
photographs, came up. As the gen-
tleman says, it is every much, every 
bit a human baby—no question about 
it. 
I am encouraged that the American 
people are moving in the direction of 
life because they have seen these pic-
tures, because they listen to the 
science, and we know more than we did 
in 1973. The Supreme Court knows 
more than it did in 1973. 
After 15 weeks, an unborn baby has 
more than 90 percent of its body parts 
that it will ever have. They have been 
formed, and almost every organ is 
functional at the 15-week period. That 
is a baby. That is a human, American 
baby. The child’s heart is pumping 26 
quarts of blood per day at 15 weeks and 
has already beaten approximately 15.8 
million times by 15 weeks. That is a 
human. That is a baby. Babies at this 
stage respond to touch and taste, and a 
dominant hand begins to emerge. We 
know at that point—15 weeks—whether 
that baby is right-handed or left-hand-
ed. And, of course, we know that baby 
can feel pain. That baby deserves the 
constitutional rights that the gen-
tleman from Montana mentioned of life 
and the pursuit of happiness as an 
American. 
I do want to congratulate our friends 
across the sea for actually being ahead 
of us on this. We like to think that 
sometimes we know best and we are 
ahead of the curve, but it happens that 
almost every European country has 
legislation in place, rules in place, that 
are very much like the Mississippi law 
that will be in question tomorrow in 
the hearing. 
Germany and Belgium have banned 
elective abortions after 14 weeks. Now, 
this law in Mississippi has set that at 
15 weeks, but Germany and Belgium, 14 
weeks. Denmark, Norway, France—a 
very ‘‘live and let live’’ country if ever 
I heard of it—draws the line at 12 
weeks—12 weeks. So when the Supreme 
Court hears this case tomorrow, they 
will have an opportunity to decide to 
place the United States of America in 
the broad mainstream of international 
thought on this. 
There are so many reasons why I am 
happy today and encouraged today 
that we have this opportunity to make 
a case based on the facts. 
I will say this: My heart and my 
thanks go out to the millions of Ameri-
cans right this minute who are doing 
what some think is a quaint thing— 
performing an act that many people 
are skeptical about at this point. But I 
stand with those millions and millions 
of Americans who are right at this mo-
ment praying for the Supreme Court, 
praying for wisdom in these nine ap-
pointed and confirmed figures. They 
are praying for the right words to be 
said by the attorneys, and they are 
praying for the future of our great 
country. 
This is our opportunity, and we have 
every reason to believe that we are on 
the right side of history. I stand with 
the people who are bringing this case, 
and I stand with the people of Mis-
sissippi and the millions upon millions 
of Americans who are praying for the 
right decision. 
I yield to my good friend from across 
the river, the junior Senator from Lou-
isiana. I know that my friend from 
Mississippi is also waiting to speak. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we 
talk a lot in this Chamber, as well we 
should, about the least among us, 
about how we can protect and lift up 
the powers. And that is a good thing. I 
can’t think of any person who has less 
power than a potential human life, 
than an unborn baby. Now, Roe v. Wade 
is, of course, about abortion. We know 
that. But it is also about something

else. Roe v. Wade is also about—it is 
about federalism. 
Roe v. Wade is also about the Amer-
ican people. Roe v. Wade is about 
whether a finite group of the manage-
rial elite—and by the ‘‘managerial 
elite’’ I mean the entrenched politi-
cians, the bureaucracy, the media, the 
academics, the corporate phonies, all 
of whom think they are smarter and

ple—should have the right to make

making those decisions for themselves. 
That is really what Roe v. Wade is 
about. 
Now, I am pro-life and I am anti-Roe 
v. Wade. So I want to say up front: I do 
have an opinion. 
But even pro-choice legal scholars 
who believe in legalized abortion on de-
mand understand, as does every fair-
minded person who knows a lawbook 
from a J. Crew catalog, that Roe v. 
Wade is one of the most arbitrary, it is 
one of the most ad hoc, and it is one of 
the most poorly reasoned decisions in 
the history of the United States. 
In Roe v. Wade, as you know, Mr. 
President, the U.S. Supreme Court held 
that a generalized right to privacy, not 
explicit in the Constitution, means 
that a woman has the virtually unfet-
tered discretion to terminate a human 
life—some, to be fair, would say a po-
tential human life—before viability. 
What is viability? As my colleagues 
talked about, that is a really, really 
good question. 
But I digress. 
Anyone who knows a lawbook from a 
J. Crew catalog also knows that there 
is absolutely no foundation—not in the 
text, not in the structure, not in the 
history, not in the tradition of the 
Constitution—for 
a 
constitutional 
right to abortion, and certainly not on 
the basis of some unmoored general 
right to privacy that is not enunciated 
in the Constitution. 
And don’t even get me started on Roe 
v. Wade’s trimester analysis and the 
ruling. Try to find ‘‘trimester’’ in the 
U.S. Constitution. You won’t. You 
can’t. 
The truth is—and people on both 
sides of this issue who are fairminded 
and reasonably objective—and by that, 
I mean can see the other point of view. 
The truth is that Roe v. Wade’s con-
stitutional right to an abortion is a 48- 
year-old, judge-invented rule that rep-
resents 
the 
U.S. 
Supreme 
Court 
winging it. 
Now, I know what we were told. We 
were told back in the 1970s: Look, we 
have got to have a national rule to set-
tle this issue. Only Washington, DC, 
can settle this issue. We have to have a 
rational rule. We need some peace in 
the land. We need consensus. 
How is that working out for us? 
Roe v. Wade didn’t settle anything. 
Now, in the Dobbs case, which the 
U.S. Supreme Court is about to hear, 
the U.S. Supreme Court has a really 
rare opportunity to say, as Justice 
Scalia wrote in one of his opinions, 
that value judgments made on behalf of 
people should be voted on by those peo-
ple and not dictated from Washington, 
DC. 
In the Dobbs case, the United States 
Supreme Court has the rare oppor-
tunity to say what we all know, and 
that is that America is this big, wide- 
open, diverse, sometimes messy, some-
times dysfunctional, sometimes imper-
fect, but always trying-to-get-better 
group of good people. That is what 
America is. 
And we don’t always agree—espe-
cially not on value judgments, espe-
cially not on the ultimate value judg-
ment—like when it is appropriate to 
take a human life. That is why we get 
to vote. That is why we get to vote, 
and that is why we have elected rep-
resentatives who oftentimes vote on 
our 
behalf—elected 
representatives 
who also can be unelected if we don’t 
like how they vote. 
And, finally, in Dobbs, the U.S. Su-
preme Court has the rare opportunity 
to defederalize and deconstitutionalize 
abortion and return the issue to the 
States, where it was before Roe v. 
Wade. 
The U.S. Supreme Court, in Dobbs, 
does not have the opportunity—and 
this is important—to say ‘‘no right to 
an abortion in America.’’ Let me say 
that again because some of the pro-
ponents of Roe v. Wade, I think, have 
shaded the truth on this. At issue be-
fore the Supreme Court in Dobbs is not 
the right to have an abortion. It is the 
right—the issue before the Supreme 
Court in Dobbs is, What is the appro-
priate political form to make these 
value judgments? Is it the government 
or is it the people? 
And I hope that the U.S. Supreme 
Court takes advantage of this rare op-
portunity before it. 
I yield to the Senator from Mis-
sissippi. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Mississippi. 
Mrs. HYDE-SMITH. Mr. President, I 
join my colleagues today highlighting 
the momentous occasion for not only 
my home State of Mississippi but for 
our entire Nation. Senator ROGER 
WICKER and I could not be prouder of 
our State. 
Tomorrow, the U.S. Supreme Court 
will hear oral arguments in Dobbs v. 
Jackson Women’s Health Organization, 
a challenge to a Mississippi law ban-
ning most abortions after 15 weeks. 
This law, the Gestational Age Act, was 
introduced by my friend, Mississippi 
State Representative Becky Currie, 
and was signed into law by Mississippi 
Governor Phil Bryant in 2018. 
This case presents a once-in-a-gen-
eration opportunity for the Court to 
reconsider decades of misguided abor-
tion law that began with Roe v. Wade 
and has continued under Planned Par-
enthood v. Casey. 
There is no doubt that this case is 
the most significant pro-life legal 
opening in half a century and, cer-
tainly, in my lifetime. I am very proud 
that my State of Mississippi is in the 
center of this. 
In the 48 years since the decision in 
Roe v. Wade, 62 million unborn babies 
have lost their lives. This is a terrible 
moral stain on our Nation that we have 
a chance to reverse at long last. 
There are many reasons for the Su-
preme Court to reconsider its course. 
For one, medical technology has made 
significant advances—especially with 
ultrasound technology—making clear 
what those of us in the pro-life move-
ment already knew: that unborn chil-
dren are human beings. 
Thanks 
in 
large 
part 
to 
the 
ultrasound technology, we now know 
that, by 15 weeks, an unborn baby has 
a fully developed heart with a strong 
heartbeat, responds to touch, and can 
make facial expressions, yawn, hiccup, 
and suck their thumbs. 
For another, the United States is a 
real outlier in the world when it comes 
to the abortion issue. We are one of 
only seven countries that allow abor-
tions on demand up until the moment 
of birth, along with the likes of China 
and North Korea. 
The Supreme Court should uphold 
Mississippi’s law, bringing our Nation 
closer to the international consensus 
on human rights for the unborn. 
As a legislator, I am confident in say-
ing it is time for our laws to reflect 
what the rest of the world has already 
figured out: that life exists before birth 
and it needs to be protected. The only 
difference between a fetus and a first 
grader is 6 years. 
Since the Supreme Court announced 
it would take up the Dobbs case, I have 
been earnestly praying for this case. I 
pray for the Members of the Supreme 
Court to be open to the legal and moral 
arguments against Roe v. Wade. May 
God grant them the wisdom for the 
task and grace for the unborn. 
I have also been praying for my 
friend Mississippi Attorney General 
Lynn Fitch, our State’s solicitor gen-
eral, Scott Stuart, and the many oth-
ers in the AG’s office who have worked 
tirelessly to represent our State so 
well in this case. 
With the oral arguments scheduled 
for tomorrow morning, I pray that God 
would grant them all confidence and 
courage, as well as the right words to 
say in the Court. 
Most of all, I have been praying for 
all the unborn children whose right to 
life hangs in the balance of this case. 
Throughout this time, I have kept 
the words of I Samuel 1:27 close to my 
heart: ‘‘For this child I have prayed, 
and the Lord hath given me my peti-
tion, which I asked of him.’’ 
So today, tonight, and tomorrow 
morning, I will be praying without 
ceasing. I hope each of you will join me 
in prayer for this historic court deci-
sion that started in Mississippi. 
May the Dobbs case restore the sanc-
tity of life and reverse the moral stain 
of Roe v. Wade. 
Thank you, Mr. President.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8820 
November 30, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. President, for near-
ly 50 years, Roe v. Wade has been a dis-
aster for our country and its citizens. 
Sixty million unborn lives have been 
lost to abortion, and our politics have 
been distorted by a ruling that deprives 
the American citizen—the voter—of 
the right to determine questions on 
which there is constitutional ambi-
guity. 
The Senate confirms individuals to 
the judicial branch to be judges. They 
are to judge, not to legislate. Listening 
to those whom we represent and pro-
posing legislation on their behalf is our 
job here in the Capitol and the job of 
our representatives in State legisla-
tures throughout all 50 States. The sep-
aration of these powers is crucial to 
how our democracy functions. 
Yet previous iterations of the Su-
preme Court have seen fit to usurp this 
legislative power, particularly as it re-
lates to abortion. 
In doing so, a majority of these 
unelected judges and Justices have re-
lied upon specious jurisprudence to 
eviscerate State laws that protect the 
unborn. 
You don’t need to take the word of a 
conservative Republican from Kansas. 
Writing when she was a circuit court 
judge, the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg 
explained: 
Roe v. Wade . . . invited no dialogue with 
legislators. Instead, it seemed entirely to re-
move the ball from the legislators’ court. 
One more liberal law professor ac-
knowledged that ‘‘Roe short-circuited 
the democratic deliberation that is the 
most reliable method of deciding ques-
tions of competing values.’’ 
These assessments are exactly right. 
The fallout of Roe, and affirmed by 
Planned Parenthood v. Casey in 1992, is 
obvious. A vacancy to the Supreme 
Court has become a cage match—a 
fight here in the U.S. Senate. Someone 
as eminently qualified as Amy Coney 
Barrett should have been confirmed 
unanimously. 
Today, many of my Democratic col-
leagues support packing the Supreme 
Court with more Justices because they 
believe the Court will block their agen-
da, which is ironic because for nearly a 
half century, virtually every State ever 
to provide protection to unborn babies 
has been foiled by the judicial branch. 
Something terribly wrong has hap-
pened to our democracy when so much 
energy is focused on the Court. 
Again, quoting then-Justice Ginsburg 
on Roe’s attempt to put the issue of 
abortion to bed, she said in 1985, the 
Court’s ‘‘heavy-handed judicial inter-
vention was difficult to justify and ap-
pears to have provoked, not resolved, 
conflict’’ and in 1993 declared that the 
ruling ‘‘prolonged divisiveness and de-
ferred stable settlement of the issue.’’ 
Given these examples of our polluted 
discourse, no one can reasonably say 
that the politics of abortion have im-
proved since then. In fact, it has only 
gotten much worse. 
What has improved, however, is our 
understanding of the science of embry-
ology. Regrettably, it is not enough to 
say a unique human life begins at the 
moment of conception for it to receive 
protection. But we know when unborn 
babies feel pain; we know when they 
can survive outside the womb; and a re-
markable 4D ultrasound reveals what 
we already knew: These unborn babies 
are fully human and deserve the right 
to life, and yet our legal regime denies 
them that right. 
Because of Roe, a child in America 
can be terminated for any reason—any 
reason—up to the moment of its birth. 
That places the United States in the 
company of China and North Korea. 
Surely, a democracy founded on the be-
lief that all people ‘‘are endowed by 
their Creator with certain unalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Lib-
erty, and the pursuit of Happiness’’ has 
a greater respect for human life than 
these brutal communist regimes. 
Tomorrow’s Mississippi case will test 
that proposition. However, there is no 
doubt that the reversal of Roe will not 
end the practice of legal abortion. Sev-
eral States have already enacted per-
missive abortion laws that would re-
main even on Roe’s demise. 
The point here is that my effort and 
the effort of my colleagues and mil-
lions of other Americans to defend life 
will continue regardless of how the Su-
preme Court rules in the coming 
months, including in my State of Kan-
sas. These efforts will depend on civil 
persuasion of our neighbors and respon-
sive State and Federal legislators. We 
will need legislation that protects the 
unborn and assists new families in car-
ing for their child. 
Tomorrow, the Supreme Court will 
hear the most significant abortion case 
in the last 30 years. Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization. This 
case provides the Court the oppor-
tunity to relinquish the legislative 
power it has assumed and return it to 
the people and their representatives. 
The Court will be better for it, and so 
will our politics. And most importantly 
of all, millions of future voices will get 
to have their say in the process too. 
I now yield the floor to my colleague, 
the Senator from Nebraska, Senator 
FISCHER. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, Dobbs 
v. Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion, the case that will come before our 
Nation’s highest Court on December 1, 
is truly a historic case. It is about a 
law the State of Mississippi passed in 
2018 to ban almost all abortions after 15 
weeks of pregnancy. 
When I was a member of the State 
legislature in Nebraska in 2010, we 
passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child 
Protection Act. Nebraska’s bill banned 
most abortions after 20 weeks, the 
point when science at that time told us 
that unborn babies start to be able to 
feel pain. We were the first State in the 
country to pass a law of this kind, and 
in our Nebraska unicameral, we passed 
it with 44 ‘‘yes’’ votes and just 5 ‘‘no’’ 
votes. 
Nebraska has a unicameral—1 House, 
49 Senators. We have pro-choice, pro- 
life, Republicans and Democrats that 
voted for this bill. We had pro-choice 
Republicans. We had a number of pro- 
life Democrats. In fact, we had a 
former 
Democratic 
National 
Com-
mitteeman vote for this bill. All we 
cared about was protecting the most 
vulnerable people in our society—un-
born children. 
I was proud to support Nebraska’s 
bill. I was proud that pro-life Demo-
crats, pro-choice Republicans, put their 
differences aside to vote for it. And I 
am proud today to stand with Mis-
sissippi as their law comes before the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
Back in July, I joined more than 200 
of my colleagues in the Senate and the 
House of Representatives in filing an 
amicus brief supporting Mississippi’s 
bill. In our brief, we argued that the 
precedence the Supreme Court set in 
Roe v. Wade and a later case, Planned 
Parenthood v. Casey, are outdated. 
When Roe was decided nearly 50 years 
ago, babies born before 28 weeks were 
not expected to survive. Today, the 
miracles of modern medicine have al-
lowed babies born much earlier to not 
only survive but to go on to live full 
and happy lives. 
Just last year, a little boy was born 
right next door to Mississippi, in Ala-
bama, at 21 weeks. He was 132 days pre-
mature, and he weighed just 14.8 
ounces. Fifty years ago, it would have 
been 
unthinkable—unthinkable—for 
him to live beyond a few days. But this 
July, he celebrated his first birthday. 
Fifty years ago, ultrasounds and 
sonograms were not widely available. 
Today, they are an essential part of 
prenatal care. The pictures that these 
technologies enable families to see of 
their unborn children, even at the 
early stages of pregnancy, are often 
nearly identical to the newborns they 
will soon become. The advancements of 
the last 50 years have left no doubt 
about the humanity of the unborn. And 
as science continues to progress over 
the next 50 years, new developments 
are going to keep allowing babies born 
earlier and earlier to survive and to 
thrive. 
The laws of just about every devel-
oped country have kept up with this 
rapid progress, but here in the United 
States our laws are stuck in the past. 
The United States is one of only four 
nations on Earth where certain States 
allow abortions up to the day of birth. 
That puts us in the uncomfortable 
company of China, North Korea, and 
Vietnam. Ninety percent of countries 
around the world limit abortion at 15 
weeks, the same point as Mississippi’s 
law, and some even earlier. In Europe 
alone, there are eight countries with 
laws 
that 
are 
stricter 
than 
Mis-
sissippi’s. 
That 
includes 
Germany, 
where abortion is illegal in most cases 
just after 12 weeks. Women seeking

abortions before 12 weeks in Germany 
also have to go through a 3-day waiting 
period and a mandatory counseling ses-
sion. 
Mississippi’s law isn’t that different 
from Germany’s. In some ways, it is 
even more lenient, but it is still being 
challenged in our court system based 
on legal decisions from decades ago. 
Our laws are outdated, and America’s 
unborn children are paying the price. 
Since 1973, more than 60 million abor-
tions have taken the lives of more than 
60 million American children, many of 
whom could have survived outside the 
womb. 
It is past time for the United States 
to move into the 21st century. The Su-
preme Court has a chance to help us do 
that by upholding Mississippi’s law in 
the Dobbs case, and I hope they will. 
With that, I would yield to my col-
league from Kansas, Senator MAR-
SHALL, who is also a doctor, a gyne-
cologist, and obstetrician. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I 
want to start by thanking the Senator 
from Nebraska for helping to bring to 
light the significance of the Dobbs Su-
preme Court case. 
For some 30 years, I had the honor, 
the privilege of delivering a baby most 
every day of my life. Some 5,000 babies 
in residency and another 5,000 babies in 
private practice. Some days, I deliv-
ered none. Other days, it was one or 
two. There were days when I delivered 
10, 11, 12 babies a day. 
Some of those babies I could fit in 
the palm of my hand. Other babies—I 
delivered several babies over 15 pounds. 
It has now been almost 4 years since 
I delivered my last baby, but I am still 
often asked: Do I miss obstetrics; and 
let me tell you, boy, do I miss it. 
My favorite part of the whole proc-
ess, as I recall, though, was after a 
hard, long labor, seeing that baby 
emerge from the mother, holding that 
baby in my hands and waiting for it to 
cry. Sometimes it was crying as it en-
tered into this world, other times it 
took 5 seconds, sometimes 30 seconds, 
sometimes a minute or two would go 
by as we worked on the baby. But my 
favorite part of every pregnancy was 
taking that crying baby and handing it 
over to a new mom and dad. It was ab-
solutely the most spiritual moment of 
my life—the closest I ever got to seeing 
what God was truly like, to see a new-
born baby in the hands of its mom and 
dad, with this just total agape love— 
this unconditional love. It was just the 
honor of my life to experience that al-
most on a daily basis. 
But today I want to talk about my 
favorite OB visit which came at 15 
weeks, typically. At about 15 weeks 
after conception, moms would come in 
for maybe their third or fourth visit. 
My first question was always: Are you 
feeling the baby move? And the mom’s 
eyes would light up. Maybe she had had 
a miscarriage before or maybe it was 
an infertile couple or maybe this was 
her third or fourth baby, but when I 
asked them: Are you feeling the baby 
move yet, her eyes would light up. 
And mom would lie down on the bed, 
and I would put my hands on her abdo-
men and feel the size of her uterus to 
assess how big the baby was. And so 
often as I put my hands on her skin, I 
could feel the baby pushing back or 
kicking back. 
And then we put the Doppler on the 
mom’s abdomen and listened to the 
baby’s heartbeat, and usually if there 
was a brother or sister in the room, 
that baby’s big brother or big sister 
would squeal: Mommy, what is that 
noise? What is that noise? And almost 
every time, as I heard the sibling ask 
mom that question, you could hear the 
baby’s heart rate increase with excite-
ment. That baby inside the womb knew 
that was its brother or sister there 
that was talking, and it was excited to 
hear that voice. And the mom would 
respond: Darling, that is your little 
baby brother or sister. And as mom 
spoke, the baby’s heart rate would slow 
back down to what it was before—that 
calming voice. 
So that brings me to the Dobbs case. 
The Mississippi Dobbs case protects 
life after that 15-week visit I just de-
scribed. 
I recognize and believe that life be-
gins at conception, but maybe not all 
of America agrees with me on that. But 
I do believe with all my heart that a 
huge part of America agrees, we should 
not allow abortions on babies that can 
feel pain or that can respond to their 
mom’s voice or their sibling’s voices. 
Right? 
Ask yourself that same question. An 
unborn baby that can feel pain, that 
knows its mom’s voice, should that 
baby be deprived of life outside the 
womb? 
I struggle as I watch America be one 
of seven nations that allows abortions 
after 15 weeks. And I point out that all 
these other nations are agnostic or to-
talitarian nations for the most part. 
And I struggle as I recall the moms and 
dads who lost a baby at 15 weeks or at 
18 weeks or at 23 weeks. I recall their 
mourning. I recall their tears. 
I recall how, in our hospital, we 
might be struggling to preserve a preg-
nancy, to save a baby’s life, to be re-
suscitating a baby while in a nearby 
town the abortion industry is claiming 
another life at this same gestational 
age. 
I struggle to think we live in a soci-
ety that allows this barbaric treatment 
of the unborn. We hope and pray that 
this landmark Supreme Court case will 
result in a decision that reflects the 
values of most Americans and will pro-
tect life after 15 weeks. 
Unfortunately, because of a 2019 Kan-
sas Supreme Court case, my home 
State of Kansas has become an abor-
tion destination—an abortion destina-
tion. The Kansas Supreme Court has 
paved the way for unlimited abortions, 
abortions paid for with tax dollars. 
That is why, back home, I will be fight-
ing for the Value Them Both Amend-
ment that protects the values of both 
the mom and the baby. 
Look, America does not want an un-
limited, unregulated abortion industry. 
This is not consistent with our values. 
I believe most Americans value them 
both. We value both the mom and the 
baby. I fought my whole life for moms 
and babies, and I am going to keep 
fighting for them both. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor to my 
friend and mentor from Texas, who has 
been leading the fight up here in DC for 
years. I look forward to his sharing 
with us what Texans are talking about 
on the significance of this Dobbs Su-
preme Court case. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MAR-
KEY). The Senator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want 
to start by thanking my colleagues for 
being willing to stand up and defend in-
nocent human life. 
I remember, recently, watching a 
young woman walk across one of the 
downtown bridges in Austin, TX, car-
rying a sign that read: ‘‘Abortion—any 
time, any reason.’’ 
That is what she was advocating for. 
I was shocked when I saw it because I 
thought even the most ardent advo-
cates of abortion would not take that 
position of denying the humanity of 
this unborn child, but, apparently, that 
is what it has become here—48 years 
after the Supreme Court first created a 
right to abortion out of whole cloth as 
a constitutional right. 
You look, in vain, in the Constitu-
tion of the United States, as well as in 
the amendments to the Constitution, 
for any reference at all to abortion. 
What you will find, if you read the Dec-
laration of Independence, is a familiar 
statement to all of us. On July 4, 1776, 
the 13 States then that made up Amer-
ica wrote: ‘‘We hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created 
equal, that they are endowed by their 
Creator 
with 
certain 
unalienable 
Rights, that among these are Life, Lib-
erty, and the pursuit of Happiness.’’ 
By the way, there is no asterisk— 
there is no footnote—that says, if you 
are an unborn human life, that you are 
denied this unalienable right to life. 
Such noteworthy figures as Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, who was probably one 
of the most aggressive advocates for 
abortion rights on the U.S. Supreme 
Court, later in life decried the fact 
that, by the Supreme Court’s holding a 
right to abortion as a constitutional 
right, it denied the very sort of give- 
and-take debate by which our dif-
ferences are resolved in the States and 
at the national level. 
I would just like to point out some of 
the misinformation that you hear and 
read about Roe v. Wade. 
If Roe v. Wade is no longer the prece-
dent by which abortion rights are de-
cided, it will not mean that abortion 
will not be available in many, if not 
all, of the States. What it will mean is 
that it will be decided, under our Fed-
eral system, on a State-by-State basis,

according to the decisions made by 
elected State leadership, including the 
legislature. 
In 1973, Richard Nixon was inaugu-
rated for the second time as President 
of the United States. Suffice it to say 
that a lot has happened since then—a 
lot. I think it is entirely appropriate 
that the U.S. Supreme Court revisits 
its precedents, including Roe v. Wade— 
decided in 1973—and decide if that 
precedent has stood the test of time. 
By the way, in serving on the Judici-
ary Committee, we frequently have 
nominees for the Supreme Court of the 
United States come before the com-
mittee, and many of my pro-choice col-
leagues will say: Do you agree, Judge 
or Future Judge, that Roe v. Wade is 
the precedent of the U.S. Supreme 
Court? 
Of course, that is along with Casey 
and the other decisions that have been 
decided since then, but they act as if 
the U.S. Supreme Court cannot revisit 
bad decisions and correct those bad de-
cisions. 
To act as though Supreme Court 
precedent is somehow sacrosanct would 
still leave us with the likes of Dred 
Scott, which treated African Ameri-
cans as less than fully human. Obvi-
ously, we fought a Civil War, and 
600,000 Americans died—that would be 
the equivalent of 3 million people 
today—in a bloody Civil War that tore 
our country apart. 
So being able to revisit those prece-
dents, especially in light of the passage 
of time and over long experience, is en-
tirely within the purview and entirely 
appropriate for the Supreme Court to 
do. 
Well, we have heard from my other 
colleagues that, since Roe was decided 
in 1973, more than 60 million abortions 
have been performed in the United 
States. As originally was decided, Jus-
tice Blackmun wrote an opinion and 
established an event he called viabil-
ity. Basically, the argument by the 
proponents of Roe is that somehow, in 
this decision by Justice Blackmun’s 
saying that abortion should be widely 
available pre-viability, we should not 
be able to reconsider or take a look at 
that. The truth is, Justice Blackmun 
admitted this was an arbitrary stand-
ard. 
What does ‘‘viability’’ mean? 
We have heard that seven countries 
around the world have more permissive 
or equally permissive abortion laws as 
the United States. I, frankly, don’t 
want to be in the same company as 
North Korea or the People’s Republic 
of China, governed by the Communist 
Party. I would hope that America 
would aspire to something different 
and better and more humane, more in 
line with our fundamental statement 
about the unalienable right to life. 
But, as to the fact that America is 
only one of seven countries that allows 
elective 
abortions 
after 
20 
weeks, 
which, as I said, puts us in the same 
category as communist China and 
North Korea, you would think that 
would raise a huge red flag as to say 
something is terribly wrong here. 
How is it that we are in the same cat-
egory as communist North Korea and 
as communist China when it comes to 
the value we place on unborn life? 
Well, unfortunately, we have seen the 
right to life become a partisan issue in 
the U.S. Congress when you take a 
look at the pro-life legislation which 
has been introduced over the last 
years. 
We saw last year, for example, our 
Democratic colleagues filibuster legis-
lation to outlaw elective abortions 
after 20 weeks, which is when science 
tells us that an infant can feel pain. 
Then they blocked a bill requiring phy-
sicians to provide lifesaving care to in-
fants who survive abortions. This is 
care that any other newborn baby 
would receive, and yet our colleagues— 
so 
concerned 
about 
the 
backlash 
among 
their 
pro-abortion 
constitu-
ents—blocked it, denying a child born 
alive after a botched abortion the same 
sort of care that any other newborn 
would be entitled to. They blocked it. 
And the latest attack on an unborn 
baby’s right to life is the Women’s 
Health Protection Act. This bill would 
undermine State laws limiting abor-
tion, even after viability, and undercut 
the Supreme Court’s ruling that de-
fines our current definition of ‘‘viabil-
ity.’’ 
What does ‘‘viability’’ mean? 
Even at 20 weeks, can an unborn 
child live without medical attention 
and support from their mother or med-
ical personnel? 
Of course not. 
This was an arbitrary line drawn by 
the Supreme Court in 1973. As we have 
heard from many of my colleagues, 
medicine has, thankfully, advanced 
considerably since that time. 
Well, even though the U.S. Congress 
seems to be stuck when it comes to the 
issue of abortion and respecting the 
right to life of unborn babies, thank-
fully, the States have taken the issue 
up, which is why States, like Mis-
sissippi, have passed their own legisla-
tion to protect unborn babies. 
Pro-abortion advocates say, well, 15 
weeks—which is what the Mississippi 
law says. They say that a right to abor-
tion only for the first 15 weeks of a 
pregnancy 
violates 
constitutional 
rights. But it is interesting. It is no 
less arbitrary than this notion of via-
bility, which suggests that a child can 
live—which they cannot—outside the 
mother’s womb even if they are 20 
weeks or 24 weeks of gestational age. 
Interestingly, in a number of States, 
like Massachusetts and Nevada, abor-
tions are restricted after 24 weeks. 
California, Washington, Illinois are 
among States that explicitly restrict 
abortions after viability. 
The American people clearly stand 
behind the protection of unborn life. 
This summer, a poll found that 65 per-
cent of Americans believe that abor-
tion should be illegal in the second tri-
mester. That is the second 3-month pe-
riod of a 9-month pregnancy. 
Opposition to third-trimester abor-
tion is even stronger, as 80 percent of 
Americans are opposed to a third-tri-
mester abortion. Indeed, the Supreme 
Court of the United States upheld a Ne-
braska law banning late-term abortion, 
which is essentially producing a deliv-
ery while the child is still alive, killing 
the fetus, and then completing that 
abortion. The Supreme Court of the 
United States upheld a ban on that 
third-trimester, late-term abortion— 
that brutal and barbaric practice that 
even the Supreme Court could not 
abide. 
Last June, a baby born at 21 weeks 
and 2 days, this last summer, cele-
brated his first birthday. That is what 
is at stake here when you are dealing 
with more than just one person—or you 
are dealing with more than just one 
person. 
The question is: How do you balance 
and deal with the rights not only of the 
woman seeking the abortion, but also 
of the unborn child? 
Right now, under its current juris-
prudence, that unborn child is not even 
considered a human. 
America cannot be its best if we de-
value the lives of the most vulnerable 
among us. I believe that babies with 
heartbeats, fingerprints, and taste buds 
deserve some protection under the law. 
I am proud of the efforts led by our 
colleague Senator LANKFORD and oth-
ers to make sure that we actually have 
a discussion about this issue and don’t 
just sweep it under the rug and we 
don’t just let the pro-abortion lobby 
mischaracterize what we are talking 
about, as if eliminating Roe would 
eliminate abortions in America. It 
would just allow the States to do it on 
a State-by-State basis. 
But, actually, Roe was made up 
right. It created a constitutional right 
that is not even stated in the Constitu-
tion itself, and it created an arbitrary 
time limit in which abortions could be 
performed or not as a matter of con-
stitutional right. 
So I join the rest of the body and this 
country awaiting the Supreme Court’s 
ruling. I believe that it is more than 
appropriate for the Supreme Court to 
revisit its precedence that essentially 
disparaged and denigrated the right to 
life of an unborn child. 
I would yield the floor to my friend 
from Oklahoma. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. In December of 1952 
and again in December of 1953, the Su-
preme Court was packed. There were 
lines out into the hallway, with people 
waiting to get in to hear oral argu-
ments. In December, the Court would 
hear arguments on the legality of seg-
regation brought by Thurgood Mar-
shall, representing the Brown family in 
Topeka, KS. 
Just 56 years before Brown v. Board 
of Education, segregation was pro-
tected by the Supreme Court in Plessy 
v. Ferguson. They ruled that separate 
but equal facilities were constitu-
tional, thus enshrining the national

November 30, 2021 
disgrace of segregation into America— 
an absolutely terrible decision by the 
Supreme Court that haunted our Na-
tion for decades. It took 56 years before 
the Supreme Court corrected its wrong. 
Now that more than a century has 
passed since the Plessy v. Ferguson de-
cision, the Nation still celebrates the 
Court that decided the Brown v. Board 
of Education case, as Justices righted a 
great wrong against millions of people. 
There was a simple lesson in that deci-
sion: When the Court made a mistake, 
it should fix its mistake. 
In a lesser known case that affects 
just about every American now, in 2018, 
the Supreme Court overturned by a 5- 
to-4 decision 51 years of precedent on 
the collection of taxes for businesses 
called the physical presence rule. Many 
people now know it as the internet tax 
rule. It changed the way taxes were 
collected on the internet. 
When they made that decision in 
2018, there was great confusion and 
consternation, 
statements 
that 
it 
would be impossible to implement it 
and it would bring certain destruction 
to internet commerce. In fact, in the 
dissent in that 5-to-4 decision, the mi-
nority in the Court stated this: 
E-commerce has grown into a significant 
and vibrant part of our national economy 
against the backdrop of these established 
rules, including the physical-presence rule. 
Any alteration of those rules with the poten-
tial to disrupt the development of such a 
critical segment of [our] economy should be 
undertaken only by Congress. 
The Court should not act on this im-
portant question of current economic 
policy solely to correct a mistake it 
made over 50 years ago. It was hand- 
wringing by the Court, the minority 
there, that they opposed correcting the 
obvious mistake of the Court from 51 
years before because it could hurt the 
cyber economy. In other words, doing 
the right thing involved a risk. 
Well, yesterday was Cyber Monday. 
It was one of the largest single days of 
purchasing 
online 
in 
history. 
The 
Court did the right thing, and the econ-
omy kept going. There was a simple 
lesson in that decision: When the Court 
made a mistake, it should fix its mis-
take, even if it was 50 years later. 
Tomorrow, the Supreme Court of the 
United States will hear oral arguments 
in what could potentially be the most 
consequential case for human rights in 
48 years. 
Tomorrow at 10 a.m., nine Justices 
will hear arguments and ask questions 
of the attorney general of the State of 
Mississippi and counsel representing an 
abortion clinic in Mississippi. Tomor-
row morning, the Court will consider 
whether all previability prohibitions 
on elective abortions are constitu-
tional. 
Tomorrow, this Court has the oppor-
tunity to uphold the self-evident truth 
to personhood, the facts of science and 
of our heart’s declaration, the right to 
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happi-
ness. Simply stated, the Court has an 
opportunity to correct its mistake 
from 1973, 48 years ago. 
In 2018, the Mississippi Legislature 
enacted 
the 
Gestational 
Age 
Act, 
which limits abortion to 15 weeks of 
gestation except in a medical emer-
gency and cases of severe fetal abnor-
mality. 
Jackson Women’s Health Organiza-
tion, an abortion clinic in Mississippi, 
sued. Federal courts held that the law 
was in violation of the Court precedent 
in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. Now 
it is known as the Dobbs case. It stands 
before the Supreme Court at 10 a.m. to-
morrow. 
This case presents an opportunity for 
the Court to reconsider Roe v. Wade 
and turn the role of legislating on the 
issue of life back to the States, where 
it was pre-Roe v. Wade. 
In Roe v. Wade, as this body knows 
extremely well, the Supreme Court de-
cided the Constitution guarantees the 
right to have an abortion until the via-
bility of a child, with very little under-
standing of the term ‘‘viability.’’ Years 
later, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, 
the Court also said that the govern-
ment couldn’t place an undue burden 
on access to abortion, which has been 
used to block many laws that aim to 
protect women and children. 
Both decisions were completely arbi-
trary and not based in constitutional 
law. ‘‘Viability,’’ quite frankly, is im-
possible to define because children de-
velop at different speeds. One child, 
Curtis Means, left the University of 
Alabama at Birmingham Regional Neo-
natal Intensive Care Unit after he was 
prematurely delivered at 21 weeks, 1 
day—the youngest child to be born 
ever. Another child, though, may not 
survive if they were even delivered at 
32 weeks. Viability was completely in-
vented by the Court in 1973 as a stand-
ard and is impossible to actually track. 
America has not forgotten about 
these children. We have not moved on, 
and we have not just accepted Roe v. 
Wade, because when we see a child, as 
this one is at 15 weeks, we actually see 
a baby, shockingly enough. Forty-eight 
years ago, the Supreme Court may 
have decided that a woman has a right 
to an abortion, but we never lost track 
of humanity. Abortion is not just a 
medical procedure; it is the taking of a 
human life. 
I talked this morning with an abor-
tion survivor. And, yes, they do exist 
by the thousands. She is in her forties. 
She has children of her own now. She 
survived a botched abortion and was 
actually delivered alive during an abor-
tion procedure. She was taken by a 
nurse to the NICU unit of that hos-
pital, and she is still alive and thriving 
today. I sat there with that abortion 
survivor, thinking that abortion is not 
about random tissue; it is about a per-
son—quite frankly, this morning, the 
person who was sitting right in front of 
me. 
Now, I understand full well I am a 
pastor who is now a Senator. I am fully 
aware that I have a Biblical worldview. 
My dedication to children is not just 
because I am a follower of Jesus and 
believe that every person is created in 
the image of God; I also firmly can 
look at the science. The science is 
clear to anyone who is willing to get 
past the talking points and actually 
look into the womb. 
At the moment of fertilization, a new 
and distinct human being comes into 
existence. It is not just a fertilized egg; 
it is a new human. This new cell, which 
is called a zygote, shows behavior that 
is unlike the behavior of any other cell 
around it that is in the woman’s body. 
The DNA inside that cell is different 
than the DNA inside any other cell in 
the mom’s body. That cell has every-
thing that he or she needs to become a 
fully developed human being. 
Everyone listening to me right now— 
everyone—was once a single-cell zy-
gote, completely dependent on your 
mom for nutrition. That is why we en-
courage moms to eat good foods, take 
prenatal vitamins, stop smoking, and 
all those things, because we want to 
protect the development of her child. 
Why? Because we all recognize that 
that is a child, and what a mom does 
now will affect the future for that 
child. 
As the baby grows in his or her moth-
er’s womb, it continues to develop. At 
15 weeks, as this baby is—and that is 
what the Mississippi law is all about, is 
a baby who looks just like that. At 15 
weeks, a baby has a heart, lungs, skin, 
eyes, a nervous system. By 15 weeks or 
a little over 3 months of pregnancy, 
this preborn baby is moving around in 
response to touch. All of her organs are 
formed, and she just needs more time 
for them to grow and develop. Her 
heart already has four chambers. It has 
already beaten millions of times and 
pumps more than six quarts of blood 
per day. She cannot breathe outside 
the womb, but she is breathing inside 
the womb. She has arms and legs. She 
has 10 fingers and 10 toes and normally 
by this point already shows a pref-
erence for being right-handed or left- 
handed. She has eyes, lips, a nose, fin-
gernails, eyebrows, even taste buds. 
She can feel pain. 
This decision has ethical, moral, and 
medical implications. Look in the mir-
ror, anyone in this room. You have fin-
gers and toes and lips and a nose and 
fingernails and eyebrows and taste 
buds. You can feel your heart beating. 
The only difference between you right 
now and this child is time. That is it. 
But for some, it is easy to just close 
their eyes and ignore the self-evident 
fact because it is easier to talk about 
Court precedent or choice, because if 
we look at each child and recognized 
this child for who she is, it is hard to 
process that in the last 48 years, 62 mil-
lion children have died by abortion in 
America. And for some, they can’t 
allow themselves to acknowledge what 
is self-evident because it would be too 
painful to think about 62 million chil-
dren. 
Can I tell you, 62 million children is 
the combined population of Vermont, 
Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota,

Delaware, 
Montana, 
Rhode 
Island, 
Maine, New Hampshire, Hawaii, West 
Virginia, Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, 
Kansas, Mississippi, Arkansas, Nevada, 
Iowa, Utah, Connecticut, Oregon, Ken-
tucky, Louisiana, Alabama, and Okla-
homa—combined. 
A Court decision that led to the 
death of 62 million children is a Court 
precedent that needs to be discarded. 
Prior to 1973, each State had its own 
laws on abortion. That is what would 
happen again if the Court overturns 
Roe v. Wade. We will have a patchwork 
of laws on abortion, just like we do 
right now on homicide. 
In some States, like mine, if a preg-
nant mother and her child are killed, 
the perpetrator faces two charges of 
murder, one for the mom and one for 
the child. In other States, the perpe-
trator would only face one charge of 
murder because that State doesn’t rec-
ognize that child’s existence at all. I 
think that is absurd, but that is a law 
in one State, and it changes from State 
to State. People can speak to their own 
State legislators about changing that 
law in their State and about recog-
nizing the value of every child, even a 
child in the womb, but until they do, 
that child is a nonentity in some 
States. That kind of difference in 
homicide laws is allowed by the Su-
preme 
Court 
already. 
This 
Court 
should give that same right to every 
State for every preborn child, not just 
for some. 
The law being debated in the Su-
preme Court tomorrow reflects the will 
of the people of Mississippi, just as 
many pro-life laws in Oklahoma and in 
our legislature have reflected the will 
of the people of Oklahoma. 
The 
arbitrary, 
outdated 
viability 
standard established by the Court 
makes it harder for States to protect 
women from physical risk that accom-
pany late-term abortions. It makes it 
difficult to allow States to protect 
preborn babies in the second trimester, 
who can experience pain. The viability 
standard prevents States from banning 
dismemberment abortion. The viability 
standard deters States from protecting 
children diagnosed with Down syn-
drome, developmental disabilities, and 
children being aborted simply because 
they are male or female. It also pre-
vents States from protecting the lives 
of their own citizens at any stage of de-
velopment. 
I don’t understand how infants have 
become a partisan issue. I really don’t. 
There are some issues, as I talk to 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle, where I can see their perspective 
and their point of view. I may not 
agree, but I can understand their point 
of view. 
But on this issue I do not understand 
how some people see a baby sucking 
their thumb in the womb and they see 
them only as medical waste. I don’t un-
derstand how some people can support 
an abortion in one moment, but when 
they talk to a woman who has had a 
miscarriage, they immediately respond 
with ‘‘Oh, I am so sorry.’’ If a mis-
carriage is the loss of a child, then 
what is an abortion? 
I don’t understand how the same per-
son who fights to protect the right to 
abort children also brings a gift to a 
baby shower and celebrates a mom and 
a baby. How can one child be worth 
celebrating and the other child be med-
ical waste? I just don’t understand that 
compartmentalization. 
Frankly, I don’t understand how 
some people who are pro-abortion jus-
tify protecting Bald Eagle eggs in Fed-
eral law but have no problem sup-
porting the taking of human life in the 
womb. 
Children are not medical waste. Chil-
dren are beautiful, innocent, and valu-
able. Some people who are pro-abortion 
call pro-life people horrible names, and 
they say they are trying to limit a 
woman’s choice and her freedom while 
they work to protect her right to have 
her own baby literally have its arms 
and legs torn off in the womb so the 
child would bleed to death in the womb 
and then each body part would be 
suctioned out separately. 
I don’t consider that freedom. I con-
sider that cruel and inhumane. 
They say it is a woman’s choice. But 
when does the child get to choose? 
Some people in our Nation actually 
celebrate the death of children like it 
is some glorious empowerment of a 
woman that she is able to pick and 
choose which baby will live or die 
based on her decision. I don’t think 
that is empowerment. I think that is 
barbaric. 
Mother Teresa stated: ‘‘It is a pov-
erty to decide that a child must die so 
that you may live as you wish.’’ 
Change begins tomorrow. Tomorrow 
the Court will have the opportunity to 
uphold our Constitution; eradicate the 
outdated, oppressive, and deadly prece-
dent; and turn our discussion about life 
over to the legislators in each State. 
Now is the time for this Court to over-
turn Roe v. Wade. 
Our Nation prides itself on human 
rights and individual liberties, but we 
have this huge, glaring exception: We 
deny the obvious fact of a child until 
they are born. We ignore a child’s ex-
istence until it is convenient. 
I really believe, in the decades ahead, 
our Nation will catch up and we will 
look back on these years with grief. We 
will be shocked that when we saw a 
pregnancy test that said ‘‘positive,’’ 
somehow we didn’t figure out that 
meant positive for tissue; it meant 
positive for a baby. 
I look forward to the day when the 
United States will be a beacon of jus-
tice for every child and not just a few; 
when we will be a Nation that protects 
the weak, not just a Nation that stands 
up for the strong; when we will lead the 
world to protect the innocent and 
speak for those who cannot speak for 
themselves; when America is a beacon 
of hope for every child. 
Southern slave owners in 1830 denied 
humanity to their slaves. Men in 1900 
denied women a right to vote. The 
United States rounded up Japanese 
Americans in World War II and put 
them into camps. 
All three of those were considered 
legal and appropriate at the time. All 
three of those were fought tenaciously 
when they were changed, and all three 
of them are a national embarrassment 
now. 
There was a time when the Court 
ruled that separate but equal was jus-
tice. Then, six decades later, they re-
versed course, ending segregation. Jus-
tice requires, when the Court gets it 
wrong, that they correct their own 
mistake. This time there are millions 
of children counting on the Court get-
ting it right. 
‘‘Blessed are those who have regard 
for the weak; the Lord delivers them in 
times of trouble’’—Psalm 41, verse 1.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
DURHAM INVESTIGATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
November 3 of this year, Special Coun-
sel 
Durham 
indicted 
Christopher 
Steele’s 
primary 
subsource, 
Igor 
Danchenko. He indicted him on five 
counts of lying to the FBI. He lied 
about his contacts and the identity of 
his sources. 
One of the more serious lies was 
about Sergei Millian. The indictment 
shows that Danchenko alleged a phone 
call occurred between him and Millian 
about 
a 
Trump-Russia 
conspiracy. 
That call was part of the basis that the 
FBI used to get a FISA warrant on Car-
ter Page. 
Now, according to Durham, Steele’s 
source lied about the call because that 
call never happened. This is yet an-
other stunning, fatal defect against the 
Obama-Biden 
administration’s 
fake 
predicate to investigate Trump—spe-
cifically, yet another illustration of 
Justice Department and FBI failure. 
Now, as a result of these failures, 
this country has been dragged through 
the mud for years. That statement is 
well understood at this point, but I 
have more to explain about it. 
The indictment also shows that one 
of Steele’s sources was a ‘‘longtime 
participant in Democratic Party poli-
tics’’ and that he ‘‘fabricated’’ at least 
some of the information that he gave 
to Danchenko. 
This source, identified as Charles 
Dolan, ‘‘actively campaigned and par-
ticipated in calls and events as a volun-
teer on behalf of Hillary Clinton’’ dur-
ing the 2016 election. 
Another one of Danchenko’s sources 
was also a Hillary Clinton supporter. 
Charles Dolan gifted to this particular 
Russian subsource an autobiography of 
Hillary 
Clinton 
signed 
with 
these 
words: ‘‘To my good friend, a great 
Democrat.’’ 
Now—get this—while the Democrats 
were smearing Trump with false Russia 
allegations, they were the ones rubbing 
elbows with Russians and spreading 
false information in the media, and, of

course, the media, as we know, gladly 
ran with that information. For exam-
ple, President Biden’s current National 
Security Advisor, Jake Sullivan, pro-
moted the false story about the Rus-
sian bank called Alfa Bank commu-
nicating with the Trump organization, 
when he worked for the Clinton cam-
paign. 
Notably, during congressional testi-
mony, several years ago, Sullivan said 
that he wasn’t sure who Marc Elias 
represented when he presented Trump 
opposition research to the campaign. 
Now, for crying out loud, Elias was the 
Clinton campaign’s general counsel. 
My oversight work dating back to 
December 2016 has focused on the 
Democratic Party’s and Clinton cam-
paign’s links to the Steele dossier. Last 
Congress, Senator JOHNSON and I ob-
tained many records relating to Cross-
fire Hurricane. We were able to get 
many of them declassified for the pub-
lic. 
I point you to our April 15, 2020; De-
cember 3, 2020; and December 18, 2020, 
press releases on this information. 
Some of the declassified records show 
that the FBI had reports in its hand 
that showed the Steele dossier was 
most 
likely 
tainted 
with 
Russian 
disinformation. 
One document indicates that the FBI 
received a U.S. intelligence report on 
January 12, 2017, warning of an inaccu-
racy in the dossier in relation to Mi-
chael Cohen. The report assessed that 
the material was ‘‘part of a Russian 
disinformation campaign to denigrate 
U.S. foreign relations.’’ 
That same day, the FISA warrant 
against Page was renewed for the first 
time by Acting Attorney General Sally 
Yates. This is when the Obama-Biden 
administration and the Justice Depart-
ment were still in charge. 
A similar U.S. intelligence report ar-
rived on February 27, 2017, undercut-
ting a key allegation against then- 
President Trump. The report noted 
claims about Trump’s travel to Moscow 
in 2013 ‘‘were false, and they were the 
product of Russian intelligence serv-
ices infiltrat[ing] a source into the net-
work’’ of sources that contributed to 
the dossier. Just over a month later, 
the FISA warrant against Page was 
then renewed for a second time. 
I would be remiss if I didn’t mention 
that the FBI also opened a counter-
intelligence case on Danchenko and 
failed to tell the FISA Court about it. 
If this fact pattern was a movie script, 
nobody would believe it. 
With Durham’s recent indictments, 
we now have even more proof that the 
Trump-Russia collusion investigation 
had the wrong name. It should have 
been the Clinton-DNC-Russia collusion 
investigation. 
The media and many members of the 
Democratic Party ought to be ashamed 
of the falsehoods that they were 
spreading throughout these years. Our 
political discourse has been damaged 
for decades to come because of that 
scheme. 
Recently, the Washington Post had 
to correct over a dozen articles relat-
ing to its previous Russia reporting in 
light of the extensive errors made by 
that newspaper—years of errors, I 
might add. I think it is somewhat un-
precedented, and I am sure the Wash-
ington Post hated to retract and cor-
rect the record. 
As Durham proceeds, I would say 
this: Don’t take your eyes off of gov-
ernment misconduct. The Justice De-
partment and the FBI hid critical in-
formation from the FISA Court that 
would have cut against their case. 
They failed to correct the record when 
they should have corrected the record. 
Simply put, the Justice Department 
and the FBI misrepresented informa-
tion to the court. That conduct can’t 
be allowed to pass. 
REMEMBERING TOM RITER 
Mr. President, on another matter, 
just a short point I want to make about 
a very important voice in agriculture 
journalism that has gone silent. 
Every 
Tuesday 
morning—probably 
for 52 weeks out of the year—I hold a 
conference call with agriculture re-
porters and farm broadcasters to dis-
cuss news and issues impacting the 2 
percent of the Americans who feed and 
fuel the world. I am talking about our 
family farmers. 
For the past several decades, the first 
question each week came from a very 
familiar voice in the agriculture com-
munity: Tom Riter of WNAX out of 
Yankton, SD. 
Sadly, Tom passed away on Novem-
ber 21, just a few days before Thanks-
giving. 
Tom rarely—and I mean very rare-
ly—ever missed my weekly call. In 
fact, he always kicked off the discus-
sion that was carried on by probably 
another dozen people—kicked off the 
discussion with a smart question about 
farm policy. Undoubtedly, his reports 
kept his listeners informed on issues 
that make a big difference to their 
lives, their farms, their ranches, and 
businesses in the American heartland. 
He happened to be a native of Rock 
Rapids, IA, not far from Yankton. He 
was a fellow University of Northern 
Iowa Panther. Tom joined WNAX in 
1999, so he was around that station for 
22 years, I think it adds up to. Ever 
since, I have looked forward to our 
weekly discussions. 
I am grateful for Tom’s dedication to 
his craft, specifically his work to ex-
pand the public’s understanding and 
appreciation of the ag community’s 
contribution to our society—most im-
portantly, that 2 percent of the people 
in this country who produce the food 
for the other 98 percent. 
My wife Barbara and I extend our 
sympathies 
to 
Tom’s 
family 
and 
friends, the WNAX family, and his col-
leagues in the ag press community. We 
lost a very big voice for American agri-
culture. He will be greatly missed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PETERS.) Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
GUN VIOLENCE 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, our col-
lective heart as a nation is breaking 
for your State. At Oxford High School 
today, reports suggest that a 15-year- 
old turned a semiautomatic weapon on 
his classmates. Three are dead. Eight 
are injured. 
Our hearts are breaking a little bit 
harder in Connecticut because we know 
the pain that ravages a community 
when a shooting happens at a school. 
Newtown, CT, will never be the same 
after what happened there now almost 
a decade ago. 
Reports are that at Oxford High 
School nearly 100 911 messages came 
into police during the time of the 
shooting. It gives you a vision into the 
terror that happens inside a school 
when a classmate opens fire. I think 
about this, first and foremost, as a par-
ent of a seventh grader and a fourth 
grader who are part of a generation 
that accepts as part of their childhood 
the risk of not leaving school at the 
end of the day because of a violent at-
tack. That is the reality of being a kid 
in school today. I am angry about it as 
an American, but I am angry about it 
as a parent, that my children have to 
go through active shooter drills be-
cause this has become a regular facet 
of being a child in America—exposure 
to gun violence. 
It sickens me to think that my 
fourth grader has to worry about this 
when he goes to school every day. 
I understand that my Republican col-
leagues have very strong views on 
issues related to abortion, but I lis-
tened to my Republican colleagues 
come down here one after another 
today and talk about the sanctity of 
life at the very moment that moms and 
dads in Michigan were being told that 
their kids weren’t coming home be-
cause they were shot at school due to a 
country that has accepted gun violence 
due to Republicans’ fealty to the gun 
lobby. 
Do not lecture us about the sanctity, 
the importance of life, when 100 people 
every single day are losing their lives 
to guns, when kids go to school fearful 
that they won’t return home because a 
classmate will turn a gun on them, 
when it is in our control whether this 
happens. 
You care about life? Then get these 
dangerous military-style weapons off 
the streets, out of our schools. 
You care about life? Make sure that 
criminals don’t get guns by making 
sure that everybody goes through a 
background check in this country. 
This only happens in the United 
States of America. There is no other 
nation in the high-income world in 
which kids worry about being shot

November 30, 2021 
when they go to school. It happens here 
in America because we choose to let it 
happen. 
We are not unlucky. This is purpose-
ful. This is a choice made by the U.S. 
Senate to sit on our hands and do noth-
ing while kids die. 
It doesn’t even involve any political 
risk. The changes we are talking about 
in order to make our schools safe 
places, they are supported by the vast 
majority of Americans, Republicans 
and Democrats. And yet the gun lobby 
and the gun industry is more impor-
tant to half of the Members of the Sen-
ate than is the safety of our kids, and 
that is infuriating. 
Make no mistake about it, there is a 
silent message of endorsement sent to 
would-be killers, sent to individuals 
whose brains are spiraling out of con-
trol when the highest levels of the U.S. 
Government does nothing, shooting 
after shooting. Somewhere in these 
broken brains, they have convinced 
themselves that they can right per-
ceived wrongs by firing a gun into a 
crowd. And when Congress—when the 
highest, most important, most power-
ful leaders in the land do nothing, 
shooting after shooting, you can under-
stand why those broken brains imply 
that as endorsement. We have become 
part of the problem. Our silence has be-
come complicity. 
And I am here to tell you that there 
is a very low likelihood that your child 
will die in a school shooting. It is still 
a very, very infrequent occurrence in 
this country, given the number of kids 
who walk into a school every day. But 
the very fact that every child fears for 
their life, the very fact that every par-
ent thinks about this when they send 
their kid to school, that is both a 
moral and practical stain on this coun-
try because kids’ brains can’t learn 
when they fear for their lives. No par-
ent should have to sit down and talk to 
their kid about why, even though you 
see this happen in Newtown and you 
see this happen in Parkland and you 
see this happen in Michigan and you 
see this happen in California, it won’t 
happen to you, dear. Because when 
these kids see it on TV every single 
day, you can’t blame them for coming 
to the conclusion that it may happen 
to them. 
I remember watching on TV once a 
young woman in the aftermath of a 
school shooting. There are so many of 
them now that I can’t even remember 
which one this was. And she said to the 
TV reporter who was interviewing her: 
I just assumed that it would happen at 
my school eventually. 
What a sad state of affairs that this 
is what it has come to. 
I am beyond my tipping point, but I 
needed to come to the floor today be-
cause having sat in that chair listening 
to my colleagues tell me how much 
they care about human life—well, you 
have an opportunity to do something 
about it. You have an opportunity to 
save lives right now. Kids that are 
walking into schools tomorrow need 
you—need you—to step up and pass 
laws that are going to make sure that 
only responsible people own guns. And 
the guns that are used in these school 
shootings—the semiautomatic rifles, 
the AR–15 variants—they stay in the 
hands of law enforcement. 
And even if you don’t believe that 
those laws will have the practical con-
sequence of stopping every school 
shooting, 
please 
acknowledge 
that 
there is a moral impact of the actions 
that we take. By signaling to everyone 
in this country—but in particular these 
individuals 
who 
are 
contemplating 
these evil actions—that we don’t ac-
cept this level of carnage, there will be 
an impact. And I tell you that because 
I know history. 
There are two massive declines in the 
murder rate in this country in the last 
100 years. It is not coincidental to the 
10-year period after the two most sig-
nificant antigun violence measures 
passed by Congress. 
The first big decline is in the late 
1930s and 1940s, right after Congress 
passes its first bill regulating the pos-
session of firearms in this country. The 
second big decline is in the 1990s and 
early 2000s right after Congress passes 
the universal background checks law 
and the ban on assault-style weapons. 
That is not coincidental. It is be-
cause those laws had a practical effect 
on crime but also a moral effect as 
well. The proof is right there in front 
of you of what can happen, of how 
many lives can be saved if we stand up 
and act. 
So, please, I beg my colleagues, if 
you are going to come down here and 
talk about the sanctity of life, explain 
to the American people why the gun 
lobby matters more than the safety of 
our children who are walking into 
school every day fearing for their life.

MORNING BUSINESS 
TRIBUTE TO KEVIN ‘‘ROWDY’’ 
MURPHY 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
rise today to acknowledge and honor 
MAJ Kevin ‘‘Rowdy’’ Murphy for his 
dedicated service in the U.S. Air Force 
and in the Senate as part of the Legis-
lative Defense Fellowship. Major Mur-
phy joined my office in January of this 
year, where he has expertly served as a 
trusted adviser and critical member of 
my team. He is one of the Air Force’s 
finest fighter pilots, having capably 
flown the F–15E Strike Eagle for the 
past decade and graduated from the 
distinguished 
Air 
Force 
Weapons 
School. 
Rowdy served with distinction while 
assigned to my office. He was instru-
mental in bringing a partner fighter 
training mission to Ft. Smith, AR, he 
helped establish a Defense Department 
aviation safety council, and he de-
signed legislative defenses against the 
threat of fiber optic cables from China. 
While Major Murphy excelled at his 
legislative duties, he truly distin-
guished himself during the evacuation

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8827 
November 30, 2021 
of Kabul. As Afghanistan collapsed, 
thousands of Americans and Afghan 
partners reached out to my office for 
assistance. Overwhelmed by a flood of 
stranded civilians a world away, Rowdy 
snapped into action. He quickly orga-
nized a process for triaging and assist-
ing American citizens, green card hold-
ers, and Afghans who had fought along-
side 
American 
forces. 
He 
created 
‘‘baseball cards’’ for isolated Ameri-
cans in Kabul, which were passed along 
to the 10th Mountain Division and spe-
cial forces units. He helped techno-
logically illiterate evacuees navigate 
the State Department’s onerous online 
registration for evacuation, and in doz-
ens of cases, he alerted the State De-
partment to the presence of American 
citizens stuck inside a collapsing coun-
try. In conjunction with my staff in 
Arkansas, DC, and even one inside 
Kabul’s 
airport 
perimeter, 
Rowdy 
worked a long stream of 20-hour days 
to exfiltrate evacuees. 
It is difficult to quantify the number 
of lives that Major Murphy saved. He 
provided direct planning support and 
guidance to 76 evacuees, drawing on his 
expertise as a fighter pilot to design 
and execute dozens of successful evacu-
ation strategies. The evacuees ranged 
from a 1-month-old infant to an 83- 
year-old cancer patient, all of whom 
are now safely free of the Taliban’s 
grasp. During the course of these mis-
sions, he coordinated directly with 
Joint Special Operations Task Force 
and NATO tier-1 units. Rowdy indi-
rectly helped countless others. He re-
ceived, logged, and relayed innumer-
able evacuation requests over those 2 
weeks and directly passed along the 
State 
Department’s 
terror 
warning 
prior to the suicide bomb attack on the 
airport’s Abbey Gate. At least 70 people 
received this notification from Rowdy 
and took shelter, a testament to his or-
ganization and persistence. 
Those are the statistics. The personal 
stories are far more profound. There 
was Mikey, a brave translator who 
served alongside U.S. troops. When 
Mikey’s wife and son were shot by the 
Taliban, Rowdy acted as a personal 911 
dispatcher, staying on the line with 
Mikey’s family of four for over 5 days 
and exhausting countless options to 
safely deliver them from the throngs 
outside the airport gates. After nearly 
a week of constant communication, 
stopping only to sleep for a few hours a 
night, 
Rowdy’s 
direct 
coordination 
with U.S. military personnel succeeded 
in delivering Mikey’s family to safety 
and medical care. When Mikey finally 
made it through the airport gates, he 
was crestfallen to learn that Rowdy 
was in DC, and not there to greet him 
inside the airport. 
My staff described those 2 weeks in 
August as relentless and exhausting. 
When Rowdy would take 3 to 4 hours a 
night to sleep, he would wake to dozens 
of new messages from people stranded 
in Kabul, pleading for help. One mem-
ber of my DC staff, a marine with com-
bat 
experience 
in 
Afghanistan’s 
Helmand province, said the personal 
toll from 2 weeks of helping desperate 
people pleading for rescue was more 
profound and exacting than his war-
time service. Yet throughout it all, 
Rowdy stayed calm, cool, and profes-
sional. He kept a relentless focus on his 
mission. When the final American 
troops left Afghanistan, Rowdy was in-
structed to put his phone down for a 
few days to recover. As a testament to 
his resilience, he ignored those instruc-
tions and kept working on alternate 
evacuation options for those left be-
hind. 
Major Murphy was recently invited 
to the wedding of one of his evacuees, 
as a token of deep gratitude and affec-
tion for the Air Force major who 
helped deliver them to safety. His inge-
nuity, resourcefulness, stamina, and 
composure under pressure reflect the 
best that America has to offer. 
I want to sincerely thank Rowdy and 
his wife, Laurel, for a year of exem-
plary service in my office. But I am es-
pecially grateful to him for those 2 
weeks in August, when he rose to the 
challenge that history had thrust upon 
him. It has been a privilege to watch 
him work, and he will always have an 
open door here in my office. It is my 
sincere hope that the Air Force sees fit 
to decorate Rowdy after his distin-
guished service during those dark days. 
My best to the Murphy family, and 
‘‘Banzai!’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO MARK HAGOPIAN AND 
JAY ANDERSON 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am proud to recognize Mark Hagopian 
of 
Auburn 
and 
Jay 
Anderson 
of 
Sandown 
as 
November’s 
Granite 
Staters of the Month. Mark and Jay 
partnered together to raise COVID–19 
relief money for Granite Staters by de-
signing and selling their own special 
IPA, which they named ‘‘Brain Fog.’’ 
In March of 2020, Mark Hagopian was 
rushed to Elliot Hospital in Man-
chester and was immediately admitted 
to the ICU to be treated for COVID–19. 
After 3 weeks on a ventilator, Mark 
miraculously recovered thanks to the 
hard work of the nurses and medical 
staff—or ‘‘super heroes,’’ as he calls 
them. 
After his recuperation, Mark wanted 
to help others, which led him to part-
ner with Elliot Hospital to set up the 
NH COVID–19 Family Relief Fund. Pro-
ceeds go to Granite Staters who con-
tinue to feel the impacts of the COVID– 
19 pandemic and can help these individ-
uals with healthcare copays, rehabili-
tation, groceries, and other costs. 
When Mark asked his friend Jay An-
derson, owner of From the Barrel 
Brewing Company in Derry, about 
teaming up, Jay said it was a ‘‘no- 
brainer.’’ They got to work designing a 
special IPA with the proceeds going to 
the NH COVID–19 Family Relief Fund. 
Since Mark had been a regular cus-
tomer, Jay knew exactly what type of 
beer Mark would like, and together, 
they named the final product ‘‘Brain 
Fog.’’ 
At the launch event for ‘‘Brain Fog,’’ 
Granite Staters mingled and heard 
from Mark and Jay about the NH 
COVID–19 Family Relief Fund. The 
beer itself was wildly successful, as evi-
denced by the fact that Mark and Jay 
sold out of all the cases of ‘‘Brain Fog’’ 
that first weekend. The duo plans to 
revive the brew and continue fund-
raising for the Elliot Hospital in the 
future. 
Mark and Jay are shining examples 
of what it means to be Granite Staters. 
After undergoing intense medical hard-
ship, Mark turned around and started 
giving back to his community, and Jay 
was more than ready to help. Not only 
did they show impressive innovation 
and entrepreneurship, but they also 
brought people together during an es-
pecially hard time as our State and 
country continue to feel the effects of 
the COVID–19 pandemic. I am honored 
to name them as Granite Staters of the 
Month, and I look forward to seeing 
how their future endeavors continue to 
make our communities stronger.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, 
Mr. DAINES, Mr. RISCH, Mr. 
CRAMER, 
Mr. 
HOEVEN, 
Mr. 
LANKFORD, Mr. CASSIDY, Mr. 
MARSHALL, Mrs. HYDE-SMITH, 
Mr. LEE, and Ms. MURKOWSKI): 
S. 3287. A bill to provide for the de-
velopment and issuance of a plan to in-
crease oil and gas production on Fed-
eral land in conjunction with a draw-
down of petroleum reserves from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve; to the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Re-
sources. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the need for more American energy, 
not energy that the President is beg-
ging to OPEC or Russia to produce for 
America but American energy. 
Last week, President Biden ordered 
the release of oil from the Strategic 
Petroleum Reserve. The President, by 
doing that, in my opinion, is just pre-
tending to show concern about the high 
cost of energy in this country. I will 
get into why I think he is only pre-
tending to show it because the amount 
he released is so very little. In reality, 
this President’s call to release energy 
oil from the Strategic Petroleum Re-
serve was an admission of failure of 
this President and this administration. 
Releasing oil from the Reserve is 
something that Presidents did in the 
past during times of war, the Iraq war, 
after Hurricane Katrina, and during 
the Arab Spring. In other words, it is 
something Presidents do in times of 
crisis. 
Well, President Biden doesn’t want to 
admit that he has created an emer-
gency crisis in our country, but his ac-
tions of calling on the release from the 
Strategic Reserve—the actions speak 
louder than his words. By releasing oil 
from the Reserve now, the President is 
admitting what every American knows, 
that America has an energy crisis and 
it is not for lack of the fact that we 
have plenty of energy reserves here in 
the United States. 
Last week, an estimated 50 million 
people 
over 
Thanksgiving 
weekend 
took to the roads. Those who drove 
paid the most for gasoline that they 
have in 7 years. Gasoline and diesel 
fuel prices are sky-high, and they have 
increased more than a dollar a gallon 
since Joe Biden took office just in Jan-
uary. 
Why is it happening? Well, it is eco-
nomics 101, really. You have demand; 
you have supply. Demand is up; supply 
is down. With the end of the lockdown, 
demand for gasoline has increased as 
people took to the roads. Yet domestic 
supply is still below the peak that we 
reached under President Trump. 
The Biden administration wants us 
to believe that releasing oil will solve 
the problem when he taps the Strategic 
Reserve, but I don’t even think Presi-
dent Biden believes it. I am not sure 
they actually know what they are 
doing. If you watched that press con-
ference with the Secretary of Energy 
last week, she was asked how much oil 
the American people use. She admitted 
she didn’t know. She said: I don’t have 
a number in front of me. She didn’t

know how much oil, how much energy 
Americans use. The Nation’s top en-
ergy official doesn’t know how much 
oil the American people use so how can 
she then know that the amount to call 
for the release is the right amount or 
not? She is President Biden’s top lieu-
tenant in the war on American energy. 
She doesn’t know how much we use. 
Well, the media has broadly reported 
that the total amount that Joe Biden 
is releasing from the Petroleum Re-
serve is what the American people use 
every 21⁄2 days—every 21⁄2 days. That is 
the total amount that is being re-
leased. It is the amount that we in the 
United States use every 21⁄2 days. This 
is a drop in the bucket when it comes 
to oil prices and energy prices and 
what people are paying at the pump. 
It is not a long-term solution. It is 
not even a short-term solution. It is 
just a carefully created sound bite. Oil 
production is down by nearly 2 million 
barrels a day compared to the peak 
under President Trump. It is not a sur-
prise when you take a look at the at-
tack on American energy that Presi-
dent Biden and this administration 
have continued to do since day 1, when 
he killed the Keystone XL Pipeline. 
The administration also announced 
last week, without any fanfare, with-
out the President making a statement 
at the White House—the Department of 
the Interior said: Oh, by the way, 
American people, we are going to do 
this the day after Thanksgiving, when 
you are busy doing other things, maybe 
going shopping, doing other things and 
not paying attention to the news of the 
day. This administration called for ad-
ditional fees, more taxes, more ex-
penses on oil and gas leases on Federal 
land. That impacts my State dramati-
cally. This is in addition to the fees 
that the President is also including in 
this massive tax-and-spending bill that 
the Senate is going to be considering. 
This is also economics 101. Higher 
fees on the cost of producing oil means 
higher prices for people at the pump— 
astonishing—making 
it 
harder 
to 
produce and more expensive to produce 
American energy. Begging OPEC and 
Russia to produce more to sell to us is 
a jackpot for Vladimir Putin. So if 
President Biden and his Department of 
the Interior get their way, the prices 
will go up even higher. Inflation is here 
to stay under the Democrats. 
The American people deserve better. 
They deserve real solutions in this en-
ergy crisis that this administration has 
created. Higher fees are only going to 
get passed on to consumers. Instead of 
spending our savings, we should be pro-
ducing more American energy. Why are 
we sending this money to Vladimir 
Putin and begging him to produce more 
so we can send him even more money? 
That is the policy of this administra-
tion. 
Today, I am introducing legislation 
that says an administration needs to 
develop a plan to increase oil and gas 
production anytime an administration 
taps the Reserve unless there is an en-
ergy supply emergency like Katrina, 
like a war. Those are the things that 
are legitimate reasons to release en-
ergy from the Strategic Reserve. The 
Reserve is for emergencies, not for 
sound bites. It is not supposed to be a 
bandaid for bad policies. 
If the President is tapping the Re-
serve, he also ought to increase Amer-
ican energy production. So I urge my 
colleagues to return to the policies 
that gave us the best economic times 
in my lifetime, return to the policies 
that made us energy-independent as a 
nation for the first time in 70 years, re-
turn to the policies that made us the 
No. 1 producer of petroleum in the 
world. We are much stronger and bet-
ter as a nation if we are selling Amer-
ican energy to our friends than if we 
have to buy it from our enemies. Ap-
parently, the President does not fully 
grasp that or believe in that or he 
would not be begging Vladimir Putin 
to produce more energy; he would be 
encouraging America to produce more 
energy, which we have here. 
It is time to stop the restrictions on 
energy production, time to stop the 
rush to raise billions in taxes, time to 
stop the President and the Democrats’ 
declared war on American energy.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 460—DESIG-
NATING NOVEMBER 2021 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL RUNAWAY PREVENTION 
MONTH’’ 
Ms. DUCKWORTH (for herself, Mr. 
SULLIVAN, Mrs. MURRAY, Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI, Mr. PADILLA, Mr. DURBIN, and 
Mr. KING) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 460 
Whereas results from the Voices of Youth 
Count national survey, which was published 
by Chapin Hall at the University of Chicago 
in ‘‘Missed Opportunities: Youth Homeless-
ness in America’’, indicate that, between 2015 
and 2017, an estimated 4,200,000 youth and 
young adults between 13 and 24 years of age 
experienced homelessness during a 12-month 
period, including— 
(1) an estimated 700,000 youth between 13 
and 17 years of age who experienced unac-
companied homelessness; and 
(2) an estimated 3,500,000 young adults be-
tween 18 and 24 years of age; 
Whereas the rates of youth experiencing 
homelessness are similar in rural and non- 
rural areas; 
Whereas, often, runaway youth— 
(1) have been expelled from their homes by 
their families; 
(2) have experienced abuse and trauma; 
(3) are involved in the foster care system; 
(4) lack resources to secure their own basic 
needs; and 
(5) are ineligible or unable to access med-
ical or mental health resources; 
Whereas individuals without a high school 
degree or general educational development 
certificate are nearly four times more likely 
to report homelessness than their peers; 
Whereas youth of color and lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, queer, or questioning 
(commonly referred to as ‘‘LGBTQ’’) youth 
experience higher rates of homelessness than 
their heterosexual and white peers; 
Whereas pregnant youth, parents who are 
25 years of age or younger, and their children 
experience higher rates of homelessness than 
youth and young adults without children; 
Whereas American Indian and Alaska Na-
tive youth are the group most at risk for ex-
periencing homelessness, as 9 percent of 13 to 
17 year olds in such group reported experi-
encing homelessness during a 12-month pe-
riod, a rate more than double any other 
group; 
Whereas runaway and homeless youth are 
at an increased risk of exploitation and be-
coming victims of sex and labor trafficking, 
and between 19 percent and 49 percent of 
young individuals who experience homeless-
ness will become victims of trafficking; 
Whereas youth who run away from home or 
from foster care are at increased risk of en-
countering the police and the court system 
due to laws that prohibit certain actions 
necessary for the survival of homeless youth; 
Whereas preventing youth from running 
away from home and from foster care and 
supporting youth in high risk situations 
should be community priorities; 
Whereas the future of the United States 
depends on children and the value placed on 
their ability to acquire the knowledge, 
skills, and opportunities necessary to suc-
cessfully develop into safe, healthy, and pro-
ductive adults; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic, which 
was declared a national emergency under the 
National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et 
seq.), has negatively impacted homeless 
youth; 
Whereas effective programs that support 
runaway youth and assist youth and their 
families by providing safe and stable homes 
succeed because of partnerships created 
among families, youth-based advocacy orga-
nizations, community-based human service 
agencies, law enforcement agencies, schools, 
faith-based organizations, and businesses; 
and 
Whereas the National Runaway Safeline 
and the National Network for Youth are 
leading the promotion of National Runaway 
Prevention Month in November 2021— 
(1) to raise awareness of the runaway and 
homeless youth crisis and the issues faced by 
runaway and homeless youth; 
(2) to educate the public about solutions 
and the role the public can play in ending 
youth homelessness; and 
(3) to bring together a broad range of 
stakeholders to tackle the crisis of youth 
homelessness: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 2021 as ‘‘National 
Runaway Prevention Month’’; and 
(2) recognizes and supports the goals and 
ideals of National Runaway Prevention 
Month.

Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 461 
Whereas, as of the end of 2020, an estimated 
37,700,000 people were living with human im-
munodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired im-
munodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), including 
1,720,000 children; 
Whereas, in the United States, more than 
770,000 people with AIDS have died since the 
beginning of the HIV epidemic, including

November 30, 2021 
nearly 16,000 deaths among people with diag-
nosed HIV in 2019, with the disease dis-
proportionately affecting communities of 
color; 
Whereas each year nearly 40,000 people be-
come newly diagnosed with HIV in the 
United States; 
Whereas communities of color are dis-
proportionately affected by HIV in the 
United States; 
Whereas, in order to address the HIV epi-
demic in the United States, on August 18, 
1990, Congress enacted the Ryan White Com-
prehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act 
(Public Law 101–381; commonly referred to as 
the ‘‘Ryan White CARE Act’’) to provide pri-
mary medical care and essential support 
services for people living with HIV who are 
uninsured or underinsured; 
Whereas the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Pro-
gram provides services and support for over 
half of all people diagnosed with HIV in the 
United States; 
Whereas to further focus attention on the 
HIV/AIDS epidemic among minority commu-
nities in the United States, in 1998 the Mi-
nority AIDS Initiative was established to 
provide funds to State and local institutions 
and organizations to best serve the health 
care costs and support the needs of racial 
and ethnic minorities living with HIV; 
Whereas the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals established a global tar-
get to end AIDS as a public health threat by 
2030; 
Whereas, in order to further address the 
global HIV/AIDS epidemic, in 2003, Congress 
and the White House created the President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR); 
Whereas the United States President’s 
Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) 
program remains the largest commitment in 
history by any country to combat a single 
disease; 
Whereas, as of 2020, PEPFAR has supported 
treatment for approximately 17,200,000 peo-
ple, and has enabled 2,800,000 infants of 
mothers living with HIV to be born HIV-free; 
Whereas, in fiscal year 2020, PEPFAR di-
rectly supported HIV testing and counseling 
for 50,000,000 people; 
Whereas the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, 
Tuberculosis and Malaria was launched in 
2002, and, as of 2020, has helped provide 
antiretroviral 
therapy 
to 
approximately 
21,900,000 people living with HIV/AIDS and to 
686,000 pregnant women to prevent the trans-
mission of HIV/AIDS to their children, sav-
ing an estimated 44,000,000 lives; 
Whereas the United States is the largest 
donor to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tu-
berculosis and Malaria, and every $1 contrib-
uted by the United States leverages an addi-
tional $2 from other donors, as required by 
law; 
Whereas considerable progress has been 
made in the fight against HIV/AIDS, includ-
ing a nearly 30-percent reduction in new HIV 
infections, an over 50-percent reduction in 
new HIV infections among children, and an 
over 45-percent reduction in the number of 
AIDS-related deaths between 2010 and 2020; 
Whereas approximately 27,500,000 people 
had access to antiretroviral therapy in 2020, 
compared to only 7,800,000 people who had ac-
cess to such therapy in 2010; 
Whereas research funded by the National 
Institutes of Health found that HIV treat-
ment not only saves the lives of people living 
with HIV, but people living with HIV on ef-
fective antiretroviral therapy and who are 
durably virally suppressed cannot sexually 
transmit HIV—proving that HIV treatment 
is prevention; 
Whereas it is estimated that, without 
treatment, half of all infants living with HIV 
will die before their second birthday; 
Whereas, despite the remarkable progress 
in combating HIV, significant challenges re-
main; 
Whereas there were approximately 1,500,000 
new HIV infections in 2020 globally, struc-
tural barriers continue to make testing and 
treatment programs inaccessible to highly 
vulnerable populations, and an estimated 
6,100,000 people living with HIV globally still 
do not know their HIV status; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reports that nearly 37,000 
people were diagnosed with HIV in the 
United States in 2018 and 14 percent of the 
1,200,000 people in the United States living 
with HIV are not aware of their HIV status; 
Whereas men who have sex with men 
(MSM), particularly young MSM of color, are 
the population most affected by HIV in the 
United States; 
Whereas southern States bear the greatest 
burden of HIV in the United States, account-
ing for 51 percent of new infections in 2018; 
Whereas people living with HIV are fre-
quently susceptible to other infections, such 
as hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis; 
Whereas the opioid and heroin epidemics 
have led to increased numbers of new HIV in-
fections among people who inject drugs, and 
the crisis has disproportionately affected 
nonurban areas, where HIV prevalence rates 
have been low historically and have limited 
services for HIV prevention and treatment 
and substance use disorder treatment; 
Whereas 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic 
has 
placed a significant burden on the public 
health systems across the United States and 
the globe; 
Whereas December 1 of each year is inter-
nationally recognized as ‘‘World AIDS Day’’; 
and 
Whereas, in 2021, commemorations for 
World AIDS Day recognize the need for 
‘‘Ending the HIV Epidemic: Equitable Ac-
cess, Everyone’s Voice’’: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of World 
AIDS Day, including the goal to achieve zero 
new HIV infections, zero discrimination, and 
zero AIDS-related deaths; 
(2) commends the efforts and achievements 
in combating HIV/AIDS through the Ryan 
White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act, 
the Minority HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention, the 
National Institutes of Health, the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminis-
tration, the Office of Minority Health, and 
the Office of the Secretary of Health and 
Human Services; 
(3) commends the efforts and achievements 
in combating HIV/AIDS made by PEPFAR, 
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis 
and Malaria, and the Joint United Nations 
Programme on HIV/AIDS; 
(4) supports efforts to end the HIV epi-
demic in the United States and around the 
world by 2030; 
(5) supports continued funding for preven-
tion, care, and treatment services, and re-
search programs for communities impacted 
by HIV and people living with HIV in the 
United States and globally; 
(6) urges, in order to ensure that an AIDS- 
free generation is achievable, rapid action by 
all countries toward further expansion and 
scale-up of antiretroviral treatment pro-
grams, including efforts to reduce disparities 
and improve access for children to life-sav-
ing medications; 
(7) encourages the scaling up of com-
prehensive prevention services, including 
biomedical and structural interventions, to 
ensure inclusive access to programs and ap-
propriate protections for all people at risk of 
contracting HIV, especially in communities 
disproportionately impacted; 
(8) calls for greater focus on the HIV-re-
lated vulnerabilities of women and girls, in-
cluding women and girls at risk for or who 
have survived violence or faced discrimina-
tion as a result of the disease; 
(9) supports continued leadership by the 
United States in domestic, bilateral, multi-
lateral, and private sector efforts to fight 
HIV; 
(10) encourages input from civil society in 
the development and implementation of do-
mestic and global HIV policies and programs 
that guide the response; 
(11) encourages and supports greater de-
grees of ownership and shared responsibility 
by developing countries in order to ensure 
the sustainability of the domestic responses 
to HIV/AIDS by those countries; and 
(12) urges other members of the inter-
national community to sustain and scale up 
their support for and financial contributions 
to efforts around the world to combat HIV.

SUPPORT 
FOR 
EARLY 
DETEC-
TION AND TREATMENT OF LUNG 
CANCER 
Ms. SMITH (for herself, Mr. RUBIO, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mrs. CAPITO, and Mr. 
SCOTT
of South Carolina) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 462 
Whereas lung cancer is the leading cause of 
cancer-related death among men and women 
in the United States, accounting for more 
deaths than colon cancer, breast cancer, and 
prostate cancer combined; 
Whereas 1 in 15 men and 1 in 17 women in 
the United States will develop lung cancer 
during their lifetime; 
Whereas it is estimated that, in 2021, 
235,760 individuals in the United States will 
be diagnosed with lung cancer, and 131,880 in-
dividuals will die from the disease; 
Whereas lung cancer incidence is decreas-
ing twice as fast in men as in women, each 
year more women die from lung cancer than 
breast cancer, and by 2035, it is estimated 
that more women will die from lung cancer 
than men; 
Whereas disparities in lung cancer screen-
ing, diagnosis, treatment, and mortality are 
well-documented, and Black men have the 
highest incidence of lung cancer and the 
highest mortality rate from lung cancer of 
any racial or ethnic group; 
Whereas, annually, lung cancer in individ-
uals who have never smoked is the seventh 
leading cause of cancer-related death and ac-
counts for between 17,000 and 26,000 deaths in 
the United States; 
Whereas women who have never smoked 
are more likely to be diagnosed with lung 
cancer than men who have never smoked; 
Whereas, in the United States, the propor-
tion of lung cancers diagnosed in individuals 
who have never smoked is increasing; 
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for local-
ized lung cancer is 60 percent, yet only about 
18 percent of lung cancers are diagnosed at 
this stage; 
Whereas screening individuals at high risk 
of lung cancer using low-dose computed to-
mography can detect lung cancer earlier 
than other forms of screening and ultimately 
save lives; 
Whereas lung cancer screening can effec-
tively reduce lung cancer mortality, but, an-
nually, only between 2.8 and 7.2 percent of 
individuals in the United States eligible for

lung cancer screening undergo lung cancer 
screening with low-dose computed tomog-
raphy; 
Whereas current lung cancer screening 
guidelines help catch cancer early for indi-
viduals at high risk of lung cancer, leading 
to a higher likelihood of successful treat-
ment, but can preclude screening for individ-
uals who develop lung cancer, including indi-
viduals who have never smoked but have 
other risk factors, such as family history of 
lung cancer, exposure to secondhand smoke, 
or exposure to radon, which is the second 
leading cause of lung cancer; and 
Whereas educational efforts can increase 
awareness of lung cancer and lung cancer 
screening among the general public, patients 
and their families, and health care workers, 
thereby increasing the early detection of 
lung cancer: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 2021 as ‘‘National 
Lung Cancer Awareness Month’’; 
(2) supports the purposes and ideals of Na-
tional Lung Cancer Awareness Month; 
(3) promotes efforts to increase awareness 
of, and education about, lung cancer among 
individuals in the United States; 
(4) champions efforts to increase lung can-
cer screening by raising awareness among, 
and improving access for, individuals who 
are eligible for lung cancer screening; 
(5) recognizes the need for research on the 
early screening, diagnosis, and treatment of 
lung cancer; and 
(6) encourages the people of the United 
States to observe National Lung Cancer 
Awareness Month with appropriate aware-
ness and educational activities.

AWARENESS MONTH 
Mr. YOUNG (for himself, Mr. CARDIN, 
and Mr. BRAUN) submitted the fol-
lowing resolution; which was consid-
ered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 463 
Whereas stomach cancer, also known as 
gastric cancer, is one of the most difficult 
cancers to detect in the early stages of the 
disease, which contributes to high mortality 
rates; 
Whereas stomach cancer occurs when can-
cer cells develop in the lining of the stom-
ach; 
Whereas stomach cancer is the fifth most 
common type of cancer worldwide; 
Whereas, in 2021, an estimated— 
(1) 26,560 cases of stomach cancer will be 
diagnosed in the United States; and 
(2) 11,180 people in the United States will 
die from stomach cancer; 
Whereas the estimated 5-year survival rate 
for stomach cancer is only 32.4 percent; 
Whereas, in the United States, stomach 
cancer is more prevalent among racial and 
ethnic minorities; 
Whereas increased awareness of, and edu-
cation about, stomach cancer among pa-
tients and health care providers could im-
prove timely recognition of stomach cancer 
symptoms; 
Whereas more research into early diag-
nosis, screening, and treatment for stomach 
cancer is needed; and 
Whereas November 2021 is an appropriate 
month to observe Stomach Cancer Aware-
ness Month: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals of Stomach Cancer 
Awareness Month; 
(2) supports efforts to increase awareness 
of, and education about, stomach cancer 
among the general public of the United 
States; 
(3) recognizes the need for additional re-
search into early diagnosis, screening, and 
treatment for stomach cancer; and

S. RES. 464 
Whereas there are far too many children 
outside of permanent family care and in the 
United States foster care system, who are 
waiting to be adopted; 
Whereas the Children’s Bureau, an office of 
the Administration for Children and Fami-
lies within the Department of Health and 
Human Services, supports programs, re-
search, and monitoring to help eliminate 
barriers to adoption and find permanent fam-
ilies for children; 
Whereas, every day, loving and nurturing 
families are strengthened and expanded when 
committed and dedicated individuals make 
an important difference in the life of a child 
through adoption; 
Whereas 
the 
coronavirus 
disease 
2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic has presented unprece-
dented challenges to— 
(1) the United States; 
(2) the foster care system, including kin-
ship care; 
(3) prospective adoptive parents; and 
(4) the children awaiting permanency; 
Whereas foster care systems, prospective 
adoptive parents, and the children awaiting 
permanency have stepped up in brave and in-
spiring ways in order to meet these chal-
lenges; 
Whereas the President traditionally issues 
an annual proclamation to declare the 
month of November as National Adoption 
Month, and the President has proclaimed No-
vember 2021 as National Adoption Month; 
Whereas National Adoption Day has been 
celebrated as a collective national effort to 
find permanent and loving families for chil-
dren in the foster care system; and 
Whereas the Saturday before Thanksgiving 
has been recognized as National Adoption 
Day since at least 2000, and in 2021, the Sat-
urday before Thanksgiving is November 20: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the goals and ideals of Na-
tional Adoption Month and National Adop-
tion Day; 
(2) recognizes that every child should have 
a permanent and loving family; and 
(3) encourages the people of the United 
States to consider adoption during the 
month of November and throughout the 
year.

partment of Energy, to prescribe mili-
tary personnel strengths for such fiscal

ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of subtitle B of title XII, add 
the following: 
SEC. 1216. STATUS OF WOMEN AND GIRLS IN AF-
GHANISTAN. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Since May 2021, the escalation of vio-
lent conflict in Afghanistan has forcibly dis-
placed an estimated 655,000 civilians, and 80 
percent of those forced to flee are women and 
children. 
(2) Since regaining control of Afghanistan 
in August 2021, the Taliban have taken ac-
tions reminiscent of their brutal rule in the 
late 1990s, including by cracking down on 
protesters, detaining and beating journalists, 
reestablishing the Ministry for the Pro-
motion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, and 
requiring women to study at secondary 
schools and universities in gender-segregated 
classrooms while wearing Islamic attire. 
(3) Until the Taliban assumed control of 
the country in August 2021, the women and 
girls of Afghanistan had achieved much since 
2001, even as insecurity, poverty, under-
development, and patriarchal norms contin-
ued to limit their rights and opportunities in 
much of Afghanistan. 
(4) Through strong support from the United 
States and the international community— 
(A) female enrollment in public schools in 
Afghanistan continued to increase through 
2015, with an estimated high of 50 percent of 
school age girls attending; and 
(B) by 2019— 
(i) women held political leadership posi-
tions, and women served as ambassadors; and 
(ii) women served as professors, judges, 
prosecutors, defense attorneys, police, mili-
tary members, health professionals, journal-
ists, humanitarian and developmental aid 
workers, and entrepreneurs. 
(5) Efforts to empower women and girls in 
Afghanistan continue to serve the national 
interests of Afghanistan and the United 
States because women are sources of peace 
and economic progress. 
(6) With the return of Taliban control, the 
United States has little ability to preserve 
the internationally recognized human rights 
of women and girls in Afghanistan, and those 
women and girls may again face the intimi-
dation and marginalization they faced under 
the last Taliban regime. 
(7) Women and girls in Afghanistan are 
again facing gender-based violence, includ-
ing— 
(A) forced marriage; 
(B) intimate partner and domestic vio-
lence; 
(C) sexual harassment; 
(D) sexual violence, including rape; and 
(E) emotional and psychological violence. 
(8) Gender-based violence has always been 
a significant problem in Afghanistan and is 
expected to become more widespread with 
the Taliban in control. 
(9) Prior to the Taliban takeover in August 
2021, approximately 7,000,000 people in Af-
ghanistan lacked or had limited access to 
life-saving health services as a result of in-
adequate 
public 
health 
coverage, 
weak 
health systems, and conflict-related inter-
ruptions in care. 
(10) Women and girls faced additional chal-
lenges, as their access to prenatal, child-
birth, and postpartum care was limited due 
to a shortage of female medical staff, cul-
tural barriers, stigma and fears of reprisals 
following sexual violence, or other barriers 
to mobility, including security fears. 
(11) Only approximately 50 percent of preg-
nant women and girls in Afghanistan deliver 
their children in a health facility with a pro-
fessional attendant, which increases the risk 
of complications in childbirth and prevent-
able maternal mortality. 
(12) Food insecurity in Afghanistan is also 
posing a variety of threats to women and 
girls, as malnutrition weakens their immune 
systems and makes them more susceptible to 
infections, complications during pregnancy, 
and risks during childbirth. 
(13) With the combined impacts of ongoing 
conflict, drought, and COVID–19, Afghan 
households increasingly resort to child mar-
riage, forced marriage, and child labor to ad-
dress food insecurity and other effects of ex-
treme poverty. 
(14) In Afghanistan, the high prevalence of 
anemia among adolescent girls reduces their 
ability to survive childbirth, especially when 
coupled with high rates of child marriage 
and forced marriage and barriers to access-
ing prenatal and childbirth services. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) since 2001, organizations and networks 
promoting the empowerment of women and 
girls have been important engines of social, 
economic, and political development in Af-
ghanistan; 
(2) any future political order in Afghani-
stan should secure the political, economic, 
and social gains made by Afghan women and 
work to increase the equal treatment of 
women and girls in society; 
(3) respecting the internationally recog-
nized human rights of all people is essential 
to securing lasting peace and sustainable de-
velopment in Afghanistan; 
(4) in cooperation with international part-
ners, the United States must endeavor to

preserve the hard-won gains made in Afghan-
istan during the past two decades, particu-
larly as related to the social, economic, and 
political empowerment of women and girls in 
society; 
(5) the continued provision of humani-
tarian assistance in Afghanistan should be 
targeted toward the most vulnerable, includ-
ing for the protection, education, and well- 
being of women and girls; 
(6) immediate and ongoing humanitarian 
needs in Afghanistan can only be met by a 
humanitarian response that includes formal 
agreements between local nongovernmental 
organizations, including women-led organi-
zations, and international partners that pro-
motes the safe access and participation of fe-
male staff at all levels and across functional 
roles among all humanitarian actors; and 
(7) a lack of aid would exacerbate the cur-
rent humanitarian crisis and harm the well- 
being of women and girls in Afghanistan.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL 
JOSEPH CAVALLERO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Michael Cavallero. Michael 
passed away to be with the Lord on Novem-
ber 2, 2021. He was a protector, family man, 
and helped so many in the community. 
Michael was an officer for the Fresno Police 
Department (FPD) for 32 years. He has 
served on the Fresno Police Credit Union 
Board of Directors. Michael wanted what was 
best for his officers and worked hard to do 
what was best for them, even after his retire-
ment. Michael has helped with the Peace Offi-
cers 
Research 
Association 
of 
California 
(PORAC) for region II, and Fresno Police Offi-
cers Association (FPOA). Always involved, Mi-
chael always wanted to be helpful the best 
way possible. 
During his spare time, Michael enjoyed 
watching football; specifically his favorite team 
the San Francisco 49ers. For baseball, he en-
joyed the San Francisco Giants and the Fres-
no Grizzlies. He loved being with his wife, 
Marsha, his siblings, and his two rescued cats 
from the Cat House, Max and Ruby. 
Michael is survived by his loving wife, Mar-
sha; siblings Libby, Steve, Jim, Joan, and Tim; 
and many nieces and nephews. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Michael Joseph 
Cavallero. His service and contributions to the 
State of California and the San Joaquin Valley 
will always be celebrated.

HONORING DEACONESS EASTER 
MAE GREEN 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Deaconess 
Easter Mae Green and her decades of service 
in our Bay Area community. 
Deaconess Green was born in Waterproof, 
Louisiana on October 17, 1926. She was one 
of many African Americans to migrate West 
from the Jim Crow South, hoping to find a bet-
ter life for her family. She arrived in the Bay 
Area in 1952 and began working in Oakland’s 
manufacturing industry, eventually gaining the 
ability to move her brothers and her mother to 
California. 
Deaconess Green understood the impor-
tance of establishing financial stability as a 
single mother, and thus became an entre-
preneur in the Oakland community. She 
opened Easter’s Beauty Salon in East Oak-
land, which operated for more than 30 years. 
The salon provided many services to the com-
munity and became a strong pathway of entre-
preneurship for other female cosmetologists in 
the Oakland area. 
Deaconess Green’s good works in the com-
munity were truly remarkable. In addition to 
raising four biological children, she provided a 
safe and secure home to more than 158 foster 
children. She became a mentor for other 
young and single mothers and helped raise 
scholarship funds for students. Her service 
was recognized by Alameda County, and she 
would later publish her reflections in ‘‘The 
Value of Motherhood’’ in the Woman of Color 
Study Bible in 1999. 
Deaconess Green was strongly devoted to 
faith as a 38-year member of the Allen Temple 
Baptist Church, where her daughter, Rev. Dr. 
Jacqueline A. Thompson, now serves as sen-
ior pastor. She later became a Deaconess to 
provide physical and spiritual support to any-
one in need. 
She lived her life as a reflection of her val-
ues—equal opportunity for women, care for 
children, and protection of the most vulnerable 
around us. She will be missed. 
My deepest condolences and prayers go to 
her family friends and loved ones, and my 
great respect and sympathies go to my dear 
friend and pastor, Reverend Thompson, who 
was a supportive and loving caregiver of her 
mother until the very end. 
Today, on behalf of California’s 13th Con-
gressional District, I commend Deaconess 
Green for her lifelong work as an entre-
preneur, a mentor, and spiritual leader. As she 
returns to her maker, may this beautiful 
woman of God, Deaconess Easter Mae 
Green, rest in peace and power.

DOMINIC C. JONES 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting 
Dominic Jones with his Eagle Scout Court of 
Honor. Dominic joined the cub scouts Pack 10 
at South Vineland Methodist Church at the 
age of 6. In the Pack 10, he earned the cub 
scouts highest honor, the Arrow of Light. 
Dominic, with his friend Tyler, then became 
the founding member of Troop 2. He served 
as Quartermaster for Troop 2 for three years 
and became a Vigil member of the Order of 
the Arrow. In October of 2019, Dominic 
earned scouting’s highest rank, the Eagle 
Scout. For his Eagle project, he built raised 
garden beds for the residents of Baker Place 
Senior living. Dominic obtained all the mate-
rials for the garden beds through donations 
and worked with volunteers to construct the 
beds. This young man should be very proud of 
his accomplishments. It was my honor to have 
had the opportunity to recognize him for his 
service to the South Jersey community. God 
Bless Dominic and God Bless America. 
IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
ROSALIND 
JACKSON AND HER SERVICE TO 
THE 
HOUSE 
JUDICIARY 
COM-
MITTEE 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise— 
along with HANK JOHNSON, Chair of the Sub-
committee on Courts, Intellectual Property, 
and the Internet—to thank Rosalind Jackson 
for her decades of service to the Committee 
on the Judiciary. The House of Representa-
tives has been fortunate to benefit from Rosa-
lind’s service during two separate stints. 
When the public watches a congressional 
hearing or markup, they often do not know all 
of the work that goes into making those 
events come to fruition. For our Committee, 
we have been fortunate to have Rosalind 
working behind the scenes to ensure they go 
smoothly. From sending out notices and wit-
ness invites to compiling witness bios, working 
the timer, and getting committee reports and 
transcripts printed, Rosalind has played a key 
role from start to finish on more than a hun-
dred hearings and markups during her time 
here. She has also performed an invaluable 
service in helping the Committee to save and 
archive its records each Congress. 
While Rosalind has supported numerous 
Subcommittees, as well as the full Committee, 
over the years, she has worked especially 
closely with the Subcommittee on Courts, In-
tellectual Property, and the Internet. In this 
role, she played a critical role in supporting 
the Subcommittee staff as they worked on 
complex legislation, such as, among other 
things, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 
the PRO–IP Act, the Innovation Act and the 
America Invents Act—indeed every major 
copyright and patent law enacted over the last 
15 years and earlier. Her active involvement 
has continued through the Committee’s con-
sideration several months ago of the SHOP 
SAFE Act as well. 
Rosalind’s dedication to public service, insti-
tutional memory, and work ethic have been a 
tremendous gift to the Committee over the 
years. Her warmth and kindness have not only 
served her well in developing good relation-
ships across the Capitol but have created a 
welcoming environment for every staff mem-
ber, Member of Congress, witness, intern, and 
visitor who has had the benefit of interacting 
with her. 
Rosalind is a team player who is always 
willing to help out however is needed. We will 
miss her deeply on the Committee, but we are 
excited for her as she enjoys retirement after 
a career in public service. Our country is fortu-
nate to have had Rosalind working in Con-
gress these past decades. 
We thank Rosalind for her service to the 
Committee and wish her the best of luck with 
this new chapter.

HONORING THE LIFE OF PETER 
ARAM KEZIRIAN 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
celebrate Mr. Peter Aram Kezirian, who 
passed away at the age of 67. Although he 
will be remembered for his service in the mili-
tary and his contributions to the community of 
Fresno, California, he will mostly be remem-
bered for his devotion to his family and 
friends, who he was always there for, when-
ever they needed him. 
Peter graduated from Central High School 
and earned a bachelor’s degree from Cali-
fornia State University, Fresno. He was a hard 
worker and spent his entire life working for the 
Kezirian family businesses. First, he worked at 
Rolinda Farmers Store until 1997, when the 
store closed; and then he worked at managing 
the family farm, 
Peter dedicated 30 years of his life serving 
with the 144th Fighter Wing of the California 
Air National Guard. Achieving the rank of Mas-
ter Sergeant, he retired with an honorable dis-
charge in 2003. When he was not serving in 
the military, he continued his work with the 
family businesses, and loved watching his fa-
vorite sports teams play. He loved the San 
Francisco Giants and was a true fan of the 
Chicago Bears. When it came to NASCAR, he 
was a grand prix enthusiast. 
Peter is survived by his mother Alice 
Kezirian; brothers Vaughn Kezirian (Ann) and 
Robert Kezirian, sisters Terry Kezirian, Paula 
Cunningham (Brian), and Janice Kezirian (Dal-
ton Bennett). He leaves behind his many 
nieces and nephews, family members and 
dear friends. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and achievements of 
my friend, Peter Aram Kezirian. He was a re-
spected member in the community, a loving 
son and brother and a veteran, who had a 
passion for life and the people of the Central 
Valley.

CELEBRATING 
THE 
EAST 
BAY 
AREA 
SECTION 
OF 
THE 
NA-
TIONAL 
COUNCIL 
OF 
NEGRO 
WOMEN 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate the 70th anniversary of 
the East Bay Area Section of the National 
Council of Negro Women. The National Coun-
cil of Negro Women is a non-profit organiza-
tion with the mission to ‘‘lead, advocate for, 
and empower women of African descent, their 
families and communities.’’ NCNW was found-
ed in 1935 by the influential educator and ac-
tivist Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune and the iconic 
Dr. Dorothy Height served as president of the 
organization for more than fifty years. For sev-
enty years, the East Bay Section of NCNW 
has followed in the footsteps of the organiza-
tion’s founder and its longtime president by 
serving as a pillar of the Bay Area community. 
The strength of the East Bay Section lies in 
its exceptional members. Led by President 
Carlene Gray, the members of this Section are 
leaders in their industries and in their commu-
nity. Some are students, others are educators, 
business owners, healthcare professionals, 
civil servants, and others have retired. What 
they all have in common is their commitment 
to improving their community and empowering 
its people. They believe they are their sister’s 
keeper. They encourage African American 
women and their families to serve as ambas-
sadors in the community and contribute to its 
success. 
The East Bay Section continues to strength-
en the community through innovative social, 
civic, and economic programs. These pro-
grams have supported so many members of 
the community including women, children, 
seniors, and veterans. They have also pro-
vided donations to the Alameda County Food 
Bank, donated hygiene supplies to women in 
need, purchased school supplies and hosted 
public forums on education. They have led in-
novative programs to support survivors of sex-
ual assault, domestic abuse, and sex traf-
ficking. During the pandemic, they have do-
nated to community shelters and ensured that 
the community stayed informed with up-to- 
date resources. 
For seventy years, the East Bay Section of 
the National Council of Negro Women has 
been dedicated to serving and uplifting the 
Bay Area. Its members serve as passionate 
community advocates and share a commit-
ment to improving the lives of African Amer-
ican women, their families, and the commu-
nity. In the face of great challenges, the 
women of the East Bay Section of the Na-
tional Council of Negro Women continue to 
rise to the occasion and improve countless 
lives through their tireless work. Their leader-
ship and vision is needed now more than 
ever. May the East Bay Section’s impact con-
tinue to be felt across the community for many 
years to come. Congratulations on seventy 
years of impact and service.

JON PAWLOW RETIREMENT 
TRIBUTE 
HON. SAM GRAVES 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Madam Speaker, 
I want to pay tribute to Jonathan R. ‘‘Jon’’ 
Pawlow, our longtime Water Resources and 
Environment Subcommittee Senior Counsel. 
After 20 years of service on the Committee, 
Jon will be retiring at the end of this year. It’s 
difficult to picture the Transportation and Infra-
structure Committee without Jon here. In fact, 
it’s difficult to imagine the water policy sphere 
throughout the entire Congress without Jon 
here. For 20 years, Jon has been an absolute 
go-to for all things Clean Water Act. He has 
been an immense resource for not just the 
Committee, but for the entire Congress. He 
has left his mark upon the work product cre-
ated under a legion of full and subcommittee 
chairmen and ranking members. However, 
even prior to joining the Committee, Jon was 
accomplished. He graduated Rutgers Univer-
sity with both a bachelor’s and master’s de-
grees in water resources engineering and en-
vironmental science, and also holds a law de-
gree from Georgetown University. He accumu-
lated over 15 years of private law practice, 
gaining expertise in the environmental and in-
tellectual property fields. After that, Jon served 
in the Office of Water at the Environmental 
Protection Agency for nine years and then 
moved on to the Small Business Administra-
tion’s Office of Advocacy. These experiences 
allowed him to bring a host of policy and regu-
latory experience to the Committee. Jon has 
left his fingerprints on just about every piece 
of water legislation in the past two decades. 
He has also been a key participant in five 
Water Resources Development Acts, including 
the last four, where Congress got its act to-
gether and began passing bipartisan WRDAs 
consistently every two years. Finally, through-
out his professional life, Jon has been a 
teacher and a mentor. At various times in his 
career, he has instructed at institutions such 
as the George Washington University Center 
for Career Education and the Old Dominion 
University College of Engineering and Tech-
nology. This has carried over to his time on 
the Hill. He has always made time for anyone 
he meets to walk through the ins-and-outs of 
water policy, from Full Committee Chairs, to 
leadership staff, to personal office legislative 
assistants. Jon is a dedicated professional and 
devoted staffer, and we will all greatly miss his 
knowledge, expertise, and guidance. I am per-
sonally grateful for his service to this Com-
mittee and to Congress. I thank him so much 
for dedicating his career to water policy and 
service to the American public. I hope he and 
Terry make the most of their well-deserved re-
tirements. I thank him for all he has done.

NAFTA DEVASTATION 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, today Presi-
dent Biden hosted Canadian Prime Minister 
Trudeau 
and 
Mexican 
President 
Lopez 
Obrador for the North American Leaders’ 
Summit. 
I urge them to address the continental chal-
lenges unleashed by NAFTA job losses in the 
U.S. and the rising illicit drug trade. 
An often overlooked impact of NAFTA trade 
is the evisceration of Mexico’s white corn mar-
ket. 
As Mexican farmers lost their livelihoods, 
many turned to planting poppy crops for in-
come, which is now blended with Chinese 
fentanyl. 
We know too NAFTA devastated our Indus-
trial Heartland leading to massive job loss and 
a continuing surge of narcotics into the U.S.— 
killing nearly a million people. 
I urge the President and continental leaders 
to not ignore the harms of NAFTA on Amer-
ican workers, Mexican farmers, and commu-
nities ravaged by job losses and the opioid 
epidemic. 
Let us chart a new path forward for conti-
nental trade—but not based on penny wage 
labor. The Americas need fair trade.

WOMEN’S COMMUNITY CLUB OF 
CAPE MAY 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the Women’s Community 
Club of Cape May as they celebrate 100 years 
of volunteer and philanthropic service. The 
Club was officially formed in November of 
1921 with 169 members who elected officers 
and became affiliated with the New Jersey 
State Federation of Women’s Clubs. These 
founders were women who advocated for 
women’s suffrage. Over the past 100 years, 
the WCCM has enabled major projects like the 
Cape May Lewes Ferry, establishing a local 
hospital, and adding American G.I’s and war 
victims during World War II. This Club truly 
has an incredible 100–year history of commu-
nity activism, projects, good works, fun, and 
fellowship. I thank them for their work and 
dedication to our Cape May community, and 
congratulations on their 100–year milestone. 
God Bless the Women’s Community Club of 
Cape May, and God Bless America.

KMPH first took the air in 1971 and oper-
ated as an independent station. It was found-
ed by the Pappas brothers, Mike, Pete, and 
Harry, whose initials make up the name of the 
station. Seven years later, it completely 
launched its news department and began air-
ing The 10 O’clock News from Monday 
through Friday. It covered news from the Fres-
no and Visalia areas, as well as national sto-
ries. 
Since then, the station has expanded to 
most weekdays and for Saturdays, including 
Great Day which airs on multiple mornings a 
week. Through these programs, KMPH has 
served as a vital source of information for 
viewers all across the Central Valley of Cali-
fornia. 
Even while news organizations across the 
United States have undergone serious chal-
lenges to their livelihoods, KMPH Television 
has remained a staple of Central Valley jour-
nalism. During this age of misinformation, 
KMPH has remained committed to ensuring 
the integrity of local news, something I and my 
constituents are very grateful for. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring KMPH Television on their 50th 
anniversary.

RECOGNIZING THE 35TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NEBRASKA URBAN 
INDIAN HEALTH COALITION 
HON. DON BACON 
OF NEBRASKA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of National Native American 
Heritage Month and to honor the 35th anniver-
sary of the Nebraska Urban Indian Health Co-
alition, a private nonprofit organization in Ne-
braska. 
The Nebraska Urban Indian Health Coalition 
provides community healthcare and services 
targeting the urban American Indian and Alas-
ka Native population in the greater Omaha 
metropolitan area, Lincoln area, and Sioux 
City, Iowa, since 1986. Their rehabilitative 
healthcare services and their diabetes self- 
management program are nationally recog-
nized. Currently, they are led by their CEO, 
Dr. Donna Mays Polk. 
Donna Lee Mays was born in 1943 in Den-
ver, CO, to a young WWII submariner Hosey 
Mays and his wife Tommy Lee Gadling Mays. 
Dr. Polk was only 7 years old when her moth-
er was killed in a car accident by a drunk driv-
er on Christmas Day. Dr. Polk credits her 
grandmother, Annie Lee Gadling, as her inspi-
ration because of her spirituality and Wisdom. 
Dr. Polk firmly believes in having vision and 
that you have to be able to see how things 
can be. If you don’t, Mr. Speaker, you don’t 
work to effect change. 
Between 1972 to 1985, Dr. Polk served as 
an affirmative action and equal opportunity of-
ficer at the Nebraska Department of Labor. 
She volunteered in the Nebraska Correction’s 
system for 26 years and starred in her own TV 
show called ‘‘Frankly Female, a show for and 
about women. She is the mother of four sons, 
Mark, Imani, Marcus, and the Honorable 
Judge Marlon Polk. 
Dr. Polk earned her bachelor’s degree in 
university studies, her master’s in counseling 
psychology, and a doctorate in administration, 
instruction, and curriculum, all from the Univer-
sity of Nebraska–Lincoln. In addition, she is a 
published author. She wrote her book, ‘‘Black 
Men and Women of Nebraska, in 1981 to 
shine the light on prominent African-American 
individuals in our State. 
She joined the NE Urban Indian Health Co-
alition in 1991 after leaving the Lincoln Indian 
Center. She continues to lead a team of over 
50 employees. Programs and services include: 
Behavioral Health Substance Use Disorder 
Services, 
transitional 
housing, 
Nebraska 
Urban Indian Medical Center in Lincoln, and 
transportation. Dr. Polk also takes immense 
pride in the Eagle Heights Affordable Housing 
located in South Omaha and two community- 
based programs—Project Upstream serving 
families 
with 
children 
in 
Omaha 
Public 
Schools, and the Tired Moccasins a nutrition- 
based program for elders. Dr. Polk is thrilled 
about the inauguration of their new head-
quarters scheduled to open in the spring of 
2022. 
In recognition of the Nebraska Urban Indian 
Health Coalition, we shine a spotlight on 35 
years of helping elevate the health status and 
eliminating disparities of urban Indians and 
other underserved populations in Nebraska 
and Iowa through education, collaboration, ad-
vocacy, and health service delivery. 
Congratulations to Dr. Polk and her team for 
35 years of excellence and serving our great 
community.

HONORING SONIA PARRAS 
KONRAD AS IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
ask the House of Representatives to join me 
in recognizing Sonia Parras Konrad, an attor-
ney, visionary, and co-founder of various non- 
profits, as Iowan of the Week. 
For someone who never intended to be-
come a lawyer and advocate, Sonia Parras 
Konrad exceeded her personal expectations 
and became an influential member of the 
Latina community in Iowa. While attending col-
lege in Spain, Sonia had the chance to study 
at Central College for a year in 1993 through 
1994. After her first year in Iowa, Sonia firmly 
believed that Iowa chose her and felt as 
though many factors kept her coming back. As 
soon as she started to work with the Latina 
community, she saw the immense need for 
advocacy in support of its members. Further-
more, she feels honored to be a part of the 
road to change in Iowa and more specifically, 
her ability to work to change policies that af-
fect a vulnerable population. Within Iowa, she 
found a lot of mainstream support and allies, 
which pushed her to continue her work. 
As Sonia’s passion for activism progressed, 
she went on to become a co-founder of mul-
tiple non-profits such as Latinas Unidas por un 
Nuevo Amanecer (LUNA), MUNA Legal Clinic, 
Latina Leadership of Greater Des Moines 
(LLI), and the ALMAS Pro Bono Legal Clinic. 
In addition to her work in the non-profit sector, 
Sonia is well-versed in international consulting 
throughout Latin America in which she serves 
as a consultant to both the Department of 
State and the Mexican Government. As a re-
sult of all of her extraordinary work, Sonia has 
received many prestigious awards and honors 
from various organizations. In 2021 only, 
Sonia has received both the Pro Bono Award 
from the Iowa-Nebraska Chapter of American 
Immigration Lawyers and the Businesswoman 
of the Year 2021 from the Business Record. In 
all, Sonia’s goals are to always do more, con-
tinue to grow, and open roads for women and 
immigrants in Iowa. 
Sonia has dedicated her life to helping the 
Latina community in Iowa through her leader-
ship and legal prowess. Her optimistic and 
humble mindset has propelled her to success 
and makes her truly worthy of being nomi-
nated for this award. Sonia serves as an inspi-
ration and role model to all, and it is my honor 
to name her Iowan of the Week.

RICHARD K. FOSTER 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to recognize and honor the life of Richard 
Foster of Nutley, New Jersey. Richard grad-
uated from the University of Pennsylvania in 
1954 and joined the Air Force reserves shortly 
after. After his time in the Air Force, he 
worked for Prudential Insurance company for 
almost 40 years until his retirement. In 1994, 
when in Ocean City, New Jersey, with his 
wife, Richard encountered a violent, horrific 
storm. The riptides and winds were unlike any-
thing the city had ever seen. While near the 
beach, Richard noticed two women struggling 
to return to shore because of the storm. With-
out hesitation, Richard entered the water to 
help save them. Unfortunately, because of the 
severity of the storm and tides, Richard nearly 
drowned and suffered from cardiac arrest 
while trying to save the women, but never re-
gained consciousness. Richard truly is a self-
less hero. May he rest in peace. God Bless 
Richard and God Bless America.

Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

San Joaquin Valley by expanding economic

keting intelligence, economic trends and net-
working opportunities. 
In 2018, EDC received the International 
Economic Development Council Gold Award 
for the New Employment Opportunities Ex-
panded Subsidized Employment Program. 
This innovative program matches the needs of 
industries with individuals seeking jobs. EDC 
uses their website, social media outlets, and 
community outreach to provide their clients, in-
vestors, and community members with impor-
tant news, resources, and information. They

munity and it enhances relationships with busi-
nesses. Continuously, they have promoted 
business investment and job creation by in-
forming economic development policy, pro-
grams, and legislation to the cities and compa-
nies it serves. 
With the support of its Board of Directors 
and network of over a hundred investors, they 
use their creative license to bring about inno-
vative ideas and collaborative opportunities to 
put forth Fresno County’s economic evolution 
and growth. Their steady leadership has 
played a vital role in solidifying the economic 
strength of Fresno County and the future 
needs of the community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Fresno County Economic Cor-
poration for their commitment to improving the 
quality of life in the local community. It is both 
fitting and appropriate that we honor them on 
the celebration of their fortieth anniversary. I 
wish them all the best and continued success 
in the future.

HONORING THOMAS HOBART 
KELLER 
HON. CHELLIE PINGREE 
OF MAINE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. PINGREE. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize and remember Army vet-
eran, retired police lieutenant, and social jus-
tice advocate, Thomas Hobart Keller. He lived 
a life of service with a commitment to advo-
cacy, and his indefatigable focus on fairness, 
kindness, and equality improved the lives of 
so many of my constituents. 
Tom loved the ocean, residing at various 
times in Maine, Nova Scotia, and the Florida 
Keys. He was a foodie and a cook. He was 
fiercely devoted to his family and close 
friends. He was a Veteran for Peace. He em-
braced recovery to craft a life he described as 
‘‘second to none.’’ And he was a pioneering 
law enforcement leader in Maine’s movement 
to end violence against women. Tom both 
challenged and changed policing practices to 
better protect and support survivors. In his 
profession and as a volunteer and board 
member at the local women’s shelter, he was 
compassionate, knowledgeable, and influen-
tial. 
Tom knew that one’s judgement did not de-
fine others so much as it defined oneself. To 
that end, he was accepting and open hearted. 
He faced death as he had lived—with dignity, 
grace, and good humor. 
Tom Keller served his country and his com-
munity. He changed lives, and I am grateful 
for the legacy he left in my state and beyond.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF MAJOR GENERAL JAY 
LINDELL 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I, along with 
Representative PERLMUTTER, Representative 
DEGETTE, 
Representative 
LAMBORN, 
Rep-
resentative NEGUSE, Senator HICKENLOOPER, 
and Senator BENNET rise today to recognize 
the service and accomplishments of Major 
General Jay Lindell and congratulate him on 
his upcoming retirement. 
A graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy 
and Veteran of Operation Desert Storm, Major 
General Lindell served our nation as a fighter 
pilot and as Commander of the 35th Fighter 
Squadron at Kunsan Air Base in South Korea 
and the 27th Operations Group at Cannon Air 
Force Base in New Mexico. 
In his highly decorated career, Major Gen-
eral Lindell logged more than 4,000 flying 
hours and was a recipient of the Silver Star— 
the third-highest military decoration for valor in 
combat. After leaving his combat role, he went 
on to serve as a Colonel, a Brigadier General, 
and was eventually promoted to Major Gen-
eral to serve as the Director of Global Power 
Programs in the Office of the Assistant Sec-
retary of the Air Force for Acquisition. 
After over 33 years of valiant service to our 
country, Major General Lindell left the Air 
Force and was appointed by the Colorado Of-
fice of Economic Development and Inter-
national Trade as Colorado’s Aerospace & De-
fense Industry Champion. Due in no small part 
to Major General Lindell’s dynamic and inspi-
rational leadership, Colorado soon ranked No. 
1 in the nation in aerospace employment per 
capita. During his tenure, Colorado became 
the proud home of the United States Space 
Command Headquarters at Peterson Space 
Force Base and saw two bases redesignated: 
Buckley Space Force Base in Aurora and 
Schriever Space Force Base in Colorado 
Springs. 
Beyond Major General Lindell’s dedication 
to the aerospace and defense industry, he has 
given back to our community and made it his 
mission to advocate on behalf of active duty 
veterans and their families. Major General 
Lindell has served on several boards com-
mitted to strengthening our community through 
providing youth space education programs, 
creating economic opportunities for veterans, 
and ensuring we fulfil our sacred promise to 
care for veterans and their families when they 
return from duty. 
Major General Lindell’s contributions to our 
country and the community epitomize what it 
means to go above and beyond the call of 
duty. We congratulate Major General Lindell 
on his retirement and thank him for his service 
to our community and nation.

HONORING THE CENTENNIAL AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE FIG GARDEN 
WOMAN’S CLUB 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Fig Garden Woman’s Club on the 
occasion of its centennial anniversary. Found-
ed on March 9, 1921, the Fig Garden Wom-
en’s Club is celebrating 100 years of friend-
ship and contributions to our local community. 
The Fig Garden Woman’s Club was found-
ed in 1921, by, 13 young women who lived in 
the Fig Garden neighborhood in Fresno, Cali-
fornia. The club was founded based on the 
shared values of friendship and finding ways 
to help improve their community. As interest, 
membership and work in the neighborhood 
grew, the club members began an effort to 
raise funds to build a clubhouse for their mem-
bers to use and the community to enjoy. In 
1926, the clubhouse was built with the help of 
friends and local developer J.C. Forkner and 
was established as a California Historical 
Landmark in 1987. The club is recognized 
under the California Federation of Woman’s 
Clubs and the General Federation of Women’s 
Clubs. Today, the club continues to thrive and 
has over 180 dedicated members. 
Since 1921, the Fig Garden Woman’s Club 
has made contributions to local non-profits for 
victims of domestic violence, provided food for 
hard-working college students, and actively 
participates in many other local efforts. They 
also fundraise to provide scholarships for 
nursing students from Fresno City College, 
among other philanthropic efforts. Past efforts 
have included, providing transportation and 
meals to school children, donations to local 
nonprofit organizations, Christmas donations 
for needy families and neighborhood beautifi-
cation projects. 
The Fig Garden Woman’s Club members 
regularly sacrifice their time to help the Old 
Fig Garden neighborhood, in addition to their 
work within the City and County of Fresno. 
Annually, they donate their time to provide life-
long memories for Central Valley families by 
contributing to the beloved local tradition, 
Christmas Tree Lane. Members bake over 
1,000 cookies to promote donations for Christ-
mas Tree Lane, the two mile stretch of beau-
tifully decorated homes in Old Fig Garden. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the Fig Garden Woman’s Club 
on their centennial anniversary. It is my honor 
to congratulate past and present members on 
this momentous accomplishment and thank 
them for the joy they have brought to the com-
munity.

HONORING THE MILITARY

Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor U.S. Navy Motor Machinist Second 
Class (MM2C) Cedric Stout of Bridge City, 
Texas. Mr. Stout enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 
1941 and was aboard the USS Utah anchored

Stout and spent his childhood in Leonville, 
Louisiana. Growing up, he labored with his six 
brothers and seven sisters as sharecroppers 
working the fields by hand to make ends meet 
for their family. Like many others in rural Lou-
isiana during the Great Depression, the Stout 
home was without electricity or indoor plumb-
ing. At the age of 17, Mr. Stout joined the Ci-
vilian Conservation Corps (CCC) where he 
helped build national parks in Oregon. 
After returning to Louisiana, he enlisted in 
the U.S. Navy on March 23, 1941. Following 
boot camp in San Diego, he was stationed in 
Hawaii at Pearl Harbor aboard the USS Utah. 
On the morning of December 7, Mr. Stout was 
awakened by the sound of Japanese aircraft 
attacking our Pacific Fleet. With the ongoing 
bombardment happening around him, he knew 
his chances of survival were slim. Yet, by the 
grace of God, he managed to get to safety. 
Tragically, the USS Utah, and many on board, 
were not so lucky. The battleship’s substantial 
damage made it capsize and sink in a mere 
seven minutes. 
Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. 
Stout was reassigned to a light cruiser, the 
USS Detroit (CL–8). Later, while participating 
in the invasion of Saipan, his landing craft 
sank, leaving him and the other surviving crew 
members to be rescued. For his military serv-
ice, Mr. Stout received the following com-
mendations: the Navy Expeditionary Medal, 
American Campaign Medal, American Service 
Medal, Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal, and 
World War II Victory Medal. 
While on leave in 1944, Mr. Stout married 
Delma Courville of Sunset, Louisiana. The 
couple had nine children together. Their 
names are Shirley Harmes, Julie Pike, Gerald 
Stout, Darlene Montagne, Janet Johnston, 
Janine Carter, Denise Evavold (passed away 
in 1997), Daniel Stout, and Theresa Hock. Mr. 
Stout and his wife also had 20 grandchildren 
and 17 great-grandchildren. After his service 
in World War II, Mr. Stout moved his family to 
Bridge City, Texas, in 1959 and began driving 
a city bus in Port Arthur, Texas, for two years 
before becoming a salesman for the Price 
Cigar and Candy Company. He retired in 
1988. 
Sadly, Delma passed away in 1999. He 
married his second wife, Cherry Tiller, in 2000. 
Together, they remain committed to their large 
family, including the Stout and Tiller children, 
grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. Mr. 
Stout and Cherry enjoy attending mass to-
gether, sharing household chores, and gar-
dening. In fact, this impressive centenarian 
can still be spotted mowing the yard on his 
John Deere tractor. 
Madam Speaker, I salute this American 
hero for his valiant service in the U.S. Navy 
during World War II and in recognition of a for-
titude few share, but all are grateful for. I con-
gratulate this newly-minted centenarian on a 
life well-lived. May God continue to bless him 
for his service to his country, community, and 
family.

SALUTING 
THE 
ACHIEVEMENTS 
AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF JAVIER 
HERNA´ NDEZ BALCA´ ZAR 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to salute Javier Herna´ndez Balca´zar for 
his many positive contributions to Los Ange-
les, both as a prominent soccer player and as 
an active member of our Los Angeles commu-
nity. 
Javier was born on June 1, 1988, in Guada-
lajara, Jalisco, Mexico, to Silvia Balca´zar and 
Javier Gutie´rrez. He began playing soccer at 
the junior club level when he was 7 years old. 
After signing his first professional contract with 
a local club at the age of 15, he was selected 
for the Mexico national under-17 team. In July 
2010, he was acquired by the Premier League 
club Manchester United and became the first- 
ever Mexican player to be selected for one of 
the leading Premier League teams. 
Javier’s extraordinary soccer career and his 
hard work to reach his goals are an inspiration 
to young people around the world. As a new 
member of the Los Angeles Galaxy, he has 
become an incredible role model throughout 
Southern California. 
Javier joined the Galaxy as the team’s Des-
ignated Player on January 21, 2020. Since 
joining the team, Javier’s passion for giving 
back has inspired his many philanthropic ef-
forts in the Los Angeles community. 
On December 5, 2021, Javier will once 
again support his community by appearing for 
fans in Bell Gardens, California, in my 40th 
Congressional District. The event will be one 
of the largest toy giveaways in the history of 
Southern California and will be hosted by DEL

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOHNNY 
DENIZ 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Johnny Deniz. Johnny passed 
away on September 24, 2021. He was 90 
years old. He served in the U.S. Army during 
the Korean war, and after returning home, 
dedicated his life as a farmer in the Counties 
of Madera and Fresno. 
Johnny was born on July 24, 1931 to 
Manuel and Rosa Deniz. He was raised in 
Madera, California. 
Growing up, he went to Dixieland Grammar 
School and Madera High School. During 
school, he was elected President of the 
Madera F.F.A. Later, he served the Madera 
F.F.A. as Secretary of State and was awarded 
the American F.F.A. Degree. Johnny attended 
Fresno State University for a degree in engi-
neering, but was soon drafted into the Army 
and served as Military Police Officer in Eu-
rope. 
After serving in the military, Johnny returned 
back home and he married his first wife, 
Wilma. He became a dedicated farmer in the 
Counties of Madera and Fresno, in which he 
grew multiple crops such as tomatoes, cotton, 
stone fruit, and table and wine grapes. Johnny 
was a successful businessman and estab-
lished the Madera Pump Company, Almond 
Tree Hauler Inc., and Deniz Packing Inc. His 
work for the protection of Madera County’s 
water supply left a legacy in which he dedi-
cated 24 years of service as a Director, and 
15 years as President, of the Madera Irrigation 
District. 
Johnny remarried in 2009 to his wife Dorie 
and continued the dedicated work for his com-
munity. In 2010, he was awarded Senior 
Farmer of the Year in the County of Madera 
for his dedication and hard work with the 
water district and for helping the needs of oth-
ers. As one who was always civically en-
gaged, he belonged to the Knights of Colum-
bus as a 4th degree knight; the Madera Coun-
ty Farm Bureau; the Elks Club; and last but 
not least, the Veterans of Foreign Wars. His 
contributions and efforts on behalf of these or-
ganizations, made a lasting impact on the Val-
ley. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Johnny Deniz. His 
service and contributions to the Central Valley 
and the State of California will be missed. I 
join his family and friends in celebrating John-
ny’s life.

THE STORY OF THE MARBLEHEAD 
LIGHTHOUSE 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the celebration of the 200th anniver-
sary of the Marblehead Lighthouse in Marble-
head, Ohio. On Sunday, November 20, 2021, 
I joined with residents and congregants of 
First United Church of Christ-Congregational 
in Marblehead to kick off the celebration 
through 2022. I am honored to include in the 
RECORD the history as stated during the cele-
bration. The history was written by Lorrie 
Halblaub. 
Welcome. Today we will rededicate the 
Marblehead Lighthouse which was built in 
1821 and commissioned in 1822. It was origi-
nally called the Sandusky Bay Light Station 
but the name changed to Marblehead in 1870. 
Starting today, this peninsula will be hon-
oring the light with a year-long celebration 
featuring many events. There is something 
about a lighthouse that makes us compare it 
to God. Its leading light, its steadfastness, 
its help to those who are in trouble, so a 
church is a fitting place to begin this jour-
ney. 
THE STORY OF THE MARBLEHEAD LIGHTHOUSE IN 
WORDS AND MUSIC 
After the War of 1812, the United States 
turned its attention to shipping on the Great 
Lakes and lighthouses were necessary to aid 
in navigation. In 1819 Congress budgeted 
$5,000 for a light between the Grand River in 
Ohio and the Detroit River in Michigan. An-
other $5000 was budgeted in 1820. 
Because Sandusky Bay was the safest har-
bor in that stretch of Lake Erie, it was de-
cided that a light would be erected at the en-
trance. So, the United States purchased 3 
acres of land for $277.45 on what was known 
then as Rocky Point, a small peninsula on 
the east end of the larger Marblehead penin-
sula. 
Instructions on the size and shape of the 
lighthouse were given to the builder, Wil-
liam Kelly, from Sandusky. His workers 
quarried the native limestone and built the 
50-foot tower that was to become the light. 
They started on September 14 and finished 
on November 10, 1821 at a cost of $7,282. Two 
of Kelly’s grandsons, John Jr. and Joab were 
founders of this church. 
Over the rest of the winter and spring of 
1822, the top of the light tower was fitted 
with the light source; 13 Argand whale oil 
lamps with reflectors and a set of windows, 
called a lantern, that the light shone 
through. 
The lighthouse was the first permanent 
structure built on the peninsula. The second 
structure was a stone keeper’s house next to 
the light. Then William Kelly also built a 
third stone dwelling for the man who would 
become the first keeper of the light, Benajah 
Wolcott, the first permanent settler of Dan-
bury Township. By June 22, 1822, the light 
was officially lit and Wolcott began 10 years 
of service at $350 per year. 
What was it like to be a lightkeeper back 
then? In a word ‘‘difficult’’. First, you had to 
stay up all night long to keep the light 
going. You had to haul heavy containers of 
oil up a series of wooden ladders to fuel the 
flame. The wicks needed trimming, the 
lamps and window glass needed polishing, 
the tower needed maintenance and painting, 
the grounds and the keeper’s house had to be 
cleaned and kept in repair. 
Remember, back then, the Marblehead Pe-
ninsula was a prairie. Settlers lived in log 
cabins with no towns, roads, stores, schools, 
churches or local government Travel on land 
was by horse or on foot so you couldn’t run 
to a store if you needed something. Shopping 
required a rowboat trip across Sandusky Bay 
to the nearest town where you turned in 
your monthly lighthouse reports and picked 
up your pay. 
All the early keepers grew their own food 
and kept livestock. All keepers kept a log 
where they wrote down the weather and 
what ships passed. 
For the first 55 years of the light, the keep-
ers were also required to aid any ship in dis-
tress. If they couldn’t mount a rescue of vol-
unteers, they had to do the rescuing them-
selves. 
There were 15 lightkeepers over the years, 
including two women. After Benajah Wolcott 
died of Cholera, his wife, Rachel, became the 
first female lightkeeper on the Great Lakes. 
Then, in 1875, something happened that 
changed the keeper’s duty of mounting res-
cues. In May of that year, a gale swept over 
the lake. The schooner Consuelo began to 
sink about 3 miles from the Lighthouse. 
Lucien Clemons, whose father started the 
first quarry business on the peninsula, saw 
their plight and along with his brothers Hub-
bard and Ai mounted a rescue. 
They rowed a 12-foot boat for nearly an 
hour in a raging storm, risking their own 
lives. They saved two of the crew, who were 
clinging to the ship. The captain, three sea-
men and a female cook were lost. 
For their heroic effort, the three were 
given the first Congressional gold lifesaving 
medals ever awarded. 
Then, because of the number of shipwrecks 
in the area, the government built a life-
saving station here and it took over the res-
cues from the lightkeepers. 
The Point Marblehead Lifesaving Station 
opened June 24, 1876 with Lucien Clemons as 
the first keeper. He served for 21 years. 
His brothers, Hubbard and Ai were mem-
bers of this church, which was built in 1900. 
The brothers served on the building com-
mittee. Because the lifesaving station was 
small, they made a deal with the church that 
people who were rescued could shelter here if 
needed. The sign of that covenant is on the 
top of our church steeple. Instead of a cross, 
we have a symbolic Astrolabe, a device that 
helped early sailors navigate. 
The Lifesaving station became part of the 
Coast Guard and the station was rebuilt and 
enlarged twice. Today the Marblehead Coast 
Guard station is the one of the busiest on the 
Great Lakes. 
A replica of the first lifesaving station is 
on display on the grounds of our lighthouse. 
Because the Coast Guard was part of the 
Navy during World War II, they have their 
own verse in the next song, also known as 
the Navy Hymn. We will now sing Eternal 
Father Strong to Save with the Coast Guard 
verse. 
As the years went by, the lighthouse 
changed, always for the better, and always 
to make the light beam farther and brighter. 
Around the turn of the 20th century, two 
additions to height, a bigger lantern and a 
bigger lens were added. The light fuel went 
from oil to kerosene to electricity and from 
a lantern with simple reflectors to a mag-
nificent Fresnel lens, to several big LED 
bulbs. 
In 1903 the Light gained a clockwork mech-
anism that only needed to be wound every 
few hours. Today it is automated. The color 
of the light has been white, red and now is 
green so as to distinguish it from other air 
beacons. 
Two 
keepers 
oversaw 
most 
of 
these 
changes. Joanna McGee, our second’ female 
keeper, and Charles Hunter, who were both 
members of this church. The McGee’s came 
to the lighthouse as a newly-weds when 
George was hired as the 12th keeper. They 
gave birth to 10 children while living there. 
Joanna became the keeper after her husband 
George passed away, Together, George and 
Johanna McGee served 30 years. 
By 1881, the keeper’s original stone house 
was in such poor condition that George built 
them a shed to live in. When the light house 
inspector saw that, it wasn’t long before the 
old keepers house was torn down and a new 
two-story wooden home was built that serves 
as the lighthouse museum today. 
Charles Hunter came as a single man but 
married at age 55. He served from 1903–1933, 
and was quite a character. He was a story-
teller, taught a woodworking class at the 
local school. He built a boat that was too 
heavy to float and a house made of wood 
that had washed up on shore. 
Before 1920, he owned a car, a Hupmobile, 
but didn’t drive it. His wife drove while he 
sat in the back smoking his pipe! He also 
created pictures out of crewel embroidery 
like the one on display. And without know-
ing how to play the piano, he wrote a song 
about the lighthouse called The Lighthouse 
by the Bay that will be sung by soloist Bill 
Bird. 
200 years after the lighthouse was built it 
is still beaming light every night. It has the 
honor of being the oldest continuously oper-
ating Lighthouse on the Great Lakes. Four 
other Great Lakes lighthouses were built 
prior to 1821, but all of them have been de-
commissioned. 
Over the years, many old lighthouses have 
been torn down or rebuilt a few times, but 
the original Marblehead Light still stands 
because of several factors; it was built on 
solid bedrock, built of the finest limestone, a 
stone that is nearly waterproof, built by an 
excellent mason who mixed the right mortar 
consistency and let the building cure prop-
erly, and because it has been lovingly main-
tained over the years. It has withstood many 
Nor’Easter storms with waves that splash 
the windows 65 feet up. It has withstood the 
wrath of Lake Erie, known as the toughest, 
meanest and most unpredictable of the Great 
Lakes. 
As playwright George Bernard Shaw wrote: 
‘I can think of no other edifice constructed 
by man as altruistic as a lighthouse. They 
were built to serve. They weren’t built for 
any other purpose.’ We will now sing the 
hymn Brightly Beams our Father’s Mercy.

Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to issue this recognition of ‘‘Timeless Zoro-
astrian Legacy’’ to all Zoroastrians for their ex-
traordinary contributions to history and civiliza-
tion, in pioneering the first universal human

HONORING THE WORK AND 
RETIREMENT OF KEN MALLOY 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the retirement of CBS47 anchor and 
Central Valley news icon, Ken Malloy. Ken 
has served as a journalist, reporter, and an-
chor for nearly 39 years, and he will be dearly 
missed by the Central Valley. 
Ken was born and raised in Los Angeles. 
There, he attended and graduated from the 
prestigious University of Southern California, 
Ken began his career as an anchor and re-
porter at KESQ in Palm Springs, California, 
where he was recognized for his breaking 
news coverage. 
Thereafter, he moved to New Hampshire, 
where he reported at WMUR and hosted an 
award-winning weekly political talk show that 
took home two Golden Mike Awards. Ken con-
tinued his pursuit of groundbreaking news cov-
erage when he ventured to Providence, Rhode 
Island. He served as a co-anchor and reporter 
at WJAR, the number one-rated station in the 
city. 
While there, Ken served on the Board of Di-
rectors for the state’s adoption exchange pro-
gram and produced weekly ‘‘Tuesday’s Child’’ 
segments and half-hour specials on child 
adoption. These efforts served as a true testa-
ment to his purposeful reporting. 
Ken came to Fresno, California, to join 
CBS47 after a stint at KTVT, the CBS Owned 
and Operated station in Dallas, Texas, where 
he anchored and reported for almost 12 years. 
In Fresno, Ken started as the weekend co-an-
chor, before launching the station’s first morn-
ing show and serving as the primary anchor. 
Ken has covered some of the most prolific 
moments in American history. This includes 
his coverage of the Oklahoma City Bombing, 
Timothy McVeigh’s execution, and the capture 
of the ‘‘Texas Seven.’’ He took on the coura-
geous responsibility of covering the 9–11 at-
tacks, along with the 2000 presidential race. 
Ken’s diligence and work ethic was put on full 
display while he stayed on the road for six 
weeks during the Election Cycle. 
Today, we pride Ken for his work as an 
award-winning journalist, anchor, and commu-
nity leader. Since 1984, he has anchored 
more than 30,000 newscasts, written more 
than 10,000 stories, and received countless 
awards and recognitions. His presence, cha-
risma, and consistency will always be missed 
as a part of his greater legacy here in the 
Central Valley. I join his wife Michelle, their 
three wonderful children, and friends in con-
gratulating Ken for all his achievements. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the work and retirement of Ken 
Malloy. His service and contributions to the 
Central Valley will be missed and we wish him 
all the best for the future.

HONORING KIM FORREST 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Kim Forrest to 
commemorate her 45 years of service with the 
United States Fish and Wildlife Service. 
Raised in Seaside on the Monterey Penin-
sula of California, Kim Forrest’s youth was 
marked by adventure, spending her days ex-
ploring the vast biodiversity of the Pacific 
coast. Each summer, Kim and her parents 
would camp in the High Sierra where her ap-
preciation of wildlife grew. Shortly after her 
college graduation from Utah State University, 
Kim’s steadfast admiration of wildlife led her to 
join the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service as an 
entry level employee at Bear River National 
Wildlife Refuge (NWR). Later, Kim became 
acting Manager of Fish Springs NWR. 
After a brief stint at the Charles M. Russell 
NWR in Montana, Kim returned to her home 
state of California where she became the pri-
mary manager of the Merced NWR in the San 
Joaquin Valley. Subsequently, she became 
Deputy Project Leader at the Sacramento 
NWR, supervising a crew of equipment opera-
tors and biologists. Furthermore, Kim became 
project leader at the San Luis NWR complex, 
a wildlife refuge with an area of 40,000 acres, 
establishing herself as a well-respected con-
servationist. 
Kim’s contributions to California wildlife are 
plentiful, including the development and acqui-
sition of riparian zones, the elimination of 
invasive plant species, and the recovery of the 
endangered Riparian Brush Rabbit. Kim’s con-
servation efforts are continued through her 
work to connect wildlife corridors and protect 
the wildlife that remains in California’s Central 
Valley. November 11th marks Kim’s 45th anni-
versary of working for the National Wildlife 
Refuge System. 
Madam Speaker, it is evident that Kim For-
rest has made an everlasting impact on Cali-
fornian wildlife conservation efforts through 
years of dedicated service. Therefore, it is fit-
ting and proper that we honor her here today.

CONGRATULATING 
DETECTIVE 
TIMOTHY METZGER FOR HIS RE-
TIREMENT FROM THE ROCK IS-
LAND POLICE DEPARTMENT 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Detective Timothy Metzger, who 
is retiring from the Rock Island Police Depart-
ment after 28 years of service. His last day 
was Friday, November 12. 
Detective Timothy Metzger joined the Rock 
Island Police Department in December 1992. 
A graduate of Blackhawk College and Western 
Illinois University, Detective Metzger reported 
to duty each day with impeccable work ethic 
and compassion for the neighbors he strived 
to protect. After nearly 20 years, his peers and 
principals rewarded him for his commitment to 
the City of Rock Island by promoting him to 
Detective of the Police Department. For al-
most 10 years, Detective Metzger has handled 
every facet of investigations conducted by the 
Police Department. He specialized in com-
puter, cellphone, and video forensics and 
helped with the Illinois Attorney General Inter-
net Crimes Against Children Task Force at a 
local level. When he was not putting himself in 
harm’s way, he enjoyed giving back to the 
area he served, helping coach youth softball 
and baseball teams in Rock Island. 
It is because of committed and honorable 
leaders such as Detective Metzger that I am 
especially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Con-
gressional District. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to, again, formally congratulate Detective 
Timothy Metzger on his retirement and thank 
him for his 28 years of service to our commu-
nity.

SUPPORTING H.R. 951, THE 
MATERNAL VACCINATION ACT 
HON. TERRI A. SEWELL 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. SEWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in support of H.R. 951, the Maternal Vaccina-
tion Act. The pandemic has laid bare the his-
torical inequities that exist in our health care 
system for Black Americans, especially for 
Black parents. My constituency is painfully 
aware of the pervasive, systemic and institu-
tional influences that have contributed to these 
disparities. 
And let’s be clear, these disparities have 
only been exacerbated by the pandemic, 
which is why me and my colleagues have 
been so adamant in the inclusion of policies to 
end our nation’s maternal mortality crisis and 
eliminate racial and ethnic disparities in mater-
nal health outcomes. 
As we are almost two years into a global 
pandemic that has disproportionately harmed 
communities of color, the risks facing Black 
women and other birthing people of color are 
at a crisis point. Any legislative proposal that 
will successfully and meaningfully address the 
pandemic’s impact on people of color must di-
rectly address the effects of coronavirus dis-
ease of 2019 (COVID–19) on pregnant people 
and new moms. 
As many of us know, the United States has 
the highest maternal mortality rate of any high- 
income country and the only rate that is rising. 
The pregnancy-related mortality rate for Black 
women in the U.S. is three to four times high-
er than the rate for white women, and other 
women and birthing people of color also face 
elevated rates of mortality and morbidity. 
The risks for pregnant people have only 
grown during COVID–19: according to the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
‘‘pregnant and recently pregnant women are at 
an increased risk for severe illness from 
COVID–19 compared to nonpregnant women.’’ 
The CDC also found that pregnant people with 
COVID–19 are at an increased risk for ad-
verse pregnancy outcomes. In addition to clin-
ical risks, the pandemic has affected social 
determinants of health that contribute to ma-
ternal health disparities, like increased food in-
security, 
which 
disproportionately 
impacts 
Black and Hispanic families. 
Without bold and immediate action to ad-
dress the heightened clinical and non-clinical 
threats to pregnant people and their growing 
families, our national recovery from COVID–19 
will only exacerbate the inequities that existed 
before the pandemic and worsened over the 
past year. 
Recognizing the urgent need to address 
these alarming trends, President Biden’s 
American Families Plan includes a much-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks

needed $3 billion investment in maternal 
health. The President’s proposal provides an 
opportunity to make considerable investments 
in federal funding to address this crisis, includ-
ing policies included in the Black Maternal 
Health Momnibus Act of 2021 and a perma-
nent expansion of yearlong postpartum Med-
icaid coverage. By advancing these two prior-
ities in the recent recovery package, we com-
prehensively addressed every driver of our na-
tion’s maternal health crisis. 
The Momnibus includes investments that 
will be needed during and after the COVID–19 
pandemic, including investments in commu-
nity-based organizations, policies to grow and 
diversify the perinatal workforce, expanded ac-
cess to maternal mental health care treat-
ments and support, measures to address the 
impacts of climate change on maternal and in-
fant health outcomes, and provisions to pro-
tect pregnant people during this pandemic and 
any future public health emergency. 
My bill, the Maternal Vaccination Act or H.R. 
951, directly addresses the health of both 
moms and babies. This bill is critically impor-
tant because although we know that maternal 
vaccinations are important for the health of 
moms and babies, only half of pregnant peo-
ple get their flu vaccines and less than half get 
Tdap vaccinations to protect against pertussis. 
With pertussis on the rise and outbreaks oc-
curring across the United States, we need to 
invest in initiatives to promote maternal immu-
nizations and address racial and ethnic dis-
parities in maternal vaccination rates. Even 
though, white adults have higher vaccination 
coverage than Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Na-
tive American adults, there is more that can 
be done to close this gap. 
I was proud to author the Maternal Vaccina-
tion Act because it provides funding for pro-
grams to increase maternal vaccination rates, 
protecting both new moms and their babies. 
Specifically, the Maternal Vaccination Act 
will provide funding for a public and provider 
awareness campaign to promote maternal and 
child vaccinations. This includes initiatives to 
increase awareness about the safety, impor-
tance, and effectiveness of vaccines for preg-
nant and postpartum people and their children; 
provide targeted, evidence-based, culturally 
and linguistically appropriate resources about 
vaccines to pregnant and postpartum people, 
particularly in communities with historically low 
vaccination rates; and provide evidence-based 
information and resources on the safety and 
importance of maternal and child vaccinations 
to public health departments, maternal health 
care providers, and perinatal health workers. 
This bill, like the Build Back Better Act legis-
lation, will provide historic investments from 
the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act to 
save moms’ lives, end racial and ethnic mater-
nal health disparities, and advance birth equity 
across the United States.

ALBERT ZONA 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to recognize Albert Zona of Pleasantville, 
South Jersey. At the age of 18, Albert was 
drafted into the Army during World War II and 
was stationed in Japan. He was honorably dis-
charged from the Army as a Sergeant in 1947. 
After he was discharged, Albert worked sev-
eral full-time jobs as an auto mechanic until he 
was able to start his own business. He then 
opened his first service station at Edgewater 
Avenue and Main Street and was one of the 
eight original founding members of the Pleas-
antville Volunteer Fire Company, Station 2. 
Around 1952, Al moved his service station to 
Absecon and transferred from Pleasantville to 
Absecon Volunteer Fire Department. He then 
sold that service station in 1998, ending his 
career as a volunteer firefighter. Al should be 
proud of his accomplishments and service to 
the South Jersey community and to America. 
I thank Al for his service. God Bless Al and 
God Bless America.

HONORING 
THE 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF SAN JOAQUIN MEMO-
RIAL HIGH SCHOOL 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the San Joaquin Memorial HighSchool 
on its 75th anniversary. On October 1, 2021, 
this phenomenal educational institution will 
have been serving the youth ofthe San Joa-
quin Valley for 75 years. 
San Joaquin Memorial was founded in 1945 
by the late Most Reverend Philip G. Scher and 
was the first Diocesan Catholic High School 
with junior high students in the Monterey-Fres-
no Diocese. San Joaquin Memorial was 
named by individuals from the San Joaquin 
Valley who gave their lives in World War II. 
That same year of 1945, classes com-
menced after the construction was completed 
on the first three buildings, Shortly thereafter, 
the fourth and fifth buildings were constructed 
and ready to be filled with students. The first 
mass was held on October 3rd; the first rally 
was on November 9th and the first football 
game on November 19th. The first yearbook 
was released in May of 1946. The school has 
continuously expanded and more programs 
were added. Since then, the high school has 
become a premiere educational institution in 
the Valley. 
During the 1970s, Brother Phillip and Sister 
Ann Veronica became the first Vice-Principals 
of the high school. In 1981, Mary Alice Diener 
Library was built, and the science building was 
dedicated to the memory of Br. S. Albert FSC 
and Sr. Paola Harbeke CSC. Both individuals 
were the founding principals for San Joaquin 
Memorial. 
The school is home to state-of-the-art tech-
nology, strong community service involvement, 
and several programs outside of standard 
scholarly activity for their students to take ad-
vantage of. They won the 1991 Valley Football 
Championship over Garces in the Super Holy 
Bowl and continuing into the 2000s, they 
dominated in athletics with many talented 
young student athletes and a talented coach-
ing staff. Because of these advancements, 
many athletes enjoyed new equipment and 
renovations by generous individuals who had 
a passion for the school. 
Over the years, San Joaquin Memorial has 
emphasized their commitment to faith, service, 
and community within a rigorous college-pre-
paratory learning environment that effectively 
prepares their students for their university edu-
cation and the work force. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring my Alma Mater, San Joaquin 
Memorial High School on its 75th anniversary. 
Its service and contributions to the State of 
California and the San Joaquin Valley will al-
ways be celebrated.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA GOVERNMENT AC-
COUNTABILITY 
OFFICE 
HOME 
RULE ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Government 
Accountability Office Home Rule Act. This bill 
would repeal the authority of the U.S. Govern-
ment Accountability Office (GAO) over the Dis-
trict of Columbia. 
GAO, a federal agency that conducts inves-
tigations and audits for Congress, has the 
same authority over D.C. that it has over fed-
eral agencies. GAO’s authorizing statute de-
fines D.C. as a federal agency. In addition, 
GAO’s authorizing statute and the D.C. Home 
Rule Act require GAO to engage in specific 
types of oversight of D.C. 
D.C. is not a federal agency, and it should 
never be treated as such. The District already 
has a locally appointed auditor and inspector 
general, so GAO’s authority over D.C. is both 
redundant and offensive. GAO does not have 
general authority over states and cities, and 
therefore should not have such authority over 
D.C. 
This is an important step to increase home 
rule for the District and does not require state-
hood. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

HONORING MADAME JOSEPHINE 
BAKER 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today on a very historic occasion for the 
international community as we celebrate the 
life of American-born singer, dancer, World 
War II hero and civil rights icon Josephine 
Baker. 
On November 30th, Madame Baker will be 
reinterred in a ceremony at the Pantheon 
monument in Paris, France. This will make her 
the first American, the first Black woman, and 
the first entertainer to receive the country’s 
highest honor. Madame Baker’s induction into 
the Paris Pantheon will put her among the 
company of the highest French achievers in 
Arts, Letters, and Science. 
Though born an American citizen, Madame 
Baker lived most of her life in France and be-
came a French citizen in the 1930s. Growing 
up homeless and in poverty, she became an 
internationally recognized entertainer and ac-
tress. However, her contributions did not stop

in the arts. She was also a key member of the 
French Resistance movement during World 
War II, acting as a spy, as she gathered intel-
ligence and smuggled messages for resist-
ance forces. 
After the war, Madame Baker was awarded 
with one of France’s top military honors, the 
Croix de Guerre, for her role in resisting occu-
pation under the Nazis. 
Even as France became her home, Ma-
dame Baker never turned her back on the 
United States and the social injustice hap-
pening here. She used her celebrity to push 
against Jim Crow segregation and leveraged 
her platform to support the Civil Rights Move-
ment happening at the time. On numerous oc-
casions, she returned to the United States to 
perform. However, she refused to play in seg-
regated establishments and championed racial 
equality—including right here in the San Fran-
cisco Bay Area. 
In the 1950’s Madame Baker appeared with 
Paul Robeson supporting better pay for Oak-
land dock workers and longshoreman, she 
took part in Berkeley protests demanding 
Black people be hired as transit workers on 
the Key Line, and she warned that she would 
not perform at San Francisco’s Golden Gate 
Theatre unless Black patrons could buy tickets 
to her concerts. 
For her civil rights activities in challenging 
racial segregation, Madame Baker was la-
beled ‘‘a communist troublemaker’’ and put on 
the FBI watchlist. She lost her U.S. citizenship 
rights for over a decade. 
It was not until the intervention of then U.S. 
Attorney General, Robert Kennedy, that she 
was finally allowed to return to the U.S. in 
1963 to speak at the March on Washington. 
Wearing her French Resistance military uni-
form, Madame Baker was one of the few 
women speakers to address the crowd that 
day as a quarter million people gathered be-
fore the Lincoln monument. 
‘‘You know I have always taken the rocky 
path,’’ she told the crowd. ‘‘I never took the 
easy one, but as I get older, and as I knew I 
had the power and the strength, I took that 
rocky path and I tried to smooth it out a little. 
I wanted to make it easier for you. I want you 
to have a chance at what I had.’’ 
This is the legacy of Madame Josephine 
Baker that we celebrate and uplift on the glob-
al stage. From the Pantheon in Paris to the 
halls of the U.S. Congress, we honor her con-
tributions, courage, and conviction to make 
this world a better place for us all. 
On behalf of the 13th Congressional District 
of California, I commend Madame Josephine 
Baker for her service and dedication.

SEA ISLE CITY BEACH PATROL 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW

Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, in Octo-
ber, I had the opportunity to attend the Sea 
Isle City Beach Patrol Annual Hall of Fame In-
duction. The Sea Isle Beach Patrol was offi-
cially formed in 1919 to protect beachgoers 
who vacationed in the popular resort town. It 
started as just two lifeguards and three volun-
teers and has now grown into a large group. 
At the induction I attended, Robert Herzog, Bill 
Feaster, Jr., Jim Guntle, Jordy Troyan, Danny 
Rodgers, and Pat Scannapieco were inducted 
into the Beach Patrol Hall of Fame. These in-
dividuals should be proud of their accomplish-
ments and service to South Jersey, and it was 
my honor to watch the ceremony. God Bless 
the Sea Isle Beach Patrol, and God Bless 
America.

HONORING THE LIFE OF KATHRYN 
BONNIE HASSETT 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Kathryn Bonnie Hassett. Kath-
ryn passed away in her Merced home on Au-
gust 26, 2021 after a seven-year battle with 
cancer. Kathryn was a mother, daughter, 
grandmother, and friend. 
Kathryn was the daughter of Ken and Midge 
Riggs. She went to school in Merced, Cali-
fornia at Merced High School and later went 
on to study at California State University, 
Fresno where she received her Bachelor of 
Arts in Health Sciences. After graduating from 
Fresno State, Kathryn attended the University 
of San Francisco where she graduated with 
her Master of Arts Degree in Educational Psy-
chology, with an emphasis on Marriage and 
Family. 
She was reunited with Frank ‘‘Flip’’ Hassett 
while attending Fresno State, as they had first 
met when they were much younger at the 
Skimmers swim meets. During their time in 
college, they dated until they were married in 
1975, after Kathy began her career in Social 
Services with Merced County while Flip 
coached swimming and water polo. They had 
two children together in 1977 and 1979. 
In her free time, Kathy always enjoyed try-
ing new things while spending time outdoors 
and traveling. She and her husband Flip espe-
cially loved rafting in Class 5 rivers all over the 
West and even in the Colorado River through 
the Grand Canyon. In addition to rafting, Kathy 
was skilled at snow and water skiing in Yo-
semite, Lake Tahoe, China Peak, and various 
other locations. 
Once she retired after 35 years with Merced 
County, Kathy continued her love for travel 
and exploration by partaking in several sea 
and river cruises all over the world, including 
a Disney Cruise in 2018 to Cabo San Lucas, 
when she was able to bring all of their children 
and grandchildren along for the trip. 
Kathy was an active member of various 
community organizations in Merced including 
the League of Women Votes, Leadership 
Merced—Class 14, United Way, the Hospital 
Assistance League, MCMC Foundation, Fed-
eral Emergency Management Team, Con-
tinuity of Care Committee, Specialized Man-
agement Area Response Team, Adult Serv-
ices Committee, and CalWorks Advisory Com-
mittee. In addition to her commitment to 
Merced County, Kathy also worked in associa-
tions at the state level, including Child Protec-
tive Services, Adult Protective Services, and 
Human Services Directors. 
Her dedication to her community dem-
onstrated her immense faith in humanity. Her 
warm spirit and loving charm was something 
she never failed to share with her children, 
family, and the community of the Central Val-
ley and California as a whole. 
Kathy is survived by her loving husband 
Frank ‘‘Flip’’ Hassett; her children Heather 
Shepherd 
(Kelcey) 
and 
Frank 
Hassett 
(Amber); and siblings Karen Davey (Erwin), 
Curtis Riggs (Gaye), and Kraig Riggs (Robin). 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Kathryn Bonnie 
Hassett. Her service and contributions to the 
Central Valley and the State of California will 
be long remembered. I join her family and 
friends in celebrating Kathryn’s life.

HONORING DAVID N. SHAFER 
HON. LINDA T. SA´NCHEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to honor David N. Shafer, a constituent 
who lives in Whittier, California, as he retires 
after 31 years of work providing affordable 
housing for American families. 
David has dedicated his life to increasing 
access to affordable housing for Californians. 
During his tenure at WNC, a leading afford-
able housing fund, David served as Chief 
Legal Officer and oversaw all legal affairs. In 
this role, he was instrumental in the under-
writing, negotiation, and acquisition of more 
than 1,400 affordable housing communities 
representing over 93,000 apartment units for 
low-income families, senior citizens, and vet-
erans. 
David contributed his extensive insight and 
knowledge of affordable housing to his indus-
try by serving as president and long-time 
member of the board of directors of the Cali-
fornia Council for Affordable Housing and as 
director for the Council of Affordable and Rural 
Housing. Guided by an unwavering commit-
ment to ‘‘do the right thing,’’ David has been 
a respected mentor to a countless number of 
colleagues in his career. 
David has been married for 34 years to his 
wife Monica. David and Monica are blessed 
with three children and seven grandchildren. 
David’s children describe him as the rock and 
foundation of their family. They praise him for 
his kindness, compassion, attentiveness, and 
love. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing 
David Shafer a happy retirement and thanking 
him for years of service in the affordable hous-
ing space. His work has improved the lives of 
many individuals and will continue to do so for 
years to come.

REMEMBERING KEVIN NISHITA 
HON. ERIC SWALWELL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize Kevin Fumito Nishita, a retired San 
Francisco Bay Area police officer who was 
murdered in a senseless act of gun violence 
while working as a security guard for a tele-
vision crew in Oakland, CA. 
Kevin’s death has devastated not only his 
family and friends, but also the Bay Area’s law 
enforcement 
and 
journalism 
communities, 
which had come to know him as an energetic, 
professional protector and a supportive friend. 
He died protecting practitioners of one of our 
nation’s most sacred rights: the freedom of the 
press. 
Kevin served as an officer with the Oakland 
Housing Authority Police Department and the 
Hayward Police Department before joining the 
San Jose Police Department in 2001. There, 
he worked as a Gang Investigations detective 
as well as working the Gaming/Vice Unit. In 
addition to his police assignments, Kevin also 
spent some time representing his peers as a 
director with the San Jose´ Police Officers As-
sociation. 
He then joined the Colma Police Depart-
ment in 2012, serving as a Detective, Field 
Training Officer, and Officer in Charge before 
being promoted to Sergeant in 2015 and retir-
ing in 2018. Since early 2020, Kevin worked 
with the Star Protection Agency, often accom-
panying personnel from various Bay Area tele-
vision stations into unsafe areas. 
He was protecting a KRON4 news crew in 
downtown Oakland at midday on Nov. 24 
when a group of men attempted to rob the 
crew of its camera. Kevin intervened and was 
shot; he succumbed to his injuries three days 
later. 
He is survived by his wife, Virginia Nishita; 
his mother, Mary Yukiko Nishita; his father, 
Dan Fumito Nishita; his stepson, Enrique 
Ramiro Serrano; his daughter-in-law, Elaine 
Hebron 
Edjan; 
his 
daughter, 
Maureen 
Campos; his son-in-law, Marlowe Campos; 
and his grandsons, Titus Mackoa Campos, 
Kahuna Cudi Campos, and Dash Wilfred 
Campos. 
Colleagues remember Kevin by nicknames 
including ‘‘Turbo’’ and ‘‘Stitch,’’ after the ani-
mated character, for his high-energy, always- 
moving persona. His family says he was an 
extremely hard worker who never asked for 
anything in return, who opened his home to so 
many people who needed help, a man of deep 
compassion. 
Kevin Nishita’s death should be a wake-up 
call that gun violence is a scourge upon our 
communities that must be addressed and 
stopped, His life should be remembered as a 
celebration of public service and fellowship, a 
model for all who knew and loved him. I offer 
his family, friends, and colleagues my deepest 
condolences on this terrible loss. 
COMMEMORATING 
THE 
KINGDOM 
OF BAHRAIN’S 50TH NATIONAL 
DAY 
HON. SCOTT PERRY 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, on December 
16, the Kingdom of Bahrain will mark its 50th 
National Day. I’m joined by many of my col-
leagues in congratulating the Bahraini people 
on this impressive milestone. 
The contributions of the Kingdom of Bahrain 
to the peace and security of the wider Middle 
East region cannot be understated; look no 
further than the support of Bahrain in assisting 
U.S. evacuation efforts in Afghanistan, or to 
the Kingdom’s hosting of the U.S. Navy’s 5th 
Fleet. Bahrain also assists U.S. counterter-
rorism efforts in marginalizing the use of 
drones by Iranian proxy groups. 
Bahrain remains an instrumental security 
partner and ally of the United States. In 2002, 
Bahrain became a Major Non-NATO Ally, a 
designation given only to close partner states. 
Through our enhanced defense cooperation, 
we have been able to curtail the malign and 
toxic influence of the Iranian regime. 
The Kingdom of Bahrain has so clearly aug-
mented the prospect for regional peace 
through its participation in the Abraham Ac-
cords, and now maintains an embassy in 
Israel. Bahrain’s Constitution continues to en-
shrine freedom of religion guarantees for all 
Bahraini citizens—to include women’s right to 
vote and run for office. 
In recognition of its 50th National Day, I 
warmly congratulate the people of Bahrain on 
the founding of their young nation, and wish 
them good health, prosperity, and security for 
many more years.

IN RECOGNITION OF MARY BETH 
WALKER AND HER SERVICE TO 
THE HOUSE COMMITTEE ON THE 
JUDICIARY 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise— 
along with HANK JOHNSON, Chair of the Sub-
committee on Courts, Intellectual Property, 
and the Internet—to thank Mary Beth Walker 
for her service to the Committee as a counsel 
detailed from the U.S. Patent and Trademark 
Office to the Subcommittee on Courts, Intel-
lectual Property, and the Internet. 
Over the past two-and-a-half years, Mary 
Beth has helped the Committee achieve a 
great deal. This includes the passage last 
Congress of the Trademark Modernization Act, 
which, among other things, responded to the 
growing number of fraudulent trademark appli-
cations as well as the documented large num-
ber of unused marks on the register by cre-
ating two new ex parte proceedings to remove 
registered trademarks that were not in use 
when the application was made, or had never 
been used. This will help those seeking new 
registrations, like small businesses, have a 
better chance at obtaining a strong trademark 
of their initial preference. 
Mary Beth was also instrumental in advanc-
ing the SHOP SAFE Act in this Congress. 
This bill seeks to address the scourge of 
counterfeits being sold by third parties on on-
line e-commerce platforms by reforming a dec-
ade-old liability structure established by case 
law rather than Congress. Mary Beth worked 
tirelessly with stakeholders and other Con-
gressional staff to try to ensure that the bill 
strikes the right balance to make a meaningful 
difference in reducing the number of counter-
feits being sold to unsuspecting consumers. 
Mary Beth has shown herself to be a dedi-
cated public servant and a true team player, 
willing to help out on other hearings and intel-
lectual property issues that came before the 
Committee. We will miss her greatly, but we 
are glad that her expertise will remain in serv-
ice to the public with her return to the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office as an Associate 
Solicitor. 
We thank Mary Beth for her service to the 
Committee and wish her the best of luck with 
the next chapter in her career.

UNION 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
DISTRICT 
HON. KEVIN McCARTHY 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Dr. David Vierra for 40 years 
of service in public education and the lasting 
contributions he has made to the Antelope 
Valley, his lifelong home. In August of this 
year, David retired from his position as Ante-
lope Valley Union High School District Super-
intendent after serving for nearly two decades 
in that role. 
Upon graduating from Antelope Valley High 
School in Lancaster, California, one of the 
very schools that he would later serve as Dis-
trict Superintendent, David earned his bach-
elor’s degree from California State University, 
Northridge, and subsequently began his ca-
reer in education in 1981 as a teacher in the 
Lancaster Elementary School District. Soon 
after, he took his talents abroad, serving in the 
U.S. Department of Defense as an instructor 
at Kaiserslautern American High School in 
Germany, where he also coached football and 
basketball. 
In 1998, David became the Assistant Super-
intendent of Personnel Services at the Ante-
lope Valley Union High School District and just 
four years later—a true testament to his inher-
ent leadership skills—David was tapped to 
lead the school district as Superintendent. 
Under David’s direction, the Antelope Valley 
Union High School District has transformed 
into a vastly successful school system that 
prepares students for the 21st century and 
has even been internationally recognized. In 
2018, Antelope Valley Union High School Dis-
trict received a special, six-year districtwide 
accreditation from the Accreditation Commis-
sion for Schools, Western Association of 
Schools and Colleges (WASC), a world-re-
nowned accrediting association in the United 
States that works closely with the Office of 
Overseas Schools under the Department of 
State. The Antelope Valley Union High School

District is the first school district in the conti-
nental United States to receive district-wide 
WASC accreditation. 
Over the past few decades, Antelope Valley 
students have received full-ride scholarships 
to prestigious universities and have been 
awarded national recognitions for their suc-
cesses. David also worked to establish Stu-
dents on Academic Rise (SOAR), an early col-
lege high school program that prepares stu-
dents, many of which come from disadvan-
taged backgrounds, seeking alternative career 
paths to successfully enter the workforce. 
David’s passion for education reflects his 
own academic journey, as he earned a mas-
ter’s degree from Azusa Pacific University and 
a PhD in education philosophy from Claremont 
Graduate University, all while balancing his 
leadership obligations and commitment to 
helping students pursue their interests in and 
outside of the classroom. David is also well- 
known in the Antelope Valley community as 
being exceptionally generous with his time and 
talent, dedicating countless hours to local 
civic, athletic, and educational organizations. 
David has served the Antelope Valley Hospital 
Foundation as a Director, the University of An-
telope Valley as Chairman of the Board, and 
the Antelope Valley Board of Trade as a 
Board Member on its Education Committee. 
This past summer, David received the key to 
the City of Lancaster, a well-deserved honor. 
Known for his personal approach to edu-
cation and leadership, David spent his time as 
Superintendent building relationships with stu-
dents, parents, and teachers. The President of 
the Antelope Valley Union High School Dis-
trict’s Board of Education noted that this spe-
cial quality, along with David’s integrity and 
‘‘unwavering commitment to solving the near 
impossible’’—especially during the coronavirus 
pandemic—helped him lead the Antelope Val-
ley Union High School District ‘‘through the 
unthinkable.’’ On behalf of the 23rd Congres-
sional District of California, I wish David, his 
wife, and three children all the best as they 
enter this exciting new chapter of life.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF REVEREND ELIZABETH COLE-
MAN 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life of Reverend Eliza-
beth V. Coleman. 
A lifelong Bay Area resident, Elizabeth was 
born in 1965 and raised in San Pablo. She 
graduated from San Francisco University Law 
School in 1999, launching her legal career. 
Elizabeth went on to earn a Master of Divinity 
and a Master of Arts in Community Leadership 
from American Baptist Seminary. She became 
an ordained Reverend in 2011. 
Elizabeth’s desire to help children and fami-
lies was evident throughout her career. After 
working for some time as a corporate lawyer, 
Elizabeth realized her passion for advocacy. 
Elizabeth supported young people as a court 
appointed advocate with Alameda and Contra 
Costa County’s Juvenile Dependency Courts. 
Elizabeth also played a significant role in es-
tablishing the Justice Rising Youth Court at 
the Berkeley Technology Academy, a program 
aimed at reducing suspension rates. Addition-
ally, Elizabeth worked with a number of non-
profits throughout her career to advance the 
needs of children, including the San Francisco 
Children’s Legal Defense Fund. Elizabeth was 
a champion of children’s issues and fought 
tirelessly to promote justice through her work. 
Elizabeth was also deeply passionate about 
her community. She was an Associate Pastor 
at McGee Avenue Baptist Church in Berkeley 
and ran programs focused on restorative jus-
tice and addressing food insecurity. Elizabeth 
will be remembered for her compassionate na-
ture and her commitment to service. 
Sadly, Elizabeth passed away earlier this 
month. She was a cherished member of the 
East Bay community and will be remembered 
for her leadership, integrity, and compassion. 
Please join me in honoring Elizabeth for her 
many contributions to our community.

CONGRATULATING THE AUSABLE 
VALLEY 
GIRLS 
SOCCER 
TEAM 
ON THEIR STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
WIN 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate the AuSable Valley girls’ 
varsity soccer team on winning the New York 
State Championship title. 
For the first time since the start of the pro-
gram, the AuSable Valley girls’ soccer team 
earned their place in the Final Four game led 
by head coach Lindsey Douglas. They carried 
this momentum with them through to the state 
championship game, and on November 14th, 
the AuSable Valley girls’ soccer team made 
program history when they valiantly defeated 
the Carle Place Frogs in a 1–0 win. 
This momentous win was not achieved 
overnight. The team was focused and deter-
mined to reach this goal all season. The Patri-
ots’ unity and dedication was evident in their 
impressive performance in the championship 
game. The New York State Public High 
School Championship game was fiercely com-
petitive and not easily won. Their win was no 
small feat and deserves to be celebrated. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate the AuSa-
ble Valley girls’ varsity soccer team on their 
tremendous win and their well-deserved state 
championship title. I hope that their hard work 
and dedication serves as inspiration for gen-
erations to come.

TRIBUTE TO JULIA TAYLOR 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize Julia Taylor, an in-
novative business leader, trailblazer, and the 
president of the Greater Milwaukee Committee 
(GMC) for 19 years. In 2002, Ms. Taylor be-
came the first woman to become president of 
the Civic Group and tirelessly served for al-
most two decades. 
GMC is a private sector civic organization 
whose mission is to contribute to the cultural 
and economic base of the Milwaukee Metro-
politan area. The organization was formed in 
the late 1940s and is comprised of leaders in 
business, the professions, labor, education 
and philanthropy, and nonprofit community de-
velopment. The GMC is made up of almost 
200 leaders of businesses, financial institu-
tions, law firms, nonprofit groups, and edu-
cational institutions in the metropolitan area 
and is dedicated to improving Southeastern 
Wisconsin’s civic life and economy. 
Since 2002, the GMC and the City of Mil-
waukee progressed exponentially under Ms. 
Taylor’s leadership. Julia Taylor brought great-
er diversity to the membership and the GMC 
board. GMC now has a record number of mi-
norities and women serving in leadership 
roles. Ms. Taylor expanded GMC’s work to de-
velop and innovate all areas of Milwaukee, es-
pecially impoverished areas that are too often 
forgotten. She worked tirelessly to build new 
relationships with local community leaders and 
stakeholders. Because of Ms. Taylor’s work, 
GMC is having a much greater impact in 
neighborhoods, education and economic de-
velopment at the most basic levels. 
Under Ms. Taylor’s leadership, the GMC 
won local and national support for its projects 
that include efforts to promote and support 
economic prosperity, vibrancy of place, and 
development of innovation and talent. Due to 
Ms. Taylor’s work, the work of the GMC in 
building a better, greater Milwaukee for all of 
our citizens is more important than ever. 
Ms. Taylor serves on several boards and 
was the Executive Director of the Milwaukee 
YWCA for many years before assuming her 
current position. She is being honored and 
recognized for her decades of community en-
gagement in the Greater Milwaukee Area. In 
fact, Ms. Taylor continues to set a strong ex-
ample to us all by displaying humor, grace 
and good will to all and we wish her a long 
and happy retirement. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I am 
honored to pay tribute to Ms. Julia Taylor for 
her contributions to the Fourth Congressional 
District and the State of Wisconsin. She has 
helped transform the lives of many people in 
our community.

LEY SCHOOL DISTRICT’S BOARD 
OF EDUCATION PRESIDENT, TINA 
MARQUIS, ON HER RETIREMENT 
HON. JOE NEGUSE 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Tina Marquis, the President of 
the Boulder Valley School District Board of 
Education, in Colorado for her many years of 
service to our community and our students. 
Tina has been a Board Member of Boulder 
Valley since 2013, and during her tenure she 
also served as the Board Treasurer and four 
years as President. 
She has a more than decade-long history of 
volunteerism and service to the Boulder Valley 
community, beginning with the elementary 
school her two children attended—and eventu-
ally at the district-level through the District Ac-
countability Committee, where she served as 
the chairwoman for two years.

November 30, 2021 
She is a tireless advocate for public edu-
cation, equity and student safety and has 
worked closely with local municipalities and 
state legislators to address the safety needs of 
students. 
Finally, during the pandemic and the other 
challenges she has been a stalwart leader, 
approaching each challenge with an open 
mind, while also being committed to doing 
what was best for students. 
She was recently recognized for her out-
standing leadership by the Colorado Associa-
tion of School Boards—who bestowed upon 
her their McGuffey Award. 
I would like to thank Tina Marquis for her 
outstanding service to the Boulder Valley 
School District, to the State of Colorado and to 
our great country. She, no doubt, has been a 
beacon of leadership—and her influence has 
benefited the lives of many children in BVSD 
and beyond.

TYLER WILSON 
HON. JEFFERSON VAN DREW 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 30, 2021 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, this 
month, I had the pleasure of presenting Tyler 
Wilson with his Eagle Scout Court of Honor. 
Tyler began as a Tiger Cub at a young age 
and proceeded through the Scout ranks up to 
Eagle Scout in October of 2019. Throughout 
his time as a Scout, Tyler became a member 
of The Order of the Arrow and is now a Vigil 
member. Additionally, with his friend Dominic, 
he founded Troop 2. For his Eagle Scout 
project, Tyler constructed a therapeutic riding 
arena for handicap kids at the Gloucester 
County 4H grounds. Scouting has had a major 
influence in Tyler’s life, and it was my honor 
to have had the opportunity to recognize him 
for his service to the South Jersey community. 
God Bless Tyler and God Bless America.
