PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Spirit of the living God, breathe Your 
grace and love into the business and 
the busyness of this day. 
Make us aware of our breath, that we 
would inhale the refreshment of Your 
peace, a peace we do not always, and 
perhaps cannot fully, understand. 
Help us to exhale stress—all the 
thoughts, 
nuisances, 
concerns 
that 
overwhelm, terrify, or inhibit our abil-
ity to see that You abide with us even 
still. 
May we breathe in Your goodness, al-
lowing it to penetrate the hardness of 
our hearts and the reluctance of our 
spirits to live kindly and gently with 
the people with whom we serve. 
Then help us to breathe out our anx-
iety and aggravations caused by the 
differences that divide us and the trou-
bles of the world around us. 
Enable us to inhale Your wisdom and 
exhale our pride, to take in Your en-
couragement, and to push out despair. 
Holy God, we invite You into our 
hearts and minds this day that You 
would refresh us with the clarity and 
understanding only You provide. 
Breathe on us breath of God. Fill us 
with life anew. We pray this in the life- 
giving strength of Your holy name. 
Amen.

AMERICA COMPETES ACT 
TACKLES CHALLENGES 
(Mr. SCHRADER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. SCHRADER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of the America 
COMPETES Act of 2022. 
This comprehensive bill tackles the 
challenges everyday Oregonians face 
right now with supply chain and con-
sequent rising consumer prices. It is a 
huge investment in our competitive-
ness on the global stage for the 21st 
century. 
It 
invests 
$45 
billion 
to 
strengthen and improve our supply 
chains while incentivizing manufac-
turing of critical security goods that 
should be made right here in the 
United States. 
As the pandemic has shown us, active 
ingredients 
of 
lifesaving 
pharma-
ceuticals and PPE gear should not be 
all made overseas. 
I am also glad that leadership in-
cluded the $52 billion in emergency 
CHIPS Act funding, a priority for my 
Problem Solvers Caucus and the State 
of Oregon. Without this Federal invest-
ment, 
our 
semiconductor 
problems 
would only grow worse. We will con-
tinue to see critical shortages, hin-
dering a wide range of industries in my 
district and across the Nation. Passage 
here will strengthen our domestic sup-
ply and lead to good-paying jobs for 
our citizens and companies as they 
move to expand and set up our domes-
tic manufacturing facilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H950 
February 4, 2022 
This bill contains bipartisan pro-
posals to keep us innovating and cre-
ating in critical industries and makes 
sure that the United States is not at 
the mercy of a tenuous international 
supply chain. 
f 
CONGRATULATING ANDY KLINE 
ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, today 
I recognize corrections officer and 
Local 148 Union President Andy Kline, 
who is retiring after 25 years of service 
at USP Lewisburg and FCC Allenwood. 
In Congress it has been my pleasure 
to work with Andy on issues related to 
the Bureau of Prisons. His insight has 
been vital for our team in creating the 
Bureau of Prisons Reform Caucus and 
working on legislation to improve 
staffing shortages, inmate security, 
and emergency preparedness. 
In addition to his career with the Bu-
reau of Prisons, Andy served in the 
Army Reserves for 8 years and is heav-
ily involved in helping others in his 
community. Andy is a Pennsylvania 
native and a dedicated servant who al-
ways puts others before himself. 
While his retirement is well deserved, 
Andy’s impact and leadership at the 
BOP will be missed. 
Andy, thank you for the sacrifices 
you have made to keep our community 
safe. Enjoy your retirement with your 
family and congratulations on an out-
standing career of service. 
f 
AMERICA COMPETES ACT IS A WIN 
FOR THE COUNTRY 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, for decades 
we have heard elected officials right-
fully decry the loss of American jobs, 
and then promise to bring them back. 
And for generations Americans have 
waited for that promise. Here is the 
chance. 
Since 
January 
2000, 
the 
United 
States has lost over a quarter of all do-
mestic 
manufacturing 
jobs. 
That 
means a decline of more than 4.7 mil-
lion jobs in just two decades. 
Real people have paid the con-
sequences. I have seen it in my own 
district, 
suburban 
Philadelphia; 
in 
places like Pottstown, Boyertown, Nor-
ristown that have lost manufacturing 
jobs and opportunities. 
The America COMPETES Act is a 
chance to revitalize these and other 
communities as well as to strengthen 
our national security. Here are some 
highlights: 
$52 billion to maintain and expand 
our production of semiconductor chips 
right here at home, which run our cars, 
phones, computers, healthcare system; 
$45 billion to improve our supply 
chains, with a special focus on pro-
ducing more of our critical goods here; 
and 
Investments in scientific research 
and innovation so that we are not only 
in this century but we are globally 
leading it. 
This bipartisan legislation should be 
an easy ‘‘yes’’ for everyone in this 
Chamber and everyone in the Senate to 
pass. The America COMPETES Act is 
not a political win. It is a win for 
America. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE REMARKABLE 
LIFE OF LOIS BOUTON 
(Mr. WOMACK asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember the remarkable life 
of an honorable patriot, the late Lois 
Bouton of Rogers, Arkansas. She died 
recently at the age of 102. 
Most know her lovingly as the Coast 
Guard Lady, but that nickname didn’t 
just stem from 20 years as a member of 
the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary Flotilla 
on Beaver Lake in Arkansas. During 
World War II she enlisted in the U.S. 
Coast Guard Women’s Reserve, where 
she acted as a radio operator. She was 
discharged in 1945 from the SPARs. 
That is the acronym reflecting the 
Coast Guard’s motto: Semper Paratus- 
Always Ready. 
However, her passion for service 
never left. Lois made it a point to visit 
with wounded and recovering military 
members, always taking particular 
care to find her fellow Coasties. This 
was just the start of her mission to up-
lift others. She tirelessly wrote over 
100,000 handwritten letters to greet and 
encourage personnel. Her words have 
crossed oceans and seas, reaching le-
gions of Coast Guard members and 
their families all over the world. 
Her dedication earned her the rank of 
Honorary Master Chief Petty Officer, 
Department of Defense Spirit of Hope 
Award, the U.S. Coast Guard Distin-
guished Public Service Award, and 
more. But she always maintained that 
her greatest accomplishment was the 
joy she helped spread. 
I want the Nation to know of this ex-
traordinary American. Fair winds and 
following seas to the beloved Coast 
Guard Lady from Arkansas. 
f 
SUPPORTING AMERICAN WORKERS 
(Ms. NEWMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. NEWMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate how the Amer-
ica COMPETES Act will empower man-
ufacturing workers and small busi-
nesses on Chicago’s southwest side and 
suburbs. 
For too long, America’s supply chain 
has relied on countries like China to 
bring us critical goods and services. 
And who has suffered? Of course, it is 
not the CEOs who ship jobs overseas. It 
is America’s factory workers, small 
businesses, and local manufacturers. 
This bill is for them. And that is ex-
actly why I have introduced amend-
ments to this bill to boost American 
jobs and strengthen the supply chain 
with new workforce development pro-
grams. 
Let’s support American workers, in-
vest in American businesses, and let’s 
create millions of American jobs. 
By passing the America COMPETES 
Act, we will do just that.

RON BRICKEY WORKED 
TIRELESSLY TO SERVE OTTUMWA 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life 
of a man who dedicated his life to serv-
ing my hometown. 
On January 9, 2022, Ron Brickey of 
Ottumwa passed away. A fellow Army 
veteran, Ron grew up in Ottumwa, 
graduated from Ottumwa High School, 
and went on to earn a degree in finance 
and engineering from Iowa State Uni-
versity. 
He worked for over 40 years at 
McCune & Reed Insurance, serving as 
president and co-owner. 
Ron was a lifetime member of First 
Presbyterian Church, serving on the 
board of elders and singing in the 
church choir. He is also a former presi-
dent and longtime member of the Ro-
tary Club of Ottumwa, served on the 
board of the American Home Finding 
Association, was a member of the 
Ottumwa Chamber of Commerce, re-
ceived the Gene Schultz Award for 
community service, served on the 
Ottumwa Area Development Council, 
and was president of the Ottumwa Re-
gional Health Center Board. 
He cooked countless chickens for the 
Ottumwa Rotary Oktoberfest barbecue, 
raised thousands for the McCreery Can-
cer Center and the Bridge View Con-
vention Center. Ron worked tirelessly 
to leave the world a better place than 
he found it, and he was successful. 
Ron’s wife, Janet, his two children, 
and seven grandchildren are in my 
prayers.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF CEOLE 
SPEIGHT 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the life of 
Ceole Speight. 
Elta Ceole Branam Speight was born 
on June 8, 1928, and was reunited in 
Heaven with her husband of 63 years, 
Joseph, on January 24, 2022. 
As a member of the United Food and 
Commercial Workers, Local 455, Ceole 
was appointed as the volunteer and 
programs director at the Harris County

AFL–CIO in 1968. She would go on to 
give 40 years of dedicated service to the 
labor movement in Houston and in 
Texas. 
She will be remembered by many as a 
strong, Democratic woman who fought 
for what she believed in, who always 
saw what was wrong and tried to make 
it right. I will remember her as a hard 
worker, whose hard work was really in-
fectious. You simply could not sit by 
when Ceole was around. She guided, 
she pushed, she advised, she poked, she 
served as a role model for all of us. 
Our thoughts are with Ceole’s family 
and the countless friends and allies 
whose lives she touched with her time 
and her generosity on this Earth. 
Rest easy, dear friend, you will be 
missed.

PATSY BENNETT’S LEGACY OF 
BEAUTY, GRACE, AND SERVICE 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in honor of a life 
spent in service and love for others, 
Patsy Bennett of Jesup, Georgia. 
If you got married in southeast Geor-
gia in the 1960s to the late 1980s, you 
probably had the pleasure of working 
with Patsy Bennett. 
Patsy was special to many people in 
her community because she was dedi-
cated to making their special day un-
forgettable. Patsy made it her mission 
to ensure every bride had whatever 
dress she wanted, and if she didn’t have 
it on hand, she would craft it herself. 
At her bridal store, one could pick 
out their own flowers, have brides-
maids’ luncheons, rehearsal dinners, 
and even hold their wedding ceremony 
in Patsy’s big room. 
Patsy left a beautiful mark on every-
thing she created—be that a wedding, a 
bridal shower, or a relationship she de-
veloped with the women she served. 
Her 
service 
to 
our 
community’s 
women and families truly was not only 
remarkable but fun to watch in the 
form of beautiful ceremonies. 
Patsy’s legacy is one of beauty, 
grace, and service, and my thoughts 
and prayers reside with her family and 
those affected by this tremendous loss.

LIMITING IMPACTS FROM SUPPLY 
CHAIN SHOCKS 
(Mr. O’HALLERAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to voice my support for the 
America COMPETES Act, for which 
my amendment to this legislation was 
adopted. 
This legislative package will make 
new investments in research, innova-
tion, and American manufacturing. It 
will ensure that the United States can 
outcompete any nation in the world for 
the coming decades. 
Importantly, our bill would address 
issues with our supply chain and higher 
prices for families at the grocery store 
and the gas pump. Even small price in-
creases make a painful dent for rural 
and Tribal families in our district. 
That is why I introduced the amend-
ment to the legislation that will ensure 
these rural and Tribal families, like so 
many of Arizona’s First District, are 
not overlooked. 
My amendment tasks the Depart-
ment of Commerce with publishing a 
report every 4 years on supply chain re-
silience and domestic manufacturing. 
Understanding 
how 
supply 
chain 
shocks impact rural, Tribal, and under-
served communities is critical for their 
future growth. 
I am committed to working with my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to 
identify commonsense legislative solu-
tions that continue to address these 
issues. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF 
MARTHA BANDA 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to re-
member the life of Martha Banda, a 
lifetime resident of Johnstown, Penn-
sylvania, who passed away in January 
surrounded by family. She was 87 years 
old. 
One of Martha’s biggest accomplish-
ments was serving the Johnstown com-
munity as the first Democratic woman 
to be elected to the Johnstown City 
Council. From there, Martha was an 
elected member of the Democratic 
State Committee and served as an ap-
pointed member and chairperson of the 
Johnstown Housing Authority and sec-
retary of the Cambria County War Me-
morial Authority. 
Martha’s role as a public servant con-
tinued when she was elected by council 
to serve as deputy mayor of Johnstown 
for 4 years. 
Outside of Martha’s role in politics, 
Martha was a faithful member of St. 
Benedict Parish, where she served in a 
variety of roles. 
Martha was always giving back to 
the community, serving as a member of 
the Salvation Army Advisory Board as 
well as president of the Moxham Citi-
zen’s Association in 1979. Martha also 
served on the Bottle Works Board and 
was a member of the American Asso-
ciation of University Women, Quota 
Club, the Chrysanthemum Society, and 
the Pennsylvania Association of School 
Retirees. 
Martha’s 
impact 
on 
the 
greater 
Johnstown community will not be for-
gotten. My prayers are with Martha’s 
family and her friends. 
BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
UNDERWOOD). Pursuant to clause 1(c) of 
rule XIX, further consideration of the 
bill (H.R. 4521) to provide for a coordi-
nated Federal research initiative to en-
sure continued United States leader-
ship in engineering biology will now re-

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
AMENDMENT NO. 239 OFFERED BY MRS. STEEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 239 
printed in part D of House Report 117– 
241. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 1341, after line 19, add the following: 
(10) the United States should seek to re-
quire the Chinese Communist Party to 
match emission cutting targets established 
by the United States. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tlewoman from California (Mrs. STEEL) 
and a Member opposed each will con-
trol 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself 2 minutes. 
China has avoided accountability for 
their unfair trade practices, gross 
human rights violations, and environ-
mental abuse for too long. 
My amendment would require the 
Chinese Communist Party to match 
emission-cutting targets established by 
the United States. 
China accounts for 28 percent of glob-
al greenhouse gas emissions, more than 
any other country in the world. This 
amendment takes necessary steps to 
hold China accountable for their pollu-
tion. It is time they are held to the 
same standards as any other developed 
country. They shouldn’t get a free 
pass. We cannot allow China to walk 
all over us. 
I also want to address what was said 
by my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle about criticism of this bill. 
Two days ago, Democrats suggested 
that criticism of this legislation is 
‘‘Asian bashing’’ and ‘‘xenophobic.’’ 
What nonsense. 
Let me be clear: I will never back 
down from calling out the CCP on their 
transparency and to be responsible. We 
should all be on the side of free speech, 
democracy, and human rights. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise to oppose Representa-
tive STEEL’s amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is recognized for 5 minutes. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Representative STEEL and I share a 
lot of the same concerns about China,

in fact: its human rights record; unfair 
competition; its aggression in the 
South China Sea, for example; its trou-
blesome Belt and Road Initiative. How-
ever, this amendment misstates how 
global climate negotiations work. 
The United Nations climate negotia-
tions are designed to have countries 
submit their own nationally deter-
mined climate mitigation goals. They 
are designed this way to ensure that no 
one can tell America what our climate 
policies should be. I would think that 
my Republican colleagues would under-
stand and support that. 
We should be doing everything we 
can to pressure each country, particu-
larly China, which is the world’s larg-
est emitter of greenhouse gasses, as the 
Representative mentioned, to upgrade 
its commitments and commit to more 
ambitious nationally determined con-
tributions. 
The Biden administration and the 
Special Presidential Envoy for Cli-
mate, Secretary John Kerry, have been 
clear that the People’s Republic of 
China must make stronger commit-
ments to cutting its carbon emissions. 
The Government of China has said 
that they are targeting carbon neu-
trality before 2060. Well, that is clearly 
too late. The world needs to reach net 
zero by 2050 at the latest. 
I completely agree that the United 
States must put pressure on China to 
reach net zero at a faster pace, but ar-
bitrarily tying it to our timeline isn’t 
the way to do that. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, Con-
gresswoman STEEL, for offering her 
commonsense amendment. 
China is the world’s leading producer 
of carbon emissions. For years, China 
has been one of the largest emitters of 
carbon dioxide in the world. In 2019, 
China emitted 10.1 billion metric tons 
of carbon dioxide, almost twice as 
much as the U.S., representing nearly 
28 percent of global emissions. 
For years, the U.S. has set ambitious 
goals to cut down our carbon emis-
sions. Meanwhile, China stated their 
annual CO2 emissions are expected to 
continue to grow and will not peak 
until 2030. 
The Steel amendment would make it 
the official policy of the U.S. to require 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party 
to 
match emission-cutting standards es-
tablished by the U.S. This amendment 
is so simple and easy to support, I can-
not think of a reason it would be op-
posed. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
shown us countless times that we can-
not trust them on their word alone. We 
need formal commitments from Bei-
jing, and action must be taken. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. BALDERSON). 
Mr. BALDERSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the amendment of-
fered by Representative STEEL. 
This amendment is simple. It de-
mands that China, the world’s worst 
producer of greenhouse gas emissions, 
meets the same emissions standards 
that are imposed on the United States. 
CO2 emissions in the United States 
have steadily declined since 2010 and 
drastically decreased during the pan-
demic. In 2020, China somehow man-
aged to increase their emissions. Mean-
while, nearly every other country re-
duced theirs. 
If my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle want to be serious about the 
climate, let’s start by creating a level 
playing field for U.S. businesses to 
compete and require the world’s largest 
polluter, China, to step up to the plate. 
Mr. 
CASTRO 
of 
Texas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Again, we agree that the United 
States should do everything possible to 
put pressure on China to reduce emis-
sions and to combat climate change. 
However, this is a bad way to do it. 
We can treat the climate challenge 
as an opportunity for America to shine, 
to rise to the occasion and show the 
world that they can rely on us, and 
that includes pressuring other nations 
to also combat climate change. 
Whether my colleagues across the 
aisle acknowledge it or not, the world 
is transitioning to renewable energy 
and electric vehicles. 
The choice we face is whether our 
Nation leads in this century as we did 
in the last, or whether we allow others 
to lead instead. 
My home State of Texas recognizes 
this. We may be the fossil fuel capital 
of the United States, and have been for 
a long time, but we are also the wind 
energy capital of the United States. 
The task ahead of us is to pressure 
and verify to ensure China meets its 
goals. We need to do that bilaterally, 
and we need to hold China accountable 
in multilateral forums. This amend-
ment only distracts from that impor-
tant task, and I urge my colleagues to 
oppose it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. If the Federal Government is 
going to establish these standards, 
they cannot allow the CCP to ignore 
all their responsibilities. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-

gram at an eligible institution of higher edu-
cation on less than a full-time basis.

may for the same payment period receive 
both a job training Federal Pell Grant under 
this subsection and a Federal Pell Grant 
under this section.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN) and 
a Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
I would like to begin by thanking 
Chair EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON for her 
leadership on H.R. 4521, the America 
COMPETES Act, and the many chairs 
across the House for their work to 
bring this bill to the floor. 
Our economy is only as strong as the 
next generation of American workers. 
The key to ensuring that our young 
people transition seamlessly into good- 
paying careers is to make sure that 
high-quality education and job training 
is affordable and accessible to all. 
It is also important that students 
have access to important information 
about programs or institutions they 
may want to attend to ensure they can 
make smart, informed decisions after 
high school. 
That is why I am proud to offer an 
amendment 
to 
the 
America 
COM-
PETES Act with my colleagues AN-
THONY
GONZALEZ
and 
RAJA 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
The first part of this amendment is 
modeled after my Jumpstart Our Busi-
nesses by Supporting Students Act, or 
the JOBS Act, with Senators KAINE 
and PORTMAN and Congressman GON-
ZALEZ, to expand Pell grant eligibility 
to 
certain 
high-quality, 
short-term 
programs that can launch graduates 
into successful careers while also giv-
ing them paths to 2- and 4-year de-
grees. 
This amendment also includes the 
College Transparency Act led by Con-
gressman KRISHNAMOORTHI, which es-
tablishes a secure, privacy-protected 
postsecondary data system to collect 
and report student outcomes. 
Both these initiatives are critical as 
we seek to rebuild the middle class and 
ensure workers have the skills needed 
to pursue in-demand, good-paying jobs. 
I close by urging my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the amendment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
want more transparency and account-
ability in postsecondary education, but 
that is not what this amendment ac-
complishes. 
This amendment is a Trojan horse for 
violating privacy rights of students 
through colleges and universities. 
Many of my colleagues who support 
this amendment are not completely in-
formed or have not thought through 
the implications of some of its provi-
sions. 
This amendment would direct the 
Federal Government to create a data 
system that tracks every college stu-
dent in America through their adult 
lives without their consent and with-
out giving them the ability to opt out. 
This sounds more like a scheme the 
Chinese Communist Party would man-
ufacture than a bipartisan amendment 
to a bill meant to combat Chinese in-
fluence. 
b 0930 
Don’t be fooled. This amendment 
might use words like ‘‘security,’’ but in 
reality, it puts the privacy of Ameri-
cans at risk. 
Some of these Federal agencies have 
already been hacked by Russian intel-
ligence and fraudsters. Who is to say it 
won’t happen again? 
I don’t trust foxes in my henhouse, 
and I surely don’t trust Washington bu-
reaucrats with a database of the per-
sonal and private information of my 
children and grandchildren, or yours. 
And what will the Biden administra-
tion do with the tax records, Social Se-
curity information, and the private 
data of Americans? The answer is sim-
ply, exert more control. 
This amendment isn’t about trans-
parency or accountability, but about 
giving 
Washington 
bureaucrats 
the 
ability to choose winners and losers 
among institutions of postsecondary 
education. For example, the Pell grant 
provisions herd Americans looking for 
alternative career pathways into the 
same colleges and universities that 
failed them in the first place while 
blocking them from pursuing programs 
offered by career-focused schools sim-
ply based on their tax status—even if 
these institutions can meet the 11 
pages of arbitrary and prescriptive 
guardrails the amendment puts in 
place. 
This amendment does nothing to im-
prove our broken system of postsec-
ondary education. Instead, it exacer-
bates our skills gap and labor shortage 
and forces Americans to concede their 
privacy to an administration that 
looks more and more like the authori-
tarian regime we are supposedly trying 
to combat. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), the 
chairman of the House Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, this amendment would sig-
nificantly strengthen how the America 
COMPETES Act will work by improv-
ing access to affordable high-quality 
higher education. 
First, the amendment includes the 
JOBS Act, which expands how individ-
uals can use the Pell grant, using the 
short-term programs enabling them to 
get good jobs quickly and retrain for 
better paying jobs while we recover 
from the pandemic. 
It also includes the College Trans-
parency Act, which has helped the De-
partment of Education address long-
standing racial and socioeconomic in-
equities in higher education and track 
the quality of programs. Importantly, 
the amendment ensures that we con-
tinue to protect the privacy of stu-
dents’ personal information. 
These proposals have strong bipar-
tisan support, and I urge my colleagues 
to support this amendment and the un-
derlying legislation. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. KELLER). 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Ranking Member FOXX for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to amendment No. 260 which excludes 
certain educational institutions from 
participating in Federal Pell Grant 
Programs. It is absurd to prevent stu-
dents from seeking an education, a 
quality education from the institution 
of their choice simply because that in-
stitution pays taxes. Get that. They 
pay taxes and people can’t go to college 
there. 
Meaningful education reform must 
establish a level playing field and give 
students more choice in how financial 
aid is used. A 4-year degree from a pub-
lic college is not for everyone. The 
question to closing the skills gap and 
solving the labor shortage is rewarding 
institutions that demonstrate success 
and allow students to determine their 
own futures. 
Instead of limiting their choices, my 
legislation, the CHOICE Act, would 
allow students in short-term occupa-
tional programs to utilize financial aid

for 
workforce 
readiness 
programs, 
which are needed now more than ever. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman for yielding, and I urge my col-
leagues to oppose amendment No. 260. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ), my 
partner. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of our 
bipartisan amendment that includes 
both the JOBS Act and the College 
Transparency Act. 
Since I first ran for Congress, the 
number one issue that I hear in my dis-
trict from employers is the lack of 
good quality candidates for good-pay-
ing jobs. From those days, I set out to 
try to find a way to close this skills 
gap and provide more opportunities for 
our local businesses and workforce. 
The JOBS Act does just that. 
The JOBS Act expands Pell grant eli-
gibility to qualified short-term pro-
grams in high-demand jobs. This will 
help Americans access these programs 
and learn critical skills that lead to 
these good-paying jobs. This will be a 
collaborative process with our States 
working with local employers and com-
munity colleges to make sure that only 
quality programs that lead to wage in-
creases qualify to make sure that 
Americans can find jobs after comple-
tion of these programs. 
On my way in this morning, I was ac-
tually speaking to an employer in my 
district, and I ran through the bill with 
him. And I said, what do you think of 
this? Would this help you? And his im-
mediate response was, I have over 15 
truck drivers that I am trying to hire, 
and I can’t find anybody. 
These are the types of programs that 
the JOBS Act will enable. This is why 
I think it is a commonsense—and I am 
thrilled to say—bipartisan component 
of the bill, and I hope that everybody 
will consider supporting it. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Illi-
nois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
In a bill that professes to push back 
on the influence of China’s authori-
tarian regime, this amendment runs 
the risk of putting the personal infor-
mation of every one of America’s col-
lege students in the hands of the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
It will allow the Biden administra-
tion to create a Federal database that 
will track every single student pur-
suing a postsecondary degree without 
their consent or any ability to opt out, 
even if they don’t accept Federal aid. 
The Biden administration will also be 
able to use this data to match with 
other databases across the Federal 
Government with few limits on what 
can be tracked and gathered. 
While the bill claims the data will be 
secure, once the data comes from the 
Federal Government, there are no 
guarantees information will not fall 
into the hands of criminals or our ad-
versaries. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote 
on this Federal database amendment. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Illinois 
(Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI). 
Mr. 
KRISHNAMOORTHI. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of 
amendment 260 and in support of the 
America COMPETES Act. 
My amendment 260 contains the bi-
partisan College Transparency Act, 
which creates an extremely secure pri-
vacy-protected system to finally allow 
students to shop for college and other 
postsecondary educational opportuni-
ties, like community college and trade 
and technical schools. 
Today, unfortunately, the system is 
shrouded in darkness. There is no 
transparency and people can’t shop. 
When students have access to trans-
parent data, they can shop and make 
informed decisions, avoiding excess 
debt and realizing their full potential. 
My colleague and dear friend, Dr. 
Foxx, says that this data will be 
tracked for adults through a person’s 
lifetime. That is wrong. She also says 
that the Biden administration is going 
to treat this data like the Chinese 
Communist Party. That is wrong. 
Madam Speaker, the choice is clear. 
Either choose transparency and allow 
parents and families to finally shop for 
college or keep the status quo, which 
nobody likes. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is sup-
ported by everyone from the American 
Federation of Teachers to the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, and I urge its 
support. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, giving 
this 
same 
administration 
that 
weaponized the Federal Government 
against concerned parents the power to 
collect sensitive information about all 
college students, whether they accept 
financial aid or not is unacceptable. 
I am not surprised that Democrats 
are trying to use this amendment to 
overhaul 
postsecondary 
education 
without holding a single legislative 
hearing or markup. Democrats have a 
track record of bypassing the legisla-
tive process when it suits their ends. 
We must resist the Democrats’ egre-
gious power grab. 
Madam Speaker, this is a moral 
issue. I strongly encourage my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the Levin 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 900, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
The question is on the amendment 
offered by the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 239 OFFERED BY MRS. STEEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the unfin-
ished business is the question on 
amendment No. 239, printed in part D 
of House Report 117–241, on which fur-
ther proceedings were postponed and

AUTHORIZING 
THE 
CLERK 
TO 
MAKE 
CORRECTIONS 
IN 
EN-
GROSSMENT OF H.R. 4521, BIO-
ECONOMY RESEARCH AND DE-
VELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that, in the en-
grossment of H.R. 4521, the Clerk be au-
thorized to correct section numbers, 
punctuation, spelling, and cross-ref-
erences, and to make such other tech-
nical and conforming changes as may 
be necessary to reflect the actions of 
the House. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TAKANO). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from Michi-
gan? 
There was no objection. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
for the purpose of inquiring of the ma-
jority whip the schedule for next week. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. CLY-
BURN), my friend, the House majority 
whip. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and I 
appreciate him letting me stand in 
today for the majority leader. I have 
talked to the majority leader this 
week, and I understand he is doing very 
well, and I hope that he will rejoin you 
at this desk next week. 
Madam Speaker, before I go to the 
schedule, I also thank the gentleman 
for joining me yesterday for an historic 
occasion, the dedication of H–150 on the 
first floor of this building, which hap-
pens to be part of his office. That build-
ing has been designated the Joseph H. 
Rainey Room. 
As you know, Rainey was elected to 
the United States Congress from South 
Carolina this past December 12, 150 
years ago. None of us really realized it 
at the time but H–150, now a part of the 
Republican whip’s office, was an Indian 
Affairs room back when Rainey was 
here. And Rainey was on that com-
mittee, so it is fitting and proper for 
that room to carry his name. I thank 
the gentleman for being so kind yester-
day and being part of that. 
b 1130 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, it 
was a special day for all of us that were 
there, not just to celebrate Joseph 
Rainey, but to have the Rainey family. 
You had direct descendants of Joseph 
Rainey, his great-granddaughter was 
there, as well as other relatives of Jo-
seph Rainey to celebrate, especially 
during Black History Month, the first 
African American ever elected to the 
United States Congress, and to learn 
more about his history. 
Someone who was born into slavery— 
something we talked about—only in 
America can someone born into slavery 
just a few years after the end of slavery 
be elected to the United States Con-
gress and come up here and fight for 
equality. He had a great record for al-
most 10 years serving in Congress from 
the great State of South Carolina. 
Now there is a room, the Joseph 
Rainey room, H–150, named after him. 
It was a truly special day, especially to 
have direct descendants of Joseph 
Rainey come to participate in that 
ceremony. I am happy to yield to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, as 
the gentleman occupies one of the of-
fices that he served in, I am proud to 
now be representing many of the com-
munities that he represented here in 
this body. Thank you so much. 
Now, for the schedule for next week. 
On Monday, the House will meet at 12 
p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for 
legislative business, with votes post-
poned until 6:30 p.m. On Tuesday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning 
hour and 12 p.m. for legislative busi-
ness. On Wednesday, the House will 
meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. 
The House will consider H.R. 4445, the 
Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual 
Assault and Sexual Harassment Act, 
introduced by Representative CHERI 
BUSTOS, which would end forced arbi-
tration in cases relating to sexual as-
sault and harassment, providing sur-
vivors with legal recourse to seek jus-
tice in court against their assailants. 
The House will also consider H.R. 
3485, the Global Respect Act, intro-
duced 
by 
Representative 
DAVID 
CICILLINE, which furthers our Nation’s 
commitment to LGBTQ rights around 
the world by sanctioning foreign indi-
viduals found to be complicit in vio-
lating the human rights of LGBTQ peo-
ple. 
Additionally, the House will consider 
Representative 
CAROLYN
MALONEY’s 
bill, H.R. 3076, the Postal Service Re-
form Act. This bipartisan bill would 
strengthen the financial position of the 
United States Postal Service and en-
sure it continues to successfully carry 
out its mandate to the deliver mail to 
every household and business in the 
country. 
Lastly, the House stands ready to act 
on the Build Back Better Act, as well 
as the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis 
Act, should the Senate amend them. Of 
course, we will act on appropriations, 
hopefully on an omnibus bill, but we 
will not allow the government to shut 
down. 
Additional items may be possible in 
our view. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, as it 
relates to the funding of government, 
February 18 is the current date of expi-
ration for government funding. As the 
gentleman knows, we are not scheduled 
to be in that week, so next week would 
be the last week that the House is 
scheduled to be in session prior to that 
date. 
We haven’t seen any agreement on a 
broader, long-term package. There has 
been some talk—we have been hearing 
there may be a short term CR brought 
forward next week. 
Does the gentleman know if there is 
any anticipation of a continuing reso-
lution to be brought forward next 
week, and if so, is there a length of 
time that is being anticipated if that 
legislation were to come forward next 
week? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, yes, 
we have heard all of those discussions. 
We are hopeful that something will 
come forward next week in the form of 
an omnibus, but if not, we will respond 
appropriately when we get to that 
point. 
Mr. SCALISE. So we will determine 
whether or not that happens. If there is 
a date that the gentleman is aware of 
if there would be a short term—we 
would be interested in seeing that. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
am not aware of a date, but I would 
hope that if we do not get an omnibus 
there will be a short term CR because 
as the gentleman knows that getting 
the omnibus is very, very important to 
our constituents back home so that 
people can plan their lives sufficiently. 
We both are very concerned about the 
effectiveness of our representation of 
our constituents. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, hope-
fully those negotiations can escalate. 
As it relates to a few weeks from now, 
the State of the Union that was an-
nounced will be March 1, where Presi-
dent Biden will come here to this 
Chamber to give his annual State of 
the Union.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H964 
February 4, 2022 
We know last year’s State of the 
Union was a very different look in 
terms of a limited House Chamber. 
Does the gentleman know the protocols 
that are being planned for this year’s 
State of the Union? 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
know that the Speaker is in consulta-
tion with the attending physician on 
what the protocol for this year might 
be. In the weeks ahead as we approach 
the date, the attending physician will 
make recommendations based on the 
current state of the pandemic. 
I think, as all of us are very pleased 
with what we are hearing about the 
pandemic, it is moving in a very favor-
able direction, and I am sure the at-
tending physician will take all of that 
into account when he establishes the 
protocol for the State of the Union ad-
dress. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, as we 
talk about the broader issues relating 
to opening things back up, hopefully 
we can get the House fully operating 
again, ending proxy voting, getting 
committees to meet in person again be-
cause across the country you are see-
ing more States open, more commu-
nities and businesses open. 
If you just look this past weekend, 
you had red States, blue States—in 
California you had the NFC Champion-
ship Game, over 73,000 people were in 
SoFi Stadium to watch that game. 
From all the footage you saw, very few 
people had masks on. You didn’t hear 
of incidents, but you saw in the State 
of California 73,000 people gathered to-
gether. In Missouri, for the AFC Cham-
pionship Game, again, over 73,000 peo-
ple watching that game. 
For those of us from LSU, as the gen-
tleman knows real well, we are excited 
by 
Joe 
Burrow, 
Ja’Marr 
Chase, 
Shelvin, and other LSU Tigers going to 
the Super Bowl for the Bengals. To see 
that many people—and we would un-
derstand for the Super Bowl there will 
be over 73,000 people there as well. 
Is there any reason why science 
changes in California or Missouri, and 
when you get to D.C. why we can’t 
have a full House Chamber here? We 
have been hearing we might only get 25 
tickets in a Chamber that typically 
holds over 500 for a State of the Union. 
There is clearly no science that has 
come against what we saw in those sta-
diums with over 73,000 people. We 
would sure encourage that we open up 
the House Chamber, not to just the 
State of the Union but to voting in 
general, to getting the House func-
tioning again, to show the rest of the 
country that is already getting there 
themselves that we should and can 
open back up again. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I, 
like the gentleman, witnessed those 
games over the weekend. I don’t know 
why you want to remind me of the last 
time you and I shared a stadium with 
Joe Burrow, but I do want you to know 
that I was pulling for him over the 
weekend. 
That 
is 
tough 
for 
this 
Clemson guy to do. 
I enjoyed those games. I am sure that 
all the people who attended them en-
joyed those games. Now, what I am 
sure the attending physician will be 
taking into account is he will probably 
get the reports from the aftermath of 
those games and will be guided by that. 
I am sure that if the day or two fol-
lowing the games everybody was well, 
he will take that into account. He will 
look and see how people faired the next 
day and the day after that to establish 
the protocol, and I am perfectly willing 
to wait to hear from him. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, as we 
have seen some more reports coming 
out, Johns Hopkins just came out with 
new reports that talk about, frankly, 
the detriments of shutting down. When 
you look at schools, especially, there is 
a lot of science that shows that kids 
that are in the classroom are not only 
learning 
better 
but 
having 
better 
health outcomes than in those schools 
that are shut down, where theoreti-
cally they are sitting alone by them-
selves which, as we know, that is not 
what is happening. You know, in a con-
trolled environment it is actually bet-
ter for those students than you are see-
ing in other environments. 
If you are only looking at a silo of 
cases at a stadium, but you are not 
looking at cases that are going up in 
places that are shut down, you have 
got to look at the whole picture. I 
think too often some people have only 
cherry-picked data, and it has been at 
the detriment of the overall picture. 
So the science ought to be clear and 
vivid in its description of what really is 
happening out there across the country 
in States that are fully open, in States 
that are more shut down. Again, red 
State, blue State, last weekend was a 
really good example that you can open 
things up again. 
People are making choices. People 
know what is out there. Whether they 
are home alone, theoretically, they are 
still getting COVID in those places 
where things are shut down. So we 
would sure hope that the science would 
not just look at a silo but would look 
at the whole picture. Other scientists 
have done scientific studies like the 
Johns Hopkins report that just came 
out yesterday, they show there is a big-
ger picture. 
We are hearing reports that there 
would be a limited number of tickets 
available. Maybe that is premature, 
but if the gentleman is saying that you 
are waiting on the doctor to make 
those recommendations, then maybe 
the number we were given a few days 
ago of 25 limitation is a premature 
number. Hopefully that opens up. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, you 
are absolutely correct, I agree with 
you. The number that was announced 
previously was based upon the situa-
tion as it stood at that moment. I sus-
pect that if things change dramatically 
in the next week or two or three that 
number may go down, everything else 
may get back close to normal. 
I come from a pretty red State and 
the reviews are pretty mixed as it re-
lates to even school children. Some 
schools are doing well, other schools 
aren’t. It is not just what State you 
may be from, but a lot depends on what 
community that you live in. 
We have a community here that we 
all enjoy living and working in. I am 
sure that the attending physician will 
take into account things that exist in 
and around this community in making 
his decision as to how we should con-
duct ourselves during the State of the 
Union. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, is 
there an expected date when that pro-
tocol will be released? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. CLYBURN. No, I don’t have any 
idea and have not been informed as to 
what date that decision will be made. I 
am sure it will be made and we will be 
given enough time for us to conduct 
ourselves accordingly. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I am 
glad to hear the gentleman’s update as 
well on the majority leader’s health. 
We miss him here and look forward to 
seeing him back here. He has left 
things in very good hands with the ma-
jority whip, but we also look forward 
to the day when he returns, hopefully 
next week, and that is encouraging 
news to hear as well. 
Madam Speaker, unless the gen-
tleman has anything else, I am pre-
pared to yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I 
have nothing else. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time.

REMEMBERING ROSA PARKS ON 
HER BIRTHDAY 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I stand 
here today at the beginning of Black 
History Month to honor the mother of 
the civil rights movement and beloved 
resident of 13 District Strong, Mother 
Rosa Parks, on her birthday. 
Today, with the help of her family, 
we introduced a bill to name a United 
States Post Office near her home in 
honor of this amazing and incredible 
civil rights leader. 
The progress made by those incred-
ible leaders who came before us, like 
Mother Rosa Parks, Dr. King, Malcolm 
X, Fred Hampton, and so many more, 
is under extreme threat. While some in 
our body right here choose to ban 
books and desperately try to return to 
the days of Jim Crow, I am proud to 
stand here for the radical love and 
beautiful strength embodied in leaders

like Mother Rosa Louise McCauley 
Parks. 
We know our struggle against racism 
is a lifelong pursuit. As Mother Parks 
wrote: ‘‘Freedom fighters never re-
tire.’’ 
Her memory continues to guide us. 
I will add that freedom fighters never 
die. 
I am honored to have the opportunity 
to lead this effort, and I am proud to 
have the opportunity to serve the in-
credible people of the 13 District 
Strong in our fight for equity and jus-
tice. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this effort.

CELEBRATING LUNAR NEW YEAR 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Madam Speaker, this 
week, we welcomed the Year of the 
Tiger with the first day of Lunar New 
Year. 
Lunar New Year is an important hol-
iday celebrated by many East and 
Southeast Asian countries. It is also 
celebrated widely by many Asian- 
American communities here in the 
United States, including our Orange 
County community in California. 
As we reflect on our blessings this 
new year, I am grateful for the oppor-
tunity to be a voice for our Asian- 
American community in Congress. 
Madam Speaker, 2022 is the Year of 
the Tiger, which symbolizes courage 
and bravery. 
With the new year comes a new be-
ginning and the hope of better days 
ahead. I hope that this year brings ev-
eryone strength, prosperity, and happi-
ness. 
(English translation of the statement 
made 
in 
Korean,

namese, and Japanese is as follows:) 
‘‘Happy new year.’’

f 
PRIORITIZING EL PASO, TEXAS 
(Ms. ESCOBAR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
have the honor of representing El Paso, 
Texas, a critical hub for commerce and 
trade with one of the busiest land ports 
of entry in the country. 
Today, I am proud to have voted for 
the passage of the America COMPETES 
Act to strengthen supply chains, U.S. 
competitiveness, and create good-pay-
ing STEM jobs at home. It will build on 
policies championed by congressional 
Democrats and President Biden that 
have led to a historic year of job cre-
ation, as shown in today’s jobs report. 
The bill includes my amendments to 
address many El Paso priorities on 
local job creation, addressing the cli-
mate crisis, and optimizing our ports of 
entry. 
One of my amendments creates a 
mandatory set-aside specifically for 
small businesses, the backbone of our 
local economy, to move into the solar 
component manufacturing sector. 
Additionally, I included amendments 
that respond to the climate crisis by 
ensuring that we reduce deforestation 
and carbon dioxide emissions in devel-
oping nations and allow environmental 
defenders to assist in developing our 
climate-resilient strategy. 
My amendments also address the 
needs of our ports of entry, El Paso’s 
major artery for trade and commerce. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to have 
also addressed inflation. 
f 
PENALIZING NUCLEAR FAMILIES 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as 
we go on recess for a couple of days, I 
want to call, one more time, attention 
to Robert Rector’s article in The Herit-
age Foundation talking about the one 
group in America that is genuinely dis-
criminated against: the hardworking 
middle class with a nuclear family 
with a dad. 
As Rector points out, changes made 
in the Build Back Better Act, particu-
larly a lot more money for low-income 
housing, will create up to a $14,000 pen-
alty that nuclear families will face 
when the husband and wife get married 
as opposed to a single family. 
This is true, and this does not in-
clude other things such as, for exam-
ple, Pell grants. I know the Democrat 
Party wants to give free college to ille-
gal immigrants, whereas if you are a 
child with a mom and dad at home 
working, Madam Speaker, you have to 
go deeply in debt. 
I strongly want people in this insti-
tution to focus on the nuclear family, a 
sizeable segment of the population, and 
stop discriminating against them. Give 
them the same things that the more fa-
vored classes get. 
f 
REMEMBERING LULAMAE 
CLEMONS 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to remember Lulamae Clemons, 
a champion for social justice and a 
longtime Riverside community activ-
ist. 
I knew Lulamae in the 1980s when I 
was getting involved in the Greater 
Riverside Urban League. To this day, I 
remember her graceful yet determined 
presence and her efforts to advance ra-
cial equality in our community. 
Lulamae was a true pioneer. She de-
voted herself to her community and 
was persistent in her fight for quality 
education and fairer housing. 
As the first Black administrator 
hired by the Riverside Office of Edu-
cation and vice president of the Fair 
Housing Council of Riverside County, 
Lulamae empowered minorities and 
broke barriers. 
Lulamae understood the preciousness 
of civil rights, equality, and oppor-
tunity for all. 
To the family of Lulamae Clemons 
and all those who knew, loved, and re-
spected her, I offer my deepest condo-
lences. Her legacy will continue to live 
on.

HONORING 
TYLER 
BALDWIN, 
A 
WEST 
VIRGINIAN 
HOMETOWN 
HERO 
(Mr. MOONEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MOONEY. Madam Speaker, I 
stand before you to share a story of 
West Virginia’s Second Congressional 
District’s own hometown hero, Tyler 
Baldwin. 
Tyler Baldwin is a 17-year-old young 
man from Newville, West Virginia, who 
risked his own life to rush into his 
neighbor’s burning home. 
On the morning of November 29, 2021, 
Tyler was going through his daily rou-
tine of getting ready for school, and he 
noticed his neighbor’s house was on 
fire. 
He knew his neighbor had mobility 
issues. 
Without 
hesitation, 
Tyler 
sprinted into the blaze and smoke and 
helped his neighbor escape. Tyler was 
treated for minor injuries, and the 
homeowner was shaken up but okay. 
It is an honor for my staff and me to 
present Tyler with a formal letter of 
gratitude and a Congressional Certifi-
cate of Recognition at a ceremony put 
together by his school. I want to thank 
him for selflessly putting others first 
and congratulate him on being an up-
standing citizen in his community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MS. EVA WILLIAMS 
(Ms. PRESSLEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life and legacy 
of a distinguished community member 
of the Massachusetts Seventh, Ms. Eva 
Williams. 
Born and raised in Boston, Ms. Wil-
liams learned the value of hard work 
and determination at an early age. She 
embodied resilience and a love for her 
family and community, and she never 
let the challenges of life prevent her 
from following her own dreams. 
Ms. Williams worked over 20 years as 
a bus operator for the MBTA. After re-
tiring, she enjoyed spending more time 
with her children and grandchildren.

With a heart for traveling and love 
for interior decorating, Ms. Williams 
was the kind of person anyone would 
want to spend time with. She was a 
caring mother and loving grandmother, 
and her transition is a deep and pro-
found loss for her family and our com-
munity. 
Ms. Williams will be truly missed. 
May she rest in peace and power. 
f 
INVESTING IN COMMUNITIES 
(Mr. KILMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KILMER. Madam Speaker, the 
America COMPETES Act is about cre-
ating jobs and spurring innovation all 
across our country. It is about recog-
nizing that America can’t compete if it 
leaves communities behind and that we 
need to get all of our best players on 
the field if we are going to win eco-
nomically. 
Today’s bill includes a pilot version 
of my RECOMPETE Act, which would 
provide some flexible, long-term sup-
port to empower communities that 
have struggled so that they can grow 
jobs and strengthen their economies. 
For some communities, that may mean 
investments in workforce development; 
for others, broadband; for some, sup-
port for entrepreneurs. 
I grew up on the Olympic Peninsula 
of Washington State, and now I am 
proud to represent it. We have amazing 
assets and outstanding people, but 
there is a real concern in some commu-
nities that their town’s main export 
may be young people, as prospects for 
the future often seem brighter some-
place else. 
But with today’s vote, we are saying 
that we don’t believe in leaving com-
munities behind. We are saying that 
people should have economic oppor-
tunity regardless of what ZIP Code 
they live in, and we are saying that we 
can’t wait. 
f 
RECHARGING IN LAS VEGAS 
(Ms. TITUS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TITUS. Madam Speaker, a recent 
United Nations report confirmed that 
climate change represents nothing less 
than a code red for humanity. 
We know the largest contributor to 
emissions is transportation, and that is 
why efforts to decarbonize this sector 
are so important if we are serious 
about fighting climate change. 
Modernizing our transportation sec-
tor and moving toward a clean energy 
future means building electric vehicle 
infrastructure, something that the new 
law does with the first-ever Federal in-
vestments in a national EV charging 
network. 
In Nevada, this will bring over $38 
million to build EV stations through-
out the State, helping us to have a 
higher percentage of electric vehicles 
on the road, reduce our emissions, and 
address climate change. 
People often come to Las Vegas to 
recharge, and now, thanks to the infra-
structure law, they will be able to do it 
in other ways and in other places. 
f 
RECOGNIZING HOPE THAT BINDS 
(Mr. COMER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. COMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Hope That Binds, a min-
istry based out of Cunningham, Ken-
tucky, that supports west Kentucky 
families by providing critical adoption 
resources. 
Hope That Binds is an outstanding 
regional leader when it comes to help-
ing families pursuing adoption through 
financial assistance and counseling. 
I am proud of my constituents, 
Wendy Davis-Wilson, Jeff and Benita 
Davis, Brooke Kelly, and Gracie Rey-
nolds, for their significant contribu-
tions to this great organization. 
Adoption provides a home for needy 
children as well as an opportunity to 
raise a child for hopeful parents. Be-
longing to a family is a natural and 
vital component of life, and every child 
deserves a loving and nurturing home. 
Hope That Binds’ commitment to the 
gift and treasure of adoption is heart-
warming and a great example of giving 
back to the less vulnerable. 
February 7 to 11 is a week of celebra-
tion and awareness for this wonderful 
nonprofit, and I am proud to recognize 
them for their incredible work. On be-
half of my constituents, I congratulate 
Hope That Binds for supporting some 
of the most vulnerable members of our 
society.

ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). Under the Speak-
er’s announced policy of January 4, 
2021, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
before we begin, I actually want to 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. CALVERT). 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TRISTAN KROGIUS 
Mr. CALVERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to honor Tris-
tan Krogius, father of our former 
House colleague, Mimi Walters. 
Tris passed away peacefully on De-
cember 30, 2021. He was born in 
Tammerfors, Finland, and emigrated to 
New York with his family in 1939 as a 
refugee from the Russian invasion of 
Finland. 
Tris attended the University of New 
Mexico on an NROTC scholarship and 
served as a marine officer from 1954 to 
1960. In 1952, he and the love of his life, 
Barbara Brophy, eloped. After Tris left 
the Marine Corps, he began a business 
career in California. 
Tris rose to become president of 
Hunt-Wesson, Frozen and Refrigerated 
Foods, and later president of Dalgety 
Limited’s U.S. food division. In 1987, he 
retired as president and CEO of Ten-
neco West and, after retiring, Tris 
earned a law degree in 1990 and was ad-
mitted to the California bar. 
Tris was an active member of his 
community. He was past board presi-
dent and CEO of the South Coast Med-
ical Center in Laguna Beach and was a 
director of many nonprofit organiza-
tions. 
Tris is survived by his wife of 69 
years, Barbara; their six children and 
their spouses; 19 grandchildren; and 
four great grandchildren. 
Tris will be remembered for the ex-
traordinary example that he set for his 
life. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
we all get behind these microphones on 
occasion and we want to share some-
thing. And tonight, I am going to try 
to stay on a theme. I am going to try 
to walk through one of my intense 
frustrations around here that we keep 
making public policy. 
Let’s be honest. We just passed—the 
Democrats, I don’t think a single Re-
publican voted for it—a $350 billion bill 
that originally was labeled as America 
COMPETES Act. But if you look at the 
math in it and the spending in it, it is 
functionally, hey, let’s give lots of 
money to our special interests who ac-
tually support them politically. 
So here’s the theme. If I came to any 
Member of Congress, any one of our 
staff, anyone out there listening in the 
public and said, What makes people 
poor? 
Seriously. 
What 
makes 
our 
brothers and sisters who are working 
poor poor? 
And you get these discussions, Oh, we 
don’t tax rich people enough and trans-
fer their wealth, or we don’t do this, or 
we don’t do that. And it turns out, 
when you actually look at the math, 
almost none of those things are actu-
ally true. 
It is complicated. So we have been 
doing a project for almost a year in our 
office, of trying to understand what is 
different. So we held a hearing re-
cently, on health disparities. Guess 
what? 
There really are health disparities 
between certain urban minority popu-
lations, my Tribal communities in the 
Southwest. But why? 
Also, take a look. There is crime, 
crime 
differential. 
When 
someone 
steals your stuff or breaks your bones, 
you’re not able to go to work, you’re 
not able to accumulate. 
You actually start to look at all 
these things that are societal factors. 
You open up the border, you are com-
peting against others with similar skill 
sets, labor sets. 
And my argument is, over this last 12 
months of unified leftist, unified Dem-
ocrat control of government, we are 
just crushing people. We are crushing

February 4, 2022 
the working poor. We are crushing the 
middle class. And the data—I am going 
to prove it. 
But one of the most interesting 
things we have been looking at—and 
we have actually taken some ridicule 
for fixating on this, but the math is the 
math. 
I would typically start these presen-
tations with take a look at the accu-
mulation of U.S. sovereign debt. It is 
exploding. Twenty-nine years, $12 tril-
lion, and that is based on last year’s 
CBO math. It is Social Security and 
Medicare, primarily Medicare. But 31 
percent of Medicare spending and bor-
rowing is just diabetes. 
But also, that other project we have 
been doing of what makes certain pop-
ulations poor. Well, it turns out our 
brothers and sisters who are often 
working poor or just trying to survive, 
have dramatically higher health prob-
lems, and it is primarily diabetes. In 
rural poverty, in my Tribal poverty, in 
my urban poverty, look at the diabetic 
numbers. 
So wouldn’t the most compassionate 
thing be to not do what the left keeps 
saying, we are going to build more clin-
ics, help people live with their misery. 
But how about doing something revolu-
tionary? How about curing, how about 
investing in curing our brothers and 
sisters who suffer? 
And we are working, and it is hard, 
and it is difficult math. But what 
would happen if you got a cure to in-
come inequality? Well, then you would 
have to eventually adjust for crime and 
open borders and all the other things 
that we are going to talk about. 
And we have taken some ridicule say-
ing, well, type 1, type 2 diabetes, you 
can’t—well, it turns out we have been 
tracking the science. And there was a 
time we used to have this constant de-
bate here where Democrats would ac-
cuse Republicans of not following the 
science. And we are obviously, particu-
larly with COVID, accusing the Demo-
crats. 
But does anyone here actually have 
an alert on their search engines to 
track the news stories of some of the 
really amazing stuff happening? 
So this is a story, functionally, from 
yesterday, and it is a unique approach. 
They are functionally doing a CRISPR- 
altered stem cell. And the beauty of 
that is, what happens if I can get your 
body to start producing insulin again? 
And because we know type 1 diabetes, 
and part of type 2, is an autoimmune 
reaction. Your body is killing the cells 
that produce insulin. And so with that 
little bit of CRISPR technology, your 
body doesn’t recognize it, and doesn’t 
kill the very cell that is producing the 
ability to take on your glucose. It has 
begun. It has actually moved into type 
1. 
So think of this. We just spent $350 
billion—well, at least the Democrats 
are trying to—and something like this, 
if you had done a version of Operation 
Warp Speed or call it whatever you 
want if that is too Trumpian for the 
left. 
But the single biggest driver of U.S. 
debt is diabetes; 33 percent of all 
healthcare spending; 31 percent of 
Medicare spending. You would think 
this place would be almost giddy. 
Now, maybe it doesn’t work maybe, 
ultimately. But the ability to say, we 
are going to do something that is 
noble, compassionate, loving, and cure 
the misery instead of keeping popu-
lations sort of trapped in their misery 
because they are beholden to one polit-
ical party’s largesse. 
It is beginning. This is the type of 
disruption—this is symbolic of the type 
of disruption that makes the country 
wealthier, more prosperous, and mini-
mizes misery. And we have been talk-
ing about this technology coming for 
about a year. Why are we not doing 
more investing in it? 
So the White House has an initiative. 
Wonderful, but they need to redesign— 
and the same thing here in the House— 
we need to redesign where the re-
sources of primary research, or the in-
centive to bring a product to market, 
or the timing it takes to make it 
through the math of a phase one, phase 
two, phase three. 
We do it the wrong way. Just as the 
Democrats’ bill they just passed where 
it is command and control, it is almost 
a 5-year plan. The Federal Government 
will decide who gets a grant, who 
doesn’t get a grant. You now have to 
come be really nice to the administra-
tion and your Member of Congress if 
you want money for your business. 
The arrogance of this place. One of 
the hazards of Members of Congress—it 
is like that running joke: What are the 
two times in life you think you know 
everything? When you are 13 years old, 
and the day after you get elected to 
Congress. 
The debate here often sounds like it 
is a decade out of date. But think 
about the board I was just showing. If 
there really is—and it is now in phase 
one trial—an ability to cure type 1 and 
make a dramatic difference in type 2, 
try to understand what that means for 
the financials of the country and the 
world, what that actually means for 
health and misery. 
But also, what it potentially means 
for populations that we talk about con-
stantly, we virtue-signal constantly, 
but we don’t actually do something in 
raising their living standards, raising 
their economics, closing income in-
equality, 
And instead, we are in a body right 
now with unified Democrat control 
where the solution is, send someone a 
check. Well, sending someone a check 
doesn’t end the misery. Disruptive 
technology like this is what cures the 
misery that is what we should be al-
most evangelizing here. And I know 
that is hard. 
So let’s talk about some of the other 
things that make the working class 
poorer, the working poor substantially 
poorer. We saw—and I know there have 
been many Members here who have 
come and talked about inflation, but I 
don’t think we have understood the 
misery it ultimately brings. And it is 
the slow type of misery, because every 
time we go to the grocery store, that 
piece of protein you wanted, or that 
milk, or something else gets a little bit 
more expensive. Your paycheck may 
have gone up, but somehow everything 
you are buying goes up more. 
And we are going to walk through a 
couple of boards here, just showing the 
fact of the matter under Democratic 
unified control of government, our so-
ciety has actually gotten poorer, even 
though 
we 
have 
pumped 
stunning 
amounts of money, of cash into the so-
ciety, and we are going to sort of show 
that. 
So understand, we all saw the num-
ber at the end of the year, 7 percent in-
flation. In my home, I am from the 
Phoenix area, we are approaching 9 
percent, a lot of that is driven by hous-
ing. Imagine what this index did to 
homelessness. 
We are going to see some statistics 
here of the narcotics and other things 
that have been coming across the bor-
der now that we have sort of an open 
border policy from the left. 
And instead, I would like to talk 
about the economics and the misery 
such policies have brought and how it 
all ties together. 
So let’s go back a little more on in-
flation. If you think about inflation, 
how many times have you heard our 
brothers and sisters on the left get be-
hind their microphones and talk about, 
it is increasing inequality? 
So I thought that was the Holy Grail 
here. Close inequality. But yet, their 
policies keep growing it. We are seeing 
some numbers here where there is 
about $3,500 of additional spread of in-
equality, driven by a single year’s 
worth of policies that drove up infla-
tion. 
And the solution from the left is 
well, we are going to send them an-
other check, even though the check is 
actually what substantially drove cre-
ating inflation. 
Remember, basic economics. Remem-
ber your elementary school and your 
high school economics class. What is 
inflation? It is too many dollars chas-
ing too few goods and services. Real 
simple. The real world is actually a lit-
tle more complicated, but that is clas-
sic. 
So you have two things: You can 
keep jacking up interest rates to 
squeeze out liquidity of dollars chasing 
those goods or, or and, or plus, you can 
do the other side, like we did in 1981. 
They raised interest rates. 
But people forget, the first year of 
President Reagan, even with a Demo-
crat Congress, they adopted tax cuts 
and policies to make more stuff. If you 
have lots of dollars out that chasing 
things, you have got a couple of solu-
tions. You could squeeze the dollars 
out of the economy to lower inflation, 
or you can make more stuff, because it 
is too many dollars chasing not enough 
goods.

Okay. Make more stuff. It is a classic 
supply-side solution. Make the tax 
code, the regulatory code, the incen-
tives to make more stuff. 
Instead, we just passed a $350 billion 
bill that functionally puts government 
in charge of grants and control of what 
they want, instead of the information 
part of the market, where resources, 
where the ability to act quickly, we 
should be incentivizing the animal 
spirits to go make more stuff as a way 
to lower this inflation that is crushing 
people. And it is a much more elegant 
way because it creates jobs, it creates 
products. But for some reason, the left 
is almost maniacal in a Keynesian view 
of the world saying, well, do lots of 
stimulus. 
b 1215 
Madam Speaker, they seem unwilling 
to even accept the data produced by 
their side that says they have raised 
the misery of so many Americans. 
Understand that the math at the end 
of the year was pretty simple. Inflation 
went up, and people’s wages went up, 
but there is a gap. The gap keeps grow-
ing, and that gap is the fact you got 
poorer last year. 
This is the one that I am still just 
shocked there is not more discussion 
about. If you see the percentage of 
monthly change in real wages—remem-
ber, you may get your paycheck. Your 
paycheck may go up. If your rent, your 
fuel, your food, everything else in your 
life went up more—you see how many 
months people got poorer. 
If you look at the way we are doing 
policy here, it is the administration 
and my Democratic colleagues’ willing-
ness to continue to spend money at 
just stunning levels in ways that the 
economics say you are going to actu-
ally make people poorer. Planned econ-
omy hasn’t worked particularly well 
anywhere in the world. 
You start to see the data of the gap, 
and we have not tried to present this in 
a mean way. The fact of the matter is, 
the 
Democrat 
policies—remember, 
they took over Congress 3 years ago. 
They now have unified government 
after the last election. The gap be-
tween the wealthy and the poor is 
growing. 
Do you remember 2018 and 2019 and 
the vicious rhetoric that came from 
our brothers and sisters on the left 
after we did tax reform? Yet, in modern 
economic times, it was the greatest 
success we have had in shrinking in-
come inequality. You are going to see 
some boards here where food insecu-
rity, it worked. 
Our brothers and sisters on the lower 
quartiles—and I always hate that term. 
The fact of the matter is, they became 
dramatically less poor. Then when the 
Democrats take power, they abandon 
the very things that were working. 
Their policies, at some point you have 
to admit to everyone, because we are 
feeling and seeing it, you have made 
the rich richer; you have made the poor 
poorer; you have increased the misery. 
Madam Speaker, we all know the 
saying. When something isn’t working, 
stop it. Take a breath. Take a look at 
what was working. It turns out the ide-
ological calcification that is Congress 
now is more important to that dogma 
than what actually works. 
So, we sort of walk through these. I 
know this seems like a lot, but we keep 
trying to make the point over and over 
that the data is factual. It is not just 
information by virtue signaling. The 
data is the data is the data. 
This is my comment from the quar-
tile. So these are our brothers and sis-
ters. We are calling them the lower 20 
percent. Well, how much of their in-
come goes to housing, transportation, 
food? 
Now, you notice these numbers are 
off the chart. That is because they also 
receive subsidies, earned income tax 
credits, other things we do to try to 
make their life less miserable. 
Somewhere along the way, this body 
forgot that if you are poor, I mean 
truly poor, that bottom 20 percent, the 
majority of your income goes to hous-
ing. What did the Democrats accom-
plish this last year? We blew up the 
price of rent. 
There were speeches from a number 
of us from 1 to 2 years ago, saying you 
need to create the safety net. You need 
to create a bottom so the economy 
snaps back, but be careful. When you 
create too much liquidity, government 
spending, you are going to blow up the 
cost of everything for people. It hap-
pened. 
What is the solution? The left now 
talks about doing another stimulus bill 
to make their lives even more miser-
able. 
Maybe it is the arrogance of: These 
folks in the poorer quartiles, they have 
been indoctrinated. They are going to 
vote for the left. So just abuse the crap 
out of them. They are still going to 
vote for you. 
The fact of the matter is, if you look 
at the real data of who votes for the 
Democrats anymore, it is the urban 
elite. That is who finances their cam-
paigns. It is no longer the working men 
and women. They migrated much more 
to the Republican side. 
So maybe what I am seeing is politi-
cally logical, but economically, it is 
brutal. The math is the math. At some 
point behind the math are people who 
are suffering. 
Think about this. You just saw on 
the chart where the lowest couple of 
quartiles spend most of their money 
just trying to do housing. Take a look 
at what we have done to the housing 
prices. This is mostly rent. You know, 
when you are in that bottom third, you 
are a renter. How many people right 
now who are renting we now are re-
sponsible for economic policies, liquid-
ity of cash, where we have blown up 
the cost of housing, blown up the cost 
of rent, that we now will have trapped 
so much of America into being perma-
nent renters for the rest of their lives? 
They are never going to build that sav-
ings account that owning a house is 
and that became part of being able to 
retire and is part of the American 
Dream. 
The math is the math. You look at 
African 
Americans, 
Latino 
popu-
lations, and the amount that has 
moved into struggling just to cover the 
rent, it has blown up dramatically. 
This just doesn’t disappear. You 
don’t wake up tomorrow and say, hey, 
we decided we are going to do economic 
policies, regulatory policies, tax poli-
cies. So we make a lot more stuff. Yes, 
the Federal Reserve pulls liquidity out. 
It fixes inflation. Oh, isn’t it neat? All 
the rents went back down. 
It doesn’t work that way. How long 
before these populations get their in-
comes back where they can actually 
survive, where just the cost of having a 
place to live isn’t consuming almost 
every dollar of their lives? 
We don’t talk enough about the poli-
cies here and the misery they have cre-
ated. Yet, we have pumped so much 
cash into the system that we take a 
look at State and local, and they are 
sitting on boatloads of cash. 
There is another really interesting 
trend line here. How did this happen? 
We had the speeches here 1 year ago, 
11⁄2
years ago. The world is coming 
apart. The world is falling apart. Yet, 
somehow state and local tax receipts 
actually held up dramatically well. We 
overshot the mark. 
Then what did we do? Even though 
we knew they were doing just fine, the 
actual fall in receipts, which is the 
proper term for tax collections, was 
marginal. What did the Democrat pol-
icy do? Let’s send them more cash be-
cause that is their constituents. 
I want to walk through some of the 
other aspects that we believe left poli-
cies are making the working poor, the 
middle class, poorer. Here is a simple 
concept. I have said it over and over, 
but you have to understand it is this 
layering effect. 
Let’s say you are that individual that 
didn’t graduate high school. The value 
you bring to work is your willingness 
to work. So you are the person hanging 
drywall. You are doing labor. You are 
doing landscaping. Your goal is one day 
you hope to own the landscaping com-
pany. You hope to own the plaster 
company. What you sell is your labor 
and your willingness to work. 
What are the two ways you crush 
that population economically? We just 
did the inflation. We saw how much of 
their income now is going to just sur-
viving. 
The second thing you do is you make 
them compete against millions of oth-
ers with similar skill sets. So there is 
this great economic argument. If you 
want to grow American GDP, immigra-
tion is a big deal, but it has to be im-
migration that has a multiplier effect 
on everything from tax receipts to pro-
ductivity. You don’t import massive 
poverty. 
It is uncomfortable to talk about it 
this way. The fact of the matter is,

being a border state, what is happening 
at our border? You are not bringing 
folks who grow the economy. The data 
says actually what you are doing is you 
are making the working poor poorer. 
I don’t know how often anyone here 
will talk about our crisis at the border, 
which is real. Come to Arizona. Go to 
Texas. The societal impact, when you 
do it this way, we can get into some of 
the really interesting economic data 
saying, hey, when populations leave 
this country, you have just actually 
wiped out the ambitious populations 
because these are people willing to 
pack up and leave. You actually hurt 
the departing country. The fact of the 
matter is, you also hurt the folks here. 
The numbers at the border are just 
stunning. I mean, when you start 
thinking of, during this administra-
tion, a couple of million folks, they 
may be wonderful people. It is not 
about them. It is the impact of the 
very people we claim we care about, 
that we claim we are trying to help. We 
claim we are trying to close income in-
equality. We claim we are trying to 
make the poor less poor. Then we do 
everything we can to crush them. 
It is just the economics. I just can’t 
figure out what the left is doing intel-
lectually. They know this number. If it 
was a decade, 10, 15 years ago, all the 
literature we keep finding, it was 
Democrats who were fixated on locking 
down the border because they knew it 
hurt the poor and the working poor. 
They used to accuse Republicans of 
wanting open borders to push down 
labor values. Do you remember? It 
wasn’t that long ago. The argument 
was flipped. 
There goes my theory that maybe 
the left truly has abandoned working 
men and women in this country be-
cause they are no longer their defend-
ers. They are almost the defenders of 
someone who needs a cheap landscaper. 
The border numbers are real. I mean, 
when you start seeing the data coming 
from the administration itself, they 
make it really hard to find the actual 
facts. When you see numbers that are 
278 percent increases, you start to real-
ize what this is going to mean. 
There is a great paper. We came here 
and talked about it a few months ago. 
It is a decade old. It talks about what 
happens when you get these waves of 
illegal crossing, and they get rolled 
into your economy. It was talking that 
it would take a decade for that lower 
quartile, the poor middle class, the 
working poor, for their incomes to 
start to come up. 
It was solely a division of a number 
of people with similar skill sets attack-
ing the same types of positions and 
work. It was a Democrat paper. I mean, 
it was written by folks who made it 
very clear they were on the left. 
Isn’t it fascinating how quickly the 
understanding of demographics and 
population dynamics—what it does to 
the very people that our friends on 
that side used to say they cared about? 
We do lots of virtue signaling here 
and lots of pretty words. The data is 
the data is the data. The policies are 
the policies. The policies are killing 
the middle class. They are killing the 
working poor. 
You start to look at these things, and 
here is the great irony. Think of this. 
Last year, the last 2 years, legal visas 
have collapsed. At the same time, you 
have these huge runs at our border. 
Now, this probably requires a much 
more deep dive on economic multi-
pliers and certain types of skill sets 
and those things. The fact of the mat-
ter is, these populations up here, we 
know we get an economic multiplier. 
These populations over here, it is un-
comfortable, but it is the math. It be-
comes a contribution from society to 
them. 
We did a presentation about a year 
ago and talked about if you saw what 
was happening in the entire industri-
alized world—remember, the only place 
in the world right now with positive 
fertility rates is sub-Saharan Africa. I 
know this is geeky, but it is important. 
I know it is not politics by shiny ob-
ject, which is now what Congress is 
about. This is important. The Western 
world is collapsing demographically 
and fertility-wise. 
b 1230 
The driver of U.S. sovereign debt is 
our demographics. We are getting 
older. Somehow Congress didn’t figure 
out there were baby boomers until the 
last year or two, and now they still 
don’t really want to talk about it; so 
for 65 years they just didn’t know we 
were coming. 
But what happens when you even see 
data—China’s demographics are col-
lapsing. Europe’s we know have been 
collapsing. Even countries like India, 
we are seeing their fertility rates fall 
off rather dramatically. 
The model basically says in the com-
ing two, three decades, it won’t be 
worldwide fights over hydrocarbons 
like we had functionally in the 1970s or 
rare earths. Remember how many peo-
ple would come behind these mikes 
just a couple years ago, rare earths, we 
are all going to go to war over rare 
earths. 
Turns out now that we know how to 
do the iron-air battery and all these 
other things, the rare earth consump-
tion looks like there may be a path 
around the massive needs. 
It turns out over the next couple dec-
ades it is going to be the battle for 
smart people, and that is a really inter-
esting thing to think about. 
So if we do the brilliant thing with 
unified leftist government, we make 
sure that legal visas, legal immigra-
tion crashes, but we open up our border 
to bring in more poverty and misery to 
even our own poor. I mean, you can’t 
make this stuff up. It is just like every 
policy set has great headlines, great 
talking points, acting like you are car-
ing, and you are completely avoiding 
the misery Democrat policies keep 
bringing to the society. 
And then there are the things we sort 
of call second-degree, third-degree ef-
fects when you open up the border. 
Come to my community of Phoenix, 
see the dramatic increase in homeless-
ness. Does anyone else out there care? 
I did a ride-along a couple weeks ago 
with a neighbor who is an officer, and 
we spent 4 or 5 hours driving around. 
He has been doing this, like, 28 years, 
and he’s telling me he has never, ever 
seen—that the homeless population has 
doubled; the crime, people breaking in 
and stealing stuff, but they are steal-
ing stuff from other poor people. The 
violence. 
And then we start to see the data of 
my southern border in Arizona, the 
amount of narcotics. One of the clas-
sic—if you want to play economist, the 
price of drugs that are killing people 
has crashed. When you see the nar-
cotics fall in price, what does that tell 
you? There is a hell of a lot of them. 
So, okay, maybe it is leftist ortho-
doxy you need an open border, but did 
they have to flood my neighborhoods 
with narcotics? Did they have to spike 
the homelessness around the country, 
particularly in Phoenix? Did they have 
to make more people’s lives miserable? 
Because that is what the policies of 
this administration and the Democrats 
who control this place have done. I 
don’t think they meant to do it. 
It was obvious if they thought like 
an economist instead of virtue sig-
naling for policy. Remember, we make 
policy now around here by feelings, by 
what we can say behind these micro-
phones to get someone to send us 
money, even if it is crap and really 
hurts people. 
And you start to see the misery the 
Democrat policies have put on our 
streets. And of course their solution, 
well, we are going to send them a 
check. Of course, the check will also 
continue the cycle of inflation, making 
people poorer. It is just—I almost wish 
we could have, where there is no tele-
vision cameras, no mikes, put our-
selves in a room with a couple people 
who own calculators and say: Let’s 
walk through what has worked in the 
last 25 years and the things that 
haven’t worked. 
Madam Speaker, how much time do I 
have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 25 minutes remaining. 
Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT. 
Thank 
you, 
Madam Speaker. 
Then when you are done doing your 
ride-along with the Phoenix city po-
liceman, he is heartbroken. He has ac-
tually even moved out of the very 
neighborhood that he loved, that he 
has patrolled because even he thinks 
the property crime, the violent crime, 
the people living in the alleys has be-
come too much for even him and his 
wife. 
But the other thing he talked about 
was how many overdose deaths, how 
many people—now, we need to accept, 
a lot of this is a combination of COVID 
policy, economic policy. We are hunt-
ing for the 2021 number, but everything 
we have gotten so far, we have created 
misery out there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H970 
February 4, 2022 
Go pick up your community news-
paper. Do they even still talk about 
how many have died from overdoses or 
has it just become so commonplace it 
is not worth reporting on that type of 
misery anymore? 
And then you start to look at the 
crime statistics. And, look, Democrats 
often accuse Republicans of talking 
about crime to scare people. That is 
not where I am at. My district is an 
urban-suburban district. I care about 
these lives, but I also am fascinated by 
the economics of it. 
Well, it turns out we did inflation, we 
did housing, we did the devaluing of 
people’s labor by opening up the bor-
der, but we almost never have the con-
versation of how do you move out of 
poverty when people keep stealing your 
stuff? 
I have what I will call an acquaint-
ance, he is almost a friend. As a kid I 
used to hang drywall. He still has the 
drywall business. Now he has passed it 
on to his kids and his grandkids, and 
they are really good. They can do a 
level 5 smooth coat. That has always 
been my dream to learn how to do that 
the right way. It is a weird hobby. And 
he talks about they are now not doing 
projects in certain areas because peo-
ple keep stealing their stuff, and it is 
really hard to keep people employed. It 
is really hard to be that micro-entre-
preneur where you are selling your tal-
ent, and your talent is functionally 
your willingness to show up and the 
fact you have a couple drywall spades. 
So we are also working on a project 
now in our office to try to understand 
how much of income inequality, people 
being poor, is the fact that they live in 
a crime-ridden area, crime-ridden ZIP 
Code where people keep breaking their 
bones and stealing their stuff; and by 
stealing their stuff, they can’t accumu-
late assets, and how much of that stuff 
was the very things they need for work. 
And then you overlay just the incred-
ible spike of deaths, of murders that 
are happening in parts of the country. 
Now, maybe this is a societal reaction 
to locking up parts of the population, 
idleness. I don’t know. I am not a soci-
ologist. But we have to understand, so 
many of our urban areas across the 
country, there is misery. 
But there is hope. If we could get our 
policy sets correct around here, there 
is incredible hope because we do have a 
society that desperately, an economy 
that desperately, a country that des-
perately needs people. They need work-
ers. You see the workforce shortage 
continues even with today’s numbers. 
We need to talk a little—I will do 
this; this might be a weird transition. 
Really good unemployment numbers 
today. Even though unemployment ac-
tually went up as a percentage, but the 
number of jobs, which that is a good 
sign, people being willing to take the 
jobs, be a little careful, we need to re-
take a look at what they call the labor 
force participation number because it 
has been reindexed. Every year you ac-
tually try to do a calculation. 
We haven’t had a chance to look at 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ under-
lying numbers. There was a beautiful 
spike in labor force participation. We 
need to figure out how much of that, 
though, is they changed the numbers of 
the population that is available to be 
in the labor force. But today was a 
good number. 
But the wage inflation number was 
really 
dangerous 
because 
we 
have 
talked about one of our models we have 
in the Joint Economic Committee is 
that if we spike much more, we are on 
the cusp of a wage-price spiral. And 
that is just a great way to create mis-
ery in the society because those are 
really hard to break. 
Once again, we were doing, in 2018– 
2019—I believe much of it came because 
we fixed some great inequities in our 
Tax Code. But something, if you start 
to look at the data, why in this last 
year has there been this massive num-
ber of retirees—a million and a half 
more—than we ever modeled for? Why 
are so many people basically saying 
screw this, I am out of the labor mar-
ket, I am disappearing? 
At the very time that if we were ac-
tually doing policy where you wanted 
to deal with the debt, you wanted to be 
able to keep having enough receipts, 
tax revenues to be able to keep our 
commitments on Social Security and 
Medicare, if you wanted to lower the 
misery in the country, you would be 
doing policies that would be trying to 
get young males into the workforce— 
there is a weird number there where 
they are not showing up for the work-
force—but also folks who are eligible 
for retirement, early retirement, to 
stay in the workforce. 
Those are policies that I think Re-
publicans and Democrats could agree 
upon, labor and business could agree 
upon, and yet I sometimes feel really 
lonely around here talking about these 
things. But it’s the math. You see 
these numbers. When you are losing a 
million and a half folks who are choos-
ing to retire early, you do realize the 
data basically says a large portion of 
these people in a few years, particu-
larly if inflation continues for the next 
couple years, will be in poverty. 
One of the greatest ways to minimize 
poverty for folks in their retirement 
years is to have them delay retirement. 
Something is perverse out there when 
we have created a society that is 
incentivized to go take your Social Se-
curity at 62 and take the cuts, the 
lower benefit. I am just really con-
cerned about this. 
And then you start to take a look at 
other population dynamics. And this 
goes back to my earlier statement that 
I believe in this coming decade, actu-
ally the decade we are in and the next 
one, the fight for smart people will be 
akin to the pursuit of rare earths or 
hydrocarbons or those things from the 
past. 
You see it, this is happening all 
around us. There is a collapse in the 
demographics. This is China, U.S., Eu-
rope, and it is for all of us. We are less 
bad than some of the others, but it is 
miserable. And it is the great oppor-
tunity of saying if we would fix the Tax 
Code—and, yes, maybe it is time to 
look at border adjustability, so we stop 
having the arbitrage, and when we try 
to sell things there is this massive tax 
arbitrage of manufactured goods from 
the United States. 
But this is our reality. And yet this 
place will live on being enraged over 
the next mask mandate or this or that. 
Those are big deals. But they are not 
what is going to wipe out this Repub-
lic. Being unwilling to deal with the 
fact of our math. 
And so think about this. We should 
be 
ashamed—and 
Republicans 
have 
part of this, too, as part of our sin. A 
small part, but part of it. We have been 
trying to do the math. Take a guess 
how much money we handed out per 
family in COVID aid. It is out there. So 
think of this. 
I just showed you a bunch of slides 
saying working men and women have 
gotten poorer in the last year, but the 
debt exploded in the last 2 years, and 
now we are doing the math, saying, do 
you realize we put out over $76,000 per 
household in cash, that was COVID 
cash? Over $76,000. That is our best 
math at this point. And we have been 
having to go up and down different 
budget reports. 
But do you feel, anyone here in this 
room or around the country, do you 
feel you got $76,000 worth of value the 
last 18 months? But that is what we 
spent, and that is what we tacked onto 
my little girl’s bonds that she gets to 
pay for. 
b 1245 
Maybe the concept of throwing more 
and more cash and blowing up inflation 
and destroying the incentive to work 
and delinking society from the nobility 
of work—oh, by the way, that work ac-
tually makes them much less poor. 
Now you actually start to see that, 
over the last couple years, it made 
more sense not to participate in soci-
ety. 
This is what we did. Maybe they 
weren’t thinking, maybe they didn’t 
mean to, but this is what we did. So we 
delinked—we 
functionally 
financed 
staying home. 
Then the last little perversity of just 
from today, you will hear many of the 
left try to tout that $350 billion bill 
they just passed here in the House. If 
you dig through it, it is like, you know, 
a 
5-year 
plan, 
government-planned 
economy. It really is sort of terrifying. 
But there is a little gem stuck in the 
left’s bill they just passed. 
Do you realize in there you have the 
pandemic ending in 2025? It is not based 
on: Hey, we have antivirals now. Hey, 
we have vaccines now. Hey, we now 
have home PCR tests. We have all the 
things we said we needed. They are 
here, but instead, we are going to keep 
the pandemic going—and that is what 
you all just voted on—until 2025.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H971 
February 4, 2022 
My argument is, it is about the 
money. The pandemic declaration has 
become a conduit to hand out cash, 
hand out cash to your favorite groups 
to make corporate America, hospitals, 
and others addicted to the Democratic 
Party because they are handing out 
cash. And now, we just passed a piece 
of legislation that says the pandemic 
ends in 2025. 
I beg someone out there: Please lis-
ten. Turn course on the policies. Come 
up with a unified theory that moves 
prosperity because economic growth, 
prosperity, is moral. But almost every 
act moved by the Democrats this year, 
almost every initiative from this White 
House, has made America poorer. It 
has made America more dangerous. 
And now, they are passing pieces of 
legislation to make sure we stay in 
this sort of dystopian chaos for years 
more. 
Take a breath. Look at the data. 
Look at the misery this place has cre-
ated over the last year. And seriously, 
I beg of you, consider having some self- 
awareness and some reflection and stop 
it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY) for 30 
minutes. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate my colleague from Arizona (Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT), as he always does, mak-
ing such a strong case for the need for 
this body to do the hard work that we 
are supposed to do and actually using 
not just taxpayer money but borrowed 
money remotely effectively. 
He has made the case for a long time 
about how mandatory spending, the 
spending that we had promised to peo-
ple through Medicare, Social Security, 
and other programs, is blowing the lid 
off of our budget and the need for us to 
get right and that there are ways that 
we can solve the problem. There are 
ways that we can take dramatic steps 
to lower the costs of healthcare, which 
the gentleman from Arizona talks 
about regularly, about the need for us 
to do to drive down the costs of 
healthcare so that we can actually con-
tain this beast that is consuming our 
expenditures and causing us to have to 
borrow so much money, weaken our-
selves against China, and so forth. 
So, I thank the gentleman from Ari-
zona for his consistency on this mat-
ter. Would that our body or even our 
own Conference be so consistent in 
having an interest in having that con-
versation. 
I would note again for my constitu-
ents, for those people across the coun-
try, all of you that are watching this 
on C-Span, that I am speaking to an 
empty Chamber. 
This is what we do. This is debate on 
the floor of the United States House of 
Representatives. We come down, and 
we had five votes earlier today—I think 
four. One got wiped off. We have four 
votes on two amendments. 
Amendments, right? They are amend-
ments that are offered in the Rules 
Committee, where the powers that be 
decide what we get to debate on the 
floor of the House. 
I am a Member of the United States 
Congress with an election certificate 
for the some 700,000-odd people in cen-
tral Texas that I represent, yet I have 
never had the opportunity to offer an 
amendment on the floor of the House of 
Representatives. 
This is not the people’s House. This 
is a House of a handful of hand-selected 
individuals on both sides of the aisle 
who sit in a back room and decide what 
we get to debate about and what we get 
to discuss and what we get to vote on. 
My colleagues on both sides of the aisle 
know this, yet this is what we continue 
to do. 
I gave a speech a little while back in 
December about the United States 
House of free stuff because that is what 
we are. Neither party has ever met a 
bill that they are not willing to vote 
for because it sounds good, right? 
It doesn’t matter how much it costs. 
It doesn’t matter what it means in 
terms of debt, as my colleague from 
Arizona was just talking about in 
terms of debt. It just doesn’t matter 
because we are the United States 
House of free stuff. 
You got a bill that sounds good? You 
got a problem that you want to solve? 
Come to Congress. We will write you a 
bill. We will print you some money be-
cause there is no consequence to print-
ing the money. 
In what world is that a way to gov-
ern? The world is supposedly looking at 
us being this august institution, the 
people’s House, and here I sit alone. My 
colleagues have headed off to the air-
port to fly home. We will come back on 
Monday. We will punch through a no 
doubt really important list of predeter-
mined items decided by some Rules 
Committee people dropped on the floor 
and say: Take it or leave it. Vote yes 
or no. 
Boy, that is inspirational, looking at 
how a bill becomes a law. Schoolhouse 
Rock laughs at us because there is no 
debate. There is no amendment. Both 
sides just come down here and vote to 
spend more money we don’t have in 
order to buy your votes. 
Well, our message to the American 
people is, are you for sale? Are the 
American people for sale by listening 
to every Member of this body go home 
and tell you all of the stuff they are 
bringing back home for you with bor-
rowed money? 
Well, we have a decision to make 
about how we are going to spend the 
people’s money in the next 14 days. 
Do we have a debate this week? Do 
we have a debate this week about the 
continuing resolution? No. That is the 
bill that is continuing to fund govern-
ment that expires on February 18. 
Did my Democratic colleagues, did 
the Speaker, come down and offer an 
appropriations package or bill and say: 
Hey, let’s have a debate and a discus-
sion about how we should spend the 
people’s 
money 
and 
borrow 
more 
money in order to carry out the func-
tions and our obligations. No, we 
haven’t had that debate. 
We voted on a garbage piece of legis-
lation today that will do nothing to 
check China while we are sending our 
athletes over to bow down to the Chi-
nese and allow them to take center 
stage on the world’s stage. China. 
Never mind all the slave camps. Never 
mind what they are doing around the 
world. Never mind the espionage. Never 
mind the cyberattacks. Never mind 
what they are doing in working with 
Iran, working with our enemies. 
Ignore all of that. Ignore the slave 
labor. Ignore the persecution. Ignore 
what they did to doctors trying to tell 
the truth about what happened at the 
Wuhan Institute of Virology. Ignore 
the virus born in China. Ignore all of 
that. 
Just send our athletes over there, 
and then pass a bill on the floor of this 
House that has literally no chance of 
checking China, holding them to ac-
count, ensuring that they no longer 
continue to carry out the atrocities 
that they are carrying out and con-
tinue to attack the United States of 
America on a daily basis. 
No, no, no, you just pass a bill, and 
you go give some speeches about: Oh, 
we are focusing on China. Oh, but rally 
around the TV tonight and watch our 
athletes hanging out over in China. 
And then have the Speaker of the 
House say: Oh, don’t speak out. Don’t 
say anything. Something bad might 
happen to you. 
Where is the spine or backbone of the 
woman from Texas sending the mes-
sage to the coach of the Miracle on Ice 
hockey team that said beat those com-
mie bastards? We don’t have any of 
that here. 
In 14 days, the funding of government 
expires, and what will we do? We will 
come down here on the floor with some 
forced, last-minute CR, and then each 
side will go out and give their talking 
points about how the other side’s prior-
ities are wrong, and you are going to 
borrow more money as we have now 
surpassed $30 trillion. 
More important than that, when 
Members of this body or the United 
States Senate vote for a continuing 
resolution—I want every American to 
listen to me. When they vote for a con-
tinuing resolution to fund government, 
they are voting to fund the enforce-
ment of vaccine mandates that are 
causing our men and women in uniform 
to be forced out of service, to be dis-
charged. 
They 
are 
enforcing 
laws 
against our men and women who are 
serving so valiantly on the front lines 
in healthcare, nurses and doctors that 
are getting forced out of service, forced 
out of the ability to care for people 
after a lifetime of work, doctors in the

Defense Department daring to say they 
want to have informed consent getting 
fired, getting fired for daring to ques-
tion a politicized vaccine, if you can 
even call it a vaccine. It is a shot for a 
politicized virus. 
And we all know it is a sham, just 
like all the mask mandates, sitting 
here on the floor of the House Cham-
ber, are a sham, just like all the mask 
mandates on our kids in schools are a 
sham. 
They are forcing our kids into the 
corners and forcing kids out of their 
schools and causing mental health 
issues and causing health issues and 
causing suicide rates to go up, all of 
which was entirely predictable. 
And this body cowers in fear, running 
around here. If you dare walk down the 
hallway not wearing a mask, people 
say: Get away. Get away. 
What kind of a country are we? Put-
ting our children in the corner in 
masks when there is zero science to 
back up that it in any way, shape, or 
form is good for them or their families 
or the teachers that are allegedly 
teaching them. 
God bless the woman at Prince 
George County, Virginia, who yester-
day took the school board to task for 
their duplicitous lies about masks, 
blaming the Governor. And now you 
got a new Governor. Now you have got 
a new Governor who has changed the 
law. And what is that school board 
doing? Finding every reason in the 
world to force those kids to be masked 
because that is what this is about. It is 
about power and force. 
Well, the American people have had 
it. Parents across this country have 
had it. They have had it with school 
boards that are forcing critical race 
theory on their kids. They have had it 
with school boards that are forcing 
their kids to be masked. They have had 
it with the inability to get healthcare 
and the inability to get treatments 
when they know full well there are 
treatments that will help people, and 
we refuse to allow them to exist. 
We have the FDA shutting down 
monoclonal antibody treatments in 
Texas and in other parts around the 
country when there is no basis to do so 
when you have the omicron burning 
through with very reduced lethality, 
with very little indication that it 
would impact our children. You have 
study after study demonstrating that 
the risk for our children of dying from 
the virus is so statistically insignifi-
cant relative to the need for a so-called 
vaccine and/or the dangers posed by a 
vaccine in kids. 
Then everybody throws back and 
says, oh, Chip, we have had vaccine 
mandates forever. Hold on a second. We 
have never had a Federal vaccine man-
date like this administration is cram-
ming down the throats of the American 
people. 
Show it to me. We haven’t had a vac-
cine that was adopted across the coun-
try even by local governments and 
school boards that didn’t have excep-
tions or didn’t have a significant 
amount of time, science, evidence, and 
studies behind it. That is the truth. 
My dad had polio. He got polio in 1949 
before the Salk vaccine 5, 6 years later. 
b 1300 
Go study how that vaccine got rolled 
out. It didn’t get rolled out crammed 
down by the Federal Government in 
less than a year. People figured out to 
adopt it, take time, roll it out. And by 
the way, we rolled out this vaccine ex-
ponentially faster than the polio vac-
cine. 
And all those people would come and 
say, Oh, CHIP ROY would cause polio to 
come back. These are all lies. They are 
all said to create and intimidate and 
cause fear. I am not going to play the, 
Oh, I am going to tell you absolutely I 
love the vaccine, go get vaccinated. I 
just don’t want a mandates’ game be-
cause that is all my side wants to do 
because they don’t want to take this 
issue head-on. 
This is about power, and this is about 
limiting freedom. This is about under-
mining the ability of the American 
people to make choices for themselves. 
And it is causing harm. It is killing 
people by taking away our ability to 
focus on therapies and treatments be-
cause we have gotten so focused on a 
vaccine and cramming that vaccine 
down the American people. And it is 
political. And we should be ashamed of 
ourselves. And we shouldn’t fund it. 
We should not fund a government en-
forcing vaccines on the American peo-
ple. We shouldn’t force them on our 
doctors. We shouldn’t force them on 
our nurses. We shouldn’t force them on 
our students. We shouldn’t force them 
on our brave men and women in uni-
form. We shouldn’t force them on Bor-
der Patrol—all of whom, having these 
forced mandates, are causing some of 
them to lose their job, lifetime public 
servants; people that have served their 
country honorably for years. 
We are standing here in the House 
Chamber, and I am looking up at the 13 
stripes, the 50 stars, in a country that 
says, ‘‘the land of the free.’’ And yet, 
this government, through the power of 
government, is forcing people to get 
vaccinated against their will when we 
know it is absolutely true that natural 
immunity is real, that natural immu-
nity, if you had the virus, is every bit 
as strong or stronger than vaccine im-
munity. So you are forcing an indi-
vidual to take a shot, even if they have 
natural immunity, or lose their job, in 
America. 
I, for one, will not abide that, and I 
am going to take every step I can in 
the next 14 days to make everybody up 
here in Washington understand, if you 
vote to fund this government without 
stopping the vaccine mandates, you are 
voting for those vaccine mandates 
being applied to doctors, healthcare 
workers, our men and women in uni-
form, Federal contractors, Border Pa-
trol—all of those people that are serv-
ing publicly and trying to serve their 
country. 
I see the gentleman from California 
here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from California (Mr. ISSA). 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
The passion with which you speak is 
the passion that the American people 
feel right now. One of the things that 
you said in the mandate that particu-
larly I have seen for the men and 
women in uniform, for my chief war-
rant officer, who after 23 years is being 
forced out, for my Lutheran minister, 
who has 16 years and they will not ac-
cept his religious exemption—what I 
am seeing, though, that I think the 
American people need to understand is, 
it is not going to change the number of 
people who are vaccinated. 
Firing somebody simply means they 
go from being an employed person to 
an unemployed person, a productive 
person to somebody less productive. We 
are literally making, as you and I 
speak, our military less productive at a 
time in which the Russians are at the 
Ukrainian border prepared to snuff out 
a democracy. 
So your passion is the passion of the 
American people. You must continue 
for the next 14 days. We cannot fund 
this kind of a power play, particularly 
when, as you said so eloquently, it 
doesn’t reduce the spread of the virus. 
It is dubious as to whether it actually 
reduces the impact when you get it. 
And lastly, if you don’t get it, what 
they do is they choose to fire you, fire 
our first responders, fire our military 
people, and it is not going to change 
anything. Because if somebody believes 
it is either unhealthy for them, or for 
religious reasons doesn’t want to, fir-
ing them isn’t going to change it. 
What it is going to change is it is de-
moralizing our military, it is demor-
alizing our police, and it is creating a 
situation in my own district in which 
our hospitals are saying that they can-
not treat the patients. But the reason 
they can’t treat them is people are sit-
ting at home, and they are sitting at 
home, even if they are vaccinated, be-
cause it isn’t working. 
So keep it up. I just wanted to come 
to the floor and say nobody could be 
more proud of what you are doing and 
more in belief that these are dubious 
how they’re working. The vaccine now 
has become more about a religion of 
power than anything else, and I want 
you to just know that you have the en-
tire Republican Conference behind you. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California. That 
means a lot coming from him and his 
great service here in this body, as well 
as his experience in the private sector, 
working in the healthcare industry, a 
great expertise that I don’t have. My 
expertise is mostly on the other end of 
that as a cancer survivor and watching 
my dad deal with polio and those other 
issues. 
But I find it astonishing, whether 
you are talking about people getting 
fired from their job—or using a slightly

different example—if you look at the 
vaccine mandates that are being ap-
plied at our Nation’s capital in the seat 
of liberty, here in the United States of 
America, if you are in the District of 
Columbia and you go to a restaurant 
and you show them that you took a 
test that afternoon and are negative 
for COVID but you are not vaccinated, 
you can’t go in. But if you are vac-
cinated 
and 
you 
are 
positive 
for 
COVID, you can go in. 
In what universe does that make 
sense? But that is what we are doing. 
We are turning logic and common sense 
on its head. And we are doing so be-
cause—I agree with my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle, by the way— 
we politicize the virus, and we politi-
cize our response to it. 
Our friends in Japan, they put out 
their public policy as: There is a vac-
cine. We think it is good. We think you 
ought to consider taking it or strongly 
encourage you to take it. There are 
some risks that we are studying. We 
are not going to mandate it. 
And their vaccination rates are high-
er than ours. Now maybe they are a 
more compliant society. There are all 
sorts of reasons behind it; we are big-
ger. But it tells you something. Why is 
that not our position as a country. 
Right? Encouraging people. 
My dad is 79 years old and a polio 
survivor. I wanted him to get the vac-
cine; I wanted him to get the boost. He 
is particularly vulnerable. My mom. 
But it ought to be up to us. We ought 
to be able to decide for our families. I 
assume the gentleman agrees. 
Mr. ISSA. Not only do I agree, but I 
just want to share something about 
this body. 
You know, you and I get into ele-
vators and sometimes our colleagues 
get out of the elevator, particularly if 
we are not wearing a mask. One of 
those people, one of my dear friends, 
SARA JACOBS had two shots, the boost-
er, she always wears two masks and she 
is extremely careful. And she is at 
home with a positive on this virus. 
So one of the things that we just 
have to ask ourselves is, Are we man-
dating to the United States military, 
where there is a 99 percent vaccination 
rate, are we throwing out 1 percent be-
cause it is going to make a difference? 
Or are we throwing out 1 percent based 
on some theory that an order is an 
order from the Commander in Chief, 
even if it no longer makes any medical 
sense whatsoever? 
So keep it up. Fight for our men and 
women in uniform, and you will have 
us at your side. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding me time. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California. I am 
just going to wind down here and say 
this is our time to lead. It does not 
matter who is the majority in this 
body. This is the people’s House, and 
this is the people’s House whether the 
Democrats are in charge or the Repub-
licans are in charge. 
And we have a question before the 
body, and the Senate will have a ques-
tion before that body: Will you con-
tinue to fund the enforcement of man-
dates and vaccines in a way that is 
causing the best among us, of our pub-
lic servants, in our military, in our 
hospitals to lose their jobs with no 
basis in science for continuing to do 
so? 
If this is the land of the free, then let 
us stand up. Let’s stand up for freedom 
and let us reject these mandates. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize The Donoho School

sweeter. Lily Grace Draper was named tour-
nament MVP with 42 kills for the tournament. 
This is The Donoho School’s 12th Class 1A

Madam Speaker, please join me in con-
gratulating

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF MRS. BERTHA WATSON HENRY 
HON. SHEILA CHERFILUS-McCORMICK 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and leg-
acy of Mrs. Bertha Watson Henry, a public 
servant who served Broward County for 24 
years and is now retired. 
Bertha is a native of Miami, Florida. She is 
married to the Publisher of the Westside Ga-
zette Bobby Henry Sr., and they have two chil-
dren Broderick and Byler. Bertha has seven 
siblings Roland Jr., John, Diane Jones, Ro-
berta Conyers, Matthew, Glen and Donald. 
Bertha is a civil rights activist who has 
marched against the Apartheid in South Africa 
with the likes of Muhammad Ali and dedicated 
her life to fight against injustice. Bertha is a 
member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority and a 
graduate of Florida State University, where 
she received a Master of Science in public ad-
ministration. 
Bertha worked for Broward County for 24 
years. She was named County Administrator 
in October 2008. She was the first Black fe-
male administrator in Broward County history. 
As County Administrator, she served as Chief 
Executive Officer of Broward County and di-
rected the functions of County Government 
under the auspices of the Board of County 
Commissioners. She oversaw a county with 
1.9 million residents, and operations for nearly 
60 agencies with more than 6,200 employees, 
including the airport, seaport and tourism bu-

IN HONOR OF IUPUI CHANCELLOR 
NASSER PAYDAR 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, today I rise 
to honor Nasser Paydar as he retires after 
thirty-seven years of service in higher edu-
cation in Indiana. 
Nasser’s life-long dedication to public edu-
cation began in 1985 as a faculty member in 
the School of Engineering and Technology at 
Indiana University-Purdue University in Indian-
apolis (IUPUI). From here, he took on many 
roles within the Indiana University system and 
across the State of Indiana. In August of 2015, 
Nasser became chancellor of IUPUI and exec-
utive vice president of Indiana University. 
As Chancellor, Nasser led a strategic plan 
focused on student success, academic excel-
lence, and community engagement. He helped 
lead the transition of IUPUI Fort Wayne to IU 
Fort Wayne, which is administered by IUPUI, 
and the creation of the School of Health and 
Human Sciences through a merger of two ex-
isting IUPUI schools. During his tenure, IUPUI 
celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2019 and 
raised more than $1.7 billion in philanthropic 
endeavors. 
Always focused on students, Nasser created 
the ‘‘Through Their Eyes’’ Scholarship, pre-
sented to a student who is descended from a 
resident of the thriving Ransom Place and In-
diana Avenue neighborhoods that once stood 
on what is now the IUPUI campus. After the 
scholarship’s creation in 2012, IUPUI received 
the Insight into Diversity Higher Education Ex-
cellence in Diversity (HEED) award. Under 
Nasser’s leadership, IUPUI saw an increase in 
student diversity, with the percent of students 
of color increasing from 24.7 percent to 39.8 
percent. 
When the world drastically changed in the 
wake of COVID–19, Nasser led the campus 
through the pandemic. He spearheaded the 
unprecedented shift to remote learning in 
spring 2020, and the return to in-person class-
es in fall 2021. 
Chancellor Paydar has dedicated his life to 
helping students through public education. He 
has led with his heart and persevered through 
many challenges. Today, I ask my colleagues 
to join me in thanking Nasser Paydar and hon-
oring his legacy. We wish him all the best in 
his future endeavors.

CAMPHOR: 
HUMBLE 
HOMETOWN 
HERO, 
CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN AND 
FOR COPPIN STATE 
HON. KWEISI MFUME 
OF MARYLAND 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, it has often 
been said ‘‘Education is the Key’’ that unlocks 
the future for people seeking a better life. The 
person I rise for today could really be consid-
ered the ‘‘Locksmith’’ for Baltimore’s kids. 
From teaching at public schools to educating 
juvenile detainees, his compassion for others 
motivated him to give freely the keys to set 
minds free for higher endeavors. A life-long 
educator and philanthropist of modest means, 
he gave of himself to the Baltimore Commu-
nity, its schools as well as to Coppin State 
University. He was the epitome of the humble 
hometown hero. I am honored to stand today 
for 
the 
recently 
departed 
James 
Leroy 
‘‘Winky’’ Camphor, age 94. 
After teaching for 43 years in the Baltimore 
City Schools, in his love for youth and the un-
derserved, he assumed the role as Super-
intendent at the Cheltenham School for Boys. 
He was ever devoted to unlocking doors for at 
risk children and those within the juvenile jus-
tice system. In all his unselfish endeavors, he 
never sought accolades. As one whose sala-
ries were always modest, his charitable gift of 
$200,000 to his beloved alma mater, Coppin 
State, was an incredible gift. Imagine the num-
ber of students who have been helped and will 
be helped with books, meals, and transit 
costs. He was a man of noble stature, a man 
of an unquenchable thirst to empower others, 
and a man who gave unselfishly of his talents, 
his finances, his inspiration, and never sought 
recognition nor praise. 
This from a family man of modest means 
who according to the Baltimore Evening Sun 
‘‘scrimped and saved’’ over his whole career 
in education. He loved Coppin State so much 
he married the former Florine ‘‘Peaches’’ Har-
rison, a city public school educator who grad-
uated from Coppin in 1958, whom he met at 
a meeting of Coppin’s alumni association. And 
together they grew their philanthropy. 
Additionally, he holds the record for scoring 
50 points in a basketball game at Coppin 
State, a record, which has never been broken. 
As a champion for children and all the 
causes he held near and dear to his heart, he 
received numerous awards. The prestigious 
listing includes organizations and affiliations 
such as: the National Association for Equal 
Opportunity in High Education Distinguished 
Alumni Award, State of Maryland Faithful Cit-
izen Award, Children’s Cancer Center Volun-
teer Award, Heart of Love Award, the Harlow 
Fullwood Award, the National Association for 
Sickle Cell Outstanding Member Award, Mary-
land Department of Mental Health and Hy-
giene Service Award, City of Baltimore Citi-
zen’s Award, National Federation of the Blind 
Service Award and the list goes on. 
James Leroy Camphor, son of James Cam-
phor and Emma Camphor, was born in Balti-
more and grew up near Hollins Market in 
Southwest Baltimore. Raised by a single 
mother, he reflected the value of hard honest 
work in his childhood job of shining shoes. 
The beginnings may have been humble, but 
they did not define nor stymie him. He rose to 
become a champion for children and the un-
derserved and a philanthropist for Coppin 
State University. He gave freely of that which

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. YOUNG KIM 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 2022 
Mrs. KIM of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of my amendment to di-
rect the National Science Foundation to con-
duct a study on the impact of inflation. Specifi-
cally, the National Science Foundation will ex-
amine the effect of inflation on cost-of-living, 
American workforce wages, America’s inter-
national competitiveness, and its impact on 
underserved communities. 
Hardworking California workers and families 
in my district are seeing the impacts of infla-
tion each day and are bearing the brunt of this 
40-year inflation high, and unfortunately prices 
on everything from the gas pump to the gro-
cery store in California are more expensive. 
While nominal wages and salaries have in-
creased since December 2020, inflation-ad-
justed wages fell by 4.3 percent at an annual 
rate over the last three months. The price of 
everyday goods for Americans—especially for 
those at lower-income levels—has increased 
so fast that any gains in real wages and com-
pensation have fallen. 
During one of the worst inflation crises the 
U.S. has faced, Speaker PELOSI wants to put 
$8 billion in taxpayer dollars in a UN climate 
slush fund that we have zero oversight over 
and that China has already taken $100 million 
from. 
I have worked tirelessly with my colleagues 
on the Committee on Science, Space and 
Technology to produce thoughtful, targeted 
and bipartisan STEM bills to promote U.S. 
leadership in STEM research and develop-
ment and create American jobs. Throwing tax-
payer money at the CCP does the opposite 
and worsens the inflation crisis. 
I urge my colleagues to adopt this amend-
ment.

DESIGNATION 
OF 
DEFENSE 
AC-
CESS 
ROADS 
AROUND 
TRAVIS 
AND BEALE AIR FORCE BASES 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce legislation that would designate vital 
roads around Travis and Beale Air Force 
Bases in northern California, under the De-
fense Access Road Program. I thank my col-
league, Congressman DOUG
LAMALFA
(R– 
CA01), who represents the neighboring Con-
gressional district, for being the bill’s original 
cosponsor. 
Military installations play important roles in 
communities around the country, but also 
pose unique challenges by increasing traffic 
and subjecting civilian roadways to harsh use 
by moving heavy military equipment. In Cali-
fornia, Travis and Beale Air Force Bases were 
built with an infrastructure to support the size 
of the communities and the bases at the time. 
But over the decades, both the civilian and 
military populations have outgrown the current 
roads providing base access at the gates. 
The Defense Access Road Program exists 
to support communities in precisely this situa-
tion, allowing the U.S. Department of Defense 
and service branches to pay for maintenance, 
upkeep, or upgrades of roads surrounding 
military installations. This ensures that com-
munities hosting bases have the infrastructure 
needed for civilian life and to support the mili-
tary installation. Travis and Beale Air Force 
Bases each have some roads already des-
ignated under the Defense Access Road Pro-
gram. My legislation would simply designate 
the remining access roads for each base 
under the program. As the communities sur-
rounding Travis and Beale Air Force Bases 
continue to grow, the military should pay its

fair share for roadway improvements for better

As 
chairman 
of 
the 
Readiness 
Sub-
committee, I continue working to secure for-
ward-looking investments to expand Travis 
and Beale, while ensuring that the Air Force 
remains a good neighbor. I plan to make 
these Defense Access Road designations a 
major priority for the National Defense Author-
ization Act for fiscal year 2023. 
Travis and Beale Air Force Bases and the 
surrounding areas must have the world-class 
infrastructure needed to carry out their mis-
sion. The legislation I introduce today would 
ensure just that.

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 2022 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of H.R. 4521, The America Competes 
Act of 2022. This legislation is the largest in-
vestment in our nation’s manufacturing indus-
tries and reaffirms our reputation as a global 
leader across multiple industries. I am de-
lighted to have two of my bills, H.R. 2774—the 
Green Climate Fund Authorization Act and 
H.R. 3036—the Secure E-Waste Export and 
Recycling Act (SEERA), included as part of 
this historic American-made legislative pack-
age to support and secure our technologies, 
research, and development at home and 
strengthen 
our 
collaboration 
on 
projects 
abroad. 
Communities of color, indigenous people, 
and low-income households in the United 
States and across the world are disproportion-
ately impacted by climate change and often 
live near sources of pollution. It is our moral 
obligation to uplift these frontline communities. 
To effectively combat climate change, we 
must reaffirm our nation’s commitment to work 
with other countries to advance environmental 
justice. The Green Climate Fund, established 
within the United Nations Convention on Cli-
mate Change, achieves this by helping eco-
nomically developing countries limit or reduce 
their greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to 
climate change. 
During the prior Presidential administration, 
our nation did not fulfill the pledge we made 
on the world stage to provide funding to the 
Green Climate Fund. As an indispensable 
player in financing global endeavors that 
achieve the Paris Agreement, we must rem-
edy this and continue to promote environ-
mental justice. 
The Green Climate Fund strengthens the 
economies of neighboring countries while also 
benefitting our nation’s economy as we tackle 
climate change. The Tenth Report released by 
the Green Climate Fund, noted that 190 
projects advancing climate justice around the 
world had been approved. These projects are 
helping 127 countries, including 31 in Latin 
America and the Caribbean. They are ex-
pected to reduce a total of 1.9 billion tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent of greenhouse gas 
emissions and reach 197 million direct and 
399 million indirect beneficiaries. The Green 
Climate Fund benefits the American economy 
because it helps deploy financial flows from 
the private sector to investment opportunities 
that promote sustainable development. 
The United Nations Children’s Fund re-
ported last year that about one billion children 
are at an extremely high risk of enduring the 
impacts of the climate crisis. Climate change 
threatens their nutrition, health, education, and 
development. We must increase funding for 
the Green Climate Fund because future gen-
erations of children are counting on us to act 
so that they can live in a secure world. 
SEERA also combats climate change by ad-
dressing electronic waste (e-waste) manage-
ment in the United States. It enhances our na-
tional security, advances environmental jus-
tice, and bolsters our economy by stopping 
the flow of e-waste to China and requiring do-
mestic recycling of all untested and non-
working electronics, which promotes the cre-
ation of thousands of new jobs in the United 
States. 
I urge my colleagues to support The Amer-
ica Competes Act of 2022.

ACKNOWLEDGING THE INCREDIBLE 
WORK OF RECYCLE MY BATTERY 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. KIM of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to acknowledge the incredible work 
being done by Recycle My Battery, a non-prof-
it organization whose mission is to increase 
sustainable battery disposal helping preserve 
the environment and fight climate change. 
Since their founding, Recycle My Battery has 
collected and recycled more than 150,000 
used batteries as well as educated more than 
1.5 million people on how they can properly 
recycle batteries, and why that process is so 
crucial to our communities and the long-term 
health of our planet. 
They have been able to do this by edu-
cating our community on the correct and sus-
tainable ways to recycle and dispose of bat-
teries as well as placing battery recycling bins 
in easy to access places like schools, libraries, 
and local businesses. Shyam Suhas Kandala, 
a twelve-year-old from Chesterfield, New Jer-
sey leads the New Jersey chapter of Recycle 
My Battery. I applaud Shyam and the more 
than thirty other New Jersey youth who, even 
at such a young age, have identified an imper-
ative issue and have answered the call to 
serve. 
I commend Shyam and the rest of Recycle 
My Battery on the work they are doing to bet-
ter our planet’s health, and I encourage more 
of us to get directly involved in trying to make 
the world a better, safer, cleaner place. With 
climate change being one of the most press-
ing challenges of our time I encourage each of 
us to follow their example in being better care-
takers of our planet. 
HONORING THE NATIONAL LATINO 
PEACE 
OFFICERS 
ASSOCIATION 
(NLPOA) 
HON. VAL BUTLER DEMINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the National Latino Peace Offi-
cers Association (NLPOA), which has for 50 
years provided opportunities to Latino peace 
officers throughout the United States. As the 
former Police Chief of Orlando, Florida and 
now in my role as U.S. Representative for 
Florida’s 10th Congressional District, I would 
like to celebrate the NLPOA for supporting the 
engagement, rights, and training of Latino law 
enforcement officers across the country. 
Founded in 1972 by Vicente Calderon of the 
California Highway Patrol and John Parraz of 
the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Office, the 
National Latino Peace Officers Association 
was formed to address the unique challenges 
that impact Latino peace officers in American 
law enforcement agencies. The organization 
works tirelessly to recruit, mentor, and train 
qualified Latino peace officers. 
As a result of their engagement with law en-
forcement offices, communities throughout the 
United States, and Latino peace officers in 
particular, the NLPOA has contributed to im-
portant reforms related to its founding mission. 
For instance, the organization obtained bilin-
gual pay for officers in the California Highway 
Patrol, which convinced other California police 
agencies to do the same. Moreover, members 
of the organization’s Santa Clara Chapter in 
1977 were instrumental in requiring Santa 
Clara County to increase diversity in the hiring 
and promotional processes for the county’s 
law enforcement officers. This action helped 
set a precedent for the promotion of diversity 
in police ranks, something now widely agreed 
upon as a priority. 
As a former law enforcement officer and the 
first woman police chief of Orlando, I recog-
nize the importance of having well-trained offi-
cers that reflect the communities they serve 
across the country. The work of the NLPOA 
has been extremely important in this effort. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognition and thanks to the National 
Latino Peace Officers Association for 50 years 
of service.

OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker,

of Alexander City, Alabama. 
A part of Alabama’s Third Congressional 
District, 
Alexander 
City, 
is 
located 
in 
Tallapoosa County. In 1698, Captain Thomas 
Welch marked out the Okfuskee Trail through

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E114 
February 4, 2022 
Andrew Jackson’s victory at the Battle of 
Horseshoe Bend secured control of East Cen-
tral Alabama. Resulting from the 1832 Treaty 
of Cusseta, on December 18, 1832, the Ala-
bama Legislature created Tallapoosa County. 
In 1837, James Young acquired 320 acres, 
a large portion of present-day Alexander City. 
Griffin Young opened a post office in his store 
and eight men and women dubbed ‘‘The Bap-
tist brethren settlers of Youngsville’’ organized 
Fellowship Primitive Baptist Church. For 35 
years, Youngsville consisted of scattered 
farms, a store-post office and a church. One 
of Griffin Young’s goals was to have a railroad 
constructed on his property, but the Civil War 
delayed that. 
In anticipation of a railroad, Youngsville was 
incorporated in 1872. In 1873, the town was 
renamed Alexander City in honor of Edward 
Porter Alexander. Alexander, originally from 
Washington, Georgia, finished third in his 
class at West Point, served in the U.S. Army 
and later became an accomplished Confed-
erate General. After the war, Alexander be-
came President of the Savannah and Mem-
phis Railroad. His support for locating the rail-
road in Alexander City literally transformed a 
small, scattered farm town into an area primed 
for future growth. 
After the railroad was established, a school 
was built in 1879. Five years later, B.F.C. 
Russell moved to Alexander City. His young-
est son was Ben Russell. In 1889, the Town 
Mayor B.L. Dean, led a movement to build a 
courthouse and the following year, J.C. Max-
well and Reuben Herzfeld persuaded ‘‘builders 
of a cotton mill’’ to locate in Alexander City. In 
1902, Ben Russell began what became Rus-
sell Corporation as an underwear manufac-
turer. That year, a fire devastated the bulk of 
downtown Alexander City. 
In 1919, the B.B. Comer family purchased 
Alexander City Cotton Mills. Known as the 
Avondale Bevelle Plant, the company em-
ployed thousands of local textile workers over 
several decades. In 1926, Lake Martin, the 
world’s largest man-made lake, was com-
pleted. The lake has benefited the local area 
for years. Other area improvements include 
Benjamin Russell High School and Central 
Alabama Community College. 
At Russell Corporation’s peak, there were 
over 7,000 employees. NAFTA and other 
agreements contributed to the demise of tex-
tiles, including Russell, which was purchased 
by Fruit of the Loom. Although the community 
has struggled to recapture its footing, con-
certed efforts by the community to reinvent 
Alexander City have begun to pay dividends 
with more diverse employment opportunities, 
partnership with the lake, a bustling Highway 
280, and the revitalization of downtown. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing 
Alexander City a happy 150th anniversary.

Hon. DAVID SCOTT, 
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN SCOTT, I am writing to you 
concerning H.R. 4521, the ‘‘Bioeconomy Re-
search and Development Act of 2021,’’ which 
was referred to the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology on July 19, 2021. 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this bill. I recognize that the 
bill contains provisions that fall within the 
jurisdiction of the Committee on Agri-

will waive further consideration of H.R. 4521 
and that this action is not a waiver of future 
jurisdictional claims by the Committee on 
Agriculture over this subject matter. 
I will make sure to include our exchange of 
letters in the Congressional Record and will 
support the appointment of the Committee 
on Agriculture conferees during any House-

operation on this legislation. 
Sincerely, 
EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON,

HONORING JOHN LUND AS IOWAN 
OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor John Lund, the City Administrator for At-
lantic, as Iowan of the Week. John’s dedica-
tion to the residents of Atlantic and securing 
federal grants to meet the needs of Atlantic 
residents is the type of hard work that de-
serves recognition. 
City administrators are not someone most 
folks spend a lot of time thinking about—who 
is the person paying the bills, focusing on 
margins and distributions, and submitting grant 
applications? But that’s what John does for 
residents of Atlantic. He says he loves the 
budgeting process and getting to see his com-
munity grow day by day. 
John is a lifelong Iowan; he was born in 
Johnston, attended Cornell College in Mount

Vernon for his Bachelors, then got his Masters 
degree from Drake in Des Moines. After grad-
uating, he began his public service career in 
the Iowa State Legislature, working as assist-
ant to State Senator Pat Grassley. 
John’s been hard at work in the last eight 
years. He’s helped respond to flooding in his 
community, solve budget needs, and meet the 
challenge of the COVID–19 pandemic head- 
on. He knows that Atlantic faces the same ob-
stacles that rural communities across the 
country are facing. The landscape of business 
is changing, he says, and he knows we need 
to ensure that communities like his have a fair, 
fighting chance. 
Currently, John is helping Atlantic receive 
new federal money for projects across Iowa. 
He is helping bring taxpayer dollars back to 
his community, helping Atlantic apply for crit-
ical funds to repair roads and bridges, receive 
COVID–19 relief, develop high-speed internet, 
and much more. John says that getting the 
funds will make a significant difference for ev-
eryone, from improving their ability to do busi-
ness, preserving habitats for generations to 
come, and increasing property values. 
John has been instrumental in advocating 
for repairs to Atlantic’s water supply. Fixing 
pipes and updating systems isn’t front-page 
news, but it is incredibly important. Not only 
will getting these fixes help to ensure the 
health and safety of Atlantic residents, but it 
will create jobs and keep Atlantic as a great 
place to raise family, run a business, and live 
the American dream. John also helped the city 
secure USDA funding to build a new animal 
shelter opening this spring. 
I’m proud to have voted for the legislation 
that creates these grants programs and in-
vests tax dollars back into our communities. 
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 
will bring more than $5 billion dollars to Iowa. 
John, and city administrators around Iowa, 
have the important task of applying for these 
grants. 
John wants to make sure that he can help 
as many folks solve their problems as he can. 
He’s grateful for the dedication of Mayor 
Grace Garrett and the Atlantic City Council, 
whose leadership and vision makes his work 
possible. And John is proud to work alongside 
so many dedicated public servants who can 
‘‘breathe life back into a project’’ when things 
are stuck, like Parks Director Bryant Ras-
mussen. 
John’s work is vital to bringing new federal 
funds to our communities, and that is why I’m 
honored to name John Lund as Iowan of the 
Week.

BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, February 2, 2022 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of Amendment No. 48, an im-
portant contribution to the America COM-
PETES Act that will strengthen our supply 
chains and boost American economic competi-
tiveness. 
I was proud to introduce Amendment No. 48 
earlier this Congress as bipartisan legislation 
entitled the ‘‘Partner with Korea Act’’ with Rep-
resentative YOUNG KIM of California, the vice 
ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs 
Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, Central 
Asia and Nonproliferation and one of the first 
Korean American women to serve in Con-
gress. 
I am proud to lead this effort with Rep-
resentative YOUNG KIM as well as Senators 
BLUNT and HIRONO, who have introduced com-
panion legislation on the Senate Side. 
The Partner with Korea Act, legislation that 
has garnered 48 bipartisan cosponsors here in 
the House, would create an allotment of 
15,000 E–4 highly skilled work visas for Ko-
rean nationals with specialized education and 
expertise, provided that potential employers 
can ensure the visa holders are not hired for 
positions that American workers could fill. 
South Korea is an essential American ally, 
and as our seventh largest trading partner, it 
plays a crucial role in our nation’s continued 
economic success and national security in 
Asia. 
Better access to skilled visas will support 
the rapidly growing Korean investments in the 
United States—and the creation of thousands 
of high-paying, high-skilled manufacturing jobs 
across the country. 
This amendment will enhance our economic 
cooperation with a key ally in the Inda-Pacific, 
increase domestic production of semiconduc-
tors, fix supply chains, and most importantly 
create American jobs. 
South Korea investments in the American 
economy are increasing and according to the 
Department of Commerce. After the signing of 
the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, the 
stock of U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) in 
South Korea grew from $28.2 billion to $39.1 
billion, while South Korean FDI in the United 
States more than tripled growing from $19.9 
billion to $61.8 billion. 
In May 2021, four major Korean compa-
nies—Hyundai, LG, SK, and Samsung—an-
nounced plans to invest $39.4 billion in the 
United States. This is nearly double the in-
bound foreign direct investment (FDI) from 
Korea between 2017 and 2019. 
In September 2021, SK Innovation and Ford 
announced a partnership to build two manu-
facturing ‘‘mega-sites’’ to produce next gen-
eration electric F-series trucks and batteries, 
together pledging $11.4 billion. In November, 
SK announced it planned to invest $52 billion 
in the United States, creating over 10,000 jobs 
by 2030. 
Late last year, Samsung announced that it 
had selected Taylor, Texas, as the site of a 
new $17 billion semiconductor fab, creating 
over 2,000 jobs. 
Just last month, LG Energy Solution and 
General Motors announced their own $2.6 bil-
lion partnership for yet another battery cell 
manufacturing facility, which is expected to 
create another 1,700 jobs. High-skilled, tem-
porary visas will be critical to getting these op-
erations off the ground. 
When companies install proprietary equip-
ment, they often send engineers and other 
specialists to help plan, design, install, and ul-
timately train new workers on complex manu-
facturing equipment—leaving the long-term 
operation to newly-trained American workers. 
Electric vehicle batteries and semiconduc-
tors are two critical supply chains, and Korean 
investments mean that more of these goods 
will be made in America, by American work-
ers. 
This is not a new program. The United 
States already has this same provision with 
every other trade agreement partner except 
for Korea. But none of these countries come 
close to Korea when it comes to the level of 
inbound foreign direct investment. 
Amendment No. 48 ensures that high- 
skilled, non-immigrant workers from Korea can 
support these inbound investments and the 
growth of critical industries in the United 
States. 
Madam Speaker, at the beginning of the 
Covid–19 pandemic, it was Korea that shipped 
us personal protective equipment that saved 
American lives. With deep economic ties and 
friendship, the U.S.-Korea alliance, forged in 
blood, is absolutely vital to securing the suc-
cess of America’s workers, businesses and 
economy at home—to position America to 
compete—and win—in the IndoPacific and on 
the world stage. 
I urge my colleagues to support Amendment 
No. 48.

COLONEL JOSIAH WALLACE 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colonel Jo-
siah Wallace of Rapid City, South Dakota who 
passed away on November 18, at the age of 
97. 
Following high school, Josiah received an 
appointment to West Point. He served in the 
military for 30 years, completing tours in both 
the Korean and Vietnam wars. Josiah was a 
well-decorated veteran, receiving the Distin-
guished Service Medal, Silver Star with valor, 
two Legion of Merits, and two Purple Hearts. 
After retiring from the military, Josiah spent 
his time volunteering in the Rapid City com-
munity. He organized ‘‘Operation Evergreen,’’ 
which planted thousands of trees in Rapid City 
and created the tree canopy that Rapid City 
enjoys as a Tree City USA. He also gave back 
to the community by being an active member 
of the Catholic Church. Josiah spent time vol-
unteering his knowledge and efforts to help 
educate the next generation on the topic of 
leadership in the workplace by volunteering as 
an Adjunct Professor at South Dakota School 
of Mines & Technology. 
In 1946, Josiah married his high school 
sweetheart, Beulah ‘‘Vicki’’ Mae Housiaux, 
whom he was married to for 72 years. To-
gether, they had six children, 12 grand-
children, and many great-grandchildren. 
Josiah’s impact on lives and his dedication 
to serve and mentor others is evident through-
out his life. I would like to thank Josiah and 
his family on behalf of South Dakota for his 
service to our Nation. He will be deeply 
missed by all.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E116 
February 4, 2022 
David Kahan, a national leader from Michi-
gan’s 11th District who passed away on Janu-
ary 8th, 2022. Among the many contributions 
Mr. Kahan made to our community, he will be 
remembered to many as the beloved patriarch 
of the Kahan family, a savvy business owner, 
and an advocate for the Jewish community. 
Mr. David Kahan has been described by his 
family as ‘‘one-of-a-kind,’’ and his inspirational 
personal story of perseverance demonstrates 
how unique he was: At just sixteen years old, 
David Kahan and his family were captured 
from their home in a remote town in Transyl-
vania and imprisoned at the Auschwitz con-
centration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. De-
spite experiencing severe malnutrition, Ty-
phus, and unimaginable abuse, David Kahan 
survived the horrific conditions of Auschwitz 
and moved to the United States to start anew. 
Like many Holocaust survivors, Mr. Kahan 
initially found his time at Auschwitz too dis-
turbing to share. His children recall the mo-
ment in the 1970’s when a professor from 
Northwestern University in Chicago incorrectly 
challenged the scale and cruelty of the Holo-
caust, motivating their father to speak out 
about his experience as a survivor. For the re-
mainder of his life, Mr. Kahan worked to en-
sure that this important history was not forgot-
ten and that the Jewish community was rep-
resented. He spoke at various high schools, 
civic centers, and events to advocate for Holo-
caust education and the Jewish community for 
almost 50 years. 
Mr. Kahan was proud of his country and 
made it his mission to ensure that the United 
States could continue to serve as a ‘‘land of 
opportunity’’ for those like him. He worked 
selling shoes and then in a tool and die shop 
before establishing himself in real estate in 
1967. Over the course of his career, Mr. 
Kahan advanced to work alongside several of 
Southeast Michigan’s most prominent busi-
ness leaders. He said that his personal suc-
cess is a true example of how the U.S. pre-
sents opportunities unlike any other place in 
the world, and he dedicated his life to expand-
ing these opportunities for others. 
Mr. David Kahan will be fondly remembered 
and genuinely missed by all who knew him 
and were touched by his remarkable life. His 
legacy continues through his wife, Terry, and 
their children, Douglas, Jeffrey, and Michael 
Kahan. Madam Speaker, the scope of Mr. 
David Kahan’s impact is immeasurable, and 
Michigan’s 11th Congressional District is fortu-
nate to have been home to such an inspira-
tional leader. Please join me in remembering 
the life of Mr. David Kahan and his many con-
tributions.

RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
90TH 
BIRTHDAY OF EUGENE MCAVOY 
CHAMPION 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 4, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize the 90th birthday of 
Mr. Eugene McAvoy Champion. 
Eugene was born on February 20, 1932, in 
Crenshaw County, Alabama. He was the 
youngest son born to Leon and Carol Newton 
Champion. He graduated from Crenshaw 
County High School and joined the United 
States Air Force. Eugene served during the 
Korean Conflict at Keesler Air Force Base in 
Biloxi, Mississippi. 
Eugene married his high school sweetheart, 
Bobbie Royal, on June 15, 1952, and was 
blessed with five children. He graduated from 
the University of Alabama and worked in pub-
lic accounting. He later worked in the Medicaid 
Division for the State of Alabama. After retiring 
from the state, he opened a CPA firm in 
Prattville and worked there until just a few 
years ago. 
After Bobbie passed away in 1976, Eugene 
and his children moved to Prattville, Alabama. 
He became an active member of First Baptist 
Church and married Margaret Wells Scott in 
1979. Their marriage added three more chil-
dren to the family. 
He is an active member and past president 
of the Lion’s Club. He has also been an active 
member of the Gideons. 
Eugene is a loving father, grandfather and 
great-grandfather. 
His birthday will be celebrated in Prattville 
with his family on Sunday, February 20th. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in wishing 
Eugene a very happy birthday.
