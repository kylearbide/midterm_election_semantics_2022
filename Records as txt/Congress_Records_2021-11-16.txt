f 
REAL 21ST CENTURY GROWTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, yes-
terday, November 15, at about 3 o’clock 
in 
the 
afternoon, 
President 
Biden 
signed into law the bipartisan infra-
structure bill, which, for a lot of us 
who have been serving around here, 
was an incredibly gratifying and im-
portant moment in terms of really fi-
nally getting this country ahead of the 
curve in terms of critical investments 
for infrastructure. 
Last Wednesday night, I held a tele-
phone townhall on the infrastructure 
bill because the House had passed the 
measure on November 5. We had 7,000 
people on the call who were either on 
the phone or streaming in. Lots of 
questions, lots of excitement. Con-
necticut is obviously a State that has 
been settled really since the origins of 
our Nation and has some of the oldest 
infrastructure in the country. 
Mr. Speaker, I would note, however, 
that some of the questions that came 
in said, Well, only 10 percent of the bill 
is for hard infrastructure, for surface 
transportation. What’s up with that? 
And I was joined by Don Shubert, 
who is the executive director of the 
Connecticut 
Construction 
Industries 
Association, who was quick to jump 
into the call and point out the fact 
that if you step back and look at this 
bill, it is a continuation of the last in-
frastructure bill which passed in 2015, 
the FAST Act, which passed on a bipar-
tisan basis and was signed into law by 
President Obama, and was extended 
twice by President Trump. 
Again, that baseline was kind of 
keeping the lights on for infrastruc-
ture. It was not, however, getting us 
ahead of the curve in terms of the 
changes that are happening in other 
countries around the world. And with 
the new money that was included in 
the bipartisan infrastructure bill, we 
are seeing a huge increase, both in 
roads and bridges, but also in rail, also 
in the electric grid, also in broadband, 
which is now critical for any economic 
development for small communities to 
be able to tell companies and busi-
nesses that they have high speed inter-
net. 
So what does that mean in terms of 
the State of Connecticut? It means 
that the roads and the bridges—which 
again is a big focus—got a 32 percent 
increase in terms of the State’s allot-
ment, which will flow through the 
State’s Department of Transportation. 
Some of the old bridges in our 
State—again, the largest vehicle bridge 
is the Gold Star Bridge, which is part 
of the I–95 corridor, has been getting a 
pounding since it was built in 1943. The 
northbound 
lane 
right 
now, 
quite 
frankly, is so compromised that large 
trucks are basically not given permits 
to travel across that bridge. Again, it 
is part of the Interstate Highway Sys-
tem. It is a $250 million job. 
This bill will make sure that that 
funding is there. It is a project labor 
agreement, so it is going to be union 
labor and apprenticeship programs in-
corporated into the work that is there. 
Again, there are countless other 
small bridges, medium-size bridges in 
the district. There is a swing bridge 
over the Connecticut River in East 
Haddam, Connecticut, that was built 
108 years ago that breaks down, inter-
feres with boat traffic going up and 
down the Connecticut River, that now 
has got full funding and is slated for re-
pairs. 
Also, in terms of the rail piece, which 
is separate from roads and bridges, $66 
billion, a big investment in the North-
east Corridor. Across the Connecticut 
River, there is the Old Saybrook 
Bridge, which is 114 years old. Anyone 
who sails underneath it and sees, 
again, how fragile the supports are for 
that bridge, it is screaming out for re-
pairs. That project now will be fully 
funded as a result of this legislation. 
The Coast Guard Academy, which is 
in New London, Connecticut, is going 
to get $53 million to repair the bar-
racks and the dormitories. Again, any-
one looking at the age of those build-
ings, which some of our future leaders 
for the Coast Guard are going to school 
there, is getting a long overdue up-
grade. As well as a city pier in New 
London where the USS Eagle—which is 
the proud sort of flagship of the U.S. 
Coast Guard—will now be able to tie up 
to modern infrastructure that is there.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6270 
November 16, 2021 
There is a host of other smaller 
projects in Tolland and Windham Coun-
ties that are included in this package. 
Again, I would emphasize that the 
total funding amount is not what some 
of the stuff that is out there in the 
media in terms of small fractions for 
hard infrastructure. The fact is when 
you incorporate the FAST Act baseline 
that was passed in 2015, along with the 
bipartisan infrastructure funding on 
top of it, the roads and bridges is close 
to 40 percent of the package. It also in-
cludes increasing and boosting the 
electric grid; which as we convert to 
electric vehicle passenger traffic, as we 
convert to offshore wind, which is 
going to be transmitting voltage to the 
coastline, we need to have a stronger 
grid. 
All of that is good jobs that is going 
to be, again, built-in, baked-in over the 
next five years. It is not going to cre-
ate inflationary pressures because of 
the fact that, again, it is spread out 
over a period of time. 
It was a great day for our country. 
We came together on a bipartisan basis 
to get this done and now we are ready 
for a real 21st century growth that will 
be beneficial to all communities large 
and small. 
f 
AMERICA’S ECONOMIC FIRESTORM 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Mr. Speaker, I 
can’t for the life of me understand why 
my Democrat colleagues insist on pass-
ing 
this 
multitrillion-dollar 
mon-
strosity of a tax-and-spend bill that 
not only I, but the American people be-
lieve will be an economic and societal 
disaster on so many levels. 
Mr. Speaker, the American people 
have spoken in countless polls and sur-
veys and elections, not just in Virginia, 
New York, and New Jersey, but in my 
State of Texas where House seats have 
flipped from Democrat to Republican 
for the first time ever. As recent as 
last week, a Democrat changed parties 
to Republican because they cannot ex-
plain the current policies that are de-
structive to the ends of recovery and 
support the American people’s freedom 
and our way of life. 
They said as clearly as they can: No 
more Big Government control over our 
lives. That is what they said in Vir-
ginia. No more socialist spending our 
country into bankruptcy. No more 
growing the government at the expense 
of our freedoms and our children’s fu-
ture. 
Mr. Speaker, Virginia, a blue State, 
one-third of the electorate said the 
economy was their number one issue. 
Biden won that by 10 points. They 
voted for a Republican Governor. Two- 
thirds of the American people in recent 
polls have said that the Biden eco-
nomic plans are bad and they have no 
confidence in his policies. They con-
nect his policies with the current eco-
nomic conditions. The majority of 
Americans attribute the inflation to 
Biden’s failed policies, just like they do 
the disastrous border and the debacle 
in Afghanistan and in the generic bal-
lot. The generic ballot among reg-
istered voters, there is a 10-point 
spread, if the elections were held 
today, between Democrats and Repub-
licans. That is the highest in 40 years 
ever recorded. 
The American people are speaking 
and they are crying out to their coun-
try’s leaders: Relent. Relent. But they 
have made the connection between the 
policies and the disastrous effects in 
their lives and in the life of their coun-
try. 
Enhanced employment benefits, in 
other words, paying people more to be 
on unemployment than to be at work, 
coupled with wasteful partisan multi-
trillion-dollar spending packages under 
the guise of COVID relief have created 
an economic firestorm, runaway infla-
tion. 
Real wages, 7 of the 9 months this 
President has been in office, have gone 
down. Real wages have gone down. 
There has been an inflation surge to 
the point of double-digit inflation in 
the last month, which have put us, over 
the year, at a 30-year high. 
Gas prices are up 50 percent. We are 
almost a million jobs short of what 
President Biden promised as a result of 
that blue State bailout that he called 
COVID relief. This is the solution that 
the Democrats are offering. 
Let’s raise prices even more and 
lower wages by taxing the American 
people. 
Let’s further extend our recession by 
chasing jobs overseas and putting the 
highest tax rates in the developed 
world on the job creators of the United 
States of America. 
Let’s burden small businesses with 
higher taxes and less people willing to 
work. 
Let’s drive labor participation fur-
ther down by removing the work re-
quirement. 
Let’s trap more people in poverty and 
the cycle of dependency on government 
by removing the incentives to work. 
Let’s wipe out 20 or 30 percent of the 
workforce by thrusting a Big Govern-
ment mandate that is unconstitu-
tional, overreaching, and would de-
stroy any prospects for recovery. 
Mr. Speaker, this was supposed to be 
about income inequality, but if you 
read the tax bill—and I don’t know how 
my progressive colleagues can look the 
American people in the eyes with a 
straight face and say that this is not a 
swampy, special-interest package of 
the century, because they have tax 
breaks for the wealthy by raising the 
SALT deductions. They give tax breaks 
to green industry, to unions, to plain-
tiffs’ attorneys, to media corporations. 
That is all legitimate. That is all true. 
If you look close enough, that is 
what this is about. Not to mention 
they stuffed the stocking with early 
Christmas presents for progressives 
and political allies of the Democratic 
Party—amnesty for 8 million people 
while our southern border is melting 
down; unionization of every employee, 
every employer, every State in the 
country; Obamacare subsidies for peo-
ple making hundreds of thousands of 
dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, the list is too long. I 
implore my Democrat colleagues to re-
lent and stop this. Let’s get back to 
work on behalf of the American people.

HONORING THE MEMORY OF 
BATOUL ALFADAWI 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) for 5 minutes. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of the memory of Batoul 
Alfadawi, 
a 
resident 
of 
Dearborn 
Heights in Michigan’s 13th District. 
Her life was tragically cut short at 
the age of 6 years old from a hit-and- 
run. Batoul was a sweet girl with a 
beautiful soul. She had a huge enthu-
siasm for life and a joyful spirit. 
Batoul loved learning, spending time 
with her family, and playing with her 
friends. I know her parents and six sib-
lings will miss her immensely. 
Mr. Speaker, please join me in paying 
tribute to the memory of Batoul, and 
please say a prayer for her family. 
HONORING LIEUTENANT COLONEL ALEXANDER 
JEFFERSON 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in tribute to Lieutenant Colonel Alex-
ander Jefferson whose heroic service as 
a Tuskegee Airman in World War II 
was recognized earlier this week in the 
rededication ceremony of Jefferson 
Field in our district. 
I was proud to be there in his pres-
ence. It was also his 100th birthday. He 
is a graduate of Detroit public schools, 
like myself. Lieutenant Colonel Alex-
ander Jefferson pursued a military ca-
reer and completed pilot training at 
the Tuskegee Army Airfield. 
As a fighter pilot with the Red Tail, 
332nd Fighter Group 301st Fighter 
Squadron, his unit escorted bombers 
headfirst into the action, bravely pro-
viding protection from vicious enemy 
aircraft. They never lost a single plane. 
Mr. Speaker, on August 12, 1944, Jef-
ferson was shot down and captured by 
the Germans and kept as a prisoner of 
war for 9 months. Liberated by Amer-
ican forces on the 29th of April 1945 and 
discharged from Active Duty in 1947, he 
retired from the Reserves in 1969. 
After serving, Lieutenant Colonel 
Jefferson then became a science teach-
er in Detroit, where he then retired in 
1979. At his ceremony, my teacher in 
high school came up to me and said he 
was very proud of the accomplishment 
I had. He said, Guess what, Lieutenant 
Jefferson was my science teacher and 
my elementary teacher, and now seeing 
you up there, I know that he was part 
of creating that seed and creating more 
leadership and really strength within 
the city of Detroit. 
Mr. Speaker, he has received numer-
ous awards for his bravery, and I am

truly honored to recognize Lieutenant 
Colonel Alexander Jefferson on his 
celebration of service to our country. 
It was his 100th birthday. We sang 
happy birthday to him, and he danced 
along with many of us, even in the 
crisp cold in the city of Detroit, in the 
middle of the field.

RECOGNIZING HASSAN JABER 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize numerous contributions of 
Hassan Jaber to the communities of 
Wayne County, Michigan, as he retires 
after more than 40 years of service to 
ACCESS. 
During his time in ACCESS, Hassan 
Jaber has been a leader in expanding 
its programming to include more than 
100 platforms in 10 locations to assist 
residents across the region. 
He has created partnerships locally 
and nationally to advocate for policy 
initiatives to fight bigotry, advance 
civil rights, and create a better quality 
of life for immigrants and other vulner-
able populations. 
I know Hassan Jaber personally. 
With every obstacle, he never wavered 
in leading with compassion and keep-
ing the community at the center of his 
work. 
Hassan Jaber’s leadership and for-
ward-thinking approach have solidified 
his legacy as a community leader. His 
mentorship helped me grow into the 
passionate advocate I am today. 
Please join me in recognizing Hassan 
Jaber’s work on behalf of residents of 
Michigan’s 13th Congressional District 
and southeastern Michigan as we wish 
him well on the next chapter in his life.

RECOGNIZING 
EDWARD 
LONGENECKER 
ON 
HIS 
100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Edward Longenecker 
and wish him a happy 100th birthday. 
Mr. Longenecker is a World War II 
veteran who has a steadfast love and 
devotion to God, his family, and his 
country. 
He is from my hometown of Victoria, 
Texas. Today, we honor him for his 
service to the United States Army Air 
Corps as a radio operator and nose gun-
ner on the B–24 bomber in the 451st 
Bomb Group, 726th Squadron. 
During World War II, on July 14, 1944, 
he and his fellow airmen traveled to 
Petfurdo, Hungary, for their 29th com-
bat mission. What they expected to be 
a routine mission was anything but 
when they began to receive anti-air-
craft fire that took out two of the air-
craft’s engines. From the nose gunner 
position, he received word that they 
were dropping elevation very quickly. 
The pilot made the call urging every-
one to jump. Mr. Longenecker headed 
to the flight deck to retrieve his para-
chute. 
On the flight deck, he saw his ball 
gunner about to jump and gave him a 
good 
luck 
salute. 
Then 
Mr. 
Longenecker jumped. 
Everyone who jumped before him was 
captured, but he landed on top of a hill 
and began taking on heavy fire from 
Yugoslav soldiers that were sympa-
thetic to the Germans. 
He made his way to a nearby forest 
line, crawled under a briar bush, and 
stayed under that bush until nightfall. 
That first night, he slept near a lake. 
The second night, he stayed in a pile of 
hay where he could hear a group of peo-
ple playing the guitar and singing. To 
him, this was one of the most beautiful 
sounds he had heard simply because 
there wasn’t a sign of war anywhere. 
On the third day, he ran out of the 
wood cover and met a young boy. This 
boy took him to a nearby village where 
he ate, bathed, and rested. Eventually, 
Mr. Longenecker was taken to a house 
where an American lieutenant was 
waiting. Upon his safe arrival, he was 
informed that he had miraculously 
walked through an active minefield un-
scathed. 
It is incredible to think how his life 
could have been cut short, but it has 
lasted these 100 years. 
After serving in the military, Ed 
Longenecker became an electrical en-
gineer and lived a long, full life, mar-
ried to his wife, Marie, for 59 years 
until she passed in 2006. He has two 
daughters, 
five 
grandchildren, 
and 
three 
great-grandchildren. 
I 
know 
many of them, and they are a precious, 
honorable family, truly a legacy. 
Edward Longenecker is a true Amer-
ican hero, and we are indebted to him 
for his great service to our Nation. It is 
an honor to celebrate his life today. I 
hope he has a wonderful 100th birthday.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
SERVICE OF NORMA FINK ON 
HER 100TH BIRTHDAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. DEUTCH) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor an extraordinary trail-
blazer, philanthropist, and public serv-
ant in south Florida, Mrs. Norma Fink, 
on her 100th birthday. 
Born Norma Mager, in the Bronx, 
New York, on November 16, 1921, 
Norma has spent a century giving back 
to those around her. In 1942, Norma 
graduated from New York University 
with a bachelor’s degree in economics 
and a minor in geology, the only 
woman to graduate with that honor at 
the time. 
Shortly after, she put her degree to 
work by joining the Department of War 
to assist with the military supply 
chain while her husband, Robert Fink, 
served in our Nation’s Armed Forces 
during World War II. 
After the war, Norma worked in her 
father’s bakery, Mager and Throne 
Bread Bakery. During this time, she 
became enamored with jazz music and 
made friends with many local musi-
cians who were involved with the civil 
rights movement. Inspired by their 
work, Norma began contributing the 
money she made to support civil rights 
initiatives in the South. This became 
an ongoing passion of hers. 
After moving to Plantation, Florida, 
in 1972, Norma continued her legacy of 
supporting the enrichment of the com-
munity by joining the city’s Parks and 
Recreation Department, where she still 
works at the age of 100. 
Additionally, she began spending her 
time and money supporting local char-
ities. Following the loss of her daugh-
ter, Marian, to breast cancer in 2002, 
Norma dedicated herself to helping 
others suffering from cancer. 
Norma’s spirit of persistence, gen-
erosity, and service to her community 
is an inspiration to all of us in south 
Florida. It is an inspiration to genera-
tions of Americans. 
To honor her legacy, the city of Plan-
tation, her home for nearly half a cen-
tury, has designated Norma Fink Day 
in honor of the oldest and longest part- 
time employee in that city’s history. 
I join the entire south Florida com-
munity in wishing Norma Fink a happy 
100th birthday surrounded by her loved 
ones. I thank her for her dedication to 
bettering the lives of everyone in south 
Florida. 
MAKING HISTORY WITH BIPARTISAN 
INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to acknowledge the historic day 
yesterday in this Nation’s history. 
The legislation that the President 
signed into law was overwhelmingly bi-
partisan in the Senate, and it was over-
whelmingly supported by the American 
people. Why? Because it is the largest 
dedicated bridge investment since the 
construction of the Interstate Highway 
System. It is the largest investment in 
public transit and passenger rail since 
the creation of Amtrak. 
It expands broadband to every corner 
of our country so that every American 
has access to reliable, high-speed inter-
net. 
It secures clean water, making the 
largest investment in clean drinking 
water and wastewater infrastructure in 
American history. 
This is what we have been clamoring 
for, in a bipartisan way, as long as I 
have been serving in this Congress. 
Yesterday, President Biden delivered. 
He did it with the bipartisan support of 
the Senate and the overwhelming sup-
port of the American people. 
Unfortunately, in this Chamber, my 
colleagues on the other side view any 
sort of bipartisan effort like that as 
too difficult to support, too difficult to 
stand with the Republicans and Demo-
crats in the Senate, too difficult to 
stand with Democrats here, and too 
difficult, apparently, to stand with the 
America people in moving forward with 
a massive infrastructure plan that will 
help 
strengthen 
every 
community 
across our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I am so proud that this 
House joined with the Senate in send-
ing this legislation to President Biden.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6272 
November 16, 2021 
Yesterday, as I said, was a historic day 
as President Biden signed the infra-
structure bill into law and as we move 
forward to the Build Back Better Act. 
Again, I note for my colleagues here, 
this too is so popular throughout 
America because everyone understands 
that if we invest in the American peo-
ple, if we take the kind of action that 
is necessary to lower healthcare costs 
and childcare costs, provide universal 
pre-K, and make investments to com-
bat climate change that we will be 
making America more competitive on 
the global stage, something that my 
colleagues in this Chamber often talk 
about. 
I hope that they will recognize the 
opportunity to do exactly that in pass-
ing the Build Back Better Act when we 
vote on it this week.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF BERNARD MARIE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Bernard 
Marie, who recently passed away at the 
age of 82. 
As a young 5-year-old living in Nor-
mandy, France, Marie often told the 
story of being rushed into his basement 
by his grandparents in the early morn-
ing of June 6, 1944. 
It was there that his family sat for 16 
hours in the dark without food or 
water before his mother emerged from 
the cellar to hug an American GI after 
realizing their village had finally been 
liberated from German occupation. 
Marie said that witnessing the D-Day 
invasion instilled in him a lifelong re-
spect for World War II veterans, and he 
was forever grateful for those who se-
cured his country’s freedom. 
Later in life, when he moved to the 
United States, he began hosting an an-
nual luncheon to honor local World 
War II veterans wherever he was living 
to show his support for them and their 
families. 
When he settled in Roanoke, Vir-
ginia, in 2021, he brought the event 
with him. These luncheons served as a 
place for veterans to come together 
and share their experiences—some for 
the first time. 
Aside from the luncheons, Marie 
helped raise money for the National D- 
Day Memorial in Bedford. He sat at the 
bedside of servicemembers when they 
were ill. He even worked to award the 
French Legion of Honor medal to near-
ly 150 American veterans. He said that 
his goal was not only to honor these 
heroes but to ensure they were never 
forgotten. 
I was terribly saddened to learn of 
Mr. Marie’s passing. He meant a great 
deal to western Virginia, and he will 
not soon be forgotten. 
IMPACT OF INFRASTRUCTURE IN-
VESTMENT AND JOBS ACT ON 
NEVADA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Mrs. LEE) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to speak about the tremen-
dous impact that the Infrastructure In-
vestment and Jobs Act will have on my 
home State of Nevada. 
Nevada was ground zero for the pan-
demic, and its effects were especially 
felt by the travel and tourism industry, 
which employs tens of thousands of Ne-
vadans and brings in the bulk of the 
State’s revenue each year. 
Now that President Biden has signed 
the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act into law, our leading industries in 
Nevada and Nevada families can take 
part in the economic opportunities and 
the thousands of jobs that this bill 
promises. 
Nevada is slated to receive $2.5 bil-
lion for highway investments like the 
I–15 corridor between Las Vegas and 
LA, the I–11 corridor between Las 
Vegas and Phoenix, and $459 million for 
public transportation. 
This means that not only can Nevada 
families get to work and school safely 
and more efficiently but that millions 
of our visitors each year can more eas-
ily experience everything that our 
State has to offer. 
Nevada will also get a minimum of 
$100 
million 
to 
expand 
access 
to 
broadband across the State, meaning 
that no Nevadan will be left behind. 
Nevada also has been ground zero for 
the effects of the climate crisis as we 
continue to face the effects of severe 
drought. 
With the passage of my water recy-
cling infrastructure bill, included in 
this, Nevada will now be more equipped 
to mitigate the effects of climate 
change and ensure that our commu-
nities have continuous access to safe, 
clean drinking water for years to come. 
Nevada is only able to reap all of 
these benefits because Congress was 
able to put politics aside and work to-
gether to come up with sensible solu-
tions to create a better future for our 
Nation. We cannot stop there. 
It is critical that we continue to 
work side by side to pass the Build 
Back Better agenda and make sure 
that American families don’t just re-
cover from this pandemic but that they 
prosper moving forward.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
WAYNE MAHAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. KATKO) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the celebrated career of 
Wayne Mahar as he prepares to retire 
after 36 years of weather forecasting in 
central New York. 
Wayne is one of the most recogniz-
able and trusted weather forecasters in 
central New York. When planning a 
hike, barbecue, tailgate, or family out-
ing, central New Yorkers have relied 
on Wayne to share the weather for 
nearly four decades. 
Originally from Brunswick, Maine, 
Wayne Mahar began his career working 
for the National Weather Service. 
From 
there, 
he 
founded 
Precision 
Weather Service, a private weather 
consulting firm that builds forecasts 
for major events like the Major League 
Baseball All-Star Game, the Super 
Bowl, and red carpet events. 
In 1985 Wayne joined the CNY, Cen-
tral New York, broadcast team in Syr-
acuse, becoming the first full-time me-
teorologist in central New York. Here 
he brought a new level of seriousness 
to the profession by utilizing computer 
models and hard science to make his 
forecasts. 
Through 
this 
approach 
Wayne became known for accuracy, re-
liability, and his outdoor broadcasts 
from the CNY Central Weather Deck. 
An expert on severe weather events, 
Wayne was also there to deliver crit-
ical, lifesaving information to families 
during some of the most historic 
weather events in central New York, 
including the great blizzard of 1993 and 
the 1998 Labor Day storm. 
Outside of forecasting, Wayne has 
been a prominent fixture in our com-
munity. He is an avid hockey player, 
hosts regular workshops for young, as-
piring meteorologists, and in 2008 he 
founded the Priscilla Mahar Animal 
Welfare Foundation. The nonprofit or-
ganization was named after his late 
mother and champions animal welfare 
causes, raising over a quarter of a mil-
lion dollars for local animal rescues. 
For nearly four decades, families like 
mine have turned to Wayne Mahar 
when we want to know if there will be 
sun, rain, sleet, or just another day of 
lake-effect snow. While he will be dear-
ly missed on our televisions, central 
New Yorkers can rest assured they will 
continue to see him. 
When he is not spending time with 
his children and grandchildren, Wayne 
has promised he will remain an active 
part of our community. Personally, I 
am glad to hear that because I still 
have not had the opportunity yet to 
putter a few pucks at him while he 
stands in the hockey goal, but I am 
going to do that before too long. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask that my col-
leagues in the House join me in hon-
oring Wayne Mahar for an incredible 
career in weather forecasting and wish-
ing him the best in his well-deserved 
retirement.

political giant in Georgia, dedicating 
his life to the service of others. 
A disabled war veteran of the Viet-
nam era, Max worked tirelessly to im-
prove the Veterans Administration to 
help his fellow soldiers. Committed to 
helping others, Max made it his mis-
sion to help our veterans most in need 
and suffering from mental and physical 
disorders. As a pharmacist, I am able 
to personally appreciate his work to 
make lifesaving medicines more easily 
available. 
His dedication and service to his 
community and country will not go un-
noticed. I am thankful for Max’s life-
time of dedicated service, and I know 
his legacy will live on forever. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family, friends, and all who knew him 
during this most difficult time. 
OGLETHORPE SPEEDWAY PARK CLOSING 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to reflect upon the clos-
ing of the great Oglethorpe Speedway 
Park in Pooler, Georgia. 
The 
Oglethorpe 
Speedway 
Park 
opened in March of 1951 and has hosted 
some of the most exciting weekends for 
race fans ever since. Sadly, Oglethorpe 
Speedway Park will be closing its oper-
ations for good. 
This speedway has become a home for 
its employees and fans alike such as 
Darlene Nerich, who has worked each 
season and every weekend since April 
1, 2000. Darlene’s daughter took her 
senior prom pictures and had her wed-
ding at the track so that her mother 
could continue her streak. Geraldine 
Jenkins has been attending races since 
1951 when she was 14 and has hardly 
missed a race. 
Georgians are collectively mourning 
the loss of this beloved landmark and 
the memories it holds. We are sad to 
see it go, but we are excited for what 
may come next. 
REMEMBERING MONSIGNOR WILLIAM OLIVER 
O’NEILL 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today with a heavy heart to 
remember and honor the life of the 
Reverend Monsignor William Oliver 
O’Neill of St. John the Baptist Cathe-
dral in Savannah. 
Reverend O’Neill served the people of 
Savannah for 46 years until his retire-
ment in 2013. He served six churches in 
his time in Savannah and spent much 
of his time preserving the history of 
the church in the city. 
Reverend O’Neill oversaw and man-
aged the $11 million restoration of the 
Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Bap-
tist in Savannah that was completed in 
2000. In 2003, Reverend O’Neill success-
fully stopped an armed arsonist from 
damaging the church by telling him: 
Don’t point that gun at me. I will 
knock your head off. 
He 
removed 
smoldering 
cushions 
from the bishop’s chair and a burning 
Bible from the pulpit as the arsonist 
looked on. Reverend O’Neill returned, 
intent on fighting the fire with a fire 
extinguisher before police stopped him 
and firefighters arrived. 
He was the image of service to others 
and love for God. My thoughts and 
prayers are with his friends and family 
through this difficult time. 
CELEBRATING WILLIE MAE HUBBARD-WRIGHT’S 
103RD BIRTHDAY 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the 103rd 
birthday of Willie Mae Hubbard-Wright 
of Liberty County. 
Born on November 4, 1918, 7 days be-
fore the unofficial end of World War I, 
Willie Mae has been a staple in her 
community for many years. 
During her childhood, she was a 
proud 
member 
of 
Ebenezer 
Pres-
byterian Church in Freedmen’s Grove. 
She attended grammar school at Dor-
chester Academy and graduated in 1936. 
After grammar school, Willie Mae be-
came a boarder in Dorchester, where 
she learned to sew, a talent that would 
stay with her many years after her 
time as a boarder. 
The living embodiment of motherly 
love, Willie Mae sewed clothes for her 
family and friends, making full use of 
the talent God had given her. We treas-
ure Willie Mae and are happy to cele-
brate this momentous occasion. 
Happy birthday, Willie Mae, 103 years 
young.

RECONCILIATION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Kansas (Mr. MANN) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. MANN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
to discuss the gross misuse of a noble 
process called reconciliation and the 
President’s apparent lack of concern 
for the well-being of rural and middle- 
class Americans. 
The reconciliation process exists to 
do exactly what its name suggests—to 
direct Congress with a tool of com-
promise to reduce the national deficit 
with a simple majority vote in both 
Chambers. President Biden, Speaker 
PELOSI, and House Democrats are, in-
stead, using this process to jam par-
tisan legislation through a deadlocked 
Congress. This is shameless, and Amer-
ican taxpayers will bear the cost in 
both their wallets and their con-
sciences. 
The reconciliation package is chock- 
full of policy moves that will damage 
our country and compromise our integ-
rity as a nation. Among them are the 
expansion of welfare without work re-
quirements. At a time when our supply 
chains are in crisis and we have help 
wanted signs at every corner, this will 
only worsen the issue. Another trou-
bling provision would give the IRS $80 
billion to hire 87,000 new agents and 
ramp up audits on individuals and 
small businesses. 
Just a few other terrible provisions 
include increasing penalties for busi-
nesses who don’t comply with OSHA 
vaccine mandates which are an egre-
gious Federal Government overreach, 
imposing new fines on the oil and gas 
industry, and punishing States like 
Kansas who have opted not to expand 
Medicaid. 
Perhaps the worst part of the entire 
reconciliation package, though, is what 
is not included. Democrats have ex-
cluded the Hyde amendment, a long-
standing bipartisan amendment that 
protects Americans who oppose abor-
tion from being forced to pay for these 
abortions from their tax dollars. 
While the President is on a tax-and- 
spend spree for his party’s leftist wish 
list, the price of nearly everything is 
skyrocketing in this country. Ameri-
cans are heading into the holiday sea-
son more financially insecure because 
of this administration’s policies. Con-
sumer prices have increased over 6 per-
cent since last year—the highest rate 
of inflation in over 30 years. Should 
this massive spending package become 
law, Mr. Speaker, you can expect prices 
to keep going up. 
While the White House has stated 
this bill will cost $1.75 trillion, the true 
cost of the reconciliation package 
could be as much as $3.98 trillion ac-
cording to some models. As if adding to 
our Nation’s already enormous debt 
wasn’t enough, this bill will drive up 
inflation and end up taxing the middle 
class. 
This bill is twice as long as the Bible, 
it is toxic for the American people, and 
it is a gross misuse of a usually noble 
process. I stand in opposition to it on 
numerous counts. 
Mr. Speaker, the BBB is bad, bad, bad 
for America, and I urge this Congress 
to join me in strongly opposing it.

HONORING THE LIFE OF BARNEY 
BROOKS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of U.S. Air 
Force veteran and San Angelo native 
Barney Brooks who passed away on No-
vember 7, 2021, at the age of 92. 
Mr. Brooks was a born pilot and 
often joked that he knew he was meant 
to fly even before the stork dropped 
him off. 
In the Air Force, Barney served as a 
lieutenant colonel and combat pilot 
completing over 100 missions in the Ko-
rean war and 50 in the Vietnam war. 
Over his 23-year career, he served in 
Korea, Vietnam, and the Cold War, and 
he was stationed at multiple bases 
around the United States and through-
out the world. 
Our country owes a debt of gratitude 
to Barney who was brave enough to don 
the uniform and put his life on the line 
many times, as well as his family, in-
cluding his beloved wife, Nancy, and 
five children who supported him and 
empowered him to charge forward in 
the fight for freedom. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Barney for his 
noble service. 
RECOGNIZING PHILIP PARKS 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise

age of 76.

November 16, 2021 
Mr. Parks was a devoted Christian, 
husband, father, and grandfather who 
was dedicated to the service of his fam-
ily, his community, his church, and 
many other things, including his coun-
try. 
Philip served our country valiantly 
in the U.S. Air Force during the Viet-
nam war as a linguist in Taiwan. He 
was a schoolteacher for over 30 years, a 
principal for many schools throughout 
the area, and an extremely active 
member of the First Baptist Church 
and other organizations, including the 
Rotary Club and VFW—even serving as 
a volunteer firefighter. 
We will never know the number of 
lives he impacted over the course of his 
own life. I had the privilege of meeting 
Mr. Parks right here in Washington, 
D.C., on his last flight when he trav-
eled here with the Permian Basin 
Honor Flight. What an honor it was to 
see the service, the dedication, and the 
leadership. 
I am sending my deepest condolences 
to his beloved wife, Lois, who shared 52 
years of marriage, and his children, 
grandchildren, 
and 
great-grand-
children. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Parks for 
his service. 
SOUTHERN BORDER 
Mr. PFLUGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to ask a simple question: When 
will this administration recognize the 
crisis at our southern border? 
Late last night Customs and Border 
Protection released their record-shat-
tering border crisis numbers. Once 
again, in the month of October, more 
than 164,000 illegal immigrants were 
apprehended. 
This is the worst October in DHS his-
tory, and these are only the numbers of 
those who were apprehended, not to 
mention the got-aways. Drug traf-
ficking and human trafficking is surg-
ing. It is confirmed that MS–13 gang 
members are crossing into the United 
States and hundreds of thousands—in 
fact, over 2.1 million—have entered 
this country illegally with more ad-
vancing towards our southern border 
right now. 
Meanwhile, the administration is 
considering nearly half a million dol-
lars in payments to illegal immigrants 
who broke the law while they are not 
paying contractors to build the wall 
and they are leaving already paid for 
materials in the field to rot. All this is 
made worse by the fact that the Presi-
dent is forcing our brave Border Patrol 
officers who are woefully understaffed 
and lacking the resources they need to 
choose between their livelihoods and a 
vaccine mandate. We have seen report-
ing by the Border Patrol that nearly 
half of its agents could be fired in less 
than a week due to the administra-
tion’s November 22 COVID–19 vaccine 
deadline. 
It has never been more clear. The 
President has abandoned Texas and 
every other border State, and he is cut-
ting his own Border Patrol agents off 
at the knees. It is long past time to 
admit that there is a crisis at our 
southern border and that the men and 
women of the United States Border Pa-
trol are overwhelmed and they need 
their Commander in Chief to support 
them. 
This crisis is not slowing down. 
Mr. President, we urge you to secure 
the border, to not abandon Texas, and 
to come to our rescue. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to direct their re-
marks to the Chair.

HONORING OFFICERS CHRIS 
OBERHEIM AND JEFFREY CREEL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Mrs. MILLER) for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, some Members of this body have 
called to defund the police. Sadly, 
while crime is on the rise, we have 
Democrat Governors across the coun-
try who are implementing anti-police 
policies. 
In Illinois, our Governor signed legis-
lation to eliminate bail and put offend-
ers right back on the street. He re-
leased dangerous inmates because of 
COVID and refuses to work with ICE to 
deport illegal immigrants. The result, 
as we all know, is that our neighbor-
hoods are less safe and the job of law 
enforcement is more dangerous. People 
want and need police protection. Amer-
icans appreciate and support our po-
lice. 
Tragically, this past year we lost a 
brave officer from Champaign, Illinois. 
In the line of duty, Officer Chris 
Oberheim was killed and Officer Jef-
frey Creel, his partner, was shot three 
times while returning fire. He survived. 
Like so many law enforcement officers 
around our country, Officer Oberheim 
and Officer Creel put the people of 
their community first ahead of their 
own safety. 
Officer Oberheim’s life and service 
will not and should not be forgotten. I 
cannot imagine the loss and the pain 
that his family suffers day by day. 
They continue to be in my thoughts 
and prayers. 
Misguided 
policies 
from 
ignorant 
politicians have turned Chicago into a 
war zone and are making our commu-
nities less safe. Criminals are allowed 
to steal thousands of dollars of mer-
chandise and many are not being 
charged. Soft-on-crime policies em-
bolden criminals. 
I promise to always back the blue 
and stand with our police. May God 
bless our law enforcement.

HOUTHIS’ LATEST ACT OF 
AGGRESSION 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CLYDE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to bring much-needed attention 
to the Houthis’ latest act of aggres-
sion. 
Back in February, President Biden 
naively removed the Houthis, the Ira-
nian-backed proxy force in Yemen, 
from designation as a foreign terrorist 
organization and from the specially 
designated global terrorist lists. 
Taking full advantage of President 
Biden’s foolish decision and complete 
lack of leadership, the Houthis stormed 
the U.S. Embassy in Yemen last 
Wednesday, using the raid to take hos-
tages and equipment. After years of 
brutal tactics, this latest act of hos-
tility confirms again that the ruthless 
Houthis must be designated as a for-
eign terrorist organization. 
In June, I proudly introduced legisla-
tion to do just that. H.R. 3965, the 
Standing Against Houthi Aggression 
Act, would reinstate the sanctions that 
the Trump administration placed on 
the Houthis, and redesignate the group 
as a foreign terrorist organization. 
I am deeply concerned for the safety 
of the Yemeni locals who were kid-
napped while protecting our embassy. 
And again, I call on the Biden adminis-
tration to provide an immediate brief-
ing to Congress regarding that dan-
gerous situation. 
I also implore all of my colleagues to 
support H.R. 3965, and I urge Speaker 
PELOSI to bring this legislation to the 
floor for immediate consideration. 
We 
have 
already 
witnessed 
dev-
astating impacts of the administra-
tion’s botched Afghanistan withdrawal. 
We cannot allow President Biden’s void 
in leadership to develop additional dis-
asters in the Middle East. 
In fact, at this very moment, our ad-
versaries are defiantly gearing up to 
cause destruction. From China aggres-
sively preparing for a potential inva-
sion of Taiwan, to Russia successfully 
testing an anti-satellite weapon in 
space, 
numerous 
emerging 
inter-
national crises present additional lead-
ership tests for President Biden. So far, 
the silence has been deafening. 
For the sake of the American people 
and our allies, Mr. President, lead from 
the front. 
AMERICA’S SOARING INFLATION 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to highlight the soaring inflation 
that continues to burden Americans 
across this great Nation. There are 
plenty of reasons to be thankful this 
holiday season, but Biden’s Thanks-
giving tax is not one of them. 
Prices of common grocery items are 
skyrocketing, just in time for folks to 
gather around the table with loved 
ones. The price of a 15-pound turkey is 
up 27 percent. Apples are up 6.7 per-
cent. Potatoes are up 13 percent. Cran-
berries are up 5.2 percent. And the list 
goes on and on. In fact, this year’s 
Thanksgiving is expected to be the 
most expensive holiday meal in his-
tory. 
But it doesn’t just stop at the gro-
cery store checkout line. Consistent 
with months of increasing gas prices, 
holiday travelers will face sticker

Purposely moving forward with an-
other 
massive

to ignore these very troubling inflation 
concerns. American workers, families,

In the face of a volatile economy, we

money into the economy. 
CELEBRATING MARS WRIGLEY FLOWERY BRANCH 
PLANT’S 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the Mars Wrigley plant in the city of 
Flowery Branch, in the Ninth District 
of Georgia. 
The plant opened back in 1971, be-
coming one of the very first confection 
factories in northern Georgia. Now, it 
is the manufacturing hub for the com-
pany’s iconic gum brands, producing 75 
percent of the chewing gum volume for 
the North American market. 
Currently, the plant employs over 920 
associates, of which 250 have been with 
Mars Wrigley for over 20 years. Due to 
their hard work, this factory is one of 
the 
fastest 
growing 
manufacturing 
plants in the State of Georgia, and has 
been recognized as such by the cham-
ber of commerce for its impact on the 
Hall County community. 
In fact, Mars Wrigley continues to go 
the extra mile by giving back to the 
local 
community, 
regularly 
volun-
teering in clean-ups, Christmas gift do-
nations, and food banks. 
Congratulations, Mars Wrigley, on 50 
productive years in northern Georgia, 
and best wishes for another prolific 
half century.

RECOGNIZING AARON CLAY, TEN-

SECONDARY 
SCHOOL 
ATHLETIC ASSOCIATION’S ATH-
LETIC DIRECTOR OF THE YEAR 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. BURCHETT) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to recognize Aaron Clay, who was 
named 
the 
Tennessee 
Secondary 
School Athletic Association’s Athletic 
Director of the Year. 
Aaron Clay is the athletics director 
at the Washburn School. He graduated 
from Washburn in 1997. His brother, 
Greg, hired him shortly after grad-
uating to help the school’s basketball 
team. 
Since returning to coach the basket-
ball team, Director Clay led several of 
Washburn’s athletic teams to success. 
He coached two basketball teams to 
the substate tournament, won two dis-
trict titles in basketball, and sent a 
cross-country student athlete to the 
State 
championship 
meet 
for 
five 
straight years. 
Mr. Speaker, under Director Clay’s 
leadership, the school recently com-
pleted a new gymnasium. Away from 
athletics, Director Clay also leads 
Washburn’s academic curriculum as an 
assistant principal. In his academic 
role, he once again teamed up with his 
brother, Greg, who is Washburn’s prin-
cipal. 
The TSSAA Athletic Director of the 
Year award celebrates an athletic di-
rector who builds up students on and 
off the field and, clearly, he does this, 
Mr. Speaker. 
Director Clay’s work throughout his 
career as a school administrator and 
athletic director positively influenced 
hundreds of Washburn students. Our 
community is proud of the impact he 
has had on young people. 
Congratulations, Director Clay, and 
keep up the good work. 
HUGE VICTORY FOR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, indi-
vidual freedom just scored a huge vic-
tory. Last weekend, a court of appeals 
ruled what we already know. Joe Biden 
overstepped his authority with his vac-
cine mandate. No more jobs will be 
threatened by the administration over 
coronavirus 
vaccination 
status, 
for 
now. 
I applaud those who stood up to 
Biden’s vaccine mandate in court. But 
the fight isn’t over, Mr. Speaker. It is 
clearly not over. Biden’s far-left Jus-
tice Department is plotting a legal as-
sault to revive the mandate. Those of 
us who value personal liberty cannot 
be content with one court ruling. 
More action is necessary, Mr. Speak-
er. 
My bill, the Keeping our COVID–19 
Heroes Employed Act, which is spon-
sored in the Senate by Senator MARSHA 
BLACKBURN, 
also 
from 
Tennessee, 
would further protect American work-
ers by forbidding certain employers 
from firing unvaccinated employees. 
We need to ban Biden’s vaccine man-
date because it is unconstitutional, Mr. 
Speaker, but also because of the crip-
pling effect it will have on our econ-
omy. 
For example, supply chain jobs will 
be lost if Biden’s vaccine mandate 
takes effect. A labor shortage in the 
supply chains means it takes longer to 
move products to America’s store-
fronts, Mr. Speaker. The costs of keep-
ing up with demand is passed to con-
sumers in the form of higher prices. 
If Biden gets his way, it will dev-
astate our struggling economy and 
steal 
paychecks 
from 
hardworking 
Americans, 
Mr. 
Speaker. 
Congress 
can’t wait for the Biden administra-
tion’s next attack on the unvaccinated. 
Let’s protect the civil liberties of the 
workers by passing the Keeping our 
COVID–19 Heroes Employed Act, Mr. 
Speaker.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Equip us, O Lord, this day with the 
full armor You provide, that we would 
be confident to stand for whatever is 
true, whatever is noble, whatever is 
right and pure. 
May these, Your divine intentions, be 
the principles we strive to preserve this 
day. In everything we do, with Your 
steadfast love as our foundation, may 
we stand unwavering. 
Gird us then with the belt of truth, 
the breastplate of righteousness. Pre-
pare us to give testimony to Your 
peace and to hold high a defense of 
faith in Your gracious plan. 
Protect us with the covering of Your 
deliverance and attune our hearts to 
the piercing insight of Your word. 
May Your confidence in us not be in 
vain, but may we prove worthy in 
wielding the power of Your mercy. 
Then may all those who seek to un-
dermine decency, who rejoice in rancor 
and capitalize on conflict, may they all 
fall defenseless before Your throne of 
grace. 
For it is only in Your grace that we 
find hope and by the power of Your 
name are we able to pray. 
Amen.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6276 
November 16, 2021 
CALLING FOR FULL RESTORATION 
OF BUFFALO RIVER 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam 
Speaker, the $1.2 trillion infrastructure 
bill signed into law yesterday reveals 
the power of this moment and the im-
portance of momentum. 
Madam Speaker, 50 years ago, the 
Buffalo River was declared biologically 
dead 
and 
ecologically 
destroyed. 
Through the work of the Buffalo Niag-
ara Waterkeeper and their partners, we 
made a plan and made progress passing 
the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. 
Now with new infrastructure funding, 
new life for the Buffalo River is closer 
than ever. 
Today, I am calling on the Environ-
mental Protection Agency for a full 
restoration of the Buffalo River and for 
a date-certain action plan to delist the 
river as an area of concern. 
This project restores our natural en-
vironment, and it makes more viable 
other projects like The Riverline and 
the DL&W terminal. It also leverages a 
settlement reached this week to pro-
vide river access to the Kaisertown 
neighborhood and new public access 
along Buffalo’s City Ship Canal. 
The power of this law will lead us to 
a logical conclusion, connecting our 
community to resources long denied 
and to improve our life quality now 
and into the future. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PIRI KATZ ON HER 
94TH BIRTHDAY 
(Mrs. STEEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. STEEL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 94th birthday of 
a truly inspirational figure in our Or-
ange County community, Piri Katz. 
Piri Katz is a Holocaust survivor. 
At just 15, Piri and her family were 
taken by Nazis on the eve of Passover. 
After spending months in concentra-
tion camps, where her family was mur-
dered, she was liberated by American 
soldiers in May 1945. No one can imag-
ine the horrors she and others who 
lived through this tragedy experienced 
and the strength it took just to sur-
vive. 
In September 1949, she came to Amer-
ica and built her own American Dream. 
She made a beautiful life for herself 
here. Piri has four kids and eight 
grandkids that she is so proud of. 
Piri’s story is inspiring and should 
remind all of us to never take our free-
dom for granted. 
Happy 94th birthday, Piri. 
f 
HONORING THE LATIN AMERICAN 
WOMEN WRITERS PROJECT 
(Mr. ESPAILLAT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor 26 incredibly talented 
Latina women in the field of literature 
that I had the pleasure of meeting this 
morning. 
These women are a huge part of the 
Latin 
American 
Women 
Writers 
Project. They represent the best in our 
community, the leaders that stand tall 
today to inspire our youth and our en-
tire community. 
Their efforts to ensure inclusion and 
representation in journalism, creative 
writing, and storytelling, and sharing 
these ideas with us here today, are 
commendable. They are laying the 
groundwork, Mr. Speaker, to uplift and 
inspire the next generation of Latina 
writers. 
I hope that the discussion we had 
today will continue onward throughout 
our communities and across this great 
Nation and that their work will con-
tinue to inspire many in our commu-
nities, particularly the next genera-
tion. 
They have used their voices to share 
their stories with our families. Mr. 
Speaker, I welcome them. 
f 
BIDEN INFLATION HIGHEST IN 40 
YEARS 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the Bureau of Labor Statis-
tics reports that the October Consumer 
Price Index has increased 6.2 percent in 
a 
year 
with 
Biden 
inflation. 
Annualized, this means inflation is 
going to be 7.4 percent, which would 
make it the highest rate since 1982, the 
highest rate of inflation in over 40 
years. 
At the same time, in 7 of the last 9 
months, real wages have fallen and 
workers lost 2.6 percent of their sala-
ries by the end of the first Biden year. 
Biden and the Democrats are accel-
erating inflation with insane spending 
bills, which now total over $5 trillion. 
Democrat elite think they are smart-
er than anyone, and they think Demo-
crat voters are ignorant to believe $5 
trillion in spending costs zero dollars. 
You pay with Biden inflation. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
who successfully protected America for 
20 years as the global war on terrorism 
continues moving from the Afghani-
stan safe haven to America. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF NOHEMA GRABER 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and leg-
acy of a wonderful woman from my dis-
trict who dedicated her life to the bet-
terment of her community by edu-
cating the next generation. 
On November 2, 2021, Fairfield lost a 
beloved member of their community, 
Nohema 
Graber. 
Born 
in 
Mexico, 
Nohema later moved to Iowa, where 
her love for education drove her to pur-
sue a career in teaching. She would 
eventually go on to teach Spanish at 
Fairfield High School. 
When reading stories about Nohema’s 
kind and caring spirit, I came across 
one that really warmed my heart, and 
I would like to share it. 
When a dear friend of Nohema’s son 
was diagnosed with a brain tumor 12 
years ago, Nohema would pray with her 
friend every single day. Her son, now 
healthy, was among the countless 
members of the Fairfield community 
to attend Nohema’s vigil. 
I send my prayers out to the friends 
and family of Nohema Graber, as well 
as the students and faculty of Fairfield 
High School, as they mourn this tragic 
loss. 
f 
RECOGNIZING LEE MCMILLAN ON 
HIS 90TH BIRTHDAY 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Lee McMillan, of Ashe County, 
who will be celebrating his 90th birth-
day this Saturday. 
I have been blessed to know Lee for 
many years, and I know that he has 
helped build the foundation that the 
North 
Carolina 
Republican 
Party 
stands upon today. 
His 23 years of service to the United 
States Navy, after his graduation from 
the Naval Academy, and his tireless 
work in promoting conservative values 
on the local and State level are noth-
ing short of admirable. 
Lee is also the proud owner of 
Shatley Springs Inn and Restaurant lo-
cated in the high country, a local land-
mark that has received national rec-
ognition since 1958. 
To me, Lee is a perfect representa-
tion of the best that Ashe County and 
western North Carolina have to offer. 
Thank you, Lee, and happy birthday.

SPENDING TRILLIONS WILL 
WORSEN INFLATION 
(Mr. BERGMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, in 
Michigan’s 
First 
District, 
we 
are 
hunkering down for the usual long but 
beautiful winter season. We enjoy it, 
and we prepare for it. 
This year, that preparation is much 
more complicated. The supply chain 
crisis, labor shortages, and inflation 
have made our gas and groceries that 
much more expensive at a time when 
we can’t necessarily afford it at that 
working-family level. 
In my district, we are truly feeling 
the negative impacts of this adminis-
tration’s failed policies. The White

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6277 
November 16, 2021 
House and congressional Democrats 
seem to be living in a different reality, 
telling us that the President’s agenda 
‘‘will not add to inflationary pressure.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, the real risk here would 
be passing the Democrat’s multitril-
lion-dollar tax and spend package. My 
colleagues in the House seem to be 
turning a blind eye to what Americans 
are actually experiencing. 
Make no mistake, spending trillions, 
while punishing the middle class and 
job creators, will make inflation worse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to oppose this legislation. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FAMILY 
CAREGIVER MONTH 
(Mr. LAHOOD asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of National Fam-
ily Caregiver Month. 
More than 95 percent of individuals 
with dementia also have one or more 
chronic conditions. Individuals with 
dementia rely heavily on their family 
members or other caregivers to provide 
time, transportation, and other health 
services, which can be economically 
and emotionally challenging for a fam-
ily. 
In Illinois alone, we have over 381,000 
caregivers for people living with de-
mentia, and 53.5 percent of them have 
their own chronic health conditions. 
During National Family Caregiver 
Month, it is important to recognize the 
dedication and sacrifice that families 
and caregivers provide for their loved 
ones. 
My legislation, the Comprehensive 
Care for Alzheimer’s Act, provides ad-
ditional support to dementia patients 
and caregivers. The bill would direct 
the Center for Medicare and Medicaid 
Innovation to implement a dementia 
care model to test comprehensive care 
management services and would make 
a big impact on the lives of people liv-
ing with dementia and their caregivers. 
As I travel throughout Illinois, de-
mentia care and Alzheimer’s advocates 
continue to share their caregiving sto-
ries with me. Mr. Speaker, I ask for 
support of this bill.

b 1215 
INVESTMENTS IN THE NATIVE 
HAWAIIAN COMMUNITY 
(Mr. KAHELE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KAHELE. Mr. Speaker, as a na-
tive Hawaiian, I am excited to high-
light how the Build Back Better Act 
will benefit the native Hawaiian com-
munity and all of the original indige-
nous peoples, the first peoples of these 
nations, across the United States. 
The Build Back Better Act will 
strengthen our collective indigenous 
communities through investments in 
culturally relevant healthcare, housing 
and community development, profes-
sional development for indigenous lan-
guages and early childhood educators, 
accelerator programs for small busi-
nesses, and funding for native Hawai-
ian healthcare systems. 
These programs further the trust re-
sponsibility from the United States 
Government to indigenous commu-
nities. 
The Build Back Better Act also cre-
ates opportunities for Federal con-
sultation on land use planning, devel-
opment, and infrastructure projects— 
something our indigenous communities 
have requested for years. 
That is why we must pass the Build 
Back Better Act and add its invest-
ments to the initiatives we just passed 
in the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act. The Build Back Better Act 
supports our indigenous communities 
and creates opportunity for indigenous 
peoples while ensuring that America’s 
richest citizens pay their fair share. 
Mahalo, Mr. Speaker. 
f 
SOUTHERN BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the dangerous situa-
tion at our southern border. 
Since President Biden took office, 
there have been over 1.4 million illegal 
border crossings. These record-high ap-
prehensions keep increasing with no 
end in sight, and now a new caravan of 
migrants is headed through Mexico to 
our southern border, as we speak. 
Instead of addressing what has be-
come a humanitarian, health, and na-
tional security problem, this adminis-
tration and congressional Democrats 
keep announcing plans that will only 
exacerbate the problem. 
For example, the administration has 
discussed paying illegal immigrants 
settlement payments of up to $450,000, 
and the spending package being pushed 
through this Chamber includes am-
nesty for up to 10 million illegal immi-
grants and up to $100 billion in tax-
payer-funded benefits for them. 
These irresponsible proposals and 
dangerous open border policies will 
continue to fuel the crisis and encour-
age more illegal activity at the border. 
We must secure our borders and ensure 
that the rule of law applies to every-
one. 
f 
HONORING FALLEN HEROES 
(Mrs. KIM of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. KIM of California. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to honor our 13 fallen serv-
icemembers who made the ultimate 
sacrifice to save the lives of Americans 
and allies in Afghanistan at the Kabul 
Airport at the end of August. 
These brave men and women, includ-
ing southern California marines Lance 
Corporal Dylan Merola, Lance Corporal 
Kareem Nikoui, and Corporal Hunter 
Lopez, were young—many in their 
twenties—and incredibly brave. They 
valiantly put their lives on the line for 
others. Their courage and heroism in 
the face of danger will never be forgot-
ten. 
I am proud that the House of Rep-
resentatives came together to honor 
their memory and posthumously award 
these fallen heroes a well-deserved 
Congressional Gold Medal. 
Mr. Speaker, we remember their 
names and their stories always, and we 
continue to rally with our new Gold 
Star families. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE THOMAS FAM-
ILY OF MEYERSDALE, PENNSYL-
VANIA, 
AND 
THEIR 
ACTS 
OF 
KINDNESS 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
Thomas family of Meyersdale, Pennsyl-
vania, who tragically lost their son, 
Trevor, a student athlete who played 
baseball at Allegany College of Mary-
land and at Penn State. 
In the face of that loss, the Thomas 
family has responded with love and 
compassion for their community. In 
honor of their son’s commitment to 
serving others, the Thomas family 
printed small cards that encouraged 
their neighbors to help others through 
acts of kindness. 
Those cards have inspired incredible 
gestures of generosity in our commu-
nity. The acts of kindness were wide- 
ranging. From preparing care packages 
for the homeless to donating blood to 
handing out doughnuts and even deliv-
ering flowers to strangers, members of 
the community looked to see what 
they could do to help one another. 
Together, the people of Somerset 
County are working to keep Trevor’s 
memory alive through their acts of 
service for one another. 
On each card that the family has dis-
tributed is a simple mantra that de-
fined the way that Trevor lived his life. 
It is a mantra that we should all aspire 
to: Be somebody who makes everybody 
feel like somebody.

ENDING EXPLOITATION OF 
VETERANS 
(Mr. CAWTHORN asked and was

Mr. CAWTHORN. Mr. Speaker, free-

triots. We occupy this Chamber today 
and walk free among our countrymen 
because generation after generation of 
liberty-minded 
warriors 
surrendered 
their lives to the conviction that 
America was worth defending. Their

blood, their sweat, and their sacrifice 
are the currency for our freedom. 
Their sacrifice must never be ex-
ploited. I am honored to bring before 
this Chamber today legislation that 
ends the exploitation of veterans’ fi-
nances and taxpayer dollars. A loop-
hole exists in the GI Bill that allows 
some public flight schools to charge ex-
orbitant amounts of money to veterans 
and taxpayers for veterans’ tuition. 
My legislation, the Fly Vets Act, not 
only stops this loophole dead in its 
tracks, but it empowers veterans and 
drastically expands their benefits. It 
allows them to pay for flight training 
through accelerated payments and al-
lows them to double the monetary cap 
on both tuition and fees per year. This 
bill does not cut benefits in any way. It 
gives power back to our heroes in uni-
form. 
I thank the many VSOs who support 
this legislation, along with Congress-
woman UNDERWOOD for encompassing 
this legislation in her bill and working 
with me across party lines to ensure 
that the exploitation of veterans and 
taxpayers ends today.

may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
4591, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4591, the VA Electronic Health 
Record Transparency Act of 2021, as 
amended. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
has struggled to produce reliable cost 
estimates and reporting on the infra-
structure needs associated with its $16 
billion electronic health record mod-
ernization project. This bill is a good 
governance measure which will enable 
Congress to conduct better oversight 
and hold VA accountable for its spend-
ing. 
It is essential that we ensure that 
taxpayer funds meant to serve veterans 
are being used properly and that VA is 
maintaining detailed records of its IT 
and physical infrastructure expendi-
tures. We owe that to the veterans who 
get their care from VA and to the 
American taxpayer. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support H.R. 4591, as amend-
ed, which was unanimously supported 
in committee. 
I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. 
Speaker. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4591, as amended, the VA Elec-
tronic Health Record Transparency 
Act. 
Since the very beginning of the Elec-
tronic Health Record Modernization, or 
the EHRM, program, this committee 
has been requesting accurate and up- 
to-date lifecycle cost estimates from 
VA. Despite our requests, VA has never 
provided a credible lifecycle cost esti-
mate. VA’s cost estimates could not 
withstand even the most basic scru-
tiny.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6279 
November 16, 2021 
This bill would require quarterly re-
ports on the costs of the EHRM pro-
gram. It would also capture the rough-
ly $5 billion of costs the Inspector Gen-
eral found were unaccounted for and 
any other costs that VA has not been 
including. 
Of course, cost is not everything. The 
electronic health record program needs 
to help the VA medical staff better 
care for veterans. That is why this bill 
would also require VA to report on per-
formance and safety metrics. These 
data points will allow us to evaluate 
the program and determine whether it 
is making VA medical centers safer, 
faster, and better. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipar-
tisan work of the Technology Mod-
ernization Subcommittee, and I am 
also pleased to be the original cospon-
sor of this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my 
colleagues to support H.R. 4591, as 
amended, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. MRVAN), who is my good friend 
and a member of the House Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs and chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Technology Mod-
ernization. 
Mr. MRVAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman TAKANO
for yielding me 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this year the VA 
Office of the Inspector General released 
two separate reports highlighting VA’s 
failure to conduct reliable lifecycle 
cost estimates for its Electronic Health 
Record Modernization program. 
Specifically, the IG repeatedly found 
unreliable and incomplete estimates 
for infrastructure upgrades and costs 
as well as inadequate reporting of 
those costs. 
Given the size and scope of the 
EHRM program, the lack of accurate 
cost estimates hampers VA’s ability to 
provide Congress with an accurate pic-
ture of the cost and scale of efforts to 
modernize IT and physical infrastruc-
ture at VA medical centers. 
This piece of legislation will address 
these issues. It requires VA to look at 
all costs across VHA, OIT, and any 
other programs for any amount ex-
pended on the EHRM program, includ-
ing for infrastructure projects and con-
tractors that were not part of the 
original contract. This legislation also 
requires VA to provide the committee 
with reports on performance metrics 
and outcomes. 
I thank Chairman TAKANO and Rank-
ing Member BOST for their leadership 
and for cosponsoring this legislation as 
well as all of the other cosponsors and 
the committee members who have 
truly made this a bipartisan effort. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill.

H.R. 4591, the VA Electronic Health 
Record Transparency Act of 2021, as 
amended, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4591, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
The title of the bill was amended so 
as to read: ‘‘A bill to direct the Sec-
retary of Veterans Affairs to submit to 
Congress periodic reports on the costs, 
performance metrics, and outcomes of

ELLZEY. 
This bill requires that VA submit a 
report on the Department’s Veterans 
Integration to Academic Leadership, or 
VITAL program. VITAL is designed to 
support student veterans in their aca-
demic settings, and it is a key compo-
nent of VA’s work to ensure that vet-
erans thrive after completing their 
military service.

opportunity to examine outcomes for 
student veterans and academic institu-
tions supported by VA. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 5516, the VITAL Assessment 
Act, as amended, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5516, as amended, the VITAL 
Assessment Act. 
This bill is sponsored by, as was said, 
our newest member of the Veterans’ 
Affairs Committee, Congressman JAKE 
ELLZEY. With this bill, he is fulfilling 
the promise he made on the campaign 
trail to put the needs of our fellow vet-
erans front and center. His bill will 
make a number of improvements to the 
VA’s Veterans Integration to Academic 
Learning, or the VITAL program. 
VITAL provides mental health sup-
port to student veterans on college 
campuses. Preventing veteran suicide 
and supporting veterans as they transi-
tion out of the military are two of our 
committee’s highest goals, and this bill 
would get us closer to realizing both of 
them. 
I urge every Member to support H.R. 
5516, as amended, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ELLZEY), the main sponsor of this 
legislation. 
Mr. ELLZEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member BOST
for yielding 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to be ad-
dressing the House today as we are just 
days removed from Veterans Day, when 
our Nation recognizes those who honor-
ably served to protect our precious, 
God-given liberties and freedoms. We 
have a duty and responsibility to help 
the veterans of our Armed Forces who 
have fought to preserve our freedoms 
and liberties. 
In 2011, VA launched the Veterans In-
tegration to Academic Leadership pro-
gram, or the VITAL program, to pro-
vide mental health services to student 
veterans on college campuses. 
Hundreds of thousands of veterans 
attend college every year. They often 
have difficulty adjusting from the mili-
tary to an academic campus culture 
and relating to nonveteran peers. 
As someone who has personally gone 
through the transition back to civilian 
life, I can say my experiences in com-
bat and leadership were vastly dif-
ferent than the experiences of my fel-
low students. I was much older than 
my fellow students; much older. I was 
no longer surrounded by my fellow 
warriors; and I was a stranger in a 
strange academic land. For these rea-
sons, I understand why the VITAL pro-
gram is so important. 
Since its inception in 2011, it has 
grown to support student veterans at 
183 locations. VITAL program services 
are locally managed, staffed, and eval-
uated by VA medical centers working 
with area schools, which allows for 
independence and flexibility. It con-
nects student veterans with needed 
care and services, and helps prevent 
veteran suicide. 
The VITAL Assessment Act will en-
sure critical information about the 
VITAL program is gathered, improve-
ments are made, and will help provide 
mental healthcare and support to stu-
dent veterans. 
This act adds accountability and 
transparency. It will require the VA to 
report to Congress about the program’s 
management, operations, and effective-
ness in support of student veterans’ 
mental health and educational goals. 
It also requires the VA to use infor-
mation gathered to create best new 
practices, 
goals, 
and 
performance 
measures for the program. 
In conclusion, I thank the many vet-
erans’ groups supporting this bill. 
I am grateful to House Committee on 
Veterans’ 
Affairs 
Ranking 
Member 
BOST for being an original cosponsor of 
this bill. 
And I thank Chairman TAKANO for 
supporting this bill and speaking favor-
ably during the committee hearing; 
Health Subcommittee Chair BROWNLEY, 
and the members of the Veterans’ Af-
fairs Committee for their unanimous 
support of this bill. 
This 
will 
help 
student 
veterans 
achieve their goals and dreams. And 
just as the VITAL program has a prov-
en record of saving lives, this bill will 
further improve the program and help 
save even more lives of veterans. 
I ask all Members of the House to 
please support H.R. 5516. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time.

BURN PIT REGISTRY 
ENHANCEMENT ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to

(H.R. 2433) to direct the Secretary of 
Veterans Affairs to take actions nec-
essary to ensure that certain individ-
uals may update the burn pit registry 
with a registered individual’s cause of 
death, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 2433 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in

This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Burn Pit 
Registry Enhancement Act’’. 
SEC. 2. BURN PIT REGISTRY UPDATES. 
(a) INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE TO UPDATE.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 180 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall take 
actions necessary to ensure that the burn pit 
registry may be updated with the cause of 
death of a deceased registered individual 
by— 
(A) an individual designated by such de-
ceased registered individual; or 
(B) if no such individual is designated, an 
immediate family member of such deceased 
registered individual.

vide, with respect to the burn pit registry, a 
process by which a registered individual may 
make a designation for purposes of para-

(1) The term ‘‘burn pit registry’’ means the 
registry established under section 201 of the 
Dignified Burial and Other Veterans’ Bene-
fits Improvement Act of 2012 (Public Law 
112–260; 38 U.S.C. 527 note). 
(2) The term ‘‘immediate family member’’,

respect 
to 
a 
deceased 
individual, 
means— 
(A) the spouse, parent, brother, sister, or 
adult child of the individual; 
(B) an adult person to whom the individual 
stands in loco parentis; or 
(C) any other adult person— 
(i) living in the household of the individual 
at the time of the death of the individual; 
and 
(ii) related to the individual by blood or 
marriage. 
(3) The term ‘‘registered individual’’ means 
an individual registered with the burn pit 
registry.

may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to

There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield

Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the 
passage of Representative RUIZ’s Burn 
Pit Registry Enhancement Act. 
As the House Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs and our Senate counter-
parts close in on providing much-need-
ed, comprehensive assistance to vet-
erans exposed to burn pits and other 
airborne hazards, this measure from 
Dr. RUIZ is an important step in the 
right direction.

that burn pit and other airborne hazard

exposures have on our veterans, the 
collection of data is critical. Without 
data, important patterns are not iden-
tified, and decisive conclusions cannot 
be made. 
This bill ensures that VA researchers 
and their partners will have more in-
formation to evaluate as they strive 
toward final determinations on issues 
and additional presumptive service- 
connected conditions. 
VA’s burn pit registry is for veterans 
and servicemembers who may have 
been 
exposed 
to 
airborne 
hazards 
caused by open burn pits while de-
ployed in support of Operations Desert 
Storm, Desert Shield, New Dawn, Iraqi 
Freedom, 
or 
Enduring 
Freedom. 
Through this registry, veterans may 
report on their symptoms or illnesses, 
providing researchers with invaluable 
information used to determine poten-
tial links between veterans’ exposures 
and their current health conditions. 
The Burn Pit Registry Enhancement 
Act will strengthen this registry by au-
thorizing a designee of a registered vet-
eran or an immediate family member 
to update the registry with the vet-
eran’s cause of death. 
While this additional information 
can no longer assist those who sadly 
pass away as a potential consequence 
of burn pit exposure, their cause of 
death data may someday assist their 
fellow veterans. This will be an honor-
able and incredibly valuable last act of 
service. 
So, Mr. Speaker, I strongly support 
the passage of the Burn Pit Registry 
Enhancement Act, H.R. 2433, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 2433, the Burn Pit Registry En-
hancement Act. This bill is cospon-
sored by Congressmen RAUL RUIZ from 
California and BRAD WENSTRUP from 
Ohio. Dr. RUIZ and Dr. WENSTRUP are 
co-chairs of the House Burn Pit Cau-
cus. I thank them for their work on 
this bill and continued advocacy on be-
half of the veterans exposed to burn 
pits. 
Many servicemembers and veterans 
are grappling with serious health con-
ditions that they believe are the result 
of the burn pit exposures. That is why 
Congress required VA to create an Air-
borne Hazards and Open Burn Pit Reg-
istry in 2013. 
The registry was intended to provide 
a forum for servicemembers and vet-
erans to document their burn pit expo-
sures and health status so that the VA 
could better target research and out-
reach. The registry continues to be an 
important tool for veterans worried 
about burn pit and other toxic or envi-
ronmental exposures. 
Last Congress, two important stake-
holders, Burn Pits 360 and VFW, rec-
ommended family members be allowed 
to update the registry in the event of 
the death of a servicemember or vet-
eran listed on it. This would ensure 
that the registry contains a more com-
plete picture of the possible effects of 
burn pit exposure. This bill would do 
that. 
When a servicemember or a veteran 
listed in the registry passes away, it 
would 
allow 
an 
immediate 
family 
member to report their death and 
cause of death to the registry. 
As ranking member, improving the 
care and benefits provided to veterans 
who have experienced toxic exposure 
continues to be one of my top prior-
ities. There have been bipartisan bills 
introduced in the House and Senate 
this Congress. One of those bills is my 
bill, the TEAM Act. 
And last week, VA announced some 
new initiatives aimed at improving the 
presumptive process for toxic-exposed 
veterans. I still have many outstanding 
questions about that announcement, 
and am concerned by the stalled legis-
lative efforts of the Democrat-con-
trolled Congress. 
Toxic-exposed veterans are sick and 
dying. We cannot let burn pits, PFAS, 
or particulate matters become this 
generation’s Agent Orange. We cannot 
fail to take proactive action on behalf 
of 
the 
future 
generations 
of 
warfighters. 
I hope that we can soon come to-
gether in the House and the Senate in 
a bipartisan manner to take meaning-
ful, fiscally responsible, and scientif-
ically sound action to address toxic ex-
posures. In the meantime, I am pleased 
to support this bill today, and hope it 
has the support of all of my colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-

(H.R. 4626) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to require an independent

tems and management processes of the

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
4626, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4626, as amended, the VA As-
sessment 
by 
Independent 
Measures 
Act, or VA AIM Act. 
This bill would require the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs to contract 
with one or more private-sector enti-
ties to conduct independent assess-
ments of its healthcare delivery sys-
tems and management processes once 
every 10 years. 
This bill would make permanent an 
independent assessment process that is 
nearly identical to the one that was 
mandated by the Veterans Access, 
Choice, and Accountability Act of 2014. 
Among other things, the 
review 
would 
examine 
VA 
patient 
demo-
graphics and healthcare needs now and 
in the future; the accuracy and reli-
ability of the models used to project 
VA’s healthcare budget; veterans’ ac-
cess to healthcare through community 
providers and other Federal facilities; 
VA’s healthcare appointment sched-
uling processes; and VA’s process for 
determining its staffing needs and re-
cruiting and retaining clinical staff. 
I am pleased that Ranking Member 
BOST
and 
Representative 
BERGMAN 
were open to incorporating my feed-
back when this bill was considered by 
our committee this summer. We added 
a provision to the bill that requires VA 
to submit to Congress a report out-
lining the feasibility and advisability 
of implementing any recommendations 
made through these independent as-
sessments. This will help us hold the 
Department accountable for improving 
its delivery of the healthcare benefits 
our Nation’s veterans have earned.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6283 
November 16, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting H.R. 4626, as 
amended, the VA AIM Act, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4626, as amended, the VA As-
sessment 
by 
Independent 
Measures 
Act, or AIM Act. 
The AIM Act is sponsored by my 
friend and fellow Marine Corps veteran, 
General 
JACK
BERGMAN. 
General 
BERGMAN is the ranking member of the 
Subcommittee on Health, and I thank 
him for his dedication to ensuring that 
the VA is providing good care for each 
one of our Nation’s veterans. 
The AIM Act would require an inde-
pendent 
assessment 
of 
the 
VA 
healthcare system once every decade, 
starting in the year 2025. 
When the VA was in the midst of a 
nationwide access and accountability 
crisis in 2014, Congress passed the 
Choice Act to help right the ship. The 
Choice Act included a provision requir-
ing an independent assessment of the 
VA healthcare system. That led to 
many of the reforms that are occurring 
across the VA system today. Estab-
lishing a mechanism for regular inde-
pendent assessments will ensure that 
the VA continues to improve in the 
decades ahead. 
I appreciate Chairman TAKANO and 
his staff for working with me and Gen-
eral BERGMAN while the AIM Act was 
pending in committee. I hope that this 
bill will have the same level of bipar-
tisan support today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. BERGMAN). 
Mr. BERGMAN. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to rise today in support of my 
bill, H.R. 4626, as amended, the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs Assessment 
by Independent Measures Act, or AIM 
Act. 
When it comes to bureaucracies, I 
have never believed that maintaining 
the status quo is an acceptable path 
forward. In fact, it is an impossible 
path forward. 
The world is constantly in a state of 
change. The way American men and 
women defend freedom around the 
world, and the way those same men 
and women seek care when they come 
home, is constantly changing as well. 
The 
VA 
healthcare 
system 
must 
change, too, or it will never fulfill its 
obligations to all of our veterans. 
That is where the AIM Act comes in. 
The AIM Act would require an inde-
pendent assessment of the operations 
and management of the VA healthcare 
system once every decade, beginning in 
2025. 
The independent assessment frame-
work in the AIM Act is modeled after 
the independent assessment that was 
required in the Choice Act, which was 
signed into law in 2014 following the 
nationwide VA access and account-
ability crisis that saw some veterans 
literally dying on VA facilities’ wait-
ing lists. 
That independent assessment was 
completed in 2015, and the findings and 
recommendations it contained directly 
underpinned many of the necessary im-
provements that have occurred in the 
VA healthcare system since then. 
The AIM Act would ensure that this 
successful model is not a one-and-done 
but instead regularly recurs to ensure 
that the VA keeps improving for vet-
erans long into the future. 
I am grateful for the support the AIM 
Act has received from veterans service 
organizations, particularly the Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, the Wounded 
Warrior Project, and the Minority Vet-
erans of America. 
I am also grateful for the bipartisan 
support the AIM Act received in the 
Veterans’ Affairs Committee. I thank 
all of my colleagues for that. I hope 
that there will be a similar show of bi-
partisan support for the bill today. My 
fellow veterans have earned it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
this important piece of legislation, 
H.R. 4626, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4626, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
PROTECTIONS FOR STUDENT 
VETERANS ACT 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5603) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to establish protections 
for a member of the Armed Forces who 
leaves a course of education, paid for 
with certain educational assistance, to 
perform certain service, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

resentatives of the United States of America in

SEC. 4. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EF-
FECTS. 
The budgetary effects of this Act, for the 
purpose of complying with the Statutory 
Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall be deter-
mined by reference to the latest statement 
titled ‘‘Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legisla-
tion’’ for this Act, submitted for printing in 
the Congressional Record by the Chairman of 
the House Budget Committee, provided that 
such statement has been submitted prior to 
the vote on passage. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 5603, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5603, as amended, the Protec-
tions for Student Veterans Act, intro-
duced by Representative UNDERWOOD. 
This bill amends the Servicemembers 
Civil Relief Act, which provides broad 
protections for Active Duty, reservist, 
and National Guard servicemembers 
during deployments. 
H.R. 5603, as amended, enhances pro-
tections for members of the Armed 
Forces who must suspend their edu-
cation to fulfill military orders. 
Many States, including Illinois and 
Washington, have stronger student pro-
tections for servicemembers than those 
that exist at the Federal level. There 
are currently few Federal protections 
for members of the armed services who 
are enrolled in higher education when 
they receive Active Duty orders. These 
servicemembers can be held liable to 
repay tuition and may also receive fail-
ing or incomplete grades as a result of 
suspending their education for military 
duty. 
I hope we can all agree that this is an 
unfair penalty to those members of the 
Armed Forces who are preparing for 
their future through education while 
also serving our country. 
The protections proposed in this bill 
would cover unexpected withdrawals 
due to military orders and can provide 
restoration of benefits and reimburse-
ments for classes. 
This bill takes the best practices 
from around the country to make sure 
student veterans aren’t left with debts 
or incomplete classes outside their 
control due to military orders. 
This legislation is supported by nu-
merous VSOs, including Student Vet-
erans of America. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI and Leader 
HOYER for bringing this legislation to 
the floor, and I urge the rest of my col-
leagues to support this legislation to 
protect GI Bill benefits for service-
members fulfilling their duty to our 
country. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 5603, as amended, the Protec-
tions for Student Veterans Act. 
This bill would protect student vet-
erans who have to withdraw from a 
course of education under the GI Bill if 
they are called up for Active Duty or 
for training. This change would protect 
students from receiving a poor grade or 
an incomplete while they are doing 
their job to protect this country. 
The change proposed in this bill is 
needed, and it has my full support. 
I am also pleased that this bill, as 
amended, includes the text of Congress-
man CAWTHORN’s bill, H.R. 4874, the Fly 
Vets Act. His bill would close a long-
standing loophole that allows public 
flight training schools to charge an un-
limited amount in tuition and fees for 
GI Bill students. 
This bill would allow students to uti-
lize a revolutionary accelerated tuition 
and fee model that would provide twice 
the amount of tuition and fees per

month for 2 months of eligibility. This 
is commonsense legislation that would 
protect both the student veteran and 
the taxpayer. 
I thank Congressman CAWTHORN for 
his hard work on this bill. I also thank 
Congressmen WENSTRUP and LEVIN for 
their work on this bill in previous Con-
gresses. I hope that this year we can 
get this needed change across the fin-
ish line. 
While we are talking about the GI 
Bill, I would like to take a few minutes 
to discuss another matter. At least at 
the start of the pandemic, we worked 
on a bipartisan effort to ensure that 
student veterans’ GI Bill housing al-
lowance payments are not cut when 
their in-person classes converted to on-
line learning due to COVID–19. The cur-
rent authorization expires on Decem-
ber 21, 2021. 
Chairman TAKANO and Congressman 
TRONE are advocating for a bill that ex-
tends this protection, but it is not paid 
for. Instead, it relies on emergency 
spending to cover the more than $200 
million mandatory score associated 
with the bill. I believe that is too high 
of a cost to consider through emer-
gency spending and must insist that we 
offset the extension. 
To that end, I introduced a bill that 
would achieve the policy objective but 
pay for the cost of the bill with a regu-
larly used offset. 
My bill also includes changes that 
are needed to ensure that GI Bill stu-
dents can attend foreign schools. It 
would also give U.S. schools time to 
comply with the new reporting require-
ments passed last Congress. 
A coalition of 18 higher education 
groups has advocated for these changes 
for several months and support my pro-
posal. They understand that if these 
changes are not made soon, many 
schools will be forced to stop accepting 
students who are using the GI Bill. 
I understand the chairman has re-
cently received a letter from the chan-
cellor of the University of California at 
Riverside, who agrees that this pro-
posal must be offset. 
Chancellor Kim A. Wilcox wrote that 
by passing the bill without an offset, 
we would be ‘‘no closer to a resolution 
on this critical issue.’’ 
The letter goes on to say that passing 
a bill out of the House without an off-
set ‘‘will jeopardize UCR’s ability to 
continue to serve our veteran stu-
dents.’’ 
The chancellor also stated that this 
fall UC Riverside supported hundreds of 
military-connected students, including 
about 179 veterans who could be im-
pacted by inaction. 
Unless I am mistaken, UC Riverside 
is in Chairman TAKANO’s district. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
the letter from Chancellor Wilcox. 
UC RIVERSIDE, 
OFFICE OF THE CHANCELLOR, 
Riverside, CA, November 12, 2021. 
Hon. MARK TAKANO, 
U.S. Representative, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE TAKANO: I under-
stand that you are planning to bring H.R. 
5545, the Responsible Education Mitigating 
Options 
and 
Technical 
Extensions 
(RE-
MOTE) Act, up for a vote in the House next 
week. The bill includes critical technical 
corrections 
to 
address 
unintended 
con-
sequences stemming from several provisions 
in the Isakson Roe Act and the Training in 
High-Demand Roles to Improve Veteran Em-
ployment (THRIVE) Act that went into ef-
fect on August 1, 2021. The bill would also ex-
tend 
certain 
COVID-related 
flexibilities 
granted to the Secretary of the Department 
of Veterans Affairs (VA) in the wake of the 
pandemic. 
As the bill is currently written, however, it 
does not include an offset for the approxi-
mately $200 million cost for the extension of 
COVID–19 flexibilities. I am deeply con-
cerned that without the inclusion of an off-
set, the bill will not be able to pass the Sen-
ate by unanimous consent and we will be no 
closer to a resolution on this critical issue. 
During the Fall of 2021, UC Riverside 
served 179 Veterans, 37 Reservists, 11 Na-
tional Guard, and 15 Active Duty self-identi-
fied members of the U.S. military branches. 
Designated as a ‘‘Military Spouse Friendly’’ 
campus, UCR served over 350 dependents, and 
have utilized over $6M in Veterans benefits. 
Without an offset for the extension of 
COVID–19 flexibilities, it will jeopardize 
UCR’s ability to continue to serve our Vet-
eran Students, due to the compliance issues 
that require fixes. I would also urge you to 
include language to modify VA’s current 
‘‘rounding out’’ rule to ensure that more vet-
erans can maintain full-time benefits during 
the last term of their program. 
I respectfully request that your staff work 
to pass bipartisan legislation next week that 
addresses these concerns and can be quickly 
passed through both chambers and signed 
into law. 
Sincerely, 
KIM A. WILCOX, 
Chancellor. 
b 1300 
Mr. BOST. At our full committee 
markup 2 weeks ago, I urged Chairman 
TAKANO to work with me and our Sen-
ate colleagues to find a way forward on 
the offset issue on a bipartisan basis. 
However, last week I was told that 
Congressman TRONE’s bill would be on 
the slate of bills, but the cost would 
not be offset. I registered my concern 
and was glad to see that the un-offset 
bill will not be considered under sus-
pension of the rules today. 
I do understand, however, that the 
majority intends to take Congressman 
TRONE’s bill to the Rules Committee 
the week after next and pass it out of 
the House un-offset through a rule. 
Let me be clear, I support the policy, 
but I believe the cost of the bill must 
be offset. Schools like UC Riverside 
clearly agree with me. Even if the 
Democrats are able to get Congressman 
TRONE’s un-offset bill through the 
House—and that is a big ‘‘if’’—I don’t 
believe that they can pass it in the 
Senate by unanimous consent. 
It is the responsibility of the leaders 
of our committee to solve this issue so 
that the bill can quickly make it to the 
President’s desk. Although the chair-
man may not like it, my approach is 
the only way to get this done in time 
to help students in a fiscally respon-
sible manner. 
The higher education community has 
told us that this extension needs to be 
enacted by Thanksgiving. I think we 
can see that under the majority’s cur-
rent plan, the deadline will be missed. 
After Thanksgiving we have only 9 leg-
islative days left before these protec-
tions expire. We are simply running 
out of time. 
I do not have a preference for wheth-
er we take up my bill or amend Con-
gressman TRONE’s bill to include the 
offset, but I urge the chairman to come 
back to reality and stop playing polit-
ical games with it so that we can en-
sure that student veterans are pro-
tected in a fiscally sound manner. 
At the very least, I would advise the 
chairman not to let this inaction im-
pact thousands of student veterans 
across the country, including the 179 
right there in his own district. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I am distressed that the ranking 
member has chosen this particular mo-
ment to inject comments about the 
REMOTE Act, sponsored by the gen-
tleman from Maryland (Mr. TRONE), 
and to imply that there is obstruction 
in taking action to help our veterans, 
our student veterans, with their hous-
ing allowances—which we took action 
on during the pandemic, which still we 
are not completely out of yet. I would 
argue that we are still in a national 
emergency. We are seeing COVID infec-
tions rise in Europe, and we are seeing 
vaccine resistance and hesitancy in 
many parts of the country, which still 
necessitate the need for a policy which 
allows for student veterans to still get 
their housing allowances while they 
are taking classes virtually. 
I will remind the minority that three 
times under the Trump administration, 
we passed something like the REMOTE 
Act, the authority to allow student 
veterans to receive their housing al-
lowances while taking virtual classes. 
They were not in residence at the 
school where they would do in-person 
learning. We allowed this three times 
under emergency spending. Why? Be-
cause emergency spending fits the mo-
ment. And it still fits the moment. 
This nonsense about we have to pay for 
something that should be an emer-
gency is nonsense. 
I recall times on this floor when we 
had Members arguing that we should 
not pay for the damage done for hurri-
canes in one State because it didn’t 
happen to the rest of the States, that 
we need to find a pay-for for hurricane 
damage in this country and for certain 
other kinds of natural disasters. 
A pandemic is a type of natural dis-
aster. In this case, it has killed 700,000 
Americans. I would argue that we 
saved lives, and we relieved a lot of suf-
fering of our veterans who would have 
been turned out in the streets if we did 
not give them this housing allowance. 
And now at the eleventh hour when 
we intended to bring Representative 
TRONE’s bill to the floor, suddenly we 
had to meet a pay-for demand of the

minority, and to set a precedent for fu-
ture disasters that we would have to 
have this very argument. 
Instead of the precedent being that 
we spend emergency funds for emer-
gency situations, we now are in a situ-
ation where the minority is arguing a 
ridiculous ideological argument about 
how we pay for things during a time of 
a national emergency. 
I am disappointed that the minority 
has brought up its objections and also 
sought to use my University of Cali-
fornia, Riverside as part of this pawn. I 
just received a message from my chan-
cellor correcting the position that they 
took on their public letter. They are 
the only university to submit such a 
detailed letter regarding the pay-for. 
No other university has sought to take 
that position. I have questions as to 
how my university reached a point 
where they issued such a letter so that 
it could be used on the floor. I now 
have a correction that was issued to 
me just hours before. 
This is about America’s veterans, and 
this is about serving America’s vet-
erans during an emergency situation in 
which 700,000 Americans have already 
died. I want to keep those veterans 
safe. I want to keep them in housing. 
And, yes, I believe it is appropriate to 
keep the precedent of using emergency 
funding and not have this silly polit-
ical gamesmanship over the pay-for. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, paying for 
something and doing the job that we 
are supposed to be doing here is not po-
litical gamesmanship. 
I said in my statement that I believe 
that we must continue to provide for 
these veterans, but it is our fiduciary 
duty to do it in the correct way. That 
is what I am asking for. I am also ask-
ing for it because that way we know it 
will move through the Senate and work 
in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to 
try to move it forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
will just reply that it is political 
gamesmanship. I hate seeing univer-
sities used as pawns in this game. I 
hate seeing our student veterans being 
used as pawns. 
What is at stake here is the principle, 
the precedent that this Congress will 
pay for emergencies out of emergency 
funding. The need to help our veterans, 
who must take their classes remotely, 
pay for their housing because of the na-
tional emergency that we are still in, 
is part of a precedent that we need to 
preserve. 
This is not a political game to me. 
This is about protecting our veterans. 
This is about protecting our Nation in 
the future. 
The idea that when a national dis-
aster, whether it occurs in the form of 
a hurricane, an earthquake, or some 
other calamity like a pandemic that 
has killed 700,000 Americans, that the 
principle stands that that is an emer-
gency and that we as a Nation stand 
together as one American from what-
ever State we are in to help an Amer-
ican in another State, even though 
that disaster didn’t happen in that 
State. But this disaster was omni-
present throughout our country. I 
don’t understand the logic. 
Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support the un-
derlying bill that was discussed. I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
this very important legislation, H.R. 
5603, as amended, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5603, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on S. 796. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 796, the Protecting Moms Who 
Served Act of 2021, sponsored by Sen-
ator TAMMY
DUCKWORTH. The House 
companion to this bill, H.R. 958, was 
championed by the gentlewoman from 
Illinois (Ms. UNDERWOOD) and unani-
mously passed the House this past 
May. 
The Protecting Moms Who Served 
Act of 2021 will codify the maternity 
care coordination program that the 
Veterans Health Administration first 
established in 2012 and updated in a No-
vember 2020 policy directive. This will 
help ensure that veterans across the 
Nation receive high-quality, culturally 
competent healthcare throughout their 
pregnancies and immediately after-
ward. 
The majority of veterans’ maternity 
care is delivered by a contracted net-
work of non-VA community providers. 
However, many veterans have coexist-
ing medical or mental health condi-
tions for which they receive ongoing 
care from VA providers. This means it 
is absolutely critical to ensure preg-
nant veterans’ care is coordinated 
among all healthcare professionals in-
volved in it. Such information sharing 
is crucial for patient safety and posi-
tive health outcomes—for parents and 
newborns. 
In addition to codifying VA’s mater-
nity care coordination program, S. 796 
will require the Department to provide 
training for community providers on 
the unique needs of pregnant and 
postpartum veterans and on behavioral 
health conditions related to service in 
the Armed Forces. 
Today, women veterans are the fast-
est growing cohort in the veteran popu-
lation, and more than 40 percent of 
women veterans using VA healthcare 
are of reproductive age. Black women 
serve in higher numbers and represent 
nearly one-third of women using VA 
for their healthcare. 
In the population at large, Black, 
American Indian, and Alaska Native 
moms die from pregnancy-related com-
plications 
at 
approximately 
three 
times the rate of White, Latina, Asian 
American, and Pacific Islander women, 
regardless of income or education lev-
els. 
However, 
little 
is 
known 
about 
whether pregnant and postpartum vet-
erans have better, worse, or equal rates 
of maternal mortality compared to 
nonveterans. That is why S. 796 also 
mandates a U.S. Government Account-
ability Office study on maternal mor-
tality and morbidity among pregnant 
and postpartum veterans, with a par-
ticular focus on racial and ethnic dis-
parities in maternal health outcomes 
for veterans. 
Last year, approximately 6,000 vet-
erans using VA became new moms. 
Moms who have served our Nation ex-
emplify strength and resilience. Sup-
porting moms means ensuring gender 
equity, and that begins with healthcare 
equity. I therefore ask my colleagues 
to join me in supporting final passage 
of S. 796, the Protecting Moms Who 
Served Act of 2021. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
796, the Protecting Moms Who Served 
Act. 
This bill would require VA to im-
prove the care that is provided to vet-
erans who are pregnant. More and more 
women are volunteering to serve in the 
military and seeking services from VA 
as veterans. 
As they grow their families, VA must 
provide them with high-quality, easy- 
to-access, pre- and postpartum care. 
Strengthening services to women 
veterans is one of my priorities as the 
lead Republican on this committee, 
and I am proud to help do that by sup-
porting this bill today. 
I 
thank 
Illinois 
Senator 
TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH for sponsoring this bill on 
behalf of our fellow veterans. I urge my 
colleagues to support it today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers. I am prepared to 
close, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill. I 
yield back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6288 
November 16, 2021 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
this important piece of legislation, S. 
796, the Protecting Moms Who Served 
Act of 2021, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to 
speak in strong support of the bipartisan legis-
lation, Protecting Moms Who Served Act. 
But before I do, I want to thank Congress-
woman LAUREN UNDERWOOD for her leader-
ship on this bill. I would also like to thank Sen-
ator DUCKWORTH and Representatives JULIA 
BROWNLEY, 
GUS
BILIRAKIS, 
and 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK for their co-leadership. 
Together, 
Congresswoman 
UNDERWOOD 
and I are the co-founders and co-chairs of the 
Black Maternal Health Caucus, as well as lead 
sponsors of the Momnibus—comprehensive 
legislation that addresses every dimension of 
the maternal health crisis in the United States. 
And it gives me great joy to say that the 
Protecting Moms Who Served Act will be the 
first bill of the Momnibus to pass in Congress. 
The United States continues to have the 
highest maternal mortality rates in the devel-
oped world. Women and birthing people of 
color die during or after pregnancy at 3 to 4 
times the rates of their White counterparts. 
For the nearly 2 million women Veterans, 
maternal health outcomes are not any better. 
Pregnant and postpartum women who served 
face unique maternal health risks that deserve 
our attention. 
For example, the risk of pregnancy com-
plications may be higher for women Veterans 
receiving maternity care through Veterans Af-
fairs, since these women frequently have mul-
tiple medical conditions that can increase 
pregnancy complications. 
Furthermore, it is suggested that military de-
ployment may increase the risk of post-trau-
matic stress disorder or PTSD. A post-trau-
matic stress disorder diagnosis can increase 
the 
risk 
of 
spontaneous 
pre-term 
birth, 
preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes. 
Women Veterans with more symptoms of 
PTSD or moral injury like shame, guilt, or de-
moralization, are also at greater risk for 
postpartum depression in the three years fol-
lowing the end of their military service. 
More specifically a study on the impacts of 
PTSD or moral injury, found that one in two 
women Veterans who became pregnant during 
the study, had a negative pregnancy outcome. 
These outcomes include postpartum depres-
sion or anxiety, miscarriage, obstetrical med-
ical conditions, emergency c-sections, the 
baby’s need for intensive care post-delivery, 
preterm birth, stillbirth, and ectopic or tubal 
pregnancy. 
Our women Veterans have upheld their duty 
to serve and protect and, we as Members of 
Congress must do the same. 
The Protecting Moms Who Served Act bill 
will codify and strengthen the Department of 
Veterans Affairs maternity care coordination 
programs to ensure Veterans receive the high- 
quality maternal health care and support they 
have earned. 
This is a noteworthy advancement since 
maternity care coordination programs are as-
sociated with improved maternal and birth out-
comes, increased use of beneficial health 
services, and decreased costs, especially 
among women with chronic or pregnancy-re-
lated physical or mental health conditions, or 
social vulnerabilities. 
Additionally, this bill will commission the 
first-ever comprehensive study of America’s 
maternal health crisis among women Vet-
erans, with a particular emphasis on racial and 
ethnic disparities. 
This study is needed to provide further un-
derstanding of the maternal health challenges 
experienced among women who served. 
On May 12th, this legislation passed the 
house with unanimous bipartisan support. 
Today, we are here to vote once more and 
finally send this bill to the President’s desk, 
changing the lives of millions of women Vet-
erans and their children. 
Let’s remember that strong and supportive 
healthcare for birthing people supports the fu-
ture of our Nation by investing in the well- 
being of children and families. 
And today’s vote ensures a healthcare sys-
tem for women Veterans that will offer the 
best maternal care available. 
I am proud to see our progress towards 
ending maternal mortality and disparities 
among our moms who served. I look forward 
to continuing to address these issues in Con-
gress as we examine and discuss the mater-
nal mortality and morbidity issues that threaten 
our Nation. 
To all my colleagues—lets pass the Pro-
tecting Moms Who Served Act for our women 
Veterans, their children, and their families. 
What we do here today will live beyond our 
time in Congress and impact generations of 
women who serve. 
It is time we make sure that Veterans, who 
have done so much for our country, receive 
the support and resources they need. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 796. 
The question was taken.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6289 
November 16, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 4233, the Student Veterans 
Counseling Centers Eligibility Act. 
This bill would allow student vet-
erans to access readjustment coun-
seling and peer support services at vet 
centers. 
Student veterans have unique needs 
and stressors. This bill would help 
them get the support they require to 
thrive in school and in their post-mili-
tary lives. 
I am grateful to my good friend and 
committee colleague, Dr. GREG MUR-
PHY, for introducing this bill. I thank 
him for his leadership on behalf of stu-
dent veterans, and I am confident this 
bill would benefit them for generations 
to come. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge every one of my 
colleagues to support H.R. 4233 today. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MURPHY), the sponsor of this bill. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in support of my 
bipartisan bill, H.R. 4233, the Student 
Veterans 
Counseling 
Centers 
Eligi-
bility Act. 
The issue to which I will speak is ex-
ceedingly personal to me and my dis-
trict, as I represent close to 90,000 vet-
erans, most of whom are or will be re-
ceiving benefits via the Post-9/11 GI 
Bill or the Montgomery GI Bill. 
The transition from Active Duty to 
civilian life can be challenging for 
some of our servicemembers. It can be 
tremendously difficult for many of our 
servicemembers to return to education 
after sacrificing so much for our Na-
tion abroad. This is especially true for 
older and nontraditional student vet-
erans. 
A few months ago, alongside Ranking 
Member BOST, I had the privilege of in-
troducing the Student Veterans Coun-
seling Centers Eligibility Act. It passed 
out of the Veterans’ Affairs Committee 
with a unanimous vote. 
Our Nation’s veterans represent the 
very best among us here in the United 
States, but many serve at great per-
sonal cost. A recent RAND study re-
ported that 20 percent of veterans on 
the GI Bill experience feelings of de-
pression or PTSD. That 20 percent 
amounts to over 170,000 veterans, which 
is almost double the number I men-
tioned previously of the veterans I rep-
resent in my district. 
As one can imagine, serving as a 
member of our Armed Forces can be ex-
tremely stressful. Too often, we see the 
tragedy of our veterans losing their 
battle with mental health issues when 
returning from service. A very tragic 
and somber fact is that the VA cur-
rently estimates 18 veterans a day 
commit suicide. In fact, 46 percent of 
our military students report suicidal 
thoughts compared to only 6 percent of 
their nonmilitary peers. 
If we can provide mental health serv-
ices to assist just a single veteran who 
is struggling, then I believe it is our 
sworn duty to do so. We have the op-
portunity now with the Student Vet-
erans Counseling Centers Eligibility 
Act. 
Education poses one of the most ben-
eficial yet stressful areas of transition 
for our veterans. The intention of this 
bill is to aid more of our veterans who 
are readjusting to civilian lives while 
providing overdue access to vital men-
tal health resources. 
Helping veterans succeed in their 
education and civilian lives is one of 
the most important ways we can thank 
them for their service. 
I have spoken with some of these stu-
dent veterans. I have heard their sto-
ries. These student veterans have had 
to wait weeks to even months for a 
mental health appointment if their 
mental health crisis was not deemed 
urgent. Unfortunately, many of our 
veterans do not have the luxury of 
weeks or months to wait to see a men-
tal health provider. 
Furthermore, private mental health 
can be inaccessible for those not uti-
lizing the benefits of the GI Bill. An av-
erage therapy session could cost be-
tween $60 to $120, with the higher end 
reaching over $250 per session. Even 
with health insurance, premiums often 
can be $50 per session. 
The Student Veterans Counseling 
Centers Eligibility Act would provide 
expanded counseling and mental health 
services to those student veterans 
through the VA’s Readjustment Coun-
seling Centers, known as vet centers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman an additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I am extremely honored and 
proud to sponsor this bill, and I am 
grateful to Ranking Member BOST for 
his support as an original cosponsor 
and to all of my Republican and Demo-
cratic colleagues who have come to-
gether to support this very critical bi-
partisan legislation. 
I am also thankful to the Student 
Veterans of America for their support. 
I ask all Members for bipartisan sup-
port. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
of my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 4233, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6290 
November 16, 2021 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 147, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 147, the Bringing Registered 
Apprenticeships to Veterans Education 
Act, or BRAVE Act, as amended. 
This bill increases access to informa-
tion regarding registered apprentice-
ships for veterans. Registered appren-
ticeships are an important component 
of our workforce system. They provide 
on-the-job training with an employer 
that teaches workers the practical and 
theoretical skills they need to succeed 
in a field, all while earning a paycheck. 
The Department of Labor validates 
registered apprenticeships to ensure 
that participants are receiving high- 
quality instruction and training. 
At the end of their program, appren-
tices receive a national, industry-rec-
ognized credential in their field. 
This bill would require the Depart-
ment of Labor to improve access to 
registered 
apprenticeships 
for 
transitioning servicemembers and vet-
erans by maintaining a searchable 
website that connects them with em-
ployer programs that are endorsed by 
VSOs 
and 
other 
veteran-specific 
groups. 
Registered apprenticeships provide a 
unique pathway into in-demand, high- 
quality jobs, and the BRAVE Act will 
make it easier for veterans to learn 
and earn when training for their ca-
reers. 
This legislation is supported by nu-
merous VSOs, including Iraq and Af-
ghanistan Veterans of America, Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, and Paralyzed 
Veterans of America. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI and Leader 
HOYER for bringing this legislation to 
the floor, and I urge the rest of my col-
leagues to support this legislation to 
improve employability for veterans 
through apprenticeships. 
I also thank Chairman ADAM SMITH 
of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee, who has agreed to forgo com-
mittee action on H.R. 147, as amended, 
so that it can be considered on the

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON VETERANS’ AFFAIRS, 
Washington, DC, November 15, 2021. 
Hon. ADAM SMITH, 
Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House 
of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. SMITH: I write concerning H.R. 
147 as amended, the Bringing Registered Ap-
prenticeships to Veterans Education Act or 
the BRAVE Act. I appreciate your willing-
ness to work cooperatively on this legisla-
tion. 
I acknowledge that provisions of the bill 
fall within the jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Armed Services under House Rule X, and 
that your Committee will forgo action on 
H.R. 147 to expedite floor consideration. I 
further acknowledge that the inaction of 
your Committee with respect to the bill does 
not waive any future jurisdictional claim 
over the matters contained in the bill that 
fall within your jurisdiction. I will also sup-
port the appointment of Committee on 
Armed Services conferees during any House- 
Senate conference convened on this legisla-
tion. 
Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of 
letters is included in the Congressional 
Record during floor consideration of the bill. 
Thank you again for your cooperation re-
garding the legislation. I look forward to 
continuing to work with you as the measure 
moves through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
MARK TAKANO, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES, 
Washington, DC, November 15, 2021. 
Hon. MARK TAKANO, 
Chairman, Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. TAKANO: I write concerning H.R. 
147 as amended, the Bringing Registered Ap-
prenticeships to Veterans Education Act or 
the BRAVE Act. As a result of your having 
consulted with us on provisions within H.R. 
147 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of 
the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, I forego 
any further consideration of this bill so that 
it may proceed expeditiously to the House 
floor for consideration. 
The Committee on Armed Services takes 
this action with our mutual understanding 
that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 147 
at this time, we do not waive any jurisdic-
tion over subject matter contained in this or 
similar legislation and that our committee 
will be appropriately consulted and involved 
as this bill or similar legislation moves for-
ward so that we may address any remaining 
issues in our jurisdiction. Further, I request 
your support for the appointment of con-
ferees from the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices during any House-Senate conference 
convened on this or related legislation. 
Please place a copy of this letter and your 
response acknowledging our jurisdictional 
interest into the Congressional Record dur-
ing consideration of the measure on the 
House floor. Thank you for the cooperative 
spirit in which you have worked regarding 
this matter and others between our respec-
tive committees. 
Sincerely, 
ADAM SMITH, 
Chairman. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 147, as amended, the BRAVE 
Act. 
Every year, nearly 200,000 servicemen 
and -women transition out of Active 
Duty and into the civilian sector. 
This bill would require the Depart-
ment of Defense to provide information 
on apprenticeship programs to sepa-
rating servicemembers who are prac-
ticing in the Transition Assistance 
Program. 
The BRAVE Act would also require 
the Department of Labor to establish a 
website that includes information on 
national apprenticeships and those ap-
proved for the GI Bill benefits so it is 
readily available to the transitioning 
servicemembers. 
Last month’s unemployment num-
bers showed that while the unemploy-
ment rate for nonveterans decreased, 
the unemployment rate for veterans in-
creased slightly. This is concerning, 
and I am hopeful that improving the 
way that we provide information to our 
veterans about available apprentice-
ships may provide veterans with more 
opportunity for great jobs. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support H.R. 147, as amended, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. NORCROSS), my good friend 
and the author of this legislation. Con-
gressman 
NORCROSS
serves 
on 
the 
House 
Armed 
Services 
Committee; 
Education and Labor Committee; and 
the Science, Space, and Technology 
Committee. 
Mr. 
NORCROSS. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
This 
is 
National 
Apprenticeship 
Week, and what better time for the 
passage of H.R. 147, the BRAVE Act. 
I am a product of a registered appren-
ticeship program and the father of a 
veteran. 
The Bringing Registered Apprentice-
ships to Veterans Education Act, or 
the BRAVE Act, would help those re-
turning veterans find good-paying jobs 
and careers. 
When we send our servicemembers to 
war, we train them and equip them, 
and we give them the skills they need 
to protect and defend the United 
States. We do this because we want 
them to succeed wherever they are 
needed, be it on the battlefield or ren-
dering humanitarian assistance around 
the world. They deserve the same level 
of support when they leave the service 
and transition back to civilian life. 
One of the best ways to help our vets 
transition is by providing them mean-
ingful work opportunities or careers. 
Registered apprenticeships are one of 
the best ways, if not the best way, in 
the history of the United States for 
people to gain those skills. Registered 
apprenticeships allow the returning 
soldier to earn while they learn in-de-
mand skills that are so desperately 
needed for family-sustaining careers. 
Ninety-two percent of those who 
complete a registered apprenticeship 
program stay employed, and the aver-
age salary for graduates is $72,000. That 
is nearly $20,000 more than the average 
college graduate, with no student debt. 
The BRAVE Act will connect vet-
erans to these resources, helping them 
to transition to fulfilling civilian ca-
reers. 
It is fitting that the vote for the 
BRAVE Act takes place during Na-
tional Apprenticeship Week. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
our veterans in their pursuit of a good 
career and a good-paying job by voting 
for the BRAVE Act. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
all of my colleagues to support this

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. BOST) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on H.R. 
3730, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this legisla-
tion, H.R. 3730, sponsored by Mr. 
SABLAN and Mrs. RADEWAGEN, which 
would create an advisory committee on 
veterans living in outlying areas and 
freely associated States, including is-
land territories. 
The advisory committee would have 
a variety of members, including ex-
perts from the covered geographic 
areas. The Secretary will be able to 
consult regularly with, and receive the 
input of, this advisory committee re-
garding the administration of benefits 
and VA programs. Once established, 
the advisory committee will report an-
nually on the needs of the covered vet-
erans and provide much-needed rec-
ommendations. 
This bipartisan legislation is sup-
ported by the American Legion, Vet-
erans of Foreign Wars, Minority Vet-
erans of America, Iraq and Afghanistan 
Veterans of America. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3730, to create a VA advisory 
committee on better serving veterans’ 
needs in the territories. For a number 
of 
Congresses, 
Congresswoman 
RADEWAGEN, 
Congresswoman 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, 
Congressman 
SABLAN, and other delegates from the 
territories have honorably served their 
veterans and constituents. 
Committee staff has traveled with 
many of our delegates and colleagues 
to 
the 
Northern 
Mariana 
Islands, 
American Samoa, and Puerto Rico. We 
have seen firsthand the disparities and 
the difficulties that their veterans face 
when trying to access healthcare and 
benefits from the VA. 
The combination of limited transpor-
tation options, the lack of local re-
sources, the overlapping Federal agen-
cy jurisdictions, and the complexities 
around VA care in neighboring foreign 
nations make the territories different 
from the rest of the Nation and dif-
ficult to work in. 
Unfortunately, the challenges that 
the veterans in the territories face al-
ways seem to slide down to the bottom 
of VA’s priority list. 
While I am generally skeptical of 
new advisory committees, I believe the 
voices of the veterans in the territories 
are not being heard, and I share Con-
gresswoman RADEWAGEN’s and Con-
gressman SABLAN’s goal of elevating 
their needs. 
For those reasons, I support the bill, 
and I encourage my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentleman from the 
Northern 
Mariana 
Islands 
(Mr. 
SABLAN), my good friend and valued 
member of the Committee on Veteran 
Affairs, who serves on the Health Sub-
committee. 
Mr. SABLAN. Mr. Speaker, my bipar-
tisan legislation, H.R. 3730, creates a 
VA 
advisory 
committee 
for 
marginalized veterans living in the 
Marianas, the other United States in-
sular areas, and in the freely associ-
ated States. Veterans in my district, 
especially, and in the other insular 
areas, too, face barriers to VA services 
no vet should be forced to endure. 
In Northern Marianas, there are no 
VA clinics and no Vet Centers. 
Veterans in my district sometimes 
fly 3,700 miles to Hawaii or over 6,000 
miles to California to access VA serv-
ices. And that is why my bill, estab-
lishing a committee to educate the 
Secretary on the obstacles insular area 
veterans face, is so important. 
Each U.S. insular area and each of 
the freely associated States would have 
a seat on the advisory committee. Each 
would be able to describe the barriers 
their veterans face in receiving VA 
services. 
Establishing an advisory committee 
will not solve every logistical problem 
for veterans who live in geographically 
remote areas of America, but at least 
those veterans on the margins will 
have a way to communicate directly 
with the Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
And when the Secretary hears about 
the barriers to service these insular 
veterans face, maybe, just maybe, 
change will occur. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Minority 
Veterans of America, the Veterans of 
Foreign Wars, American Legion, and 
the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of 
America for their support of this bipar-
tisan bill, H.R. 3730. 
I 
also 
thank 
Chairman 
TAKANO, 
Ranking 
Member 
BOST, 
Congress-
woman RADEWAGEN, and my fellow 
members of the Committee on Vet-
erans Affairs for their unanimous sup-
port to report my bill favorably to the 
House of Representatives. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to 
support H.R. 3730 to give marginalized 
veterans in the insular areas a voice in 
the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
Mr. BOST. Mr. Speaker, I encourage 
my colleagues to support this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask all 
my colleagues to join me in passing 
H.R. 3730, as amended, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3730, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered.

ther proceedings on this motion are

(B) An assessment of the capacity of the De-
partment of Homeland Security to procure the 
following items from domestic sources: 
(i) Personal protective equipment and other 
items necessary to respond to a pandemic such 
as that caused by COVID–19.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CORREA) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN 
DREW) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and to in-
clude extraneous material on this 
measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2915, the Homeland Procurement Re-
form Act, or better known as HOPR 
Act. I am proud to have introduced this 
bipartisan legislation to reform the 
way the Department of Homeland Se-
curity purchases uniforms and protec-
tive equipment for its personnel. 
My bill seeks to improve the quality 
of uniforms and equipment issued to 
frontline DHS personnel by requiring, 
to the maximum extent possible, that 
at least one-third of the funds be used 
to purchase goods manufactured by 
American small businesses in America. 
Today, DHS has more than 60,000 men 
and women in uniform, but fewer than 
half of those uniforms are actually 
manufactured in the United States. 
Furthermore, in response to the con-
cerns expressed by frontline personnel 
about how quickly they exhaust their 
annual uniform allowances, this bill di-
rects DHS to study the adequacy of 
uniform allowances for those serving 
on the front lines. 
My bill also strengthens supply chain 
security for uniforms by mandating 
locked storage, reports of stolen goods, 
and the destruction of defective items 
for any item bearing official DHS in-
signia not manufactured in the United 
States. 
In response to supply chain shortages 
that we have been seeing recently dur-
ing this pandemic, my bill also requires 
the Department to assess how to get 
more items related to national security 
from domestic sources. 
This provision is targeted at such 
items as personal protective equip-
ment, or PPE, which we all know has

been quite scarce at points during this 
pandemic. Simply put, this bill is good 
for Homeland Security, good for Amer-
icans, and good for American busi-
nesses. 
H.R. 2915 is endorsed by the Warrior 
Protection and Readiness Coalition and 
passed out of the committee unani-
mously. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the Homeland Procurement 
Reform Act, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of 
the HOPR Act, H.R. 2915. 
Mr. Speaker, I commend my col-
league, Mr. CORREA, for his continued 
leadership on this issue to help bolster 
our domestic supply chains. 
This bill requires that, to the max-
imum extent possible, at least one- 
third of the funds obligated for the pro-
curement of the Department of Home-
land Security uniforms and gear cov-
ered by the HOPR Act be used to pur-
chase goods manufactured by entities 
that qualify as United States small 
businesses. 
Additionally, this bill directs the 
Secretary of Homeland Security to 
conduct a study of the adequacy of uni-
form allowances provided to Depart-
ment frontline personnel to determine 
what improvements can be made to 
current uniform allowances, including 
increasing allowances. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to join 
me in supporting H.R. 2915, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, if enacted, H.R. 2915 
will simultaneously serve the frontline 
personnel who protect our homeland 
and support the domestic industrial 
base, especially small businesses. 
Most importantly, as noted in the 
committee report, it is our expectation 
that, once this measure is enacted into 
law, DHS implement it in a manner 
that supports small business domestic 
manufacturing. 
To that end, DHS is expected to 
prioritize buying from small businesses 
that manufacture the item here in the 
United States over purchasing foreign- 
manufactured goods supplied by a 
small business. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipar-
tisan work that went into creating this 
legislation that is cosponsored by my 
Republican colleague, Mr. BRIAN MAST 
of Florida. I also appreciate the efforts 
of Senator SHAHEEN of New Hampshire, 
who introduced the Senate companion 
of this bill, which the Senate Com-
mittee on Homeland Security ordered 
to be favorably reported this year. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the HOPR Act, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CORREA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2915, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table.

DHS ACQUISITION REVIEW BOARD 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 5652) to amend the Homeland Se-
curity Act of 2002 to establish the Ac-
quisition Review Board in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill.

‘‘Sec. 836. Acquisition Review Board.’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CORREA) and the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. VAN 
DREW) each will control 20 minutes. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days to revise 
and extend their remarks and include 
extraneous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, each year, the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security spends bil-
lions of dollars on its major acquisition 
programs to execute its most critical 
missions. It acquires systems vital to 
homeland security, including those 
used to screen travelers, enhance cy-
bersecurity, and improve disaster re-
sponse. 
However, over the past decade, the 
Government Accountability Office, or 
GAO, has repeatedly raised alarms re-
garding DHS’ management of its acqui-
sition programs. 
Earlier this year, the GAO reviewed 
24 major acquisition programs that 
DHS is pursuing. Ten had been in 
breach of their cost or schedule goals, 
or both, at some point during fiscal 
year 2020. 
Given the complexity of DHS’ acqui-
sition programs, it is critical that 
there be a standing oversight body to 
give major acquisition programs the 
attention they deserve. At DHS, the 
Acquisition Review Board is just that 
body. 
H.R. 5652, the DHS Acquisition Re-
view Board Act of 2021, seeks to 
strengthen the role of the Acquisition 
Review Board, or ARB, to improve ac-
quisition outcomes at DHS. 
The ARB is charged with reviewing 
major acquisition programs for proper 
management, 
oversight, 
account-
ability, and alignment with DHS’ stra-
tegic functions. 
The ARB can intercede when it iden-
tifies a program with significant cost, 
schedule, or performance issues and 
drive a course correction or even ter-
minate such a program. 
Passage of H.R. 5652 will help sta-
bilize oversight within DHS when it 
comes to major acquisitions, which, ac-
cording to GAO, is a high-risk activity, 
by codifying the Board into law. 
Most importantly, the bill also au-
thorizes the Board to not only review 
major acquisitions but also to review 
certain acquisitions that are valued 
below $300 million but are critical to 
the Department’s success. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the DHS Acquisition Review 
Board Act, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 5652, the DHS Acquisi-
tion Review Board Act of 2021. 
The Department of Homeland Secu-
rity invests billions of dollars each 
year in its major acquisitions. These 
programs include buying IT systems to 
help secure our border, Coast Guard 
cutters to increase marine safety, and 
tools to help TSA screen travelers 
more efficiently. These acquisitions, 
and others, enable the Department to 
execute its many critical missions. 
In 
fiscal 
year 
2021 
alone, 
DHS 
planned to spend more than $7 billion 
on its major acquisition programs, and 
ultimately, the Department plans to 
spend more than $200 billion over the 
programs’ entire life cycles. 
However, the Government Account-
ability Office, GAO, and the DHS Office 
of the Inspector General, OIG, have re-
ported on the longstanding challenges 
DHS faces in managing its major ac-
quisition programs, which began with 
the inception of the Department and 
continue to this day. 
For example, in January 2021, GAO 
reported that of the 24 major acquisi-
tion programs it audited, 10 had been 
in breach of their cost or scheduled 
goals, or both, at some point during fis-
cal year 2020. 
Also, in 2018, the OIG reported that 
DHS components have an ongoing 
tendency to acquire systems before 
they adequately define their require-
ments or develop performance meas-
ures. We cannot allow this to continue. 
Given these challenges and the sig-
nificant level of DHS investment in 
these programs, it is important for 
Congress to ensure that the proper 
oversight structures are in place. That 
is exactly what this bill intends to do. 
This bill amends the Homeland Secu-
rity Act to include the DHS Acquisi-
tion Review Board, which has already 
been formed by the Department. 
The bill outlines specific responsibil-
ities and parameters for the Board, 
which it exercises today, including its 
membership and how often the Board 
should meet, such as at certain key 
points in the programs’ life cycles. 
The Board is held at the Department 
level and is chaired by the acquisition

decision 
authority—normally, 
the 
Under Secretary for Management or a 
designee—and consists of individuals 
who manage DHS’ mission objectives, 
resources, and contracts. 
The Board’s primary oversight role is 
to review major acquisition programs 
for proper management, oversight, ac-
countability, and alignment with the 
Department’s strategic functions. 
The Board keeps acquisition pro-
grams accountable to the Department, 
Congress, and the American taxpayer, 
most importantly, by doing the fol-
lowing. 
First, it ensures that the Department 
considers 
tradeoffs 
between 
cost, 
schedule, and performance before ap-
proving a program to proceed to the 
next phase of acquisition. 
Second, it determines whether pro-
grams are using acquisition best prac-
tices. 
Third, it requires senior DHS leaders 
to review the programs’ progress and 
see that the program requirements are 
being met as they should. 
This bill also requires the Board to 
document the actions and the decisions 
that it makes, including rationale for 
its decisions, which are then submitted 
to the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity in the House and the Committee 
on Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs in the Senate. 
In conclusion, this bill simply pro-
poses to codify better oversight, man-
agement, and accountability of the De-
partment’s acquisitions. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Congresswoman DEMINGS, for reaching 
across the aisle and cosponsoring this 
commonsense bill with me. I also 
thank Ranking Member KATKO
and 
Representatives GARBARINO, HIGGINS, 
and MILLER-MEEKS
for cosponsoring 
this bill as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support H.R. 5652, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. CORREA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5652 strengthens 
the Acquisition Review Board, one very 
important mechanism within DHS that 
can help ensure that acquisition pro-
grams are delivered on time and on 
budget, and in-line with DHS missions. 
A version of this bill passed the 
House in both the 115th and 116th Con-
gresses, and I thank the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW) for 
sponsoring the legislation in this Con-
gress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the DHS Acquisition Review 
Board Act, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
CORREA) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5652. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill was 
passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
TSA REACHING ACROSS NATION-

velop a plan to ensure that TSA mate-
rial disseminated in major airports can 
be better understood by more people 
accessing such airports, and for other

The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 5574 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

the Administrator of the Transportation Se-
curity Administration (TSA) shall submit to

eling individuals. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Ms. TITUS) and the gentleman 
from New Jersey (Mr. VAN DREW) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Nevada. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Nevada? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my bill, H.R. 5574, known as the 
TRANSLATE Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Congressman VAN TAYLOR of Texas, for 
once again joining me in introducing 
this legislation, which will ease TSA’s 
security processing at our Nation’s 
major airports. 
The TRANSLATE Act is bipartisan 
legislation building upon the Transpor-
tation Security Administration’s ongo-
ing efforts to increase access for non- 
English speakers, and for those with vi-
sion and hearing impairments, as they 
navigate the security screening proc-
ess. 
It does this by directing TSA to ana-
lyze common languages other than 
English that are spoken by both our 
international travelers as well as those 
who reside in the nearby community 
and then develop and execute a plan to 
disseminate security information in 
those languages to ease the screening 
process. 
I represent the heart of Las Vegas 
Valley, 
including 
McCarran 
Inter-
national Airport, which is one of the 
Nation’s busiest airports, welcoming 
passengers from around the country 
and around the world who come to 
enjoy all that southern Nevada has to 
offer. 
Navigating our air system can be 
stressful enough—if you travel back 
and forth, you know what I mean—for 
even the most well-seasoned traveler. 
Removing potential language barriers 
to ease TSA processing is not only ben-
eficial for those travelers but also for 
the general public rushing to catch 
their flights. 
Southern 
Nevada’s 
community 
is 
rich in diversity. One of every three 
Clark County residents speaks a lan-
guage other than English at home. Na-
tionwide, that number is just over one 
out of every five residents. Yet, much 
of what TSA communicates to trav-
elers 
and 
transportation 
workers 
through signs, announcements, videos, 
and online content is in English.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6297 
November 16, 2021 
Let’s be clear. You shouldn’t have to 
worry about missing a plane at an air-
port in the U.S. just because you don’t 
speak English. Making travel and secu-
rity information easier to understand 
for non-English speakers and for those 
with vision and hearing impairments 
will help create a more comfortable 
and efficient airport experience for 
residents and visitors alike. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues 
on the Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity for their unanimous support of 
this legislation last month and the 
chairman for his assistance in getting 
this passed. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support the passage of the 
TRANSLATE Act, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today for H.R. 
5574, the TRANSLATE Act. 
According to the United States Cen-
sus Bureau, approximately 67 million 
U.S. residents speak a language other 
than English at home. This legislation 
requires TSA to ensure that its com-
munications materials in airports are 
in the primary languages of individuals 
who travel through and work in our 
country’s airports. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 1400 
Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, our Nation’s airports 
connect Americans to one another and 
to the rest of the world. But for trav-
elers who do not primarily speak 
English or who experience hearing or 
vision difficulties, the TSA screening 
process can be challenging and result 
in delays for all the other travelers 
who are standing in line. 
By requiring TSA to make its sign-
age and announcement more accessible 
to passengers at major airports, my 
bill will bring much-needed inclusivity 
and efficiency to the whole travel expe-
rience. I know we all appreciate seeing 
signs in English when we are traveling 
abroad. U.S. airports should be just as 
welcoming and reflect the diversity of 
our constituents and the travelers who 
visit our cities. 
So, once again, Mr. Speaker, I en-
courage my colleagues to vote for H.R. 
5574, as amended, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
BOWMAN). The question is on the mo-
tion offered by the gentlewoman from 
Nevada (Ms. TITUS) that the House sus-
pend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 
5574, as amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess subject to 
the call of the Chair. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 1 
minute p.m.), the House stood in re-
cess. 
f 
b 1445

The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mr. BOWMAN) at 2 o’clock and 
45 minutes p.m.

tion to suspend the rules and pass the

coordination programs at the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs, and for other 
purposes, on which the yeas and nays

CELEBRATING THE RELEASE OF 
DANNY FENSTER 
(Mr. LEVIN of Michigan asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I am thrilled to celebrate the 
release of my constituent, journalist 
Danny Fenster, who was unjustly de-
tained for 51⁄2 months by the military 
junta in Burma. 
I want to extend a heartfelt thank 
you to all those involved in securing 
Danny’s release, including: Governor 
Bill Richardson; our incredible dip-
lomats in Burma, led by Ambassador 
Tom Vajda; Special Presidential Envoy 
for Hostage Affairs, or SPEHA, Ambas-
sador Roger Carstens; the State De-
partment, from Tony Blinken on down; 
Chairman GREGORY MEEKS, and all of 
my 
colleagues 
in 
the 
House 
who 
stepped up. 
My heart is full for Danny’s family. 
His parents, Buddy and Rose, his broth-
er, Bryan, his amazing cousins, they 
have all shown such resilience, deter-
mination, and creativity throughout 
this difficult journey. 
I am so grateful for the powerful out-
pouring of support across Michigan and 
this entire country. Our communities 
rallied together to support Danny and 
the Fenster family. And now, by stick-
ing together and keeping the faith, we 
have brought Danny home.

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
A message in writing from the Presi-
dent of the United States was commu-
nicated to the House by Mr. Adrian 
Swann, one of his secretaries. 
f 
BIDEN’S BORDER CRISIS 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
STAUBER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
since Joe Biden took office, over 1.6 
million illegals have been apprehended 
at our southern border. In fact, over 
164,000 illegal immigrants were appre-
hended at the southern border just in 
October alone, marking the worst Oc-
tober in the history of the Department 
of Homeland Security. 
And if you think Biden’s border crisis 
is bad right now, it is about to get a 
whole lot worse. Included in Congres-
sional Democrats’ multitrillion-dollar 
socialist wish list is billions of dollars 
to green light illegal immigrant am-
nesty requests. 
And recently, we learned that the 
Biden administration is contemplating 
paying illegal immigrants who broke 
our laws up to $450,000 each. To put this 
number into perspective, $450,000 is 
nine times the median income for the 
household in the district that I rep-
resent. To even consider these payouts 
is an insult to Americans who go to 
work every day and pay their taxes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6300 
November 16, 2021 
Madam Speaker, these policies are 
the definition of insanity, and it is no 
surprise that the majority of Ameri-
cans think the country is headed in the 
wrong direction. It is time we change 
course and do it now. 
Rather than allowing radicals to 
drive the agenda and push policies that 
incentivize more illegal immigration, 
let’s work together to secure our bor-
der. Let’s work together to put the 
American people first. 
f 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF LIEU-
TENANT 
COLONEL 
ALEXANDER 
JEFFERSON 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in tribute to Lieutenant Colonel 
Alexander Jefferson, whose heroic serv-
ice as a Tuskegee Airman in World War 
II was recognized this week in a rededi-
cation ceremony of Jefferson Field, 
and it was done on his 100th birthday. 
A graduate of Detroit public schools, 
Alexander Jefferson pursued a military 
career and completed pilot training at 
the Tuskegee Army Airfield. 
As a fighter pilot with the Red Tail, 
332nd Fighter Group 301 Fighter Squad-
ron, his unit escorted bombers head-
first into action, bravely providing pro-
tection from vicious enemy aircraft. 
They never lost a single plane. 
On August 12, 1944, Jefferson was shot 
down and captured by the Germans and 
kept as a prisoner of war for 9 months. 
He was liberated by the American 
forces on the 29th of April, 1945, and 
discharged from Active Duty in 1947. 
After serving our country, Lieuten-
ant Colonel Jefferson continued his 
public service by becoming a science 
teacher in Detroit, where he would re-
tire as an assistant principal in 1979. 
He has numerous awards for his brav-
ery and I am honored to recognize 
Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Jeffer-
son on this celebration of service to 
our country, and wish him also a beau-
tiful, wonderful 100th birthday. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROSS 
TOLLESON 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today with a heavy 
heart to remember and honor Ross 
Tolleson of Perry, Georgia. 
Ross was a beloved and honored 
member of the Georgia State Senate, 
where he served from 2001–2015. Senator 
Tolleson represented the 20th Senato-
rial District, and he did so with a serv-
ant’s heart, always working to better 
those that he represented. He served on 
the Committee on Natural Resources 
and Environment, chairing the Natural 
Resources Subcommittee for Appro-
priations. 
Outside of the Senate, Ross served 
his community as a banker, an insur-
ance salesman, and a tree farmer. He 
will forever be remembered for his self-
less dedication to improving and assist-
ing our great State. 
I am thankful to have served with 
Ross and will always hold the time we 
spent together close to my heart. My 
thoughts and prayers are with his fam-
ily, friends, and all who knew him dur-
ing this most difficult time. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF HUGH 
LEATHERMAN 
(Mr. RICE of South Carolina asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor former 
South Carolina State Senator Hugh 
Leatherman. Senator Leatherman rep-
resented Florence, and I was proud to 
join him in many opportunities to 
serve our constituents in the Pee Dee. 
Senator Leatherman passed away re-
cently at age 90, while still holding of-
fice. He worked on behalf of South 
Carolinians nearly half his life, right 
up until his passing. And I have been 
told he even took next year’s budget 
briefing from his hospital bed, exem-
plifying his true dedication to our 
State. 
Senator Leatherman didn’t hesitate 
to work across the aisle to get things 
done for the Seventh District and all 
South 
Carolinians. 
I 
have 
always 
known him to pursue smart, reasonable 
solutions and work hard to fix prob-
lems. 
Senator Leatherman was the epitome 
of a public servant. He will be dearly 
missed in the halls of the South Caro-
lina State House, and we will remem-
ber him as an accomplished and honor-
able man. 
Rest in peace, Mr. Chairman. 
f 
AMERICAN SUPPLY CHAIN CRISIS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, the 
American 
supply 
chain 
crisis 
has 
reached a very critical point. A record 
number of container ships are waiting 
to enter U.S. ports, especially off of 
L.A. and Long Beach. They even miss 
the trip up to Oakland sometimes, too. 
This leaves small businesses and gro-
cery stores with empty shelves. It 
leaves farmers and others that produce 
things in California and the U.S. wait-
ing and wondering if they can get their 
products on to ships. 
At the same time, reckless spending 
has caused inflation for Americans to 
skyrocket. Food on the shelves is more 
expensive. This isn’t just a problem for 
upper-class people, as some in the ad-
ministration are saying. This hits all 
Americans, especially those on fixed 
incomes, really hard. 
Now, a good thing, everyone saved 16 
cents on their Fourth of July barbecue 
that the Biden administration was 
touting recently; though Thanksgiving 
is predicted to be the most expensive 
meal in the history of the holiday this 
year. 
The current inflation rate has forced 
households to spend another $175 a 
month on food, fuel, and housing; let 
alone what is coming in the home heat-
ing oil this winter. 
Inflation has climbed over 6 percent 
in the last year, making it the worst 
year since 1990, according to the Bu-
reau of Labor Statistics. 
We need to get to work solving this 
problem for the American people, not 
focusing on unprecedented spending 
sprees. 
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, today, I 
stand here, in the people’s House, en-
trusted with the responsibility of en-
suring taxpayers’ hard-earned dollars 
are spent appropriately and with the 
proper oversight in place. 
Yet, this week, House Democrats are 
pushing to ram through their fatally 
flawed, partisan, multitrillion-dollar 
tax and spend package, which uses tax-
payer dollars and, no doubt, billions of 
dollars in borrowed money to fund 
their ultraliberal domestic spending 
priorities. 
The gigantic $3.5 trillion bill has ap-
parently been cut down to $1.75 tril-
lion, which is still a lot. 
What is in the $1.75 trillion tax and 
spend spree? Amnesty for illegal immi-
grants, billions for tree equity, tax 
hikes on job creators and working 
Americans, and it doesn’t end there. 
The Democrats’ package leaves out 
critical funding for the Department of 
Defense and the Department of Home-
land Security. 
Democrats have gone so far as to 
break over 40 years of tradition by 
stripping the Hyde amendment from 
their package, a longstanding bipar-
tisan provision that prevents taxpayer 
dollars from being used to fund abor-
tions.

CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL 
EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO 
THE SITUATION IN NICARAGUA— 
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES (H. DOC. 
NO. 117–75) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following message 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
situation in Nicaragua declared in Ex-
ecutive Order 13851 of November 27, 
2018, is to continue in effect beyond No-
vember 27, 2021. 
The situation in Nicaragua, including 
the violent response by the Govern-
ment of Nicaragua to the protests that 
began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega 
regime’s systematic dismantling and 
undermining of democratic institu-
tions and the rule of law, its use of in-
discriminate violence and repressive 
tactics against civilians, as well as its 
corruption leading to the destabiliza-
tion of Nicaragua’s economy, continues 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. For 
this reason, I have determined that it 
is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13851 with respect to the situation in 
Nicaragua.

DEMOCRATS DELIVERED ON 
INFRASTRUCTURE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. CARTWRIGHT) is recog-
nized for 60 minutes as the designee of 
the majority leader. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers may have 5 legislative days in 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks and include extraneous material 
on the subject of my Special Order. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
to honor the memory of a 104-year-old 
hero of World War II and a survivor of 
the infamous Bataan Death March, I 
yield to the gentleman from South 
Carolina (Mr. DUNCAN). 
MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING BRIGADIER 
GENERAL BEN SKARDON 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding be-
cause I know that he, too, works hard 
for our Nation’s veterans and the men 
and women who serve in the United 
States military. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to com-
mend and recognize a World War II and 
Korean 
war 
veteran, 
Colonel 
Ben 
Skardon, who was notified last week 
that he was set to receive an honorary 
promotion to the rank of Brigadier 
General. 
After months of coordination and 
conversations between my office, the 
Department of the Army, the Depart-
ment of Defense, Congress, and the 
family of Colonel Skardon, the Army 
and DOD have concurred with my rec-
ommendation and, in an extremely 
rare circumstance, approved Colonel 
Skardon’s promotion to the rank of 
Brigadier General. 
Very few American soldiers ever re-
ceive this honor in this manner, and it 
is well deserved on behalf of Colonel 
Skardon for his brave military service 
to our country. 
Now, let me just tell you that Colo-
nel Skardon served in World War II, 
and he was in the Philippines as com-
mander of Company A of the 92nd In-
fantry Regiment Philippine Army and 
led his troops through some of the 
fiercest days of World War II in the 
South Pacific. 
After the surrender of tens of thou-
sands of Filipino and U.S. soldiers to 
Japanese 
forces 
on 
April 
9, 
1942, 
Skardon was forced into the infamous 
Bataan Death March. For 65 miles, 
Skardon and many others were forced 
to walk, suffering physical abuse, fa-
tigue, and the mental exhaustion of 
watching the death of many fellow 
prisoners. 
Colonel Skardon survived this hor-
rific march because of his perseverance 
and commitment to his will to live. 
Skardon’s strength and will continued 
for the 1,255 days he spent in Japanese 
prison as a prisoner of war. 
He defied all odds with the help of 
two fellow Clemson University grad-
uates who spoon-fed him and made sure 
he was safe from Japanese guards. 
Skardon managed to keep hidden his 
Clemson ring. As a Clemson alumnus 
who wears his ring proudly, I under-
stand the sacrifice that he made to 
keep that hidden. 
He and his fellow alumni made the 
tough 
decision 
to 
trade 
Colonel 
Skardon’s gold Clemson ring for food 
and medicine, which ultimately saved 
his life. With the help of his fellow sol-
diers and his pawned ring, he recov-
ered. 
Skardon also survived the sinking of 
two unmarked hell ships, prisoner of 
war 
ships, 
that 
were 
transporting 
POWs to mainland Japan. Not just one 
but two prison ships were sunk by the 
United States military. 
At 24 years old and only 90 pounds, he 
was finally liberated in Manchuria by 
Russian units in 1945. 
After World War II, he went on to 
serve our Nation in the Korean war, re-
tiring with the rank of colonel in 1962. 
His leadership skills were exemplified 
by his continued military involvement 
with the young men and women in 
ROTC at Clemson who wanted to go on 
and serve in our military. Colonel 
Skardon would mentor them about 
what they faced. 
For all of his valor, endurance, and 
suffering in World War II, he was 
awarded two Silver Stars and two 
Bronze Stars for valor. He was a Purple 
Heart recipient and a Congressional 
Gold Medal recipient. 
When he retired, he continued his life 
of service as a professor at Clemson 
University for nearly 20 years. He 
earned several esteemed citizen and ci-
vilian awards, including the Clemson 
Medallion, Clemson University’s high-
est honor; the Alumni Distinguished 
Service Award, the Clemson Alumni 
Association’s highest honor; and from 
the State of South Carolina, the Order 
of the Palmetto. 
His life of perseverance and selfless 
leadership exemplified what it means 
not only to be a United States soldier 
but a true American hero. 
Colonel Skardon was informed of the 
promotion that he received from colo-
nel to brigadier general just this week-
end. Colonel Skardon was 104 years old. 
He passed away last night. 
Working to secure his promotion to 
brigadier general is one of the most 
humbling acts that I have undertaken 
during my time in Congress, and I have 
no doubt that divine intervention was 
responsible 
for 
ensuring 
that 
he 
learned of this great honor that our 
country bestowed upon him before his 
passing. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his 
family and the Clemson community 
during this time. He will be deeply 
missed, but he will never be forgotten. 
To 
the 
family 
of 
General 
Ben 
Skardon, and to Ben, Godspeed. We ap-
preciate your service to our great Na-
tion. You wore that Clemson ring 
proudly. Clemson honored you. I honor 
you today, and I thank you for your 
service to our great Nation. Godspeed. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Representative DUNCAN
for 
that fine tribute, and I ask, in har-
mony with Congressman DUNCAN, that 
this House observe a moment of silence 
in honor of the memory of this World 
War II hero, Colonel Ben Skardon. 
Madam Speaker, this week, Demo-
crats delivered on infrastructure. 
Over the past number of years, we 
have had infrastructure week after in-
frastructure week. Eventually, infra-
structure week became a joke. 
Now, under the current administra-
tion, we have made good on our prom-
ise to rebuild the arteries of America. 
We have delivered a once-in-a-century 
investment in all the infrastructure 
that makes our Nation run.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6302 
November 16, 2021 
It is the kind of investment that will 
create millions of good-paying jobs and 
make our Nation more competitive 
with every other country in the world. 
When President Biden signed into 
law this bill, this act, yesterday, it was 
the largest investment in rebuilding 
bridges since the construction of the 
Interstate Highway System, the larg-
est Federal investment in passenger 
rail since the original establishment of 
Amtrak, and the largest investment in 
clean drinking water in American his-
tory. 
So important for my district in 
northeastern Pennsylvania, this will 
put northeastern Pennsylvania back on 
the 
passenger 
rail 
map, 
bring 
broadband internet to every rural area 
in my district, and support our efforts 
to reclaim all the abandoned mine land 
sites that have scarred our landscape 
for decades and fouled our water-
courses for that length of time as well. 
It will create millions of jobs, good- 
paying jobs, American jobs, union jobs, 
jobs that cannot be outsourced across 
the ocean. 
This is truly a transformative law 
that will help us build a stronger mid-
dle class and a brighter future for our 
entire Nation. 
What we are here to talk about this 
evening is what it means to us, this 
kind of investment, this kind of belief 
in our future here in America, what it 
means to us individually, in our par-
ticular districts. 
I have here this evening my fellow 
Pennsylvanian from the Second Con-
gressional District of Pennsylvania, 
Representative BRENDAN BOYLE. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
BRENDAN F. BOYLE) so he can tell us 
what it means to him that we have 
made this historic investment in Amer-
ica. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Madam Speaker, the last Presi-
dent made the term ‘‘infrastructure 
week’’ a running joke. Under President 
Biden and Democrats in Congress, in-
frastructure decade is now a reality. 
That decade officially began yester-
day afternoon when my colleague and I 
and many others were over on the 
South Lawn of the White House to 
watch President Biden sign into law 
this historic investment in our Na-
tion’s infrastructure. 
There are two points that I want to 
make about it. First, this was abso-
lutely needed. Both the International 
Council of Engineers as well as the 
American Council of Engineers rated 
the state of America’s infrastructure 
anywhere as good as a C-minus to as 
bad as an F, depending on the given 
year. 
If you went back a century ago, the 
United States of America was the un-
questioned leader in infrastructure. 
That is how we were able to build the 
American century. The fact that a cen-
tury later we don’t lead in that area 
should bother all of us as Americans. 
I want America to be number one. 
That is what we are called to do, to 
lead. Yet, the state of our infrastruc-
ture over years and years and decades 
had been allowed to fall behind. Well, 
not anymore. That is point number 
one, that it is needed. 
b 1630 
Point number two, what it will 
produce is jobs. Frankly, the bipartisan 
infrastructure deal is a blue-collar 
blueprint for America. 
My family’s background is one that 
is typical of so many of us in Philadel-
phia—blue-collar, working-class back-
ground. There used to be jobs aplenty if 
you didn’t have a college education, 
but the reality is, as the United States 
and most of the West has transformed 
into a knowledge economy, if you are a 
blue-collar American, the last several 
decades have not been that good for 
you. 
Well, here is a piece of legislation to 
address that, to create millions of jobs 
that don’t require a college degree. 
I passionately believe, as cofounder 
and co-chair of the Blue Collar Caucus, 
that it is not sufficient to say to a 
whole swath of Americans: Well, if you 
don’t have a higher education, too bad. 
Just go get retrained, figure it out on 
your own. 
That is not good enough. We are 
talking about millions and millions of 
Americans who deserve to have family- 
sustaining jobs, who are smart, who 
are hard working. They just need their 
government to invest more in them, to 
create those opportunities. 
Well, sure enough, that is exactly 
what this bill does. My colleague, my 
fellow Pennsylvanian went down the 
list of the investments that we are 
making: Roads, bridges, rail, mass 
transit, replacing lead pipes, high- 
speed internet. The list goes on and on. 
It is an investment in America and our 
people. 
I am very proud that I voted in favor 
of this legislation, proud to have 
worked with my colleagues and this 
President to make this a reality. 
And, finally, I do just want to pay a 
special thanks to the 19 Senate Repub-
licans and 13 House Republicans who 
did the right thing and joined with us. 
Obviously, the overwhelming majority 
of votes for this legislation came from 
Democrats, but it really says some-
thing in this highly partisan time that 
we were able to get a significant num-
ber of friends from the other side of the 
aisle to join with us and do the right 
thing on this piece of legislation. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Will the gen-
tleman yield for a question? 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Yes. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. You mentioned 
being number one and competing. What 
are you talking about, being number 
one, on what list? And who do we have 
to compete with? 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Let’s face it, we are in a world-
wide competition, especially against 
China. And let me be clear, I am speak-
ing about the Chinese Government, not 
its people. The Chinese regime does not 
share our values. It is not committed 
to democracy. Far from it. President 
Xi or dictator-for-life Xi actually chal-
lenges whether or not democracy will 
survive. We know that China, through 
its Belt and Road Initiative, is making 
infrastructure investments not only in 
China but in other parts of the world 
because they want to gain a foothold. 
I feel passionately about this. As a 
proud American, I make no apologies 
for the fact that I want us to be num-
ber one in the world. But I believe that 
it is actually best, not just for the 
United States, but best for all people in 
the world who yearn to breathe free. 
This infrastructure bill will help us 
not just domestically, but I do believe 
that as the United States grows, as we 
grow our economy, as we make an in-
vestment in people for whom the mod-
ern economy has not necessarily been a 
good deal, I believe we will help set a 
shining example to the rest of the 
world. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congressman BOYLE for his in-
sights about the competition aspect. 
By delivering this infrastructure bill 
yesterday afternoon, as we did, Demo-
crats are delivering millions of good- 
paying union jobs, jobs that will put 
pipefitters and plumbers to work re-
placing lead water pipes so every child 
in America can drink clean water. No 
more will we have the Flint, Michigans 
where little kids get poisoned by lead 
in their drinking water, because we are 
going to rip out all that 100-year-old 
piping with the lead in it so that won’t 
happen again. 
We 
will 
transform 
roads, 
rail, 
bridges, public transit, modernize our 
ports and airports and freight rail, 
manufacture solar panels, wind farms, 
batteries, electric vehicles to grow 
clean energy supply chains that we can 
export to the rest of the world. 
This is a transformational moment 
not only for the American economy but 
for the American future and the Amer-
ican people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from the 4th Congressional 
District of Pennsylvania, Congress-
woman MADELEINE DEAN, to elucidate 
further on what it means that we en-
acted this law yesterday afternoon. So 
far it is all Pennsylvanians. 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I am so 
excited about this bill that I have gone 
hoarse talking about it, so I apologize 
for my gravelly voice, but it is not 
from any lack of enthusiasm for the bi-
partisan infrastructure bill, which is 
really a jobs bill. 
I want to just commend my col-
leagues from Pennsylvania and from 
around the country, as we fought for 
this bill, as we fought for this infra-
structure investment, and as we voted 
on it, and then yesterday had the his-
toric day of watching our President 
sign it into law. 
Madam Speaker, it was 10 years ago 
that I first ran for public office. I ran 
for township commissioner, and what I

November 16, 2021 
said then was that I wanted to build a 
more buildable, walkable, commutable, 
bikeable infrastructure for my older- 
ring suburb of Philadelphia. 
Little did I know that I would then 
go on to serve as State representative 
for 61⁄2 years. My proudest vote as a 
State representative was Act 89 of 2013, 
a bipartisan, multiyear investment in 
our infrastructure. My proudest vote. 
And look at us today. We now have 
the chance to make this much-needed 
investment in Pennsylvania and across 
the country in every district where dol-
lars will be flowing to modernize our 
infrastructure, to make it greener. 
Here are just some of the estimates 
for what will be coming to Pennsyl-
vania: 
$11.3 billion to upgrade roads and 
highways. We know that in my older- 
ring suburb our highways, our roads 
are in grave need of upgrading for safe-
ty and other purposes; 
$2.8 billion for public transportation. 
Again, in my suburbs, we rely upon 
public transportation, and we want it 
to be more reliable so that more people 
will be using it with ease to protect our 
climate and our streets; 
$1.4 billion in safe drinking water. 
Again, incredibly important across this 
country, whether from lead pipes, or 
from, as in my district and many oth-
ers, the contamination of PFAS; 
$244 million investment in weather-
ization to our homes; 
$1.6 billion toward improving bridges. 
Pennsylvania sadly has a historic num-
ber of bridges in need of reconstruction 
or replacement; 
$100 million to expand broadband ac-
cess; and 
$355 million to modernize airport in-
frastructure. 
There is so much we will be able to 
do with this bipartisan investment in 
our infrastructure. 
Know also that it is about growing 
jobs, good jobs, jobs of the future, and 
it is also anti-inflationary, which is 
something I know all of my constitu-
ents care about. 
I will end maybe on my grand-
children. I am so excited, and I will be 
telling them for years about the chance 
to work on the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill, the chance to vote for it, and 
the chance to stand alongside the 
President as he signed this 50-, 60-year 
investment in their futures. I hope 
they will be as proud as I am of the 
President and all of us for getting it 
done. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Will the gentle-
woman yield for a question? 
Ms. DEAN. Certainly. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. It is a sad ques-
tion, I have to say, because we call it 
the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act, but the truth is, 
despite their best efforts to claim cred-
it in local news across the country, 206 
House Republicans voted against this 
bill. They voted against good-paying 
American jobs, they voted against 
roads, bridges, and rail systems, water 
systems and sewer systems, against 
broadband, and clean drinking water. 
They voted against the tools that we 
need to compete and win in the global 
economy 
as 
Representative 
BOYLE 
pointed out. 
My question is why? Why would they 
vote against this belief in our country, 
this investment in our future? Why 
would they vote against it? 
Ms. DEAN. I certainly don’t know 
what is in their heart or what is in 
their vote. But I will say that these 
were infrastructure investments that 
these 
very 
same 
Representatives 
fought for under the previous adminis-
tration. 
They 
enthusiastically 
em-
braced week, after week, after week, 
after week as Infrastructure Week. 
I hope this is not the case, but sadly 
it seems as though the investments in 
their communities came down to a po-
litical choice because, as you have 
heard some people say—and they com-
plain about this, but it is only testi-
mony to the power of this bill—that 
this will actually perhaps give Demo-
crats a win. 
We didn’t do it for a win. We did it 
for a win for the American people, for 
our infrastructure, and for our future, 
but there is some awareness on the 
other side of the aisle that this is po-
litically damaging to them. Sad to say. 
I do believe that it will be interesting 
to be at all the ribbon cuttings, and I 
hope in a bipartisan way all Members 
are at the ribbon cuttings because of 
the difference this will make, and it 
will be up to them to decide why they 
did vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Congresswoman MADELEINE 
DEAN of the 4th Congressional District 
of Pennsylvania. 
This bill does so much, and we are so 
proud here tonight to talk about it. It 
is a win for the American people no 
matter which way you slice it. 
Building out our first ever national 
network of charging stations so fami-
lies can travel coast to coast in elec-
tric vehicles, making high-speed inter-
net available and affordable for every 
household in America, especially those 
rural, hard-to-get-to places, cleaning 
up brownfields and Superfund sites, as 
well as plugging, as I said before, aban-
doned mine lands and orphan wells to 
stop 
pollution 
and 
protect 
public 
health and to build up our resistance to 
superstorms, droughts, wildfires, and 
hurricanes that cost us billions of dol-
lars in damage, $99 billion last year 
alone. 
This bipartisan infrastructure deal is 
a 
blue-collar 
blueprint 
to 
rebuild 
America, and a majority of these jobs, 
as Representative BOYLE pointed out, 
do not require a college degree. 
So the question is, what does it mean 
to us? What does it mean to us that we 
have passed this magnificent, enor-
mous investment in American infra-
structure, this belief in our Nation’s 
future? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Rhode 
Island 
(Mr. 
CICILLINE) to describe what it means to 
him and his 1st District constituents. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for convening this Special Order hour. 
The impact of this legislation is sig-
nificant in my home State of Rhode Is-
land and all across our country. The 
United States has the largest economy 
in the world, yet our roads and bridges 
are crumbling, our ports and airports 
are in disrepair, over 10 million house-
holds do not have safe drinking water. 
This is unacceptable. 
We cannot compete in a global econ-
omy unless we can move goods, serv-
ices, and information to compete in the 
21st century. 
The bipartisan infrastructure bill 
which President Biden signed, and we 
worked hard to pass, invests $550 bil-
lion in new funding to bring America’s 
infrastructure into the 21st century so 
that we cannot only improve the qual-
ity of life, grow our economy, create 
millions of good-paying jobs, but also 
to ensure that we can compete glob-
ally. 
This legislation, which the President 
signed yesterday, includes the largest 
ever Federal investments in public 
transit, 
clean 
drinking 
water 
and 
wastewater infrastructure, and clean 
energy transmission and electric vehi-
cle infrastructure. It includes the larg-
est investment in passenger rail since 
the creation of Amtrak, and the largest 
dedicated bridge investment since we 
built the Interstate Highway System. 
This legislation will create millions 
of good-paying union jobs while also 
addressing the critical infrastructure 
needs of our country and of my home 
State of Rhode Island. 
This monumental investment in in-
frastructure is the first part of a plan 
to not only create good-paying jobs but 
to ensure Americans have the support 
they need to succeed in those jobs. 
Combined with the Build Back Better 
Act, these two historic bills will create 
11⁄2 million good-paying jobs each year 
over the next decade and accelerate 
America’s path to full employment.

For Rhode Island with this bill en-
acted into law, we will see $2.5 billion 
coming straight to Rhode Island to 
help fix our roads and bridges, replace 
lead pipes, improve our public trans-
portation 
system, 
and 
increase 
broadband access. And that is not to 
mention the billions of dollars in dedi-
cated funding for Amtrak’s Northeast 
corridor, which will certainly benefit 
Rhode Islanders and all of us in New 
England. 
Our State has the highest percentage 
of structurally deficient bridges in the 
country. In 2019, 22.3 percent of our 
bridges were structurally deficient. In 
2020, our State’s infrastructure was 
given a C minus by the American Soci-
ety of Civil Engineers. 
This is unacceptable and unsafe. 
The funding streams that this legis-
lation will provide are the following: 
$1.5 billion for Federal aid highway ap-
portioned programs; $242 million for

bridge replacement and repairs in 
Rhode Island; $272 million to improve 
public transportation in Rhode Island; 
$23 million to support expansion of the 
State’s electric vehicle charging net-
work in Rhode Island; $100 million to 
expand broadband connectivity, includ-
ing providing access to the 14,000 Rhode 
Islanders who currently lack it; and 
247,000 Rhode Islanders, 24 percent of 
Rhode Island, will be eligible for the 
Affordable Connectivity Benefit to help 
working families afford internet ac-
cess; $2 million to protect against 
wildfires; 
$10.9 
million 
to 
protect 
against cyberattacks; $378 million to 
improve water infrastructure; and $45 
million for our airports. 
These are significant, historic invest-
ments in rebuilding the infrastructure 
of our State, and the same thing is 
happening in States all across Amer-
ica. 
I salute the President for his strong 
leadership. I salute my colleagues that 
worked so hard on this legislation. It is 
going to help ensure that America can 
compete again in the global economy. 
And most importantly, it will im-
prove the quality of our lives for our 
constituents. It will improve our econ-
omy. It will grow good-paying jobs. 
And it will make America proud of the 
quality 
of 
its 
infrastructure 
once 
again. 
I want to end by particularly ac-
knowledging the men and women in 
the building trades who are going to do 
this work; and do it with such pride 
that they are not only going to im-
prove our economy, but also improve 
our quality of life. I salute all of the 
men and women in the building trades. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. You also men-
tioned competition, and Congressman 
BOYLE brought that up. And you also 
mentioned how much is going into 
broadband 
internet 
availability 
in 
Rhode Island. 
How does that affect competition and 
the ability of Rhode Islanders to com-
pete? 
Mr. CICILLINE. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. I yield to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for the question. 
I think when you look at particularly 
what we experienced during COVID, we 
saw some of the difficulties that fami-
lies—particularly families with young 
children—had in accessing the internet 
so they could receive school instruc-
tion. And the reality is you need inter-
net connections to access the world 
and to be able to communicate and be 
able to learn in the 21st century. 
And there were young people who 
were actually going to parking lots of 
McDonald’s 
and 
other 
places 
that 
might have internet to do their home-
work. That can’t happen in America. 
And so we want to ensure that re-
building our infrastructure provides 
opportunities for every single young 
person in this country to realize their 
full potential. Because we are not just 
competing with the kid next door, we 
are competing with kids in China, 
Japan, and all over the world. 
We want to ensure that we have an 
infrastructure to support the economic 
growth we need. We also want to en-
sure that we can deliver goods, serv-
ices, and information in the 21st cen-
tury and that we are training young 
people and educating young people and 
training workers to compete success-
fully. You can’t do that without infra-
structure to support that development, 
that knowledge, and the work that 
needs to be done. 
You think of the experiences we saw 
during COVID. It made it very clear 
that we needed to move quickly. Our 
competitors around the world are in-
vesting tens of billions of dollars in in-
frastructure. They are competing di-
rectly with us. 
This is a race for the 21st century and 
a race we are going to win in large part 
because we are finally investing in 
America’s infrastructure. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I think Mr. CICILLINE is right. I think 
competition is maybe the biggest point 
of the bipartisan Infrastructure Invest-
ment and Jobs Act. Competition that 
will not only grease the skids for our 
companies to bring their products to 
market and to innovate and to compete 
with companies all over the world, but 
maybe more importantly, to allow our 
individuals—as 
Mr. 
CICILLINE
just 
pointed out—to make the most of 
themselves. 
It was about 80 years ago that we had 
the Rural Electrification Act in the 
United States, and it did pretty much 
the same thing with electricity because 
you had pockets, little corners of 
America, rural places mostly, that 
didn’t have electric power. And to 
think how far they would have been 
left behind if 80 years ago the govern-
ment didn’t make the effort to include 
all of America as we moved forward 
into the modern age of electricity; it is 
the 
same 
thing 
with 
internet 
connectivity, isn’t it? 
Mr. CICILLINE. Absolutely. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
another thing we did in the past to in-
vest in ourselves was the Eisenhower 
Interstate Highway System. This was 
something that the greatest generation 
did, Madam Speaker. They came back 
from World War II—we just honored a 
World War II hero of the Bataan Death 
March—but these folks came home 
from all of the privations and sacrifices 
and suffering that they went through 
in the war, and what did they do? They 
sacrificed more for us for the future, 
what was then the future, what is now 
us. They sacrificed for us. They built 
the Eisenhower Interstate Highway 
System. 
What did it do? It greased the skids 
for American companies, enabled com-
panies to bring their products to mar-
ket faster and more cheaply and in a 
way that enabled them to compete 
with every other country in the world. 
This is the kind of investment that 
makes America win in competitions all 
over the world. 
You don’t have to be an engineer to 
understand these things. You don’t 
have to be a mechanical engineer to 
know that this is exactly what we need 
to be doing in the United States of 
America these days. It was a wonder 
that it took until now. 
Certainly, my entire time in Con-
gress I have been waiting for a major 
infrastructure bill to come through to 
beef up our roads and our bridges; our 
water systems and our sewer systems; 
our broadband internet; and move us 
into the next century to compete with 
China, Europe, Russia, and all of the 
places that would do away with us if 
they could beat us. 
It was just yesterday afternoon that 
this bill, the bipartisan Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act, was signed 
into law on the south lawn of the 
White House. And who was sitting next 
to me in the chair to my left, but Rep-
resentative PAUL
TONKO
of the 20th 
District of New York, who happens to 
be a mechanical engineer, and he 
knows one or two things about making 
things work; making them work bet-
ter, more efficiently, faster, and cheap-
er. 
What does it mean to you, Represent-
ative TONKO, that we pass this bipar-
tisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act? 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. TONKO). 
Mr. TONKO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for leading us in this 
discussion this evening. 
So what does the infrastructure bill 
mean to my district, mean to me? I 
think it is sharpening our competitive 
edge. 
And when you are out there func-
tioning in a global economy, we may 
not be the only force out there as we 
were decades ago, and so sharpening 
that pencil and making certain we cut 
costs, costs for families, costs for pro-
duction, and providing for resources 
that will put the tools in the kit that 
are required for a 21st century econ-
omy is what it is all about. We have 
back-burnered infrastructure for far 
too long. 
Having been here now, this is my 13th 
year in Congress, infrastructure is not 
a Democratic or Republican idea. Peo-
ple have been talking about it in both 
Chambers in both parties for a long 
time. And every week in the last ad-
ministration was infrastructure week. 
But finally it took leadership. 
President Biden, with his experience 
of almost four decades in the Senate 
and serving as Vice President, knew 
about those relationships. He knew 
that you had to negotiate across party 
lines, you had to negotiate across 
House lines to make certain that work-
ing with his administration and with 
his cabinet officials we would come up 
with a blueprint for a sound economy. 
And that is exactly what happened 
here.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6305 
November 16, 2021 
Yesterday’s bill signing was exciting. 
We were sitting together on that south 
lawn. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. It was chilly. 
Mr. TONKO. It was chilly and windy, 
so it felt even chillier than it was. But 
what was so important to recognize 
and to consume was that what you had 
here was a President who is in the likes 
of Abraham Lincoln, who built an 
intercontinental rail system; President 
Teddy Roosevelt, who set up a National 
Parks System; President Dwight Eisen-
hower, who set up the Interstate High-
way System. This person stands as a 
giant when it comes to infrastructure 
now, someone who brought us together; 
and it wasn’t talk on and on, it was ne-
gotiations. And finally now the first 
step in this process, the huge downpay-
ment on our infrastructure, is very 
vital. 
So to me it is about competition, but 
it is also about hope, providing a spirit 
of hope for working families in this 
country to know that there is a bolder 
tomorrow. 
I liken our country to the pioneer 
spirit. I think it is part of our DNA. We 
showed again that there is spirit, spirit 
to embrace invention and innovation 
as we are going through R&D dollars to 
develop more efficiency and effective-
ness with wind power. 
We are going to invest in my State 
and across the 50 States in infrastruc-
ture 
that 
ranges 
from 
roads 
and 
bridges to ports, making them more se-
cure, more equipped for the modern 
economy, making certain that we are 
providing for a response to the trans-
portation sector for climate’s sake. 
This allows us to be better stewards 
in protecting our planet, making cer-
tain the next generations that follow 
us will have a better world. That is 
done by us making certain that in my 
State where there are those nonattain-
ment areas, in accordance with the 
Clean Air Act, they will now clean up 
that air that they breathe; the water 
that they drink; the soils that they can 
restore. That is part of an economic re-
sponse. 
And as we restore some of those 
sites—many of them are in commu-
nities of color, neighborhoods of Brown 
and Black people, who will now prosper 
because they will remediate these soils 
and now go forward with opportunities 
for work. 
So this is about putting people to 
work. The jobs that will be part of this 
will be tremendous. And it is just a 
green light to go forward and really 
focus on our efforts as we travel for-
ward to invest in those dynamics that 
truly matter. 
I look at my State, they are sched-
uled to receive approximately—we are 
still working out the numbers—some 
$30 million to build our airports into a 
stronger bit of infrastructure. Impor-
tant in international travel. Making 
certain that we invest in the Northeast 
corridor with Amtrak. Our rail system 
requires, for safety sake and ridership 
time, an investment. And so those dol-
lars of some $66 billion will be going to-
wards Amtrak. $100 billion going to-
ward roads and bridges in this country. 
Making certain that we address one of 
the issues very important to the sub-
committee that I chair, the Sub-
committee on Environment and Cli-
mate Change, that reports to the 
standing Committee on Energy and 
Commerce, that subcommittee under 
its umbrella has the responsibilities of 
implementing the Safe Drinking Water 
Act. And what we found is that we need 
to invest heavily in our drinking water 
infrastructure. 
Think of it, the spaghetti below our 
communities, below our feet, is so crit-
ical in getting a commodity that is es-
sential, sound, pristine drinking water 
to industry, to homes, to schools. That 
begins and ends with sound infrastruc-
ture. 
And some of this infrastructure, Rep-
resentative CARTWRIGHT, is dating back 
to the days of Rutherford B. Hayes in 
the White House. 
We are not content with our phones 
because they are outdated, and we have 
had them 2 years. We are not content 
with our TV screen because it is not 
large enough. We are tired of the miles 
on the car or the color of it, so we get 
a new vehicle. But we are content to 
sit there with 100-year-old pipes that 
are providing an essential commodity 
for this economy and for the safety of 
people in their homes and in schools. 
So this is about investing $55 billion 
in lead pipe removal, which is going to 
put a lot of pipefitters and plumbers 
into working situations as they replace 
these pipes. No child, no family should 
be drinking water that is lead infested. 
And for us to know that there are 10,000 
pipes actively serving communities 
across this country, it is far past time 
to respond to that replacement mecha-
nism, which this bill does. 
So, obviously, I am listening to the 
colloquy you have had with so many of 
our colleagues tonight, and we can go 
on and on about the benefits of this 
bill. There are tremendous benefits 
that put people to work in union jobs 
so that they will be given a salary, a 
check, a paycheck that is commensu-
rate with the skill and the talent they 
bring for all of us as Americans. 
b 1700 
And putting people to work, stronger 
stewardship of our planet, and innova-
tion concepts that will take us to the 
next economy of the 21st century, 
these are all virtuous outcomes. And 
how 206 Members of this House could 
vote against infrastructure when they 
talked about it, they touted it for 
years. But they were okay to support a 
tax cut that went to the 1 percent of 
wealth of this country and some of the 
largest corporations in the world. But 
for the working families, for the mid-
dle class community of this country, 
for those looking to ascend the middle 
class, there was a ‘‘no’’ vote, while you 
could have made it so competitive, 
sharpen that competitive edge, give us 
the skills and the talents and the re-
sources we need, making certain we go 
forward with a sense of hope, a spirit of 
hope that we can do, that we can em-
brace that pioneer spirit of this coun-
try. 
Madam Speaker, the President yes-
terday said to the President of China, I 
believe it was, when he asked him, 
What is America? How would you de-
fine it? 
Possibilities. 
Opportunity. 
Possi-
bility. Pioneer spirit. All of that comes 
together in one venue that is enabled 
by these bills that are going to address 
infrastructure. And that bill signing 
yesterday for that infrastructure bill, 
that was a powerful statement, a pow-
erful moment. One that says ‘‘can do.’’ 
Yes, America. We are back. We are 
going to make certain that all of the 
good work that is done will improve 
our economy, strengthen our economy, 
and provide for a competitive edge that 
will keep us the strong economy in the 
world that we ought to be. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. It is an afternoon 
we won’t soon forget. 
Mr. TONKO. Not at all. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Will the gen-
tleman yield for a question? 
Mr. TONKO. Absolutely. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Well now, of 
course, the press has noted with inter-
est that it took us weeks and months 
to sort out all the details and finally 
get it to the White House for signature. 
Here is my question: Contrast those 
weeks and months with how long will 
this country benefit from the bipar-
tisan Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act? How long? 
Mr. TONKO. Oh my gosh, this is gen-
erational. We haven’t seen this kind of 
investment in ages. So when we look 
back at that interstate railroad sys-
tem, we look back at the park system, 
we look back at the interstate issues, 
these are infrastructure investments 
that are still providing for us. 
I look at some of the work that came 
under President Franklin Roosevelt’s 
administration and the infrastructure 
in my district, phenomenal schools 
that are like fortresses that are part of 
the cityscape, the landscape of any 
community that are still tremendous 
bits of architecture that are serving a 
very useful purpose. 
When we think about the Rural Elec-
trification Act of about a century ago, 
people are still prospering from that 
connection. As you called it, the pock-
ets that were unserved or underserved. 
So this is going to be a lifetime and 
beyond for even the youngest of our 
communities, as we celebrated yester-
day. 
We look at the broadband that is also 
part of this process, how can you allow 
for communities to go unserved or un-
derserved. This is about children doing 
their homework. This is about cottage 
industry surviving and growing. This is 
about security for those who live in re-
mote rural areas or in some poor neigh-
borhoods. This is a connection with the 
outside world. So the connection that

November 16, 2021 
comes with this via rail, via airports, 
via jobs, via infrastructure, via water 
systems that will serve us well. 
I remember being back in the begin-
ning of my elected capacity in a county 
government situation. We were much 
stronger in our response to water. 
Today, we are at about 41⁄2 percent of 
any project—41⁄2 percent is contributed 
from the Federal Government. It is 
time to change that. 
And you know what, the message 
that I think is important also, Rep-
resentative CARTWRIGHT, is that these 
issues, these concerns, these needs— 
and they are needs—don’t go away. So 
either pay for them at a Federal level 
where there are much more progressive 
opportunities to create the revenues— 
and by the way, this is all paid for, 
which is a great highlight—but we had 
those more progressive opportunities 
for revenues rather than relying on a 
property tax as it percolates down into 
the most local of levels and say, Okay, 
you need this water, dig into the purse 
for the property tax. Unfair. Unaccept-
able. 
So we are here now celebrating what 
can be a golden moment. It was just 
great to gather together yesterday and 
see mayors of both parties, see gov-
ernors of both parties, see the cabinet 
officials, seeing union labor, seeing the 
private sector, seeing the faith commu-
nity, all gathering together applauding 
and recognizing the leadership, the pro-
found leadership of President Biden, 
Vice President HARRIS, their Cabinet, 
and certainly those who voted for the 
measure in the Senate and in the 
House here in Washington. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Will the gen-
tleman yield for another question? 
Mr. TONKO. Sure. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. So we have all 
been seeing these images of 75, 80 cargo 
ships off the coast of California, Long 
Beach, Los Angeles, waiting to get in 
because we are starting up our econ-
omy after the pandemic was shut down. 
Obviously, it is not something we went 
to school for—shutting down an Amer-
ican economy and starting it back up— 
but that is what we are doing, and we 
are muddling through it. And there are 
some painful price hikes here and there 
because of it—hard to say how long 
they will go on. 
But the one thing that struck me was 
all of those containerships full, they 
told me that it takes 7,000 tractor- 
trailers to unload a containership. 
That is 7,000 containers on a ship, and 
over 70 or 80 ships out there in the har-
bor. All of these manufactured goods 
coming from China. 
And it said to me, we read about the 
trade imbalance, we learn about the 
trade imbalance, we learn that China is 
out-manufacturing us and we are buy-
ing their goods. But, man, until you 
see those ships out in the harbor off-
shore, it doesn’t really hit home how 
much they are beating us at manufac-
turing. What does this bill do to ad-
dress that? 
Mr. TONKO. Well, of course, we are 
modernizing our ports. We are modern-
izing our roads and bridges. We are 
making certain that we have a state- 
of-the-art grid for electricity sake so 
that as you integrate renewables, and 
integrate distributed generation; you 
need that state-of-the-art grid. So all 
of this investment, starting with the 
modernization of the ports allows us to 
take this in. 
You brought up a really good point. 
This pandemic rocked this economy 
here in the U.S. and around the world 
in a way that we haven’t seen in over 
100 years. And for us now to be experi-
encing this aftermath shouldn’t be a 
surprise. People are staying home not 
spending. They didn’t go shopping; 
they were afraid, as they should be. 
They were warned not to go into stores 
and spread the virus. 
So it rocked the economy. And so 
there was a supply that was building, 
and the demand was way down. And 
now we are trying to steady this out. 
This infrastructure issue will help us. 
We need to work through this now to 
steady the economy because we saw 
spikes that obviously aren’t accept-
able. 
The President and his team will use 
this infrastructure measure and other 
concepts to make certain we come 
back and steady the economy in a way 
that will get us back to normal—that 
is so important to do—and to be vision-
ary. 
I see that Representative ROSS
is 
going to join us from North Carolina, 
and we have been working together— 
perhaps you have been working with 
Representative ROSS, too—on offshore 
wind. There is a visionary piece. And 
there is a way for us to really build the 
energy supply in a way that is going to 
put a lot of people to work. 
So 
Representative 
CARTWRIGHT, 
thank you for leading us in this discus-
sion tonight. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. And I like the 
point about how shutting down for the 
pandemic, it kind of taught us a lot of 
things about our own economy, about 
the pockets of, for example, the gig 
workers nobody was thinking about at 
the outset; we had to include them in 
the relief money. But, man, when we 
saw these ships piling up offshore, it 
really brought home to me really how 
we are being out-manufactured and we 
have to pick up our game. 
Investing in our infrastructure, what 
do you think? Is it going to help? 
Mr. TONKO. This bill is definitely 
going to address the supply-chain con-
cern. The pandemic was so instruc-
tive—supply chain, technology, reli-
ance on technology—making certain 
we learn these lessons; take them to 
mind, take them to heart, and respond. 
And this administration is about that. 
A golden moment, a celebratory mo-
ment, once in a lifetime, once in a gen-
eration, I am just proud to witness it. 
Proud to witness it and to have cast a 
‘‘yes’’ vote. 
I thank all of my colleagues in the 
House that voted yes for strengthening 
the muscle of the American economy 
and the American worker. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. It is a victory for 
America that we will treasure and 
favor for many years to come. 
Mr. TONKO. No matter what polit-
ical label you have at the end of the 
day, we are all going to prosper. 
When you see these headlines across 
the country, ‘‘billions coming to X 
State,’’ and then the sidebar discus-
sion: Entire delegation voted ‘‘no.’’ 
You explain it to the public. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Representative PAUL
TONKO 
from the 20th District of New York for 
his insights and also for helping me in-
troduce our next speaker, the dynamic 
Representative ROSS from the Second 
District of North Carolina, where inno-
vation is second nature. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
ROSS). 
Ms. ROSS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
Congressman CARTWRIGHT for yielding 
and for his leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to dis-
cuss the Infrastructure Investment and 
Jobs Act that will bring America’s 
aging infrastructure into the 21st cen-
tury. 
I was honored to join Madam Speaker 
and our other colleagues at the White 
House as the President signed this his-
toric legislation into law. 
In Congress, I am extremely proud to 
represent Wake County, North Caro-
lina, one of the fastest growing coun-
ties in the United States. We are a 
powerful economic engine for our State 
and for our region, but, sadly, our in-
frastructure has not grown with our 
community. We need seamless trans-
portation networks to connect Wake 
County to the rest of the Nation—mod-
ern infrastructure that can help us 
bring the innovation that happens in 
the Research Triangle to the country 
and to the world. 
This historic legislation will help us, 
our people, get to work and school and 
products 
from 
our 
groundbreaking 
companies get to markets across Amer-
ica and around the globe. 
In North Carolina, there are about 
1,500 bridges and more than 3,000 high-
ways in poor condition. This bill will 
devote $110 billion to upgrade roads and 
bridges and finance other major trans-

Over the next 20 years, North Caro-
lina’s drinking water infrastructure 
will require billions in additional fund-
ing. 
This bill provides funds to replace 
lead pipes in the country and help en-
sure that all of our children can enjoy 
clean drinking water. It will also ad-
dress the toxic threat of PFAS con-
tamination. 
This bill modernizes our Nation’s 
electric grid to protect against storm 
damage and unlock the full potential 
of clean energy. It also creates jobs in 
the clean energy manufacturing sector, 
a sector where our State is positioned 
to lead the Nation. 
In addition, it expands broadband 
connectivity in underserved commu-

students and businesses can access de-
pendable, affordable internet. 
The jobs created by this infrastruc-
ture package are jobs that cannot be 
outsourced. This package will boost all 
of our workers, from the folks who 
pave the roads to the scientists and en-
gineers who are designing 21st century 
transportation networks, more effi-
cient water and sewer systems, and 
cutting edge electrical grids. 
Thanks to this package, engineering 
graduates from schools like North 
Carolina State and graduates from 
Wake 
Tech, 
Shaw, 
and 
St. 
Augustine’s—all in my district—will 
help build the bridges in our commu-
nities that one day many years from 
now they will proudly show their 
grandchildren. 
We are delivering on the President’s 
promise to pass legislation that im-
proves the lives of ordinary people and 
creates good-paying jobs. 
This bill is a testament to what we 
can achieve when we give bipartisan-
ship a chance, when we set our dif-
ferences aside and commit to the hard 
work of finding common ground. 
This is good for North Carolina and 
great for the country.

Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
may I ask how much time is remain-
ing. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania has 3 min-
utes remaining. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. COSTA). 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Congressman CARTWRIGHT, 
for allowing me the opportunity to 
speak on the bipartisan infrastructure 
package. The fact of the matter is, this 
is long overdue. 
We have been living off the invest-
ments our parents and our grand-
parents made a generation or two ago. 
During most of the 20th century, Amer-
ica led the world in investment in its 
water, in its transportation, in its elec-
trical grid, all the things that have 
made us the great country that we are. 
In recent decades, we have lagged be-
hind. We now rank 13th in the world in 
terms of the amount of investment 
that we make in American people be-
cause investing in our water, in our 
transportation, 
in 
our 
roads 
and 
bridges, in our internet system, that is 
investing in people. That is investing 
in people who create jobs that make 
the economy better. 
As a result of the passage of this bi-
partisan infrastructure bill, for the 
first time in a long time, America will 
lead the world next year in invest-
ments in the future in our water, our 
transportation, our electrical grid, and 
all the things that are a part of this 
piece of legislation. 
We can’t just take our eye off the 
ball. We have to continue these invest-
ments. In California, in the San Joa-
quin Valley that I represent, these in-
vestments are going to be billions of 
dollars in our water system. We have 
horrific droughts that we are experi-
encing right now. With climate change 
and the other efforts in this legislation 
to deal with the impacts of climate 
change, we need to ensure that we have 
a sustainable water supply in Cali-
fornia for our farms and farm commu-
nities, as well as ensuring that we have 
clean drinking water for rural areas 
that don’t have it today. This legisla-
tion does just that. 
This legislation also takes an oppor-
tunity to look at the other areas that 
we need to do in the next piece of legis-
lation: childcare for millions of women 
who want to get back to work; and pro-
viding 
efforts 
to 
improve 
our 
healthcare system, to fully fund the 
Affordable Care Act, a promise we 
made 11 years ago. 
My district had 25 percent uninsured. 
Eleven years later, only 10 percent of 
my district is uninsured. These are the 
kind of investments we need to make 
in people. 
I thank my colleagues for supporting 
this effort. Yesterday was a wonderful 
afternoon with the President, with my 
colleagues, Republicans and Democrats 
alike, to really celebrate the fact that 
we are beginning to do what the Amer-
ican people sent us to do, which is get 
the job done and invest in our country. 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Madam Speaker, 
I yield back the balance of my time.

ECONOMIC CRUELTY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
we are going to do a couple of things 
tonight. Most of it is going to be eco-
nomic heavy. We are going to actually 
go over the Democrat’s social spending 
bill and its economic effects. 
First, I wanted to touch on some-
thing that I am somewhat hopeful that 
the left and the right could embrace. I 
am thinking of what we have gone 
through for almost 2 years now, and 
that is the pandemic. If I came to you 
tomorrow and said: Okay. We have vac-
cinations, but we are about to have 
therapeutics. 
Think about this. You have all seen 
the news that we now have a second 
drug company. The Wall Street Jour-
nal today has an amazing, wonderful 
article on protease inhibitors and their 
effectiveness. The fact that Pfizer has 
publicly said their antiviral medica-
tion is up around 89 percent effective, 
it is a lot of pills that may need to be 
taken with a second pharmaceutical, 
but isn’t this the holy grail? 
We have talked about this over and 
over, saying you now have home 
COVID tests. Now you can take your 
antiviral at home. And you start to un-
derstand the elegance of how this type 
of antiviral works in sort of snipping 
the proteins and making them so they 
don’t grow or they can’t attach to the 
cell walls. 
So if this exists technology-wise, and 
one of the antivirals is already in front 
of the FDA today. I think we saw a 
news clip this afternoon that the sec-
ond one may be presented on Tuesday. 
The Pfizer pharmaceutical will be pre-
sented to the FDA, but it may take a 
month or so. 
If we are in a world now where we 
have multiple vaccines, we actually 
now have therapeutics and antiviral 
home testing kits—you can take the 
antiviral at home—it is time, once 
these are approved, to declare the pan-
demic over. 
Why is this really important? Think 
of the societal friction, the battles we 
have created by mask mandates, by 
vaccine mandates. We now see the data 
of how, in our labor supply, folks are 
saying: No, I believe in body autonomy. 
I am not taking the vaccine or doing 
this or doing that. 
The reality of it is, we have been so 
successful as a country, as a society, in 
believing in science. Remember, how 
many times did we hear that, believing 
in science? 
If the FDA approves, which we are 
hopeful maybe it happens in the next 
month, the antivirals—and the press 
releases from the pharmaceutical com-
panies are that there will be a couple 
hundred thousand sets by the end of 
this 
year 
and 
apparently 
millions 
available starting in the new year—it 
is time to declare the pandemic over. 
Our office has put together a piece of 
legislation, and we are going to put it 
in circulation once we have sort of vet-
ted it in the next couple of days. I 
would encourage any of my brothers 
and sisters on the left and the right 
that, if you believe in science and you 
really want a solution, it is time to 
embrace the fact of how far we have 
come and the solution is here. 
We are going to do a little bit of 
basic economics and try to tap some of 
the discussion that I think has been 
missed on the left’s social spending 
bill. 
First, let’s have an honest conversa-
tion on where we are economically 
right now and what our world looks 
like. If any of you are planning on hav-
ing a retirement, if any of you have 
children or grandchildren and you ac-
tually give a darn about them, first un-
derstand how much trouble we are in 
immediately, right now, today. 
The CBO numbers, in 29 years, we are 
at $112 trillion of borrowed money. 
That is inflation adjusted, 112 trillion 
public dollars. This isn’t borrowing 
where we take credit for borrowing 
from trust funds. This is publicly bor-
rowed, 
inflation-adjusted. 
Function-
ally, in 29 budget years, we are at $112 
trillion. That is the CBO estimate. 
If you are a young person—and you 
want to be honest with them—your 
economic future is about to be brutal-
ized. 
The reality of it is, I have done this 
on the floor multiple times. It is fas-
cinating how many on the left, and

November 16, 2021 
even the right, when you start to walk 
through what drives U.S. sovereign 
debt, it is a very uncomfortable con-
versation. 
The fact of the matter is, Medicare is 
the primary driver of U.S. sovereign 
debt. Social Security is second. The 
rest of the budget is in balance. 
At the end of the 30-year model, right 
now, according to the CBO, the rest of 
the budget, if you strip Medicare and if 
you strip Social Security out, the 
budget actually has a positive balance. 
If you believe it is a moral obligation 
for us to keep our promises that Medi-
care will be there, that Social Security 
will be there, why isn’t this what we 
work on every day instead of discus-
sions about how we can spend a whole 
bunch more money, take over a whole 
bunch more of the economy, slow the 
economy down and make this Nation 
poorer? 
What we are going to show is the eco-
nomic models that show the Demo-
crats’ spending bill actually crushes 
poor people. It actually makes the 
working poor poorer. It makes society 
poor. I don’t believe that is the inten-
tion, but it is the economics. 
Sometimes, when you get your math 
wrong, it is a level of cruelty. 
A simple thought experiment: What 
are the two things that you do to crush 
the working poor? Inflation. 
Well, we are doing a great job on 
that, aren’t we? The fact of the matter 
is, what inflation does to the working 
poor is economic cruelty. 
The second thing, you open your bor-
ders up, adding millions of individuals 
with similar skill sets. Say you are 
that individual that didn’t finish high 
school, but you are out there hanging 
drywall. You have a family. You are 
getting good at your profession. You 
are trying to learn how to move up. 
Then you flood the market with people 
with similar skill sets. 
There are great peer-reviewed papers 
out there that talk about just what we 
have done at the border. A decade from 
now, you made the working poor poor-
er and now overlay what all this spend-
ing has done inflation-wise. 
If we, as Members of Congress, give a 
darn about the working poor, the eco-
nomic violence that is being com-
mitted right now by the policies com-
ing out of this Congress, it is time to 
step up and deal with the reality. 
The problem is, the working poor 
aren’t our contributors. They are not 
the ones showing up here lobbying us. 
They are the individuals we have a 
moral obligation to do good things for, 
and that is not what is happening. 
We are going to walk through some 
of where we are today. You have to un-
derstand that the national debt right 
now is projected to leap to 200 percent 
in 2050, so, functionally, 29 budget cy-
cles from now. If the Biden proposals— 
these are the ones that were proposed 
during the election, and I have to ac-
cept a bunch of that has been trimmed 
back in the debate, not as much as you 
might think. We are going to go over 
that. 
You go, functionally, from 200 per-
cent of debt to GDP—meaning the bor-
rowed money will be 200 times bigger 
than the GDP. If you add it all up, in 
29 budget years, you are over 328 per-
cent of debt to GDP. 
If any of you are thinking about hav-
ing a retirement, if you are thinking 
about your kids, your grandkids, this is 
what wipes us out as a society. It is 
terrifying to talk about because it is 
hard. It requires lots of levers. 
You have to get immigration right. 
You have to get finance right. You 
have to get spending right. You have to 
get tax policy right. You have to do ev-
erything that maximizes economic ex-
pansion. Then the holy grail: You are 
going to have to crash the price of 
healthcare, not shift around who pays 
for it. 
Remember, the ACA, many of you 
know it as ObamaCare, the Republican 
alternative, Medicare for All, in many 
ways it is about who pays and who gets 
subsidized. It is not about what we pay. 
I cannot tell you how many times I 
have come to this floor and tried to 
drill that into the way we think. But 
instead, the scam here is we talk 
about: Well, you are going to get sub-
sidized. 
But we did nothing to what we pay. 
The 
difference 
is 
we 
just 
borrow 
money—that is, the Federal Govern-
ment—and pay for it that way. 
Even a 100 percent tax rate on small 
businesses, upper-class families—so a 
100 percent tax rate and you are taking 
every single dollar, you can’t even 
come close to balancing the budget and 
balancing it long term. The numbers 
are this ugly. 
b 1730 
When you take a look, it is not that 
hard. The 2050 number, if you take 
every dime even of folks who make $1 
million or $500,000, if you take every 
dime, you don’t get close. The numbers 
are this ugly. The share of Federal tax 
revenue spent on interest in the na-
tional debt is projected to surge. 
But here is the number that terrifies 
me: If we move up 2 points—2 points— 
functionally at the 2050, 2051 mark, 100 
percent of revenues—100 percent of rev-
enues—in that 30-year budget window, 
move up 2 points from where we are 
right now, our baseline, 100 percent of 
tax revenues will be just covering the 
interest costs. 
So is anyone familiar with a book 
that was called ‘‘The Black Swan’’? 
Okay, Taleb also wrote another book. 
And I understand, there are economists 
out there, Gilder and others, who dis-
agree with parts of the model. But 
there was one concept of making your-
self fragile. A simple example is you go 
to the airport 10 times; you know if 
you leave at exactly this moment you 
can get to the airport exactly as your 
flight is getting ready to board; and 
the first time there is a car accident, 
you miss your flight. We are doing that 
type of thing to our entire country, to 
my 6-year-old daughter, and to anyone 
else out there. 
We are living on a razor’s edge. 
Madam Speaker, you saw that last 
slide, 2 points moving back to what 
would be closer to normality interest- 
rate wise. In the 30-year budget win-
dow, 100 percent of revenues, receipts if 
you want to use the technical term, 
will go just to cover the interest. 
Madam Speaker, do you understand 
how fragile we have made the econom-
ics of this country? 
And then the debate here is how to 
spend 
more 
money. 
I 
understand 
money gets you reelected, and prom-
ising things gets you reelected. It gets 
nice contributions, and it is absolutely 
perverse when you think about where 
we are at. 
So now let’s talk about the budget 
gimmicks. Many of you are going to 
refer to this as the Build Back Better 
plan. In our office we are calling it the 
social spending plan because that is 
what it is. It is laced with gimmicks. It 
is going to be fascinating come Friday 
to see how CBO ultimately scores 
these. I’m a little disappointed on what 
we have seen from the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation and some of the 
others. I don’t think we are getting ac-
tual quality, dynamic scoring, but that 
is hard. It takes time. You have to lay 
it out, break it apart, and try to under-
stand what the economic effects are. 
But you walk through the gimmicks, 
Madam Speaker, and a simple example 
is the White House has estimated $400 
billion in some of the Joint Committee 
on Taxation scores from IRS collecting 
more money. But CBO came out and 
said: No, it is not $400 billion; it is 120. 
Then you start to realize, Madam 
Speaker, the debates you are hearing 
on the floor here are completely 
stacked with absolutely 
fraudulent 
numbers. 
I remember how hard—when we did 
tax reform—we had to work to justify 
dynamic scoring and make the math as 
honest as possible to work, and it was 
our brothers and sisters on the left who 
absolutely were insistent. Today they 
would never hold themselves to the 
same standard that they demanded 
from us just a couple of years ago. 
So let’s walk through an example of 
one of the absolute frauds that the left 
is using. So President Trump had a 
drug rebate. This is a little geeky, but 
it is important to understand. Ulti-
mately, the rebate was going to be to 
the consumer. So you are on Medicare, 
you are in line at the pharmacy, the re-
bate that would have gone into the 
backside of the provider, the acquirer, 
think of it as the wholesaler of the 
pharmaceutical, that rebate now comes 
to you at the counter. It means the 
consumer would get the value, but it 
would mean the costs of pharma-
ceuticals would go up for government 
because the government isn’t ulti-
mately getting that value. 
So here are sort of the steps of the 
Trump administration’s rebate rule: it 
was estimated to cost about $150 billion 
over 10 years. 
Speaker PELOSI said: It will never 
happen.

November 16, 2021 
Democratic leadership here said: It 
will never happen. 
Democrat leadership in the Senate 
said: Unacceptable, it will never hap-
pen. 
This was never, ever, ever, ever going 
to happen. 
This was the whole system of how the 
consumer would have gotten the ben-
efit of those rebates, but it would have 
cost the Federal Government $150 bil-
lion over 10 years, but it was never 
going to happen unless, of course, you 
are a Democrat looking for money to 
spend on their social entitlement bill, 
all of a sudden saying: Hey, this is 
never going to happen, but we can 
score it in, so we are going to use it. 
It is just another gimmick, it is a 
con, and it is a fraud. If we were doing 
this, we would be ashamed of ourselves 
and should be. But this is actually the 
scam that now is Democrat leadership. 
So you take a look at the budget 
gimmicks that are already built into 
here, Madam Speaker, and you start to 
realize the left’s social spending bill is 
like a house of cards. Now, they may 
get some scoring. Like the last one I 
was just showing you, Madam Speaker, 
CBO will give them that $150 billion. 
There will be a nice little footnote say-
ing that this was never really going to 
become policy but because it was a pro-
posal and they are canceling the pro-
posal, we are going to give them the 150 
or maybe $145 billion worth of credit. 
But the public needs to understand 
those trillions and trillions and tril-
lions—$112 trillion in the baseline as it 
is right now in 29 budget years—that is 
how you get there. 
The left will say: This is paid for. 
No. It is not. And they know that. 
They are not dumb. They are manipu-
lative, but they are not dumb. When 
you start to look at just the games 
being done, Madam Speaker, and then 
the spending—and that is the other 
thing we are going to work through 
here is how much of this spending do 
they really plan to cancel in year 2? 
So, Madam Speaker, you are seeing 
some spending scoring saying that we 
estimate this is $13⁄4
trillion, wink, 
wink, nod, nod, but when it becomes a 
10-year instead of disappearing in the 
second year, you are 41⁄2 plus trillion 
dollars of new obligations. 
Look up and down the different budg-
et gimmicks. One of the reasons I did 
this slide is because it is a little more 
of an economically difficult concept. 
So you actually have in there an ad-
justed gross income surcharge on the 
top income earners. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
you 
know 
the 
Democrats’ proposal is to do a very 
similar thing on corporations. The al-
ternative minimum tax that is also 
being put on corporations; we are just 
now starting to model how much it ac-
tually will slow down the economy. 
Here is why: You have this thing we 
call expensing. It was one of the great 
economic drivers particularly in 2018 
and 2019. Do you remember we far ex-
ceeded revenue projections, Madam 
Speaker, 
income 
inequality 
truly 
shrank, poverty shrank, and food inse-
curity shrank? The poor got dramati-
cally less poor. They were 2 amazing 
years. It is a great model to dem-
onstrate what supply-side economics 
really does. 
But a lot of the economic expansion 
was because of something called ex-
pensing. So you buy a piece of equip-
ment, it makes your company more 
productive, and you are able to pay 
people more. It moves technology and 
moves 
business 
production 
forward 
into the next century. 
If you do a minimum alternative tax 
at a corporate level, then you no longer 
get the economic value of that expens-
ing. I know this is really geeky, but it 
is really important to understand. We 
are just now starting to model this 
thing saying: Oh, heavens, so the 
Democrats are doing the wink, wink, 
nod, nod con of they are not taking 
away the expensing which is the pri-
mary driver that we saw in produc-
tivity from the last 2 years since tax 
reform, but by doing this alternative 
minimum tax calculation, you don’t 
get the value of that depreciation. All 
of a sudden, the investment in capital 
products—capital goods and capital 
equipment—will disappear. It is an-
other example of a really bad under-
standing of the most basic economics. 
I can understand why the left wants 
to do this. It is the number of new IRS 
agents, the number of agencies that 
will have potentially hundreds of thou-
sands of new employees. Remember, 
one of the models was 80,000 new IRS 
employees. Well, okay, maybe it makes 
sense if I was on the Democrat side or 
I represented northern Virginia or 
areas like that where I have lots of 
unionized 
government-working 
con-
stituents. But we need to be honest 
about that, the build back better, the 
social spending bill on the left, mas-
sively increases the bureaucracy. 
You start to look at the hundreds of 
millions that are being put in to ex-
pand the size of the national bureauc-
racy. It is not like we are doing the 
leap of technology saying that with the 
investment it is going to make society 
more productive. It is like our argu-
ment of air quality and environmental 
quality, using technology is the way to 
make us healthier. Instead, the left de-
signs it in ways where there are new 
armies of public employees. 
I have to congratulate the left. 
Madam Speaker, you are going to see 
some slides here. We are going to be 
number one. Yes. The United States 
will be absolutely number one in the 
highest tax rates on income in the en-
tire industrialized world. 
But we are starting to see if you are 
a resident of California, you are going 
to be about 64.7 percent for top income 
earners and high income earners. Fine. 
If you are in Arizona you are going to 
be at 55.9. 
New York gets the prize. They are 
going to be over 66 percent for top in-
come earners when you do the Federal, 
the surcharges, State, and local taxes. 
Don’t we have lots of data already in 
the economic literature of what hap-
pens when we start to hit these confis-
catory levels of tax on income? 
What do people do? 
You start to realize saying, okay, I 
can work and get this tax rate, or I can 
take my resources and put them in 
other 
types 
of 
things—municipal 
bonds, other types of things—and reap 
the rewards from that because if more 
than half of the upper income now goes 
to government, then we have just cre-
ated an incentive not to invest and not 
to take risks but just take the money, 
put it in safe places, and don’t play 
anymore. 
I am frustrated because I know the 
Tax Foundation has been trying to 
model the taxes but we don’t have good 
data yet on what does this mean in fu-
ture GDP growth. 
Back to the very first board we held 
up: our society is heading towards a 
debt cliff. The baseline as it is today 
from CBO in 29 budget years, we are at 
$112 trillion in borrowed money in to-
day’s dollars, and that is where policy 
is today. 
When you start to do this, and eco-
nomic growth slows, then you func-
tionally bring the financial apocalypse 
a lot sooner. 
So let’s actually also talk through a 
couple other duplicities that are in the 
Democrats’ build back better social 
spending bill. They sure do like rich 
people. 
Two-thirds of the millionaires get a 
tax cut under the build back better, 
and if we take the folks getting over $1 
million, 66 percent of them actually 
benefit. And this is one of the things 
we have come to the floor now for al-
most a year talking about instead of 
raising taxes—and the rhetoric that we 
hear over and over from the left where 
the rich need to pay their fair share— 
maybe we should just stop subsidizing 
them. 
We have come to the floor over and 
over and shown that almost $1.4 tril-
lion of subsidies go to the very top, 
top, top income earners. If you stop the 
subsidy, Madam Speaker, then you 
don’t create the economic distortions. 
So this is the great scam: Democrats 
are saying, We are going to raise the 
taxes, these surcharges, but then we 
are going to turn around, and as long 
as these rich people do what we ask 
them to do—they buy the right type of 
solar panels, the right type of electric 
car—then we are going to turn around 
and hand them cash.

Now that is something that the vast 
majority of Americans will never be 
able to afford, but you will be happy to 
know that the Democrats’ plan is to 
subsidize the rich. And it gets even 
darker. 
So now the Democrats are going to 
put in SALT, State and Local Tax de-
duction. And the great thing is, if you 
make $1 million a year, it looks like 
you are going to get the vast majority,

you are going to get the highest 
amount of this money. But for the pop-
ulation that is $400,000 and up, they get 
the majority of the SALT. It is, once 
again, the Democrats subsidizing the 
rich and the really rich. 
And for everyone else who is func-
tionally making $150,000 and less, you 
don’t get anything. You don’t get any 
value here. How can this be? 
I mean, am I living in a parallel uni-
verse where the rhetoric from the left 
is, tax rich people; wink, wink, nod, 
nod. Not only do we subsidize them 
when they buy the things we want 
them to buy; but then we are going to 
give them additional tax benefits. We 
are going to make additional things 
they spend money on deductible; and 
the rest of the population just be 
screwed. 
I grabbed this one, it substantially 
basically makes some other points. So 
think of this: In the Democrats’ social 
spending bill, best as I can identify it, 
there is about $100 billion to finance 
amnesty. Okay. So it functionally 
gives a 5-year visa to millions of folks 
who are here undocumented illegally. 
But you remember our earlier discus-
sion? What are the two things you do 
to create economic violence to the 
working poor? Inflation. Well, too 
many—remember 
our 
elementary 
school economics class? Too many dol-
lars chasing too few goods. 
So the left put out lots and lots and 
lots of money to people’s bank ac-
counts because that is great politics; 
instead of using those resources to say 
we are going to make our society more 
efficient, more clean, more productive. 
And that productivity means you can 
pay people more, and you have a soci-
ety that grows, and then maybe we can 
take on our debt problem. 
But we did it just backwards. So now 
you get to see what Keynesian econom-
ics looks like. And are you enjoying 
the inflation yet? Because it looks like 
it is going to continue to pop. And 
then, flooding society with lots of 
other low-skilled workers. 
Okay. Well, it will be interesting to 
see how long it is before the left actu-
ally has to come in here and say we 
need to do additional subsidies to the 
working poor because we stuck it to 
them. 
And look; if anyone has a question, 
we have multiple papers, university 
peer-reviewed papers talking about 
how the Democrats’ plan actually will 
make the poor poorer by the end of the 
decade. University of Chicago, four 
Ph.D. economists published a paper a 
couple of weeks ago showing that the 
lowest quartile of income—and I de-
spise the term quartiles, but that is 
what economists use—will be poorer at 
the end of the decade. 
Now, a lot of that is because of the 
Democrats’ unwillingness to attach the 
benefits to learning job skills, to actu-
ally working. They have severed those. 
You would have thought we learned 
that during the Clinton years, when 
you rewarded work, rewarded going 
and gaining job skills—we are going 
back to the bad old days of saying, if 
you want to just not work, you will be 
happy. As long as you vote for the 
right party, we are going to send you a 
check. 
Does anyone see the cruelty here? 
Now, there are some things in this 
spending that look—endangered plants, 
okay, it is $4.9 million. Desert fish, 
okay, $4.9 million. Fresh water mus-
sels, which are actually a real problem, 
but it is $19 million. And everyone un-
derstands the difference between $1 
million and billions. 
So $100 billion for amnesty, but $19 
million for functionally—we will call it 
invasive species and protecting others. 
It is like the drop of a bucket in an 
ocean wave. But it gives you a sense 
where—so the Democrats get a nice 
talking point, but the math is abso-
lutely perverse. 
Ultimately, over the next decade, 
you have got to deal with this one way 
or the other. Either what the left is 
doing is when—you are going to see the 
scoring this Friday of how many pro-
grams saying, well, we are going to 
spend all this money on a transfer pay-
ment, European style transfer pay-
ment, but it is only for 2 years; wink, 
wink, nod, nod. A future Congress 
won’t continue it. 
You all remember the fraud of the 
last time we had—Speaker PELOSI a 
decade ago—and there were multiple 
spending bills, where the way they fit 
into something called PAYGO is, we 
are going to spend this much, this 
much, but on the fifth year we are 
going to just pretend the program no 
longer spends any money. 
Well, this is now the more modern 
version of that fraud that was com-
mitted financially, budgetarily, is we 
are going to spend the money for a 
year or two, and then we are going to 
pretend it stops; and that way we hit 
certain budget boxes to meet the rec-
onciliation; wink, wink, nod, nod. Will 
the voters be paying attention to it? 
But let’s say they are honest. It is 
not likely, but let’s say that honestly 
that is not the scam; that they fully in-
tend to spend all this money, get them-
selves through the next election, and 
then stop the spending. 
Well, in that case, the taxes are per-
manent because the taxes don’t expire, 
even though, what we can tell best 
from the revenues, they don’t come 
close to covering all the spending. 
And if the spending is made perma-
nent, the social entitlement transfers, 
over the 10 years, this is trillions and 
trillions of dollars out of balance. 
I understand—and, look, this is one 
of my great sins, and I think a lot of us 
on the conservative side, we sound like 
accountants on steroids. 
You know, we come and talk about 
GDP and workforce, labor force partici-
pation. But the fact of the matter is, if 
you care for people, if you believe 
growth, economic growth is moral; 
that it provides opportunities; that 
that is how you save for retirement; 
that is how you help your child go to 
college; that is how you have a better 
house, a better life; it is the opportuni-
ties that growth creates. So when you 
see someone like me come behind the 
microphone and talk about GDP and 
the benefits it brings, it is a number. It 
is classical economics. It is also that 
poor family that is trying to be less 
poor. 
And the tax foundation has done a 
bunch of modeling that makes it pretty 
darn clear that the left social spending 
bill is going to make our entire society 
poorer. When you start to look at these 
numbers over the decade, and at the 
end of decade, we won’t have grown as 
much. 
We are going to be missing—I mean, 
in a decade, we are missing a half a 
trillion dollars of economic growth, of 
GDP. 
You remember our very first board? 
What is—for my little girl, for every-
one else out there, this is what wipes 
us out as a society. This is the thing 
that this body is terrified to talk 
about. And this is already the baseline. 
The baseline from CBO already says, 
in 29 budget years, we are $112 trillion 
of borrowed money, and that is assum-
ing really stable interest rates. That is 
assuming no more wars. It is assuming 
no more major recessions. 
We were doing one attempt to try to 
calculate these numbers. So the Penn 
Wharton model, that was published ac-
tually today, where they were trying 
to figure out how much more it would 
add to the debt. So the Penn Wharton 
model said, if the spending is contin-
ued, which is the obvious thing that is 
going to happen, it adds 24.4 percent to 
the debt. Okay. Now we didn’t have 
enough time to break through all their 
tables, and we will work through that. 
But just off the top of your head, $112 
trillion, if you added 24.4 percent on it, 
that is close to $140 trillion of borrowed 
money; 139 something. 
You have got to understand, this is 
what the left is leading us to, instead 
of coming in and saying, we are going 
to protect Medicare by investing in 
things that cure. 
Remember, this Medicare dollar? You 
know, $77 trillion plus of borrowing in 
the next 29 years, just to cover the 
Medicare portion shortfall? 31 percent 
of that is just diabetes. 
You could have a connection here be-
tween the left and the right saying, we 
are going to do an operation warp 
speed and go at diabetes because it 
turns out by curing the misery you 
also have a major effect on the debt. 
That is creativity, that is being ration-
al. Instead of trying to buy your next 
election, and pretending to finance it 
with a whole bunch of gimmicks that 
don’t really create revenues; that are 
going to create borrowed money. 
And it is not CBO, it is not me. It is 
the 
outside 
groups 
that 
play 
it 
straight. Tell Penn Wharton and others 
that they are lying, because they have 
done the—I think they underscore eco-
nomic growth on some things.

But the fact of the matter is, if the 
left is about to pass a piece of legisla-
tion at the end of this week that looks 
like it is likely to add another 24.4 per-
cent to the debt, does anyone see the 
level of immorality in wiping out eco-
nomic growth and the opportunity? 
And we had a couple of years there 
where it was working. The fact of the 
matter is 2018, 2019 were Goldilocks, 
and it was done because we invested in 
the things that create opportunity and 
growth, instead of the model right now, 
where the left is going to invest in 
things that functionally slow economic 
growth down; make individuals depend-
ent 
on 
the 
Federal 
Government; 
disincentivize 
participating 
in 
the 
economy? 
And if any of you have ever read any 
of your textbooks from what the world 
looked like in the 70s, where the last 
time the left did something very simi-
lar to this, the societal breakdowns, 
the inflation, the misery. Once again, 
we are about to see the financing of 
misery instead of investing in the 
things that actually would create op-
portunity and growth. We are better 
than this. 
I know it would take someone on the 
Democrats’ side. They would have to 
stand up to their base and explain basic 
economics. But there is a path that 
works. And if you give a darn about the 
poor, the working poor, the middle 
class, ultimately, the data says, at the 
end of the decade if the left passes 
their Build Back Better social entitle-
ment spending bill, they are going to 
be poorer. That is what we are about to 
do to this country, and this place 
should be ashamed. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

b 1800 
MOST EXPENSIVE THANKSGIVING 
IN HISTORY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Utah (Mr. OWENS) for 
30 minutes. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to be here today with the Utah 
House delegation to say a few words 
ahead of the Thanksgiving season to 
those we are so fortunate to represent 
here in Washington. We all agree that 
it is a blessing, as a team, to represent 
the great State of Utah. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. STEWART), my 
friend from Utah’s Second District. 
Mr. STEWART. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Mr. OWENS, my friend, for orga-
nizing this event and for his interest in 
something that I think every American 
shares. 
I have a young family. I have six 
kids. Many of them are just young cou-
ples. They are starting their careers; 
they are starting their families; and 
they are starting to make their way in 
the world and their mark on life. 
If you are a young family, you know 
what it is like to go to the grocery 
store and to pay more every week than 
you paid the week before. You know 
what it is like to fill up your pickup 
and have it cost more every week than 
you paid the week before. 
The reason you are driving a pickup 
is because you are a working Amer-
ican. You are not driving a big pickup 
around the city. You are driving a big 
pickup because that is what you use to 
work, whether you work on farming 
and ranching, like I did when I was 
young, or whether you are working 
construction, or whether you are work-
ing and going down to the docks. Those 
are the folks who are paying the price. 
If you are wealthy, if you are afflu-
ent, if you don’t go shopping but have 
someone who shops for you, if you 
don’t fill up your vehicle yourself be-
cause you have someone who fills up 
the vehicle for you and then picks you 
up, you may not realize what a painful 
thing this is for Americans. But the 
vast majority of Americans do their 
own shopping. The vast majority of 
Americans struggle paycheck to pay-
check. The vast majority of Americans 
know what a painful experience we find 
ourselves in now. 
After only 10 months of President 
Biden, Americans are facing the worst 
inflation they have seen in 31 years. 
Democrats keep saying these prices are 
only temporary. 
We are told that all the time. We 
have been told that by the Secretary of 
the Treasury. We have been told that 
by the Chairman of the Fed. We have 
been told that by the President. And 
they continue to say that. 
But the truth is that $4 trillion in 
spending, when he says it is zero dol-
lars that it will cost, the American 
people aren’t stupid, and they know 
that is not true. They know inflation 
when they see it. 
The consequences of this President’s 
tax and spend agenda hits Americans, 
as I have already said, in their every-
day lives. It hits Americans when the 
price of heating jumps from $574 to 
$746, which is what the Energy Infor-
mation Administration predicts it will 
cost the average house this winter. 
It is a tough choice when you have 
some people who say: Hey, we would 
like to have it warm. We would like for 
our little children to be comfortable. 
But we want to be able to buy the food 
that we want for them, other than just 
macaroni and cheese. 
Some people are left with that deci-
sion. 
It hits Americans at their Thanks-
giving table. As we have said over and 
over again, this will be the most expen-
sive Thanksgiving in American his-
tory, when frozen turkeys cost an aver-
age of 22 percent more than they did 
just last year. 
What does the President do to allevi-
ate some of this financial strain and 
the pressure that so many American 
families are feeling? Unfortunately, he 
does the same thing again and the 
same thing more, the very same poli-
cies that put us in the hole. 
Here is the reality. There is no polit-
ical spin for any Democrat. Americans 
will not be reassured by empty prom-
ises from those who don’t see inflation 
coming in the first place, and President 
Biden cannot wish away this cost-of- 
living crisis, no matter how much he 
would like to do that. 
From day one in office, President 
Biden’s mission was clear. He wants 
the American people to rely on the 
government from cradle to grave. 
To sell his agenda, he is telling 
Americans that more taxing, more 
spending, and more mandating will 
solve the financial problems. But this 
is just economic nonsense; it is an eco-
nomic fairy tale; and this one has a 
scary ending, the kind that only 
George Orwell could imagine. 
But because it is Thanksgiving, we 
can be thankful that we know how to 
solve these problems. If we didn’t know 
how to solve them, it would be much 
more worrying, much more stressful. 
But the truth is, we know how to solve 
them. Congress simply needs to start 
expanding 
that 
opportunity, 
not 
shrinking it with mandate after man-
date. Congress needs to start empow-
ering the people, not expanding bu-
reaucracy with tax after tax. Indi-
vidual liberty must always triumph 
over government dependence. 
If President Biden cannot accept that 
reality, we can expect more of what we 
have seen and felt over the last 10 
months. If he can’t understand that 
people, not the government, are the 
key to our success, American culture, 
American businesses, and American 
families will reap the results. 
I sincerely hope that he will. I sin-
cerely hope the President will look at 
the pain the American people are feel-
ing and will recognize the responsi-
bility he has not to make it worse, not 
to keep doing the same thing and just 
do it harder and faster, not to do the 
same thing and just excuse it away, 
but to try to do something different. 
Until then, I am afraid we will see 
much of the same. 
I think I speak not only for Repub-
licans on this, but many independents 
and many Democrats feel the same 
way. We hear from them when we go 
back home as well. 
I thank Mr. OWENS for organizing 
this on this incredibly important sub-
ject. It is an honor to be with him. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. CUR-
TIS), my friend from Utah’s Third Dis-
trict. 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to join my voice with my Utah 
colleagues, vocalizing our great con-
cern about the runaway inflation im-
pacting Americans across the country. 
I remember the inflation of the 1970s. 
When I bought my first home, we as-
sumed a loan at 12 percent interest and 
thought that that was a bargain at the 
time. I remember what it is like to lose 
15 percent of the value of a savings ac-
count in just 1 year.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6312 
November 16, 2021 
I saw firsthand the devastation to 
our senior citizens and those on a fixed 
income with runaway inflation. 
Here we are, 40 years later, pre-
tending that trillions of dollars of 
wasted government spending is okay 
and that it won’t impact inflation. 
Madam Speaker, in the simplest 
terms, 
inflation 
is 
financially 
handcuffing the American people and 
their families, which is further evi-
denced by the fact that the Consumer 
Price Index is now showing the highest 
level in over 30 years. That is not okay. 
The White House tells us not to 
worry about inflation; it is all under 
control. I think Utahns know better. 
They see the gas prices, and they see 
the difference they pay at the grocery 
stores. 
Utahns, specifically, have seen their 
gas prices rise by over 70 percent this 
last year. What is the response from 
Washington, D.C.? We can fix this. All 
we need to do is spend trillions of dol-
lars more. 
Seriously? Employers can’t find em-
ployees to do the work, and the Presi-
dent touts his $1.2 trillion infrastruc-
ture bill as job-creating. 
We also know that inflation is an 
unlegislated tax on hardworking Amer-
icans, most notably some of our most 
vulnerable communities, like low-in-
come communities and rural commu-
nities with less access to goods and 
services. 
But instead of focusing on finding 
ways to address critical supply chain 
shortages, to lower our energy costs 
through policies designed to generate 
more independence on energy, and to 
address 
the 
growing 
behavioral 
healthcare crisis, we are doing just the 
opposite. We shut down U.S. pipelines 
and then ask our enemies to produce 
more dirty oil. 
Here are the facts: 40 percent of all 
the money printed in the history of 
this country was printed in the last 20 
months. Forty percent of all the money 
printed in the history of this country 
was printed in the last 20 months. 
Congress has already authorized, just 
this year alone, $3 trillion of additional 
spending in addition to our normal 
spending, and we are about to spend 
another $2 trillion. 
It is hard to get your arms around 
what is a trillion dollars. Let me put 
this in perspective. This $5 trillion of 
spending is approximately $25,000 for 
every man, woman, and child in the 
United States. It gets worse. Thirty 
years from now, unless we pay that 
money back—and I don’t think any-
body believes we will have paid it 
back—that is now three-quarters of a 
million dollars for every man, woman, 
and child just in extra spending this 
year. That is not okay. 
It is simply time to stop the bleeding 
and time to earnestly focus on bipar-
tisan solutions that will address the 
growing needs of the American people. 
We literally cannot afford to play 
partisan politics at the expense of our 
constituents and, more importantly, 
our children and grandchildren and our 
future generations. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. 
MOORE), my friend from Utah’s First 
District. 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Madam Speak-
er, it is very much an honor to share 
the podium with my colleagues from 
Utah. Utah is a very special, very 
unique place. 
At this time of Thanksgiving, I 
would like to focus on what Utah real-
ly is. We often get lauded as having the 
lowest unemployment in the country 
and the strongest economy in the coun-
try, or as the fastest growing State in 
the country. What Utah is, is the most 
philanthropic State in the country. It 
shares more volunteer hours and dol-
lars than any other State. That is the 
type of stuff that our delegation and 
Members of Congress, the community 
that we serve, are really proud of. We 
reflect on that often, particularly dur-
ing this time of year. 
We are more than a week away from 
Thanksgiving Day. Like Utahns across 
the State, my family—and I have three 
little boys, a fourth boy on the way, 
and an amazing wife who deals with a 
lot during this crazy time of my time 
in Washington. We look forward to this 
annual opportunity to come together, 
enjoy each other’s company, and give 
thanks for all of our many blessings. 
Turkey and stuffing are staples, but 
each Thanksgiving Day looks a little 
different from the last. That is okay. 
Unfortunately, 
this 
year’s 
Thanks-
giving is going to be much more dif-
ficult than others. 
Americans are bracing for this year’s 
turkey tax, which we expect to be the 
most expensive in modern history as 
inflation rates hit their highest level in 
decades. 
My colleagues from Utah can talk 
about this a little bit better than I can 
because they are a little bit older than 
I am, but they talk about how this 
hasn’t been this high in the last 40 
years. That is how old I am. 
I don’t want to experience this type 
of inflation. I haven’t had to yet, and I 
am very concerned about what we are 
going to have to experience. 
That was not a cut at their age. 
According to the Department of 
Labor, the Consumer Price Index for 
October was 6.2 percent, the highest in 
over three decades. This high rate 
means that, compared to last year, 
home heating will be 50 percent more 
expensive, a gallon of gas will be 61 per-
cent more expensive, and the cost of 
groceries will be 5.4 percent more ex-
pensive. Beef is 20 percent higher; pork 
is 14 percent higher; and the cost of 
used cars is 26 percent higher. 
This is data. This is directly related 
to policy decisions here in Washington. 
As Utahns get ready to celebrate 
Thanksgiving and find reprieve from 
this challenging past year-and-a-half, 
inflation is threatening to stifle this 
entire time of year. 
In fact, real wages have decreased in 
7 of President Biden’s first 9 months in 
office. As President Biden rushes to 
spend trillions more, as he is doing 
now, to spend trillions more as of this 
week, economic pressure will only con-
tinue to drive everyday costs up and 
incomes down. 
The Wall Street Journal editorial 
board said: ‘‘The current burst of infla-
tion isn’t an accident. . . . This is the 
result of reckless policy.’’ This is sim-
ply incompetence. 
CNN noted President Biden’s $1.9 tril-
lion American Rescue Plan fueled in-
flation by sparking demand that it 
could not keep pace with. 
Even The Washington Post editorial 
board—I did not expect to ever be using 
sort of liberal media outlets to defend 
some of my points when I came to the 
House floor. But The Washington Post 
says that you cannot ignore that the 
American Rescue Plan bears some of 
this blame. 
b 1815 
We cannot simply spend more. We 
have to stop President Biden’s tax-and- 
spend monstrosity. 
All of this comes as the administra-
tion botched a military exit from Af-
ghanistan, created a sustained crisis at 
the border, and has failed to address a 
looming debt crisis. 
With this as the backdrop, Thanks-
giving may feel uniquely challenging. 
Yet, through the most difficult times 
in our Nation’s history, Thanksgiving 
Day has been a celebration when com-
munities come together to give thanks 
for life’s great blessings. 
Following the Battle of Gettysburg 
in October of 1863, President Lincoln 
proclaimed Thanksgiving to be a na-
tional holiday to ‘‘heal the wounds of 
the Nation.’’ 
As our Nation experiences great chal-
lenges, I can’t think of a better holiday 
to observe this coming week. 
My colleagues and I in the Utah dele-
gation are working every day to carve 
a more prosperous path forward for our 
State and communities. There is hope 
on the horizon. 
Earlier this month, Democrats and 
Republicans in this House came to-
gether to pass the Fiscal State of the 
Nation Resolution, which I cospon-
sored. If agreed to in the Senate, this 
resolution will mandate the U.S. Comp-
troller General conduct an annual joint 
session before the members of the 
House and Senate Budget Committees 
to provide a report on the fiscal health 
of our Nation. 
This is a huge, important time to 
have done something like that after 
what we have seen over the last year. 
This expertise would provide our lead-
ers with the information they need to 
correct our course and back away from 
our patterns of destructive spending. 
Back home, I have also convened a 
debt and deficit task force, which has 
provided me an opportunity to work 
with local leaders to begin crafting in-
novative solutions to our Nation’s debt 
crisis. 
My colleagues from Utah and I genu-
inely hope to help those in our home

State find more blessings in the days, 
months, and years ahead. As we work 
toward those brighter days, let us re-
flect and be grateful for the good mo-
ments we have had this year. 
Though our year has been filled with 
difficulty, it has also been filled with, 
in the words of Lincoln, ‘‘the blessings 
of fruitful fields and healthful skies.’’ 
Today, I am back in Washington with 
my colleagues to continue the impor-
tant work we do on behalf of Utahns. I 
look forward to next week when I will 
join my family and the community in 
Utah in celebrating this important hol-
iday. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, before 
I get started, I just want to say what 
an honor it is to serve with my friends 
from Utah. They are remarkable men. 
As the holiday season approaches and 
families across our great Nation gather 
for these special moments, I am re-
minded of what brings us all together 
as Americans: Not our creed, race, or 
ZIP Code, but the gratitude for one an-
other that lifts us higher and brings 
out the best in each of us. 
I am the father of 6 children and 15 
grandchildren. My pride doesn’t come 
from my years on the football field or 
decades in the corporate world. It 
comes from the joy of watching them 
grow up and start families of their 
own. I am so deeply thankful for them 
and the entire Owens family. 
To my fellow Utahns: I am thankful 
to call Utah’s 4th District my home. It 
is the honor of a lifetime to represent 
our State. I am constantly inspired by 
the resiliency of our communities. 
We have faced a couple of very dif-
ficult years. The COVID–19 pandemic 
kept us from our friends, families, and 
loved ones. Disruptions from work, 
school, and worship made everyday life 
very different. There are empty seats 
at the table this year. We pray for com-
fort and healing for those families as 
they navigate this time of grief. 
With the current economic crisis at 
home, rising prices at the gas station, 
grocery store, and everywhere in be-
tween, more and more Utah families 
are worried about losing a job, keeping 
the doors of their small business open, 
paying their mortgage, and making 
ends meet. 
Even during the toughest of times, I 
know the spirit of Utahns. I have seen 
how families across our State have 
helped each other through dark times 
toward better and brighter days. 
I am wishing all Utahns good health, 
especially the men and women who 
have put on the uniform to serve in our 
great State, across the country, and 
abroad. They make the world and our 
country a safer place. 
Especially during the holidays, I 
think Norman Rockwell’s Four Free-
doms are very appropriate: The Free-
dom of Speech, the Freedom to Wor-
ship, the Freedom From Want, and the 
Freedom From Fear. This is the Amer-
ican way. This is the American Dream. 
As Americans, we hold these freedoms 
incredibly dear and commit to protect 
them for future generations. 
It is within our DNA to confront our 
crises and weather rough storms to 
leave our country a little bit better 
than we found it for our children and 
our children’s children. 
This season of thanksgiving, I hope 
that we can continue to support one 
another and unite in our shared grati-
tude. Despite our daily struggles, we 
have so much to be thankful for. I pray 
that Utahns across our beautiful State 
will continue to be blessed this holiday 
season. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the senior 
member of our delegation, CHRIS STEW-
ART. 
Mr. 
STEWART. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what an honor it is to be here with my 
friends, people that I have tremendous 
respect for, colleagues, people who love 
their country and want to serve their 
country. 
Several of them have said something 
that I think is worth emphasizing, and 
that is, for example, when Mr. CURTIS 
talks about 40 percent of the money 
that was printed in the history of this 
country was printed in the last several 
months, I am not sure that that is easy 
to convey to people how important 
that is. 
We talk about a million dollars or a 
billion dollars or now a trillion dollars, 
and I am not sure we have an under-
standing, again, what those numbers 
even mean. I think a lot of times peo-
ple think of a trillion dollars, well, it 
sounds like a lot of money. Is that like 
double a billion or what is a trillion? 
I think I found a really good way to 
illustrate it and for us to visualize 
what it means when we are printing 
this kind of money. 
Let me start with this: A million sec-
onds is 11 days. A billion seconds is 31 
years. A trillion seconds is 31,000 years. 
Think about that. 11 days to 31 years to 
31,000 years. The people watching at 
home can’t see this enormous Chamber 
we are in but imagine that I stretched 
a string from this wall to this wall, and 
let’s say that over here is zero, and 
then I ask them to go touch 11 days, 
they would go touch and they would be 
nearly touching the wall. But then if I 
said touch 31 years, if this one over 
here is 31,000 years, they would still 
nearly be touching the wall, and all the 
rest of that distance is a trillion. I 
think that gives us a sense and gives us 
a way to visualize when we talk about 
spending trillions of dollars, it is mag-
nitudes more than billions. It is an un-
imaginable number, like Mr. CURTIS 
said, the percentage of that that has 
been created in the last few months. 
Since COVID hit, we spent about $2 
trillion on the COVID 1 relief package; 
we spent about the same, $1.9 trillion, 
on the second COVID relief package. 
This President suggested a budget that 
takes us from about $4.8 trillion a year 
to $6.3 trillion. We just spent $1.2 tril-
lion on infrastructure. This govern-
ment has spent, taken together, more 
than $11 trillion in a matter of months. 
That should scare the life out of every 
American. 
People say, Well, you are kicking the 
can of debt down the road to our kids 
or grandkids. That is nonsense. We will 
never get to our grandkids if we spend 
trillions of dollars in a matter of 
months. We will never get to our kids 
if we spend $11 trillion in 18 months. 
This problem will correct itself. It 
will correct itself in a painful way and 
in not a matter of generations, a mat-
ter of years, if we don’t try to fix it 
now. 
If you think inflation is because of 
bottlenecks and supply chains, that 
was part of it. But the vast majority of 
this is explained by one thing: The Fed-
eral Government spending trillions of 
dollars. And the American people pay 
the very unfortunate, the very painful 
price. 
Once again, I thank Mr. OWENS for 
the honor to be with him tonight. 
Mr. OWENS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
f 
BUILD BACK BETTER 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to use this time to speak for 
a half hour on a variety of issues, pri-
marily the Build Back Better bill. 
But first, I would like to address 
today National Apprenticeship Week. 
Apprenticeships are a very good way to 
begin your working career. Rather 
than working your way into debt as 
you go to school, you are making 
money while you go to school, and 
there is no better preparation for a job 
than doing the job itself. 
Be it in construction, be it in manu-
facturing, be it in healthcare, there is 
a strong need in America for skills, and 
apprenticeship is a way to get those 
skills and ensure that you hit the 
ground running and get a good-paying 
job immediately. 
I strongly encourage all Americans, 
particularly young Americans, who are 
looking for a job to look at apprentice-
ship and encourage administrators of 
secondary schools to present appren-
ticeships as options for young people. 
Now I would like to address the Build 
Back Better bill. A lot has been writ-
ten and talked about the Build Back 
Better bill from this very microphone, 
and a lot has been focused on the addi-
tional taxes that will be needed to pay 
for it and the overall level of spending 
resulting in more inflation. 
All that is true, but I think the most 
dangerous thing about the bill is what 
the money is being spent for. I am 
going to address five areas in general 
tonight for the American public to re-
member. 
Right now, I think the biggest prob-
lem in America deals with illegal im-
migration. 
The 
numbers 
are 
well 
known. In July, a year ago, 8,000 people 
came into this country. This July it 
was 105,000 people. This October we hit

November 16, 2021 
the all-time high number of people 
processed for any October at the south-
ern border. 
The drug gangs are making lots of 
money down there. Some people tell 
me the drug gangs are making more 
money bringing people in the country 
than they did selling drugs. Seven 
years ago, when I first got this job, 
45,000 Americans a year were dying of 
illegal drug overdoses. We are now at 
93,000, more than double. 
When I first got here, we talked 
about the number of people dying of il-
legal drug overdoses approaching the 
number of soldiers who died in Viet-
nam. Now we are approaching twice 
the number of soldiers who died in 
Vietnam. 
We talk about the humanitarian 
mess down there. In July, 15,000 minors 
were left alone and coming into the 
country. Last year we hit another all- 
time record, 557 deaths of people trying 
to get in the country, be it from dehy-
drating in the desert, drowning in the 
Rio Grande, or falling off the wall. 
What are we doing with this crisis in 
this bill? What vision do they have for 
America? First of all, they are going to 
take about 7 million people who have 
snuck into the country illegally in the 
past and give them amnesty. In addi-
tion to the unfairness of having some 
people skip ahead of other people, that 
is an invitation to bring still more peo-
ple into the country. 
Secondly, they are going to make it 
more difficult to kick people out of the 
country. More parole for people with 
sex offenses, people with firearm of-
fenses, and this parole is mandatory. It 
is not something that can be revoked 
at the discretion of DHS. 
In this bill, as a further inducement 
to come here, we are going to give 
away free Pell grants, which is to say 
free college scholarships to people com-
ing here illegally. Hard as it is to be-
lieve, while Americans are spending $20 
thousand, $30 thousand, $40 thousand, 
$50,000 in debt for a college diploma, in 
the Build Back Better bill, we are 
going to give away free college to peo-
ple who are here illegally. 
Furthermore, in this bill, a bill 
spending trillions of dollars, about the 
only thing they are not spending more 
money on is the Border Patrol. We all 
know that as more children come here, 
the Border Patrol has to spend more 
time on paperwork caring for children, 
so they need more people at the border. 
But as the border is left open, the one 
thing the Democrat Party sadly feels is 
not a priority is more Border Patrol 
agents. 
So again, to repeat, in the Build 
Back Better bill, 7 million more people 
given amnesty, requiring more parole 
for people who have committed serious 
crimes so that they are not kicked out 
of the country, and free Pell grants, 
which 
fits 
nicely 
with 
the 
free 
healthcare we give away as well. 
I 
want 
to 
mention 
that 
free 
healthcare. The average American is 
sitting there worrying about their de-
ductible, should we go to the doctor, 
should we not? What does the majority 
party want to do? Well, we have got to 
give illegals free healthcare. It is the 
only fair thing to do. 
b 1830 
The second big problem I think in 
this country is what I will call a grow-
ing number of Americans adapting to 
the welfare lifestyle. 
Beginning in the 1960s, Lyndon John-
son—in my opinion, the worst Presi-
dent in this country until this time— 
started a massive welfare state, the re-
sult of which was causing people to 
work less and to make sure they didn’t 
get married because it was hard to 
take advantage of the welfare system if 
you were married. In other words, the 
goal was to discourage marriage, dis-
courage work. 
Since that time, the number of peo-
ple with particularly a father in the 
family 
has 
decreased 
considerably 
since the early sixties in response to 
the Great Society, which discouraged— 
gave financial inducements not to have 
a male in the family. 
How does the Build Back Better bill 
deal with the American crisis of the 
breakdown of the family? Wherever 
you look, they are putting more money 
into these programs, the programs that 
in the past were created for people who 
didn’t make much money and were cre-
ated for people who weren’t married to 
somebody making money: food share; 
low-income 
housing; 
Medicaid; 
daycare; earned income tax credit that 
you had to earn something to get, but 
if you began to make over $15,000 or 
$20,000, they took that away from you; 
TANF funds, cash to people also adopt-
ing that lifestyle. 
So how does the majority party re-
spond to the crisis of a welfare system 
that discourages work and discourages 
marriage? We have a larger earned in-
come tax credit, which goes up, again, 
if you are not married to somebody 
making a decent income. We are build-
ing a lot more low-income housing. 
Low-income housing sounds all very 
good, but I talked to a woman who ad-
ministers low-income housing. I asked 
her where people are coming from when 
they get off the waiting list for low-in-
come housing. Well, a lot of them were 
living with their parents. Okay. So we 
are going to take a parent and the 
child and give them their own apart-
ment, as opposed to having them live 
with grandparents. Is that a good 
thing, to move out of mom’s house? I 
don’t think so. 
We are increasing, or the Biden ad-
ministration itself, before we get to the 
bill, increased the amount of food 
stamps you are getting. We are adding 
more money in Pell grants, which is, 
again, a situation if you are a middle- 
class family and you are working, you 
aren’t eligible for Pell grants. But if 
you are adopting a certain lifestyle, 
you are eligible for free college. 
So it seems wherever you look, this 
program is encouraging that lifestyle, 
which I think is unfortunate for Amer-
ica. 
There are wonderful people who are 
parents in all sorts of situations, but 
undeniably in this country we are right 
now penalizing what I will call the old- 
fashioned family. And I will point out 
that it is something, as we started this 
session 
and 
Black 
Lives 
Matter 
weighed in strongly in the last election 
to who would win, Black Lives Matter 
itself, their founders, quoted Karl 
Marx, the fact that they did not believe 
in the traditional family. 
When I look here, it seems that that 
is a motivating factor behind putting 
this bill together, and we are going to 
penalize the traditional family. 
The third ideal that flows through 
the Build Back Better Act is to iden-
tify 
people 
by 
racial 
background. 
Whether you are talking about money 
for small businesses, money for teacher 
preparation, money for community res-
toration, faculty of colleges of medi-
cine, equity in the Department of Agri-
culture, or behavioral health, wherever 
you look, it is not like the programs 
are for all Americans. The programs 
are designed for certain Americans. 
I was reading some statements by 
Yuri Bezmenov, who was a Russian de-
fector in the 1960s. At the time, he 
talked about how the Marxists planned 
to take over America. He said the ma-
jority of money spent in the United 
States was not spent on subversive or 
covert activities. It was spent openly 
to try to demoralize Americans to 
think that America was not a great 
country. A quote from him is that ‘‘ra-
cial and ethnic interrelations is one of 
the most vulnerable areas for demor-
alization’’ of Americans. 
Now, one would think his observation 
as someone who had been around the 
world is that there is no better place to 
live than America. But right now, it 
seems as though the majority party is 
doing the work that the Soviets want-
ed to accomplish in the twenties. They 
want to tell everybody that we ought 
to have racial animus, that we ought 
to pit one group against another group. 
When you look around the world, one 
of the reasons nations fail, nations 
based on elections, is that those elec-
tions become contests between ethnic 
groups. 
I never felt Canada was quite as suc-
cessful as America because, to a de-
gree, their elections pitted the French 
speakers against the English speakers. 
You look at elections in the Middle 
East, and it is the Sunnis against the 
Shiites. You look at elections in Afri-
ca, and it is one tribe against another 
tribe. 
In other words, when they go to the 
polls, they don’t say what is the appro-
priate money to spend on national de-
fense or what is our roads policy or 
what should be appropriate criminal 
justice policy or the length of jail sen-
tences. No, in these countries that fail, 
the elections are a contest of one eth-
nic group against another. 
Not surprisingly, therefore, the peo-
ple who want America to fail would set

November 16, 2021 
up programs designed to benefit one 
group against the other. 
We have seen this earlier this session 
when we had a program forgiving agri-
culture debts only for so-called people 
of color. We also saw it earlier this ses-
sion when we had a program that ran 
out of money for restauranteurs, and 
the people at the bottom of the list 
were people who happened to be White. 
A guy came up to me in my district 
who would have gotten, he claims, tens 
of thousands of dollars if he were of a 
different ethnic background. He won-
dered why he was left behind. Well, it 
is because we have a party here that 
likes to set one group against another 
group. 
That is the third way or the third vi-
sion that the majority party has for 
America. They want to pit one group 
against the other. They want people to 
always view themselves rather than as 
an American. They want to view them-
selves as a Hispanic American or an 
Asian American or an African Amer-
ican. 
The fourth way they want to change 
America in this bill, which also has not 
been talked about enough, is they want 
to provide universal preschool for 3- 
and 4-year-olds. Not only that, they 
want to make sure that the preschools 
not be run by religious entities—kind 
of letting the cat out of the bag. They 
want to make sure that, insofar as the 
3- and 4-year-olds were taught any-
thing, it not be any religious values. 
Again, in America, the raising of the 
children is supposed to be something 
done by the parents. The family is sup-
posed to be preeminent in raising the 
children. Even in my lifetime, the kin-
dergartners have gone from, at least in 
Wisconsin, half-day 5-year-old kinder-
garten to all-day 5-year-old kinder-
garten to half-day 4-year-old kinder-
garten. 
We now are, in one fell swoop, having 
the Federal Government, which under 
the Constitution should have nothing 
to do with this whatsoever anyway, 
going all the way down to the govern-
ment raising the 3- and 4-year-olds. 
It is a fundamental change in how 
much influence the parents have on 
their children and should be resisted, 
not resisted for the cost, although the 
cost is a good reason to resist it, but 
resisted because it is contrary to the 
profamily values that our ancestors 
felt we would have. 
The fifth thing that I would like to 
talk about in this bill is it is apparent 
the authors want a lot more govern-
ment surveillance of what people are 
doing. 
President Biden on his own recently 
proposed monitoring every $600 trans-
fer. Eventually, he had to back off 
under public criticism. He is now at 
$10,000. But you know if he could get 
back down to 600 bucks, he would do it 
in a heartbeat. 
Why would the government care if I 
cashed a $600 check? I can imagine in 
today’s world why they would care. 
Maybe they want to monitor me. 
Maybe they want to see what type of 
church I am contributing money to. 
Maybe they want to see if I am pur-
chasing a firearm. Maybe they want to 
see if I am giving money to a magazine 
or giving money to a political party, 
maybe a magazine espousing politi-
cally incorrect beliefs. Maybe they 
want to look at whether I give any 
money to a political party that may be 
out of favor in a few years. 
I think it is appalling that anybody 
would think that it is up to the govern-
ment to see exactly where I am spend-
ing my money. We all know it is going 
for only bad purposes. 
But in this bill, there is another item 
that hasn’t been talked about enough, 
and that is the majority party wants to 
hire another 85,000 IRS agents—85,000. I 
think that is bigger than the average 
NFL stadium. It is about one of the big 
college stadiums. I went to the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin. It is about the size of 
filling up Camp Randall, 85,000 agents. 
Of course, what is the purpose of 
those agents? To go around and mon-
itor people’s tax returns, to poke 
around, look for receipts, make adjust-
ments, make guesses to what your in-
come actually should be. It is clearly a 
different sort of country if you have 
85,000. I wouldn’t bring this up if it was 
1,000 new agents, but 85,000 new IRS 
agents. 
It sounds like proportionately we are 
headed, again, toward more of a sur-
veillance state, toward less of a free 
state. It is the vision, sadly, of the ma-
jority party. 
I want to review them one more 
time. I hope the American public, when 
they look at this bill, does pay atten-
tion to the bottom line. There is going 
to be more inflation, higher costs on 
the heat bill, no question about it. But 
regardless of the amount of money, 
this is a document put together by peo-
ple who want to encourage illegal im-
migration all the way down to giving 
free college to people who come here. It 
is a party that wants to increase wel-
fare benefits, benefits that are condi-
tioned upon not working too much and 
certainly not marrying a person with a 
respectable income. It is a party that 
wants to further entrench in the Amer-
ican psyche the idea that we have to 
have different programs based on sex, 
different programs based on race, and 
people ought to ask what you are going 
give me because I am from this group 
or what you are going to give me be-
cause I am a woman, rather than treat-
ing all Americans the same. 
It is a bill that is put out with an 
ideal of the government raising the 
children instead of the parents, more 
responsibility for raising the children 
instead of the parents—again, some-
thing that I think would have stunned 
our forefathers. 
Finally, it is a bill put together by 
people who want to hire a lot of new 
government 
employees 
to 
monitor 
what is going on. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to vote against the bill, and I strongly 
encourage the American public to fa-
miliarize themselves with not only the 
size of the cost of the bill but the de-
gree to which we are fundamentally 
changing the way Americans live. 
Now, I am going to speak one more 
time on an issue which I will try to 
highlight later this week or next week. 
We have a big COVID problem in this 
country, and obviously, a lot of money 
is being spent on vaccines and a lot of 
money is going to educating people. 
It is my opinion that not enough at-
tention has been paid to what we can 
do to cure COVID if you get COVID, be 
it vaccinated or unvaccinated. 
Months, maybe even a year ago now, 
some Israeli researchers discovered 
that fenofibrate, a generic drug that 
has been used to treat high cholesterol, 
has tremendous potential success in 
curing COVID. 
More recently, they found 15 people 
who not only had had COVID but had 
pneumonia and were on oxygen. I 
would say if somebody had COVID with 
pneumonia and was on oxygen, they 
were in bad shape. They gave them this 
generic drug, which was freely used for 
over 40 years in this country for high 
cholesterol, and 14 of the 15 patients 
were out of the hospital in 4 days. The 
other guy was out in 2 weeks. In other 
words, it sounds like a cure. 
I have been trying to get the CDC to 
push—they put a little money into it— 
but push more money into this pro-
gram for research to see whether or not 
we would have a cure. I have been told 
by the researchers to this day that the 
CDC would try a little bit harder, and 
there is a researcher at the University 
of Pennsylvania looking into this. But 
if you really want to say it is success-
ful, you want to find at least 700 sub-
jects or patients. It is hard to find that 
many people without help from the 
CDC, particularly if you don’t have the 
big money of the drug companies be-
hind you. 
Right now, our researcher at the Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania has about 350 
people. He likes to believe that, by the 
end of March, he will be able to make 
a definitive statement that fenofibrate 
would be able to cure COVID for under 
50 cents a day.

Wouldn’t that be wonderful. And not 
only does it cure COVID, but if you get 
COVID it will be much less serious. 
And right now, long-term COVID, even 
if you are cured, can result in long- 
term health problems otherwise. 
I strongly encourage my colleagues 
to encourage the Center for Disease 
Control to look at COVID, see what 
they can do about coming up with an-
other 300 or 400 people for a definitive 
study and then rush—if the study 
winds up as well as we think it will— 
rush out and educate these doctors to 
prescribe it because it is entirely pos-
sible it will greatly reduce the number 
of people with long-term COVID and 
the number of people dying. 
Again, if anybody at the CDC is lis-
tening, I hope you take advantage of

this tip. And otherwise, me and my col-
leagues will sign a letter including a 
little more action from the CDC, be-
cause if we found a cure for COVID we 
wouldn’t have to worry about all the 
other controversial issues that are so 
damaging to our country and taking 
away our freedoms. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-

Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 16, 2021 
No. 199 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was

tempore (Mr. LEAHY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Lord God Almighty, maker of Heaven 
and Earth, thank You for not leaving 
us solely to our own resources. Lord, 
You have provided us with the witness 
of nature and the testimony of sacred 
Scripture to navigate us toward cer-
tainty. You protect us from dangers, 
seen and unseen, empowering us to run 
without weariness and to walk without 
fainting. 
Today, strengthen our lawmakers for 
their work. Guide them to the road 
that fulfills Your plans. Bless them 
with productivity and progress for 
Your glory as You help them to learn 
how to better serve You by serving oth-
ers. 
We pray in Your merciful Name. 
Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the

Steele, of California, to be an Assistant 
Secretary of the Treasury. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
TRIBUTE TO PATRICK LEAHY 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first, I 
know you will be taking the floor in a 
few minutes. I spoke about the bitter-
sweet mood we all have of your depar-
ture—bitter in the sense that you have 
done so much for the Senate, for 
Vermont, and for America over the 
years that we will badly miss you; 
sweet because you will get to spend 
more time with Marcelle, your chil-
dren, your lovely grandchildren. And 
you deserve it, after all these great 
years of service. 
It is one of the most extraordinary 
records any Senator has compiled in 
the history of this country. So thank 
you for your service and your contin-
ued service through January of 2022. 
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT AND JOBS ACT 
Mr. President, now on infrastructure, 
yesterday, our country took a major 
step forward to prepare our economy 
for the challenges of the 21st century. 
As we all know, the American people 
have been told for years—for years— 
that another infrastructure bill was 
coming, one infrastructure week after 
another. But, after yesterday, we can 
now tell the American people that an 
infrastructure law is here. The Presi-
dent signed it yesterday. 
The enactment of bipartisan infra-
structure legislation is so long over-
due. There isn’t a community in Amer-
ica that doesn’t have some glaring 
need. 
Crumbling 
roads; 
dilapidated 
schools; untrustworthy bridges; over-
burdened airports, seaports, and rail-
ways—the new infrastructure law will 
tackle these challenges head-on. 
I thank the President and my col-
leagues from both sides of the aisle— 
both sides of the aisle—for making yes-
terday possible. 
The President’s infrastructure bill 
can be summarized with a four-letter 
word: J-o-b-s. Jobs, jobs, jobs—more 
local jobs, more good-paying jobs, more 
union jobs. Unions, as we know, have 
been a ladder up through the decades, 
and they will continue to be under this 
bill, as there will be more of them. 
And the jobs will put people to work 
on projects in every State and every 
community. In New York, my State, 
dependent 
on 
good 
transportation, 
major undertakings like Gateway, the 
Cross Bronx Expressway, the Second 
Avenue Subway, I–81 in Syracuse, and 
the north inner loop in Rochester. The 
list could go on and on and on. All of 
them will finally get going again. We 
have a great chance of that happening 
after years of paralysis. 
And the Federal dollars that the gov-
ernment is sending to the States is al-
ready having an effect in my State. 
Yesterday, our Governor announced 
that, because of the Federal dollars, 
there won’t be fare increases or cut-
backs in services on the MTA and the 
commuter rail. That is really good 
news. 
Well, what is happening in New York 
holds true in every other State in the 
Nation. Major projects that have been 
long awaited have a real good possi-
bility of getting going. So there is 
great news, and jobs, jobs, jobs will 
rain down on every State. 
So there is much to celebrate with 
yesterday’s signing, and in the weeks 
and months and years to come, the 
American people will see the benefits 
with their own eyes. So I want to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8216 
November 16, 2021 
thank President Biden for finally deliv-
ering on something that previous ad-
ministrations have tried to do but have 
been unable to complete. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. President, make no mistake, we 
will keep going in the weeks ahead by 
passing the rest of President Biden’s 
Build Back Better agenda. 
It is very simple. If we want to create 
more jobs, if we want to fight inflation, 
if we want to help families lower costs, 
the best thing we can do is pass Build 
Back Better. 
Let me repeat that. Want to fight in-
flation? Support Build Back Better. 
For all of 2021, we have seen a his-
toric and unprecedented economic re-
covery compared to where we were at 
the depths of the COVID crisis. But 
there is no denying that, as our recov-
ery continues, we must work to address 
supply chain troubles that have exacer-
bated inflation in recent months. 
Build Back Better is exactly what 
the doctor ordered. No fewer than 17 
Nobel Prize-winning economists and 
economists across the political spec-
trum have said repeatedly that Build 
Back Better and infrastructure to-
gether 
will 
reduce—reduce—infla-
tionary pressures. 
In just, I think it was, this morning’s 
Washington Post, Larry Summers, one 
of the inflation hawks in this country, 
recommended passing Build Back Bet-
ter as a way to reduce inflation. 
The childcare investments alone will 
save parents thousands of dollars a 
year. Right now, families pay an aver-
age of $10,000 annually on childcare for 
each kid under 4. Many pay more than 
that. That is a backbreaking expense 
that too many families—the majority— 
simply cannot afford. 
Build Back Better will provide the 
largest investment in childcare ever. 
Extending the childcare tax credit will 
help parents save on things like diapers 
and groceries and gasoline. 
And, of course, Build Back Better 
will finally empower Medicare to di-
rectly negotiate drug prices in Part B 
and Part D, lowering costs for millions 
of seniors and American families. On 
insulin alone, our plan would make it 
so that Americans with diabetes won’t 
pay more than $35 a month for insulin. 
Mr. President, none of the things I 
am talking about are luxuries; none 
are handouts. They are daily essentials 
that families need to thrive and which, 
over the years, have grown expensive. 
And America is behind this. In every 
poll you see, they are for of all these 
things. 
Why will not a single Republican 
vote for it? Why will not a single Re-
publican vote to reduce insulin costs to 
$35, not a single Republican vote to 
help Americans with childcare, not a 
single Republican vote for the best way 
to reduce inflation, even though they 
talk about it a lot? 
It is profoundly disappointing to see 
our Republican colleagues more fo-
cused on exploiting problems faced by 
the American people. Just recently, my 
colleague, the junior Senator from 
Florida, told Americans precisely how 
he feels about the rising costs, infla-
tion costs, faced by families. His quote: 
‘‘[It] is a gold mine for us.’’ It is a gold 
mine; that is what the Republican jun-
ior Senator from Florida said. 
How cynical, how low, how wildly out 
of touch is that? 
The same Republicans who spent 
years under Donald Trump cutting 
taxes for the wealthy are now opposing 
relief for the middle class and cheering 
for costs to go up. I hope the American 
people remember that. Democrats are 
fighting to pass legislation to lower 
costs. Republicans, on the other hand, 
think inflation is ‘‘a gold mine’’ for 
them and are rooting for prices to go 
up. These are the same partisan, short-
sighted games that have frustrated 
American families, who have increas-
ingly wondered who in government is 
looking out for them. 
Well, yesterday, Americans got to see 
one shining example of what can hap-
pen when elected officials do look out 
for them. Build Back Better is another 
opportunity to do the same, and we 
will not let up until we pass Build Back 
Better and keep our promise to recap-
ture that sunny American optimism 
that has long been the key to our suc-
cess. 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. President, finally, on NDAA, last 
night, I took the first procedural step 
for the Senate to begin consideration 
of our annual national defense bill. 
Republicans have repeatedly said this 
legislation is urgent and needs to be 
taken up immediately. We have heard 
them say that. They have signed let-
ters about it. With their cooperation, 
the Senate can start voting as early as 
today. We are ready to do that, and I 
hope Republicans can join in moving 
this legislation forward quickly. 
This year, it is my hope and inten-
tion to add to the NDAA the bipartisan 
legislation the Senate passed earlier 
this year to boost American manufac-
turing, scientific research and innova-
tion, and U.S. competitiveness. 
The U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act, USICA—formerly known as the 
Endless Frontier Act, which I cham-
pioned with Senator YOUNG and with 
great help from so many; among them, 
Senator CANTWELL—would be one of 
the largest Federal investments in 
science, 
technology, 
and 
manufac-
turing in decades. It is an urgent and 
necessary step that will put more 
Americans to work in every corner of 
the country. It will fight inflation and 
relieve overburdened supply chains. 
Talking about supply chains, pass 
USICA. Nothing will do more over the 
next few years to reduce supply chain 
problems than this bill, and especially 
in the semiconductor industry. 
The chip shortage is not some ab-
stract issue; it is impacting the daily 
lives of Americans. Cars, refrigerators, 
and other household appliances require 
chips. Supply shortages mean Ameri-
cans are left waiting a long time for 
these essentials. We have legislation 
ready to go to fix this major chip cri-
sis. Addressing this crisis cannot wait. 
A generation ago, we used to produce 
about a third of the world’s chip sup-
ply. Now fewer than 12 percent are 
made in America while other countries 
have lapped us, particularly China. 
This hurts American workers, Amer-
ican consumers, American national se-
curity. 
We should pass USICA this year—and 
it is a bipartisan bill—so we can 
strengthen domestic chip production 
and drive new investment in the indus-
try to help address this shortage. If we 
can pass the defense bill with USICA 
language included, I am hopeful that 
we will be able to work with the Speak-
er and our House colleagues to find a 
way to get this legislation enacted be-
fore the end of the year. 
Once again, before I yield the floor, 
my kudos, accolades, fondness, and 
love 
to 
the 
great 
Senator 
from 
Vermont, who will now speak. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
WARNOCK). The Senator from Vermont. 
FAREWELL TO THE SENATE 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank 
the distinguished majority leader for 
his comments. He and I have been 
friends for decades. I also acknowledge 
the distinguished Secretary of the Sen-
ate, who is here this morning. 
Mr. President, eight times the voters 
of Vermont—who are my neighbors, my 
friends, my family—have had the great 
faith to send me to the U.S. Senate to 
represent them. Yesterday, I told those 
neighbors and friends and my family 
that I would not run for reelection. 
I told the Vermonters who have hum-
bled me since my first election to the 
Senate in 1974 that I will leave this 
seat at the conclusion of my term. It is 
a decision I do not come to lightly but 
one in which Marcelle and I find great 
peace. 
In the last nearly 47 years, the Sen-
ate has become a family to both 
Marcelle 
and 
me. 
Here 
we 
found 
friends, some of the best of friends, and 
relationships that will and have lasted 
a lifetime. But the Senate has always 
been where I have come to fight for 
Vermont, a State that has been my 
home since birth, the place where I met 
Marcelle, where we started our family, 
and to which in early 2023, we will re-
turn for good. It is time to go home. 
Here is the thing about the Senate. 
Here 
is 
where 
small 
States 
like 
Vermont have not just a seat at the 
table but a voice at the table. For dec-
ades, I have been privileged to fight for 
Vermont, from the small grown-in- 
Vermont ideas like the revitalization 
of our historic downtowns to farm to 
school programs, to organic farming— 
all of which started small and have be-
come increasingly popular across the 
country—and to Vermont’s trailblazing 
approach to criminal justice reforms 
and 
victim 
advocacy, 
to 
taking 
Vermonters’ outward view that our 
great Green Mountain State is open 
and welcome to anyone, including

November 16, 2021 
those fleeing desperate situations in 
far-off places. On all of these issues and 
so many more, it has been an honor to 
represent the great State—the greatest 
State—of Vermont in the U.S. Senate. 
I am going to have more to say about 
the challenges, the rewards, and, I am 
afraid, some disappointments over the 
last 46 years at a later time. Now I 
want to celebrate the accomplishments 
that, together with my constituents, 
we have achieved for Vermont over the 
last decades. 
I want to recognize the work still to 
do this year in Congress. 
I want to thank the unbelievably 
wonderful women and men on my staff 
and my staff throughout the years. 
They have steadfastly stood by me in 
our 
shared 
goals 
to 
deliver 
for 
Vermonters and for Vermont and for 
the country. 
I want to thank my family—my chil-
dren, grandchildren, my parents, and 
Marcelle’s parents who were here with 
me to start this journey in the first 
Senate election who I know watch over 
the entire Leahy family today. I think 
of how my immigrant grandparents 
and great-grandparents and Marcelle’s 
immigrant parents, how they must feel 
if they are looking down. 
And, of course, Marcelle, my closest 
friend, my partner. The last couple of 
years have been challenging in ways we 
could never have imagined. But she 
was with me from the first moment of 
the first campaign, and we made our 
decision together and decided it is time 
to go back home. 
Now, we both look forward to the 
hard work the coming year will bring 
with the same conviction that brought 
us to Washington in the first place; 
that the brighter horizons of tomorrow 
hold the hope of the future and the 
privilege I feel to serve in this body 
and trying to guide our wonderful 
country toward the future. 
As I said, I will speak more about 
this later, but, Mr. President, I thank 
my colleagues. 
I yield the floor. 
(Applause, Senators rising.) 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, 2 
weeks ago, President Biden and his 
team flew to Glasgow for a glitzy con-
ference. World leaders traveled there to 
attend one another’s speeches on car-
bon emissions and climate. 
The world’s largest emitter was not 
there. China pumps out more than one- 
quarter of the entire world’s emissions, 
but President Xi didn’t bother to at-
tend this conference. Putin didn’t show 
up either. He and his cronies in Moscow 
are too busy using Russia’s natural gas 
to stranglehold the energy and make 
energy hostages out of our European 
friends who rushed too naively toward 
renewables. 
This goes to the core problems with 
the anti-energy agenda that liberal 
elites want to thrust on our country— 
maximum self-inflected pain for Amer-
ican families in exchange for no mean-
ingful global gains. 
They would have America tie one 
hand behind our back while our com-
petitors and adversaries keep right on 
going. This hurts families and helps 
China. 
Across the country, working families 
are already worrying about the big, po-
tentially historic spikes in energy 
costs and heating bills that are headed 
their way. Here is the New York Times 
headline from last week: ‘‘Winter Heat-
ing Bills Loom as the Next Inflation 
Threat.’’ 
Futures contracts for home heating 
fuels have skyrocketed in price. Nat-
ural gas users have just about doubled 
from last year. For heating oil and pro-
pane, it is actually even worse. Our col-
leagues on the Energy and Natural Re-
sources Committee are holding a hear-
ing this morning on rising heating 
costs. 
In Kentucky, where about 4 in 10 
households are heated by natural gas, 
families are about to get slammed. 
Even more Kentucky families rely on 
straight electricity for their heat, and, 
in our State, more than two-thirds of 
our electrical power comes from coal. 
Coal literally keeps the lights on, and 
it keeps the cold out. 
That is why the original Obama- 
Biden War on Coal hits States like 
Kentucky so very hard and why the 
even more radical sequel the Demo-
crats are planning next would fall on 
the heartland like a ton of bricks. 
The President’s special envoy for cli-
mate issues John Kerry says: 
[Y]ou have to phase down coal before you 
can end coal. 
One of the President’s nominees to 
the Treasury Department has admitted 
that small producers of affordable 
American energy ‘‘are going to prob-
ably go bankrupt in short order.’’ 
American families are staring down 
the barrel of skyrocketing heating 
bills, and the Democrats’ response is to 
go to war against affordable American 
energy. The reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree they are writing behind 
closed doors and want to pass in a mat-
ter of weeks would spend hundreds of 
billions of dollars on Green New Deal- 
type policies that would saddle fami-
lies with even higher prices and make 
our Nation even more dependent on 
Russia and the Mideast. 
Of course, energy inflation is just one 
part of the huge inflation crisis that 
Democrats have unleashed. According 
to reports in one new survey, 90 per-
cent of Americans are either somewhat 
concerned or very concerned about in-
flation and rising costs. Nine out of ten 
households are hurting. Sixty-seven 
percent of the country, two-thirds, say 
Washington needs to stop printing and 
spending so much and driving prices 
even higher. 
Energy bills and gas prices are just 
one corner of this inflation crisis, but 
Democrats seem to want to ignore the 
people, plow ahead, and spend trillions 
more. 
Even liberal economists who like the 
Democrats’ reckless taxing-and-spend-
ing spree because they agree with the 
far-left transformation admit it would 
make inflation even worse next year. 
There is no part of our economy that 
can afford another massive dose of so-
cialism, but Democrats are specifically 
targeting American energy to get hit 
especially hard. They are planning di-
rect new taxes, new fees, and new regu-
latory mandates for energy producers. 
They want to make affordable, reliable 
energy artificially expensive to force 
Americans toward the less affordable, 
less reliable forms of energy that elite 
liberals would rather they use. It would 
hurt families badly; it would help 
China in a big way. That is because the 
Biden administration doesn’t have any 
strategic plan to snap its fingers and 
turn our massive country into some 
green utopia overnight. They just want 
to throw boatloads of government 
money at things like solar panels and 
electric vehicles and hope it all works 
out. But China absolutely dominates 
the supply chains for lithium batteries, 
for solar panels, and for practically all 
the fashionable purchases into which 
Democrats want to dump all this 
money. In all likelihood, Democrats’ 
supposedly green agenda would just 
provide a massive one-way gift to our 
adversary, the world’s No. 1 emitter, 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
This isn’t Build Back Better; it is 
Build Back Beijing. Here is just one ex-
ample: There is a raw material called 
polysilicon that is crucial for solar 
panels. According to the New York 
Times, more than 80 percent of the en-
tire world’s supply comes from China. 
About half of the world’s supply comes 
from the Xinjiang Province, where 
China is brutalizing the Uighur minor-
ity with tactics that include forced 
labor. 
There are other key resources, in-
cluding critical minerals, where China 
has similar strangleholds. Here are 
some recent headlines: 
‘‘Lithium Shortage May Stall Elec-
tric Car Revolution and Embed China’s 
Lead.’’ 
‘‘China’s lithium companies are in an 
investment frenzy.’’ 
Just like liberal policies are hostile 
to the American energy we produce 
here at home, they are also hostile to 
exploring for these critical minerals 
here at home. Their massive proposal 
is backed with anti-hard rock mining 
provisions that would make it even 
harder to stand up American supply 
chains for critical minerals.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8218 
November 16, 2021 
So here is the bottom line: American 
families don’t want Washington politi-
cians waging a holy war on fossil fuels 
in the first place. They can’t afford 
that nonsense. But it is even more ab-
surd 
that 
Democrats’ 
top-down 
schemes would just increase China’s 
wealth and dominance all along the 
way. They don’t have some smart mas-
ter plan to invest in America’s future. 
They have a plan to build back Beijing 
and raise American families’ gas prices 
and heating bills even higher so that 
we could massively stimulate Chinese 
export markets. Hurt families; help 
China—every piece of their reckless 
policies fits this mold. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, we are 
coming up on a year of Democratic 
governance here in Washington, and 
what do Democrats have to show for it? 
Nothing good. 
On the international front, the Presi-
dent’s most significant act was his dis-
astrous withdrawal from Afghanistan, 
which lowered our standing with our 
allies and continues to jeopardize our 
national security. 
On the domestic front, Democrats 
have largely ignored a massive crisis 
along our southern border that con-
tinues to rage because they can’t take 
on the open borders left in their own 
political party. 
Look at what is happening with the 
supply chain. There are 90 containers 
sitting at the port at Long Beach wait-
ing to get into the country, and the 
President and his team can’t really do 
anything about it because they are un-
willing to take on the Teamsters. 
If you look at our cities, homicides 
are up in all of our major cities across 
this country. It seems that perhaps a 
‘‘defund the police’’ approach to com-
munities’ safety isn’t something that 
sends the right signal to people who 
want to break our laws. 
Then there is inflation. You might 
call it the Democrats’ signature domes-
tic achievement. 
So how did we get here? How did they 
get us here? Well, despite their lack of 
a mandate and their extremely narrow 
majorities 
in 
Congress, 
Democrats 
came into office last January deter-
mined to expand government and im-
plement a far-left, Big Government, so-
cialist agenda. In their minds, the 
coronavirus crisis provided the perfect 
opportunity to advance their plans. 
So despite the fact that Congress had 
just passed—just passed—a nearly $1 
trillion 
bipartisan 
coronavirus 
re-
sponse bill in December—the fifth, I 
might add, the fifth bipartisan bill 
Congress 
had 
passed 
in 
just 
10 
months—Democrats declared that we 
immediately needed another piece of 
ostensibly coronavirus relief legisla-
tion—and not just another piece of leg-
islation, a massive piece of legislation. 
Despite the fact that the December 
bill had met essentially all of the 
pressing coronavirus needs the country 
was facing, Democrats decided that we 
needed to spend another $1.9 trillion. 
Democrats were warned that the size of 
their so-called American Rescue Plan, 
which was substantially in excess of 
anything the economy required, ran 
the risk of spurring inflation. 
Obama economic adviser Larry Sum-
mers warned in the Washington Post: 
There is a chance that macroeconomic 
stimulus on a scale closer to World War II 
levels than normal recession levels will set 
off inflationary pressures of a kind we have 
not seen in a generation, with consequences 
for the value of the dollar and financial sta-
bility. 
That, again, was Obama economic ad-
viser Larry Summers. 
Well, Democrats passed their bill 
anyway. They flooded the economy 
with a lot of unnecessary government 
money, and the results have been pre-
dictable. Inflation. Significant infla-
tion. Inflation, to borrow a phrase from 
Larry Summers, ‘‘of a kind we have 
not seen in a generation.’’ 
Last week, we found out that infla-
tion rose 6.2 percent last year in a 
year-over-year analysis, the largest in-
crease in more than 30 years—30 years. 
Families are facing higher prices at 
the grocery store. And when I say 
‘‘higher,’’ I mean a lot higher. The 
price of meat, poultry, fish, and eggs 
was up 11.9 percent year over year in 
October—11.9 percent. Families are 
also facing higher prices at the gas 
pump, for housing, for electricity, for 
furniture and vehicles and pets and pet 
products, and the list goes on. 
While wages are rising, they are 
being outstripped by inflation, which 
means that many families are dealing 
with a de facto pay cut. Think about 
it—6.2 percent increase in inflation. 
That is essentially a 6.2-percent pay 
cut for American families. 
A big reason families are struggling 
with the higher cost of pretty much ev-
erything is Democrats’ decision to 
flood the economy with unnecessary 
government money by passing the so- 
called American Rescue Plan. You 
don’t have to take my word for it; I 
quoted Larry Summers earlier. 
Here is what former Obama economic 
adviser Jason Furman had to say re-
cently when discussing our current in-
flation problem: 
The original sin was an oversized American 
Rescue Plan. It contributed to both higher 
output but also higher prices. 
Now, you might think that the infla-
tion that has resulted from the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan would be giving 
Democrats pause right now. You might 
think that they would be putting a 
hold, you know, tapping the brakes a 
little bit on any more big spending 
until inflation calms down somewhat 
from its 30-plus-year high. But you 
would be wrong. Democrats are actu-
ally planning to double down on the 
strategy that helped cause so much in-
flation in the first place and pass an-
other giant spending bill. 
That is right. 
Democrats are trying to finalize a 
new 
$1.75 
trillion 
tax-and-spending 
spree, the so-called Build Back Better 
plan—on top of their $1.9 trillion spend-
ing spree from earlier this year. 
I say $1.75 trillion, but Democrats 
only arrived at that number through a 
combination of shell games and budget 
gimmicks. An honest accounting of the 
cost of this proposal over 10 years 
would reveal a much higher pricetag— 
some analyses and assessments suggest 
as high as $4 trillion or more. 
And if Democrats succeed in passing 
this latest partisan spending spree, 
Americans should brace themselves be-
cause this new flood of government 
money will undoubtedly make an al-
ready serious inflation situation much 
worse. 
It is no exaggeration to say that 
Democrats’ main focus this year has 
been growing the size of the Federal 
Government and expanding its reach 
into Americans’ lives. No sooner had 
they passed their massive $1.9 trillion 
spending bill in March, then the Demo-
crats moved on to their next massive 
spending proposals which have been 
coalesced into the so-called Build Back 
Better bill the House is planning to 
take up later this week. 
Other government business has been 
forced to take a backseat. Democrats 
have ignored, as I said earlier, the mas-
sive—massive—crisis at our southern 
border. They have ignored our inflation 
crisis. And they have pushed consider-
ation of essential legislation in favor of 
working 
on 
their 
tax-and-spending 
plan. 
This week, the Senate will finally— 
and I say finally—consider the fiscal 
year 2022 National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act, a month and a half after the 
2022 fiscal year has started. Ship-
building projects, military infrastruc-
ture projects, development of new com-
bat systems, a pay increase for our 
troops, they have all had to wait—all 
had to wait—while Democrats nego-
tiated over their Big Government so-
cialist spending spree. 
And about that socialist spending 
spree, despite the fact that Democrats 
have pushed aside most other matters 
in favor of focusing on their spending 
plan, they still haven’t managed to 
come up with a bill that can pass the 
House and the Senate. 
And the tax proposals they plan to 
use to—and I say partially—partially 
pay for the bill seem to change on a 
daily basis. And I say partially be-
cause, again, a great independent anal-
ysis from places like Penn Wharton 
suggest that the revenue that they 
would raise to pay for all the spending 
in the bill would fall somewhere be-
tween $2 and $2.5 trillion short of the

cost of the bill. That is $2 to $2.5 tril-
lion that would be added to the already 
$30 trillion national debt. 
Let’s just say, for example, that 
these ideas they have to partially pay 
for this bill seem to change on a daily 
basis. A corporate tax hike? No, let’s 
change it to a corporate minimum tax. 
A new death tax? No, let’s change it to 
a new tax on wealth—something we 
have never talked about before in this 
country, taxing unrealized gains. That 
is taxing income before people have ac-
tually seen the income—the realized 
income. 
Funding for their bill seems to be a 
matter of throwing spaghetti at the 
wall on a daily basis to try and see 
what sticks. There isn’t a day that 
went by in the last couple of weeks, 
when we were in session the week be-
fore last, where there wasn’t another 
horrible idea that came from that side 
of how to raise revenue to finance this 
massive, reckless, and radical spending 
bill. And of course all of Democrats’ 
current funding proposals put together 
will not be able to pay for their legisla-
tion, especially when you remove, as I 
said earlier, the budget gimmicks that 
are disguising the true cost of their 
plans. 
As their narrow majorities made 
clear, the 2020 election did not give 
Democrats a mandate for Big Govern-
ment socialism. And if that wasn’t 
clear to Democrats in 2020, it should 
certainly be clear to them now after 
the election for the Virginia Governor 
this month, which saw Republicans win 
statewide for the first time since 2009. 
Voters in Virginia sent a clear message 
to Democrats that they weren’t look-
ing for far-left government or a far-left 
social agenda that would seek to cir-
cumvent parents’ role in their chil-
dren’s lives and education. But just as 
inflation concerns have not stopped 
Democrats, it has become clear that 
their rebuke in Virginia won’t stop 
them either. In fact, some Democrats 
seem to think that their response 
should be to run faster and further to 
the left. 
So the big agenda item for Demo-
crats for the rest of the year continues 
to be passing their partisan Build Back 
Better tax-and-spending spree, which 
means Americans will be able to look 
forward to further inflation and a 
weaker economy, not to mention in-
creased government control of their de-
cision making. 
It is a poor legacy for Democrats’ 
first year in office, but it seems to be 
the legacy Democrats are determined 
to secure. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PADILLA). The Senator from Virginia is 
recognized. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I am glad 
to follow my colleague from the Dako-
tas because I would certainly never at-
tempt to interpret the electorate of an-
other State. 
I can tell you about the Virginia 
elections that happened a couple weeks 
back. The message, I think, from our 
voters pretty loud and clear was: We 
want you to get stuff done. If we in the 
Senate and in the House had passed the 
infrastructure bill and passed the Build 
Back Better bill before the Virginia 
election, I think the outcome would 
have been different. 
What we were hearing again and 
again from voters is: We gave you a 
majority. Please act on it, especially at 
this time when Americans are so chal-
lenged by now nearly 20 months of pan-
demic and economic devastation. 
So I stand on the floor as a proud 
Virginian, very focused on celebrating 
the accomplishment of yesterday— 
President Biden’s signature on the in-
frastructure bill—but also saying we 
have to pass the Build Back Better bill 
in order to respond to what our con-
stituents are asking of us at this chal-
lenging time. 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Mr. President, I want to speak today, 
sort of, maybe not so much as a Sen-
ator but as a former city councilman 
and mayor. 
I am sort of unique. There are 30 peo-
ple in the United States who have been 
a mayor, Governor, and U.S. Senator— 
1 of only 30 in our entire history. The 
first time I was introduced and some-
one said that, I thought, that clearly 
cannot be right. So many Governors 
become Senators, that clearly cannot 
be right. I asked the Historian to re-
search the matter because someone in-
troduced me that way. And it came 
back that that is correct. Only 30 peo-
ple in the history of this country have 
been a mayor, a Governor, and a Sen-
ator. And as I pondered the reason for 
that, it suddenly occurred to me: Being 
a mayor will kill you. 
Governors can become Senators, but 
mayors often make everyone mad, and 
it is hard to go from being a mayor to 
having a post-mayoral political career 
because the job is so tough. 
And yet, when people ask me: Which 
job do you like better, Governor or 
Senator, I always say: Look, I like 
them all. But if you made me give up 
every title I ever had except one, the 
one I would hold on to is mayor. I 
would hold on to being a mayor be-
cause when you are a mayor, it is 24/7, 
365. There is no recess for a mayor. 
City councils and mayors don’t go into 
recess. You are dealing with people on 
the issues that are the closest to them. 
You can make people happier or mad-
der. 
You can convince people in local gov-
ernment, in a nation of 330 million, 
sometimes they think: What does my 
vote matter? What does my voice mat-
ter? No one will listen to me. In local 
government, you can convince people 
that actually they will be listened to. 
So I would hold on to that mayoral 
role, and, frankly, if I had not been 
mayor, I never would have been a Lieu-
tenant Governor or Governor or a U.S. 
Senator. So I owe anything that I am 
or do in politics now to the fact that I 
started in local government. 
I spoke yesterday to the Virginia As-
sociation of Counties, the gathering of 
all county supervisors of all 95 counties 
around Virginia. They gather once a 
year, usually in person. Last year, it 
was by Zoom. 
They were so glad to be back to-
gether, in person, in Norfolk yesterday, 
hundreds of them in a conference room. 
And they asked me to come and talk 
about what is going on in Congress. 
And I said: How much time do you 
have? But what I really focused on was 
three things, and I want to focus on 
those three things now, speaking about 
them from the perspective of local offi-
cials not just in Virginia but all over 
this country: first, the American Res-
cue Plan, which was passed in March, 
but it is just beginning to have an im-
pact in Virginia’s cities, counties, and 
towns; second, the bipartisan infra-
structure bill that was signed at the 
White House yesterday; and, third, the 
education and workforce bill that we 
are working on now that I believe will 
reach the President’s desk in Decem-
ber. 
I started off by telling these county 
supervisors what I truly believe; that 
anybody in public life right now, elect-
ed or a first responder or any class-
room teacher, when we are all finished 
with our times in public life, I think we 
will look back on this period of time, 
beginning March 2020, as the most im-
portant period of our public service ca-
reers. The pandemic has created such 
destruction, death, economic catas-
trophe, illness, and division that we 
have all been tested in our personal 
lives and our work on behalf of our 
citizens. Our constituents have needed 
us in unparalleled ways since March of 
2020. 
Last year, on a cold Saturday in 
March, we passed the American Rescue 
Plan. It contains significant funding in 
four basic pillars: healthcare, relief to 
individuals and families, aid to busi-
nesses, and then, finally, aid to State 
and local governments, including edu-
cational institutions. 
The American Rescue Plan imme-
diately affected millions of Ameri-
cans—families, 
healthcare, 
institu-
tions, 
businesses—through 
measures 
like 
massive 
vaccine 
deployment, 
checks to individuals, business grants. 
These kept families afloat and helped 
protect themselves against COVID, and 
they also kept the lights on for many 
of our local businesses. 
But what I want to focus on is the aid 
that we gave to State and local govern-
ments and, again, particularly—par-
ticularly—to local governments. Vir-
ginia and its localities, through the 
American Rescue Plan, received $7.2 
billion in the American Rescue Plan; $4 
billion to the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia and $3.2 billion to our cities, 
counties, and towns. 
And as soon as we passed it, I started 
to go around and talk to our cities, 
counties, and towns: How are you going 
to spend these local moneys? What 
they told me was interesting in April

of last year. They said: Well, first, we 
are going to wait and see how the State 
decides to spend their $4 billion be-
cause we don’t want to spend on some-
thing and have the State spend on the 
same thing. So we are going to let the 
State, 
the 
Governor, 
Governor 
Northam, the General Assembly pro-
gram the $4 billion. But while the 
State is doing that, we are going to go 
out and dialogue with our citizens. 
And I really applaud my local gov-
ernments. Recognizing this was one- 
time money that wouldn’t happen 
every year, they had intense public dia-
logue with local constituents about 
what can we do to really transform? 
How can we use this money? And they 
have done it in fascinating ways. 
As I traveled around the State and 
talked to these local governments, I 
see them advancing long-delayed cap-
ital projects, water and wastewater up-
grades, closing the digital divide by in-
vesting 
in 
broadband, 
constructing 
community centers in parts of the 
community that haven’t received in-
vestments in the past. 
Many gave hazard pay to first re-
sponders. The American Rescue Plan 
helped people fund police, ambulance, 
fire, mental health workers, public 
health workers, grants to local non-
profits and churches that supported the 
community during COVID, grants to 
shore up Virginia’s hard-hit businesses 
that were engaged in the tourism in-
dustry as people stopped traveling. 
This is what our local governments 
have done with these dollars. 
The investments are supplemented 
by more than three and a half billion 
additional dollars to Virginia childcare 
providers, K–12 school systems, col-
leges, community colleges, with bil-
lions more for other local priorities 
like transit and broadband infrastruc-
ture. 
So it was heartening to talk to these 
county officials. And there are more 
red counties in Virginia then there are 
blue counties, so I was talking to coun-
ty officials from all over the State, and 
more would have been in Republican 
counties than Democratic counties. 
But they were thrilled that Congress— 
that the Senate by a one-vote margin, 
as we all remember—passed the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan to invest in these key 
local priorities. 
BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE BILL 
Mr. President, on the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill, I told them: I am 
going to leave this floor and race to 
Washington and hope that there aren’t 
any State troopers nearby because I 
need to get to Washington to go to the 
signing at the White House of the in-
frastructure bill. 
This is the Nation’s biggest commit-
ment to infrastructure since the Inter-
state Highway System initiative in the 
Eisenhower administration. It will em-
ploy hundreds of thousands of people 
and raise the platform for economic 
success for decades. 
The Presiding Officer was in local 
government just like I was, and if you 
are in local government, you care 
about infrastructure. When I was a 
mayor, I had a transit system, I had 
roads, I had bike trails, I had an air-
port, I had an Amtrak station, and I 
had a port on the James River, which 
is connected to the Chesapeake Bay. 
There is a lot of oceangoing and freight 
going out of our port. I had all of that. 
If you are in local government, you 
care about infrastructure. That is why 
it was exciting to see so many mayors 
and local officials at the White House 
yesterday when the bill was being 
signed. 
I was proud to cheer on my col-
leagues who worked on that bill, and I 
thank all of them. I am especially 
proud that a provision that I had with 
Senator WICKER, of Mississippi—to en-
able our historically Black colleges 
and universities and other minority- 
serving institutions to be involved in 
training the workforce and creating 
the innovations that we will need to 
make this infrastructure investment— 
was included in the bill. 
I want to give a special thanks to my 
Virginia 
colleague, 
MARK
WARNER, 
who, I think, was sort of an unsung 
hero in the negotiations around the in-
frastructure bill. 
The impact of the bill is going to be 
felt in Virginia for generations: bil-
lions for roads and bridges, ports and 
dredging, airports, rail to trails, rail-
road, climate resiliency, broadband, 
energy grid modernization, waste and 
wastewater infrastructure. The infra-
structure bill contains a significant in-
vestment for Chesapeake Bay clean-
up—that really matters to us—and a 
significant investment in the Appa-
lachian Regional Commission. That 
really matters to southern and western 
Virginia, the parts of our State that 
are in Appalachia. 
Allocating these dollars to States in 
smart 
ways 
will 
allow 
them 
to 
prioritize the use of the funds in our 
cities, counties, and towns in a way 
that will ensure that each State gets to 
tackle the most important priorities, 
because the Virginia solution wouldn’t 
be the California solution or the New 
Hampshire solution. Every State can 
use these funds to fund the projects 
that are the most important there. Vir-
ginia is going to receive a minimum of 
$100 million for affordable broadband, 
at least $7.6 billion for roads and 
bridges, and at least $2.7 billion for 
transit, among other sizable invest-
ments. 
As I explained this to my Virginia 
Association 
of 
Counties 
yesterday 
morning, they were overjoyed because 
they all had—and the Presiding Officer 
remembers this—their local capital im-
provement projects lists, with projects 
that had been bumping along for years, 
and there were never enough dollars to 
really advance them. Now the dollars 
will be there to get the projects done 
and cross them off the lists. 
BUILD BACK BETTER AGENDA 
Mr. President, I want to now talk 
about the third bill. The administra-
tion calls this bill the Build Back Bet-
ter bill, and some call it the reconcili-
ation bill because of the Senate budget 
procedure that we are using to pass it. 
As a member of the Budget and the 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committees, I call it the edu-
cation and workforce bill. It is an edu-
cation and workforce bill. This bill, to 
me, is fundamentally about preparing 
America’s workers for tomorrow and 
making sure that our workforce has 
the training and the childcare and the 
housing 
and 
the 
healthcare 
to 
outcompete any country in the world. 
If we want to make good on the 
promise of the infrastructure bill, who 
is going to build it? We just signed an 
infrastructure bill, but it didn’t have 
the training and the education compo-
nent. Who is going to build this? We 
have to have a workforce to build this 
massive infrastructure improvement, a 
once-in-a-generation 
improvement. 
That is what the Build Back Better bill 
is about. 
We are not going to outcompete 
China just by diplomacy or tariffs or 
tough 
talk. 
We 
aren’t 
going 
to 
outcompete China just by growing our 
military budget. The best way to 
outcompete China is to invest in Amer-
ica’s workers. 
The success of America’s economy in 
the next 50 years will depend on our 
making the same investments that al-
lowed us to thrive in the 20th century— 
investing in infrastructure, investing 
in people—and that is the basis of 
Build Back Better. 
This education and workforce bill 
also provides sizable investments in 
community colleges to train workers 
for infrastructure jobs, to train the 
next generation of K–12 teachers, and 
to train workers to enable America to 
lead the world into a new and innova-
tive energy economy. There will be in-
vestments in rural economic develop-
ment, a Pell grant increase, an exten-
sion of the child tax credit, and addi-
tional healthcare and housing funds to 
reduce costs for American families. 
The bill will close the Medicaid cov-
erage gap, lower healthcare costs and 
the costs of prescription drugs, and will 
fund better public health infrastruc-
ture. 
The thing about this bill that maybe 
excites me the most is this: We will be 
able to provide funding for States to 
make 
prekindergarten 
universally 
available for every 3- and 4-year-old in 
this country, and we will do it through 
a mixed delivery model that supports 
high-quality public and private pro-
viders. This will help an additional 
140,000 3- and 4-year-olds in Virginia 
have pre-K, and we will also fund 
childcare for the kids younger than 3 
years old to bring down costs of 
childcare for working families. When 
you combine both the pre-K and the 
childcare support in Virginia, it will 
mean that 500,000 more kids just in my 
State will have access to quality and 
affordable childcare and early edu-
cation. When kids get a strong start, it

puts them on a brighter path for the 
rest of their lives, and it makes it 
much easier for their parents to go into 
the workforce, knowing that their 
child has high-quality and affordable 
childcare options. 
If we pass this bill, and I am con-
fident we will, it is going to be the 
most pro-family and most pro-child bill 
Congress has ever passed. I believe this 
bill will do for children what Social Se-
curity did for seniors in a status that 
we have long lived in this country, 
where we accept a child poverty rate 
that is dramatically higher than the 
adult poverty rate. What does that say? 
What does that say about a society? 
This workforce and education bill, 
Build Back Better, will end our accept-
ance of that unacceptable status quo 
and move us to a position where we can 
cut child poverty and give our kids a 
much stronger start for a successful 
life. 
The American Rescue Plan, as I men-
tioned a minute ago, passed the Senate 
by just one vote—just one vote. One 
vote had changed all of those benefits 
to my local governments and to fami-
lies and to educational institutions and 
to hospitals and healthcare networks 
and to businesses. All of those would 
have not occurred. None of the coun-
ties whose leadership I spoke to yester-
day would have received the moneys 
that I talked about for the trans-
formative projects. 
I hope we will pass this education 
and workforce bill by a wider margin 
than just one vote, but if it is just one 
vote—if it is just one vote—so be it. So 
be it. 
When there was an effort in this 
Chamber in August of 2017 to take 
health insurance away from 30 million 
people—one of the most dramatic mo-
ments in my entire public service ca-
reer—we saved 30 million people’s 
healthcare by 1 vote—by 1 vote. When 
we acted on the American Rescue Plan 
in the middle of the pandemic, in 
March, to try to help our country 
climb out of the worst public health 
crisis in a century, we got it by one 
vote. I would like a wider margin, but 
if it is just one vote—if it is just one 
vote—we will still be doing really im-
portant work. 
Americans deserve a Congress that 
will fund businesses and schools; that 
will train the workforce; that will 
build 
out 
transportation 
networks; 
that will support hospitals and health 
clinics; deploy vaccines; provide addi-
tional funding for law enforcement of-
ficers and first responders; create bet-
ter broadband connections; provide tax 
relief to working families and lower 
childcare costs. Build Back Better is 
the next step to lifting us out of the 
pandemic and rebuilding the American 
economy. 
I have to say I am 63 years old—I will 
be 64 in February—and this has been 
the hardest 20 months of my life, and I 
think most people in this country 
might say the same thing. Just think 
about the sheer number of the 750,000 
people who have passed and the people 
who have been ill—my wife and I both 
had COVID, and we know a lot of peo-
ple who died of COVID—and beyond, 
those being the folks who didn’t have 
COVID but who had a grandchild born 
whom they couldn’t go visit or a friend 
who died, and they couldn’t go to the 
funeral, or who lost a job or had a busi-
ness that they had sweated to build but 
had to shut its doors. It has been such 
a tough time. 
But, as I looked out at the hundreds 
of county officials who were gathered 
in person yesterday in Norfolk and as I 
talked to them about these bills—and I 
saw them there in person—I detected 
an uplift. I am feeling a sense of uplift. 
I am feeling a sense of uplift as we see 
wages increasing. I am feeling a sense 
of uplift as we make a commitment, 
for the first time in a generation, to be 
builders and invest and grow our infra-
structure. I am feeling a sense of uplift 
as we approach investing in workers 
and in our families the same way we 
are investing in infrastructure. 
I have a feeling that, over the next 
couple of months, these important in-
vestments will braid together in a way 
that will make people feel a sense of 
uplift about the economy and as vac-
cines continue to be distributed and 
now as boosters are being distributed. 
How wonderful it was to hear the 
Presiding Officer talking about his 
children being able to be vaccinated, 
his school-aged children. I think that is 
going to contribute to a sense of uplift, 
too. 
I just want this body to be a gener-
ator of uplift. Sadly, a lot has come out 
of the Capitol in the last few years that 
hasn’t exactly been an uplift for peo-
ple. I believe we are standing on the 
threshold of a chapter where this body, 
the U.S. Senate, will be a great gener-
ator of uplift for the American people, 
and I believe passing the Build Back 
Better is a step that will be really im-
portant in making that happen. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
NATIONAL FAMILY CAREGIVERS MONTH 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want 
to address the Senate on an issue that 
is very close to my heart. 
Now that we are well into the month 
of November and our Nation’s observ-
ance of the National Family Caregivers 
Month, I would like to recognize the 
family caregivers across this Nation 
and the difficult and vitally important 
work that they do. 
I have a brother and a sister. Both of 
our parents passed away in the mid-
dle—well, 2014 and 2015, but they both 
suffered from Alzheimer’s at the same 
time. It was very, very difficult on all 
of us to figure out the best way to ease 
their pain and to satisfy—it was a very 
difficult time—how we, as a family, 
were going to be providing for their 
care. 
This experience motivated me to join 
my colleague Senator MICHAEL BENNET 
of Colorado as a cosponsor of the bipar-
tisan Assisting Caregivers Today—or 
ACT—Caucus. 
The ACT Caucus seeks to bring 
much-needed attention to all of the 
caregivers and the issues that their 
caregivers face from all backgrounds. 
It seeks to find bipartisan ways to less-
en the emotional and financial toll for 
those individuals who are caring for 
family members. And this help is need-
ed by so, so many. 
Eighty-three percent of the help pro-
vided to older adults in the United 
States comes from family members, 
friends, or even unpaid caregivers. 
Nearly half of all caregivers who pro-
vide help to older adults do so—like we 
do—for 
someone 
living 
with 
Alz-
heimer’s or with another type of de-
mentia. 
In my home State of West Virginia, 
we have about 85,000 family caregivers 
who are living with someone who has 
Alzheimer’s and caring for them. As we 
know, those of us who have been down 
this road, there are no easy solutions 
here. Not only is it emotionally taxing 
on a family—there is no simple path— 
it also can be very, very expensive. 
My West Virginia Alzheimer’s advo-
cates always share with me their in-
credible stories—they actually let me 
come to one of their support groups, 
which I needed at the time—and also 
the challenges that they have as care-
givers. One of these challenges is navi-
gating the current complex medical 
system needed to care for someone liv-
ing with Alzheimer’s or, more often 
than not, other chronic medical condi-
tions. 
This is one of the reasons I joined 
with my colleague Senator DEBBIE 
STABENOW of Michigan—we have done a 
couple of things together—in intro-
ducing the Comprehensive Care for Alz-
heimer’s Act. 
This bill would address the challenge 
by asking the Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid for some innovation to be 
able to test dementia care manage-
ment models. It enables individuals to 
more seamlessly and successfully navi-
gate healthcare and social support sys-
tems and to obtain more timely access 
to care. 
The model is designed to reach as 
many Medicare beneficiaries as pos-
sible, especially individuals from rural 
and medically underserved areas. It 
provides comprehensive care services, 
including caregiver education and sup-
port; ensures patients have access to 
providers with dementia care experi-
ence; and also to reimburse providers 
through payment based on perform-
ance. 
This is something that could have 
helped my brother, sister, and I as we 
were navigating this difficult path, by 
helping us to coordinate the care that 
our parents not just received but what 
they deserved. It also could have 
helped them by ensuring that they 
were receiving the best care at all 
times. 
We must recognize the importance 
that our family caregivers play not

only during National Family Care-
givers Month, but every day, and em-
brace those commonsense solutions 
like this one. 
So in honor of my parents, I would 
like to say that many of us across the 
country who are dealing with this have 
so much heartache and so much dif-
ficulty and so much difficult decisions 
that I am always trying to seek the 
best way to try to help those families 
who are going down that path. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in honor 
of the parents—and so many others—of 
Senator CAPITO, I thank her for her 
empathetic, compassionate remarks. 
We all have had friends and family who 
have suffered, and her remarks are 
really appropriate. 
So thank you for that. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the vote take place imme-
diately after my remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR TO S. 3076 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I also 
ask unanimous consent that Senator 
OSSOFF of Georgia be added as a co-
sponsor of S. 3076, a bill to amend the 
Federal Reserve Act. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, not a 
unanimous consent request, but I note 
that joining me on the floor today is 
Ben Ashman, for whom we have given 
consent to be on the floor as a Senate 
fellow in our office for the year. 
NOMINATION OF GRAHAM SCOTT STEELE 
Mr. President, I rise to urge my col-
leagues for the upcoming vote to join 
me in supporting Graham Steele, the 
President’s nominee for Assistant Sec-
retary for Financial Institutions at the 
Department of Treasury. 
Graham is my friend. Graham is a 
former staff member of the Banking, 
Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee 
and was a stellar—was and is a stellar 
public servant. 
I know from personal experience how 
ready Mr. Steele is for this job. Gra-
ham spent 7 years in my personal Sen-
ate office and on the Senate Banking 
and Housing Committee staff when I 
became ranking member. 
He was a senior trusted aide. He 
worked with staff of so many of my 
colleagues from both parties. In a Sen-
ate that is, frankly, too divided and a 
Senate that is too rigid in its partisan-
ship, five Republicans on the Senate 
Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
Committee joined in supporting Gra-
ham Steele when we voted him out of 
committee a month or so ago, and that 
is because of his relationships, because 
of his honesty. 
He has extensive financial services 
experience, a track record of biparti-
sanship, and a history to make our sys-
tem work for everyone. He understands 
the far-reaching effects the financial 
system has on workers and their fami-
lies. 
Throughout his career, Graham has 
forged close relationships with civil 
rights groups; with consumer advo-
cates; and with organizations, like the 
bipartisan Ohio Bankers League that 
wrote in support of his nomination. 
He stood up for families, for commu-
nities, 
for 
Main 
Street 
businesses 
against Wall Street greed and corrup-
tion. He has worked across the aisle to 
get things done for the American peo-
ple. 
As minority chief counsel for the 
Banking and Housing Committee, and 
as my staff director of the Sub-
committee on Financial Institutions 
and Consumer Protection, he crafted 
legislation, he worked with other of-
fices, 
he 
worked 
with 
community 
banks, and he fought to protect all 
Americans’ finances. 
He worked on a broad set of issues 
with two Republican chairs, Senator 
CRAPO of Idaho and Senator SHELBY of 
Alabama. He worked with their staffs, 
worked with people on both sides of the 
aisle. 
He did vital work during and after 
the 2008 financial crisis, as we worked 
to stabilize our financial system. 
In his work for our office, he traveled 
around Ohio in the years that followed. 
He talked to Ohioans who had lost 
their homes and saw their communities 
devastated by Wall Street’s—and I un-
derscore ‘‘Wall Street’s’’—great reces-
sion. Wall Street didn’t experience 
much of the recession; Wall Street 
caused the recession. I make that 
clear. 
He understands the importance of lis-
tening to workers. He understands how 
the financial industry affects their 
lives every day. 
He has put results for Americans 
above partisanship. He worked with 
Senator Johanns, a Republican from 
Nebraska, who has since retired. He 
worked with Senator COLLINS, a Repub-
lican from Maine, on an important fix 
to insurance regulations. He worked 
with Senator MORAN of Kansas on inno-
vative ways to encourage families to 
increase savings. 
In his current role at the Stanford 
Graduate School of Business, Graham 
researches important issues at the 
intersection of markets and business 
and government, looking at ways to 
promote a more accountable economy. 
At Treasury, Graham Steele would 
oversee an office that plays a pivotal 
role in coordinating the Department’s 
efforts on financial institution policy, 
community 
and 
economic 
develop-
ment, insurance, and cybersecurity and 
critical infrastructure protections. 
He would lead an office that oversees 
the Community Development Finan-
cial Institutions Fund, CDFI. 
His qualifications and his experience 
are obvious. Graham and the staff of 
many of my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle can attest to his commitment 
to service and the ability to find com-
mon ground—something that will serve 
him well at Treasury working with 
Secretary Yellen and will serve this 
body and our government well. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the nomination of Graham 
Steele. He will serve admirably, I am 
sure of that. I can think of no better 
person to serve in this role at this very 
consequential time in our Nation’s his-
tory. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Michigan. 
NOMINATION OF ROBERT FARRELL BONNIE 
Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak in support of Rob-
ert Bonnie’s confirmation as Under 
Secretary of Farm Production and Con-
servation at the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. 
If confirmed, Mr. Bonnie will oversee 
three Agencies at the USDA that are 
absolutely critical to the well-being of 
our Nation’s farmers and ranchers and 
to our shared goal of addressing the cli-
mate crisis. 
Taken together, the Farm Service 
Agency, the National Resources Con-
servation Service, and Risk Manage-
ment Agency provide the first line of 
defense for our farmers and ranchers 
against 
droughts 
and 
floods 
and 
wildfires and other extreme weather. 
These Agencies will also lead our ef-
forts to provide voluntary solutions to 
help our farmers and ranchers lead the 
way in addressing the climate crisis. 
In my home State of Michigan and 
across the Nation, producers are facing 
unseasonable freezes and thaws and 
dramatically unpredictable conditions 
that disrupt the planning and har-
vesting schedules they rely on for their 
livelihoods and for our food supply. As 
the climate crisis affects the way the 
agriculture sector operates, the work 
of the USDA and its staff to provide re-
sources and knowledge for our farmers 
and ranchers is absolutely critical. 
Without crop insurance, without dis-
aster assistance, without our conserva-
tion programs, our farmers and ranch-
ers will be left even more vulnerable. 
That is why we need competent, experi-
enced leaders who are ready to lead 
these Agencies from day one. 
Leading this mission area is a big re-
sponsibility but one that I know Mr. 
Bonnie is well-qualified to tackle. 
Throughout his career, Mr. Bonnie has 
built strong partnerships with farmers, 
with ranchers, with foresters, with 
communities. 
This is also his second time leading a 
mission area at USDA as he was con-
firmed by voice vote as Under Sec-
retary for Natural Resources and Envi-
ronment in the Obama administration. 
There, he oversaw key public-private 
partnerships with foresters and private 
land owners, while leading the U.S. 
Forest Service and the Natural Re-
sources Conservation Service. 
While working at the Nicholas Insti-
tute for Environmental Policy Solu-
tions at Duke University, Mr. Bonnie 
worked closely with rural communities 
to tackle pressing conservation issues. 
And at the Environmental Defense 
Fund, Mr. Bonnie focused on incentive- 
based approaches to promote steward-
ship on private lands. 
At his hearing in the Senate Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry Com-
mittee, Democratic and Republican 
members alike praised Mr. Bonnie’s ex-
tensive credentials and his commit-
ment to tackling the climate crisis and 
boosting farm income at the same 
time. 
That approach has earned him the 
support of many, many of the Nation’s 
most respected farm and food organiza-
tions, including the American Farm 
Bureau and the National Farmers 
Union. 
I am pleased to add my support to his 
nomination and urge my colleagues to 
vote yes on this extremely well-quali-
fied nomination. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum un-
less we—are we at a point to move for-
ward on the vote?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8224 
November 16, 2021 
I yield back all time and ask that we 
proceed to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
Ms. STABENOW. I withdraw my mo-
tion. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from California. 
COVID VACCINES 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
am proud to share with all of you the 
experience of California this last year 
in combating the COVID–19 pandemic. I 
am proud to say that California has led 
the way on COVID–19 prevention and 
vaccine because we have seen the dev-
astation that surging cases can cause. 
Last winter—remember where we 
were last winter? A catastrophic surge 
in my home county of Los Angeles 
overwhelmed local hospitals, as was 
the case, frankly, in many parts of the 
country. Families were desperate to 
find care for their loved ones. Ambu-
lances struggled to find hospitals with 
capacity. 
As we approach this winter season, I 
recognize that we made incredible 
progress turning the tide since those 
tragic times. Now, just a month ago, 
California achieved the lowest level of 
COVID–19 transmission of any State in 
the Nation, but today cases are begin-
ning to rise again. We are seeing the ef-
fects of the changing weather. 
We need to stay vigilant to prevent 
another devastating surge like the 
wave that peaked in California and 
across the country last winter. 
Fortunately, today, we are armed 
with a powerful defense: an FDA-ap-
proved vaccine that is safe, that is ef-
fective, and that is free for all. Califor-
nia’s historic vaccination effort—made 
possible by the resources that we 
helped deliver when we passed the 
American Rescue Plan—has covered 
more than three-quarters of our resi-
dents, more than 55 million shots in 
arms of Californians. 
But now is not the time to let up. 
Every person who gets the vaccine 
helps to stop spread of the virus in our 
community. And we just received two 
new critical weapons: One, booster 
shots to increase protections for adults 
and, two, approval of a vaccine for chil-
dren older than 5. 
Colleagues, during last week’s State 
work period, I had the privilege of join-
ing leaders of the Los Angeles Unified 
School District for the opening of their 
first vaccine clinic, a mobile clinic on 
school sites for students ages 5 and up. 
I saw firsthand the anxious excitement 
of families looking forward to a freer, 
safer life for children. Imagine that, 
play dates with friends, holiday cele-
brations with grandparents, and relief 
for those with family members at high-
er risk. 
Now, as parents of younger children, 
Angela and I know that this pandemic 
has especially been hard on children. 
For more than a year, as we would 
gather together to pray as a family, 
our youngest, Diego, whom many of 
you met, would ask God for COVID to 
be over. And he would then ask when a 
vaccine would be ready for him and his 
brothers. 
That is why it was such a big deal 
when the vaccine was approved for 
children ages 5 and older. Angela and I 
were vaccinated earlier this year. Our 
oldest son, Roman, was vaccinated 
months ago. And, finally, last week, 
Diego and Alex received their vaccines. 
So we know that we are sharing this 
moment of joy with millions of fami-
lies across the country who are re-
lieved that our children will be better 
protected against COVID–19. 
Colleagues, as we approach this now 
second Thanksgiving since the start of 
the pandemic, we recognize that we 
have much to be thankful for. We are 
thankful for the scientists who drew on 
years of research to design and test one 
of the most effective vaccines that we 
have ever seen. We are thankful for the 
doctors and nurses who are helping to 
administer the vaccine to as many peo-
ple as possible while caring for the 
sick. And we continue to be thankful 
for all the essential workers who take 
on high-risk jobs to keep food on our 
tables and keep the economy going. 
So it is in the spirit of all this that 
I ask each and every one of you to do 
your part. To everyone at home, 
please, each and every one of you do 
your part. Protect yourself. Protect 
your family. Protect your community. 
Get vaccinated. Get your children vac-
cinated. Go check to see if you are eli-
gible for a booster, and if you are, find 
one near you at vaccines.gov. We have 
come to appreciate how vaccination is 
the key to a safe holiday season, and it 
is key to ending the pandemic for all. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Washington.

Vermont.

end of next year. 
I have come to know PAT during my 
service in the Senate. He is a humani-

passionate defender of America’s na-
tional ideals and, I might add, of inter-
national human rights. Loretta and I 
count PATRICK and his wonderful wife 
Marcelle as really good friends. 
I have been on the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, chairing it for a year. I 
have more insight into that job than I 
ever had before, and I have certainly 
realized that when Senator LEAHY was 
the chair of that committee, he wrote 
an extraordinary record, which many 
of us only dream of emulating. 
I thank him for his passionate, con-
sistent, faithful support of the DREAM 
Act, which I introduced 20 years ago, 
and his efforts to help me get this en-
acted into law. I also appreciated when 
he gave me the opportunity to create a 
new subcommittee in Judiciary enti-
tled the ‘‘Subcommittee on Human 
Rights and the Law,’’ which I chaired. 
We did good things for America and the 
world. 
PAT LEAHY is known throughout the 
world, and I mean that literally, as a 
defender of human rights and human 
dignity. I have seen it so many times. 
He and I decided to join forces a few 
years ago on behalf of a political pris-
oner. Her name is Leila de Lima. She is 
a human rights advocate and a senator 
in the Philippines. She is in jail. 
Two years ago, Senator LEAHY passed 
an amendment on her behalf in the 
State and Foreign Operations Appro-
priations Subcommittee. As a result, 
strongman Rodrigo Duterte of the 
Philippines 
banned 
both 
Senator 
LEAHY and myself from entering the 
Philippines because of our action. I can 
tell you that we take great pride in 
being singled out in that manner. 
Duterte knew, as we all know, that 
when PATRICK LEAHY sees injustice, he 
will use his power in office to put 
things right. 
His service in the Senate has been a 
great benefit to our Nation, our world, 
and his beloved State of Vermont, and 
we will certainly miss him when he re-
tires. I will just add, though, watch 
closely because he is going to run 
through the tape. He has a little over a 
year left in the Senate, and I am sure 
he will work for that entire period of 
time for the betterment of this Nation 
and his beautiful Vermont. 
REMEMBERING MAX CLELAND 
Madam President, over the weekend, 
I reflected on an event in my life that 
occurred 58 years ago. 
On November 24, 1963, I had just 
transferred and was a sophomore at 
Georgetown University. It was a chilly, 
gray Sunday morning, and I had joined 
a huge crowd of thousands of people in 
Lafayette Square, across the street 
from the White House, to stand in 
mournful silence. 
A few minutes after 1 o’clock that 
afternoon, the doors of the White 
House opened, and the flag-draped cas-
ket of President John F. Kennedy was 
carried out. The casket was placed on a 
caisson for a solemn procession to this 
U.S. Capitol. The route was lined with 
hundreds of thousands of mourners 
standing 10, 12 deep. Hardly anyone 
spoke. The only sounds were the clack-
ing of horses’ hooves, the sound of 
metal wheels on the pavement, and the 
muffled sounds and drums of the mili-
tary escort. 
More than 30 years later, I recounted 
that student experience to a colleague 
in the U.S. Senate. His name was Max 
Cleland from the State of Georgia, and 
he said to me: ‘‘Durbin, I was standing 
in the same corner in Lafayette Square 
that you were standing in.’’ He was 
there for the same reason I was: to wit-
ness history and to pay homage to our 
fallen President. 
There we were, just a few feet away 
from one another in Lafayette Square, 
but our lives took a much different 
course immediately after that. 
I went to law school, married, and 
started a family, and my wife and I 
were blessed with three kids. 
Max Cleland enlisted in the U.S. 
Army in 1965 after graduating from col-
lege. Military service was a long tradi-
tion in his family. He spent 2 years in 
what he called a ‘‘cushy’’ job as an 
Army aide, and he hated it. He fought 
to be sent to Vietnam. 
In April 1968, with less than a month 
left in his tour of duty, Army CPT Max 
Cleland found himself at the Battle of 
Khe Sanh, one of the longest and dead-
liest battles in the Vietnam war. 
On April 8, 1968, he jumped off of a 
helicopter and saw a hand grenade on 
the ground. He thought it had fallen off 
his flak jacket. As he reached to pick it 
up, the grenade exploded, tearing off 
his right arm and both of his legs. He 
was 25 years old. 
When he was recovering at Walter 
Reed, a friend took his doctor aside and 
asked him in confidence: What sort of 
life awaits this triple amputee? What 
would he be able to do? 
The doctor said that if Max ever re-
covered enough just to put on his own 
shirt, that simple task would exhaust 
him for the rest of the day. Well, that 
doctor didn’t understand his patient. 
He didn’t know Max Cleland. He saw 
what that grenade blast had taken 
away from him, but he didn’t see the 
deep reservoirs of faith, strength, and 
determination that remained in Max 
and grew stronger over time. 
Before his injury, Max Cleland was 
the golden boy of his hometown of 
Lithonia, GA. He was his parents’ only 
child. He stood 6 feet 2 inches, was a 
basketball and tennis player in high 
school, and was voted the ‘‘most excep-
tional student’’ during his senior year. 
He could have done anything with his 
life, but during that internship semes-
ter in Washington in 1963, Max Cleland 
decided he wanted to be a U.S. Senator. 
Nothing could kill that dream—not 
even the terrible explosion at Khe Sanh 
that took three of his limbs and nearly 
took his life. 
After 8 months in VA hospitals and 
rehab centers, he went home to Geor-
gia. In 1970, at the age of 28, he became 
the youngest person ever elected to the 
Georgia State Senate. In 1984, he be-
came the youngest person to head up 
the 
U.S. 
Veterans’ 
Administration, 
now the Department of Veterans Af-
fairs. It was under his watch that the 
VA first admitted the existence of 
something called post-traumatic stress 
disorder. Max knew the hell of post- 
traumatic stress well. He fought for 
treatment and compensation for our 
vets, and he struggled with visible and 
invisible wounds of war. 
In 1982, Max Cleland was elected 
Georgia secretary of state, a position 
he held for 14 years. During that time, 
he gathered some of the biggest vote 
totals in Georgia history. 
When Georgia Senator Sam Nunn de-
cided to retire in 1996, Max knew it was 
his chance. He threw his hat in the ring 
and was elected U.S. Senator of Geor-
gia. 
We came to this Senate together in 
1997. When Max came to the Senate, 
there was no ramp for wheelchair users 
in the Senate. He had to make his first 
speech from the back of the Chamber. 
He tucked a quote from the Book of 
Isaiah inside his breast pocket. It was 
simple: ‘‘Do not be afraid.’’ He joined 
the Armed Services Committee and ex-
panded education benefits for all vet-
erans through the GI bill. 
He was just full of energy and good 
cheer. I remember that warm smile and 
his big belly laughs. His optimism was 
a choice, and it required a grueling reg-
imen to maintain it. He took 3 hours 
every morning to prepare himself phys-
ically and mentally to face each day. I 
remember reading an article in the 
Washington Post about a regimen of 
strenuous physical exercise, which he 
designed for himself. He had taken a 
spare bedroom in his apartment and 
did his own workout routine—this tri-
ple amputee—each morning. 
For years, Max felt a sort of shame 
about his injuries. He felt the wounds 
were his own fault. He always thought 
that he had dropped the hand grenade 
that nearly killed him. It took 30 years 
for the truth to come out. 
Max was telling this story on na-
tional TV when a man called in after-
wards and said: I need to talk to Sen-
ator Cleland. He said to him: ‘‘Max, 
that’s not how it happened at all. I 
know. I was there.’’ He said another 
soldier had dropped the grenade, a 
‘‘newbie’’ who hadn’t taken the pre-
cautions that veteran soldiers know to 
take to prevent an accidental detona-
tion. 
The story turned out to be true, and 
after 30 years, Max could begin to for-
give himself. 
Max was serving in the Senate on 9/ 
11. Months later, the Senate was debat-
ing how to merge several Agencies, of-
fices, 
and 
Departments 
into 
the 
brandnew Department of Homeland Se-
curity. It was the biggest reorganiza-
tion of the Federal Government since 
World War II, and it would create one 
of the largest Federal Agencies. 
Some saw it as an opportunity to 
take on the unions. Max and I and 
many others thought otherwise. We

voted against an amendment that 
would have denied employees of the 
new Department the same collective 
bargaining rights as other Federal 
workers. 
It was months later that Max stood 
for reelection. Near the end of that 
race, there was an infamous ad that 
showed images of Osama bin Laden and 
Saddam Hussein and questioned Max’s 
commitment to protect America. 
How do you look at a man who has 
lost three limbs in war and struggled 
every day of his life to serve others and 
accuse him of not being willing to de-
fend this country? 
Max Cleland was one of six Vietnam 
veterans in the Senate at that time. 
All of his brothers in arms, including 
Republican Senators John McCain and 
Chuck Hagel, were furious about that 
ad. They raised enough hell to have 
that ad pulled. Sadly, the damage was 
done. Max lost his race for reelection. 
He called that loss ‘‘the second hand 
grenade’’ in his life. 
In his 2009 memoir aimed at his fel-
low wounded veterans, he wrote: ‘‘My 
body, my soul, my spirit, and my belief 
in life itself was stolen from me by the 
disaster of the Vietnam War. I found 
solace in attempting to ‘turn my pain 
into somebody else’s gain’ by immers-
ing myself in politics and public serv-
ice.’’ 
When his Senate years were over, he 
said: ‘‘I went down physically, men-
tally, emotionally, down into the deep-
est, darkest hole in my life. I had sev-
eral moments when I just didn’t want 
to continue to live.’’ 
The post-traumatic stress came roar-
ing back into his life, and so 40 years 
after he first arrived there, Max re-
turned to Walter Reed to try to mend 
not his body but his broken heart. It 
was connecting with other warriors 
that pulled him out of his despair. 
I want to thank my Senate col-
leagues 
and 
especially 
my 
friend, 
former Majority Leader Harry Reid, for 
their commitment during that dark 
time. They helped him return to public 
service. 
He was appointed to the 9/11 Commis-
sion and served for a short while before 
resigning to serve on the board of the 
U.S. Export-Import Bank. In 2009, 
President Obama chose Max to serve as 
Secretary 
of 
the 
American 
Battle 
Monuments Commission. 
Last week, Max Cleland died at his 
home in Atlanta. His big heart finally 
succumbed. He was 79 years old. 
On the same day he died, another 
veteran fighting the invisible wounds 
of war shot and killed himself at the 
Lincoln Memorial in Washington. Air 
Force TSgt Kenneth Omar Santiago 
was only 31. 
In a note posted on social media be-
fore he died, he wrote: ‘‘No one knows 
who is struggling and waging wars that 
the eye cannot see. What does chronic 
depression even look like?’’ 
Max Cleland knew the answer to that 
question. If he had met Sergeant 
Santiago—or any of the 17 veterans 
who die by suicide every single day in 
America—he would have told them 
what he said to himself every day: 
‘‘Hold on. Seek help. Do not be afraid.’’ 
Max Cleland was a soldier, a patriot, 
and a friend. We can pay no better trib-
ute to him than to honor his service 
and sacrifice and help those who con-
tinue to live with those visible and in-
visible wounds of war. 
Farewell, Max. I will miss you. 
FEDERAL BUREAU OF PRISONS REPORT 
Madam President, on a completely 
different topic, earlier today, the in-
spector general at the Department of 
Justice released a stunning report. It 
found that the Federal Bureau of Pris-
ons had failed to negotiate with the 
prison guard union for more than 20 
months. 
Think of that. The management of 
the Federal Bureau of Prisons failed to 
negotiate with the prison guard union 
for more than 20 months. This has led 
to a delay of more than 30 critical Bu-
reau policies to help protect their staff 
and inmates. 
That report was published just days 
after an investigation by the Associ-
ated Press, which concluded that the 
Bureau is ‘‘a hotbed of abuse, graft and 
corruption, and has turned a blind eye 
to employees accused of misconduct.’’ 
Both investigations confirm what we 
have known for a long time: the cur-
rent Director of the Bureau of Prisons, 
Michael Carvajal, should no longer lead 
the Bureau of Prisons. 
This morning, I publicly called on 
Attorney General Merrick Garland to 
replace Mr. Carvajal with a reform- 
minded Director who is not a product 
of that Bureau’s bureaucracy. 
Since 
Director 
Carvajal 
was 
ap-
pointed by former Attorney General 
Bill Barr in February 2020, we have wit-
nessed a series of cascading failures 
that have endangered the lives of BOP 
inmates, as well as the correctional of-
ficers who work there. 
Director Carvajal has failed to re-
solve chronic staffing shortages at the 
Bureau. He has failed to contain out-
breaks of COVID–19 within our prisons. 
The COVID–19 infection rate in the Bu-
reau of Prisons is six times what it is 
in the rest of the population. 
He has failed to fully implement the 
reforms that the Members of this Sen-
ate enacted, including an overwhelm-
ingly bipartisan First Step Act, signed 
into law by President Trump. 
To take one example, under the First 
Step Act, low-risk inmates are eligible 
to receive earned time credits to re-
duce their sentences. They do this by 
completing programs designed to pre-
vent them from committing another 
crime when they are released. The in-
spector general concluded that the Bu-
reau of Prisons has not allowed any— 
any—time credits to be awarded be-
cause they have not finalized the pol-
icy nearly 3 years after the First Step 
Act was signed into law. 
That act was a bipartisan measure. 
Senator GRASSLEY and I were the lead 
sponsors on it. And it was a measure, 
as I mentioned, signed by President 
Trump. For 3 years, the Bureau of Pris-
ons has done little or nothing to imple-
ment it. 
Director Carvajal has also failed to 
prevent serious misconduct by his own 
employees. Some of these numbers are 
incredible. Since 2019, more than 100 
Federal prison workers have been ar-
rested, charged or convicted of crimes, 
including sexual abuse, murder, and in-
troducing contraband into prison. 
Altogether, these crimes account for 
two-thirds—let me say it again: two- 
thirds—of criminal cases against De-
partment of Justice personnel, even 
though BOP employees comprise less 
than one-third of the DOJ’s workforce. 
There is no excuse for any further 
delay in dismissing Director Carvajal. 
It is time for Attorney General Gar-
land to appoint new leadership to the 
Bureau that will address the crises he 
has created or allowed to exist and to 
take critical steps to reform our Fed-
eral prison system. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MEATPACKING INDUSTRY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
as the meatpacking industry became 
increasingly concentrated in the 1990s, 
fewer animals were sold through nego-
tiated purchases—or, you could say, 
you could call that cash purchases or 
you could call it the spot market. 
In the 1990s, we saw increased use of 
alternative marketing arrangements 
that were not publicly disclosed under 
voluntary reporting. Livestock pro-
ducers knew that these arrangements 
were not allowing them to get a fair 
market price for their livestock going 
to slaughter so they called for live-
stock mandatory reporting, also known 
as LMR. This new law would apply to 
packers who purchase livestock, proc-
ess them, and market the meat. 
When the livestock mandatory re-
porting legislation was first considered 
in 1998, it unfortunately didn’t get very 
far. I want to read for you an article 
from March of 1999 because it is going 
to have some relationship to a similar 
issue that we hope to get before Con-
gress before the end of the year, and 
that is a bipartisan piece of legislation 
I am referring to. 
I want to read an article from March 
1999, from the Southern Livestock Re-
view. That article is entitled ‘‘How 
Campaign Money, Republican Lobby-
ists Killed Mandatory Price Report-
ing.’’ I am going to read that article 
into the RECORD in its entirety, only I 
will not read names. I will refer to 
former Senators as Senator 1, 2, and 3, 
and I will refer to lobbyists’ names as 
Lobbyist 1 and Lobbyist 2.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8227 
November 16, 2021 
My point is to remind my fellow Sen-
ators today not to be blindsided again 
by the American Meat Institute, like 
happened in 1998 to kill legislation 
back then, because I don’t want a simi-
lar thing to happen with what some of 
us Senators are proposing this year. 
This is important because Senator 
FISCHER and I are soon to introduce 
legislation to update livestock price 
transparency. 
Now, I will read. This is a long read-
ing. 
How Campaign Money, Republican Lobby-
ists Killed Mandatory Price Reporting: 
In the heat of last October’s upcoming 
election and Congress’ hurry-get-out-of-town 
legislating, the draft of a massive $4 billion 
farm bailout bill—which included federal re-
lief for cash-strapped farmers and mandatory 
public price reporting in livestock markets— 
was in place as congressmen and senators 
flew home for a weekend of campaigning. 
When the lawmakers returned the fol-
lowing Monday, however, mandatory live-
stock price reporting was virtually gutted, 
butchered by well-connected Republican lob-
byists and huge sums of political action cam-
paign money from the meatpacker-backed 
American Meat Institute. 
How this deboning occurred is an object 
lesson in how private money often thwarts 
public will and why solid, sensible farm pol-
icy often dies at the hands of craven politi-
cians and legions of lobbyists. 
In July 1998, Senate Minority Leader Tom 
Daschle, D-SD, put mandatory price report-
ing in livestock markets into what was then 
a modest $500 million farm drought relief 
bill. Daschle, responding to years of com-
plaints 
from 
his 
state 
ranchers 
over 
meatpacker concentration, didn’t ask for the 
moon. All he wanted was a one-year experi-
mental program that required meatpackers 
to publicly disclose the prices they paid 
when buying livestock from producers. 
But as the ag economy continued to 
skid in late summer, the bill’s cost es-
calated and so did the warning over 
what the bill would include. Daschle’s 
price 
reporting 
request 
also 
came 
under 
attack 
from 
the 
AMI, 
the 
meatpacker 
lobby 
in 
Washington. 
Packers viewed the idea as costly—es-
timated by USDA at $60 million per— 
and unnecessary. 
Yet as momentum picked up for an 
even bigger farm relief bill, mandatory 
price reporting opponents like AMI 
sensed 
Daschle’s 
efforts 
would 
be 
adopted as the ‘‘save-the-farm’’ rhet-
oric built after Labor Day. 
To shoot down Daschle’s plan, AMI hastily 
bought some bazookas. In early September, 
AMI hired [Lobbyist No. 1] . . . a member of 
one of Washington’s most powerful Repub-
lican lobbying firms. 
For an extra pop, reported the October 25, 
1998 Washington Post, AMI also hired two 
other Republican leaders-turned-lobbyists, 
[Lobbyist No. 2] and [Lobbyist No. 3]. . . . 
Now plugged into the Republican power 
grid, AMI turned on the juice. During the 
1998 election cycle, AMI doled out $198,473 in 
political action committee money raised 
from 
executives 
of 
member 
firms 
like 
Cargill’s Excel, ConAgra’s Monfort, Kraft’s 
Oscar Myer, Premium Standard Farms, 
Farmland Industries, and Smithfield Foods. 
Most of the money went to Republican can-
didates. 
In fact, according to the Center for Re-
sponsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign 
watchdog group, $165,973 or 84% of AMI’s 
1997–98 PAC cash landed in Republican cam-
paign coffers. House Republican candidates 
got $114,973 of the meatpacker lard; Senate 
Republicans got $51,000. 
But as the crucial October legislative dead-
line approached, mandatory price reporting 
was still alive in the farm bailout bill’s final 
draft. Then AMI lobbyists and money began 
to get traction. 
The lobbyists, in particular [Lobbyist No. 
1], a longtime pal of fellow Mississippians— 
and Republican Senators—[Senator No. 1] 
and [Senator No. 2] got the price reporting 
legislation pulled from that ag bill. Senate 
Democrats and a few of their farm state Re-
publican colleagues were furious. 
Daschle struck back. With [Senator No. 
2’s] blessing, he folded mandatory price re-
porting into the even bigger $520 billion om-
nibus 1999 Budget Bill that was still hanging 
fire. Two days later, it too was gutted by Re-
publicans into a meaningless ‘‘confidential 
one-year government investigation, during 
which livestock prices would not be dis-
closed’’ by the packers, according to the 
Washington Post. 
Sources say [Lobbyist No. 1] buddy [Sen-
ator No. 1] wielded the knife. As chairman of 
the 
Senate 
Ag 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee, [Senator No. 1] refused to fund 
any new price reporting effort as part of the 
bailout bill, thus killing it there. Later, at 
the behest of [Lobbyist No. 1], [Lobbyist No. 
2], and [Lobbyist No. 3], [Senator No. 1] 
neutered mandatory price reporting in the 
Budget Bill by keeping any information 
gained through it ‘‘confidential.’’ 
Now the National Pork Producers Council, 
a past opponent of mandatory price report-
ing, the American Farm Bureau, the Na-
tional Cattlemen’s Beef Association, and 
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman are 
calling for publicly disclosed, mandatory 
price reporting legislation from Congress. 
An AMI spokesman said the group will 
fight the new effort, but didn’t know if [Lob-
byists 1, 2, or 3] would carry water for the 
packers in 1999. Yet, he adds, referring to 
[Lobbyist No. 1], ‘‘He served our purposes 
well last year.’’ 
No kidding. But the meatpackers paid as-
sassins—[Lobbyist No. 1] and his Republican 
pals—stuck a knife in the back of every live-
stock producer in America last fall. And it’s 
still there. 
Now, that is the end of my reading of 
the March 1999 article by Alan Guebert 
in the Southern Livestock Review. 
So you see, many of the same hurdles 
that we went through in ‘98 are the 
hurdles that we are facing now with 
making needed cattle market reforms. 
The same high-powered and well-con-
nected lobbyists who work for the Big 
Four meat processors are still the same 
high-powered and well-connected lob-
byists who are lobbying against the 
market reforms of today. Those re-
forms are being proposed by a bipar-
tisan group of Senators and will soon 
be introduced. 
But I have got news for you. The spe-
cial interests of the meat packers don’t 
have a vote in the U.S. Senate. 
Last 
week, 
Senators 
FISCHER, 
TESTER, WYDEN, and I announced a 
framework to increase price discovery 
and transparency in the cattle market. 
You will never guess who, once again, 
is fighting this commonsense legisla-
tion—the very same group that I re-
ferred to as AMI, the American Meat 
Institute, now called the North Amer-
ican Meat Institute; that same group 
that, in the 1990s—or—yeah, the 1990s— 
was against the livestock mandatory 
reporting legislation has come out 
against the independent cattle pro-
ducers again today. 
See, these powerful corporations are 
against any reform that would give 
independent producers more leverage 
in negotiating a fair price for their cat-
tle. 
In 1998, South Dakotan Tom Daschle 
led the charge against these big meat 
packers. And while the livestock man-
datory reporting was stalled in 1998, in 
1999, Senator Daschle was able to get 
that across the finish line. And it is 
still law, but it isn’t a perfect piece of 
legislation, and our proposals ought to 
improve it dramatically. 
Now we have Senators, farmers, con-
sumers from all over the country who 
want to see reforms. Livestock farmers 
are losing money, consumers are pay-
ing record high prices for beef, and 
meat packers are making record prof-
its. 
Now, I am sharing this story today to 
show that even changes that we now 
view as common sense were once op-
posed by the meat industry. We still 
have time this year to make real mar-
ket reforms that will help independent 
producers stay in the cattle business. 
I urge my colleagues to support a 
piece of legislation that we have enti-
tled Cattle Price Discovery and Trans-
parency Act and support independent 
cattle producers. 
I hope you will join Senator FISCHER, 
this Senator, Senator TESTER, and Sen-
ator WYDEN and several other Senators 
in the last 24 hours that have joined 
this effort. 
These reforms are long overdue, and 
we can’t let these special interest 
groups, like the North American Meat 
Institute, stop this important legisla-
tion like I just described for you how 
they stopped it in 1998. And thank God 
Senator DASCHLE didn’t give up, be-
cause the next year he eventually got 
it done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MUR-
PHY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, this 
morning, the majority leader came to 
the floor of the Senate to talk about 
the Democrats’ reckless tax-and-spend-
ing bill. 
Now, he repeated the claim that the 
bill would actually reduce inflation. It 
won’t. Just like the claim the Presi-
dent makes that the cost of the bill 
will be zero, the American people know 
that that is not true either. 
The majority leader asked a ques-
tion. He asked why not a single Repub-
lican would support the bill. Well, I am

happy to respond to the majority lead-
er and explain why the American peo-
ple and the Republicans are rejecting 
what the Democrats are trying to force 
through the Congress. 
So I come to the floor today to talk 
about rising prices. Next Thursday will 
be the most expensive Thanksgiving 
ever. As the New York Times put it, 
the Thanksgiving dinner will wallop 
your wallet. Turkey prices are up 25 
cents on the dollar so far this year. 
Prices for meat, poultry, fish, and eggs 
are up more than 10 cents on the dollar 
in just 1 year. 
Companies like Nestle and Procter & 
Gamble, well, they put out warnings 
that they are raising their prices. 
Who would have thought that in just 
10 short months of the Biden Presi-
dency we could set a record—a 30-year 
high record for inflation? 
Millions of families this year will sit 
down for Thanksgiving dinner, and in 
addition to eating turkey, families 
around the table will also be talking 
turkey. They are going to have dif-
ficult conversations about how to 
make ends meet. 
According to one estimate, families 
are now paying about $175 more every 
month because of inflation for the 
same things they were getting before 
Joe Biden became President. This 
works out to a $2,000 bite out of the 
paychecks annually of every working 
American. 
So what is happening? Why is it hap-
pening? 
It is for at least three reasons. First, 
Joe Biden’s incompetence and mis-
management has caused the worst sup-
ply chain disruption in at least 40 
years. 
Now, the supply chain crisis is large-
ly the result of a labor shortage. Last 
week, the New York Times called the 
shortage of truck drivers—truck driv-
ers; not of trucks, but of the drivers— 
the single biggest cause of the supply 
chain crisis. 
We don’t have enough goods in large 
part because we don’t have enough 
workers. This is the worst labor short-
age in American history. There are 
more than 10 million jobs which have 
gone unfilled in recent months. We 
have broken new records for unfilled 
jobs in 5 of the last 9 months that Joe 
Biden has been in office. 
This isn’t a coincidence. This is hap-
pening because of the policies that 
have been put in place by the Demo-
crats in this administration. 
In March, President Biden and the 
Democrats extended a bonus payment 
to people who stayed home from work. 
Millions of people made more money 
by staying home instead of going to 
work. Well, in September, the bonus 
payment ran out. 
Then President Biden announced a 
nationwide vaccine mandate on the 
American people. Having been trav-
eling around the State of Wyoming this 
past week, I will tell you it is a man-
date that is taking a sledgehammer to 
the American workforce. 
Now, I fully support vaccination. I 
am a doctor. I am vaccinated, so are all 
the members of my family. I am pro- 
vaccine and anti-mandate. Imposing 
new mandates on workers during an 
unprecedented labor shortage is com-
plete incompetence. 
Now, this mandate is only making 
the supply chain crisis worse. The 
President must have known that many 
would not comply with this mandate. 
He must have known that people would 
be forced out of their jobs by his man-
date. It didn’t seem to faze him; he im-
posed the mandate anyway. Now people 
are losing their jobs, shelves are 
empty, and prices continue to go up. 
The second major reason why prices 
are rising is President Biden’s war on 
American energy. Thanksgiving is tra-
ditionally one of the busiest travel 
times of the year. AAA estimates that 
more than 50 million Americans will 
take to the highway and travel next 
week—pretty standard for a Thanks-
giving weekend. Those who drive will 
pay a lot more for gas than they did 
last year or the year before. It is the 
highest in 7 years. Gas prices are up 
about $1 a gallon in the number of 
months that President Biden has been 
in office. It is more expensive to travel. 
And it is getting more expensive also 
to stay warm. One in five American 
families has already cut spending to 
pay for their energy bill in the last 
year. Winter is coming. It is going to 
get worse. Some will have to choose be-
tween whether they can heat their 
home or whether they can eat a meal. 
Prices are so high, 11 Democratic Sen-
ators are pleading with the President 
to bring down gas prices. 
So what is Joe Biden’s solution? 
Well, he admits he has no solution. 
He says that gas prices are going to 
stay high until the springtime. 
One of the President’s top nominees 
for the Treasury Department says she 
wants to ‘‘starve’’—starve—American 
oil and gas. She actually said that we 
want—in her mind—‘‘we want [oil and 
gas companies] to go bankrupt.’’ She is 
the nominee to be the Comptroller of 
the Currency. 
The Secretary of Commerce was 
asked what the administration was 
doing to lower energy prices. She 
couldn’t name a single thing. 
The Secretary of Energy apparently 
thinks high gas prices are funny. She 
was asked what she could do to in-
crease oil production in America. She 
laughed and said: ‘‘That is hilarious.’’ 
The Secretary of Transportation also 
thinks it’s funny. He is joking around 
that people need to start Christmas 
shopping early this year. 
So there you have the elites of the 
Biden administration—the elites of 
America—the people he has chosen to 
run these Agencies. They think it is 
funny. It is no laughing matter for the 
working families in Wyoming or all 
across America. 
So who gets hurt by high prices? 
The poor, people living on fixed in-
comes, families struggling to get by. 
Working families cannot afford what 
the Democrats are offering. 
Since Joe Biden became President, 
prices have gone up much faster than 
wages. In other words, the American 
people have taken a cut in the spending 
value of their paychecks. They can buy 
less with the same amount of money. 
And even if they have gotten a bit of a 
raise, the prices are taking a greater 
and greater bite out of that paycheck. 
So as we approach Thanksgiving, 
Democrats in Washington want to 
spend like it is already Black Friday. 
Democrats seem to think that every 
day is Black Friday, when you take a 
look at this reckless tax-and-spending 
bill where every page is over $1 billion 
of spending. 
They have already put $2 trillion on 
the credit card earlier this year. This is 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
bipartisan 
coronavirus relief that the Senate 
passed last year. But for Democrats, 
there is never enough spending. Taxing 
and spending: it is an addiction. They 
want to print more money, they want 
to spend more money. 
And right now, Democrats are push-
ing a reckless tax-and-spending bill, 
which will make inflation in this coun-
try even worse. Democrats say that the 
bill that they are proposing in the 
House right now will cost $2 trillion. 
The Congressional Budget Office will 
give a final report the end of the week. 
Experts say, if all of the programs they 
are proposing were to stay in place for 
the full 10 years in the budget system, 
the price is much closer—if not exceed-
ing—$4 trillion. 
So if the Democrats pass this bill, we 
are talking about more spending, more 
debt, and higher prices. We are also, of 
course, talking about more taxes that 
ultimately will hit everyone in this 
country one way or the other. 
Last week, the New York Times re-
ported ‘‘many researchers . . . say the 
bill is structured in a way that could 
add to inflation next year.’’ Not just 
this year; next year as well. 
Experts say this bill could increase 
the cost of childcare up to $13,000 for 
each and every family in America 
whose children need that care. This is 
already one of the biggest expenses on 
working families. They will nearly 
double that. 
And, of course, Democrats’ spending 
spree would add over $400 billion in 
taxes on America’s small businesses— 
the mom-and-pop businesses in the 
communities all around this country. 
Interestingly, at a time of high en-
ergy costs—we had a hearing about 
this this morning in the Energy Com-
mittee, the trend in prices on energy. 
Astonishingly, what the Democrats are 
proposing at this time are the highest 
natural gas prices in 7 years, and a 
tough season coming for the cost of 
heating oil and heating gas. This could 
raise taxes on American natural gas as 
well, when prices are at a 7-year high. 
What happens to these costs with 
these taxes? 
Of course, they get handed off to con-
sumers in the form of higher prices.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8229 
November 16, 2021 
If Democrats pass this bill, the Amer-
ican people are going to pay more at 
the pump, more at the store, and more 
on tax day. 
So, last week, the nonpartisan Tax 
Policy Center said this bill would raise 
taxes on nearly one-third of middle- 
class families. 
Didn’t Joe Biden say he wasn’t going 
to do that? 
Well, who is right: the President of 
the United States, whose approval is at 
an all-time low and only 21 percent of 
Americans think the country is going 
in the right direction, or the Tax Pol-
icy Center that says that a third of all 
middle-class families will end up pay-
ing more taxes if this is signed into 
law? 
This is a blatant violation of the 
President’s campaign promises. The 
last thing the American people need 
right now is higher taxes, more debt, 
and higher prices. The last thing the 
American people need is this reckless 
tax-and-spending spree. 
It is no wonder that 71 percent of 
Americans think our country today is 
on the wrong track, and this includes 
many Americans who actually voted 
last November for Joe Biden. 
What do the American people want? 
Well, they want us to produce more 
American energy so they can pay less 
for energy. They want us to make it 
easier for people to get back to work. 
They want higher wages and lower 
prices. 
That is not what we are hearing from 
the Democrats. 
So that is my response to the major-
ity leader when he asks why not a sin-
gle Republican would support this 
reckless tax-and-spending spree. 
With Thanksgiving coming, we need 
to stop this reckless spending ‘‘cold 
turkey.’’ 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
VACCINES 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, last week, 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth 
Circuit issued an emergency stay on 
President Biden’s sweeping vaccine 
mandate. The court granted the stay, 
citing ‘‘grave statutory and constitu-
tional issues’’ with the mandate. The 
22-page order is persuasive and compel-
ling in explaining the grave effects the 
mandate will have on businesses and 
individuals 
alike 
throughout 
the 
United States. 
The order also explains that the lim-
ited nature of the Federal Government 
under the Constitution simply doesn’t 
allow for sweeping mandates of this na-
ture, generally, but it certainly doesn’t 
allow for sweeping mandates like this 
one without an act of Congress. You 
see, our powers within the Federal 
Government 
are 
carefully 
cir-
cumscribed; they are carefully con-
strained. 
The 
Constitution 
brings 
about a balancing, a limitation on pow-
ers that operate along two axes. The 
vertical constraint is called federalism, 
and the horizontal constraint is some-
thing we refer to as the separation of 
powers. 
The Federal Government’s powers 
are, as James Madison described them 
in Federalist No. 45, ‘‘few and defined,’’ 
while those reserved to the States are 
‘‘numerous and indefinite.’’ Likewise, 
within the three branches, we have 
these protections in place to make sure 
that no one person can exercise what 
power the Federal Government does 
have exclusively; you can’t accumulate 
too much power. So the President of 
the United States, under our constitu-
tional system, isn’t a King and may 
not rule by decree. He is not free to 
just do things because he thinks they 
are a good idea. 
The judges also, refreshingly, as-
serted the commerce clause of the Con-
stitution and brought up the commerce 
clause as the source of the claimed au-
thority for Federal action under this 
circumstance, noting that, even under 
broad interpretations of the commerce 
clause that we have seen from the Fed-
eral court system since 1937, the com-
merce clause is not unlimited in the 
scope of the authority that it provides 
to the Federal Government, and in this 
case, it certainly doesn’t authorize the 
Occupational Safety and Health Ad-
ministration to issue a sweeping vac-
cine mandate on all companies with 
more than 99 employees nor does the 
commerce clause even authorize Con-
gress to undertake such an action, 
which, of course, Congress has not un-
dertaken. 
We have erred dangerously, over 
many decades, from the true applica-
tion of the Constitution’s limits. In 
many respects, we have lost sight even 
of the fact that this is a government of 
limited powers, and now that lack of 
those limits—the lack of respect for 
those limits within those who operate 
the Federal Government—is placing 
millions of Americans at risk of not 
only becoming unemployed but, in 
many cases, unemployable. Some in 
Congress are, today, taking it even fur-
ther in asking the President of the 
United States to impose a vaccine or a 
test mandate as a condition precedent 
for interstate travel. 
Now, I have heard from hundreds of 
Utahns who are at risk of losing their 
jobs because of this now, thankfully, 
halted mandate. These are not bad peo-
ple. To the contrary, they are good 
people. They are our neighbors and our 
friends. They are everyday Americans 
who are all too often just trying to get 
by to provide for their families. They 
are not our enemies, and it is troubling 
to think that the President of the 
United States said—on national tele-
vision no less—that he is ‘‘losing [his] 
patience’’ with them. What does that 
even mean? In fact, recent polling 
numbers show that, if anything, it ap-
pears to be the other way around. We 
are losing patience with him and with 
his broad assertions of authority that 
he doesn’t even have. 
I have come to the Senate floor about 
15 times now to oppose this vaccine 
mandate. I have offered a dozen bills to 
limit, clarify, or otherwise counteract 
the vaccine mandate. Each time, one or 
another of my colleagues from the 
other side of the aisle has objected to 
what should be uncontroversial bills. 
Let’s review each of these that we have 
gone through so far. 
Now, this started back on September 
28 with S. 2850. This bill, S. 2850, would 
have provided exemptions for those 
with religious or moral objections to 
the vaccine mandate. President Biden, 
significantly, had promised these ex-
emptions would be in the mandate, but 
for some reason—for some reason that 
I 
struggle 
to 
understand—Senate 
Democrats, nonetheless, objected to 
the passage of that bill. 
So then I came back, and I offered up 
S. 2840, the Don’t Jab Me Act, a bill 
that would require that the Federal 
Government make those who suffer 
from the vaccine mandate financially 
whole. The Democrats rejected that 
bill too. 
Next, I offered S. 2843, the No Tax-
ation Without Congressional Consent 
Act, a bill that would require congres-
sional authorization before the fines 
associated with the mandate could be 
charged to businesses. Notwithstanding 
the fact that the Constitution is very 
clear about where taxes need to origi-
nate within our system of government, 
the Democrats objected to that bill as 
well. 
So then I came back with another 
bill. This time it was S. 2848, the Your 
Health Comes First Act. This is a bill 
that would offer exemptions from the 
mandate to those who have preexisting 
medical or other health concerns about 
the vaccine. This is also another ex-
emption that President Biden himself 
promised in his speech when first an-
nouncing the vaccine mandate, but it 
is an exemption that the Senate Demo-
crats, apparently, didn’t feel worthy of 
codifying with legislation, and so they 
objected to that one too. This one was 
particularly surprising because if, in 
fact, President Biden himself felt com-
fortable with those exemptions, one 
would think that there wouldn’t be dis-
comfort with codifying what he himself 
said should be the law. 
So then, in response to that, I re-
turned to this Chamber on another day, 
and I offered up S. 2846, the Natural 
Immunity is Real Act. This bill would 
require that the Federal vaccine man-
date 
recognize 
natural 
immunity. 
Countries across the world recognize 
this immunity for the powerful protec-
tion that it, in fact, provides, a protec-
tion that, according to some studies, 
may be as much as 27 times stronger 
than that offered by the vaccine alone. 
Unfortunately, President Biden’s man-
date wasn’t so generous on that point.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8230 
November 16, 2021 
This bill, too, was rejected by the 
Democrats, 
disregarding 
science’s 
showing the very real impact of nat-
ural immunity. 
So I came back, and I offered up S. 
2847, the Let Me Travel America Act. 
Now, this bill would prohibit the re-
quirement of vaccination before citi-
zens could travel between the States. 
Apparently, the Democrats want to 
leave that option open because they ob-
jected to that one too. Well, that one is 
not in the vaccine mandate. It is 
feared, as I mentioned a few minutes 
ago, that that might be on the table. 
Apparently, it still is because people 
were unwilling to codify what should 
be a natural conclusion for most Amer-
icans to reach, which is that our right 
to travel from one State to another 
without permission from the Federal 
Government ought not be interfered 
with and that it is fundamental that 
we shouldn’t mess with it. That is why 
it was unfortunate that this one, too, 
drew an objection. 
So I returned. I hoped that this body 
could give some assurance and some re-
spect to the brave men and women of 
our military who are at risk of losing 
benefits and losing the right to serve 
over this vaccine mandate. So my bill 
that I offered that day, S. 2842, the Re-
specting 
Our 
Servicemembers 
Act, 
would protect servicemembers from 
losing their livelihoods and their bene-
fits—that 
they 
have 
accrued 
and 
earned through their valiant service— 
as a result of the mandate. The Demo-
crats objected to this one too. That is 
particularly sad. These are heroes. 
These are people on whom we rely to 
keep us safe. We ought to give them 
more trust than that. We ought to not 
put them in a position in which many 
of them are facing a difficult decision. 
So I offered another bill. I returned 
to this body, and I offered a bill that 
should be one of the least controversial 
measures that we have ever considered, 
not just about the vaccine mandate but 
about anything. That bill, the Parental 
Consent for Vaccination Act, would 
have simply required that parental 
consent be provided before COVID–19 
vaccines were given to children. The 
Democrats objected to that as well. 
So I came back, and I offered the 
Transparency in COVID–19 Vaccination 
Act. This bill would have provided in-
formation regarding vaccine side ef-
fects to the public. It would have just 
made sure that the American people 
had access to that information. I 
thought information would build con-
fidence in the vaccines. The Democrats 
disagreed, and they objected. Appar-
ently, that was too much. I don’t know 
why people wouldn’t want more infor-
mation. I actually think that would 
have built confidence in the vaccine, 
but, apparently, they didn’t see it that 
way or maybe they just didn’t want 
people to have access to the informa-
tion. I don’t know. I can’t speak for 
them. I just know they objected. 
So I came back for the 10th time. I 
offered up the Transparency in COVID– 
19 Research Act. This bill would have 
provided 
research 
and 
information 
drawn from that research—that the 
American taxpayers are paying for—to 
the public, that should be available to 
the public. We pay for that research. 
We ought to know what the findings 
are. The government shouldn’t have 
anything to hide and wouldn’t have 
anything to hide here, but the Demo-
crats disagreed, and they objected to 
that one as well. 
So I tried again. I came back, and I 
offered up S. 2851, the Transparency in 
COVID–19 Expenditures Act. This bill 
is just a good housekeeping measure. It 
is a commonsense measure. It is not 
something that should have been either 
liberal or conservative or thought of as 
Republican or Democratic. It is just a 
good housekeeping matter. You know, 
I think it is strange that it would be 
controversial, given the simplicity of 
what it would do. It would simply call 
for an audit regarding how our COVID– 
19 funds have been spent. I thought the 
information would be helpful to us as 
we make policy moving forward, and 
yet the Democrats objected to that 
one. 
So I tried again. I offered a 12th bill 
that would simply end the mandate. 
The No Forced Vaccination for COVID– 
19 Act would clarify that Federal law 
does not authorize OSHA or any other 
Federal Agency to implement a general 
vaccine mandate, but the Democrats 
objected to that one too. 
Twelve times—twelve bills. Some 
were simpler than others. Some should 
have involved no controversy whatso-
ever. Some just inserted good prin-
ciples 
of 
lawmaking 
or 
constitu-
tionalism generally or federalism in 
particular. Each one was rejected, one 
right after the other after the other, 
repeated 12 times. 
Thankfully, while some in this body 
have floundered, judges on the Fifth 
Circuit fulfilled their duty to the 
American people and their oaths to the 
Constitution. That does not mean, 
however, that this fight is anywhere 
near over. It will continue in the 
courts, where the States and the Biden 
administration will each be able to 
make their case. But I am also going to 
continue this fight here. I will stand 
for those Utahns and those Americans 
who are at risk specifically because of 
this mandate. 
It is also important for us to remem-
ber that separate and apart from what 
the courts might do, we have an inde-
pendent obligation, having each taken 
an oath to uphold and protect and de-
fend the Constitution of the United 
States in the fulfillment of our duties. 
We need to make sure that before au-
thority is exercised—especially author-
ity operating in such a personal man-
ner on such a personal issue as this— 
that power isn’t being taken from 
those to whom it belongs. The power in 
our system of government belongs to 
the people, and in the absence of a dele-
gation of power to the Federal Govern-
ment, that power is retained by the 
States respectively or by the people. 
So we ought to be looking at this 
carefully and closely, analyzing it on 
our own. We can’t assume that the 
Federal courts will save us from our 
own unconstitutional actions. 
I have been critical of Presidents of 
both political parties when they have 
taken actions that exceed the scope of 
their authority as President of the 
United States or of actions enacted by 
the legislative branch under the direc-
tion of either political party that ex-
ceed the power of the Federal Govern-
ment. This is an issue that is not Re-
publican or Democratic. It is not lib-
eral. It is not conservative. It is simply 
an American issue. It is a constitu-
tional issue. We ought to be debating 
it, discussing these things here, and 
not waiting for the courts to act. 
One of the profound frustrations that 
I have encountered over the years is 
that sometimes people will conflate 
the issue of constitutionality with liti-
gation. They will assume that con-
stitutional issues are those that have 
to be addressed in the courts and only 
in the courts. 
Fortunately, we have the courts to 
adjudicate disputes and the meaning of 
statutes and provisions of the Con-
stitution, but that doesn’t excuse us of 
our responsibility to provide an inde-
pendent check and balance to make 
sure that authority isn’t being exer-
cised where it should not. It is espe-
cially important where, as here, we are 
dealing with a fundamentally mis-
guided and, I believe, immoral propo-
sition; that is, that individual Ameri-
cans, hard-working moms and dads 
throughout this country, ought ever to 
be put into a position by their govern-
ment to choose between, on the one 
hand, receiving a medical procedure 
that they may not want or to which 
they may have religious or other moral 
objections or which they might have a 
specific health concern, for example— 
they ought not ever be put in a posi-
tion where they have to choose be-
tween that unwanted medical proce-
dure on the one hand and on the other 
hand, the ability to put bread on the 
table for their children. That is not 
right. The American people know it, 
and deep down, they know something is 
terribly wrong whenever one person 
can, with the stroke of the Executive 
pen, issue so broad, so deep, and so im-
moral a mandate. 
I am not going to stand for this. I 
will be back. I will be back tomorrow. 
I will be back the next day. I will be 
back as often as it takes, as long as it 
takes. I am not going to stop until we 
win this fight. 
Thank you. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll.

November 16, 2021 
NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, after 
months of delay, I am glad Senator 
SCHUMER has finally indicated he will 
allow the National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act to come to the Senate floor 
this week. 
For each of the last 60 consecutive 
years, Congress has passed an NDAA to 
ensure that our servicemembers and 
military leaders had the resources they 
need to safeguard our democracy and 
our freedoms. 
This bill is how we maintain our 
military bases, modernize our force, 
and invest in the next generation of 
weapons that we hope we will never 
need to use but which are necessary for 
deterrence. It is how we strengthen our 
relationship with old allies and forge 
strong partnerships with new ones. It is 
how we address the global threat land-
scape and ensure our troops have the 
training, equipment, and the resources 
they need to counter adversaries of 
today and tomorrow. 
From threats by an increasingly hos-
tile Iran to those by an unpredictable 
North Korea, there are many chal-
lenges on the horizon, but there is no 
question that the greatest threat to 
the world order and to peace itself is 
the People’s Republic of China. 
The Chinese Communist Party has 
made no secret of its desire to continue 
to squash democracy, as they did in 
Hong Kong, and impose its economic, 
political, and military power on the 
rest of the world. 
Here at home, we are intensely aware 
of how China’s aggression can impact 
our economy and supply chains for 
critical components of everything from 
cell phones to our fifth-generation 
stealth fighter, the F–35. Our depend-
ency on advanced semiconductors man-
ufactured in Taiwan and in Asia is a 
threat to America’s economic and na-
tional security, but the most urgent 
and grave threats are against countries 
closer to China’s borders. 
Last week, I had the chance to lead a 
congressional 
delegation 
visiting 
Southeast Asia to gain a better under-
standing of the threats and challenges 
in the region. The area spanning from 
Pearl Harbor all the way to the west-
ern border of India is the largest mili-
tary theater in the world and is over-
seen by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command 
and is home to 40 percent of the world’s 
population. My colleagues and I had 
the opportunity to hear from our mili-
tary leadership and key foreign part-
ners in the region and gain a better un-
derstanding of ongoing and anticipated 
security threats, mainly from China. 
China has already co-opted, as I said, 
a formerly democratic Hong Kong. 
It is building missile batteries and 
aircraft runways for its bombers on ar-
tificial islands. It threatens freedom of 
navigation in international waters. It 
is guilty of gross human rights abuses 
against its own people; namely, the 
Muslim minority Uighurs. It is engaged 
in a border war with India. And it 
threatens to invade the Republic of 
China, otherwise known as Taiwan. 
Here at home, there is no question 
that China is a looming presence, but 
it is not in our backyard. We don’t see 
its warships on our coastlines, or worry 
about an imminent military invasion 
on our shores. 
But that is not the case in the Indo- 
Pacific. In the Philippines, we caught a 
ride on a Navy P–8 aircraft over dis-
puted waters. Within minutes of leav-
ing Philippine airspace, we spotted a 
Chinese spy ship engaged in intel-
ligence gathering operations off the 
Philippine coast. 
We traveled to India, where we met 
with Prime Minister Modi and Cabinet 
officials to discuss threats posed by 
China, as well as other shared prior-
ities. But one of the main topics was 
the timetable for a Chinese invasion of 
Taiwan. 
In every way possible, Taiwan is a 
stark contrast to the People’s Republic 
of China. It is a true democracy, with 
elections whose results are not pre-
determined. It is a free-market econ-
omy that adheres to the rule of law. 
And it shares the same basic values we 
embrace in the United States: freedom 
of speech, freedom of press, religion, 
and assembly. 
Despite the fact that Taiwan has 
been a self-governing entity for more 
than 70 years, the Chinese Communist 
Party continues to claim the island na-
tion as part of its territory. But as the 
Indian Minister for Foreign Affairs 
said, Taiwan isn’t just a Taiwan prob-
lem; it is a China problem. 
In other words, what is at stake here 
is much larger than the future of one 
nation; it is the entire scope of Bei-
jing’s power and ambitions in the re-
gion. If China is able to capture Tai-
wan, there is no reason to believe that 
the Chinese Communist Party would 
stop there. 
China also has territorial claims 
against the Philippines, Japan, Viet-
nam, and India. We shouldn’t view Tai-
wan as the CCP’s ultimate goal, but as 
the first domino in a quest to reach re-
gional and global dominance. If Taiwan 
falls, it will not be the end, but, rather, 
a beginning. 
As the Taiwanese Minister of Foreign 
Affairs told us, Taiwan is democracy’s 
outpost 
standing 
watch 
against 
authoritarianism. 
I believe we have a legal and moral 
obligation to stand with Taiwan and 
deter China from invading. And we also 
have our own national security at 
stake. 
There is an old saying that an ounce 
of prevention is worth a pound of cure. 
In defense parlance, that means peace 
through strength; deterrence. There 
must be a strategy to dissuade China 
from an attempt to seize Taiwan. And 
there is no question that time is of the 
essence. 
Our delegation met with the com-
mander of the Indo-Pacific Command, 
who described the current power dy-
namic rather succinctly. He said it is 
not a question of if China invades Tai-
wan, but when. 
According to our top military lead-
ers, we have an idea of how long that 
might happen, because Xi Jinping him-
self has said he wants to be ready to in-
vade by 2027. 
But we have been wrong before. I re-
member when people said that the 
Taliban—the intelligence community 
said it would take 2 years for the 
Taliban to take over Afghanistan, and 
we saw that happen almost in the blink 
of an eye. No one thought that country 
would fall to the Taliban before we 
even hit the withdrawal deadline, and 
we certainly did not expect the with-
drawal in Afghanistan to turn into a 
rapid emergency evacuation mission. 
Taiwan might be safe for 6 years, but 
we can’t operate on that assumption. 
We need to work with Taiwan and our 
friends and allies in the region to raise 
the costs, such that the PRC decides it 
is not worth its time and effort. 
The defense authorization bill is one 
critical way we can do that. It includes 
a bipartisan bill I introduced with Sen-
ator DUCKWORTH, called the Taiwan 
Partnership Act. It would establish a 
partnership between the U.S. National 
Guard and Taiwanese defense forces to 
strengthen Taiwan’s preparedness. 
Should troops need to deploy quickly 
in the event of a crisis, they would be 
armed with the same knowledge and 
skills as our dedicated U.S. National 
Guardsmen. 
The NDAA includes other provisions 
to increase defense cooperation with 
Taiwan and equip the U.S. Indo-Pacific 
Command with more resources. I ap-
preciate my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle who have championed these 
provisions. 
As I said earlier, we have a moral im-
perative to stand with Taiwan and 
show China that the costs of invading 
are far greater than the benefits. But 
we have our own national security in-
terests at stake because, if the supply 
of semiconductors from Taiwan were 
cut off, it would be a body blow to the 
American economy and our national 
security. 
I am glad Australia has already sig-
naled its support for Taiwan, and I 
hope more of our international part-
ners will follow suit—particularly the 
quad composed of Australia, Japan, 
and India and the United States. 
Beijing can try to exert its muscle 
around the world, but the United 
States has one thing that China never 
will have, and that is friends and allies. 
I am grateful to our partners in the 
Indo-Pacific and around the world who 
have fought and who will continue to 
fight to preserve freedom and democ-
racy. It is an honor to spend time with 
them. And on behalf of our entire dele-
gation, I want to thank all of our hosts 
for their hospitality. 
Our trip to the Indo-Pacific was a 
timely reminder of the critical need to 
invest in our national defense and sup-
port our allies, new and old. 
As the Senate prepares to begin con-
sideration of the Defense authorization 
bill, I would encourage all of us to keep

in mind our solemn responsibility to 
support our national defense. That is 
our No. 1 priority. All of our other free-
doms flow from our ability to protect 
and defend the American people. 
Whether 
our 
servicemembers 
are 
guarding against threats from China, 
Russia, Iran, North Korea, or terrorist 
groups, they need the backing of a 
strong National Defense Authorization 
Act to succeed. 
I appreciate the bipartisan work of 
the 
Armed 
Services 
Committee, 
chaired by Chairman REED and Rank-
ing Member INHOFE, and appreciate 
their hard work in getting this bill 
ready for our consideration. The com-
mittee, during its markup, adopted 143 
bipartisan amendments and reported 
out the final bill by a vote of 23 to 3. 
You don’t get much more bipartisan 
than that around here. 
This legislation has been waiting in 
the wings for months, and I am glad we 
can finally begin consideration of this 
critical legislation this week. 
I hope we can continue the legacy of 
bipartisanship that guides this legisla-
tion through the Senate. This debate 
should be about how to defend our na-
tional security, how to deter tyrants 
and bullies from around the world, and 
guarantee the blessings of liberty to all 
democracies—those that share our val-
ues. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

minutes of debate, equally divided. 
The Senator from Connecticut. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I will 
admit that I have some level of confu-
sion when I listen to my Republican 
colleagues come to the floor and reg-
ister their complaints when matched 
against the actual policy positions that 
my Republican colleagues hold. And I 
want to present two examples of my 
confusion this morning. 
First, I have heard many of my Re-
publican colleagues come to the floor 
of the Senate and talk about their con-
cern about price increases in the econ-
omy today—and then register votes 
against the measures that would help 
families afford things. 
Many of my Senate Republican col-
leagues voted for the bipartisan infra-
structure, but more voted against it. In 
the House of Representatives, there is 
discussion of purging from the Repub-
lican Party any members of the House 
Republican conference that voted for 
the 
infrastructure; 
notwithstanding 
the fact that in that bill is funding 
that will have a deflationary impact on 
the economy: money for ports, money 
for infrastructure, money to be able to 
move goods and people more quickly 
across this country. 
The Build Back Better agenda—the 
bill that is going to move before the 
House and the Senate this month with 
no Republican support—is all about re-
ducing costs for average, regular Amer-
icans: reducing the cost of healthcare, 
reducing the cost of energy, reducing 
the cost of childcare. 
Childcare expenses are driving Amer-
ican families crazy today—absolutely 
crazy. The Build Back Better Act will 
reduce the cost of childcare by 10 to 
$15,000 for families in my State. 
Republicans oppose the Build Back 
Better Act because it increases some 
taxes on billionaires and millionaires. 
It asks every corporation to pay a min-
imum amount of tax so that compa-
nies, like Amazon and Google, don’t 
get away with paying nothing or next 
to nothing in tax. 
The reason why so many Republicans 
oppose the Build Back Better agenda is 
because it is about transferring eco-
nomic power from the haves—from the 
economic elites to folks who have been 
getting the short end of the stick, who 
have been getting fleeced by this econ-
omy. 
When Republicans had the chance to 
cut costs, they did it only for billion-
aires and millionaires. Eighty percent 
of the Republican tax cut went to the 
richest 1 or 2 percent of the economy. 
When Democrats have control of the 
Senate, we deliver tax cuts for the mid-
dle class and for the poor. We deliver 
cost reductions for average American 
families. 
Wages are going up higher than the 
rate of personal consumption inflation. 
Right? Personal consumption inflation 
is just under 5 percent. Wages in the 
last 12 months have gone up by over 5 
percent. 
People are making more money. Part 
of the consequence of people making 
more money is that some costs go up. 
But when Republicans were in charge 
of the White House and the Congress, 
we just were, largely, flat. Wages are 
finally going up. People are making 
more money. 
And we are going to have legislation 
on the floor of the Senate that dra-
matically cuts costs for average Amer-
ican families, and that legislation like-
ly will get not a single Republican 
vote. 
Republicans’ priorities, historically, 
have been to deliver benefits to the 
wealthy, to the elites, to their cor-
porate friends. And so when faced with 
a very different agenda—an agenda 
that is all about cost reduction, tax 
cuts for average families, for families 
making $30,000 a year, for plumbers, for 
teachers, for factory workers, for jani-
tors—not a single Republican vote. 
So therein lies my confusion that I 
hear a lot of my Republican col-
leagues—Republican colleagues that I 
like, that I respect—come to the floor 
and complain about costs and then 
refuse to deliver a single vote for the 
most significant legislation to reduce 
costs for families that this body has 
considered during my time in the Sen-
ate. 
Here is my second reason for confu-
sion. Now, encounters with migrants 
without documentation has come down 
at the border 3 months in a row—pretty 
dramatic reduction, in fact, when it 
comes to unaccompanied minors and 
families. That is because this Presi-
dent’s policies are working. 
That is probably the reason you don’t 
hear as many Republicans coming 
down to the floor talking about the 
surge at the border. But Republicans 
have been down here consistently for 
months talking about the crisis they 
described at the border. 
And so my confusion here is con-
nected to their avowed concern about 
the surge at the border and then their 
decision to oppose a Homeland Secu-
rity budget that would help us address 
those escalating numbers at the bor-
der. 
Right now, Senate Republicans are 
refusing to negotiate with Democrats 
on a budget for 2021 and 2022. That is 
what is going on right now. Histori-
cally, we always had differences when 
it comes to our priorities in the budg-
et, but we always sat down and nego-
tiated. Right now, Senate Republicans 
are boycotting discussions over a budg-
et. And one of the theories is that 
many Republicans would like to see a 
continuing 
resolution—the 
Trump 
spending levels continued for the rest 
of 2021, 2022. 
Let me tell you what the impact of 
that would be when it comes to our op-
erations at the border. I want to ex-
plain this because I have the honor to 
chair 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee overseeing the Department 
of Homeland Security, and we, just a 
few weeks ago, introduced a budget for 
the Department of Homeland Security 
for fiscal year 2022. But if this budget 
or a version of it negotiated with Re-
publicans doesn’t pass, the result is ca-
tastrophe at the border. 
This budget includes $178 million for 
medicine and medical contracts for un-
accompanied children that arrive at 
our border—desperately needed med-
ical care for all of these children and 
families that are arriving at the bor-
der. None of it would be available if we 
went on a continuing resolution. We 
would have a health crisis at the bor-
der. 
There is $130 million for three perma-
nent multipurpose, multiagency facili-
ties, which will streamline the proc-
esses of individuals who present at the 
border. Right now, we have these 
megaexpensive, inhumane, soft-sided 
facilities. That significant investment 
at the border cannot happen if we have 
a continuing resolution.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8233 
November 16, 2021 
There is $25 million in this budget for 
increased transportation costs, allow-
ing Border Patrol to reduce over-
crowding in facilities, moving individ-
uals from crowded facilities to facili-
ties that have room. None of that 
transportation money is available in a 
CR, which means the overcrowding 
gets worse. 
But the crisis is even bigger because 
without a new budget, we can’t pay the 
Border Patrol. We will have a $770 mil-
lion payroll shortfall—almost $1 billion 
payroll shortfall—if we have a CR in 
the Department of Homeland Security 
rather than a new budget. 
That will cripple our ability to man-
age the border. That will either mean 
massive layoffs of CBP personnel, 
USCIS personnel, or it will mean a 
massive reprogramming in which the 
Biden administration is forced to take 
money from cybersecurity and put it 
onto the border or steal money from 
the Coast Guard in coastal defense and 
put it on the border. 
One independent study showed that a 
decrease of just 33 CBP officers at our 
ports of entry would decrease GDP by 
$66 million and lead to a loss of over 
1,000 jobs. Why? Because at our ports of 
entry, 
when 
you 
have 
a 
massive 
downsizing of personnel, wait times go 
up, businesses lose money. 
If we are on a CR and we don’t pass 
a budget, Coast Guard readiness is 
compromised. The money in this budg-
et for a new offshore patrol cutter, for 
national 
security 
cutters, 
for 
the 
sustainment of the aging rotary wing 
aircraft 
fleet—unavailable. 
So 
our 
Coast Guard readiness continues to suf-
fer, compromising U.S. national secu-
rity. 
We all know that cybersecurity is an 
increasing existential threat to the 
United States, and so this budget pro-
poses a significant increase in our cy-
bersecurity defenses. How is the De-
partment of Homeland Security, with-
out a budget if a CR is extended 
through the end of the year—we can’t 
adjust any of our funding programs or 
priorities when it comes to cybersecu-
rity. We are essentially stuck in a pre- 
SolarWinds environment in the Depart-
ment of Homeland Security without 
the 
ability 
to 
adjust 
for 
current 
threats. 
Finally, we will just be wasting a ton 
of taxpayer money. I will give you one 
example. Right now, we have thou-
sands of empty ICE detention beds— 
thousands of empty ICE detention 
beds. We pay contractors to maintain 
these beds, to staff these beds, but 
there is nobody in them and there is 
likely not going to be anybody in those 
beds for the entirety of fiscal year 2022. 
But if you are on a continuing resolu-
tion and don’t pass a new budget nego-
tiated 
together, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, then we are paying for beds 
we don’t need. We are just wasting tax-
payer dollars. 
If we don’t pass a budget, if we don’t 
update the appropriations bill for the 
Department of Homeland Security, we 
are going to be gutting our border pro-
tection, we are going to be costing the 
economy billions of dollars, we are 
going to be compromising the defense 
of this Nation, and we are going to be 
wasting taxpayer dollars. 
We are sent here to be proper and re-
sponsible stewards of our constitu-
ents’—our taxpayers’—hard-earned dol-
lars. They don’t like sending their 
money to Washington, but they do so 
under the belief that we are going to be 
careful about how we spend it. 
By just extending 2021 spending lev-
els to 2022, especially when it comes to 
the defense of this Nation, especially 
when it comes to the protection of our 
borders, a CR could be disastrous as 
much as it is wildly irresponsible. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week, the Senate will consider Jona-
than Kanter’s nomination to be Assist-
ant Attorney General for the Justice 
Department’s Antitrust Division. 
Mr. Kanter is a distinguished anti-
trust lawyer with decades of experience 
in the public and private sectors. He re-
ceived his undergraduate degree from 
the State University of New York at 
Albany and his law degree from Wash-
ington University School of Law. 
After graduating, he worked as an at-
torney for the Federal Trade Commis-
sion’s Bureau of Competition. He then 
went on to spend more than 20 years in 
private practice as an antitrust lawyer. 
During that time, Mr. Kanter has be-
come a highly influential advocate for 
strong and meaningful antitrust en-
forcement, with a special focus on the 
digital economy. 
And he has earned support from 
across the political spectrum. Nine 
former heads of the Justice Depart-
ment’s 
Antitrust 
Division—rep-
resenting every presidential adminis-
tration going back to Gerald Ford— 
submitted a letter urging the Senate to 
quickly confirm Mr. Kanter. 
These former leaders of the Antitrust 
Division wrote: ‘‘Jonathan Kanter has 
the talent and the leadership skills to 
do the job well. . . . He knows the sub-
stance of antitrust. He appreciates its 
importance 
to 
the 
American 
con-
sumer. . . . In short, we believe Mr. 
Kanter is right for this important posi-
tion.’’ 
The members of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee agree. Mr. Kanter was 
voted out of the committee by voice 
vote, a testament to his bipartisan sup-
port. 
With his extensive experience as an 
antitrust lawyer, deep knowledge of 
the law, and masterful understanding 
of the challenges facing antitrust law 
enforcers, Mr. Kanter would be an out-
standing addition to the Justice De-
partment. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
supporting his nomination.

HONORING SERGEANT BREANNA J. 
JESSOP 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, months ago, 
as Americans watched harrowing video 
footage of the Afghanistan evacuation 
efforts, service men and women from 
around the world rose to the challenge 
of a complex mission. As the chaos per-
sisted, the 82nd Airborne Division of 
the U.S. Army was called on to support 
noncombatant evacuation operations— 
NEO—at Hamid Karzai International 
Airport in Afghanistan. They com-
pleted their mission honorably. 
One member of the 82nd Airborne Di-
vision, Sgt. Breanna J. Jessop, a chap-
lain assistant, assumed the role as the 
noncommissioned 
officer—NCO—in 
charge of the airport chapel. Sergeant 
Jessop, despite tremendous obstacles of 
ongoing and imminent threats, con-
ducted herself with courage, discipline, 
and attention to detail. Her work saved 
many. 
Always putting the well-being of her 
fellow soldiers first, Sergeant Jessop 
used her ingenuity to ensure 4,000 U.S. 
military personnel and coalition forces 
had access to basic hygiene items at a 
time when resources were, at best, lim-
ited. Further, she made time to assist 
soldiers with religious support, help 
care for those who had suffered casual-
ties, and ensure the well-being of the 
soldiers with whom she served. 
At the height of the NEO mission, 
Sergeant Jessop showed outstanding 
leadership. She oversaw the operation 
of an entire orphanage that had been 
formed as a result of the increase in 
unaccompanied minors at the airport. 
She led the mission to assist in caring 
for children and offered assistance for 
children ranging from newborn babies 
to 17 years old. As a result of her 
untiring humanitarian efforts, over 400 
displaced children were kept safe dur-
ing the NEO mission. 
Outside of her assigned duties and re-
sponsibilities, Sergeant Jessop, has 
helped pioneer the Under the Canopy 
Program which serves as a touchpoint 
forum for lower enlisted paratroopers. 
There, she provides vital leadership to 
assist with planning, preparing, and 
overseeing the execution of each event. 
Her work helps hundreds of para-
troopers each month to identify issues 
and discuss new and ongoing initia-
tives. 
Sgt. Breanna J. Jessop, a native of 
Myton, UT, truly represents the U.S. 
Army values and what it means to be a 
paratrooper and Sky Dragon soldier. 
About Sergeant Jessop, Maj. Gen. 
Chris Donahue once said, ‘‘There are so 
many different words that you could 
use to describe her: strength, resil-
ience, willingness to share what others 
would never be willing to . . . that’s 
the type of remarkable person and 
paratrooper that she is.’’ I could not 
agree more. 
Sergeant Jessop was recently recog-
nized by the United Service Organiza-
tions as the 2021 Service Member of the 
Year. This award is fitting and well-de-
served. Yet no award will ever fully 
honor the service of Sergeant Jessop. 
Her dedicated service to the children 
orphaned 
at 
Hamid 
Karzai 
Inter-
national 
Airport 
and 
her 
fellow 
servicemembers is commendable and 
will be remembered and revered in the 
hearts of many for years to come.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO LISA PISTERMAN 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor a fellow Kentuckian, 
Lisa 
Pisterman, 
from 
the 
Schnitzelburg community of Louis-
ville, KY. You may not know this 
unique neighborhood that dates back 
to 1866. But you are all familiar with 
historic communities that helped form 
the fabric of your own hometown or 
metropolitan area, and you have wit-
nessed many of them struggle to pre-
serve their unique heritage while re-
maining relevant in a modern econ-
omy. 
To that end, Lisa Pisterman served 
as president of the Schnitzelburg Area 
Community Council during a very chal-
lenging period when the council had 
struggled to move forward. With Lisa 
at the helm, a new sense of unity and 
purpose has emerged, and great things 
are happening. 
In addition to her leadership on the 
council, Lisa has served as one of the 
local historians, allowing natives of 
the community and newcomers alike to 
reflect on its history and envision what 
is to come. 
Lisa is the author of ‘‘Louisville’s 
Germantown & Schnitzelburg’’ and is 
currently working with other individ-
uals 
to 
build 
the 
Germantown 
Schnitzelburg History Museum where 
visitors can study this community’s 
contributions to our great Common-
wealth. 
As her friends and neighbors recog-
nize Lisa this month as Schnitzelburg’s 
No. 1 Citizen, I want to personally 
thank her for all she has done and con-
tinues to do for her community and to 
wish her great success in the future.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING ARNE SORENSON 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor the esteemed legacy of 
my friend, Arne Sorenson, who passed 
away earlier this year. Arne’s many ac-
complishments in his personal and pro-
fessional life continue to profoundly 
impact the lives of many. Most re-
cently, Arne’s Marriott family, num-
bering over 120,000 employees, wit-
nessed his high-caliber leadership as he 
navigated the company through a tur-
bulent period in the hospitality indus-
try. Arne was a faithful and compas-
sionate servant leader, and I will al-
ways cherish his friendship. 
Arne’s contagious spirit of kindness 
and generosity sets a high standard for 
what success looks like, in both public 
and private life. As a business execu-
tive, he cared deeply for his employees 
and customers and continued to serve 
as president and CEO while privately 
persevering 
through 
extraordinary 
health challenges. His selfless leader-
ship is an example we can all aspire to. 
The culture he helped build and fos-
ter at Marriott is unmatched. Arne’s 
decades of experience in the hospitality 
industry yielded outstanding results 
for his enterprise, notably the acquisi-
tion of over 30 hotel groups, elevating 
Marriott to be the largest hotel chain 
in the world. His humility and wisdom 
often carried the day. He consistently 
praised and recognized the achieve-
ments of his employees and partners 
and 
always 
sought 
feedback 
from 
friends, family, colleagues, and cus-
tomers. 
Above all, Arne was a faithful and 
loving husband, father, and friend. His 
integrity and values-based decision 
making extended from the business 
world to the benefit of everyone lucky 
enough to have known him, especially 
his wonderful family. Arne’s wife and 
four children were his greatest pride, 
joy, and purpose, and while they now 
mourn his loss, I hope they may find 
comfort knowing Arne’s light will 
shine on for eternity. May he rest in 
peace.∑

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

November 16, 2021 
PRESIDENTIAL MESSAGE 
REPORT OF THE CONTINUATION 
OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY 
THAT 
WAS 
ORIGINALLY 
DE-
CLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 
13851 OF NOVEMBER 27, 2018, WITH 
RESPECT TO NICARAGUA—PM 17 
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message 
from the President of the United 
States, together with an accompanying 
report; which was referred to the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622 (d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to the 
situation in Nicaragua declared in Ex-
ecutive Order 13851 of November 27, 
2018, is to continue in effect beyond No-
vember 27, 2021. 
The situation in Nicaragua, including 
the violent response by the Govern-
ment of Nicaragua to the protests that 
began on April 18, 2018, and the Ortega 
regime’s systematic dismantling and 
undermining of democratic institu-
tions and the rule of law, its use of in-
discriminate violence and repressive 
tactics against civilians, as well as its 
corruption leading to the destabiliza-
tion of Nicaragua’s economy, continues 
to pose an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and for-
eign policy of the United States. For 
this reason, I have determined that it 
is necessary to continue the national 
emergency declared in Executive Order 
13851 with respect to the situation in 
Nicaragua.

RESOLUTION 
447—CELE-
BRATING THE 125TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE NATIONAL GRAIN 
AND 
FEED 
ASSOCIATION 
AND 
RECOGNIZING THE ASSOCIATION 
AND ITS MEMBERS FOR TRANS-
FORMING 
THE 
BOUNTY 
OF 
UNITED STATES FARMERS INTO 
SAFE, 
NUTRITIOUS, 
SUSTAIN-
ABLE, AND AFFORDABLE HUMAN 
AND ANIMAL FOOD 
Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Mr. 
BOOZMAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, 
and Forestry: 
S. RES. 447 
Whereas, on November 9, 1896, a group of 38 
grain dealers gathered in Chicago, Illinois, 
to found the Grain Dealers National Associa-
tion, which in 1970, became the National 
Grain and Feed Association, to pursue ‘‘the 
advancement . . . of the common interests of 
those regularly engaged in the grain busi-
ness’’; 
Whereas the origin of the National Grain 
and Feed Association is rooted in 5 pressing 
needs faced by the grain and feed industry at 
the turn of the 19th century, including the 
need— 
(1) to establish a uniform system of grain 
inspection and grading; 
(2) to construct a procedure for settling 
trade disputes; 
(3) to improve rail grain transportation 
service; 
(4) to develop fair rules to govern the trad-
ing of grain and feedstuffs; and 
(5) to elevate the business practices of the 
industry; 
Whereas, in 1901, the National Grain and 
Feed Association formally established an ar-
bitration system, which is believed to be the 
oldest industry-based arbitration system in 
North America, to provide a cost-effective 
and timely mechanism to resolve disputes 
involving grain, feed, and barge transactions; 
Whereas, with 27 regional and State affili-
ated associations, the National Grain and 
Feed Association consists of more than 1,000 
grain, feed, processing, exporting, and other 
grain-related companies that operate ap-
proximately 8,000 facilities and handle the 
majority of all grains and oilseeds in the 
United States; 
Whereas the mission of the National Grain 
and Feed Association is to ‘‘advocate a glob-
al open market environment to efficiently 
produce and provide a safe, abundant, afford-
able, sustainable and wholesome supply of 
grain, oilseeds, feed and related products re-
sponsive to market demand’’; 
Whereas the National Grain and Feed As-
sociation fulfills its mission through rep-
resentation, employee safety and feed qual-
ity training, communication, development of 
future leaders, facilitation of the exchange 
of ideas, and education to members, govern-
ment, and the public; and 
Whereas the National Grain and Feed As-
sociation has advocated for the interests of 
individuals in the grain, feed, and processing 
industry with respect to the crafting, consid-
eration, and enactment of major legislation 
impacting the quality, standards, safety, and 
transportation of grains, oilseeds, and feed in 
the United States: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) celebrates the 125th anniversary of the 
National Grain and Feed Association; 
(2) recognizes the National Grain and Feed 
Association and its members for trans-
forming the bounty of United States farmers 
into safe, nutritious, sustainable, and afford-
able human and animal food; and 
(3) commends the National Grain and Feed 
Association for its longstanding and con-
tinuing efforts to advocate for grain, feed, 
and processing interests critical to the agri-
cultural value chain and the competitiveness 
of the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 448—DESIG-
NATING NOVEMBER 19, 2021, AS 
‘‘TSA APPRECIATION DAY’’ 
Mr. PETERS (for himself and Mr. 
PORTMAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 448 
Whereas November 19, 2021, marks the 20th 
anniversary of the signing of the Aviation 
and Transportation Security Act (Public 
Law 107–71; 115 Stat. 597) by President George 
W. Bush, creating the Transportation Secu-
rity Administration (commonly known as 
the ‘‘TSA’’); 
Whereas, after the terrorist attacks on 
September 11, 2001, the TSA was established 
with the mission to prevent similar attacks 
and restore confidence in air travel; 
Whereas, for 20 years, employees and offi-
cers of the TSA have been on the front lines 
ensuring safety in the skies and for the trav-
eling public; 
Whereas, during the COVID–19 pandemic, 
the TSA quickly adjusted its security oper-
ations in order to meet current and future 
security needs of transportation systems in 
the United States; 
Whereas, throughout the COVID–19 pan-
demic, the TSA has remained on the front 
lines at airports in the United States; 
Whereas more than 10,000 employees of the 
TSA have tested positive for COVID–19, and 
more than 30 employees of the TSA have lost 
their lives to COVID–19; and 
Whereas the people of the United States 
will continue to be able to rely upon the vig-
ilance of the TSA in the face of future un-
known threats: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 19, 2021, as ‘‘TSA 
Appreciation Day’’; and

SENATE RESOLUTION 449—DESIG-
NATING NOVEMBER 2021 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL COLLEGE APPLICATION 
MONTH’’ 
Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. SCOTT of 
South Carolina, Ms. ERNST, Mr. GRASS-
LEY, Mr. CARPER, Mr. CASEY, and Mr. 
VAN HOLLEN) submitted the following 
resolution; which was considered and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 449 
Whereas equality of opportunity for all 
people is one of the noblest aspirations of the 
United States; 
Whereas the United States has created 
shared economic growth and strengthened 
civic engagement through making higher 
education widely available; 
Whereas higher education enhances the 
economic mobility of individual students 
and their families, which is evidenced by— 
(1) a finding by the Brookings Institute 
that the median lifetime earnings of holders 
of an associate degree are uniformly greater 
than the median lifetime earnings of holders 
of solely a high school diploma; 
(2) a finding by the Pew Economic Mobility 
Project that, for an individual born in the 
lowest income quintile, obtaining a 4-year 
degree or a higher degree is associated 
with— 
(A) an approximately 70 percent dif-
ference in the probability of that indi-
vidual earning an income outside the low-
est income quintile; and 
(B) a threefold difference in the prob-
ability of that individual going on to earn 
an income in the highest income quintile; 
(3) the unemployment rate of high school 
graduates in 2020 who did not immediately 
matriculate to an institution of higher edu-
cation the following fall semester was 19.5 
percent, which has increased during the 
COVID–19 pandemic and was almost 3 times 
higher than the overall unemployment rate 
of the United States; and 
(4) the unemployment rate of adults whose 
highest credential is a high school diploma is 
almost double that of those with a bachelor’s 
degree; 
Whereas the National Student Clearing-
house reports that undergraduate enrollment 
in higher education has declined precipi-
tously since the beginning of the COVID–19 
pandemic, particularly for students in pov-
erty and students of color, as evidenced by— 
(1) 6.8 percent less high school graduates 
immediately matriculated to an institution 
of higher education the following fall semes-
ter in 2020, which represents a decline 4.5 
times greater than the decline from the prior 
year; 
(2) the decline described in paragraph (1) 
was most notable among graduates at high 
poverty high schools, who faced an 11.4 per-
cent decline from 2019 in immediate matricu-
lation to an institution of higher education; 
and 
(3) the decline described in paragraph (1) 
also disproportionately affected high school 
graduates 
at 
high 
minority 
population 
schools where college enrollment declined by 
9.4 percent from 2019, which represents a de-
cline 10 times greater than the decline from 
the prior year; 
Whereas the complexity of financial aid 
systems and rising college costs can serve as 
additional deterrents or barriers for students 
and families as they assess the viability of 
higher education programs as a postsec-
ondary option; 
Whereas many students and their families 
struggle to identify and compare postsec-
ondary options due to— 
(1) difficulties accessing school counseling 
services in high school, which is evidenced 
by an estimation of the American School 
Counselor Association that the student-to- 
counselor ratio in the United States is 424 to 
1; 
(2) an absence of reliable programmatic 
and institutional outcome data; and 
(3) a lack of comparable and understand-
able college financial aid offers; 
Whereas, in addition to expanding out-
reach and support to recent high school 
graduates, colleges and universities must 
also expand outreach and support to adults 
without a postsecondary degree or creden-
tial; 
Whereas the most recent data available 
from the National Postsecondary Student 
Aid Study commissioned by the National 
Center for Education Statistics found that, 
of undergraduate students in the United 
States— 
(1) approximately 27 percent are older than 
25 years of age; 
(2) 38 percent are enrolled part-time; 
(3) 24 percent are parents; and 
(4) 86 percent live off-campus; 
Whereas the National Center for Education 
Statistics highlights that completion of the 
Free Application for Federal Student Aid is 
one of the best predictors of immediate col-
lege enrollment, as high school seniors who 
complete the application are 84 percent more 
likely to begin postsecondary education in 
the fall following high school graduation; 
Whereas applications for State-based fi-
nancial aid are available in many States for 
students who do not qualify for Federal stu-
dent aid; and 
Whereas the ongoing impact of the COVID– 
19 pandemic on communities, families, and 
educational 
systems 
across 
the 
United 
States underscores and reinforces the value 
of ensuring that all individuals, including 
students enrolled in high school and working 
adults— 
(1) understand their postsecondary options; 
(2) understand college financing opportuni-
ties; and 
(3) have support to navigate the college ap-
plication and financial aid processes: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 2021 as ‘‘National 
College Application Month’’; 
(2) encourages the people of the United 
States to— 
(A) evaluate options for pursuing higher 
education; 
(B) submit a Free Application for Federal 
Student Aid or an appropriate application 
for State-based financial aid in order to re-
ceive college financing opportunities; and 
(C) support every student, regardless of the 
background, age, or resources of the student, 
in obtaining the skills and knowledge needed 
to thrive; 
(3) supports efforts to better assist and in-
crease opportunities for low-income, first- 
generation college students, and students of 
color, throughout the financial aid process, 
college application process, and beyond; 
(4) urges public officials, educators, fami-
lies, students, and communities in the 
United States to observe National College 
Application Month with appropriate activi-
ties and programs designed to encourage stu-

SENATE RESOLUTION 450—DESIG-
NATING NOVEMBER 17, 2021, AS 
‘‘NATIONAL GIS DAY’’ 
Mr. RISCH submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 450 
Whereas the management, use, and ex-
change 
of 
geographic 
information 
and 
geospatial data and analysis are essential for 
operations and decision making in Federal 
agencies; 
Whereas Geographic Information System 
technology (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘GIS’’) embraces new and innovative ways to 
use, discover, and share geospatial data 
through online portals and web services; 
Whereas GIS facilitates the sharing of geo-
graphic data, services, and maps within a 
digital domain; 
Whereas GIS helps provide shared and 
trusted geospatial data, services, and appli-
cations for use— 
(1) by the public; and 
(2) by government agencies and partners of 
government agencies to carry out the mis-
sions of such agencies and partners; 
Whereas GIS helps foster collaboration and 
partnerships to advance the National Spatial 
Data Infrastructure (referred to in this pre-
amble as the ‘‘NSDI’’); 
Whereas GIS provides a common frame-
work for the Federal Government and State, 
Tribal, and local governments, non-Federal 
partners, communities, constituents, and 
professional bodies for standards, data cata-
logs, partnerships, and tools that make up 
the NSDI; 
Whereas GIS is used to investigate and ad-
dress societal and cultural issues, includ-
ing— 
(1) local issues; 
(2) global issues; 
(3) issues from the past; 
(4) issues in the present; and 
(5) future issues identified through mod-
eling; 
Whereas GIS and related geospatial tech-
nologies are used in classrooms to engage 
students in science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics (STEM) learning; 
Whereas GIS is an interdisciplinary tool 
used by students, teachers, researchers, uni-
versities, local institutions, and practi-
tioners in numerous fields and disciplines; 
Whereas GIS fosters competition within 
the sector of geospatial technologies, which 
the Department of Labor considers to be a 
high-growth industry; and 
Whereas many Federal agencies, State and 
local government agencies, nonprofit organi-
zations, schools, libraries, and universities 
will join other persons around the world to 
showcase their GIS mapping and geospatial 
applications on November 17, 2021: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 17, 2021, as ‘‘Na-
tional GIS Day’’; and 
(2) encourages users of Geographic Infor-
mation System technology (referred to in 
this resolution as ‘‘GIS’’), educators, stu-
dents, and innovators to continue to employ 
GIS— 
(A) to learn and explore; 
(B) to analyze and address societal chal-
lenges; and 
(C) to drive economic growth for the bet-
terment of the people of the United States 
and individuals around the world.

SENATE RESOLUTION 452—RECOG-
NIZING NOVEMBER 2021 AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL 
HOMELESS 
CHILDREN 
AND 
YOUTH 
AWARENESS 
MONTH’’ 
Mr. MANCHIN (for himself, Ms. COL-
LINS, Mr. WYDEN, Ms. CANTWELL, Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, Mr. COONS, Mr. PETERS, Ms. 
HIRONO, Ms. KLOBUCHAR, Ms. HASSAN, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Ms. MURKOWSKI, Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, and Mr. REED) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 452 
Whereas, in the United States, public 
schools identified approximately 1,400,000 
homeless children and youth during the 2018– 
2019 school year; 
Whereas an estimated 1,300,000 children 
younger than 6 years of age in 2018–2019 and 
approximately 4,200,000 youth and young 
adults in 2017 experienced homelessness, with 
many such children, youth, and young adults 
staying on couches, in motels, in shelters, or 
outside; 
Whereas infants experiencing homelessness 
are at a higher risk for certain illnesses and 
health conditions, and families experiencing 
homelessness are more likely to experience 
involvement in the child welfare system and 
difficulty with school attendance; 
Whereas more than 1 in 3 high school stu-
dents experiencing homelessness had at-
tempted suicide, and nearly 1 in 4 high 
school students experiencing homelessness 
had experienced dating violence; 
Whereas individuals without a high school 
degree or general educational development 
certificate (GED) are more than 3 times 
more likely to report homelessness than 
their peers, making lack of education the 
leading risk factor for homelessness; 
Whereas, in 2018, the high school gradua-
tion rate for students experiencing homeless-
ness was 67.8 percent, compared to 80 percent 
for low-income students and 85.5 percent for 
all students; 
Whereas the rate of youth homelessness is 
the same in rural, suburban, and urban 
areas; 
Whereas 29 percent of unaccompanied 
homeless youth between 13 and 25 years of 
age have spent time in foster care, compared 
to approximately 6 percent of all children; 
Whereas homelessness among children and 
youth is a complex issue that often co-occurs 
with deep poverty, low education and em-
ployment 
levels, 
substance 
misuse 
and 
abuse, mental illness, lack of affordable 
housing, and family conflict; 
Whereas COVID–19 in the United States, 
which was declared a national emergency 
under the National Emergencies Act (50 
U.S.C. 1601 et seq.), has had a dispropor-
tionate effect on children, youth, and fami-
lies experiencing homelessness; and 
Whereas awareness of child and youth 
homelessness must be heightened to encour-
age greater support for effective programs to 
help children and youth overcome homeless-
ness: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the efforts of businesses, State 
and local governments, organizations, edu-
cators, and volunteers dedicated to meeting 
the needs of homeless children and youth;

SEC. 1433. REPORT ON STRATEGIC CRITICAL MIN-
ERAL 
AND 
DEFENSE 
MINERAL 
PRODUCTS RESERVE. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that the stor-
age of substantial quantities of critical min-
erals and defense mineral products will—

Congress that, in procuring critical minerals 
and defense mineral products, the Secretary 
of Defense should prioritize procurement of 
critical minerals and defense mineral prod-
ucts from sources in the United States, in-
cluding that are mined, produced, separated, 
and manufactured within the United States. 
(c) REPORT REQUIRED.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 270 days

requirements of the United States; and 
(C) including recommendations to diminish 
the vulnerability of the United States to dis-
ruptions in the supply chains for critical 
minerals

ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the end of title XII, add the following: 
Subtitle H—Iran Sanctions 
SEC. 1291. SHORT TITLE. 
This subtitle may be cited as the ‘‘Masih 
Alinejad Harassment and Unlawful Tar-
geting Act of 2021’’ or the ‘‘Masih Alinejad 
HUNT Act’’. 
SEC. 1292. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds that the Government of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran surveils, harasses, 
terrorizes, tortures, abducts, and murders in-
dividuals 
who 
peacefully 
defend 
human 
rights and freedoms in Iran, and innocent en-
tities and individuals considered by the Gov-
ernment of Iran to be enemies of that re-
gime, including United States citizens on 
United States soil, and takes foreign nation-
als hostage, including in the following in-
stances: 
(1) In 2021, Iranian intelligence agents were 
indicted for plotting to kidnap United States 
citizen, women’s rights activist, and jour-
nalist Masih Alinejad, from her home in New 
York City, in retaliation for exercising her 
rights under the First Amendment to the 
Constitution of the United States. Iranian 
agents allegedly spent at least approxi-
mately half a million dollars to capture the 
outspoken critic of the authoritarianism of 
the Government of Iran, and studied evacu-
ating her by military-style speedboats to 
Venezuela before rendition to Iran. 
(2) Prior to the New York kidnapping plot, 
Ms. Alinejad’s family in Iran was instructed 
by authorities to lure Ms. Alinejad to Tur-
key. In an attempt to intimidate her into si-
lence, the Government of Iran arrested 3 of 
Ms. Alinejad’s family members in 2019, and 
sentenced her brother to 8 years in prison for 
refusing to denounce her. 
(3) According to Federal prosecutors, the 
same Iranian intelligence network that al-
legedly plotted to kidnap Ms. Alinejad is 
also targeting critics of the Government of 
Iran who live in Canada, the United King-
dom, and the United Arab Emirates. 
(4) In 2021, an Iranian diplomat was con-
victed in Belgium of attempting to carry out 
a 2018 bombing of a dissident rally in France. 
(5) In 2021, a Danish high court found a 
Norwegian citizen of Iranian descent guilty 
of illegal espionage and complicity in a 
failed plot to kill an Iranian Arab dissident 
figure in Denmark. 
(6) In 2021, the British Broadcasting Cor-
poration (BBC) appealed to the United Na-
tions to protect BBC Persian employees in 
London who suffer regular harassment and 
threats of kidnapping by Iranian government 
agents. 
(7) In 2021, 15 militants allegedly working 
on behalf of the Government of Iran were ar-
rested in Ethiopia for plotting to attack citi-
zens of Israel, the United States, and the 
United Arab Emirates, according to United 
States officials. 
(8) In 2020, Iranian agents allegedly kid-
napped United States resident and Iranian- 
German journalist Jamshid Sharmahd, while 
he was traveling to India through Dubai. Ira-
nian authorities announced they had seized 
Mr. Sharmahd in ‘‘a complex operation’’, and 
paraded him blindfolded on state television. 
Mr. Sharmahd is arbitrarily detained in Iran, 
allegedly facing the death penalty. In 2009, 
Mr. Sharmahd was the target of an alleged 
Iran-directed assassination plot in Glendora, 
California. 
(9) In 2020, the Government of Turkey re-
leased counterterrorism files exposing how 
Iranian authorities allegedly collaborated 
with drug gangs to kidnap Habib Chabi, an 
Iranian-Swedish activist for Iran’s Arab mi-
nority. In 2020, the Government of Iran alleg-
edly lured Mr. Chabi to Istanbul through a 
female agent posing as a potential lover. Mr. 
Chabi was then allegedly kidnapped from 
Istanbul, and smuggled into Iran where he 
faces execution, following a sham trial. 
(10) In 2020, a United States-Iranian citizen 
and an Iranian resident of California pleaded 
guilty to charges of acting as illegal agents 
of the Government of Iran by surveilling 
Jewish 
student 
facilities, 
including 
the 
Hillel Center and Rohr Chabad Center at the 
University 
of 
Chicago, 
in 
addition 
to 
surveilling and collecting identifying infor-
mation about United States citizens and na-
tionals who are critical of the Iranian re-
gime. 
(11) In 2019, 2 Iranian intelligence officers 
at the Iranian consulate in Turkey allegedly 
orchestrated the assassination of Iranian dis-
sident journalist Masoud Molavi Vardanjani, 
who was shot while walking with a friend in 
Istanbul. Unbeknownst to Mr. Molavi, his 
‘‘friend’’ was in fact an undercover Iranian 
agent and the leader of the killing squad, ac-
cording to a Turkish police report. 
(12) In 2019, around 1,500 people were alleg-
edly killed amid a less than 2 week crack-
down by security forces on anti-government 
protests across Iran, including at least an al-
leged 23 children and 400 women. 
(13) In 2019, Iranian operatives allegedly 
lured 
Paris-based 
Iranian 
journalist 
Ruhollah Zam to Iraq, where he was ab-
ducted, and hanged in Iran for sedition. 
(14) In 2019, a Kurdistan regional court con-
victed an Iranian female for trying to lure 
Voice of America reporter Ali Javanmardi to 
a hotel room in Irbil, as part of a foiled Ira-
nian intelligence plot to kidnap and extra-
dite Mr. Javanmardi, a critic of the Govern-
ment of Iran. 
(15) In 2019, Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion agents visited the rural Connecticut 
home of Iran-born United States author and 
poet Roya Hakakian to warn her that she 
was the target of an assassination plot or-
chestrated by the Government of Iran. 
(16) In 2019, the Government of Denmark 
accused the Government of Iran of directing 
the assassination of Iranian Arab activist 
Ahmad Mola Nissi, in The Hague, and the as-
sassination of another opposition figure, 
Reza Kolahi Samadi, who was murdered near 
Amsterdam in 2015. 
(17) 
In 
2018, 
German 
security 
forces 
searched for 10 alleged spies who were work-
ing for Iran’s al-Quds Force to collect infor-
mation on targets related to the local Jewish 
community, including kindergartens. 
(18) In 2017, Germany convicted a Pakistani 
man for working as an Iranian agent to spy 
on targets including a former German law-
maker and a French-Israeli economics pro-
fessor. 
(19) In 2012, an Iranian American pleaded 
guilty to conspiring with members of the 
Iranian military to bomb a popular Wash-
ington, D.C., restaurant with the aim of as-
sassinating the ambassador of Saudi Arabia 
to the United States. 
(20) In 1996, agents of the Government of 
Iran allegedly assassinated 5 Iranian dis-
sident exiles across Turkey, Pakistan, and 
Baghdad, over a 5-month period that year. 
(21) In 1992, the Foreign and Common-
wealth Office of the United Kingdom ex-
pelled 2 Iranians employed at the Iranian 
Embassy in London and a third Iranian on a

(23) In 1992, singer, actor, poet, and gay Ira-
nian dissident Fereydoun Farrokhzad was

Federal Bureau of Investigation had identi-
fied the ‘‘mailman’’ as Dawud Salahuddin, 
born 
David 
Theodore 
Belfield. 
Mr. 
Salahuddin was working as a security guard

ment of Iran to kill Mr. Tabatabaei.

campaign of intimidation both in the virtual

racy, justice, and gender equality pose to 
their rule.

72 hours from the date on which the Director 
made the request for information in sub-
section (b), the Director has received no re-
sponse from the entity from which such in-
formation was requested, or received an in-
adequate response, the Director may issue to 
such entity a subpoena to compel disclosure 
of information the Director deems necessary 
to determine whether a covered cyber inci-
dent or ransom payment has occurred and 
obtain the information required to be re-
ported pursuant to section 2232 and any im-
plementing regulations.

ordered to lie on the table; as follows: 
At the appropriate place in title X, insert 
the following: 
SEC. lll. VETERANS CYBERSECURITY AND DIG-
ITAL LITERACY GRANT PROGRAM. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) Adversaries from Russia, China, and 
Iran are using information warfare to influ-
ence democracies across the world, and ex-
tremist organizations often use digital com-
munications to recruit members. Influence 
campaigns from foreign adversaries reached 
tens of millions of voters during the 2016 and 
2018 elections with racially and divisively 
targeted messages. The Unites States can 
fight these influences by ensuring that citi-
zens of the United States possess the nec-
essary skills to discern disinformation and 
misinformation and protect themselves from 
foreign influence campaigns. 
(2) Researchers have documented per-
sistent, pervasive, and coordinated online 
targeting of members of the Armed Forces, 
veterans, and their families by foreign adver-
saries seeking to undermine United States 
democracy in part because of public trust 
placed in these communities. 
(3) A 2017 report by the University of Ox-
ford’s Graphika Institute, titled ‘‘Social 
Media Disinformation Campaigns Against 
US Military Personnel and Veterans’’, con-
cluded that ‘‘The pubic tends to place trust 
in military personnel and veterans, making 
them potentially influential voters and com-
munity leaders. Given this trust and their 
role in ensuring national security, these in-
dividuals have the potential to become par-
ticular targets for influence operations and 
information campaigns conducted on social 
media. There are already reports of US serv-
ice personnel being confronted by foreign in-
telligence agencies while posted abroad, with 
details of their personal lives gleaned from 
social media.’’. 
(4) The Select Committee on Intelligence 
of the Senate found in its investigation of 
the interference in the 2016 election that so-
cial media posts by the Internet Research 
Agency (IRA) of Russia reached tens of mil-
lions of voters in 2016 and were meant to pit 
the people of the United States against one 
another and sow discord. Volume II of the 
Committee’s investigation found that the 
Internet Research Agency’s Instagram ac-
count with the second largest reach used the 
handle 
‘‘@american.veterans’’ 
and 
was 
‘‘aimed at patriotic, conservative audiences, 
collected 215,680 followers, and generated 
nearly 18.5 million engagements.’’. 
(5) A 2019 investigative report by the Viet-
nam Veterans of America (VVA) titled ‘‘An 
Investigation into Foreign Entities who are 
Targeting Troops and Veterans Online’’, 
found that the Internet Research Agency 
targeted veterans and the followers of sev-
eral congressionally chartered veterans serv-
ice organizations with at least 113 advertise-
ments during and following the 2016 election 
and that ‘‘this represents a fraction of the 
Russian activity that targeted this commu-
nity with divisive propaganda.’’. The report 
also found that foreign actors have been im-
personating veterans through social-media 
accounts and interacting with veterans and 
veterans groups on social media to spread 
propaganda and disinformation. To counter 
these acts, Vietnam Veterans of America 
recommended that the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs ‘‘immediately develop plans to 
make the cyber-hygiene of veterans an ur-
gent priority within the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs. The VA must educate and 
train veterans on personal cybersecurity: 
how to mitigate vulnerabilities, vigilantly 
maintain 
safe 
practices, 
and 
recognize 
threats, including how to identify instances 
of online manipulation.’’. 
(6) The Cyberspace Solarium Commission, 
a bicameral and bipartisan commission, es-
tablished by section 1652 of the John S. 
McCain National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115–232), 
concluded in its finished report that the 
‘‘U.S. government should promote digital lit-
eracy, civics education, and public awareness 
to build societal resilience to foreign, malign 
cyber-enabled information operations and 
that the U.S. government must ensure that 
individual Americans have both the digital 
literacy tools and the civics education they 
need to secure their networks and their de-
mocracy from cyber-enabled information op-
erations.’’. The report recommended that 
Congress authorizing grant programs to do 
this. 
(b) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that, given the threat foreign influ-
ence campaigns pose for United States de-
mocracy and the findings and recommenda-
tions of Congress and experts, Congress must 
immediately act to pass legislative measures

SEC. llll. REASONABLE, NON-DISCRIMINA-
TORY ACCESS TO ONLINE COMMU-
NICATIONS PLATFORMS; BLOCKING 
AND SCREENING OF OFFENSIVE MA-
TERIAL. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Part I of title II of the

seq.) is amended—

ACCESS TO ONLINE COMMUNICA-
TIONS PLATFORMS; BLOCKING AND

‘‘(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the fol-
lowing: 
‘‘(1) The rapidly developing array of inter-
net and other interactive computer services 
available to individual Americans represent 
an extraordinary advance in the availability 
of educational and informational resources 
to our citizens. 
‘‘(2) These services often offer users a great 
degree of control over the information that 
they receive, as well as the potential for 
even greater control in the future as tech-
nology continues to develop. 
‘‘(3) The internet and other interactive 
computer services offer a forum for a true di-
versity of political discourse and viewpoints, 
unique opportunities for cultural develop-
ment, and myriad avenues for intellectual 
activity, and regulation of the internet must 
be tailored to supporting those activities. 
‘‘(4) The internet and other interactive 
computer services have flourished, to the 
benefit of all Americans, with a minimum of 
government 
regulation, 
and 
regulation 
should be limited to what is necessary to 
preserve the societal benefits provided by 
the internet. 
‘‘(5) Increasingly Americans rely on inter-
net platforms and websites for a variety of 
political, educational, cultural, and enter-
tainment services and for communication 
with one another. 
‘‘(b) POLICY.—It is the policy of the United 
States— 
‘‘(1) to promote the continued development 
of the internet and other interactive com-
puter services and other interactive media; 
‘‘(2) to preserve a vibrant and competitive 
free market for the internet and other inter-
active computer services; 
‘‘(3) to encourage the development of tech-
nologies which maximize user control over 
what information is received by individuals, 
families, and schools who use the internet 
and other interactive computer services, 
rather than control and censorship driven by 
interactive computer services; 
‘‘(4) to facilitate the development and uti-
lization of blocking and filtering tech-
nologies that empower parents to restrict 
their children’s access to objectionable or in-
appropriate online material; 
‘‘(5)(A) to ensure that the internet serves 
as an open forum for— 
‘‘(i) a true diversity of discourse and view-
points, including political discourse and 
viewpoints; 
‘‘(ii) unique opportunities for cultural de-
velopment; and 
‘‘(iii) myriad avenues for intellectual ac-
tivity; and 
‘‘(B) given that the internet is the domi-
nant platform for communication and public 
debate today, to ensure that major internet 
communications platforms, which function 
as common carriers in terms of their size, 
usage, and necessity, are available to all 
users on reasonable and non-discriminatory 
terms free from public or private censorship 
of religious and political speech; 
‘‘(6) to promote consumer protection and 
transparency regarding information and con-
tent management practices by major inter-
net platforms to— 
‘‘(A) ensure that consumers understand— 
‘‘(i) the products they are using; and 
‘‘(ii) what information is being presented 
to them and why; and 
‘‘(B) prevent deceptive or undetectable ac-
tions that filter the information presented to 
consumers; and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S8288 
November 16, 2021 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. 
lll. 
INCREASING 
THE 
CAPACITY 
OF 
STATES AND PARTNER COUNTRIES 
TO 
COUNTER 
CORRUPTION 
AND 
MONEY LAUNDERING SCHEMES RE-
LATED TO DRUG TRAFFICKING. 
(a) SHORT
TITLE.—This section may be 
cited as the ‘‘Not Allowing Revenue for 
Criminal Organizations Act’’ or ‘‘NARCO 
Act’’. 
(b) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) 
Drug 
trafficking 
organizations, 
transnational criminal organizations, and 
money laundering organizations prey upon 
individuals suffering from substance use dis-
orders and exploit the financial systems of 
the United States to sustain their criminal 
enterprises. 
(2) The illicit drug trade in the United 
States 
is 
conservatively 
valued 
at 
$150,000,000,000 annually, making it worth 
more than the gross domestic product of ap-
proximately 150 countries. 
(3) More than 93,000 individuals in the 
United States died from drug overdoses in 
2020. 
(4) 
Drug 
trafficking 
organizations, 
transnational criminal organizations, and 
money laundering organizations perpetuate 
crime, corruption, and kleptocracy, which 
undermines the rule of law and erodes demo-
cratic institutions in foreign countries while 
threatening the national security of the 
United States. 
(5) Understanding and attacking the finan-
cial networks, both in the United States and 
abroad, that enable drug trafficking organi-
zations, transnational criminal organiza-
tions, and money laundering organizations is 
critical to disrupting and dismantling those 
organizations. 
(6) As such, the national drug control 
strategy of the United States should include 
an explicit focus, goals, and metrics related 
to mapping, tracking, attacking, and dis-
mantling the financial networks of drug traf-
ficking organizations, transnational crimi-
nal organizations, and money laundering or-
ganizations. 
(7) Uniform application of anti-money 
laundering laws and information sharing will 
enhance the ability of the Federal Govern-
ment and State governments to dismantle 
drug trafficking organizations, transnational 
criminal organizations, and money laun-
dering organizations. 
(8) The Financial Action Task Force estab-
lishes international standards that aim to 
prevent money laundering associated with 
the illicit drug trade and other illegal activi-
ties, and is supported by more than 200 im-
plementing countries and jurisdictions, in-
cluding the United States. In its 2016 Mutual 
Evaluation Report of the United States, the 
Task Force found that while Federal law en-
forcement 
agencies 
aggressively 
target 
money laundering cases, ‘‘State law enforce-
ment authorities can complement Federal 
efforts, but more typically pursue State- 
level law enforcement priorities. Among the 
States, there is no uniform approach and lit-
tle data is available. Where information was 
provided, it tended to suggest that [money 
laundering] is not prioritised by the State 
authorities.’’. 
(9) It is in the best national security inter-
est of the United States to increase the ca-
pacity of States and partner countries to 
identify, investigate, and prosecute corrup-
tion and money laundering schemes that di-
rectly benefit drug trafficking organizations, 
transnational criminal organizations, and 
money laundering organizations. 
(c) GAO REPORT.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Not later than 2 years 
after the date of enactment of this Act, and 
annually thereafter, the Comptroller Gen-
eral of the United States shall submit to the 
Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, 
the Caucus on International Narcotics Con-
trol of the Senate, the Committee on the Ju-
diciary of the House of Representatives, and 
the Director of National Drug Control Policy 
an assessment of— 
(A) the number and status of investiga-
tions and prosecutions across National Drug 
Control Program agencies (as defined in sec-
tion 702 of the Office of National Drug Con-
trol Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 (21 
U.S.C. 1701)) with a drug trafficking and 
money laundering and illicit finance nexus, 
unless the disclosure of such information 
would reveal information protected by rule 
6(e) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Proce-
dure or a court order; and 
(B) the amount of money and other things 
of value in various forms, including tangible 
and digital assets, and property criminally 
seized by or forfeited to the Federal Govern-
ment on an annual basis from individuals as-
sociated with drug trafficking, drug traf-
ficking organizations, transnational crimi-
nal organizations, or money laundering orga-
nizations, which shall be— 
(i) adjusted to eliminate duplication in the 
case of seizures or forfeitures carried out and 
reported by multiple agencies; and 
(ii) disaggregated by agency. 
(2) CLASSIFIED
ANNEX.—The Comptroller 
General may provide the assessment under 
paragraph (1), or a portion thereof, in a clas-
sified annex if necessary. 
(d) TECHNICAL UPDATES TO OFFICE OF NA-
TIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY REAUTHORIZA-
TION ACT OF 1998.— 
(1) DEFINITION
OF ‘‘SUPPLY
REDUCTION’’.— 
Section 702(17) of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 
(21 U.S.C. 1701(17)) is amended— 
(A) by redesignating subparagraphs (G) and

tively; and 
(B) by inserting after subparagraph (F) the 
following: 
‘‘(G) activities to map, track, dismantle,

dering organizations involved in the manu-
facture and trafficking of drugs in the

tained and robust funding to carry out this 
important work, which is essential to our 
ability to project United States leadership

ment before conflicts break out saves Amer-
ican lives while also being cost-effective; and 
(11) the contributions of personnel working 
at the Department and USAID are extraor-
dinarily valuable and allow the United 
States to maintain its leadership around the 
world.

have 
made 
significant 
contributions

ed by adding at the end the following new 
sentences: ‘‘Such right and process shall en-
sure that any employee subjected to an as-
signment restriction or preclusion shall have

subject matter expertise and professional 
skills to the successful development and exe-
cution of United States foreign policy; and 
(2) reemployment of skilled former mem-
bers of the Foreign and civil service who 
have voluntarily separated from the Foreign 
or civil service due to family reasons or to 
obtain professional skills outside govern-
ment is of benefit to the Department.

(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS ON SPECIAL ACTIV-
ITY
AIRSPACE
SCHEDULING
AND
MANAGE-
MENT.—It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) where it does not conflict with safety, 
dynamic scheduling and management of spe-
cial activity airspace (also referred to as 
‘‘dynamic airspace’’) is expected to optimize 
the use of the national airspace system for 
all stakeholders; and 
(2) the Administrator of the Federal Avia-
tion Administration and the Secretary of De-
fense should take such actions as may be 
necessary to support ongoing efforts to de-
velop dynamic scheduling and management 
of special activity airspace, including— 
(A) the continuation of formal partner-
ships between the Federal Aviation Adminis-
tration and the Department of Defense that 
focus on special activity airspace, future air-
space needs, and joint solutions; and 
(B) maturing research within their feder-
ally funded research and development cen-
ters, Federal partner agencies, and the avia-
tion community. 
(b) PILOT PROGRAM.— 
(1) PILOT
PROGRAM
REQUIRED.—Not later 
than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal

lish a pilot program on developing and test-
ing dynamic management of special activity 
airspace in order to accommodate emerging 
military 
training 
requirements 
through 
flexible scheduling, along with increasing ac-
cess to existing special activity airspace 
used by the Department of Defense for test 
and training. 
(2) TESTING OF SPECIAL ACTIVITY AIRSPACE 
SCHEDULING
AND
MANAGEMENT.—Under the 
pilot program established under paragraph 
(1), the Administrator and the Secretary 
shall jointly test not fewer than three areas

(A) at least one shall be over coastal 
waters of the United States; 
(B) at least two shall be over land of the 
United States; 
(C) access to airspace available for test and 
training is increased to accommodate dy-
namic scheduling of existing airspace to 
more efficiently and realistically provide 
test and training capabilities to Department 
of Defense aircrews; and 
(D) any increase in access to airspace made 
available for test and training shall not con-
flict with the safe management of the na-
tional airspace system or the safety of all 
stakeholders of the national airspace sys-
tem. 
(c) REPORT BY THE ADMINISTRATOR.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Not less than two years 
after the date of the establishment of the 
pilot program under subsection (b)(1), the

f 
U.S. SUPREME COURT 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
rise today for now the ninth time to 
unmask the rightwing, dark money 
scheme to capture our Supreme Court. 
I say ‘‘capture’’ in the sense of regu-
latory capture, an Agency capture—a 
well-known phenomenon. 
Today, I turn to an important tool of 
the scheme’s apparatus: the orches-
trated amicus curiae brief. 
So, first things first, amicus—or 
friend of the court—briefs are an im-
portant instrument in our judicial sys-
tem. They help those who aren’t par-
ties to a case to share their expertise, 
insight, or advocacy with the Court. I 
file them myself. ‘‘Friend of the court’’ 
briefs are necessary and useful, usu-
ally. 
However, in recent years, the Court 
has had a lot more friends than it used 
to. Amici filed 781 briefs in the 2014 Su-
preme Court term—a more than 800- 
percent increase from the 1950s and a 
95-percent increase just from 1995. In 
the 2010 term, 715 amicus briefs were 
filed in 78 cases. By 2019, that number 
had swelled to 911 briefs in just 57 
cases. The average number of briefs per 
argued case almost doubled—from 9 in 
2010 to 16 in 2019. 
There is another odd feature to this 
uptick of amicus briefs. Most of the 
time, you file an amicus brief when the 
Justices have taken a case and are 
poised to actually decide the outcome 
of that case, at the so-called merits 
stage of the case, which makes sense 
because this is when the rulings actu-
ally become law. But these days, more 
and more amici arrive when the Court 
considers whether to take up the case, 
when the Justices are deciding whether 
to grant certiorari, or cert. Between 
1982 and 2014, the percentage of peti-
tions with at least one cert-stage ami-
cus more than doubled. 
Justices pay attention to amicus 
briefs. The Court cited amicus briefs 
606 times in 417 opinions from 2008 to 
2013—far more than in the past. These 
briefs don’t always add value, and top 
appellate judges are beginning to sound 
that alarm. 
Seventh 
Circuit 
Judge 
Michael 
Scudder said in 2020: ‘‘Too many ami-
cus briefs do not even pretend to offer 
value and instead merely repeat . . . a 
party’s position’’ and ‘‘serve only as a 
show of hands on what interest groups 
are rooting for what outcome.’’ 
OK. So what does this have to do 
with the scheme? 
Well, what happens if the Justices 
whom dark money forces ushered onto 
the Court are looking for that show of 
hands? 
I doubt it is just a coincidence that 
the rightwing donor machine that set 
out to capture the Court has also 
kicked into gear flotillas of amici that

inundate the Court with briefs, sig-
naling their desire for a certain out-
come—a showing of hands that is or-
chestrated. 
Now, the scheme is, by design, hard 
to make out. It runs on anonymous 
dark money for a reason. It works 
through front groups, some with mul-
tiple fictitious names. It works hard 
and spends plenty to hide its hand. 
Still, look carefully, and the scheme’s 
hand is there to see. Like eddies swirl-
ing the water’s surface as a creature 
moves beneath, signs of rightwing 
donor influence swirl around the Court. 
One of the strongest signs is that 
there is a pattern—a pattern of success 
when orchestrated flotillas of dark 
money amici, funded by a small num-
ber of wealthy rightwing donors, show 
up: they win. This Court, the Court 
that dark money built, delivers in their 
favor. Exhibit A is probably the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce, where the idea 
for this scheme first bubble up years 
ago with the Powell memo. 
Over the past 15 years or so, the 
chamber has filed more amicus briefs 
at the Supreme Court than almost any-
one else and has gotten its preferred re-
sult 70 percent of the time. And no one 
knows what company or what interest 
the chamber may be fronting for. That 
is hidden from the Court and from the 
other parties. 
The chamber can even hide if one of 
its members wrote or funded the cham-
ber’s amicus brief in that member’s 
own case. So the members of the party 
and the chamber on behalf of the mem-
ber file an amicus brief, and no one is 
the wiser. 
So it is no surprise that the chamber 
is trying very hard to block the Judi-
cial Conference from bringing more 
transparency and daylight into the 
funding of these amicus briefs. 
It is not just the chamber in this 
deep racket here. If you take the re-
cent 
anti-union 
cases—Janus 
v. 
AFSCME, Cedar Point Nursery v. Has-
sid, and Freidrichs v. California Teach-
ers Association, each case drew 10 or 
more amicus filers connected to these 
scheme donors. 
In both Freidrichs and Janus, scheme 
megadonor the Bradley Foundation 
funded the law groups representing the 
anti-union plaintiffs and also funded a 
dozen supporting amici. The front 
groups even swapped seats with a group 
representing plaintiffs in one case, 
turning up as an amicus in the other 
case and vice versa. It is a front-group, 
pea-and-shell game that the Court, for 
some reason, indulges. It is no surprise 
that all of these cases delivered big 
wins for corporate interests out to 
weaken organized labor. 
Or you could look at the scheme’s at-
tack on the Consumer Financial Pro-
tection Bureau. The CFPB has long 
been a target of rightwing interests. 
The Center for Media and Democracy 
reported that 16—16—rightwing founda-
tions, including the Bradley Founda-
tion and Donors Trust, had donated al-
most $70 million to 11 amici who op-
posed the Consumer Financial Protec-
tion Bureau. 
I did a brief in that case, an amicus 
brief of my own, and I put this graphic 
in my amicus brief as an appendix to 
show the Court the common funding of 
all of these groups that purported to 
come in as independent, unassociated 
amicus filers. 
So here are the donors across the 
top—Donors Trust, Bradley Founda-
tion, Scaife Foundation, Searle Trust, 
Charles Koch Foundation, Kirby Foun-
dation, and the DONNA Foundation— 
and here are the groups that filed 
briefs. Every single one got money 
from Donors Trust, which is called the 
Koch brothers’ ATM. It is the entity 
that hides who the real donor is, and it 
just shows up as Donors Trust. 
Here is the Bradley Foundation—all 
but one, two, three. Here is the Scaife 
Foundation—all but one, two, three, 
four, five, and so on. So there is an 
enormous amount of overlap that I was 
able to figure out, as pointed out in my 
brief, and then the Center for Media 
and Democracy came through with a 
more complete report and did an even 
better job of researching that. 
So 
remember 
from 
my 
previous 
speeches how it was the Federalist So-
ciety that was home to the dark money 
turnstile that selected all three of 
Trump’s Supreme Court appointees. 
Eleven amici supporting the challenge 
to the CFPB received funding from en-
tities that also funded the Federalist 
Society. So it is a pea-and-shell game 
of funded amici with a lot of shells. 
And then there is the biggest scheme 
case of them all. You might call it the 
scheme-a-palooza. The case was called 
Americans for Prosperity Foundation 
v. Bonta. In this case, more than 50 
dark money organizations filed amicus 
briefs at the cert stage, when the ques-
tion is, Do we take the case, before it 
is even being argued on the merits? 
Fifty dark money groups appeared at 
the cert stage, and another 45 turned 
up at the merit stage, all to support 
the Americans for Prosperity Founda-
tion, which you will recognize as the 
Koch-backed twin to Americans for 
Prosperity, which is the front group at 
the heart of the Koch brothers’ polit-
ical operation. It is the center of the 
rightwing political dark money web. 
Essentially, the Americans for Pros-
perity Foundation and Americans for 
Prosperity are the same organization. 
In 
current, 
state-of-the-art, 
dark 
money politics, you twin a 501(c)(3) and 
a 501(c)(4) and work them as a pair. 
Sure enough, if you look at Ameri-
cans for Prosperity and Americans for 
Prosperity 
Foundation, 
they 
share 
quite a lot. They share the exact same 
address, for instance: 1310 North Court-
house Road, Suite 700, Arlington, VA. 
They share the same CEO. They share 
the same senior vice president of grass-
roots in Americans for Prosperity and 
senior vice president for State oper-
ations in Americans for Prosperity 
Foundation. They share the same sen-
ior vice president of policy. They share 
the same chairman of the board. They 
share the same president. If you were 
to do a piercing of the corporate veil 
analysis, you would be hard-pressed to 
show that these are not essentially the 
same organization. 
And that armada of amici that came 
into the Americans for Prosperity 
Foundation case, all of them received 
funding from the Koch political net-
work or the Koch identity laundering 
group, Donors Trust. 
At least eleven prominent rightwing 
groups gave close to $222 million, 
spread across 69 of those amici who 
came in to support their fellow Ameri-
cans for Prosperity Foundation. 
If the little flotillas of a dozen or so 
in the CFPB case and in the anti-labor 
cases were sending a signal to the 
Court, this turnout was a screaming 
alarm—a megaphone—in the Court’s 
face. 
So what made the AFPF case such a 
big deal for the scheme? Well, this case 
gave ‘‘the Court that dark money 
built’’ an opportunity to do something 
that dark money donors desperately 
wanted. It gave the Court the oppor-
tunity to create for the dark money do-
nors a new constitutional right—a new 
constitutional right to dark money, 
the essential political weapon for the 
scheme. And the Court did it. The Re-
publican Justices, six to three, did it. 
‘‘The Court that dark money built’’ 
struck down a State rule requiring lim-
ited disclosure of nonprofit donor infor-
mation from a very political nonprofit 
and went on to cast a shadow of doubt 
on the constitutionality of disclosure 
requirements of any kind. 
The amicus mischief at the Court 
continues. Look at the gun case before 
the Court right now, New York State 
Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen. 
This case is priority No. 1 for the NRA 
and its gun industry backers. It has 
been a centerpiece of the scheme for a 
very long time to have the Court cre-
ate gun rights that even a Republican 
Congress won’t give to the firearms in-
dustry. So in this case, the amicus sig-
nal flags are flying. 
Sixty-five organizations filed briefs 
supporting the NRA affiliate 
that 
brought the challenge. At least 13 of 
those groups have ties to the scheme’s 
dark money funding network. 
Several amici are arms of other 
amici; that is, the fundraising or lob-
bying arm of an organization that 
itself also filed a brief in the case. At 
least five amici are NRA affiliates, and 
they were joined by the NRA’s ‘‘Civil 
Rights Defense Fund.’’ And, believe it 
or not, thanks to leaks by Russian 
hackers, we have seen that the NRA 
paid a lawyer at one of the amicus 
groups hundreds of thousands of dollars 
to file pro-NRA briefs in this case, none 
of which was disclosed to the Court, 
none of which was disclosed to the par-
ties, none of which was disclosed to the 
public. It took Russian hackers to find 
out that the NRA was funneling money 
to an amicus for a brief. 
Well, it seems like the Justices got 
the signal from all of those dark-

money-funded amici. Based on ques-
tioning from the Court Republicans at 
oral argument, this case looks almost 
certain to go in the scheme’s favor. 
Pause to consider what this means. 
The NRA basically cloned itself to am-
plify its voice before the Court, just as 
other scheme front groups have done in 
other cases, in wave upon orchestrated 
wave of amicus briefs, washing into the 
cases that matter to the scheme’s big 
donors. 
And when those little orchestrated 
flotillas or the big orchestrated arma-
das show up at the Court to signal 
what they want, they always get what 
they want from the dark money major-
ity at the Court—always. Maybe not 
all they want always—some groups ask 
for more than others. Some signal 
where they want the Court to go in fu-
ture cases, not just what they want in 
this case. But the response from the 
Republicans on ‘‘the Court that dark 
money built’’ is clear. They heed the 
dark money signals every single time. 
Our Supreme Court is awash in dark 
money influence, with flotillas of dark- 
money-funded 
front 
groups—front 
groups that don’t bother to ‘‘offer 
value,’’ that aren’t even real, in the 
sense that they have no real business 
or function, that exist merely to signal 
their donors’ desired outcomes, while 
hiding their donors’ identities. 
It is an armada of fakery that the 
court indulges. This fakery lets a 
small, wealthy, donor elite manufac-
ture sham allies to get themselves a 
bigger say at the Supreme Court than 
everyone else. They are out to get the 
Court to do stuff for them that Ameri-
cans don’t want and that Congress 
won’t vote for. But with a captured 
Court, they can get what they want, 
and they do. 
The American people may not be able 
to see all of the rot, but they can see 
enough to know that something is rot-
ten over there across First Street at 
that Court. We must set it right.

November 16, 2021, by the President of 
the United States: Amendment to Mon-
treal Protocol ‘‘Kigali Amendment,’’ 
Treaty Document No. 117–1. I further 
ask that the treaty be considered as 
having been read the first time; that it 
be referred, with accompanying papers, 
to the Committee on Foreign Relations 
and ordered to be printed; and that the 
President’s message be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The message of the President is as 
follows: 
To the Senate of the United States: 
With a view to receiving the advice 
and consent of the Senate to ratifica-
tion, I transmit herewith the Amend-
ment to the Montreal Protocol on Sub-
stances that Deplete the Ozone Layer 
(the ‘‘Montreal Protocol’’), adopted at 
Kigali on October 15, 2016, by the Twen-
ty-Eighth Meeting of the Parties to the 
Montreal Protocol (the ‘‘Kigali Amend-
ment’’). The report of the Department 
of State is also enclosed for the infor-
mation of the Senate. 
The principal features of the Kigali 
Amendment provide for a gradual 
phasedown in the production and con-
sumption 
of 
hydrofluorocarbons 
(HFCs), 
which 
are 
alternatives 
to 
ozone-depleting 
substances 
being 
phased out under the Montreal Pro-
tocol, as well as related provisions con-
cerning reporting, licensing, control of 
trade with non-Parties, and control of 
certain byproduct emissions. 
The United States has sufficient do-
mestic authority to implement obliga-
tions under the Kigali Amendment, in-
cluding through the American Innova-
tion and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (the 
‘‘AIM Act’’) and the Clean Air Act. The 
Environmental Protection Agency’s re-
cent rulemakings under the AIM Act 
establish a domestic HFC allocation 
system and other provisions that would 
enable the United States to begin im-
plementation of the provisions of the 
Kigali Amendment. 
The Kigali Amendment has strong 
support from the U.S. business commu-
nity and nongovernmental organiza-
tions. 
Ratification 
by 
the 
United 
States would advance U.S. interests in 
remaining a leader in the development 
and deployment of HFC alternatives, 
ensuring access to rapidly growing re-
frigeration and cooling markets over-
seas and stimulating U.S. investment, 
exports, and job growth in this sector. 
Ratification 
will 
also 
ensure 
the 
United States continues to have a full 
voice to represent U.S. economic and 
environmental interests as implemen-
tation of the Kigali Amendment moves 
forward in coming years. 
The Kigali Amendment entered into 
force on January 1, 2019, and there are 
currently 124 Parties to the Amend-
ment. The Senate has given its advice 
and consent to ratification of all four 
previous amendments to the Montreal 
Protocol, with bipartisan support. I 
recommend that the Senate give favor-
able 
consideration 
to 
the 
Kigali 
Amendment and give its advice and 
consent to ratification at the earliest 
date.

CELEBRATING THE 108TH BIRTH-
DAY OF CALHOUN COUNTY NA-
TIVE AND LONG-TIME MALVERN 
RESIDENT, 
EDNA 
RAYBORN 
REGAN 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the 108th birthday of Fourth 
District native and longtime resident, Mrs. 
Edna Rayborn Regan. Mrs. Regan spent her 
birthday celebrating the special occasion in 
the company of her friends and family. 
Born on November 2, 1913, in Calhoun 
County, Mrs. Regan attended school at 
Bearden High School where she graduated in 
1932. Later, in 1938, she married John Doug-
las, with whom she shares two sons, three 
grandchildren, and five great grandchildren. 
Throughout the years, Mrs. Regan has main-
tained high spirits and fierce independence, 
driving until she was 97 and living in her home 
until she was 100. Early on, Mrs. Regan de-
veloped an interest in history, which led to her 
taking on the role of historian in her family. 
She is able to trace her family’s lineage back 
several generations without the aid of com-
puters. Thanks to her tireless efforts, her fam-
ily was able to travel and visit their early an-
cestral home, which would have never been 
possible without her determination. 
She has since created binders full of stories, 
pictures, and history to ensure that her family 
will always cherish from where they came. In 
Mrs. Regan’s spare time, you will rarely find 
her in her room at her assisted living facility. 
She enjoys visiting with friends, writing poetry 
and painting. I take this time today to ask that 
our Nation join me in wishing Mrs. Edna 
Rayborn Regan a happy 108th birthday.

HONORING THE ROTARY CLUB OF 
VALLEJO 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the Rotary Club 
of Vallejo as it celebrates its 100th year anni-
versary. 
The Rotary Club of Vallejo was temporarily 
formed by 19 businessmen in July 1921 be-
fore its permanent admittance to Rotary Inter-
national on November 6, 1921. As a part of 
Rotary International, the club’s mission is to 
provide humanitarian service to the community 
through the improvement of health, support of 
education, and alleviation of poverty, while 
promoting high ethical standards, goodwill, 
and peace. 
The Rotary Club of Vallejo promotes local 
programs, many that benefit the youth in the 
Vallejo community. They organized the Dic-
tionary Program to give every third grader a 
dictionary within the Vallejo City Unified 
School District and in Vallejo private schools. 
With a goal to create strong leaders within the 
community, the Vallejo Rotary Club created a 
Youth Leadership Program where seven 
Vallejo high school students participate in a 
week-long program to learn leadership skills at 
an outdoor camp. The Club has also gener-
ously supported the ‘‘Breakfast Club’’ program, 
providing breakfast and a safe space to do 
homework for Vallejo’s middle school students 
before the start of the school day. 
Along with the services it has provided, the 
Rotary Club of Vallejo has also funded the de-
velopment of many community projects, in-
cluding the Mullen Theater at the Children’s 
Wonderland Park and the flag pavilion and 
fountain at California Maritime Academy. Fur-
ther, the club has generously contributed to 
the art mural in the children’s section at the 
Vallejo John F. Kennedy Library, and a schol-
arship program for six graduating seniors. 
Madam Speaker, there is no doubt that the 
Rotary Club of Vallejo’s achievements and 
contributions have left a profound impact on 
the Vallejo community. Therefore, it is fitting 
and proper that we honor it here today.

HONORING 
THE 
190TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF PRESENTATION ACAD-
EMY 
HON. JOHN A. YARMUTH 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. YARMUTH. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the 190th Anniversary 
of Presentation Academy. This home of aca-
demic excellence is not only the first Catholic 
school in Louisville, but also our city’s oldest 
continually operating school. 
In 1831, Mother Catherine Spalding and the 
Sisters of Charity of Nazareth founded Pres-
entation Academy, and over the past 190 
years, the city of Louisville and Presentation 
have grown and changed together. It is an 
honor to recognize this iconic institution and 
its commitment to educating and inspiring 
young women. In making diversity, inclusivity 
and individuality a core part of the learning en-
vironment at Presentation, you have prepared 
generations of young women to take on the 
challenges of the future. 
Following a long tradition, senior Toppers 
sign Presentation’s tower on their last day of 
school, and I am grateful to the many Presen-
tation alumnae who have also left their signa-
ture on Louisville and beyond. I have no doubt 
that this legacy of service and activism will 
continue for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, colleagues, please join me 
in extending our congratulations to the admin-
istration, faculty, staff, parents, students, and 
alumnae of Presentation Academy as they cel-
ebrate nearly two centuries of changing lives 
through education and service. They are an 
absolute treasure to our community, and I 
wish them the best as they come together to 
celebrate this incredible milestone.

DR. BERNADETTE ALBANESE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Bernadette Albanese of 
the Tri-County Health Department for her dedi-
cation and service to the people of Adams, 
Arapahoe and Douglas Counties during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. In addition to her duties 
as a Pediatric Infectious Disease Specialist 
and Medical Epidemiologist for Tri-County 
Health Department, Dr. Albanese went above 
and beyond to engage, educate and inform 
the community about COVID–19, including by 
participating in three Telephone Town Halls 
with my office and thousands of my constitu-
ents. 
Dr. Albanese, who specializes in commu-
nicable disease control, outbreak investiga-
tions, disease surveillance and general health 
trends, eagerly partnered with our office to 
help inform constituents on the most up-to- 
date and accurate information on COVID–19. 
On these Telephone Town Halls, Dr. Albanese 
used her background in disease control and 
epidemiology to facilitate informed conversa-
tions with constituents and answer their ques-
tions during an uncertain time. 
There is no amount of recognition that can 
accurately display just how much Dr. Albanese 
has done for us. It is because of essential 
workers like Dr. Albanese that we have been 
able to make it this far in the pandemic. I wish 
her nothing but the best in the future, as we 
continue to fight against COVID–19.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ERIC 
SAWYER 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great sorrow that I rise today to honor the life 
of the late Eric ‘‘Ric’’ Sawyer, a longstanding 
eastern Connecticut resident who passed on 
November 5, 2021, at the age of 76. Having 
served the State of Connecticut and our nation 
in a variety of capacities, public service was 
engrained within Ric’s outlook on life. In fact, 
I can attest to the fact that community service 
was a vital aspect of the entire Sawyer family, 
as I had the opportunity to briefly serve with 
Ric’s partner, Pamela Sawyer, in the Con-
necticut General Assembly, who is now going 
on to lead the Town of Bolton, Connecticut as 
its First Selectwoman after more than two dec-
ades in the Assembly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1242 
November 16, 2021 
Born a stone’s throw away in Providence, 
Rhode Island to Dr. Carl and Gertrude Saw-
yer, Ric was destined to spend his life giving 
back to his country. Ric joined the military at 
a young age in 1967, where he was commis-
sioned as a Second Lieutenant and went on to 
proudly serve across seas as a pilot with the 
U.S. Army and National Guard (USANG) dur-
ing the Vietnam Conflict. After a year on tour 
in Vietnam, Eric was not only promoted to the 
rank of captain for his integrity as a commis-
sioned officer but then also shipped across the 
world to Germany for another two years in for-
eign service. Captain Sawyer concluded his 
long stint in active duty with countless recogni-
tions of his skilled leadership through military 
campaigns. Among his several accolades, 
Captain Eric Sawyer was most notably be-
stowed with a Distinguished Flying Cross and 
the Bronze Star. 
After serving abroad, Ric returned home de-
termined to strengthen his New England roots 
and direct his career in service toward his 
local community. Upon retiring from the 
USANG with a total of 27 years as a pilot, Ric 
spent the remainder of his career as a state 
police and corporate helicopter pilot. Though 
he was always dutiful in his work, Ric’s pros-
perity was ultimately reflected by way of 
spending time with his family, network of 
friends and cultivation of several hobbies. 
Madam Speaker, it is an honor to represent 
constituents who are as humble, dutiful, and 
distinguished as Ric Sawyer. Though Ric’s 
legacy and character will continue to have a 
ripple effect as a force of altruism, particularly 
for those who knew him in the Bolton commu-
nity, his loss and what it means for the region 
cannot be understated. It is worth finding sol-
ace, however, in the impact that his legacy will 
have upon the local community as well as his 
surviving family and loved ones, namely, his 
wife Pam, daughters Margaret and Elizabeth 
and son-in-law Sean, and six siblings. He is 
predeceased by one sibling, Richard Sawyer. 
To that end, I ask that the entire House join 
me in setting Eric Sawyer’s name further into 
stone, and recognizing his life and service to 
our Nation.

RECOGNIZING LIEUTENANT JASON 
SHAW FOR RECEIVING A LIFE- 
SAVER AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Galesburg Police Department 
Lieutenant Jason Shaw on receiving a Life- 
Saver Award by Galesburg Mayor Peter 
Schwartzman on November 1, 2021. 
Fellow GPD Officer Chris Hootman experi-
enced a medical emergency at his residence 
and contacted Lieutenant Jason Shaw, who 
acted swiftly to dispatch paramedics and Offi-
cer Dan Williams to the scene. After Lieuten-
ant Shaw helped assess that Officer Hootman 
would require more care than St. Mary Med-
ical Center in Galesburg could offer, with Lieu-
tenant Cromien following behind, Officer Wil-
liams and Lieutenant Shaw transported Officer 
Hootman by ambulance to St. Francis Medical 
Center in Peoria. On the way, paramedics had 
to pull over to provide immediate life-saving 
measures. While Officer Williams and Lieuten-
ant Shaw rendered these mitigations, Lieuten-
ant Cromien got out of her car and drove the 
ambulance the rest of the way. He was able 
to receive necessary medical care and is now 
recovering from his sustained trauma. 
Officer Chris Hootman was recently named 
School Resource Officer at Galesburg High 
School. Lieutenants Shaw and Cromien and 
Officer Williams saved his life, and thanks to 
this act of valor, he can continue to keep our 
children safe. 
It is because of committed and selfless 
leaders such as these three first responders 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to, again, formally congratulate 
Lieutenant Jason Shaw and thank him for sav-
ing the life of Officer Chris Hootman.

Tuesday, November 16, 2021

eign political dignitaries. military general offi-

Chandler and Olga married after high school 
in January 1986, and he started working at 
Houston Lighting and Power Company as a 
Power Plant Manintenance Mechanic. Olga at-
tended the University of Houston on a full 
scholarship, and the couple intended that 
Chief Chandler would enroll in college after 
she graduated. Life got in the way, and while 
Olga was attending college, they added to 
their family with the births of two sons. 
Following in the footsteps of his father, a 
police officer, Chief Chandler began his law 
enforcement career in December 1989, joining 
his cousin as a fellow officer at the Jacinto 
City Police Department. He was promoted to 
Sergeant in 1993 by Chief Joe Clark. In 1996, 
Chief Clark was hired as Chief of The Colony 
Police Department, and he hired Chief Chan-
dler away to serve as his Lieutenant and sec-
ond-in-command. May 28, 1996 marked the 
first day of Chief Chandler’s career at The 
Colony Police Department. 
Chief Chandler was promoted to the rank of 
Captain in October 1998 and Assistant Chief 
in March 2012. Chief Chandler worked in the 
Operations Division overseeing Patrol, SWAT, 
Crossing Guards, and Bike Patrol. In January 
2016, he took over the Support Services Divi-
sion and oversaw the Criminal Investigations 
Division, School Resource Officers, Jail Oper-
ations, Communications, and Records. 
He has been a committed life-long learner. 
He earned his Associates Degree in Criminal 
Justice from Collin County Community Col-
lege, followed by a Bachelors of Applied Arts 
and Sciences Degree in 2021 from the Univer-
sity of North Texas. He is a graduate of the 
Bill Blackwood Law Enforcement Management 
Institute of Texas Leadership Command Col-
lege at Sam Houston State University in 
Huntsville. He also graduated from the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation National Academy, 
Session No. 275, at Quantico, Virginia. Chief 
Chandler holds a Master Peace Officer Li-
cense through the Texas Commission of Law 
Enforcement (TCOLE) and has compiled more 
than 5,890 hours of training since beginning 
his career. 
He and Olga are the proud parent of three 
boys, each who have followed their father into 
law enforcement and are serving as officers in 
the cities of Frisco, Plano, and Carrollton. 
For more than three decades, he has been 
devoted to protecting the citizens of the com-
munities he has served, putting strangers’ 
safety above his own. I am deeply grateful for 
his public service to the City of The Colony 
and North Texas, and I wish Chief Chandler 
and his family the best in his retirement.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
SERGEI MAGNITSKY 
HON. STEVE COHEN 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, today we re-
member and honor Sergei Magnitsky, the 
Russian tax lawyer who in 2008 uncovered a 
massive fraud scheme of hundreds of millions 
of dollars perpetrated by law enforcement offi-
cers. In any normal situation, Mr. Magnitsky 
would have been praised for his efforts. But 
this was Putin’s Russia, and he was arrested 
by the very people whose nefarious dealings 
he exposed. The conditions Mr. Magnitsky 
faced in prison for almost a year were inhu-
mane, and on November 16, 2009, already 
weakened and seriously ill, he did not survive 
the beatings he received from prison guards. 
Twelve years later, Putin still controls Rus-
sia. Throughout the country, hundreds of pris-
oners of conscience languish behind bars be-
cause of their political opinions, their activism, 
and even their religious beliefs. 
Thanks to Sergei Magnitsky’s determination 
to stand up for what is right in the face of 
overwhelming state power, the laws that bear 
his name ensure they will not be forgotten. His 
story is the story of many others—not only in 
Russia, but worldwide. Exposing human rights 
abuses and corruption carries many risks in 
many countries. Yet there are many brave 
people who continue to reveal the truth. 
The Magnitsky Act has become a living me-
morial to Sergei Magnitsky’s bravery. We in 
Congress originally passed this legislation to 
sanction those involved in the death of Mr. 
Magnitsky. Since then, we have expanded it to 
cover the world’s worst human rights abusers. 
What began here has spread internationally as 
the United Kingdom, the European Union, and 
Canada have all adopted their own Magnitsky 
sanctions. Many others, such as Japan, Aus-
tralia, and Taiwan, are considering their own 
legislation. 
Magnitsky 
sanctions 
have 
completely 
changed the nature of the fight for human 
rights and against corruption. They not only 
protect our own system against abuse but also 
provide a measure of justice to those denied 
it abroad. We will keep encouraging our 
democratic allies to adopt similar sanctions so 
that one day there will be no safe haven left 
for kleptocrats and their blood money. 
Finding 
justice 
for 
Sergei 
Magnitskyin 
Putin’s Russia seems more impossible with 
each passing year. However, we have not for-
gotten his tragic story and we will never stop 
calling for accountability for those who impris-
oned him and ultimately killed him; those who 
enabled corruption and abetted murder. We 
are determined to not let his memory fade. In-
stead, he will serve as an indelible reminder of 
all those who suffer under corrupt regimes.

RECOGNIZING OFFICER DAN WIL-
LIAMS FOR RECEIVING A LIFE- 
SAVER AWARD 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Galesburg Police Department Of-
ficer Dan Williams on receiving Life-Saver 
Awards 
by 
Galesburg 
Mayor 
Peter 
Schwartzman on November 1, 2021. 
Fellow GPD Officer Chris Hootman experi-
enced a medical emergency at his residence 
and contacted Lieutenant Jason Shaw, who 
acted swiftly to dispatch paramedics and Offi-
cer Dan Williams to the scene. After Officer 
Williams 
helped 
determine 
that 
Officer 
Hootman would require more care than St. 
Mary Medical Center in Galesburg could offer, 
with Lieutenant Steffanie Cromien following 
behind, Officer Williams and Lieutenant Shaw 
transported Officer Hootman by ambulance to 
St. Francis Medical Center in Peoria. On the 
way, paramedics had to pull over to provide 
immediate life-saving measures. While Officer 
Williams and Lieutenant Shaw rendered these 
mitigations, Lieutenant Cromien got out of her 
car and drove the ambulance the rest of the 
way. He was able to receive necessary med-
ical care and is now recovering from his sus-
tained trauma. 
Officer Chris Hootman was recently named 
School Resource Officer at Galesburg High 
School. Officer Williams played a key role in 
saving his life, and thanks to this heroic act, 
he can continue to keep our children safe. 
It is because of committed and selfless 
leaders such as these three first responders 
that I am especially proud to serve Illinois’ 
17th Congressional District. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to, again, formally congratulate Offi-
cer Dan Williams and thank him for saving the 
life of Officer Chris Hootman.

DR. DAWN COMSTOCK 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. Dawn Comstock, Exec-
utive Director of the Jefferson County Public 
Health Department (JCPH) for her dedication 
and service to the people of Jefferson County, 
Colorado throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. 
In addition to her leadership role at JCPH, Dr. 
Comstock went above and beyond to engage, 
educate and inform the community about 
COVID–19, including by participating in four 
Telephone Town Halls with my office and 
thousands of my constituents. 
After a successful career as a tenured pro-
fessor at the University of Colorado Anschutz, 
Dr. Comstock answered the call to serve her 
community in the middle of a global pandemic, 
stepping into her role as Executive Director in 
February 2011. Participating in Telephone 
Town Halls, Dr. Comstock provided timely up-
dates on COVID–19 and answered constitu-
ents’ questions regarding how to protect them-
selves and their families during an uncertain 
time. Her insights and knowledge were invalu-
able to my constituents. 
There is no amount of recognition that can 
accurately display just how much Dr. Com-
stock has done for us. It is because of essen-
tial workers like Dr. Comstock that we have 
been able to make it this far in the pandemic. 
I wish her nothing but the best in the future, 
as we continue to fight against COVID–19.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
EFFORTS 
OF 
AZERBAIJAN 
TO 
STRIVE 
FOR 
PEACE 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today, I 
want to call attention to the longstanding rela-
tionship between the United States and Azer-
baijan, and to recognize the efforts of Azer-
baijan to strive for peace. 
After the collapse of the Soviet Union, the 
United States was one of the first countries to 
recognize the independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity of Azerbaijan. Since then, 
Azerbaijan has been a strong partner of the 
United States and its allies. Our countries con-
tinue to work together to promote European 
energy security, expand trade and investment, 
and combat terrorism, Azerbaijani servicemen 
served shoulder-to-shoulder with U.S. forces 
in Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. 
While more than a year has passed since 
the end of the 44-day war between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan, tensions remain high in the 
region. l support the efforts of resolving the Ar-
menia-Azerbaijan conflict through negotiations, 
as they seek to establish basic conditions for 
the continued development of relations be-
tween all countries of this region and estab-
lishing long-term peace and prosperity in the 
South Caucasus. 
I believe peace between Armenia and Azer-
baijan will not only boost bilateral relations be-
tween the two countries, but regional partner-
ship and cooperation at large. 
May God continue to bless the people of 
Azerbaijan and the United States. l pray that 
the strategic partnerships our countries have 
forged over the years will continue to flourish 
as they seek peace and security.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF MR. TOMMY WHITAKER OF 
PORTLAND, TENNESSEE 
HON. JOHN W. ROSE 
OF TENNESSEE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize my friend and constituent Mr. 
Tommy Whitaker. On November 14, one day 
before his 70th birthday, Tommy retired after 
45 years as an employee and 16 years as 
president and CEO of The Farmer’s Bank 
headquartered in Portland, TN. Tommy is a 
proud Tennessean who has dedicated his ca-
reer to serving the financial needs of his fellow 
citizens. 
Tommy graduated from the University of 
Tennessee with a B.B.A. before attending the 
Graduate School of Banking at Louisiana 
State University. 
Tommy married his wife Shirley and raised 
two wonderful children—Susan Hand and Jo-
seph Whitaker—all while continuing to work 
for the Portland community. Today, he is the 
proud grandfather of Grayson Whitaker. 
In addition to his many decades at the bank, 
Tommy serves the Upper Cumberland com-
munity as president of Cumberland Electric 
Membership Corporation, and as a member of 
the City of Portland’s Industrial Development 
Board. Previously, he served for seven years 
on the University of Tennessee Board of 
Trustees. 
Tommy is one of Tennessee’s most influen-
tial bankers and his strong character and de-
votion to service before self has gained him 
the respect of his community and beyond. It is 
truly an end of an era for The Farmer’s Bank. 
During his tenure, the bank has had significant 
growth, has produced steadily increasing re-
turns to its stockholders, and now has a 
strong team to move the bank forward for 
years to come. 
As the U.S. Representative for Tennessee’s 
Sixth Congressional District, I am grateful for 
Tommy’s friendship, his service to Tennessee, 
and his commitment to put people first. 
An inspiring leader with a human touch, I 
hope Tommy Whitaker enjoys his much-de-
served retirement back in Middle Tennessee.

RECOGNIZING DR. JOHN DOUGLAS 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Dr. John Douglas, Execu-
tive Director of the Tri-County Health Depart-
ment, for his dedication and service to the 
people of Adams, Arapahoe and Douglas 
Counties throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. 
In addition to his duties as Executive Director, 
Dr. Douglas went above and beyond by en-
gaging, informing and educating community 
members, including by participating in seven 
Telephone Town Halls with my office and 
speaking to thousands of my constituents. 
With more than 43 years of experience in 
the medical field as an Infectious Disease 
Specialist, Dr. Douglas has enormous experi-
ence in the field of public health and has 
played an instrumental role in disseminating 
accurate and timely information to Coloradans 
throughout the pandemic. On Telephone Town 
Halls, Dr. Douglas provided timely updates on 
COVID–19 and answered constituent’s ques-
tions regarding how to protect themselves and 
their families. Under Dr. Douglas’s leadership, 
residents of our community were empowered 
and informed as we worked together to help 
limit the transmission and impact of COVID– 
19 on our community. 
There is no amount of recognition that can 
accurately display just how much Dr. Douglas 
has done for us. It is because of essential 
workers like Dr. Douglas that we have been 
able to make it this far in the pandemic. I wish 
him nothing but the best in the future, as we 
continue to fight against COVID–19.

HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF 
MARY 
JAROSZ 
FROM 
THE 
SOUTHERN WAYNE COUNTY RE-
GIONAL CHAMBER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Mrs. Mary Jarosz of River-
view, Michigan on the occasion of her retire-
ment from the Southern Wayne County Re-
gional Chamber after over twenty-five years of 
service as Legislative & Business Forum Co-
ordinator. Her significant contributions to our 
Downriver community are worthy of com-
mendation. 
Born in Colombia, she moved to the United 
States at a young age. She grew up on the 
eastside of Detroit and attended Wayne State 
University. When former Southern Wayne 
County 
Regional 
Chamber 
President 
Ed 
Clemente noticed Mrs. Jarosz’s consistent at-
tendance and interest in the Chamber’s forum 
series, he offered her the opportunity to lead 
the series—and the rest is history. Since then, 
Mrs. Jarosz has turned the forum into the fan-
tastic program that we know today, bringing in 
speakers from all areas of government and 
business. These speakers have included 
Former President George H.W. Bush, Michi-
gan governors, state and federal legislators, 
and other leaders. Each year she has begun 
the series with an annual address from 
‘‘Downriver’s champion’’ the late Congressman 
John Dingell, a tradition that continues today 
with Congresswoman DINGELL. The effects of 
her hard work are felt in all areas of the forum 
and her impact will continue to be evident for 
years to come. 
An active member of the Downriver commu-
nity, her service does not end with her coordi-
nator role. Mrs. Jarosz has served on the 
Southern Wayne County Regional Chamber 
Board of Directors, representing Crystal Gar-
dens Banquet Center in Southgate and on the 
City of Riverview’s Board of Review. She is 
also a member of the Chamber’s Public Policy 
Committee and has been a trusted friend and 
advisor to countless Chamber Presidents. In 
her efforts to educate the youngest of our 
neighbors, she has worked with local leaders 
to offer free admission to local high schoolers, 
so they have the opportunity to attend the leg-
islative and business forums at no cost to 
them. A resident of Riverview, Michigan for 
nearly 55 years, she still lives there with her 
husband Rick. Together they have two chil-
dren, two grandchildren, and three great- 
grandchildren. Her dedication to the commu-
nity that she calls home is an inspiration to all 
who have crossed her path. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Mary Jarosz for her dedicated 
service to the Southern Wayne County Re-
gional Chamber. We are grateful for her years 
spent improving the lives of all Michiganders. 
I join with Mary’s family, friends, and col-
leagues in extending my best wishes to her in 
retirement.

HONORING RIDGE GREENE 
HON. MIKE THOMPSON 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, November 16, 2021 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Ridge Greene, 
who demonstrated an unwavering commitment 
to the betterment of the Port Costa community 
in California’s 5th Congressional District. 
Born in Burlingame, CA, Mr. Greene spent 
years cruising the South Pacific before moving 
to Port Costa in Contra Costa County in the 
1980s. Since his arrival, Port Costa has felt 
the impact of his tremendous compassion and 
dedication to community activism. As Senior 
Project Manager at RGM Karmer INC, Mr. 
Greene paved the way for large-scale con-
struction projects for Bay Area School Dis-
tricts. Utilizing his expertise in construction, he 
became a crucial member of the Port Costa 
Recycles, an innovative grassroots community 
recycling program. 
Among a multitude of community involve-
ments, Mr. Greene played a key role in the 
Port Costa Conservation Society as well as 
the restoration of the Port Costa School build-
ing. As a board member of the Port Costa 
Conservation Society, Mr. Greene helped save 
the historic, but physically neglected school 
building. He became the chairman of the 
board, and continually used his role as chair-
man to lead restoration efforts. Mr. Greene 
was vital in the planning and oversight of the 
construction work for the school building, and 
his knowledge of the State Historic Preserva-
tion Office’s requirements proved invaluable in 
preserving the historic status of the Port Costa 
School. 
After 30 years, Mr. Greene retired on April 
15, 2021 from the Board of Directors of the 
Port Costa Conservation Society. Nonethe-
less, Mr. Greene continues to serve his com-
munity. His relentless will and caring heart 
have led him to serve as a construction con-
sultant to the board. Additionally, Mr. Greene 
is a lifetime member of E Clampus Vitus, 
where he is described as a ‘‘Clamper,’’ and a 
retired member of the fire commission in 
Crockett-Carquinez’s fire district. In retirement, 
he looks forward to traveling more with his 
wife, Monica, and spending time with his two 
loving children, Clare and Aaron. 
Madam Speaker, it is no doubt that the his-
toric 1911 Port Costa School will serve as a 
visual testimony to Mr. Greene’s impact for 
generations to come. Therefore, it is fitting and 
proper that we honor him here today.

ship with my office. Again, I thank Dr. Huffman
