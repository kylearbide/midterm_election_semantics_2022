PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
O rock of our salvation, You alone 
are our hope for the years to come. Be-
cause of Your mercies, You have given 
us the gift of this day. You have been 
our help in ages past, and we place our 
future in Your hands. 
Lord, forgive us when we do things 
our way, refusing to submit to Your 
holy will and seeking to derail Your 
wise and powerful providence. Remind 
us to seek first to stay within the cir-
cle of Your divine purposes, for You are 
God, and we are not. 
Today, use our lawmakers for Your 
glory. Give them the unity they need 
to accomplish Your will. Guide them 
with Your wisdom. 
We pray in Your matchless Name. 
Amen.

f 
RESPECT FOR MARRIAGE ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, four 
words are inscribed in the stone above 
the U.S. Supreme Court: ‘‘Equal Jus-
tice 
Under 
Law’’—‘‘Equal 
Justice 
Under Law.’’ In many ways, the story 
of America has been about making 
those words true for all Americans. 
Sometimes we take bold steps forward. 
Other times, unfortunately, we take 
disturbing steps backward. 
We all know that when the Constitu-
tion was written, there was not equal 
justice under law. That is pretty obvi-
ous. So many people were excluded 
from voting and other rights. But we 
have tried to move forward, and that is 
one of the beautiful things about 
America. We keep moving forward. We 
push. 
But, unfortunately, today America 
finds itself in one of those frightening 
moments of regression—of regression. 
A few months ago, tens of millions of 
women saw their fundamental right to 
choose taken away before their very 
eyes. Justice Thomas, in a concurring 
opinion, suggested that other rights, 
like the freedom to marry protected in 
Obergefell might come next. 
The mere thought should make us 
sick to our stomachs. The Senate has a 
responsibility now to act. Because of 
this threat, the Senate will hold a vote 
on the Respect for Marriage Act in the 
coming weeks so that no American is 
discriminated against because of whom 
they love. 
My colleagues Senators BALDWIN and 
SINEMA
and others have worked for 
months to build bipartisan support for 
this legislation. I applaud them for 
their efforts. I hope that we will get at 
least 10 Republicans to join us to pass 
marriage equality through the Senate. 
If the Respect for Marriage Act can win 
significant Republican support in the 
House, there is no legitimate reason for 
Republicans in this Chamber to stand 
in the way. 
Over the past few weeks, we have 
heard many on the other side say: Well, 
this vote isn’t necessary.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4498 
September 8, 2022 
They say marriage equality is not 
something Americans spend a lot of 
time thinking about anymore. They 
want us to believe that the Supreme 
Court would never do something as 
reckless as reversing the precedent of 
marriage equality that millions have 
relied on for years. 
Well, where oh where have we heard 
that before? The very same people who 
suggested that Roe was established 
precedent now want us to think that 
the Supreme Court won’t go further, 
even though a sitting Justice on the 
highest Court in the land openly said 
something to the contrary, and he is 
often joined by four others. 
Lest we forget, marriage equality 
was not the law of the land a decade 
ago. Discrimination against LGBTQ 
Americans still continues to this day. 
Now MAGA Republicans have escalated 
their rhetoric against same sex mar-
riage and want to normalize gender dis-
crimination. 
MAGA Republicans seem to make it 
their business to pick on certain 
groups, not to do things that are posi-
tive and move things forward but to 
sort of just point their fingers at some-
one and blame them for some abstract 
reason that really doesn’t hurt them at 
all. 
That 
is 
where 
this 
Republican 
Party—unfortunately, 
too 
many 
of 
them—are headed, led by these MAGA 
Republicans and often fomented by 
former President Trump. 
Earlier this year—here is what I am 
talking about. This isn’t pie in the sky. 
The Texas Republican GOP, earlier this 
year, even adopted a party platform. 
This is of the largest Republican State 
in the country, the one with the most 
congressional 
representatives. 
The 
Texas GOP adopted this year a party 
platform that said ‘‘homosexuality is 
an abnormal lifestyle choice.’’ 
Let me repeat that. The largest Re-
publican State in the country, its Re-
publican Party, captured by MAGA fer-
vor—absurd 
fervor—said 
‘‘homosex-
uality is an abnormal lifestyle choice.’’ 
Just yesterday, a judge said that em-
ployers can deny access to medication 
if they believe it would encourage ho-
mosexuality. And we all know that 
these MAGA Republicans and their ilk, 
led by this man named Leonard Leo, 
with billions of dollars of dark money, 
use the courts to move America back-
ward—move the courts to move Amer-
ica backward. And that is what hap-
pened yesterday with this judge com-
ing up with this absurd, obnoxious, des-
picable resolution. 
I trust that that radical view of that 
judge and of that Texas GOP is not 
something many of us embrace here in 
this Chamber. But we can’t act as if 
our fundamental rights will stay safe if 
we aren’t willing to safeguard them 
through legislation. If we are going to 
let these MAGA judges—rightwing, ap-
pointed by Leonard Leo and the Fed-
eralist Society—if we are not going to 
let them move America backward, then 
we have an obligation to act. 
So let me make clear that a vote on 
marriage equality will happen on the 
Senate floor in the coming weeks, and 
I hope there will be at least 10 Repub-
licans to support it. 
f 
JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on the 
related subject, obviously, of judges, 
today the Senate will continue ful-
filling its constitutional duty to con-
firm more judges to sit on our Federal 
judiciary. 
It has really been a productive week 
here on the floor when it comes to 
judges. Yesterday, we confirmed John 
Lee to serve a lifetime appointment as 
circuit judge on the Seventh Circuit, 
the first Asian American to ever sit on 
that court. 
Today, we will confirm another cir-
cuit judge—Andre Mathis—to sit on 
the Sixth Circuit. When confirmed, 
Mathis will be the 78th judge we have 
confirmed 
under 
President 
Biden— 
more than President Trump, more than 
President Obama, more than President 
Bush had confirmed up to this point. It 
is a great record. We are proud of it, 
and we aren’t done. 
Later this afternoon, we will begin 
working on our third—our third—cir-
cuit court judge of the week, Salvador 
Mendoza, to sit on the Ninth Circuit. 
After we vote on cloture today, Mem-
bers should expect to vote on his con-
firmation as early as the beginning of 
next week. Moving forward, it will be 
one of our top priorities to confirm as 
many judges as possible. It is one of 
the best things we can do with our 
time here on the floor, especially given 
how many MAGA-type judges Presi-
dent Trump and the Republican major-
ity appointed. 
The lion’s share of legal disputes 
never make it to the Supreme Court, 
giving those who preside in the lower 
courts immense power to affect the 
lives of the American people. And, of 
course, when they get it wrong—as 
they have all too frequently recently— 
the results can be disastrous. 
Just yesterday, a hard-right judge in 
Texas, as I mentioned, stripped away 
Americans’ rights to access preventive 
care. Over 150 million Americans could 
now be at risk of losing everything 
from breast cancer screenings to cho-
lesterol screenings, free vaccinations, 
mental health assessments, and so 
much more. Add that to the previous 
case I mentioned before, and you can 
see that judges are out of control, far 
away from what most Americans want, 
foisted upon us by the Republican Sen-
ate majority, President Trump, and a 
small band of rightwing, MAGA billion-
aires. 
In the long run, this decision could 
mean more people get sick or die need-
lessly simply because they can’t afford 
preventive care to stay healthy. That 
is the kind of thing that is at stake 
when it comes to judges. 
It is a frightening reminder of the 
difference between our side and the 
hard right, the MAGA hard right, the 
extreme MAGA hard right. Whether 
through judges or legislation, the hard 
right remains obsessed—obsessed—with 
stripping away people’s rights to af-
fordable healthcare. It is dangerous. It 
is malicious. It is wildly out of step 
with the American people. 
Democrats want something different. 
We want to protect people’s healthcare, 
not destroy it. We want judges who will 
preserve 
long-established 
precedent, 
not obliterate it, who will move us for-
ward on our fight to equality, not take 
steps backward. And in the coming 
weeks and months, we will maintain a 
laser-like focus on confirming judges 
who will do the kinds of things that we 
believe must be done in America. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered.

f 
QUEEN ELIZABETH II 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
first this morning, the Senate and the 
American people are watching the news 
regarding our friends in the United 
Kingdom and the health of their be-
loved Queen Elizabeth. 
The Queen is an exemplar of steady 
leadership and a beloved figure around 
the world. She has been a historic 
friend of the United States. The dec-
ades of her reign have seen a profound 
deepening of the special relationship 
between our two countries that has lit-
erally changed the world. 
The Queen, the royal family, and all 
our friends in the United Kingdom have 
our thoughts and our prayers. 
f 
ENERGY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on a completely different matter, I 
have been talking all week about the 
ways that liberal policies hurt Amer-
ican families in their daily lives. 
After 2 years of total Democratic 
control in Washington, we have seen 
how reckless spending comes home to 
roost in the form of decades-high infla-
tion and shrinking paychecks for work-
ing Americans. 
We have seen what happens when one 
of our two major political parties de-
cides in its rhetoric, in its personnel, 
and in its policies that keeping our 
streets safe, our border secure, and

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4499 
September 8, 2022 
criminals behind bars are simply not 
their priorities. And despite multiple 
glaring cautionary tales both at home 
and abroad, we are seeing the early 
warning signs of our Democratic col-
leagues’ hostility to an all-of-the-above 
American energy strategy. 
In Europe, some of America’s closest 
allies are reaping the painful effects of 
years of shortsighted green policies. By 
swapping affordable and reliable do-
mestic power for half-baked fads, our 
friends have placed themselves at the 
mercy of Vladimir Putin to meet de-
mand ahead of another cold winter. 
Working families and small busi-
nesses are taking this tradeoff on the 
chin. I saw one shop owner in Ireland 
explain she has just had to pay almost 
as much for 2 months of electricity as 
she did throughout all of last year. Un-
fortunately, millions of Americans can 
sympathize. An estimated 20 million 
U.S. households are already behind on 
their energy bills thanks to Democrats’ 
runaway inflation. 
And out in California, State and local 
Democrats have wasted no time taking 
things even further—even further—in 
the wrong direction. Democrats have 
made California’s electrical grid into a 
giant experiment to try out all of their 
misunderstandings about energy pol-
icy. It is not going well. With hot 
weather demand surging, California au-
thorities are sweating political short-
falls of up to 5,000 megawatts. Califor-
nia’s love affair with fickle, unreliable 
green energy could force its residents 
to put up with rolling blackouts just to 
conform to wealthy liberals’ pref-
erences. 
The government had to send out an 
emergency message begging citizens to 
ration power. Ironically, just weeks 
after announcing a future ban on gas- 
powered automobiles, the State is now 
begging folks not to charge their ex-
pensive electric cars to avoid crashing 
the grid. 
So California Democrats don’t want 
you putting gas in your car; they don’t 
want you to plug in your car either. 
That is exactly where their war on en-
ergy would leave the American people: 
Going nowhere fast. 
President Biden’s Secretary of En-
ergy, Secretary Granholm, literally 
said less than a week ago that: 
California is in the lead— 
In the lead— 
and can show the rest of the nation how it is 
done. 
So at home and abroad, our Demo-
cratic colleagues have been given so-
bering warnings of what not to do on 
energy. They have seen what happens 
when you wage war on abundant fossil 
fuels, abandon nuclear power, and go 
all in on the least—the least—reliable 
energy sources. 
But this all-Democratic government 
has spent 2 straight years running 
head-on toward these bright red flash-
ing warning signals. They have frozen 
new domestic energy leasing, canceled 
new pipelines, and reinstated a maze— 
a maze—of redtape designed to strangle 
entire domestic industries. 
As gas prices skyrocketed on Presi-
dent Biden’s watch, his administration 
approved less new oil drilling than any 
since Harry Truman was in office. Our 
Democratic colleagues have doubled 
and tripled down. Last month, while 
they rammed through their reckless 
taxing-and-spending spree, they voted 
in lockstep multiple times against Re-
publican amendments that would have 
helped shore up American energy and 
rebuild our independence. 
Europe in thrall to Putin’s gas sup-
ply, California talking about rolling 
blackouts—exactly what further warn-
ing do our Democratic colleagues actu-
ally need? 
f 
AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on another matter, in January 2019, a 
bipartisan supermajority of the Senate 
voted for an amendment I authored 
warning that the ‘‘. . . precipitous 
withdrawal of United States forces 
from [Afghanistan] could put at risk 
hard-won gains and United States na-
tional security.’’ 
Two years later, senior experts and 
advisers repeated the same warning to 
President Biden. His own experts made 
it clear that a hasty retreat from coun-
terterrorism operations in Afghanistan 
would lead to the collapse of the Af-
ghan Government. 
Those warnings, of course, fell on 
deaf ears. Thirteen American service-
members died fulfilling the Biden ad-
ministration’s rush to evacuation. The 
Taliban now rules again in Kabul, as it 
did before U.S. forces arrived. Now, 1 
year on from last August’s disaster, the 
devastating scale of the fallout from 
President Biden’s decision has come 
into sharper focus. Afghanistan has be-
come, once again, a global pariah. Its 
economy has shrunk by nearly a third. 
Half of its population is now suffering 
critical levels of food insecurity. Af-
ghan women and girls have had their 
rights to work, attend school, and live 
independently torn away under Taliban 
rule. And just as we feared, just as was 
predicted, Afghanistan is again becom-
ing a serious haven for terrorists. 
The recent American strike that 
took out al-Qaida’s leader al-Zawahiri 
is a credit to decades of work by the 
professionals of our intelligence com-
munity. 
Ah, but the fact that a terrorist king-
pin felt comfortable in Kabul just 
months after America’s withdrawal is a 
damning condemnation of the Biden 
administration’s unjustified confidence 
that the Taliban could be trusted not 
to lay out the welcome mat for our 
most consequential terrorist enemies. 
The strike was a success, but the un-
derlying fact that President Biden’s 
policies led this top terrorist to set up 
shop with impunity right in downtown 
Kabul is a colossal failure. 
In fact, just weeks before the strike 
that killed Zawahiri, when the admin-
istration already knew full well that 
the Taliban government and senior 
Haqqani terrorists were harboring him, 
the 
administration 
still—still—re-
leased another hardened terrorist from 
Guantanamo and returned him into the 
Taliban’s waiting arms. 
So al-Qaida is rebuilding under the 
patronage of the Taliban and the 
Haqqanis. There is no question that so- 
called over-the-horizon counterterror-
ism operations are becoming much 
more difficult. Senior administration 
officials have acknowledged that our 
intelligence about the growing threat 
is drying up—so is our ability to com-
bat it. 
And the damage, the fallout, isn’t 
limited just to Afghanistan itself. 
America’s reckless abandonment has 
done lasting damage to the coalition 
partnerships that had made our oper-
ations there so successful. President 
Biden 
showed 
America’s 
allies 
we 
couldn’t be trusted or reasoned with, 
and he showed our adversaries the 
weakness of our resolve. There is no 
question in my mind that Russian, Chi-
nese, and Iranian leaders watched us 
retreat 
from 
Afghanistan 
and, 
of 
course, were emboldened. 
I advised three consecutive Presi-
dents not to withdraw from Afghani-
stan—three of them. I believed a small 
residual 
presence 
was 
sustainable, 
would help us keep pressure on the ter-
rorists, and protect us here at home. 
Gen. Frank McKenzie, CENTCOM 
commander during the withdrawal, has 
said repeatedly that he voiced the very 
same view to President Biden. 
But even now, a year after the Presi-
dent’s orders were carried out, the 
Biden 
administration 
continues 
to 
shirk 
accountability 
and 
responsi-
bility. 
The fact that their haphazard scram-
ble required an unprecedented airlift 
was not a success; it was a failure. The 
fact that over a year later, the admin-
istration still cannot really account for 
who they brought into our country, 
while both Americans and vulnerable 
Afghan partners still remain in Af-
ghanistan as we speak, is not a success; 
it is a failure. 
President Biden has rejected prac-
tically every part of his predecessor’s 
agenda, foreign and domestic, but he 
pretends he was somehow powerless to 
alter the previous administration’s 
Doha agreement to pull out of Afghani-
stan—the one time President Biden de-
cided the previous President had it 
right. Of course, the truth is that 
President Biden wanted to withdraw 
from Afghanistan. He campaigned on 
it. According to public reports, he 
spent the entire Obama administration 
pushing back against the generals’ ad-
vice not to cut and run. And once in of-
fice himself, he pushed ahead. 
Senate Republicans will continue to 
press for accountability, will continue 
to pursue answers to tough questions 
about why the Biden administration

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion and resume consideration of the 
following nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The bill clerk read the nomination of 
Andre B. Mathis, of Tennessee, to be 
United States Circuit Judge for the 
Sixth Circuit. 
Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to

THE INFLATION REDUCTION ACT 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a month 
ago 
yesterday, 
Senate 
Democrats 
shoved another partisan spending bill 
through the Senate—this one, the inac-
curately named ‘‘Inflation Reduction 
Act.’’ I say ‘‘inaccurately named’’ be-
cause the so-called Inflation Reduction 
Act will do nothing to reduce inflation. 
That is right. The so-called Inflation 
Reduction Act will not actually reduce 
inflation. You don’t have to take my 
word for it; the nonpartisan Penn 
Wharton Budget Model said this about 
the bill’s impact on inflation: ‘‘The im-
pact on inflation is statistically indis-
tinguishable from zero’’—‘‘statistically 
indistinguishable from zero.’’ 
Democrats also claim that the bill 
will lead to deficit reduction, but that 
is not really true, either. In the first 
place, Democrats arrive at their deficit 
reduction assumptions using some ex-
tremely fuzzy math. A substantial part 
of their deficit reduction claims depend 
on not extending a program that they 
have already called for extending and 
on supposedly eliminating a rule that 
at this point was never going to be im-
plemented anyway. 
But even using their rosiest assump-
tions, the deficit reduction they would 
have achieved with the Inflation Re-
duction Act was wiped out completely 
8 days after the bill was signed by the 
President’s costly, reckless student 
loan giveaway. 
Democrats have clearly been seeing 
the polling on Americans’ opinion of 
the economy and their lack of faith in 
President Biden and Democrats to deal 
with the economic challenges we are 
facing. That is unquestionably why 
Democrats named their bill the ‘‘Infla-
tion Reduction Act’’ and touted their 
commitment to deficit reduction in an 
attempt to suggest fiscal responsi-
bility. The problem, of course, is that 
their commitment to deficit reduction, 
inflation reduction, and fiscal responsi-
bility was and continues to be nothing 
more than window dressing. 
At its core, the Inflation Reduction 
Act, like the so-called American Res-
cue Plan before it, is just another big 
government, big spending piece of leg-
islation. It will do nothing to address 
the real economic challenges facing 
our Nation. Instead, it will waste tax-
payer dollars on Democrats’ big gov-
ernment fantasies. It will drive up en-
ergy costs in the service of Democrats’ 
Green New Deal agenda. It will push 
people off private insurance and into 
government-run healthcare, driving up 
the cost to taxpayers. The legislation 
imposes socialist-style price controls 
that will discourage medical innova-
tion and reduce the number of new 
treatments and cures. It imposes new 
taxes on businesses that will slow eco-
nomic growth and result in lower 
wages and fewer jobs. And the list goes 
on. 
In case there was any doubt about 
their intentions with this bill, Demo-
crats made their priorities very, very 
clear 
when 
the 
Senate 
considered 
amendments. Democrats’ so-called In-
flation Reduction Act hikes taxes on 
domestic oil and gas production—some-
thing that will unquestionably result 
in higher energy prices for American 
families, who are already facing higher 
energy bills in the Biden economy. 
During the amendment vote-arama 
on this legislation, Democrats made it 
very clear that they are, indeed, just 
fine with restricting American energy 
production and seeing Americans’ en-
ergy bills soar. 
Democrats rejected attempts to ease 
their tax hikes on domestic oil and gas. 
They rejected amendments to make it 
easier for companies to develop Amer-
ican oil and natural gas. They also re-
jected a comprehensive amendment to 
reform 
the 
burdensome 
permitting 
process, which is one of the biggest ob-
stacles to new energy investment. 
They even rejected an amendment to 
prevent Democrats’ new electric vehi-
cle tax credit from going to wealthy 
Americans. So apparently it is just fine 
to support measures that would drive 
up Americans’ energy bills, but electric 
vehicle tax breaks for wealthy Ameri-
cans have to be preserved, not to men-
tion the irony of U.S. automakers re-
cently hiking prices on certain electric 
vehicles by $6,500 to $8,000, which 
roughly matches the $7,500 tax credit 
in the Democrats’ inflation reduction 
bill. 
Now, I have been a longtime sup-
porter of clean energy, but the fact of 
the matter is, clean energy technology 
has not advanced to a point where we 
can solely rely on alternative energy. 
We need oil, we need natural gas, and 
we will continue to need them for a 
while yet. Efforts to discourage domes-
tic production of conventional energy 
will simply drive up energy costs for 
hard-working Americans and force our 
country to rely on unstable foreign 
sources of oil and gas. Now, that may 
very well be the Democrats’ plan in 
hopes of hastening the arrival of their 
Green New Deal future. 
Democrats like to bill themselves as 
the party of the little guy, but their 
track record gives the lie to that. 
Democrats couldn’t bring themselves 
to support measures to lower Ameri-
cans’ energy bills by increasing domes-
tic oil and gas production because it 
conflicts with their Green New Deal 
ideology. They did all unite to protect 
a tax deduction that mainly goes to 
wealthy Americans in high-tax States 
and to make sure, as I mentioned, that 
wealthy Americans are able to access 
tax credits for electric vehicles. 
Of course, they opposed a measure to 
prevent more audits of Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year. That 
is right. Democrats’ legislation in-
cludes tens of billions of dollars for 
new IRS agents and increased audits. 
Democrats’ hope is that more audits of 
Americans will help pay for some of 
their spending measures like increased 
government healthcare subsidies and 
their Green New Deal priorities. 
The Biden administration put out a 
statement claiming that this wouldn’t 
mean increased audits of Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year, but 
when Democrats had the opportunity 
to confirm that by supporting an 
amendment that would have prevented 
the new enforcement funds from being 
used to audit Americans making less 
than $400,000 a year, they unani-
mously—unanimously—voted 
against 
it. 
I could go on. I haven’t even talked 
about the border security amendments 
the Democrats opposed. Republicans 
thought that perhaps, while Democrats 
were throwing money at environmental 
justice and climate slush funds and 
identifying gaps in tree canopy cov-
erage, perhaps they could spare some 
money for the crisis at our southern 
border—a crisis that Democrats have 
largely chosen to pretend doesn’t exist. 
But Democrats quashed any attempt to 
divert money to address the border cri-
sis. Apparently, identifying gaps in 
tree canopy coverage is more impor-
tant than securing our southern bor-
der. 
Democrats went so far as to oppose— 
oppose—an 
amendment 
that 
would 
have prohibited hiring additional IRS 
agents until additional Customs and 
Border Protection agents are hired to 
help secure the border. You heard that 
right. Now, I am pretty sure Americans 
are more worried about our border cri-
sis than what Democrats apparently 
think is an IRS enforcement crisis. But

clearly Democrats don’t want to let 
border security get in the way of fund-
ing for the Green New Deal priorities 
or supersizing the IRS. 
It may have an appealing name, but, 
as the substance of the bill dem-
onstrates, the so called Inflation Re-
duction Act is nothing more than the 
latest installment of Democrats’ big 
government and big spending agenda. 
It will do nothing to address the real 
economic challenges facing Americans, 
and it will do nothing to address Amer-
icans’ priorities. What it will do is 
spend hundreds of billions of taxpayer 
dollars on Democrats’ socialist and big 
government fantasies and raise taxes 
to help pay for it. Meanwhile, our infla-
tion crisis and our border crisis and ris-
ing crime will continue. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Vermont. 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise 
this morning to express my strong op-
position to the so-called side deal that 
the fossil fuel industry is pushing to 
make it easier for them to pollute the 
environment and destroy our planet. 
But, before I do, let me put my oppo-
sition to this disastrous side deal into 
a broader context. 
As the father of four kids and the 
grandfather of seven, I very much wish 
that I did not have to say what I am 
going to say, but the most serious chal-
lenge facing our country and the entire 
world, far and away, is, in fact, the ex-
istential threat of climate change. 
That is not the opinion of BERNIE 
SANDERS, who failed physics in college. 
That is what the scientific community 
is telling us in a virtually unanimous 
voice. 
The latest report from the United 
Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change, the IPCC, is very 
clear, and it is very foreboding. If the 
United States, China, Russia, and the 
rest of the world do not act extremely 
aggressively in cutting carbon emis-
sions, our planet will face enormous 
and irreversible damage. In fact, the 
world that we will be leaving to our 
kids and to future generations will be-
come increasingly unhealthy and un-
inhabitable. That is not BERNIE SAND-
ERS. That is the virtually unanimous 
conclusion of the scientists who study 
this issue. 
The truth is that we don’t need the 
scientists or another study to tell us 
what is happening. We see it with our 
own eyes here in the United States and 
all over the world. The American peo-
ple, today, and people throughout the 
globe are seeing the devastating im-
pact climate change is having on their 
communities and their families—with 
their own eyes. That is what they are 
seeing right now as I speak. 
Please understand—and this may be 
the most important point I want to 
make this morning—that, with every-
thing being equal, what is happening 
right now will become worse and worse 
and worse. This is not, ‘‘Oh, boy, we 
have torrential rain,’’ or, ‘‘Oh, boy, 
ain’t it hot?’’ With everything being 
equal, everything we are seeing today 
will become worse in the years to 
come. Let’s just take a brief look at 
what is happening right now in the 
United States and around the world. 
The past 8 years have been the hot-
test years in recorded history. Right 
now, the western half of the United 
States 
is 
experiencing 
its 
worst 
drought in over 1,200 years. Right now, 
in California, Nevada, and Utah, they 
are experiencing recordbreaking heat 
waves. 
Historic 
rainfall 
and 
devastating 
floods took place over a 5-week stretch 
this summer in eastern Kentucky; 
eastern Illinois; St. Louis, MO; Death 
Valley, CA; and Dallas, TX. These are 
supposed to be once-in-1,000-years tor-
rential rainfalls, and we are seeing 
them coming all together within a few 
weeks. 
Right now, Europe is experiencing its 
worst drought in over 500 years. And 
let’s remember that when we talk 
about drought, it is not only, ‘‘Boy, 
isn’t it hot?’’ it impacts agricultural 
production and the quantity and qual-
ity of food that we eat. 
A massive heat wave in Spain and 
Portugal killed more than 2,000 people 
in July. Historically hot weather in 
London and China literally melted 
bridges, airplane runways, and roof-
tops. Let me repeat that. The ex-
tremely hot weather in London and in 
China this summer literally melted 
bridges, rooftops, and airplane run-
ways, with all of the consequences that 
that has. 
Recordbreaking forest fires in Europe 
have already burned 1.6 million acres of 
land—56 percent more than the pre-
vious record set in 2017. That is a size 
that is over eight times bigger than 
New York City. 
Recordbreaking drought in China has 
caused parts of the Yangtze River to 
completely dry up. The Yangtze River 
is the third largest river in the world. 
It is the source of drinking water for 
400 million people. 
Catastrophic rainfall and massive 
floods have been going on for weeks in 
Pakistan, killing at least 1,200 people 
and displacing another 10 million as 
one-third of Pakistan is now under-
water. 
If all of this is not sobering enough 
and if it is not frightening enough, a 
glacier in Antarctica that the sci-
entists have dubbed the ‘‘doomsday 
glacier’’ has been in ‘‘rapid retreat’’ 
and is melting much faster than pre-
vious predictions. Without this glacier 
and its supporting ice shelves, sea lev-
els could rise by 3 to 10 feet, which 
could cause entire coastal communities 
to flood and go underwater forever. We 
are talking about major cities here in 
the United States and across the world 
that could be underwater in the coming 
decades. 
Just think for a moment about the 
massive 
dislocation, 
turmoil, 
and 
international tensions that will occur 
when millions and millions of people 
migrate from where they have lived 
into new areas. The tragedies and dis-
turbances and destruction goes on and 
on and on. 
In the past, a series of climate disas-
ters like these might have seemed like 
a silly plot in a bad movie about the 
apocalypse. 
Unfortunately, 
however, 
what we are living through now is not 
a movie. It is reality. This is what we 
are experiencing right now in front of 
us. Again, this entire scenario—what 
we are seeing now—will almost defi-
nitely become worse in the years to 
come if the United States, China, and 
the rest of the world do not get our act 
together and break our dependency on 
fossil fuels. 
One of the strange ironies about this 
moment is that, if the United States 
did all of the right things tomorrow, it 
would not be enough. We need the co-
operation of China and of countries 
throughout the world. We as a planet 
are in this together, and we are going 
to have to act decisively. In my view, 
the largest economy in the world, 
which is the United States of America, 
must lead this effort. If we retreat, it 
sends a terrible message to countries 
all over the world. If we retreat, clear-
ly, what we will be seeing are more 
floods, more rising sea levels, more ex-
treme 
weather 
disturbances, 
more 
ocean 
acidification, 
more 
drought, 
more famine, more disease, and more 
human suffering. 
Today, to all of my colleagues here in 
the Senate who have kids and grand-
children—I think that is almost every-
body—I just ask you to think ahead 10, 
15, 20 years. Think about the discus-
sions you will be having with your kids 
or your grandchildren when that young 
person looks you in the eye and says: 
Dad, Grandma, what did you do to save 
the planet? 
I want you to think about that. 
We all know that climate change is 
real. We know that climate change is 
caused by carbon emissions. No one 
disagrees with that. We know that cli-
mate change is already causing dev-
astating destruction throughout the 
world. We know that, if we don’t rap-
idly transform our energy system away 
from fossil fuels and toward energy ef-
ficiency and renewable energy, the sit-
uation will only become much worse, 
and our planet will face irreparable and 
irreversible harm. That is the simple 
reality. 
Yet, given all that we know and 
given all that the scientists are telling 
us, what is the U.S. Congress about to 
do? Well, the U.S. Congress is seriously 
considering legislation to provide a 
huge giveaway to the fossil fuel indus-
try to drill, produce, and sell more oil 
and gas. 
Really? At a time when climate 
change is threatening the very exist-
ence of our planet, why would anybody 
be talking about substantially increas-
ing carbon emissions and expanding 
fossil fuel production in the United 
States? What kind of message does this

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4502 
September 8, 2022 
send to the people of our own country, 
to the young people, and to suffering 
people all over the world? It is that, in 
the midst of this horrific crisis caused 
by fossil fuel emissions, we are about 
to pass legislation to increase fossil 
fuel production. 
Like every other Member of the Sen-
ate, I have a pretty good understanding 
of how politics works in our corrupt 
political system. Like every other Sen-
ator, I understand what campaign con-
tributions are about. I understand what 
the thousands of lobbyists all over Cap-
itol Hill do, and I surely understand 
the extraordinary power of the fossil 
fuel industry to push the legislation 
that they want. In fact, they were suc-
cessful for decades in lying to the 
American people about the reality of 
climate change. So I know about the 
power of the fossil fuel industry. 
But, today, I beg of my colleagues 
that, at this moment, when the future 
of the world is literally at stake, that 
we have the courage to stand up to the 
fossil fuel industry and to tell them 
and the politicians whom they sponsor 
that the future of the planet is more 
important than their short-term prof-
its. 
In the coming weeks and months, the 
Senate has a fundamental choice to 
make. We can listen to the fossil fuel 
industry and the politicians they pay, 
who are spending huge amounts of 
money on lobbying and campaign con-
tributions to pass this dirty side deal, 
or we can listen to the scientists and 
the environmental community that are 
telling us loudly and clearly to reject 
this side deal and eliminate the $15 bil-
lion in tax breaks and subsidies Con-
gress is already providing to big oil and 
gas companies each and every year. 
While the legislative text of the side 
deal has not been made public, accord-
ing to a one-page summary that was 
released last month, this bill would 
make it easier for the fossil fuel indus-
try to receive permits to complete 
some of the dirtiest and most polluting 
oil and gas projects in America. 
Specifically, this deal would approve 
the $6.6 billion Mountain Valley Pipe-
line—a 303-mile fracked gas pipeline 
spanning from West Virginia to Vir-
ginia and potentially on to North Caro-
lina. We are talking about a pipeline 
that would generate emissions equiva-
lent to 37 coal plants or over 27 million 
cars each and every year. 
It is hard for me to understand why 
anyone—anyone 
who 
is 
concerned 
about climate change—would consider 
for one second voting to approve a 
pipeline that would be equivalent to 
putting 27 million more cars on the 
road each and every year, especially at 
a time when we are trying to transi-
tion into electric vehicles. 
On August 24, over 650 environmental 
and civil rights organizations wrote a 
letter to Majority Leader SCHUMER and 
Speaker PELOSI urging them to reject 
this side deal. This letter was signed by 
the Sierra Club, the Sunrise Move-
ment, Friends of the Earth, Physicians 
for 
Social 
Responsibility, 
350.org, 
Greenpeace, Public Citizen, People’s 
Action, and the NAACP. 
Here is a summary of what the letter 
says. This is a letter signed by 650 envi-
ronmental and civil rights groups: 
On behalf of 653 frontline communities and 
environmental 
. . . 
organizations 
rep-
resenting millions of members and sup-
porters nationwide, we are writing to express 
our strenuous opposition to any additional 
fossil fuel giveaways. Alarming proposals 
have been referenced by Senator MANCHIN, in 
a short memo, and in legislative language 
that was clearly drafted in consultation with 
the American Petroleum Institute. . . . It 
has been reported that Manchin has de-
manded these handouts to the fossil fuel in-
dustry as a further price for his vote on the 
Inflation Reduction Act, which already in-
cluded large giveaways to polluters. 
We call on you to unequivocally reject any 
effort to promote fossil fuels, advance 
unproven technologies, and weaken our core 
environmental laws. . . . This fossil fuel wish 
list is a cruel and direct attack on environ-
mental justice communities and the climate. 
This legislation would truncate and hallow- 
out the environmental review process, weak-
en Tribal consultations, and make it far 
harder for frontline communities to have 
their voices heard by gutting bedrock protec-
tions in the National Environmental Policy 
Act and Clean Water Act. . . . Supporting 
this legislation would represent a profound 
betrayal of frontline communities and con-
stituents across the country would have 
called on you to . . . advance a just, renew-
able energy future. 
That is from 650 environmental orga-
nizations. I could not agree more. 
The entire letter can be found online 
at https://peoplevsfossilfuels.org/dirty- 
deal-letter/. 
I should also add that at least 59 of 
our colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives will soon be releasing a 
letter expressing strong opposition to 
this side deal. Let me briefly quote 
from that letter: 
According to media reports, there is agree-
ment to advance a series of anti-environ-
mental and anti-environmental justice pro-
visions through the House, at the behest of 
the American Petroleum Institute. . . . 
These destructive provisions will allow pol-
luting manufacturing and energy develop-
ment projects to be rushed through before 
the families who are forced to live near them 
are even aware of the plans. . . . We remain 
deeply concerned that these serious and det-
rimental permitting provisions will signifi-
cantly and disproportionately impact low-in-
come communities, indigenous communities, 
and communities of color. The inclusion of 
these provisions in a continuing resolution, 
or any other must-pass legislation, would si-
lence the voices of frontline and environ-
mental justice communities by insulating 
them from scrutiny. Such a move would 
force Members to choose between protecting 
environmental justice communities from 
further pollution or funding the government. 
We urge you to ensure that these provi-
sions are kept out of a continuing resolution 
or any other must-pass legislation this year. 
That is a letter that comes from over 
50 of our colleagues in the House of 
Representatives. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
that letter printed in the CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows:

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER HOYER: 
The permitting and public notice and com-
ment provisions mandated by the National 
Environmental 
Policy 
Act 
(NEPA) 
are 
among the only tools local communities 
have to force careful review of federal 
projects that may have serious, long-term, 
environmental, 
and 
public 
health 
con-
sequences in those communities. Congress 
should continue to provide increased funding 
to assist federal agencies in completing the 
NEPA process but attempts to short-circuit 
or undermine the law in the name of ‘‘re-
form’’ must be opposed. 
According to media reports, there is agree-
ment to advance a series of anti-environ-
mental and anti-environmental justice pro-
visions through the House, at the behest of 
the American Petroleum Institute (API). 
These destructive provisions will allow pol-
luting manufacturing and energy develop-
ment projects to be rushed through before 
the families who are forced to live near them 
are even aware of the plans. 
The proposed legislation would restrict 
public access to the courts to seek remedies 
against illegal project development; place ar-
bitrary limits on the amount of time the 
public is given to comment on polluting 
projects; and curtail public input, environ-
mental review, and government account-
ability. Additionally, the API plan would re-
quire a certain number of harmful fossil fuel 
projects to be designated as ‘‘projects of 
strategic national importance’’ to receive 
priority federal support, assistance, and ex-
pedited environmental review. These permit-
ting ‘‘reforms’’ would weaken other impor-
tant public health protections, including the 
Clean Water Act and more. 
We remain deeply concerned that these se-
rious and detrimental permitting provisions 
will significantly and disproportionately im-
pact low-income communities, indigenous 
communities, and communities of color. The 
inclusion of these provisions in a continuing 
resolution, or any other must-pass legisla-
tion, would silence the voices of frontline 
and environmental justice communities by 
insulating them from scrutiny. Such a move 
would force Members to choose between pro-
tecting EJ communities from further pollu-
tion or funding the government. 
We urge you to ensure that these provi-
sions are kept out of a continuing resolution 
or any other must-pass legislation this year. 
Mr. SANDERS. So there we are. We 
have got 650 environmental and social 
justice organizations, representing mil-
lions of people, and we have got the en-
tire scientific community saying we 
have got to cut carbon emissions. And 
then on the other side, we have the fos-
sil fuel industry and all of their cam-
paign contributions. So that is what it 
is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4503 
September 8, 2022 
Today, I ask my colleagues to stand 
up for our kids, for our grandchildren, 
and for future generations. We have got 
to have the courage to finally tell the 
fossil fuel industry that the future of 
this planet is more important than 
their short-term profits. 
I yield the floor. 
NOMINATION OF ANDRE MATHIS 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today, 
the Senate will vote to confirm Andre 
Mathis to serve on the Sixth Circuit 
Court of Appeals. Mr. Mathis is an out-
standing nominee with extensive liti-
gation experience and deep ties to the 
Tennessee legal community. 
Over the years, he has litigated hun-
dreds of civil cases and has defended 
approximately 150 criminal cases as a 
member of the Criminal Justice Act 
panel in the Western District of Ten-
nessee. Mr. Mathis has tried 19 cases to 
verdict or final judgment and has 
briefed 23 appeals. And if confirmed, he 
would be the first Black man to sit on 
the Sixth Circuit from Tennessee. Mr. 
Mathis was rated unanimously ‘‘well 
qualified’’ by the American Bar Asso-
ciation, and he received a bipartisan 
vote in committee. Despite his exten-
sive experience, some on the other side 
have questioned Mr. Mathis’ creden-
tials, as well as his confirmation proc-
ess itself. 
Let’s set the record straight. Mr. 
Mathis is highly qualified for this job. 
And any claim that there was no mean-
ingful consultation between the White 
House and the Tennessee Senators on 
this vacancy is simply false. Over a pe-
riod of 6 months, the White House 
asked the Tennessee Senators for pro-
posed candidates, interviewed one such 
candidate, and made Mr. Mathis avail-
able to the Senators to conduct their 
own interviews. There is a clear record 
of good faith consultation regarding 
this vacancy, consultation that far ex-
ceeded that afforded by the Trump 
White House to several Democratic 
Senators. 
Remember, under the former Presi-
dent, Senate Republicans regularly 
supported circuit nominees who were 
nominated, even though the Trump 
White House did not seek any input 
from home-State Democratic Senators. 
I have said it many times: There can-
not be one standard for Republicans 
and another for Democrats. 
With Mr. Mathis’ nomination, this 
Senate has an historic opportunity to 
confirm a lifelong Tennessean and a 
person of outstanding credentials and 
integrity to serve the community that 
raised him. I look forward to sup-
porting him and urge my colleagues to 
do the same. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the 11:30 a.m. 
vote start now. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
VOTE ON MATHIS NOMINATION 
The question is, Will the Senate ad-
vise and consent to the Mathis nomina-
tion? 
Mr. PETERS. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator from New Jersey (Mr. MENEN-
DEZ), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. 
OSSOFF), and the Senator from Nevada 
(Ms. ROSEN) are necessarily absent. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from North Carolina (Mr. BURR) and 
the Senator from Alaska (Ms. MUR-
KOWSKI).

SOCIALISM 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am a 
firm believer in the American dream. 
People come to this country, perhaps 
as legal immigrants, start with little, 
invest themselves in a lot of hard work 
because they don’t have anything else 
to invest, provide for their families, 
maybe even eventually start a small 
business of their own, create jobs and a 
means to earn a livelihood for their 
employees. That is what I think most 
people think of when they think about 
the American dream. 
And it is built on an economic sys-
tem known as capitalism, as distin-
guished from socialism. And capitalism 
has lifted more people out of poverty 
than 
any 
other 
economic 
system 
known to humankind. 
There are those who have a different 
point of view. They call themselves 
democratic socialists. 
I actually have here before me the 
Democratic Socialists of America web 
page that asks the question: ‘‘What is 
democratic socialism.’’ 
They start first with the criticism of 
capitalism. They say: 
Capitalism is a system designed by the 
owning class to exploit the rest of us for 
their own profit. 
That is an incredibly cynical and, I 
think, misguided view, but that is their 
opinion. 
And they go on to say: 
We must replace it with democratic social-
ism. 
And there are a number of Members 
of Congress, notably the junior Senator 
from Vermont here who is an advocate 
for democratic socialism. I have read 
where he gave a speech explaining why 
he thinks that is a better way to go. 
And then there are a number of Mem-
bers of the House known colloquially 
as the Squad, who are members of the 
Democratic Socialists of America and 
advocate their particular point of view. 
Even though Joe Biden was elected 
President of the United States in 2020, 
he essentially has embraced the demo-
cratic socialist agenda—the Green New 
Deal, Medicare for All, free college, 
free childcare, free everything. 
Well, to no one’s surprise, once peo-
ple called it what it was and what it is, 
it didn’t make it very far. The Amer-
ican people experienced a severe stick-
er shock when they heard the cost of 
these proposals. 
One estimate pegged the cost of the 
Green New Deal at a whopping $93 tril-
lion, 
an 
absolutely 
unfathomable 
amount of money. 
And much to our Democratic col-
leagues’ surprise, families do not want 
the 
Federal 
Government 
managing 
every little detail of their lives, from 
making their childcare arrangements 
to determining which doctors they can 
see or, rather, which doctors they can’t 
see. 
Our Democratic friends found that 
socialism wasn’t as popular as they 
hoped, but they weren’t ready to give 
up on the bigger government dreams so 
they made a few marketing changes.

S4504 
September 8, 2022 
They switched branding. They adopted 
a new strategy, and now what we are 
seeing, I believe, is the new socialism. 
Now, it is not as in your face, not as 
startling as what we saw a couple of 
years ago when people openly advo-
cated democratic socialism, but the 
new socialism, I believe, is just as bad 
and even more dangerous because this 
time it is actually coming to fruition. 
You don’t need to look very far. Just 
look at President Biden’s claimed au-
thority to ‘‘forgive’’ student loans. The 
President announced that he would 
cancel student loans for millions of 
borrowers. Any family with a mortgage 
or car payment or credit card debt 
knows there is no such thing as can-
celing debt. Every dollar that was bor-
rowed will have to be paid back by 
somebody. Traditionally, and legally, 
that responsibility lies with the bor-
rower—the person who took out the 
tens of thousands or even hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in student loans 
without a thought about how they 
might eventually pay it back. 
But the President decided to throw 
tradition, personal responsibility, and, 
I would argue, the law, out the window 
in favor of a socialist approach where 
everybody chips in. 
To state the obvious, not every tax-
payer has outstanding student debt. 
Many of our fellow Americans never 
went to college. Many have very good- 
paying jobs because they have pursued 
a trade—carpentry, plumbing or the 
like or they may decide they want to 
be a teacher or perform some other 
work that doesn’t pay perhaps as well 
as a Wall Street job. 
Many people who did get a degree de-
cided they needed to work at least part 
time to help pay for their bills. And 
then many, perhaps most, decided they 
had to pay the loans back after they 
graduated, just as they had agreed to 
do. 
Still, every person without a college 
debt will be expected to shoulder the 
cost, under President Biden’s proposal, 
for someone else’s degree, regardless of 
their ability to pay it back. 
College degrees are not a public good 
that should be covered by tax dollars. 
We provide a lot of generous support 
for higher education, and we should— 
Pell grants. Many colleges and univer-
sities have huge endowments that they 
use to give scholarships and financial 
aid to students. 
But this is not something that ought 
to be placed at the foot of the Amer-
ican taxpayer, in this form certainly. 
Once somebody has agreed to pay back 
their student debt, to be able to just 
walk away from it, to me, encourages 
all sorts of irresponsible conduct and 
expectations. 
These aren’t shared expenses like 
commonly used roads, hospitals, or po-
lice departments. The individual who 
decides to borrow the money so they 
can attend college alone reaps the ben-
efits of that degree. And, in fact, if you 
do go to college, your chances of earn-
ing more income tend to go up. 
But the real kicker here is that stu-
dent loan socialism will cost the Amer-
ican taxpayer roughly half a trillion 
dollars—all to pay off the debt that the 
individuals involved knowingly and 
willingly took on. 
Of course, President Biden isn’t the 
only one forcing more socialism on the 
American people. Our Democratic col-
leagues have gotten into the action 
too. 
Last month, they passed a reckless 
tax-and-spending spree that included 
enough handouts to make Fidel Castro 
proud. 
First are the expanded Affordable 
Care Act subsidies. Originally, the sub-
sidies 
were 
provided, 
back 
when 
ObamaCare passed, to provide subsidies 
for people earning less than 400 percent 
of the Federal poverty level. 
But our Democratic colleagues last 
month not only increased the amount 
of assistance people can receive, they 
also expanded eligibility; in short, giv-
ing more people more money, regard-
less of their ability to pay for their 
own expenses, shifting that, again, out 
of the pockets of middle-class tax-
payers into the pockets of those who 
don’t need the subsidies and especially 
those who can pay for their expenses 
themselves. 
Our colleagues said this was a tem-
porary provision that was critical to 
the pandemic response, but here we 
are, a year and a half later, and they 
have already extended it. 
The people who gained insurance cov-
erage because of this proposal aren’t 
low-income families. Those individuals 
have 
already 
been 
eligible 
for 
ObamaCare. Assistance now extends to 
people earning 750 percent of the Fed-
eral poverty level—six-figure earners. 
So, here again, our Democratic col-
leagues are taking money out of the 
pocket of middle-class taxpayers, who 
are struggling with inflation and try-
ing to make ends meet, and providing 
enhanced, generous subsidies to people 
making 750 percent of the Federal pov-
erty level. 
So even as this started out as a tem-
porary fix, I don’t have any reason to 
believe that our Democratic colleagues 
will ever allow these subsidies to ex-
pire. 
In the words of Ronald Reagan, ‘‘The 
closest thing to eternal life on earth is 
a [temporary] Government Program.’’ 
Our Democratic colleagues seem to be 
intent on proving the accuracy of that 
statement. 
The Congressional Budget Office and 
the Joint Committee on Taxation esti-
mated the cost of permanent expan-
sion, and it is pretty jarring for a num-
ber of reasons. 
First is the financial cost. By ex-
panding the ObamaCare premium tax 
credits and making them permanent, 
our Democratic colleagues would add 
$248 billion to the Federal debt over the 
next decade. Of course, this will have 
an adverse effect on people with pri-
vate insurance. Under permanent ex-
pansion, some 2.3 million people will 
lose their current employer-provided 
coverage. So our country would end up 
basically paying wealthy people to lose 
their employer-sponsored healthcare so 
they can end up on a taxpayer-funded 
plan. 
This isn’t about helping the unin-
sured; it is just a backdoor way to im-
plement 
Medicare 
for 
All—another 
Democratic socialist objective. Our 
Democratic colleagues couldn’t get 
enough support for this radical plan by 
trying to build consensus, so they 
passed it with 50 votes, plus the tie- 
breaking vote of Vice President HAR-
RIS. So, bit by bit, our colleagues are 
pushing Americans closer to a single- 
payer healthcare system that they do 
not want. 
Then there is electric vehicle social-
ism—taxpayer handouts for wealthy 
car owners who buy fancy, state-of-the- 
art electric vehicles. A couple earning 
up to $300,000 a year can now count on 
taxpayers to chip in for their big-ticket 
purchase—$7,500 for a new electric ve-
hicle or $4,000 for a used one. 
Families are already being crushed 
by inflation—high grocery costs, up 13 
percent over the last year alone; high 
gasoline prices; housing prices that are 
going up dramatically. These families 
are now being burdened with the ex-
pense of helping wealthy car owners 
buy fancy, new electric vehicles when 
they can’t even afford to buy one on 
their own. Someone who can only af-
ford a quarter of a tank of gas because 
they can’t afford to fill up the whole 
tank doesn’t have $80,000 to spend on a 
fancy, 
new 
electric 
vehicle. 
Still, 
thanks to our colleagues’ electric vehi-
cle socialism, middle- and low-income 
families are getting stuck with the bill, 
which always seems to be the punch 
line. 
Well, in order to finance this new so-
cialist redistribution, our Democratic 
colleagues need more money on top of 
the debt that they are adding to. They 
needed a cash cow, so what they did is 
they turned to everybody’s favorite: 
the Internal Revenue Service. 
Our colleagues voted and passed a 
bill that will double the size of the IRS 
by adding 87,000 new agents to ensure 
that those IRS agents can squeeze 
every last penny out of hard-working 
American families. This isn’t going to 
have an impact on the top 1 percent; it 
will unleash a tidal wave of audits on 
middle-class families and small busi-
nesses. Families earning less than 
$225,000 a year are already five times as 
likely to be audited already, and this 
will just make it even worse. 
The independent Congressional Budg-
et Office confirmed that lower and mid-
dle-income taxpayers will see more IRS 
audits as a result of this move. The 
government is about to squeeze, once 
again, working families like a piece of 
coal, while our Democratic friends say: 
Well, we are just making diamonds. 
I must add, I live in a border State, 
Texas, where we have seen 2.3 million 
migrants come to the border in this 
last year and a half during President

Biden’s administration. We have seen 
108,000 
Americans 
die 
of 
drug 
overdoses, with most of those drugs 
coming across the southwestern border 
because 
the 
criminal 
organizations 
that move people and drugs across the 
border understand that if they flood 
the border with people, with migrants, 
it will divert the Border Patrol’s atten-
tion, so the drugs can come flowing 
into our country, distributed by crimi-
nal networks and street gangs who are 
responsible for most of the crime and 
gun violence in our local communities. 
Don’t you think some of the money 
that our colleagues have spent to try 
to build an army of IRS agents over 
the next 10 years—that some of that 
could have been spent to help secure 
the border, to stop some of those 
drugs? Well, unfortunately, the Biden 
administration has an open borders 
policy. They don’t actually believe in 
enforcing our immigration laws, and 
what we have seen as a consequence is 
a result of that. 
Thanks 
to 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues’ new socialist policies, Texans 
who are trying to save money to go to 
college or buy a home or prepare for re-
tirement are about to get stuck with 
the bill for massive government expan-
sion. And what is this going to do to in-
flation, which is already at a 40-year 
high? It is going to make it worse. As 
the Federal Reserve ratchets up the 
discount rate or interest rates in order 
to slow inflation, it is going to slow 
our entire economy and make it harder 
on middle-class families just trying to 
get by. 
Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime 
Minister of England, once wisely said: 
The problem with socialism is that eventu-
ally you run out of other people’s money. 
Again, that is true. We have seen ap-
proaches of socialism fail over and over 
and over again, and we have seen its 
leaders oppress their people and send 
their country into ruin. 
Well, right now, we are seeing the 
new socialism rooted in American soil 
gaining ground in Congress and the 
White House every day. This new so-
cialism may look a little bit different, 
but the goal is the same: to grow the 
role of government in the lives of ev-
eryday Americans and to burden them 
with additional taxes to pay for this 
bigger and bigger government and to 
take money from people who, by virtue 
of their hard work, were pursuing the 
American dream and transfer that 
money to someone who is well-off in 
order to advance misguided policies 
like $7,500 taxpayer subsidies for rich 
people for electric vehicles. 
Part of it is an attitude or perspec-
tive that our Democratic colleagues 
seem to have. They seem to think, We 
know better; we know better what is 
good for people than they do them-
selves. 
That is why they want to choose 
what kind of healthcare plan they get 
or what kind of childcare facilities 
families get to use. 
They want to take money out of your 
pocket and redistribute it to the cho-
sen wealthy few. 
They want to denigrate the concept 
of hard work and personal responsi-
bility that has made America the eco-
nomic success that it is because of our 
capitalist system and because of the 
American dream, again, where people 
can come here, let’s say as a legal im-
migrant, with very little, but by virtue 
of hard work and commitment and de-
termination, they can achieve their 
dream and help others achieve their 
dream at the same time—but not if you 
eliminate the concept of hard work, ac-
countability, and personal responsi-
bility and just continue to dole out 
government handouts. 
So it doesn’t really make any dif-
ference what our colleagues try to call 
it. They call it the Inflation Reduction 
Act—the bill they just passed, the 
reckless tax-and-spending bill—when 
virtually all of the outside experts 
said: No, it won’t reduce inflation, cer-
tainly not in the near term. So it 
doesn’t make any difference how they 
try to brand it; socialism is socialism, 
and it is leading our country down the 
road to a dangerous destination. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Socialism. This is all 
about socialism. I listened very care-
fully to my friend from Texas, and he 
is my friend—we work together on 
many 
things—and 
he 
believes 
the 
downfall of America is the advent of 
socialism. Well, I am not sure what 
that label means to him, but I want to 
take a look at some of the areas that 
he made a comment on. 
He thinks it is socialist for us to ex-
pand the coverage of the Affordable 
Care Act. We are down to 8 percent of 
Americans without health insurance—8 
percent. The goal is zero. We may 
never reach it. We have dramatically 
decreased the number of Americans 
without health insurance. 
Have you ever lived in a situation 
where you didn’t have health insur-
ance, when you are a new father of a 
baby with a health problem and no 
health insurance? I have been there. 
You don’t want to go to that place. 
We want to give everybody the peace 
of 
mind 
that 
they 
have 
quality 
healthcare available to them. Is that 
socialism? Is that the government 
making the decision that you are going 
to have health insurance? I don’t think 
so. Right-thinking people across this 
country, regardless of political stripe, 
believe that health insurance is crit-
ical for a happy and healthy family. 
He used the term—he said Medicare 
is a socialist objective. Ha. Try that 
one on for size in any State. Run your 
campaign on getting rid of Medicare 
and see how it works. I can tell you 
what the result will be. Medicare, over 
the last 60 years, has liberated senior 
citizens in America so that they can 
live longer and live independently and 
have quality care through the later 
years of their lives. Socialism? The 
government knows better? It is a pro-
gram which people value, just like So-
cial Security. I hope people won’t 
brand that as socialism. Many did 
when it was created. These are pro-
grams that families count on, real fam-
ilies. These programs are not socialist; 
they are as American as can be. 
The student loan program? I support 
what President Biden did. I might have 
done it a little differently. But the fact 
that he is tagging that student loan 
forgiveness to the wealth of the indi-
vidual and family is the right thing to 
do. A $10,000 student loan forgiven for 
those with individual income below 
$125,000 a year—that is not unreason-
able. That means that middle-class and 
lower income kids are going to have 
$10,000 of their student loan forgiven. If 
they happen to be on Pell grants, 
which means they really were low-in-
come families when they went to 
school, they get an additional $10,000. 
I hear all this lamenting and whining 
and crying of socialism. Where in the 
heck was this comment about social-
ism when we were giving out PPP 
loans all across America by the thou-
sands? 
It turns out that some of the 
harshest Republican critics of student 
loan forgiveness took out PPP loans. 
Do you know what that meant? They 
were forgiven. They didn’t have to pay 
them back. It was OK when they were 
receiving the money, these conserv-
ative Republicans, but the idea of some 
student burdened with student loans 
having loan forgiveness is socialism. 
Not where I am standing. 
Now, I also want to say something 
about fiscal responsibility. Do you 
know, after the reconciliation bill, 
after the Inflation Reduction Act, how 
much we will reduce the deficit this 
year? One-point-seven trillion dollars. 
How did we achieve this? Well, we 
achieved it by saying we are going to 
establish a minimum tax for certain 
corporations. Which ones? Corpora-
tions that showed an average of $1 bil-
lion a year in net profit—average of $1 
billion in net profit a year—over a 3- 
year period of time will finally have to 
pay some Federal income tax. Is that 
too much to ask? Is that socialism? No. 
It is fairness. 
In terms of the EV socialism, this is 
one where Senators ought to take care. 
When they give speeches on the floor 
about electric vehicles and electrifica-
tion, they are basically betting that 
the future is going to be a lot different 
than I see it. 
Why do we have so many electric ve-
hicles? Well, it must be a Federal man-
date. No, it wasn’t. It was a decision by 
the private sector to build electric ve-
hicles and make that the future of 
transportation in America. 
Take a look at Ford Motor Company. 
We had one of the Ford family come 
and tell us this story. They made a de-
cision that electric vehicles were part 
of their future, a big part of their fu-
ture, and they made a marketing move

that I thought was genius. What were 
the first two vehicles they electrified 
and advertised? One was the Ford F–150 
Lightning—the most popular pickup 
truck in America. A lot of White males 
drive those around. I am sure the Pre-
siding Officer knows a couple. I drive 
one myself. They are going to electrify 
that vehicle, and they can’t produce 
them fast enough to meet the demand. 
So the people who many Republicans 
feel are the national allies on this sub-
ject are waiting in line to buy a Light-
ning, an F–150. 
Then what was the other car they 
were going to electrify? A Mustang. 
Well, I just want to tell you that cer-
tain age groups still dream about Mus-
tangs. I can remember in 1964 when 
they put them on the market for the 
first time. They are going to electrify 
them. These cars are wildly popular, 
and they can’t build them fast enough. 
So the Republicans who are betting 
that this is just a fad and it is going to 
go away are dead wrong on this. The 
private sector’s production of auto-
mobiles is moving toward electric vehi-
cles in a big way, and it is going to 
happen. 
I would say the Republicans who be-
lieve it is pure socialism to have elec-
tric vehicles in our future should get 
out of the way because those electric 
vehicles are going to run all over you 
in no time at all. 
Also, this idea of 87,000 IRS agents 
was invented by one Senator who came 
to the floor and made his calculation. 
It was like the death squads. They pick 
up a phrase, and they say this is the re-
ality—87,000 IRS agents. That isn’t 
even close to the truth. 
What we know is this: The vast ma-
jority of Americans and American fam-
ilies pay their taxes legally and on 
time, and they should be respected for 
doing that. Who we are looking for are 
the people who don’t do that—either 
don’t pay their taxes or don’t pay what 
they owe. Those people are not accept-
ing their fair share of responsibility for 
this Nation’s future. 
The IRS has been starved in the past 
of basic things—computerization, for 
example, and agents to do audits. The 
President has made it clear that his 
target is never going to be working 
families. His target is those who are 
defying the law and defying the system 
of taxation. He believes they should 
pay their fair share, and I couldn’t 
agree with him more. 
In terms of this idea—of this socialist 
mantra—that we know better, that the 
government knows better, it is inter-
esting when it comes to personal lib-
erty and freedom. When you get into 
another area, like the reproductive 
freedom for women, exactly the oppo-
site position is being taken by many 
people on the other side of the aisle. 
Here is the point I want to make: We 
considered the reconciliation bill just a 
few weeks ago. We had 41 straight roll-
calls. I know because I was on the floor 
for every one of them. At the end of the 
day, we passed the reconciliation bill, 
the Inflation Reduction Act. What has 
happened since? Well, if you want to 
call it socialism, let me tell you what 
our socialist moves have done so far. 
Tomorrow, President Joseph Biden is 
going to New Albany, OH, to join the 
CEO of Intel in breaking ground on a 
new multibillion-dollar semiconductor 
plant. It is one of the largest invest-
ments of its kind in American history, 
and it is going to create thousands of 
good-paying 
jobs 
for 
construction 
workers and engineers. Over the next 
decade, Intel plans to transform New 
Albany into one of the largest semicon-
ductor manufacturing sites in the 
world. That is a big shift from the days 
when we shipped microchip production 
overseas to Asia. 
Socialism? Is this Joe Biden’s brand 
of socialism to open up a plant that fi-
nally is going to make computer chips, 
which are absolutely essential to the 
growth of our economy? 
This investment in America’s future 
was made possible by the CHIPS and 
Science Act, and I want to give credit 
where it is due. There were some Re-
publicans who stepped forward and 
joined us in that effort. I wish there 
would have been more. I wish they all 
would have been with us in this effort. 
We believed—and the President backed 
us up—that if we were going to make 
this investment in semiconductor chips 
for our future, America was going to be 
there. I don’t think that was inspired 
by socialism; that was inspired by com-
mon sense. 
Yesterday, the New York Times re-
ported that, in the weeks since the In-
flation Reduction Act was signed into 
law—and that is the one with 41 roll-
calls—companies throughout the coun-
try have unveiled ‘‘a series of big-tick-
et projects to kick-start our clean en-
ergy future.’’ 
Socialism—a future that will be 
made in America by American work-
ers? 
I would like to remind everyone that 
we passed that law without a single Re-
publican vote. Not one Republican Sen-
ator would join us in this effort. 
Well, what has happened in the 4 
weeks since we passed it? 
Well, Toyota announced it is going to 
invest billions of dollars in manufac-
turing batteries for those electric and 
hybrid vehicles here in America. That 
has happened since we passed the bill. 
One solar company, named First 
Solar, announced another billion-dollar 
investment to build a new facility in 
the Southeast. 
Socialism? 
Honda, LG, Samsung—all of them an-
nounced billions of dollars in invest-
ments to make components for electric 
vehicles right here in America. 
In West Virginia, one company plans 
to build a nearly 500,000-square foot 
electric battery factory. And who is 
going to be working in it? Well, they 
are targeting laid-off coal miners. They 
want to put them to work first. 
Socialism? 
Thanks to the Inflation Reduction 
Act, these jobs aren’t going overseas 
anymore. They are staying right here 
in America. 
New 
manufacturing 
projects 
are 
lighting up across the country, like a 
constellation of hope, marking a new 
era of renewal and renaissance for 
American families. I am glad to say 
that a big piece of it is taking place in 
the Midwest. 
Earlier this week, in my home State 
of Illinois, the company T/CCI an-
nounced it is going to invest millions 
of dollars into retooling its facility in 
Decatur, IL, to make compressors for— 
hold onto your socialist hat—electric 
vehicles. Here they come again. And 
our 
Governor, 
Pritzker, 
announced 
that the State will work alongside 
Richland Community College to estab-
lish a climate center for innovation 
and research—an innovation hub. 
Socialism? 
This is a chance for the Decatur com-
munity to play its part in an electric 
vehicle revolution. Most importantly, 
once again, these investments are 
going to create good-paying jobs right 
here in America. For cities like Deca-
tur, this is a lifeline. It wasn’t that 
long ago that the city was struggling 
with population decline. Now it is a 
new story. 
Under President Biden and a Demo-
cratic Congress, we are leaving no town 
behind. We are investing in the future 
of every community from Chicago to 
Decatur. In doing so, we are honoring 
America’s history as the land of oppor-
tunity. 
There is a statue in downtown Deca-
tur. It is a site where it says that a 21- 
year-old, barefoot Abraham Lincoln de-
livered his very first political speech 
supporting the Whig platform. Just 2 
years after that speech, Lincoln an-
nounced his first campaign for public 
office in my home county of San-
gamon. He ran for the legislature. 
So, as we celebrate the new funding 
for jobs and development coming to 
cities like Decatur, I find it interesting 
that one of the first policies Lincoln 
supported was known as internal im-
provements. He announced at his first 
run for office: 
Time and experience have verified to a 
demonstration, the public utility of internal 
improvements. That the poorest and most 
thinly populated countries would be greatly 
benefitted by the opening of good roads, and 
in the clearing of navigable streams within 
their limits, is what no person will deny. 
The challenges we face in America 
today are more sophisticated, but we 
also passed an infrastructure bill, the 
largest in the history of the United 
States. 
Under the previous President, Donald 
Trump, he promised every week was 
going to be infrastructure week. Unfor-
tunately, his response was so weak 
there 
was 
never 
an 
infrastructure 
week—never during his Presidency— 
and that is a fact. President Biden 
turned that around, and we passed an 
infrastructure bill that 
is 
putting 
America back to work, as it should. It 
is about time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S4507 
September 8, 2022 
For decades, the Republicans have 
prayed to the altar of trickle-down eco-
nomics. They call every initiative that 
we have on the Democratic side social-
ism: Social Security, socialism; Medi-
care, socialism; this idea of leading 
into the electric vehicle revolution, so-
cialism; the government knows best. 
Well, I will tell you they are wrong. 
What we see is leadership and leader-
ship that is long overdue. We can’t 
leave working families behind in this 
country. Four decades of cutting taxes 
for the rich on some wild theory that 
this was somehow going to lift all 
boats just turned out to be false. 
I will tell you this: Roads and bridges 
crumbling beneath our feet, genera-
tions of good-paying jobs going over-
seas, the world’s wealthiest trying to 
save a few bucks, and skyrocketing 
economic inequality is not American. 
Fixing it is not socialism; it is just 
fairness. 
The last President spent 4 years de-
claring infrastructure week but had 
nothing to show for it. In less than 2 
years, President Biden and the Demo-
crats have delivered on their promise 
of rebuilding America and putting 
American workers back to work. We 
have had the largest growth and job 
creation—ever in the history of the 
United States—in the last year and a 
half under President Biden, and 660,000 
of those jobs are manufacturing jobs— 
real jobs with a good paycheck. We are 
investing in the interest of industries 
of the future. More importantly, we are 
investing in American families. 
The policies we have enacted during 
this Congress are going to help move 
America forward. Together, they rep-
resent a new vision for America’s fu-
ture: roads and bridges, microchips, 
wind turbines, deep research into ad-
vanced 
technologies 
like 
quantum 
computing. What does it mean for the 
American people? Take a look at the 
auto industry. Today, the industry, 
which with Barack Obama as President 
was saved despite Republican opposi-
tion, is an industry in which major 
manufacturers are betting big on its 
electric future. 
Members of the Republican Senate 
caucus may not see electric vehicles in 
the future, but they have closed their 
eyes if they are in that position. 
With the infrastructure package, we 
are going to create good, good jobs— 
union jobs—of fixing and building our 
roads and installing charging stations 
all across America. 
With the CHIPS and Science Act, we 
are shoring up the domestic supply of 
semiconductors so we can assemble the 
next generation of electric vehicles in 
American factories. That chips bill 
also authorized billions of dollars in 
funding for scientific research—labora-
tories like Argonne and Fermilab. This 
research even has the potential to 
unlock new discoveries in battery tech-
nology. 
Now, with the Inflation Reduction 
Act, we are making life more afford-
able for working families. That is not 
just to bring down costs of prescription 
drugs and energy bills; it will help 
lower the costs of American-made elec-
tric vehicles so more families can buy 
one. 
This is the Democratic platform in 
action: building products and compo-
nents we depend on here at home, pio-
neering technology breakthroughs to 
change the world, and leveling the 
economy so that every family has a 
fighting chance. Thanks to the policies 
we have passed so far under the Biden 
administration, we are rolling. 
I do want to tell you this for the 
record: On my way to catch the plane 
at the airport in St. Louis earlier this 
week, I saw gasoline for sale at $3.46 a 
gallon. That is still high, but it is a 
heck of a lot better than the $5-plus we 
were paying just a few weeks ago. Is 
that socialism? I think it is the govern-
ment at work, and this President has 
done everything he can to bring down 
the cost of living that families face. 
It is still a challenge. We haven’t 
conquered it, but we are moving in the 
right direction, and this economy is 
moving in the right direction. I wish 
we could have had some Republican 
support for that effort. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I 
want to go into some comments about 
some things that I heard from Oklaho-
mans in August—in, thankfully, a 
deep-breath moment when we were not 
in session here for a little while. But I 
first need to just make a couple of 
quick comments for folks who might 
have just heard my colleague before, 
from Illinois, saying that Republicans 
believe that electric vehicles are so-
cialism if you promote electric vehicles 
and that we oppose electric vehicles 
and electrification. Actually, I just 
have to make a quick comment about 
that. 
I don’t hear that Republicans are in 
opposition to electric vehicles. I hear 
Republicans in opposition to handing 
companies billions and billions of dol-
lars of taxpayer money and saying: If 
you will produce electric vehicles, then 
we are going to give you these billions 
of dollars to be able to do it. 
I also hear Republicans, like myself, 
in opposition and saying: 85 percent of 
the world’s lithium, which runs these 
electric vehicles, comes from China. 
So, until we can actually get our own 
supply 
of 
energy 
for 
lithium, 
we 
shouldn’t be running toward electric 
vehicles, because if you run toward 
electric vehicles and then you are de-
pendent on communist China for your 
fuel, that is a bad idea. 
I also hear Republicans saying: Our 
infrastructure is not ready for this. 
This is not some fairytale. Today, in 
California, they are telling people to 
turn up their thermostats because they 
don’t have enough electricity, and 
don’t charge your electric vehicles. 
So what I hear is a little bit of com-
mon sense on our side of the aisle to 
say: We don’t have a problem with elec-
tric vehicles. People should be able to 
choose to drive whatever vehicle they 
want to be able to drive and that the 
consumer will actually purchase. But 
when you hand companies billions of 
dollars and say that you only get this 
money ‘‘if’’ and if you push people to 
use a fuel that is dominantly coming 
from a communist nation and we don’t 
have the infrastructure to actually 
support it but say you need to get it 
anyway, we think that is a challenge. 
The market is going to drive this. 
People will make choices, and the mar-
ket will be able to keep up. But when 
government arbitrarily pushes that 
forward faster, that causes a problem 
in our economy, and we have seen it al-
ready. 
As I traveled around the State, our 
State, like several other States, goes 
back to school early. It is always funny 
to me when I return after Labor Day 
and people are talking about their kids 
are going to school this week. I always 
smile and say: Our kids returned to 
school 3 weeks ago, actually. 
August is a great time to be able to 
see families getting organized, people 
heading back to school, talking to 
teachers and superintendents and talk-
ing about their hope and prayer for a 
normal school year, where there aren’t 
mask mandates and all the things com-
ing down on them. 
It is time for me to actually, some 
evenings, be able to stand out in the 
yard and be able to talk to my neigh-
bors. It is great to just be able to visit 
and catch up, to be able to chat with 
someone in my Sunday school class 
and to be able to hold their young child 
and to be able to look in the face of a 
new baby. 
I had the opportunity to be able to be 
home and to be able to stand in a fu-
neral home with a law enforcement of-
ficer who was murdered in the line of 
duty. 
It was an opportunity to be able to 
talk to some of our electric coopera-
tives that are getting power to our 
rural areas and making such a dif-
ference. 
It was an opportunity to stand and 
pray with a cancer survivor in Guymon 
who has had a really—the past couple 
of years, it has been tough. 
It was an opportunity to be able to 
visit with an aerospace company in 
Oklahoma—in fact, several that are 
doing the technology and the innova-
tion that are making quite a difference 
in both our national security and in 
our own aerospace safety and to visit 
with small business owners who are 
making things work in a very tough 
economy based on their work, not 
based on what is happening in Wash-
ington, DC—based on their work. 
August is an opportunity to go visit 
the stockyards and feedlots and get a 
chance to be able to talk to folks who 
are, every day, making our food supply 
work. It is an opportunity to be able to 
visit with big companies based in Okla-
homa that have large facilities like

Amazon and Macy’s—major companies 
that are out there that are doing busi-
ness across our State and, quite frank-
ly, to be able to interact with compa-
nies that are just as large that are also 
coming toward my great State of Okla-
homa because it is a great place to be 
able to do business. 
There were individuals whom I got a 
chance to be able to visit with in the 
fire training center, many of them vol-
unteers who come to this fire training 
center because they want to be able to 
learn better about how to be able to 
fight fire because this is literally 
neighbors taking care of neighbors. I 
hear so much conversation in Wash-
ington, DC, about how Washington, DC, 
is solving all the problems in the coun-
try. But when I meet with volunteer 
firefighters, they know full well it is 
everybody taking care of everybody’s 
neighbors, doing what they can to be 
able to help each other. 
I had the opportunity to both sit in 
church and watch 25 people get bap-
tized on one Sunday and see life change 
literally happening before my eyes. 
I also had the opportunity to be able 
to visit with folks in nursing homes 
and visit with their staff who are really 
struggling under some of the mandates 
that are on them still. I have to tell 
you, for many of the families who are 
living with nursing homes and are deal-
ing with CMS right now and some of 
the mandates that are still on them, it 
seems like life is returning to normal 
for many places, but the mandates are 
still on prisons, nursing homes, as-
sisted living facilities, and Head Start 
facilities. For those kids and for those 
seniors, it is tough, and they are look-
ing for relief from DC. 
I had the opportunity to be able to go 
through No Man’s Land Beef Jerky, 
some of the best beef jerky in the coun-
try. You ought to try it sometime for 
folks who haven’t. You walk through 
No Man’s Land Beef Jerky, and there is 
a lot of meat there, let me just tell 
you, as they are hand-trimming each 
section and dehydrating and preparing 
it for customers all over the country— 
quite frankly, many places around the 
world. 
I was able to visit VA centers, talk 
with their staff, talk with veterans 
who are there getting care, able to go 
to our military bases and able to talk 
with leadership there about what do 
they need because they work every day 
to be able to protect our Nation’s fu-
ture. I was able to visit our inland 
water ports. Yes, there are ports in 
Oklahoma. For those of you all who are 
not tracking geography, Oklahoma has 
the northernmost inland ports in the 
country, and it is a vital link to the 
Midwest, getting fertilizer and getting 
wheat out, taking care of heavy steel 
and supplies. They are a vital part of 
our technology and of our transpor-
tation. 
There are too many places to be able 
to name, but I do have to be able to 
call out some amazing folks who are in 
New Leaf. New Leaf is a group of peo-
ple who have dedicated their lives to 
helping the developmentally disabled. 
There are hundreds of people who serve 
there, serving hundreds of people. 
These are developmentally disabled 
adults who have hopes and aspirations. 
They want to work. They have dreams 
and goals for their life as well. They 
want to get married; they want to en-
gage; and they want to have friends. 
They are a group of people who have 
wrapped around these families and are 
blessing them in ways that most folks 
would never know. It is neighbors help-
ing neighbors. 
As I traveled around the State, lit-
erally from Guymon all the way across 
to the east of my State—as I traveled 
across the State, I heard the same com-
ment over and over and over again: 
When is inflation going to come down? 
When is the cost of living going to get 
better? 
From every small business that I 
talked to, they would talk about sup-
ply chain issues and the costs and the 
contracts and the prices that they are 
selling things for and the prices that 
they are getting things for and the 
challenges they face. 
NFIB works with a lot of small busi-
nesses around the country. They do an 
optimism index every year. Thirty- 
seven percent of small business owners 
now report their single biggest issue as 
a small business owner is inflation. 
I got into a lot of conversations with 
a lot of folks, as probably many people 
in this room did. But I can’t even begin 
to tell you the number of conversations 
I got into that, within minutes, the 
conversation turned to the price of 
eggs, to say: Wow, have you bought 
eggs yet? They seem to go up every sin-
gle week. 
If it feels that way for folks, I can 
tell you it actually is that way for 
folks. The data continues to be able to 
show that. Studies show, in Oklahoma, 
relative to January of 2021, Oklaho-
mans are paying $593 more a month 
right now than they were just in Janu-
ary 2021. That equals out to $7,115 more 
a year that each family is paying this 
year than they were 2 years ago—$7,115. 
This is a real effect on families. 
While all of us are grateful that the 
price of gas seems to be coming down 
little by little—everyone is celebrating 
that gas prices are only $3.50 now—we 
understand that just a year and a half 
ago, gas prices were a dollar and a half 
less than what they are now. 
The single biggest effect on our econ-
omy right now—single biggest effect— 
is the price of gasoline and the price of 
energy. As energy prices rise, and they 
continue to stay high, it continues to 
drive the cost of every other product 
because you have got to move products 
to actually be sold or to be manufac-
tured. 
Gasoline right now, this July, is 44 
percent higher than it was last July— 
44 percent. And while it has come 
down, we forget how fast and how high 
it rose. People seem to be relieved now 
that it is only three and a half bucks, 
knowing that that is 44 percent higher 
than it was a single year ago. 
The cost of breakfast cereal is 16 per-
cent higher than it was a year ago. The 
cost of chicken is 18 percent higher 
than it was just a year ago. The cost of 
milk is 16 percent higher than what it 
was a year ago. The cost of coffee is 20 
percent higher than what it was a year 
ago. The cost of butter is 22 percent 
higher than what it was a year ago. 
Baby food is 15 percent higher than 
what it was a year ago. And just house-
hold cleaning products, it is 11 percent 
higher than what it was a year ago. 
For many people who hear this out-
side of this room, they would say: Yes, 
all those things are true. They are ob-
vious. But I have yet to run into a fam-
ily, as I traveled around my State and 
engaged with so many great Oklaho-
mans—I didn’t hear a single one say: I 
am so grateful that we are going to 
have more IRS audits in the next cou-
ple of years because that is going to 
bring down inflation. I didn’t have one. 
I didn’t have anyone say: I am so glad 
there are going to be additional sub-
sidies for electric vehicles because that 
is going to bring down the cost of eggs. 
There is a real concern here. People 
are worried because they don’t know 
what happens next. 
For retirees, the latest study that 
came out, $3.4 trillion—$3.4 trillion— 
has been lost from IRAs in the past 
year—$3.4 trillion. So the mix that we 
have right now are individuals who are 
worried about just paying for the next 
thing, when the cost of living for them 
is $7,000 more this year than it was last 
year, just trying to be able to keep up. 
And the challenge for retirees, watch-
ing the value of their retirement go 
down, as many who are on a fixed in-
come also realize, the costs have gone 
up dramatically. It is real, and people 
do feel it. 
While in Oklahoma, I interacted with 
lots of folks who are neighbors taking 
care of neighbors. There is a very real 
concern about Washington, DC, and 
what they will do to them rather than 
for them, and people are worried about 
it. 
I would say we, as leaders, have a re-
sponsibility to be able to set a direc-
tion to be able to take care of other 
people’s money—that is the tax dollars 
that are there; that is other people’s 
money—to be able to manage the debt 
of this Nation that has accelerated dra-
matically in the past several years, 
much of it due to COVID, much of it 
not. We have some responsibilities to 
take care of. I hope everyone had the 
opportunity to be able to listen to peo-
ple in their own States and to be able 
to hear what I was able to hear in Au-
gust. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

REMEMBERING QUEEN ELIZABETH II 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today, 
we take a solemn and somber pause. A 
few minutes ago, we learned the sad 
news of the passing of Her Majesty 
Queen Elizabeth II, the longest reign-
ing Monarch in British history. I join 
with Leader MCCONNELL, with my Sen-
ate colleagues, and with all Americans 
to offer deepest sympathies and pray-
ers to the royal family and to the peo-
ple of the United Kingdom. 
I never had the honor of meeting Her 
Majesty the Queen myself, but I ad-
mired much about her until the very 
end. It is hard to fathom that today we 
have to say goodbye because, after all, 
most Americans—to say nothing of the 
British people—have never lived in a 
world without Her Majesty the Queen. 
It is a marvel to think that in the 
same year of Her Majesty’s coronation, 
Harry Truman was in the White House. 
The world was still coming out of the 
shadow of the Second World War, en-
tering a bold, uncertain, unchartered 
future. 
In her time, she came to know 15 dif-
ferent Prime Ministers, 14 U.S. Presi-
dents, traveled to well over 100 coun-
tries, and made over 200 official state 
visits. She was the first British Mon-
arch ever to address a joint session of 
Congress. And thanks to her, the spe-
cial relationship between the United 
States and the UK gained even more 
special significance. 
Her reign saw the dawn of the atomic 
age, the age of the internet, the fall of 
the Soviet Union, an unprecedented 
global pandemic. She didn’t just wit-
ness the great turns of history; she 
helped shape them over the seven dec-
ades—seven decades—of her reign. And 
every step of the way, she was pre-
cisely the kind of leader the moment 
demanded. 
In times of hardship, she was both 
strong and comforting. In times of joy, 
she was gracious and dignified. She was 
a rock, the living embodiment of the 
virtues that lie at the core of the na-
tion she so proudly led. I dare say we 
will never see a leader quite like her 
for as long as we live. 
So, today, we join the people of the 
UK and the royal family in mourning 
the loss of Her Majesty the Queen. May 
she rest in peace.

REMEMBERING SAMUEL F. 
SANDOVAL, SR. 
Mr. HEINRICH. Mr. President, it is 
my honor to recognize the heroic life of 
Samuel F. Sandoval, Sr., who passed 
away on July 29, 2022. Mr. Sandoval had 
been one of the last four remaining 
Navajo Code Talkers who served during 
World War II and whose unbreakable 
code using the Navajo language deliv-
ered 
military 
communications 
and 
played an indispensable role in Amer-
ica’s victory in the Pacific. 
Mr. 
Sandoval 
was 
Naasht’e´zhi 
Dine’e´sh, Zuni Clan, and born for 
Tl’a´a´shchı´’ı´, Red Cheek People. He was 
born on October 24, 1923, in Kimbeto, 
NM, near Chaco Canyon and graduated 
in 1942 from the Navajo Methodist Mis-
sion School in Farmington, NM, where 
he was discouraged from using the Nav-
ajo language. 
He enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps 
in March of 1943 and completed his 
basic training Marine Corps Recruit 
Depot in San Diego, CA, where the 
original 29 Code Talkers had arrived 
the previous fall. After transferring to 
Camp Pendleton in Oceanside, CA, he 
and other Code Talkers created more 
than 600 codes using words from the 
Navajo Language. As one of the 418 
Navajo Code Talkers, he used the 813- 
word Navajo code to securely send and 
receive military communications. 
Mr. Sandoval served in five combat 
tours, including Guadalcanal, Bougain-
ville, Guam, Peleliu, and Okinawa, be-
fore his honorable discharge in Janu-
ary 1946. In recognition of his military 
service, Mr. Sandoval received the 
Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon, a 
Combat Action Ribbon, a China Service 
Medal, a World War II Victory Medal, a 
Navy Occupation Service Medal with 
Asia Clasp, and an Asiatic-Pacific 
Campaign Medal with a silver star, in 
lieu of five bronze stars. 
After the war, Mr. Sandoval earned a 
degree in substance abuse counseling 
from 
the 
University 
of 
Utah. 
He 
worked for many years as a counselor, 
assisting Navajo people experiencing 
alcohol addiction and substance use 
disorders at his clinic, To-Tah Alcohol 
Counseling. 
Like 
other 
Code 
Talkers, 
Mr. 
Sandoval had strict orders not to dis-
cuss their secret mission during the 
war or until it was declassified decades 
later in 1968. After their role was re-
vealed publicly, Mr. Sandoval and his 
late brother, Merrill Sandoval, took 
immense pride in their experiences as 
Code Talkers and worked to educate 
the public about their contributions. 
Mr. Sandoval told his personal account 
in both a book and documentary titled, 
‘‘Naz Bah Ei Bijei: Heart of a Warrior.’’ 
In 2001, Mr. Sandoval received a Con-
gressional Silver Medal from President 
George W. Bush in recognition of his 
service as a Code Talker. Earlier this 
year, during his last trip away from 
home, Mr. Sandoval received American 
Spirit Award for Bravery from the Na-
tional WWII Museum in New Orleans, 
LA. He was looking forward to attend-
ing the groundbreaking for the Navajo 
Code Talker Museum in Tse Bonito, 
NM, which took place on National Nav-
ajo Code Talkers Day on August 14. 
My thoughts are with his widow, 
Malula, his surviving siblings, his six 
children, his 33 grandchildren, his 33 
great-grandchildren, and all those on 
the Navajo Nation and in New Mexico 
who he inspired through his incredible 
life of service.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING SANDY WILLIAMS 
∑ Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last 
weekend, 10 people were tragically 
killed in a plane crash near Whidbey 
Island, WA, sending waves of shock and 
sadness 
through 
the 
entire 
State. 
Today, I join with communities across 
Washington in honoring their memo-
ries and grieving this immeasurable 
loss for their families and friends. 
One of these 10 people was Sandy Wil-
liams, a beloved member of the eastern 
Washington community, and a power-
ful civil rights advocate who worked to 
lift up Black voices across the State. 
Sandy Williams was born and raised in 
Spokane Valley and, starting at a 
young age, worked hard in pursuit of 
equality and justice. In fact, when her 
middle school offered a home econom-
ics class for girls but wouldn’t allow 
them to take the shop class with the 
boys, she refused to take no for and an-
swer and pushed back until she and 
other girls were allowed to take shop. 
Her fight for fairness and equality 
would lead her to leave an indelible 
mark on eastern Washington which she 
loved so dearly, in so many ways. 
Sandy helped establish the Pride 
Center at Eastern Washington Univer-
sity to support LGBTQ+ youth. Sandy 
also served eastern Washington as its 
member of the Washington State Com-
mission on African American Affairs. 
And she worked nonstop to lift Black 
voices and create a community where 
everyone is heard, included, and em-
powered. 
In 2016, Sandy started publishing a 
newspaper called ‘‘Black Lens’’—that 
she ran out of her home—to tell the

stories that mattered most to Black 
Washingtonians. Sandy was dedicated 
to a vision of eastern Washington 
where Black people could come to-
gether as a community and worked 
hard to make that vision a reality by 
helping create the Carl Maxey Center. 
The Carl Maxey Center is a testament 
to Sandy’s legacy; it remains a hub of 
economic, social, and cultural activity 
in Spokane. It provides rental assist-
ance, social services, business support, 
resources for students, and more. It 
helps plan beloved events like Unity in 
the Community and the Riverfront 
Park Christmas Tree Lighting Cere-
mony. And it will continue to be an ex-
ample of Sandy’s steadfast commit-
ment to community. 
Through her advocacy, through her 
example, and through her action to 
make dreams realities, Sandy made 
Washington State a fairer, more just 
place, and her legacy and impact will 
endure for generations to come. 
Sandy is survived by her daughter 
Renika, her brother Rick, and many 
loved ones in Spokane.∑

RECOGNIZING THE HITCHING POST 
AND OLD COUNTRY STORE OF 
AURORA, KENTUCKY 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as a rank-
ing member of the Senate Committee 
on Small Business and Entrepreneur-
ship, each week I recognize an out-
standing Kentucky small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize The Hitching 
Post and Old Country Store of Aurora, 
KY, as the Senate Small Business of 
the Week. 
For generations, Land Between the 
Lakes has been one of the premier 
travel destinations in Western Ken-
tucky. The gorgeous strip of land nes-
tled between lakes Barkley and Ken-
tucky contains breathtaking nature 
scenes, a plethora of outdoor activities, 
and numerous local businesses that 
visitors travel from far and wide to 
enjoy. A local favorite among those 
many businesses is The Hitching Post 
and Old Country Store. Located on 4 
and a half acre property on the western 
side of Kentucky Lake, The Hitching 
Post and Old Country Store first 
opened their doors to customers in 
1941. The structures themselves are 
over 200 years old, but starting with 
the Perryman family in 1941, three 
families of stewards have maintained 
these stores in all their historic glory. 
Today, the stores are owned by Su 
Festen and her husband Tom Trenkle, 
who ventured south from Illinois to 
buy the property in 2008. In the years 
since, Su will tell you that she has 
grown a Southern heart, which is more 
than evident in the warm hospitality 
she shows to all who dawn her doors. 
Though The Hitching Post and the 
Old Country Store needed some notable 
maintenance when it came into Tom 
and Su’s hands, they both decided to 
maintain the old-fashioned nature to 
the interior of the stores. Su was in-
spired to perpetuate the historic feel-
ing of the of the property on her first 
day on the job as one of the very first 
patrons to come in was a fourth-gen-
eration customer with an abundance of 
love for these two stores. From then 
on, Su and her husband ensured that 
The Hitching Post and Old Country 
Store would be a place where everyone 
from 
out 
of 
town 
travelers 
to 
generational 
customers 
and 
locals 
could come to reminisce, remember, 
and enjoy the simpler things that only 
a small-town small business could pro-
vide. 
When travelers traverse the beautiful 
land between lakes Barkley and Ken-
tucky, they are confronted with the 
abounding beauty of the landscape sur-
rounding them. Given this gorgeous 
scenery, it would be easy to overlook 
the charming shops around them. This 
is not the case for patrons of The 
Hitching Post and its neighboring Old 
Country Store. Customers are struck 
by the old-fashioned interior which 
harkens back to memories from a sim-
pler time. From the stacks of local 
fruit preserves and canned country fa-
vorites, to spiced apple cider, cus-
tomers are reminded of a time when 
local produce was the all that was 
available before the days of instant 
gratification fostered by online shop-
ping and rapid delivery. 
Not only are the two stores brim-
ming over with charm, the two provide 
a wide variety of products to satisfy 
every traveler. If you are looking for 
something sweet to snack on for the 
trip home, you will find a delightful se-
lection of homemade fudge and crates 
filled to the brim with saltwater taffy 
and 
old-fashioned 
candy. 
However, 
there is one offering that sticks out 
above all the others. As soon as you 
enter the Old Country Store, your eyes 
are immediately drawn to the towering 
wall of old-fashioned glass bottled 
sodas that line the back wall of the 
store. With over 200 different flavors of-
fered, ranging from classic root beers 
to seasonal soda recipes, it is nearly 
impossible to choose what unique sodas 
to try, which is one of the many rea-
sons why customers often return to 
The Hitching Post and Old Country 
Store year after year. To brighten up 
the weekends of their customers, Su 
and Tom created their weekly All- 
American Soda Showdown. From May 
to September, the most indecisive or 
adventurous customer can come in 
Sunday afternoons to sample both new 
and old flavors of soda the Old Country 
Store has to offer. 
However, both The Hitching Post and 
Old Country Stores have more than 
just sweet treats for the car ride home. 
Customers can also find a collection of 
retro toys and trinkets that introduce 
new generations to the beloved pas-
times of their parents and grand-
parents. Family of some of the pre-
vious owners of the stores were avid 
collectors of unique items and oddities. 
Customers are encouraged to peruse 
their treasure trove of antiques and 
vintage novelties great for giving as 
gifts or keeping for home decor. One 
notable item on display is a moonshine 
still designed by Casey Jones, a famous 
Prohibition-era 
moonshiner 
whose 
brew was enjoyed by notable mob-boss 
Al Capone. Even upon exiting the 
stores visitors will encounter an array 
of impressive chainsaw carvings of for-
est creatures and mythical characters 
hand-crafted by talented local artisans. 
There is something about family va-
cations that is uniquely American. The 
places that families travel for both re-
laxation and recreation hold a special 
place in the hearts of those who visit 
them. All across the country are areas 
like Land Between the Lakes whose 
beauty is enjoyed by generations of 
families who bring their children and 
grandchildren to relish in the wonder 
they themselves appreciated as chil-
dren. Part of this landscape are small 
businesses like The Hitching Post and 
Old Country Store that bravely con-
front the onward march of time. 
Though their original customers have 
aged over the 81 years that they have 
been open, the stores themselves re-
main ageless, as they look just like 
they did since that first year of oper-
ation in 1941. For decades, these stores 
have been serving local Kentuckians 
and travelers alike, and it is clear that 
they will be cherished for generations 
to 
come. 
Congratulations 
to 
Tom 
Trenkle and Su Festen, along with the 
entire team at The Hitching Post and 
Old Country Store. I look forward to 
seeing your continued growth and suc-
cess in Kentucky.∑

Mr. 
HOEVEN, 
Mr. 
BLUMENTHAL, Ms. WARREN, Mr. KING, 
Mr. MARKEY, Mr. HICKENLOOPER, Mr. 
CASEY, and Mr. BOOZMAN) submitted 
the following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 754 
Whereas establishing an annual ‘‘National 
Warrior Call Day’’ will draw attention to the 
members of the Armed Forces whose connec-
tion to one another is key to the veterans 
and first responders in the United States 
who may be dangerously disconnected from 
family, friends, and support systems; 
Whereas the rate of suicide for members of 
the Armed Forces serving on active duty in-
creased from 20.3 per 100,000 individuals in 
2015 to 28.7 per 100,000 individuals in 2020; 
Whereas the suicide rate for veterans has 
steadily increased since 2006, with 6,261 vet-
erans taking their own lives in 2019; 
Whereas, after adjusting for sex and age, 
the rate of veteran suicide in 2019 was 31.6 
per 100,000 individuals, substantially higher 
than the rate among adults in the United 
States who are not veterans at 16.8 per 
100,000 individuals; 
Whereas more veterans have died by sui-
cide in the last 10 years than members of the 
Armed Forces who died from combat in Viet-
nam; 
Whereas many of the veterans who take 
their own lives have had no contact with the 
Department of Veterans Affairs; 
Whereas the Coronavirus Disease 2019 
(COVID–19) pandemic continues to lead to in-
creased isolation and disconnection, further 
exacerbating mental and physical ailments 
such as post-traumatic stress disorder and 
traumatic brain injury; 
Whereas invisible wounds linked to an un-
derlying and undiagnosed traumatic brain 
injury can mirror many mental health condi-
tions, a problem that can be addressed 
through appropriate medical treatment; 
Whereas additional research is needed to 
highlight the connection between traumatic 
brain injury as a root cause of invisible 
wounds and suicide by members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans; and 
Whereas November 13, 2022, would be an ap-
propriate day to designate as ‘‘National War-
rior Call Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates November 13, 2022, as ‘‘Na-
tional Warrior Call Day’’; 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States, especially members of the Armed 
Forces serving on active duty and veterans, 
to call up a warrior, have an honest con-
versation, and connect them with support, 
understanding that making a warrior call 
could save a life; and 
(3) implores all individuals in the United 
States to recommit themselves to engaging 
with members of the Armed Forces through 
‘‘National Warrior Call Day’’ and other con-
structive efforts that result in solutions and 
treatment for the invisible scars they carry. 
SENATE RESOLUTION 755—RECOG-
NIZING SEPTEMBER 11, 2022, AS A 
‘‘NATIONAL 
DAY 
OF 
SERVICE 
AND REMEMBRANCE’’ 
Mr. COONS (for himself, Mr. CASSIDY, 
Mr. REED, Mrs. SHAHEEN, Mr. SCHUMER, 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN, Mr. KING, and Ms. 
COLLINS) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 755 
Whereas, on September 11, 2001, the United 
States endured violent terrorist attacks and 
events (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘attacks’’) in New York City, Washington, 
DC, and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, leading 
to the tragic deaths and injuries of thou-
sands of innocent United States citizens and 
others from more than 90 different countries 
and territories; 
Whereas, in response to the attacks, fire-
fighters, uniformed officers, emergency med-
ical technicians, physicians, nurses, military 
personnel, and other first responders imme-
diately rose to service in the heroic attempt 
to save the lives of the individuals in danger; 
Whereas, in the immediate aftermath of 
the attacks, thousands of recovery workers, 
including trades personnel, iron workers, 
equipment operators, and many others, 
joined with uniformed officers and military 
personnel to help search for and recover vic-
tims lost in the attacks; 
Whereas, in the days, weeks, and months 
following the attacks, thousands of individ-
uals in the United States spontaneously vol-
unteered to help support rescue and recovery 
efforts, braving both physical and emotional 
hardship; 
Whereas many first responders, rescue and 
recovery workers, volunteers, and survivors 
of the attacks continue to suffer from seri-
ous medical illnesses and emotional distress 
related to the physical and mental trauma of 
the attacks; 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of brave in-
dividuals continue to serve every day, an-
swering the call to duty as members of the 
Armed Forces, with many having given their 
lives or suffered injury— 
(1) to defend the security of the United 
States; and 
(2) to prevent further terrorist attacks; 
Whereas the people of the United States 
witnessed and endured the tragedy of Sep-
tember 11, 2001, and, in the immediate after-
math of the attacks, came together under a 
remarkable and inspiring spirit of unity, 
service, and compassion; 
Whereas, in the years immediately fol-
lowing the attacks, there was a marked in-
crease in volunteerism and national service 
among the people of the United States, 
which continues to this day; 
Whereas, in 2009, with the support of mem-
bers of the community affected by the at-
tacks, 
Congress 
passed, 
and 
President 
Barack Obama signed, the bipartisan Serve 
America Act (Public Law 111–13; 123 Stat. 
1460), which— 
(1) established Federal recognition of Sep-
tember 11 as a ‘‘National Day of Service and 
Remembrance’’ (commonly referred to as ‘‘9/ 
11 Day’’) as a way to annually and forever 
encourage all people of the United States to 
remember and pay tribute on the anniver-
sary of the attacks through acts of service, 
including volunteerism, and to keep the 
promise to ‘‘Never Forget’’; and 
(2) charged the Corporation for National 
and Community Service (commonly known 
as ‘‘AmeriCorps’’), the Federal agency for 
community service and volunteerism, with 
leading the annual day of service; and

tember 11 as a National Day of Service and

September 8, 2022 
Remembrance, millions of individuals in the 
United States have observed that date by 
uniting together across differences and en-
gaging in a wide range of service activities 
and private forms of prayer and remem-
brance: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes, commends, and honors the 
selfless dedication to fellow citizens dis-
played through the heroic actions of first re-
sponders and other citizens in New York 
City, Washington, DC, and Shanksville, 
Pennsylvania; 
(2) calls on the Members of the Senate and 
the House of Representatives, and all people 
of the United States, to observe September 
11, 2022, as a ‘‘National Day of Service and 
Remembrance’’, with appropriate and per-
sonal expressions of service and reflection, 
which may include performing good deeds, 
displaying the United States flag, partici-
pating in memorial and remembrance serv-
ices, and engaging in volunteer service or 
other charitable activities— 
(A) in honor of the individuals who lost 
their lives, were injured in, or continue to be 
medically ill as a result of the terrorist at-
tacks of September 11, 2001; and 
(B) in tribute to the individuals who rose 
to service— 
(i) to come to the aid of those individuals 
in need; and 
(ii) in defense of the United States; and 
(3) urges all people of the United States to 
continue to live their lives throughout the 
year with the same spirit of unity, service, 
and compassion that was exhibited through-
out the United States following the terrorist 
attacks of September 11, 2001.

ANNI-
VERSARY OF THE ESTABLISH-
MENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF 
THE 
AIR 
FORCE 
AND 
CELE-
BRATING THE UNITED STATES 
AIR FORCE FOR 75 YEARS OF 
SERVING AND DEFENDING THE 
UNITED STATES 
Mr. BOOZMAN (for himself, Mr. 
TESTER, Mr. HOEVEN, and Mr. BROWN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Armed Services: 
S. RES. 756 
Whereas, on August 1, 1907, the Aero-
nautical Division of the Army Signal Corps, 
consisting of 1 officer and 2 enlisted men, 
began operation under the command of Cap-
tain Charles deForest Chandler with the re-
sponsibility for ‘‘all matters pertaining to 
military ballooning, air machines, and all 
kindred subjects’’; 
Whereas, in 1908, the Department of War 
contracted with the Wright brothers to build 
1 heavier-than-air flying machine for the 
Army and, in 1909, the Department of War 
accepted the Wright Military Flyer, the first 
military airplane in the world; 
Whereas pilots of the United States, flying 
with both Allied air forces and with the 
Army Air Service, performed admirably dur-
ing the course of World War I, the first air 
war in history, by participating in pursuit, 
observation, and day and night bombing mis-
sions; 
Whereas pioneering aviators of the United 
States, including Mason M. Patrick, William 
‘‘Billy’’ 
Mitchell, 
Benjamin 
D. 
Foulois, 
Frank M. Andrews, Henry H. ‘‘Hap’’ Arnold, 
James H. ‘‘Jimmy’’ Doolittle, and Edward 
‘‘Eddie’’ Rickenbacker, were among the first 
individuals to recognize the military poten-
tial of airpower and, in the decades following 
World War I, courageously laid the founda-
tion for the creation of an independent arm 
for the air forces of the United States; 
Whereas General Henry H. ‘‘Hap’’ Arnold 
drew upon the industrial prowess and human 
resources of the United States to transform 
the Army Air Corps from a force of 22,400 
men and 2,402 aircraft in 1939, into an entity 
with a peak wartime strength of 2,400,000 
personnel and 79,908 aircraft; 
Whereas, on June 20, 1941, the Department 
of War established the Army Air Forces as 
the aviation element of that Department 
and, shortly thereafter, the Department 
made the Army Air Forces co-equal to the 
Army Ground Forces; 
Whereas the standard for courage, flexi-
bility, and intrepidity in combat was estab-
lished for all airmen during the first aerial 
raid in the Pacific Theater on April 18, 1942, 
when Lieutenant Colonel James ‘‘Jimmy’’ H. 
Doolittle led 16 North American B–25 Mitch-
ell bombers in a joint operation from the 
deck of the USS Hornet to strike the Japa-
nese mainland in response to the Japanese 
attack on Pearl Harbor; 
Whereas the National Security Act of 1947 
(50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.), signed into law by 
President Harry S. Truman, realigned and 
reorganized the Armed Forces to establish 
the Department of the Air Force and the 
United States Air Force (referred to in this 
preamble as the ‘‘USAF’’) as separate from 
other military services; 
Whereas, on September 18, 1947, W. Stuart 
Symington became the first Secretary of the 
newly formed and independent Air Force, 
marking the date on which the USAF was es-
tablished; 
Whereas the Air National Guard was also 
created by the National Security Act of 1947 
(50 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.) and has played a vital 
role in guarding the United States and de-
fending freedom in nearly every major con-
flict and contingency since its creation; 
Whereas, on October 14, 1947, the USAF 
demonstrated the historic and ongoing com-
mitment of the USAF to technological inno-
vation 
when 
Captain 
Charles 
‘‘Chuck’’ 
Yeager piloted the X–1 developmental rocket 
plane to a speed of Mach 1.07, becoming the 
first flyer to break the sound barrier in a 
powered aircraft in level flight; 
Whereas the Air Force Reserve, created on 
April 14, 1948, is comprised of citizen airmen 
who serve as unrivaled wingmen of the ac-
tive duty USAF during every deployment 
and on every mission and battlefield around 
the world in which the USAF is engaged; 
Whereas the USAF carried out the Berlin 
Airlift in 1948 and 1949 to provide humani-
tarian relief to post-war Germany and has 
established a tradition of offering humani-
tarian assistance when responding to natural 
disasters and needs across the world; 
Whereas the Tuskegee Airmen served the 
United States with tremendous dignity and 
honor, overcame segregation and prejudice 
to become one of the most highly respected 
fighter groups of World War II, and helped to 
establish a policy of racial integration with-
in the ranks of the USAF, as, on April 26, 
1948, the USAF became the first military 
branch to integrate, a full 3 months before 
an executive order integrated all military 
services; 
Whereas, in the early years of the Cold 
War, the arsenal of bombers of the USAF, 
such as the long-range Convair B–58 Hustler 
and B–36 Peacemaker, and the Boeing B–47 
Stratojet and B–52 Stratofortress, served as 
the preeminent deterrent of the United 
States against the forces of the Soviet Union 
and were later augmented by the develop-
ment and deployment of medium range and 
intercontinental ballistic missiles, such as 
the Titan and Minuteman, developed by Gen-
eral Bernard A. Schriever; 
Whereas, on April 1, 1954, President Dwight 
D. 
Eisenhower 
signed 
legislation 
estab-
lishing the United States Air Force Acad-
emy, the mission of which is to educate, de-
velop, and inspire men and women to become 
aerospace officers and leaders of impeccable 
character and knowledge, and which, as of 
2022, has graduated 64 classes and commis-
sioned 53,491 officers into the USAF and 
United States Space Force (referred to in 
this preamble as the ‘‘USSF’’); 
Whereas, during the Korean War, the 
USAF employed the first large-scale combat 
use of jet aircraft, helped to establish air su-
periority over the Korean Peninsula, pro-
tected ground forces of the United Nations 
with close air support, and interdicted 
enemy reinforcements and supplies; 
Whereas, during the Vietnam War, the 
USAF engaged in a limited campaign of air-
power to assist the South Vietnamese gov-
ernment in countering the communist Viet 
Cong guerillas and fought to disrupt supply 
lines, halt enemy ground offensives, and pro-
tect United States and Allied forces; 
Whereas, on April 3, 1967, former prisoner 
of war Paul W. Airey, a career radio oper-
ator, aerial gunner, and First Sergeant, be-
came the first Chief Master Sergeant of the 
USAF; 
Whereas, in recent decades, the USAF and 
coalition partners of the United States have 
supported successful actions in Grenada, 
Panama, Iraq, Kuwait, Somalia, Bosnia- 
Herzegovina, Haiti, Kosovo, Afghanistan, 
Libya, Syria, and many other locations 
around the world; 
Whereas USAF Special Operations Forces 
have served with honor and distinction 
around the world since their activation in 
1990, providing the United States with spe-
cialized airpower across the broad spectrum 
of conflicts in any place and at any time; 
Whereas, for over 3 decades beginning in 
1990, airmen engaged in continuous combat 
operations from Operation Desert Shield to 
Operation Inherent Resolve, demonstrating 
an air and space expeditionary force of out-
standing capability that is ready to fight and 
win wars and deter aggression whenever and 
wherever called upon; 
Whereas, when terrorists attacked the 
United States on September 11, 2001, fighter 
and air refueling aircraft of the USAF took 
to the skies to fly combat air patrols over 
major cities of the United States and protect 
the people of the United States from further 
attack; 
Whereas, on December 20, 2019, in recogni-
tion that space had become a warfighting do-
main, former President Donald Trump signed 
legislation establishing the USSF as an inde-
pendent service to ensure that the space do-
main remained open to all countries; 
Whereas, on May 30, 2020, in collaboration 
and engagement with interagency and com-
mercial partners, the USSF provided unpar-
alleled space launch capabilities in support 
of the first manned spaceflight from Amer-
ican soil in 9 years; 
Whereas, in 2021, in a step toward orga-
nizing the forces of the USSF to meet the 
needs of an independent military service de-
voted to space, the USSF activated Space 
Operations Command, Space Systems Com-
mand, and Space Training and Readiness 
Command; 
Whereas, to establish a unique and endur-
ing culture for the USSF, the Department of 
the Air Force redesignated certain Air Force 
Bases and Air Force Stations supporting the 
USSF mission as Space Force Bases and 
Space Force Stations and graduated its first- 
ever basic military training course taught 
completely by USSF training instructors; 
Whereas space capabilities provide the 
foundation for everything the United States

Armed Forces do, from humanitarian efforts 
to combat operations; 
Whereas, in 2022, following a ‘wings of hope 
and compassion’ tradition dating back more 
than a century, when airmen provided food 
and supplies to Texas flood victims in 1919, 
the USAF and coalition partners airlifted 
124,334 people out of Afghanistan in the larg-
est humanitarian evacuation operation in 
history, spanning 17 days, 9 countries, 8 time 
zones, and more than 10 temporary safe ha-
vens; 
Whereas, since February 24, 2022, airmen 
and guardians have responded to Russian ag-
gression against Ukraine by guarding the 
skies of members of the North Atlantic Trea-
ty Organization (commonly referred to as 
‘‘NATO’’), transporting essential equipment 
to the Ukrainian military, and providing 
critical support from space; 
Whereas women have played a prominent 
role in the evolution of the Department of 
the Air Force, courageously fighting along-
side their male counterparts and dedicating 
their lives to protecting peace, liberty, and 
freedom around the world as they provide air 
and space power whenever and wherever 
needed; 
Whereas the Department of the Air Force 
has made tremendous strides in the global 
warfighting domain of cyberspace by revolu-
tionizing offensive and defensive capabilities 
and effects with speed, agility, and surgical 
precision, thereby ensuring the continuous 
command, control, and execution of oper-
ations in contested, degraded, and limited 
environments; 
Whereas the Civil Air Patrol, as a Total 
Force partner and auxiliary of the USAF, 
has maintained a steadfast commitment to 
the United States and the communities of 
the United States through a proud legacy of 
service, from the earliest days of World War 
II, when the Civil Air Patrol protected the 
shorelines of the United States, through 2022, 
as the Civil Air Patrol executes emergency 
service missions and aerospace education 
programs; 
Whereas the Department of the Air Force 
is steadfast in the commitment to fielding a 
world-class air and space expeditionary force 
by recruiting, training, and educating its of-
ficer, enlisted, and civilian corps comprising 
the active duty, Guard, and Reserve compo-
nents of the Total Force; 
Whereas airmen were imprisoned and tor-
tured during several major conflicts, includ-
ing World War I, World War II, the Vietnam 
War, the Korean War, and the Persian Gulf 
War, and, in the valiant tradition of airmen 
held captive, continued serving the United 
States with honor and dignity under the 
most inhumane circumstances; 
Whereas airmen have earned the Medal of 
Honor 18 times, the Air Force Cross 203 
times, the Distinguished Service Cross 42 
times, and, since September 11, 2001, the Sil-
ver Star 92 times; 
Whereas the USAF and the USSF are tre-
mendous stewards of resources in developing 
and applying groundbreaking technology to 
manage complex acquisition programs for all 
air and space weapon systems throughout 
their life cycles; 
Whereas talented and dedicated airmen 
and guardians will continue to make the in-
vestments necessary to accelerate trans-
formation and modernization to counter the 
adversaries of the United States and meet 
the future challenges of an ever-changing 
world with limitless strength, resolve, and 
patriotism; 
Whereas the USAF and the USSF are com-
mitted to accelerating change and preparing 
for the future, because failure is not an op-
tion; 
Whereas, on every continent around the 
world, airmen and guardians have bravely 
fought for freedom, liberty, and peace, pre-
served democracy, and protected the people 
and interests of the United States; 
Whereas the future success of the United 
States Armed Forces depends upon the abil-
ity to control the air and space domains; 
Whereas airmen and guardians will con-
tinue to be a tremendous resource for the 
United States in fights across every domain 
and at every location, thereby ensuring the 
safety and security of the United States; and 
Whereas, for 75 years, the airmen and 
guardians of the Department of the Air 
Force, through their exemplary service and 
sacrifice, have repeatedly proven their value 
to the United States, the people of the 
United States, the allies of the United 
States, and all free people of the world: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) commemorates the 75th anniversary of 
the establishment of the Department of the 
Air Force; and 
(2) remembers, honors, and commends the 
achievements of the United States Air Force 
and the United States Space Force in serving

SOLID START ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of Calendar No. 478, S. 1198. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1198) to amend title 38, United 
States Code, to improve and expand the 
Solid Start program of the Department of 
Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill, which 
had been reported from the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs, with an amend-
ment to strike all after the enacting 
clause and insert in lieu thereof the 
following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Solid Start Act 
of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) In 2021, veterans continue to die by suicide 
at higher rates than civilians. Many of those 
veterans have no ties to the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs, limiting the ability of the Depart-
ment to help in times of crisis. 
(2) The first year after separating from the 
military is a critical time in the transition to ci-
vilian life for a member of the Armed Forces. 
Many changes occur during that transition, 
from career and location changes to shifts in fi-
nancial circumstances and health care coverage. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States must strive to better serve members of the 
Armed 
Forces 
and 
veterans 
who 
are 
transitioning to civilian life by— 
(1) providing up-to-date information and ac-
cess to resources that such members of the 
Armed Forces and veterans may not be aware 
of; 
(2) supporting the critical time of transition by 
ensuring that mental health needs are met in a 
timely manner; and 
(3) assisting members of the Armed Forces and 
veterans in accessing newly available services. 
SEC. 4. SOLID START PROGRAM OF THE DEPART-
MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) IN
GENERAL.—Chapter 63 of title 38, 
United States Code, is amended by adding at the 
end the following new subchapter: 
‘‘Subchapter II—Other Outreach Programs 
and Activities 
‘‘§ 6320. Solid Start program 
‘‘(a) PURPOSES.—The purposes of this section 
are— 
‘‘(1) to build the capacity of the Department 
to efficiently and effectively respond to the que-
ries and needs of veterans who have recently 
separated from the Armed Forces; and 
‘‘(2) to systemically integrate and coordinate 
efforts to assist veterans, including efforts— 
‘‘(A) to proactively reach out to newly sepa-
rated veterans to inform them of their eligibility 
for programs of and benefits provided by the De-
partment; and 
‘‘(B) to connect veterans in crisis to resources 
that address their immediate needs. 
‘‘(b) ACTIVITIES
OF
THE SOLID START PRO-
GRAM.—(1) The Secretary, in coordination with 
the Secretary of Defense, shall carry out the 
Solid Start program of the Department by— 
‘‘(A) collecting up-to-date contact information 
during transition classes or separation coun-
seling for all members of the Armed Forces who 
are separating from the Armed Forces, while ex-
plaining the existence and purpose of the Solid 
Start program; 
‘‘(B) calling each veteran, regardless of sepa-
ration type or characterization of service, three 
times within the first year after separation of 
the veteran from the Armed Forces; 
‘‘(C) providing information about the Solid 
Start program on the website of the Department 
and in materials of the Department, especially 
transition booklets and other resources; 
‘‘(D) ensuring calls are truly tailored to the 
needs of each veteran’s unique situation by con-
ducting quality assurance tests; 
‘‘(E) prioritizing outreach to veterans who 
have accessed mental health resources prior to 
separation from the Armed Forces; 
‘‘(F) providing women veterans with informa-
tion that is tailored to their specific health care 
and benefit needs; 
‘‘(G) as feasible, providing information on ac-
cess to State and local resources, including Vet 
Centers and veterans service organizations; and 
‘‘(H) gathering and analyzing data assessing 
the effectiveness of the Solid Start program. 
‘‘(2) The Secretary, in coordination with the 
Secretary of Defense, may carry out the Solid 
Start program by— 
‘‘(A) encouraging members of the Armed 
Forces who are transitioning to civilian life to 
authorize alternate points of contact who can be 
reached should the member be unavailable dur-
ing the first year following the separation of the 
member from the Armed Forces; and 
‘‘(B) following up missed phone calls with tai-
lored mailings to ensure the veteran still receives 
similar information. 
‘‘(3) In this subsection: 
‘‘(A) The term ‘Vet Center’ has the meaning 
given that term in section 1712A(h) of this title. 
‘‘(B) The term ‘veterans service organization’ 
means an organization recognized by the Sec-
retary for the representation of veterans under 
section 5902 of this title. 
‘‘(c) OBLIGATIONS
OF AMOUNTS.—Subject to 
the availability of appropriations, the Secretary 
may not, in a fiscal year, obligate an amount to 
carry out the Solid Start program that is less 
than the total amount obligated in the previous 
fiscal year to carry out the program, unless the 
Secretary determines that increased efficiencies 
of the program warrant the obligation of a lesser 
amount.’’. 
(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—Chapter 63 of 
such title, as amended by subsection (a), is fur-
ther amended— 
(1) by inserting before section 6301 the fol-
lowing:

tents at the beginning of chapter 63 of such title 
is amended—

and 
(2) by adding at the end the following new

ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, if 
there is no further business to come be-
fore the Senate, I ask unanimous con-
sent that it stand adjourned under the 
previous order, following the remarks 
of Senator MCCONNELL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
REMEMBERING QUEEN ELIZABETH 
II 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
today, all Americans stand with our 
great friends across the Atlantic in 
mourning the passing of Her Majesty 
Queen Elizabeth II. Our deepest sym-
pathies are with the royal family and 
the many millions of people across the 
United Kingdom and the Common-
wealth and the entire world who have 
drawn 
reassurance 
and 
inspiration 
from her historic reign, sterling char-
acter, and shining example. 
For 70 long years—from the after-
math of World War II well into the 21st 
century, across 15 different Prime Min-
isters, through great triumphs and 
great challenges—the Queen’s steady 
leadership safeguarded the land she 
loved. Despite spending nearly three- 
quarters of a century as one of the 
most famous and admired individuals 
on the entire planet, the Queen made 
sure her reign was never really about 
herself, not about her fame or her feel-
ings or her personal wants or needs. 
She guided venerable institutions 
through modern times using timeless 
virtues like duty, dignity, and sac-
rifice. She offered our contemporary 
world a living master class that it 
needed badly. 
Of 
particular 
importance 
to 
all 
Americans, the decades of Her Maj-
esty’s reign saw an intense deepening 
of the special relationship and close 
bond between the United States and 
the United Kingdom. The Queen met 
sitting President Harry S. Truman 
when she was a 25-year-old princess. 
She went on to meet with a dozen more 
of our Presidents during her reign. She 
presided over a period of historic 
strengthening of the alliance between 
our nations that has changed the 
course of world history for the better. 
So, Madam President, today, the 
Senate and the American people are 
joined with our dear friends across the 
ocean. We are joined in prayer, in grief, 
and in gratitude for such a remarkable 
leader and such a successful reign. 
ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, 
SEPTEMBER 12, 2022, AT 3 P.M. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. COR-
TEZ MASTO). Under the previous order, 
the Senate stands adjourned until 3 
p.m., Monday, September 12, 2022. 
Thereupon, the Senate, at 3:05 p.m., 
adjourned until Monday, September 12, 
2022, at 3 p.m.
