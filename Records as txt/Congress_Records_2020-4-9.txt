RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, our 
Nation 
continues 
to 
battle 
the 
coronavirus 
pandemic. 
More 
than 
400,000 Americans have tested positive. 
Nearly 15,000 have lost their lives. 
Nurses, doctors, and EMTs are fighting 
this disease literally day and night, 
and important public health measures 
are creating an economic catastrophe. 
This morning, we learned that 6.6 
million more Americans filed for un-
employment in just the last week. 
That means more than 16 million 
Americans have lost their jobs in only 
the last 3 weeks, a tragedy that is hard 
to even comprehend. As one journalist 
put it, we are facing a healthcare crisis 
with an economic crisis strapped to its 
back. That is why, 2 weeks ago, the 
Senate passed the largest rescue pack-
age in American history. The bipar-
tisan CARES Act funneled more than 
$2 trillion into bold programs to help 
households, 
fund 
hospitals 
and 
healthcare providers, and keep pay-
checks coming. 
Before we adjourned, I said the Sen-
ate would stay nimble and prepare to 
react quickly as the legislation came 
online, so that why we are here today. 
Much of the CARES Act is still being 
implemented, but one key program— 
one key program—is already up and 
running. It is the Paycheck Protection 
Program from Chairman RUBIO, Chair-
man COLLINS, Senator CARDIN, and Sen-
ator SHAHEEN. It gives small businesses 
emergency capital so that workers can 
keep getting paychecks instead of pink 
slips. Just a few days after the program 
opened for business, $100 billion in 
loans have already been committed. 
That is 30 percent of the total funding 
spoken for in just the first few days. I 
say that is very good news. It means 
this job-saving program is attractive to 
small business. Employers can access 
it. But it also means we need more 
funding, and we need it fast. 
Soon, I will ask unanimous consent 
to increase the funding for the Pay-
check Protection Program to a new 
total of $600 billion. I am not talking 
about changing any policy language 
that both sides have already negotiated 
together several weeks ago. I am lit-
erally talking about deleting the num-
ber 350 and writing 600 in its place. Let 
me say that again: We are not talking 
about making any policy changes; we 
are literally changing the number 350 
to 600. That is all we are suggesting 
here today. That, by definition, is a 
clean bill. 
I want to add more money to the 
only part of our bipartisan bill that is 
currently at risk of running out of 
money, so I was surprised to see this 
simple proposal met uneasily by the 
Democratic 
leadership. 
The 
distin-
guished Democratic leader and the 
Speaker of the House sought to use 
this crucial program to open broader 
negotiations on other topics, including 
parts of the CARES Act where lit-
erally—listen to this, Mr. President— 
literally no money has gone out the 
door yet—no money has gone out the 
door yet. The Democratic leadership 
has suggested they may hold Ameri-
cans’ paychecks hostage unless we 
passed 
another 
sweeping 
bill 
that 
spends a half trillion dollars, doubling 
down on a number of parts of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2168 
April 9, 2020 
CARES Act, including parts that have 
not even started to work yet. 
The country cannot afford unneces-
sary wrangling or political maneu-
vering. Treating this as a normal kind 
of partisan negotiation could literally 
cost Americans their jobs. We are in a 
situation right now where passing a 
bill means either unanimous consent or 
a voice vote. Everyone knows—every-
one—there is zero chance that the 
sprawling proposal that our Demo-
cratic friends have gestured towards 
could pass either Chamber by unani-
mous consent this week—no chance. 
The President has already indicated he 
would not sign it. The country needs us 
to be nimble—nimble—to fix urgent 
problems as fast as we can, to be able 
to have focused discussions on urgent 
subjects without turning every con-
versation into a conversation about ev-
erything. We need to patch holes as we 
see them and keep moving forward to-
gether. 
Everybody in the Senate voted to 
send historic funding to hospitals and 
healthcare providers. Everyone sup-
ports funding hospitals. I am in favor 
of even more funding for hospitals and 
providers down the line. I have been 
talking to a number of them, as I am 
sure our colleagues have, over the last 
couple of weeks. 
But certainly, we need to see the ex-
isting funding begin to work before we 
know what additional resources may be 
needed. I have been urging Secretary 
Azar to push this money onto the 
frontlines as soon as possible. I am glad 
tens of billions are going to go out to-
morrow. There is only one part of the 
CARES Act that is already—already— 
at risk of exhausting its funding right 
now—only one part of the CARES Act 
is at risk of exhausting its funding 
right now: the Paycheck Protection 
Program. 
We are asking small business owners 
across America to place their faith in 
us. We are asking them to keep work-
ers on payroll because Congress, the 
Treasury, and the SBA will have their 
back. We must not fail them. My col-
leagues must not treat working Ameri-
cans as political hostages. This does 
not have to be, nor should it be conten-
tious. We don’t have to divide along 
the usual lines so soon after we came 
together for the country. 
To 
my 
Democratic 
colleagues, 
please—please—do 
not 
block 
emer-
gency aid you do not even oppose just 
because you want something more. Do 
not block emergency aid you do not op-
pose just because you want something 
more. 
Nobody believes this is the Senate’s 
last word on COVID–19. We don’t have 
to do everything right now. In fact, our 
posture of needing unanimous consent 
does not even permit us to try to do ev-
erything right now. We cannot play 
games with this crisis. Let’s pass more 
noncontroversial funding for Ameri-
cans’ paychecks. Let’s do it today, and 
then let’s continue to work together 
with speed and bipartisanship. We will 
get through this crisis together. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent the Sen-
ate proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of the bill at the desk. I further 
ask that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Mr. CARDIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me 
just clarify some of the issues the ma-
jority leader pointed out. I am afraid 
that this unanimous consent is basi-
cally a political stunt because it will 
not address the immediate need of 
small businesses in the legislation that 
we have passed, and let me clarify that. 
The majority leader indicated that 
the PPP, the Paycheck Protection 
Plan, is running out of money. It 
hasn’t. Thirty percent hasn’t been 
committed. It hasn’t been yet released. 
But there are programs under the 
CARES Act that have run out of 
money. The EIDL program, the emer-
gency disaster relief loan program 
which provides funds for businesses— 
we have allowed businesses that have 
been affected by the coronavirus to file 
those claims—that has run out of 
money, and I will give you the numbers 
in a few moments. And the grant pro-
gram that is included in the CARES at 
up to $10,000, where a small business 
can get a grant from the Small Busi-
ness Administration, is out of funds. 
They need money today in order to 
process applications. 
The SBA doesn’t need money today 
to process the Paycheck Protection 
Program. The Paycheck Protection 
Program was negotiated in good faith 
by Senator RUBIO, Senator COLLINS, 
Senator SHAHEEN, and myself, and we 
are very proud of that program. It is 
working very well. It is a good pro-
gram. We strongly support it. It is bi-
partisan. 
But this unanimous consent request 
was not negotiated. There was no effort 
made to follow the process that we 
could get this done, so it won’t get 
done. It is not going to be enacted, and 
the majority leader knows that. So 
what Democrats are prepared to make 
clear—every small business that is eli-
gible to receive the Paycheck Protec-
tion Plan, we are going to support 
their applications being received, proc-
essed, and fully funded. We will put as 
much money as needed to make sure 
that every small business can partici-
pate that is eligible in that program. 
The UC does not affect that today, but 
what the UC leaves out is where small 
businesses need help today from the 
U.S. Congress. 
Yesterday, we had an opportunity to 
find out the numbers—and as the ma-
jority leader pointed out, we have got 
to get this right. There are 6.6 million 
more uninsured today, as we learned 
from the current numbers. We have to 
protect small businesses to protect 
their payroll, and that is what our 
plans do. 
Yesterday, we were informed by the 
SBA, as the majority leader indicated, 
that we have about $100 billion that has 
been processed. Now, that has not been 
distributed yesterday. It hasn’t been 
distributed in large numbers because of 
documentation 
problems 
and 
know 
your customer rules have prevented 
some of these funds—a lot of these 
funds, the majority of these funds—to 
be released. 
Today, applications are being proc-
essed. 
Tomorrow, 
applications 
are 
going to be processed. The day after 
that, applications are going to be proc-
essed because we provided $350 billion. 
At this moment, we are at about $100 
billion. We are going to have to prob-
ably provide more money, and we are 
all for that. 
But where is the urgency, as far as 
the small businesses are concerned? So 
let me go over those. One, the emer-
gency grant program—this is a pro-
gram where grants are offered by the 
Small Business Administration. You 
don’t have to have a banking relation-
ship with a commercial bank in order 
to get these loans. It is very, very pop-
ular—3.8 million requests have come 
in, in regards to these loans—3.8 mil-
lion, representing $372 billion of loans. 
But here is the problem: We have 
only authorized $7.3 billion of loans 
under the program. That is why we are 
suggesting, if you add another $50 bil-
lion—you can authorize another $300 
billion of loans under the emergency 
disaster relief program. Today, if you 
have requested that loan today and you 
requested the average amount that is 
being requested—and you have to show 
need in this program—you have got to 
document the need that the disaster 
has affected your viability as a busi-
ness. The average loan is $200,000. That 
is what they are requesting. 
Guess how much money the SBA can 
issue today? It is $15,000. That is an ur-
gent need that we should deal with 
today, and we are prepared to deal with 
it. There is a second program for 
small—by the way, smaller businesses 
participate in these programs more so 
than the PPP program. 
There is a second program. It is a 
grant program up to $10,000. Our work-
ing bipartisan group recognized that 
there are some businesses that are in 
desperate need of cash immediately. 
These loans are processed within 3 
days. We have had—so far requests for 
the grant program, 3.5 million small 
businesses have requested funds, total-
ing a request for $11 billion on a sliding 
scale. It doesn’t even give every small 
business $10,000. 
How much money did we appro-
priate? $10 billion. SBA cannot release 
those funds in 3 days because they 
don’t have the money to do it. The UC 
by the majority leader does not provide 
that money so that those small busi-
nesses can get that cash. That is not 
provided.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2169 
April 9, 2020 
Now, we got that information yester-
day, and maybe the majority leader 
didn’t have it, but we can tell you they 
can’t issue those grants, and that is 
under the CARES Act, and that is out 
of money. 
I am also going to tell you some sto-
ries we have heard in Maryland, and we 
have heard it all over the country. I 
have heard from small businesses that 
went to their bank in order to partici-
pate in the PPP loan, and they were 
told that they didn’t have a credit 
card, so the bank wasn’t going to write 
the loan, or they hadn’t had a previous 
loan with that bank, so the bank is not 
going to write the loan. 
We have heard from some community 
banks that they can only handle exist-
ing customers; they can’t do additional 
customers at this point. We have heard 
from rural small businesses; they can’t 
find lenders who will write these notes. 
We have to do a better job. 
What did we find out yesterday? Of 
the total 7(a) lenders that are out there 
today, about 90 percent were certified 
before the CARES Act. We have only 
increased their numbers by about 10 
percent. That is not enough. We can’t 
reach these underserved communities. 
We have to do a better job in reaching 
these underserved communities so that 
a small business that doesn’t have that 
type of relationship with a bank can 
still participate in the Paycheck Pro-
tection Plan. This UC does nothing at 
all about that issue—nothing at all 
about that. 
The urgent issues are not dealt with 
in this UC. That is why the process of 
negotiating—allowing us to come to-
gether and figure out what is the best 
way to move forward—will result in us 
actually getting something done to 
help the small business community. 
There are other urgent needs. My col-
league, Senator VAN HOLLEN, is going 
to talk about some of these. 
The healthcare issues, my colleague 
and I have participated in numerous 
conference calls over the last 2 weeks. 
I am sure my other colleagues have 
done the same. We have heard from our 
healthcare providers, that they are 
ready to close the doors. They need im-
mediate help and a lot more than the 
$100 billion that has been provided. 
We talked to our Governor yesterday. 
He is the head of the National Gov-
ernors Association. They requested $500 
billion. They need money. Their reve-
nues are down. We know we didn’t do 
right for the District of Columbia. We 
know we didn’t do right for smaller 
communities. We need to correct that 
now because they can’t stay in busi-
ness today. It is urgent, and the UC 
does nothing to help in that regard. 
So, Mr. President, if I could, I would 
like to allow my colleague from Mary-
land, whom I believe has a reservation 
also, and then he has a UC request of 
his own. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Maryland. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
This is an unfortunate moment for 
the U.S. Senate. We came together on 
a bipartisan basis just a very short 
time ago to pass the CARES Act. It 
passed here 96 to nothing. That fol-
lowed two other bipartisan efforts that 
came out of the House, passed the Sen-
ate, and were signed by the President, 
again, with overwhelming support. 
Yet, today, we see from the majority 
leader a complete political stunt here 
on the floor of the U.S. Senate—some-
thing that does not have bipartisan 
support, something that is go it alone, 
take it or leave it, and totally violates 
the spirit all of us have been working 
on during this crisis where we were 
able to come together in the U.S. Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives 
with the White House to, on three prior 
occasions, pass legislation in a way 
that addressed the issues that are im-
portant to this country. 
Yet, today, we have this situation 
where the majority leader knew full 
well there was not agreement and con-
sensus on moving forward with this 
proposal. That is why we are here 
today. This was, in fact, designed to 
fail, designed as a political stunt. It is 
actually not the first time we have 
seen this. You may recall that, just be-
fore we came together and passed the 
CARES Act 96–0, the majority leader 
came to the floor of the Senate back 
then and tried to ram through an un-
finished product while negotiations 
were 
going 
on 
between 
Secretary 
Mnuchin and Democrats in the House 
and the Senate to try to finalize the 
bill, and that actually caused unneces-
sary delay. But the majority leader 
came to the floor then and tried to ram 
it through. It didn’t work then, and it 
is not going to work today. 
I would ask the majority leader—and 
I think all of us would—to go back to 
trying to address these issues the way 
we addressed them in a successful man-
ner before. I am going to shortly pro-
pose an amendment that addresses 
some of those concerns—an amendment 
to the majority leader’s proposal. 
I would like to address some of the 
issues first, and my colleague, Senator 
CARDIN, has addressed many with re-
spect to small businesses. First of all, 
he pointed out that the one program to 
help small businesses that has actually 
really run out of money is the emer-
gency loan and grant program. 
Let’s talk about the PPP program. 
This is a really important program to 
incentivize small businesses and non-
profits to keep employees on the pay-
roll and allow them to help keep the 
lights on, pay fixed costs, pay the 
mortgage, pay the rent, whatever it 
may be, so that they can emerge on the 
other side of this storm without having 
had to fold. Many of us anticipated 
long before the CARES Act passed that 
this program would need more money. 
I was part of a group that proposed $600 
billion for a program like this, recog-
nizing the demand would be huge, as it 
is on other programs. It is not just in 
need of more money. It needs some im-
portant fixes, which I daresay would 
have bipartisan support as well. 
I don’t know if the majority leader 
saw the letter just this morning from 
the National Restaurant Association. 
Here is what they say: 
The PPP is funded at $349 billion, and we 
expect that lenders will reach that ceiling 
shortly. We appreciate the bipartisan calls 
this week to provide prompt additional fund-
ing for the program. 
Then they go on to say: 
However, equally important is the need to 
address the limitations of the program that 
do not recognize the unique and evolving 
challenges of the restaurant business cycle 
and our path to recovery. 
This is not a Republican group or a 
Democratic group. This is a group that 
represents 
small 
businesses, 
res-
taurants, just trying to get by, and 
what they say to us this morning is: 
Yes, we do need additional money. We 
know that. But equally important, 
let’s fix some of the kinks, and there 
are kinks in this program. 
I got a letter at 12:44 a.m. this morn-
ing from a small business owner who 
had been banking with Wells Fargo. 
Then, of course, Wells Fargo hit the 
cap. We thought we had dealt with that 
in recent days. But he is not sure he is 
still going to be able to get that loan 
through Wells Fargo, and he says: 
I’ve also now looked at more than 100 
websites of 7(a) lenders in the greater DC 
area and have found that NONE—capital let-
ters NONE—will accept a PPP application 
from any small business that did not bank 
with them before February 15, 2020. 
Here are some other headlines in re-
cent days: 
‘‘Baltimore-area 
small 
businesses 
complain of continuing problems gain-
ing access to federal lending program.’’ 
‘‘ ‘Nightmare’: 3 small-business own-
ers describe process of applying for 
PPP coronavirus loans.’’ 
The Journal Record: ‘‘Community 
bankers frustrated with PPP rollout.’’ 
Another headline, this one from an-
other part of the country: ‘‘PPP loan 
plan a mess so far for small businesses 
riding out coronavirus crisis.’’ 
‘‘Billions ‘disbursed’ through Pay-
check Protection Program? Small busi-
nesses say not yet.’’ 
The Wall Street Journal: ‘‘Big Banks 
Favor Certain Customers in $350 Bil-
lion Small-Business Loan Program.’’ 
Another article: ‘‘Many small busi-
nesses are being shut out of the new 
loan program by major banks.’’ 
Mr. President, what we are saying 
here today is, yes, we know we need 
more money for this program. Many of 
us predicted this before we passed the 
CARES Act. But for goodness’ sakes, 
let’s take the opportunity to make 
some bipartisan fixes to allow this pro-
gram to work better for the very peo-
ple it is designed to help: small busi-
nesses, nonprofits. 
That is what they are asking us to 
do. That is what the restaurant asso-
ciation is asking us to do. That is what

April 9, 2020 
they want us to do, and we could do it 
probably just as quickly if the major-
ity leader took a moment to sit down 
with us and negotiate that piece. 
There are also other major demands 
on the system right now that we should 
address at this moment, and one of 
them is something I know we are all 
hearing about every day, which is to 
protect the healthcare workers on the 
frontlines. After all, if we want to ad-
dress the economic crisis, we need to 
address the health crisis that precip-
itated that. We need to flatten this 
virus out, bring it down, and that is the 
best way to get on the road to eco-
nomic recovery. 
I am sure all of my colleagues are 
hearing from their nurses and doctors 
and frontline healthcare workers about 
the urgent need for personal protective 
equipment. We provided funds in the 
original bill, but we know, today, that 
that will be exhausted quickly. We 
know it because we can add up the re-
quests coming from around the coun-
try. So let’s address that issue. We are 
hearing about it every day. 
Just yesterday at our delegation, our 
region, Senator CARDIN and I and other 
members of the Maryland delegation, 
we wrote to FEMA just yesterday, to 
the Administrator of FEMA. We point-
ed out that in our most recent re-
quests, Virginia, Maryland, and the 
District of Columbia received just a 
small percentage of the equipment that 
we requested from FEMA. The District 
received no hospital ventilators. I 
would point out for all of us who are 
following this, it is predicted that 
this—Maryland, DC, and Virginia—is 
going to be one of the next hotspots. 
Zero ventilators, zero safety goggles— 
we asked for 663,000 gloves, and over 1 
million respirators masks. We got 4,000 
of one. That is one problem we need to 
address on an urgent basis, just as ur-
gently as we need to address the small 
business situation. 
Testing—my 
goodness, 
look, 
this 
virus, we all know, got an 8 to 10-week 
head start on us because we were flat- 
footed when it came to testing. We 
need a national rapid testing system so 
that we can ensure that people will get 
the tests and find out whether they 
have the virus. That not only helps us 
fight the virus, but it will also help us 
as we try to get the country back to 
work on the other end of this. I would 
propose those are real needs as well 
and that we can address those here 
now. 
In addition to that, as Senator 
CARDIN said, we just spoke to Mary-
land’s Governor yesterday who, in ad-
dition to being Maryland’s Governor, is 
the head of the National Governors As-
sociation. He and Governor Cuomo 
have worked very closely together. We 
have a bipartisan request from the Na-
tional Governors Association to help 
States and local jurisdictions. We have 
been on the phone nonstop with our 
local officials. They are running out of 
equipment. We have got firefighters 
who need help. We have emergency re-
sponders who need help. 
All of these requests are urgent and, 
I believe, could be dealt with on a bi-
partisan basis, if the majority leader 
would just take a moment, instead of 
trying to rush this through, and we 
could actually get it done, as we were 
able to do before with the 96-to-nothing 
vote. 
So, at this time, Mr. President, I 
have an amendment at the desk. I 
know people are anxious to get out of 
here. We didn’t have to come in at all, 
if it hadn’t been for the decision to try 
to ram this through. I just want to 
make that point. To the majority lead-
er, we knew this wasn’t going to get 
through. I see people are frustrated and 
want to leave, but let’s get it done, and 
let’s get it done right, and let’s have 
another 96-to-nothing vote here in the 
U.S. Senate. 
So I ask unanimous consent that the 
majority leader modify the request and 
ask that the amendment at the desk, 
which is the text of the interim emer-
gency COVID–19 Relief Act, be agreed 
to; the bill, as amended, be read a third 
time and passed with no further inter-
vening action or debate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection to the modi-
fication? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Mr. CARDIN. I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
would just repeat that all the amend-
ment I offered would do is change the 
amount in the bill—that is all—to re-
spond to the obvious emergency we 
have with the Paycheck Protection 
Program.

ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, 
APRIL 13, 2020, AT 10 A.M. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. With that, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
stand adjourned in accordance with the 
order of March 26, 2020, for previously 
ordered pro forma sessions. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 10:34 and 7 seconds a.m., adjourned 
until Monday, April 13, 2020, at 10 a.m.
