DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

I hereby appoint the Honorable HENRY

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
To You, who is able to do more than 
we can ask or imagine, we come asking 
You to do the unimaginable in the face 
of the devastation that the COVID pan-
demic has wrought on our country. 
Holy God, enable us to wield care-
fully the power You have entrusted to 
us. As we work to provide relief to the 
unemployed and to aid small busi-
nesses struggling to survive, help us to 
be singular in our purpose, not dis-
tracted by special interests. May we be 
wise in how we use this opportunity to 
make a difference in the lives of Amer-
icans and responsible to the scarce and 
precious resources entrusted to us. 
On this day of Purim in the Jewish 
tradition, maybe it will take a miracle 
for us to come to consensus. But at 
such a time as this, may we risk our 
partisan postures to stand together to 
address the needs and welfare of our 
compatriots. 
It is in the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED 
OUR HELP 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker: 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish by Mr. TAKANO is as 
follows:) 
The American people need our help. 
That’s why Democrats have been 
fighting for more economic relief. 
President Biden’s stimulus package 
will help the people who need it the 
most and it will make investments to 
improve vaccine distribution, to open 
our schools, and to support small busi-
nesses. 
Thousands of families in my district 
are worried because they don’t know 
how they will pay their rent and the 
Latino community has been the most 
affected by this virus. 
We have to help everyone during 
these difficult times and ensure that 
the communities that have been most 
affected have access to the vaccine. 
Congress must approve this legisla-
tive package immediately. There is not 
time to waste. 
El pueblo americano necesita ayuda. 
Es por eso que los Demo´cratas 
estamos 
luchando 
por 
mas 
ayuda 
econo´mica. El paquete de estimulo 
econo´mico 
del 
presidente 
Biden 
ayudara´
a las personas que mas lo 
necesitan 
y 
hara´
inversiones 
para 
mejorar la distribucio´n de las vacunas, 
para abrir nuestras escuelas, y para 
apoyar a los pequen˜ os negocios. 
Miles de familias en mi distrito 
tienen angustia porque no saben como 
van a pagar su renta. Y la comunidad 
latina ha sido la ma´s afectada por este 
virus.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H736 
February 26, 2021 
Tenemos que ayudar a todos durante 
estos tiempos difı´ciles y asegurarnos 
que las comunidades mas afectadas 
tengan acceso a la vacuna. 
El 
Congreso 
debe 
aprobar

paquete legislativo inmediatamente.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will provide a 
translation of his remarks to the 
Clerk. 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. HERN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HERN. Mr. Speaker, last year, 
every single COVID relief package 
passed with bipartisan support and bi-
partisan input. This is not happening 
today because the majority has chosen 
to abandon their calls for unity with-
out even making an effort. Sadly, it is 
the American people who will bear the 
burden of this decision. 
Components of this package were 
shoved through committees on strictly 
partisan lines. One of my amendments 
asking that we prohibit taxpayer dol-
lars from going to people illegally in 
our country passed the Senate with 
broad bipartisan support, but was re-
jected without a single Democratic 
vote in our committee. 
I know from experience that a hard- 
earned paycheck is infinitely more val-
uable than anything from the unem-
ployment office. We need to put Ameri-
cans back to work, make America tired 
again. 
That 
means 
we 
cannot 
incentivize workers to stay out of the 
workforce. 
Let’s not waste any more taxpayer 
dollars than we have to. 
Getting our students back in the 
classrooms should be a top priority for 
everyone here. Not only does this bill 
not help return students to the class-
room, most of the education funds are 
not even allocated until 2022. 
There is a lot we can do together, but 
I fear a one-sided process will leave 
millions of Americans unaccounted for 
in this relief package. 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the American Res-
cue Plan Act. This week, we hit an-
other tragic milestone, and our Nation 
has now lost over half a million people 
to this virus. It is difficult to com-
prehend the sheer magnitude of those 
we have lost, but we cannot become 
numb to the sorrow so many now feel. 
Each person leaves behind their story 
of life, love, and humanity. Each 
human being leaves behind a family 
grieving the loss of a parent, a sibling, 
or a spouse. 
This is why we must pass the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, a bill that acceler-
ated our ability to deliver lifesaving 
vaccines and put an end to this pan-
demic, a bill that invests in our schools 
allowing our children and teachers to 
safely return to in-person learning, and 
a bill that provides vital economic re-
lief to American families who need our 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge our colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, here we go 
again. I am disappointed to say that 
my Democrat colleagues refuse to ne-
gotiate on legislation to provide tar-
geted, temporary COVID–19 relief to 
the American people. 
Let’s be clear. Only 9 percent of this 
$1.9 trillion package being advanced 
goes 
toward 
pandemic-related 
ex-
penses, and it is riddled with partisan 
priorities unrelated to the pandemic, 
including a $15 minimum wage require-
ment that will destroy 1.4 million 
starting jobs; $350 billion in blue State 
bailouts while leaving behind States 
like Georgia; funding for a Silicon Val-
ley underground tunnel; and much 
more. 
Throughout this whole process, my 
Democrat 
colleagues 
have 
rejected 
prioritizing reopening our schools, de-
spite the CDC stating that schools can 
safely reopen with proper precautions. 
Some of our students haven’t seen the 
inside of a classroom in a year. But 
partisan priorities are apparently more 
important. 
Let’s not forget that nearly $1 tril-
lion remains unspent from previous re-
lief packages. So let’s stop calling it 
COVID relief when this package is 
clearly just a payout to Progressive 
priorities. 
It is time to end this nonsense be-
cause the American people are no 
longer fooled. 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Ms. KUSTER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in strong support of the American 
Rescue Plan Act, bold and desperately 
needed legislation to crush the COVID– 
19 pandemic and bolster our economic 
recovery. 
As our Nation mourns over 500,000 
Americans who have lost their lives 
due to this terrible virus, we must act 
decisively and with great purpose to 
support our families and communities 
that are struggling. The American Res-
cue Plan delivers on this need, pro-
viding $1,400 relief checks to Americans 
who are hurting financially. 
For the nearly 16 million Americans 
who have lost their jobs during the 
pandemic, this bill extends critical un-
employment benefits so they can get 
back on their feet. 
For our children and families who 
have been practicing distance learning, 
this bill provides over $125 billion to 
safely reopen our schools and protect 
our teachers and students. 
For businesses who have been hit 
hard, this bill includes increased fund-
ing for economic injury disaster loans. 
For the one in seven Americans who 
are struggling with food insecurity, 
this bill increases monthly SNAP bene-
fits so they do not go hungry. And for 
the good of the country, this bill ramps 
up funding for the manufacture and 
distribution of the vaccine. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation. 
f 
PARTISAN PRIORITIES 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, since the 
start of the pandemic, the Federal Gov-
ernment has taken historic steps to 
provide nearly $4 trillion in financial 
and public health assistance to the 
American people with one goal in 
mind: defeating the virus and getting 
our country back to normal. 
Unfortunately, President Biden and 
Washington Democrats’ latest $1.9 tril-
lion stimulus package focuses more on 
fulfilling partisan priorities than com-
bating COVID–19. Only 9 percent of 
their legislation goes to public health 
spending, while the other 91 percent 
can be tied to political items unrelated 
to the pandemic. 
How can any Member of Congress 
who calls this legislation COVID relief 
look their constituents in the eye and 
justify billions in wasteful spending to 
foreign governments, bailouts, and lib-
eral pet projects? 
Rather than borrowing trillions of 
dollars to spend on liberal wish list 
items while more than $1 trillion in 
previously allocated COVID relief dol-
lars remain unspent, Congress should 
work on a bill that provides temporary 
and targeted relief tied to COVID–19. 
Mr. Speaker, the latest stimulus 
package fails on each account, and for 
that reason, we should all be voting 
‘‘no’’ on this measure. 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. CROW asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the American Rescue Plan. We 
cannot grow numb to the pain and dev-
astation the COVID pandemic brought 
this past year. 
Mr. Speaker, 500,000 Americans are 
dead. Millions have lost their jobs and 
can’t find meaningful employment. 
Children, including my own, have had 
to adapt to online learning. Millions of 
small businesses are struggling to keep 
the lights on. 
Folks in Colorado want to get this 
done. In fact, over 70 percent of Ameri-
cans want to get this done, and there

are very few things more bipartisan 
than that. They want it fixed, and they 
want it fixed now. 
This bill is the first step to building 
back better. It will support vaccine dis-
tribution and research and provide re-
lief to small businesses, schools, and 
Coloradans who are out of work. So 
let’s get this done. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in favor of the American Rescue 
Plan. 
f 
NATIONAL FFA WEEK 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. ROSE. Mr. Speaker, I proudly 
rise before you today in honor of Na-
tional FFA Week. 
As an eighth-generation farmer and 
former member of the Future Farmers 
of America myself, I have seen first-
hand the positive difference that FFA 
makes in the lives of students by devel-
oping their potential for premier lead-
ership, personal growth, and career 
success throughout agricultural edu-
cation. 
FFA members know that American 
agriculture truly is one of the best tra-
ditions of our national life and that 
service to one’s community is a pillar 
of good leadership and citizenship. 
I am confident that the future of our 
Nation’s agriculture is in good hands 
because it is being shaped by members 
of the National FFA Organization. 
I wish a happy FFA Week to the 
28,000 members in my home State of 
Tennessee and to the 760,000 members 
across the country. 
f 
COVID RELIEF 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the expanded Child Tax 
Credit and Federal unemployment as-
sistance included in the American Res-
cue Plan. 
In my State of Nevada and across the 
country, hardworking families are suf-
fering. The United States has lost more 
than 10 million jobs since the begin-
ning of this pandemic, with a particu-
larly devastating effect on women and 
people of color. Americans need help, 
and they are counting on the Members 
of this body to deliver. 
Interestingly, my colleagues on the 
other side say this bill does not have 
bipartisan support. 
Whom are they listening to? 
Seventy-six percent of Americans 
support this bill, including 60 percent 
of Republicans. So I would urge my col-
leagues on the other side to actually 
listen to their constituents and to de-
liver on their behalf. 
In just a 2-week period, more than 8 
million American children go hungry 
because their families can’t afford 
enough to eat. That should not happen 
in the wealthiest country on Earth. By 
passing an expanded Child Tax Credit, 
we can bring millions of children above 
the poverty line and put money in 
their parents’ pockets. 
By passing my legislation to increase 
and expand Federal unemployment in-
surance, we will provide critical relief 
to those who have lost their jobs in 
this pandemic. 
So while we are working to recover 
and rebuild, we must invest in the 
American people. Stop the lies and lis-
ten to your constituents.

PPP FLEXIBILITY FOR FARMERS 
AND RANCHERS 
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, the 
CARES Act allowed farmers and ranch-
ers to apply for the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program by utilizing only net in-
come in their loan calculations. This 
has prevented many agricultural part-
nerships from receiving the maximum 
loan amount possible. 
My bipartisan bill that I have intro-
duced today, the PPP Flexibility for 
Farmers and Ranchers Act, allows the 
use of gross income to calculate the 
loan and includes a retroactive provi-
sion to enable farm partnerships that 
initially used net income to recal-
culate unforgiven PPP loans. 
Ag producers throughout the Nation 
have suffered greatly from historic 
drops in demand during the pandemic. 
As we push to reopen our economy, we 
must ensure that our farmers and 
ranchers have access to the resources 
needed to maintain operations through 
the end of the pandemic. 
I am grateful to my colleagues and 
an 
array 
of 
national 
agricultural 
groups who join me in this common-
sense effort to boost our farmers, 
ranchers, and agricultural economy. 
I encourage Members to cosponsor 
my bill.

COMMU-
NITIES. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 3 years fol-
lowing the enactment of this Act, the Sec-
retary shall submit a report to the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on En-
ergy and Natural Resources of the Senate on 
the following: 
(1) Estimated use of Department of the In-
terior special recreation permits by recre-
ation service providers serving environ-
mental justice communities. 
(2) Any national, regional, State, local, or 
site-specific policies that facilitate public 
lands access for recreational service pro-
viders serving environmental justice commu-
nities. 
(3) Any case studies that may provide illus-
trative examples of how Department of the 
Interior special recreation permits, partner-
ships, or cooperative agreements are being 
effectively used by land managers for the 
purposes of providing public lands access to 
recreation service providers serving environ-
mental justice communities. 
(4) Identification of any barriers to public 
lands access for recreation service providers 
serving environmental justice communities. 
(5) Any recommendations for agency pol-

lic any other information that supports the 
reporting requirements in subsection (a); and 
(3) shall not use participation or informa-
tion provided as a condition in approving or 
rejecting a Department of the Interior spe-
cial recreation permit. 
(c) DEFINITIONS.—In this title: 
(1) The term ‘‘environmental justice com-
munity’’ means a community with signifi-
cant representation of communities of color, 
low-income communities, or Tribal and in-
digenous communities, that experiences, or 
is at risk of experiencing, higher or more ad-
verse human health or environmental effects 
than other communities. 
(2) The term ‘‘Secretary’’ means the Sec-
retary of the Interior. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 147, the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in strong support of en bloc No. 
1. These 18 amendments demonstrate 
the strong and bipartisan support for 
protecting our wilderness and our pub-
lic lands. 
The amendments in this package in-
clude bipartisan legislation from Rep-
resentatives MCKINLEY and TONKO to 
unify the way National Heritage Areas 
are established and managed around 
the country. 
Other amendments would seek to im-
prove the diversity and representation 
on our public lands, including the 
Great Dismal Swamp NHA, by Rep-
resentative MCEACHIN; ensuring all 
Americans have access to healthy out-
door recreation, especially in urban 
and low-income cities, such as the Out-
doors for All Act by Representative 
BARRAGA´ N; and promote outdoor recre-
ation and wellness among servicemem-
bers and veterans, which is pursued by 
the Brown amendment. 
We clarify also our intention regard-
ing wilderness and wildfire with the in-
clusion of the Panetta amendment, and 
we even add some small number of wil-
derness, wild and scenic rivers, and 
mineral withdrawals with the inclusion 
of amendments from Representatives 
SPANBERGER, PINGREE, and DEFAZIO, 
respectively. 
The inclusion of these amendments 
would not only improve the bill but im-
prove protections for our public lands 
and 
environmental 
justice 
commu-
nities far beyond the places already 
covered in Colorado, California, Wash-
ington, and Arizona. 
Simply put, this amendment rein-
forces that our public lands are for the 
benefit and enjoyment of all Ameri-
cans. I urge support for this en bloc No. 
1, and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise today in opposition to this 
package of en bloc amendments, which 
is bad for our environment, kills jobs, 
locks up more lands, and does nothing 
to reduce our dependence on hostile 
foreign nations for critical minerals. 
One of the amendments in this pack-
age is a feasibility study for the Great 
Dismal Swamp National Heritage Area. 
Now, the Great Dismal Swamp may 
technically be located on the Virginia- 
North 
Carolina 
border, 
but 
House 
Democrats attempting to ram through 
dozens of amendments completely un-
related to the underlying bill, without 
going 
through 
regular 
order, 
sure 
makes it seem like the Great Dismal 
Swamp is actually located right here in 
Washington, D.C. 
Much like the underlying bill, many 
of these amendments have not gone 
through regular order, are not sup-
ported by local stakeholders, and do 
not have the support of the Members 
whose districts are directly impacted. 
One such amendment creates the Ice 
Age National Scenic Trail as a unit of 
the National Park Service in Wis-
consin. This amendment was offered 
without the consultation of my col-
league on the Natural Resources Com-
mittee, Representative TIFFANY, and 
does not have his support. Unlike other 
trail designation bills that have passed 
the House by voice vote in previous 
Congresses, 
this 
amendment 
lacks 
basic protections to ensure these trails 
do not have unintended consequences 
for neighboring communities. 
Similarly, the Casa Grande Ruins Na-
tional Monument Boundary Expansion 
Act ignores the will and voices of local 
stakeholders. The Arizona State Land 
Department expressed concerns to the 
committee regarding the cooperative 
agreement language of this amendment 
and shared that they have encountered 
numerous problems with these types of 
agreements in the past. These are ex-
actly the types of concerns that should 
be vetted through the committee proc-
ess with testimony from local stake-
holders and the affected agencies. 
I would like to briefly discuss one 
amendment offered by my friend and 
colleague, 
Representative 
PANETTA 
from California, that would simply re-
inforce the status quo policy of forest 
management in wilderness areas. 
I have worked with Representative 
PANETTA on forest management poli-
cies in the past, particularly on the 
wildland-urban interface. I know his 
heart. I know he has the right intent 
and wants to do the right thing. But I 
also know that he is greatly restricted 
by his own conference on forestry man-
agement issues. 
While I appreciate his intent, over 
the past 10 years, we have had nearly 
seven million acres of wilderness and 
wilderness study areas burn up in cata-
strophic wildfires. Land managers and 
wilderness areas must rely on century- 
old techniques, like handsaws and 
shovels when millions of acres of forest 
are in desperate need of treatment. 
Mr. Speaker, 1910 called and it wants 
its forest management policy back. 
Clearly, the status quo isn’t working 
and 
unfortunately, 
his 
amendment 
won’t actually allow for proper forest 
management and won’t stop this bill 
from hurting our environment. 
Michael Jordan once wisely advised: 
‘‘If you do the work you get rewarded. 
There are no shortcuts in life.’’ 
House Democrats are looking to take 
the shortcut with this amendment 
package and the underlying bill. Unfor-
tunately, our economy and environ-
ment will have to bear the con-
sequences of these misguided policy de-
cisions. 
I would strongly urge my colleagues 
to oppose these amendments, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to my distinguished colleague 
from the State of Colorado (Mr. CROW). 
Mr. CROW. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
in support of the Protecting America’s 
Wilderness Act. 
I would first like to thank my friends 
and colleagues in the Colorado delega-
tion, Congressman JOE NEGUSE, Con-
gresswoman DIANA DEGETTE, and Sen-
ator MICHAEL BENNET for their leader-
ship on this package. 
Colorado’s identity is closely tied to 
nature. Colorado is home to four na-
tional parks, 42 State parks, and a wide 
variety of outdoor activities ranging 
from hiking, to camping, and skiing. 
Our public lands are central to the Col-
orado way of life, and I want to ensure

that future generations can enjoy these 
treasures just as my children do now. 
The conservation package we are 
considering today will grow the out-
door recreation economy, help create 
jobs, and protect hundreds of thou-
sands of acres of Colorado land for fu-
ture generations. 
The Colorado Outdoor Recreation 
and Economy Act will establish the 
first-ever national historic landscape 
at Camp Hale. Now, Camp Hale was the 
training ground of the storied 10th 
Mountain 
Division, 
an 
elite 
unit 
trained in mountain climbing and ski-
ing. They fought valiantly in World 
War II, and many of them later re-
turned to Colorado, where they helped 
establish the U.S. ski industry. 
This is particularly important to my 
family as my wife’s grandfather served 
in the initial 10th Mountain during 
World War II and was actually wounded 
in fighting in Italy. As a veteran, and a 
Coloradan, I believe it is important to 
honor their service and their legacy, 
and to preserve this historic landscape 
so that we can tell the story to future 
generations. 
I commend my Colorado colleagues 
for their work on this effort and their 
commitment to our public lands, and I 
urge my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. TIFFANY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Arkansas for yield-
ing me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the amendment, specifically, a provi-
sion in here taking a trail in Wisconsin 
and turning it into National Park 
Service unit status. 
This proposal before us has not been 
introduced as a standalone bill this 
Congress and has not been heard by the 
Natural Resources Committee. We have 
not discussed the impacts of elevating 
this trail to National Park Service unit 
status, and there have been no hearings 
to afford local officials or adjacent 
landowners the opportunity to express 
their views. 
Too often in this body, we see Mem-
bers who represent urban constitu-
encies rushing to expand Federal con-
trol over rural communities far from 
their own homes. And too often, these 
decisions marginalize the voices of peo-
ple in the affected communities who 
must live with the consequences: Fed-
eral land management agencies in 
Washington, D.C., imposing new limi-
tations on access, use, and impacts to 
private property owners. 
Mr. Speaker, we have also spent 
much time in this body discussing the 
Park Service maintenance backlog, 
which is significant. We should be 
mindful of that backlog and the fact 
that land managers lack sufficient re-
sources to care for the units already 
under their supervision. 
I am also concerned that the passage 
of measures like this one will further 
fuel the Federal Government’s insatia-
ble appetite to annex yet more private 
property. And more Federal land own-
ership means further erosion of the 
property tax base, higher local prop-
erty tax burdens, and strained local 
budgets. 
Let me give you this analogy. A 
homeowner, their roof is falling in. The 
lot next to them comes up for sale and 
they say, gosh, I have got to buy that 
lot, and they don’t take care of their 
own home. That is, in effect, what we 
are doing with our national parks here 
in the United States of America. 
To be clear, I believe that Wisconsin 
is home to some of this country’s most 
special places, including this scenic 
and picturesque trail. On this fact, my 
Wisconsin colleagues and I agree. 
But I believe this amendment is the 
wrong approach, Mr. Speaker, and I 
would encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote on the 
amendment and the bill. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. KEATING). 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendment to H.R. 803, 
Protecting America’s Wilderness and 
Public Lands Act, which will reauthor-
ize the Cape Cod National Seashore Ad-
visory Commission until the year 2028. 
The park that would eventually be-
come the Cape Cod National Seashore 
was first conceived as a way to protect 
one of the last truly unspoiled barrier 
beaches in New England. From Chat-
ham in the south to Provincetown in 
the north, the seashore resides within 
the six towns that form the outer Cape 
Cod area. 
And since the creation of the sea-
shore, the fate of that outer cape com-
munity has been uniquely intertwined 
with the success of the national sea-
shore. 
b 0930 
Today, more than 4 million visitors 
from around the world come every year 
to experience the natural beauty and 
recreational opportunities that the 
seashore provides. In this way, the sea-
shore is a crucial, pivotal point to local 
businesses that depend on the cape’s 
tourism industry for their own liveli-
hoods and those that reside there. 
Last year, the Great American Out-
doors Act was signed into law. Our 
landmark conservation legislation will 
bring millions of dollars to rebuild and 
protect the national seashore in the 
coming years. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Last year, the Great American Out-
doors Act was signed into law. Our 
landmark legislation will bring mil-
lions of dollars that will be used to re-
build and protect the national seashore 
in the coming years. The advisory com-
mission’s role is greater than ever.

vision of then-Senator John F. Ken-
nedy, continues to be a success. Work-
ing together, making sure that this 
model of cooperation between the Fed-
eral Government and local govern-
ments in this time of necessary co-
operation with governmental inter-
action, is more important than ever as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman 
for yielding, and I thank him for in-
cluding this in our bill. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a 
moment to focus on wilderness areas. I 
know it sounds great to have a wilder-
ness area. I have enjoyed spending time 
myself in wilderness areas, and for-
estry and wilderness areas are very im-
portant to me. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
degree in forestry, and I have actually 
been licensed to practice forestry, 
taken exams to do that. I can tell you, 
Republicans, Democrats, and independ-
ents alike, we all, I think, can appre-
ciate a healthy forest because we know 
that it provides clean air, it provides 
clean water, it provides wildlife habi-
tat, and it also provides great places 
for us to do recreation. 
There are certain places where we 
need wilderness areas, but there are 
certain places where we do not need 
wilderness areas. Seven million acres 
of wilderness area went up in wildfire 
in the last 10 years. I would love to be 
able to take my colleagues out to the 
forest. They say a picture is worth a 
thousand words, but I can promise you, 
actually being in the forest tells a 
much bigger picture, a much better 
story. 
I would love to go to an area that has 
been properly managed and then go to 
a wilderness area that hasn’t been 
managed and be able to make the case 
that although we can pass these bills 
and create wilderness areas right now 
that aren’t going to affect us, because 
it takes a long time for a forest to 
grow and it takes a long time for a for-
est to degrade, but our children and 
our grandchildren are going to suffer 
the consequences of us locking these 
lands up and making them subject to 
catastrophic wildfire in the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I understand the senti-
mental value, the emotional value, in 
wanting to make more wilderness 
areas. But I wish we would have a long- 
term look and think about the impact 
that this is going to have on the future. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to take a mo-
ment to say that I have great respect 
for my colleague, the ranking member, 
and I know that he is well intentioned 
with respect to addressing wildfire 
issues. I would note, for my colleague, 
that we just recently created a Bipar-
tisan Wildfire Caucus with Representa-
tive CURTIS
to address some of the 
issues that he describes. 
But, look, with respect to the bill 
that is before the House today, there is

simply no question. This bill does not 
create any further risks from wildfire, 
far from it. As I said yesterday, the law 
as it stands today, section 4(d) provides 
for 
the 
flexibility, 
ultimately, 
for 
measures to be taken as may be nec-
essary for the control of insects, dis-
ease, and fire, subject to such condi-
tions as the Secretary of the Interior 
may deem desirable. 
So, there is flexibility within exist-
ing law to address any potential issues 
that might arise. For that reason, I 
would hope that my colleague’s con-
cerns would be alleviated and that he 
would support this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. BROWNLEY). 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 803, the Protecting 
America’s Wilderness and Public Lands 
Act. 
This bill incorporates two important 
pieces of legislation that will preserve 
the natural beauty of public lands and 
improve access to recreational oppor-
tunities in my congressional district in 
Ventura County and California. 
The first is the Central Coast Herit-
age Protection Act, which I joined Con-
gressman SALUD
CARBAJAL
in intro-
ducing. The Central Coast Heritage 
Protection Act will protect more than 
25,000 acres in the Los Padres National 
Forest and the Carrizo Plain National 
Monument by designating these lands 
as wilderness. 
It also designates the Condor Trail 
within Los Padres as a National Rec-
reational Trail. This is a beautiful trail 
that is 400 miles long. You can hike 
from Ventura County to Santa Barbara 
County surrounded by great and unique 
beauty. 
The second piece of legislation is the 
Rim of the Valley Corridor Preserva-
tion Act, which would add more than 
191,000 acres to the Santa Monica 
Mountains National Recreational Area. 
If you ever want to hike to a beautiful 
180-degree view of the Pacific Ocean, 
this is your place. Much of the land is 
in Ventura County, and I am grateful 
for Congressman ADAM SCHIFF’s efforts 
to advance this bill through the years. 
Overall, H.R. 803 is an important 
downpayment on a commitment that 
many of us made to help conserve 30 
percent of U.S. lands by 2030. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia has expired. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
BROWNLEY). 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Mr. Speaker, in 
Ventura County, my constituents and I 
are so fortunate to be surrounded by 
beautiful public spaces. The public 
lands 
provisions 
in 
this 
bill 
will 
strengthen our region’s commitment to 
sound environmental stewardship and 
preserve an important part of our nat-
ural heritage for future generations to 
enjoy. 
I know we all agree on the impor-
tance of being good stewards of our 
country’s natural lands. For these rea-
sons, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 803. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time is remaining 
on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Arkansas has 21⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Colo-
rado has 3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER). 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of my amendment to 
H.R. 803. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have seen the renewed importance of 
having safe and accessible public lands 
for our families and communities. As a 
proud Virginian, I know that Virginia’s 
public lands not only provide opportu-
nities for recreation and reflection but 
they are key to our tourism industry 
and our overall economy. 
My amendment would strengthen 
protections for two beautiful areas of 
the George Washington National For-
est, the Rough Mountain and Rich Hole 
wilderness 
areas, 
following 
rec-
ommendations from the U.S. Forest 
Service in 2014. These areas offer out-
standing scenic views, rare and endan-
gered plants, age-old hardwood forests, 
and a dense population of black bears. 
This legislation, the Virginia Wilder-
ness Additions Act, would allow these 
irreplaceable areas to remain open to 
recreation while also protecting their 
wildlife, natural resources, and trails 
for generations to come. 
I would like to thank Senators KAINE 
and WARNER for their leadership on 
this issue in the Senate, as well as Rep-
resentatives LURIA and MCEachin for 
working with me on this important 
amendment. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB), the 
newest member of our Natural Re-
sources Committee. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I would like 
to begin by thanking Chairman GRI-
JALVA, Congresswoman DEGETTE, and 
the committee staff for working with 
me on this amendment and for the con-
tinued leadership on this bill. 
The amendment incorporates envi-
ronmental justice communities like 
mine into this space. It would require a 
report on permits by providers serving 
environmental justice communities. 
This measure, first introduced last 
Congress by the soon-to-be first Native 
American Cabinet Secretary and the 
Secretary of the Interior, Congress-
woman HAALAND, is an important step 
in identifying and removing barriers to 
access our public lands. Communities 
of color, low-income communities, in-
digenous communities, and those most 
impacted by pollution and climate 
change often have the least access to 
our national parks and Federal lands. 
My 13th District Strong is an envi-
ronmental justice community, an area 
that the State calls the epicenter of 
the asthma burden due to corporate 
polluters. Folks in my district deserve 
the same opportunity to enjoy clean 
air and public lands as anyone else so 
they don’t grow up like me, thinking 
that sulfur dioxide and rotten eggs was 
just how the air smelled. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
please support this amendment. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining, if I 
might inquire? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 30 seconds remaining. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I will just 
simply say that these amendments are 
common sense. They have been vetted 
by the various stakeholders and con-
stituents in the communities that sup-
port the respective amendments that 
have been proposed as part of this 
package, and my hope is that my col-
leagues could support them. Several of 
them are bipartisan, as we have men-
tioned, and they go to the heart of this 
bill, which is ultimately protecting the 
most scenic places in our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my col-
league from Colorado’s love for the 
outdoors. I appreciate his passion to do 
what is right. 
He mentioned the provisions in the 
Wilderness Act to address insects, dis-
ease, and wildfire. Mr. Speaker, that is 
a Band-Aid. That is what you do after 
the fact. 
What we are proposing is proactive 
forest management so that you don’t 
have the insects, the disease, and the 
wildfires. An ounce of prevention is 
definitely worth a pound of cure. 
I would challenge my colleagues to 
enjoy those scenes and those vistas. I 
encourage them to take pictures so 
they can show their children and 
grandchildren what they looked like 
before they locked them away in a wil-
derness area. 
Mr. Speaker, this random assortment 
of amendments does nothing but make 
a bad bill three times worse. The only 
difference is that instead of having a 
package of eight bills that haven’t been 
through regular order that will harm 
our environment and that will kill jobs 
in rural communities, we now have a 
package of 23 bills that haven’t been 
through regular order, will harm the 
environment, and will kill jobs in rural 
communities. 
No amendment in this package re-
duces our dependence on hostile foreign 
nations or critical minerals, improves 
our supply chains, or bolsters Amer-
ican energy security. No amendment in 
this package changes how we currently 
treat forest and wilderness areas with 
century-old technology like handsaws 
and shovels. No amendment in this

package creates new jobs or bolsters 
our economic growth. 
What does this package do? It just 
adds more wilderness, more wild and 
scenic river designations, and more 
provisions that haven’t gone through 
regular order and do not have the sup-
port of Members of Congress directly 
impacted by those amendments. 
Needless to say, this isn’t how we 
should be managing our resources, and 
it isn’t how we should be legislating in 
Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to oppose this package of en 
bloc amendments, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of the amendment from Mr. TONKO and 
Mr. MCKINLEY to reauthorize and standardize 
the management of the National Heritage 
Areas, and salute them for their commitment 
across multiple sessions of Congress to insti-
tute critical, lasting protections for our nation’s 
National Heritage Areas. 
This amendment would address the hap-
hazard and confusing patchwork of authoriza-
tions for National Heritage Areas across the 
country, with two right here in my neck of the 
woods, by instituting a universal timeline to 
ensure these natural treasures are not subject 
to arbitrary lapses in authorization. These her-
itage areas create jobs, establish destinations 
that people want to visit and vacation to, and 
are a smart investment in both the economy 
and the natural environment. 
Support from the federal government is 
what provides these areas with the foundation 
needed to preserve and protect these natural 
spaces, but the work just starts there—from 
that federal support, these National Heritage 
Areas leverage countless dollars and volun-
teer hours to promote the environment and 
identity of their surrounding regions. 
Two of those treasures are especially close 
to my heart and would be reauthorized for 15 
years under this amendment—the Last Green 
Valley National Heritage Corridor and the 
Upper Housatonic Valley National Heritage 
Area. Both areas are incredible assets to east-
ern Connecticut and the Northeast with the 
Last Green Valley encompassing 35 towns 
stretching from eastern Connecticut to Massa-
chusetts. First designated as a National Herit-
age Corridor by Congress in 1994, the area 
spans 1,100 miles in Connecticut alone, re-
mains 77 percent forest and farm, and is the 
last stretch of dark night sky in the sprawl be-
tween Boston and Washington, D.C. 
My colleagues from Connecticut and Massa-
chusetts know that investments in our open 
spaces provide an enormous value for tax-
payers, and I salute our neighbor and friend 
for his amendment which would ensure that 
these wonders are protected for future genera-
tions to enjoy. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, my amend-
ment (Garamendi No. 6) to the ‘‘Protecting 
America’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act’’ 
(H.R. 803) would adjust the Congressionally 
designated boundary of the Sacramento-San 
Joaquin Delta National Heritage Area to in-
clude approximately 62 acres of adjacent pub-
licly owned land in unincorporated Solano 
County. 
I thank Rules Chairman MCGOVERN (D–MA) 
for making my noncontroversial amendment in 
order and Natural Resources Chairman GRI-
JALVA (D–AZ) for including it in the en bloc #1 
amendments today, offered by Congressman 
NEGUSE (D–CO). 
My amendment is identical to H.R. 1230, 
which I introduced on February 23, 2021, at 
the request of the City of Rio Vista. It would 
include the decommissioned United States 
Army Reserve Center (Rio Vista), U.S. Coast 
Guard Station Rio Vista, Beach Drive Waste-
water Treatment Plant (City of Rio Vista), and 
Sandy Beach County Park (Solano County) in 
the National Heritage Area. 
Two of these parcels—the decommissioned 
United States Army Reserve Center and 
Beach Drive Wastewater Treatment Plant— 
are owned by the City of Rio Vista but tech-
nically outside the city limits. As such, it ap-
pears these parcels were omitted inadvertently 
when the National Park Service prepared the 
legislative map for the then-proposed Delta 
National Heritage Area in 2010. Including 
these parcels within the National Heritage 
Area’s boundary supports the City of Rio Vis-
ta’s proposed redevelopment of the decom-
missioned United States Army Reserve Cen-
ter, now owned by the City. 
In March 2019, Congress enacted into law 
(Public Law 116–9) my legislation with U.S. 
Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN (D–CA) designating 
the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta as Califor-
nia’s first national heritage area. The Delta is 
a crown jewel of our state and an iconic work-
ing landscape, which my family has been for-
tunate to call home for over 40 years. It is the 
most productive watershed in the western 
United States and among the most eco-
logically important in the Western Hemisphere. 
Together, we must safeguard the Delta and 
the historic communities that make it such a 
special place, including Rio Vista. Expanding 
the Delta National Heritage Area will ensure 
that the proposed redevelopment of the de-
commissioned Rio Vista Army base and simi-
lar projects on the adjacent publicly owned 
land are eligible to apply for the $10 million in 
federal grant funding available until 2034. 
I urge all Members to support my amend-
ment and the underlying bill, which I will work 
to enact into law before California’s Delta Pro-
tection Commission completes the manage-
ment plan for the National Heritage Area.

AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MR. CURTIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now 
in order to consider amendment No. 3 
printed in part B of House Report 117– 
6. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I have an 
amendment at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
At the end of the bill, add the following 
new title: 
TITLE IX—RENEWABLE ENERGY INPUTS 
ACCESS STUDY 
SEC. 901. STUDY. 
The Secretary of the Interior, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Energy and Sec-
retary of Commerce, shall conduct a study to 
determine whether the acreage to be with-
drawn under this Act contains geothermal 
resources, or minerals needed for battery 
storage, renewable energy technology, and 
electric vehicles. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 147, the gen-
tleman from Utah (Mr. CURTIS) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Utah. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of my amendment to require a study of 
any land impacted by the legislation to 
determine if these areas contain geo-
thermal resources or minerals needed 
for battery storage, renewable energy 
technology, or electric vehicles. 
We agree that we want to reduce 
human emissions that are polluting 
our ecosystem. Renewable energy will 
play a role long into the future, and we 
must ensure we have the resources 
needed to make solar panels, wind tur-
bines, and batteries here in America. 
President Biden agrees. Just yester-
day he issued an executive order to en-
sure the United States has access to 
domestic critical minerals. President 
Biden’s fact sheet on the executive 
order says: ‘‘While the U.S. is a net ex-
porter of electric vehicles, we are not a 
leader in the supply chain associated 
with electric battery production. The 
U.S. could better leverage our sizable 
lithium reserves and manufacturing 
know-how to expand domestic battery 
production.’’ 
To state the obvious, if we are acci-
dentally locking up lithium with this 
bill while President Biden says we 
should do the opposite, this is some-
thing Congress should know. This 
amendment does not prevent any part 
of the lands package from being imple-
mented, as currently drafted. 
I am a strong supporter of the local- 
driven public lands legislation, which 
is why I ensured my amendment would 
not impact any of the bills on the 
ground level. There is parts of this 
package 
I 
actually 
support. 
Mr. 
HUFFMAN’s bill included in the public 
lands bill was supported by me last 
year. 
This amendment is not a criticism of 
this lands package. It is about listen-
ing to science and combating climate 
change. More information is always 
better, more science is better. That is 
all this amendment does, give us more 
science-backed information as Con-
gress faces the issues of producing re-
newable energy in the future.

February 26, 2021 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to the amend-
ment. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Colorado is recognized for 
5 minutes. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to say, first, I 
appreciate the gentleman’s remarks on 
this amendment. My friend from Utah, 
I know from our work together last 
Congress and this Congress and from 
our bipartisan work on the Congres-
sional Wildfire Caucus that the gen-
tleman is sincere in his intent that he, 
too, wants to help address the climate 
crisis and the threat that it poses to 
our communities, and I thank him for 
that. 
However, to that end, I would encour-
age the gentleman and his colleagues 
to continue to work with us across the 
aisle on opportunities to create clean, 
green, well-paying jobs for all Ameri-
cans. Ultimately, I will be opposing the 
gentleman’s 
amendment 
because 
I 
don’t believe it is in the best interest 
of this particular legislation. 
As we have heard over the course of 
the debate this morning and yesterday, 
of course, on the bill, the various areas 
that are protected in this bill were in-
cluded at the request of local commu-
nities who want to see these lands pro-
tected for future generations. 
One example, perhaps the most sa-
lient in my view, is the Thompson Di-
vide region in my bill, the CORE Act, 
which has faced years of pressure to de-
velop certain mineral interests that 
local 
stakeholders, 
including 
the 
ranching community, oppose. 
The largest individual withdrawal 
area in this bill actually surrounds the 
Grand Canyon, a region with few iden-
tified critical mineral resources, but 
one that I believe we can all agree is of 
enormous importance to the American 
public. That importance, that value of 
the Grand Canyon, as well as every 
area included in this bill, is ultimately 
why we are here today. 
It is why my colleagues have gone 
through years of painstaking work de-
veloping a consensus with those local 
communities to identify those lands of 
such exceptional value that they be-
lieve and the communities believe 
should be protected for future genera-
tions. 
The bottom line is this: We believe 
that some places should be set aside 
permanently from extraction because 
some landscapes, like the Grand Can-
yon, are simply too special to be 
mined, drilled, or excavated. 
Mr. Speaker, with that, I respectfully 
oppose the gentleman’s amendment, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, to my 
friend from Colorado, I welcome his in-
vitation to work together on many of 
these issues. I point out that we are 
simply asking for a study so that we 
know what is there. We are not stop-
ping anything. We are simply asking 
for a study. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WESTERMAN). 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Utah for his 
tireless work on doing what is right for 
the environment. I use that word ‘‘en-
vironment,’’ and not the word ‘‘cli-
mate,’’ because I want people to under-
stand that those two things are dif-
ferent. 
Climate is very narrowly focused. 
Climate is an issue that has made car-
bon, a necessary element, arch enemy 
number one. Republicans are about a 
cleaner, safer, and healthier environ-
ment. We are concerned not just about 
carbon in the atmosphere, but we are 
concerned about forest health, about 
air quality, about water quality, about 
wildlife habitat, about having great 
places for recreation. 
Mr. Speaker, nobody wants to mine 
inside the Grand Canyon. Nobody is 
mining inside the Grand Canyon. No-
body ever will mine inside the Grand 
Canyon. We have already got the Grand 
Canyon National Park that establishes 
those boundaries, and these mineral 
withdrawals are far outside of the ac-
tual Grand Canyon. 
Mr. Speaker, we want a clean envi-
ronment. We want a healthy environ-
ment. We are all for cleaner tech-
nology, but that cleaner technology 
takes certain things. It takes minerals 
and elements. It takes research and de-
velopment. It takes using all of the en-
ergy sources that we have. 
Why can’t we talk about creating 
more next-generation nuclear power? 
It has zero carbon. If your concern is 
about climate, your concern is about 
carbon. And nuclear energy doesn’t 
emit carbon. 
Why not put hydroelectric plants on 
existing dams? 
We don’t have to build new dams. We 
can add 12,000 megawatts of clean, car-
bon-free hydropower on existing dams. 
We can use the natural resources that 
we have and develop cleaner ways to 
use them. 
As we develop more electrical compo-
nents and devices that, again, run on 
carbon-free energy, unless that energy 
is produced from carbon sources, but 
we have to have a stable and reliable 
supply of energy, and we can’t have 
that 
without 
developing 
these 
re-
sources. 
I appreciate the gentleman’s concern 
about not locking up these resources 
and doing a study to make sure that 
when we lock them up, we are not lock-
ing away our future, we are not taking 
away the ability for this country to 
produce our own energy supply, that 
we are not further relying on a foreign 
supply chain that is controlled by Com-
munist parties. 
Mr. Speaker, we are blessed with a 
resource-rich country, but we are right 
now at the mercy of foreign suppliers, 
especially China, to meet our mineral 
needs. Resources like lithium, cobalt, 
gallium, and dozens more will be need-
ed in the billions of pounds to meet the 
projected growth in electric vehicles 
and other renewable technologies. Even 
commodities like copper, which have 
historically been produced in surplus, 
are now falling short of demand. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage supporting 
the gentleman’s amendment. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I wonder 
if my colleague might engage in just a 
brief colloquy so I understand the 
scope of the amendment. What is the 
most common way to assess geo-
thermal or other mineral resources? I 
yield to the gentleman from Utah. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my colleague. I suspect you have an 
answer ready to tell me, and I would 
love to hear that. 
Mr. NEGUSE. The gentleman is cor-
rect, I do have an answer. The most 
common way is to drill. That is the 
most common way to assess geo-
thermal and mineral resources. 
With much respect to the gentleman, 
because, again, I know his intent is sin-
cere, but this amendment is not simply 
a study amendment. This study amend-
ment, ultimately, if it were to succeed, 
would have the Interior Department 
drilling countless wells throughout 
these wilderness areas to ultimately 
ascertain the information that the dis-
tinguished gentleman seeks, and I just 
don’t think that is a prudent way for-
ward. 
I would say to the distinguished 
ranking member, with respect to the 
areas around the Grand Canyon, that 
the southwest United States, as I know 
some of my colleagues are certainly fa-
miliar, is littered with remnants of 
abandoned uranium mines and mill 
sites that poison the water and the air 
to this day, and those mines have hit 
Tribal nations the hardest. 
So you can understand why the dis-
tinguished chairman of our committee, 
Chairman GRIJALVA, would feel so com-
pelled by local communities in the 
State that he represents to move for-
ward with the Grand Canyon protec-
tions that are a part of this important 
wilderness package. 
Mr. Speaker, while I very much re-
spect my colleague and look forward to 
working with him on future proposals, 
we respectfully oppose this amendment 
and would ask for a ‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 147, the pre-
vious 
question 
is 
ordered 
on 
the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Utah (Mr. CURTIS). 
The question is on the amendment. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appear to have it. 
Mr. CURTIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand 
the 
yeas 
and 
nays.

TITLE 
IX—PRESERVING 
WILDERNESS 
CHARACTER AND WILD AND SCENIC 
RIVER CHARACTER 
SEC. 901. PRESERVING WILDERNESS AND WILD 
AND SCENIC RIVER CHARACTER. 
(a) WILDERNESS.—The Secretary of Agri-
culture or the Secretary of the Interior, as 
appropriate, may exempt from any wilder-
ness 
or 
potential 
wilderness 
designated 
under this Act any area determined by that 
Secretary not to meet the definition of wil-
derness under the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. 
1131 et seq.). 
(b) WILD
AND
SCENIC
RIVERS.—The Sec-
retary of Agriculture or the Secretary of the

this Act any area determined by that Sec-
retary not to meet the qualifications for a 
wild, scenic or recreational river under the 
Wild and Scenic Rivers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et 
seq.). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 147, the gen-
tleman from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE) 
and the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. 
WESTERMAN) each will control 10 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Colorado. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of the en bloc amendments that would 
offer important improvements to the 
underlying bill. 
Unfortunately, this en bloc is only a 
fraction of the amendments Repub-
licans would have offered if Democrats 
had held a markup on the bill in the 
Natural Resources Committee. 
It is egregious that House Democrats 
rejected every single Republican recre-
ation and wildfire amendment offered 
at the Rules Committee. House Demo-
crats 
also 
denied 
Representative 
BOEBERT
of Colorado the chance to 
offer a single amendment to this legis-
lation, despite the fact that one-third 
of all wilderness designations con-
tained in the entire bill are in her dis-
trict, and she has never had the chance 
to even debate it, as a new Member of 
Congress. 
One amendment that I offered is in-
cluded in this package, and it would 
rectify the fact that Democrats have 
arbitrarily included tens of thousands 
of acres of wilderness designations that 
have not been recommended for wilder-
ness or do not meet the basic definition 
of wilderness in the Wilderness Act. 
If my Democratic colleagues feel so 
confident that every single acre in this 
bill is actually worthy of a wilderness 
designation, they should have no prob-
lem supporting my simple amendment 
to reaffirm proper wilderness charac-
teristics. 
Also included in these amendments is 
a proposal from one of our freshmen 
members of the Natural Resources 
Committee, 
Representative 
MOORE 
from Utah. It will protect the rights of 
counties to have a say in local land use 
by requiring county approval of wilder-
ness designations.

Representative STAUBER also offered 
a version of this amendment for min-
eral withdrawals and several amend-
ments that would exclude congres-
sional districts represented by Mem-
bers of Congress who were not con-
sulted on this legislation and strongly 
oppose it. 
This should not be a difficult hurdle 
to overcome. In fact, it should be a de-
sirable outcome for the sponsor of 
these bills. Forcing land management 
decisions upon local communities with-
out their support is a bad idea. 
b 1000 
Another one of our freshman com-
mittee 
members, 
Representative 
HERRELL
of New Mexico, offered an 
amendment to remove all potential 
wilderness designations in the bill. 
This bill designates an amount of area 
equivalent to the size of President 
Biden’s home State of Delaware, and it 
includes only one wilderness study area 
release. We shouldn’t be adding poten-
tial wilderness to this bill without re-
leasing an equivalent amount of wil-
derness study area first. 
Finally, this package of amendments 
would improve our American energy 
security by ensuring continued devel-
opment of critical energy infrastruc-
ture, promoting the responsible utiliza-
tion of domestic critical minerals, fa-
cilitating rights-of-way for utilities, 
and protecting jobs in the energy sec-
tor. In contrast, the underlying bill is 
just an extension of the Biden ban and 
will hurt rural jobs and our national 
security. 
Mr. Speaker, I wish that Democrats 
afforded us more than 10 minutes to 
consider these amendments that would 
actually improve our environment and 
economy through conservation and 
multiple use. 
Mr. Speaker, I would urge all of my 
colleagues to strongly support this en 
bloc of amendments, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to en bloc No. 2. 
The amendments in this bloc run the 
gauntlet of ideological opposition to 
wilderness, public lands protections, 
and our efforts that respond to the cli-
mate crisis. The amendments are not a 
good-faith effort to attempt to improve 
the bill or work with the Democratic 
sponsors of the committee. They sim-
ply seek to outright reverse or fun-
damentally weaken the various des-
ignations proposed in this bill. 
In many cases, if these amendments 
were adopted and signed into law, the 
result would leave these areas with 
fewer protections than they currently 
have under the status quo. 
Now, I heard a lot of wide-ranging ar-
guments against this bill from the dis-
tinguished ranking member, but let me 
just begin by responding to two points 
specifically: 
First, with respect to this notion of 
having local community support, I 
would simply say—and I welcome my 
colleague to come visit my district in 
the State of Colorado. I represent a dis-
trict that is the size of New Jersey—far 
bigger 
than 
Delaware—10 
counties, 
stretches all the way to the Wyoming 
border, Grand County, half of Eagle 
County, Summit County. I look for-
ward to taking the ranking member to 
my district in Colorado and showing 
him these incredible places that we 
seek to protect, because I believe if he 
has a chance to visit them, I may be 
able to convince him of the same. 
I also just say, secondly, with respect 
to the process complaints, as I said 
yesterday, every title of this bill was 
heard, was marked up, passed out of 
committee, and passed this Chamber, 
on this floor in the 116th Congress—not 
once, twice. 
So I understand the gentleman’s de-
sire to have more amendments. I think 
it is a bit odd to be arguing that he is 
unable to amend the bill when he is lit-
erally debating the amendments that 
he is offering as they exist today, that 
we are proceeding to debate in this 
fashion. 
In any event, I will simply say that 
these amendments, as I said earlier, 
are not a good-faith attempt to im-
prove this bill, and for that reason we 
would oppose them. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
would love to visit the gentleman’s dis-
trict, take some photos so that we 
could show future generations what it 
looked like before it was locked away 
in wilderness, and maybe be able to 
talk about some of those forest man-
agement activities and how it could 
help improve the area. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Minnesota 
(Mr. 
STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the amendments 
contained in this en bloc package, 
which includes three of my own and 
two I offer on behalf of my good friend 
and colleague, Mr. GOSAR. 
The amendments I offer restore con-
trol to locals who not only recreate in 
the areas impacted by the underlying 
bill, but live and earn their livelihoods 
there, too. This is about northern Ari-
zona and western Colorado. This is 
about uranium formations in Rep-
resentative GOSAR’s district, and oil 
and gas in Representatives LAMBORN’S 
and BOEBERT’S districts. This is about 
local governance and listening to those 
who live and work in the area, not just 
those who make it a short weekend re-
treat. 
The amendments I offer today move 
control of land back to those who gov-
ern best. These amendments exempt 
the bill from taking effect in Arizona’s 
Fourth, Colorado’s Third, and Colo-
rado’s Fifth Congressional Districts, 
and require county input. Those who 
represent these districts were not 
meaningfully consulted on these bills. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter from the Mohave County Board 
of Supervisors in support of Represent-
ative GOSAR’s amendment No. 7. These 
are the folks who know best for their 
families, their neighbors, and their 
land. 
MOHAVE COUNTY BOARD 
OF SUPERVISORS, 
Kingman, AZ, February 24, 2021. 
Hon. PAUL GOSAR, 
Washington, DC. 
CONGRESSMAN GOSAR: The Mohave County 
Board of Supervisors is writing to offer our 
support for your amendment to H.R. 803— 
Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021. As you 
know, the passage of this legislation will 
have a grave effect on Mohave County, Ari-
zona, and our neighboring counties in Utah. 
Uranium mining in the past has been the 
forefront of our economic growth in Mohave 
County and if allowed to continue will bring 
in nearly $29 billion to our local economy 
over a 42 year period. The passage of H.R. 803 
would make permanent a 2012 moratorium 
on uranium mining in our area. The lan-
guage of your amendment would help allevi-
ate the permanent economic loss we would 
sustain under the passage of H.R. 803. We 
strongly support the passing of this amend-
ment as presented in the Rules Committee 
and the House of Representatives. Without 
this amendment, the financial stability of 
our economy in Mohave County would dras-
tically suffer. 
In 2012, the Secretary of the Interior im-
posed a 20 year ban on over 1 million acres of 
land in the Arizona Strip Area for the pur-
pose of Uranium mining. This ban included 
both public lands and National Forest Sys-
tem lands. This ban took away much needed 
growth and jobs from our area. Secretary 
Salazar at the time issued this withdrawal 
without complying with the law requiring 
coordination with local governments. The 
Federal Land Policy Management Act, 43 
USC Section 1711 requires that the Secretary 
and his designees ‘‘coordinate’’ with local 
government as to development and imple-
mentation of any plan or management ac-
tion. Coordination is defined in the Act as 
requiring prior notice of proposed plans and 
actions to the local government officials 
(‘‘prior’’ meaning prior to public announce-
ments, and early enough to provide ‘‘mean-
ingful’’ participation by the local officials in 
the ‘‘development’’ of the plan or action.). 
The congressional mandate or coordination 
also requires the Secretary to use all prac-
ticable means to reach consistency between 
the federal plan/management action and 
local policy, plan or law. All of which Sec-
retary Salazar did not do. 
Making this ban permanent based on mis-
information will have lasting effects on Mo-
have County. We respect and take a responsi-
bility for protecting the Grand Canyon, but 
saying that the Grand Canyon will suffer be-
cause of mining is inaccurate. Secretary 
Salazar’s reasoning behind the withdrawal 
was out of concern that it could damage the 
region’s drinking water and the park’s water 
quality. Bureau of Land Management offi-
cials contradicted those claims by explaining 
that their Arizona Strip field office had no 
evidence of contamination of water, and had 
no evidence of problems with the safe oper-
ation of the uranium mines in operation on 
the lands. 
Uranium mining is important and useful 
for many reasons. The lands in the ‘‘Strip’’ 
contain the nation’s high grade uranium de-
posits and enough uranium to provide power 
generation for the state of California for 
over 20 years. Uranium is useful in many 
ways. It is used by our military for national 
security and defense. Uranium metal is very 
dense and heavy. When it is depleted (DU), 
uranium is used by the military as shielding 
to protect Army tanks, and also in parts of

bullets and missiles. The military also uses 
enriched uranium to power nuclear propelled 
Navy ships and submarines, and in nuclear 
weapons. A permanent withdrawal of ura-
nium mining from the ‘‘Strip’’ harms the 
American people by removing between 326– 
375 million lbs (the equivalent electricity 
generating capacity for the entire state of 
California’s 40 million people for 22.4 years) 
of uranium. 
From a national security standpoint, do-
mestic utilities now import 90% of the ura-
nium used to operate America’s 104 nuclear 
reactors. Thirty years ago, these reactors 
used U.S. mined uranium for 100% of elec-
tricity production. The nation cannot be pro- 
nuclear and anti-nuclear fuel. In sum, these 
deposits represent the last available use of 
our public lands for economic growth in our 
region. 
The opponents of uranium mining have 
chosen to ignore the fact that mining with 
environmentally sound reclamation was con-
ducted from the early 1980s until the price of 
uranium collapsed in 1993. No mining at all 
occurred from 1993 until 2010, and the 
Denison mine which is now operating, is fol-
lowing and often exceeding all environ-
mental and safety laws. 
Arizona needs to go back to the roots that 
led to Arizona being developed, and that is 
mining. The strict federal and state environ-
mental laws already on the books will pro-
tect the public from environmental damage 
to the Grand Canyon watershed. The mining 
of uranium however does not affect ground 
water nor destroy the natural resources of 
the land. It does not require open pit mining. 
Upon completion of mining one Breccia Pipe 
(4 years) the land is placed back into its na-
tive state. 
We want to thank you for putting forward 
this amendment. Nuclear energy can be the 
future of clean energy. We have the re-
sources in this Country to ensure that hap-
pens and we have the technology and means 
to ensure mining that energy is both envi-
ronmentally safe and protects our natural 
resources. We stand in support of the amend-
ment. 
Sincerely, 
BUSTER JOHNSON, 
Chairman, 
Mohave County Board of Supervisors. 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this en bloc, and a ‘‘no’’ 
on the underlying bill. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman and I also thank the 
chairman of the Committee on Natural 
Resources and my fellow Arizonan, 
dean of our delegation, Congressman 
RAU´ L GRIJALVA, for their leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, when people think of 
Arizona, they think of our Grand Can-
yon—perfectly chiseled over millions of 
years by the Colorado River. Its beauty 
and scale are humbling. But to us, it 
represents so much more than a nat-
ural wonder. 
The Grand Canyon National Park 
welcomes 6 million visitors a year. It is 
the cornerstone of our State’s tourism 
industry, directly supporting almost 
10,000 jobs. Though it is special to all, 
it is sacred to the indigenous commu-
nities who call it home and who know 
better than anyone how critical it is to 
protect. 
It is simple: This is no place for ura-
nium mining. We can’t risk the health 
of the communities that rely on this 
land and water or the delicate eco-
systems it contains. We cannot im-
prove upon this wonder, and we should 
not play a part in its destruction. 
Mr. Speaker, I support protecting the 
Grand Canyon, and I am proud of the 
vote we will take later today to safe-
guard it for future generations. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of my amendments that would 
strike all potential wilderness designa-
tions from this bill. A wilderness des-
ignation is one of the most restrictive 
designations that the Federal Govern-
ment can put on a piece of land. They 
put limits on forest management ac-
tivities, access for emergency and mili-
tary personnel, and limit access for the 
general public. 
As we have seen across the West, 
areas designated as potential wilder-
ness or wilderness study areas sit in 
limbo for decades. Criteria for what 
constitutes a wilderness area is very 
clear 
and 
straightforward. 
Keeping 
lands under potential wilderness or wil-
derness study area designations for ex-
tended periods of time is unnecessary 
and greatly handicaps rural commu-
nities in the West. 
Mr. Speaker, let me emphasize: Many 
of the counties affected by these poten-
tial wilderness designations are al-
ready living in lands with over 80 per-
cent publicly managed lands. Many of 
my Eastern colleagues may not appre-
ciate what that means for local govern-
ments in the affected counties when I 
say a county is over 80 percent public 
land. Public lands are not taxable, 
meaning that the local tax base for 
counties that have high amounts of 
Federal 
lands 
is 
extremely 
small, 
therefore, their multiple use on these 
lands prevented by this legislation is 
crucial for economic success. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just note for the record with reference 
to ‘‘Eastern colleagues,’’ I represent 
the State of Colorado, my colleague, 
Representative 
DEGETTE, 
represents 
the State of Colorado, the vast major-
ity of the sponsors of this bill rep-
resents Western States. My district is 
not all that far from the gentle-
woman’s district in New Mexico. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from Colo-
rado (Ms. DEGETTE), the dean of our 
delegation. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I just 
couldn’t let this go. Insinuating that 
the sponsors of this legislation, on all 
the titles of this legislation have not 
been to these areas and that these des-
ignations do not have local support is 
simply untrue. 
Two-thirds of the individuals in the 
affected areas in title 1 of my part of 
the bill, which have been mostly man-
aged as wilderness study areas for 40 
years, support wilderness. Scores of 
local public officials, scores of local 
mayors, city councils, and, yes, county 
commissioners 
have 
supported 
this 
over the years. 
I personally have been to almost 
every area in the legislation. I have 
met with scores of businesses, local 
elected officials, and citizens, and I 
challenge anybody to go look at these 
very special areas and tell me that 
they should not be preserved for future 
generations. 
The same goes for every single title 
of this legislation. It has been vetted, 
it has been revetted, and it has been re-
vetted again, and it has strong reasons 
for designation as public lands, and it 
has strong local support. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Utah (Mr. MOORE). 
Mr. MOORE of Utah. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to rise in 
support of these amendments. Utah 
ranks second in the country for per-
centage of land owned by the Federal 
Government, so we understand the 
challenges and opportunities that come 
with land designations. 
Mr. Speaker, with Utah’s interests in 
mind, I introduced a commonsense 
amendment that would require local 
land officials to approve wilderness 
designations, empowering the local 
communities to work with the Federal 
Government on major land decisions, 
and the previous comments actually 
emphasize the importance of that. And 
I appreciate that, and I respect that, 
the local input that the gentlewoman 
was mentioning. 
Our system works best when there is 
close collaboration between all levels 
in government. Our State and local 
governments see firsthand obstacles to 
successfully managing their resources, 
and they are experts in their commu-
nities’ unique needs and concerns. As 
policymakers, we have a responsibility 
to bring local officials to the table so 
that we can make the most informed 
land decisions possible. 
Wilderness areas can be beautiful, 
but these designations bring many 
challenges. Our Federal lands will be 
best managed when we include our con-
stituents’ perspectives. Unfortunately, 
this process has denied my Republican 
colleagues and me the ability to do just 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote for these very sensible and reason-
able amendments. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just say to my colleague: One, I want 
to welcome him to the United States 
Congress, and I thank him for his 
thoughtful recitation with respect to 
the amendment he offered. 
But I just want to assure him, for ex-
ample, with respect to the CORE Act, 
my provision of this bill, it has the 
support of every county in which a part 
of the bill is designated. That is to say, 
in the areas where there are protec-
tions being made in the bill, the coun-
ties in those areas support this bill. 
And that is why this bill has attracted 
such bipartisan support back home in

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of

I inquire how much time both sides

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-

from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT), who,

proposed in this wilderness area, to tell 
the House about how the people there 
really feel. 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Arkansas for yield-
ing. I thank Mr. STAUBER for working 
with me on several amendments that 
protect Colorado’s Third Congressional 
District. All 11 of my amendments to 
give voice to the people in my district 
were denied. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill targets my dis-

know that it will cause and activities 
it will prevent.

ASSOCIATION,

Re 2021 Omnibus Wilderness & Amendments. 
Congresswoman LAUREN BOEBERT, 
Att: Jeff Smalls & Ashley Higgins, 
Washington DC. 
DEAR JEFF AND ASHLEY: Please accept this 
correspondence as the comments of the 
above referenced Organizations vigorously 
opposing the CORE Wilderness Proposal (HR 
803) and the Colorado Wilderness Act (HR577) 
hereinafter referred to as ‘‘the Proposal’’. 
After a detailed review of the Proposal, the 
Organizations have concluded that every 
area expanded or created in the Proposal 
would result in significant lost recreational 
opportunities for the overwhelming portion 
of visitors to the Proposal area, both cur-
rently and in the future. While there are sig-
nificant lost opportunities, there is also no 
additional 
protections 
for 
multiple 
use 
routes that might remain outside the Wilder-
ness areas and no new areas are designated 
or released for multiple use recreational op-
portunities. 
The Organizations have spent many years 
trying to hammer out something that works 
for everyone around these proposals, and 
have simply been stonewalled at every turn 
by the sponsors of this legislation in both 
Houses of Congress. This is despite the fact 
our groups were thanked by outgoing Sen-
ator Mark Udall for our collaboration and ef-
forts around the development of the Hermosa 
Creek Watershed Management legislation 
signed into law on December 19, 2014 as Sec-
tion 3062 in the Carl Levin and Howard P. 
‘‘Buck’’ McKeon National Defense Author-
ization Act for Fiscal Year 2015 (PL 113–291). 
This legislation released a WSA and specifi-
cally protected motorized usage in the area 
moving forward, designated a large special 
management area where multiple uses were 
protected and designated Wilderness in areas 
where that management was appropriate. We 
had hoped this collaboration was a roadmap 
for resolving many of the ongoing challenges 
we encounter around Wilderness designation 
and releases. Unfortunately, we were incor-
rect as exemplified by the efforts around HR 
577 and HR 803 as phone calls are not re-
turned, meetings are continued and ideolog-
ical trench warfare has returned around 
these Proposals. 
It is worth noting, the Colorado Wilderness 
Act would heavily impact many recently de-
veloped trail networks that have enjoyed 
strong bi-partisan and community support or 
historical trail networks that serve a wide 
range of interests. Examples of these types 
of losses would include: 
1. Bangs Canyon area, which developed an 
extensive multiple use trail network after a 
complete NEPA review and analysis and al-
most a million dollars in direct funding from 
users for the project. The Bangs Canyon 
SMA area is now to be designated as Wilder-
ness. 
2. Delores Canyon—this area has a large 
network of trails serving a wide range of in-
terests that has existed for an extended pe-
riod of time without controversy. 
While the list above is far from exhaustive, 
these are examples of impacts we are seeing 
all too frequently. 
A. OUR POSITION ON SPECIFIC AMENDMENTS 
Please note that while we do not specifi-
cally address every Amendment, several of 
these are unrelated to recreational usages 
and outside our expertise to discuss in a 
meaningful manner. While we are not op-
posed to any of the Amendments on the list, 
we are not taking a position. 
1. Rep. Boebert 30x30 Program Nullifica-
tion Amendment #18: 
Vigorously support. This Executive Order 
is a direct conflict with multiple mandates 
that have managed public lands successfully 
for decades. Not only does this EO conflict 
with these mandates, the application of 
these concepts to private property rights and 
interests is even more troubling. 
2. 
Rep. 
Boebert—BLM 
headquarters— 
Amendment #16: 
Vigorously support. Moving BLM national 
headquarters closer to lands owned and man-
aged by BLM has greatly increased the re-
sponsiveness of the BLM to a wide range of 
issues. This amendment has garnered strong 
bipartisan support. 
3. Rep. Boebert Native Americans, Other 
Minorities and Women Jobs Protection Act— 
Amendment #60: 
No position. 
4. Rep. Boebert CO, AZ, CA, WA Wilderness 
Study Act Amendment #56: 
Vigorously support. The lingering designa-
tions around the Wilderness process create 
significant management challenges moving 
forward in areas that have never been suit-
able for designation as Wilderness. The loss 
of historical recreational opportunities due 
to the lingering designation of the West Nee-
dles WSA was a major issue driving the 
Hermosa Creek legislation. 
BOARD OF COUNTY COMMISSIONERS, 
ARCHULETA COUNTY, COLORADO, 
Pagosa Springs, CO, February 24, 2021. 
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The Archuleta 
County Board of County Commissioners is 
opposed to H.R. 803, the ‘‘Protecting Amer-
ica’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act’’. This 
bill would lock-up nearly 1.5 million acres 
with new wilderness designations. We agree 
with Congressman Doug Lamborn’s state-
ments that the American people deserve to 
access our nation’s public lands—not to be 
locked out of them and that a wilderness 
designation does not guarantee the protec-
tion of these lands. 
We 
support 
Congresswoman 
Lauren 
Boebert’s amendments to the bill and ask 
that the House allow local governments to 
make the right decisions for their commu-
nities, especially when it comes to managing 
our beautiful outdoors. 
Please feel free to contact us if you want 
to discuss this matter further. Thank you for 
your consideration. 
Sincerely yours, 
ALVIN SCHAAF, 
Chairman, Board of County Commissioners.

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, 
February 24, 2021. 
Congresswoman LAUREN BOEBERT, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN BOEBERT: On behalf 
of the 900 small businesses employing 37,000 
people that the Grand Junction Area Cham-
ber of Commerce represents, I am writing to 
encourage you to oppose H.R. 803, a bill that 
would lock up public lands in Mesa County 
and negatively impact our local economy. 
Our community’s economy is still reliant in 
part on the business activity generated by 
our legacy industries of agriculture and en-
ergy. This bill if passed will negatively im-
pact our already fragile economy and jeop-
ardize our economic recovery. 
These are lands that are literally in our 
backyard in Mesa County yet Congress-
woman DeGette continues to ignore us, does 
not meet with us, and does not even consider 
the consequences of her bill on the hard-
working families of our areas. 
In addition to opposing H.R. 803 our organi-
zation supports the various amendments you 
are proposing be added to the bill that in-
clude keeping the BLM Headquarters in 
Grand Junction, Colorado, requiring that af-
fected counties must approve the Wilderness 
Designation and protects grazing and water 
rights. 
We appreciate your efforts to help retain 
jobs and the diversity of our local economy 
by opposing H.R. 803 and offering amend-
ments to help preserve the livelihood of our 
families and our way of life. 
Sincerely, 
DIANE SCHWENKE, 
President/CEO.

MESA COUNTY, 
BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS, 
Grand Junction, CO, February 25, 2021. 
Re Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021, H.R. 803. 
Hon. DIANA DEGETTE, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR
REPRESENTATIVE
DEGETTE: As the 
Board of County Commissioners (‘‘Board’’) 
for Mesa County, Colorado, we are again 
writing in strong opposition to the Colorado 
Wilderness Act of 2021, H.R. 803 (‘‘the Act’’). 
Mesa County’s opposition to additional Wil-
derness designation within Mesa County is 
clearly documented in ‘‘A Resolution of the 
Board Of County Commissioners of Mesa 
County, Colorado Opposing the Colorado Wil-
derness Act of 2015 (H.R. 3336) and Calling on 
Congress to Release All Wilderness Study 
Areas in Colorado’’ (attached) passed and 
adopted on September 21, 2015, and the letter 
of opposition to the Colorado Wilderness Act 
of 2019, dated June 24, 2019 (attached). 
Wilderness designations are the most re-
strictive land management tool available 
and are in direct conflict with the multiple 
use mandate of our federally managed lands. 
As federally managed lands, these areas are 
subject to customized protections through 
various designations identified in area re-
source management plans, including prohibi-
tion of grazing, seasonal travel limitations 
and closures, and oil and gas lease stipula-
tions. 
Mesa County supports less restrictive fed-
eral designations that involve appropriate, 
special management protections determined 
through responsible land use planning that 
allow stakeholders to work together to iden-
tify and address issues with local solutions 
for each unique area, rather than a broad- 
brush approach that ends multiple use of 
these lands in perpetuity. 
The Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021 egre-
giously fails to take into account several im-
portant considerations concerning necessary 
access, such as: 
1. Three of the five proposed Wilderness 
areas in Mesa County have experienced 
wildfires over the past two decades. Lack of 
access for wildfire mitigation, proper extin-
guishment, and post-fire restoration in-
creases the probability and severity of dev-
astating wildfires. Lack of access also com-
pounds the potential for life-safety emer-
gencies as responding personnel will be ob-
structed 
when 
answering 
time-sensitive 
calls. 
2. Based on the mapping provided by the 
Colorado Oil and Gas Commission, the pro-
posed Little Book Cliffs Wilderness polygon 
includes the Laramie Energy, LLC Winter 
Flats well and the Maralex Resources, Inc. 
USA–610S98W well. These wells will need on-
going maintenance and monitoring. Should 
access be denied for these wells and the 
leases within the proposed Wilderness areas, 
the lessee should be fairly compensated. 
3. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), 
as the agency responsible for the health and 
well being of the wild horses of the Little 
Book Cliffs Wild Horse Area and their habi-
tat, must access to this area to ‘‘sustain a 
healthy viable wild horse population while 
maintaining a thriving natural ecological 
balance of resources and uses.’’ The BLM uti-
lizes vehicles, and at times helicopters, for 
set-up and take down of traps and transpor-
tation of gathered horses, and to perform fer-
tility control measures. Loss of access for 
these events could lead to serious con-
sequences for the wild horses, area habitat, 
and surrounding property owners. 
4. More than 850 acres of Gunnison Sage- 
Grouse Habitat are included in the proposed 
South Bangs Canyon Proposed Wilderness 
area and The Palisade Proposed Wilderness 
area which could limit management activi-
ties, lek counting, and habitat restoration 
activities by the US Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice. 
5. Non-motorized trail based recreation is 
critical for our region’s quality of life and 
economy. The potential for exclusion of 
mechanized travel, e.g. bicycles, from thou-
sands of acres of public lands in western Col-
orado is not supported by the Board. Of par-
ticular concern is the North and South 
Bangs Canyon Proposed Wilderness areas. 
Given the proximity to and importance of 
the Tabeguache Trail, the region is of inter-
est to local trail groups for future trail based 
recreation growth. 
6. The Act eliminates ‘‘development for 
any new irrigation and pumping facility, res-
ervoir, water conservation work, aqueduct, 
canal, ditch, pipeline, well, hydropower 
project, transmission, other ancillary facil-
ity or other water, diversion, storage, or car-
riage structure’’ in the Wilderness designa-
tion. As Colorado’s water resources require 
more astute management, eliminating the 
option to create and expand necessary water 
storage and delivery systems and the ability 
to improve critical drainages and watersheds 
indefinitely is imprudent. 
In addition to ending critical access and 
multiple use of public lands, the Board be-
lieves Wilderness designations also: 
1. unfairly discriminates against those 
that are unable to walk or ride horseback, 
including those with disabilities and the el-
derly; 
2. creates additional hardships on adjacent 
property owners, lessees, and other nonrecre-
ation users who face restricted travel; and, 
3. abolishes future productive uses of all 
resources within the designated area, includ-
ing those that enrich residents and visitors’ 
lives, in perpetuity. 
Mesa County is comprised of more than 
72% public lands. Our economy and way of 
life are deeply reliant on these lands, and en-
suring the proper management of them is of 
the highest concern for all who live here. To 
suggest that anyone in Mesa County would 
wish these lands destroyed is false and offen-
sive. However, with more than 100,000 acres 
of designated Wilderness and more than 
80,000 acres held in perpetual Wilderness 
Study Area limbo, residents of Mesa County 
do not want to see more of their public lands 
made inaccessible. Further, with the possible 
passage of the Colorado Outdoor Recreation 
and Economy Act (‘‘CORE Act’’), Colorado 
will see varying levels of conservation in 
counties that desire such protections. 
We invite you to visit Mesa County and 
speak with those directly affected by the 
proposed legislation. Our door is always 
open, and we welcome the opportunity to 
discuss further this critical matter that can 
drastically change our residents’ lives. 
Sincerely, 
JANET ROWLAND, 
Chair, Board of Coun-
ty Commissioners.

Commissioner.

FEBRUARY 25, 2021. 
The Honorable, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: On behalf of the 
nearly six million Farm Bureau member 
families across the United States, we write 
in strong opposition to H.R. 803, the Pro-
tecting America’s Wilderness and Public 
Lands Act. Collectively this package of bills 
impacts lands in California, Colorado, Ari-
zona and Washington by creating nearly 1.5 
million acres of new wilderness, the most re-
strictive federal land use classification. Ad-
ditionally, it would designate 1,200 miles of 
wild and scenic rivers and create 110,000 
acres of National Monument expansion. Fur-
ther, many of the wilderness and wild and 
scenic river designations contained in this 
bill are not suitable for these restrictive des-
ignations. To declare areas that do not pos-
sess these characteristics undermines the in-
tegrity of the Wilderness Act and the Wild 
and Scenic Rivers Act as well as the lands 
that possess those features. 
Farmers and ranchers rely on federal for-
ests and rangelands for economic and rec-
reational opportunities. Livestock grazing 
on federal lands forms an integral part of 
ranching 
operations 
across 
the 
United 
States, especially in the West. But farmers 
also use national forests and rangelands 
throughout the United States in a variety of 
other ways. Federal lands throughout the 
country are important components of our 
nation’s watersheds that provide water to a 
large number of Americans. Active land 
management practices such as timber pro-
duction and livestock grazing are critical to 
protect against wildland fires which dev-
astate range resources, damage watersheds, 
threaten wildlife and put rural communities 
at great risk. 
American farmers and ranchers have a gen-
uine interest in healthy and productive fed-
eral forest and rangelands. At the same time, 
we have a genuine interest in seeing lands 
managed in an environmentally sound man-
ner. Farmers and ranchers understand and 
appreciate that active management of our 
federal lands is critical to the long-term via-
bility of the ecosystem, the resource, and the 
communities they support. Designations in-
cluded in H.R. 803 threaten multiple use 
areas by prohibiting the employment of mo-
torized tools and mechanized vehicles in wa-
tershed management, trail maintenance, soil 
treatment, noxious weed control, waste man-
agement and fire protection. 
Our nation’s federal forests are facing seri-
ous threats from fires, insects and disease 
due to a lack of active forest management. 
The poor health of our federal forests also 
threatens wildlife populations and neigh-
boring non-federal lands, as well as the vital-
ity of rural, forested communities across the 
country. A vibrant livestock and forest prod-
ucts industry helps diversify rural economies 
in ways that compliment ranching and agri-
cultural operations. Wilderness and National 
Monument designations eliminate federal 
land management agencies ability to effec-
tively protect against the threat of cata-
strophic wildland fire. 
Farmers, 
landowners, 
and 
grazing 
permitees should be fully involved as af-
fected partners in any process to execute fed-
eral land use designations which restrict 
public use and access. Federal land use des-
ignations that lack local stakeholder input 
from agricultural and resource management 
professionals often generates significant con-
troversy and economic hardship at the local 
level. The detrimental effects of a federal 
land use designation frequently causes resi-
dents, elected state and county officials, and 
local stakeholders significant reductions in 
economic activity and the loss of jobs in 
rural communities. Past designations have 
also affected water rights, public lands graz-
ing and access to State and private lands. 
Farm Bureau supports the multiple-use 
concept of federal lands, recognizing that de-
finable land areas have dominant-use capa-
bility, which should be recognized with the

concept of multiple uses without the total

ditionally, the California, Colorado, Arizona

sage of this legislation.

Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, Demo-
crats have ignored our local commu-
nities and their needs with this land 
grab. 
In their letter of opposition, Mesa 
County points out three of the five wil-
derness areas in Mesa County in this 
bill that have had large fires in recent 
years, and that wilderness designations 
harm active management and wildfire 
activities. 
I hope that when Members visit my 
district on horseback, they are telling 
people that this land will soon burn, 
because if we do not actively manage 
our forest, Mother Nature will con-
tinue to manage it for us. 
Mr. Speaker, the amendments that 
are offered today would protect energy 
production, local grazing rights, water 
rights, access to our public lands, and 
allow wildfire mitigation. Perhaps, and 
most importantly, these amendments 
give the people of my district a voice, 
ensuring local officials have a seat at 
the table when land use is changed in 
their respective counties. 
b 1015 
The victory in my election showed 
the will of the people in Colorado’s 
Third District. They want to keep their 
land open for public use. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Member for 
his thoughtful amendments, and I 
strongly encourage support on these 
amendments today. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to note one thing 
for the record because there is a ref-
erence from my colleague to amend-
ments that she proceeded to make on 
this bill. 
There has been a lot of talk about 
local control and the support of com-
munities back home. We received com-
munications from various town com-
missioners regarding the amendments 
that my colleague proposed, and I will 
just give you a couple of examples of 
their responses. 
To simply classify this as a land grab is 
deeply disrespectful to those who have 
worked long and hard to gather the facts, ne-
gotiate, and compromise. The issues are too 
important to let parties divide us. 
That was a county commissioner 
from San Miguel. 
A commissioner from Routt County: 
The amendments were issued in a way that 
ignores our system of local control. They re-
ject the liberty and freedom of local jurisdic-
tions to express what is right and just within 
those jurisdictions. 
The communities impacted by the 
provisions in this bill support the pro-
tections that we are seeking to enact 
into law. That is why we are here. So 
with respect, I would again say we op-
pose the amendments that have been 
submitted in en bloc No. 2. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the distinguished gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
first en bloc amendment, which stipu-
lates that nothing in this act shall 
limit the ability of the Secretary of 
the Interior or the Secretary of Agri-
culture to manage forest fires, insects, 
and diseases in designated wilderness 
areas under the Wilderness Act. 
Land conservation is an investment 
in our future, but it is equally impor-
tant that we continue to manage our 
wilderness areas responsibly. Over the 
past several years, my district and oth-
ers across our great country have been 
hit hard by historically damaging 
wildfires. 
To protect countless communities, 
the Federal Government must ensure 
wilderness areas are adequately man-
aged to minimize the impacts of 
wildfires. 
I want to thank Chairman GRIJALVA 
and Representatives PANETTA and LOF-
GREN
for being champions of public 
lands and responsible land manage-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join them 
on this amendment, and I strongly 
urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on the first en bloc 
amendment. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD this letter from 
the Grand Junction Area Chamber of 
Commerce. It says that this bill, if 
passed, will negatively impact our al-
ready fragile economy and jeopardize 
our economic recovery. 
GRAND JUNCTION AREA, 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, 
February 24, 2021. 
Congresswoman LAUREN BOEBERT, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CONGRESSWOMAN BOEBERT: On behalf 
of the 900 small businesses employing 37,000 
people that the Grand Junction Area Cham-
ber of Commerce represents, I am writing to 
encourage you to oppose H.R. 803, a bill that 
would lock up public lands in Mesa County 
and negatively impact our local economy. 
Our community’s economy is still reliant in 
part on the business activity generated by 
our legacy industries of agriculture and en-
ergy. This bill if passed will negatively im-
pact our already fragile economy and jeop-
ardize our economic recovery. 
These are lands that are literally in our 
backyard in Mesa County yet Congress-
woman DeGette continues to ignore us, does 
not meet with us, and does not even consider 
the consequences of her bill on the hard-
working families of our areas. 
In addition to opposing H.R. 803 our organi-
zation supports the various amendments you 
are proposing be added to the bill that in-
clude keeping the BLM Headquarters in 
Grand Junction Colorado, requiring that af-
fected counties must approve the Wilderness 
Designation and protects grazing and water 
rights. 
We appreciate your efforts to help retain 
jobs and the diversity of our local economy 
by opposing H.R. 803 and offering amend-
ments to help preserve the livelihood of our 
families and our water life. 
Sincerely, 
DIANE SCHWENKE, 
President/CEO. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues that if you want to improve 
our environment, if you are worried 
about job losses in your district, if you 
think we should secure our supply 
chains and improve American energy 
independence, if you think our forests 
need to be properly managed to avoid 
catastrophic wildfires, and if you enjoy 
recreating in our public lands, you 
should vote for this amendment pack-
age. 
The underlying bill is a feel-good bill 
that hurts our economy and environ-
ment. We won’t have to suffer the con-
sequences of that. It will be our chil-
dren and our grandchildren who have 
to live with the fact that we don’t have 
forests because we burned them all 
down and we don’t have jobs because 
we outsourced our domestic mining in-
dustry to Russia and China. 
It shouldn’t be a surprise to anybody 
that the Democrats didn’t want to put 
a package this disastrous for our econ-
omy and environment through regular 
order. They may be able to limit our 
ability to debate this package, but 
there is no hiding the truth: This legis-
lation is a land grab that devastates 
the very communities and lands it 
claims to support and protect. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support the en bloc amendments and 
oppose the underlying bill. I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, again, I have great re-
spect for my colleague, the ranking 
member, but what he purports this bill 
will do is just simply not the case. I 
would think that trying to prevent ura-
nium mining in the Grand Canyon 
would not be controversial. I would 
hope that my colleagues could come to 
a consensus on that. 
As lawmakers, we all know that 
strong policy requires compromise. It 
requires years of input and vigorous de-
bate. I am happy to participate in this 
debate, and I appreciate the gentle-
man’s participation. 
When we think of some of the most 
iconic, protected places in the United 
States—Yellowstone, 
Yosemite, 
the 
Grand Canyon—it is difficult to imag-
ine a time when they were not pro-
tected, but even those most treasured 
places in America underwent criticism 
from Members of Congress. The argu-
ments, actually, that we heard today 
are nearly identical to those that we 
were hearing on the floor 100 years ago. 
In 1882, Benjamin Harrison, who was 
then a Senator from Indiana, intro-
duced a bill to designate land lying on 
the Colorado River in the territory of 
Arizona as a public park. The bill was 
forwarded to Interior Secretary Henry 
Teller, who was a Coloradan, and he op-
posed conservation of the site. He told

the Senate that the bill was unneces-
sary and that the area ‘‘does not re-
quire the creation of a public park to 
preserve it.’’ 
Congress was unwilling to proceed in 
the face of opposition from the execu-
tive branch due to the interests of min-
ing, westward territorial mining, and 
land use. Harrison pushed on. He re-
introduced the bill in 1883, again in 
1886. 
And in 1903, the great conservationist 
Teddy Roosevelt visited the area he 
had advocated to protect. He declared 
that it is ‘‘beyond comparison, beyond 
description,’’ and ‘‘unparalleled.’’ ‘‘Let 
this great wonder of nature remain as 
it is now. Do nothing to mar its gran-
deur. . . . You cannot improve upon it. 
But what you can do is keep it for your 
children, your children’s children, and 
all who come after you.’’ 
On February 26—on this very day—in 
1919, President Wilson signed into law 
the Grand Canyon National Park Act, 
101 years ago today. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s make that choice 
again. We passed this bill with bipar-
tisan support. I ask my colleagues to 
do it again, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, my amendment 
would require us to know what we are doing 
before we take the overwhelming radical step 
of withdrawing more than a million acres of 
federal lands from mineral development. 
It may come as a shock but even today we 
know little about the geologic mineral makeup 
of our lands. Minerals that were very important 
in the past like gold and silver are not always 
the key to our future technologies. 
Today, we are finding a whole new suite of 
minerals that are critically important to our fu-
ture, while rare earths and lithium are the 
stars, important minerals like cobalt, man-
ganese and copper are quickly becoming 
equally both important and challenging to find 
and produce. 
However, this bill in front of us has no rec-
ognition of the importance of the breadth of 
minerals that may be included in the areas 
covered by this legislation. Which is why my 
amendment is so important today. 
This amendment will require the Secretary 
of the Interior to conduct a full mineral re-
source survey of the withdrawal areas prior to 
enacting this withdrawal. This is important be-
cause of the national security impacts of this 
proposed withdrawal that seeks to perma-
nently ban oil, natural gas, geothermal, ura-
nium and other critical minerals and rare 
earths on over a million acres of land in Ari-
zona, 
I will continue to make the case that the im-
portance of the uranium alone is key for keep-
ing these lands open, however I believe that 
without this amendment this bill will have a 
negative impact on our national security as it 
aims to permanently prohibit mining of rare 
earths and critical minerals on a massive, 
massive swath of land. 
Earlier I mentioned the importance of lithium 
and there is no question that lithium is criti-
cally important to our technology and energy 
future. However, we don’t often know where 
all the lithium resources are in the United 
States. For example, in September of last 
year, the USGS funded an earth MRI program 
in Arizona to study the lithium resources of the 
Big Sandy Valley in Arizona. I include in the 
RECORD the press release from USGS. 
This study will help us to define and under-
stand the lithium resources in this region. Yet 
it is important for us to reflect on the fact that 
we didn’t know about these resources until re-
cently, had we closed off this area, like this bill 
proposes to do to more than one million acres 
of Arizona, we may have never known. Yet 
because we have the ability to examine this 
area, which is not subject to a withdrawal, we 
are going to study and hopefully find rich re-
sources we can produce to secure our na-
tion’s future. 
Before I close Mr. Speaker, let me stress, 
the underlying bill represents one of the larg-
est legislative land grabs ever considered by 
Congress. This effort to permanently lock 
away the highest grade and largest deposit of 
uranium in the country will further increase our 
reliance on foreign adversaries like Russia, 
China, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. 
Instead of rushing headlong into the en-
deavor of permanently making this million acre 
area off limits, we should know what the true 
impacts of this legislation will be on the long- 
term national security of our country. 
This amendment would not kill this legisla-
tion, instead it would ensure that the proposed 
withdrawal can only go ahead once we clearly 
access the region, clearly understand the pic-
ture of what we are withdrawing and what 
other resources may be impacted by this ac-
tion. 
I say to my colleagues, lets slow down this 
process so we know what we are doing, what 
we are impacting and the real impacts of mak-
ing such a large and bountiful parcel of land 
off limits could have on our mineral security. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for this amend-
ment. 
EARTH MRI FUNDS CRITICAL MINERALS 
PROJECTS IN ARIZONA 
[Sept. 28, 2020] 
A TOTAL OF $133,016 WILL FUND NEW RESEARCH 
AND PRESERVE IMPORTANT DATA ACROSS THE 
GRAND CANYON STATE 
FLAGSTAFF, ARIZ.—The U.S. Geological 
Survey and the Association of American 
State Geologists are pleased to announce 
$133,016 in funding for critical minerals 
projects in Arizona. These funds are for the 
fiscal year 2020 under the USGS Mineral Re-
sources Program’s Earth Mapping Resources 
Initiative, or Earth MRI. 
The funds include grants to the Arizona 
Geological Survey for geologic mapping and 
geochemical analyses for an area of the Big 
Sandy Valley with a focus on lithium and to 
preserve and publicly available information 
on critical mineral resources. 
‘‘These new projects in Arizona represent 
the next step in our ambitious effort to im-
prove our knowledge of the geologic frame-
work in the United States and to identify 
areas that may have the potential to contain 
undiscovered critical mineral resources,’’ 
said Jim Reilly, director of the USGS. ‘‘The 
identification and prioritization of prospec-
tive areas were done through our strong 
partnership with the state geological surveys 
in a series of workshops in Fall 2019.’’ 
‘‘This program will revitalize and update 
the science and geologic research and data 
compilation that is needed in many states 
for the United States to identify new geo-
logic associations,’’ said John Yellich, direc-
tor of the Michigan Geological Survey and 
president of AASG. 
‘‘The Earth MRI effort is an outgrowth of 
the strong partnership between the AASG 
members and the USGS,’’ said Warren Day, 
Earth MRI lead scientist for the USGS. ‘‘The 
USGS is grateful for the scientific input and 
support from the state geological surveys, 
resulting in a robust body of information 
useful for many applications beyond mineral 
resources.’’ 
The geologic mapping efforts, which are 
managed through the National Cooperative 
Geologic Mapping Program, will refine our 
scientific understanding of the geologic 
framework of areas of interest. In addition 
to helping identify mineral potential, these 
maps also support decisions about use of 
land, water, energy and minerals and help to 
mitigate the impact of geologic hazards on 
communities. 
In 2017, President Trump issued Executive 
Order 13817, a Federal Strategy to Ensure Se-
cure and Reliable Supplies of Critical Min-
erals. This executive order called on agencies 
across the federal government to develop a 
strategy to reduce the nation’s susceptibility 
to critical mineral supply disruptions. 
In May of 2018, DOI released a list of 35 
minerals deemed critical to the U.S. econ-
omy and security, based on a methodology 
by the USGS. This list forms the foundation 
of the full federal strategy. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, my amendment 
is very simple, it only asks Congress to do 
one thing, respect the will of the local people 
in the management of our lands. 
This amendment would remove from the bill 
the lands included in my Congressional district 
from the massive mineral withdrawal included 
in the bill. My local constituents and counties 
support this amendment and I encourage my 
colleagues to respect our wishes. Under gen-
eral leave, I include in the RECORD a letter 
from Mohave County opposing this legislation. 
Mohave County Arizona, which is the pri-
mary area which this amendment would help 
protect, is currently facing nearly 10 percent 
unemployment and has a per capita income of 
less than thirty-five thousand dollars a year. 
These economic conditions should be proof 
enough that we need to be promoting eco-
nomic development in these regions, not sim-
ply closing off an important path to economic 
security for the people of Mohave County. 
My colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
will argue that these lands belong to all the 
American people, which is true, but we must 
respect the local concerns. 
When I highlight that offshore oil drilling in 
California would reduce our dependence on 
foreign oil, stop us from subsidizing Russia 
and Saudi Arabia, my colleagues from Cali-
fornia scream out ‘‘respect our wishes, we 
don’t want drilling’’. 
So I call on them here today, join me in 
supporting my constituents who are crying out 
for the chance, just the chance to keep the 
potential of high paying jobs open and support 
this amendment. 
It may come as a shock but even today we 
know little about the geologic mineral makeup 
of our lands. Minerals that were very important 
in the past like gold and silver are not always 
the key to our future technologies. 
Today, we are finding a whole new suite of 
minerals that are critically important to our fu-
ture, while rare earths and lithium are the 
stars, important minerals like cobalt, man-
ganese and copper are quickly becoming 
equally both important and challenging to find 
and produce. 
This area in Mohave County has tremen-
dous potential and keeping that potential open 
and available to the people of the county is 
critical to ensuring a rich economic future.

February 26, 2021 
This amendment only removes the area 
within my district, it will allow other members 
to do with their regions as they will. 
This amendment would not kill this legisla-
tion, instead it would ensure that the people I 
represent in Arizona have their wishes re-

consistent with the will of the local commu-

MOHAVE COUNTY 
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS, 
February 24, 2021. 
Hon. PAUL GOSAR, 
U.S. Congress, 
Washington, DC. 
CONGRESSMAN GOSAR: The Mohave County 
Board of Supervisors is writing to offer our 
support for your amendment to H.R. 803— 
Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021. As you 
know, the passage of this legislation will 
have a grave effect on Mohave County, Ari-
zona, and our neighboring counties in Utah. 
Uranium mining in the past has been the 
forefront of our economic growth in Mohave 
County and if allowed to continue will bring 
in nearly $29 billion to our local economy 
over a 42 year period. The passage of H.R. 803 
would make permanent a July 2012 morato-
rium on uranium mining in our area. The 
language of your amendment would help al-
leviate the permanent economic loss we 
would sustain under the passage of H.R. 803. 
We strongly support the passing of this 
amendment as presented in the Rules Com-
mittee and the House or Representatives. 
Without this amendment, the financial sta-
bility of our economy in Mohave County 
would drastically suffer. 
In 2012, the Secretary of the Interior im-
posed a 20 year ban on over 1 million acres of 
land in the Arizona Strip Area for the pur-
pose of Uranium mining. This ban included 
both public lands and National Forest Sys-
tem lands. This ban took away much needed 
growth and jobs from our area. Secretary 
Salazar at the time issued this withdrawal 
without complying with the law requiring 
coordination with local governments. The 
Federal Land Policy Management Act, USC 
Section 171 requires that the Secretary and 
his designees ‘‘coordinate’’ with local gov-
ernment as to development and implementa-
tion of any plan or management action. Co-
ordination is defined in the Act as requiring 
prior notice of proposed plans and actions to 
the 
local 
government 
officials 
(‘‘prior’’ 
meaning prior to public announcements, and 
early enough to provide ‘‘meaningful’’ par-
ticipation by the local officials in the ‘‘de-
velopment’’ of the plan or action.). The con-
gressional mandate of coordination also re-
quires the Secretary to use all practicable 
means to reach consistency between the fed-
eral plan/management action and local pol-
icy, plan or law. All of which Secretary Sala-
zar did not do. 
Making this ban permanent based on mis-
information will have lasting effects on Mo-
have County. We respect and take a responsi-
bility for protecting the Grand Canyon, but 
saying that the Grand Canyon will suffer be-
cause of mining is inaccurate. Secretary 
Salazar’s reasoning behind the withdrawal 
was out of concern that it could damage the 
region’s drinking water and the park’s water 
quality. Bureau of Land Management offi-
cials contradicted those claims by explaining 
that their Arizona Strip field office had no 
evidence of contamination of water, and had 
no evidence of problems with the safe oper-
ation of the uranium mines in operation on 
the lands. 
Uranium mining is important and useful 
for many reasons. The lands in the ‘‘Strip’’ 
contain the nation’s high grade uranium de-
posits and enough uranium to provide power 
generation for the state of California for 
over 20 years. Uranium is useful in many 
ways. It is used by our military for national 
security and defense. Uranium metal is very 
dense and heavy. When it is depleted (DU), 
uranium is used by the military as shielding 
to protect Army tanks, and also in parts of 
bullets and missiles. The military also uses 
enriched uranium to power nuclear propelled 
Navy ships and submarines, and in nuclear 
weapons. A permanent withdrawal of ura-
nium mining from the ‘‘Strip’’ harms the 
American people by removing between 326– 
375 million lbs (the equivalent electricity 
generating capacity for the entire state of 
California’s 40 million people for 22.4 years) 
of uranium. 
From a national security standpoint, do-
mestic utilities now import 90 percent of the 
uranium used to operate America’s 104 nu-
clear reactors. Thirty years ago, these reac-
tors used U.S. mined uranium for 100 percent 
of electricity production, The nation cannot 
be pro-nuclear and anti-nuclear fuel. In sum, 
these deposits represent the last available 
use of our public lands for economic growth 
in our region. 
The opponents of uranium mining have 
chosen to ignore the fact that mining with 
environmentally sound reclamation was con-
ducted from the early 1980s until the price of 
uranium collapsed in 1993. No mining at all 
occurred from 1993 until 2010, and the 
Denison mine which is now operating, is fol-
lowing and often exceeding all environ-
mental and safety laws. 
Arizona needs to go back to the roots that 
led to Arizona being developed, and that is 
mining. The strict federal and state environ-
mental laws already on the books will pro-
tect the public from environmental damage 
to the Grand Canyon watershed. The mining 
of uranium however does not affect ground 
water nor destroy the natural resources of 
the land. It does not require open pit mining. 
Upon completion of mining one Breccia Pipe 
(4 years) the land is placed back into its na-
tive state. 
We want to thank you for putting forward 
this amendment. Nuclear energy can be the 
future of clean energy. We have the re-
sources in this Country to ensure that hap-
pens and we have the technology and means 
to ensure mining that energy is both envi-
ronmentally safe and protects our natural 
resources. We stand in support of the amend-
ment.

REPORT 
ON 
RESOLUTION 
PRO-
VIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF 
H.R. 
1319, 
AMERICAN 
RESCUE 
PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN, from the Com-
mittee on Rules, submitted a privi-
leged report (Rept. No. 117–8) on the 
resolution (H. Res. 166) providing for 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 1319) to 
provide for reconciliation pursuant to 
title II of S. Con. Res. 5, which was re-
ferred to the House Calendar and or-
dered to be printed.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H.R. 1319, AMERICAN RESCUE 
PLAN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 166 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 166 
Resolved, That immediately upon adoption 
of this resolution, the House shall proceed to 
the consideration in the House of the bill 
(H.R. 1319) to provide for reconciliation pur-
suant to title II of S. Con. Res. 5. All points 
of order against consideration of the bill are 
waived. The amendment printed in the re-
port of the Committee on Rules accom-
panying this resolution shall be considered 
as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill, as amended, 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill, as amend-
ed, and on any further amendment thereto, 
to final passage without intervening motion 
except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided 
among and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee on 
the Budget or their respective designees and 
the chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Ways and Means or their 
respective designees; and (2) one motion to 
recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
today the Rules Committee met for 
over 10 hours and reported a rule, 
House Resolution 166, providing for 
consideration of H.R. 1319, the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan Act of 2021, under a 
closed rule. 
The rule provides 1 hour of debate 
equally divided among and controlled 
by the chairs and ranking minority 
members, or their designees, of the 
Committee on the Budget and the Com-
mittee on Ways and Means. 
The rule self-executes a manager’s 
amendment by Chairman YARMUTH and 
provides one motion to recommit. 
Madam Speaker, since the emergence 
of the coronavirus, our Nation has been 
in a perpetual state of mourning. The 
number of Americans killed by this 
pandemic is nearly equal to one death 
a minute every minute for a year. 
Every corner of society has been im-
pacted: More than 18 million Ameri-
cans are receiving unemployment bene-
fits; nearly 24 million Americans are 
going hungry with roughly 12 million 
children living in households with food 
insecurity; up to 40 million Americans 
cannot afford to pay rent; 8 of 10 mi-
nority-owned businesses are on the 
brink of closure; and I could go on and 
on and on, Madam Speaker. This is a 
time to act and to act boldly. 
That is why we began work on the 
American Rescue Plan nearly 1 month 
ago. 
Nine 
committees 
have 
now 
marked up portions of the bill, spend-
ing more than 100 hours debating more 
than 400 amendments. We have acted 
swiftly, Madam Speaker, but we have 
also acted deliberately, guided by the 
reality that the American people need 
us to act urgently. 
More vaccines need to get to more 
people, so this plan will set up commu-
nity vaccination sites nationwide. Our 
schools need to safely reopen, so this 
bill will deliver new resources to help 
them do so. Working families need 
more immediate relief, so the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan also provides an addi-
tional $1,400 per person and direct as-
sistance. That will bring the total 
amount of direct assistance recently 
provided to $2,000 per person. 
This bill also extends unemployment 
benefits and boosts the Federal min-
imum wage so that 27 million workers 
get a raise. Sadly, the Senate rules will 
cause this provision to be removed 
when it is considered there. 
But I want the American people to 
know this, we, on the Democratic side, 
we will not stop fighting to make a 
minimum wage increase a reality. No 
one, and I mean no one, who works full 
time in the richest nation on this plan-
et should have to live in poverty. 
There is also nutrition assistance in-
cluded to combat the growing hunger 
crisis. And support for local commu-
nities on the frontlines of this health 
emergency. There is aid here for small 
businesses, expanded PPP eligibility, 
and resources for our first responders, 
for our teachers, for our transit work-
ers, and so much more. 
This is what it looks like when Con-
gress acts in a way that matches the 
scale of the problem that we face. 
Nearly 7 in 10 Americans support this 
plan. More than 150 leaders of our Na-
tion’s top businesses came out this 
week in support of this plan. 
Republican 
officeholders 
like 
the 
Governor of West Virginia have encour-
aged Congress to go big here. And local 
Republican leaders, like the mayor of 
Miami, and so many other Republican 
mayors across this country from red 
States, support our President’s pro-
posal. This is a bipartisan response to 
the coronavirus crisis. 
We all joined together on the Capitol 
steps on Tuesday to mark the 500,000 
lives lost to the coronavirus in this 
country. We didn’t stand as Democrats 
or Republicans, but as one Congress. 
We mourn the empty seats at dinner 
tables, and the missed graduations, and 
weddings the same way, not from our 
partisan corners, but as one American 
family. 
Through our grief, we should respond 
here the same way. United in our pur-
pose to defeat this pandemic and re-
build our Nation. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to stand together and with the 
American people in support of this 
plan. Let’s act big. Let’s act bold. Let’s 
crush this virus. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Massachu-
setts for yielding me the customary 30 
minutes, and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, just before I begin, I 
also want to acknowledge that I had 
sent the chairman of the Rules Com-
mittee a letter earlier in the week, to 
which he today kindly responded, and I 
appreciate the prompt response to my 
concerns about Capitol security. 
Madam Speaker, today’s rule pro-
vides for consideration of H.R. 1319, the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
Throughout this process, Republicans 
have been completely excluded. I sit on 
the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce, I sit on the Budget Committee, 
and I sit on the Rules Committee, and 
throughout the markups in each of 
these committees Republicans offered 
sincere amendments to improve the 
bill for the American people. 
While only 2 of the 245 Republican 
amendments offered were adopted, the 
rule before us today strips out the one 
amendment adopted by a rollcall vote. 
Earlier today in the Rules Com-
mittee, over 200 amendments were of-
fered and debated, not a single one was 
made in order. The American people at 
least deserve to have the suggestions of 
Members that they elected to be de-
bated on the House floor. They don’t 
have to be adopted, but they should at 
least be heard on the House floor. It 
seems that the Democrats are unwill-
ing to allow elected Members of Con-
gress to do their job and represent 
their constituents.

February 26, 2021 
previous—coronavirus response bills, it 
does seem that we do have some time 
to do our work, but, instead, we didn’t 
even hold markups on this portion of 
the bill. 
While the Energy and Commerce 
Committee did hold a markup, all Re-
publican amendments were defeated. 
This 
portion 
of 
the 
bill 
includes 
changes that will take months to im-
plement, if indeed they happen at all. 
Perhaps the most startling figure is 
less than 10 percent of these dollars are 
actually 
spent 
on 
combating 
the 
coronavirus. 
Despite spending over $14 billion on 
vaccines and therapeutics, after $28 bil-
lion was just recently provided in the 
fiscal year 2021 omnibus, this package 
does not contain any funding—zero 
funding—for the National Institutes of 
Health. The National Institutes of 
Health has been a critical partner in 
Operation Warp Speed and getting the 
vaccine through the approval process 
in literally warp speed time and help-
ing the vaccine manufacturers in de-
veloping the coronavirus vaccine that 
we are now so urgently needing. 
This legislation includes many provi-
sions that really should be addressed 
outside of a coronavirus relief package, 
like providing a State option for 
postpartum 
Medicaid 
coverage 
for 
women. While this is a policy I have 
long advocated for, it should not be 
temporary, as this legislation directs it 
to sunset after 7 years. Let’s bring that 
bill separately to the floor and get this 
policy right, just as we did in the last 
Congress. 
Furthermore, although there are bil-
lions of dollars directed to public 
health, the Provider Relief Fund is cu-
riously not replenished. 
Again, why are we not supporting 
programs which we know work and we 
know provide direct, targeted relief? 
The Provider Relief Fund is a pro-
gram that works, and that is why I of-
fered an amendment to add $35 billion 
to the Provider Relief Fund. 
Adding to the partisan nature of this 
legislation is the lack of any Hyde pro-
tections ensuring that none of this 
funding is used to subsidize abortion. 
The 
Hyde 
amendment 
is 
a 
long-
standing, bipartisan agreement. In-
stead, there is $50 million included for 
Title X Family Planning, which likely 
is going to go to Planned Parenthood 
and has nothing to do with coronavirus 
relief. 
This is a $1.9 trillion partisan wish 
list that could ultimately increase the 
Federal deficit to between $2 trillion to 
$3 trillion without addressing the im-
mediate needs of Americans simply 
trying to survive this pandemic. 
So I would suggest that now is not 
the time to push through partisan pri-
orities. Barely a month ago, Congress 
passed, and President Trump signed 
into law, a $900 billion coronavirus re-
lief package. Combined with previous 
relief packages, which were bipartisan 
and which were worked on by both 
Democrats and Republicans in the last 
calendar year, there remains $1 trillion 
in unspent funding. 
Why is it so urgent to pass another $2 
trillion now? 
It is reminiscent of our former col-
league, Rahm Emanuel, who said: 
Never let a crisis go to waste. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. PERLMUTTER), who is a 
distinguished member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to support the rule and the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has cost the 
lives of over 500,000 Americans—more 
than all the casualties of World War I, 
World War II, and the Vietnam war 
combined. Millions more have been in-
fected and are recovering from the 
virus. Our economy has lost more than 
10 million jobs. Countless businesses 
have failed or are at risk of failing. So 
our job today in Congress is to move 
quickly to address the physical, emo-
tional, and financial health of all 
Americans. We can accomplish all 
three of these priorities through pas-
sage of the American Rescue Plan. 
I want to touch on a few of the provi-
sions included in this package. First, 
our State and local governments, fire-
fighters, police, transportation work-
ers, and healthcare providers have been 
on the front lines of the pandemic, sup-
porting their communities by devel-
oping testing capabilities, supporting 
vulnerable populations, and now de-
ploying the vaccines as quickly as pos-
sible. 
I am glad this bill includes $350 bil-
lion for State and local governments 
all across the country. 
We also need to work quickly to ex-
tend expiring unemployment programs, 
which expire on March 14. We saw what 
happened when Senator MCCONNELL 
paused last year, and Coloradans are 
still struggling to receive the benefits 
they are owed. 
This legislation will invest $130 bil-
lion to support K–12 schools as they 
work to return to in-person learning 
and help students catch up. It will also 
include $40 billion in rental and hous-
ing assistance. In the last month, Colo-
rado has seen a record amount of re-
quests for rental assistance. 
The time for action is now. President 
Biden is laser focused on delivering re-
lief to all Americans, and I am proud of 
his leadership so we can provide this 
needed assistance as we vaccinate more 
people each day. America needs this, 
America wants this, and they are going 
to get it. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), 
who is a valuable member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, the payoff to progressives 
package before us today has little to do 
with the ongoing pandemic. This bill, 
which is the most expensive single bill 
in history, only allocates 9 percent of 
the $1.9 trillion price tag to actually 
defeating COVID. 
So what are the Democrats spending 
the rest of the money on? 
Corrupt pet projects, of course, and 
also payoffs to Progressive liberal spe-
cial interest groups. 
Just look at it: $100 million for a Sil-
icon Valley rail project near Speaker 
PELOSI’s district. Totally coinciden-
tally, I am sure. Taxpayer funded 
healthcare subsidies for illegal immi-
grants. 
Fifty 
million 
dollars 
for 
Planned Parenthood. Hundreds of bil-
lions in bailouts to blue State Gov-
ernors, who crush small businesses 
with their draconian lockdown meas-
ures. And a minimum wage mandate 
that, right off the bat, would kill 1.4 
million American jobs. The list goes on 
and on. 
But do you know what Democrats 
aren’t putting in this bill? 
They aren’t reopening our schools. In 
fact, this bill spends 95 percent of the 
education funding after the school 
year. 
Democrats also aren’t reopening our 
economy with this bill. In fact, this bill 
spends $471 billion on policies that ac-
tually reduce employment. 
And they aren’t targeting relief to 
where it is actually needed. In fact, 
this bill gives checks to individuals 
who have not lost any income and 
gives taxpayer-funded healthcare to 
millionaires. 
President Biden and congressional 
Democrats had a chance to make good 
on their empty promises to show unity 
and bipartisanship. They could have 
worked with Republicans on a targeted 
relief bill that sends money to where it 
actually needs to go and effectively 
spends $1 trillion in the remaining 
funds that have already been allocated. 
Instead, they are using this pandemic 
as pretext to force through a corrupt 
bill filled with Progressive payoffs. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on H.R. 1319. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD an article from 
The Washington Post, titled ‘‘Biden is 
winning Republican support for his $1.9 
trillion coronavirus relief plan. Just 
not in Washington.’’ 
[From the Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2021] 
BIDEN IS WINNING REPUBLICAN SUPPORT FOR 
HIS
$1.9 TRILLION
CORONAVIRUS
RELIEF 
PLAN—JUST NOT IN WASHINGTON 
(By Griff Witte) 
The pandemic has not been kind to Fresno, 
the poorest major city in California. The un-
employment rate spiked above 10 percent 
and has stubbornly remained there. Violent 
crime has surged, as has homelessness. Tax 
revenue has plummeted as businesses have 
shuttered. Lines at food banks are filled with 
first-timers. 
But as bad as it’s been, things could soon 
get worse: Having frozen hundreds of jobs 
last year, the city is now being forced to con-
sider laying off 250 people, including police 
and firefighters, to close a $31 million budget 
shortfall.

February 26, 2021 
‘‘That,’’ said Jerry Dyer, mayor of the 
half-million-strong city in the Central Val-
ley, ‘‘is going to be devastating.’’ 
The looming cuts explain why Dyer’s eyes 
are fixed on Washington, where President 
Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan 
dangles the tantalizing prospect of a re-
prieve. Though Dyer is a Republican, he’s 
rooting for the president to successfully push 
through federal aid that, after a nightmarish 
year for Fresno, will ‘‘help get us to the 
end.’’ 
The first-term mayor’s stance reflects a 
broader split, one that gives Biden and his 
fellow Democrats a key tactical advantage 
as negotiations near an expected climax 
early next month. 
Republicans in Congress overwhelmingly 
oppose the relief bill, casting it as bloated 
and budget-busting, with some heaping par-
ticular scorn on a measure to send $350 bil-
lion in assistance to states and cities. Should 
Biden go ahead without their approval, GOP 
leaders say, it will prove that his mantra of 
bipartisanship rings hollow. 
But to many Republicans at city halls and 
statehouses across the country, the relief 
package looks very different. Instead of the 
‘‘blue-state bailout’’ derided by GOP law-
makers, Republican mayors and governors 
say they see badly needed federal aid to keep 
police on the beat, to prevent battered Main 
Street businesses from going under and to 
help care for the growing ranks of the home-
less and the hungry. 
‘‘It’s not a Republican issue or a Democrat 
issue,’’ said Dyer, who became mayor last 
month following a long career as the city’s 
police chief. ‘‘It’s a public health issue. It’s 
an economic issue. And it’s a public safety 
issue.’’ 
Surveys show that a broad majority of 
Americans support the assistance, including 
large numbers of Republicans. Only a minor-
ity among Republican voters agree with GOP 
lawmakers that the aid package is too large, 
polls have found. 
Biden on Friday highlighted the rift, invit-
ing a bipartisan group of mayors and gov-
ernors to the White House to discuss the spe-
cifics of the bill. 
You folks are all on the front lines and 
dealing with the crisis since day one,’’ he 
told the group, which included the Repub-
lican governors of Maryland and Arkansas, 
as well as Republican mayors. 
Miami Mayor Francis Suarez (R) later told 
reporters from the podium in the White 
House briefing room that he had spoken with 
Biden and Vice President Harris more in the 
first several weeks of their administration 
‘‘than I had spoken to the prior administra-
tion in the entirety.’’ 
Biden said he brought the group to the 
White House to ask ‘‘what do they think 
they need most.’’ 
To many mayors and governors, it’s a long 
list. 
‘‘I don’t know of any city that hasn’t been 
affected negatively,’’ Oklahoma City Mayor 
David Holt (R) said. ‘‘Some may be worse off 
than others. But we have all had to make 
cuts.’’ 
The impact has not been as severe as some 
economists 
initially 
projected, 
however. 
When the pandemic first struck American 
shores and much of the U.S. economy shut 
down last spring, the prognosis for states and 
cities looked dire. Analysts warned that cit-
ies—some of which had still not fully recov-
ered from the Great Recession more than a 
decade ago—could be forced into bankruptcy. 
But some of the worst consequences have 
already been blunted by previous rounds of 
federal aid, as well as by the nature of the 
economic recovery, with high-income indi-
viduals—who contribute much of the state 
and local tax base—bouncing back relatively 
quickly, even as poorer families languish. 
When 10 Republican senators visited the 
White House this month to lay out their 
slimmed-down $618 billion counterproposal 
to the president’s plan, Mitt Romney (Utah) 
came brandishing details from a J.P. Morgan 
analysis showing that most states had seen 
only modest revenue declines. 
Romney later told reporters that Biden’s 
insistence on $350 billion in state and local 
aid was the biggest stumbling block in nego-
tiations. 
‘‘That kind of number just makes no sense 
at all,’’ he said. The Republican plan pro-
posed to cut it entirely. 
Yet as the J.P. Morgan analysis shows, the 
impact of the pandemic has been unevenly 
felt, with some states—especially those 
whose economies are heavily dependent on 
tourism or oil and gas extraction—suffering 
dramatic declines. 
A Brookings Institution analysis in Sep-
tember found that although income tax rev-
enue had proved resilient during the pan-
demic, sales tax and transportation-related 
revenue had been hit especially hard. As a 
result, states and cities were projected to 
lose out on more than $450 billion over three 
years. 
And the pain hasn’t only been on the rev-
enue side. New needs arising from the pan-
demic have created new costs. 
‘‘Cities were confronting some really big 
challenges even before this crisis—income 
inequality, homelessness, housing afford-
ability,’’ said Tracy Gordon, acting director 
of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. 
All 
have 
been 
exacerbated 
by 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, she said. But many 
cities now have fewer resources with which 
to address them. 
In Oklahoma City, Holt said, revenue has 
been down by about 5 percent, a sharp depar-
ture from the robust growth the city had be-
come accustomed to before the pandemic. To 
compensate, he said, the city has had to 
leave jobs unfilled and cut funding for parks 
and recreation, even as the overall needs of 
citizens and businesses have grown. 
‘‘We don’t do much fluff here,’’ he said. ‘‘So 
whatever we’ve had to cut, residents have ex-
perienced it.’’ 
Republican lawmakers in Washington have 
dismissed aid to cities as a bailout for gov-
ernments that have long spent beyond their 
means. 
But Holt called that ‘‘a red herring.’’ Most 
state and city governments—unlike the fed-
eral government—have to balance their 
budgets, just as a business would. 
But unlike businesses large and small that 
have received grants or loans to make up for 
the damage done by the coronavirus, cities 
have been left out. 
‘‘In a sense, we’re the only employer that 
hasn’t been able to make an application to 
anyone to save our jobs and save our serv-
ices,’’ said Holt, who noted that the city gov-
ernment is one of his metro area’s biggest 
employers. ‘‘Support for cities and states is 
way overdue.’’ 
There has been some relief. The Cares Act, 
signed into law by President Donald Trump 
last March, included $150 billion for states 
and for the nation’s 38 largest cities. But 
money 
had 
to 
be 
spent 
directly 
on 
coronavirus 
expenses, 
creating 
logistical 
hurdles in getting it out the door. Nearly a 
year later, some of it remains unspent, a 
point Republicans make in arguing for why 
additional taxpayer dollars should not be al-
located. 
The aid proposed by Biden would not have 
the same restrictions. Mayors say that will 
make it easier to quickly get it into the 
hands of those who need it and to stimulate 
economic growth. 
Betsy Price proudly calls Fort Worth, the 
metropolis of nearly 900,000 she has led for 
the past decade, ‘‘a fiscally conservative 
city.’’ But the Republican said the pandemic 
has forced the city government to spend 
more just to keep people afloat, doling out 
small-business support, rental assistance and 
help with utility bills. 
Price joined more than 400 fellow mayors 
late last month—including many Repub-
licans—in signing a U.S. Conference of May-
ors letter that called on Congress to quickly 
pass Biden’s coronavirus relief plan. She said 
she had spoken with both of Texas’s sen-
ators—Republicans Ted Cruz and John Cor-
nyn—and made the same case. 
‘‘We’re not asking the Democrats or the 
Republicans to put money into city coffers,’’ 
she said. ‘‘We’re asking them to put it into 
the community to help people get back on 
their feet.’’ 
The National Governors Association has 
not released a letter similar to the one en-
dorsed by the mayors. But the group did call 
for $500 billion in relief for states last spring. 
And individual Republican governors have 
spoken up to back Biden’s relief plan, which 
can be enacted without GOP support. That 
includes moderates such as Maryland’s Larry 
Hogan, as well as Trump-aligned conserv-
atives such as West Virginia’s Jim Justice, 
who has urged Congress to ‘‘go big.’’ 
Suarez, the Miami mayor, has pushed the 
same message and has put pressure on Flor-
ida’s two Republican senators, Marco Rubio 
and Rick Scott, to follow through. 
The Republican recently co-wrote an op-ed 
with St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman, a 
Democrat, in which they addressed the sen-
ators directly and enumerated the problems 
facing their cities, including unemployment, 
bankrupt business and lines at food pantries 
that look like ‘‘gridlocked freeways.’’ 
‘‘Florida’s cities are in agony and are cry-
ing out for help,’’ they wrote. ‘‘This is not 
sustainable.’’ 
In an interview, Suarez said both senators 
have been receptive to his message in pri-
vate, though they also expressed concerns 
about the price tag—concerns that Suarez 
said he could understand, to a point. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO), who is the dis-
tinguished chairman of the Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman MCGOVERN for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, as of this week, over 
10,000 veterans and 130 VHA employees 
have lost their lives to COVID–19. Over 
226,000 veterans and 18,000 VA employ-
ees have tested positive. 
It is clear: We must act now. 
This bill would provide funding to in-
crease VA’s claims and appeals proc-
essing to reduce the backlog caused by 
COVID–19. It would deliver critical 
funding for the Veterans Health Ad-
ministration, bolster VA’s supply chain 
modernization, and support State vet-
erans homes to upgrade and enhance 
their safety operations. It would also 
fund stronger oversight through the 
VA’s Office of Inspector General, se-
cure assistance for unemployed vet-
erans, and prohibit copayments for vet-
erans during the pandemic. 
This bill is critical to ensure the 
health system that veterans rely on 
can continue to meet their needs and 
serve as a backup to America’s over-
whelmed healthcare systems.

and visible smiles is on the horizon, the

path to get there requires this Con-
gress to do quick and thorough work to 
ensure we all get there together. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Texas for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, over the past year, 
Congress has allocated nearly $4 tril-
lion to respond to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. Now Democrat leadership is fol-
lowing through on a campaign promise 
made by President Biden to spend an-
other $2 trillion. 
Madam Speaker, further assistance is 
appropriate for those individuals, fami-
lies, and businesses who have been hit 
the hardest, including restaurants; but 
this bill fails to recognize the improv-
ing economic conditions, as well as the 
fact that more than $1 trillion from 
previous 
relief 
packages 
remains 
unspent. 
Just 9 percent of this bill goes to-
wards combating the virus, and just 1 
percent is directed for vaccines. In-
stead, the apparent priorities for Dem-
ocrat leadership include a bailout for 
mismanaged States, pension funds, an 
increase in the minimum wage, and 
half a billion dollars for the arts and 
humanities. 
Madam Speaker, Congress has al-
ready provided $68 billion for our 
schools, more than double the CDC’s 
highest estimate of what it would take 
for our schools to open safely. We 
should be able to unite in supporting 
an 
economic 
recovery, 
open 
our 
schools, increase testing, and ensure 
the efficient distribution of vaccines. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. PALLONE), who is the 
distinguished chairman of the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
President Biden has set forth a na-
tional plan to crush the virus. With 
this bill, Congress is providing the 
President with the resources and tools 
to implement a national plan that was 
sorely lacking under President Trump. 
States competed against each other 
during the Trump administration for 
personal protection equipment, ven-
tilators, and testing supplies. That now 
ends. 
This legislation provides $20 billion 
to speed up the distribution and admin-
istration of COVID–19 vaccines. It in-
vests over $47 billion in a national test-
ing strategy. It invests $7 billion to 
hire 100,000 new full-time public health 
workers to perform vital tasks, like 
vaccine outreach and contact tracing. 
It invests more than $25 billion to ad-
dress health disparities. 
We also include assistance for strug-
gling families to help keep their lights 
on, the heat working, and the water 
running. We included $7.6 billion to ex-
pand internet connectivity to help stu-
dents and teachers without home inter-
net access. 
Madam Speaker, the American Res-
cue Plan meets the unprecedented 
challenges our Nation is facing, and it 
deserves strong bipartisan support. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER), who is another 
valuable member of the Texas delega-
tion. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in complete opposition to 
the Democrats’ blue State bailout bill. 
This bill will cost the American tax-
payer nearly $2 trillion—let that sit for 
a second—$2 trillion when our Nation 
is already $27 trillion in debt. 
Where does this money go? 
Surely it will be spent towards fight-
ing the pandemic and COVID. Wrong. 
Only 9 percent of this money will go to-
wards fighting COVID–19. The rest of 
the funding is going towards Democrat 
pet projects, like a subway in Silicon 
Valley and a bridge in New York. Tax-
payers in Texas should absolutely not 
be rewarding States who have kept 
their economies shuttered and pre-
vented workers from earning a living. 
Madam Speaker, for these reasons 
and more, I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. DAVID SCOTT), who is the 
distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Agriculture. 
Mr. 
DAVID 
SCOTT 
of 
Georgia. 
Madam Speaker, let’s face facts. Let 
me tell my Republican friends: We 
have a terrible hunger crisis going on 
in this country right now. Fourteen 
million of our children are going to bed 
hungry this night. 
The American people are crying out: 
Congress, help us. 
We have support of our measure from 
the American Farm Federation and 
from Cargill, and we have support of 
our legislation from God Almighty 
Himself. 
What did He tell you and me? 
He said: Feed the hungry and heal 
the sick. 
America is hungry, America is sick, 
and America is calling on you Repub-
licans to love your people and take 
care of your people at this critical time 
of need. 
Madam Speaker, as the first African Amer-
ican Chairman of the House Agriculture Com-
mittee, I am proud that the American Rescue 
Plan Act provides support for all sectors of ag-
ricultural production, including farmers, ranch-
ers, and private forest land owners of color. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 
spends billions of dollars annually in providing 
much needed support to American producers. 
Sadly, Black farmers and other farmers of 
color have received a small share of the 
USDA farm loans and payments as a result of 
discrimination. When these producers did re-
ceive loans or payments, many of them were 
not provided timely or proper loan servicing 
options due to discrimination, which led to pro-
ducers of color losing their land and oper-
ations. 
Sections 1005 and 1006 of the American 
Rescue Plan Act provide targeted and tailored 
support for these farmers and ranchers. I note 
for the record that changes made to these 
sections in the Manager’s Amendment were to 
ensure that these sections would meet the re-
quirements of section 313 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974 for consideration in 
the United States Senate. 
The systemic discrimination against Black 
farmers and other farmers of color by USDA 
is longstanding and well-documented and con-
tinues to present barriers for these producers 
to participate in the agricultural economy. It is 
important that we document this history and 
the continuing challenges for these farmers of 
color in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. 
A 1965 report by the United States Commis-
sion on Civil Rights found that Federal, state, 
and local officials discriminated against Black 
farmers in agricultural programs and that this 
discrimination actively contributed to the de-
cline in the Black ownership of farmland. 
In 1968, a follow up report from the United 
States Commission on Civil Rights found that 
Black farmers continued to face discrimination 
when seeking farm loans and other forms of 
assistance. 
In 1970, the United States Commission on 
Civil Rights again found that discrimination 
continued in USDA program administration. 
The 1970 report indicated that prior to 1968, 
no Black farmer had ever been elected to any 
former Agricultural Stabilization and Conserva-
tion Service committee at the county level in 
the South. In 1970, two out of more than 
4,100 committee members in the South were 
Black farmers, even though there were 58 
counties in the South, where Black farmers 
comprised a majority of the farm operator pop-
ulation. 
In 1982, the United States Commission on 
Civil Rights issued another report on the rapid 
decline of Black-operated farms. The report 
noted that between 1970 and 1980, the Black 
farm population declined 65 percent, com-
pared to a 22 percent decline in the white 
farm population. The report also documented 
numerous 
discrimination 
complaints 
filed 
against USDA field offices regarding the ad-
ministration of farm loan programs and noted 
that for many of these complaints, USDA’s Of-
fice of Equal Opportunity investigated and 
found equal opportunity violations at those 
field offices. The report concluded that racial 
discrimination 
was 
continuing 
within 
the 
USDA, at USDA headquarters, and in the net-
work of field offices that implement USDA pro-
grams. 
In 1988, Congress passed section 617 of 
the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 requiring 
the USDA to establish annual target participa-
tion rates, on a county-wide basis, that would 
ensure that members of socially disadvan-
taged groups receive direct or guaranteed 
farm ownership loans. Congress amended this 
requirement in 1996, to ensure that USDA’s 
implementation was consistent with the hold-
ing of the Supreme Court in Adarand Con-
structors, Inc. v. Federico Pena, Secretary of 
Transportation, 515 U.S. 200 (1995), which 
held that race-based actions by the govern-
ment is within constitutional constraints when 
it is necessary to further a compelling interest 
such as the ‘‘unhappy persistence of both the 
practice and lingering effects of racial discrimi-
nation against minority groups.’’ 
A 1995 U.S. Government Accountability Of-
fice (GAO) report found that socially disadvan-
taged producers were significantly underrep-
resented on the county and community com-
mittees of the former Agricultural Stabilization

and Conservation Service. Specifically, the re-
port found that while minority producers ac-
counted for nearly 5 percent of the producers 
eligible to vote for committee members, minor-
ity producers only represented 2.1 percent of 
county committee members in the United 
States. 
In 1997, the USDA formed a Civil Rights 
Action Team to hold nationwide listening ses-
sions to hear from socially disadvantaged and 
minority farmers. A report published after the 
listening sessions documented Black, His-
panic, Asian-American, and American Indian 
farmers who told stories of USDA hurting mi-
nority farmers more than helping them. Minor-
ity farmers described how their discrimination 
complaints were caught in the backlog of ap-
peals or if successfully appealed, were given 
findings of discrimination that were not en-
forced. The report acknowledged that discrimi-
nation in USDA program delivery continued to 
exist to a large degree unabated. 
Also in 1997, the USDA Office of the In-
spector General (OIG) issued a report to the 
USDA Secretary that noted ‘‘a climate of dis-
order within the civil rights staff at [the Farm 
Service Agency].’’ It was difficult for the OIG to 
even determine the number and status of civil 
rights complaints at the agency and depart-
ment because of that climate. As the OIG later 
summarized in a 2005 audit, ‘‘it took 12 days 
longer to complete minority applications, delin-
quencies were higher for minority borrowers 
than nonminority borrowers, and minority bor-
rowers were reluctant to enter into FSA offices 
to apply for loans.’’ 
In 1998, the USDA National Commission on 
Small Farms further described and docu-
mented the longstanding discrimination of 
USDA towards socially disadvantaged pro-
ducers. And, it observed that ‘‘discrimination 
has been a contributing factor in the decline of 
Black farmers over the last several decades.’’ 
The Commission’s report also notes the ‘‘his-
tory of under-allocation of resources to institu-
tions that have served minority farmers,’’ the 
‘‘disgraceful’’ ‘‘failure to elect minority farmers 
to positions on FSA County Committees,’’ and 
more. 
During the period between 1997 and 2000, 
Black farmers, Native American farmers, and 
Latinx farmers filed lawsuits alleging USDA 
discriminated against them on the basis of 
race in processing their farm program applica-
tions and that USDA failed to investigate their 
complaints of discrimination. But settlements 
resulting from these lawsuits have not pro-
vided the relief necessary for these farmers of 
color to participate fully in the American agri-
cultural economy. 
For example, the Los Angeles Times re-
ported in 2012 that payments made to Black 
farmers under the Pigford settlements were 
significantly eroded by state taxes, as well as 
tax debt related to forgiven USDA farm loans. 
In 2001, a report by the U.S. Commission 
on Civil Rights documented the continued dis-
criminatory lending practices against minority 
farmers. The Commission found that Black 
farmers waited four times longer than white 
farmers for USDA farm loans. The Commis-
sion recommended that USDA resolve the 
backlog of civil rights complaints and docu-
ment and alleviate discriminatory lending prac-
tices. However, USDA continued to struggle 
with resolving its backlog of civil rights com-
plaints. In 2008, GAO reported that USDA’s 
difficulties in resolving discrimination com-
plaints persisted and that the USDA had not 
achieved its goal of preventing future backlogs 
of discrimination complaints. 
Recent studies and reports continue to doc-
ument the challenges and barriers faced by 
farmers of color due to race or ethnic discrimi-
nation or the legacy of such discrimination. A 
September 20, 2017, study in the Agriculture 
and Human Values journal described the chal-
lenges faced by Latinx farmers due to failure 
of agricultural agencies to engage in appro-
priate outreach or account for language bar-
riers. 
In 2019, a GAO report observed that so-
cially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers had 
proportionately less agricultural credit than 
non-socially disadvantaged farmers and ranch-
ers. This report found that farmers and ranch-
ers of color continued to face more difficulties 
in obtaining farm loans and highlighted the 
historic, systemic discrimination against such 
farmers. 
The 
Market 
Facilitation 
Program 
and 
Coronavirus Food Assistance Program are re-
cent USDA programs designed to bolster the 
farm economy; in both programs the majority 
of funds went to non-minority farmers. For ex-
ample, the Environmental Working Group re-
ported that nonminority farmers received near-
ly 97 percent of the $9.2 billion provided by 
the USDA’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Pro-
gram. Additionally, the Farm Bill Law Enter-
prise reported that 99 percent of Market Facili-
tation Payments went to non-minority farmers. 
The systemic discrimination of farmers, 
ranchers, and other producers of color by the 
USDA is longstanding and well-documented. I 
urge my colleagues to support me and the 
Committee on Agriculture as we work to en-
able socially disadvantaged producers to suc-
ceed in the agricultural economy. Sections 
1005 and 1006 of the bill before the House 
today are critical to that work, and I urge my 
colleagues to support this measure. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
b 2100 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Chair for that reminder. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, in a radical departure from 
all previous COVID–19 relief laws, the 
bill before us today mandates taxpayer 
funding 
for 
abortion 
on 
demand. 
Today, the Rules Committee refused to 
even allow a pro-life amendment spon-
sored by CATHY MCMORRIS RODGERS, 
VIRGINIA FOXX, and JACKIE WALORSKI, 
cosponsored by 206 Members. 
Madam Speaker, it is shocking to 
learn that the methods of abortion in-
clude dismemberment of a child’s frag-
ile body, including decapitation, and 
that drugs like RU–486 starve the baby 
to death. 
Unborn babies killed by abortion at 
20 weeks or later experience excru-
ciating suffering and physical pain. 
And until rendered unconscious or dead 
by these hideous procedures, the baby 
feels every cut. 
Mr. Biden once wrote constituents, 
explaining that his support for laws 
against funding for abortion by saying 
‘‘it would protect both the woman and 
her unborn child.’’ 
Mr. Biden went on to say ‘‘that those 
of us who are opposed to abortion 
should not be compelled to pay for 
them.’’ I agree. Most Americans agree; 
58 percent, according to the recent 
Marist poll. Unborn babies, Madam 
Speaker, need the President of the 
United States and Members of Congress 
to be their friend and advocate, not 
their adversary. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS). 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the American Relief Plan 
desperately needed by Philadelphia 
constituents. This plan extends the 
poverty-busting 
earned 
income 
tax 
credits and provides billions for small 
businesses. It expands vaccine access, 
addresses health disparities, and helps 
schools open safely. The American peo-
ple are counting on us to crush the 
virus. Let’s do the right thing and pass 
this very critical bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the ranking 
member of the House Committee on 
Rules. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good friend from Texas for yielding. 
Today, the House is considering a 
massive budget reconciliation package 
that the majority claims to be using 
for additional coronavirus relief funds. 
Having already passed five bipartisan 
relief packages over the last year, to-
taling almost $4 trillion in spending, 
the majority is now seeking to spend 
nearly $2 trillion more. 
But unlike the past five measures, 
which were bipartisan deals with both 
Republican and Democratic support, 
today’s bill is strictly partisan, with 
only Democratic support and input. 
And with a glance at the bill, it is easy 
to see why. 
First, the vast majority of this so- 
called rescue package has nothing to 
do with the COVID–19 pandemic. The 
bill fails to keep a laser focus on pro-
viding relief for Americans, ensuring 
schools are open to educate our chil-
dren, and moving to swiftly reopen the 
economy. 
Instead, the majority has thrown in 
completely unrelated items that just 
so happen to be at the top of their pro-
gressive wish list. This includes irre-
sponsible policies like Federal bailouts 
for certain pension funds, providing 
bloated contributions to State and 
local 
governments, 
and 
arbitrarily 
raising the minimum wage, which will 
cost well more than a million people to 
lose their jobs. Incidentally, the same 
minimum wage provision is not going 
to be considered in the Senate and will 
have to be stripped from the bill. 
But perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised 
by these misguided provisions, given 
how completely shut out of this proc-
ess Republicans have been. During the 
markups across nine committees that

considered this package, Republicans 
offered 245 amendments to help fix 
these and other problems. 
Republicans 
offered 
commonsense 
amendments to reopen schools, give ad-
ditional resources to the NIH, provide 
funding to make sure all teachers have 
the opportunity to receive a COVID 
vaccine, and many more. Yet, only two 
of these amendments were accepted by 
the Democrats in committee markups, 
and one of those two amendments is 
actually being stripped out of the bill 
in the manager’s amendment today. 
A $1.9 trillion package that is being 
brought to the floor with next to no 
Republican input? Simply astonishing. 
Madam Speaker, it is clear what we 
need to do. Our entire Nation is suf-
fering as a result of this pandemic. 
Every day, more businesses shutter. 
Every day, children are falling further 
behind. And every day, people fall 
deeper and deeper into despair caused, 
in part, by isolation. 
Instead of proceeding with this pro-
gressive wish list, we need to take real 
action to open the economy. Above all 
else, we need to get children back in 
school. 
Prior to the pandemic, children had 
access to in-person staff and services at 
school. But now, with schools remain-
ing closed, we see the results: more 
students falling behind, more students 
contemplating suicide, more children 
falling into despair. 
For millions of children, the ground 
lost during the pandemic may never be 
recovered. We are failing an entire gen-
eration of our children, and we need to 
reverse course and get them back in 
school. 
Madam Speaker, there was, and still 
is, an opportunity to put together a bi-
partisan relief package. There is still 
time to focus on policies that will re-
open the economy and make sure kids 
can learn in person, but we cannot do 
it if the majority insists on this bloat-
ed package with so many unrelated 
policies. 
So long as the majority insists that 
it is their way or the highway, true 
help for the American people cannot be 
achieved. Madam Speaker, I urge my 
colleagues to reject this rule and the 
underlying legislation. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
LEGER 
FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
pandemic’s 
tentacles 
have infiltrated every facet of our com-
munities’ lives. The brilliance of this 
rescue package is that it understands 
those complexities and addresses those 
many needs. 
For example, since the pandemic 
began, we have seen increased reports 
of abuse of women and children, so this 
bill helps fund shelters and refuge. 
The country has also seen the heart-
breaking devastation in Tribal commu-
nities. Native Americans are four times 
more likely to be hospitalized and 
twice as likely to die from COVID–19 
than White Americans. So, this bill in-
cludes over $20 billion to assist Native 
people, including their Tribal govern-
ments, health facilities, and education. 
We need this package to end the Na-
tion’s suffering. Let’s pass this bill, 
save lives, save livelihoods, save com-
munities. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Arkansas (Mr. WOMACK), a valuable 
member of our Appropriations Com-
mittee and a subcommittee ranking 
member. 
Mr. WOMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
think a little honesty is in order to-
night. It is no secret that this so-called 
American Rescue Plan Act has little to 
do with the hardships placed on Ameri-
cans by COVID. 
When 90 percent of a spending plan, 
rammed through on a sham of a budget 
resolution, gets spent years down the 
road, with much of it having little to 
do with the coronavirus, we should at 
least be honest with our constituents. 
It is apparently Christmas again. 
Here is an example. What does the 
multiemployer pension issue have to do 
with the pandemic? Remember the 
failed joint select committee that was 
supposed to solve that problem back in 
2018? That was long before COVID. But 
here we are, about to spend $85-plus bil-
lion on this bailout. That is double the 
amount of money we give to the Na-
tional Institutes of Health. Look, be-
fore we ask future generations to float 
us another $2 trillion to pay off these 
liberal promises, let’s at least have the 
integrity to admit that this really isn’t 
about COVID. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. Let me just remind my col-
leagues that 70 percent of the Amer-
ican people support this bill. Repub-
lican governors and Republican mayors 
from all across the country support 
this bill. The only place where it isn’t 
bipartisan is here in the Congress. 
Republicans say, oh, the people can’t 
be trusted to know what is in the bill. 
The fact of the matter is, people sup-
port this because they support more 
money for vaccinations; more money in 
terms of direct payments to individuals 
and enhanced unemployment benefits; 
and more money for our cities and 
towns, our first responders, our police 
and our fire departments, and so many 
other things. 
I know my Republican friends have 
developed this habit of trying to over-
turn the will of the American people. 
Well, enough. The American people 
want this, and we are going to deliver 
it for them. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. 
SCHAKOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
over half a million Americans have 
been killed by a merciless virus. That 
is about the population of New Haven, 
Connecticut. Now, also picture wiping 
out Grand Rapids, Michigan; Toledo, 
Ohio; or McAllen, Texas. 
Ten million Americans are unem-
ployed right now. Nearly one in four 
households have experienced hunger 
this year. These are horrible statistics, 
but there is good news building on this 
floor right now. 
President Biden promised help is on 
the way, and here it comes, the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, a real plan to crush 
the virus, put money into people’s 
pockets, allow our States and counties 
and cities to continue to provide the 
services that are necessary. 
No wonder up to 80 percent of Ameri-
cans want all of us—all of us—to vote 
‘‘yes’’ tonight. Let’s give it to them. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE), the ranking 
member of the Health Subcommittee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today due to my strong concerns 
with the Democrats’ COVID–19 bill. 
With a very small percentage of this 
massive package specifically directed 
at combating COVID–19, the $1.9 tril-
lion COVID bill is more of a Demo-
cratic wish list. 
I 
have 
tried 
to 
add 
relief 
for 
healthcare providers, with funds spe-
cifically for rural and Medicaid pro-
viders, but Democrats voted this down. 
It is amazing how it is okay to have 
the Silicon Valley subway, the Seaway 
bridge in New York, and a bailout of 
multiemployer 
pension 
plans 
from 
problems prior to COVID–19, but my 
amendment to help healthcare pro-
viders was not included. 
I was proud to support the last five 
COVID–19 relief packages to help Ken-
tuckians. I think we can all agree that 
we need to boost vaccine distribution, 
safely return all students back to in- 
person learning, and help people return 
to work. Much of the funds in this par-
tisan bill will not be used until next 
year or later. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. SCHNEIDER). 
Mr. SCHNEIDER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to implore that my col-
leagues 
pass 
this 
urgently 
needed 
COVID relief for millions of struggling 
Americans. 
Across the country, families and 
friends have had to say good-bye to 
more than 500,000 loved ones, too often 
knowing that they have died alone. 
In our communities, large and small, 
more than 18 million Americans are re-
ceiving 
unemployment 
benefits 
as 
their only lifeline. Millions of small 
businesses are on the brink of perma-
nent closure. Schools are struggling to 
reopen. 
Meanwhile, the miraculous vaccines 
offer a light, but it is still at the end of 
a long and steep tunnel. 
President Biden’s American Rescue 
Plan will get people back to work, help 
parents safely send their children back 
to school, assist our families in paying 
their bills and our small businesses in 
building their future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H768 
February 26, 2021 
This bill helps people and businesses 
in every community in Illinois and in 
every State in America. That is why it 
has such bipartisan support across the 
country. It deserves the same support 
here in Congress. 
To truly heal our economy and our 
Nation, we must pass the American 
Rescue Plan. Madam Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I am 
disappointed because we are again on 
the floor in a closed rule, where zero 
Republican amendments were made in 
order because, again, we are here vot-
ing on a package that has hundreds of 
billions of dollars in non-COVID-re-
lated spending. 
Again, I am down here on the floor, 
disappointed that the majority dis-
allowed my amendments. 
One of my amendments would have 
reported on the impact the Biden job- 
killing Keystone XL order would have 
on small businesses. 
My other amendment, which was de-
nied, prevented taxpayer dollars from 
funding child slave labor. No, you did 
not hear that wrong. In fact, this is the 
fifth time the Democrats have blocked 
this type of amendment from me. What 
is the issue with being anti-child slave 
labor? 
Like I said, I am not sure how this is 
controversial, but when faced with the 
binary decision to source these min-
erals from human rights abusers in Af-
rica and China or source them from 
Minnesota under the best labor stand-
ards and the best environmental stand-
ards in the world, I will take made in 
America 150 percent of the time. 
I join my constituents’ disappoint-
ment in this process. This is very con-
cerning. 
b 2115 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT), 
the chair of the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of the legis-
lation because there are many reasons 
to vote for the American Rescue Plan. 
If you want to ensure that schools 
can reopen safely and make up for lost 
time in the classroom, vote for the bill. 
If you want to provide relief for insti-
tutions of higher education and their 
students, vote for the bill. 
If you want to save our childcare sys-
tem from collapse, vote for the bill. 
If you want to protect workers 
against the virus and increase their 
wages, vote for this bill. 
If you want to maintain access to af-
fordable healthcare for workers who 
have lost their jobs, vote for the bill. 
If you want to prevent more than a 
million retirees from losing their hard- 
earned pensions, vote for this bill. 
Finally, if you want to keep children 
and families from going hungry, pre-
vent domestic and gender-based vio-
lence, and protect older Americans dur-
ing this pandemic, you must vote for 
this bill. 
The American people need to know 
that help is on the way. I urge my col-
leagues to support the bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
MALLIOTAKIS). 
Ms. MALLIOTAKIS. Madam Speaker, 
this bill is not tailored to the specific 
needs of our Nation or its citizens. I 
support helping the unemployed, strug-
gling businesses, and returning money 
to taxpayers, but you give $1,400 with 
one hand and it costs $15,000 per Amer-
ican household to pay for it. 
Congress thinks it knows how to 
spend hardworking taxpayers’ money 
better than they do, all while our Na-
tion approaches $30 trillion in debt and 
$1 trillion from previous relief remains 
unspent. 
Right now, vaccine production and 
distribution is a top priority, yet less 
than 1 percent of these funds go to it, 
showing how bloated this bill is. It 
spends billions on unrelated projects, 
from a San Francisco rail line to fam-
ily planning; and a whopping $3.5 bil-
lion for The Global Fund, forcing 
American taxpayers to pick up 88 per-
cent of this international fund’s ex-
penditures, all while our diplomats 
can’t even get the vaccine. 
My amendment would have required 
States receiving billions to commit to 
not raising taxes on their citizens. The 
CDC said it would cost $25 billion to re-
open America’s schools safely. Only in 
this mismanaged government would 
things end up costing eight times more 
than originally estimated. This is an 
epic fail. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ), the 
distinguished chair of the Committee 
on Small Business. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, 
half a million lives lost, over 400,000 
small businesses closed for good, 700,000 
new unemployment claims filed last 
week, 54 million are food insecure. This 
is a crisis the scope of which none of us 
have seen in our lifetimes in this coun-
try. 
The Federal Government has a re-
sponsibility to show up for the Amer-
ican people, and that is exactly what 
President Joe Biden is doing, to assure 
them that their struggles aren’t theirs 
alone, that this relief is coming, and 
we will get through this together. 
As chairwoman of the House Small 
Business Committee, I am proud this 
bill includes $50 billion to get our small 
businesses back on their feet. We are 
providing targeted assistance for those 
hardest hit, including grants for small 
entertainment businesses, cultural in-
stitutions, 
and 
independent 
res-
taurants, plus an additional $15 billion 
for EIDL advances, and more for PPP. 
Let’s pass this rule and let’s move for-
ward. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the rule. 
It has been nearly a year now since 
the COVID–19 pandemic reached our 
shores, and Iowans are still struggling. 
Iowans need targeted pandemic relief. 
I would have been the first to cross 
the aisle and compromise on legisla-
tion that would help Iowans and Amer-
icans who are in need, but this behe-
moth of a bill fails to provide targeted 
relief that my constituents asked for. 
It forces taxpayers to bail out States 
that 
have 
chronically 
mismanaged 
their budgets. It includes a $15 min-
imum wage hike, which would deci-
mate the rural economy in Iowa and 
destroy the very livelihoods this bill 
claims to be saving. It opens the door 
for taxpayer funding for abortions. 
With $1 trillion from previous relief 
packages still unspent, this legislation 
contains no guardrails to ensure new 
money is used on pandemic relief this 
year. This legislation abdicates our re-
sponsibility to those who need our sup-
port and to taxpayers. Voting for this 
rule is a slap in the face to taxpayers, 
and I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this rule. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. WATERS), the dis-
tinguished chair of the Committee on 
Financial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I am 
so grateful that we have President 
Biden’s leadership in the White House 
to tackle the ongoing pandemic. H.R. 
1319, the American Rescue Plan Act of 
2021, carries out this plan and delivers 
the relief that communities across this 
country need so very much. 
Critically, the bill provides more 
than $75 billion for programs in my 
committee’s jurisdiction, including $20 
billion for emergency rental assist-
ance, $5 billion for 70,000 new housing 
vouchers, $10 billion in homeowner as-
sistance, $10 billion to boost emergency 
medical equipment production, $10 bil-
lion for small businesses, and $15 bil-
lion for airline workers. 
I am so pleased that we are increas-
ing the stimulus payments from $600 to 
$2,000 for each of our constituents. I am 
a happy camper tonight. This is what 
America needs. 
Republicans ought to be a part of 
this; but if they are not, then we are 
going without them. 
With hunger growing and millions 
out of work and at risk of eviction or 
foreclosure, America needs this bill 
passed into law. Vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
bill. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), a valuable 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to the rule. 
Only 9 percent of the underlying bill 
goes to combating COVID–19 through 
public health spending. The other 91

percent is a partisan wish list being 
pushed by my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle. Union pensions, blue 
State bailouts, Planned Parenthood, 
and even a bridge and a tunnel. That is 
what most of this bill is about, not 
COVID–19 relief. 
We need targeted, tailored relief that 
actually helps the American people, 
not this $2 trillion boondoggle. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the rule and the un-
derlying bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, this 
pandemic has been cruelly uneven. 
Some people remain unscathed. Wall 
Street is booming, online retailers are 
surging, some work remotely with 
their incomes intact, and some fami-
lies remain healthy. Yet 17 percent of 
Americans go to food banks every 
week. One in six people can’t pay their 
rent. Some people are enduring a long 
winter in sub-zero temperatures, un-
able to pay their heating bill. Twenty- 
five percent of the people who make 
under $40,000 a year are now unem-
ployed. State and local governments 
crippled, businesses and restaurants 
closed. Worst of all, we all know people 
who have gotten sick and died. 
This legislation is not a blue State 
bailout or liberal handout, it is how we 
address the suffering that has crippled 
our country, it is how we move forward 
and beat this pandemic. 
We have this great and awesome re-
sponsibility, this great and awesome 
honor to try to help people facing some 
of the most desperate times they have 
ever faced. Let’s pass this comprehen-
sive plan. Let’s move our country for-
ward, and let’s do it together. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN). 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong oppo-
sition to the rule and to H.R. 1319. 
We do need targeted relief for those 
hurt by this pandemic, but this is bad 
legislation. 
Republicans 
introduced 
over 250 amendments to this nearly $2 
trillion bill, and Democrats only ulti-
mately accepted one. That is not unity. 
This is merely socialism in sheep’s 
clothing, 
redistribution 
of 
wealth 
through cash payouts to many who 
have had no financial impact whatso-
ever from COVID. It is also redistribu-
tion of wealth from future generations 
who will be stuck with the tab. 
The CBO predicts our economy will 
grow by 3.7 percent this year without 
any further congressional action. With 
over $1 trillion in unspent funds from 
previous packages, we can’t afford to 
jeopardize our children’s future with 
this socialist spending spree. I urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from the U.S. Virgin Islands (Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
the time for bold and decisive action is 
now. This American Rescue Plan Act 
will crush the virus, return children 
safely to school, support vaccinations, 
put dollars in families’ pockets, and 
put people back to work. The plan will 
mount a national vaccination program 
that sets up community vaccination 
sites nationwide. 
In the Virgin Islands, the loss of 
cruise ships, along with air travel tour-
ists, have cut the heart of our econ-
omy, causing loss of jobs, closure of 
businesses, and lost revenues for gov-
ernment operations. 
Additionally, we have yet to under-
stand the long-term impact the pan-
demic will have on our children. In the 
Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, our 
children are already overwhelmed and 
severely compromised due to facilities 
and the school year loss that they had 
from the 2017 hurricanes. 
Lastly, I am proud to note provisions 
in this bill for the U.S. territories that 
I have been fighting for. This plan cre-
ates equality in the child tax credit 
and earned income tax credit. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to please support this bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. PLASKETT. And for my col-
leagues on the other side who have to 
give 
divisive 
platitudes 
and 
non-
support, you are welcome. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to heed the gavel. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. CLINE). 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, we all 
want to beat this virus, but you can’t 
beat a COVID pandemic with 91 percent 
pork barrel spending in the bill. Only 9 
percent of the funding in this bill is 
going to COVID programs. 
$1,400 checks at what cost? $13,000 per 
taxpayer? 
If we have any additional relief we 
need to pass for addressing COVID, it 
must be targeted, temporary, and tied 
to the pandemic. 
What is not targeted? 
$350 billion in State and local bail-
outs that reward States that continue 
to shut down their economies. 
What is not temporary? 
A $1.5 million bridge to Canada or 
$112 million for an underground subway 
to Silicon Valley. 
What is not tied to COVID? 
$86 billion to bail out the multiem-
ployer pension plans that were poorly 
managed in Democrat-run States be-
fore the pandemic even started, $50 
million in taxpayer dollars for abortion 
on demand. 
This liberal wish list masquerading 
as COVID relief will cripple our econ-
omy, harm our ability to reopen our 
Nation, and burden our children and 
grandchildren with unsustainable lev-
els of debt. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose 
this spending package, and I urge my 
colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. BEYER). 
Mr. BEYER. Madam Speaker, we 
have a choice tonight. Our American 
children are hungry, the recovery is 
stalling, and a million new people file 
for unemployment every week. 
We can do our jobs, pass a national 
vaccination plan, safely reopen our 
schools, send relief checks to those in 
need, support the unemployed, and pro-
tect American jobs. Or we can let them 
fend for themselves and slowly scratch 
their way back to health at great 
human cost. 
I 
choose 
relief, 
recovery, 
and 
progress. 
Madam Speaker, my first job: In 1966, 
$1.25 an hour, minimum wage. 
Sixteen times this Congress has cho-
sen to increase the minimum wage, and 
every time there was a CBO score or a 
chamber of commerce or a conserv-
ative economist who talked about the 
shrinkage of low-wage jobs. But if we 
were persuaded by this job-loss mirage, 
we would never raise the minimum 
wage. And I refuse to believe that this 
is American exceptionalism. 
b 2130 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Lubbock, Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
there is an old country saying: You can 
put all the perfume and lipstick you 
want on a pig, and it is still pork, and 
it still stinks. 
H.R. 1319 is filled to the brim with 
bad policies and partisan priorities 
that is disguised as ‘‘COVID relief.’’ 
This bill: Pays people more to be on 
unemployment than to go to work. 
Slaps small businesses with job-kill-
ing wage mandates. 
Gives a $350 billion windfall to States 
who were mismanaged and broke before 
COVID. 
Hands a blank check to union bosses 
and greedy corporate executives who 
ran their pensions into the ground and 
stuck taxpayers with the tab. 
It rewards temper tantrums from 
teacher unions by doling out billions of 
dollars to schools who refuse to open 
their doors to their students. 
This bill is chock full of bad policies, 
barriers to recovery, and bailouts ga-
lore. 
Madam Speaker, let’s open the coun-
try up, get our kids back into the 
classroom, and get America back to 
work. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JOHNSON), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on 
Science, Space and Technology. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of the 
American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and 
in strong support of this rule. 
Madam Speaker, when the COVID–19 
pandemic hit our shores a year ago, re-
searchers across the Nation and across 
many fields of science and engineering 
jumped 
into 
action. 
The 
Nation’s 
STEM talent redirected brainpower 
and resources to combatting the pan-
demic. And thanks in large part to

February 26, 2021 
these efforts, we now have some posi-
tive news about our fight against 
COVID. 
However, important scientific work 
remains to be done in this effort. The 
Committee on Science, Space, and 
Technology’s provisions included in 
this package direct funding through 
the National Science Foundation and 
the National Institute of Standards 
and Technology for vital research re-
lated to prevention, response, and re-
covery from COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my col-
leagues across the House for their work 
on this important rescue package, and 
I urge its adoption. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, Republicans will amend 
the rule to strike the consideration of 
the Pelosi payoff bill, and instead, con-
sider H.R. 1371, the Crush the Virus 
Act, introduced by Representative TOM 
REED, which is attached, and will pro-
vide over $160 billion to expand the ad-
ministration of vaccines and provide 
direct relief for the coronavirus. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment in the record along with 
extraneous material immediately prior 
to the vote on the previous question. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. GONZALEZ), who is here to ex-
plain the amendment. 
Mr. GONZALEZ of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Mr. BURGESS for his 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, if we defeat the pre-
vious question, we will call up H.R. 
1371, the Crush the Virus Act of 2021, 
introduced by my good friend, Mr. TOM 
REED. 
This is legislation that is based off of 
the Problem Solvers Caucus-endorsed 
framework for additional funding in 
order to defeat the virus by making 
further investments into testing, vac-
cine distribution, PPE, and utilizing 
the Defense Production Act. 
In other words, this is a targeted so-
lution that can garner bipartisan sup-
port—unlike what we are doing today— 
and show the American people that we 
are committed to working together to 
defeat the virus. 
To date, while Congress may have 
struggled at times to deliver timely re-
sults, we have come together each time 
to pass needed legislation to help small 
businesses, hospitals, and Americans 
impacted by the virus. This is the way 
Congress is supposed to work. But in-
stead, House Democrats have embarked 
upon a purely partisan approach, push-
ing aside Republican lawmakers, like 
myself, who actually want to find com-
mon ground. 
And for what? 
A nearly $2 trillion bill that is not 
targeted for the coronavirus, includes 
policies that will hurt job creation, and 
in the words of Larry Summers—who is 
no Republican—is a ‘‘step into the un-
known.’’ 
Madam Speaker, what the American 
people need is for us to put partisan-
ship aside and identify targeted fund-
ing prior to spending $2 trillion of tax-
payer dollars only weeks after this 
body enacted another nearly $1 trillion, 
much of which has yet to be spent. 
Madam Speaker, this is why the 
Problem Solvers Caucus came together 
earlier this year to identify, in a bipar-
tisan way, the still outstanding fund-
ing that is needed to defeat the virus. 
The bipartisan agreement is the basis 
for the legislation we will bring up if 
we defeat the previous question here 
before us. 
My friend TOM REED’s bill, the Crush 
the Virus Act, will provide more than 
$160 billion in targeted aid, including: 
$11.5 billion for manufacturing and pro-
duction of vaccines; $35 billion for the 
Provider Relief Fund; and $5 billion for 
the use of the Defense Production Act. 
This proposal will speed up vaccine 
distribution and administration in a 
timely manner and supports our brave 
frontline healthcare workers. 
I thank Mr. REED for his leadership 
as co-chair of the Problem Solvers Cau-
cus and for pushing this proposal. 
Madam Speaker, let me make a final 
point and a broader appeal to my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. 
The American people sent to Wash-
ington the slimmest House majority in 
quite some time and an evenly split 
Senate. The message they sent was 
clear: It was not that you have some 
broad mandate to jam down a bunch of 
progressive policies, it was that they 
want us to actually work together, to 
come together and solve the problems 
in a bipartisan way. I think the mes-
sage was clear. And the more the ma-
jority ignores it, the shorter their ma-
jority will be. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on For-
eign Affairs. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, as 
chair of the House Committee on For-
eign Affairs, I speak in strong support 
of the international provisions of the 
American Rescue package. With a total 
of $10 billion, this is a relatively small 
yet critical investment in fighting 
COVID and its effects around the 
world. 
Pandemics do not respect inter-
national borders. To control this pan-
demic, we need to mitigate its global 
spread. This provision puts global 
health front and center, supporting ef-
forts to relieve overburdened health 
systems and medical workers and help 
governments develop and distribute 
vaccines. 
To address the humanitarian crises 
that have been exacerbated by this 
pandemic, this provision will provide 
funding for the most immediate life-
saving assistance, including shelter, 
food, clean water, basic medical care. 
Additionally, it provides COVID-re-
lated relief for vulnerable refugees who 
are already vulnerable. 
Madam Speaker, this provision would 
also provide flexible funding for eco-
nomic support to help ensure that even 
more need isn’t created as a result of 
the economic impacts of COVID, which 
are already severe. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time is re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 5 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 8 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GOMEZ). 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, we 
don’t have any time to waste. By the 
time I am done with this 1-minute 
speech, roughly 10 people in L.A. Coun-
ty, home to my district, will have test-
ed positive for COVID–19. And in an-
other 5 minutes, someone in my county 
will die of COVID–19. 
And while I am sure our healthcare 
heroes and frontline workers appre-
ciate our thanks, words alone are not 
enough. 
Our gratitude needs to be expressed 
with funding and resources. Our appre-
ciation needs to be in the form of bene-
fits and assistance. 
Our Black and Brown communities, 
those 
being 
disproportionately 
im-
pacted by this pandemic, aren’t going 
to get through this crisis with plati-
tudes. They need action. They need ac-
cess to vaccines, money in their pock-
ets to pay their bills, help getting their 
kids back in the classrooms, and sup-
port putting food on their tables. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I am 
going to vote to pass the American 
Rescue Plan, and I encourage my col-
leagues to do the same. 
This is our chance to stop the spread 
of this virus, rebuild our economy, and 
give every American, regardless of 
their background or ZIP Code, the op-
portunity to turn the page on this dark 
chapter of our country’s history and 
come out stronger in the end. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. 
PANETTA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
after one long year of this pandemic, 
many of my constituents are anxious. 
And, yeah, they are angry. Their 
health has been harmed, their busi-
nesses have been shut down, and they 
are absolutely frustrated waiting for 
their vaccines. They are not happy 
with our ex-President’s response, and 
they are not pleased with the local re-
sponse. That is why now, more than 
ever, we in Congress need to continue 
our response to COVID–19. 
Madam Speaker, in the past year, we 
passed five bipartisan bills that kept

the economy afloat and the poverty 
rate flat. That is why on this night 
with this pandemic raging this year we 
must support this rule, which will put 
shots in arms, checks in pockets, kids 
in schools, food on tables, strike teams 
in nursing homes, keep police and fire-
fighters on our street, keep pensions 
secure, and provide vaccines for essen-
tial 
workers, 
including 
my 
farm-
workers on the Central Coast of Cali-
fornia, so that they can do their job for 
their families and for our food security. 
Madam Speaker, let’s do our job to-
night for our constituents and for this 
country and pass the American Rescue 
Act. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, I recognize the crit-
ical work that was done by the Con-
gressional Doctors Caucus on this ef-
fort. The thesis was that we are going 
to crush the coronavirus. 
You think that you would want to in-
volve the people who left the world of 
healthcare providing to come and serve 
in the people’s House. 
Unfortunately, 
those 
amendments 
that were thoughtfully introduced were 
rejected at the Committee on Rules. 
We had amendments, such as allow-
ing the FDA to use real-world evidence 
in their evaluation of the emergency 
use authorization that is currently 
pending. 
We were going to reduce the Med-
icaid payment error rate, which seemed 
like a good idea. 
Medicaid 
home- 
and 
community- 
based services, substance use disorder 
treatment, and mental health services 
were to be expanded. 
The public health workforce allowing 
for loan repayment was rejected. 
An 
amendment 
providing 
for 
coronavirus testing at the southern 
border—we know we have got a prob-
lem with increased people coming 
across the southern border without au-
thorization. President Biden has indi-
cated that he is welcoming that, but as 
a consequence, we need to be certain 
that we are protecting Americans from 
the introduction of the coronavirus. 
This was a measure to allow for in-
creased testing on the southern border, 
but we couldn’t accept that. 
Hyde protections, you have heard 
many people talk about that. That was 
rejected at the Committee on Rules, 
with a variety of amendments. 
Dr. Miller-Meeks had an amendment 
to allow for the standardized testing to 
go on in classrooms this next year, not 
using it to reduce payments to schools 
that don’t measure up but using it as a 
diagnostic test. Let’s find out how far 
behind some of our classrooms are. 
All of these were thoughtful amend-
ments introduced by the GOP Doctors 
Caucus. Unfortunately, all were re-
jected. You would think if you wanted 
to crush the coronavirus, you would 
ask your doctor. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. I yield 1 minute to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. 
CAROLYN
B. MALONEY), the distin-
guished chair of the Committee on 
Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of this bill and of the 1.4 mil-
lion first responders, teachers, transit 
workers, sanitation workers, and other 
public servants already laid off from 
State and local governments across 
this Nation. We must act before more 
people lose their jobs, and before more 
lifesaving programs are cut. 
Madam Speaker, the State and local 
funding included in this package will 
provide many local governments dedi-
cated support for the first time since 
this pandemic struck. It can be used to 
administer vaccines, increase testing, 
and save countless jobs by replacing 
lost revenue. 
For New York City, which last month 
projected a $10.5 billion loss in ex-
pected tax revenue, this money would 
mean it can continue to provide vac-
cines and food assistance and reopen 
schools safely. Hundreds of local offi-
cials told us the relief in this bill will 
mean recovery instead of recession and 
cannot come fast enough. Taken to-
gether, this could be the light this— 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time 
of the gentlewoman has expired. 
The Chair would again remind all 
Members to heed the gavel. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am 
prepared to close, and I yield myself 
the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, in closing, it doesn’t 
look like this bill is going to open our 
economy. It is not going to open our 
schools. It is not going to provide tar-
geted relief to those who need it most. 
I am willing to talk about nutritional 
assistance, but what I am not willing 
to talk about is a gilded underground 
railway under Silicon Valley. 
Madam Speaker, this is one of the 
most expensive bills in the history of 
the people’s House. And it doesn’t 
prioritize the immediate needs of the 
American people. Rather than work for 
the American people, Democrats are 
working for their own future 2 years 
from now. I think that is unacceptable. 
Look, I recognize that President 
Biden has worked hard to make vac-
cines more available, but the very vac-
cines he’s making available are the 
ones that President Trump worked so 
hard to get developed and into produc-
tion. 
b 2145 
Let’s acknowledge success where it 
has occurred. I am going to urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote on the previous question so 
we can offer the amendment. I am 
going to urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on the rule, 
a ‘‘no’’ vote on the underlying meas-
ures. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, we 
are in the midst of a pandemic, the 
likes of which we haven’t seen in 100 
years. It is catastrophic in every way 
imaginable. To hear some of my Repub-
lican friends try to nickel-and-dime 
our response, they should talk to an 
economist. If they did, they would dis-
cover what will happen if we don’t pass 
this package now. 
We could end up with 4 million fewer 
jobs this year. That is according to 
Moody’s. 
It will take another 4 years of suf-
fering before the GDP returns to its 
prepandemic levels. That is according 
to the nonpartisan CBO. 
Treasury 
Secretary 
Janet 
Yellen 
said: ‘‘The smartest thing we can do is 
to act big. In the long run, the benefits 
will far outweigh the costs.’’ 
Mark Zandi, former adviser to John 
McCain, said: ‘‘You don’t need a text-
book to know this is when you push on 
the fiscal accelerator.’’ 
Now, let’s be clear what we cannot 
afford. We cannot afford more delay 
tactics, another lapse in unemploy-
ment assistance, or another moment of 
inaction. This plan is what our econ-
omy needs, and it is what America 
needs, bold, urgent action. 
So, let’s pass this rule and the under-
lying legislation, and let’s let the Sen-
ate do its job and send this bill to the 
President’s desk without delay. This 
historic crisis deserves a historic re-
sponse. 
The 
American 
people 
are 
counting on us. 
Listening to the Republicans debate 
on the floor and in the Rules Com-
mittee has been a disappointing experi-
ence. Barely, barely a word of empathy 
or compassion for those who are suf-
fering or for those who are struggling. 
What we have heard are delay tac-
tics. What we have heard are distor-
tions. What we have heard is divisive 
talk. 
My friends talk about bailouts. This 
is not a bailout. It is a rescue package. 
My friends are out of touch with the 
American people. 
People are struggling. People right 
now are trying to figure out how they 
are going to put food on the table to 
feed their families. Here on the House 
floor, what we hear is indifference, 
what we hear is distraction. 
The good news is this. We are going 
to pass this bill today. This is a big 
deal. We are going to send it over to 
the United States Senate, and we have 
a Senate that is not going to put this 
in the trash can. It is going to debate 
it and vote on it, and then we are going 
to send it to the President. 
The good news to the American peo-
ple is: Help is on the way. We promised 
you that we would step up to the plate 
and that we would respond appro-
priately to this crisis, and that is what 
we are going to do. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues, Democrats and Republicans, 
to support this rule and to support this 
package. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows:

priations for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2021, providing coronavirus emer-
gency response and relief, and for other pur-
poses. The first reading of the bill shall be 
dispensed with. All points of order against

considered for amendment under the five- 
minute rule. All points of order against pro-
visions in the bill are waived. When the com-

do pass, the previous question shall be con-
sidered as ordered on the bill and amend-
ments thereto to final passage without inter-
vening motion except one motion to recom-
mit. If the Committee of the Whole rises and 
reports that it has come to no resolution on

daily order of business under clause 1 of rule 
XIV, resolve into the Committee of the 
Whole for further consideration of the bill. 
SEC. 2. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not

PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES 
Mr. ROY (during the vote). Madam 
Speaker, I have a parliamentary in-
quiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. ROY. Does the rule regarding 
proxy voting require a form be sub-
mitted and signed by Members of this 
body that they have a pandemic- or 
COVID-related reason for being unable 
to be physically present? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair would advise the gentleman that 
regulation A of the proxy voting regu-
lations issued pursuant to section 3(s) 
of House Resolution 8 requires any let-
ter authorizing proxy voting to contain 
an affirmative statement that because 
of the public health emergency the 
Member is unable to physically attend 
proceedings in the House Chamber. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I have a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. ROY. Would the Chair consider it 
a violation of the rule for a Member to 
be present physically here in the 
Chamber and on the same day vote by 
proxy having submitted said letter? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair does not look behind a Member’s 
submission of a letter under section 
3(s) of House Resolution 8. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I have a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, does the 
Constitution of the United States re-
quire a quorum to be present for votes 
on the House floor? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman is not stating a proper par-
liamentary inquiry. The Chair does not 
interpret the constitutionality of a 
proposition adopted by the House. 
b 2233 
Mr. PALMER changed his vote from 
‘‘yea’’ to ‘‘nay.’’ 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ and Mrs. MURPHY of 
Florida changed their vote from ‘‘nay’’ 
to ‘‘yea.’’ 
So the previous question was ordered. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
Stated for: 
Mr. SWALWELL. Madam Speaker, had I 
been present, I would have voted ‘‘yea’’ on 
rollcall No. 46.

VIOUSLY
ISSUED
PREPAID

retary to make payments to such taxpayers 
under subsection (g) (including the determina-
tion of the amount of such payment) if such in-
formation is not otherwise available to the Sec-
retary, and 
‘‘(2) regulations or other guidance to ensure to 
the maximum extent administratively prac-
ticable that, in determining the amount of any 
credit under subsection (a) and any credit or re-
fund under subsection (g), an individual is not 
taken into account more than once, including 
by different taxpayers and including by reason 
of a change in joint return status or dependent 
status between the taxable year for which an 
advance refund amount is determined and the 
taxable year for which a credit under subsection 
(a) is determined. 
‘‘(i) OUTREACH.—The Secretary shall carry

gram to ensure that all taxpayers described in

‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary shall estab-
lish a program for making periodic payments to 
taxpayers which, in the aggregate during any 
calendar year, equal the annual advance 
amount determined with respect to such tax-
payer for such calendar year. Except as pro-
vided in subsection (b)(3)(B), the periodic pay-
ments made to any taxpayer for any calendar 
year shall be in equal amounts.

ADVANCE
AMOUNT.—For pur-
poses of this section— 
‘‘(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as otherwise pro-
vided in this subsection, the term ‘annual ad-
vance amount’ means, with respect to any tax-
payer for any calendar year, the amount (if 
any) which is estimated by the Secretary as 
being equal to 50 percent of the amount which 
would be treated as allowed under subpart C of 
part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 by reason 
of section 24(i)(1) for the taxpayer’s taxable year 
beginning in such calendar year if— 
‘‘(A) the status of the taxpayer as a taxpayer 
described in section 24(i)(1) is determined with 
respect to the reference taxable year, 
‘‘(B) the taxpayer’s modified adjusted gross 
income for such taxable year is equal to the tax-
payer’s modified adjusted gross income for the 
reference taxable year,

erly claimed on the taxpayer’s return of tax for 
the reference taxable year, and

erence taxable year’ means, with respect to any

‘‘(3) 
MODIFICATIONS
DURING
CALENDAR 
YEAR.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary may modify, 
during any calendar year, the annual advance 
amount with respect to any taxpayer for such 
calendar year to take into account— 
‘‘(i) a return of tax filed by such taxpayer 
during such calendar year (and the taxable year 
to which such return relates may be taken into 
account as the reference taxable year), and 
‘‘(ii) any other information provided by the 
taxpayer to the Secretary which allows the Sec-
retary to determine payments under subsection 
(a) which, in the aggregate during any taxable 
year of the taxpayer, more closely total the Sec-
retary’s estimate of the amount treated as al-
lowed under subpart C of part IV of subchapter 
A of chapter 1 by reason of section 24(i)(1) for 
such taxable year of such taxpayer. 
‘‘(B) ADJUSTMENT TO REFLECT EXCESS OR DEF-
ICIT IN PRIOR PAYMENTS.—In the case of any 
modification of the annual advance amount 
under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may ad-
just the amount of any periodic payment made 
after the date of such modification to properly 
take into account the amount by which any 
periodic payment made before such date was 
greater than or less than the amount that such 
payment would have been on the basis of the 
annual advance amount as so modified. 
‘‘(4) DETERMINATION OF STATUS.—If informa-
tion contained in the taxpayer’s return of tax 
for the reference taxable year does not establish 
the status of the taxpayer as being described in 
section 24(i)(1), the Secretary shall, for purposes 
of paragraph (1)(A), determine such status 
based on information known to the Secretary.

‘‘(j) RECONCILIATION OF CREDIT AND ADVANCE 
CREDIT.—

allowed under this section to any taxpayer for 
any taxable year shall be reduced (but not 
below zero) by the aggregate amount of pay-
ments made under section 7527A to such tax-
payer during such taxable year. Any failure to 
so reduce the credit shall be treated as arising 
out of a mathematical or clerical error and as-
sessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(2) EXCESS ADVANCE PAYMENTS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the aggregate amount of 
payments under section 7527A to the taxpayer 
during the taxable year exceeds the amount of 
the credit allowed under this section to such 
taxpayer for such taxable year (determined 
without regard to paragraph (1)), the tax im-
posed by this chapter for such taxable year shall 
be increased by the amount of such excess. Any 
failure to so increase the tax shall be treated as 
arising out of a mathematical or clerical error 
and assessed according to section 6213(b)(1). 
‘‘(B) SAFE HARBOR BASED ON MODIFIED AD-
JUSTED GROSS INCOME.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—In the case of a taxpayer 
whose modified adjusted gross income (as de-
fined in subsection (b)) for the taxable year does 
not exceed 200 percent of the applicable income 
threshold, the amount of the increase deter-
mined under subparagraph (A) with respect to 
such taxpayer for such taxable year shall be re-
duced (but not below zero) by the safe harbor 
amount. 
‘‘(ii) PHASE OUT OF SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.—In 
the case of a taxpayer whose modified adjusted 
gross income (as defined in subsection (b)) for 
the taxable year exceeds the applicable income 
threshold, the safe harbor amount otherwise in 
effect under clause (i) shall be reduced by the 
amount which bears the same ratio to such 
amount as such excess bears to the applicable 
income threshold. 
‘‘(iii) APPLICABLE
INCOME
THRESHOLD.—For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the term ‘appli-
cable income threshold’ means— 
‘‘(I) $60,000 in the case of a joint return or 
surviving spouse (as defined in section 2(a)), 
‘‘(II) $50,000 in the case of a head of house-
hold, and 
‘‘(III) $40,000 in any other case. 
‘‘(iv) SAFE HARBOR AMOUNT.—For purposes of 
this subparagraph, the term ‘safe harbor 
amount’ means, with respect to any taxable 
year, the product of—

‘‘(II) the excess (if any) of the number of 
qualified children taken into account in deter-
mining the annual advance amount with respect 
to the taxpayer under section 7527A with respect 
to months beginning in such taxable year, over 
the number of qualified children taken into ac-
count in determining the credit allowed under 
this section for such taxable year.’’.

Section 3402(f)(1)(C) of such Code is amended by

‘‘(2) MODIFIED
FUNDED
PERCENTAGE.—For 
purposes of paragraph (1)(C), the term ‘modified 
funded percentage’ means the percentage equal 
to a fraction the numerator of which is current 
value of plan assets (as defined in section 3(26) 
of such Act) and the denominator of which is

liabilities 
(as 
defined 
in 
section 
431(c)(6)(D)

‘‘(c) APPLICATIONS FOR SPECIAL FINANCIAL AS-
SISTANCE.—Within 120 days of the date of enact-
ment of this section, the corporation shall issue 
regulations or guidance setting forth require-
ments for special financial assistance applica-
tions under this section. In such regulations or

‘‘(1) limit the materials required for a special 
financial assistance application to the minimum 
necessary to make a determination on the appli-
cation;

special financial assistance following approval 
of an application, based on the effective date of 
the supporting actuarial analysis and the date 
on which the application is submitted; and 
‘‘(3) provide for an alternate application for 
special financial assistance under this section, 
which may be used by a plan that has been ap-
proved for a partition under section 4233 before 
the date of enactment of this section. 
‘‘(d) TEMPORARY PRIORITY CONSIDERATION OF 
APPLICATIONS.— 
‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The corporation may speci-
fy in regulations or guidance under subsection 
(c) that, during a period no longer than the first 
2 years following the date of enactment of this 
section, applications may not be filed by an eli-
gible multiemployer plan unless— 
‘‘(A) the eligible multiemployer plan is insol-
vent or is likely to become insolvent within 5 
years of the date of enactment of this section; 
‘‘(B) the corporation projects the eligible mul-
tiemployer plan to have a present value of fi-
nancial assistance payments under section 4261 
that exceeds $1,000,000,000 if the special finan-
cial assistance is not ordered; 
‘‘(C) the eligible multiemployer plan has im-
plemented benefit suspensions under section 
305(e)(9) as of the date of the enactment of this 
section; or 
‘‘(D) the corporation determines it appropriate 
based on other similar circumstances. 
‘‘(e) ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) ELIGIBILITY.—For purposes of deter-
mining eligibility for special financial assist-
ance, the corporation shall accept assumptions 
incorporated in a multiemployer plan’s deter-
mination that it is in critical status or critical 
and declining status (within the meaning of sec-
tion 305(b)) for certifications of plan status com-
pleted before January 1, 2021, unless such as-
sumptions are clearly erroneous. For certifi-
cations of plan status completed after December 
31, 2020, a plan shall determine whether it is in 
critical or critical and declining status for pur-
poses of eligibility for special financial assist-
ance by using the assumptions that the plan 
used in its most recently completed certification 
of plan status before January 1, 2021, unless 
such assumptions (excluding the plan’s interest 
rate) are unreasonable. 
‘‘(2) AMOUNT
OF
FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE.—In 
determining the amount of special financial as-
sistance in its application, an eligible multiem-
ployer plan shall— 
‘‘(A) use the interest rate used by the plan in 
its most recently completed certification of plan 
status before January 1, 2021, provided that 
such interest rate may not exceed the interest 
rate limit; and 
‘‘(B) for other assumptions, use the assump-
tions that the plan used in its most recently 
completed certification of plan status before 
January 1, 2021, unless such assumptions are 
unreasonable. 
‘‘(3) INTEREST RATE.—The interest rate limit 
for purposes of this subsection is the rate speci-
fied in section 303(h)(2)(C)(iii) (disregarding 
modifications made under clause (iv) of such 
section) for the month in which the application 
for special financial assistance is filed by the el-
igible multiemployer plan or the 3 preceding 
months, with such specified rate increased by 
200 basis points. 
‘‘(4) CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS.—If a plan de-
termines that use of one or more prior assump-
tions is unreasonable, the plan may propose in 
its application to change such assumptions, pro-
vided that the plan discloses such changes in its 
application and describes why such assumptions 
are no longer reasonable. The corporation shall 
accept such changed assumptions unless it de-
termines the changes are unreasonable, individ-
ually or in the aggregate. The plan may not 
propose a change to the interest rate otherwise 
required under this subsection for eligibility or 
financial assistance amount. 
‘‘(f) APPLICATION DEADLINE.—Any application 
by a plan for special financial assistance under 
this section shall be submitted to the corporation 
(and, in the case of a plan to which section 
432(k)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 applies, to the Secretary of the Treasury) 
no later than December 31, 2025, and any re-
vised application for special financial assistance 
shall be submitted no later than December 31, 
2026. 
‘‘(g) DETERMINATIONS
ON
APPLICATIONS.—A 
plan’s application for special financial assist-
ance under this section that is timely filed in ac-
cordance with the regulations or guidance 
issued under subsection (c) shall be deemed ap-
proved unless the corporation notifies the plan 
within 120 days of the filing of the application 
that the application is incomplete, any proposed 
change or assumption is unreasonable, or the 
plan is not eligible under this section. Such no-
tice shall specify the reasons the plan is ineli-
gible for special financial assistance, any pro-
posed change or assumption is unreasonable, or 
information is needed to complete the applica-
tion. If a plan is denied assistance under this 
subsection, the plan may submit a revised appli-
cation under this section. Any revised applica-
tion for special financial assistance submitted 
by a plan shall be deemed approved unless the 
corporation notifies the plan within 120 days of 
the filing of the revised application that the ap-
plication is incomplete, any proposed change or 
assumption is unreasonable, or the plan is not 
eligible under this section. Special financial as-
sistance issued by the corporation shall be effec-
tive on a date determined by the corporation, 
but no later than 1 year after a plan’s special fi-
nancial assistance application is approved by 
the corporation or deemed approved. The cor-
poration shall not pay any special financial as-
sistance after September 30, 2030. 
‘‘(h) MANNER
OF
PAYMENT.—The payment 
made by the corporation to an eligible multiem-
ployer plan under this section shall be made as 
a single, lump sum payment. 
‘‘(i) AMOUNT AND MANNER OF SPECIAL FINAN-
CIAL ASSISTANCE.—

under this section shall be a transfer of funds in 
the amount necessary as demonstrated by the

as soon as practicable upon approval of the ap-
plication by the corporation.

granted by the corporation under this section 
shall not be capped by the guarantee under 
4022A.

assistance provided to a multiemployer plan eli-
gible for financial assistance under this section

pay all benefits due during the period beginning 
on the date of payment of the special financial 
assistance payment under this section and end-
ing on the last day of the plan year ending in 
2051, with no reduction in a participant’s or 
beneficiary’s accrued benefit as of the date of 
enactment of this section, except to the extent of 
a reduction in accordance with section 305(e)(8) 
adopted prior to the plan’s application for spe-
cial financial assistance under this section, and 
taking into account the reinstatement of bene-
fits required under subsection (k).

retary of the Treasury pursuant to section 
432(k)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, effective as of the first month in which the 
effective date for the special financial assistance 
occurs, for participants and beneficiaries as of 
such month; and 
‘‘(2) provides payments equal to the amount of 
benefits previously suspended under section 
305(e)(9) or 4245(a) to any participants or bene-
ficiaries in pay status as of the effective date of 
the special financial assistance, payable, as de-
termined by the eligible multiemployer plan— 
‘‘(A) as a lump sum within 3 months of such 
effective date; or 
‘‘(B) in equal monthly installments over a pe-
riod of 5 years, commencing within 3 months of 
such effective date, with no adjustment for in-
terest. 
‘‘(l) WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY.—An employer’s 
withdrawal liability for purposes of this title 
shall be calculated without taking into account 
special financial assistance received under this 
section until the plan year beginning 15 cal-
endar years after the effective date of the spe-
cial financial assistance. 
‘‘(m) REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.—An eligible plan 
that receives special financial assistance under 
this section shall provide to the corporation, the 
Secretary of the Treasury, each employer that 
has an obligation to contribute to such plan, 
and each labor organization representing par-
ticipants employed by such employer, an esti-

ment-grade bonds or other investments as per-

Missouri (Mr. SMITH), the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL), and 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY), 
each will control 15 minutes. 
The Chair now recognizes the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. YARMUTH). 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude 
extraneous 
material 
in 
the 
RECORD on H.R. 1319. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Kentucky? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, on Monday our Nation 
crossed an unfathomable milestone. 
More than half a million Americans 
have now died from the coronavirus. 
On top of this staggering level of loss is 
the reality that the virus is evolving, 
and we are now dealing with variants 
that are more contagious and highly 
infectious for both adults and children. 
At the same time, our Nation faces a 
painful and unequal recession, one 
from which we cannot fully recover 
until the coronavirus is contained. 
The resources Congress provided last 
year have been put to good use, but 
they are not enough. Vaccines can stop 
this virus, but we don’t have the re-
sources or infrastructure to get them 
out fast enough. Food banks are still 
overwhelmed, and rental assistance is 
running out. Unemployment benefits 
for millions of Americans will start to 
expire in just a few days. And more and 
more small businesses are closing their 
doors for good each day. 
We are in a race against time and the 
American people are counting on us 
and the American Rescue Plan. 
This plan is tailored and targeted. It 
will address the urgent needs of the 
American people: beating the virus, 
quickly and equitably distributing vac-
cines, safely reopening schools, deliv-
ering immediate relief to working fam-
ilies, and helping cities and States 
keep essential workers on the job and 
critical services up and running. 
The American people are painfully 
aware of the challenges we face, and 
that is why the majority of them, the 
vast majority of them, Democrats, Re-
publicans, and Independents support 
this relief package. 
If you don’t think Congress has more 
work to do here, then you either don’t 
get what American families are going 
through, or you don’t care. I don’t 
know how else to say it. 
Relief cannot wait, and we aren’t 
going to wait. We are going to pass this 
legislation today, and we are going to 
provide the aggressive, bold action 
needed to finally end this pandemic 
and rebuild our economy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, I thank 
him for his leadership as chair of the 
Budget Committee, to him and all of 
the members of his committee and the 
staff who worked so hard to bring this 
to the floor. 
Thank you to Mr. NEAL
and the 
members of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee and their staff. Thank you also 
for bringing your piece of this legisla-
tion to the floor. And Mr. MCGOVERN 
and the Rules Committee and his mem-
bers, and the staff members of all the 
committees. 
All of the chairs of the committees 
have worked so hard. All of their mem-
bers, all of the staff to bring this to 
this very important moment for our 
country. 
As the distinguished gentleman from 
Kentucky acknowledged in his opening 
sentence, this week, on Monday, our 
Nation marked the loss of over 500,000 
Americans to the coronavirus, a hor-
rific human toll of staggering propor-
tions, an incomprehensible sadness. 
Every life lost is a profound tragedy 
that we mourn, and that breaks Amer-
ica’s heart, and we pray for their fami-
lies. 
Each day this pandemic reaches into 
our communities, devastating families’ 
health, financial security, and well- 
being. The numbers speak volumes: 18 
million Americans are on unemploy-
ment; 24 million people are going hun-
gry; 12 million, Mr. Speaker; 12 million 
children living in households with food 
insecurity—and that is a conservative 
number—up to 40 million people cannot 
pay their rent and fear eviction. 
The writer, George Bernard Shaw, 
said, ‘‘It is the mark of a truly intel-
ligent person to be moved by statis-
tics.’’ And indeed, we are moved emo-
tionally 
and 
intellectually 
because 
these statistics are not just numbers, 
they are the lives and livelihoods of 
our 
neighbors, 
family 
members, 
friends, and loved ones. 
We moved to act swiftly to put an 
end to this pandemic and to stem the 
suffering felt by so many. The time for 
decisive action is long overdue. Presi-
dent Biden’s American Rescue Plan is 
that decisive action. 
Tonight, Congress is taking action to 
crush the virus with a national vac-
cination program, robust testing, trac-
ing and treatment, more PPE, and 
combating health disparities affecting 
communities of color disproportion-
ately. 
We are putting money in workers’ 
pockets: 18 million Americans will re-
ceive unemployment insurance; 40 mil-
lion Americans will receive nutrition 
assistance; 27 million children will re-
ceive help through an expanded child 
tax credit; 15 million low-wage workers 
will receive an earned income tax cred-
it; and millions and millions of other 
people, in addition, will receive the di-
rect payments. 
We are putting children safely back 
in schools with $130 billion investment 
in reopening schools and making up for 
lost learning, and to do so safely. 
And we are putting people back into 
jobs by supporting our most vulnerable 
small businesses, particularly those 
owned by minorities and women, and 
protecting the jobs of our heroes, 
healthcare workers, transit, sanita-
tion, food workers, police and fire, our 
first responders, our teachers, our 
teachers, our teachers, and more. 
Economists overwhelmingly support 
this targeted action. 
b 2330 
Earlier this month, Federal Reserve 
Chairman Jerome Powell reported that 
the real unemployment rate is 10 per-
cent, matching the depths of the worst 
point of the Great Recession. As he 
said: We are still very far from a strong 
labor market whose benefits are broad-
ly shared. 
Therefore, if we do not enact this 
package, the results could be cata-
strophic: depriving workers and the 
economy of 4 million fewer jobs to 
come back; taking a year longer to re-
turn to full employment, and 4 years 
longer until real GDP recovers to a 
pre-pandemic status; confronting the 
entire cohort of young people with 
lower lifetime earnings; reducing the 
wages and job prospects of parents 
forced to stay at home. 
This legislation is transformative: 
lifting 12 million Americans out of pov-
erty and generating $1.25 for every dol-
lar spent. And—a great source of pride 
for us all—this legislation will cut 
child poverty in half. 
As we advance this legislation, we 
will continue our fight for 15, which 
will give 27 million Americans a raise. 
When I was Speaker in 2007, congres-
sional Democrats raised the minimum 
wage in the first 100 hours of our new 
majority. It took a little longer for the 
Senate to get it done in the spring. 
That was 14 years ago. 
An increase in the minimum wage is 
a financial necessity for our families, a 
great stimulus for our economy, and a 
moral imperative for our country. With 
that view, it is therefore inevitable to 
all of us that the $15 minimum wage 
will be achieved. Even if it is incon-
ceivable to some, it is inevitable to us, 
and we will work diligently to shorten 
the distance between the inevitable 
and the inconceivable. 
The $7.25 minimum wage that exists 
now is, in many instances, an exploi-
tation of American workers. It is a cost 
to taxpayers because minimum wage 
workers need food and housing assist-
ance, and many are on Medicaid. This 
is corporate welfare. This is a subsidy 
for business to pay a low wage. We 
want work to be respected, and we re-
spect the dignity of work. We will seek 
a solution consistent with the Senate 
rules, and we will do so soon. 
The American people are demanding 
the bold action contained in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. Over 75 percent of 
Americans support this package and 
want it passed and enacted, including 
60 percent of Republicans in the coun-
try. Families, workers, business lead-
ers, mayors and local leaders, and 
health and faith-based organizations 
are all calling for immediate action.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H837 
February 26, 2021 
More than 1 year ago into this pan-
demic and economic crisis, the Amer-
ican people need to know that their 
government is there for them and that, 
as President Biden has said, help is on 
the way. 
With that, I thank again the chairs 
and members of the committee, the 
staff, and all of our Members for their 
attention to the issue of morality to 
our country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a strong and bi-
partisan vote for the American Rescue 
Plan so we can continue our work to 
save lives and the livelihoods of the 
American people. I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
We are here today because Wash-
ington Democrats have gotten together 
and decided to use a global pandemic 
as an excuse to check a few items off 
their progressive wish list. They want 
to reward their political allies at the 
expense of America’s working class. 
If this bailout is about crushing the 
virus, then why does less than 9 per-
cent actually go towards putting shots 
in people’s arms? 
If this bailout is about quickly re-
opening our schools, then why is less 
than 5 percent of the money for schools 
going to be spent this year? 
If this bailout is about helping work-
ers and families, then why does this 
plan continue to incentivize Governors 
to keep small businesses shut down? 
Why does 25 percent of all spending 
go towards policies that will kill jobs 
and reduce hours worked? 
Simply put, this is the wrong plan at 
the wrong time for all the wrong rea-
sons. It is the wrong plan because 
Americans living on fixed incomes, in-
cluding 31 million seniors who are on 
fixed Social Security, will be forced to 
pay more out of pocket to buy food, 
put clothes on their backs, and to keep 
the lights on. Seniors will now have to 
decide to turn on heat or pay for the 
needed medication. 
It is the wrong time because Demo-
cratic economists and the Congres-
sional Budget Office are warning that 
this spending isn’t needed and that, by 
the middle of the year, our real GDP 
will have recovered and we will have 
our largest economic growth in 15 
years. 
It is the wrong time because when 
you combine this bill with the COVID– 
19 money that has already been en-
acted, the sum is more than the GDP of 
every country in the world except 
China and the United States, and $1 
trillion of already enacted spending 
still remains. 
So what is the reason for this bail-
out? 
It is all about rewarding political al-
lies and bailouts to blue States. Demo-
crats even changed the funding formula 
to reward States that severely lock 
down their citizens and boarded up 
Main Street. 
Using a pandemic to push things like 
the $15 Washington mandate, an expan-
sion of ObamaCare, and billions on po-
litical payouts around this country is 
the real reason for this bailout. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle to look be-
yond their agenda and think about the 
working class. They want the schools 
reopened, to be able to go back to 
work, vaccines to keep their families 
safe, and end to this pandemic. All of 
that can happen without this bailout 
plan if we focus on what the American 
people need and not what one political 
party desperately wants. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCARTHY), who will be the next 
Speaker of the House. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank him for his work as the rank-
ing member on the Budget Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, I am about to say some-
thing that the American people don’t 
want to hear: the swamp is back. 
Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: The 
swamp is back. 
Every day since January 20, the 
Democrats have sided with their spe-
cial interest allies and ignored the real 
needs of the American people. The re-
sult is the bill before us today—or I 
should say tomorrow. 
Congress won’t actually vote on this 
bill until about 2 a.m. Saturday morn-
ing. 
Why? 
Because Democrats are so embar-
rassed by all the non-COVID waste in 
this bill, they are jamming it through 
in the dead of night. 
We ran the numbers. The amount of 
money that actually goes to defeating 
the virus is less than 9 percent. So 
don’t call it a rescue bill and don’t call 
it a relief bill. If you are a friend of the 
Speaker, you do pretty well under this 
bill. But for the American people, it is 
a loser. 
Let’s consider Medicare. Tonight, the 
CBO confirmed that this bill will cost 
$36 billion in cuts to Medicare starting 
this year. If Members vote for this bill, 
I want them to go back to their dis-
tricts and look the seniors in the eye 
and look at the hospitals, those who 
have been working night and day, and 
tell them why you voted to cut their 
health benefits. 
Or consider the blue State bailout. 
This bill calls for States and local gov-
ernments to receive $350 billion. Most 
States are not in financial distress. 
Nearly half saw an increase in their 
revenue last year, and some—even in-
cluding my home State of California, 
and the Speaker’s as well—actually 
have a budget surplus. But none of that 
money is tied to reopening. 
Or consider elite institutions, Har-
vard and others. This bill calls for 
them to receive hundreds of millions of 
dollars, but Harvard already has a $40 
billion endowment. 
b 2340 
Compare that to K–12 education. This 
bill allocates only $6 billion to help re-
open American schools in fiscal year 
2021. More than two-thirds of the edu-
cation funding would not be spent until 
2023 or later. 
Almost every one of this bill’s 592 
pages includes a liberal pipe dream 
that predates the pandemic. Let’s 
check the fine print. 
On page 97, for those of you who have 
not read it, it hands out healthcare 
subsidies to illegal immigrants. 
On page 347, it fast-tracks $1.5 billion 
to Amtrak. Now, Amtrak has $1.5 bil-
lion from the last package they haven’t 
even spent. 
On page 306, it gives Federal employ-
ees up to an extra $21,000 to help cope 
with virtual schooling. Let me read 
that so every American understands: If 
you are a Federal employee, you get an 
extra $21,000 to cope with virtual 
schooling. There are a lot of Federal 
employees who are going to vote for 
this bill tonight. But if you are one of 
the millions of parents outside of 
Washington, outside of the swamp, who 
are struggling through school closures, 
including the 1 million mothers who 
had to quit their jobs to take care of 
their kids at home with school, and the 
fathers that quit, you are ignored. 
On page 358, it funnels—earlier, it 
funneled less, just a little over $100 
million. But last night, the Rules Com-
mittee was able to add more, up to $140 
million for a subway tunnel near 
Speaker PELOSI’s district. 
When you add it all up, the size of 
this payoff is jaw-dropping: $1.9 trillion 
in new spending. It is the single most 
expensive spending bill ever. 
But will it help people get back to 
work? No. Will it help students get 
back in the classroom immediately? 
No. Will it help get vaccines to those 
who want it? The answer is no. 
It doesn’t spend a third of the entire 
cost of the bill for another 2 years, un-
dermining the claim that this bill is so 
urgent. This money won’t be spent for 
another 2 years. 
It doesn’t have any guardrails to pro-
tect against fraud, which has already 
cost taxpayers tens of billions of dol-
lars, including especially in California. 
It just throws out money without ac-
countability, even though we have over 
$1 trillion unspent from the last bill. 
President Biden promised unity, but 
Democrats are delivering one-party 
rule. 
Mr. Speaker, based on the facts, the 
Democrats’ spending bill is too costly, 
too corrupt, and just too liberal for 
this country. 
To my colleagues who say this bill is 
bold, I say it is bloated. To those who 
say it is urgent, I say it is unfocused. 
To those who say it is popular, I say it 
is entirely partisan and has the wrong 
priorities. 
Republicans will support whatever is 
needed to get America back to work, 
back to school, and back to health. 
After 12 months of struggling, suf-
fering, and sacrificing, that is what 
Americans want, what they need, and 
what they deserve.

That is why Republicans will intro-
duce a motion to recommit to bolster 
the resources that families can access 
to help their children cope with the 
emotional stress of school closures. 
And it won’t be for parents who just 
work for the Federal Government. It 
will be for all American parents. 
In every single district, if you watch, 
the anxiety and the fear for children 
have risen, the 3 million children that 
now mark a year that they have not 
been in the classroom. Our proposal 
would shift the $140 million from 
Speaker PELOSI’s subway to grants 
that would be used for mental health 
services for children. It puts children 
first, not the swamp. 
Democrats have conveniently ignored 
the education and mental health crisis 
affecting our children, but failing to 
address it is unacceptable. Families de-
serve answers. Tonight, they will fi-
nally get them. 
Our colleagues, it is a very clear and 
concise question you have before you. 
If you vote for the bill, you are cutting 
Medicare, you are cutting your hos-
pitals, you are cutting your health pro-
viders with your vote. 
If you vote against the motion to re-
commit, which you changed, you are 
picking $140 million that you just 
added last night to a subway tunnel 
just outside of the Speaker’s district. 
So, who do you pick? All American 
parents, to give them the grants and 
the resources they need to cope with 
their children’s anxiety, the rise of sui-
cide, and their mental health; or do 
you think that subway is really appro-
priate, right here, right now? 
Make a decision. Is the swamp back, 
or do hardworking American taxpayers 
come first? It is an easy question. It is 
easy for me to decide, and I think it is 
easy for America to decide as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. HIGGINS), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, the American Rescue Plan is 
bold action needed to meet this defin-
ing moment. 
Seventy-six percent of Americans are 
rooting for its passage: direct pay-
ments to Americans; help for teachers 
and students, to return both of them to 
the classroom; help for neighborhood 
restaurants to reopen and to recover; 
help for local and State governments; 
and billions for vaccine making and 
distribution. 
Wall Street or Main Street has al-
ways been a false choice. This is about 
the 
neighborhood 
streets 
and 
the 
homes where real families live and 
struggle every day to give their kids a 
fighting chance. 
Mr. Speaker, give their kids a fight-
ing chance. Let the recovery begin. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I will remind the gentleman from New 
York, if this bill is enacted, his State’s 
3 million seniors will face a cut to 
Medicare of $27 billion over the next 10 
years. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, to 
my fellow Americans, all of this free 
money is coming out of your future 
earnings. 
Divided by U.S. households, $1.9 tril-
lion comes to roughly $15,000 for an av-
erage family. You will pay that back 
through your future taxes and inflation 
and through higher prices and lower 
wages as businesses pass along their 
taxes. 
You won’t see it all directly, but you 
will feel it. It is the car you won’t be 
able to afford someday soon or the 
home you won’t be able to qualify for. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. CHU), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
b 2350 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
strong support of the American Rescue 
Plan. 
This bill provides security to families 
with $1,400 survival checks. It provides 
relief to the unemployed, increasing 
their insurance to $400 a week. It ex-
pands loans to small businesses to help 
them stay open. And, most impor-
tantly, it improves the distribution of 
vaccines and PPE, and expands afford-
able healthcare coverage so we can 
stop the terrible deaths that have oc-
curred, saving people’s lives. 
One year into this crisis, we are be-
ginning to see the light at the end of 
the tunnel, thanks to the approval of 
vaccines. But we still have months to 
go before we return to normal. That 
means more months of anxiety for fam-
ilies, businesses, and healthcare pro-
viders, all already stretched to the 
max. That is why today we must send 
urgently needed aid directly to Ameri-
cans as quickly as possible. 
This bill is too important to delay 
any longer. We must pass this aid 
today. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentlewoman from 
California. I would just like to point 
out that, out of her 6 million seniors, 
this bill will cut $44 billion from Medi-
care over the next 10 years—10 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. CARTER). 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in opposition of the rec-
onciliation package we have before us 
today. My colleagues and I have been 
saying it for weeks, but I will say it 
again. This package is simply the 
wrong plan at the wrong time for the 
wrong reasons. 
It is the wrong plan because it will 
incentivize 
lockdowns 
that 
have 
harmed our workers and our children 
for way too long. 
It is the wrong time because our 
economy is improving, and we have yet 
to spend a trillion dollars of the pre-
viously approved funding. In fact, just 
this week it was reported that jobless 
claims dropped dramatically. 
Lastly, and worst of all, it is being 
pushed by colleagues across the aisle 
for the wrong reasons. Less than 9 per-
cent of this $2 trillion goes to combat 
COVID–19. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
consider these implications. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE), an-
other distinguished member from the 
Budget Committee. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsyl-
vania. Mr. Speaker, after 12 months of 
death and despair, the American recov-
ery begins tonight. Mr. Speaker, this is 
a big and bold plan, one of the largest 
bills in the history of Congress. It is 
exactly the sort of bold plan that is 
needed to meet the crisis of this mo-
ment. 
And unlike some on the other side, 
the American people understand it. 
That is why this plan is more popular 
than any economic package in my life-
time. A majority of Democrats, a ma-
jority of Independents, and even a ma-
jority of Republicans support this plan. 
Mr. Speaker, the time to act is now. 
Let us begin the great American recov-
ery and pass this plan. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I appreciate the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania. I will remind him that if this 
bill were enacted, his State’s 2.7 mil-
lion seniors would face a $17 billion cut 
in Medicare over the next 10 years. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Mr. Speaker, Ameri-
cans are crying out tonight for tar-
geted relief; and, instead, this bill 
sends 
money 
straight 
to 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s pet project in California, the 
Bay Area Rapid Transit Silicon Valley 
phase 2. 
How insulting to the frontline work-
ers who still have not received a 
COVID–19 vaccine, and to the mom try-
ing to pay rent while her small busi-
ness is in danger. And what about the 
ER docs and nurses treating kids 
rushed in for a mental health crisis? 
This is Washington pork spending at 
its worst, the kind the Speaker puts in 
for herself. 
My amendment tonight would take 
away the Speaker’s $140 million sub-
way carve-out and instead redirect 
that money to a truly essential cause: 
Supporting mental health programs for 
students. 
We have seen increasing rates of de-
pression, anxiety, and other mental 
health challenges among our kids, who 
have been trapped behind screens for a 
year now. If we adopt the motion to re-
commit tonight, we will instruct the 
Budget Committee to reconsider my 
amendment, which would put students 
over subways and reject this $140 mil-
lion Speaker set-aside in favor of get-
ting kids the mental health help they 
need right now, before it is too late. 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous con-
sent to include in the RECORD the text

of my amendment immediately prior 
to the vote on the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Iowa? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL), a distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
memory of the 500,000 lives lost from 
COVID. 
I rise for the 24 million Americans 
going hungry, 40 million Americans 
struggling to stay in their homes, and 
more than 8 million families who have 
been pushed into poverty. 
I rise to support survival checks that 
put money in the pockets of tens of 
millions of poor and working people so 
that they can withstand this dev-
astating crisis. 
I rise to support childcare providers 
and housing assistance, small business 
relief, unemployment assistance, and 
tax credits for children so families can 
have hope again. 
I rise to support a pay raise to $15 an 
hour for 27 million workers across this 
country who so desperately need our 
help, lifting 1 million people out of 
poverty and strengthening all of our 
communities. 
Tonight I vote ‘‘yes’’ on this Amer-
ican rescue package. America, know 
that help is on the way. We are with 
you, and we will get through this to-
gether. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman 
from Wisconsin (Mr. GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, three 
things before you print another $1.9 
trillion in this bill. If you look at the 
monetary supply in the last year, M1 is 
up 67 percent and M2 is up 25 percent. 
You are inviting inflation big time. 
Secondly, I have got one local official 
who asked me for a million bucks. He 
is getting $21 million. Another one is 
asking me for $800,000. He is getting $20 
million. Ask your local people if they 
need all this money. 
Third, I wouldn’t even take it to the 
Senate because there is no way you can 
spend all this money. I would put some 
of this in infrastructure, just as a tip. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Ne-
vada (Mr. HORSFORD), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the working families who 
are counting on Congress to pass this 
American Rescue Plan. America is 
strong. American families are resilient, 
and American families are counting on 
this body to do its job. 
Earlier this week, Morning Consult 
and Politico released polling showing 
that the American Rescue Plan earns 
support from 76 percent of Americans, 
including 60 percent of Republicans. 
For months, my Republican col-
leagues have waged a campaign of mis-
information 
against 
the 
new 
coronavirus relief package, but the 
American people know the toll that 
this pandemic has taken, and they are 
united around the need for this bill to 
pass. 
This bill will invest millions in pub-
lic health to make sure every commu-
nity gets the COVID–19 vaccine. It will 
deliver $1,400 stimulus checks to most 
Americans, following up on the $600 
payment we made last December. It 
will extend the employee retention tax 
credit to keep workers on payroll and 
create new jobs. It will provide critical 
assistance to frontline workers, strug-
gling families, and the communities 
that have been hardest hit by this pan-
demic. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. HORSFORD. I am proud to cast 
my vote and to listen to my constitu-
ents. 
Ranking member, please do not talk 
about the seniors in my district. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to heed the gavel. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE). 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong opposition to this bill because 
we should be here tonight focused on 
real priorities of the American people, 
and that should be number one. Re-
opening our schools now. Mr. Speaker, 
we should be focused on helping our 
small businesses, who are dying on the 
vine. Mr. Speaker, we should be focused 
on helping put more vaccination shots 
in the arms of Americans. Unfortu-
nately, that is not what this bill does. 
You are talking about over a trillion 
dollars that is still available from pre-
vious bipartisan bills that is out there. 
b 0000 
There are tens of billions of dollars 
to reopen schools that are available 
today that are not being used. We had 
amendments to say, any new money in 
this bill for schools is tied to reopening 
schools. 
Do you know that every Democrat 
voted against that amendment? 
In fact, if you look at some of the 
spending in this bill that has nothing 
to do with COVID, $350 billion to bail 
out failed states. California gets over 
$40 billion in this bill when they just 
announced they had a $10 billion sur-
plus. In fact, California is going to be 
getting a subway for the bay area—$112 
million. 
Mr. Speaker, I say we defund BART 
and give that money to those students 
right now who are being held back 
from going to school, who have mental 
health 
issues. 
That 
is 
what 
Mrs. 
HINSON’s amendment will do. 
Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit 
actually focuses on helping kids. We 
are holding our kids back. This bill will 
actually delay reopening of schools; 95 
percent of the school money in this bill 
can’t even be spent until 2022. Our kids 
can’t wait. We ought to be focused on 
helping families, on helping businesses, 
on reopening schools, and more vac-
cines. 
If this bill did those things, they 
wouldn’t be bringing it up at midnight 
on a Friday night. This bill ought to be 
in full public view. You don’t pass this 
bill to find out what is in it. We need 
to defeat this bill and help families. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), a distinguished 
member of the Budget Committee. 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the American 
Rescue Plan. I thank Chairman YAR-
MUTH, our Speaker, our committee 
chairs, for addressing this emergency 
urgently. 
People across America are strug-
gling. Yes, this package is big, but the 
scale of the challenges that families 
face is enormous. They need our help, 
and half measures just won’t cut it. We 
cannot wait. 
This bill extends expiring unemploy-
ment benefits, provides $1,400 pay-
ments, permanently expands the child 
tax credit to $3,000 per child, and raises 
the minimum wage, way long overdue. 
And, yes, it provides State and local 
funding to protect the jobs of essential 
workers, who, in spite of the risk that 
they face, provide essential services to 
keep this country running. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill also fights the 
virus with funding for testing and vac-
cinations for communities of color that 
have been hit the hardest from COVID. 
Finally, this bill funds our global 
pandemic response. COVID doesn’t re-
spect borders. A global pandemic re-
quires a global response. 
I thank Chairman MEEKS
of the 
House Committee on Foreign Affairs 
for working with me to ensure that 
America will play its role to help fight 
the pandemic abroad. 
Let’s take this bold action and pass 
this bill tonight. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY). 
Mr. MCHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend from Missouri, the good 
ranking member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. Speaker, we, as politicians, are 
talking down our economy specifically 
to pass this spending package. To be 
clear, we know many Americans are 
still suffering. Republicans want to 
provide targeted relief to those in 
need—temporary, targeted relief re-
lated to COVID. In fact, for a year now, 
we have been working to support fami-
lies impacted by COVID, and we have 
done so in an overwhelmingly bipar-
tisan way. 
Mr. Speaker, now the Democrats 
have power and they are not interested 
in bipartisanship—no matter what the 
campaign pledges were—or even basic 
facts. The fact is that CBO projects 
that the unemployment rate, which is 
lower right now than it was in the first

51⁄2 years of President Obama’s Presi-
dency, will continue to fall even with-
out congressional action and reach its 
pre-pandemic size by next year. 
Additionally, personal income in-
creased at the end of last year, and the 
report out of the Bureau of Labor Sta-
tistics today says personal savings 
rates are now over 20 percent, a level 
not seen in four decades. But these are 
facts that don’t back up the Demo-
crats’ preferred narrative, that the 
economy is horrible, and this big, 
spending package is their solution. 
Democrats are distorting the truth 
to push through a package that dedi-
cates only 9 percent of the $1.9 trillion 
price tag of this bill to actually com-
bating the virus. 
Mr. Speaker, let’s reject this pack-
age. Let’s get American people back to 
work. Let’s get schools open. Let’s get 
parents back at work. Let’s get women 
back in the workforce. And we can do 
that with bipartisan solutions, not a 
big spending package. 
Let’s reject this. Let’s start over and 
get to good terms so we can actually 
fix the problems for the American peo-
ple, get them working again, get 
schools open, and beat the virus. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. PETERS), another distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding me the time. 
Mr. Speaker, like many, my district 
has been hit hard by this pandemic. 
The virus has claimed the lives of 3,200 
San Diegans. Nine out of ten small 
businesses in the region report suf-
fering in the face of COVID-related clo-
sures. 
I am voting to send this bill to the 
Senate because this plan will safely re-
open schools, get vaccines in arms, and 
help people get back to work and the 
economy back on track. And the bill 
allows States and localities to provide 
financial relief to our Nation’s ports, 
like the Port of San Diego, which ex-
pects a loss this year of over $98 mil-
lion. 
Still, I remain concerned about the 
targeting and accountability around 
some of the funding, so I am urging the 
Senate to make some comments and 
some improvements: Extend the dura-
tion of unemployment payments, ideal-
ly with automatic triggers; adjust the 
amount of timing of State aid based on 
real revenue shortfall resulting from 
COVID; and expand funding for indus-
tries bearing the brunt of this crisis, 
like small restaurants, public attrac-
tions, and live entertainment. 
Mr. Speaker, I am voting ‘‘yes’’ be-
cause this is a good start. We have to 
keep it on track, but there is more 
work to do. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from Kentucky (Mr. COMER). 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, this bill 
isn’t about COVID. It isn’t about pro-
viding relief to struggling Americans. 
This massive $1.9 trillion spending bill 
is about checking boxes with Democrat 
donors, political allies, and left-wing 
special interest groups. 
This bill pushes out $350 billion to 
bail out poorly managed, locked-down 
blue States, even though tens of bil-
lions of taxpayer dollars already pro-
vided to them remain unspent. It 
pushes this money out without guard-
rails, without strings attached, with-
out certifications of need or accounting 
requirements. They are irresponsibly 
and recklessly spending hard-earned 
American taxpayer dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, the Republicans on my 
committee 
offered 
comments 
and 
amendments to make these dollars less 
vulnerable to waste, fraud, and abuse; 
amendments 
that 
targeted 
actual 
COVID–19 relief that were tied to im-
portant 
policies, 
like 
reopening 
schools, businesses, and communities. 
These amendments protected against 
bailing out underfunded public em-
ployee pension plans. They made sure 
funds were shared equitably with small 
and rural localities. These amendments 
prioritized the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, my Democrat counter-
parts on the Committee on Oversight 
and Reform refused to adopt a single 
one of these amendments. They refused 
to engage in any meaningful debate. 
Why? 
Because they don’t want the Amer-
ican people to see where this money is 
going. Because, sadly, it isn’t going to 
help them. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SIRES), another distin-
guished member of the Budget Com-
mittee. 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairman for his leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in sup-
port of this much-needed relief pack-
age. The American Rescue Plan will 
help millions of people who are strug-
gling in every community in our Na-
tion as a result of the pandemic. It 
sends direct aid to those who need it 
most, boosts vaccination efforts, pro-
vides a lifeline for small businesses, 
helps kids get back to school safely, 
and much more. 
As many of my colleagues have men-
tioned, the American people—Demo-
crats and Republicans alike—support 
this critical aid. I hope that my col-
leagues will join me in passing this im-
portant bill and sending relief to those 
who need it. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, it is fascinating to 
stand here at almost 10 minutes after 
midnight and debate this bill and have 
our Republican colleagues say, ‘‘There 
has been no debate on this bill.’’ In 
fact, there has been more than 100 
hours of debate on this bill in commit-
tees. There have been hundreds of 
amendments proposed, most by Repub-
licans. 
b 0010 
Mr. Speaker, the reason we are here 
so late tonight is because Republicans 
proposed hundreds of those amend-
ments today in the Rules Committee, 
amendments that had already been de-
bated and discussed in the various com-
mittees. 
This bill has had extensive discus-
sion, and unfortunately, part of this 
discussion has been a misrepresenta-
tion of much of what it does. We hear 
constantly this figure of $1 trillion out 
there that has not been spent. We tried 
to track that trillion dollars down. We 
can’t find it anywhere. 
What we do know is that all the 
money that has been allocated and de-
ployed by prior relief measures is in 
the pipeline, has been allocated, has 
been assigned, has been obligated. 
There is no money wasted in this legis-
lation. 
Also, what we know is that about 85 
percent of the adults in every one of 
the speakers’ districts, Democrat and 
Republican, will get $1,400 to help them 
make it through this desperate econ-
omy that we have been seeing. Every 
child will be granted a tax credit of 
$3,000. A family of four, for instance, 
will get $5,600, plus the tax credits. 
That is in everybody’s district. 
As the minority leader said, we can 
talk about a swamp. I think he has 
been swimming in a swamp for about 4 
years. 
Unfortunately, 
he 
needs 
to 
knock his head and knock some of that 
water out of his ears because he needs 
to stand on the Earth that we all oc-
cupy, the country that we occupy, and 
understand the pain and the suffering 
that the American people have been 
going through and for whom this bill is 
so essential. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, a recent letter from the 
Congressional Budget Office shows that 
if this bailout plan is enacted, the 
Medicare benefits for seniors will be 
cut by $36 million starting in fiscal 
year 2022 and every year for the next 10 
years. 
I include in the RECORD a letter that 
confirms the American Rescue Plan 
Act of 2021 will cause billions of dollars 
of cuts to Medicare.

February 26, 2021 
that the legislation would increase deficits 
by $1.9 trillion over the 2021–2031 period. 
Under statutory PAYGO, the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) is required 
to maintain 5- and 10-year scorecards that 
report the estimated cumulative changes in 
revenues and outlays generated by new legis-
lation. If either scorecard indicates a net in-
crease in the deficit, OMB is required to 
order a sequestration to eliminate the over-
age. The balance used to determine the 
amount of a sequestration is not the pro-
jected increase in the deficit for that par-
ticular year. Rather, the PAYGO scorecards 
identify average annual effects of legislation 
over the 5- and 10-year periods and assign 
that average to each year in the period. Be-
fore an average is calculated, any current- 
year effects are combined with those for the 
budget year. 
CBO has analyzed the implications of en-
acting the American Rescue Plan, which, by 
CBO’s estimate, would increase deficits by 
$1.9 trillion (including current-year effects) 
over both a 5-year period and a 10-year pe-
riod, assuming that no further legislation to 
offset that increase was enacted. In accord-
ance with the PAYGO law, OMB would 
record the average annual deficit on its 
scorecard, showing deficit increases of $381 
billion per year for five years, if its estimate 
of the act’s effects was the same as CBO’s. If 
the bill was enacted before the end of the 
calendar year, that amount would be added 
to the PAYGO scorecard, which currently 
carries no balances for 2021 or any subse-
quent years. 
Without enactment of subsequent legisla-
tion that would offset the deficit increase, 
waive the recordation of the bill’s effects on 
the scorecard, or otherwise mitigate or 
eliminate the statutory PAYGO require-
ments, OMB would be required to issue a se-
questration order within 15 days of the end of 
the Congressional session to reduce spending 
in fiscal year 2022 by $381 billion, CBO esti-
mates. However, the PAYGO law limits re-
ductions in Medicare spending to four per-
centage points (or an estimated $36 billion 
for that year), leaving $345 billion to be se-
questered from the remaining mandatory ac-
counts. Because the law entirely exempts 
many large accounts, including low-income 
programs and Social Security, in CBO’s esti-
mation, the annual resources available from 
which OMB must draw would total between 
$80 billion and $90 billion—significantly less 
than the amount that would be required to 
be sequestered. 
Because the required reduction in spending 
would exceed the estimated amount of avail-
able resources in each year over the next 10 
years, in the absence of further legislation, 
OMB would be unable to fully implement the 
outlay reductions required by the PAYGO 
law. 
If you wish further details on this esti-
mate, we will be pleased to provide them. 
The CBO staff contact is Avi Lerner. 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, 
Director. 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
House Republicans have filed hundreds 
and hundreds of amendments. All but 
two were voted down. 
This is clearly a partisan plan that is 
the wrong plan at the wrong time for 
all the wrong reasons. If you take out 
the direct checks to Americans, almost 
half of all the money that is in this bill 
will not be spent until fiscal year 2022 
or later. This is not imminent. 
It is the wrong plan at the wrong 
time and, we know, for all the wrong 
reasons. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, one of the things that 
we constantly have to remember is 
where we have been over the last year 
and the depths to which this economy 
has fallen, the pain and suffering that 
the American people have experienced. 
Mr. Speaker, 500,000 of our fellow 
citizens 
have 
perished 
by 
the 
coronavirus. 
That is why the polling on this bill is 
so overwhelming: 76 percent of the 
American people this week, 60 percent 
of Republicans. That is why 150 or 
more top CEOs from the country have 
said this is the right thing to do at this 
time. This is why the chairman of the 
Fed has said that we need to make this 
kind of investment in the country. 
That is why several regional presidents 
of the Fed have said that. That is why 
nonprofits have said this all over the 
country. That is why the U.S. Con-
ference of Mayors has said this is the 
right bill for the time. 
We have met the moment with this 
legislation. We have met the moment 
of need in this country. We are proud of 
the product we produced. We will make 
sure that the American people get 
through this pandemic, this economic 
crisis, this healthcare crisis, this per-
sonal crisis, and restore their standard 
of living and the economy of this coun-
try once we get to the other side. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) 
is recognized. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, more than a year has 
passed since the coronavirus was first 
detected in the United States. In that 
time, we have lost over half a million 
people to this relentless virus. We are a 
nation in mourning for our lost loved 
ones, our neighbors, and, indeed, our 
colleagues. 
As we mourn, much of American life 
is unrecognizable. Millions of Ameri-
cans have lost their jobs, their safety, 
and their security, and 10 million jobs 
that were lost have not been returned. 
This is the hard reality across this 
Nation and in every single congres-
sional district across our country. 
Through all this pain, our care for 
one another is still recognizable. We 
have seen this in the countless hours 
our health heroes have spent caring for 
the sick. We have seen other essential 
workers who have kept our grocery 
aisles stocked and our mail delivered. 
We have seen the care of neighbors, in-
deed, helping neighbors. 
Today, Congress acts in the same 
spirit of care for our fellow Americans 
by delivering on the relief our constitu-
ents, always with humility, have been 
asking for. 
This is not about dollars and cents. 
This is about lives that are at stake. 
We can save them by passing this bill. 
We will get shots into arms faster. We 
will help families stay housed and, in-
deed, put food on their tables. Most im-
portantly, this package will help fami-
lies avoid impossible choices. 
The Ways and Means Committee, 
which has written half of this legisla-
tion—and I must tell you, in all my 
years, I am really proud of what we 
did, and a reminder that it was the 
CARES Act that saved the American 
economy 1 year ago. Full of proven 
policies, it will fight both for public 
health and, simultaneously, the eco-
nomic crisis. 
We will not get back to economic re-
covery until we defeat this virus. 
We are balancing immediate relief 
and sustained support to keep Ameri-
cans afloat and ready to bounce back 
stronger than ever. We will make good 
on our promise of an additional $2,000 
from the $1,400 that we promised. We 
will enhance and expand the refundable 
tax credits for low- and middle-income 
workers and their families. 
Combined, these benefits will provide 
an average income boost of 33 percent 
for the poorest 20 percent of American 
households. This will be life-changing, 
and it will lift millions of children in 
this Nation out of poverty. 
For families, this bill offers massive 
savings in childcare expenses, which 
have been a major barrier to returning 
to 
the 
workforce, 
particularly 
for 
women. 
For millions of jobless Americans, we 
are ensuring that they can afford life’s 
necessities until this economy re-
bounds by extending pandemic-related 
unemployment benefits and increasing 
that benefit. 
Access to affordable, comprehensive 
healthcare is critical, so we have in-
cluded provisions to contain costs, par-
ticularly for unemployed workers. We 
will include help for nursing homes to 
crush the virus. 
Mr. Speaker, we shored up the multi-
employer 
pension 
plans, 
and 
you 
should know I am really proud of that 
as well. Thirty Republicans in this 
House have voted for this legislation 
on two different occasions. Those plans 
were jeopardized by COVID, and we in-
tend to correct that. 
Delaying is not an option. This is an 
opportunity to take bold action that 
will keep struggling Americans afloat 
and give them the peace of mind that 
better days are still to come. 
b 0020 
For those who ask, Is this too much? 
The answer is, No. 
Economists left, right, and center 
have agreed with what we are about to 
do. They know that too little is not 
enough as we fight the pandemic. We 
will continue to fight the virus like the 
grave enemy that it is and give people 
a fighting chance to make it through 
the pandemic. And we must give them 
a chance for opportunity as we get to 
the other side, and that is what we in-
tend to do with this legislation. 
I remind my colleagues that this is 
not the time for partisan rancor. And I

must say that the debate in the Ways 
and Means Committee was superb. We 
must go big. We must be bold. And we 
must rise to this challenge because the 
American 
people 
this 
evening 
are 
counting on us. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this plan, and 
I urge the rest of our colleagues to sup-
port it as well, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, America is hurting, but 
regrettably this so-called COVID–19 
stimulus is neither. 
Less than a dime of every dollar goes 
to COVID vaccines and defeating the 
virus. Less than a dime. It does next to 
nothing to help struggling Main Street 
businesses survive or to get America’s 
jobless back to work. 
In fact, the independent Congres-
sional Budget Office reports the bill’s 
controversial job-killing mandates will 
kill as many as 2 million jobs. Maybe 
that is why the White House refuses to 
tell the American people just how 
many jobs it will create. 
We need truth in advertising: This is 
a payoff to political friends. 
We did better when we worked to-
gether. Through December, over five 
COVID 
aid 
bills, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats, we worked tirelessly to de-
liver over $3.5 trillion, the largest 
amount of relief in American history. 
A whopping $1 trillion remains unspent 
today by States, local governments, 
and schools. 
Economists, 
including 
President 
Obama’s own economic adviser, Larry 
Summers, worry this will actually 
make things worse. 
The Washington Post called this 
‘‘sausage-making’’ that ‘‘strays from 
the most urgent COVID-related needs.’’ 
The Wall Street Journal said this is a 
‘‘non-COVID spending blowout.’’ 
Even Democratic colleagues, like 
New York’s ADRIANO ESPAILLAT, admit-
ted this bill will have embarrassing 
provisions. 
House Democrats rejected every com-
monsense Republican improvement. 
Help millions of unemployed, but 
make sure no one gets paid more to 
stay at home than go to work? Re-
jected. 
Send child poverty funding equally to 
all poor children in America, rather 
than a chosen few in Democrat States? 
Rejected. 
In fact, Democrats said that miserly 
States didn’t deserve this funding. Mi-
serly States like West Virginia. I hope 
you heard that, Senator MANCHIN. 
Require that crucial school funding 
goes to schools that are open? Re-
jected. 
Protecting 
frontline 
healthcare 
workers from frivolous lawsuits? Re-
jected. 
Stop rampant unemployment fraud 
simply by verifying the identity and 
wages of those applying? Rejected. 
Giving a second stimulus check to 
the millions of Joe Jobless, the victims 
of President Biden’s war on energy and 
his minimum wage mandate? Rejected. 
How about helping parents use edu-
cation 
and 
savings 
towards 
kids’ 
schooling, and especially therapies for 
special-needs kids? Rejected. 
What about aiding families by mak-
ing permanent the 2017 tax reform’s 
doubled child tax credits? Nope. 
Make sure precious healthcare dol-
lars aren’t used for abortions or di-
verted to undocumented immigrants? 
Uh-uh. 
Republicans proposed requiring Gov-
ernors report accurate data on their 
nursing home deaths, but Democrats 
unanimously chose to protect New 
York Governor Cuomo’s deadly policies 
and cover-up. Hours later after the 
vote, Cuomo’s aides admitted they had 
reported false data. 
Speaker 
PELOSI’s 
favorite 
pet 
projects and other wasteful spending 
could go to more vaccine distribution 
for needy Americans. But no, rejected. 
President Biden promised unity. Now 
he threatens to punish Republicans 
who oppose this massive payoff to 
Democrats’ political friends. 
But President Biden and the Demo-
crats are not punishing us by rejecting 
bipartisanship, they are punishing the 
American people. 
If you don’t know how many jobs this 
will create, then don’t repeat the failed 
Obama-Biden stimulus that led to the 
worst economic recovery in our life-
time. 
Stop this political payoff. Let’s find 
common ground, as we have before, on 
what is truly urgent: crushing the 
virus, rebuilding this economy, saving 
Main Street businesses, and getting 
Americans back to work. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I include in 
the RECORD a letter from the staff of 
the Joint Committee on Taxation pro-
viding a technical explanation of sec-
tion 9674 of the American Rescue Plan 
Act of 2021, and request that the Joint 
Committee post the letter on their 
website as well. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
JOINT COMMITTEE ON TAXATION, 
Washington, DC, February 26, 2021. 
Hon. RICHARD E. NEAL, 
Committee on Ways and Means, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN NEAL: You asked the staff 
of the Joint Committee on Taxation to pre-
pare a technical explanation of a provision 
to modify the exceptions for reporting third 
party network transactions provided by In-
ternal Revenue Code section 6050W. The spe-
cific legislative text is new section 9674 of 
subtitle G of title IX of the American Rescue 
Plan Act of 2021, as amended by the proposed 
manager’s amendment. 
Enclosed please find the Joint Committee 
staff’s description of present law and tech-
nical explanation of this proposal. 
Sincerely, 
THOMAS A. BARTHOLD, 
Chief of Staff. 
Enclosure. 
Technical Explanation of the Modification of 
Exceptions of Reporting Third Party Net-
work Transactions in New Section 9674 of 
Subtitle IX of the American Rescue Plan 
Act of 2021, as Amended by the Proposed 
Manager’s Amendment 
(Prepared by the Staff of the Joint 
Committee on Taxation, Feb. 26, 2021) 
MODIFICATIONS OF EXCEPTIONS FOR REPORT-
ING THIRD PARTY NETWORK TRANSACTIONS 
PRESENT LAW 
Present law requires persons to file an in-
formation return concerning certain trans-
actions with other persons. The person filing 
an information return is also required to 
provide the recipient of the payment with a 
written statement showing the aggregate 
payments made and the contact information 
for the payor. These returns are intended to 
assist taxpayers in preparing their income 
tax returns and to help the IRS determine 
whether such income tax returns are correct 
and complete. 
Returns relating to payments made in set-
tlement of payment card and third party 
network transactions: 
Starting in 2012 (for payments received in 
2011), payment settlement entities are re-
quired to report the gross amount of pay-
ments made in settlement of payment card 
transactions and third party network trans-
actions to the IRS and to businesses that re-
ceive these payments. 
Specifically, the statute requires any pay-
ment settlement entity making a payment 
to a participating payee in settlement of re-
portable payment transactions to report an-
nually to the IRS and to the participating 
payee the gross amount of such reportable 
payment transactions, as well as the name, 
address, and TIN of the participating payees. 
A ‘‘reportable payment transaction’’ means 
any payment card transaction and any third 
party network transaction. 
A ‘‘payment settlement entity’’ means, in 
the case of a payment card transaction, a 
merchant acquiring entity and, in the case of 
a third party network transaction, a third 
party settlement organization. A ‘‘partici-
pating payee’’ means, in the case of a pay-
ment card transaction, any person who ac-
cepts a payment card as payment and, in the 
case of a third party network transaction, 
any person who accepts payment from a 
third party settlement organization in set-
tlement of such transaction. 
For purposes of the reporting requirement, 
the 
term 
‘‘merchant 
acquiring 
entity’’ 
means a bank or other organization with the 
contractual obligation to make payment to 
participating payees in settlement of pay-
ment card transactions. A ‘‘payment card 
transaction’’ 
means 
any 
transaction 
in 
which a payment card is accepted as pay-
ment? A ‘‘payment card’’ is defined as any 
card (e.g., a credit card or debit card) which 
is issued pursuant to an agreement or ar-
rangement which provides for: (1) one or 
more issuers of such cards; (2) a network of 
persons purpose, unrelated to each other, 
and to the issuer, who agree to accept such 
cards as payment; and (3) standards and 
mechanisms for settling the transactions be-
tween the merchant acquiring entities and 
the persons who agree to accept such cards 
as payment. Thus, under the provision, a 
bank that enrolls a business to accept credit 
cards and contracts with the business to 
make payment on credit card transactions is 
required to report to the IRS the business’s 
gross credit card transactions for each cal-
endar year on a Form 1099–K, Payment Card 
and Third Party Network Transactions. The 
bank also is required to provide a copy of the 
information report to the business. 
The statute also requires reporting on a 
third party network transaction. The term

‘‘third party network transaction’’ means 
any transaction which is settled through a 
third party payment network. A ‘‘third party 
payment network’’ is defined as any agree-
ment or arrangement: (1) that involves the 
establishment of accounts with a central or-
ganization by a substantial number of per-
sons (e.g., more than 50) who are unrelated to 
such organization, provide goods or services, 
and have agreed to settle transactions for 
the provision of such goods or services pursu-
ant to such agreement or arrangement; (2) 
that provides for standards and mechanisms 
for settling such transactions; and (3) that 
guarantees persons providing goods or serv-
ices pursuant to such agreement or arrange-
ment that such persons will be paid for pro-
viding such goods or services. In the case of 
a third party network transaction, the pay-
ment settlement entity is the third party 
settlement organization, which is defined as 
the central organization which has the con-
tractual obligation to make payment to par-
ticipating payees of third party network 
transactions. Thus, an organization gen-
erally is required to report if it provides a 
network enabling buyers to transfer funds to 
sellers who have established accounts with 
the organization and have a contractual obli-
gation to accept payment through the net-
work. However, an organization operating a 
network which merely processes electronic 
payments (such as wire transfers, electronic 
checks, and direct deposit payments) be-
tween buyers and sellers, but does not have 
contractual agreements with sellers to use 
such network, is not required to report. 
Similarly, an agreement to transfer funds 
between two demand deposit accounts will 
not, by itself, constitute a third party net-
work transaction. 
A third party payment network does not 
include any agreement or arrangement that 
provides for the issuance of payment cards as 
defined by the provision. In addition, there is 
an exception for de minimis payments that 
applies to payments made by third party set-
tlement organizations but not to payments 
made by merchant acquiring entities. A 
third party settlement organization is not 
required to report unless the aggregate value 
of third party network transactions with re-
spect to a taxpayer for the year exceeds 
$20,000 and the aggregate number of such 
transactions with respect to a taxpayer ex-
ceeds 200. If a payment of funds is made to a 
third 
party 
settlement 
organization 
by 
means of a payment card (i.e., as part of a 
payment card transaction), the $20,000 and 
200 transaction de minimis rule continues to 
apply to any reporting obi igation with re-
spect to payment of such funds to a partici-
pating payee by the third party settlement 
organization made as part of a third party 
network transaction. 
So, for example, if a business that provides 
a web-based rental platform for short-term 
travelers is considered a third party settle-
ment organization, it does not have to pro-
vide a Form 1099–K to property owners par-
ticipating on their web-based site who have 
received payments of $20,000 or less. On the 
other hand, if that company is considered a 
merchant acquiring entity, it would have to 
issue a Form 1099–K to all payees partici-
pating on its platform who have received 
payments of any amount starting with the 
first dollar. 
There are also reporting requirements on 
intermediaries who receive payments from a 
payment settlement entity and distribute 
such payments to one or more participating 
payees. Such intermediaries are treated as 
participating payees with respect to the pay-
ment settlement entity and as payment set-
tlement entities with respect to the partici-
pating payees to whom the intermediary dis-
tributes payments. Thus, for example, in the 
case of a corporation that receives payment 
from a bank for credit card sales effectuated 
at the corporation’s independently-owned 
franchise stores, the bank is required to re-
port the gross amount of reportable payment 
transactions settled through the corporation 
(notwithstanding the fact that the corpora-
tion does not accept payment cards and 
would not otherwise be treated as a partici-
pating payee). In turn, the corporation, as an 
intermediary, would be required to report 
the gross amount of reportable payment 
transactions allocable to each franchise 
store. The bank would have no reporting ob-
ligation with respect to payments made by 
the corporation to its franchise stores. 
Another rule provides that if a payment 
settlement entity contracts with a third 
party to settle reportable payment trans-
actions on behalf of the payment settlement 
entity, the third party is required to file the 
annual information return in lieu of the pay-
ment settlement entity. 
The payment settlement entity is required 
to file the information return to the IRS on 
or before February 28th (March 31st if filing 
electronically) of the year following the cal-
endar year for which the return must be 
filed. The statements are required to be fur-
nished to the participating payees on or be-
fore January 31st of the year following the 
calendar year for which the return was re-
quired to be made. 
The Secretary has exercised authority 
under these rules to issue guidance to imple-
ment the reporting requirement, including 
rules to prevent the reporting of the same 
transaction more than once. 
The reportable payment transactions sub-
ject to information reporting generally are 
subject to backup withholding requirements. 
In addition, the information reporting pen-
alties apply for any failure to file a correct 
information return or furnish a correct 
payee statement with respect to the report-
able payment transactions. Any person who 
is required to file an information return or 
furnish a payee statement but who fails to 
do so on or before the prescribed due date is 
subject to a penalty that varies based on 
when, if at all, the correct information re-
turn is filed or furnished. There are penalties 
imposed for failure to file the information 
return, furnish payee statements, or comply 
with other various reporting requirements. 
No penalty is imposed if the failure is due to 
reasonable cause. Both the failure to file and 
failure to furnish penalties are adjusted an-
nually to account for inflation. 
EXPLANATION OF PROVISION 
This provision lowers and modifies the 
threshold below which a third party settle-
ment organization is not required to report 
payments to participants in its network. 
Under the provision, for any calendar year, a 
third party settlement organization is re-
quired to report third party network trans-
actions with any participating payee that 
exceed a minimum threshold of $600 in aggre-
gate payments, regardless of the aggregate 
number of such transactions. 
Third party network transactions include 
any commercial transactions settled through 
a third party payment network. The provi-
sion also clarifies that third party network 
transactions only include transactions for 
the provision of goods or services (e.g., per-
sonal gifts, charitable contributions, and re-
imbursements are not included). 
For example, an individual who has reg-
istered for a mobile payment service and 
uses such a service to reimburse friends or 
relatives for expenses, or on occasion sells a 
used item to another person, would not be 
engaging in transactions that are subject to 
reporting requirements. However, if that in-
dividual were to register with such mobile 
payment service for the purposes of engaging 
in commercial transactions, such as regu-
larly carrying on a trade or business through 
use of that service, the mobile payment serv-
ice would be required to report under the 
provision. 
EFFECTIVE DATE 
The part of the provision that lowers and 
modifies the reporting threshold is effective 
for returns for calendar years beginning 
after December 31, 2021. 
The part of the provision that clarifies 
that reporting is not required on trans-
actions which are not for goods or services is 
effective for transactions after the date of 
enactment. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, let me also 
note on this proud day that it happens 
to be the 95th anniversary of the cre-
ation of the Joint Committee on Tax-
ation, and throughout its history it has 
provided the Committee on Ways and 
Means with invaluable advice, and I 
suspect that is something we can all 
agree on. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from California (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of this 
legislation. The American people are 
hurting, half a million people are dead, 
tens of millions have gotten sick. Mil-
lions have lost their jobs, businesses 
have shut down, many closed forever, 
and kids can’t go to school. Families 
are without food and behind on their 
rent. 
This bill provides direct payments to 
Americans and helps small businesses 
and restaurants. It provides crucial 
funding for State and local govern-
ments, funding for vaccines, childcare, 
and critical funds to get our kids back 
safely to school. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to vote 
for this bill, the American people are 
counting on us. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise to oppose this massive legisla-
tion. We are here supposedly for COVID 
relief, but the vast majority of this 
bill, as you have already heard, has 
nothing to do with defeating this dis-
ease. 
Real COVID relief would prioritize 
vaccine distribution, reopening small 
businesses, and getting our children 
back in classrooms. This bill does not 
do that. 
This bill is a litany of longstanding 
proposals which are detrimental to our 
small businesses and will actually hurt 
our efforts to reconnect the unem-
ployed. 
The extension of the child tax credit 
and EITC were first introduced long be-
fore 
the 
pandemic 
and 
will 
disincentivize returning to work. Like-
wise, the proposed bailout for mis-
managed multiemployer pensions pre-
dates COVID–19. And now we have 
learned that bringing this bill to the 
floor was actually delayed because 
Democrats were adding a new cash 
grab, drastically lowering the thresh-
old at which gig workers receive a 1099– 
K.

It is like the majority learned noth-
ing from the debacle they created when 
they shoehorned new 1099 rules into 
ObamaCare. 
Mr. Speaker, I am appalled that we 
are here tonight continuing to try to 
address this in such a manner when we 
owe the American people better than 
what this legislation delivers. I urge its 
defeat. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER), a member of the 
Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
was stunned to hear our friend from 
North Carolina talk about the rosy 
economic situation. 
Let me give one example. For the 
last year, I have been working on be-
half of America’s 500,000 independent 
restaurants. There are 11 million em-
ployees and their trillion-dollar supply 
chain. 
b 0030 
Already it is too late for one in six 
who have closed permanently this last 
year. Without direct assistance, we 
could lose 80 percent. The good news is 
that the American Rescue Plan con-
tains $25 billion to fund the restaurants 
bill. Without the direct relief they 
need, those restaurants won’t survive. 
This is why it has broad, bipartisan 
support from Republican mayors, Gov-
ernors, local officials, and business 
leaders. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge the pas-
sage of the American Rescue Plan and 
the $25 billion lifeline to our inde-
pendent restaurants that are so impor-
tant to our communities. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from West 
Virginia (Mrs. MILLER), who is a new 
member of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee. 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I raise bison. I know bull 
when I see it, and I know manure when 
I see it. Less than 10 percent of this so- 
called stimulus package actually fo-
cuses on the pandemic. 
In this bill, House Democrats said no 
to my proposal to target aid to States 
with high child poverty rates to lift 
our children up. Instead, they said yes 
to $1,400 checks that could go to people 
who entered our country illegally. 
They said yes to hundreds of millions 
for absurd pet projects, like Silicon 
Valley subway systems, the Seaway 
International Bridge, and $350 billion 
in blue State bailouts. 
Let’s cut the bull. The $1.9 trillion 
payout doesn’t crush COVID, nor does 
it 
create 
jobs. 
Our 
grandchildren 
should not be saddled with the cost of 
this bag of bailouts. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Indi-
ana (Mrs. WALORSKI). 
Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I be-
lieve every person born or unborn is 
worthy of our protection. A majority of 
Americans—nearly 60 percent—believe 
that Federal tax dollars should not be 
used to pay for the destruction of life. 
Hyde protections to prohibit taxpayer 
funding for elective abortions have 
been in place in this country ever since 
President Ford. Even President Biden 
supported them as a Senator. But now 
House Democrats have abandoned near-
ly a half century of bipartisan con-
sensus. 
I offered an amendment in the Ways 
and Means Committee to include Hyde 
protections, which have saved more 
than 2 million innocent lives in this 
$1.9 trillion bill. I also joined my col-
leagues in submitting a similar amend-
ment for floor consideration. Demo-
crats rejected both. 
This is a moment that calls for heal-
ing and not destruction, for saving 
lives and not ending them, for bringing 
Americans together and not tearing us 
apart. It is sad to see partisanship take 
priority 
over 
the 
most 
vulnerable 
among us, the unborn. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in protecting innocent life by 
opposing this bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Illinois 
(Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS), who is a member 
of the Ways and Means Committee. 
Mr. Speaker, the residents of my dis-
trict and of districts all over America 
are jumping for joy. They are jumping 
because they see this bill like manna 
from heaven. There is money for 
COVID testing; money for vaccines; 
money for their pockets; money to help 
reopen schools; unemployment checks; 
tax credits for children; money for hos-
pitals, health centers, nursing homes, 
daycare centers, State, county, and 
local governments; money for poor 
families, 
poor 
children, 
homeless 
youth, small businesses, restaurants, 
rental assistance and mortgage pay-
ments so they can stay in their homes. 
You name it, Mr. Speaker, it is in this 
bill. 
Joe Biden to the rescue. Thank God 
for Joe Biden and KAMALA
HARRIS, 
NANCY PELOSI and CHUCK SCHUMER, and 
especially the people in Georgia. I will 
vote for this bill. I will vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Yes, Mr. Speaker, I will vote to rescue 
and save America. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. THOMPSON), who is the 
lead Republican of the House Agri-
culture Committee. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, 2 weeks ago, the major-
ity frog-marched the Agriculture Com-
mittee through a Potemkin markup. It 
was a legislative charade designed to 
give this process a veneer of regular 
order. 
The truth is that this bill was drafted 
behind closed doors by the Democratic 
leadership, without input from the 
many rural stakeholders who have 
been begging this Congress for help. 
The result is a bill that spends too 
much on flawed priorities and fails to 
meet the needs of rural communities. 
Agriculture Committee Republicans 
offered amendments to provide much- 
needed funding for rural hospitals, 
schools, and businesses; telemedicine 
services; broadband connectivity; and 
critical disaster relief. 
Surprising no one, these were de-
feated on a partisan basis. For the one 
that did pass in our committee, it was 
stripped from the bill before reaching 
the floor. 
It is astonishing, Mr. Speaker. De-
spite the wish list of political give-
aways and excessive spending in this 
bill, the majority somehow managed to 
forget rural America. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill. I be-
lieve that we can do better than this. 
In fact, we must do better than this. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ken-
tucky (Mr. BARR). 
Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, my friends 
on the other side of the aisle should be 
embarrassed. This massive, $1.9 trillion 
spending spree is nothing more than a 
fiscally irresponsible, liberal wish list. 
Less than 10 percent of this bill actu-
ally responds to the pandemic in the 
form of vaccine distribution and other 
public health needs. The vast majority 
of this funding goes to misplaced prior-
ities, such as bailing out mismanaged 
State and local governments for pre- 
COVID liabilities, paying people to not 
work, expanding ObamaCare, providing 
stimulus checks to illegal immigrants, 
and allowing taxpayer funds to pay for 
abortion. 
It is true that the legislation appro-
priates $130 billion on top of the $110 
billion already provided to schools, but 
it does so without any stipulation that 
schools actually reopen. This is despite 
overwhelming evidence that it is safe 
for our children to go back to in-person 
learning. And 95 percent of the money 
allocated to schools will not be spent 
until after 2022, which means this bill 
does almost nothing to get our kids 
back in the classroom. Meanwhile, ap-
proximately $1 trillion in COVID relief 
already appropriated by Congress re-
mains unspent. 
Mr. Speaker, I am voting ‘‘no’’ for 
my children, I am voting ‘‘no’’ to pro-
tect taxpayers, and I encourage all of 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. SA´ NCHEZ), who is a member 
of the Ways and Means Committee. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman NEAL for his leadership in 
crafting such a big part of this bold 
package. It has been almost 1 year 
since our lives were turned upside 
down. In that time, we have lost loved 
ones, friends, and neighbors; and mil-
lions more families are out of options. 
We cannot afford to leave anyone be-
hind. That is why this plan extends 
critical lifelines, so that families can 
meet their basic needs of putting food

on the table and paying their rent 
while we finally get this pandemic 
under control. I don’t know what fan-
tasy la-la land my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle live in, but fami-
lies are hurting in this country, and 
this bill will help them. 
Mr. Speaker, you cannot stand up 
here and say you support the working 
class and families when you plan on 
voting ‘‘no’’ to helping them. 
I am proud that this package in-
cludes many good things that help de-
liver on behalf of families that are in 
need. But I am especially proud that 
this package includes a bill that I in-
troduced with Congresswoman MCBATH 
from Georgia, which will provide those 
on unemployment benefits with a guar-
anteed subsidy for healthcare so they 
don’t lose their coverage in the middle 
of the worst pandemic that our country 
has seen in 100 years. 
I am also pleased that this package 
includes an expansion and an improve-
ment of the Child and Dependent Care 
Tax Credit that I have long cham-
pioned. These robust resources will 
help us meet the moment. This rescue 
plan will keep families and children 
from falling into poverty. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from California. 
Ms. SA´ NCHEZ. Mr. Speaker, this is 
not the time for small thinking. My 
Republican colleagues don’t get that. 
They oppose this bill, despite the fact 
that it is wildly popular even among 
Republicans. Their opposition, I think, 
is simply because it is a Democratic 
bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ for the American Rescue 
Plan so that all families can see better 
days ahead. 
b 0040 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. PERRY). 
Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, we all 
want to help. This is the American 
Rescue Plan—the American Rescue 
Plan. Somehow, $8.6 billion of the 
American Rescue Plan is headed over-
seas. 
This isn’t a rescue plan. This is a 
grift. This is theft. 
We are digging tunnels. We are build-
ing bridges. That has nothing to do 
with the pandemic. Ninety percent of 
this money goes everywhere but the 
pandemic. 
I mean, it is not going to help 
schools. It is not going to help people 
who have been put out of their jobs. It 
is not going to help people who need a 
vaccination or healthcare, none of 
that. 
Ninety percent of about $2 trillion, 
this is a payoff. It is payoff to political 
friends. That is why it is partisan, be-
cause we don’t think we should be pay-
ing off political friends. We want to 
help the American people. 
Mr. Speaker, this doesn’t help the 
American people. This is a grift. They 
are abusing people who are sick and 
have died and are hurting. This is 
abuse. I vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Arkan-
sas (Mr. WESTERMAN), the lead Repub-
lican on the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Speaker, this 
is the second time today I have been 
here speaking against highly partisan 
Democrat wish list bills that fall under 
my committee’s jurisdiction but never 
went through a markup. 
This so-called rescue plan is to 
COVID relief what Democrat rhetoric 
is to actual bipartisanship and trans-
parency. It is disingenuous. It is a 
headline that doesn’t match the con-
tents of the story. It has the credibility 
of Russian, Chinese, and North Korean 
virus reporting. It is as germane to its 
stated purpose as the metal detectors 
outside this Chamber are to our safety. 
This bill contains bad policy con-
cocted through a bad process that will 
produce bad results. The short-term 
gratification of Congress spending to-
morrow’s lunch money on bailout 
candy today will be the burden of mil-
lions of Americans students who are 
still out of school and being left be-
hind. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ‘‘no’’ vote 
and an honest discussion about the real 
needs of America. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman, the number one 
second baseman on the team. 
The bill you are about to vote on is 
the gravy train, and the final stop be-
fore it goes off the cliff is this Cham-
ber, Mr. Speaker. It costs $1.9 trillion, 
and only 9 percent goes to addressing 
the coronavirus. 
It is easy to understand why my col-
leagues across the aisle are so eager to 
vote for this massive bailout, because 
everything in it is for political pay-
backs: $300 billion for mismanaged gov-
ernments in blue States; $100 million 
for a subway for Speaker PELOSI; even 
Mr. SCHUMER gets a bridge to nowhere. 
There is way too much dadgum pork 
in here for special interests that have 
nothing to do with addressing the 
coronavirus. This was drafted for the 
politicians in D.C., not my constitu-
ents in east Tennessee. 
Mr. Speaker, I will proudly vote ‘‘no’’ 
on this so-called relief package. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. DELBENE), a member 
of the Ways and Means Committee who 
has had a profound influence on the 
child credits in this legislation. 
Ms. DELBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the American Res-
cue Plan. 
This bill contains critical support for 
our communities, including a provision 
that I fought for in expansion of the 
child tax credit. The child tax credit is 
the largest Federal investment we 
make in our children, but it still leaves 
behind one-third of all children who are 
in families who earn too little to get 
the full credit. 
Those left behind include half of 
Black and Hispanic children, families 
with young children, families in rural 
areas, and families headed by women. 
This bill will provide an increased cred-
it and monthly payments to help fami-
lies pay bills and buy essentials. An es-
timated 8 million people have fallen 
into poverty during this crisis, making 
the current need even greater. 
Today, my colleagues have the oppor-
tunity to vote to crush the virus, get 
our economy back on track, and trans-
form the lives of impoverished chil-
dren. Mr. Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this critical 
legislation. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄4 
minutes to the gentleman from Ala-
bama (Mr. PALMER). 
Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, millions 
of American school children will soon 
have missed a year of in-person in-
struction, and we may have inflicted 
permanent damage on some of them 
and on our country. 
The educational losses are dispropor-
tionately the fault of Democratic Gov-
ernors and mayors. Those are not my 
words but the content of an article in 
The New York Times. 
The article goes on to say: ‘‘The 
blunt fact is that it is Democrats, in-
cluding those who run the West Coast, 
from California through Oregon to 
Washington State, who have presided 
over one of the worst blows to the edu-
cation of disadvantaged Americans in 
history. The result: more dropouts, less 
literacy and numeracy, widening race 
gaps, and long-term harm to some of 
our most marginalized youth.’’ 
The article continues: ‘‘As many as 3 
million children in the United States 
have missed all formal education, in- 
person or virtual, for almost a year.’’ 
Democrat policies leaving schools 
closed have inflicted a pandemic of de-
pression, anxiety, behavioral problems, 
drug abuse, and suicide among school- 
age children. You said this bill will get 
children back in school, but the funds 
in this bill that are education-related 
have nothing to do with reopening 
schools. It leaves them closed. 
I hope parents of the children who 
are locked out of their schools are 
watching what you are doing, how you 
have abandoned their children in favor 
of your powerful political friends. I can 
only hope they never forget that, at 
the moment they needed you to step up 
and do the right thing, you failed them 
and their children. 
Mr. Speaker, millions of American school-
children will soon have missed a year of in- 
person instruction, and we may have inflicted 
permanent damage on some of them, and on

our country. The educational losses are dis-
proportionately the fault of Democratic gov-
ernors and mayors who too often let schools 
stay closed even as bars opened. 
Those are not my words, but the content of 
an article in the New York Times. The Times 
article goes on to say, The blunt fact is that it 
is Democrats—including those who run the 
West Coast, from California through Oregon to 
Washington State—who have presided over 
one of the worst blows to the education of dis-
advantaged Americans in history. The result: 
more dropouts, less literacy and numeracy, 
widening race gaps, and long-term harm to 
some of our most marginalized youth. 
It continues, The San Francisco Federal Re-
serve Bank this month estimated that edu-
cational disruptions during this pandemic may 
increase the number of high school dropouts 
over 10 years by 3.8 percent, while also re-
ducing the number of college-educated work-
ers in the labor force. This will shrink the in-
comes of Americans for 70 years, until the last 
of today’s students leave the work force, the 
bank said. 
As many as three million children in the 
United States have missed all formal edu-
cation, in-person or virtual, for almost a year. 
Finally, The Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention found, ‘‘in-person learning in 
schools has not been associated with substan-
tial community transmission.’’ The British Med-
ical Journal this week put it this way in an edi-
torial: ‘‘Closing schools is not evidence based 
and harms children.’’ I remind you, this is from 
the New York Times. 
Democrat policies have inflicted a pandemic 
of depression, anxiety, behavioral problems, 
drug abuse, and suicide among school-age 
children. 
Democrats, 
including 
President 
Biden, have said you will follow the science on 
school openings, but that is not what is being 
done. You said this bill will help get children 
back in school, but instead, you are bailing out 
the teachers’ union’s pension plans, building a 
bridge in New York, constructing an under-
ground tunnel in Silicon Valley, bailing out in-
competently run state governments, lavishing 
money on museums and the arts. The funds 
in this bill that are education-related have 
nothing to do with reopening schools. It leaves 
them closed. 
I hope parents of the children who are 
locked out of their schools are watching what 
you are doing, how you have abandoned their 
children in favor of your powerful political 
friends. I can only hope they never forget that 
at the moment they needed you to step up 
and do the right thing . . . you failed them 
and their children. 
I urge my colleagues to vote NO on this bill. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. 
Americans struggling with COVID, 
businesses fighting to survive, seniors 
waiting for vaccines, millions of Amer-
icans now jobless due to lockdowns, 
they all deserve better than this par-
tisan, rushed, special interest payoff to 
political friends. 
Less than a dime of every dollar of 
this bill goes to COVID vaccines and 
defeating the virus. There is next to 
nothing to save Main Street businesses 
or get Americans unemployed back to 
work. And after spending nearly $2 tril-
lion, the White House can’t, or won’t, 
tell us how many jobs this will create. 
History will describe this moment as 
a time when more than 500,000 Ameri-
cans have lost their lives, millions are 
jobless, small businesses are strug-
gling, and seniors are praying for the 
vaccine, and House Democrats said: 
Let’s build our Speaker a tunnel. 
Come on, man. We can do better. We 
can work in a bipartisan way to crush 
this virus and rebuild America’s econ-
omy, just as we did five times this past 
year to deliver the largest relief in 
American history. Vote ‘‘no’’ to pay-
offs to political friends. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
b 0050 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Let me begin by recognizing the ex-
traordinary work that has gone into 
this legislation by the Ways and Means 
Committee staff, the Office of Legisla-
tive Counsel, the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, and many others: Morna Mil-
ler, Amy Hall, Kara Getz, Andrew 
Grossman, Melanie Egorin, and Alice 
Lin, to name but a few of the superb 
staff members that we have. 
They have worked long hours under 
immense pressure, all while facing the 
same challenges of remote school, lack 
of child care, and concern for family 
members that Americans everywhere 
face. There are too many names to in-
clude here, but let it be known that 
your counsel is unparalleled and your 
expertise is unmatched. 
Mr. Speaker, tonight, we recognize 
that a half a million people have died. 
Millions have been affected by this 
dreadful disease. Ten million jobs that 
were lost have not been returned, and 
18 million members of our family are 
receiving unemployment benefits. Peo-
ple who never imagined that they 
might be relying on a food bank are 
lining up weekly, and they are part of 
the unthinkable number of children 
that still go hungry as we meet. 
With this legislation, we are taking 
bold action, and, yes, it is sweeping. I 
want to thank Joe Biden for his cour-
age and vision in helping to bring us to 
this moment. Yes, it will be costly, but 
if crushing this virus and ending the 
suffering that Americans are currently 
facing, if it is not worth this invest-
ment, then I ask: What is? 
Over the Speaker’s rostrum there is 
an extraordinary quote by a son of 
Massachusetts, and I think that it 
compels us to this moment. Mr. Web-
ster asked, ‘‘Let us develop the re-
sources of our land and call forth its 
powers and build up its institutions, 
promote all of its great interests, and 
see whether we also in our day and gen-
eration may not perform something 
worthy to be remembered.’’ 
Tonight, as we vote for this legisla-
tion, we are going to achieve some-
thing that will be worthy to be remem-
bered. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
a letter listing business leaders in sup-
port of this bill. 
180 BUSINESS LEADERS SIGN IN SUPPORT OF 
THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(By Jana Plat, Feb. 24, 2021) 
WASHINGTON, DC—Today, 180 CEOs issued a 
public letter to leaders of Congress, urging 
rapid, bipartisan adoption of a stimulus 
package on the model of the American Res-
cue Plan. The following is the text of the let-
ter and the full list of signatories. 
DEAR MAJORITY LEADER SCHUMER, SPEAKER 
PELOSI, MINORITY LEADER MCCONNELL
AND 
MINORITY LEADER MCCARTHY: We write to 
urge immediate and large-scale federal legis-
lation to address the health and economic 
crises brought on by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
More than a year after the first coronavirus 
case was reported in the United States, our 
nation is still struggling to combat the 
spread and reverse its economic fallout. 
Previous federal relief measures have been 
essential, but more must be done to put the 
country on a trajectory for a strong, durable 
recovery. Congress should act swiftly and on 
a bipartisan basis to authorize a stimulus 
and relief package along the lines of the 
Biden-Harris 
administration’s 
proposed 
American Rescue Plan. 
Strengthening the public health response 
to coronavirus is the first step toward eco-
nomic restoration. The American Rescue 
Plan mobilizes a national vaccination pro-
gram, delivers economic relief to struggling 
families, and supports communities that 
were most damaged by the pandemic. 
More than 10 million fewer Americans are 
working today than when the pandemic 
began, small businesses across the country 
are facing bankruptcy, and schools are strug-
gling to reopen. The most vulnerable Ameri-
cans—including women, people of color and 
low wage workers—are experiencing the 
worst of the pandemic, with unprecedented 
job loss, childcare burdens and food insecu-
rity. States and cities have been crushed by 
pandemic-related 
expenses 
and 
revenue 
losses. 
The American Rescue Plan provides a 
framework for coordinated public-private ef-
forts to overcome COVID–19 and to move for-
ward with a new era of inclusive growth. The 
country’s business community is prepared to 
work with you to achieve these critical ob-
jectives.

Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, an 
analysis by the Committee for a Responsible 
Federal Budget shows that approximately $1 
trillion of previously appropriated COVID–19 
relief funds have not been spent. 
Let me say that again, Mr. Speaker, about 
a trillion dollars appropriated by Congress for 
COVID relief has not been spent. 
Yet today, the House will vote on spending 
an additional $1.9 trillion. 
Without so much as a single congressional 
hearing held with expert witnesses—including 
top officials in the Biden Administration—to 
probe the what, why, and how much, the 
House will likely approve this massive spend-
ing package without serious scrutiny. 
I’m committed and want to work in a bipar-
tisan way to ensure that the federal govern-
ment’s ongoing response to the pandemic is 
both robust and responsible. 
With more people getting vaccinated— 
meaning fewer infections and many lives 
saved—it’s now possible to hope that we 
might soon see some improvement in the 
economy. The non-partisan Congressional 
Budget Office (CBO) for example, projected in 
its February 1 report that real GDP will return 
to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of this 
year, 2021—meaning jobs and renewed eco-
nomic security. 
Last year, I strongly supported, and Con-
gress passed five bipartisan COVID funding 
relief bills that were signed into law—totaling 
$4.1 trillion. 
That included $458 billion for stimulus 
checks to individuals, $586 billion for ex-
panded unemployment benefits, $68.9 billion

for nutrition programs and a whopping $1.47 
trillion for grant programs like the Paycheck 
Protection Program (PPP) to help small busi-
nesses and others retain and pay their em-
ployees during the shutdown. 
I would note parenthetically, that as a law-
maker who absolutely thrives on constituent 
casework, my staff and I have helped solve 
thousands of problems faced by the people in 
my district including facilitating medicines to 
patients made severely ill by the coronavirus, 
PPE for health workers and first responders, 
PPP for our small businesses and nonprofits 
and more. My staff and I have left no stone 
unturned in helping more than 1,500 people in 
my district who have faced unconscionable 
delays—even denials—in obtaining the unem-
ployment compensation they are entitled to 
under congressionally appropriated COVID 
funding laws. Implementation of unemploy-
ment compensation by the State of New Jer-
sey has been profoundly disappointing. 
Mr. Speaker, the public-private sector effort 
to swiftly create safe and effective vaccines to 
protect against COVID has no parallel in his-
tory. 
Just breathtaking. 
That’s what Dr. Francis Collins, the Director 
of the National Institutes of Health, recently 
said when asked by an Axios reporter what 
the Trump Administration got right in the effort 
to fight COVID–19 as he gushed about both 
the efficacy and unprecedented speed in ap-
proving and disseminating lifesaving vaccines. 
Dr. Collins praised Trump’s Operation Warp 
Speed and said they brought all parts of gov-
ernment together in an ‘‘unprecedented way to 
test up to six vaccines in rigorous trials’’. 
He said that would not be the way things 
are traditionally done and added: the fact that 
we in December had not one but two vaccines 
that had gone through trials of at least 30,000 
participants and had been judged safe and ef-
fective by a very rigorous and very public FDA 
process, is just breathtaking. 
Meanwhile, Mr. Speaker, among the more 
than 200 Republican amendments to the 
pending legislation that the Democrat leader-
ship rejected, was a proposal to increase 
funding for CDC COVID vaccine activities by 
$2 billion and earmarking $1 billion of that for 
teachers 
and 
school 
personnel. 
Another 
amendment would have earmarked $10 bil-
lion—out of $46 billion—for testing for teach-
ers and school personnel. That too was re-
jected. 
Prioritizing teacher vaccinations will likely 
help keep teachers COVID–19 free and get 
the schools open. 
According to the Congressional Budget Of-
fice, only about 5 percent of the school money 
designated for K–12 in the new bill will actu-
ally be distributed in 2021—the rest will be 
spent in the outyears, between 2022 and 
2028. 
Earlier this month, our bipartisan group, the 
Problem Solvers Caucus, released the Defeat-
ing COVID–19 Vaccine Distribution Package 
with $160 billion for vaccines, testing, PPE, re-
building our National Strategic Stockpile and 
other efforts so that we can ensure that more 
people are protected. 
We asked the House leadership that these 
bipartisan priorities be moved quickly and sep-
arately. That didn’t happen. 
Finally, in a radical departure from all pre-
vious COVID–19 relief laws—the bill before us 
today mandates taxpayer funding for abortion 
on demand. 
Today, the Rules Committee refused to 
allow a vote on the McMorris Rogers-Foxx- 
Walorski amendment—cosponsored by 206 
members—to ensure that taxpayers aren’t 
forced to subsidize abortion. 
Mr. Speaker, in his inauguration speech, 
President Biden said that the dream of justice 
for all will be deferred no longer. 
The noble dream of justice for all however 
will never be achieved if a whole segment of 
society is legally ignored, trivialized, dehuman-
ized and discriminated against because of 
where they live—in their mothers’ wombs— 
and how small and defenseless they are. 
Where is the empathy for the battered baby- 
victim? 
The science of human development has not 
changed—and, thanks to ultrasound, unborn 
babies are now more visible than ever before. 
Growing numbers of Americans are shocked 
to learn that the methods of abortion include 
dismemberment of a child’s fragile body in-
cluding decapitation and that drugs like RU 
486 starve the baby to death before he or she 
is forcibly expelled from the womb. 
We know that by at least twenty weeks un-
born babies killed by abortion experience ex-
cruciating suffering and physical pain. And that 
until rendered unconscious or dead by these 
hideous procedures, the baby feels every cut. 
All that will be subsidized by taxpayers if 
this bill remains unchanged. 
Mr. Biden once wrote to constituents ex-
plaining his support for laws against funding 
for abortion by saying it would protect both the 
woman and her unborn child . . . I have con-
sistently—on no fewer than 50 occasions— 
voted against federal funding of abortion he 
said . . . those of us who are opposed to 
abortion should not be compelled to pay for 
them. 
I agree. 
According to public opinion polls most 
Americans agree as well—58% according to 
the most recent Marist poll—that taxpayers 
should not be compelled to fund abortion. 
Mr. Speaker, lives, as you surely know, 
have been saved by the Hyde Amendment. 
More than twenty peer reviewed studies show 
that more than 2.4 million people are alive 
today in the United States because of Hyde— 
with about 60,000 children spared death by 
abortion every year. 
Over 2.4 million people who would have 
been aborted instead survived because public 
funds were unavailable to effectuate their vio-
lent demise and their mothers instead bene-
fitted from prenatal healthcare and support. 
Abortion violence must be replaced with 
compassion and empathy for women and for 
defenseless unborn babies. We must love 
them both. 
These children need the President of the 
United States and Members of Congress to be 
their friends and advocates—not powerful ad-
versaries. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support 
of the American Rescue Plan. 
Earlier this week we reached a grim mile-
stone. More than half a million people have 
lost their lives to the coronavirus pandemic, 
which is the greatest public health and eco-
nomic crisis of our generation. Families are 
struggling to put food on the table, to stay in 
their homes, to find good paying jobs and af-
fordable childcare. 
Facing this continued urgency, we have a 
duty to pass real relief for the American peo-
ple. This package makes long overdue invest-
ments to expedite vaccine production and dis-
tribution, and it meets this moment by deliv-
ering substantial financial relief to working 
families, including an expanded and fully re-
fundable Child Tax Credit. 
The hour may be dark, but we can be the 
light forward. We must be. I urge my all my 
colleagues to pass this rescue plan. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of Section 1001 of the American Recov-
ery Plan Act of 2021. This section provides 
necessary resources to strengthen food and 
agriculture supply chains that have been rav-
aged by COVID–19 and provides $300 million 
to allow the U.S. Department of Agriculture to 
conduct surveillance of animals that are sus-
ceptible to SARS–CoV–2, the virus that 
causes COVID–19. 
As a physician, making sure we approach 
this and future pandemics from a One Health 
perspective is key for both human and animal 
health, and as a Member of the Agriculture 
Committee, I am personally invested in mak-
ing sure USDA has adequate resources to do 
their part. We have already seen documented 
evidence of a strain of COVID–19 impacting 
people in Europe that matches a strain that 
has been documented in captive mink. We 
cannot ignore the One Health implications of 
this pandemic. 
The resources provided in this section will 
help ensure USDA can follow science-based 
international surveillance recommendations. I 
look forward to working with the Department of 
Agriculture to fully implement these provisions, 
because this is how we can stay one step 
ahead as this virus evolves, and also how we 
can detect the next virus that jumps from ani-
mal to human before it becomes a pandemic. 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, in the 
traumatic year since the COVID–19 pandemic 
attacked our country and the world, countless 
families have experienced heart shattering 
personal losses. 
Parents, children, friends, neighbors, and 
colleagues have lost their lives fighting the 
virus. Businesses have shuttered, schools 
have closed, and our way of life with family 
and friends has nearly disappeared. 
President Biden’s American Rescue Plan is 
a courageous and positive step to address the 
destructive tragedy of the coronavirus pan-
demic. 
I applaud my democratic colleagues who 
crafted this bold and unprecedented response 
in support of the American people. 
I am proud to vote for the American Rescue 
Plan on behalf of my constituents and the na-
tion as a whole. 
This bill will provide individuals and families, 
including those of mixed status, with an eco-
nomic impact payment of $1,400 dollars to 
help pay for essentials such as food, utilities, 
rent, medicine and other life-saving essentials. 
This bill will ensure unemployed workers 
can continue to receive unemployment bene-
fits during our emergency economic shut 
down. And it will ensure the continuation of 
critical food assistance for those in need. 
The legislation also will provide much need-
ed assistance to homeowners struggling to 
make their mortgage payment and it provides 
resources to help families pay their backrent 
to prevent eviction and homelessness. 
And finally, The American Rescue Plan, rec-
ognizes the dignity of work by raising the na-
tional minimum wage to 15 dollars an hour by

2025. This wage increase is critical to ensur-
ing all working families are earning a living 
wage to meet their most basic of needs. 
Beyond vital pocketbook issues, the legisla-
tion also reinforces the primary responsibility 
of our federal government to respond effec-
tively to the pandemic by activating the De-
fense Production Act to ensure a more prolific 
means by which to guarantee the materials we 
need to manufacture the vaccine and the 
hardware needed to inject it into the arms of 
individuals to prevent further spread of the 
virus. 
To address the weaknesses in our public 
health infrastructure’s ability to respond to the 
crisis, the legislation also provides funding to 
support critical community health centers, so 
vital to meet the health care needs of my con-
stituents and all residents of the United States. 
This pandemic is unlike anything our world 
has encountered in over a hundred years. 
This robust package is a testament to the 
strength of our country and its responsibility 
and ability to meet the challenge of any crisis. 
I heartily commend President Biden and my 
colleagues in the House and Senate who have 
worked so hard on behalf of the American 
people to address the catastrophic impact of 
the COVID–19 pandemic which has taken the 
precious lives of over 500,000 Americans. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I raise my voice 
today to add my support for the steps taken 
by the House Agriculture Committee under the 
leadership of Chairman DAVID SCOTT to in-
clude provisions in H.R. 1319, the American 
Rescue Plan Act, to begin to correct the long 
and documented history of USDA discrimina-
tion against producers of color. 
The existence of this longstanding discrimi-
nation cannot be disputed. Every year, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture spends billions 
of dollars in programmatic and direct support 
for American producers and we know that 
those resources have, unfortunately, not been 
equitably distributed due to discrimination. The 
provisions included in sections 1005 and 1006 
of the American Rescue Plan Act are a tai-
lored approach towards correcting the wrongs 
felt by too many. 
I am not alone in raising my voice and sup-
port for these provisions. In addition to the 
support of many Members of the House Agri-
culture Committee and of the 117th Congress, 
more than 200 organizations have voiced their 
support for this language. Among those who 
have spoken out in support of these provisions

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a sen-
ior member of the Committees on the Judici-
ary, on Homeland Security, on the Budget, 
and as the Member of Congress for a con-
gressional district that has experienced the 
worst of the COVID–19 as a public health 
emergency and economic catastrophe, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 1319, the ‘‘American 
Rescue Plan Act of 2021,’’ which provides 
$1.9 trillion to take immediate and decisive ac-
tion to crush the virus and vaccinate our peo-
ple, build the economy back better, reopen 
schools, and provide needed support and as-
sistance to state and local governments that 
have been asked to do too much with too little 
for far too long. 
Mr. Speaker, by an overwhelming margin 
(72 percent), the public wants and is demand-
ing that we act to provide more economic re-
lief to address the damage caused by the 
coronavirus pandemic. 
Nearly two-thirds (65 percent) of Repub-
licans and Republican-leaning independents 
believe an additional relief package is nec-
essary, while more than nine in ten (92 per-
cent) Democrats and Democratic leaners say 
more coronavirus aid will be needed. 
Even the most conservative Republicans 
favor more relief by a 56 percent–44 percent 
margin. 
Nearly nine-in-ten of all adults (88 percent) 
in lower-income households say an additional 
package is necessary, while 81 percent of Re-
publicans in lower-income households (81 per-
cent) say additional aid is needed now. 
The American Rescue Plan Act delivers that 
aid and does it in a way that will crush the 
coronavirus and build the economy back bet-
ter. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put chil-
dren safely back in schools with a strong $170 
billion investment and putting money in work-
ers’ pockets by raising the federal minimum 
wage. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put food 
on the table, by expanding the SNAP program 
and respecting Black family farmers. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put peo-
ple back to work by prioritizing funding for 
transit, airlines and airports, and the disaster 
relief fund. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put 
small businesses back on track with robust 
funding for EIDL and restaurant grants, addi-
tional funding for shuttered live venues and 
expanded PPP eligibility for nonprofits. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put a 
priority on protecting renters and homeowners, 
preventing homelessness, and providing $10 
billion for the Defense Production Act to pro-
cure essential medical supplies and equip-
ment. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will put 
money in people’s pockets, with direct pay-
ments, Unemployment Insurance, Child Tax 
Credit, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and in-
cludes pension security and expanded Afford-
able Care Act coverage. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will provide 
$17 billion in critical funding to help the VA 
meet the health and economic security of vet-
erans, especially as it relates to the benefits 
claims and appeals backlog caused by 
COVID–19. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will produce 
and distribute the vaccine to test, treat and 
protect all Americans, including communities 
of color. 
The American Rescue Plan Act will provides 
desperately needed funding for our heroes— 
health care workers, first responders, sanita-
tion, transportation and food workers, and 
teachers—in states, localities, tribes, and terri-
tories. 
Finally, and very importantly, the American 
Rescue Plan Act establishes the Coronavirus 
Local Fiscal Recovery Fund and provides 
$45.570 billion the legislation provides in direct 
funding to major metropolitan cities and local 
governments. 
In my home state of Texas, metropolitan cit-
ies are estimated to receive $10.327 billion in 
direct coronavirus relief funding, while the 
state of Texas is slated to receive $16.824 bil-
lion, for an estimated $27.152 billion total to 
the state of Texas. 
During the Budget Committee markup, I pro-
posed, and the Committee agreed that any ef-
fort to strip or reduce this vital funding is to be 
rejected so major metropolitan cities, like 
Houston, receive the direct COVID–19 relief 
funding desperately needed to battle the 
coronavirus, restore critical services to strug-
gling families, and help save the jobs of es-
sential public servants like teachers, fire-
fighters, and other first responders. 
Let me discuss briefly why direct funding to 
major metropolitan cities and counties is so 
critical. 
The purpose of providing for direct payment 
to major metropolitan cities like Houston and 
counties like Harris County, as opposed to the 
County having to receive an allocation from 
the State, is so that the local governments, 
who are in the best position to identify and re-
spond, will be able to tailor the funding to 
meet the urgent needs of their communities. 
For example, under the direct payment pro-
visions in the CARES Act, Harris County re-
ceived more federal funding relative to the 
amount that would have been received 
through the State program and had the flexi-
bility needed for more efficient use of this 
funding, which was a concern voiced even by 
State leaders over the restrictive way that the 
State of Texas distributed CARES Act funding. 
By directly allocating funding to metropolitan 
cities and areas like Houston and Harris 
County, local authorities were and can work 
with the community to determine the specific 
needs of Harris County residents. 
As a result, Harris County Commissioners 
Court approved, for example, the following 
programs 
to 
directly 
address 
community 
needs, and to get money into the hands of 
residents quickly: 
1. Commissioners Court funded Community 
Programs 
2. Census Services 
3. Childcare Assistance Program 
4. Court Evictions Services 
5. COVID 19 Workforce Development Pro-
gram 
6. Direct Assistance Programs 
7. Domestic Violence Assistance Fund 
8. Rental Assistance Programs 
9. Small Business Loan Program (LEAP) 
10. Small Business Relief Fund 
11. Small Cities Support 
12. Student Digital Services 
13. UT Health Community Spread Survey 
Program 
Without direct payments to major metropoli-
tan cities, state governments—as we saw here 
in Texas—would not have permitted CARES 
Act funding to be used to create or support 
any of these programs. 
In addition, without direct payments to major 
metropolitan cities and government units, 
states invariably will succumb to the tempta-
tion to place onerous conditions on funding 
over and above those required by the Federal 
government. 
For example, in Texas, only $55 per capita 
was allocated to non-direct allocation entities, 
instead of the $174.49 per capita that was al-
located to them by Congress. 
Additionally, only 20 percent of the alloca-
tion made available immediately to local enti-
ties instead of making 100 percent of the allo-
cation available immediately. 
Third, direct funding is necessary to prevent 
state governments from creating specific cat-
egories limiting eligibility for medical expenses, 
public health expenses, payroll expenses for 
employees in the fields of public safety, public 
health, health care, human services, or whose 
services are substantially dedicated to miti-
gating or responding to the COVID–19 public 
health emergency. 
Without direct payments to major metropoli-
tan cities, state governments, again as we 
have seen in Texas, will limit recovery for ex-
penditures to support actions to facilitate com-
pliance with COVID–19 related public health 
measures or associated with the provision of 
economic support in connection with the 
COVID–19, or other COVID–19 related ex-
penses reasonably necessary to the function 
of government that satisfy the fund’s eligibility 
criteria. 
I would urge my Republican colleagues to 
heed the words of Republican Governor Jim 
Justice of West Virginia who said colorfully 
just a few days ago, ‘‘At this point in time in 
this nation, we need to go big. We need to 
quit counting the egg-sucking legs on the 
cows and count the cows and just move. And 
move forward and move right now.’’ 
The same sentiment was expressed more 
eloquently by Abraham Lincoln in 1862 when 
he memorably wrote: 
The dogmas of the quiet past are inad-
equate to the stormy present. The occasion is 
piled high with difficulty, and we must rise with 
the occasion. As our case is new, so we must 
think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall 
ourselves, and then we shall save our country. 
Mr. Speaker, the bipartisan action we took 
last December was a step in the right direction 
but only a long-delayed down payment; we 
cannot afford any more delays, especially 
since Republican stalling already caused a 
painful lapse in critical unemployment assist-
ance last year, and additional unemployment 
assistance is set to expire on March 14, 2021. 
That is why the American Rescue Plan Act 
is absolutely crucial and the right thing to do 
and to do right now. 
The American Rescue Plan Act proposed by 
President Biden, takes a multiprong approach 
to tackling the public health and economic cri-
ses stemming from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
No one is better prepared or more experi-
enced to lead the American rescue that Presi-
dent Biden, who as Vice-President oversaw

the implementation of the Recovery Act, which 
saved millions of jobs and rescued our econ-
omy from the Great Recession the Obama Ad-
ministration and the nation inherited from a 
previous Republican administration. 
And let us not forget that President Obama 
also placed his confidence in his vice-presi-
dent to oversee the rescue of the automotive 
industry, which he did so well that the Amer-
ican car industry fully recovered its status as 
the world leader. 
Mr. Speaker, to crush the virus and safely 
reopen schools, the American Rescue Plan 
Act will mount a national vaccination program 
that includes setting up community vaccination 
sites nationwide and makes the investments 
necessary to safely reopen schools. 
It will also take complementary measures to 
combat the virus, including scaling up testing 
and tracing, addressing shortages of personal 
protective equipment and other critical sup-
plies, investing in high-quality treatments, and 
addressing health care disparities. 
The American Rescue Plan Act delivers im-
mediate relief to working I families bearing the 
brunt of the crisis by providing $1,400 per per-
son in direct cash assistance to households 
across America, bringing the total (including 
the $600 down payment enacted in Decem-
ber) to $2,000. 
Additionally, the plan will also provide direct 
housing and nutrition assistance to families 
struggling to get by, expand access to safe 
and reliable child care and affordable health 
care, extend and expand unemployment insur-
ance so American workers can pay their bills, 
and give families with children as well as 
childless workers a boost through enhanced 
tax credits. 
Mr. Speaker, the American Rescue Plan Act 
provides much needed support for commu-
nities struggling with the economic fallout, in-
cluding hard-hit small businesses, especially 
those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and 
ethnic backgrounds that have experienced 
systemic discrimination. 
Finally, the plan also provides crucial re-
sources to protect the jobs of first responders, 
frontline public health workers, teachers, tran-
sit workers, and other essential workers that 
all Americans depend on. 
Mr. Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic, as 
did the videos of the unjustified killings of 
George Floyd, Breanna Taylor, Ahmed Arbrey, 
and so many others, laid bare for the nation 
to see the stark racial and ethnic inequalities 
exacerbated by the virus. 
In my home state of Texas, as of the end 
of September 2020, there have been more 
than 760,000 cases of COVID–19 and 16,000 
deaths. 
According to the Texas Department of State 
Health Care Services, 70 percent of the con-
firmed fatalities were people of color. 
In Texas, COVID–19 mortality rates are 30 
percent higher for African Americans and 80 
percent higher for Hispanics overall. 
The differences become much larger when 
accounting for age; for example, in the 25 to 
44-year-old age group, African American mor-
tality rates are more than four times higher 
than White rates, and the Hispanic rates are 
more than seven times higher. 
One factor in Hispanic and African American 
populations being more likely to contract 
COVID–19 is employment in occupations as-
sociated with public contact and that cannot 
be done remotely. 
The sad fact is that most workers in these 
occupations are less able to be absent from 
their job or to have paid time off. 
In Texas, people of color are more than 40 
percent of cashiers, retail salespersons, child 
care workers, licensed practical nurses, more 
than 50 percent of bus drivers and transit 
workers, medical and nursing assistants, per-
sonal care aides, and home health aides, and 
more than 60 percent of building cleaners and 
housekeepers. 
In addition, Hispanic and African American 
populations in Texas are less likely to have 
health insurance and to have a regular health 
care provider, so less likely to seek or receive 
early care for symptoms, especially in the first 
months of the epidemic. 
And African American and Hispanic popu-
lations are also more likely to have an under-
lying health condition that makes them more 
vulnerable to the effects of COVID–19. 
To respond and mitigate the devastation 
wrought by COVID–19 on Americans, and es-
pecially marginal and vulnerable communities 
of color, I have introduced H.R. 330, the ‘‘De-
livering COVID–19 Vaccinations to All Regions 
and Vulnerable Communities Act’’ or ‘‘COVID– 
19 Delivery Act,’’ which I invite all Members to 
join as sponsors. 
Under the COVID–19 Delivery Act, FEMA 
will be authorized and directed to lead the ef-
fort for vaccine delivery from the receipt from 
manufacturing facilities to delivery to des-
ignated inoculation sites (hospital, clinic, doc-
tors’ offices, school, places of worship, com-
munity centers, parks, or neighborhood gath-
ering locations. 
The legislation directs FEMA to develop and 
deploy a fully staffed and resourced 24–7 ad-
vanced real-time tracking system that allows 
FEMA to monitor shipments of vaccine units 
that can provide end-to-end transparency on 
the temperature, real-time location, origin, and 
destination data, anticipated time of arrival, 
and report on changes and update recipients 
on the progress of their delivery and report on 
changes that may impact expected delivery or 
the viability of the vaccine while in transit. 
FEMA will provide an advanced communica-
tion system that allows public health depart-
ments to communicate their vaccine readi-
ness, capability of receiving vaccines, delivery 
locations, details of facility capability of storing, 
securing, personnel authorized to receive de-
liveries, logistics for delivering vaccines to pa-
tients, report on vaccine receipts, condition of 
vaccines, patient reactions, feedback on how 
to improve the process. 
H.R. 330 authorizes FEMA to secure trans-
portation for delivery or use of vaccines, and, 
when requested, security for the vaccine deliv-
ery sites or inoculation locations to ensure the 
life and safety of personnel and patients who 
seek to provide or receive vaccinations are 
free of interference or threat. 
Finally, the COVID–19 Delivery Act directs 
FEMA to conduct public education and patient 
engagement through the provision of inocula-
tions of persons in areas and locations where 
vulnerable populations are under performing in 
getting vaccinations. 
Mr. Speaker, I see the disparities in the 
lives of so many of my constituents who suffer 
disproportionately from medical conditions that 
make COVID–19 deadly. 
They work low wage or no wage jobs to 
make ends meet, and they have no health in-
surance and rely on community health centers 
or public health services for routine care. 
I call them friends and neighbors because 
they are that to me. 
No one is benefiting from the COVID–19 
economy. 
The U.S. poverty rate has grown at a his-
toric rate over the past five months, with 7.8 
million Americans falling into poverty after the 
expanded $600 a week in unemployment as-
sistance expired at the end of July. 
This represents the greatest increase since 
the government began tracking poverty sixty 
years ago. 
In the city of Houston, nine key service sec-
tors, accounting for 70 percent of all jobs, 
hemorrhaged more 1,343,600 jobs, which to 
average folks is another way of saying that 
more than 1.34 million persons lost their liveli-
hoods. 
Houston workers lost jobs in the following 
areas: 
Healthcare: 391,000; Retail: 393,600; Food 
services: 267,000; Finance: 166,000; Private 
Education: 63,400; Arts and Entertainment: 
37,400; Accommodations: 28,700; Air Trans-
portation: 20,200; Other Services: 115,800. 
In addition to these positions, jobs were also 
lost in other areas, the largest of which was 
the construction industry, which shut down 
30,700 jobs. 
Professional and business services fol-
lowed, with 25,300 jobs lost, although 13,900 
were in temporary and provisional jobs in em-
ployment services; upstream oil lost 12,300 in 
March/April; and non-oil manufacturing lost 
7,700 jobs. 
Americans out of work due to COVID–19 
have generated 86 million jobless claims, with 
new claims being filed in recent weeks topping 
800,000. 
Millions of Americans who lost their jobs 
during the pandemic have fallen thousands of 
dollars behind on rent and utility bills, a clear 
warning sign that people are running out of 
money for basic needs. 
If this is not enough evidence of what is 
happening just look at the miles of vehicles 
lined up outside of food distribution centers for 
assistance, we see nightly on our television 
screens and in our communities. 
Moody’s Analytics warned in November 
2020 that 9 million renters said they were be-
hind on rent, according to a Census Bureau 
survey. 
The Bureau of the Census reports that 
twenty-one percent of all renters are behind 
on their rent, of which twenty-nine percent are 
African American families and seventeen per-
cent are Hispanic households. 
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Philadelphia’s analysis of persons who were 
employed prior to the pandemic, 1.3 million of 
these households are now, on average of 
$5,400 in debt on rent and utilities, after the 
family breadwinners lost their jobs. 
The new COVID–19 relief legislation passed 
last week by Congress, and reluctantly but fi-
nally signed by President Trump restores un-
employment assistance, but cuts that assist-
ance from $600 a week to $300 a week with-
out consideration of the facts on the ground, 
which are that millions of Americans remain 
out of work due to COVID–19 public health 
policy, and have been without sufficient in-
come since August 1, 2020. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) reported that as of February 
23, 2021, 28.3 million cases of COVID–19, re-
sulting in more than 503,000 deaths, had been 
reported in the United States.

H852 
February 26, 2021 
What the costs will be to our nation from 
this destruction of lives and livelihoods have 
yet to be fully calculated. 
It is a tragedy that too many households 
who have lost a member to COVID–19 are 
struggling to accept these deaths, but it is also 
the friends, co-workers, business owners, pro-
fessionals, students, teachers, wives, hus-
bands, brothers, sisters, aunts, cousins, and 
grandparents who also are feeling these 
losses because someone that mattered to 
them is no longer here. 
Each of these lives impacted dozens of 
other lives, too many of whom were not al-
lowed to be present with them during their 
final moments on this earth, but whose suf-
fering is too often overlooked because we un-
duly preoccupy ourselves with only the imme-
diate family. 
I strongly support H.R. 1319, the American 
Rescue Plan Act of 2021 and urge all Mem-
bers to join me in voting for its passage.

LIMITATIONS OF FREEDOM 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I have twice in my life been denied 
passage at a wall or fence with both times 
being a limitation of freedom. 
On June 12, 1990, I was denied passage in 
Berlin at the Brandenburg Gate by an East 
German Communist guard directing me to 
Checkpoint 
Charlie 
at 
the 
junction 
of 
Friedrichstraβe. 
On February 25, 2021, I was denied pas-
sage in Washington at 2nd and C Street, 
which I have walked for 20 years, at a locked 
12-foot fence topped with razor wire until a 
courageous Capitol Police Officer arrived to 
unlock the gate for me to be released from 
Capitol Hill confinement. 
I appreciate the efforts of District of Colum-
bia Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON to 
prevent permanent fencing surrounding Cap-
itol Hill, which isolates legislators from con-
stituents. 
Unobtrusive security can be implemented 
and installed without abusing National Guard 
personnel who are dedicated in their service. 
As a 31-year Guard veteran and grateful 
Guard Dad of three members, I know firsthand 
of Guard commitment. 
In conclusion, God Bless our Troops and we 
will never forget September 11th in the Global 
War on Terrorism.

REMEMBERING BARBARA LUBIN 
HON. ANN KIRKPATRICK 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of my dear 
friend Barbara Lubin who passed away on 
February 6, 2021 at the age of 63 following a 
cancer diagnosis. No one knew Democratic 
politics in Arizona the way that she did, knowl-
edge that she put to good use at the Arizona 
Democratic Party in the role of Operations Di-
rector. Barb had an extensive career in politics 
including her own run for the Arizona Corpora-
tion Commission and her service as the direc-
tor of the Clean Elections Institute. 
Barb was warm, kind, always ready to share 
a story or a meal, and most of all incredibly 
funny. She and her mother first talked me into 
running for the legislature when we were all 
living in Flagstaff, and I feel so grateful to 
have been so close to her and her family

HONORING RON WRIGHT 
HON. MICHAEL T. McCAUL 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, on February 
7th, we were forced to say goodbye to my 
dear friend and fellow Representative, Ronald 
‘‘Ron’’ Wright. 
Throughout his long and distinguished ca-
reer in public service, Ron inspired all with an 
unshakeable drive to make his community a 
better place. Ron was a committed Texan 
through and through, and among those values 
he held most dear were those of integrity and 
hard work. 
Ron’s jobs over the years reflect this. He 
spent his early years milking cows—on the 
family dairy farm, then proceeded to 30 years 
in business, working in construction, media, 
sales, and management. But throughout his 
time in the private sector, Ron couldn’t quite 
shake a deeper desire to serve. He served on 
a number of boards and commissions, includ-
ing the Tarrant County Historical Commission, 
the Arlington Housing Authority Board of Com-
missioners, the Mansfield Education Founda-
tion board, the Arlington Sports Authority, and 
the Arlington Tomorrow Foundation. 
In 2000, Ron made the permanent switch to 
public service when he was elected to the Ar-
lington City Council. In this role, Ron fought to 
improve the lives of his fellow citizens. After 
serving 8 years on the City Council, Ron ac-
cepted an appointment to become the Tax As-
sessor-Collector of Tarrant County. He was 
later elected to a full term by the voters of 
Tarrant County, then re-elected to a four-year 
term in November 2016. 
In 2018, Ron was elected by the constitu-
ents of Texas’ 6th Congressional District to 
represent them in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives. In this capacity, Ron fought to 
improve the lives of his fellow North Texans, 
and he served as a Member of the Committee 
on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Edu-
cation and Labor. 
I had the opportunity to learn from Ron last 
Congress during our time on the Foreign Af-
fairs Committee. In my conversations with 
Ron, I was struck by his wit, charm, and readi-
ness to solve the problems affecting all Ameri-
cans. 
During his time in Congress—Ron, famous 
for his impeccable taste in bow ties, began 
every day with a smile on his face. He worked 
with everyone, looking past the bounds of 
party lines in his desire to find solutions for the 
American people. In 2019, Ron was diag-
nosed with lung cancer. In the face of this 
challenge Ron did not balk but maintained a 
rigorous work schedule and inspired us all 
with his fortitude and lasting sense of humor. 
Ron was a fighter, a proven conservative, 
and a true statesmen. The citizens of Texas’ 
6th District have lost a leader and we here in 
Congress have lost a dear friend. My heart 
goes out to Ron’s wife, Susan, their three chil-
dren, and their nine grandchildren. Ron Wright 
was a warrior, and someone who passionately 
fought for his constituents, for Texas, and for 
America—he will be missed.

REINTRODUCTION OF THE RESO-
LUTION 
EXPRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR THE DESIGNATION OF THE 
LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY EACH 
YEAR AS ‘‘RARE DISEASE DAY’’ 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to reintroduce this resolution with my 
colleague Rep. RICHARD HUDSON of North 
Carolina. Our resolution supports the designa-
tion of Rare Disease Day on the last day of 
February. I am pleased that this resolution has 
been endorsed by the National Organization 
for Rare Disorders (NORD) and am thankful 
for its leadership on these critical issues over 
many years. 
Nearly one in ten Americans live with one or 
more of the roughly 7,000 known rare dis-
eases. More than half of those struggling with 
rare diseases—defined as affecting less than 
200,000 people—are children. Sadly, many 
rare diseases and conditions are serious, life- 
threatening, and lack effective treatments. 
These are not just statistics: I am sure most 
of us know at least one family member or 
friend who has been affected by or struggled 
with the unique challenges of rare diseases. 
Moreover, as we observe Black History 
Month, it’s important to know that African 
Americans and other minorities are especially 
vulnerable to rare diseases, including Sickle 
Cell Anemia and Sarcoidosis. These diseases 
and conditions—including Thalassemia and 
Hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis—dis-
proportionately affect African Americans. De-
spite these unique obstacles, African Ameri-
cans have an inspiring tradition of both com-
batting rare diseases and improving medical 
science. 
One great example is Dr. Charles Drew, an 
African American scientist who helped found 
the modem ‘‘blood bank,’’ which helped dra-
matically expand blood transfusions. A faculty 
member at Howard University, Dr. Drew’s pio-
neering work in blood transfusions took place 
against the backdrop of segregation and dis-
crimination. During his time overseeing the 
Red Cross’s blood plasma donation program, 
Dr. Drew was prohibited from donating his 
own blood because of the color of his skin. 
Despite these obstacles, Dr. Drew’s work im-
proved the practice of blood transfusions, 
which is now a lifeline for many individuals 
struggling today with rare diseases. The ex-
amples of Dr. Drew and countless other re-
searchers, physicians, nurses, activists, and

patients underscore the importance of bringing 
additional awareness to rare diseases. 
Despite 
the 
many 
challenges, 
some 
progress has been made. More than 840 
drugs and biologics have been approached by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
the treatment of rare diseases. However, Con-
gress must do more to combat rare diseases. 
In addition, more work needs to be done to 
bring attention to the needs of those who 
struggle with rare diseases, and to celebrate 
their courage. That’s why Rep. HUDSON and I 
are reintroducing this important resolution. 
Each year, many individuals with rare dis-
eases and their loved ones celebrate Rare 
Disease Day to share their stories and edu-
cate communities of researchers, health pro-
fessionals, governments, and community orga-
nizations about how rare diseases affect them. 
In 2019, more than 100 countries observed 
Rare Disease Day. Our resolution expresses 
support for the designation of the last day of 
this month as Rare Disease Day. Congress 
should recognize this work and improve our 
efforts to address the challenges facing the 
rare disease patient community. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join us in supporting Rare Disease Day’s des-
ignation on the last day of February to better 
champion people with rare diseases. I urge 
the House to support this resolution.

HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
EASTERN CARL, JR. 
HON. BRIAN BABIN 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of a community leader and 
friend, Robert Eastern Carl, Jr., who passed 
away on Saturday, February 20, 2021, at the 
age of 90. Robert was a longtime resident of 
Tyler County and had the respect of all who 
knew him. 
Robert was born on July 17, 1930, in Cam-
den, Texas, to Estelle Miller Carl and Robert 
Eastern, Sr. As a young adult, he was called 
to aid his country in the United States Army 
and fought in the Korean War. Following his 
time in the military, he returned to Tyler Coun-
ty and went to work as a rigger for Texaco. 
While employed by Texaco, he dutifully served 
as Board President of the Texaco Credit 
Union for 15 years. After his years of service, 
he began his well-deserved retirement. Robert 
was the man to call whenever you needed 
anything fixed. No matter who called, he never 
hesitated to come to the aid of his fellow man. 
Robert was devoted to his family and loved 
the Lord with all his heart, soul, and mind. He 
was a faithful member of First Baptist Church 
of Woodville and a dedicated deacon for many 
years. In his spare time, he also enjoyed hunt-
ing and fishing with friends and loved ones. 
Robert is survived by the love of his life and 
wife of 66 years, Gay Carl of Woodville; 
daughter, Debbie Darville and husband, Roy, 
of Marshall; sons, Keith Carl and his wife, Lori, 
of Port Neches and Kevin Carl and his wife, 
Peggy, of Buna; brother, James Carl of 
Nederland; sisters, Eunice Vinson of Chester 
and Ann Adkinson and her husband, Ira, of 
Porter; grandchildren, Brian Darville, Andrew 
Darville and his wife, Heather, Mattie Riu and 
her husband, Tim, Michael Carl and his wife, 
Laura, Alison Carl, Emily Carl, Amy Tallerita 
and her husband, Beau, Zachary Carl and his 
wife, Channing, Seth Carl, Chloe Carl, Sophie 
Carl, Jonathan Carl and his wife, Jessica, and 
Matthew Carl and his wife, Melissa; great 
grandchildren, Kyson Darville, Blake Darville, 
Emerald Riu, Felix Riu, Annette Carl, and 
Charlotte Carl; and special friend, Jimmy 
Telford. He is preceded in death by his par-
ents, Robert and Estelle Carl; brother, Earnest 
Lee Carl; and sisters, Joyce Best and Rita 
Chandler. 
Madam Speaker, I honor my friend Robert 
Eastern Carl, Jr., for his faithful service to his 
community. My thoughts and prayers remain 
with his family and friends during this difficult 
time.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
ELRETA 
MELTON 
ALEX-
ANDER-RALSTON 
HON. G.K. BUTTERFIELD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, in 
celebration of Black History Month, I rise today 
to recognize the life and legacy of Elreta 
Melton Alexander—an educator, barrier break-
er, civil rights advocate, and renowned officer 
of the court. She was the first Black woman in 
North Carolina to be licensed and practice as 
a lawyer, to argue before its Supreme Court, 
and to be elected a judge. 
Elreta Narcissus Melton was born on March 
21, 1919, in the small eastern North Carolina 
town of Smithfield. Her father, Joseph C. 
Melton, a Baptist minister and teacher, and 
her mother, Alian A. Reynolds Melton, a 
schoolteacher, had strong beliefs about the 
importance of education and refused to per-
petuate the narratives of racial injustice. The 
family later moved to Greensboro, North Caro-
lina, where in 1937, at the age of eighteen, 
Alexander graduated from North Carolina Agri-
cultural & Technical College, now North Caro-
lina Agricultural and Technical State Univer-
sity, with a Bachelor of Science degree in 
music. Upon graduation, she became a high- 
school teacher in South Carolina where she 
taught music, math, and history. 
Encouraged by a Greensboro minister, Alex-
ander decided to attend law school and pur-
sue a legal career. Because of the limitations 
for Black student admittance into Law schools 
in North Carolina, Alexander applied and was 
the first Black woman admitted to Columbia 
Law School in 1943 at the age of twenty-four, 
and became the first Black woman to graduate 
from Columbia Law School in 1945. In 1947, 
after passing the North Carolina bar exam, 
Alexander became the first black woman to 
practice law in North Carolina. After estab-
lishing a large solo criminal practice in 
Greensboro, Alexander formed one of the first 
integrated law firms in the South, Alston, Alex-
ander, Pell & Pell. During her career as a trial 
attorney, she added to her list of ‘‘firsts’’ when 
she became the first Black woman to argue 
before the Supreme Court of North Carolina. 
On December 2, 1968, Alexander became 
the first Black judge elected in North Carolina 
and the first Black woman in the United States 
to be elected district court judge. Alexander 
was re-elected in 1972, 1976 and 1980. One 
of her most notable accomplishments as a 
District Court Judge was her innovative juve-
nile sentencing approach called ‘‘Judgment 
Day’’, which focused on rehabilitating young 
offenders and misdemeanants as an alter-
native to sentencing. Judge Alexander ran for 
the Republican nomination for the Chief Jus-
tice position on the North Carolina Supreme 
Court in 1974. Battling persistent racism in the 
state, she lost the election to a White man 
named James Newcomb, a fire extinguisher 
salesman with no college degree or legal 
background. However, her loss prompted a 
later-adopted constitutional amendment requir-
ing judges to first be attorneys licensed in 
North Carolina before they can rightfully hold 
the position as judge. Her presence in the 
courtroom brought about great change and 
needed perspective; however, she did not win 
every battle and every election. Despite the 
perception of defeat, the barriers that Alex-
ander faced laid the groundwork and opened 
doors for a better tomorrow. 
While Alexander faced many challenges 
throughout her educational pursuit and legal 
career, she refused to let her circumstances 
define her destiny as she forged her own path 
led by her passion and conviction for justice 
and equality. 
On behalf of the United States House of 
Representatives and the people of the First 
District of North Carolina, I am proud to recog-
nize and celebrate the life and legacy of a true 
pioneer and Black History icon, Elreta Melton 
Alexander-Ralston.

HONORING THE CAREERS OF BILL 
AND JANE FOX 
HON. JOHN KATKO 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. KATKO. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Bill and Jane Fox of Fox Dealerships in 
Central New York as they settle into well-de-
served retirements. For nearly fifty years, Bill 
and Jane, siblings and co-owners of Fox Deal-
erships, have operated a thriving local busi-
ness and demonstrated great generosity and 
care for the community they serve. 
Growing up in Manheim, Pennsylvania, Bill 
and Jane gained an early appreciation for the 
automotive industry by spending their sum-
mers working with their father, a used car 
wholesaler. In 1976, Jane purchased her first 
auto dealership in Weedsport, New York, 
while her brother practiced law in Syracuse. 
Jane became one of the first female dealers in 
the Northeast and established herself as a 
leader in the industry. In 1979, Bill left his law 
firm to grow the family brand with the pur-
chase of a second dealership in Auburn, New 
York. Over 40 years, Bill and Jane expanded 
their business, owning as many as 14 dealer-
ships, and becoming a household name in 
Central New York. 
Across Central New York, the Fox family 
has also become well-known for philanthropy 
and investment in the community. Local 
schools, hospitals, and charities have all bene-
fited from both Bill and Jane’s time and re-
sources. The siblings have also always shared 
a strong commitment to hiring local workers 
and promoting them to senior positions.

HONORING OLIVIA SAMPLES AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize an outstanding member of our com-
munity, Olivia Samples, by nominating her as 
our Iowan of the week. Olivia is a certified 
doula and small business owner, focused on 
providing quality services to families as they 
prepare for prenatal, childbirth and postnatal 
care. Three years ago, Olivia read an article 
about the maternal health crisis and felt a 
deep calling to put her skills to good use. 
While Iowa has amongst some of the lowest 
stillbirth rates in the country, Black people are 
twice as likely to experience stillbirth than the 
general population. To put that into perspec-
tive, 1 in 121 Black people will experience a 
stillbirth as compared to the 1 out of 234 white 
people. The mortality rate is unfortunately just 
the tip of the iceberg when it comes to birthing 
and new parenting issues that face Iowa’s 
Black community. These stats along with the 
lower quality prenatal care that was being pro-
vided to Black women in the community in-
spired Olivia to become Iowa’s first Black 
doula. 
Olivia leads her business, Kismet Doula 
Services, with the mission to cultivate collec-
tive care and liberation to her clients through 
providing them a safe, loving environment to 
ensure they can become and remain healthy 
and well. Her services include prenatal, child-
birth, lactation consultation and postnatal sup-
port for her clients. However, Olivia goes 
above and beyond for her clients, going as far 
as to help with laundry, prepare meals for 
them and secure funds for those who need 
assistance purchasing necessary items for 
postnatal care and parenthood. She strives to 
make sure her services are accessible to all 
by providing mutual aid options, free services 
through certain organizations and will even 
barter or trade with her clients. 
Beyond providing direct support to her cli-
ents, Olivia also organizes workshops and 
partners with several community organiza-
tions. In her first few years as a doula, she re-
alized that the voices of new parents were 
missing when it came time to discuss legisla-
tion that would affect their well-being. As a re-
sult, Olivia organized the Celebration of Black 
Kin Conference for this April focusing on Black 
maternal well-being in our community. Olivia 
also 
gives 
back 
to 
the 
community 
by 
partnering with the Young Women’s Resource 
Center to provide free doula services as well 
as the Iowa Queer Communities of Color Coa-
lition to ensure all types of families are able to 
receive the quality pre and postnatal services 
they deserve. 
Olivia jumps in headfirst to solve the prob-
lem and gives it her all. The success of her 
business and the high praise from her commu-
nity reflect the significant impact she has had 
on the lives of pregnant people in Iowa. That’s 
why I would like my colleagues to rise with me 
and recognize this exemplary woman, Olivia 
Samples, as Iowan of the Week.

HONORING DR. CAROLYN PASS 
FOR BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Dr. Carolyn 
Pass was born in Lake Wales, Florida. She 
earned a B.S. in microbiology from the Univer-
sity of Florida and an M.D. from the University 
of Miami. She completed an internship and 
residency in internal medicine at the George 
Washington University. 
Her leadership spans more than 35 years 
beginning with serving as the president of the 
Minority PreProfessional Association at UF. As 
a medical student, she was a student health 
policy mentee in the late Senator Edward M. 
Kennedy’s office. Also, she served as presi-
dent and regional council member of the Stu-
dent National Medical Association. In her sen-
ior year she was awarded the highest honor 
bestowed at the University of Miami by being 
inducted into Iron Arrow Honor Society. 
Dr. Pass’ dedication to community began in 
2001 when she opened her primary care prac-
tice in Lake Wales. Before going into solo 
practice, she suffered from congestive heart 
failure and recuperated at home for 18 months 
after giving birth to her third child. 
Her dedication to providing quality care to 
her patients continued to flourish as she rose 
through the ranks of leadership at Advent 
Health Lake Wales. While on staff for the past 
20 years, she’s served on every committee 
and has been elected three times as chairman 
of medicine. Currently, she is serving as the 
first Black female chief of staff. 
Dr. Pass’ specialties include internal medi-
cine, wound care and hyperbaric medicine. 
Her passions are her three lovely children. 
Alexandra is a graduate student, and Nicholas 
and Christian are in college.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MR. 
RUSS THYRET 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, I rise to cele-
brate the life of Mr. Russ Thyret, who passed 
away at the age of 76 on February 12, 2021 
at his home in Valley Village, California. Over 
the course of thirty years, Russ rose through 
the ranks at Warner Bros. Records culmi-
nating in his serving as the Burbank-based la-
bel’s Board Chairman and Chief Executive Of-
ficer from 1995 to 2001. His wife, Rebecca, 
said that Russ’ message for his Warner family 
and for all who he had known over the years, 
‘‘he wants us all to be happy and to be good 
to each other.’’ 
Mr. Thyret, the son of a Glendale, California 
policeman, began his career in the music in-
dustry managing an independent retail store 
on the Sunset Strip. He joined Warner Bros. 
Records shortly thereafter, working at the 
company’s Burbank home office in a national 
sales role during the time Warner/Elektra/At-
lantic (WEA) Corporation opened branch oper-
ations throughout the country. In the mid-70s, 
Russ was selected to serve as Vice President 
and Director of National Promotion during the 
time Warner Bros. dominated the charts and 
became the dominant record company on the 
West Coast. 
Russ was named Board Chairman at War-
ner Bros. after a period of uncertainty after the 
departure of several senior executives. He 
sought to strengthen the record label with his 
unique business strategy and his undying pas-
sion for music. During his years heading the 
company’s promotion department, Russ led a 
small army of promotional personnel who 
worked to ensure records were played on the 
air on local, national, and international air-
waves. Mr. Thyret and his staff delivered 
countless hits by legendary artists such as: 
Fleetwood Mac, the Doobie Brothers, Randy 
Newman, James Taylor, Alice Cooper, Chaka 
Khan, R.E.M., ZZ Top, Depeche Mode, k.d. 
lang, John Fogerty, Madonna, and Prince. 
‘‘Thyret was a man of great instinct and 
heart,’’ as stated by Jackie Sallow with Warner 
Records. Russ will always be remembered for 
his personable spirit, tenacious mindset, and 
kind heart. In 2001, Mr. Thyret ended his ten-
ure after the completion of the AOL Time War-
ner merger. He summed up his time with the 
company stating, ‘‘My strongest ambition has 
always been to serve the artists well, and I 
leave Warner Bros. hoping I have accom-
plished that. I was in awe of Warner Bros. 
Records the first day I walked in the door, and 
in so many ways, I leave even more in awe. 
It will forever be a magical memory.’’ 
Mr. Russ Thyret will also be remembered 
for his love of his family, horses, fishing, and 
his great Labrador Retriever. He is survived by 
his wife Rebecca Alvarez and his son Russ 
Thyre, Jr.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
JUDGE HUGH SCOTT 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to celebrate the life of a trail-
blazer in the Western New York legal commu-
nity, Judge Hugh B. Scott. Judge Scott pos-
sessed a great legal mind and he will be sore-
ly missed by all those who loved and re-
spected him. 
Judge Hugh B. Scott defied societal atti-
tudes meant to restrict him and other African 
Americans to become the first Black federal 
judge in Western New York history. After he 
graduated as one of just three Black members 
of the Sweet Home High School class of 
1967, Judge Scott attended Niagara University 
and the University at Buffalo law school, once 
again as one of the few Black graduates, to 
make local legal history. 
Judge Scott made history as the first African 
American federal prosecutor and head of the 
state attorney general’s office in Buffalo. He 
served as a City Court judge for a decade be-
fore becoming the first Black federal judge in 
Western New York history in 1994.

February 26, 2021 
In an interview with the Buffalo News fol-
lowing his appointment, Judge Scott humbly 
remarked of his accomplishments, ‘‘I try not to 
talk of it in those terms. But yes, there have 
been a number of firsts in my life, and yes, I’m 
proud of it.’’ Judge Scott didn’t like to dwell on 
his accomplishments; he was always looking 
to contribute to more than his re´sume´. Though 
he often downplayed his own role in breaking 
down barriers and deflected credit for helping 
others do the same, that only added to Judge 
Scott’s authenticity, which was as noticeable 
in his courtroom as his gavel. 
Outside of the courtroom, Judge Scott’s 
presence was felt in the talks he gave to Buf-
falo kids who would benefit not just from his 
words but from the ceilings he broke through 
for the betterment of himself and for others. In 
addition to his informal community involve-
ment, he also served as a board member on 
the National Conference for Community and 
Justice and the Buffalo Urban League. The life 
member of the NAACP was connected to the 
fight for justice in his hometown, where he met 
his wife Trudy and raised two sons, while also 
committing to the same struggle in education 
and the legal profession. 
Madam Speaker, thank you for this time to 
honor the trailblazing legacy of Judge Hugh 
Scott. He embodied the passion, energy, and 
commitment to cause that makes Buffalo 
unique. We will forever be grateful for his out-
standing service and leadership. We extend 
our deepest sympathy to his wife, Trudy and 
his two sons and the many friends and family. 
I offer my thanks to Judge Scott for his incred-
ible contributions to the fabric of our commu-
nity and offer my condolences to his family for 
the passing of a man known to the legal sys-
tem as a judge but known to people as a hus-
band, father, trailblazer, and role model.

Mr. SIRES. Madam Speaker, our country is 
reeling from a pandemic that has left over half 
a million people dead, caused millions to lose 
their jobs, and forced millions more to stay 
home. Throughout the past year of strife, one 
group of people has carried the burden of the 
pandemic in order to protect our communities. 
Our nation’s first responders have continued

others. 
I applaud all the brave first responders in 
New Jersey’s 8th District; our brave police-
men, firefighters, and healthcare workers, but

volunteer ambulance corps marks their 50th

For 50 years the volunteers of this unit have 
served as a volunteer Emergency Manage-
ment Services (EMS) unit and have covered 
most of Hoboken’s calls for ambulance and 
EMS services. 
There are 150 volunteers in this corps, with 
10 ambulances and emergency vehicles field-
ing over 5,000 emergency calls each year, 
and over 400,000 total since their founding. 
Since the COVID–19 pandemic started, volun-
teers from the corps have been working tire-
lessly to continue providing emergency serv-
ices and transportation to the residents of Ho-
boken even in the face of a severe health cri-
sis. This exemplifies the commitment that 
these volunteers have to their community, 
striving to help others even when presented 
with grave challenges. 
The Hoboken Volunteer Ambulance Corps 
has maintained their commitment to excel-
lence prior to COVID–19 as well. In 2012, 
when the deadly superstorm Sandy ravaged 
most of New Jersey and the Northeast, the 
Corps jumped into action despite sustaining 
damage to their headquarters and multiple ve-
hicles. They helped evacuate patients from 
Hoboken University Medical Center, which 
was damaged by flooding, and establish a 
field hospital in the gym of Stevens Institute of 
Technology. 
These are two notable examples of the her-
oism displayed by the Hoboken Volunteer Am-
bulance Corps, but there are countless other 
stories outlining their positive impact on our 
community. As the corps celebrates 50 years 
of service, I commend them for the important 
work they do in our community. Hoboken, 
Hudson County, myself, and countless others 
across the 8th District thank them for their 
service and dedication, and look forward to 
the next 50 years of service they will provide 
to our grateful community.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF RUSSELL GRAY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the passing of a humble, loyal, 
and dedicated public servant, Russell Mason 
Gray of Sterling, Connecticut, who passed un-
expectedly, at age 76, on January 12, 2021. 
A resident and the First Selectman of the 
town of Sterling, Connecticut for 16 years, 
Russell prioritized the wellbeing of Sterling 
and its citizens above all else. Before being 
called to public service, Russell and his wife 
Sue dedicated themselves to their family dairy 
farm, and Russell, at his core was a farmer, 
with strong ties to his land. These ties created 
a natural transition to his election as First Se-
lectman in 2005. 
Russell’s steadfast leadership helped Ster-
ling, a small community of less than 4,000 
people, navigate the challenges of being a 
rural municipality. From building four new 
bridges in town and constantly inspecting 
roads—to facilitating the construction of the 
new Sterling Community School and moving 
the town offices and Library to the former 
Sterling Memorial School in Oneco—Russell 
was proactive in securing an efficient but ac-
cessible municipal infrastructure for the town 
of Sterling. Alongside his commitment to Ster-
ling, Russell was Chairman of the Windham 
County Soil and Water Conservation District, 
President of the Windham County Farm Bu-
reau, Advisor to Killingly High School Vo–Ag, 
Director of Patrons Mutual Insurance Com-
pany, President of the CT State Grange, 
County and Ekonk Community Granges, and 
Chairman of the Northeast Council of Govern-
ments. These commitments reflect only a por-
tion of Russell’s legacy and display not only 
Russell’s dedication to Sterling but to all the 
towns in Windham County. 
Russell’s love for his town and the people in 
his community is known to all he encountered. 
His fellow selectman Lincoln Cooper once 
said, ‘‘He was stubborn and loyal—he loved 
this town. He was a self-made man whose 
stubbornness led him to make good decisions 
for Sterling.’’ His former administrative assist-
ant, Joyce Gustavson, emphasized that for 
Russell—‘‘it was family first, then Sterling.’’ 
Everyone who worked close with Russell saw 
the passion in his daily work at the town hall 
and his willingness to go above and beyond 
for every resident. Losing Russell leaves a 
deep void in eastern Connecticut. 
Madam Speaker, knowing of Russell’s devo-
tion to the people of eastern Connecticut and 
Sterling and how diligently he served until his 
last breath, I can attest that his career rep-
resents the best of public service. I hope the 
chamber will join me in expressing the deep-
est condolences on behalf of the House of 
Representatives to the Gray family—his wife 
Sue; His children Rebecca, Mason, Deborah: 
and his grandchildren and great grandchildren. 
I hope this testament to Russell’s life serves 
as an acknowledgement of the immeasurable 
debt of gratitude owed to him by the American 
people.

REMEMBERING ALBERT HALE 
HON. ANN KIRKPATRICK 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mrs. KIRKPATRICK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of a former 
colleague and friend of mine, Albert Hale, who 
passed away February 2, 2021 at the age of 
70 following complications from COVID–19. 
Many in this chamber may not know who Al-
bert Hale was, but he helped build and advo-
cate for the Navajo Nation throughout his time 
in public service. As the Nation’s second 
president, he worked tirelessly to advocate for 
sovereignty of the Dine´, secure their rights, 
and address the needs of his constituents. As 
one of the first lawyers from the Nation, Mr. 
Hale was instrumental in advocating for the 
rights of the Dine´ and getting them the re-
sources they needed to thrive. 
Albert was a great friend of mine and an 
even greater leader for his community. We 
served together in the Arizona Legislature and 
his work consistently inspired me. I also fondly 
remember the Navajo Nation’s parades, where 
Albert would always fearlessly ride on horse-
back, while I and others would be nearby on 
foot. I want to extend my deepest condolences 
to Albert’s wife Paula, his daughters Sherri, 
Sheena, and Janelle, and his son Tony. Albert 
will be sorely missed, but his belief in and 
work for a brighter future in his community will 
endure.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. MICHAEL 
HAND 
HON. BRENDAN F. BOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Michael Hand before the United States House 
of Representatives in recognition of his retire-
ment as Assistant Executive Secretary-Treas-
urer of the Eastern Atlantic States Regional 
Council of Carpenters (EASRCC). Mr. Hand, a 
Philadelphia native, has led a remarkable ca-
reer defined by his ardent and diligent service 
to union members nationwide. 
Originally from the River Ward section of 
Philadelphia, commonly called the Flat Iron, 
Mr. Hand earned his start in the labor commu-
nity as member of Local Union 1050, serving 
on its Executive Board in numerous capacities 
for nearly 30 years. Prior to being appointed to 
his leadership role at the Eastern Atlantic 
States Regional Council of Carpenters, Mr. 
Hand served as one of the EASRCC’s Senior 
Area Managers, expertly assisting the organi-
zation and its 40,000 members in Delaware, 
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Wash-
ington, D.C., West Virginia, and 10 North 
Carolina counties. 
Throughout his accomplished and lengthy 
career as a skilled carpenter, Mr. Hand was 
involved in construction projects at some of 
Philadelphia’s most well-known institutions, in-
cluding at the University of Pennsylvania, the 
Philadelphia International Airport, Luken Steel, 
the Philadelphia Convention Center, and Lib-
erty II, among others. 
While Mr. Hand no longer resides in Phila-
delphia, he continues to selflessly give back to 
our community through his involvement with 
the ‘‘Carpenters Who Care’’ program, that 
helps carpenters struggling with addiction, and 
through his volunteer work with the Center of 
Support for Children’s Advocates and the So-
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to animals 
(SPCA). 
I wish Mr. Hand and his family the best in 
their future endeavors. Madam Speaker, I ask 
my colleagues to join me in extending our sin-
cerest appreciation to Michael Hand for his ex-
traordinary contributions to our society.

HONORING SADIE DELICATH AND 
HER 
OUTSTANDING 
CONTRIBU-
TIONS 
TO 
BLACK 
HISTORY 
MONTH 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, February 
is Black History month. This month, and every 
month, let us celebrate the Black Americans 
who built this nation, amplify the voices of 
those who continue to fight for a more just so-
ciety, and recommit to taking real action. We 
must remember that Black History is American 
History as we reflect on the people who have 
strengthened our nation. 
This past year, the fight for racial justice 
was especially important in wake of unspeak-
able tragedies like the murders of George 
Floyd and Breonna Taylor. People of all ages 
protested from coast to coast, calling for jus-
tice, saying enough is enough, and demanding 
change. I was particularly inspired by a group 
of young students led by Social Studies 
Teacher Nicole Clark, English Language Arts 
Teacher Monica Powell, and Inclusion Spe-
cialist Courtney Legg at Two Rivers Public 
Charter School in Washington, D.C.—where 
my granddaughter Sadie Delicath attends. 
During their recent school showcase they pre-
sented their ‘‘resistance poems’’ which I have 
shared with my colleagues in an e-booklet and 
posted to my website at: 
https://delauro.house.gov/sites/ 
delauro.house.gov/files/documents/ 
TwoRiversPoems.pdf. 
As Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ‘‘our lives 
begin to end the day we become silent about 
things that matter.’’ During these unprece-
dented times, where we are also struggling to 
combat a pandemic that is disproportionately 
affecting communities of color, we must have 
the courage to make meaningful change. It is 
clear that the young authors of these poems 
certainly have that courage. I was particularly 
inspired by their words, and I am confident 
that my colleagues in the Congress were as 
well. 
It is through their dedication and commit-
ment of young people—and that of so many 
others before them—we are able to continue 
this fight for equality, justice and opportunity 
today and for many years to come. 
I would like to share the poem written by my 
granddaughter Sadie. I am inspired by her 
every day: 
CHANGE NEEDS TO COME 
(By Sadie Delicath) 
Do you know what it’s like to be a Black 
person in America? 
’Cause I don’t. 
I don’t look at the tv and see another broth-
er, mother, daughter, or father hanging 
from a tree or getting shot in her sleep 
wondering if next time it will be me. 
Do you know what it’s like to be a white per-
son in America? ’Cause I do. 
When I see a cop car there are no butterflies 
dancing in my stomach or the sinking 
feeling something bad is going to hap-
pen. 
Is that how everyone feels, or just me? 
Do you know what it’s like to be a white per-
son in America? ’Cause I do. 
Having privilege because of the color of my 
skin, being protected by something I’m 
born in. 
History is a broken record, skips a couple of 
times, but always repeats itself. 
Our laws and our norms always find a way to 
keep racism around. 
Slavery led to Jim Crow and Jim Crow to po-
lice brutality 
We have the power to put an end to this pain, 
but Black people are silenced as if by 
thunderous rain. 
Denouncing racism is not enough, a black 
square is not enough, do you really 
care or is it just a bluff? 
Black Lives Matter is not a trend, we have 
to put racism to an end. 
INTRODUCTION OF THE PUBLIC 
BUILDINGS RENEWAL ACT OF 2021 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I introduced the Public Buildings Renewal Act 
of 2021. This legislation will spur private in-
vestment in public building infrastructure 
throughout the United States by creating $5 
billion in Private Activity Bonds for the devel-
opment of government-owned public buildings. 
Critically, this legislation intends that these 
bonds are compliant with Davis-Bacon labor 
standards. 
In every American community, there are se-
rious concerns about the condition of our 
schools, public hospitals, justice facilities, uni-
versities, and libraries. With state and local 
budgets becoming increasingly strained, offi-
cials have chosen to save money by steadily 
reducing capital investment in public buildings. 
But years of underinvestment have led to fa-
cilities that are inadequately maintained, fail to 
comply with current codes or disability require-
ments, and do not have adequate security— 
endangering the public. Throughout the coun-
try, the average public school building is at 
least 40 years old, and the current backlog of 
maintenance and repair projects adds up to 
more than $45 billion annually in unmet fund-
ing needs. It is past time that we upgrade our 
public buildings to provide a safe, modern, 
and efficient experience from coast to coast. 
Presently, the use of public-private partner-
ships to develop government owned public 
buildings is restricted because, unlike trans-
portation projects, public buildings are not cur-
rently eligible for Private Activity Bonds. This 
unnecessary 
impediment 
prevents 
public 
building from combining tax-exempt financing 
with private, taxable financing, resulting in 
lower project costs for our state and local gov-
ernments. The Public Buildings Renewal Act 
adds public buildings as a new class of 
projects eligible for financing with Private Ac-
tivity Bonds, allowing state and local govern-
ments to invest in public building infrastructure 
projects more easily. Once enacted, state and 
local governments would be able to enter 
long-term contracts with a private sector com-
pany to design, build, finance, and/or operate 
and maintain the building for a defined period. 
This legislation is intended to provide an addi-
tional financing option to state and local gov-
ernments looking to improve their public build-
ings, not be a panacea for all projects. 
We can no longer accept schools and hos-
pitals in disrepair, deferred maintenance, and 
delayed capital investment. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues in the House and 
Senate to include this legislation in an infra-
structure investment package.

after serving Maine communities as a Post-
master for three decades. 
Steve has dedicated his career to public 
service, serving in the U.S. Air Force before 
working twenty-two years as a Postmaster in 
Round Pond, then eight years in Rockport. As 
a public servant, Steve continuously went 
above and beyond, greeting each customer 
with a smile and good cheer. 
Steve’s retirement today is all the more re-
markable because he originally intended to re-
tire in March 2020. But as the world fell into 
chaos due to the COVID–19 pandemic, Steve 
made the courageous decision to stay on the 
job. Even though it meant working long days, 
a daily two-hour round-trip commute, and risk-
ing his safety, Steve refused to abandon his 
community during the most uncertain days of 
the pandemic. 
It is because of people like Steve that Maine 
has a reputation for being ‘‘the way life should 
be.’’ Our state is a much better place because 
of his vital work and his ability to form deep 
and trusting relationships with the people of 
Midcoast Maine. As he moves onto his next 
adventure, I wish him all the best.

REINTRODUCTION 
OF 
LEGISLA-
TION TO AWARD THE CONGRES-
SIONAL GOLD MEDAL TO HU-
MANITARIAN 
AND 
SPORTING 
LEGEND MUHAMMAD ALI 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. CARSON. Madam Speaker, as we mark 
Black History Month, I am proud to reintroduce 
legislation to award the Congressional Gold 
Medal to Muhammad Ali in recognition of his 
contributions to our nation. I believe it is long 
past time to recognize an American civil rights 
activist and sporting legend with Congress’ 
highest honor. Unfortunately, Congress failed 
to act before The Champ’s death in 2016, at 
the age 74, so I ask my colleagues to join me 
now in honoring an American hero. Over the 
course of his illustrious career, Muhammad Ali 
produced some of our nation’s most lasting 
sports memories. From winning a Gold Medal 
at the 1960 Summer Olympics, to lighting the 
Olympic torch at the 1996 Summer Olympics, 
his influence as an athlete and a humanitarian 
spanned over fifty years. 
Despite having been diagnosed with Parkin-
son’s disease in the 1980s, Ali devoted his life 
to charitable organizations. Ali, and his wife 
Lonnie, were founding directors of the Muham-
mad Ali Parkinson Center and Movement Dis-
orders Clinic in Phoenix, AZ and helped raise 
over $50 million for Parkinson’s research. In 
addition to helping families cope with illness, 
Ali led efforts to provide meals for the hungry 
and helped countless organizations such as 
the Make-A-Wish-Foundation and the Special 
Olympics. 
Muhammad Ali’s humanitarian efforts went 
beyond his charitable activities in the United 
States. In 1990 Muhammad Ali travelled to the 
Middle East to seek the release of American 
and British hostages that were being held as 
human shields in the first Gulf War. After his 
intervention, 15 hostages were freed. Thanks 
to his devotion to diplomatic causes and racial 
harmony, Ali was the recipient of many acco-
lades, including being chosen as a ‘‘U.N. Mes-
senger of Peace’’ in 1998 and receiving the 
Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005 from 
President Bush. 
Through his unyielding dedication to his 
sport and to struggling populations around the 
world, Muhammad Ali still serves an example 
of service and self-sacrifice for generations of 
Americans. The Congressional Gold Medal is 
a fitting commemoration of his life and work, 
for which he is deservingly known as ‘‘the 
Greatest.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join me in recognizing one of our nation’s 
most lasting and influential figures by signing 
on to this important legislation.

CONGRATULATING 
MR. 
ROBBIN 
KUDER FOR 50 YEARS OF SERV-
ICE AS A MINISTER AT NORTH-
WOODS CHURCH 
HON. DANIEL WEBSTER 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. WEBSTER of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
I am pleased to recognize Pastor Robbin 
Kuder, and his wife Gail for their lifelong com-
mitment to service in their community. This 
month, Pastor Kuder will retire after nearly a 
half-century of faithfully ministering to the resi-
dents of Tallahassee, Florida. It gives me 
great pleasure to recognize his and his wife 
Gail’s service to Floridians, including the Cen-
tral Florida community. 
Raised in Orlando, the son of a minister, 
Robbin’s commitment to service began in 
1971 when he joined the United States Navy, 
where he served as an Operation Specialist. 
Following his graduation from FSU School of 
Music Education, Robbin began serving as 
worship leader and minister at Northwoods 
Church. He has served here for 45 years, in-
cluding 16 years as youth minister. 
I first met Robbin as we were young men 
attending First Baptist Church of Pine Hills, 
Florida where Robbin’s dad Roger, served as 
music minister. As a newly elected member of 
the Florida Legislature, while in Tallahassee, I 
attended 
then 
University 
Heights 
Baptist 
Church where Robbin served. 
A man of quiet leadership, immense pa-
tience and quiet sense of humor, Robbin has 
devoted his life to sharing his passion for 
music and the love of Christ with people. 
When not at church, Robbin could be found 
cycling, sailing, hunting or fishing—usually 
joined by his beloved wife Gail, one of his 
seven children or 16 grandchildren. His adven-
turous spirit and patience are evident in the 
numerous cross-state cycling trips he orga-
nized and led to give Florida youths an outlet 
for both athletics and adventure, while bless-
ing churches with musical performances and 
service projects throughout the trip. Robbin 
and Gail are excellent examples for adults, 
parents, and young people for how to live a 
life of ministry. 
It is a privilege to congratulate and applaud 
Robbin and Gail for a lifetime service that has 
spanned 5 decades. May their character, life, 
and efforts inspire others to follow in their foot-
steps. 
RECOGNIZING 
BLACK 
HISTORY 
MONTH ESSAY CONTEST WINNER 
TOBI OJO 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
exemplary work of Tobi Ojo, an 11th grade 
student at Grassfield High School in Chesa-
peake, Virginia, and the high school winner of 
the Black History Month essay contest I 
hosted earlier this month. Ms. Ojo wrote a 
powerful 
essay 
on 
Stacey 
Abrams’ 
groundbreaking electoral successes and the 
exceptional work of African-American women 
across our nation. I am inspired by Ms. Ojo’s 
words, and I encourage young people across 
our country to reflect on what this month 
means to them. 
Since its creation less than 50 years ago, 
Black History Month has been a time to honor 
and reflect upon the remarkable achievements 
of the African-American community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Tobi Ojo’s exceptional work 
in celebration of Black History Month. 
February is the month to celebrate black 
history, accomplishments, and excellence. 
When thinking of historical figures who em-
body these ideologies, many individuals 
would mention Martin Luther King Jr. or 
Rosa Parks. If neither of these historical fig-
ures is mentioned most people would say an-
other popular African-American man. Black 
excellence in terms of African-American 
women is hardly recognized. One African- 
American lady who has been currently seen 
breaking societal expectations is politician 
and lawyer, Stacey Abrams. 
Mrs. Abrams broke history by being the 
first black woman to be a major party nomi-
nee for governor in the United States. She 
was a former liberal State House leader who 
wanted to change the historically conserv-
ative state of Georgia. Her campaign was 
centered on ‘‘the Georgia of tomorrow.’’ Al-
though she is not currently the governor of 
Georgia, no woman has ever come close to 
holding that position. Moreover, there has 
not been a governor position held by a black 
individual since the Reconstruction Era. 
Stacey Abrams is also a successful grad-
uate from Yale Law School. Outside of poli-
tics, Mrs, Abrams runs a small business and 
is a successful writer. Most of her successful 
books, such as Minority Leader: Lead From 
Outside and Our Time Is Now, center around 
her struggles and achievements in her life. 
These books inspire others like Mrs. Abrams 
to break societal standards set to hinder 
black lives in America. 
Instead of allowing her race and gender to 
become a hindrance, Mrs. Abrams continues 
to strive to make a change in the state of 
Georgia. Georgia has had a history of black 
representation in small positions but not in 
statewide positions. Abrams continues to 
work to improve black communities in Geor-
gia. One of her top priorities is to see more 
black women leaders in government posi-
tions (The New York Times 2021). 
Stacey Abrams is also a voting rights ac-
tivist who fights for Americans to have their 
voice heard through their votes. After seeing 
the massive mismanagement of Georgia’s 
2018 election, she decided to combat this 
problem. This was one of the reasons why she 
founded the Fair Fight. The Fair Fight helps 
educate voters on election reforms and advo-
cate for election reform on various govern-
ment levels. This organization promotes fair

elections by encouraging fair elections in 
Georgia. Fair Fight focuses on empowering 
the voices of minorities and diminishing 
voter suppression (About Fair Fight/Fair 
Fight’’ 2020). 
Fair Fights was one of the many organiza-
tions that Stacey Abrams founded. In 2019, 
Fair Count was created. Fair Count was es-
tablished to increase civic engagement in 
states and improve Census accuracy. An-
other organization that was created by 
Stacey Abrams is Southern Economic Ad-
vancement Project. The Southern Economic 
Advancement Project promotes public poli-
cies that improve economic power and in-
crease equity in the South. 
Stacey Abrams seeks to create change out-
side of Georgia and the United States. She is 
a member of former Secretary of State John 
Kerry’s World War Zero bipartisan coalition 
which tries to educate individuals on climate 
change. Stacey Abrams has met with politi-
cians in Taiwan, South Korea, Israel to bring 
about change on different issues worldwide 
(‘‘About Stacey Abrams/Fair Fight’’ 2021). 
Politician and writer, Stacey Abrams, has 
won awards that shine her accomplishments 
and works. She was a recipient of John F. 
Kennedy 
New 
Frontier 
Award. 
Stacey 
Abrams continues to break history day by 
day by fighting for those who do not have a 
voice and representation in government poli-
cies and positions.

TRIBUTE TO MR. EDWARD 
WILLIAM HILL 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise with respect to honor the life of 
Mr. Edward William Hill. 
Edward was born to the union of Johnnie 
Edward and Mary Frances Hill on November 
12, 1957 at Provident Hospital in Chicago, IL. 
His friends and family knew him as ‘‘Sput-
nik’’, a nickname given to him by his father as 
he was born after the launch of the world’s 
first space satellite. 
Edward accepted Christ at an early age, 
and was baptized at Vernon Baptist Church. 
He later became a member of Lilydale First 
Baptist Church, where he was a member for 
over 40 years. 
The Hill family built their first home in the 
Chatham area of Chicago, where Edward and 
his sisters attended John Marshall Harlan High 
School. During his time at Harlan, Edward was 
heavily involved in sports and community ac-
tivities, and in his senior year he was Prom 
King for the Harlan class of 1976. 
Edward matriculated to Morehouse College 
in Atlanta, GA where he earned his Bachelor 
of Arts Degree in Business Administration in 
1980. After graduating college, he attended 
Roosevelt University Chicago, where he re-
ceived his Master of Public Administration in 
1982 with a concentration in Health Adminis-
tration. 
He became a professional healthcare ad-
ministrator at various facilities throughout the 
City of Chicago, including, Executive Director 
of Provident Hospital, Manager of the Eye 
Care Physician & Surgeons of Illinois Ltd, Ad-

Known for his jokes and comical character, 
he was always the life of every party. He was 
a proud father, and one of his greatest joys 
was the birth of his son, Edward, Jr. 
Edward had a big heart and was a joy to his 
family and friends. He made his transition on

always reminded of these words in time of 
grief, ‘‘May the road rise to meet you. May the 
wind be always at your back. May the sun 
shine warm upon your face. And rains fall soft 
upon your fields. And until we meet again, 
May God hold you in the hollow of His hand.’’

BLACK HISTORY MONTH 
HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, February 
is Black History month. This month, and every 
month, let us celebrate the Black Americans 
who built this nation, amplify the voices of 
those who continue to fight for a more just so-
ciety, and recommit to taking real action. We 
must remember that Black History is American 
History as we reflect on the people who have 
strengthened our nation. 
This past year, the fight for racial justice 
was especially important in wake of unspeak-
able tragedies like the murders of George 
Floyd and Breonna Taylor. People of all ages 
protested from coast to coast, calling for jus-
tice, saying enough is enough, and demanding 
change. I was particularly inspired by a group 
of young students led by Social Studies 
Teacher Nicole Clark, English Language Arts 
Teacher Monica Powell, and Inclusion Spe-
cialist Courtney Legg at Two Rivers Public 
Charter School in Washington, D.C. During 
their recent school showcase they presented 
their ‘‘resistance poems’’ which I have shared 
with my colleagues in an e-booklet and posted 
to my website at: https://delauro.house.gov/ 
sites/delauro.house.gov/files/documents/ 
TwoRiversPoems.pdf. 
As Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ‘‘our lives 
begin to end the day we become silent about 
things that matter.’’ During these unprece-
dented times, where we are also struggling to 
combat a pandemic that is disproportionately 
affecting communities of color, we must have 
the courage to make meaningful change. It is 
clear that the young authors of these poems 
certainly have that courage. I was particularly 
inspired by their words, and I am confident 
that my colleagues in the Congress were as 
well. 
It is through their dedication and commit-
ment of young people—and that of so many 
others before them—we are able to continue 
this fight for equality, justice and opportunity 
today and for many years to come.

RECOGNIZING 
BLACK 
HISTORY 
MONTH ESSAY CONTEST WINNER 
SHEA DOWLING 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 26, 2021 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
exemplary work of Shea Dowling, an 8th 
grade student at Albert Hill Middle School in 
Richmond, Virginia, and the middle school 
winner of the Black History Month essay con-
test I hosted earlier this month. Mr. Dowling 
wrote a superb essay on the presidency of 
Barack Obama and the positive impact it has 
left on African-Americans. I am inspired by the 
words of Mr. Dowling, and I encourage young 
people across our country to reflect on what 
this month means to them. 
Since its creation less than 50 years ago, 
Black History Month has been a time to honor 
and reflect upon the remarkable achievements 
of the African-American community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in recognizing Shea Dowling’s exceptional 
work in celebration of Black History Month. 
As the first Black President, Barack 
Obama is an important figure in Black his-
tory. His 2008 election set the record for the 
most votes ever cast, recently surpassed by 
Biden in this election. He was a good Presi-
dent in the eyes of many during his two 
terms. He fought the 2008 recession and 
helped pass the Affordable Care Act. He also 
repealed Don’t Ask Don’t Tell which allowed 
the LGBTQ+ community serve openly in the 
military. He set in motion the opportunity 
for gays to marry. Obama also signed the 
Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which helped 
lessen the wage gap between genders. 
Throughout Obama’s campaign and presi-
dency, he faced discrimination and people 
calling him and his family names. People did 
different things, such as they called his wife, 
Michelle Obama, a man. The birther move-
ment started, where people questioned the 
legitimacy of Obama’s birth certificate. 
A number of Black leaders inspired our 
country and paved the way for Obama’s suc-
cess; including MLK, Jesse Jackson, John 
Lewis, and Shirley Chisholm. However, see-
ing a Black President for eight years, the 
majority of my childhood has shown my 
classmates that they, too, can be anything 
they want—even President. Obama’s presi-
dency has ushered in the success of other 
Black leaders nationally including Kamala 
Harris, Kwanza Hall, and Jamaal Bowman. 
Electing a Black leader to the highest posi-
tion of power in our country is a step in the 
right direction, but we have a long ways to 
go to become a truly equal nation with equal 
rights and equal opportunities for all. We 
have to stand together, united against rac-
ism and discrimination. We have to continue

teaching both the good and the ugly of his-
tory, we have to look beyond mean words 
and ways to divide us. We need to teach peo-
ple to stop looking at one another as strang-
ers, but instead, to look at them as friends 
and get to know what is inside of others. To-
gether, we can carry Obama’s legacy for-
ward, continue to elevate Black voices and 
Black leaders, and move forward as a coun-
try that knows our differences—the many 
voices we bring to the table—is what makes 
us unique as a country.
