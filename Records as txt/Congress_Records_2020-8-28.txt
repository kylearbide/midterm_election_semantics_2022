months of a quadrennial campaign for 
the highest office in our Republic. 
Send Your spirit among Your people,

tience, and intelligent discernment. 
Hear Your people, as we put our trust 
in You. 
Continue to bless those who labor to 
attend to the sick among our citizens,

all safe, in Your divine mercy. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

and community. With a ready smile and a 
helping hand, Maria was always ready to use 
her talent, knowledge, and experience to as-
sist others. Often with her husband Paul at her 
side, Maria organized events including wed-
dings at St. James Church and fundraisers for 
her favorite causes. 
Maria’s heart was large enough to embrace 
causes from Jubilee USA to fight for inter-
national debt relief to the San Diego County 
Commission on the Status of Women and 
Girls where she elevated her voice to fight the 
scourge of human trafficking and promote op-
portunity and equity. 
Maria will long be remembered as a long- 
serving executive board member of the Ran-
cho Santa Fe Democratic Club where her wel-
coming spirit, collaborative style, and hard 
work contributed to the growth and success of 
the club. She also served as a member of the 
San Diego County Democratic Party Central 
Committee and North Area Caucus at a piv-
otal time when the changing political land-
scape led to the election of many of the can-
didates who she worked tirelessly to elect. 
Maria will long be remembered and loved by 
all those whose life she touched.

DELIVERING FOR AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to support H.R. 8015, the Delivering for 
America Act. This legislation is an important 
first step to ensure our Postal Service is not 
undermined by the reckless and political ac-
tions undertaken by President Trump’s hand- 
picked postmaster general. 
The United States Postal Service is en-
shrined in our Constitution and is a critical 
thread of the fabric of American life. 
Our postal workers and letter carriers work 
six days a week and often long hours to sup-
port business and provide Americans with es-
sential services that keep us connected to our 
family, friends, and the world at large. 
We celebrate our heritage and accomplish-
ments through designs on postage stamps. 
Young men enroll in our Selective Service at 
the post office. When we drop a birthday card, 
a bill, or a mail-in ballot into the mailbox, we 
know it will be delivered on time. And for 
many Americans, the USPS is a vital lifeline. 
For example, millions of seniors depend on 
the USPS for their Social Security check, for 
the delivery of their essential medications, for 
their ability to vote, and to stay connected to 
their family and the world. 
For many seniors, a Social Security check is 
their only source of income. It pays for their 
food, their rent, and other essential needs, in-
cluding paying for their life-saving medications. 
Twenty percent of Americans over forty with 
a chronic disease receive their medications 
through mail order, and over half are over the 
age of sixty-five. Fifty-four percent of this 
group take more than four types of medica-
tions. For these Americans, including millions 
of veterans, the collapse of our USPS would 
be literally a matter of life or death. 
Currently, with our nation and the world in 
the midst of a deadly pandemic, without the 
postal service, it would be impossible to live 
our lives as we would normally. We must have 
safe and secure ways to continue to partici-
pate in community life, which includes the abil-
ity to exercise our most fundamental right as 
American citizens: the right to vote. 
More than ever, with the approaching na-
tional election, it is critical for Americans to be 
able to trust their mail-in ballots will be safely 
delivered in time to be counted. 
It is unconscionable that instead of expand-
ing and securing our mail-in voting, President 
Trump’s postmaster general is deliberately try-
ing to undermine and destroy trust in our post-
al service. 
Mr. Speaker, I share the concern and out-
rage expressed by my constituents about 
delays in their mail, reduced accessibility to 
postal services, and efforts to weaken or de-
stroy the USPS. 
H.R. 8015 will prevent the president, and his 
postmaster general, from weakening or de-
stroying our U.S. Postal Service and the es-
sential services it provides to the American 
people. 
I am proud to vote for the Delivering for 
America Act to protect the millions of Ameri-
cans whose very lives depend upon the Postal 
Service, and to stop the president’s insidious 
plan to sabotage it.

HONORING THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
GARDNER HOUSE FOR AFFORD-
ABLE HOUSING 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor Mercy Housing North-
west’s Gardner House in Seattle, Washington 
for receiving the 2020 Charles L. Edson Tax 
Credit Excellence Award from the Affordable 
Housing Tax Credit Coalition. The Charles L. 
Edson Tax Credit Award recognizes excel-
lence in the affordable housing industry and 
projects that have demonstrated the most 
impactful use of the Low-Income Housing Tax 
Credit. 
The Gardner House provides 95 new afford-
able homes and quality services for families, 
formerly homeless individuals, and people with 
disabilities in the Mount Baker neighborhood. 
It was developed with the use of the Low-In-
come Housing Tax Credit, which is an enor-
mously important tool to increase the develop-
ment of affordable housing for families in 
Washington state and across the country. 
The COVID–19 pandemic continues to 
threaten our economy, jobs, and our constitu-
ents’ ability to afford rent. Projects such as the 
Gardner House help to ease the burden of 
rent and provide critical services when it is 
needed most. It provides resources for resi-
dents and people in the community at risk for 
homelessness and much-needed family-sized 
housing and services near transit and schools. 
This includes educational services for children, 
out-of-school activities, and community devel-
opment. In addition, two units are designed to 
be licensed in-home childcare units to provide 
affordable, convenient childcare for residents. 
The Gardner House is a great example of 
the use of public and private funding to benefit 
the community and increase the desperately 
needed supply of affordable housing. I ap-
plaud Mercy Housing Northwest, the Paul G. 
Allen Family Foundation, U.S. Bancorp Com-
munity Development Corporation, the City of 
Seattle, and everyone that made the develop-
ment of Gardner House in Seattle possible 
and congratulate them on this much-deserved 
award.

HON. RASHIDA TLAIB

Friday, August 28, 2020 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
tribute to Nehemiah Word of Faith Full Gospel 
Baptist Church and its partner World Harvest 
United Churches for their work to bring re-
sources to the families of Wayne County, 
Michigan.

neth W. Jones, Sr., Pastor Rachelle Gibson, 
Pastor Jackie Taylor, and Pastor Kathy

with the goal of sharing meals, supplies, and 
fellowship to our most vulnerable populations. 
During this time of unprecedented challenges, 
this group, united in their faith, are taking up 
the mantle in service to others. More than pro-
viding comforts of meal, this day of service 
brings a greater sense of kinship and spiritu-
ality. 
Please join me in recognizing Nehemiah

World Harvest United Church’s day of commu-

HONORING RONNIE MCLAUGHLIN 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to honor Ronnie 
McLaughlin, decorated fire chief in the town of 
Ellerbe. After over 30 years, Ronnie has de-
cided to retire from what he calls his ‘‘dream 
job.’’ 
Ronnie started his career in 1986 and 
worked his way through the ranks, becoming 
the first African American Fire Chief for the 
town. He served in that position until 2002, 
when he became Deputy Fire Chief. Through-
out his service, he received many awards, in-
cluding Fireman of the Year, the Distinguished 
Service Award on multiple occasions, and fi-
nally the Chief’s Award in 1994. 
Ronnie wanted to be a fireman since he 
was a little boy. Like all those who attain their 
dreams, he persisted in his desire and made 
that dream come true. His story is an inspira-
tion to me and all the constituents of the Ninth 
District in North Carolina. 
Ronnie is leaving on a high note: the Ellerbe 
Fire Department recently secured a brand new 
firetruck worth half a million dollars. 
I thank Ronnie for his service to Ellerbe and 
to Richmond County.

HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the tremendous effort Troy and 
Tanner Baraby have put into revitalizing the 
rail yard in Plattsburgh, New York. 
In 2017, the Baraby brothers established 
South Junction Enterprises to provide local 
businesses the opportunity to ship inventory in 
and out of the area by rail. The company has 
facilitated local farmers in reaching a wide 
customer base as their cars ship products 
across the North Country, New England and 
Canada. 
This 
project 
has 
successfully 
repurposed an abandoned rail yard to a thriv-
ing business. In the first two years of oper-
ations, South Junction Enterprise has quad-
rupled its rail car capacity to greater fulfill the 
community needs. 
Local businesses are the backbone of the 
North Country economy and push innovation 
forward. Job creation and economic growth 
stemming from entrepreneurship are vital for 
long term sustainable development in our 
community. I applaud the entrepreneurial spirit 
that runs within the Baraby family and their 
commitment to serving our community that 
has continued over many generations. In addi-
tion to South Junction Enterprises, the broth-
ers continue to operate Moore Recycling in 
Keeseville, New York which was founded by 
their grandfather, Louis Baraby. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank the Baraby family and the 
entire South Junction Enterprises team for 
their dedication to the community and con-
gratulate them on their hard earned achieve-
ments thus far.

Along with other residents of Maryland’s 
Sixth District, I am grateful for the generosity 
of Turkish Americans and their gracious sup-
port to our fellow Marylanders. These PPE de-
liveries complement shipments made by the 
Turkish Republic, which sent two military 
cargo plane loads of PPE to the United 
States, including surgical masks, surgical 
suits, disinfectant, goggles, N–95 masks, and 
face shields. Our frontline healthcare work-
force has been heroic throughout this pan-
demic, and I am heartened to see contribu-
tions like those made by the Turkish American 
community. 
As TASC says, ‘‘Be Negative on COVID, 
Stay Positive on Life.’’

HONORING MICHAEL LEAVITT 
HON. MICHAEL C. BURGESS 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the professional achievements 
and service of Michael Leavitt, City Manager 
for the City of Highland Village, Texas. Mr. 
Leavitt is retiring following more than thirty- 
three years of exemplary service to the public. 
Upon graduation from Truman University in 
Kirksville, Missouri with a B.S. in Industrial 
Science, Mr. Leavitt worked for the cities of 
Kirksville, Missouri and Denton, Texas. In 
2000, Leavitt moved to the City of Highland 
Village, first serving as the public works direc-
tor followed by his appointed as City Manager 
in 2003. 
A true advocate for public safety and fiscal 
responsibility, Leavitt spearheaded the trans-
formation from a volunteer fire department to 
a full-time professional department. Under his 
leadership as City Manager, the ad valorem 
tax rate was reduced, and tax exemptions in-
creased by fifty per-cent for those with a dis-
ability and those over the age of 65. Through 
his capable direction, sales tax revenue has 
grown from just over $400,000 in 2003 to $4 
million in 2020, accomplishing a goal set by 
the City Council to increase funding available 
for city improvement. This tremendous growth 
was spurred by the construction and develop-
ment of premier dining and shopping districts: 
The Marketplace at Highland Village and The 
Shops at Highland Village. 
The quality of life for Highland Village resi-
dents has been raised during his tenure as 
City Manager. Leavitt has overseen extensive 
improvements to the City’s recreation infra-
structure with the addition and growth of the 
City’s biking and walking trails and the pur-
chase and development of the City’s principal 
park, Doubletree Ranch Park. While local in 
nature, many of these projects also involved 
federal interests where I was honored to work 
with Mr. Leavitt and the City. Among these in-
cluded the continuation and expansion of FM 
2499 and the widening of I–35 East, a priority 
project I worked with Mr. Leavitt, local leaders 
and Deputy Secretary of Transportation Thom-
as Barrett to highlight during a media day from 
Highland Village’s Copperas Branch Park. A 
couple of years later in 2010, I worked with 
Mr. Leavitt and the Highland Village Police 
Department to secure 707 Highland Village 
Road. Ultimately deeded to the City as an out-
come of an IRS seizure involving federal 
charges of racketeering, obscenity, fraud and 
income tax evasion, it allowed City Manager 
Leavitt the opportunity to replace a home that 
had attracted criminal activity to this beautiful 
lakeside community with its first lakeside park. 
Only a couple of years later, the Double Tree 
Ranch, another city park improved in large 
part through Mr. Leavitt’s coordinated efforts 
with myself and local officials, was the appro-
priate site in 2017 to finally celebrate the 
Phase 1 completion of the I–35E project. 
Michael Leavitt has been an outstanding 
public servant to the residents and businesses 
of Highland Village. His professional leader-
ship, innovative vision, and passion for excel-
lent customer service will be missed through-
out his community and all of North Texas. On 
behalf of the 26th District, I wish him the best 
in his next stage of life.

REMEMBERING AND HONORING 
JOHN E. ‘‘JACK’’ HARDMAN 
HON. EARL L. ‘‘BUDDY’’ CARTER 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to remember and honor the life of 
John E. ‘‘Jack’’ Hardman of Glynn County. 
Jack was a loyal friend and leader who 
served others with selfless devotion. He at-
tended college in France and New Mexico, 
where he served as class president. After he 
received his degree from The Hiram Scott Col-
lege in Nebraska, he moved to Brunswick, 
Georgia and was employed in the radio broad-
casting business for the Wiggins family. When 
he worked in radio, he was known as Jack 
Pride, and managed three different radio sta-
tions in Georgia and Florida. 
Jack worked for Nationwide Insurance start-
ing in 1984, and he retired in 2018 after 34 
years. He took his leadership skills to new 
heights when he served on the Glynn County 
Board of Commissioners for two terms, and he 
was appointed as Chairman in 1995. 
Jack was a founding shareholder of the At-
lantic National Bank and served on the Board 
for the Georgia Underwriting Association for 
many years. 
He was also an accomplished fisherman 
and a Licensed Master Captain. 
My thoughts and prayers are with his family, 
friends, and everyone who knew him during 
this most difficult time.

Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. CARBAJAL. Madam Speaker, each 
year, through the Women of the Year Award, 
my office extends special recognition to 
women on the Central Coast who have made 
a difference in our community. I would like to 
recognize one outstanding Women of the Year 
Award recipient, Biz Steinberg, of San Luis 
Obispo, California. 
Biz Steinberg has been contributing to this 
community and county since the early 1970’s. 
She currently serves as CEO of Community 
Action Partnership (CAPSLO), a position she 
has held since 1984. Biz has been involved 
with many boards throughout the years includ-
ing the National Head Start Association, Na-
tional Migrant and Seasonal Head Start Asso-
ciation, Workforce Development Board of San 
Luis Obispo, Housing Authority San Luis 
Obispo, The Children’s Services Network, the 
Mission Community Services Corporation, and 
the Child Development Policy Institute Edu-
cation Board. In her quest to better the com-
munity, Biz helped develop the Adult Day 
Centers, Health Services, Homeless Services, 
and 
Energy 
Conservation 
branches 
of 
CAPSLO. 
Biz has been recognized by multiple organi-
zations for her incredible work, including the 
Commission on the Status of Women, SLO 
County Children’s Services Network, and the 
National Heads Start Association. Biz Stein-
berg is an outstanding activist who is working 
to establish sustainable community centers 
with a special focus on youth and women. 
Biz’s work to support the population of San 
Luis Obispo has been a tremendous asset to 
members of our community in need. 
I ask all Members to join me today in hon-
oring an exceptional woman of California’s 
24th Congressional District, Biz Steinberg, for 
her incredible service to her community.

CONGRATULATING DR. MARK 
PETERS 
HON. MICHAEL K. SIMPSON 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to thank Dr. Mark Peters for his excellent serv-
ice as Director at Idaho National Laboratory. 
After nearly five years of capable leadership, 
Dr. Peters has accepted a position as Execu-
tive Vice President for Laboratory Operations 
for the Battelle Memorial Institute. I wish him 
well in this new endeavor and take comfort 
that he will continue to have a role in over-
sight, not just at INL, but each of the national 
laboratories managed by Battelle. 
Dr. Peters spent considerable time on Cap-
itol Hill and many of you have gotten to know 
him and rely upon his expertise. 
One of the benefits of representing a De-
partment of Energy national laboratory is you 
get to meet and work with some of our na-
tion’s best and brightest. Intelligent and driven 
people come to these crown jewels of science 
and innovation and contribute so much to our 
economic prosperity and national security. 
Mark’s service at INL is an example of oper-
ational excellence, energy innovation, and na-
tional security impact. 
Under Dr. Peters’ leadership, INL has deliv-
ered on the grand challenges we ask of our 
national labs. Since Mark arrived at INL on 
Oct. 1, 2015, the laboratory has helped push 
forward development and demonstration of ad-
vanced nuclear technologies and deployed 
new capabilities to secure our nation’s critical 
infrastructure from cyberattack. 
Mark’s vision and ability to bring people to-
gether allowed INL’s clean energy program to 
expand and contribute to new and exciting 
areas. I’m talking integrated energy systems, 
advanced manufacturing, biomass upgrades, 
and so much more.

August 28, 2020 
Under Mark’s leadership, the laboratory as-
sembled the power source for the Mars 2020 
Perseverance Rover, continues to meet the 
Army’s needs for tank armor, is helping DoD 
explore the use of microreactors, and is pro-
ducing new nuclear fuels and materials. 
A personal priority of mine has been revital-
izing the lab’s infrastructure and putting INL’s 
talented workforce into world-class facilities. 
Mark has been a great ally in this process, an 
innovator and collaborator. 
He brought the Department of Energy and 
lab together with the State of Idaho to build 
two new facilities on INL’s in-town campus. 
One of those facilities is dedicated to pro-
tecting our nation from cyberattack. The other 
is dedicated to collaborations in high-perform-
ance computing. 
Dr. Peters has worked hard to introduce the 
lab to all corners of our state and region, dem-
onstrating to the people of Idaho that our na-
tional laboratories are places of innovation and 
intellectual curiosity rather than secretive out-
posts often rumored about, but rarely under-
stood. 
Mark has been dedicated to partnerships, 
building relationships with universities, indus-
try, governments, and schools. He showed our 
state and region that so much can be accom-
plished when we work together and in pursuit 
of lofty, even idealistic, goals. 
Finally, Dr. Peters has a decency and opti-
mism about him—an intangible quality that 
makes everyone around him more positive 
and excited to work together for a brighter fu-
ture. 
Mark is a thoughtful person who cares 
deeply for the people he works with, his com-
munity, and our state. 
Mark has implemented policies to support 
employee safety, work/life balance, inclusive 
recruiting and retention, a shared sense of re-
sponsibility, and duty to give back. 
My wife, Kathy, and I have developed a 
close relationship with Mark and his wife, Ann 
Marie, who has distinguished herself through 
her work with the College of Eastern Idaho 
and various eastern Idaho charities. 
Mark and Ann Marie are an incredible asset 
to Idaho and Kathy and I are grateful for their 
passion for our community and friendship. 
Mark and Anne Marie will be missed, but I 
look forward to working with Mark in his new 
role.

HONORING DOUG KEEGAN 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask that my colleagues in the House join 
me 
in 
recognizing 
D. 
Douglas 
(Doug) 
Keegan’s more than 3 decades of service to 
the central coast of California. 
Doug is a graduate of Holy Cross College 
and Boston College Law School and was li-
censed by the California State Bar to begin 
practicing attorney in 1977. His career on the 
Central Coast began at California Rural Legal 
Assistance and then moved to the Community 
Action Board of Santa Cruz County, Inc. 
(CAB). 
At CAB, Doug has been a tireless advocate 
for the organization’s mission to partner with 
the community to eliminate poverty and create 
social change through advocacy and essential 
services, envisioning a thriving, equitable and 
diverse community free from poverty and in-
justice informed by the values of equity, dig-
nity and diversity, service, inclusion and com-
munity action. Specifically, Doug has served 
as the Program Director of CAB’s Santa Cruz 
County Immigration Project (SCCIP, promoting 
the wellbeing of the immigrant community by 
helping immigrants acquire legal status, reunit-
ing immigrant families, and making U.S. Citi-
zenship more accessible. 
For more than 20 years, Doug’s leadership 
at SCCIP has provided professional legal 
services, tenure. He has mentored hundreds 
of staff and volunteers, motivating and acting 
as a role model for future community leaders 
and attorneys who will continue to fight for 
human rights, the immigrant community and 
overall support of underrepresented groups. 
Madam Speaker, it is my honor to recognize 
Doug Keegan’s commitment to service with 
honesty, humility, intelligence, compassion, 
and integrity as he has advocated tirelessly for 
immigration justice on a local, statewide, and 
national level. It is no surprise that Doug’s rep-
utation as a trusted source of solid, unbiased, 
and plain-spoken answer to complex immigra-
tion questions has made him a trusted expert 
and advisor to countless elected officials, jour-
nalists, educators, service providers, and, 
most importantly, immigrant families. I ask my 
colleagues to join me in celebrating Doug 
Keegan’s lifetime of service.

DELIVERING FOR AMERICA ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Saturday, August 22, 2020 
Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 8015, legislation that is sorely 
needed to help protect the integrity of our 
Postal Service. 
Our communities depend on a reliable Post-
al Service. The hardworking men and women 
of the Postal Service every day help ensure 
that critical mail reaches every part of this 
country, even in the middle of a pandemic. 
These essential workers make sure that this 
essential public service is carried out. 
Despite the challenges of moving mail in a 
country as large as ours and longstanding fis-
cal challenges, it is no wonder the Postal 
Service continues to score high in public opin-
ion polls. It is after all, the public service that 
touches most Americans almost every day. 
The Postal Service is not a business. Nor is 
degrading its level of service a viable business 
plan. Doing so would only hurt the Postal 
Service, its workers, and the American public, 
including those in rural areas. Yet, that is un-
fortunately the direction that the Postal Serv-
ice’s leadership. 
I have heard from so many of my constitu-
ents who are concerned about the damaging 
recent changes to Postal Service operations 
under the leadership of the new Postmaster 
General, changes which are already being felt 
in our communities through reports of delays 
in getting critical mail. 
While the recent announcement that these 
changes would be suspended for a short time 
is a step forward, that is not enough. 
Additionally, besides the changes being 
made by new Postmaster General, the ongo-
ing COVID–19 pandemic that has befuddled 
this Administration also poses a clear threat to 
the short-term and long-term fiscal health of 
the Postal Service. I am pleased that the bill 
before us today includes needed funding to 
address mail volume declines to support the 
Postal Service and its workers through these 
trying times. 
We need to protect and maintain a strong 
Postal Service which is what this bill does. I 
support this legislation and urge my col-
leagues to do the same.

INSULAR AREA LIQUIDITY ACT 
HON. GREGORIO KILILI CAMACHO 
SABLAN 
OF THE NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce the Insular Area Liquidity Act, which 
requires any department or agency of the fed-
eral government, awarding a grant to any of 
the four smaller insular areas, to provide at 
least 50 percent of the award amount up front 
in an advance payment as defined in 2 CFR 
200.3. My bill will also require the awarding 
department or agency to provide enhanced 
grant management assistance and technical 
assistance to the recipients to assure the ad-
vanced funds are properly used. 
Unlike most states, the insular areas have 
limited cash flow. Our districts generally rely 
heavily on a single economy, tourism, that is 
highly sensitive to natural disasters and the 
economic fallout that follows. When that hap-
pens, and even in the best of times, insular 
government have little or no fiscal cushion. 
Of course, I am very grateful for the many 
grants the Marianas receives to shore up the 
limited resources of our islands and, of 
course, especially now to help respond to the 
coronavirus crisis. But many grants awarded 
require that the awardee spend their own cap-
ital up front to be reimbursed later. 
One result is that federal funds are slow to 
be spent and the projects and programs those 
funds are intended to support wait to be imple-
mented. The legislation I am introducing today 
addresses this problem by providing an ad-
vanced payment of at least 50 percent of any 
grant awarded. Projects and programs would 
be less subject to delay. 
This advance award is not a new concept. 
Some federal grant programs already provide 
for an advance payment to recipients. The 
FEMA Public Assistance Grant program, to 
name one, under section 428 of the Robert T. 
Stafford Act, P.L. 93–288 provides a 100 per-
cent advance on project cost estimates, there-
by removing the burden of capital availability 
from the awardee. 
In the Marianas, we are still recovering from 
the devastation caused by 2018 Super Ty-
phoon 
Yutu. 
And 
now 
we 
have 
the 
coronavirus pandemic, which has ground our 
tourism reliant economy to a halt and left our 
government short of funds. But capital limita-
tions are not unique to the Marianas—it is a 
challenge shared by all of the insular areas. 
That is why I introduce this bill today, along-
side my colleagues Mr. SAN NICOLAS, Ms. 
PLASKETT, and Mrs. RADEWAGEN. I urge all my

HONORING THE LIFE OF MRS. 
KARLA JO KROEKER 
HON. DOUG LAMBORN 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. LAMBORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life of Mrs. Karla Jo 
Kroeker, cherished wife, sister, mother, grand-
mother, patriot, and friend. 
Karla was born May 13, 1945, and adopted 
by her loving parents, Kenneth and Dorothy 
Willich, when she was just thirteen days old. 
Her father was a rancher, and mother, a 
school teacher. Karla and her brother, David, 
enjoyed ranch life, riding horses, working cat-
tle, and growing various crops. 
Karla 
graduated 
from 
Stoneham 
High 
School in 1963. She attended Northeastern Jr. 
College in Sterling, Colorado, where she met 
and married the love of her life, Phillip [LTC 
(Ret)], on June 4, 1967. 
After graduating from college, Karla worked 
as an elementary school teacher, and Phillip 
was stationed at Fort Carson Army Base in 
Colorado Springs before being drafted to 
serve in Vietnam. 
Phillip returned safely from the war, and 
they had two beloved children, a son Kendell 
in 1972, and daughter Krystal in 1975. 
After their children were born, they bought 
their family home in Monument, Colorado. 
Karla left her career in education and began 
running a health and wellness company from 
home, which gave her the freedom to dedicate 
her time and energy to her family. She was a 
‘‘hands-on’’ classroom mom to her children— 
going to every field trip, band concert, and 
sporting event. Karla never missed an oppor-
tunity to shower her family with grace and 
love. 
Seventeen years ago, Karla discovered and 
met her biological twin sisters, Madelyn and 
Marilyn, and instantly formed a sisterly bond 
that grew and lasted until her passing. 
Karla was a person of great Christian faith; 
her love for the Lord was boundless and un-
mistakable. She led a local high school Bible 
study group for over 28 years and was a 
member of Cathedral Rock Church in Monu-
ment, Colorado. 
A founding member of Sunrise Republican 
Women, Karla served in various leadership 
roles, contributing her wit, humor, and occa-
sional sass to their skits and events. Karla 
loved to decorate floats for the Monument 4th 
of July parade and was always wearing a 
smile on her face and flag in her hand. She 
was a dedicated and faithful patriot. 
Karla loved to read, work in her yard, and, 
most of all, spend time with her four 
grandsons. She found joy in every aspect of 
life. Her zeal was contagious. 
Karla is survived by her husband (of 53 
years) Phillip, son Kendell (Christy), daughter 
Krystal (Bill), brother David, sisters Madelyn 
and Marilyn, and grandsons Joshua, Daniel, 
Liam, and Evan. Karla will be greatly missed. 
She of all people would want everyone to 
know that she has met her Savior face to 
face, and is in a far better place. 
HONORING SGT DAVID SCUDDER 
FOR BRAVERY IN ACTION 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the distinguished service of 
Sgt. David Scudder of Hot Springs, Arkansas. 
Sgt. Scudder was severely wounded while 
serving with the 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 
82nd Airborne Division in Afghanistan. His fel-
low Paratroopers quickly came to his aid. 
During a September 12, 2019 mission to re-
take a district center held by the Taliban in 
Farah Province, Sgt. Scudder took a bullet to 
the leg. Members of his unit, Specialist Joseph 
Sturgill and Specialist Dominic Green, took 
quick action. Placing Scudder on a stretcher, 
they carried him two miles to safety while tak-
ing enemy fire from a second ambush. 
It is stories like this one which remind us of 
the price our service members pay for the de-
fense of liberty. It is my hope that all of Hot 
Springs, the State of Arkansas, and this nation 
will join me in honoring the valor of individuals 
like Sgt. Scudder. 
I take this time to honor the heroism of Sgt. 
David Scudder and his team and to thank 
them for their commitment to higher service. It 
is from them that we should all learn the ulti-
mate example of bravery, of sacrifice, and 
what it means to be a patriot.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF RAY 
L. TOWNSEND 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life of Ray L. Townsend, of Warren, 
Ohio, who passed away peacefully on August 
3, 2020 at the age of 83. 
Ray was born February 20, 1937 in Varnell, 
Georgia 
to 
the 
late 
Claude 
and 
Mary 
(Sweeney) Townsend. 
Ray married his late wife Linda on Decem-
ber 7, 1956. They loved to dance and travel. 
Their pride was the family they built together. 
Their love and devotion for each other was an 
inspiration for other couples to aspire to. Their 
welcoming home was open to all because ‘‘it 
takes a family to build a community.’’ 
Ray worked non-stop and was a wonderful 
provider. Even up to his last month, he was 
working on cars, doing construction and pass-
ing on his knowledge to his grandkids. 
He was a proud veteran of the U.S. Air 
Force and Army. 
Ray retired from WCI Steel in 2000, where 
he worked for transportation for over 42 years. 
As a committed union representative, he 
fought for fairness. He solicited tirelessly for 
‘‘the working man.’’ 
Besides his parents, Ray is preceded in 
death by his wife, the former Linda E. Burd 
and his sisters, Lois Carmen and Frances 
Weaver. 
Ray is survived by his children, Sandra 
Ham, 
Eugene 
(Pam) 
Townsend, 
Robert 
(Laura) Townsend, Joseph (Jill) Townsend, 
Richard (Suzanne) Townsend and Phillip 
(Audria) Townsend; ten grandchildren and one 
great-grandchild. 
Mr. Townsend was a strong advocate for 
the working people of the Mahoning Valley, 
and I thank him for his service to our country. 
Ray was also a great friend to my office in 
Warren—dropping by to chat and delivering 
sweets during the holidays. My greatest sym-
pathies, and those of my entire staff, go out to 
Ray’s family and to everyone whose lives he 
touched.

HONORING 
OCEANSIDE 
POLICE 
CHIEF FRANK MCCOY ON HIS RE-
TIREMENT 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize Oceanside Police 
Chief Frank McCoy on his retirement after 36 
years in law enforcement. 
Chief McCoy has served as Chief of Police 
for the City of Oceanside since January 2006, 
making him the longest serving Police Chief in 
the history of the department. Under his lead-
ership, Oceanside has seen a 28 percent re-
duction in violent crime and a 33 percent re-
duction in overall crime. Chief McCoy estab-
lished a culture of community policing and 
banned the use of the Carotid Restraint, com-
monly referred to as a chokehold, after the 
murder of George Floyd. 
Before serving in Oceanside, Chief McCoy 
started his career with the City of Manhattan 
Beach. He then spent 20 years working for the 
City of Long Beach, where he worked his way 
through the ranks to become a Commander. 
I am grateful for Chief McCoy’s contributions 
to our community and wish him the best in his 
retirement.

THE 
NORTH COUNTRY’S HISTORY 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, August 28, 2020 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the Johnstown Historical Soci-
ety for the significant part the group has 
played in preserving the rich history of the 
North Country for future generations. 
As the birthplace of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, 
who forever changed America through her ad-
vocacy for women’s rights, Johnstown claims 
a pivotal role in the Women’s Suffrage Move-
ment. This year we are celebrating the 100th 
anniversary of the ratification of the 19th 
Amendment. While Stanton did not live to see 
the right to vote won by women, her legacy 
paved the way for women to be elected to 
Congress and other prominent offices across 
the country in the last 100 years. 
The Johnstown Historical Society imparts 
knowledge of not only Stanton’s life through 
the museum’s display of documents, portraits, 
and artifacts, like her piano, but many other 
historical events as well. Johnstown, New

York, established in 1760, has seen numerous 
historical moments in the founding of our 
country like the Battle of Johnstown, one of 
the final battles of the American Revolution. It 
has welcomed pioneering thinkers like Daniel 
Cady, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr. 
With all of this awe-inspiring history in one 
place, the Johnstown Historical Society leaves 
a lasting impact on all who visit the museum 
and surrounding sites. 
Elizabeth 
Cady 
Stanton 
embodied 
the 
American Dream, fighting to better her way of 
life and the lives of women throughout these 
United States. May we all strive to have such 
a positive impact on the world around us as 
she did. On behalf of New York’s 21st District, 
I would like to thank the historians, curators, 
and staff at Johnstown Historical Society for 
their dedication to the community and to 
archiving the North Country’s impressive his-
tory for generations to come.
