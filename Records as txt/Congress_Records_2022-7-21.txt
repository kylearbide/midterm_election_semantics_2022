No. 121 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Lord, You are the author of our lives, 
the perfecter of our faith. In You, we 
see what we are called to do and what 
You want us to be. For You have shown 
us love when we have been anything 
but lovable and mercy though we are 
not worthy. You have demonstrated 
compassion in our darkest moments 
and steadfastness when all around us 
falls apart. 
To Your image may we be faithful. 
Cause us to follow Your lead as You 
raise us up as leaders of our commu-
nity and of this Nation. In everything 
we do or say, may we live up to the ex-
ample You have called us to be by up-
holding what is good in Your eyes. 
In our conduct in this place, in our 
love for one another, and in our faith 
in the face of adversity, and in our pu-
rity of thought and purpose, may we 
serve as bearers of the truth found only 
in You. 
In the name of the one who is truth, 
we pray. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING THE LIBERIAN 
ASSOCIATION OF MICHIGAN 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today, I 
recognize the Liberian Association of 
Michigan as they gather to celebrate 
the 175th anniversary of Liberia’s inde-
pendence and the contributions of Li-
berian Americans to Michigan’s 13th 
District Strong. 
Founded in 1971, the Liberian Asso-
ciation of Michigan remains grounded 
in their mission to provide assistance 
to those in need and to preserve Libe-
ria’s cultural heritage in our commu-
nities. 
Beyond hosting numerous charitable 
events, the association is ‘‘doing the 
right thing for the right reason’’ in its 
outreach as well as in its support to 
our recent immigrants to our country. 
The association and its members have 
created a welcoming space for new resi-
dents while providing social and eco-
nomic support. 
I commend their incredibly valuable 
work, and I am so proud to support 
them in their anniversary and their 
work. 
Please join me in recognizing the Li-
berian Association of Michigan as they 
celebrate 50 years of service, culture, 
and kinship across Michigan’s 13th 
Congressional District. 
TIME TO WORK WITH LAW 
ENFORCEMENT 
(Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania asked 
and was given permission to address 
the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, recently, I had the chance to 
meet with members of the Fraternal 
Order of Police while back home in 
Pennsylvania, and the stories that 
they shared were shocking. 
They talked about how illegal drugs, 
like heroin, methamphetamine, and 
fentanyl, continue to be widely avail-
able on our streets. 
Now, as overdose deaths continue to 
soar, our communities are seeing the 
result of President Biden’s open border 
policies that have allowed these drugs 
to pour into our communities, bringing 
with them terrible side effects that de-
stroy our towns, our neighborhoods, 
and, unfortunately, sometimes fami-
lies. 
It is time to do more than stand with 
law enforcement. It is time to work 
with law enforcement and give them 
the tools they need to take these drugs 
off of our streets. 
We cannot allow our police officers 
to be defunded while this crisis con-
tinues. It is time to work with law en-
forcement, to stand with them. It is 
time to stop the drug crisis that each 
and 
every 
community 
in 
America 
today is facing. 
f 
PROTECT RIGHTS OF WOMEN AND 
GIRLS 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, it has 
been nearly a month since the Supreme 
Court inexplicably overturned a wom-
an’s 50-year right to her private repro-
ductive healthcare decisions—abortion 
care.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6926 
July 21, 2022 
In this month, we have heard many 
on the other side spread frightening 
disinformation like Democrats want 
abortion on demand. No, Democrats 
want freedom and choice for women to 
make their own reproductive decisions. 
Meanwhile, they ignore or don’t care 
about the fact that women are scared, 
terrified that they may lose access to 
very personal reproductive healthcare 
medications and procedures. 
So, it is necessary that we pass the 
Right to Contraception Act, which will 
guarantee the right to get and use 
birth control, whether it is birth con-
trol pills, IUDs, or emergency contra-
ceptives. 
It is maddening that we even have to 
vote on this, that a woman’s right to 
birth control could even be in question, 
that a privacy right is even up for po-
litical debate. But in this brave new 
world, this is where we are. 
I support this legislation to protect 
the rights of our daughters and grand-
daughters, nieces and friends, women 
and girls everywhere. 
f 
RECOGNIZING PASTOR ROSEMARY 
WOODS 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 
incredible service of a member of our 
community, Pastor Rosemary Woods. 
Pastor Woods has selflessly led mem-
bers of her community for 30 years now 
and is set to achieve the lifetime 
achievement 
award 
in 
Brunswick, 
Georgia. This will not be her first 
award, as Pastor Woods has also re-
ceived the key to the city of Bruns-
wick. 
She is the mother of former Philadel-
phia Phillies player Dominic Brown, 
and in 2014, she was named Mother of 
the Year by the organization. 
Pastor Woods serves her community 
through many food drives, Christmas 
toy drives, and Easter festivals, and 
she is hoping to start a turkey give-
away this coming Thanksgiving. 
Her service to our community is re-
markable and commendable. Her work 
feeding those in need came at an essen-
tial time and has continued to inspire 
others to join in and offer a helping 
hand. 
Pastor Woods is steering our commu-
nity in the right direction, and I look 
forward to hearing about what else she 
is able to accomplish. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Pastor 
Woods for what she has done for the 
people of Georgia’s First Congressional 
District and congratulate her on her 
achievements. 
f 
WE TRUST WOMEN 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the Right to Con-
traception Act, which will soon pass 
the House with the support of House 
Democrats. 
Women’s rights have been under at-
tack for decades. The recent over-
turning of Roe v. Wade has sadly pro-
vided a roadmap for future courts to 
reconsider and overrule the right to 
contraception and other fundamental 
rights. 
In fact, Republicans have used this 
decision as an opening to try to block 
or ban contraceptive methods already. 
But House Democrats won’t stand for 
this, not under our watch. 
Today, 
we 
will 
further 
protect 
women and their fundamental rights 
by passing the Right to Contraception 
Act because we trust women. The bill 
will protect women’s access to birth 
control because no one should control 
women and make their healthcare deci-
sions for them. No one. 
We trust women. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN SHOULD FIST- 
BUMP THE AMERICAN ENERGY 
WORKER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
while President Biden is fist-bumping 
with the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, 
Americans are still facing record-high 
prices at the gas pump. 
When he was campaigning, President 
Biden claimed he would crack down on 
Saudi leaders, and then he turns and 
shares a warm greeting with one before 
begging them to sell us their oil. 
President Biden showed weakness on 
the world stage, and he showed the 
American people he cares more about 
keeping up friendly appearances with 
OPEC than the well-being of the Amer-
ican people. 
Let’s be clear: The Biden administra-
tion halted the Keystone XL pipeline 
on day one and destroyed 11,000 Amer-
ican jobs to line the pockets of OPEC 
oligarchs. 
Why else would President Biden be 
begging Saudi Arabia and other OPEC 
countries to increase oil production 
when producers and refiners right here 
on U.S. soil have struggled for months 
thanks to the Green New Deal agenda? 
Whatever happened to making Amer-
ica self-sufficient in energy? We are a 
country that can depend on ourselves 
for our energy, but the Biden adminis-
tration is continuously doing whatever 
they can to block this from happening. 
Instead of traveling 8,000 miles across 
the ocean to beg for oil from others, he 
should continue the construction of the 
Keystone XL pipeline and the rest of 
our American infrastructure, support 
American workers, and maybe fist- 
bump them for a change. 
b 0915 
DIALING FOR DOLLARS 
(Mr. PHILLIPS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, ac-
cording to an analysis by Issue One, 
House Members running for reelection 
this year raised $207 million over the 
past three months, an average of $3,400 
per Member, per day. 
Back in Minnesota, people ask me all 
the time how busy Members of Con-
gress—compensated 
by 
taxpayers— 
could raise that much money every sin-
gle day. 
Well, we know the dirty truth around 
here: Rather than meeting with con-
stituents, studying policy, writing leg-
islation, or attending committee meet-
ings, Members of the House and Senate 
collectively are spending 10,000 hours 
per week dialing for dollars or attend-
ing fundraising receptions. It is down-
right gross. 
So that is why my colleague, MIKE 
GALLAGHER, and I have introduced the 
On the Clock Act. Our bill won’t fix 
America’s corrupt campaign finance 
system, but it will ensure that Mem-
bers of Congress spend more time 
working for the people and less time 
raising money for themselves. 
f 
JANUARY 6 INVESTIGATION 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, tonight, 
will be the last scheduled meeting of 
the partisan Committee on January 
6th. 
As my neighbors in middle Tennessee 
struggle with the skyrocketing cost of 
living, I can’t help but think Congress’ 
time and energy should be focused on 
the issues on most Americans’ minds, 
not another political witch hunt. 
If the committee had any legitimacy, 
it would allow Leader MCCARTHY to 
seek the Republicans of his choosing. 
Speaker PELOSI
made the unprece-
dented decision to not do so. 
If it had any legitimacy, the com-
mittee would be investigating what 
caused the events to unfold that day, 
what led to the breach of security, and 
what can we do to learn from these 
failures to prepare for the future. 
Unfortunately, I don’t think the 
committee has done its job to ask 
these important questions. 
Tennesseans are smart and see this 
process as what it is: a partisan witch 
hunt in the form of a sham investiga-
tion.

DIAL 988 FOR MENTAL HEALTH 
(Mr. CA´ RDENAS asked and was 
given permission to address the House

July 16 marked the turning point for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6927 
July 21, 2022 
For the first time in our history, 
anytime, anywhere in America, you 
can call 988 for immediate help during 
a mental health crisis. 
But to truly meet this moment and 
carry forward the full potential of 988, 
we need to do more. 
Right now, America’s default for peo-
ple who need immediate help when ex-
periencing a mental health crisis is to 
call 911, and the default treatment fa-
cilities are jails and emergency rooms. 
Time and time again, we have seen 
repeating tragedies of police officers 
killing individuals during a mental 
health emergency. The fact is, we need 
to stop criminalizing mental illness 
and get people the crisis help that they 
need. 
To truly fulfill the promise of 988, we 
must make sure anyone who dials 988 
will have someone to call, someone to 
come if they need help, and somewhere 
to go for compassionate continuous 
care.

FAILED SOLUTIONS TO RISING 
ENERGY COSTS 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, President Biden’s reckless 
agenda is sending our Nation hurdling 
towards a recession. 
The President wants people to be-
lieve 40-year high inflation is someone 
else’s fault. But his solution to this cri-
sis highlights his complicity in driving 
up the cost of everything, from gas to 
groceries. 
One of President Biden’s solutions to 
rising energy costs is begging foreign 
countries to pump more oil. This is the 
same President who is waging a regu-
latory assault on U.S. energy produc-
tion. His administration has sold near-
ly 1 million barrels of oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to a Chi-
nese energy company. 
It is unbelievable. I am coauthoring 
an amendment to block the adminis-
tration from ever doing this again. 
As a fighter for working families, I 
will keep doing everything I can to 
hold the administration accountable 
for driving inflation to the highest 
level in 40 years.

RIGHT TO CONTRACEPTION ACT 
Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1232, I call up 
the bill (H.R. 8373) to protect a person’s 
ability to access contraceptives and to 
engage in contraception, and to protect 
a health care provider’s ability to pro-
vide contraceptives, contraception, and 
information related to contraception, 
and ask for its immediate consider-
ation in the House. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
SA´ NCHEZ). Pursuant to House Resolu-
tion 1232, the amendment printed in 
part B of House Report 117–420 is adopt-
ed, and the bill, as amended, is consid-
ered read. 
The text of the bill, as amended, is as 
follows: 
H.R. 8373 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Right to 
Contraception Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS. 
In this Act: 
(1) CONTRACEPTION.—The term ‘‘contracep-
tion’’ means an action taken to prevent 
pregnancy, including the use of contracep-
tives or fertility-awareness based methods, 
and sterilization procedures. 
(2) CONTRACEPTIVE.—The term ‘‘contracep-
tive’’ means any drug, device, or biological 
product intended for use in the prevention of 
pregnancy, whether specifically intended to 
prevent pregnancy or for other health needs, 
that is legally marketed under the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, such as oral 
contraceptives, long-acting reversible con-
traceptives, emergency contraceptives, in-
ternal and external condoms, injectables, 
vaginal barrier methods, transdermal patch-
es, and vaginal rings, or other contracep-
tives. 
(3) GOVERNMENT.—The term ‘‘government’’ 
includes each branch, department, agency, 
instrumentality, and official of the United 
States or a State. 
(4) HEALTH
CARE
PROVIDER.—The term 
‘‘health care provider’’ means, with respect 
to a State, any entity or individual (includ-
ing any physician, certified nurse-midwife, 
nurse, nurse practitioner, physician assist-
ant, and pharmacist) that is licensed or oth-
erwise authorized by the State to provide 
health care services. 
(5) STATE.—The term ‘‘State’’ includes 
each of the 50 States, the District of Colum-
bia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and 
each territory and possession of the United 
States, and any subdivision of any of the 
foregoing, including any unit of local gov-
ernment, such as a county, city, town, vil-
lage, or other general purpose political sub-
division of a State. 
SEC. 3. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The right to contraception is a funda-
mental right, central to a person’s privacy, 
health, wellbeing, dignity, liberty, equality, 
and ability to participate in the social and 
economic life of the Nation. 
(2) The Supreme Court has repeatedly rec-
ognized the constitutional right to contra-
ception. 
(3) In Griswold v. Connecticut (381 U.S. 479 
(1965)), the Supreme Court first recognized 
the constitutional right for married people 
to use contraceptives. 
(4) In Eisenstadt v. Baird (405 U.S. 438 
(1972)), the Supreme Court confirmed the 
constitutional right of all people to legally 
access contraceptives regardless of marital 
status. 
(5) In Carey v. Population Services Inter-
national (431 U.S. 678 (1977)), the Supreme 
Court affirmed the constitutional right to 
contraceptives for minors. 
(6) The right to contraception has been re-
peatedly recognized internationally as a 
human right. The United Nations Population 
Fund has published several reports outlining 
family planning as a basic human right that 
advances women’s health, economic em-
powerment, and equality. 
(7) Access to contraceptives is internation-
ally recognized by the World Health Organi-
zation as advancing other human rights such 
as the right to life, liberty, expression, 
health, work, and education. 
(8) Contraception is safe, essential health 
care, and access to contraceptive products 
and services is central to people’s ability to 
participate equally in economic and social 
life in the United States and globally. Con-
traception allows people to make decisions 
about their families and their lives. 
(9) Contraception is key to sexual and re-
productive health. Contraception is critical 
to preventing unintended pregnancy and 
many contraceptives are highly effective in 
preventing and treating a wide array of often 
severe medical conditions and decrease the 
risk of certain cancers. 
(10) Family planning improves health out-
comes for women, their families, and their 
communities and reduces rates of maternal 
and infant mortality and morbidity. 
(11) The United States has a long history of 
reproductive coercion, including the child-
bearing forced upon enslaved women, as well 
as the forced sterilization of Black women, 
Puerto Rican women, indigenous women, im-
migrant women, and disabled women, and re-
productive coercion continues to occur. 
(12) The right to make personal decisions 
about contraceptive use is important for all 
Americans, and is especially critical for his-
torically 
marginalized 
groups, 
including 
Black, indigenous, and other people of color; 
immigrants; LGBTQ people; people with dis-
abilities; people with low incomes; and peo-
ple living in rural and underserved areas. 
Many 
people 
who 
are 
part 
of 
these 
marginalized groups already face barriers— 
exacerbated by social, political, economic, 
and 
environmental 
inequities—to 
com-
prehensive health care, including reproduc-
tive health care, that reduce their ability to 
make decisions about their health, families, 
and lives. 
(13) State and Federal policies governing 
pharmaceutical and insurance policies affect 
the accessibility of contraceptives, and the 
settings in which contraception services are 
delivered. 
(14) People engage in interstate commerce 
to access contraception services. 
(15) To provide contraception services, 
health care providers employ and obtain 
commercial services from doctors, nurses, 
and other personnel who engage in interstate 
commerce and travel across State lines. 
(16) Congress has the authority to enact 
this Act to protect access to contraception 
pursuant to— 
(A) its powers under the Commerce Clause 
of section 8 of article I of the Constitution of 
the United States; 
(B) its powers under section 5 of the Four-
teenth Amendment to the Constitution of 
the United States to enforce the provisions 
of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment; 
and 
(C) its powers under the necessary and 
proper clause of section 8 of article I of the 
Constitution of the United States. 
(17) Congress has used its authority in the 
past to protect and expand access to contra-
ception information, products, and services. 
(18) In 1970, Congress established the fam-
ily planning program under title X of the 
Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300 et 
seq.), the only Federal grant program dedi-
cated to family planning and related serv-
ices, providing access to information, prod-
ucts, and services for contraception. 
(19) In 1972, Congress required the Medicaid 
program to cover family planning services 
and supplies, and the Medicaid program cur-
rently accounts for 75 percent of Federal 
funds spent on family planning. 
(20) In 2010, Congress enacted the Patient 
Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public 
Law 111–148) (referred to in this section as 
the ‘‘ACA’’). Among other provisions, the 
ACA included provisions to expand the af-
fordability and accessibility of contraception

by requiring health insurance plans to pro-
vide coverage for preventive services with no 
patient cost-sharing. 
(21) Despite the clearly established con-
stitutional right to contraception, access to 
contraceptives, including emergency contra-
ceptives and long-acting reversible contra-
ceptives, has been obstructed across the 
United States in various ways by Federal 
and State governments. 
(22) As of 2022, at least 4 States tried to ban 
access to some or all contraceptives by re-
stricting access to public funding for these 
products and services. Furthermore, Arkan-
sas, Mississippi, Missouri, and Texas have in-
fringed on people’s ability to access their 
contraceptive care by violating the free 
choice of provider requirement under the 
Medicaid program. 
(23) Providers’ refusals to offer contracep-
tives and information related to contracep-
tion based on their own personal beliefs im-
pede patients from obtaining their preferred 
method, with laws in 12 States as of the date 
of introduction of this Act specifically allow-
ing health care providers to refuse to provide 
services related to contraception. 
(24) States have attempted to define abor-
tion expansively so as to include contracep-
tives in State bans on abortion and have also 
restricted access to emergency contracep-
tion. 
(25) In June 2022, Justice Thomas, in his 
concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson 
Women’s Health Organization (597 U.S. ll 
(2022)), stated that the Supreme Court 
‘‘should reconsider all of this Court’s sub-
stantive due process precedents, including 
Griswold, Lawrence, and Obergefell’’ and 
that the Court has ‘‘a duty to correct the 
error established in those precedents’’ by 
overruling them. 
(26) In order to further public health and to 
combat efforts to restrict access to reproduc-
tive health care, congressional action is nec-
essary to protect access to contraceptives, 
contraception, and information related to 
contraception for everyone, regardless of ac-
tual or perceived race, ethnicity, sex (includ-
ing gender identity and sexual orientation), 
income, disability, national origin, immigra-
tion status, or geography. 
SEC. 4. PERMITTED SERVICES. 
(a) GENERAL RULE.—A person has a statu-
tory right under this Act to obtain contra-
ceptives and to engage in contraception, and 
a health care provider has a corresponding 
right to provide contraceptives, contracep-
tion, and information related to contracep-
tion. 
(b) LIMITATIONS
OR
REQUIREMENTS.—The 
statutory rights specified in subsection (a) 
shall not be limited or otherwise infringed 
through 
any 
limitation 
or 
requirement 
that— 
(1) expressly, effectively, implicitly, or as 
implemented singles out the provision of 
contraceptives, contraception, or contracep-
tion-related information; health care pro-
viders who provide contraceptives, contra-
ception, or contraception-related informa-
tion; or facilities in which contraceptives, 
contraception, or contraception-related in-
formation is provided; and 
(2) impedes access to contraceptives, con-
traception, or contraception-related infor-
mation. 
(c) EXCEPTION.—To defend against a claim 
that a limitation or requirement violates a 
health care provider’s or patient’s statutory 
rights under subsection (b), a party must es-
tablish, by clear and convincing evidence, 
that— 
(1) the limitation or requirement signifi-
cantly advances access to contraceptives, 
contraception, and information related to 
contraception; and 
(2) access to contraceptives, contraception, 
and information related to contraception or 
the health of patients cannot be advanced by 
a less restrictive alternative measure or ac-
tion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6929 
July 21, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 8373, the Right to Contra-
ception Act introduced by Representa-
tive MANNING. 
When the Supreme Court overruled a 
woman’s constitutional right to abor-
tion last month, it also called into 
question all the other fundamental 
freedoms that Americans cherish under 
the 14th Amendment’s right to privacy, 
including the right to contraception. 
In his concurrence, Justice Clarence 
Thomas went so far to even contend 
that the Court should reconsider Gris-
wold, the landmark case that first rec-
ognized the constitutional right to use 
contraceptives. 
This has opened the door for Repub-
lican legislators in States like Idaho, 
Louisiana, and Mississippi to try to 
ban certain contraceptive methods. 
These extreme proposals build on dec-
ades of Republican efforts to restrict 
access 
to 
essential 
reproductive 
healthcare services. They have tried to 
gut the Title X Family Planning pro-
gram, which provides access to contra-
ceptives and family planning services 
for low-income and uninsured individ-
uals. They have also repeatedly tried 
to invalidate the Affordable Care Act’s 
contraceptive mandate, which ensures 
coverage for contraception free of 
charge. 
Contraception is basic preventive 
healthcare and is crucial to the health 
and human rights of all people. Mil-
lions of people rely on contraception 
not only to prevent unintended preg-
nancies but to prevent and treat a wide 
range of medical conditions. Access to 
contraception is essential to achieving 
gender equality as it advances women’s 
health and economic empowerment. 
H.R. 8373 ensures that Republicans 
cannot limit people’s access to contra-
ceptives. 
It 
also 
ensures 
that 
healthcare providers can provide con-
traceptives 
and 
information 
about 
them free from political interference. 
Madam Speaker, while the right to 
contraception is legal today, we must 
act to ensure this remains true in the 
future. This legislation does exactly 
that, by enshrining the right to contra-
ception in Federal law. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 8373. Every woman’s potential 
journey to motherhood is different, and 
I support their access to contraception. 
However, this legislation has a lot of 
problems. Democrats just introduced it 
on Friday and debated it for the first 
time on Monday in the Committee on 
Rules. And since then, they have had to 
introduce multiple amendments to ad-
dress their own failures to draft good 
policy. 
This is not how we build trust in so-
lutions to bring forward in the people’s 
House. If Democrats came to me and 
asked to work together on a bill, I 
would have been happy to roll up my 
sleeves and work with them. 
For years, Republicans on both sides 
of the Capitol have led on solutions to 
allow for great access to safe and effec-
tive contraception, including making 
it available over the counter. Right 
now, Congresswoman ASHLEY HINSON 
and Congresswoman STEPHANIE
BICE 
are leading on these bills. 
Unfortunately, today, rather than 
work with us, Democrats again, are 
spreading fear and misinformation to 
score political points. And they are 
doing it with a very poorly drafted bill 
that opens the door further to extreme 
abortion on demand and their agenda. 
H.R. 8373 is a Trojan horse for more 
abortions. It should be called the pay-
outs for Planned Parenthood act. It 
would send more taxpayer dollars to 
Planned Parenthood, freeing up more 
funds for them to provide abortions 
and end vulnerable lives. 
This bill endangers the health and 
safety of women. It allows Planned 
Parenthood and abortion providers to 
prescribe both on- and off-label drugs 
to be used for abortions without any 
restrictions. Additionally—and again, 
despite many drafts—Democrats in-
cluded a definition of contraception 
that is not limited to FDA-approved 
products. 
The term ‘‘contraception’’ is defined 
as an action taken to prevent preg-
nancy, including the use of contracep-
tives 
or 
fertility 
awareness-based 
methods and sterilization procedures. 
This means that the bill creates an 
individual right to engage in contra-
ception which can include the use of 
FDA-approved products, but also any 
other action taken to prevent preg-
nancy, including non-approved prod-
ucts. 
H.R. 8373 will also continue President 
Biden’s war on religious liberty and 
conscience protections. It would force 
health providers to violate their reli-
gion and sincerely held beliefs to pro-
vide contraception and perform steri-
lizations, including on minors. 
It would also force organizations, 
like the Little Sisters of the Poor to 
violate their religion and provide con-
traception. For all the fearmongering 
Democrats are spreading about other 
Supreme 
Court 
precedents 
being 
threatened, where is the respect for the 
Little Sisters of the Poor and their vic-
tory for their constitutionally guaran-
teed religious freedom? 
The unfortunate reality today is that 
this bill goes too far and defies the 
most basic safeguards meant to protect 
women and children. Women deserve 
the truth, not more fear and misin-
formation that forces an extreme agen-
da on the American people. 
Again, Republicans have led to make 
birth 
control 
available 
over 
the 
counter. In 2019, the Federal Govern-
ment, under a Republican President, 
spent $1.8 billion for family planning. 
We have solutions to build on this 
work to support women. 
Unfortunately, 
Democrats 
are 
conflating the issues of abortion and 
contraception to promote unrestricted 
abortion for all 9 months of pregnancy. 
Contraception is fundamentally dif-
ferent than abortion; a distinction rec-
ognized by the pro-life community, 
doctors, 
medical 
professionals, 
the 
science, and in Justice Alito’s Dobbs 
opinion. 
Abortion intentionally ends a human 
life. Contraception is to prevent con-
ception. 
There is a clear distinction, and to 
suggest 
otherwise 
is 
more 
fearmongering and scare tactics that 
are a disservice to women everywhere. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
H.R. 8373, and I urge my colleagues 
across the aisle to work with us. We 
welcome the opportunity. Rather than 
rushing another poorly drafted bill—an 
extreme 
bill—through 
the 
people’s 
House, we can come together to sup-
port every woman’s path to a better 
life and every woman’s journey to 
motherhood. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. MANNING), 
the sponsor of this legislation. 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
my bill, the Right to Contraception 
Act. It seems unbelievable that in the 
year 2022, we should have to explain 
that access to birth control is about 
equality. It is critically important so 
that women can: 
Decide whether and when to have a 
family. 
Pursue an education. 
Build an economically secure future; 
and 
Protect their health. 
Let’s be honest about the facts. Al-
most all women will use birth control 
at some point in their lives, and more 
than 96 percent of voters support ac-
cess to birth control. Yet, the right to 
birth control is under attack by Repub-
lican 
lawmakers 
who 
are 
pushing 
disinformation about how contracep-
tives work and attempting to ban 
methods like IUDs and Plan B. 
Justice Thomas has added fuel to 
that fire by stating in Dobbs that the 
Court should reconsider the constitu-
tional right to contraception. 
This extremism is about one thing: 
control of women. We will not let this 
happen. We will not play defense any-
more. This time, we are playing of-
fense. 
My bill creates a Federal statutory 
right for individuals to use birth con-
trol and for healthcare professionals to 
provide it. 
b 0930 
It protects a full range of contracep-
tive methods, including birth control 
pills, IUDs, and emergency contracep-
tives. 
It subjects any State or government 
official who restricts access to contra-
ceptive services to a civil action by the

attorney general, or an individual or 
healthcare provider whose rights are 
violated. 
Let’s be clear, this bill is about al-
lowing women the freedom to choose 
the contraception that works best for 
them to allow them to prevent unin-
tended pregnancies. 
American women—indeed all Ameri-
cans—deserve the freedom to make 
their own decisions about their bodies, 
their family planning, and their lives. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this well-crafted bill, the 
Right to Contraception Act, because 
women and girls across this country 
are watching you. They want to know: 
Are you willing to stand up for them? 
Are you willing to fight for them? 
Madam Speaker, I certainly am. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. ESHOO), the chair-
woman of the Energy and Commerce 
Health Subcommittee. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in the strongest support of H.R. 8373, 
the Right to Contraception Act. 
We all belong to committees here, 
and when we do, as we do, we get to 
know Members very well. An observa-
tion of mine over these years as a 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee is—I don’t know any Mem-
ber that has 10, 12, or 14 children. I 
would say there is some family plan-
ning going on here. 
This is a private decision that we all 
have had the freedom to make. This 
bill is about family planning. It is 
about birth control. It is not about 
controlling women. It is about the free-
dom that women can make. 
No politician or judge should be 
interfering in private healthcare deci-
sions or restrict access to contracep-
tion. The Supreme Court has threat-
ened this fundamental right, leaving 
this issue on the Court’s chopping 
block. 
Madam Speaker, everyone should 
vote for this bill. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
CAMMACK). 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 8373, 
the right to deception act. 
First, this bill is completely unneces-
sary. In no way, shape, or form is ac-
cess to contraception limited or at risk 
of being limited. The liberal majority 
is clearly trying to stoke fears and 
mislead the American people, once 
again, because in their minds stoking 
fear is clearly the only way that they 
can win. 
No State—not one—not one State 
across the country has banned access 
to contraceptives. That is a fact—and 
an inconvenient one on the left. Now 
they are left to make up wild stories 
about States that they cannot name 
banning contraceptives. 
However, rather than uniting behind 
the broad and commonsense notion 
that access to safe and legal contracep-
tion is important, my colleagues on the 
left have once again chosen political 
theater. I guess that would explain the 
connection to Hollywood, right? 
It is time to get past the theater and 
look at these inconvenient facts that 
my colleagues on the left will not tell 
you 
about, 
and 
their 
outrageous 
claims. 
They claim that this is a clean codi-
fication to ensure that contraceptives 
can never be banned in this country. 
Let me be clear, this goes far beyond 
that claim. 
In fact, this bill jeopardizes constitu-
tional rights of individuals and organi-
zations across this great land by forc-
ing 
providers 
to 
prescribe 
various 
forms of contraception that violates 
their religious rights. We are a Nation 
that upholds and values religious free-
dom, and this bill here today flies in 
the face of individuals with religious 
liberty concerns. 
As a constitutional conservative, I 
am also disturbed by the provisions 
within this bill that attempt to provide 
a back door for abortion service pro-
viders, like Planned Parenthood, to tap 
into more Federal taxpayer dollars. 
This bill, brought under false pre-
tenses by the left, in a vain attempt to 
scare Americans with lies and exag-
geration represents a clear overstep of 
Federal authority. 
If you are still wondering why every 
single Member in this Chamber should 
be voting against this bill—the right to 
deception act—you should know that 
this administration has already proven 
that they will sick a highly politicized 
DOJ on concerned parents. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the gentle-
woman from Florida an additional 1 
minute. 
Mrs. CAMMACK. Madam Speaker, if 
you are wondering, once again, why 
every single Member in this Chamber 
who took an oath to uphold the United 
States Constitution, not a political 
parties’ oath, if you are wondering why 
you should vote against the right to 
deception act, you should know that 
this administration has already proven 
that they will sick a highly politicized 
DOJ on concerned parents. They have 
done it before. They will do it again. 
This bill here today would take away 
a parent’s rights with regard to their 
children and the State laws that are 
designed to protect minors. No bureau-
crat in Washington knows better than 
our parents back home. I would be 
happy to debate that fact any day. 
Let’s recap. This bill—the right to 
deception act—is looking to solve a 
problem that doesn’t exist. But more 
than that, in seeking to solve a prob-
lem that doesn’t exist, you want to 
spend more of our taxpayer money to 
grow the size and scope of government 
and to allow more abortions to occur 
and kill our children. Cool. You all are 
a real piece of work. Folks back home, 
they see right through this, and they 
will see through it in November. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Illinois (Ms. SCHAKOWSKY), the 
chairwoman of the Consumer Protec-
tion and Commerce Subcommittee. 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the sponsors of this legislation 
for their support. I have been proud to 
join them. 
Madam Speaker, you know, you 
would think that everyone would want 
to protect access to contraception and 
to family planning, especially people 
who are opposed to abortion. Yet, we 
have seen that there have been efforts 
to exclude available and effective con-
traception, that there has been an ef-
fort to limit the choices that women 
have to even have contraception. So, 
yes, we absolutely need to pass this 
bill. We need to pass it into law. We 
need to do it right now. 
Madam Speaker, 99 percent of Ameri-
cans are in favor of contraception, so 
let’s pass this legislation. We should do 
it with all our Members on both sides 
of the aisle. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. MATSUI), a mem-
ber of our committee. 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 8373, the Right 
to Contraception Act. 
Contraception 
is 
empowering. 
It 
gives people control over what happens 
to their bodies and supports the free-
dom to plan a family. Using birth con-
trol can shape an individual’s life. 
Being able to choose the contraceptive 
that is right for you impacts your fu-
ture health, education, employment, 
and economic security. 
The Supreme Court’s decision was a 
direct attack on abortion, and Ameri-
cans are now justifiably scared about 
the future of birth control. Republicans 
across this country will continue their 
extreme assault on basic freedoms. 
Justice Thomas made it clear that the 
Supreme Court will do nothing to pro-
tect our fundamental rights from these 
coordinated attacks. 
I refuse to sit back and watch as Re-
publicans regress our Nation to a place 
where my granddaughter has fewer 
rights than her mother or I did. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentlewoman from California. 
Ms. MATSUI. Madam Speaker, I 
refuse to sit back and watch where 
States can take away an individual’s 
ability to make personal decisions 
about their body, their life, and their 
future. 
Madam Speaker, I implore you to 
really think about this and pass this 
bill.

July 21, 2022 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. 
LESKO), a member of the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in opposition to H.R. 8373. 
I am here today with my Republican 
colleagues to stand up for the health 
and safety of women and girls across 
our Nation. 
It is unfortunate that this bill is 
written in such a way that it is unclear 
that it just covers traditional contra-
ceptives. It is disappointing to see that 
my colleagues across the aisle are con-
tinuing to push their extreme abortion 
on demand agenda. 
It is unclear why those who call 
themselves the ‘‘party of women’’ in-
sist on prioritizing the billion-dollar, 
far-left abortion lobby over women and 
girls. 
This 
legislation—the 
payouts 
for 
Planned Parenthood act—permits the 
widespread use of chemical abortion 
pills. The FDA deems these drugs as 
high-risk because they can cause exces-
sive bleeding, intense pain, infections, 
and even death. 
To make matters even worse, this 
bill allows abortion providers to ad-
minister non-FDA approved drugs and 
devices to women and girls without 
any regard for the drug’s efficacy or 
the safety of the patient. 
We should not be promoting the 
widespread and unsupervised use of 
high-risk or unapproved drugs that 
could endanger women and girls’ lives, 
and almost certainly will end the lives 
of their babies. 
This legislation also erodes decades 
of bipartisan agreement that taxpayer 
dollars should not be used to fund abor-
tions. Instead, the payouts for Planned 
Parenthood act forces States to direct 
more Federal funding to Planned Par-
enthood and other abortion providers. 
This legislation is not about pro-
tecting access to contraception. It is 
not about protecting the rights of 
women and girls. It is about one thing, 
and one thing only, lining the pockets 
of Planned Parenthood and the rest of 
the abortion lobby. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR), who is a 
member of our committee and chairs 
the Select Committee on the Climate 
Crisis. 
Ms. CASTOR of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, we are at a perilous time 
where an extremist Supreme Court and 
the GOP are rolling back our rights. 
They are rolling back the legal guar-
antee to control our bodies and to 
make our own decisions about when to 
have children. 
In States like mine in Florida, the 
Governor has already instituted a cruel 
15-week abortion ban, and recently 
struck a plan to provide contraceptive 
care to working-class women and girls 
for the second year in a row. 
I have served in Congress for enough 
years to watch the GOP over time fight 
to eliminate birth control and family 
planning funds. They fought to elimi-
nate the no-cost birth control under 
the Affordable Care Act, in addition to 
the Democrats fighting to establish 
this right to contraceptives. 
This bill also would ensure that doc-
tors can continue to do their jobs and 
provide contraceptives without being 
turned into criminals. Contraceptive 
use is crucial to preventing unintended 
pregnancies, preventing and treating 
countless medical conditions, and de-
creasing the risk of certain cancers. 
Everyone should have equal access to 
necessary preventative care no matter 
which State you live in. On behalf of 
the women in the State of Florida and 
America, I urge my colleagues to sup-
port the right to contraceptives and 
the right of women to control their 
own bodies. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Hampshire (Ms. KUSTER), a 
member of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Ms. KUSTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of the Right to Contracep-
tion Act. 
The overturning of Roe v. Wade by 
the Supreme Court was a wake-up call. 
We cannot leave our right to privacy 
and our most fundamental freedoms up 
to chance. 
The government has no place insert-
ing itself into the personal and private 
healthcare decisions of Americans, in-
cluding access to contraceptives. 
Ongoing extreme attacks on women’s 
freedom and control of our own bodies 
make clear that Congress must take 
action to protect our most basic right 
to medical care and contraception. 
There are countless reasons for pa-
tients to access contraception and why 
healthcare providers prescribe. These 
reasons are nuanced, complicated, and, 
frankly, none of the government’s busi-
ness. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ and to protect 
the privacy and freedom of millions of 
Americans. 
b 0945 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the gentleman from Texas (Mr. BUR-
GESS), who is a leader on the Energy 
and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentlewoman from Wash-
ington for yielding. 
While practicing medicine for over 30 
years back in Texas, I personally pre-
scribed a lot of contraceptives. I have 
seen the benefit that they have over 
the lives of women who use them, and 
I will continue to support a woman’s 
right to access contraception. 
But this bill was brought to the floor 
of the House urgently and outside of 
regular order. There was no attempt to 
work with Republicans. The majority 
hastily put forward an incomplete 
product that, at the end of the day, is 
never going to see the light of day in 
the Senate. 
The Right to Contraception Act 
would establish a statutory right for 
patients to obtain contraception and 
for doctors to prescribe. The kindest 
thing I can say about this legislation is 
that it is duplicative and unnecessary. 
But, unfortunately, it can also be dam-
aging. 
Contraception is so broadly defined 
that it could guarantee access to med-
ical abortion pills or even contracep-
tives that might not have FDA ap-
proval. It could lead to the dispensing 
of unsafe products. Even if a product 
gets FDA approval, it does not always 
ensure its safety. 
Essure was a medical device pre-
viously sold to cause sterilization. The 
FDA approved this device in 2002, but it 
didn’t start examining reported con-
cerns by users until 2015. In 2018, the 
FDA restricted the sale of Essure, and 
the manufacturer took the device com-
pletely off the market. 
The Dalkon Shield is an intrauterine 
birth control device manufactured and 
sold in the early 1970s. This device was 
responsible for many reported inci-
dents of inflammatory infections, uter-
ine perforations, spontaneous septic 
abortions, as well as at least four 
deaths. The FDA requested this device 
be taken off the market in October of 
1974 but never issued a formal recall. 
Under the language of this bill consid-
ered today, a provider could provide 
that. When manufacturing ceased in 
1976, more than 2 million of these de-
vices had already been sold in the 
United States. 
Madam Speaker, I am the first to 
agree that the drug approval process at 
the FDA should be made faster, more 
transparent, and safer. But imagine the 
dangers of allowing contraceptives and 
devices where the FDA has not even 
considered their safety. 
Madam Speaker, you will find con-
sensus in the Energy and Commerce 
Committee amongst Republicans re-
garding preserving access to contracep-
tion if the Democrats had only decided 
to work. We had no legislative hearing; 
we had no subcommittee markup; and 
we had no full committee markup. 
The bill was introduced last Friday 
and brought to the Rules Committee 
on Monday. I am also a member of the 
Rules Committee, so that was the only 
hearing that we had on this legislation. 
As I like to tell people, Rules Com-
mittee members are like the apex pred-
ators of the legislative process. We are 
only there at the end of the road. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is bad, and 
I urge it not to be adopted. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Ms. CRAIG), who is the 
co-lead on this legislation. 
Ms. CRAIG. Madam Speaker, to tell 
you the truth, I am disappointed to be 
here today, too, supporting the very 
idea and the very notion that we have

to be here today exerting and codifying 
the right for women to make their own 
healthcare and family planning deci-
sions. 
It is 2022, and we are standing here 
today with Roe overturned and with 77 
percent of this extreme GOP caucus 
voting against marriage equality, so 
you had better bet, Madam Speaker, 
that we are here because the Supreme 
Court 
has 
attacked 
reproductive 
rights. It is absolutely necessary that 
we take action today. 
For most of our lives, women across 
our country, including most in this 
room, have relied on birth control to 
exert control over their own futures. 
Yet, today, in the year 2022, many of 
those women are wondering if they will 
see that control disappear. 
Make no mistake about it, Madam 
Speaker, this is actually about control. 
An extreme GOP and extreme Supreme 
Court want to take away your freedom 
and your control over your own lives. 
Quite frankly, it is tragic. My col-
league is right. The idea that we are 
even standing here today having to 
consider legislation that would codify 
Americans’ 
right 
to 
contraception, 
birth control, and IUDs—and I can’t be-
lieve the gentlewoman mentioned Tro-
jan in her opening remarks. We are 
here because we are in an absurd time 
where an extremist GOP wants to take 
control. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on this legislation today. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. MIL-
LER-MEEKS). 
Mrs. 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Allowing Greater Access to Safe and 
Effective 
Contraception 
Act 
and 
against H.R. 8373. My colleague, Dr. MI-
CHAEL BURGESS, has listed its many 
flaws, and this is an extreme bill from 
a desperate majority. 
I was proud to join my colleague, 
Representative HINSON from Iowa, in 
introducing this bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the motion 
to recommit so we can bring this bill 
to the floor. This bill would make 
FDA-approved 
oral 
contraceptives 
available for over-the-counter use. 
In 2019, I championed similar legisla-
tion as a member of the Iowa State 
Senate that would allow women over 
the age of 18 to access over-the-counter 
oral contraceptives. 
As a physician, a former director of 
the Iowa Department of Public Health, 
and a mother, I understand how impor-
tant it is for women to have increased 
access to oral contraceptives. The Iowa 
Senate knew it, too, which is why our 
State senate passed that bill with over-
whelmingly bipartisan support, and it 
would have passed with only Repub-
lican support. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against H.R. 8373 and 
for the motion to recommit. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
over 
the 
past 
month, the issue of abortion has been a 
prevalent topic in the news in light of 
the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision. I 
am pro-life. Most of my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are not. But 
regardless of our stance, we can all 
agree that we should enact policies to 
reduce the number of women who feel 
the need to seek an abortion. 
The evidence is clear. One of the best 
ways we can prevent abortions is to in-
crease access to contraception. Re-
search has shown us time and time 
again that if you make it easier for 
women to access oral contraceptives, 
you lower the rate of unplanned preg-
nancies. 
Providing over-the-counter contra-
ceptives 
is 
safe 
and 
effective 
for 
women. Oral contraceptives were first 
approved by the Food and Drug Admin-
istration in 1960 and have been on the 
market since. But H.R. 8373 would 
allow non-FDA-approved drugs and de-
vices. 
The ones that have been approved are 
safe and pose fewer health risks than 
some drugs that are already being sold 
over the counter. Oral contraceptives 
are one of the most popular methods 
for preventing conception and avoiding 
pregnancy. 
In addition, women use birth control 
pills or oral contraceptives for a vari-
ety of other reasons. They can use 
them for regulating menstruation, to 
prevent anemia, to prevent painful 
heavy periods, and to address acne. 
Making oral contraceptives available 
over the counter will also provide bene-
fits to populations that have histori-
cally faced challenges in accessing 
healthcare, such as low-income, rural, 
and young women. The NIH conducted 
a study that compared women receiv-
ing oral contraceptives through a pre-
scription to women who were able to 
get 
oral 
contraceptives 
over 
the 
counter. The results of this study indi-
cated that women were more likely to 
continue taking oral contraceptives if 
they are able to buy them over the 
counter. 
We can also ensure that young 
women have timely and more afford-
able access to care, but we do not want 
women to circumvent getting their 
preventative healthcare. We can ensure 
that young women who are statis-
tically less likely to seek regular care 
at a primary care provider OB/GYN 
have access to oral contraceptives, and 
we can ensure that low-income women 
who may face financial challenges in 
taking time off their job to attend a 
doctor’s appointment still have access 
to oral contraceptives. 
I want to be clear that this bill is not 
an effort to circumvent the need for 
women to seek regular, preventative 
care. If oral contraceptives are ap-
proved for over-the-counter use, then 
women should continue to meet with 
their primary care provider, and they 
should continue to see their OB/GYN. 
It is imperative that women are fully 
apprised of any potential side effects of 
contraceptives and advised if they are 
at increased risk of potential side ef-
fects, but that is not what H.R. 8373 
does. It does not protect women’s 
health. 
In my experience as a doctor in car-
ing for women, we are knowledgeable; 
we are capable; and we are not going to 
avoid going to a doctor merely because 
we can get drugs or medicine without 
having seen that provider for a pre-
scription. So, I trust the intelligence 
and capabilities of women to make in-
formed decisions about their own care. 
Let me be clear. Our oral contracep-
tion bill is pro-family, pro-women, and 
pro-life. H.R. 8373 is not. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to do the right thing. Vote 
‘‘yes’’ on the motion to recommit and 
against H.R. 8373, and let’s bring this 
commonsense bill to the floor. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, in 
response to the previous speaker, this 
bill defines contraceptives as those le-
gally marketed under the Federal 
Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Nothing 
prevents the FDA from removing un-
safe products from the market. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. SCHRIER). Dr. KIM SCHRIER is a 
member of our committee. 
Ms. SCHRIER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague, Representative 
MANNING, for introducing this very 
straightforward bill. 
This bill affirms current law to en-
sure that women can determine the 
course of their lives and decide if, 
when, and under what circumstances to 
have a child. This is a fundamental 
right. 
Despite broad public support for 
birth control, we have already seen 
States use the Dobbs decision as an 
opening to try to block or ban certain 
methods of contraception. These ac-
tions bring a new sense of urgency to 
make sure no one can take away this 
very important tool from women. 
As a pediatrician, I have had the 
privilege of helping young women de-
cide which method of contraception 
would be best for them, and not one of 
them wanted to become pregnant any 
time soon. Everybody should be able to 
choose the contraceptive that meets 
their needs without interference from 
politicians. 
This is not a controversial bill. It af-
firms our right to use contraception 
and for doctors to prescribe contracep-
tion. Frankly, it should get unanimous 
support in the Chamber. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, to clarify, the bill de-
fines both contraceptive and contracep-
tion. Contraceptive is FDA approved; 
contraception is not limited to FDA- 
approved licensed products. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Indiana 
(Mr. 
BUCSHON). Dr. LARRY
BUCSHON
is a 
leader on the Energy and Commerce 
Committee. 
Mr. BUCSHON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 8373.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6933 
July 21, 2022 
The bill isn’t about access to tradi-
tional contraception. It is about pre-
serving access to abortion drugs. 
As a physician, I adamantly believe 
that treatment decisions should be 
made by a patient and their provider. 
In making that decision, they need to 
be fully informed, knowing what we are 
using, for what purpose, and whether 
the FDA has determined it is, number 
one, safe; and, number two, unless the 
drug falls under right-to-try laws, fully 
proven to be effective. 
The legislation defines a contracep-
tive as any device or medication used 
to prevent pregnancy, whether specifi-
cally used to prevent pregnancy or for 
other health needs. There is no expla-
nation of what the device or medica-
tion might be, and no definition for 
other health needs. 
The bill is dangerously vague. It 
could be applied to chemical abortion 
drugs to end a pregnancy in addition to 
traditional contraceptives. It could be 
used to provide statutory access to 
drugs without the guidance and admin-
istration of a trained healthcare pro-
fessional or without any FDA review. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this ill-crafted bill. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER), who is a 
member of our committee. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Right to Contra-
ception Act as an original cosponsor. I 
thank Representative MANNING for her 
leadership—and 
her 
co-leads, 
Rep-
resentatives CRAIG, JACOBS, and WIL-
LIAMS—on this important bill, which 
responds to the very real threats to ac-
cess to reproductive healthcare and to 
bodily autonomy that we face today. 
We saw this threat in Justice Thom-
as’ concurring opinion in the Dobbs 
case, suggesting the landmark case of 
Griswold v. Connecticut, which gave 
married couples the right to use birth 
control, should be revisited and over-
turned. We see these threats from some 
in this body and legislatures across the 
country. We certainly see it in Texas. 
We also see that this effort does not 
represent the desires of the vast major-
ity of people I represent who rely on 
contraception of all kinds every single 
day and have for more than 50 years. 
Yet, we see these efforts to block 
women from accessing contraception 
that works for them, including IUDs. 
Once again, I am proud to protect the 
health, privacy, dignity, and autonomy 
of women and families across this 
country by voting ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, 
and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
b 1000 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), our majority 
leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I have three daughters. They are all 
adults. They are all amazed that we are 
here debating this issue. The ranking 
member said, me too; obviously, for 
different reasons. 
In 1965, the Supreme Court—long be-
fore any of the present Justices had 
these theories about what due process 
is and is not—said that women had a 
constitutional right and, in addition, 
men, to seek services related to family 
planning. 
Madam Speaker, women’s rights are 
under assault in America. From the 
very beginning, of course, women were 
second-class citizens until we radi-
cally, in the beginning of the last cen-
tury, decided, oh, well, women are part 
of America and we are going to let 
them vote. And successively, we have 
taken steps to treat women equally. 
The 
Supreme 
Court’s 
extremist 
Dobbs v. Jackson decision overturned 
49 years of legal precedent and erased 
decades of progress toward women’s 
equality. This bill deals with 57 years 
of constitutional law, since 1965, when 
Griswold was decided 7–2. It was not a 
controversial opinion with the Amer-
ican people nor, frankly, is this bill 
controversial, of whatever faith you 
may be. 
Not only did Republican-appointed 
Justices strip women of their constitu-
tional right to access safe, legal abor-
tions, they also opened the door for 
lawmakers to restrict women’s ability 
to make reproductive healthcare deci-
sions. 
Justice Thomas, of course, as all of 
us know, issued a radical concurring 
opinion that called for a reconsider-
ation of landmark legal precedents, 
one of which we are dealing with today, 
Griswold v. Connecticut, as I said, de-
cided in 1965, which established Ameri-
cans’ constitutional right to contracep-
tion. 
Birth control allows women and their 
partners to make essential decisions 
about their health and their lives, in-
cluding whether to have children and 
start a family. That is the consensus in 
America, overwhelmingly. 
Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has 
put all forms of contraception in jeop-
ardy with this decision. Now, some say, 
No, it doesn’t. But Justice Thomas 
points out that the rationale of Dobbs 
is equally applicable from his perspec-
tive and, in my opinion, from his per-
spective, he is probably right, for him-
self and for radical members of the 
Court. 
Restricting contraceptives means un-
dermining women’s health, personal 
privacy, and bodily autonomy. Now, 
there are many authoritarian regimes 
in the world that don’t take any con-
sideration into the rights we have over 
our own bodies. 
Madam Speaker, we need to do every-
thing we can here in Congress to en-
sure that all Americans have access to 
safe, reliable contraceptive care. That 
is why I am pleased to bring this bill to 
the floor. 
And I thank KATHY MANNING for her 
leadership on the Right to Contracep-
tion Act. I also want to thank Rep-
resentatives WILLIAMS, JACOBS, and 
CRAIG, as well as LIZZIE FLETCHER, who 
just spoke, for their leadership on this 
bill. I am grateful to them for standing 
up on this issue, as well as to Chairman 
PALLONE, for moving quickly to ad-
vance this bill through the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
This legislation will enshrine the 
constitutional rights established by 
Griswold v. Connecticut and Eisenstadt 
v. Baird in Federal statute, ensuring 
that Americans can access contracep-
tive care legally wherever they live. 
As I said at the beginning, my three 
daughters are amazed that this legisla-
tion is on the floor; amazed that there 
would be a premise that somehow the 
Constitution did not guarantee to my 
three daughters the right to make 
these decisions and not all of us. 
This is about freedom. This is about 
individual integrity. And this vote will 
show the American people where Mem-
bers stand on this question of whether 
it should continue to be legal for peo-
ple in this country to pursue family 
planning as they perceive they want to 
do. 
So let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ to promote wom-
en’s health. Let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ to prevent 
further restrictions on women’s basic 
rights to privacy and autonomy. 
Let’s vote ‘‘yes’’ for freedom. There 
is a lot of talk about freedom, right up 
until the time one decides to restrict 
that freedom, and then it is okay. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes’’ to protect the Constitution, the 
constitutional precedents, and free-
dom. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to clar-
ify, this legislation never went through 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
The only debate was in the Rules Com-
mittee. 
And I also stand here proud that, in 
2020, on the 100th anniversary of women 
gaining the right to vote, led by pro- 
life Republican women who fought for 
decades, we have a record number of 
women serving in the House of Rep-
resentatives, a record number of Re-
publican women. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. VAN 
DUYNE), a Member from the class of 
2020. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to adamantly oppose H.R. 
8373, the payouts for Planned Parent-
hood act, a poorly drafted and loosely 
defined bill that would be detrimental 
to women’s health and send taxpayer 
dollars straight to abortion-on-demand 
beneficiaries. 
This bill is not about contraceptives 
which would prevent a pregnancy. This 
bill is about funding unlimited access 
to abortion pills. 
A woman’s decision to get contracep-
tive pills should be an informed deci-
sion between her and her doctor, and 
not a pop-up ad. 
H.R. 8373 would allow providers to ad-
minister non-FDA-approved abortion

pills under the guise of preventing 
pregnancy without considering the side 
effects, the overall safety of the drug, 
or its intended use. 
And I would inform the majority 
leader that in 1965, the ability to pop a 
pill to terminate a pregnancy didn’t 
even exist, so it is, therefore, not con-
sidered a right. 
This bill will send Federal tax dollars 
to Planned Parenthood, override State 
laws, subvert parental rights, and void 
requirements for informed consent for 
sterilizations. 
This is not about protecting access to 
contraception, but, rather, federally 
subsidizing abortion providers and al-
lowing unapproved, dangerous contra-
ceptive drugs to be widely available. 
This bill is the Democrats’ latest at-
tempt at normalizing the radical agen-
da. Just last week, we voted on Demo-
crats’ abortion-on-demand bill that ad-
vocated abortion until the birth of a 
child. You want to talk about extreme? 
I am so sick of hearing about what 
women’s rights are from a party that 
can’t even define what a woman is. 
I stand in front of you, a very proud 
woman, and I can tell you that 
aborting a fully formed child is not a 
woman’s right. The abortion industry 
continues to lie to women and put 
their lives at risk in order to line their 
pockets, with the full support of my 
colleagues on the left. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
H.R. 8373 and work on moving legisla-
tion that protects the unborn and em-
powers their mothers. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to the time that remains 
on both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
BROWN of Ohio). The gentleman from 
New Jersey has 143⁄4 minutes remain-
ing. 
The gentlewoman from Washington 
has 83⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. JACOBS) who is a 
co-lead on this legislation. 
Ms. JACOBS of California. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the chairman for 
making sure this bill could come to the 
floor so swiftly. I thank my friend, 
Congresswoman MANNING, for her part-
nership on co-leading this bill with me. 
And I thank Speaker PELOSI for her 
continued leadership in this post-Roe 
reality. 
Madam Speaker, this bill could not 
be more important because, for me and 
for tens of millions of Americans, these 
threats from Justice Thomas and the 
Supreme Court to take away our right 
to contraception are not abstract. 
I have lived my entire life with this 
constitutional right to contraception, 
and it is a right I have exercised for 
decades, whether it was the birth con-
trol pills I used when I was a teenager 
to address debilitating cramps, the IUD 
I have relied on for years, or the Plan 
B I have used at times that was, thank-
fully, available over the counter when I 
needed it. 
I am probably the first person ever to 
speak about using Plan B on the House 
floor, and I know I am the first person 
in at least 35 years to talk about my 
period here. But you know what? We 
should be talking about it. 
We should be talking about periods 
and birth control and the healthcare 
that millions of Americans need for our 
everyday lives because this is not a 
side issue that only affects some peo-
ple. This is a kitchen–table issue. 
The decision of how, if, and when to 
grow a family are decisions that are 
personal and private and should never 
be decided by the Supreme Court or 
Congress. It is a decision that is funda-
mental to our autonomy, our agency, 
and our ability to control our own 
lives. 
As a young woman, reproductive 
healthcare is my healthcare, and I am 
so grateful that, today, we will take a 
step to codifying that access into law. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
bill. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. 
JOYCE), a leader on the Energy and 
Commerce Committee. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for 
yielding. 
I rise today in opposition to this leg-
islation that has been rushed to the 
floor with no oversight, and without a 
single hearing in the Energy and Com-
merce Health Subcommittee, the sub-
committee of jurisdiction. 
It is clear that the majority is, once 
again, trying to score cheap political 
points in the press and, in the process, 
the patients’ and their health out-
comes have not been evaluated. 
This type of political malpractice 
would be similar to a doctor who pre-
scribes a medication or recommends a 
surgery without doing the evaluation 
of the patient, without doing the due 
diligence, and without discussing the 
course of treatment which is best. 
We cannot continue to rush to legis-
lation without seeing the entire pic-
ture. 
As a doctor, and as a Representative, 
I urge my colleagues to reject this bill 
and allow the committee of jurisdic-
tion to do the work that is necessary in 
order to bring effective legislation to 
the floor. 
b 1015 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
my friends on the other side of the 
aisle must have amnesia. You know 
why we are on this floor today? Be-
cause of the Dobbs case from a run-
away Supreme Court, dominated by 
Members who answered that they un-
derstood precedent in Roe v. Wade and 
ignored it. 
I thank Congresswoman MANNING and 
all of the cosponsors who recognize 
that we have to methodically protect 
women. Do you know what is hap-
pening to doctors? Every news station 
will have doctors on, frightened about 
what they should do about women’s 
healthcare. 
This is important legislation, Right 
to Contraception, because it does deal 
with 
menstrual 
regulation, 
endo-
metriosis, or hormonal imbalance. 
Teenagers are given this because of 
menstrual problems, but those who 
don’t understand this, they are stand-
ing on the floor talking about this is a 
runaway bill. 
If it is coronavirus, the monkey pox, 
or any other health matter, it is Demo-
crats who are saving America. This leg-
islation is definitely needed because 
the Supreme Court has trampled on the 
Constitution, trampled on the Ninth 
Amendment, trampled on equal protec-
tion under the law. 
I support H.R. 8373. The women who 
are in need, who are vulnerable, who 
are 
individuals, 
who 
are 
minority 
women need this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to rise in 
strong support of H.R. 8373, the ‘‘Right to 
Contraception Act.’’ 
H.R. 8373 would expressly assert the right 
of an individual to obtain and utilize contracep-
tion. 
This would include any FDA approved de-
vice or medication used to prevent pregnancy, 
whether specifically used for that goal, or for 
other health needs like menstrual regulation, 
endometriosis, or hormonal imbalance. 
Additionally, the ‘‘Right to Contraception 
Act’’ would outline the rights of healthcare pro-
viders to prescribe and dispense contracep-
tives and relevant information to patients. 
This bill would require lawmakers who at-
tempt to place additional requirements on pro-
viders or access to contraception to prove that 
the requirement significantly advances access 
to contraceptives and that access could not be 
better achieved by other methods. 
Birth control pills, IUDs, and other forms of 
contraception are all forms of safe and essen-
tial healthcare. 
They are central to women’s ability to par-
ticipate equally in the workplace, in academia, 
and in society. 
The right to contraceptives has long been 
an expectation held by the American people. 
In 1965, the United States Supreme Court’s 
decision in Griswald v. Connecticut affirmed a 
married couple’s right to birth control. In 1972, 
Eisenstadt v. Baird protected that right for sin-
gle people. Then in 1977, the right to contra-
ception for minors was secured in Carey v. 
Population Services International. 
For more than 50 years, the right to contra-
ception has been settled law. 
That is, until the Supreme Court’s recent rul-
ing in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Or-
ganization, when five conservative Justices 
chose to let their personal opinions and beliefs 
supersede decades of established precedent 
by overturning women’s right to abortion. 
Since then, the American people have wit-
nessed the abhorrent consequences of Re-
publicans’ radical agenda to criminalize wom-
en’s reproductive health decisions. 
In his concurring opinion, Justice Clarence 
Thomas made it very clear that the extremist 
ruling that ended Roe v. Wade could be used 
to chop away at other rights—including the 
right to access contraception.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6935 
July 21, 2022 
Reproductive rights opponents are now in-
cluding emergency contraception, IUDs, and 
other forms of birth control in their anti-abor-
tion legislation. 
These anti-abortion laws shackle women to 
unwanted pregnancies. 
Conservative lawmakers now seek to stop 
women from exerting agency over the preven-
tion of pregnancy, as well. 
If a woman is not permitted to end a preg-
nancy, and she is not permitted to prevent a 
pregnancy, I ask you, what rights to her body 
does she have left? 
The ability to make personal choices about 
one’s own body is the most basic of funda-
mental human rights. 
That right is engraved into the very founda-
tion of our Nation and inked into the hallowed 
lines of the U.S. Constitution. 
Do we not uphold our Constitution for its 
promise of life, liberty, and pursuit of happi-
ness? 
How then, can we withhold those rights from 
half of our population by robbing women of 
agency over their bodies? 
In 1965, the United States Supreme Court 
made the 7–2 Griswold v. Connecticut ruling 
that established the right for married couples 
to utilize contraception. 
This decision was not determined by the 
personal belief systems of those Justices nor 
their approval or disapproval of contraception. 
No, the right to access contraception was 
upheld by the promise of unenumerated rights 
and due process for all American people—as 
outlined in the United States Bill of Rights. 
As my colleagues know, the 9th Amend-
ment states that the federal government does 
not retain final authority over the rights that 
are not listed in the Constitution. 
The Bill of Rights does not exhaust all the 
rights retained by the people. 
Instead, those undocumented rights belong 
to the people, as does the right to contracep-
tion. 
Also, as a hallmark of democracy, the 14th 
Amendment ensures that no right afforded to 
the American people can be taken away with-
out due process of law, while also guaran-
teeing all Americans that they shall have equal 
protection under the law. 
The assurances of the 14th Amendment be-
came part of our national governing docu-
ments as a protection against those who 
would use their power to wipe away the free-
doms of others without restraint or consent of 
the governed. 
Unfortunately, it is just as necessary and 
relevant today as it was when it was ratified in 
1868. 
Even before the barbaric Dobbs ruling, con-
servative lawmakers across the country have 
been moving to limit women’s ability to make 
decisions about their own healthcare and bod-
ies. 
In 2021 alone, at least 4 states attempted to 
ban access to some or all contraceptives by 
restricting public funding for these products 
and services. 
Those laws work in conjunction with actions 
conservative legislators in red states have 
taken to curtail funding for family planning 
services at reproductive health centers like 
Planned Parenthood. 
Such actions would limit access to birth con-
trol, particularly for Black and Brown low-in-
come women. 
A 2010 study found that access to contra-
ceptive care resulted in approximately one mil-
lion fewer unplanned conceptions per year. 
That is one million fewer children born into 
families who are unprepared to support them. 
When access to contraceptives is limited, 
more children are born into lives of difficulty 
and hardship. 
After Texas Republicans excluded Planned 
Parenthood from its public family planning pro-
gram for low-income women, there was a 35 
percent drop in prescriptions for long-acting, 
reversible contraceptives and a 31 percent 
drop in the use of injectable contraceptives. 
This caused a more than 25 percent in-
crease in unintended births—largely among 
Black and Brown low-income women. 
H.R. 8373, the ‘‘Right to Contraception Act,’’ 
would help ensure that children are born into 
families who are eager, equipped, and pre-
pared for their arrival. 
We cannot allow human rights to be so cal-
lously stripped away from the American peo-
ple. 
We must fight back and codify these rights 
into law. 
Contraception allows individuals, couples, 
and families to be in control of their own fu-
tures. 
Contraception can allow a young woman to 
achieve her dreams of earning a college de-
gree. 
It can allow a young couple to prioritize their 
careers before raising a child. 
It can allow parents to focus their financial 
and emotional resources on the care of a spe-
cial needs son or daughter. 
It is a tool that allows those who wish to be-
come parents, and those who do not, the 
agency to make the decision that is best for 
them. 
The Right to Contraception Act asserts that 
we will no longer allow the human rights of 
women to be infringed. 
If conservative legislators and conservative 
Justices intend to continue to attempt to limit 
access to reproductive rights, we will fight 
back. 
We will not allow women to be regulated 
like reproductive chattel. 
American women deserve to have the final 
authority over their own bodies and their own 
lives, including whether or not to become 
pregnant and become a parent. 
Contraception is on the front lines of this 
battle. 
That is why I support H.R. 8373, the ‘‘Right 
to Contraception Act’’, and encourage my col-
leagues to do so as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE), the co-chair 
of the Pro-Choice Caucus. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 8373, of which I am a proud origi-
nal cosponsor. I thank Congresswoman 
MANNING for her tremendous leadership 
and 
also 
Chairman 
PALLONE
and 
Speaker PELOSI for bringing this bill to 
the floor. 
As co-chair of the Pro-Choice Caucus, 
I know how important this bill is, espe-
cially after the Supreme Court’s recent 
decision overturning abortion access. 
Radical extremists have been clear 
that they will be going after rights like 
contraception next, and that is just 
downright outrageous. 
It is hard to imagine so many free-
doms are being taken away: abortion 
and contraception, no access to family 
planning, and, of course, no support at 
all from Republicans for comprehen-
sive sex education. 
Everyone should have the freedom to 
make decisions about their bodies, 
their lives, and their future. That in-
cludes the right to choose which FDA- 
approved method of contraception is 
best for them. 
The Pro-Choice Caucus, and many of 
us, have urged the FDA to make birth 
control available over the counter. 
Safety and efficacy are extremely im-
portant, and I urge the FDA to move 
quickly but carefully. Birth control 
must be safe. I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, my 
new district is actually where Susan B. 
Anthony, a pro-life woman Republican 
who got us our right to vote, actually 
was tried for voting. I am just happy 
and proud to represent that district. 
We are elected Representatives. We 
should respect the Constitution and 
due process by debating these issues 
through regular order, getting the 
input from the people we represent, not 
the political partisans on one side or 
the other. 
If we allow the majority to under-
mine constitutional safeguards for an 
imagined and fake emergency, they 
will create more imagined emergencies 
in the future to violate and undermine 
our constitutional principles and the 
right of the people to have a voice 
through representative government. 
The law is clear. For years, the Su-
preme Court has consistently found 
that Americans continue to have ac-
cess to many safe forms of contracep-
tives. Yet, we are here today, listening 
to another imagined emergency to try 
to repeal this right. The right to con-
traception is safe. This is not an emer-
gency. 
Justice Alito’s majority decision in 
Dobbs versus Jackson was clear. The 
decision to return the issue of abortion 
to the States does not impact other 
issues like marriage or contraception 
as stated numerous times by Justice 
Alito in his opinion. 
The real reason we are here today is 
because some of our colleagues would 
like to distract and scare the American 
people and score cheap political points 
rather than tackle the bread-and-but-
ter issues affecting all Americans. 
The majority won’t admit that their 
radical spending and war on energy 
have driven inflation and gas prices to 
record levels. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute now to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. CLARK), our 
Assistant Speaker.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6936 
July 21, 2022 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, today we vote to pro-
tect the right to obtain and use birth 
control, a choice that should be yours 
and yours alone. 
As a reminder, the year is 2022, not 
1922, not 1822. It is well established. 
Birth control is central to a person’s 
ability to plan their future, to care for 
their families, get an education, have a 
career. 
But the extremist Republican Party 
is determined to take us back in time 
and take away our freedoms. Politi-
cians have no business in your bedroom 
or your doctor’s office. 
They are coming for birth control. 
They are coming for IVF. We have seen 
the plans. We have seen the legislation. 
House Democrats are taking a stand. 
We will defend our rights and defeat 
the Republicans’ assault on freedom. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄4 minutes to 
the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
SMITH), a champion for life. 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam 
Speaker, several pro-abortion policies 
are embedded in this bill, including 
section 4(b)(1), which states that ‘‘any 
healthcare providers who provide con-
traceptives may not be singled out 
through any limitation or require-
ment.’’ 
What does that language mean? Sim-
ply put, any Federal or State policy 
that ensures that taxpayer-funded fam-
ily planning clinics are not colocated 
with abortion clinics would now be ab-
solutely prohibited under the bill. 
In 2019, President Trump promul-
gated the protect life rule, reestab-
lishing Ronald Reagan’s Title X rule 
that prohibited taxpayer funding of the 
hundreds of family planning clinics 
that were colocated with abortion clin-
ics. All funds were then redirected to 
family planning clinics that were not 
taking the lives of unborn babies. 
The original Title X statute of 1970 
made clear that voluntary family plan-
ning projects should not be in a pro-
gram where abortion is a method of 
family 
planning. 
President 
Reagan 
issued that rule in 1988. It was upheld 
by the U.S. Supreme Court in Rust v. 
Sullivan. 
Any future President now, if this leg-
islation is enacted, would be precluded 
by law from reestablishing the protect 
life rule or any similar policy. Madam 
Speaker, Title X was intended to be 
about family planning, not abortion 
promotion. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, may 
I ask, again, about the time remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 101⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentlewoman from 
Washington has 5 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Colorado (Ms. DEGETTE), the 
chairwoman of the Subcommittee on 
Oversight and Investigations. 
Ms. DEGETTE. Madam Speaker, at 
the hearing I had on this issue in my 
subcommittee 
the 
other 
day, 
Dr. 
Resneck, the president of the AMA, 
said he doesn’t want to have, when he 
is in clinic with a patient, a State At-
torney General sitting on his shoulder. 
I know how he feels because many of 
my colleagues on the other side not 
only want to stop a patient’s ability 
and decision to have an abortion, they 
apparently want to tell people now 
what kinds of birth control they can 
use. 
Today I have heard my colleagues on 
the other side say falsely that IUDs, 
that chemical birth control, that other 
forms 
of 
birth 
control 
are 
‘‘abortifacients.’’ Not only is this pat-
ently untrue, but it harms millions of 
Americans. 
I would say that I think everybody 
listening to this debate is probably 
confused. My colleagues say, oh, we 
support birth control. But make no 
mistake about it, there have been bills 
in a number of States, and there have 
been bills in this body to ban common 
forms of birth control—not abortion, 
birth control—and that has got to stop. 
My colleagues across the aisle, they 
think that the rhythm method or 
condoms or something like that are 
okay, but the things women use to stop 
getting pregnant can’t be used, and I 
think that is important to point out. 
I think every woman in America 
needs to know this, and, frankly, every 
patient in America should be able to 
make their open decision about their 
healthcare for abortion and birth con-
trol. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. LOIS FRANKEL), co- 
chair of the Democratic Women’s Cau-
cus. 
Ms. LOIS FRANKEL of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, my, my. Mark my 
words. The Supreme Court’s decision to 
dismantle abortion was just the start 
of extreme unnecessary intrusion of 
our personal lives by Republicans. 
Next on their list? Limit the right to 
buy and use the birth control that give 
women the ability to plan their fami-
lies. 
Listen to this: This is not imaginary. 
This is happening right now. Madam 
Speaker, I was in the room during com-
mittee debate when Republicans tried 
to go back to the horse-and-buggy days 
of birth control. 
On birth control counseling, condoms 
only, they said, say no to even the 
mention of medically approved contra-
ception like implants and IUDs. Real-
ly? That is crazy, and that is why we 
need to pass this bill right now, the 
Right to Contraception Act. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), 
the 
Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I know that your committee, Energy 
and Commerce, has a full legislative 
load, and you prioritized this and made 
the time so that we could bring this to 
the floor in a timely fashion because it 
means so much. 
As our distinguished colleague from 
Florida, 
Congresswoman 
FRANKEL, 
said, my, my. Here we are. 
I rise today in strong support of the 
Right to Contraception Act, which is 
to defend access to birth control from 
the radical rightwing assault on repro-
ductive rights. 
It is outrageous that nearly 60 years 
after Griswold was decided, women 
must, once again, fight for funda-
mental freedom to determine the size 
and timing of their families or if they 
even want young people having contra-
ception in their exercise of freedom. 
But as Republicans turn back the 
clock 
on 
contraception, 
Democrats 
today are making it clear we are not 
going back. 
I wonder if some of our colleagues, or 
even people who are advocating to pre-
vent contraception, know what is going 
on in their own families, with their 
spouses or with their children, and the 
rest. Could it be that they are all just 
not using contraception? 
Again, thank you to KATHY MANNING, 
our lead sponsor. She has been so cou-
rageous so early on this subject, and I 
congratulate her and her staff for being 
so ready, as I commend the chairman, 
for accommodating the legislation. 
I also join in thanking SARA JACOBS, 
ANGIE
CRAIG, and NIKEMA
WILLIAMS, 
her cosponsors, on this legislation. 
Again, thank you, Chairman PALLONE 
for your support. 
Let’s be clear, that punishing and 
controlling women for using birth con-
trol is just another plank in the Repub-
lican extreme agenda for America, but 
House Democrats are fighting back. 
Our Right to Contraception Act en-
shrines into law the unequivocal statu-
tory right to obtain and use contracep-
tion, and it protects against any ex-
tremist State laws that would seek to 
restrict that access. 
That way, even if the radical Repub-
lican supermajority on the Supreme 
Court succeeds in its mission to over-
turn Griswold, no American can be de-
nied the basic right to birth control 
through contraception. 
This is a matter of women’s health to 
prevent unintended pregnancies and to 
treat or prevent many medical condi-
tions. 
Contraception is a medical tool be-
yond contraception. This is a matter of 
economic justice. This is a kitchen- 
table issue for America’s families, as 
access to contraception is linked to 
higher rates of education and employ-
ment, while reducing poverty. 
b 1030 
This is an assault on lower-income 
people in our country, many of them 
people of color. This is an economic 
justice assault, as well. 
Importantly, this is a matter of fun-
damental freedom to make your own

decisions about your own body and 
your own life. Proudly, the people are 
with us: 96 percent of voters agree that 
Americans should have access to con-
traception. 
By passing the Right to Contracep-
tion Act, House Democrats take an-
other strong step to protect freedom 
for women and for every American. 
Last week, our proud pro-choice, pro- 
women Democratic majority passed 
two major bills to restore and protect 
health freedom. 
Our Ensuring Women’s Right to Re-
productive Freedom Act will protect 
the fundamental right to travel and ob-
tain needed healthcare. That passed 
the House last week. 
Our Women’s Health Protection Act 
will restore the essential protections of 
Roe v. Wade all across the country. 
Republicans have been clear, Madam 
Speaker, and the Republican leader in 
the Senate has been clear: The goal is 
to ban abortion in our country. The As-
sociate Justice of the Court has been 
clear; we have only just begun to over-
turn women’s rights and individual 
freedom and privacy when it comes to 
interaction among us all. 
Earlier this week, the House passed 
the landmark Respect for Marriage Act 
to ensure that marriage equality re-
mains the law of the land now and for 
generations to come, whether it is 
interracial marriage, whatever. 
Let’s be clear. Those who have op-
posed this vital legislation are only re-
vealing their dark desire to punish and 
control Americans’ most intimate and 
personal decisions. 
Madam Speaker, those of us who 
have served here for a while can tell 
you that House Republicans have been 
against contraception for decades. I 
couldn’t even get our colleagues to 
vote for natural family planning. 
When the Catholic Church came to us 
and said we need a correction in the 
law so that funds for natural family 
planning can go forth, Republican col-
leagues said: Let us be clear. We are 
against family planning domestically 
or internationally, globally. 
We had one Republican vote with us 
and were able to pass the legislation, 
as requested by the Catholic Church. 
What is this about? They are against 
birth control, but they are for control-
ling women. This is about servitude. 
This is about servitude. 
We couldn’t convince people. I would 
say to people that this isn’t just about 
abortion. I understand people’s posi-
tion on that. I come from a pro-life 
family. I respect people’s views. But 
this is about more than that. This is 
about 
contraception, 
birth 
control, 
family planning. But now it is clear. 
Today, we will have a vote on the 
right to contraception, and we will see 
where our Republican friends are. I 
hope they will be with us. We don’t put 
this bill forth to put you on the spot. 
We put this forth to put women in con-
trol of their situation. 
I ask those who oppose contracep-
tion, again, do you even know what is 
going on in your own families? Why 
don’t you ask? Do we need a session on 
the birds and the bees to talk about 
why this is important? What is going 
on here? Is the blind desire to have 
women controlled and in servitude 
such that they don’t even want to 
know the truth about family planning 
and contraception? 
It is never too late, even though you 
may have opposed this in the past, to 
stand up for the rights of your wives, 
your daughters, your granddaughters, 
and all of America’s women. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a strong, 
hopefully bipartisan vote for the Right 
to Contraception Act. I thank the mak-
ers of this motion; I thank the gentle-
woman from North Carolina (Ms. MAN-
NING) for her leadership, the gentle-
woman from California (Ms. JACOBS), 
the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. 
WILLIAMS), the gentlewoman from Min-
nesota (Ms. CRAIG), and so many other 
cosponsors for their leadership. There 
is a long list of cosponsors, over 150 im-
mediately. I very much thank the 
chairman for making this possible 
today. 
Madam Speaker, I urge an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, again, so proud that 
it was pro-life Republican women like 
Susan B. Anthony who led the right to 
vote over 100 years ago. Just to correct 
the record, both Speaker PELOSI and 
Majority Leader HOYER suggested that 
there was a legislative hearing. I don’t 
remember any legislative action. I 
would ask the chairman, was there any 
legislative action on this bill? 
Mr. 
PALLONE. 
Will 
the 
gentle-
woman yield? 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. I 
yield to the gentleman from New Jer-
sey. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, they 
weren’t suggesting that there was a 
legislative hearing, just that the En-
ergy and Commerce Committee worked 
to get this bill drafted with Ms. MAN-
NING and her staff. 
Mrs. RODGERS of Washington. Re-
claiming 
my 
time, 
Congresswoman 
DIANA DEGETTE, my colleague on the 
committee, said that we had a hearing. 
It was an Oversight and Reform Com-
mittee hearing on Dobbs. I want to 
quote because what the Democrat wit-
ness said confirms the Democrats’ 
abortion on demand until birth act. 
The Democrat witness said: People find 
out they need abortions through their 
pregnancies, yes, at any time for any 
reason. The issue at hand is the Demo-
crats’ extreme agenda, abortion on de-
mand up until birth. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Oklahoma (Mrs. 
BICE), a proud member of the class of 
2020 with record Republican women. 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I am offended that the other 
side of the aisle would make false accu-
sations about Republicans’ positions on 
contraception. This is fearmongering of 
the highest degree. 
I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 
8373, the so-called Right to Contracep-
tion Act. This problematic legislation 
reinforces the left’s pro-abortion agen-
da by utilizing an overly broad defini-
tion of contraception that includes 
pregnancy-terminating abortion drugs. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle would incorrectly have the 
American people believe that Repub-
licans don’t care about women’s access 
to contraception. This is false. In fact, 
a report released just this week by the 
Independent 
Women’s 
Voice 
dem-
onstrated that 84 percent of Republican 
primary voters support safe access to 
contraceptives. 
I am pro-life, and I support a wom-
an’s right to access contraception. 
That is why I introduced H.R. 8421, the 
Access to Safe Contraception Act, 
which would preempt States from es-
tablishing a ban on contraceptives 
while still respecting pro-life values. 
My legislation would safeguard access 
to contraception for Americans, includ-
ing my two daughters, and impor-
tantly, does not protect the use of 
pregnancy-ending medications, such as 
chemical abortion pills. 
I am also concerned that the bill we 
are considering today could endanger 
women by allowing the use of products 
or methods that are not FDA-approved. 
Madam Speaker, I say to my col-
leagues that we should reject this bill 
and instead bring up legislation to pro-
tect access to contraception in a way 
that respects the pro-life values of mil-
lions of Americans. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, as the 
chair of the Contraception and Family 
Planning Task Force of the Pro-Choice 
Caucus and as a woman who lives in 
America, I rise today in strong support 
of the Right to Contraception Act, 
which would ensure every American 
has the federally protected right to ac-
cess the birth control method that 
works for them. 
Birth control is healthcare, plain and 
simple, and it is critical to women’s 
health and women’s equality. And no 
one—not the Supreme Court, not Con-
gress, not your boss—should be able to 
interfere with your family decisions. 
We have seen just how far this Court 
of unelected Justices will go to erode 
our constitutionally protected rights, 
which is why I am proud to support 
this very necessary bill today to create 
a Federal right for providers to provide 
and patients to receive contraceptive 
services. 
Madam Speaker, it is of great ur-
gency that this House pass this critical 
bill today and afford us the agency to 
make our own healthcare decisions. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, the Re-
publicans are so upset. The reality is it

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6938 
July 21, 2022 
is their Supreme Court and Justice 
Alito who opened Pandora’s box. When 
we opened up the box and looked in, we 
saw there were nesting eggs. There 
were all kinds of issues there that were 
going to come to the fore. 
Clarence Thomas put a spotlight on 
it. It involved gay marriage and con-
traception. It was going to go further 
than Roe v. Wade. When they said they 
were originalists, we didn’t realize 
what they meant by ‘‘originalist’’ was 
everything origin came from them. 
They didn’t care about precedent. 
Alito said Roe v. Wade was important 
precedent. Gorsuch and Kavanaugh 
said it was precedent that Roe v. Wade 
was settled. You can’t trust the Su-
preme Court. They are radicals. They 
want to overturn privacy rights for all 
people in this country. 
Freedom is at stake. This bill needs 
to pass, and the only reason this bill is 
properly before this Congress is be-
cause of that Supreme Court that has 
gone off the radical right. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS.) 
Ms. ADAMS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Right to 
Contraception Act. 
Family planning is a private deci-
sion, and contraception should always 
be legal, from prophylactics to Plan B. 
The Supreme Court’s decision in 
Dobbs has opened Pandora’s box. For 
some Justices, judges, and State legis-
lators, the next steps include rolling 
back established rights and precedents, 
including the right to contraception. 
That is why the Right to Contracep-
tion Act is so important. This legisla-
tion establishes a statutory right to 
obtain 
contraceptives 
and 
for 
healthcare providers to provide them. 
It protects Americans from State and 
local legislation that would deny peo-
ple’s access to contraceptives. 
From reproductive care to LGBTQ 
rights, and now to contraceptives, Con-
gress has a responsibility to stop State 
governments from rolling back our 
rights. My granddaughters shouldn’t 
have fewer rights than my daughter 
had. Pass the Right to Contraception 
Act. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN), a 
member of our committee. 
Mrs. 
TRAHAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
standing here today, 4 weeks after the 
Supreme Court’s disastrous decision to 
overturn Roe, I fear for the future of 
my children. 
I fear for a future where Republican 
leaders agree with Clarence Thomas 
that the right for same-sex marriage 
should be revisited, that the right to 
birth control should be reexamined. 
Let me be clear: Neither of those rights 
should be up for debate. 
We voted this week to protect mar-
riage equality. We will vote today to 
protect contraception. For those who 
believe this issue isn’t on the minds of 
millions of Americans, open your eyes. 
Republicans in Idaho and Louisiana are 
pushing to ban forms of birth control. 
The Governor of Mississippi refused to 
rule out a contraception ban. Even the 
Republican Study Committee, which 
represents most House Republicans, 
has proposed eliminating contracep-
tion access programs for low-income 
Americans. That is not pro-life. It is 
antiwoman. 
Wake up already and join us in pass-
ing this critical legislation. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
ask you one more time how much time 
remains on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New Jersey has 23⁄4 min-
utes remaining. The gentlewoman from 
Washington has 21⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY). 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, there is no de-
mocracy if women do not have control 
over their own bodies, including repro-
ductive healthcare. 
Twenty-seven days ago, an extremist 
majority on the Supreme Court ful-
filled the Republican Party’s decades- 
old goal of overturning Roe v. Wade. 
Next on the chopping block is marriage 
equality and contraception. 
Make no mistake, these rightwing 
extremists are not pro-life but pro-gov-
ernment 
controlling 
the 
bodies 
of 
women and girls. Their goal is to ban 
abortion in this country. 
Today, the House will pass Congress-
woman MANNING’s Right to Contracep-
tion Act, which would codify the right 
to access birth control into Federal 
law. I urge my colleagues in the Senate 
to pass this bill immediately so that 
people have the freedom to make their 
own decisions about their futures. 
We will not go back. Pass this bill. It 
is fundamental to democracy. 
b 1045 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield the balance of 
my time to the gentlewoman from 
Iowa (Mrs. HINSON), another dynamic 
leader from the freshman class of 2020. 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to present a reasonable solution 
to a challenge that millions of Amer-
ican women face: access to birth con-
trol. 
Seventy percent of women aged 18 to 
64 reported using oral contraceptives 
throughout their lifetime. A majority 
of women also support making birth 
control available over the counter 
without a prescription. That is why I 
will be offering a motion to recommit 
this bill in a few moments, to stand for 
those women. 
Women should be able to access their 
preferred birth control method conven-
iently. Unfortunately, that is not the 
reality for many women. In rural Iowa, 
some women have to drive an hour to 
be able to see a gynecologist. That 
means taking a day off of work, finding 
additional childcare, spending hours in 
a car, and paying expensive gas prices 
to get there. 
This is unreasonable when we have 
safe and effective birth control options 
that have been FDA-approved that still 
aren’t available over the counter. 
My amendment would require the 
FDA to give priority review for over- 
the-counter access to routine-use oral 
contraceptives that the agency has al-
ready deemed safe for women aged 18 
and up. 
I want to emphasize that this is for 
regular birth control pills, not emer-
gency contraceptives like Plan B. 
Making birth control available over 
the counter would have a significant 
impact on women’s lives. My col-
leagues across the aisle give you a 
whole lot of lip service about sup-
porting women. They claim that their 
policies, no matter how far outside of 
the mainstream, are the only way to 
support women. That is just not true. 
Madam Speaker, I am proposing a so-
lution today that the overwhelming 
majority of American women agree 
with, making their regular birth con-
trol pill available at their local phar-
macy. 
We have an opportunity here to work 
together to enact meaningful legisla-
tion that will benefit women. Instead, 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle have offered a bill that I simply 
cannot support. Their bill attacks con-
science protections for providers, ex-
pands access to abortion pills, and 
risks women’s health. 
But I am not willing to vote ‘‘no’’ 
and just give up on this, so that is why 
I am offering a solution that we should 
all be able to get behind. We should 
work together to make oral contracep-
tives more accessible. 
I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the motion to recommit today, adopt 
my amendment, and give women an 
over-the-counter option for birth con-
trol. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD prior to 
the vote on my motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Iowa? 
There was no objection. 
Mrs. 
RODGERS 
of 
Washington. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
I have heard many unfounded claims 
from the Republicans today, claims 
that this bill would prevent the FDA 
from acting to remove unsafe products 
or somehow direct funding for abor-
tion. 
This bill simply provides a right to 
contraception. Republicans are trying

to distract from their poor record on 
women’s health. The half-measures 
that Republicans are purporting to 
bring forward today do not establish a 
right to contraception, nor do they en-
sure that hostile State legislators can’t 
take away birth control in the future. 
Only the Right to Contraception Act 
ensures that. That is why I support 
this legislation, and I hope my col-
leagues will, as well. 
Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1232, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit at the 
desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6941 
July 21, 2022 
from the President of the United 
States; which was read and, together 
with the accompanying papers, referred 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs 
and ordered to be printed: 
To The Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to sig-
nificant transnational criminal organi-
zations that was declared in Executive 
Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, under which 
additional steps were taken in Execu-
tive Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, is to 
continue in effect beyond July 24, 2022. 
The 
activities 
of 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
have reached such scope and gravity 
that they threaten the stability of 
international political and economic 
systems. Such organizations are be-
coming increasingly sophisticated and 
dangerous to the United States; they 
are increasingly entrenched in the op-
erations of foreign governments and 
the international financial system, 
thereby weakening democratic institu-
tions, degrading the rule of law, and 
undermining economic markets. These 
organizations facilitate and aggravate 
violent civil conflicts and increasingly 
facilitate the activities of other dan-
gerous persons. 
Significant 
transnational criminal 
organizations continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency 
with 
respect 
to 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
declared in Executive Order 13581. 
JOSEPH R. BIDEN, Jr.
THE WHITE HOUSE, July 21, 2022. 
f 
NATO MEMBERSHIP 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to welcome the soon-to-be new-
est members of NATO: Finland and 
Sweden. 
Although the conflict in Ukraine has 
begun to fall out of the news cycle, the 
free world continues to be challenged 
by a violent autocrat with delusions of 
grandeur, 
making 
the 
strength 
of 
NATO all the more important. 
Every day, Vladimir Putin has dem-
onstrated his willingness to kill and 
maim countless innocent civilians and 
trample international norms in hopes 
of reclaiming the glory of a long-gone 
empire. 
By invading Ukraine, Putin expected 
to fracture the world’s response, divid-
ing the United States and our NATO 
allies. Instead, he has done just the op-
posite. 
Led by the United States, the inter-
national community has stood in lock-
step with the people of Ukraine. And 
now, we are expanding the roster of 
NATO countries, creating a stronger 
and more united membership than ever 
before. 
Finland and Sweden’s accession to 
NATO will bolster our collective secu-
rity and serve as a warning to Russia 
and to all other global aggressors: The 
United States and the international 
community are more united than ever 
before. We will never tolerate attempts 
to expand sovereign borders through 
force, not in Ukraine, not anywhere. 
f 
LANGUAGE IS THE LIFEBLOOD OF 
CULTURE 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota) 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, 175 native languages are spo-
ken in this country today, and they are 
threatened. Without preservation ef-
forts, by the year 2050 there will be 
fewer than 20 spoken. 
Now, for best fluency, you really 
should start language education by the 
age of 10. And luckily, that is what 
Pine Ridge’s, Thunder Valley CDC, and 
the rural grant initiative are doing. 
They are using dollars from the Esther 
Martinez Native Languages Program, 
which we have funded, to teach Lakota 
to the youngest students. It is incred-
ibly powerful. 
Mr. Speaker, language is the life-
blood of culture, and I am so proud 
that these two programs are working 
hard in South Dakota to preserve lan-
guage and culture. 
f 
INVESTMENTS IN PA–05 WORKERS 
AND BUSINESSES 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
proud to share the direct investments 
in Pennsylvania’s Fifth District for 
workers and businesses provided by 
this year’s National Defense Authoriza-
tion Act. 
We worked hard to secure its contin-
ued funding for the CH–47F Block II 
Chinook and V–22 Osprey programs, 
which provide good-paying local jobs to 
over 4,000 skilled men and women who 
build those aircraft in Ridley Park, 
Pennsylvania. 
In addition to supporting thousands 
of good-paying local jobs, the programs 
benefit dozens of small businesses and 
suppliers across Pennsylvania. 
I am also pleased that this year’s 
NDAA includes my bill to support Fed-
eral firefighters in PA–05 and across 
the country. Federal firefighters, like 
those at Philadelphia’s Navy Yard, 
have some of the toughest jobs in our 
communities, but budget cuts have 
forced them to operate without full 
crews, making their jobs more dan-
gerous. 
My bill requires the Department of 
Defense to adhere to national fire pro-
tection staffing standards at the Navy 
Yard and elsewhere. 
I am proud that this year’s defense 
bill recognizes the invaluable contribu-
tions of PA–05 workers and businesses 
to our national security, and I will con-
tinue to advocate for PA–05 priorities 
as the legislation makes its way to the 
President’s desk. 
f 
BIRTH CONTROL FOR ALL 
(Ms. BROWN of Ohio asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, 
imagine waking up one morning to a 
sharp, 
debilitating 
pain 
ripping 
through your lower abdomen that is so 
excruciating it brings you to your 
knees, then going to your doctor seek-
ing relief, only to be told that while 
the medicine exists, because of a new 
anti-contraception law, you will simply 
have to endure; endure the unbearable 
pain that is so all-consuming it limits 
your daily activities. 
By threatening access to contracep-
tion, this is the new reality extremists 
propose for tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans. 
Americans who rely on contracep-
tives to manage health challenges like 
menstrual cramps, hormone imbalance, 
and even acne, are now grappling with 
the fear of no access as the far right 
continues its war on 
reproductive 
healthcare. 
Today, I proudly voted for the Right 
to Contraception Act because all Amer-
icans should have the right to access 
and use birth control, regardless of the 
reason why. 
f 
ADVOCATING FOR LIEUTENANT 
RIDGE ALKONIS 
(Mr. LEVIN of California asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to express deep concern 
about the Japanese Government’s han-
dling of the case of Lieutenant Ridge 
Alkonis, a U.S. Navy officer stationed 
at Yokosuka Naval Base. 
In May 2021, Lieutenant Alkonis and 
his family were on their way home 
from hiking on Mount Fuji. Tragically, 
Lieutenant Alkonis lost control of his 
vehicle due to acute mountain sick-
ness, causing him to lose conscious-
ness. As a result, two bystanders trag-
ically lost their lives. 
Lieutenant Alkonis is remorseful for 
the medical incident that caused the

events of that day. He has offered $1.65 
million in extrajudicial restitution to 
the victims’ families, a gesture ex-
pected in Japan, but far beyond the 
family’s means. Ultimately, Lieuten-
ant Alkonis was sentenced this month 
by the Japanese high court to 3 years 
in prison. 
I have been extremely upset to learn 
that the case was not conducted in a 
way 
that 
was 
fair 
to 
Lieutenant 
Alkonis, and that the Japanese Gov-
ernment violated the status of forces 
agreement, which governs the treat-
ment of our servicemembers there. 
I understand that our Embassy in 
Tokyo has been monitoring this case, 
and I strongly urge them to do more to 
support a servicemember in need. 
My office has been working with the 
Department of the Navy and the Office 
of the Secretary of Defense to support 
Lieutenant Alkonis and his parents, 
Suzanne and Derek, throughout this 
case. 
As I do, the Navy believes that this is 
the wrong sentence for Lieutenant 
Alkonis. I won’t be giving up on Lieu-
tenant Alkonis and the Department of 
Defense must not either. 
f 
COMMEMORATING THE LIFE AND 
LEGACY OF MARY FRANCES CRISS 
(Mr. VEASEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life and 
legacy of my good friend and commu-
nity organizer, Mary Criss, of Fort 
Worth. Mary Criss was a mother, a 
wife, very organized in the community, 
and was blessed to have lived a wonder-
ful life. 
She was so into I.M. Terrell; loved 
the I.M. Terrell Association and being 
an alumnus and someone that was re-
vered within that high school alumni 
association. 
In addition to that, she also worked 
to organize her community and helped 
them get streetlights and stop signs 
put up in her Eastwood community and 
Stop Six; and was a longtime precinct 
chair and supporter of so many. 
But more importantly than that, 
Mary Criss loved God and was a devout 
member of Beth Eden Baptist Church. 
Mary was married for over five decades 
to her husband, Carl, and raised her 
son, granddaughters, and loved watch-
ing her grandson after school. 
She was a family woman and just 
loved her family intensely. She will be 
missed, not only by her family, but ev-
eryone in the community, the I.M. 
Terrell Alumni Association commu-
nity, and everyone that knew Mary 
Criss. 
f 
SUPPORTING ISABEL BUESO 
(Mr. DESAULNIER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to tell you about a remark-
able constituent, Isabel Bueso. Isabel 
came to the United States legally in 
2003 from Guatemala as a small child 
to receive treatment for her rare dis-
ease, known as MPS VI. 
She was invited here to participate in 
clinical trials to help research and 
identify lifesaving treatments for her 
rare condition. Thanks in large part to 
her participation, the FDA approved a 
treatment, which the drug manufac-
turer says Isabel cannot receive in her 
home country. 
Before her treatment was discovered, 
Isabel’s life expectancy was 7 years. 
Now, she is 26 years old, having sur-
vived far beyond that, and helped oth-
ers to survive because of her participa-
tion in this treatment trial. 
The previous administration unex-
pectedly canceled the program that 
Isabel and her family were under, and 
they were told that they had to leave 
in 33 days or risk being deported. 
Thanks to the American public and 
their outrage at this decision and oth-
ers like it, Isabel and her family were 
able to stay, and it was reinstated. 
We have a private bill that is now 
over in the Senate, and we hope the 
Senate will approve this so Isabel and 
her family can stay here in the United 
States safely.

INTERNATIONAL 
CHIEF 
SCIENCE 
OFFICER MENTOR OF THE YEAR 
MAUREEN L. MULVIHILL 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Maureen L. Mulvihill who was awarded 
the 2022 International Chief Science Of-
ficer Mentor of the Year Award. 
Maureen is the president and CEO of 
Actuated Medical in Bellefonte and has 
served her community as a leader and 
role model for over 15 years. She 
earned her master’s and Ph.D. in mate-
rials science from Penn State Univer-
sity before cofounding Actuated Med-
ical. 
While navigating the growth of her 
company, Maureen has continually

EDIES 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, 
over this past week, we have had to 
raise concerns about whether the Con-
stitution still stood strong. I am glad 
that we have worked hard to ensure the 
Ninth Amendment and the equal pro-
tection of the law are viable parts of 
American society and constitutional 
rights. 
I rise today to promote H.R. 40, the 
Commission to Study Slavery and De-
velop Reparation Proposals, as a way 
of redress, repair, and restoration for 
the 246 years of slavery. 
I think it is important and an impor-
tant moment for the country to pause 
and understand this historic moment 
in our history, the contributions that 
slaves made, including building this 
very place, the United States Capitol 
and the White House, and, as well, the 
economic engine that they created 
when making cotton king—never to be 
compensated, never to be provided for, 
but still turned into patriots that 
fought in every world war. 
It is crucial that we move expedi-
tiously to establish this commission to 
tell their story and to work on the res-
toration of the disparities that are 
found in the African-American commu-
nity from east to west and north to 
south. 
I cannot think of a reason why this 
House and this administration would 
not want to move on something as em-
bracing as H.R. 40. Let’s move it now.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), my friend, the majority leader 
of the House. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. SCALISE for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the House 
will meet at 12 p.m. for morning hour 
and 2 p.m. for legislative business with 
votes postponed, as usual, to 6:30 p.m. 
On Wednesday and Thursday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. I reiterate 
that because that’s 2 hours earlier than 
the usual meeting, but we have a lot of 
business to do. So the House on 
Wednesday and Thursday will meet at 
10 a.m. for legislative business. 
On Friday, the scheduled last day of 
the session before the August break, 
the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legis-
lative business. 
Next week, pending action of the 
Senate, hopefully, the House will con-
sider the CHIPS Plus legislation to

combat inflation by easing supply 
chain bottlenecks and semiconductors 
that are critical components in every-
thing from cars to dishwashers to 
small electronics. 
Essentially, all of that, so many 
things that we use, rely on having chip 
presence. That will help lower costs for 
Americans and increase supplies. 
This 
bill 
also 
will 
authorize 
a 
generational shift in research and inno-
vation in America, helping ensure the 
next big ideas will start here, and, im-
portantly, stay here. 
The House will also consider H.R. 
5118, 
the 
Wildfire 
Response 
and 
Drought Resiliency Act. All of us have 
seen the awful drought and wildfires 
that are occurring in the West and in 
other parts of the country, actually. 
A package of bills aimed at helping 
those living in Western States meet 
the challenges of fire and drought exac-
erbated by the climate crisis will be in 
that legislation. It would save lives, 
property, farms, and businesses from 
damage and destruction from fire and 
extreme drought. 
The House will also consider, Mr. 
Speaker, Representative KILDEE’s bill, 
the Susan Muffley Act, to restore re-
tirement benefits for over 20,000 hard-
working Delphi salaried employees. 
That is a bipartisan bill. 
We will also consider Representative 
QUIGLEY’s H.R. 263, the Big Cat Public 
Safety Act, which would ban the pri-
vate ownership of big cats and bring an 
end to the harmful cub petting indus-
try in an effort to enhance the safety 
of our communities. 
You may not think about this, but 
law enforcement has indicated this is a 
significant issue for them because they 
are the ones that are called in to han-
dle it. This is an effort to enhance the 
safety of our communities and protect 
first responders and safeguard these 
wild animals. 
The other reason it is on is because 
the Senate has asked, and I think there 
is a possibility that they will pass this 
through their unanimous consent proc-
ess. 
Representative JAYAPAL’s bill, H.R. 
3771, the South Asian Heart Health 
Awareness and Research Act, will also 
be on the floor to raise awareness re-
garding the alarming rate of heart dis-
ease in the South Asian community 
and invest in reversing this trend. 
Lastly, I would say that we are going 
to have Representative LIZ CHENEY’s 
H.R. 4040, the advancing telehealth be-
yond COVID–19 Act, which would fur-
ther extend critical telehealth policies 
implemented 
during 
the 
pandemic, 
while also making it easier for seniors, 
especially those in rural areas, to ac-
cess emergency healthcare technology. 
Additionally, Mr. Speaker, the House 
may consider public safety legislation, 
including legislation marked up yester-
day by the House Judiciary Committee 
with a focus, as well, on accountability 
in terms of enforcement. 
The House will consider bills under 
suspension of the rules, of course. The 
complete list of suspension bills will be 
announced by the close of business 
today. As always, additional legislative 
items are possible, particularly in this 
last week for us of our planned session 
prior to the August break. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the Republican 
whip for yielding the time. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, there are 
a few bills that we have been hearing 
might come that weren’t discussed, and 
I know the gentleman alluded to the 
CHIPS Act. I know the Senate still 
hasn’t finalized anything there. We are 
hearing they may. 
There are some other bills we have 
been hearing might come over. Of 
course, it seems like we keep hearing 
talk that something on Build Back 
Better may come back over on budget 
reconciliation, whether it is the tril-
lion plus, whether it is something dif-
ferent, whether we would come back in 
August to deal with that. 
I don’t know if the gentleman can 
touch on what he might be hearing 
from the Senate, and if there would be 
any plans beyond next week to come 
back in August where it is currently 
not scheduled to be a legislative period 
that we would be in session. I am not 
sure if the gentleman is willing to 
share that, but I will yield. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlemen for his question. 
Of course, we are hearing rumors all 
the time and press reports all the time 
about what may happen. I think most 
of us don’t know actually what will 
happen. But to speculate, we clearly on 
our side of the aisle, and, obviously, 
there is discussion that continues in 
the Senate about taking some parts of 
the reconciliation bill that can be 
agreed upon by sufficient numbers to 
pass it through reconciliation. 
If something does happen, and it 
doesn’t happen next week and it hap-
pens the following week when we will 
not be here, then we may well have to 
come back. 
I tell the gentleman the reason for 
that is it may well deal with the Af-
fordable Care Act and the premium 
subsidies that were included in the 
American Recovery Plan and then fur-
ther extended in the Build Back Better 
Act. 
The reason that is important is be-
cause the insurance companies will be 
setting prices in September and maybe 
as late as October. In order to price 
their product properly, they will need 
to know what we are going to do. 
Now, with respect to the gentle-
man’s—and everybody’s interested in 
this, of course. The gentleman asked 
the question, I think, that everybody 
wants to know: Are we going to come 
back in August? 
I don’t know the answer to that, but 
I will tell you this—and you and I have 
discussed this before—one of the rea-
sons we are leaving next week and the 
week thereafter is because we have a 
lot of people with young children. We 
see them on the floor all the time. 
Of course, schools now are going back 
earlier than they used to. When I was 
in school in the 1800s, schools went 
back after Labor Day. Now, as you 
know, we have schools going back as 
early as the middle of August. There-
fore, what we have tried to do is have 
2 weeks that Members will have to be 
with their families on vacation. 
So my expectation is if we have to 
come back that we will not come back 
during the first 2 weeks. That would be 
from my perspective, and I don’t want 
to guarantee that, but I feel pretty 
strongly about that. 
I am telling our Members that, and I 
want to respond publicly, but we may 
have to come back in August, again, 
because if the Senate passes language, 
if it has an impact on ACA, then we 
need to let the insurance companies 
know, not as a favor to them but as a 
favor to our constituents, so the pric-
ing of their product will be more af-
fordable. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman, and I appreciate espe-
cially the concern about that first 2 
weeks because as with my family and a 
lot of families, those first few weeks 
where the families are still together 
before everybody goes back to school, 
you know, a lot of plans are made. 
We have a lot of work to do. We also 
have families, and you don’t want to, 
you know, lose that element of having 
people be able to spend the time back 
in their districts and back with their 
families. If schedules have to change, 
at least give some lead time. I know 
Members on both sides appreciate that. 
Clearly, a lot of this depends on what 
the Senate does or doesn’t do. For 
those of us that would prefer the Sen-
ate work in a bipartisan way or espe-
cially work in a way that focused on 
addressing and being aware of the in-
flationary problems in the country, 
and, of course, we just saw last week, 
9.1 percent inflation, 40-year high, a lot 
of that driven by the spending in Wash-
ington. 
b 1215 
There is still talk that the Senate is 
trying to reach some agreement that 
would lead to a potential large amount 
of tax increases. A trillion dollars is a 
number 
that 
keeps 
being 
thrown 
around. It seems like trillions of dol-
lars keep getting thrown around to the 
point where inflation has gotten out of 
control from the spending. 
We all know how much families are 
paying for so many things: gas prices, 
when they go to the grocery stores, all 
the things that they buy, if they can 
afford to buy them, those things are 
dramatically higher. 
Hopefully, the Senate doesn’t keep 
adding to that inflation by coming up 
with more ways to spend money that 
we don’t have. We will see. 
There is also talk that as part of the 
ObamaCare subsidies—you know, that 
is an entirely different conversation— 
that bill still needs heavy subsidies 
that are not affordable, but they are 
talking about drug price controls that 
would be paired with that.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6944 
July 21, 2022 
Again, more a message to our friends 
on the other side of the Chamber in the 
Senate, just for situational awareness 
when countries do price controls, there 
is a cost in terms of lifesaving drugs 
that are not available in countries 
where they have done price controls. 
When you look at the United States, 
clearly a leader in innovation—we have 
seen it with Operation Warp Speed 
where we were able to get three dif-
ferent vaccines approved in less than a 
year because we encourage innovation 
in this country, we don’t penalize that 
innovation. 
But there are countries that do try to 
fix prices. While it might sound popu-
list to do it, the cost for those coun-
tries is that many lifesaving drugs are 
not available in those countries. We all 
hear about Canada. Canada clearly is a 
country that fixes prices. France is a 
country that fixes prices. You can see 
here, almost half of the drugs that are 
available in America that save lives 
are 
not 
available 
in 
Canada 
and 
France. 
I know there is a temptation, as they 
are negotiating over in the Senate, to 
get into the price-fixing business. I am 
not sure which lifesaving drugs the 
Senate would like to remove off the 
shelves of the United States, but there 
will be lifesaving drugs removed off the 
shelves. Let’s not do to drug manufac-
turing and lifesaving innovation in 
America what they have done to baby 
formula in America, where you can’t 
even find it on the shelves. You will 
not be able to find many lifesaving 
drugs on the shelves in America if they 
go to price fixing. 
I know it is a heated negotiation over 
there. They haven’t come to an agree-
ment. Hopefully, they won’t come to 
an agreement on something that would 
actually take lifesaving drugs off the 
shelves in this country. 
I would yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. We are all very concerned 
about inflation, and one of the things 
that I talked about in the Affordable 
Care Act, a significant cost for Ameri-
cans is their health insurance, and that 
bill is designed specifically to help 
them with the costs that they are in-
curring. 
But I would point out to the gen-
tleman: Gas prices, which are a signifi-
cant part of inflation, have come down 
36 days in a row, have come down over 
half a dollar in most areas of the coun-
try, and so we are making some 
progress, but not enough. 
We passed a bill, of course, through 
this House which talked about price 
gouging. I don’t know that anybody is 
for price gouging. Obviously, how to 
define price gouging is not simple, but 
having said that, I think certainly 
Americans want to make sure that 
they aren’t gouged because they have 
to have a product. 
We have also passed the act related 
to food and fuel to help with supply 
lines, to help with competition and 
help consumers bring their food prices 
down and gasoline prices by, for in-
stance, helping out in the Midwest 
with E–15 being available, which is a 
cheaper price. 
The gentleman is correct. We have 
and we are dealing with inflationary 
issues. In fact, hopefully, the CHIPS 
bill is going to pass the Senate. Hope-
fully, we are going to pass it here, and 
it will have other items involved in it, 
hopefully dealing with manufacturing. 
I have an agenda that I think the 
gentleman has heard me talk about 
probably ad nauseam, Make It In 
America. I believe we ought to make 
things in America, and in doing so, 
help bring prices down because we will 
have supply availability here. I don’t 
know if the gentleman has heard me 
use a phrase, we need to stop relying 
on the unreliable. I think the gen-
tleman has made some of those com-
ments himself. 
I also want to say that there is a lot 
of, in my opinion, political assertion of 
the fact that this administration has 
caused inflation, which I think is com-
pletely without any factual support. In 
fact, although clearly inflation is unac-
ceptably high at 9.1 percent in June, 
the OECD average of economically de-
veloped countries in the world is 9.6 
percent, so this is not something 
unique to America. 
It is a global inflation. It is not Biden 
policy inflation. It is global, largely 
caused by the pandemic, largely caused 
by the reduction in supply of goods and 
the reduction in demand for a period of 
time. And then with the American Res-
cue Plan we saw, not only in our coun-
try, but all over the world, there came 
a surge of demand, but because you had 
had the pandemic and you had sent 
workers home and they hadn’t come in 
to produce goods, the supply was down, 
the demand went up, and unfortu-
nately, inflation followed, which is 
very harmful to our people. 
As I say, the average OECD, however, 
is higher than we are. We are not an 
outlier. The G20 average is 8.8 percent, 
just about exactly what we are, and our 
closest peers—Germany, Canada, and 
the U.K.—are all around 8 percent in-
flation, so we are all in that place 
where inflation is causing our people a 
lot of pain, and we need to deal with it. 
The President has been trying to deal 
with it, and I think we have been try-
ing to deal with it. As I said, we passed 
a lot of legislation. I think the CHIPS 
bill is going to have a really big im-
pact. 
The car industry and related indus-
tries are one-third of inflation. 
Why is that? Because the chips short-
age has caused literally millions of 
cars to be sitting on docks or sitting in 
parking lots somewhere unable to be 
sold because we can’t get the chips. 
Used car prices have gone up because 
they are in greater demand. Again, 
when you have greater demand, prices 
go up. 
So I would say to my friend, you and 
I agree 100 percent that inflation needs 
to be dealt with. The Fed, obviously, is 
trying to do that as well because one 
way you deal with inflation is to in-
crease interest rates and try to slow 
down the economy. When you slow 
down the economy what you are trying 
to do is reduce demand to meet supply 
and stabilize prices. 
So I say to my friend, we have been 
doing a lot of things to try to deal with 
inflation. I mentioned a number of 
those bills that we passed. A number of 
them are still in the Senate. But let us 
hope that gasoline prices keep coming 
down. There are some who expect they 
may go back up. 
They are not set by us. They are set 
on the international market, and clear-
ly there is no doubt that the war has 
had an impact on those prices, a sig-
nificant impact on those prices. That is 
not the only reason because, as I said 
in our colloquy a couple weeks ago, the 
oil companies reduced production by 
800,000 barrels per day. 
Why? Because demand was down. 
Why? Not for a bad reason. The pan-
demic kept people in their homes, and 
they weren’t driving, so demand went 
down, so the normal reaction of the 
supplier was to reduce their supply. 
This President believes that inflation 
is one of the top problems confronting 
the American people and the adminis-
tration, and he is going to continue to 
work to try to bring that down. 
I am hoping the CHIPS bill comes 
over soon, the Senate gets that done. 
In whatever form it comes, I hope it is 
more robust than less robust. I think it 
will have a positive impact on bringing 
down inflation. 
Mr. SCALISE. I know there has been 
a lot of work by Members on both sides 
on the CHIPS Act. Mr. MCCAUL on our 
side, through the China Task Force, 
put out a number of recommendations. 
The CHIPS Act was one of them. Of 
course, one of the concerns we are see-
ing, as that bill continues to be nego-
tiated in the Senate, it is not being ne-
gotiated more narrowly, it is being 
loaded up to the point where we are 
hearing numbers of well over $100 bil-
lion in unpaid-for new spending as part 
of that bill. 
As we talk about inflation, any econ-
omist will tell you, inflation is too 
much money chasing too few goods, 
and if we already acknowledge there 
are too few goods, to put another $100- 
plus billion, maybe $150 billion—it 
keeps growing every day—of borrowed 
money, none of that—they are not 
prioritizing existing money. Every-
thing we are hearing is all of it would 
be completely borrowed money. 
Next week, we are hearing the Fed is 
going to raise interest rates maybe up 
to another point, and that is without 
$100-plus billion of additional debt 
being added on. If the Fed is telling us 
that the spending is leading to higher 
interest rates, which makes it harder 
for low-income families to buy their 
first home, for people to maybe expand 
their business where they can hire 
more people to go and meet the needs 
of the supply chain, they won’t be able

July 21, 2022 
to do that if interest rates keep going 
up. 
And yet, as interest rates are about 
to go up again next week, the Senate is 
trying to figure out how to keep adding 
and adding and adding on top of what 
is already probably well over $100 bil-
lion in borrowed money that they are 
going to send over here. 
I hope that we would keep that in 
mind as we are also trying to address 
these other problems like gas prices. I 
know we have talked about this many 
times. I shared it with the majority 
whip last week and would ask the ma-
jority leader again. We have identified 
a number of bills that have strong sup-
port that would address the many prob-
lems we are hearing that are leading to 
an inability to produce energy in 
America. 
We saw the President go hat in hand 
to Saudi Arabia last week. As I and 
many others predicted, we all knew 
that they were going to tell the Presi-
dent no, but I also suggested that if the 
President just saved the 11,000-plus 
miles on Air Force One and stayed here 
and called places like Port Fourchon, 
Louisiana, they would say yes to pro-
ducing more energy, not in Saudi Ara-
bia where their carbon emissions are 
much higher, but here in the United 
States where nobody in the world does 
it better, does it cleaner, or more effi-
ciently. 
That would create more jobs in our 
country, and it would give more energy 
security to our country. It would allow 
us to lower gas prices, not just for us 
but for our allies around the world. 
And yet, instead of working with us on 
these bills, the President chooses to go 
to foreign countries who have no inter-
est in lowering gas prices, and so we 
still end up in this situation. 
I don’t know if there is an oppor-
tunity to get any or all of these bills 
brought up where we could actually 
come to an agreement on some things 
that would move the needle and help 
families in America lower gas prices. 
Today, we are still over double what 
the price of gasoline was before Presi-
dent Biden took office. 
Wherever the price moves, up or 
down, when families are paying over 
$150 to fill up their car, it is taking a 
huge hit out of low- and middle-income 
families’ budgets, and that is one of the 
driving factors behind the sluggish 
economy. 
I don’t know if the gentleman wants 
to make an announcement of some of 
these bills coming to the floor. I would 
welcome that, and I would yield. 
Mr. HOYER. And it would surprise 
him. 
Mr. Speaker, we have had this discus-
sion for over a month now about these 
bills, but also every time we have it, 
there is the plea that we produce, and 
if we would only produce. I bring this 
statistic up. 
As the gentleman knows, as a result 
of our going back and forth, my staff 
has prepared a paper—and they have 
done an excellent job—as to what actu-
ally is the fact. Fact one, U.S. rig 
count—that is what drills for oil—is at 
current levels of 733. That is up 272 
from 1 year ago. That is a 59 percent 
increase from a year ago, so that there 
is no doubt that we are producing 
more. 
b 1230 
Now, as a practical matter, those of 
us who believe in the private sector 
and the capitalist system understand 
that the reason production goes up is 
because demand goes up and, therefore, 
companies want to sell more. But there 
are also companies that have not cho-
sen to produce more for reasons of 
their own business judgment as to 
whether they think producing more 
will cause them to have better profits 
or lower profits or stay even. 
This 
administration 
has 
presided 
over greater production in their first 
year than was true in the first 3 years 
individually—2017, 2018, and 2019, each 
one of those 3 years—under the Trump 
administration. 
We are producing oil, and we are pro-
ducing product. We are going to con-
tinue to do that. I can give you sta-
tistic after statistic of how many appli-
cations have been approved, are ready 
to go, and are not being used. 
Rather than just rehash that, I will 
simply say, back to the issue of the gas 
prices, gas prices are lower today in 
real terms than they were at the end of 
the Bush administration in 2008. I 
pause for emphasis. In real dollars, the 
cost of gasoline at the pump at the end 
of 2008 was higher than it is today, and 
it is way too high today. 
I was out in Virginia, in a rural area, 
and I saw gas for $4.36. At home, it had 
been almost $4.95, and that was an ex-
traordinary decrease. I said: Boy, look 
at that. Then I caught myself because 
it is still a burden on our consumers, 
middle-class, working families, when, 
as the whip says, they confront a price 
of two or three times what they were 
used to when filling up their car. So, 
we need to continue to work on that. 
I disagree with the whip in the sense, 
Mr. Speaker, that I think the Presi-
dent’s visit overseas—there was some 
controversy to it. I get that. I think it 
was very positive vis-a-vis our close 
ally Israel, and Israel said it was a very 
productive visit. I am glad the Presi-
dent did that. I also think that it gave 
additional stability indicating that 
this President, although we are focused 
like a laser on Ukraine and focused 
like a laser on the Far East, we are 
still focused on the Middle East and 
trying to make that region of the 
world a stable region of the world. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. This debate will con-
tinue. It would be great if we were de-
bating these bills next week. I stand to 
be surprised and happily surprised if 
the announcement comes out over the 
weekend that some or all of these bills 
will be brought to the floor. 
I would give the gentleman a pre-
diction that if the House were to take 
up and pass these bills, we would see a 
dramatic reduction in the price of gas-
oline. I will leave that out there for the 
gentleman to consider as one more rea-
son why these would be good debates to 
have, where we could talk together in 
support of good policy. 
We are both blessed with good staff 
that help us identify really good pieces 
of legislation that we could bring to 
address these big, big problems that 
families are facing. 
Mr. Speaker, unless the gentleman 
has anything else, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES
of New York). Under the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is al-
ways an honor and a privilege to have 
a chance to address the House. There is 
so much that is so critically important 
going on these days, especially this 
week, and I wanted the chance to ad-
dress those. 
I have a friend from Texas who hopes 
to address the House, and I advised him 
I would yield him such time as he may 
consume. So my friend—people say 
that a lot, ‘‘my friend.’’ But RANDY 
WEBER is a dear friend, and I think he 
will be out at any moment. 
In the meantime, I think we had an 
11- to 12-hour hearing yesterday in the 
Committee on the Judiciary, and I will 
get into that momentarily. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. WEBER), my dear 
friend from southeast Texas. 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Judge GOHMERT for yielding, my 
friend from northeast Texas. We are 
going to miss him. He has had quite a 
distinguished career both before he got 
into Congress and then when he got de-
moted to Congress. We appreciate him. 
I just can’t tell you how much we real-
ly appreciate him. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 
the life of country music legend Mick-
ey Gilley. Mickey Gilley passed away 
Saturday, May 7, in Branson at the age 
of 86. 
Born on March 9, 1936, Gilley was a 
native of Natchez, Mississippi, where 
he grew up around his two famous 
cousins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Jimmy 
Swaggart. 
In his career, Gilley earned 39 top 10 
hits and 17 number one songs. 
With six Academy of Country Music 
Awards and a star on the Hollywood 
Walk of Fame, and as a member of the 
2011 Texas Country Music Hall of 
Fame, Gilley was also one of only a few 
artists who have also received the 
Academy of Country Music’s Triple 
Crown Award. 
But it was the opening of the country 
dance club bearing his name that 
changed the world of country music 
forever. It was 1971 when Mickey offi-
cially opened the doors of his famous 
honkytonk.

Gilley’s reputation grew so much 
that Hollywood even took notice of the 
hit movie ‘‘Urban Cowboy,’’ where he 
even made an appearance alongside 
none other than John Travolta, Debra 
Winger, and Johnny Lee. 
Inspired by the real-life romance of a 
pair of the club’s patrons, ‘‘Urban Cow-
boy’’ put Gilley’s on the map, revived 
music careers, launched others, intro-
duced two-stepping to a whole new au-
dience, and created a lifestyle that has 
been adopted by millions. 
Following his role in ‘‘Urban Cow-
boy,’’ Gilley found himself performing 
in main showrooms in places like Las 
Vegas, Reno, Tahoe, and Atlantic City, 
and even traveling to Europe to per-
form. Gilley even performed for Presi-
dents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. 
Bush. 
Over the decades, Gilley appeared in 
a number of popular television series, 
including ‘‘The Fall Guy,’’ ‘‘Fantasy 
Island,’’ 
‘‘The 
Dukes 
of 
Hazzard,’’ 
‘‘Murder, She Wrote,’’ and ‘‘CHiPs.’’ 
Not only will Mickey Gilley’s music 
live on in the hearts of so many who 
loved his music, but his cultural influ-
ence cannot be overstated. 
‘‘Urban Cowboy’’ became an Amer-
ican phenomenon, and it was influ-
enced by the real-life stories of Gilley’s 
patrons, Dew Westbrook and Betty 
Helmer. 
‘‘Urban Cowboy’’ told the story of a 
west Texas farmhand who was new to 
the area and working his first job at a 
refinery. This film introduced country 
dance to America and created a life-
style that has been adopted by mil-
lions. 
Even more surprisingly, it directly 
resulted in the most unlikely outcome 
of all: Country-and-western music be-
came mainstream. Once considered 
outdated hillbilly attire, cowboy hats 
and belt buckles became high fashion. 
On Saturday, January 29, Mickey 
came to the Galveston Regional Cham-
ber of Commerce’s celebration, ‘‘The 
50th Anniversary of Gilley’s and the 
42nd Anniversary of ‘Urban Cowboy.’’’ 
It was a great celebration with thou-
sands, and Mickey actually sang for us, 
to the delight of the crowd. We even 
presented him with a copy of the trib-
ute that I had done to him right here 
on the floor of the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives and a plaque commemo-
rating that event. 
Mickey Gilley will be missed, but his 
legacy will live on not only in the 
hearts and minds of those who loved 
his music but also in America’s love of 
country-and-western music, Wrangler 
jeans, cowboy boots, and, yes, pickup 
trucks. He has even been featured in 
the very popular Texas Hot Country 
Magazine. I know the publisher well, 
Leon Beck, a great guy. 
Gilley was preceded in his death by 
his wife Vivian, who passed in 2019. He 
is survived by his wife now, Cindy Loeb 
Gilley; his children, Kathy, Michael, 
Gregory, and Keith Ray; his four 
grandchildren and nine great-grand-
children; and his cousins, Jerry Lee 
Lewis and, I believe, Jimmy Swaggart, 
although someone told me recently he 
might have passed already. My deepest 
sympathies go out to his family. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank Mickey Gilley 
for introducing our way of life to the 
world. He will forever be a legend. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate my friend bringing that to our at-
tention. That was a great tribute to a 
great man from a great man. 
I did attend and help things out at 
Gilley’s on a number of occasions there 
in Pasadena—Pasadena, Texas, that 
is—not far from downtown Houston. 
I don’t know. I guess I had the look 
that I could ride a bull because they 
turned it up as high as it could go 
wheeling, and it was something. I got 
better at it, but that was tough when 
they put that thing on full speed, 
yanking back and forth. I just knew I 
wasn’t going to ride a bull in the rodeo. 
Rather prophetic, too, was Mickey 
Gilley with one of his biggest hit songs, 
‘‘Don’t the Girls All Get Prettier at 
Closing Time.’’ Quite an astute obser-
vation. But we were young then. 
It was interesting, hearing the col-
loquy exchange between Representa-
tive SCALISE and Leader HOYER, the 
discussion about inflation. 
I remember vividly the years under 
President Gerald Ford, and he adopted 
WIN and had WIN buttons, which stood 
for ‘‘Whip Inflation Now.’’ The failure 
of the policies at that point to whip in-
flation, along with Watergate, helped 
elect President Jimmy Carter, and 
things just got worse and worse. We 
lost our international standing. Coun-
tries did not respect us. 
Beginning in 1978, I was stationed at 
Fort Benning, Georgia. As I have said 
before, we weren’t in combat during 
my 4 years on Active Duty, but I still 
have deep regrets that President Carter 
did not respond more appropriately 
when an act of war occurred in Iran, in 
Tehran, when our Embassy was at-
tacked and over 50 employees taken 
prisoner. 
We were put on alert. That went up 
at Fort Benning, and people weren’t 
sure who all was going to be going if a 
group was sent. 
b 1245 
But I still believe, having lived 
through those days, watching every de-
velopment, that if President Carter had 
made clear to the Iranians, you will ei-
ther release—initially, I think they 
started out around three days. The 
spokesman for the Ayatollah kept say-
ing the students attacked the embassy, 
the students took the hostages. 
I mean, I was young, but I wasn’t stu-
pid. And it appeared pretty clear to me 
that the spokesman for the Ayatollah 
was giving himself a back door: The 
students did this. That way, if Presi-
dent Carter reacted, as he should have, 
and said you will either release those 
hostages, get them released from the 
students, play around with the ridicu-
lous thing that we are saying, if you 
don’t get those released within 48 to 72 
hours, something like that, then we are 
sending as many people as it takes to 
get our people back, and to stop the ac-
tive war you started. 
But if it is the students, you can just 
take care of that quite easily. But, 
again, if you don’t release them, see 
that they are released, we are coming. 
And if you harm one hair on their 
heads, then we are going to take every-
one associated with the Ayatollah Kho-
meini, including the Ayatollah Kho-
meini, out. They will not exist after we 
come. 
I really felt if President Carter had 
taken that strong position, they would 
have been released. He couldn’t bluff; 
he had to be serious about it. But if he 
had said he wasn’t bluffing, then I real-
ly felt like they would have been re-
leased. And nobody was dying to go to 
Iran at Fort Benning, but everybody I 
knew was willing to go and give up 
their lives, if necessary. That was part 
of being in the service. 
But that never happened. And it took 
getting 
a 
new 
President, 
Ronald 
Reagan, in office, before people around 
the world began to take the United 
States seriously. But some in this body 
have talked before about, Oh, no, we 
don’t want to give the radical Islamists 
something to recruit with. 
Well, one of the best things they ever 
had to recruit with was President Car-
ter and his unwillingness to take a 
stand and make a difference. And as a 
result, it is my belief that—having 
studied history my whole life, majored 
in it in college, never stopped studying 
it—that we lost thousands of American 
lives because we didn’t have a Presi-
dent in President Carter that engen-
dered respect. And respect carries a lit-
tle element of fear. We didn’t have 
that. And as a result, for decades, 
Americans have suffered. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER), my 
friend. 
DEMOCRATS’ LEFTWING AGENDA 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
In just one week, House Democrats 
have managed to bypass the wishes of 
the American people and pass radical 
legislation 
that 
permits 
abortion 
through the ninth month, assures pay-
outs to Planned Parenthood, attacks 
the traditional family, and eliminates 
medical supervision for chemical abor-
tion pills. 
The 
American 
people 
who 
over-
whelmingly oppose abortion through 
the third trimester are appalled by the 
radical leftwing agenda put forth by 
the Speaker. House Democrats are 
pushing an extreme leftwing agenda. 
They are trying to distract from the 
surging gas prices, record inflation, 
and the crisis at the border, which they 
created. 
It took less than 2 years for woke 
leftists to destroy the American econ-
omy, which was booming under Presi-
dent Trump’s leadership. These same 
leftists have also openly advocated for 
open borders, transgender surgeries on

teens, 
and 
removing 
the 
Second 
Amendment rights of our citizens. 
All of these initiatives are deeply un-
popular with the American people, and 
I will also vote ‘‘no’’ on the radical 
agenda of the left. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, when 
MARY MILLER tells you something, you 
can count on her being truthful about 
it. 
Mr. Speaker, yesterday, we had many 
hours of hearings in the Judiciary 
Committee on a couple of bills. One of 
them, the Democrat majority and lead-
ers in the Judiciary Committee and the 
Democratic Party were saying repeat-
edly that no one has gotten immunity 
from liability like the gun manufactur-
ers. And that was said many ways, 
many different times, vilifying gun 
manufacturers. 
What it boils down to is in the Sec-
ond Amendment, it makes very clear, 
in operative part, that the right of the 
people to keep and bear arms shall not 
be infringed. Well, it has been infringed 
many times. The Supreme Court has 
had to strike things down many times. 
So the effort to eliminate the Second 
Amendment through the courts has not 
occurred. 
You can be smart and not have com-
monsense, but we are dealing with 
some smart people here who have fig-
ured out, Okay, we have tried every 
which way to get rid of the Second 
Amendment. If we are ever going to get 
to the progressive, socialist, com-
munist dream—whichever one of those 
you want to use, it is all pretty well 
the same thing these days—you are 
going to have to get rid of the Second 
Amendment. 
The left knows that. And they have 
made some strides. They have made 
some dents into the Second Amend-
ment. But this is going to make use— 
if they get it passed into law—not of 
warfare but of what has come to be 
known as ‘‘law fare.’’ It is where you 
overwhelm someone or some entity 
with so many lawsuits that they can-
not continue. And if it is an entity, you 
put them out of business, not because 
they are liable, but it is because they 
can’t handle that many lawsuits. It 
just undoes them and puts them out of 
business. 
And if you look historically where 
that would take us is to the medieval- 
type thinking where you had this small 
group of elites. They rode everywhere 
they went, and us peasants would walk 
everywhere we went. Maybe there was 
a big wagon that would carry the peas-
ants at times. But the ruling elite— 
which is what you get with socialism, 
progressivism—this tiny veneer of rul-
ing elite that billionaires in America 
think, mistakenly, that they will be 
part of if they help get to that socialist 
utopia, being ignorant of the fact that 
every time a Nation moves to socialist 
utopia, once they are there, they thank 
the gazillionaires for all the money. 
They helped make the socialist dream 
come true. And then they either kill 
them or send them to a gulag and take 
all of their money. 
So these billionaires that are pouring 
in money, the socialist leaders are say-
ing, Thank you very much; oh, we ap-
preciate you so much. But if they get 
to that socialist utopia, those billion-
aires that made it possible will be dead, 
or wished they were, because they were 
in some prison, some gulag somewhere, 
doing work requirements. So that is 
historically what we are talking about. 
But I keep coming back to that vi-
sion of what is being pursued and what 
will the outcome be. Once you either 
eliminate the Second Amendment or 
you eliminate every entity that makes 
guns, then the ruling elite can get clos-
er to their dreams of being the ones 
riding in private jets, in Suburbans, up- 
armored; being the only ones in Amer-
ica who have guns for their security 
forces while all the peasants, the 
masses, the unwashed—all of us—would 
have nothing. And we would have to 
kowtow and bow. 
Now, I got a little taste of that the 
summer I was in the Soviet Union as 
an exchange student back in the 1970s. 
And I thought it was crazy. We were 
told there were eight Americans al-
lowed in on this program. We were told 
in orientation, Look, you have got to 
understand in a communist society 
like the Soviet Union, only the elite 
have cars. Everybody else takes mass 
transportation or walks. 
In the United States, pedestrians 
generally have the right-of-way. But 
don’t think for a second we were told 
anywhere in the Soviet Union that you 
have the right-of-way of a pedestrian, 
because only the ruling elite have the 
cars. And it is a game to them. They 
will try to hit you because they know, 
as the ruling elite, if it ever came to 
court or there was some question about 
you as a pedestrian being hit, the ulti-
mate result would be a ruling that you 
should have seen the car coming and 
gotten out of the way. Because these 
are the ruling elites and you are the 
peasants. Great socialist utopia. That 
is where we are headed if these kinds of 
bills get passed. 
If you can’t get rid of the Second 
Amendment, their strategy that we 
lived through hours of yesterday, bank-
rupt the gun manufacturers. And then 
we will be on our way. And that way, 
only the ruling elite will have security 
forces with guns and everybody else 
will either walk or take mass transpor-
tation. The ruling elite gets the private 
jets. 
And it is okay to just have massive 
amounts of carbon emissions and pri-
vate 
helicopters, 
private 
jets, 
big 
Suburbans, like Al Gore used. I read 
where he was seen having an entourage 
of big jets—this was long after he was 
out of leadership as Vice President— 
but they would all be sitting there, 
cooling for the Vice President—or 
former Vice President. So that is the 
kind of thing that will continue. 
The ruling elite, they get to pollute 
like crazy. Their yachts, their private 
jets, those will continue. In fact, there 
will be a lot more of them. And you see 
people like the Biden family—Hunter 
Biden that got close to oligarchs in 
Russia, in Ukraine—and made money 
off the Chinese Communist Party be-
cause they were in charge in China, 
let’s face it. 
But isn’t it interesting that if you 
look at the policies and the things that 
this administration has done, who has 
benefited? 
Yeah, they talk a lot of trash about 
Russia but at the same time, by Presi-
dent Biden basically going to war with 
energy companies in the U.S., he has so 
driven up the price of oil and natural 
gas that Russia’s been able to fund 
their 
invasion 
of, 
and 
war 
with, 
Ukraine. 
b 1300 
We got $13 billion passed in this 
House. Another $40 billion. I voted for 
13; I didn’t vote for the 40 because it 
didn’t appear to me there was enough 
restraint on what President Biden 
could do with the money. 
It made big headlines in the last few 
weeks when the Biden administration 
announced: Gee, we are going to pro-
vide $820 million to Ukraine. Well, you 
have $53 billion to work with and you 
are trickling out $820 million while 
Russia is making big advances in 
Ukraine? For heaven’s sake, that is one 
of the reasons I didn’t vote for the $40 
billion because I figured that the Biden 
administration would find other things 
to do with it. 
Apparently, they want to have a lot 
more sex change surgeries in the mili-
tary. They cost a lot of money—it 
doesn’t cost $40 billion if you had a sex 
change for everybody in the military. 
By the way, that does put our military 
members in a category where they are 
not able to be utilized for military 
services. Last I saw, they stayed in 
that category where you couldn’t de-
ploy them until such time as a psychia-
trist could certify that they were com-
fortable in their new gender. Amazing. 
No wonder we are losing respect around 
the world when we are not spending de-
fense money on defense, we are spend-
ing it on social experimentation. 
We see these bills coming. We see 
what is happening. All you have to do 
is look from a historical perspective. 
The discussion about gasoline is actu-
ally cheaper now than it was at the end 
of the Bush administration. My gosh, 
we just went through TARP being 
passed, $700 billion—well, yeah, that is 
going to cause some inflation. 
Along came the Obama administra-
tion—the 
Obama-Biden 
administra-
tion—and they got another $900 billion 
on top of having a majority of the $700 
billion still to spend. They were throw-
ing money at things right and left that 
would help them get reelected. So I 
wouldn’t be bragging about a whole lot. 
In fact, I have seen an article indi-
cating that during the 8 years of the 
Obama-Biden administration, the aver-
age Black household in America during 
the Obama-Biden 8 years, the average 
Black household lost 30 percent of their

net worth, which really helped bring a 
great deal of light and emphasis on 
candidate Donald Trump’s question to 
a large Black audience: 
What do you got to lose by voting for 
me? 
What do you got to lose? 
You just lost 30 percent of your net 
worth under the Democrats. Lo and be-
hold, the average gained net worth 
under the 4 years of President Trump. 
So people, I think, are starting to 
look at those kind of numbers again, 
and I think it is important to do so. 
Back to our hearing yesterday. They 
kept saying that gun manufacturers 
were given immunity like nobody else 
in America. It was my honor to get to 
illuminate that issue for those that 
hadn’t thought through what they were 
saying and didn’t realize that it was 
not true. 
First of all, a very timely topic that 
many of us think has long outlived its 
usefulness is the massive immunity 
that has been given to the pharma-
ceutical industry for the vaccinations 
that they have made tens of billions of 
dollars just in a year—they have made 
so much money off those. 
So 
much 
so 
that 
they 
looked 
around—most people have gotten the 
vaccination. I hate to see somebody 
have natural immunity from having 
COVID because they are not as vulner-
able to getting COVID again as appar-
ently people are that have had the vac-
cinations and all the boosters. 
So what do you do? 
Oh, let’s go after the young people 
under 5 years of age. These are people 
that statistically, you would say, don’t 
even have a statistical chance of get-
ting COVID and passing away. They 
were the least vulnerable among us 
when it comes to COVID—and that is 
who they want to give a jab to and 
boosters—even though we are seeing 
more and more indications that immu-
nity ends up being compromised in 
many people who get the boosters. It 
doesn’t seem to help with immunity to 
new strains of COVID. 
The 
Democrats 
were 
more 
than 
thrilled, it seems, to give them all 
kinds of immunity. When I saw the 
huge, unfolded warnings that come 
with the vaccination, I said to the 
pharmacist: Where are all the warn-
ings? 
They know about a lot of things that 
go wrong with these. We know about it 
from the VAERS reports of so many 
things that have gone wrong, starting 
with blood clots and going from there. 
He said: No. It says up there because 
it is emergency use authorization, not 
only do they have complete immunity 
to any lawsuit for damages or deaths 
they cause, they don’t even have to 
warn you of all the damages that they 
know can result from the vaccinations 
or the boosters. They don’t even have 
to warn you. 
My friends in the Judiciary Com-
mittee yesterday—because they kept 
saying, you know, nobody else gets this 
kind of immunity, they just weren’t 
aware—I know the rules, we are here in 
the House of Representatives, you 
can’t intentionally lie to anybody. 
That is why I am sure they just forgot 
or weren’t aware of all the immunities 
that they provided to other entities— 
the pharmaceutical. 
They don’t even have to warn you or 
give you a heads-up of what is coming 
potentially with the vaccination or 
booster. Then you got social media. 
Section 230 has allowed some of the 
richest companies in the world and in-
dividuals in the world to completely 
escape liability. They should be made 
to answer in court for fraud and for so 
many of the things that they have 
done—for censorship, for taking away 
people’s rights that they were told 
they had under the social media. 
Anyway, even though I know that my 
Democrat friends were not talking 
about section 230 immunity—there it 
is. Of course, they don’t want to bother 
that because that allows all the Demo-
crats controlling these massive social 
media giants to censor and help at 
election time and help Democrats get 
elected. 
They want to leave that immunity in 
place when it needs to go. We need to 
just eliminate section 230. We were 
told, well, that was important to have 
to allow them to get started. Listen, 
they are started, and they are some of 
the most powerful companies in the 
history of the world—some would say 
more powerful than the U.S. Govern-
ment itself because of all the informa-
tion they have. It is time to get rid of 
their immunity from liability. Even 
fraud—you can’t even sue them for 
fraud. 
Diamond and Silk, they were telling 
me how they had paid in order to have 
their name come up more often. Not 
only did it not come up more often, an 
algorithm was used to send it to the 
bottom. That is called fraud. They 
took money from them under fraudu-
lent circumstances. They can’t even 
sue over that. 
I am for getting rid of that immu-
nity. I know that people knew, so they 
must have just forgotten. Members of 
Congress have immunity from being 
sued. You can come down here, you can 
accuse President Trump of all kinds of 
crimes—colluding with Russia, when it 
turned out that was not Trump, that 
was the Hillary Clinton campaign that 
was doing the colluding with Russia. 
You can accuse him of all kinds of 
crimes. You can call Trump guilty of 
all kinds of thing, and you can’t be 
sued for it—for things you say and do 
here in the House. We have got that 
immunity. 
Heck, 
President 
Biden 
and 
Vice 
President KAMALA HARRIS got the same 
kind of immunity. Even though we 
have lost more than 100,000 Americans 
in 1 year from fentanyl and drugs that 
have come across our southern border 
illegally, if they didn’t have the immu-
nity that my Democrat friends in the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
said 
doesn’t 
exist, then they could be sued for their 
negligence or intentional failures. 
They both took an oath to uphold the 
Constitution. So allowing a completely 
porous border—that is not upholding 
their oath. Over 100,000 people have 
died just from the illegal drugs that 
have been allowed in by this adminis-
tration. 
If not for the immunity, President 
Biden could be vulnerable to lawsuit. 
Even with all the money that Hunter 
has helped bring in, it wouldn’t be 
enough to pay all the judgments if it 
weren’t 
for 
the 
immunity. 
Maybe 
somebody might—if they were not im-
mune—somebody might try to allege 
that it was negligence and purely stu-
pid to put someone in charge as border 
czar who would never go to the border 
to even investigate and see at the bor-
der what was going on. That would 
make her vulnerable to liability as 
well, except for the immunity. 
Those are rather important ideas to 
remember. Republicans didn’t give gun 
manufacturers some kind of exclusive 
immunity. They are liable. If they are 
negligent—they even have strict liabil-
ity. If there is a defect in manufac-
turing or design, they are liable. In one 
case, they paid out millions of dollars 
because they had advertised and tar-
geted 
a 
specific 
audience 
they 
shouldn’t have. 
b 1315 
They clearly have liability. That was 
just a lot of information that was not 
accurate that was being tossed out yes-
terday as a reason to get rid of all guns 
except, of course, mark my words, if 
they were ever successful in doing that, 
that little veneer of ruling elite, their 
security would have the guns, and we 
the peasants would have no guns and 
no way to defend ourselves. 
Of course, we are seeing the abuses of 
law enforcement. We have had hearings 
on that before, massive abuse by law 
enforcement. With the bill yesterday, 
they were providing an exemption from 
getting rid of guns to bureaucrats in 
the Department of Agriculture and in 
the Department of Education. Bureau-
crats, these weren’t even the police 
force, were going to be exempt from 
the new laws the Democrats in the Ju-
diciary 
Committee 
wanted 
to 
get 
passed. 
We said: Wait, it is probably just an 
oversight because you have given an 
exemption for law enforcement, but 
you have no exemption for military or 
veterans. 
The chairman of the committee—a 
Democrat 
chairman—said 
basically 
that, well, you have to keep in mind 
that they get PTSD, and they have all 
kinds of problems. We don’t want to 
give that kind of exemption to carry 
guns to people who have been trained 
with them and who serve or have 
served in the military. 
This is just a real slap in the face to 
people who put their lives on the line 
defending our country. 
Do you want to dismiss them? Well, 
they have PTSD. They have all kinds 
of problems.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6949 
July 21, 2022 
It is a shame that those people who 
are the reason that we are allowed to 
be here and talk, they put their lives 
on the line for us and our freedoms, 
and then they just get dismissed. 
Bureaucrats in the Department of 
Education, who may not have ever 
been trained with weapons, are more 
important to give exemptions to than 
these current military or veterans. 
That is a mentality that is hard to un-
derstand. 
We look at Indiana, at the shooting 
in the shopping mall. It is incredible 
that a person with the right to carry, 
within 15 seconds, the guy coming out 
into the mall with an automatic weap-
on, and this guy, as I understand, at 40 
yards and with a handgun—I mean, I 
had to qualify every year with a hand-
gun and with an M–16—at 40 yards put 
8 out of 10 rounds in the shooter. That 
is incredible. But it sure did end the 
horror at the mall. 
If other shooters find out that they 
could have 8 out of 10 rounds put into 
them if they walk out and try to do 
that at malls, it would help stop a lot 
of people from being tempted to do 
something that criminally evil in other 
shopping malls. It is just incredible. 
We had this issue come up. I have 
page after page, over 50 pages, of recent 
history where people with right to 
carry have stepped up and saved so 
many lives because they were a law- 
abiding person, a selfless, law-abiding 
person willing to put their life at risk 
to save others. There is case after case, 
more than 50 in these documents. 
It 
starts 
with 
information 
from 
criminal research, July 11, 2022, and it 
goes on and on. Like I say, I know 
there are more than 50 pages. These are 
heroes stepping up and putting their 
lives at risk knowing at Uvalde they 
had hundreds of law enforcement there. 
I still don’t understand that. They 
could hear the guy shooting children. 
You had a police chief while he is 
shooting children just asking him 
sweetly to put the gun down. The door 
wasn’t locked. They could have gone in 
and taken him out at any moment. 
I know hundreds of law enforcement 
as a former judge and former assistant 
district attorney, and I don’t know any 
who would have stood by while chil-
dren were being killed. It turns out 
there were people in Uvalde who were 
stopped—some law enforcement—who 
couldn’t go in and do anything. 
If a concealed carry, somebody with a 
constitutional carry, had been allowed 
to risk their life and go in, they would 
have. But people were being stopped 
and kept from going in. I recall an inci-
dent at our courthouse in Tyler and 
seeing the film when shots started 
being fired and the law enforcement 
starts running to the sound of the 
guns. 
I had one incident at the courthouse. 
As is often the case, it was a domestic 
situation, and a shooter started shoot-
ing. We had a concealed carry permit 
holder who took his gun. The active 
shooter would have killed a lot more 
people, but the concealed carry permit 
holder started shooting at him. He got 
shot and died from his wounds. The guy 
had to take off. There is no telling how 
many lives were saved by that sacrifi-
cial person being willing to put himself 
out there in harm’s way, become a tar-
get himself, and stop the shooter. 
Law-abiding people have made a dif-
ference that way. 
We had a lady who took her gun out 
years ago and went into a cafeteria to 
eat in central Texas. A gunman ended 
up shooting her parents, among others. 
If she had been allowed to have her 
gun, she would have stopped him. 
Then, she led the charge in the State 
legislature to get concealed carry per-
mits, and that was the basis of the 
start there. 
Mr. Speaker, you have to have people 
who have been taught that there are 
some absolute rights and some abso-
lute wrongs. C.S. Lewis became a 
Christian from being, he would say, ag-
nostic—seemed like sometimes atheist. 
But he liked to cajole Christians: Yes, 
yes, isn’t easier just to admit there 
can’t be a just God with so much injus-
tice? 
It finally dawned on him, the bril-
liant Oxford professor that he was, how 
could he say that there was injustice if 
there were not some absolute, uni-
versal standard somewhere of right and 
wrong? If that existed, then there must 
be something like a God who put that 
in place. 
The more he wrestled with that, the 
more he came to understand that we 
all have innate in us this feeling of 
fairness and of justice. As he pointed 
out, it would be like someone born 
blind at birth trying to describe sight. 
How would you know that there is 
light or no light, Mr. Speaker, if there 
weren’t something universal in it? 
It is the same with injustice. He real-
ized that when there is injustice, we 
would know it, and we couldn’t know it 
if there wasn’t an absolute, universal 
justice and injustice. Then that even-
tually led him to further inquiries and 
further research, and he became a 
Christian. 
Well, Mr. Speaker, there is justice; 
there is injustice; and there are gray 
areas we argue about. But as John 
Adams said—and I will say it often be-
cause it was such a brilliant quote 
from one of the Founders who was 
there for the constitutional debate. He 
said: ‘‘Our Constitution was made only 
for a moral and religious people. It is 
wholly inadequate to the government 
of any other.’’ 
If we are not going to teach children 
that thou shalt not murder, then we 
can’t have a Second Amendment right. 
We must teach children that these 
things, these commandments, are uni-
versal, that you are not to lie and you 
are not to envy other people, and that 
there are things that are just not 
healthy for you and not healthy for so-
ciety and for the culture, and they are 
universal. They are not healthy, and 
they are not good. 
Honor your father and mother. Of 
course, fathers and mothers are sup-
posed to be fair with their children. 
But if we are not going to teach that, 
if we are just going to teach that ev-
erything is relative, that it depends on 
your circumstances, that it may be 
right for you and wrong for somebody 
else, right for them and wrong for you, 
no, it is all relative. 
If we are not going to teach that 
some things are absolute, then we can-
not have the rights that are provided 
that our Founders said were provided 
by our creator. We will have to get rid 
of them. We will have to go to being 
what some already want, and that is a 
totalitarian government. It is where it 
always goes. We are already breaking 
records every day that we continue to 
live under our Constitution, but we are 
no longer a religious, moral people. 
People thought, historically, when 
we got rid of slavery, we were so on the 
right track, and when Dr. King did so 
much to allow somebody, a little boy 
like me, to be able to treat like broth-
ers and sisters my brothers and sisters, 
he did so much. Then somehow now we 
are regressing where we want to have 
segregated dorms and segregated this 
and that. I can’t believe that people are 
wanting to regress. 
But, Mr. Speaker, if you are not 
going to teach some of these absolute 
moral truths, then we are going to 
have to give up our rights that our 
Founders—so many of them and so 
many over the last 240 years—have died 
to make sure we had. I don’t want to do 
that. I don’t want to give them up. 
But Congress has to start using bet-
ter judgment. Otherwise, it is very 
clear, historically, we are moving—we 
have people who are wanting us to 
move to that point where the rich ride 
private jets. In the old days, they rode 
horses and carriages. In the modern 
day, they will have their private jets. 
They will jet back and forth around the 
world, telling everybody how they 
can’t even have a wood-burning stove 
anymore and that you can’t fertilize 
your fields, so people are starving to 
death. 
Well, those are the peasants because 
the elite little ruling class has all the 
food they need. They have the guns 
they need. The peasants out there, for 
the good of the climate and for the 
good of the planet, you are going to 
live in your refuse, and you are not 
going to have the benefits that our 
wonderful ruling elites have. 
That is where it is going. That is 
what progressivism is. That is where it 
always goes, a totalitarian govern-
ment, a little elite group. They get to 
ride, and they have all the food. 
Mr. Speaker, look at Sri Lanka. They 
have an over 90 percent grade in ESG, 
and now people are starving and the 
government has been overthrown. 
This is where it is going. I don’t want 
to go there. We don’t have to go there. 
Let’s keep our rights under the Con-
stitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

resentatives prior to exercising any lease au-
thority provided in this resolution. 
Provided that, except for interim leases as 
described above, the Administrator may not 
enter into any leases that are below pro-
spectus level for the purposes of meeting any 
of the requirements, or portions thereof, in-
cluded in the prospectus that would result in 
an office utilization rate of 70 square feet or 
higher per person. 
Provided that, to the maximum extent 
practicable, the Administrator shall include 
in the lease contract(s) a purchase option 
that can be exercised at the conclusion of 
the firm term of the lease. 
Provided further, that the General Services

other agency the authority granted by this 
resolution. 
Provided further, that the Administrator 
shall require that the delineated area of the 
procurement is identical to the delineated

if the Administrator determines that the de-
lineated area of the procurement should not 
be identical to the delineated area included 
in the prospectus, the Administrator shall 
provide an explanatory statement to the 
Committee on Transportation and Infra-
structure of the House of Representatives 
prior to exercising any lease authority pro-
vided in this resolution. 
Provided further, not later than 30 calendar 
days after the date on which a request from 
the Chair or Ranking Member of the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infrastructure 
of the House of Representatives is received 
by the Administrator of General Services,

ber a response in writing that provides any

it does not contain a provision barring any 
individual holding a Federally-elected office, 
regardless of whether such individual took

H7063 
July 21, 2022 
STILL I RISE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TORRES
of New York). Under the 
Speaker’s announced policy of January 
4, 2021, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
GREEN) is recognized for 60 minutes as 
the designee of the majority leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, 
still I rise. And I rise today to address 
the unfortunate circumstances that 
took the lives of 19 children and 2 
teachers in Uvalde, Texas, at Robb Ele-
mentary School. 
I rise to address this because the 
families are still suffering. Children did 
not return home from school. This 
should never happen in our country. 
I will never forget the baby, the child 
who indicated that she took the blood 
from a friend who was lying on the 
floor, and she took that blood, and she 
put it on her body and on her face so 
that the gunman wouldn’t shoot her. 
She will have to live with this for the 
rest of her life. 
I rise because there have been many 
conflicting stories about what hap-
pened. Almost daily there was a dif-
ferent story, a different narrative. And 
at some point, the families deserve the 
truth about what happened in Uvalde, 
what happened at Robb Elementary 
School. 
They deserve the truth. 
And they deserve the truth because 
the pain and suffering may not imme-
diately leave them, but it will give 
them some hope that one day they will 
be able to wake up one morning and be 
relieved of some of the pain and suf-
fering that they are enduring cur-
rently. 
And to get to this truth, which some 
persons have tried to crush to earth, of 
course, we know that William Cullen 
Bryant is right: ‘‘Truth, crushed to 
earth, shall rise again.’’ 
They tried to crush the truth to 
earth, and they used—someone did— 
the Governor of the State of Texas be-
cause, wittingly or unwittingly, the 
Governor of the State of Texas laid a 
foundation for a coverup. 
Some 
things 
bear 
repeating. 
Wittingly or unwittingly, the Governor 
of the State of Texas laid the founda-
tion for a coverup. For, you see, the 
Governor took to the stage shortly 
after the shooting, perhaps a day later, 
he took to the stage, and he had with 
him persons with great credibility. 
He had with him the Lieutenant Gov-
ernor of the State of Texas, two U.S. 
Senators from the State of Texas; he 
had with him a State Representative 
and a State senator; with them, the Di-
rector of the Texas Department of Pub-
lic Safety, all on the stage with the 
Governor. 
With them, the Chief Patrol Agent 
for the Del Rio sector of the U.S. Bor-
der Patrol. He had with him the Uvalde 
mayor, the Uvalde County Judge, the 
chief of the Uvalde Consolidated Inde-
pendent School District, the Super-
intendent for the Uvalde Consolidated 
Independent School District, and the 
Commissioner for the Texas Education 
Agency, all on the stage with the Gov-
ernor. 
While on the stage with the Gov-
ernor, and in their presence, the Gov-
ernor made the following statement—I 
had my staff give me the statement. I 
want to read the statement that the 
Governor made because the Governor, 
whether wittingly or unwittingly, laid 
the foundation for a coverup. 
Here is what the Governor said: ‘‘The 
reality is, as horrible as what hap-
pened, it could have been worse. 
‘‘The reason it was not worse is be-
cause law enforcement officials did 
what they do.’’ 
They did what they do. This is the 
Governor speaking. And he goes on to 
say: ‘‘They showed amazing courage by 
running toward gunfire for the singular 
purpose of trying to save lives.’’ 
And these are the Governor’s words. 
‘‘And it is a fact that because of their 
quick response, getting on the scene of 
being able to respond to the gunman, 
and eliminating the gunman, they were 
able to save lives.’’ 
Well, Governor, you and I know that 
it is not a fact that this occurred, as 
you articulated. And we know, not be-
cause some righteous person came for-
ward to share the truth; not because 
there was an investigation and as a re-
sult of the investigation truths crushed 
to earth are now alive again. 
No, it is because a news source re-
leased a video. It was a George Floyd 
moment. But for the video, there prob-
ably would not have been a successful 
prosecution in the George Floyd case. 
It was an Edmund Pettus Bridge mo-
ment. But for—at that time, the tape, 
I suppose—the actual showing of what 
happened 
at 
the 
Edmund 
Pettus 
Bridge, on Bloody Sunday, I wouldn’t 
be in Congress. 
The video spoke truth to power. 
When power was attempting to cover 
up the truth, the video spoke truth. 
The video is available for the world to 
see. 
And upon seeing this video, the Gov-
ernor indicated that he was misled, de-
ceived, if you will. That is what the 
Governor says. 
Well, before we go on, I think it is 
important for us to expose the defini-
tion of coverup, because there are 
many persons who have their own defi-
nition. But I like the one that Oxford 
gives. This is the Oxford definition. 
The 
Oxford 
definition 
of 
coverup. 
Coverup per Oxford: An attempt to pre-
vent people’s discovering the truth 
about a serious mistake, a serious mis-
take, or a crime. 
You can have a coverup and not have 
a crime. You can have a coverup, and 
there is only an attempt, an attempt to 
prevent the discovery. 
So our discovering by way of the 
video does not eviscerate the fact that 
a coverup was taking place. They were 
trying to hide the truth. They were en-
gaging in insidious prevarication. 
‘‘ . . . because Carlyle is right, ‘No lie 
can live forever.’ ’’ 
‘‘Truth, crushed to earth, shall rise 
again,’’ William Cullen Bryant. 
The video is the truth. And now, Gov-
ernor, you have a duty, responsibility, 
and an obligation to the people of the 
State of Texas and to those babies who 
lost their lives, you have got a respon-
sibility to come forward and tell us 
who told you that all of these heroic 
actions took place. The people need to 
know, but those parents need to know 
because of their suffering. 
Who was it that was trying to cover 
up the truth? You know who the person 
is, Governor. You have the responsi-
bility to bring it to the attention of 
the public. 
And if that person received that in-
telligence, or lack of intelligence, 
flawed information, fallacious com-
mentary, if that person received it 
from another person, then we need to 
know who that person is. And we need 
to know until we get to the person who 
initiated this fabrication, this prevari-
cation. We need to know who initiated 
it. 
Who was the genesis of the coverup? 
That is the Governor’s responsibility. 
You need to do this, Governor, and 
you need to do it immediately, if not 
sooner. You need to do it because you 
are the Chief Executive Officer of the 
State of Texas. You are the person who 
can assemble all of these high-profile 
persons. 
You are the person who gave credi-
bility to the insidious prevarication. 
You are the person, Governor. All of 
these high-profile people were there be-
cause you were there. That was your 
call. 
All of your credibility is on the line 
now. You need to expose the person 
who brought this fabrication to you 
such that you would then present it to 
the world. 
And I say to the public at large, and 
anybody who is listening, my dear 
friends and colleagues, I say to you, it 
has to be somebody the Governor 
trusts. 
b 1345 
It has to be somebody that he be-
lieves in. It has to be somebody that he 
was willing to accept that person’s 
word and go on national TV and repeat, 
echo, what that person told him. 
Governor, you have got to do it. You 
have got to expose the person who 
brought this to you, and it has to be, in 
my opinion, somebody that you trust. 
Somebody that you believe would vet 
the information before sharing it with 
you. Somebody that has been with you. 
Somebody that you have confidence in. 
It is not somebody that just walked 
off the street. It is not somebody that 
you just happened to meet as you were 
coming to the press conference. No, 
Governor. It is somebody that you 
know and trust, and you’ve got to ex-
pose that person. 
That person doesn’t deserve to be se-
creted. That is not something that we 
would accord a person who would 
present such a prevarication. You have 
got to reveal the name of that person. 
If there is a person that told this per-
son that you are secreting so far or you

are not telling us about, then we need 
to know who that was. We have got to 
get back to the source, the genesis, of 
this misinformation that you claim 
you received. 
Governor, I will give you this admo-
nition. If you do not go back to the 
genesis, at some point, Governor, the 
eye of suspicion will be on you. At 
some point, Governor, this will no 
longer be a question of who told you. 
At some point, this will become a ques-
tion of why did you do this? Why did 
you do this to these families? 
Why would you further a prevari-
cation that would cause them to em-
brace the people who behaved in a pu-
sillanimous fashion; timid, cowardly. 
Why would you want them to embrace 
them as heroes? 
I support law enforcement. My uncle 
was a deputy sheriff. I am in Congress 
because of my uncle. One day he told 
me I was going to be a lawyer, and I be-
lieved him. I went on the rest of my 
life trying to become a lawyer because 
my uncle said it was such that I would 
do. 
Well, I support law enforcement, but 
I don’t support what happened that I 
saw on that video. You can be opposed 
and antithetical to what happened on 
the video and not be antithetical to 
law enforcement. That is just a fact. 
You don’t have to be antithetical to 
every law enforcement officer because 
you see something that you find dis-
tasteful on the video, that is disdain-
ful. No. 
I support law enforcement, but I will 
never support what I saw on that video, 
and those babies deserve justice, Gov-
ernor. So it is up to you, Governor. It 
is up to you now to do that which 
righteousness requires. Righteousness. 
I am also saddened because the offi-
cers who appeared, they were in body 
armor. Some of them; not all, but some 
of them. They had shields; not all, but 
some of them. They had long guns; not 
all, but some of them. 
It has been reported that more than 
300 officers appeared—300. Long guns, 
short guns, body armor, shields, hel-
mets. 
In Texas, there are those who want a 
teacher with a pistol to do what more 
than 300 persons armed with long guns, 
protected by body armor, some with 
shields, what they could not do or did 
not do within an hour. 
More than 70 minutes lapsed before 
the gunman was taken out, but we ex-
pect a teacher in the State of Texas to 
be prepared to take out a gunman with 
an AR–15-type weapon. 
This is a level of inanity that borders 
on insanity, something that is totally 
unacceptable among people of good 
will. Teachers ought to be allowed to 
teach. Let teachers teach. 
We train the constabulary to deal 
with these kinds of issues, the police, 
the Department of Public Safety offi-
cers, the Texas Rangers. They get paid 
to deal with these issues. Let teachers 
teach. 
Let’s secure schools. Let’s make sure 
every school has locks that lock—locks 
that lock—doors that shut, and that 
there is a culture in the school that 
prohibits the use of emergency exits 
for routine visits to your automobile or 
some other place outside of the school. 
That would be important for the pro-
tection of life. 
But there is something else that 
could have been done, because, Gov-
ernor, those babies shouldn’t have lost 
their lives. There is something that 
you and I and other persons who hold 
public trust, who can pass laws, could 
have done to save the lives of those ba-
bies. 
Governor, 18-year-olds should not be 
able to purchase weapons of war. Weap-
ons of war belong in Ukraine, not 
Uvalde. 
Babies shouldn’t die in school be-
cause someone has a weapon of war. He 
should not have been able to purchase 
that long gun, that weapon of war. If 
he had not been able to purchase it, 
they wouldn’t have died at the hands of 
a person with a weapon of war. So I say 
to you: They shouldn’t have died as a 
result of that long gun, that weapon of 
war. 
But there is a way for you to vindi-
cate yourself. Here is how you can vin-
dicate yourself, Governor. You have 
the authority, the awesome power. By 
virtue of the office you hold, you have 
the power to call a special session of 
the State legislature in the State of 
Texas. 
When you call that special session, 
Governor, you have the power, the awe-
some power, to have on the agenda leg-
islation that will prohibit the sale of 
an AR–15-style weapon, a long gun, to 
an 18-year-old in the State of Texas. It 
shouldn’t happen. It shouldn’t have 
happened. 
We can prevent it from happening 
again, but it takes will more than way. 
The way is there. We have the power. 
Do we have the will is the question. 
I haven’t seen the will. There ought 
to be the will because we have seen this 
circumstance before. This is not the 
first time. We have seen it in the Tops 
grocery store; 10 people murdered. 
Walmart store, people murdered. We 
have the power. 
At some point, the American public, 
which believes that there should not be 
long guns of this type in the hands of 
persons who are under 21, at some 
point, the American public is going to 
turn on somebody, and I don’t mean in 
a violent way—I mean at the polls on 
election day. The American public is 
going to announce its position at some 
point. At some point, some persons are 
going to find themselves making an 
early exit, if you will. 
So I am going to ask that we cease 
and desist with this fabrication or be-
lief that there is nothing we can do, 
that the Constitution doesn’t allow it. 
Yes, it does. 
The Constitution doesn’t say you 
can’t have some regulations. The Con-
stitution doesn’t say you can have a 
bazooka. You can’t have a switchblade 
drone; you can’t have a predator. And 
if you are under 21, you ought not be 
able to have a weapon of war. 
Mr. Speaker, I’m going to close with 
this commentary. It is not enough for 
things to be right. They must also look 
right. 
While it may be right for the Gov-
ernor to have had a press conference 
with all of these outstanding personal-
ities with great credibility, it may 
have been right. It may have been right 
for the Governor to receive what he 
perceives at the time to be credible in-
formation and find out later that it is 
not credible and to just ignore this. I 
don’t say that it is, but maybe it is 
right. 
But it is not enough for things to be 
right, they must also look right; and it 
doesn’t look right for the Governor to 
know who gave him this insidious pre-
varication and to secret the name of 
the person. 
It is not enough for things to be 
right, they must also look right; this 
does not look right. 
Because I believe it isn’t right, I am 
calling on the Governor to act expedi-
tiously, reveal the name of the person, 
and to do so with the understanding 
that if this person is under your com-
mand, under your office, then there has 
to be some sanctions imposed. 
Mr. Speaker, the babies and the peo-
ple of the State of Texas deserve no 
less. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Democratic leader is recog-
nized. 
CANNABIS ADMINISTRATION AND OPPORTUNITY 
ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
over the last few decades, Americans’ 
views on cannabis legalization have 
dramatically, dramatically changed. 
Twenty years ago, less than a third of 
Americans 
believed 
that 
cannabis 
should be made legal. Today, that 
share is nearly 70 percent of the popu-
lation, the highest level of support 
ever. 
We can see this shift playing out in 
the States. Nearly 90 percent of Ameri-
cans live in a State that has legalized 
cannabis for either medical or adult 
recreational use. New York legalized 
cannabis in 2021. And even voters in 
deep-red South Dakota voted to legal-
ize it for adult recreational use. 
Cannabis legalization has proven im-
mensely successful at the State level 
so it is time that Congress catches up 
with the rest of the country. 
Last year, Senators WYDEN, BOOKER, 
and I released a discussion draft of the 
Cannabis Administration and Oppor-
tunity Act. After receiving more than 
1,800 public comments and working 
with numerous Senate committees to 
improve the bill, today we are intro-
ducing this historic legislation. 
I am proud to be the first majority 
leader ever to say that it is time to end 
the Federal prohibition on cannabis, 
and this bill provides the best frame-
work for updating our cannabis laws 
and reversing decades of harm inflicted 
by the War on Drugs. 
I have had many productive con-
versations with my Republican and 
Democratic colleagues about cannabis 
reform, and I look forward to working 
with Members from both sides of the 
aisle to secure support for this bill. 
Our bill will legalize cannabis by re-
moving it from the Controlled Sub-
stances Act, empowering States to cre-
ate their own cannabis laws instead. It

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3582 
July 21, 2022 
will establish a robust regulatory sys-
tem to protect public health and en-
sure that cannabis is as safe as pos-
sible. It includes rules to prevent im-
paired driving, prevent youth access, 
and prevent illegal diversion. We also 
robustly fund a variety of research pro-
grams to make up for lost time when it 
comes to cannabis research. 
So important, our bill will also ex-
punge the Federal criminal records of 
people with convictions for nonviolent 
cannabis offenses and allow those in 
Federal prison for nonviolent cannabis 
offenses to appeal their sentences. 
It is a tragedy—tragedy—that far too 
many Americans, particularly Black 
and Hispanic Americans, have perma-
nent blocks on their record, making it 
nearly impossible to move forward 
with their lives just because they were 
arrested with a little marijuana in 
their pocket. How unfair and what a 
waste of human resources. 
Our bill will also establish an Oppor-
tunity Trust Fund to reinvest in com-
munities that have been devastated by 
the War on Drugs. And it will create 
opportunities for entrepreneurs and 
small businesses to legitimately pursue 
new opportunities in the growing can-
nabis industry. 
And, of course, underlying it all, this 
bill is about individual freedom and 
basic fairness. The fact that cannabis 
remains a schedule I controlled sub-
stance—in the same bad company of 
other drugs like heroin—is not just 
senseless; it is deeply harmful for 
countless Americans—again, almost al-
ways people of color—and it impinges 
on the freedom of all of us. If this is 
working in all the States, why not let 
people use it? 
We need to change that. We need to 
change the lack of freedom and fair-
ness. We need to create opportunities 
for entrepreneurs to legitimately pur-
sue new opportunities, and comprehen-
sive Federal cannabis legislation is 
critical to reaching that goal. 
I want to extend my deep apprecia-
tion to Senators BOOKER and WYDEN as 
well as all of my colleagues who have 
worked with us on this important and 
long-overdue change. I want to thank 
Senators MURRAY and Senator PETERS 
and all the chairs of the more than 10 
Senate committees who worked with 
us over the past several years to sig-
nificantly improve the bill from the 
discussion draft we released last year. 
This bill would not be possible without 
the hard work of them and their staffs. 
I want to stress that this is the be-
ginning of the legislative process, not 
the end. We are going to work hard to 
create support for our bill, and I hope 
we can make more progress toward 
cannabis reform in the future. I look 
forward to working with Democrats 
and Republicans to get something done 
this year. 
H.R. 4346 
Madam President, now on the chips 
bill, last night, I filed cloture on a 
major piece of legislation that will 
help lower costs, boost scientific inno-
vation, and take direct aim at the na-
tional chips shortage, which is hurting 
almost every single American. 
Members of both sides know that 
America’s chips crisis is sending shock 
waves across the economy. It is endan-
gering our national security. According 
to an article by Bloomberg, China’s top 
chipsmaker has now likely advanced 
its tech by two generations, threat-
ening U.S. competitiveness. 
To ignore the chips crisis means 
higher costs, squandered job opportuni-
ties, and greater dependence on foreign 
chip producers. Thankfully, the Senate 
is close to finally taking action. 
In the long run, our bipartisan chips 
bill will ease semiconductor supply 
chain woes, increase domestic inven-
tory of chips, and thus help lower costs 
on all sorts of products that rely on 
chips to work. 
But because the vote earlier this 
week was so bipartisan, I amended the 
bill to include one of the largest 
science packages the Senate has con-
sidered in a long time. 
As you know, I was the original au-
thor of many of the provisions in the 
science section when I worked with 
Senator YOUNG on the Endless Frontier 
Act more than 2 years ago. 
We will devote tens of billions of dol-
lars to cultivate the next generation of 
tech hubs all across the country, espe-
cially in regions that have been over-
looked. We will invest in new science 
jobs, and that will keep America No. 1. 
It has always been America’s cutting- 
edge lead on innovation, in science and 
research, that has then created mil-
lions and millions of good-paying jobs 
and kept our economy prosperous. In 
the last decade, America seems to have 
forgotten that, and this bill revitalizes 
that goal and that dream. 
These scientific investments are cru-
cial not just for innovation and science 
jobs but for critical jobs that support 
these industries too. 
I will keep working with my col-
leagues to get this bill done quickly. 
With 64 votes in favor of moving for-
ward earlier this week, there is no rea-
son to wait around. 
The 21st century will be won or lost 
on the battleground of technological 
innovation. Let me say it again be-
cause that is a crucial sentence. The 
21st century will be won or lost on the 
battleground of technological innova-
tion. 
Our country now faces a moment of 
truth: Will American workers, Amer-
ican tech, and American ingenuity 
shape the world over the next hundred 
years in the same way we have shaped 
it in the last hundred? Of course, I be-
lieve America will lead the way if this 
Chamber is willing to do what is nec-
essary for our economic and national 
security. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Madam President, now on prescrip-
tion drugs, later today, Senate Demo-
crats and Republicans will meet with 
the Parliamentarian to start the so- 
called Byrd bath on legislation to bring 
down the cost of prescription drugs, 
cap out-of-pocket expenses, and make 
sure millions of Americans do not see 
their premiums go up in the coming 
months. This is an important step in 
the larger process of bringing a rec-
onciliation bill to the floor that can 
win the support of all 50 Democratic 
Senators. 
Ask any American on the street, and 
it is a guarantee that they will agree 
the price of prescription medications is 
one of the most frustrating and debili-
tating problems in our country. 
It is a vicious pincer grip: On the one 
hand, Americans desperately need their 
medicines to stay healthy, live a nor-
mal life, and stay alive, in some cases, 
but on the other hand, that means 
many Americans have to pay an arm 
and a leg at the pharmacy just to stay 
healthy. 
Meanwhile, as Americans pay exorbi-
tant prices for basic medications, the 
Nation’s largest pharmaceutical com-
panies are feasting off record profits 
because they face little accountability 
for jacking up prices to consumers. 
This cannot continue. 
Democrats are going to work in the 
weeks ahead on legislation that will 
empower Medicare to negotiate the 
price of prescription drugs for the first 
time ever. We will also cap out-of- 
pocket expenses at $2,000 a year. These 
changes will save Americans an incred-
ible amount of money, and it is one of 
the best things we can do to lower 
costs for the American people. 
Let me say again, lowering the cost 
of prescription drugs and capping out- 
of-pocket expenses is one of the very 
best things we can do to fight inflation 
and lower costs for the American peo-
ple. So those who talk about inflation, 
support this bill. 
So in the coming weeks, the question 
before the Senate will be simple: Who 
will take action in this Chamber to 
bring down the cost of prescription 
drugs and make sure premiums don’t 
go up in the future, and who will de-
fend the interests of Big Pharma that 
spikes the prices of scores of crucial 
drugs? 
TUCKER CARLSON 
Madam President, finally, on FOX 
News, earlier this week, FOX News an-
chor Tucker Carlson once again used 
his enormous platform on prime-time 
television to spread the malicious, dan-
gerous, and racist conspiracy of ‘‘re-
placement theory.’’ It is far from the 
first time he has done so. But in light 
of the recent violence in Buffalo in-
spired by ‘‘replacement theory,’’ it is 
shocking 
and 
dangerous 
for 
Mr. 
Carlson to keep propagating this mes-
sage. 
I am deeply disappointed—frankly, 
outraged—that FOX News has taken no 
action to address the conduct of Mr. 
Carlson. It makes me sick to my stom-
ach to think that Mr. Carlson has been 
given a free pass to amplify racist con-
spiracy theories to millions of Ameri-
cans—theories that are eerily similar 
to those cited by Buffalo’s horrible 
shooter.

There is only one way to describe

MEASURES PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—H.R. 8404 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
understand that there is a bill at the 
desk that is due for a second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator is correct. 
The clerk will read the bill by title 
for the second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 8404) to repeal the Defense of 
Marriage Act and ensure respect for State 
regulation of marriage, and for other pur-
poses. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceeding. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.

CHIPS ACT OF 2022—Continued 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER

Washington Democrats’ one-party gov-
ernment has actually performed an 
amazing feat. In 18 months, they have 
taken an economy that was ready to 
soar and completely derailed it with $2 
trillion 
in 
unnecessary 
borrowing, 
printing, and spending. Now, 9.1 per-
cent inflation is pinching hard-working 
Americans every time they visit the 
gas pump or the grocery store. 
The Biden administration has tried 
their hardest to find a silver lining 
amid the economic storm clouds they 
helped create. They have touted the 
strength of consumer spending to con-
clude our economy is strong. That is 
what they said. Well, of course, con-
sumer spending has only gone up be-
cause the price of nearly everything 
has increased. A recent economic anal-
ysis shows the American people do 
spend more on gas, groceries, furniture, 
and clothes than we used to, but—lis-
ten to this—adjusted for inflation, they 
are actually consuming less—paying 
more, getting less. 
Parents of school-age kids are some 
of the hardest hit. Four in ten say they 
won’t go back-to-school shopping be-
fore the upcoming school year. One 
young mother in Nevada says she will 
‘‘pick out one or two shirts’’ for her 
daughter ‘‘and that’s it.’’ Inflation has 
made everything else too expensive. 
Over in Arizona, inflation forces the 
average household to spend over $9,600 
more a year compared to when Presi-
dent Biden took office. Many families 
simply don’t have that much wiggle 
room in their budgets and are resorting 
to desperate measures simply to stay 
afloat. 
One Phoenix area food bank has seen 
a 78-percent increase in visitors com-
pared with just last year—78 percent 
more families who simply can’t afford 
to live in this Democrat-run economy. 
A woman in line at the food bank said 
she had never needed to visit one be-
fore but ‘‘the prices are way too high’’ 
right now to support four children on 
her husband’s salary. 
Colorado families are facing the 
highest inflation costs in the Nation, 
in the whole country: nearly $10,900 in 
extra spending per year compared to 
the beginning of the Biden administra-
tion. Not surprisingly, Coloradans are 
falling behind on paying for daily ne-
cessities. One pawn shop owner in the 
State has noticed a marked increase in 
loan seekers at his business. For most 
of them, they just need ‘‘30 bucks, 40 
bucks’’ to ‘‘pay small bills, get gas, put 
groceries on the table.’’ 
This is all happening in my home 
State of Kentucky as well. People are 
taking out loans, cutting back spend-
ing, and relying on charity just to cope 
with ever-increasing prices. But that 
hasn’t stopped Washington Democrats 
from proposing new ways to wreck our 
economy. As we speak, they are bat-
ting around a new suite of tax hikes 
aimed squarely at the middle class. If 
Democrat-driven 
inflation 
hasn’t 
pushed struggling families off the edge 
quite yet, the Democrat-driven reces-
sion certainly will finish the job. 
So what is on the menu? New taxes 
on small businesses already struggling 
with inflation, new fees and regula-
tions on American energy producers 
that will send prices even higher at the 
pump, 
new 
socialist 
price 
control 
schemes to stifle healthcare innova-
tion. 
Apparently, record inflation isn’t 
enough to make Democrats realize 
their reckless economic agenda is a 
failure, an abject failure. Maybe tax- 
hike-induced stagflation will set them 
straight. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, now on another 
matter, I had the honor, along with 
others, of greeting the First Lady of 
Ukraine, Olena Zelenska, who greeted 
us here in the Capitol. Like my col-
leagues in the room, I was moved by 
her blunt, plaintive remarks to Con-
gress. As her country endures the fifth 
month of a brutal Russian siege, Ms. 
Zelenska was candid about the pain 
and suffering Russia’s unprovoked war 
of aggression was causing her home-
land. She said: ‘‘Russia is destroying 
our people.’’ 
The First Lady conveyed the incred-
ible determination of the Ukrainian 
people and echoed their simple request 
for the tools to fight their own fight— 
‘‘Weapons,’’ she said, ‘‘to protect one’s 
home and the right to wake up alive in 
that home.’’ 
I hope the First Lady’s visit helped 
steel our colleagues’ resolve as friends 
of Ukraine. Russia’s invasion has al-
ready reminded the West that revi-
sionist aggressors cannot be appeased. 
And 
Ukraine’s 
brave 
resistance, 
equipped with the arsenal of the free 
world, is a further reminder that this is 
a fight they intend to win. 
The Senate should be proud of our 
work over the past several months to 
get 
more 
lethal 
capabilities 
into 
Ukrainian hands. But at every step of 
the way, the Biden administration has 
been a bit slow to green light the 
game-changing 
weapons 
Ukraine’s 
frontline defenders actually need. 
I urged the President for more than a 
year to take specific actions to deter 
Russian aggression against Ukraine— 
actually, before it escalated. Last 
June, I urged him to deliver lethal ca-
pabilities to Ukraine and other states 
in Vladimir Putin’s crosshairs. Instead, 
the administration slow-walked secu-
rity assistance for months. 
In December, I called for U.S. mili-
tary 
reinforcements 
along 
NATO’s 
eastern flank, but the President waited 
until February to deploy forces—too 
late to deter Putin’s aggression. And 
even after Russia had launched its un-
lawful invasion, the President has re-
peatedly deterred himself from pro-
viding 
Ukraine 
the 
capabilities 
it 
needs. 
With nearly every weapons system 
requested by Ukraine, the cycle in 
Washington plays out like this: first, 
hesitation and concern; then, excuses 
that Ukraine couldn’t effectively use 
the proposed weapons or objections 
that providing them would escalate the 
conflict; then—then—grudging willing-
ness to transfer the weapons; and fi-
nally, 
with 
weapons 
in 
Ukrainian 
hands, self-congratulations from the 
Biden administration that they are 
having a positive impact on the battle-
field. It is exhausting to watch this de-
cision-making cycle repeat itself from 
Kentucky. It must be exacerbating to 
watch it from Kyiv. 
The need for advanced, longer-range 
weapons to turn back Russia’s aggres-
sion is painfully obvious. Air defense 
capabilities to combat Russia’s con-
tinuing long-range strikes against ci-
vilian 
populations 
across 
Ukraine, 
anti-ship weapons to combat the Rus-
sia Black Sea blockade and the human-
itarian food crisis it is causing world-
wide, and more capable, longer-range 
artillery to pound Russian positions in 
occupied Ukraine from relative safe-
ty—this will help offset any numerical 
advantage Russia has achieved by 
pumping so much more combat power 
into its invasion force.

So here it is. Putin cannot be allowed 
to believe he can just wait for the West 
to become complacent. It would do a 
moral disservice to the brave Ukrain-
ians fighting every single day for their 
country. But this is not just about 
Ukraine’s security. If Russia achieves 
its objective in Ukraine, it will imperil 
our own security. And if we waiver—if 
we waiver—on Ukraine, it would cer-
tainly send an unmistakable signal of 
weakness to Beijing, which is watching 
the conflict in Ukraine very closely. 
For their part, so are our friends and 
allies in China’s backyard. As Japan’s 
Prime Minister put it back in May: 
‘‘Ukraine might be East Asia tomor-
row.’’ 
Russia’s brutal war has cost the peo-
ple of Ukraine their homes, their safe-
ty, and their lives. But it has also re-
awakened the West to the reality of 
long-term deterrence and competition. 
It has led modern partners like Swe-
den and Finland to cast their lot with 
the greatest military alliance in the 
history of the world. And it has 
prompted 
current 
treaty 
allies 
to 
shake off years of neglect for their own 
defense capabilities. All of this will re-
sult in greater burden-sharing, inter-
operability, military capability, and 
collective security for the NATO alli-
ance. 
The United States cannot afford to 
neglect this lesson ourselves. As the 
leader of the free world and the No. 1 
target of revisionist adversaries like 
China and Russia, we have to take seri-
ously our obligation to maintain Amer-
ica’s military superiority. 
We need to act quickly and pass a de-
fense authorization bill that restores 
our readiness, grows our stockpiles of 
critical munitions, reinforces our posi-
tion along NATO’s eastern flank, and 
lays the foundations for a new era of 
credible deterrence in Asia by modern-
izing and equipping our military for 
real competition with China. 
I hope the Democratic leader will let 
the Senate take action on this critical 
legislation without further delay. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority whip. 
HIGHLAND PARK SHOOTING 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
have a great number of holidays each 
year in America. But is there a more 
perfect holiday than the Fourth of 
July? We celebrate the birth of our Na-
tion. We gather with our families for 
picnics, a trip to the beach, backyard 
barbecues, take in a baseball game, and 
go to a parade. It is just the ultimate 
American celebration. We relax, pull 
out our American flags, gather our 
kids, and thank God that we are born 
in this great Nation and can call it 
home. 
But this last Fourth of July became 
a different scene in one part of my 
home State of Illinois. It was the first 
time in years that the people of High-
land Park were able to gather together 
publicly. So there was a special cele-
bration as they gathered at 10 in the 
morning for the Fourth of July parade. 
Oh, in addition to the usual suspects 
at these parades, political candidates, 
there were a lot of groups just there in 
pure celebration: high school bands, 
gatherings of veterans, all sorts of 
groups in a wonderful, wonderful sub-
urban town in the Chicagoland area of 
Highland Park. 
Yesterday, we held a hearing in the 
Senate Judiciary Committee about the 
day of the July Fourth parade in High-
land Park. I wish we didn’t have to 
hold that hearing. I would rather it 
would have been some other subject, 
some other place. But it was the 10th 
hearing during this Congress—the 10th 
time—that we had held a hearing in 
the Judiciary Committee on gun vio-
lence—gun violence, the No. 1 cause of 
death of children in America. Let me 
repeat that: gun violence, the No. 1 
cause of death among children in 
America. 
Yesterday, we focused on Highland 
Park and the Fourth of July parade, 
and we focused on the obvious mass 
shooting incident that took place. And 
we focused on military-style assault 
weapons. 
The Fourth of July shooting in High-
land Park, IL, was the 309th mass 
shooting in America this year. What is 
a mass shooting? When four people are 
either injured or killed—309 times it 
had happened before July the Fourth. 
By the time of yesterday’s hearing, 
16 days after the Fourth of July, that 
number of 309 had grown by 47 mass 
shootings since the Fourth of July in 
America—16 days, 47 more mass shoot-
ings. 
Where else on Earth is this taking 
place? Nowhere. Right here in the 
United States of America is the only 
place on Earth where mass shootings 
are happening on such a frequent basis. 
In many of the deadliest shootings, 
the attacker used an assault weapon, a 
combat weapon—a gun specifically de-
signed to kill the maximum number of 
people in just a few seconds; the same 
weapon we saw in Uvalde, TX, where 
the kids in their classrooms were 
killed; the same weapon we saw in the 
supermarket in Buffalo, NY, when 
early morning shoppers on a Saturday 
were killed; and, sadly, the same weap-
on that was used in Highland Park. 
During the Fourth of July parade in 
Highland Park, a deranged gunman 
perched himself on a rooftop, using a 
Smith & Wesson assault rifle, killing 
seven people and wounding dozens 
more. He shot 83 rounds in less than a 
minute. Let me say that again: 83 
rounds in less than a minute. 
This is Aiden McCarthy. Aiden is 2 
years old. His mom and dad, Kevin and 
Irina McCarthy, took him to the 
Fourth of July parade in Highland 
Park. I first heard about him just an 
hour or 2 after this terrible incident. I 
called my friend Nancy Rotering, who 
is the mayor of Highland Park, and 
asked her: Tell me, what can I do? 
She said: I don’t know. Things are 
happening so fast. We actually found a 
2-year-old toddler who was wandering 
on the street by himself. We don’t 
know who he belongs to. His picture is 
being circulated in the community. 
The conclusion was fairly obvious. 
Whoever brought him to that parade 
was not able to look for him and care 
for him. And the story eventually un-
folded. 
Kevin 
and 
Irina 
McCarthy 
brought Aiden to the parade—his first 
parade. And then when the shooting 
started, they shielded him with their 
bodies. In a matter of minutes, Aiden 
lost both of his parents. Fortunately, a 
grandparent was located, and Aiden is 
in safe hands today. 
But because of this assault weapon 
being fired on the crowd, he lost his 
mom and dad. That is the reality when 
a parent has to shield a child like this 
from a mass shooting. 
Nancy Rotering, as I mentioned ear-
lier, is mayor of Highland Park. She 
testified yesterday about the parade. 
She told us that when the shooting 
started, she thought the sound of bul-
lets was actually a drum cadence from 
the local marching band. That is how 
fast the bullets were being fired. 
When she realized there was an ac-
tive shooter, she began evacuating the 
crowd. She said the adults she con-
fronted stared back at her. They didn’t 
understand what she was saying. But 
the children, the teenagers, they un-
derstood. This was a shooter; this 
wasn’t a drill. 
Did you hear that? The children and 
the teens at the Highland Park parade 
instinctively knew what was happening 
because they had been trained in their 
schools to deal with mass shootings. 
That is how common these mass shoot-
ings have become. 
I grew up in a different era, Cold War 
era, where it was duck and cover under 
your desk for fear of a nuclear attack— 
an attack by the Soviet Union. These 
kids—our 
kids, 
our 
grandkids—are 
being schooled not just in the ABCs, 
but they are being schooled in survival, 
so that if a shooter shows up in a class-
room, they know what to do to try to 
survive. 
Mayor Rotering told the Judiciary 
Committee: 
Our children are expected to return to 
school in [about] a month. . . . They are 
frightened to go back. . . . They are fright-
ened to play outside. Many never want to go 
to . . . parade[s] again. For the rest of their 
lives, they will look over their shoulders, 
ready for another active shooter, thanks to 
the drills our society has normalized [in our 
classrooms]. 
She continued: 
Playing outside is normal. Back to school 
is normal. Fear of a shooter is not normal; 
but now in Highland Park [Illinois] and so 
many other American communities, it is 
[the new normal]. 
It can’t be said enough that mass 
shootings with assault weapons are a 
unique American phenomenon. They 
are devastating—so devastating. 
I want to show you another picture 
with Aiden McCarthy. This is Cooper 
Roberts, 8 years old. Cooper and his 
twin brother Luke went to the parade 
with their mom and dad. And in the

course of the shooting, he was shot, 
taken to the hospital immediately. He 
has gone through at least seven or 
eight surgeries now, touch and go for 
many days as to whether he would live. 
And, sadly, in addition to the damage 
that was done to his body, his spinal 
cord was severed by this same bullet. 
You see, when you fire an assault 
weapon at a human body, it hits that 
body at three times the ordinary veloc-
ity of any other firearm. It is so power-
ful that it was originally designed by 
the U.S. Army to achieve a single goal 
described to us in the committee yes-
terday. That goal was to be able to 
shoot one of these AR–15s and pierce a 
metal helmet worn by a soldier 500 
yards away—five football fields—the 
AR–15. It is not another firearm. It is a 
killing weapon. And, unfortunately, 
Cooper Roberts was in the line of fire. 
We pray that he recovers. 
His mom and dad have kept us post-
ed, all of us posted, as to his progress. 
But if you think about the devastation 
that an AR–15 combat weapon assault 
rifle can do to a human body, imagine 
what it did to this poor little boy’s 
body. That is the reality of the issue 
we are discussing. 
Many gun manufacturers, like Smith 
& Wesson, Mossberg, Bushmaster, and 
Daniel Defense have launched ad cam-
paigns marketing their assault weap-
ons like they are fashion accessories. 
Let me show you a few of them. This 
is from Mossberg: 
Engineered to the specs of freedom and 
independence, stand and salute the tactical 
rifle. We are America’s oldest family-owned 
firearms manufacturer, building dependable, 
hard-working rifles and shotguns since 1919. 
American built, American strong. Arm your-
self with a Mossberg. 
That is the type of weapon that shot 
Cooper Roberts, that killed the parents 
of Aiden McCarthy. How is it being 
marketed? A symbol of independence 
and freedom. 
Some of these other ads—want proof 
of your manhood? ‘‘Consider your Man 
Card reissued,’’ says Bushmaster with 
their AR–15. 
I want to make sure, as we said at 
the 
hearing 
yesterday, 
that 
these 
weapons are properly characterized. I 
will tell you how I characterize them. 
The manufacturers of these weapons 
should be ashamed of what is hap-
pening across America. To suggest that 
this typifies the values of this country 
is just plain wrong and offensive. It is 
time for us to name and shame these 
companies. It is time to hold them ac-
countable for the devastation they 
made possible. How many AR–15s are 
there in America? We don’t really 
know. The best estimate is 20 million— 
20 million. 
I want to dispel a common talking 
point we hear from the other side of 
the aisle. We heard it yesterday. They 
claim our communities don’t need new 
gun safety laws; all they need are good 
guys with guns. I wish it were that 
simple. It is not. 
In one survey of 433 active shooter 
attacks, how many were stopped by a 
good guy with a gun? Twenty-two out 
of four hundred and thirty-three— 
about 5 percent. Half of those 22 were 
security guards and trained law en-
forcement who were there present on 
the scene and off duty. 
The sad reality is, when the police 
come on the scene and someone is hold-
ing a gun, they don’t know if it is a 
perpetrator, a danger, or somebody on 
their side. In many instances, they 
shoot the wrong person, making a 
split-second decision in seeing a person 
holding a gun. 
So this notion that we are going to 
come to the rescue of one another and 
stop mass shootings is not a reality. 
Five percent of active shooter attacks 
were stopped by a good guy with a 
gun—5 percent. Imagine buying a car 
and being told there is only a 5-percent 
chance that the airbag will go off if 
you need it in a crash? You wouldn’t 
take that car out of the dealership, and 
for good reason. 
We heard testimony yesterday from 
RAND Corporation firearms expert Dr. 
Kyleanne Hunter. She told us that as-
sault weapons make mass shootings 
significantly more lethal. 
The evidence is clear. It is time for 
us to have a national conversation 
about America and mass shooting. 
Let me say that the manufacturers 
shouldn’t get off the hook. They aren’t 
just selling you a product. 
Let me show you one other thing 
that is particularly outrageous. Sadly, 
this is in my home State of Illinois. It 
is a JR–15. It is designed to look like 
the AR–15, the combat weapon assault 
rifle. It is lighter, so it can be carried 
by a kid. Here are the symbols of this 
JR–15. They are skulls, skulls of chil-
dren. Each one of them has a pacifier 
in his mouth. It isn’t just on this post-
er, on this ad; it is emblazoned on the 
gun itself. This is a kid’s assault weap-
on. Think about that for a second. In 
America, we have reached a point 
where that is even thought of in light 
of the killing that has taken place. 
The hearing yesterday showed an 
outpouring of people from Highland 
Park in numbers I never expected. I be-
lieve there were 100 people there who, 
on their own dime, came out to Wash-
ington to make sure all of us in Con-
gress knew what happened in Highland 
Park, how that village and their lives 
were changed on the Fourth of July. 
What are we going to do about it— 
shrug our shoulders and wait for to-
morrow’s mass shooting? Sadly, we can 
expect one to come. 
I listen to the defenses, but, frankly, 
I can’t understand people trying to de-
fend the right to own an assault rifle in 
America. 
One Senator argued: Well, it is just 
an inanimate object, you know. Don’t 
blame the object for the results. 
I wonder if he feels the same way 
about a grenade launcher. Should peo-
ple have the right to own grenade 
launchers? I hope we can all agree that 
is an incredible thought. Why doesn’t 
this weapon fall into a similar cat-
egory, a combat, Army assault weapon 
that is being used by individuals to kill 
so many innocent people in this coun-
try—kill them at a concert in Las 
Vegas, at schools in Connecticut, at 
schools in Texas, at Fourth of July pa-
rades in my home State. 
Last month, we did come together— 
and I want to salute Senator MURPHY, 
who is on the floor—to pass a bill that 
was the most important gun safety law 
we considered in three decades. I voted 
for it. It didn’t address this issue at all 
except in the background checks for 
those under 21. And I am glad it did, 
but it didn’t address the issue of 
whether these guns should even be in 
America at this point, legal in Amer-
ica. That, I think, is the critical 
threshold issue. 
Incidentally, 
this 
shooter, 
who 
seemed to have a pretty ill-fated life 
from the start, managed to buy high- 
capacity magazines so that he could 
clip in quickly 30 rounds here, 30 
rounds there, and fire off 83 times. Why 
in the world does anyone need a high- 
capacity clip magazine? I don’t under-
stand it. It doesn’t have any practical 
value for sport or hunting. 
We need to address the widespread, 
serious problem of civilian access to 
military assault weapons, even for 
shooters as young as 18. 
I thank the people from Highland 
Park for coming yesterday and all the 
brave law enforcement and first re-
sponders whom I saw gather that 
evening when I arrived at Highland 
Park. We owe them a lot. They are 
doing an amazing job, and we should 
pay tribute to them and what they did. 
But even they, being present and 
armed, could not stop this from hap-
pening. They were up against a mighty 
weapon—a weapon we trust for the 
military, we trust for the police; a 
weapon which has no place in the 
hands of people like the shooter in 
Highland Park on the Fourth of July. 
Are we going to continue this Amer-
ican 
tradition 
of 
mass 
shootings? 
Sadly, we will unless this body, this 
Senate, decides that it is worth the 
fight, worth the political debate. After 
Highland Park, count me in. I want to 
be on the record saying it is time to 
put an end to these assault rifles, these 
weapons of war which have sadly taken 
so many innocent lives like poor Aiden 
McCarthy’s parents and five others 
who died in Highland Park. 
I hope for our children’s sake that we 
don’t run away from this problem. The 
people in Highland Park had to run 
away from the Fourth of July parade, 
and now they are counting on us to 
stand up and face it squarely. 
I yield the floor.

BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
America is facing a perfect storm of in-
flation, unsustainable energy costs, 
and supply chain chaos. Russia and 
Iran are circling the wagons. 
Joe Biden is still finding new ways to 
put the American people last. In fact,

when it comes to getting gas prices 
under control, he has chosen to unleash 
a 
China-first 
policy 
rather 
than 
unleashing the power of American en-
ergy. 
I have spent the past 18 months lay-
ing out in great detail how Joe Biden 
and the Democrats have damaged our 
credibility and enriched our adver-
saries. They undermined our economic 
recovery. They abandoned the border. 
They destroyed American energy inde-
pendence. The list goes on and on, un-
fortunately. It appears that everything 
they have done makes life worse for 
‘‘we the people.’’ 
Unfortunately, it is emboldening the 
axis of evil—Russia, China, Iran, North 
Korea. Under normal circumstances, 
Vladimir Putin’s trip to Iran this week 
would be a cause for concern, but with 
the Biden administration in charge, it 
appears it could be just the tip of the 
iceberg because although Russia and 
Iran are competitors, especially in the 
energy sector, they are absolutely 
united in their hatred of the United 
States and in their desire to undermine 
Western interests. 
When they look at the United States, 
they see a country whose President got 
a head start undermining those inter-
ests on day 1 of his administration, and 
you better believe they are ready to 
take advantage of this. They are ready 
for it. This week, look at what they 
have done. You had Gazprom, which is 
the Russian energy giant, and the Na-
tional Iranian Oil Company come to-
gether and announce a $40 billion 
agreement to work together on oil and 
gas development and pipeline construc-
tion. They are reading the writing on 
the wall, and what they see is hesi-
tation from the U.S. President to move 
us back to energy independence, where 
we were on day 1 of his administration, 
so they are making plans as to how 
they will work together and dominate 
the energy sector. 
Meanwhile, Joe Biden has also sold 
about a million barrels of oil from our 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve to the 
Chinese Communist Party. When I 
have spoken with Tennesseans about 
this, they are furious. They cannot un-
derstand why he would make a choice 
to do this. The left has done their best 
to provide cover for the President, 
claiming that a million barrels is real-
ly nothing to worry about, but you 
know it is something to worry about. 
Our SPR has about 750 million barrels 
in it. We are drawing it down at about 
a million barrels a day. Plus, the Presi-
dent is now selling to our adversaries— 
selling it. 
We did a little bit of research into 
what China can get out of a barrel of 
oil, and here is what we found: That 
gives you 20 gallons of gasoline; 121⁄2 
gallons of distillate, which is what we 
use for diesel fuel; and about 31⁄2 gal-
lons of jet fuel. To Tennesseans, this 
makes a big difference. 
I really agree with my fellow Ten-
nesseans about this. When they look at 
this picture and they think about the 
President’s big sale to Hunter Biden’s 
friends in Beijing, they don’t see a gal-
lon of gas here and there. What they 
see is 20 million full tanks of gas. They 
see diesel fuel that our farmers need. 
Right now, with the price of diesel dou-
bling, we have farmers in Tennessee 
who cannot get crops planted. They 
chose not to plant crops because of the 
cost of diesel, fertilizer, chemicals, pes-
ticides. They see sabotage of their 
hopes and their dreams and their 
plans—their plans—for their family, for 
their business, for their farm. 
As I have been out and about around 
the State and talked to Tennesseans, 
they have a message for this President, 
this administration, my Democratic 
colleagues. This is more than just a po-
litical disagreement. In their minds, 
and I agree, this is a national security 
risk—a national security risk. 
We are making ourselves vulnerable. 
Giving any aid or advantage to our ad-
versaries is wrong, and this has got to 
end. Joe Biden and the Democrats 
must abandon this China-first energy 
policy and return to an America-first 
policy. 
Restart the Keystone Pipeline. Ap-
prove more energy infrastructure. Hold 
more lease sales. Approve drilling per-
mits that are waiting for approval. 
Let’s get the regulators out of the 
way. Stall some of these 42 regulations 
that the President has put on the oil 
and energy sector this year. Let’s do 
this. Let’s advantage ourselves with 
American energy before it is too late. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the following 
Senators be permitted to speak prior to 
the scheduled vote. Senator MURPHY 
for up to 15 minutes; Senator CORNYN 
for up to 15 minutes; and Senator 
COONS for up to 3 minutes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ELECTORAL REFORM 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to talk about a piece 
of legislation that was introduced yes-
terday by 16 bipartisan Senators: the 
Electoral Count Reform and Presi-
dential Transition Improvement Act. 
I am proud of the effort between Re-
publicans and Democrats to put aside 
our differences on other issues and to 
be able to put before this body a pro-
posal that will assure that the votes 
that are cast all across this country for 
President in 2024 result in the winner 
of that election sitting in the Oval Of-
fice. 
And I come to the floor today to un-
derscore for my colleagues why this 
piece of legislation is so vitally nec-
essary. 
All across the country, we are seeing 
an epidemic of candidates being nomi-
nated for Governor, for secretary of 
state, for Congress, who don’t believe 
Joe Biden won the 2020 election. 
They instead believe these wild con-
spiracy theories about voting machines 
that magically switched votes from one 
candidate to another, Sharpies that 
voted for Joe Biden illegally. All of it 
has been debunked, but the conspiracy 
theories and the support for this notion 
that Donald Trump actually won the 
election, according to the rules of the 
electoral college in 2020, continue to 
spread. 
The Republican nominee for Gov-
ernor in Pennsylvania, who appoints 
the State’s chief election official, was 
right here at the Capitol, yards away 
from this Chamber on January 6, as in-
dividuals were storming the building 
trying to do harm to us. He took part 
in high-level meetings after the 2020 
election, intended to overturn Biden’s 
win in Pennsylvania. 
He is perhaps mere months away 
from being the next Governor and chief 
elections officer of that State. Across 
the country, former President Trump 
is organizing what he calls an America 
First Secretary of State Coalition, and 
he is pretty unapologetic about what 
the design is. It is to install election 
officers all across the country whose 
chief loyalty is to Donald Trump, not 
the vote. 
His endorsed candidate in Arizona, 
for instance, called for Biden’s win in 
Arizona to be thrown out and for the 
Republican State legislature to appoint 
its own electors instead. 
In Nevada, the endorsed Republican 
candidate for secretary of state, an-
other Trump loyalist, says if he was in 
office in 2020, he would not have cer-
tified Joe Biden’s win, leading to an 
immediate constitutional crisis. 
What is happening all across the 
country right now is a complete, total 
rejection of democracy by Trump sup-
porters and his endorsed candidates. 
Now, they aren’t representative of 
the entire Republican Party, but, un-
fortunately, they are winning pri-
maries all across the country, and they 
are winning elections all across the 
country. 
And these Trump loyalists, they are 
not interested in the winner of an elec-
tion becoming President if that winner 
isn’t Donald Trump. They effectively 
want Donald Trump installed as a mon-
arch, and they are willing to just throw 
out democracy if that is what is nec-
essary to keep their leader in power. 
And as I mentioned, this isn’t some 
fringe phenomenon any longer. I think 
we have a lot of Republicans in the 
Senate and the House who see this dan-
ger coming and want to take steps to 
prevent it. That is why we are intro-
ducing this legislation, but there are 
over 100 winners of Republican pri-
maries for Congress and statewide of-
fice this year who believe—who have 
stated this belief publicly that the 2020 
election was stolen and that Donald 
Trump should still be President. 
There is just a very well-developed 
and well-organized movement, where 
Trump supporters are learning from his 
inability to overturn the election in 
2020, and they are galvanizing them-
selves to leave nothing to chance in 
2024.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3587 
July 21, 2022 
The operation to install Trump in 
the White House in 2025, if he runs, will 
be more sophisticated and better orga-
nized than 2020. The threat that 2024 
will be the last year of American de-
mocracy is real. 
I know that sounds like hyperbole, 
but we came really close to losing our 
democracy in 2020. And if a President is 
installed in the White House who did 
not actually win the election, then I 
don’t know how you claim that this ex-
periment for 250 years is still ongoing. 
So we need to act, as a body, across 
the aisle. Those of us who believe that 
our loyalty to country is more impor-
tant than our loyalty to party need to 
act to make it as hard as possible for a 
group of traitors to install as President 
the loser of the 2024 Presidential elec-
tion. 
And so toward that end, we have in-
troduced a piece of legislation that will 
seek to reform the way in which elec-
tors are sent to Congress and the way 
in which we count those electors to put 
up as many barriers as we can to these 
efforts to install the loser of the 2024 
election as President of the United 
States. 
So I am grateful to Senator COLLINS 
and Senator MANCHIN for leading this 
process. I am grateful to be a part of it, 
along with Senators PORTMAN, SINEMA, 
ROMNEY, SHAHEEN, MURKOWSKI, WAR-
NER, TILLIS, CAPITO, CARDIN, YOUNG, 
COONS, SASSE, and GRAHAM. 
And so let me tell you, in just a few 
minutes, what the most important ele-
ments—let me just tell you about some 
of the key elements of the Electoral 
Count Reform Act. It engages to make 
the selection and counting of fraudu-
lent electors harder by both addressing 
efforts by Congress to overturn valid 
State results but also to make it hard-
er for States to submit to Congress in-
valid State results. 
Now, on January 6 of last year, we 
saw a handful of our colleagues at-
tempt to throw out the valid elector 
slates from States like Pennsylvania 
and Arizona. And, luckily, in the end, 
those efforts only got a handful of 
votes here in the Senate, but the ma-
jority of Republicans voted to throw 
out those slates in the House of Rep-
resentatives, which just tells you how 
mainstream these views have become. 
And so, in two important ways, we 
make that attempt by Congress to 
throw out valid results from a State a 
little bit, but substantially, harder. 
Under our current law, it only takes 
one single Senator in order to throw 
this entire Senate into a debate over 
whether or not we should count or 
throw out certain electors. 
In the end, there were, I think, 12 Re-
publican Senators who suggested we 
should throw out ballots, but really all 
that was needed was 1. So what we do 
is we increase that threshold from 1 
Senator to 20 percent of Senators, from 
1 House Member to 20 percent of House 
Members to begin that debate. Ulti-
mately, you still need a majority of the 
House and the Senate to throw out an 
elector slate, but you can’t even begin 
that debate now without having 20 per-
cent of each body. That is a substantial 
and important change. 
Second, we clarify the role of the 
Vice President. Now, some would argue 
that this isn’t necessary; that the Vice 
President’s role in this process is cere-
monial, but that is not what Donald 
Trump thought. Donald Trump and his 
cadre of fringe lawyers believed, by 
reading a statute in a particular way, 
that Mike Pence had the ability by 
himself to refuse to count certain 
slates of electors. 
Now, that is not how the 1887 Act 
reads, but just to be absolutely clear, 
our reform act clarifies the law to 
make 100 percent clear that the Vice 
President’s role is just ceremonial. 
And then, as I said, we also take 
steps to make it harder for States to 
send fraudulent results to Congress be-
cause that is the primary threat in 
2024. I still think that there are the 
votes in the Senate, no matter what 
the elections look like in 2024, for the 
Senate to make sure that we don’t 
throw out valid results that are sent to 
the Congress. 
The bigger threat is that one can-
didate wins in a State like Arizona or— 
depending on what happens in the gu-
bernatorial election in Pennsylvania— 
Pennsylvania and instead that State 
decides to send electors for the losing 
candidate to Congress, making some 
vague, broad claims of fraud that they 
can’t substantiate. 
So we make that exercise in fraud 
less likely through a number of means. 
First, there is a really ambiguous pro-
vision in the 1887 law which President 
Trump argued in the courts allowed for 
State legislatures to appoint their own 
electors if they judged that the elec-
tion was incomplete. Now, what that 
was initially intended to mean was if 
an election didn’t happen because of a 
natural disaster, but Trump’s lawyers 
thought that that meant that these 
claims of fraud could satisfy that in-
complete criteria. 
Well, we removed that ambiguity in 
this underlying piece of legislation. No 
longer will anybody be able to claim 
that State legislatures can just step in 
after the fact and appoint different 
electors. 
Second, we have a clear prohibition 
that State legislatures can’t change 
the rules of how electors are chosen 
after the election itself. Now, it is up 
to State legislatures as to how they ap-
point electors. 
Every State right now appoints them 
based upon who won the popular vote 
in their State, but the Constitution 
does give that power to the State legis-
lature. It does not give them the power 
to change that process after the voters 
have cast their vote. We make that 
clear in this piece of legislation. 
And then, most importantly, we clar-
ify the process by which campaigns and 
candidates can contest a fraudulent 
certification or a fraudulent appoint-
ment of electors. 
As we saw in the 2000 election, there 
is overlapping contesting jurisdictions 
between States and the Federal court 
system. It often takes very—a very 
long time for those processes to play 
out and unwind. We set up in this bill 
a new expedited process of review by a 
three-judge panel. We limit the cases 
that can be brought to that panel by 
the campaigns themselves, just to 
make sure we aren’t incentivizing spu-
rious litigation. 
But that new process allows the can-
didates and the campaigns, if they be-
lieve that the laws of the State have 
not been upheld in allowing the major-
ity winner of that State to dictate 
what electors get sent to Washington, 
to make that claim before a three- 
judge panel in an expedited fashion, to 
have that case go up to the Supreme 
Court in an expedited manner as well. 
Clarifying the way in which we solve 
for these contests, if they arise over a 
valid slate of electors and an invalid 
slate of electors is an important reform 
in this bill. 
Listen, what we have built over the 
last 250 years in the United States of 
America, it really is a miracle, and we 
should never forget how much of an 
anomaly American democracy is when 
you look at the broad scope of the gov-
ernments under which people have 
lived. 
This idea that citizens, not dictators 
or Kings or plutocrats, get to decide 
who leads a nation—250 years later, it 
is still a revolutionary idea. 
And I remind my constituents all the 
time that democracy is really unnatu-
ral, right? There are not a lot of other 
things that are important to us in our 
lives that we run through democratic 
vote. Our workplaces are really impor-
tant places, but we don’t run our work-
place through democratic vote. The 
boss—the CEO—makes the decisions 
there. 
We love our sports teams, right? We 
follow them. We live and die for them. 
But the decisions on those teams—they 
are not made by democratic vote. 
There is a coach, a general manager 
who makes the decisions. I love my 
kids, but they don’t get an equal vote 
in the decisions of my household with 
my wife and me. Lots of things that 
are important to us in our lives don’t 
run by democratic vote. We are very 
comfortable, in fact, with hierarchal 
systems, with one person or a handful 
of people making decisions for us, but 
we have reserved this idea of democ-
racy for the decisions that are made 
that govern our community, our town, 
our State, or our Nation. 
We need to remember that over the 
course of world history, almost no one 
has lived in a democratic civilization. 
Why? Because it is natural for human 
beings to want their chosen leader to 
be in charge, their preferred leader to 
be in charge, no matter what every-
body else in the community believes. It 
is also natural for leaders, once they 
have tasted power, to want to cling to 
that power and refuse to give it up, no 
matter the wishes of their citizenry.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3588 
July 21, 2022 
So we need to be constantly vigilant 
to protect this experiment. In the 
grand sweep of world history, that is 
what it is—a revolutionary experiment. 
We need to recognize the moments 
when the threats to that experiment 
are new and novel and more grave than 
normal and be nimble enough to re-
spond. 
So I would argue that this is one of 
those moments, and I am so grateful to 
the group of bipartisan Senators who 
have worked so hard to introduce this 
legislation. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
H.R. 4346 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
business before the Senate is a critical 
undertaking to shore up our vulnera-
bility to imported microcircuits, other-
wise known as semiconductors. You 
might wonder why this is so important 
if you haven’t been following the de-
bate over the last couple of years. 
While this legislation has taken 
many names, it began as the CHIPS for 
America Act in June of 2020, which es-
tablished a new program to incentivize 
manufacturers of these tiny microcir-
cuits, known as semiconductors, to set 
up shop here in the United States. 
We have tried to fund the program at 
different times through the Endless 
Frontier Act; the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act, sometimes called 
USICA; the America COMPETES Act; 
the Make It in America Act. But no 
matter what the title is or whatever 
you call it, the purpose is to eliminate 
this unacceptable risk that somehow— 
due to pandemic, due to military con-
flict, due to natural disaster—our ac-
cess to the most advanced semiconduc-
tors on the planet would be cut off, 
with devastating consequences to the 
U.S. economy and our national secu-
rity. 
I know some people wonder, Why 
should the Federal taxpayer provide fi-
nancial incentives to semiconductor 
manufacturing? And that is a perfectly 
good question. The reason is, we are in 
a 
competition 
with 
countries 
all 
around the world that are providing in-
centives to build these necessary and 
essential facilities in their country, 
and if we don’t participate in this com-
petition, we will end up maintaining 
our 
dependency 
entirely 
on 
semi-
conductors imported into the United 
States. We saw big investments being 
made in other countries—China, the 
EU, Germany, France. A number of dif-
ferent countries want this manufac-
turing capability in their country be-
cause they understand its importance 
to their economy and security. 
Now, you might wonder, Why is it 
necessary? Well, there is a reason—an 
economic reason—why these semicon-
ductor manufacturers are almost all 
based in Asia. The overwhelming ma-
jority are made in Taiwan, and that is 
because it costs 30 percent less to build 
these facilities in Asia than it does 
here in the United States. 
But COVID–19 exposed a lot of vul-
nerabilities of supply chains, whether 
it is PPE—personal protective equip-
ment—or semiconductors, and this idea 
that just because somebody could build 
something cheaper somewhere else, 
that checked all the boxes. It does not 
check all the boxes. And there are 
some things we must have access to, 
and one is a secure source of these 
microcircuits that run everything from 
your cell phone to the F–35 Joint 
Strike Fighter. We know that semi-
conductors will get more and more im-
portant as the world competes to come 
up with smaller and more powerful 
semiconductor chips to operate every-
thing from computers to our weapons 
systems. 
When the pandemic hit, the supply 
chain vulnerability was demonstrated 
by empty car lots, backordered elec-
tronics, higher prices, contributing to 
inflation. Consumers who never needed 
to know what a semiconductor was 
found themselves impacted by this dis-
ruption. 
My State is home to companies 
across a full range of industries that 
have been impacted, from consumer 
electronics to defense companies. 
Last spring, an executive from Toy-
ota told me that when he first started 
with the company, he could count the 
number of chips in a given vehicle on 
two hands. That certainly is not the 
case now, with almost autonomous ve-
hicles and certainly with all the sen-
sors that have made driving a lot safer 
and a lot more convenient added to 
new cars. Think about the high-tech 
features in our cars—navigation sys-
tems, Bluetooth, automatic braking, 
backup cameras, and parking sensors. 
That is on top of standard functions 
like power steering, air-conditioning, 
and window wipers. Today, some cars 
use as many as 1,000 semiconductor 
chips. 
So the pandemic of COVID–19 dem-
onstrated our vulnerability to our sup-
ply chains that made getting so many 
semiconductors impossible. 
This wasn’t just a problem for auto-
makers; virtually every industry was 
impacted. In many ways, the global 
chip shortage served as a wake-up 
call—certainly to me and I believe 
other Members of Congress and the 
Senate 
who 
voted 
consistently 
to 
eliminate this vulnerability in our sup-
ply chains. It forced us to recognize the 
vulnerability of that supply chain and 
then to do something about it, which 
we are in the process of doing. 
As bad as the chip-related shortages 
have been in the last 2 years, they pale 
in comparison to what could be coming 
if we don’t act. 
As I said, the vast majority of the 
world’s chips are made in Asia, with 
the bulk coming from Taiwan. Sixty- 
three percent of the advanced semi-
conductors in the world are made in 
Taiwan. Even more concerning is that 
92 percent of the world’s most advanced 
semiconductors come from that coun-
try. So 62 percent—63 percent of semi-
conductors come from Taiwan, but 92 
percent of the most advanced, the most 
powerful, the smallest semiconductors 
come from that same place. None, zero, 
zip, nada are made in America. None. 
Taiwanese 
semiconductor 
firms 
make the chips used in our military’s 
Joint Strike Fighter, the F–35, artifi-
cial intelligence, and other military- 
grade devices. 
Now, if you have been paying atten-
tion to what President Xi and the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China have been say-
ing about Taiwan, they are saying they 
are going to unify the PRC with Tai-
wan either peacefully or by military 
action. 
Again, I believe the risk of pandemic, 
natural disaster, or military interven-
tion makes this risk simply unaccept-
able. 
Last fall, I led a congressional dele-
gation 
to 
visit 
Indochina, 
the 
INDOPACOM area of operations, to 
learn more about the threat of Chinese 
aggression when it comes to Taiwan. 
One of the leaders we met with was the 
commander of the Indo-Pacific Com-
mand, located in Hawaii, who described 
the current power dynamic rather suc-
cinctly. He said it is not a question of 
if China invades Taiwan but when. 
We even have a rough idea of when 
that could happen. President Xi has 
made no secret of his desire to unify 
Taiwan with the mainland, saying he 
wants to be ready to do that by 2027, 
just 5 years from now. But, as we have 
learned 
from 
Putin’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine, when one person makes a de-
cision, you can’t depend on any par-
ticular timeline because it could hap-
pen in the blink of an eye. 
It is tough to overestimate the im-
pact this lack of access to these ad-
vanced semiconductors would have on 
the United States and our allies. To be 
sure, 
our 
cars, 
televisions, 
refrig-
erators, and washing machines would 
be impacted, but that is only the begin-
ning. Those would be mere inconven-
iences. How would we manufacture 
Javelin missiles that are used in 
Ukraine? Well, we couldn’t because 
they all run on semiconductors. There 
is the Stinger that is being used so ef-
fectively by the Ukrainians to go after 
Russian tanks invading Ukraine. The 
Joint Strike Fighter, the F–35, our 
most 
advanced, 
fifth-generation, 
stealth aircraft, is chock-full of semi-
conductors that would be unavailable if 
our access was cut off for some reason. 
Then just think about our critical in-
frastructure. Think about cell towers. 
Think about the energy grid. Where 
would we get the chips that are needed 
for modern farming equipment? Just as 
cars have become more and more auto-
mated, so have tractors and other 
farming equipment. 
What would we do for the chips that 
we need to treat water to make sure it 
is clean and easily available? 
So these aren’t problems just for con-
sumers; it is a major national security 
vulnerability.

which he spoke about the instability of 
the Persian Gulf and Soviet threats to 
the movement of oil through the Strait 
of Hormuz. That was back in the days 
when we depended almost entirely on 
imported oil into the United States. 
But Jimmy Carter said in 1980 that any 
attempt to gain control of the Strait of 
Hormuz and to block access to that es-
sential energy source, he said, would be 
‘‘an assault on the vital interests of 
the United States of America.’’ That 
would be a declaration of war. 
I think the same argument applies to 
semiconductors today. In fact, some 
people have called semiconductors the 
new oil because it is so essential to our 
way of life, to our economy, and our se-
curity. 
Just as the Soviets could have 
blocked the Strait of Hormuz and 
choked off the global oil supply back in 
1980, the People’s Republic of China 
could seize Taiwan’s supply of chips 
and starve the rest of the world. Will 
they go into the ventilators and the 
other lifesaving medical equipment or 
provide homes with clean drinking 
water? These are important questions 
that many of us have been asking and 
looking to try to find ways to mitigate, 
if not to eliminate, our dependency on 
imported semiconductors. 
So funding this program in this bill 
currently before the Senate will shore 
up domestic chip manufacturing to 
make sure that we meet the needs of 
our most critical industries. It would 
deliver economic benefits to our com-
munities through new investments and 
jobs. It will strengthen our national se-
curity by providing chips that can 
make their way into markets around 
the world. It will ensure that we have 
a reliable supply of chips so we can 
outinnovate and outcompete any and 
every adversary, and that is a point 
worth stressing. 
We know we are in competition with 
the People’s Republic of China, but the 
way 
we 
will 
beat 
them 
is 
to 
outcompete them. The only way we 
will do that is with access to the most 
advanced electronics, including semi-
conductors, that are made anywhere on 
the planet, and we need to make them 
here in America so there can be trusted 
supply chains and readily available. 
So I appreciate all of our colleagues 
who supported this legislation for the 
long and winding journey that has 
brought us here today, and I hope this 
bill will pass the Senate and the House 
next week and finally make its way to 
the President’s desk. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Delaware. 
NOMINATION OF REUBEN E. BRIGETY II 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, you and I 
have had the blessing of traveling to 
South Africa together, so I know you 
know, as I do, that it is a critical na-
tion, not just on its own terms as a 
country of 70 million people of a multi-
lingual, multifaith, multiethnic de-
mocracy working to achieve the in-
credible promise enshrined in its Con-
stitution, working to achieve the vi-
sion of a liberation struggle, but it is 
also a country that is critical to re-
gional security and for the path of the 
globe and to the security and stability 
of democracy in this century. This is 
why I stand to speak briefly on behalf 
of my friend, Reuben Brigety, the 
nominee to be our next Ambassador to 
South Africa, whose confirmation we 
will take up in just a few moments. 
Reuben is someone I admire deeply. 
He 
attended 
the 
Naval 
Academy, 
served in the U.S. Navy, was Deputy 
Assistant Secretary of State both for 
African Affairs and for Population, 
Refugees, and Migration. 
I met him as Ambassador to the Afri-
can Union, knew him well as dean of 
the Elliott School at GW. He took on 
the challenge of service as the presi-
dent of the University of the South, 
better known as Sewanee; and now our 
President has nominated him to rep-
resent us in South Africa. 
As we have seen in recent votes and 
actions at the United Nations and in 
discussions and debates around the 
world, African countries—in this mo-
ment, during this war in Ukraine, in 
the face of Russia’s aggression—are 
turning away from us. They are not be-
lieving the reality that it is Russian 
aggression that is causing food scarcity 
and fertilizer prices to spike, and they 
are more than not taking Russia’s side 
on this. 
We cannot take these relationships 
for granted. The United States, for dec-
ades, has been a close development and 
public health partner of South Africa. 
We have to send our best, and Ambas-
sador Brigety is the right person at the 
right time to advance the critical rela-
tionship goals that we have between 
the United States and South Africa. 
TRIBUTE TO ALEXANDRA DAVIS 
Mr. President, one of the blessings of 
serving here in the Senate is getting to 
know natives of New Jersey, like your-
self and like my foreign policy adviser, 
Allie Davis. 
I will do my best to get through 
these next few minutes of remarks 
without being unduly emotional, but 
she deserves a catch in the throat and 
a tear in the eye because Allie is some-
one who from the moment she came to 
join my team 6 years ago has been a re-
markable person—a person of great 
spirit and character, someone who also 
spent time in South Africa as a young 
person. 
After graduating from the University 
of Delaware, a tour as a Fulbright in 
South Africa prepared her to join my 
team as a foreign policy fellow. 
As she was just confessing to me in 
my office a few moments ago, she knew 
far less about governance and politics 
than I imagined. She carries herself 
with remarkable grace and confidence. 
She steadily has risen to be a legisla-
tive aide, a legislative assistant, and 
now my foreign policy adviser. 
I don’t have the time—but I wish I 
did—to detail all the pieces of signifi-
cant and important legislation she has 
helped shepherd through to success. 
She has critically supported my leader-
ship on the State and Foreign Oper-
ations Appropriations team. She has 
been critical as we have worked to ad-
dress this moment of global hunger. 
She has helped get the Global Fragility 
Act from concept to enactment. She 
has helped make the Development Fi-
nance Corporation a powerful tool for 
development. She helped shape and 
craft the Nita M. Lowey Middle East 
Partnership for Peace Act, and she 
nearly single-handedly, at a time when 
I was confident this could not be done, 
got the Sudan Claims Resolution Act 
through this Congress and fundamen-
tally changed the arc of the search for 
democracy in Sudan. 
We had the chance to travel together 
on a Presidential mission to Ethiopia, 
during which she had truly memorable 
encounters with its head of state and 
an opportunity to see and participate 
and help drive diplomacy firsthand. We 
traveled together to so many other 
countries: from the UAE to France to 
Georgia to Italy and, perhaps most 
memorably, to Sudan, where I was hon-
ored to receive one of their leading na-
tional awards, which really was an 
award in recognition of her work on be-
half of the Sudanese people. 
She goes to serve the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, whose chairman I 
accosted last night at an event, and 
said: You are causing great harm to 
me, and I resent deeply the fact that 
you are causing this most talented and 
skilled and trusted member to leave 
the Senate and go to the House. 
But she joins as a member of their 
professional staff, a great team. And I 
know that we will continue to work 
hard and to work closely together in 
the years and decades ahead. A great 
friend, a great colleague, and someone 
to whom I wish great success in the 
many years ahead. 
With that, I urge my colleagues to 
vote in support of the nomination of 
Reuben Brigety to be Ambassador, and 
I offer my greatest thanks to Allie 
Davis for her talented and skillful serv-
ice on behalf of the people of Delaware. 
I yield the floor.

The

Senator 
from 
Con-

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4550 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Mr. President, I 
am honored to appear with a group of 
my colleagues on behalf of the Expand-
ing Access to Family Planning Act. 
We are here to talk about this essen-
tial measure in the post-Roe world. 
That is a phrase I never thought I 
would ever utter anywhere, not to 
mention on the floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate. But we are living in the post-Roe 
world where reproductive rights are 
under assault as never before and crit-
ical reproductive healthcare services 
are more necessary and also are more 
at risk than ever before. That is why a 
consistent, strong source of funding for 
title X Family Planning Programs are 
absolutely critical and urgent. That is 
the purpose of the Expanding Access to 
Family Planning Act. 
What it means for the State of Con-
necticut is, in the past, $2.5 million in 
title X funding, allowing patients, 
mostly women—45,000 of them—critical 
access to comprehensive family plan-
ning and preventive healthcare serv-
ices. What we are talking about here is 
not only family planning but also test-
ing and treatment for sexually trans-
mitted 
diseases, 
lifesaving 
cancer 
screening, and other essential health 
services. And they are all now at risk. 
What they need is the strong and 
consistent source of funding that this 
measure would provide, doubling—lit-
erally, almost doubling the number of 
dollars but also guaranteeing over a 10- 
year period that clinics will receive 
this funding. 
In the State of Connecticut, most of 
this funding in the past has gone to 
Planned Parenthood of Southern New 
England. The Cornell Scott-Hill Health 
Center has received some. They have 
done absolutely extraordinary work in 
delivering health services, particularly 
to women who are uninsured, women 
who are of lower incomes, and women 
who are younger—under 30. And that is 
the primary patient pool that needs 
these services. 
Let me be very blunt. If my Repub-
lican colleagues truly care about sup-
porting families, they can show it by 
supporting this measure and funding 
title X. In the past, since its inception 
50 years ago, it has been bipartisan be-
cause people agree that families ought 
to be a priority, that decisions about 
when and whether to have children are 
the most important that we make, that 
caring for families and particularly 
prenatal care, screening for sexually 
transmitted diseases, cancer screen-
ing—these health services are vital to 
all of us, whether we are the patient or 
not, and that they stay funded in the 
long run. Preventive healthcare is 
pound-wise, and it will save money. 
We know that the Supreme Court’s 
decision in Dobbs strips women of a vi-
tally important freedom and puts it in 
the hands of government bureaucrats: 
the decision about when and whether 
to have children. The least we can do 
now 
is 
to 
fund 
the 
reproductive 
healthcare services that will save lives 
and save futures. 
Dobbs has put women at risk. It has 
put reproductive healthcare in grave 
jeopardy. This measure is necessary to 
mitigate the effects of Dobbs—more 
necessary now than ever before. We 
will never stop fighting for a woman’s 
right to choose when and whether to 
have children. We will never stop fight-
ing to protect a woman’s right to ac-
cess healthcare that is vital to her own 
and her children’s health. 
In the face of mounting attacks on 
women’s health, now is the time to 
strengthen title X, and that is why we 
need this legislation. Passing the Ex-
panding Access to Family Planning 
Act 
will 
strengthen 
our 
entire 
healthcare system. 
It is simply critical for this $500 mil-
lion—providing birth control, cancer 
screening, other kinds of testing and 
treatment—to be passed. And if my Re-
publican colleagues are serious about 
supporting families, they ought to be 
eager to join us. And I am proud to be 
supporting this measure, and I am 
eager to see it signed into law. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the Expanding Ac-
cess to Family Planning Act, which 
will help ensure millions of Americans 
can continue receiving family planning 
services through the title X program. 
For more than 40 years, title X has 
helped ensure hundreds of thousands of 
women—regardless of income, back-
ground, insurance status, or home-
town—have access to basic reproduc-
tive 
healthcare, 
including 
wellness 
exams, cancer screenings, birth con-
trol, and testing and treatment for sex-
ually transmitted diseases. 
While this program, which was cre-
ated with bipartisan support, has been 
around for decades, we have seen what 
happens when MAGA Republicans are 
in control. President Trump slashed 
funding for title X and imposed a dan-
gerous domestic gag rule that banned 
doctors from telling people how they 
could access abortion services. The gag 
rule wreaked havoc across the country. 
It forced providers to decide whether 
they wanted to receive title X fund-
ing—knowing 
that 
healthcare 
pro-
viders wouldn’t be able to provide 
women with accurate and comprehen-
sive information—or say no to this 
critical family planning funding that 
supports women across the country 
through clinics like Planned Parent-
hood and other nonprofits. 
In my home State of Hawaii, the en-
tire network of title X clinics said no 
to this dangerous rule and rejected the 
funding, forcing our State to foot the 
bill. On the other hand, the State of 
Hawaii, the clinics in Hawaii, because 
they rejected this funding, could pro-
vide the full range of care for their cli-
ents, but ultimately the gag rule re-
sulted in a loss of services to thousands 
of women. 
Across the country, Trump’s rule 
slashed title X’s patient capacity in 
half, jeopardizing family planning and 
contraceptive care for 1.6 million pa-
tients 
nationwide. 
While 
President 
Biden reversed this rule, we can’t take 
anything for granted. 
As the rightwing Supreme Court and 
MAGA Republicans work to eliminate 
reproductive freedom, it is critical we 
protect and strengthen title X. That is

exactly what the Expanding Access to 
Family Planning Act will do. This bill 
will nearly double funding for title X 
family planning services by providing 
$500 million in mandatory funding for 
title X for each of the next 10 years. It 
will also ban title X providers from dis-
criminating against patients and re-
quire pregnancy consulting services re-
ceiving title X funds to provide pa-
tients with all of the information 
about all their reproductive care op-
tions, including abortion. 
Republicans have made clear they 
will do anything to get rid of our repro-
ductive freedoms, so we must pass this 
bill to make sure this program isn’t at 
the whim of those trying to strip us of 
our healthcare. While Republicans con-
tinue 
to 
attack 
our 
fundamental 
rights, Democrats are doing everything 
we can to protect them. That is why, in 
addition to this important bill, earlier 
this week, I introduced legislation to 
codify the right to contraception. All 
of this is about who gets to make deci-
sions about our bodies—women or a 
bunch of rightwing politicians. 
I believe—and the American people 
overwhelmingly 
agree—individuals, 
not politicians, should be making these 
deeply personal decisions. 
Our Right to Contraception Act and 
the Expanding Access to Family Plan-
ning Act will help ensure they can. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I want to 
thank my colleague from Hawaii for 
making these very important remarks 
today with respect to expanding access 
to family planning. 
And, Senator HIRONO, let me also, 
while you are on the floor, tell you how 
much I appreciate your leadership on 
the My Body, My Data Act. I am 
thrilled to be, I believe, one of your 
sponsors here in the Senate. It is 
hugely consequential, because we have 
known from even the draft Alito opin-
ion that women were going to have 
their personal data weaponized against 
them. 
I know you have a busy schedule, but 
I just wanted the body to know how ex-
traordinarily important this is, be-
cause when we look at technology and, 
particularly, what technology can do 
today, what your legislation does— 
with our colleague from the House, 
Congresswoman JACOBS—is it gives us 
a chance to get back to the funda-
mental issue of privacy rights. We are 
going to start looking more at the con-
tractual relationships between women 
and various companies because a lot of 
those privacy policies aren’t worth the 
paper they are written on. 
I just want you to know I am so hon-
ored to be your cosponsor on a very re-
lated piece of legislation. Your leader-
ship has made a big difference. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, just very 
briefly. 
Senator WYDEN, I am really glad to 
be able to sponsor the My Bodies, My 
Data bill with you, because, as we 
know, any time any of us presses the 
button and uses our internet, some-
body is collecting data, all of this data. 
And can you imagine there are all of 
these clinics that purportedly provide 
information relating to contraception 
and whatever else relating to reproduc-
tive care—these entities are also col-
lecting all kinds of information. And 
they are not there to make sure that 
women—mainly women but individuals 
who access their services—they do not 
know that these are not institutions 
that will give them all of the informa-
tion they need; but, instead, they are 
collecting a lot of information that can 
be weaponized. 
Thank you very much. This is yet an-
other whole area of concern in this en-
vironment, in this climate, where indi-
viduals do not have control over our 
own bodies. 
Mr. WYDEN. I just say to my col-
league, sometimes it is a little difficult 
to figure out where a piece of legisla-
tion is going. That is not the case with 
your bill. My Body, My Data sums it 
up. 
Again, thank you so much for your 
leadership. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 4550 
Mr. President, I also want to briefly 
touch on the important legislation 
that Senator SMITH—my Pacific North-
west colleague—Senator MURRAY, and 
Senator WARNER have recently intro-
duced. They have an important pro-
posal called the Expanding Access to 
Family Planning Act. I am proud to co-
sponsor this legislation. This is an-
other area where Chair MURRAY and I 
work very closely together because a 
lot of these issues can often involve 
Medicaid, for example. And I just so ap-
preciate my colleague bringing up her 
important bill with respect to family 
planning. 
The proposition behind this is pretty 
straightforward. The Supreme Court 
overturned Roe against the will of the 
American people. States are criminal-
izing abortion. Many women and girls 
are now being forced to carry preg-
nancies to term and give birth. If they 
are going to stand by this forced-birth 
agenda, then you better guarantee 
basic health for women and families. 
That is really Senator MURRAY’s chal-
lenge to Senate Republicans. You can’t 
be pro-life and pro-family if you are 
against healthcare that saves lives and 
protects families. 
The Murray legislation, with Senator 
SMITH
and Senator WARREN—I am 
pleased to be for it today—is centered 
on a significant increase in what is 
known as title X funding, which goes 
to basic essential services like HIV 
tests, contraception, treatment for in-
fections, and pregnancy counseling. 
And one of those services is really so 
vitally important. I just want to men-
tion it, and that is cancer screenings. 
Cancer screenings are a particularly 
important issue now that the Supreme 
Court has overturned Roe. Over the 
last few weeks there have been a wave 
of these horrendous stories, as Senator 
MURRAY
knows better than anyone, 
about the chaos this radical Supreme 
Court ruling has unleashed on women’s 
healthcare—drawn-out 
miscarriages, 
potentially fatal complications left un-
treated, physicians unsure of what 
treatments they are legally allowed to 
perform. 
And we know one of the absolute 
nightmares for women living in forced- 
birth States is getting pregnant and 
having cancer at exactly the same 
time. And the question is: In a world 
where a miscarriage could lead to 
criminal charges, how do you treat a 
pregnant woman with cancer? 
So we ought to think about that. And 
could getting chemo be a crime in a 
forced-birth State, Senator MURRAY? 
In 
forced-birth 
States, 
how 
many 
Americans are going to die because 
they waited too long to begin treat-
ment for breast cancer or cervical can-
cer or because they didn’t maybe get 
treated at all? 
It is appalling that Americans are 
facing this kind of awful, I think, un-
thinkable situation, all because six Re-
publicans on the Supreme Court threw 
50 years of settled law on abortion 
rights into the dustbin. 
In the parlance of the Senate, Sen-
ator MURRAY, I yield to you. I think 
your legislation is extraordinarily im-
portant. 
Uh-oh. I have to reverse some par-
lance of the Senate and yield to Sen-
ator KLOBUCHAR, who also has been a 
champion of this issue. And I just want 
the Senate to know, because we are in 
the Pacific Northwest, we talk about 
these issues. People ought to make no 
mistake about it—Senator MURRAY has 
put years and years into the cause of 
women’s health. And I really enjoy 
being junior partner in the whole effort 
and look forward to her leadership. 
And I yield to Senator KLOBUCHAR. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
thank you so much. I join my col-
leagues. Thank you, Senator WYDEN, 
for your on-point remarks and, of 
course, Senator MURRAY, for her in-
credible leadership, not only of the 
committee but on taking this issue on 
and making clear to the State of Wash-
ington, yes, but also to the country 
that this should be a woman’s decision, 
a woman and her doctor, family’s deci-
sion, and not a decision made by politi-
cians. 
And part of this is making sure there 
is access to family planning. Since this 
decision has come out, I could not be-
lieve the number of women that have 
come up to me at home or in airports, 
flight attendants, saying things like: Is 
this really happening? You mean, I am 
going to have to go to another State 
just to get reproductive healthcare? 
So how about contraception? There 
are people talking about contraception. 
People all over the country have real-
ized how extreme this decision is. And 
one of the people who has been leading

this fight—and, in fact, has been lead-
ing this proposal on expanding access 
to family planning is my colleague 
TINA SMITH. And she is here in spirit 
today. She has a mild case of COVID. I 
know she is watching right now be-
cause she has been fighting for the 
rights of women to make their own de-
cisions about their healthcare her en-
tire life. She is the only Senator in the 
history of the U.S. Senate that actu-
ally worked at Planned Parenthood 
and has a firm understanding and has 
shown so much leadership in this area. 
So we thank her. I am speaking for my 
constituents, of course, to thank TINA 
SMITH for her work and her leadership. 
As I noted, 26 days ago, the Supreme 
Court issued this rule shredding nearly 
five decades of precedent protecting a 
woman’s 
right 
to 
make 
her 
own 
healthcare decisions. Now women are 
at the mercy of a patchwork of State 
laws governing their ability to access 
reproductive care, leaving them with 
fewer rights than their moms and their 
grandmas. 
Last week, Senator MURRAY and I 
joined several of our Democratic col-
leagues, 
including 
Senator 
CORTEZ 
MASTO, who led this bill to preserve a 
woman’s right to travel to other States 
to access reproductive care. Repub-
licans blocked us. So we are back today 
because if the Supreme Court won’t 
protect a woman’s right to make her 
own healthcare decisions, if Congress 
can agree to put the protections of Roe 
v. Wade into law, then everyone in this 
Chamber has to decide whether they 
will protect women’s healthcare or not. 
And that includes making sure women 
have a right to abortion services, but it 
includes having reliable access to fam-
ily planning services. 
Let’s start by passing the Expanding 
Access to Family Planning Act to pro-
tect and expand funding for title X 
clinics, which support maternal health, 
cancer screening, contraception, and 
other essential healthcare. 
In 2020 alone—get this number—1.5 
million Americans received services 
through title X. But currently, Federal 
funding is not enough to serve the 
number of people who need care. And in 
the wake of the Supreme Court’s ruling 
attacking the freedom and the auton-
omy of women, it is likely that there 
will be even more demand in the years 
ahead. That is why Expanding Access 
to Family Planning Act gives title X 
the funding needed to serve women and 
families for the next 10 years. 
This legislation is far from radical. 
The title X program was actually cre-
ated under a Republican administra-
tion. And the original bill passed with 
broad bipartisan support. This is about 
making sure women have a way to take 
care of themselves, especially when 
they are pregnant. 
Right now, I am thinking about all 
the women in this country facing an 
unacceptably 
uncertain 
future. 
We 
should all be able to agree that, at the 
very least, we should make sure that 
they have access to the basic health 
services that title X provides—a provi-
sion that passed during a Republican 
administration, created under a Repub-
lican administration, that understood 
that women should be able to access to 
healthcare. 
There is a better path forward: We 
pass this bill, fund family planning, 
and save women’s lives. I call on my 
colleagues to join me in supporting 
this necessary and completely prag-
matic and sensible legislation for the 
women of this country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want 
to thank my colleagues Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, 
Senator 
WYDEN, 
Senator 
HIRONO, and so many others who have 
been out here speaking on behalf of 
women and their ability to make their 
own healthcare decisions after the dis-
astrous decision from the Supreme 
Court. And it has been now almost a 
month since the Supreme Court over-
turned Roe v. Wade, ended the right to 
abortion, 
and 
really 
upended 
healthcare for women across this coun-
try. 
And every single day, women and 
providers 
and 
patients 
have 
been 
shouting from the rooftops about how 
damaging this is, how women’s lives 
are now at risk. Every single day we 
are seeing the horrors caused by Re-
publicans’ oppression: women forced to 
stay pregnant and give birth when they 
don’t want to; patients denied prescrip-
tions that they need; a 10-year-old 
forced to travel across State lines to 
get an abortion after being raped; a 
woman experiencing a miscarriage left 
bleeding for 10 days as providers were 
not clear if they could treat her due to 
Republicans’ extreme bans. 
And all the while, Republicans have 
been trying to ignore the devastation 
that they have caused. And even more 
cruelly, they have been trying to dis-
tract us, telling us that what we are 
seeing isn’t really happening. They 
have tried to say it won’t undermine 
birth-control access, even as patients 
have been denied Plan B. They have 
tried to say we don’t need to protect 
the right to travel for abortion care, 
even as some Republicans are already 
writing and introducing bills to take 
that right away. 
They have even tried to say their ex-
treme bans won’t undermine care for 
ectopic pregnancies or miscarriages, 
even as providers have already been 
forced to change the standard of care 
because Republicans’ dangerous abor-
tion 
bans 
making 
them 
perform 
riskier, invasive surgeries than would 
otherwise be necessary or even sit on 
their hands until patients’ vital signs 
drop before they can do what is needed 
to save lives. 
It really is unconscionable. And de-
spite what we have heard from Repub-
licans, it is happening right now in this 
country. And I know I am not the only 
one who is entirely unconvinced by Re-
publican words about wanting to sup-
port women and families. 
I am skeptical when one Republican 
Senator said: 
We have to start thinking in terms of some 
of these things . . . to be more supportive of 
families and mothers. 
I am skeptical when another one 
said: 
It’s not just a matter of saying, ‘‘We are 
pro-life.’’ It’s a matter . . . of promoting and 
allowing these people who are making very 
difficult decisions with their lives to make 
sure we can help. 
I was, frankly, surprised when, just 
last week at a hearing that I chaired 
on how this Dobbs decision threatens 
women’s health, the junior Senator 
from Kansas claimed he believes that 
‘‘family planning opportunities need to 
be expanded.’’ He even promised to con-
tinue supporting ‘‘robust funding.’’ 
Here is the chance to match that 
rhetoric with action because Senator 
SMITH and Senator WARREN and I have 
a bill right here that would do exactly 
that. In fact, it is even called the Ex-
panding Access to Family Planning 
Act. I know Senator SMITH cares a lot 
about this. While she can’t be here 
right now due to COVID, I want to 
thank her for her leadership on this 
and explain what this bill does for her. 
This bill is pretty simple. It almost 
couldn’t be simpler. It takes our Na-
tion’s longstanding Family Planning 
Program, title X, and provides the 
strong mandatory funding title X needs 
now to support patients across the 
country. That is it. It is very easy. It is 
very straightforward. 
If Republicans really mean what they 
are saying, if they are really serious 
about expanding access to family plan-
ning, there is no reason why we cannot 
get this done right now. After all, we 
are talking about a program that has a 
long history of bipartisan support. We 
are talking about a program that was 
signed into law by a Republican, Presi-
dent Nixon, way back in 1970. We are 
talking about a program that helps pa-
tients get the birth control they need, 
the STI testing and the treatment they 
count on, the cervical and breast can-
cer screenings that could save their 
lives, and the support they need to plan 
a family on their own terms. 
This isn’t just the popular thing to 
do, although helping patients get the 
birth control they need is an over-
whelmingly popular thing to do; this is 
the right thing to do. Let’s get this 
done. It should not be controversial. It 
simply expands our Nation’s long-
standing Family Planning Program—a 
program, I should note, that we in-
cluded in our bipartisan funding bill 
earlier this year. 
Just a few months ago, some Repub-
licans were adamantly against any in-
creases for this program, but now, as 
we hear, they are changing their tune 
and claiming they do want to support 
families. They do want to expand fam-
ily planning services. They want to do 
exactly what this bill does—unless, of 
course, they don’t mean it, and it is 
simply rhetoric or just another Repub-
lican distraction from the reality that 
has been ushered in.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3593 
July 21, 2022 
Right now, the Republicans will have 
a chance to go on the record on wheth-
er they actually support family plan-
ning, whether they actually want to 
help people get birth control. And be-
lieve me, the same people Republicans 
have been trying to ignore—the same 
people who are having their healthcare 
undermined, their lives upended, their 
controls over their own bodies taken 
away—are going to be watching us 
closely, and they are not going to for-
get how much or how little Repub-
licans’ promises are worth. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions be dis-
charged from further consideration of 
S. 4550 and the Senate proceed to its 
immediate consideration, that the bill 
be considered read a third time and 
passed, and that the motions to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Is there objection? 
Ms. ERNST. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, this bill 
is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. While the 
language touts supporting access to 
family planning, in reality, it is likely 
a $5 billion gift for Planned Parenthood 
and other abortion-related providers. 
Prior to the Trump administration’s 
protect life rule, Planned Parenthood 
received nearly $60 million per year in 
title X funds. The Biden administra-
tion reversed this rule and has aggres-
sively deployed title X funds to abor-
tion providers like Planned Parent-
hood. 
Under this bill, Planned Parenthood 
and other abortion providers would be 
allowed to use the funds to build clin-
ics, and abortion counseling referrals 
would be mandatory. The bill would 
also force religious providers to violate 
their beliefs. Congress should not green 
light family planning dollars at the ex-
pense of family destruction. 
For those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there 
you have it—the real Republican posi-
tion on expanding family planning 
summed up in two simple words: ‘‘I ob-
ject.’’ 
As much as Republicans are talking 
now about supporting women’s health, 
as hard as they might try to pretend 
that they do support family planning 
services, when they have been given a 
chance today to do exactly that—to ex-
pand a program with a long track 
record of helping women get the care 
they need; a long history, I remind all 
of us, of bipartisan support—they stood 
in the way. 
Let’s be clear. The bill that the Re-
publicans blocked today does not fund 
abortion. The truth is, title X only pro-
vides services like birth control, STI 
testing, 
cancer 
screenings—services 
Republicans claim to support. 
We are not proposing anything rad-
ical or groundbreaking; we are simply 
saying we should expand the national 
Family Planning Program that already 
exists, the one President Nixon signed 
into law decades ago, the one we have 
already funded before in a bipartisan 
way many times. 
Title X is a program that is already 
providing 
patients 
family 
planning 
services and contraception, STI testing 
and treatment, screenings for breast 
cancer and cervical cancer, and more. I 
know that because I have met with 
title X providers and patients in my 
home State of Washington many times. 
I would strongly urge my colleagues 
who block this bill to do the same. Lis-
ten to those patients. Listen to the 
doctors. Listen to the nurses in their 
States. This is a program we already 
know helps so many people, and it can 
help more. 
I can’t say I am surprised by Repub-
lican objections today. I can’t say this 
is the first time Republicans have said 
one thing about women’s health and 
done the opposite, and I think we all 
know full well it won’t be the last. 
My message to the American people 
who are witnessing this: Pay attention. 
Pay attention. The Republican agenda 
is no to family planning, no to your 
right to travel for the healthcare you 
need, and no to your constitutional 
right to abortion. 
Senate Democrats and I will not stop 
holding them accountable for empty 
promises or for the devastating harm 
their extreme abortion bans are now 
inflicting on so many patients and fam-
ilies. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
f 
FORMULA ACT 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, for months 
now, American babies have endured an 
unprecedented and prolonged formula 
shortage. Some doctors have called 
this the worst crisis of their careers. It 
has become so widespread that nearly 
everyone knows someone who has been 
personally affected. Desperate parents 
have 
scoured 
online 
marketplaces. 
They reached out to family and friends 
for help. They paid exorbitant markups 
just to feed their babies. In some 
worst-case scenarios, some have even 
resorted to dangerous homemade for-
mulas. In the U.S.A., no parent should 
be left to wonder how they are going to 
feed their newborn baby. 
After months of work and bipartisan 
collaboration with my colleagues in 
the House and the Senate, I rise to pass 
needed reforms that will finally pro-
vide relief to hungry babies. Today, we 
can take action to alleviate a crisis 
largely of the Federal Government’s 
own creation. 
Poor governance has crippled our do-
mestic formula market. Tariffs and 
regulations have prevented safe foreign 
formulas from entering the United 
States, even while we are experiencing 
this acute shortage at home. 
Currently, the government imposes a 
17.5-percent minimum tariff on formula 
imports. This tariff has stifled com-
petition. But it doesn’t have to be that 
way. We can lift these substantial tar-
iffs on the importation of baby for-
mulas and reduce the costs borne by re-
tailers to provide access to safe, afford-
able formula. Doing so will expand the 
severely limited formula options for 
American consumers. This modified 
version of the Formula Act does just 
that by waiving these tariffs through 
the end of this year. 
While passing my bill won’t provide 
immediate relief, our work is far from 
complete. I am committed to doing ev-
erything I can not only to provide this 
relief now but also to make the nec-
essary permanent reforms to our sys-
tem to ensure that a crisis like this 
never arises again. 
We still have work to do, and we 
must further our efforts by allowing 
WIC recipients to buy whatever brand 
of formula might be available. We must 
make meaningful reforms to how the 
FDA regulates the formula industry. 
Passing this bill today is the first step. 
In the meantime, I am actively work-
ing on expanding the list of products to 
receive temporary relief from tariffs. 
While this is an important first step, it 
is certainly not the last. 
This crisis is such that American ba-
bies cannot wait any longer than they 
already have. We have a moral obliga-
tion to these infants to say that we did 
everything we possibly could to fight 
for them. 
Passing the Formula Act will be an 
incredible win for families and hungry 
babies everywhere. It will make mean-
ingful headway that is so desperately 
needed today. By suspending the tariff 
on formula imports, we are providing 
cheaper access to individual consumers 
and to retailers alike. This relief has 
been long overdue and long overdue es-
pecially for Utahns, who have the larg-
est families, the most children per cap-
ita, and the highest birth rate. 
I am grateful for the countless hours 
of behind-the-scenes work and success-
ful negotiations with my colleagues, 
Democrats and Republicans alike, in 
the House and in the Senate, which 
have resulted in a win for our most vul-
nerable Americans—babies. I look for-
ward to continuing this important 
work with them. 
Passing my Formula Act today is a 
victory for families and for babies ev-
erywhere. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of H.R. 8351. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 8351) to amend the Harmonized 
Tariff Schedule of the United States to sus-
pend temporarily rates of duty on imports of 
certain infant formula products, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill.

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. RES. 687 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to fix a troubling loophole in our 
earmark rules. Earmarks are some-
thing I strongly oppose. I believe they 
breed corruption, overspending, waste, 
and abuse. 
There has been bipartisan concern 
about the earmarking process for dec-
ades. In 2007, the process got so out of 
control that even earmarking’s biggest 
supporters decided we needed guard-
rails. 
The Senate passed the Honest Lead-
ership and Open Government Act. The 
bill created Senate standing rule 44, 
which requires the authors of any bill 
considered by the Chamber to do this: 
identify each earmark contained in the 
bill and ensure that the text is publicly 
available at least 48 hours prior to pro-
ceeding to the bill. 
These two protections helped shine 
light on the earmarking process. There 
was significant bipartisan support for 
the protections in rule 44. 
In 2007, on the Senate floor, Senator 
Hillary Clinton said that rule 44 would 
help curb wasteful spending by cre-
ating greater transparency ‘‘in the ear-
mark process.’’ It was nearly unani-
mous, including the two Senators from 
New Hampshire. 
I want to read a portion of her com-
ments. 
I believe we can improve accountability by 
mandating publication of the earmark for a 
minimum period of time prior to any vote on 
the underlying measure, ensuring that both 
other elected officials and the general public 
have the opportunity to scrutinize the spon-
sored outlay. Taking these common-sense 
steps would ensure that legislators are made 
to answer for the spending they cosponsor. 
A quote from Hillary Clinton. I 
couldn’t agree more, in this case. But 
the drafters of Senate rule 44 left some-
thing out. The rule does not apply to 
legislation brought to the floor as an 
amendment from the House. 
This means that a determined major-
ity can ignore the protections offered 
under the rule simply by using a com-
mon procedural mechanism. 
The bill I seek to pass today closes 
this loophole. Senator DURBIN
com-
mented about how important it was 
back then as well. 
Congress should abide by the rules it 
created for itself. We recently saw the 
consequences of this loophole. The Om-
nibus appropriations bill considered in 
March contained nearly 5,000 earmarks, 
totaling nearly $10 billion. The Senate 
passed the bill less than 48 hours after 
receiving the text, in violation of the 
spirit of rule 44. 
As Dr. Tom Coburn used to say in 
this Chamber, earmarks are a ‘‘gate-
way drug.’’ We must close this unin-
tended loophole before the situation 
gets worse. In fiscal year 2010, the last 
year of earmarking before the congres-
sional ban, Congress passed 11,000 ear-
marks at a sum of $32 billion. We can-
not go back there. 
Earmarks give Congress a personal 
incentive to vote for the huge spending 
bills that are dragging America into 
bankruptcy. I talked about it last 
night when I introduced my own budg-
et to try to go the other direction. 
Return of earmarks will mean the re-
turn of earmark scandals and earmark 
corruption 
much 
sooner 
than 
you 
think. Let’s do the minimum to pre-
vent this. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Rules and Administra-
tion be discharged from further consid-
eration and the Senate now proceed to 
S. Res. 687; further, that the resolution 
be agreed to and that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Reserving the right 
to object. 
One of Congress’s most basic jobs is 
the power of the purse. Americans rely 
on this body to provide Federal funds 
for programs that support national de-
fense, small businesses, border de-
fenses, conservation of public lands, 
food assistance for the poor, and so 
much more. 
And as a longstanding member of the 
Appropriations Committee, I am proud 
of the work that the Appropriations 
Committee has done to meet the needs 
of this Nation. And as a senior Senator 
from New Hampshire, when I talk to 
small 
business 
owners, 
educators, 
healthcare professionals, community 
leaders across my State, it is unfortu-
nate that not all of the needs of our 
State are being met. 
And for years, New Hampshire, like 
most small States in this country, has 
received among the lowest apportion-
ments in the country from formula 
grant programs that are administered 
by our Federal Agencies. 
Congress has long used earmarks or 
congressionally directed spending to 
address funding gaps and inequities be-
tween the States. And, in fact, Senator 
Judd Gregg—whom I had the pleasure 
of serving with both when he was Gov-
ernor and I was in the State senate and 
then when he was in the Senate and I 
got elected—was a big supporter of con-
gressionally directed spending because 
he believed, like I do, that I know bet-
ter how money should be spent in New 
Hampshire than a bureaucrat here who 
was making decisions about how to 
spend Federal dollars. 
Congressionally 
directed 
spending 
levels the playing field for States like 
New Hampshire, and even for Indiana, 
to ensure that our communities can 
get their fair share to address our local 
needs. 
Unfortunately, back in 2011, when 
Congress instituted a ban on congres-
sionally directed spending, we ceded 
the power of the purse to unelected of-
ficials in the executive branch. And 
while I know that many of these indi-
viduals are dedicated bureaucrats, they 
are public servants. They don’t nec-
essarily understand the needs of New 
Hampshire in the same way that I do 
as somebody who has represented that 
State for decades. 
So that is why I was very pleased 
that under the leadership of Chairman 
LEAHY and Ranking Member SHELBY, 
Congress once again passed a bipar-
tisan bill to include congressionally di-
rected spending in our budget process. 
And when we did that, the Appropria-
tions 
Committee 
instituted 
some 
major reforms to improve account-
ability and transparency in the process 
of congressionally directed spending. 
I am going to talk about some of 
those reforms because while I appre-
ciate the perspective of my colleague 
from Indiana, I think he has not point-
ed out the reforms that exist in the 
process 
of 
congressionally 
directed 
spending. 
First of all, Members are required to 
certify that neither we nor any mem-
ber of our immediate family would fi-
nancially benefit from the requests 
that are made. Secondly, those con-
gressionally directed spending requests 
have to be made in writing and posted 
online by the Member and the Appro-
priations Committee so that the public 
has every opportunity to view the 
name and location of the project, the 
intended recipient, and the purposes of 
that request. For example, the requests 
for fiscal year 2023 are available online 
right now before they would be avail-
able if this government, this adminis-
tration, were determining how to spend 
that money. 
So the Senator from Indiana doesn’t 
have to wait until those Senate bills 
are posted to inspect congressionally 
directed spending projects. 
The reforms also include a 1-percent 
cap on discretionary spending for CDS 
items and a ban on congressionally di-
rected spending items to for-profit en-
tities. 
Finally, the Appropriations Com-
mittee requires the Government Ac-
countability Office to audit a sample of 
enacted 
congressionally 
directed 
spending items to ensure that Congress 
is being held accountable for these 
projects. 
The chair and ranking member insti-
tuted these reforms to restore the trust 
of the American people in the appro-
priations process, and I believe it is

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3595 
July 21, 2022 
working. And I can tell you, as I travel 
around New Hampshire, it is one of the 
things that I hear from people in our 
communities that they are interested 
in. 
They want to know about the appro-
priations process, and they want to 
know what other opportunities are 
there to support initiatives that may 
not fit within some grant program, 
that they may not be able to raise 
money in the private sector for but 
that are very important for our com-
munities. 
The resolution sponsored by the Sen-
ator from Indiana would require the 
chair of the Senate Appropriations 
Committee to certify that not just 
Senate earmarks have been disclosed 
but that all House earmarks have been 
disclosed. 
I think that bill is a solution in 
search of a problem. The House already 
has its own rule that governs congres-
sionally directed spending items, and it 
is required to identify these items. 
It knows what its Members have re-
quested, and it is responsible for dis-
closing them. Requiring the Senate to 
confirm that the House has done its job 
before we can consider a message from 
the House is unnecessary, and it could 
stop consideration of appropriations 
bills before they ever get here. 
The resolution sponsored by my col-
league from Indiana would change Sen-
ate rule 44 in ways that could have un-
intended consequences and could delay 
critical funding for projects that are 
important in my home State of New 
Hampshire and in so many States 
across this country. 
So given all of those concerns, I ob-
ject. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, with all 
due respect to the Senator from New 
Hampshire, Senator SHAHEEN, back in 
2007, both New Hampshire Senators 
Gregg and Sununu as well as all 98 Sen-
ators who voted back then I think in-
tended not only for the letter of the 
law but they wanted the spirit of the 
law to be aligned with it. 
We now have a new way, something 
that can come over here that violates a 
standing rule of the Senate. I am 
guessing it will probably be used again 
down the road where we have to get 
something, we have no time to look at 
it. I think the spirit of the law would 
say that we need the 48 hours and the 
ability to know who is on it and who 
isn’t. 
And then in the bigger picture, I 
would 
ask 
this 
question—and 
the 
American public ought to listen, ask it 
themselves—is this place getting more 
responsible or are we giving better 
value to you? Do we budget? Do we use 
regular order? And most importantly, 
are we creating more and more deficit 
and more and more debt? 
We know what the answer is. I talked 
about it for 15 minutes yesterday 
evening. We are doing everything we 
can to avoid the rules, pay attention to 
the spirit of the law. And in what we 
are delivering, it is a product I think 
that shows less and less responsibility 
out of a body that should not be mak-
ing rules that make it easier to run 
deficits and go into debt. It ought to be 
the opposite. 
And if we don’t, I think future gen-
erations will hold us accountable for 
the things that we seem to do best, 
which are the gimmicks to get around 
budgeting, avoiding the rules on a

UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that at 1:45 p.m., 
the Senate proceed to executive session 
and the Senate immediately vote on 
confirmation of Executive Calendar 
No. 902, the nomination of Shereef 
Elnahal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF SHEREEF M. ELNAHAL 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, look, 
now more than ever, the Department of 
Veterans Affairs needs a steady hand 
to guide the Veterans Health Adminis-
tration. This is the Nation’s largest in-
tegrated healthcare system, and its job 
is to deliver quality and timely care to 
our veterans. 
I rise today because in about 15 min-
utes, we are going to vote on the con-
firmation of Dr. Shereef Elnahal to run 
the Veterans Health Administration. 
He has an impressive record of leading 
healthcare systems and health agen-
cies. Most recently, Dr. Elnahal served 
as president and CEO of University 
Hospital in Newark, NJ, and, previous 
to that, New Jersey’s 21st health com-
missioner. But more importantly than 
that, Dr. Elnahal is committed to car-
ing for the more than 9 million vet-
erans in VA’s care—a commitment he 
carried out as Assistant Deputy Under 
Secretary for Health for Quality, Safe-
ty, and Value at the Department. 
It 
is 
no 
secret 
that 
VHA 
and 
healthcare systems and providers are 
going through a challenging time. The 
VA continues to battle the impacts of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, with veterans’ 
cases and hospitalizations and deaths 
on the rise again. And VA staff are 
dealing with burnout and increased 
turnover. 
In the past, this body has been able 
to rise above politics to install quali-
fied individuals at the VA responsible 
for getting vets the healthcare and 
benefits they need today. 
This is also very, very important be-
cause the VA is in the process of put-
ting in an electronic health record. It 
is going to be transformational—not 
only for the VA, but once it is done, it 
is going to be transformational for the 
country, but we have to get it done in 
the VA first. There have been some 
challenges. We need somebody with a 
steady hand helping meet those chal-
lenges. Dr. Elnahal is that person. 
Today, in about 121⁄2
minutes, we 
need to act to confirm Dr. Elnahal as 
the VA’s next Under Secretary for 
Health, and I would encourage every-
body in this body to vote for him, get 
him in, hold him accountable, and 
make sure that we are living up to the 
promises we have made to our veterans 
for the healthcare they have earned. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant executive clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I would 
ask that all time be yielded back and 
that we start the vote immediately on 
Dr. Elnahal. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

July 21, 2022 
our Alaskan of the Week series. We 
have been doing this for, geez, 6 years 
now, I think. 
For the new pages, this is usually 
kind of the signal of the end of the 
week but also some really cool stories 
about Alaska. We know it is your fa-
vorite. 
We think some of the reporters in 
town like it because it signals kind of 
the end of the week for them. But I 
want to talk about, first, what is kind 
of going on in Alaska. Right now, the 
sun is high in the sky through much of 
the day. Some places up north are get-
ting 24 hours of sunlight; midnight sun, 
we call it. 
In Anchorage, we are getting about 
18 hours, but that starts to decline real 
quick. But even when the sun sets, it is 
more of a twilight look than real night. 
So you have got to come up and visit; 
you will love it. It has been pretty 
rainy in parts of the State. We needed 
that rain. 
But it can’t dampen the magnificent 
grandeur of Alaska. So, again, if you 
are watching on TV, you want to come 
up, have the vacation of a lifetime, do 
it. The fish are running. We are having 
a banner year for sockeye salmon. The 
rivers all across the State are choked 
with them. 
Last weekend, actually, I partook at 
a particular unique Alaskan tradition 
with my wife and a couple buddies of 
mine. We went dipnetting—dipnetting. 
That is on the Kenai River. That is ac-
tually when there is so much fish you 
actually put a pole with a net at the 
end, and you just put it in the water— 
boom. You just start to catch them. 
And you know, people go, Well, can 
you tell if there is a fish in your net? 
I am like, Oh, yeah, you can tell. 
So my wife and I and our friends, we 
caught 36 beautiful sockeye salmon 
yesterday—or last weekend, about 5 
hours of fishing. It was great. We just 
loved it. 
So fishing, hunting, feeding our fami-
lies from our land and waters is a big 
part of our life in Alaska. These tradi-
tions bind us. They keep us together as 
a State, as a community, as families. 
Our longstanding businesses are also 
part of the fabric of our State, particu-
larly the ones that have grown up with 
our State. When the State’s done well, 
they have done well. When the State 
struggled, they struggled; but they 
have hung in there. And we want to 
celebrate these businesses and the fam-
ilies that have run them. 
And the great Alaskan we are hon-
oring today as our Alaskan of the week 
is Betsy Lawer. And she is part of an 
amazing family in an amazing business 
in Alaska—First National Bank of 
Alaska, which this year is celebrating 
its 100th anniversary. 
So it started in 1922. This amazing fi-
nancial institution has been part of the 
landscape of Alaska—good times, dif-
ficult times—for 100 years. Betsy has 
been at the helm, a strong, sturdy force 
helping to guide this incredible busi-
ness and, by extension, other busi-
nesses and communities throughout 
the State, part of her family tradi-
tion—the Cuddy family—for 100 years. 
So let’s talk about Betsy and the 
family. She is the president of the 
First National Bank of Alaska and also 
part of a really impressive family that 
has run this bank for decades in Alas-
ka. 
So here is the beginning: Literally 
with a vault full of gold nuggets and 
untanned animal pelts, that was their 
original deposits. In 1922, First Na-
tional was founded then in what was 
part of the rough-and-tumble tent city 
of Anchorage. Anchorage was referred 
to as a tent city. 
In 1930, the patriarch of the Cuddy 
family, Warren Cuddy, began buying 
stock in the bank. By 1941, he pur-
chased controlling interest, and War-
ren became the bank’s president. Then, 
one of his sons, at that time, joined the 
bank’s board—this is Dan Cuddy, the 
legendary Dan Cuddy, Betsy’s dad. His 
service was remarkable. First, I would 
like to talk briefly about Dan Cuddy’s 
service as an Alaskan veteran in World 
War II. 
He served as a captain in the 1255th 
Engineer Combat Battalion, which was 
attached to General George Patton’s 
Third Army. Dan fought in the Battle 
of the Bulge in Luxembourg and was 
one of the troops who assisted in the 
discovery and then closing of the Bu-
chenwald concentration camp. This is 
an American hero. 
And, by the way, throughout his en-
tire career, I was so honored to meet 
with Dan Cuddy before he passed away 
in 2015. Throughout his incredible ca-
reer, one thing he talked a lot about 
was the unspeakable atrocities that he 
saw in World War II, so it would never 
happen again. 
So Dan Cuddy comes back from 
World War II—warrior patriot, war 
hero. He becomes a lawyer, and in 1951, 
he becomes the bank president. And 
the Cuddy family’s involvement, again, 
throughout our State is legendary. 
The bank thrived after that under 
Dan’s leadership. It grew with the 
State. It helped Alaskans rebuild after 
the huge 1964 earthquake. 
By the way, do you want to read 
about a huge earthquake? It was 9.2 on 
the Richter scale, one of the biggest 
earthquakes 
ever 
recorded. 
It 
de-
stroyed cities, tsunamis. It lasted al-
most 5 minutes. Think about that, sit-
ting through an earthquake for 5 min-
utes. 
And the bank the whole time kept 
supporting communities, and it con-
tinues to do that. It was among the 
first in the Nation to distribute check 
image statements to its customers in 
the 1990s. The only bank in America to 
welcome dog mushers through drive- 
throughs. Yes, think about that image. 
And it is probably certainly the only 
bank in America that has a branch 
that is bilingual both in English and 
Yupik. That is the branch in Bethel, 1 
of 19 branches across America. 
First National Bank of Alaska—100 
years of service—has received so many 
accolades and awards, including being 
named one of the top banks in Amer-
ica, and it was recognized in 2013 as one 
of America’s most trustworthy compa-
nies by Forbes magazine. 
You can see the Cuddy family integ-
rity in this institution. But the most 
important thing about First National 
Bank of Alaska’s mission statement is 
that it is what drives the bank: Success 
depends on taking care of the commu-
nity, employees, and customers. If the 
community isn’t strong, businesses 
won’t be strong, the bank won’t be 
strong. 
So, Betsy, one of Dan and Betti’s six 
children, was raised on those tenets 
that I just talked about. She saw how 
they worked firsthand. 
On Saturdays, she would join her fa-
ther Dan while he went on his outings 
visiting customers. Sometimes those 
visits happened in Anchorage, where 
she would politely listen to business 
being discussed and then grab a late 
breakfast at Peggy’s, a mainstay in 
Anchorage. 
Sometimes 
they 
would 
jump into a prop plane and head out to 
rural Alaska, where she learned so 
much about that part of our great 
State. 
Betsy said she loved those visits and 
she learned, in the ways that children 
do, that helping people realize their 
hopes and their dreams is what her fa-
ther did, what their business did, and 
why it was so important to so many 
Alaskan communities. 
Jump forward to September 10, 1969. 
Betsy was a college student at Duke, 
spending her summers, as she always 
did, working at the bank as a secretary 
at the bank. 
Just down the street from First Na-
tional in downtown Anchorage, the 
Prudhoe Bay oil lease sale was under-
way. This is the giant oilfield in Alas-
ka—oil and gasfield. The first big lease 
sale by the State. It was a huge event 
for our Nation, huge event for Alaska. 
Back then, the country needed Alas-
ka oil and gas, just like today our 
country needs Alaska oil and gas. 
On that day in September 1969, Betsy 
remembers looking out the window of 
the bank. She said the streets were 
completely empty, like the ‘‘Twilight 
Zone.’’ Everybody was huddled in front 
of their radios, listening to the lease 
sale that would change Alaska and, in 
many ways, America forever. 
First National Bank of Alaska—the 
Cuddy family’s bank where she was 
working, her dad was president then— 
was assisting Bank of America on the 
lease sale. 
After the sale, get this image, Betsy 
got a ride back to the east coast on a 
jet with bank executives headed to New 
York to directly deposit the $900 mil-
lion check that was made out to the 
State of Alaska—that is about 7 billion 
in today’s money—that got our State 
up and moving. She was on that plane 
depositing that money. Imagine the ex-
citement that she felt then. 
The first thing Betsy did after that 
when she got back to Duke was to

change majors from interior design to 
economics, which was probably a good 
move for a future bank president. 
Two years later—she didn’t even wait 
for her graduation ceremony—she came 
back to Alaska and immediately got to 
work. Now, because management pro-
grams back then were mostly for men, 
Betsy started from the bottom up— 
teller, clerk, secretary—which she said 
later in life gave her an advantage 
when she began processing loans for 
the bank because she knew exactly how 
it all worked and the people at every 
level in that bank. She knew the bones 
of the bank and the banking industry. 
Throughout the years, as the bank 
has grown, our Alaskan of the Week, 
Betsy, has grown with it. She became 
president of the bank in 2013, CEO in 
2018, and she is also the board presi-
dent. 
She is a mother, a wife, an active 
member of the community. She is a 
great community banker, and I will 
tell you this. During the pandemic, 
there was no financial institution that 
was more dedicated to getting the PPP 
loans out to small businesses in Alaska 
than First National Bank of Alaska 
and Betsy Lawer. They did an incred-
ible job. 
Betsy helps people in our State real-
ize their hopes and dreams, and for 
Betsy, it all comes down to having a 
deep understanding and caring for the 
community—the 
many 
communities 
that they serve. ‘‘You can’t automate 
those relationships,’’ she said. 
So I want to thank Betsy, the Cuddy 
family, congratulate the First National 
Bank of Alaska—100 years of service to 
our great State, what an amazing 
record. And I want to congratulate 
Betsy on perhaps one of her most pres-
tigious awards ever: being Alaskan of 
the Week. 
CHIPS ACT OF 2022 
Madam President, we have been dis-
cussing on the Senate floor the USICA 
bill, the America Competes bill, the 
bill that is supposed to focus on our 
ability to outcompete the Chinese com-
munist economy, and I can think of 
very little legislation more important 
than this. 
This is an issue that since I arrived 
in the Senate in 2015, I started talking 
about the importance of a broad-based 
strategy as it relates to China and 
outcompeting China and recognizing 
that they don’t play fair, that they 
steal, that they subsidize, that they co-
erce, and yet they are a huge entity in 
the global economy so we need a strat-
egy to deal with them. 
And this bill that we are now debat-
ing on the Senate floor, the U.S. Inno-
vation and Competition Act of 2021, 
USICA is something that I, with a 
number of other Senators, have worked 
hard on for literally over the last year 
and a half, and I want to thank a num-
ber of Senators who have put their 
heart and soul into this legislation, 
commend them: Senators YOUNG, SCHU-
MER, WICKER, CANTWELL, WARNER, COR-
NYN. 
This is important legislation. As I 
mentioned, I have supported it and its 
Senate iterations when we passed it 
out of the Senate, out of committee in 
the Commerce Committee, but I have 
concerns. I have concerns, and I am 
going to mention a few of them briefly 
and then one concern that permeates 
so much of what has been happening 
here in the U.S. Senate over the last 
year and a half that is really important 
to me and my constituents. And I am 
asking 
my 
Senate 
colleagues—my 
Democratic Senate colleagues—to help 
me on something that I don’t think a 
lot of them maybe even know that they 
are doing, but let me get to the con-
cerns. 
First, on the chips provision—this 
isn’t a concern. This is what Senator 
WARNER, Senator CORNYN, and many 
others have focused on—really impor-
tant to shore up semiconductor manu-
facturing in America. 
Now, look, my State, unfortunately, 
is not one that is competing right now 
hard for a big fabrication plant. I un-
derstand that. We have other assets 
like energy I am going to talk about 
here in a minute, but wherever this 
government support for the chips in-
dustry is going to go in America, I 
think it is really important because 
this industry is like energy. It is so im-
portant to America, and we can’t let 
China outcompete us in that area. 
But let me talk about a couple con-
cerns. First, on energy, one of the big-
gest areas that we can compete against 
China that they are scared about com-
peting with us is our incredible natural 
resources, ‘‘all of the above’’ resources, 
all of our energy. 
If you read the intel and you see 
what China’s leadership is worried 
about, one thing they are worried 
about is American energy dominance. 
So I have worked hard on this legis-
lation for a year and a half to make 
sure that when we are looking at re-
search—advanced research that this 
legislation is going to fund—it needs to 
include all energy. 
It has been a struggle, I will admit. 
Some of my Democratic colleagues, 
certainly the Biden administration, 
have this thing where they don’t like 
certain areas of energy—oil and gas in 
particular. They have targeted it. They 
want to put it out of business. It makes 
no sense. It is probably the biggest 
strategic blunder of the Biden adminis-
tration across so many areas—tar-
geting 
and 
unilaterally 
disarming 
American energy, when it is one of our 
greatest comparative advantages. 
Unfortunately, some of the language 
coming back over from the House con-
tinues this trend, and I am very con-
cerned that we would have a bill that 
could give Federal bureaucrats the op-
portunity to continue to target Amer-
ican energy, as opposed to help bolster 
it in our competition with China. 
So that is one concern. It wasn’t in 
the Senate bill. I made sure of that. 
But now after some of the far-left 
Members in the House got to put lan-
guage in that came back over here, it 
is a concern, and it should concern 
every single American, every single 
Senator. 
We need all of our strengths to com-
pete with China, and to not use the 
strength of American energy—‘‘all of 
the above’’ energy—is nuts. Hopefully, 
this administration is waking up to 
that, but it hasn’t been a great record 
at all in terms of that. 
There is another provision, some-
thing that built on a provision that I 
tried to get that I did get in the origi-
nal USICA bill that Senator PORTMAN 
has now put forward with Democrats 
and Republicans, a provision to make 
sure that all of these Federal dollars 
that are going to be in this bill do not 
go to Chinese researchers working in 
our facilities—in research facilities, in 
university facilities—and then take 
them back to China. 
At a recent hearing, FBI Director 
Wray said this is one of the biggest 
threats our country faces, the counter-
intelligence perspective with regard to 
the Chinese Communist Party. He said: 
They are targeting our innovation, our 
trade secrets, our intellectual property on a 
scale that’s unprecedented in history. 
So if we are going to spend all these 
Federal dollars on American research 
at American research institutions and 
American universities, we need strong 
guardrails to make sure it doesn’t fall 
into Chinese hands. 
Senator PORTMAN has done a great 
job on this. It is a commonsense 
amendment. Apparently, some have 
had concerns that this amendment 
would be ‘‘racist.’’ That is ridiculous. 
We need to prevent China from stealing 
our intellectual property. Period. It is 
not racist; it is common sense. I hope 
we can make sure that amendment 
gets in. 
But I want to go into a little detail 
on the final issue that I have with this 
bill. And to be honest, it is kind of 
shocking that a bill focused on com-
peting with China—once again, from 
the Democratic side of the Senate or 
the House, I don’t know where it comes 
from—has provisions that actually tar-
get in a negative way Alaska Natives. 
OK? 
This is an issue that, to be honest, I 
am kind of flabbergasted. It comes up 
everywhere. It is discrimination. It is 
racial discrimination—good old-fash-
ioned 
racial 
discrimination—that 
I 
thought we tried to get rid of in this 
country a long time ago, and it keeps 
popping up. 
I am tired of it, and, remarkably, it 
popped up in the bill that competes 
against China. So I am sure a lot of 
you are saying: Well, jeez, how did that 
happen? I want to explain because I 
really want my colleagues, many of 
whom I am convinced have no idea 
what is going on, to understand what is 
happening. And it happens again and 
again, and to be honest, it shouldn’t. 
I hope some people in our media fi-
nally write about this. I think it is 
shameful.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3599 
July 21, 2022 
But I am going to explain it here 
right now. Here is the issue. In Alaska, 
we have a very big indigenous popu-
lation—wonderful 
people, 
incredible 
people, amazing people. It is almost 20 
percent of the population of my State. 
They bring culture, heritage, values. 
By the way, they have been there for 
tens of thousands of years. This is real-
ly important to me and to Senator 
MURKOWSKI. Congress—Congress, not 
the Native people, the Congress of the 
United 
States—over 
the 
course 
of 
many years, essentially, has classi-
fied—we in the U.S. Senate have classi-
fied—Alaska Natives into two broad 
categories. There are Tribal members, 
which is this circle here, and there are 
members of Alaska Native Corpora-
tions. They are in this circle here. 
Now, a lot of the indigenous people of 
Alaska are both Tribal members and an 
ANC members. Some are not both. 
Some are just Tribal members. Some 
are ANC members. 
But we are talking about tens of 
thousands of indigenous people. So 
whenever we work on legislation that 
benefits the Alaska Native people—but 
American Indians, writ large—what we 
always try to do is say: Remember, 
Congress did this. The Native people 
didn’t do this. So let’s make sure that 
we cover everybody. Let’s make sure 
everybody is included. You wouldn’t 
want to discriminate against one of 
these groups. They are all indigenous 
people. 
So that is what me, Senator MUR-
KOWSKI, Ted Stevens—every Senator, 
every great Congressman, our great 
Congressman Don Young, whom we 
just lost—we have been doing that for 
decades. 
All of a sudden this has become con-
troversial to some Members, to some 
groups. This group, the ANC members, 
these are indigenous people of Alaska 
designated as ANC members, not by 
themselves but by the Congress, OK? 
So here is what happened. Here is the 
beginning. It is sad, and I am going to 
talk about it. It shouldn’t happen, and 
I really want my Democratic col-
leagues to help me stop this because if 
you put another minority group in and 
talked about what is happening to the 
Native people of Alaska, people would 
be shocked. The New York Times and 
the Washington Post would write front 
pages stories about official discrimina-
tion by the U.S. Senate against a mi-
nority population. But for whatever 
reason, it seems to be OK to do it 
against Alaska Natives. But it is not 
OK. 
Here is what happened. In the CARES 
Act we had this historic funding, $8 bil-
lion for the Native people of America. 
We wrote a definition. I was very in-
volved with it. Everybody cleared on 
it—Indian Affairs, majority, minority. 
That included all indigenous people of 
Alaska—OK, just like we include all in-
digenous people of Nevada and New 
Mexico. We wanted to cover with $8 bil-
lion in the CARES Act the very vulner-
able populations, all the Native people. 
Unfortunately—unfortunately—as 
opposed to being viewed as $8 billion, 
the biggest historic investment in In-
dian communities in history, there was 
a dispute, and certain groups said: Hey, 
we got this $8 billion, but we don’t 
want this group to get anything. We 
don’t want this group, ANC members, 
to get any of that $8 billion. 
Remarkably, the majority leader in a 
tweet attacked the Assistant Secretary 
of the Interior, an Alaska Native 
woman of impeccable integrity, saying 
somehow that these members getting 
any of that money was corrupt. Of 
course, that was ridiculous. One of the 
Senate Democrats here, Senator Udall, 
launched an investigation of this in-
credible Assistant Secretary of the In-
terior, an Alaska Native woman, on 
this charge. It was refuted. It was ri-
diculous. It was sad. 
By the way, Senator Udall apologized 
to her. Our Ambassador to New Zea-
land right now apologized to this in-
credible Alaska Native woman, saying: 
Do you know what? That was probably 
really bad. I am sorry. 
It was bad. 
So what happened is that you had a 
group saying: Let’s exclude this group 
of tens of thousands of Alaska Natives 
from getting any CARES money. 
Well, look, we wrote the language. 
We knew that the language was inclu-
sive of everybody. So that, unfortu-
nately, went all the way to the U.S. 
Supreme Court. The Trump adminis-
tration and, to its credit, the Biden ad-
ministration said: No, the language of 
the CARES Act included all Alaska Na-
tives. Why would we discriminate one 
against the other? 
So we won that. That was the way it 
was written. I had a lot to do with 
writing it. So I know. But that is just 
fair. OK, so that is what happened. 
So then my Democratic colleagues 
write the American Recovery Act. The 
$2 trillion relief package, with $20 bil-
lion for American Tribes. But do you 
know what came out of that package? 
Express language written by my Demo-
cratic colleagues saying that of the $20 
billion, every Native group in America 
gets some of that money, but this 
group—tens of thousands of ANC mem-
bers in Alaska—we are going to make 
sure they don’t get any of that. 
That happened, right here on the 
Senate floor. I have no idea why. 
Let me just pose a counterfactual. 
Imagine you had Congress say there 
are two groups of minorities. Let’s say 
not two groups but Asian American mi-
norities in New York, group A, group 
B—Congress 
categorized 
them, 
not 
themselves—or 
African 
Americans, 
group A, group B; or Hispanic Ameri-
cans, group A, group B, in the State of 
New York—just in the State of New 
York. And a Republican Congress said 
we are going to do a giant relief pack-
age for that minority group across the 
country. But, group B in New York, we 
are going to expressly exclude you 
from getting any money. 
What would you call that? 
I would call that good old-fashioned 
racial discrimination. 
If that happened, if a Republican 
Congress did that, to say a group of Af-
rican Americans or Hispanic Ameri-
cans or Asian Americans, the New 
York Times and the Washington Post 
would be going crazy—rightfully so, by 
the way. 
This happened. This happened. 
OK, I don’t know why. I would love it 
if one of my Senate colleagues came 
down and said: Hey, Dan, here is why 
we went to great lengths to exclude 
tens of thousands of Alaska Native in-
digenous people from getting relief. 
Here is why we did that to you. 
I would love for somebody to tell me 
that. 
They haven’t. 
I think it is wrong. I think most peo-
ple who know about it probably would 
be like: Jeez, I didn’t know we had $20 
billion for Tribes, but we specifically 
excluded this group. Was it because we 
were mad about the Supreme Court 
case? 
I don’t know. But here is the thing. 
Back to the USICA bill, there is a lot 
of money going to universities. 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I am 
wondering if my colleague would yield 
for 1 minute. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. I am finishing up. So 
I am not going to yield. It is important 
to me, to my colleague from Maryland. 
There is a lot of money going to uni-
versities. 
This is really important to me, and I 
have been wanting to give this speech 
for a long time. 
There is a lot of money going to in-
stitutions for research to compete 
against China. There are specific provi-
sions that say: Hey, there is going to be 
money that goes to Native American 
groups. That is great. They have a lot 
to bring to this battle with China. 
But that provision that came over 
from the House—guess what it did. It 
said: Not to this group. Not to this 
group. 
So do you see where I am going with 
this? 
I have no idea why Democrats in the 
House and Senate want to keep tar-
geting this group of indigenous people. 
Imagine if Republicans did this to a 
minority group in Maryland or New 
York. 
But it is happening, and it is hap-
pening even in this bill. So that is an-
other big concern I have of this bill, 
this continuation of—I have no idea. I 
would love it for someone to come 
down and say: Hey, Dan, here is why we 
discriminate against tens of thousands 
of indigenous people in your State. 
But it is happening. I sure hope my 
colleagues listen to this. Maybe the 
New York Times or the Washington 
Post would write about it once. 
But just a ceasefire—when we are 
trying to help Native people in Amer-
ica, in Alaska we want to help them 
all. Remember, this is how Congress 
set up these groups, not the people. So 
all I ask is let’s kind of do what we did

going to scrub every piece of darn leg-
islation that comes out of here, and we

Wrong. It is inexplicable, and it is

ELECTORAL COUNT ACT WORKING 
GROUP 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, for 
the past 6 months, I have been pleased 
to work with a bipartisan working 
group of about a dozen Senators for po-
tential reforms of the Electoral Count 
Act and some related matters. I par-
ticularly want to thank our leaders of 
that bipartisan group, Senators COL-
LINS and MANCHIN, for organizing the 
group, keeping us focused on getting 
results, and leading to a process that 
has resulted in a positive outcome. 
This week, we are unveiling our pro-
posed legislation. Our legislation, the 
Electoral Count Reform and Presi-
dential Transition Improvement Act of 
2022 will reform and modernize the 
badly outdated 1887 ECA. In 1887, the 
Electoral Count Act was passed. It is in 
bad need of reform. 
On July 18, 2022, the Wall Street 
Journal ran an editorial authored by 
former President Jimmy Carter and 
former Secretary of State Jim Baker, 
who had previously served as Chief of 
Staff for President Reagan. In this edi-
torial they wrote: 
We stand on opposite sides of the partisan 
divide, but we believe it is better to search 
for solutions together than to remain di-
vided. This is particularly true of a vexing 
problem that could wreak havoc during the 
2024 presidential election: the inadequacy of 
the Electoral Count Act of 1887. 
The act is an antiquated, muddled and po-
tentially unconstitutional law that allows 
uncertainty during a critical step in the 
peaceful transfer of power. . . . Weaknesses 
in the law started to become apparent after 
the 2000 election. 
The editorial continues: 
In 2021, the ambiguities of that law helped 
lead to the violent assault on the U.S. Cap-
itol as efforts were being made to toss out 
several states’ slates of electoral votes. For-
tunately, those efforts failed, and the right-
ful winners took office. But the threat of 
confusion remains. Left unclosed, loopholes 
in the act could allow a repeat of the same 
destructive path that occurred in 2021. 
The Washington Post has written 
several editorials on this subject as 
well. The June 19, 2022, editorial in the 
Post entitled ‘‘Fix the electoral count 
law now, before Trump tries to exploit 
it again’’ reviewed the recent House 
committee hearings on the January 6 
insurrection. The editorial wrote: 
The House committee investigating the 
Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack heard damning 
testimony detailing how President Donald 
Trump and a coterie of partisan lawyers ad-
vanced a dangerous argument: that the vice 
president has the legal authority to overturn 
a presidential election when Congress meets 
to count electoral college votes. Trump offi-
cial after Trump official testified that they 
knew it was wrong. John Eastman, a lawyer 
who advocated for the theory, acknowledged 
as much in front of Mr. Trump on January 4, 
according to testimony from Greg Jacob, 
who was Vice President Mike Pence’s gen-
eral counsel. But Mr. Trump and his allies 
nevertheless waged a relentless public cam-
paign to pressure Mr. PENCE to betray the 
Nation’s democracy. Belief in this antidemo-
cratic nonsense spurred the January 6 mob, 
which infamously chanted, ‘‘Hang Mike 
Pence.’’ 
The Post editorial continued: 
Americans went most of their history 
without having to worry seriously about ar-
cane electoral college procedures. Even in 
closely 
fought, 
acrimonious 
presidential 
elections, losing candidates accepted their 
defeats with grace rather than seeking the 
vulnerabilities in the law to exploit. The 
country no longer has that luxury. Congress 
should have no higher priority than fixing 
the electoral college process. 
The recommendations that are com-
ing out of this bipartisan group would 
do just that—fix the Electoral Count 
Act. 
I want to thank the work of the 
American Law Institute, which con-
vened a bipartisan working group to 
consider possible ECA reforms. In par-
ticular, I want to thank cochairs Bob 
Bauer and Jack Goldsmith for their 
contributions to our efforts. I also 
want to thank the staff at Protect De-
mocracy for their suggestions and 
work here. 
Our legislation aims to ensure that 
Congress can accurately and correctly 
tally the electoral votes cast by the 
States, which should be consistent 
with each State’s popular vote for 
President and Vice President of the 
United States. Our legislation clarifies 
some of the ambiguities in terms of the 
appropriate State and Federal roles in 
selecting the next President and Vice 
President of the United States as set 
forth in the U.S. Constitution. 
In our constitutional system, elec-
tion law, like many other areas of law, 
involves shared powers between the 
Federal Government on the one hand 
and State and local governments on 
the other. Article I, section 4 of the 
Constitution provides: 
The Times, Places, and Manner of holding 
elections for Senators and Representatives, 
shall be prescribed in each State by the Leg-
islature thereof. 
That clause of the Constitution con-
tinues by concluding: 
But the Congress may at any time [by law] 
make or alter such Regulations. 
We have the power here, and that is 
what the Electoral Count Act is about. 
Article II, section 1 of the Constitu-
tion provides: 
Each State shall appoint, in such Manner 
as the Legislature thereof may direct, a 
Number of Electors, equal to the whole Num-
ber of Senators and Representatives to which 
the State may be entitled in the Congress. 
The Constitution also provides: 
The Congress may determine the Time of 
choosing of the Electors, and the Day on 
which they shall give their Votes; which Day 
shall be the same throughout the United 
States. 
The 12th Amendment to the Con-
stitution, ratified in 1804, sets out a 
framework for Congress to tally and 
count the electoral votes from the 
States. Congress later passed the Elec-
toral Count Act, the ECA, in 1887, in 
the aftermath of a contested Hayes- 
Tilden Presidential election of 1876 in 
which States sent competing slates of 
electors to Congress. 
Our legislation takes several key 
steps to modernize the ECA and reduce 
the opportunity for constitutional mis-
chief when it comes to Congress prop-
erly counting the electoral votes of the 
States. 
First, the legislation helps to make 
it easier for Congress to identify a sin-
gle, conclusive slate of electors from 
each State. The legislation requires 
each State’s Governor as responsible 
for submitting the certificate of ascer-
tainment identifying that State’s elec-
tors. A State may designate another 
individual besides the Governor to 
carry out this function, such as the 
Secretary of State, if such an indi-
vidual is named before the election day 
itself. 
Again, the State executive official 
reporting their electoral votes to Con-
gress must do such ‘‘under and in pur-
suance of the laws of such State pro-
viding for such ascertainment enacted 
prior to election day.’’ 
Our legislation, therefore, seeks to 
avoid circumstances in which a State 
attempts to change the rules after elec-
tion day due to political pressure that 
may arise if a particular favored can-
didate loses the election. 
Congress could not accept a slate of 
electors from an official not authorized 
to do so by State law enacted prior to 
election day. Our legislation provides 
that States following these rules will 
have their appointments of electors 
treated as conclusive by Congress sub-
ject to any subsequent State or Federal 
judicial relief granted prior to the date 
of the meeting of electors. 
Our legislation states that the deter-
mination of the Federal courts shall be 
conclusive on questions arising under 
the Constitution or laws of the United 
States. 
Second, the legislation modernizes 
the ‘‘failed election’’ language in the 
ECA to specify that a State could mod-
ify its period of voting on election day 
only as necessitated by ‘‘extraordinary

and catastrophic’’ events ‘‘as provided 
under the laws of the State enacted 
prior to [the election day].’’ 
This provision makes it clear, if a 
State legislature tries to override the 
popular vote in their State, that that 
would not be allowed. 
Third, the legislation provides for the 
expedited judicial review of certain 
claims relating to a State’s certificate 
identifying its electors. We have lim-
ited this special judicial review in our 
legislation to only be available to the 
aggrieved Presidential candidates. This 
special procedure allows for challenges 
made under Federal law and the U.S. 
Constitution to be resolved more effi-
ciently by using a special three-judge 
panel with a direct and timely appeal 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Fourth, the legislation makes clear 
that the Vice President has a purely 
ministerial role in the joint session of 
Congress to count the States’ electoral 
votes. In particular, our legislation 
states that the Vice President does not 
have the power to solely determine, ac-
cept, reject, or otherwise adjudicate 
disputes over electors. That specifi-
cally includes objections over the prop-
er list of electors, the validity of elec-
tors, or the votes of the electors. 
President Trump pressured the Vice 
President to use this illegal method in 
order to overturn the 2020 election re-
sults. Ultimately, this effort was re-
jected by Vice President Pence, in his 
capacity as President of the Senate, as 
he presided over the January 6, 2021, 
joint session. 
Fifth, our legislation increases the 
threshold needed to lodge an objection 
to electors from one Senator and one 
Representative to one-fifth of the duly 
chosen and sworn Members of both the 
House and the Senate. Similarly, arti-
cle I, section 5 of the Constitution pro-
vides ‘‘the Yeas and Nays of the Mem-
bers of either House on any question 
shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those 
present, be entered on the Journal.’’ 
This will reduce the risk and likeli-
hood of frivolous objections being 
lodged, which requires a lengthy debate 
and vote in the separate Houses. The 
House has to vote separately; the Sen-
ate has to vote separately; and it takes 
a lot of time. For example, on January 
6, 2021, the Senate voted to reject, by a 
vote of 6 to 93, the objection against 
the electors of Arizona and voted 7 to 
92 on the objections raised as to the 
electors from Pennsylvania. 
Sixth, our legislation clarifies that, 
if electors are not lawfully appointed 
or if an objection is sustained by Con-
gress rejecting electors as not lawfully 
appointed, those electors would not be 
included in the denominator for deter-
mining the majority of the whole num-
ber of electors appointed. 
That means we can reach a decision 
on the day that we count the votes. 
The main focus of our work over the 
past 6 months has been on this sorely 
needed reform in the ECA, but our 
working group came up with a number 
of bipartisan reforms on some other 
matters related to elections. 
The Presidential Transition Improve-
ment Act would help promote the or-
derly transfer of power between Presi-
dential administrations. As we saw in 
2020, the failure of a timely ascertain-
ment of the winner by the Adminis-
trator of the U.S. General Services Ad-
ministration and the uncooperative at-
titude of the Trump administration led 
to a delay in providing transition re-
sources to the incoming Biden adminis-
tration. This legislation provides clear-
er guidelines for eligible candidates for 
President and Vice President to receive 
Federal resources to support their 
transitions, including allowing more 
than one candidate to receive these re-
sources during the time period when 
the outcome of an election is in reason-
able doubt. 
The Postal Service Election Improve-
ment Act seeks to improve the han-
dling of mail-in ballots by the U.S. 
Postal Service and provides guidance 
and best practices to the States to im-
prove their mail-in ballot processes if 
State law allows. 
The Election Assistance Commission 
Reauthorization Act would reauthorize 
the Election Assistance Commission 
for 5 years. The EAC administers 
grants to States and develops non-
binding guidance and best practices for 
election officials in various areas, in-
cluding cyber security, election audits, 
and voting accessibility. 
What this legislation does not in-
clude is any substantive provision to 
strengthen voting rights in this coun-
try, which is desperately needed, and I 
am sorely disappointed by that omis-
sion. Our Nation has a long history of 
bipartisan 
work 
on 
voting 
rights 
issues. I repeatedly raised voting rights 
issues with our larger group as well as 
with our smaller subgroup on voting 
practices. 
Let me take a moment to remind my 
colleagues of our voting rights history. 
The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was ap-
proved by a broad bipartisan vote of 328 
to 74 in the House and by a vote of 79 
to 18 in the Senate, and Congress had a 
long bipartisan track record of clari-
fying its intent in response to restric-
tive Supreme Court decisions—that is, 
until recently. 
In 1982, Congress amended section 2 
of the Voting Rights Act after the Mo-
bile v. Bolden decision in which the Su-
preme Court interpreted section 2 as 
prohibiting only purposeful discrimina-
tion. That was very restrictive, making 
the Voting Rights Act much less effec-
tive. Congress responded to that deci-
sion by clarifying that section 2 explic-
itly bans any voting practice that had 
a discriminatory result irrespective of 
whether the practice was enacted or 
operated for a discriminatory purpose. 
The 1982 amendments—these are the 
amendments that corrected the Su-
preme Court’s restricted decision— 
passed the House by a vote of 389 to 24 
and the Senate by a vote of 85 to 8. 
They were signed into law by President 
Reagan, a bipartisan action. 
Over 20 years later, Congress acted to 
address two Supreme Court rulings to 
clarify congressional intent regarding 
section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. 
This reauthorization passed 390 to 33 in 
the House and 98 to 0 in the Senate. It 
was signed into law by President 
George W. Bush—again, a bipartisan 
action. 
So, after the Supreme Court’s deci-
sion in Shelby County v. Holder in 2013 
and after Brnovich in 2021, Congress 
should have acted to clarify the intent 
of the Voting Rights Act, but it didn’t, 
and now we are faced today with to-
tally unnecessary partisan gridlock on 
voting rights. We saw this gridlock 
play out this January when the Senate 
refused to even take up and debate the 
Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act. 
Let me mention one section of the 
VRA in particular. Section 2 of the 
Voting Rights Act protects against dis-
criminatory voting laws. It prohibits 
any jurisdiction from implementing a 
‘‘voting qualification or prerequisite to 
voting, or standard, practice, or proce-
dure . . . in a manner which results in 
a denial or abridgement of the right 
. . . to vote on account of race,’’ color, 
or language minority status. 
For nearly 40 years, case law has in-
terpreted section 2 to combat racial 
discrimination without partisan favor. 
Prior to the Brnovich case, the Su-
preme Court and several circuit courts 
had adopted a standard to ensure the 
effective implementation of these pro-
visions consistent with the text and 
purpose of the Act as amended in 1982. 
The Brnovich decision deviated from 
congressional intent behind section 2. 
The Court adopted an unduly narrow 
reading of section 2 and went beyond 
the statutory interpretation by courts 
for decades by outlining five new 
guideposts. The decision is not teth-
ered to the statutory text and is incon-
sistent with the statute’s purpose and 
historical usage. 
It wasn’t the first time the Court 
narrowed our law, but in previous ef-
forts, we came together, Democrats 
and Republicans, to make sure that the 
Voting Rights Act was effective. So I 
am disappointed that we could not 
make progress in our working group to 
address the needed fix to section 2. 
We should have also looked at the 
issue of the right of private action. 
Since the Voting Rights Act’s enact-
ment in 1965, Congress has intended 
that voters be able to sue directly to 
enforce the Voting Rights Act rather 
than depend entirely upon the U.S. De-
partment of Justice, which has finite 
resources to protect voting rights. 
I want to thank my colleague Sen-
ator MURKOWSKI for consistently rais-
ing this issue. 
The Voting Rights Act’s private 
right of action is settled law as Con-
gress has repeatedly noted in its Vot-
ing Rights Act’s amendments. 
Even though the private right of ac-
tion is clear and settled law, our group 
should have removed any ambiguity 
about its intent by proposing language 
making it more explicit the statute’s 
existing right for private action. Just

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3602 
July 21, 2022 
as we resolved ambiguities in the ECA 
and its potential misinterpretation, we 
should have done the same with this 
critical right of private action under 
the Voting Rights Act—a missed oppor-
tunity. 
As a recent report from the Brennan 
Center points out, State legislatures 
have been working to make it harder 
to vote after the 2020 elections, even 
after witnessing record turnout during 
the pandemic. The Brennan Center 
wrote that in 2022: 
[S]tate lawmakers, who spent 2021 passing 
laws that made it harder to vote, have fo-
cused more intently on election interference, 
passing nine laws that could lead to tam-
pering with how elections are run and how 
results are determined. 
Election interference laws do two primary 
things. They open the door to partisan inter-
ference in elections, or they threaten the 
people and processes that make elections 
work. In many cases, these efforts are being 
justified as measures to combat baseless 
claims of widespread voter fraud and a stolen 
2020 election. 
The Brennan Center noted that in 
many of these same State legislatures, 
lawmakers have continued to introduce 
or enact laws that restrict access to 
the vote. Legislation is categorized as 
restrictive if it would make it harder 
for eligible Americans to register, stay 
on the rolls, and/or to vote as compared 
to existing State law. 
Free and fair elections are funda-
mental to who we are as a nation. For 
this reason, I strongly support the bi-
partisan working group’s proposal to 
reform and modernize the ECA. As we 
saw in the 2020 elections, different in-
terpretations of the Electoral Count 
Act can lead down a dangerous path to 
another January 6-style insurrection, 
when former President Donald Trump 
and his enablers attempted to overturn 
a free and fair election won by Presi-
dent Joe Biden. 
Congress’s work will not be complete 
when we pass this bipartisan proposal. 
We still must take up and pass voting 
rights legislation in order to safeguard 
the right to vote, which should be a 
right guaranteed to all Americans, re-
gardless of their race, wealth, or social 
status. 
I yield the floor.

Whereas, in response to this invasion, the peo-
ple of Ukraine marshaled their will to defend 
their country and shared belief in a sovereign 
Ukraine in order to resist the imperialist ambi-
tions of Vladimir Putin; 
Whereas countless Ukrainian men, women, 
and children have done their part to defend de-
mocracy and freedom in Ukraine; 
Whereas women have played a key role in de-
fending Ukraine, keeping their families and in-
nocent children safe and responding to the in-
vasion by the Russian Federation; 
Whereas, in the first 3 months of fighting in 
Ukraine, more than 6,100,000 Ukrainians, of 
which the majority are women and children, 
fled the country in response to Putin’s war; 
Whereas women play a critical role in facili-
tating the transit of children to safety, includ-
ing by escorting the children of parents and 
guardians who cannot leave Ukraine so that 
such children are able to find safety in neigh-
boring countries; 
Whereas the women who remain in Ukraine 
contribute to all aspects of warfighting, includ-
ing by fighting on the front lines and as part of 
the territorial defense, delivering supplies and 
weapons, and preparing cities for assaults by 
the Russian Federation; 
Whereas between 15 and 17 percent of the 
armed forces of Ukraine are women;

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3603 
July 21, 2022 
Whereas the women of Ukraine have a long 
history of defending Ukraine and standing up 
for their rights and freedoms; 
Whereas, following the 2014 invasion of the 
sovereign and independent state of Ukraine by 
the Russian Federation, the women of Ukraine 
joined the fight to preserve their independence; 
Whereas, despite significant contributions to 
the war effort now and since 2014, outdated leg-
islation in Ukraine classifies women as cooks, 
tailors, and administrative assistants; 
Whereas women are an integral part of the 
armed forces of Ukraine and continue to defend 
their homes and their country; 
Whereas, on March 9, the armed forces of the 
Russian Federation deliberately attacked civil-
ian targets in Mariupol, Ukraine, which de-
stroyed a hospital that served as both a mater-
nity ward and a children’s hospital, killing two 
women and a baby; 
Whereas, following the devastating attack on 
the well-known and established hospital, the 
world watched in horror as pregnant women, 
mothers carrying newborn babies, and young 
children fled the rubble of what should have 
been a safe place; 
Whereas the women at the hospital should 
have been celebrating new life and looking to-
ward raising their children in peace and safety, 
instead, those women are seeking shelter in sub-
ways, giving birth in bunkers, and worrying for 
the safety of their children and the future of 
Ukraine; 
Whereas the attack on the maternity ward 
and children’s hospital in Mariupol was the 
fourth such attack on a maternity ward in 
Ukraine by the Russian Federation since the be-
ginning of the invasion on February 24; 
Whereas, according to Save the Children, 
more than 63,000 women have given birth since 
the start of the war, while the United Nations 
estimates that 80,000 Ukrainian women will give 
birth in between April and June of 2022; 
Whereas all women, in every situation, have 
the right to a safe birth and access to crucial 
supplies necessary for the management of preg-
nancy complications, including oxygen and 
medical supplies, which are running dan-
gerously low in Ukraine because of the ongoing 
violence and refusal on the part of the Russian 
Federation to allow for safe passage for human-
itarian purposes; 
Whereas, on March 17, 2022, Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken described the deliberate 
targeting of civilians in Ukraine as a war crime, 
which should be investigated as such; 
Whereas, 
on 
March 
23, 
2022, 
Secretary 
Blinken announced that it was the assessment 
of the United States Government that ‘‘members 
of Russia’s forces have committed war crimes in 
Ukraine’’ based on ‘‘a careful review of avail-
able information from public and intelligence 
sources’’; 
Whereas the Russian Federation has delib-
erately attacked civilians and civilian infra-
structure in Ukraine, including schools, hos-
pitals, businesses, apartment buildings, and 
utility services; 
Whereas the initial days of the invasion of 
Ukraine by the Russian Federation have re-
sulted in a disproportionate number of women 
and children seeking safety outside of Ukraine; 
Whereas Ukrainian women and girls, like 
women and girls in all humanitarian emer-
gencies, including women and girls forced to 
leave their homes in conflict settings, face in-
creased and exacerbated vulnerabilities to— 
(1) gender-based violence, including rape, 
child marriage, domestic violence, and sexual 
exploitation and assault; 
(2) all forms of human trafficking; 
(3) disruptions in education and livelihood; 
(4) lack of access to health care; and 
(5) food insecurity and malnutrition; 
Whereas the United Nations Security Council 
adopted United Nations Security Council Reso-
lution 1325 on October 31, 2000, acknowledging 
the impact of conflict and security decisions on 
women and calling on all member states to in-
clude ‘‘women at all decision-making levels in 
national, regional and international institutions 
and mechanisms for the prevention, manage-
ment, and resolution of conflict’’; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations En-
tity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment 
of Women (commonly referred to as ‘‘UN 
Women’’), peace negotiations are more likely to 
end in a peace agreement when women and 
women’s groups play a meaningful role in the 
negotiation process, and according to the Inter-
national Peace Institute, a peace agreement is 
35 percent more likely to last at least 15 years if 
women participate in the development of the 
peace agreement; 
Whereas, in 2016, Ukraine adopted its first 
National Action Plan for the implementation of 
United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1325, and, on October 28, 2020, Ukraine ap-
proved a new National Action Plan for 2021 
through 2025 in order to address the impact on 
women of the aggression of the Russian Federa-
tion against Ukraine and to ensure gender 
equality in the security and defense sectors of 
Ukraine; 
Whereas representation of women in politics 
in Ukraine has increased steadily since the first 
parliament of an independent Ukraine met in 
1990; 
Whereas more than 20 percent of seats in the 
ninth and current Verkhovna Rada are held by 
women, the most in Ukrainian history; 
Whereas women across Ukraine have made 
political gains in recent years, including in local 
elections on October 25, 2020, where 38 percent 
of deputies elected were women; and 
Whereas women in Ukraine should be in-
volved at all levels and in all aspects of leader-
ship, negotiation, conflict resolution, and peace-
keeping in order to ensure the most enduring 
peace for Ukraine and the region: Now, there-
fore, be it 
ƒResolved,≈ 
That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes, honors, and commends the 
women of Ukraine who have contributed to the 
fight for freedom and the defense of Ukraine, 
including women who— 
(A) are members of the Armed Forces and the 
Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine; 
(B) are volunteers, organizing and operating 
humanitarian organizations; 
(C) are doctors, nurses, paramedics, and sup-
port personnel, providing life-saving services 
across Ukraine; 
(D) have mobilized to assist the safe transfer 
of the children and other vulnerable individuals 
from Ukraine; and 
(E) are public leaders, politicians, and dip-
lomats; 
(2) stands with the people of Ukraine in sup-
port of their fight for freedom against the Rus-
sian Federation; 
(3) acknowledges the women who have risked 
their lives to travel through territory controlled 
by the Russian Federation, break siege tactics 
surrounding cities, and to ensure the safety of 
children and the elderly; 
(4) commends— 
(A) the bordering countries of Ukraine, in-
cluding Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, 
and Moldova, who are accommodating more 
than 6,000,000 refugees; and 
(B) the broader European Union for commit-
ting to provide support during the growing hu-
manitarian crisis; 
(5) calls on all countries to ensure that aid 
provided in support of refugees fleeing Ukraine 
and internally displaced persons within Ukraine 
takes into account the needs of women and the 
gender-specific risks that women face in seeking 
safety; 
(6) acknowledges the important role women 
must play in resolving the conflict between 
Ukraine and the Russian Federation as outlined 
in United Nations Security Council Resolution 
1325 (2016) and required by the laws of the 
United States and regulations of Ukraine; 
(7) further calls on all countries to promote 
the meaningful inclusion of women in negotia-
tions and decision-making at all levels, includ-
ing security decisions; and 
(8) commits to supporting the women of 
Ukraine wherever they are as they fight back 
against tyranny and work for the free and 
democratic future of Ukraine. 
Mr. CARDIN. I further ask that the 
committee-reported substitute amend-
ment to the resolution be agreed to; 
the resolution, as amended, be agreed 
to; the committee-reported substitute 
amendment to the preamble be agreed 
to; the preamble, as amended, be

Iowans look to broadcasters at KXEL 
as trusted leaders in the community, 
relying on its programs each morning, 
noon, and night to stay up to date on 
local events, learn more about break-
ing news, and get critical information 
during emergencies. As an elected Rep-
resentative, I particularly want to 
thank everyone at KXEL for their 
work to provide a way to communicate 
with constituents. I have the pleasure 
of speaking with Jeff Stein at least 
once a month, where I answer ques-

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, fol-
lowing my submission yesterday, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the next part of an inves-
tigation directed by the U.S. Central 
Command concerning the Abbey Gate 
bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ACTS–SCK–DO 
Subject: Findings and Recommendation—At-
tack Against U.S. Forces Conducting 
NEO at Hamid Karzai International Air-
port on 26 August 2021. 
(b) Training. 
(i) Prior to deploying to the CENTCOM 
AOR in the spring of 2021, the units assigned 
to the SPMAGTF completed typical pre-de-
ployment training, focused on their core 
METs (exhibits 53, 55, 56, 57, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81). 
Additionally, 2/1 conducted training at the 
Infantry Immersion Trainer (IIT) at Camp 
Pendleton, where they trained on embassy 
reinforcement and crowd control operations 
(exhibits 76, 77, 86). While deployed, 2/1’s 
companies were distributed throughout the 
AOR, and conducted various training events 
that would prove beneficial while operating 
at HKIA later in their deployment. 
(ii) Echo Company, 2/1 conducted two Mis-
sion Rehearsal Exercises (MRXs), along with 
STP, CLD–21 and MWSD–373, at PSAB in 
July 2021, where they focused on ECC oper-
ations and security and response to a 
MASCAL event (exhibits 53, 54, 56, 57, 76). 
Echo Company, 2/1 also conducted non-lethal 
weapons training at PSAB and additional 
medical training in Kuwait (exhibit 82). 
(iii) Golf Company, 2/1 deployed three pla-
toons to Jordan, and one platoon initially to 
Djibouti, and then to PSAB, where it sup-
ported the Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and 
Personnel (TRAP) mission. In Jordan, Golf 
Company focused on its core METs, but had 
the unique opportunity to train alongside 
the U.K.’s 2 PARA, and the 77th Royal Jor-
danian Marine Battalion (77th RJMB). Train-
ing with 2 PARA helped build a level of 
interoperability and familiarity that proved 
useful when Golf Company, 2/1 served along-
side 2 PARA at Abbey Gate, HKIA, whereas 
training with 77th RJMB helped Golf Com-
pany Marines grow accustomed to operating 
with non-native English speakers, a skill 
that also proved useful at HKIA (exhibits 53, 
76, 77, 80, 86, 89, 90). Third Platoon, Golf Com-
pany, 2/1 received extensive medical training 
while serving as the TRAP platoon, to in-
clude 
Tactical 
Combat 
Casualty 
Care 
(TCCC), Combat Trauma Management (CTM) 
training, and Valkyrie walking blood bank 
training (exhibits 86, 98). The rest of Golf 
Company conducted Combat Life Saver 
(CLS) refresher training, TCCC refresher 
training, and MASCAL training in Jordan, 
while Golf Company’s junior Hospital Corps-
men conducted CTM and Valkyrie training 
prior to deploying to HKIA in support of the 
NEO (exhibits 77, 98). 
(iv) Fox Company, 2/1 deployed to the BEC, 
where the company executed fixed site secu-
rity and crowd control operations, and 
trained on non-lethal weapons employment, 
all of which prepared them to operate at 
Abbey Gate (exhibit 81). All 2/1 companies 
discussed ROE and the importance of treat-
ing people at the gates of HKIA with empa-
thy and respect prior to deploying to HKIA 
(exhibits 53, 54, 56, 57, 76, 77, 78, 81). The STP 
completed multiple MASCAL drills while de-
ployed at Al Jaber, Kuwait and PSAB, prior 
to deploying to HKIA (exhibit 66). 
e. Leadership. 
(1) Key Finding. COMREL and Task Orga-
nization. The task organization worked. This 
was in large part due to pre-existing or 
quickly forged relationships among leaders 
at the highest echelons and adaptability at 
the lower echelons. 
(a) The 82nd Airborne Division, led by MG 
Donahue, executed their mission with a clear 
chain of command (exhibits 10, 121, 124, 125). 
The Division rapidly adapted to the changing 
situation, as they were responsible for secu-
rity of the airhead, support to the NEO, plan-
ning for the retrograde of all personnel and 
equipment, demilitarization of arms and 
equipment, and executing the JTE (exhibits 
121, 125). In addition to security, the Division 
conducted initial screening and recovery of 
AMCITs, LPRs, locally hired embassy per-
sonnel, SIV applicants, and at risk Afghans 
at South and West Gates (exhibit 143). Once 
identified and screened, these evacuees were 
processed through the ECC for manifesting 
and departure from HKIA (exhibits 121, 125). 
(b) General McKenzie established the NEO 
COMREL, and officially granted 82nd Air-
borne TACON of JTF–CR (exhibit 10, 11, 238). 
In reality, JTF–CR was TACON to USFOR–A 
FWD, and merely coordinated with the 82nd 
Airborne Division (exhibits 18, 21, 40, 125). 
This adjusted COMREL, along with the mix-
ing of tactical responsibilities, resulted in 
the 82nd conducting airfield security and 
NEO for one sector, and JTF–CR conducting 
airfield security and NEO in another sector 
(exhibits 15, 121, 125, 143, 155). The senior offi-
cers made this division of tasks work under 
the circumstances with adjusted COMREL, 
mutual trust, and shared understanding. 
(2) Engaged and Responsive Leaders. 
(a) The leadership of the U.S. Forces 
tasked with conducting a NEO at HKIA 
worked collaboratively to adapt in an uncer-
tain, chaotic, ambiguous, and high-threat 
environment. U.S. Forces experienced rap-
idly changing, complex relationships and 
compressed timelines to conduct a NEO. 
These leadership challenges were exacer-
bated by the reality that the Taliban, who 
could be described as a supporting effort, 
were operating under a unity of effort as op-
posed to a unity of command (exhibits 53, 
125). This was demonstrated at each location 
around 
the 
perimeter 
of 
HKIA, 
where 
Taliban assistance ranged from actively sup-
porting crowd control, to non-support, and 
even actively taunting the Marines (exhibits 
23, 53, 100, 102, 125, 146). RADM Vasely, MG 
Donahue, and BGen Sullivan conducted Key 
Leader Engagements (KLE) to coordinate ac-
tivities, ensure mission accomplishment, and 
protect the force (exhibits 21, 23, 125). Their 
coordination with the Taliban facilitated 
crowd control and force protection, and 
minimized the incidence of kinetic engage-
ments between U.S. Forces, and Taliban (ex-
hibits 53, 104, 125). While the ROE may not 
have been entirely clear at all times, due to 
the rapidly changing situation, U.S. Forces 
retained the right to self-defense, the ability 
to engage individuals committing hostile 
acts or demonstrating hostile intent, and the 
ability to utilize riot-control measures in de-
fense to protect the force and civilians. 
(b) Military leadership at every level was 
engaged and responsive, enabling security of 
the airhead, executing the NEO, and plan-
ning 
to 
execute 
the 
Joint 
Tactical 
Exfiltration (JTE). There were numerous ex-
amples of great leadership during an oper-
ation amounting to simultaneous combat, 
evacuation, and humanitarian tasks during a 
compressed 
time, 
with 
constrained 
re-
sources, and severe restrictions on terrain. 
There are three examples to highlight, the 
first being how leadership engaged the NSU 
and Taliban forces to assist with inner and 
outer perimeter security and checkpoint 
screening. Another example was the em-
placement of the Chevron obstacle at Abbey 
Gate, which in combination with outside in-
fluences, had a profound impact on the flow 
of evacuees. The last example was the battle-
field rotations conducted before 26 August 
and immediately before the blast at Abbey 
Gate. It should be noted that several leaders 
and Marines interviewed stated operations at

HKIA were so chaotic, that even with the 
tremendous amounts of training conducted 
prior to deployment, no training would be 
able to prepare someone for what they faced 
(exhibits 107, 101 ). All of these examples 
tested leaders’ ability to remain flexible in a 
dynamic environment and challenged them 
to rise above adversity. 
(c) These challenges began when civilians 
breached the perimeter and started to oc-
cupy the southern area of HKIA on 15 August 
(exhibits 15, 53, 54, 56). This caused the JTF– 
CR to send 50 out of 53 personnel, emptying 
their JOC, to assist in pushing back the 
crowd (exhibit 15). It took almost everyone 
on the airfield to get the civilians off the 
runway in order to continue operations (ex-
hibit 15, 53, 54, 56). Leadership recognized 
that they had to build and leverage relation-
ships in order to provide better security and 
screening. This led to negotiations between 
RADM Vasely, the NSU, and the Taliban (ex-
hibit 53). The NSU helped to clear the air-
field and manned their gate, while MG 
Donahue instructed the Taliban regarding 
which areas they would need to control and 
clear to facilitate the NEO (exhibit 18, 21, 
123, 125). The Taliban would later establish 
outer checkpoints and, more notably, pro-
vide security at the Chevron outside the 
outer corridor of Abbey Gate (exhibits 54, 77, 
81, 84, 85 86, 89). 
(d) The coordination to install the Chev-
ron, which ultimately changed the dynamics 
at Abbey Gate, involved the U.K., Taliban 
and the Commander of Golf Company, 2/1 
Marines, 
(TEXT 
REDACTED) 
The 
U.K. 
Forces devised the idea and the placement 
location, but were having trouble executing 
(TEXT REDACTED) and other members of 
the senior leadership were conducting KLEs 
with the Taliban to discuss security and fu-
ture operations (exhibit 54, 18). (TEXT RE-
DACTED) had the Taliban move the broken 
vehicles that were in the way and preventing 
the Chevron from being emplaced, and help 
to help to control Afghan civilians (exhibit 
77). The Taliban would later provide security 
in front of and on top of the Chevron con-
tainers (exhibits 54, 77, 81, 84, 85 86, 89). 
(TEXT REDACTED) also coordinated with 
the MEU engineers to use their equipment to 
move jersey barriers and emplace the con-
tainers forming the Chevron (exhibits 54, 77, 
81, 84, 85, 89, 103). This helped to create stand-
off between troops and the crowd and control 
the flow of personnel coming into the Abbey 
Gate for processing. 
(e) Leadership, from USFOR–A FWD down 
to the company level, would visit the gates 
to ensure the Service members were cared 
for and to gather situational awareness of 
the 
rapidly 
changing 
environment. 
The 
USFOR–A FWD team would visit gates mul-
tiple times a day (exhibit 21, 22, 23). The 
USFOR–A FWD (TEXT REDACTED) would 
visit the gates to check on Marines/Soldiers 
and to provide reports on the current condi-
tions and situation at the gates (exhibits 17, 
21, 96). On 26 August, just before 1700, BGen 
Sullivan, (TEXT REDACTED) (all of JTF– 
CR) had visited Abbey Gate and left the area 
20 minutes before the blast (exhibits 17, 19). 
(TEXT REDACTED) 3/10 IBCT, (TEXT RE-
DACTED) 2/501 PIR, and (TEXT REDACTED) 
1/8 visited Abbey Gate on 26 August as well 
(exhibits 104, 123, 126). The (TEXT RE-
DACTED) of 2/1, (TEXT REDACTED) at-
tended a meeting at the Barron Hotel with 
Taliban and U.K. Forces to discuss the im-
pending closure of Abbey Gate at 1600 on 26 
August. As he was leaving Abbey Gate, 
(TEXT REDACTED) was caught in the blast 
(exhibits 53, 90). 
(f) Leaders on the ground engaged with 
their teams in order to work through the 
evolving situation. They were coordinating 
support with friendly units while also nego-
tiating with the NSU and Taliban to provide 
security for gate operations and retrograde 
planning. Junior leaders were empowered to 
make 
and 
execute 
decisions, 
as 
dem-
onstrated through the emplacement of the 
Chevron. Overall, military leaders executed 
the mission and protected their Marines and 
Soldiers to the best of their ability. 
f. Medical Considerations. 
(1) Key Finding. The wounds sustained by 
the KIA were so catastrophic none could be 
saved. Medical providers at multiple eche-
lons stated access to additional advanced 
treatment and equipment would not have 
saved more lives. The capability at HKIA’s 
Role II–E saved several Service Members 
who otherwise would have succumbed to 
their wounds. Providers stated the capability 
at HKIA was the most robust they had expe-
rienced in an operational setting. Every 
Service Member who could have been saved 
with medical treatment survived due to the 
medical capability at HKIA. 
(2) Capabilities. 
(a) Role II. Throughout the Afghanistan 
NEO, there were two Role II facilities at 
HKIA, one on North HKIA (NHKIA), referred 
to at times as the NATO Role II, Role II–E, 
or the Military Treatment Facility (MTF), 
had the most robust capability, while a sec-
ond facility at Camp Alvarado was operated 
by 1/82 IBCT medical personnel (exhibits 66, 
98, 128, 130, 131). The MTF hosted eight sur-
gical teams, including three Army Forward 
Resuscitative Surgical Teams (FRST), one 
Army light surgical team, two U.S. SOSTs, 
one Norwegian SOST, and one U.K. surgical 
team. The MTF had two ORs, with the abil-
ity to surge to four patients simultaneously, 
and space for seven intensive care unit (ICU) 
and 14 ward patients, with the ability to 
surge on both. The MTF also had CT scan-
ning and x-ray capability, a lab, a pharmacy, 
and an ER that operated 24 hours a day (ex-
hibits 128, 131). According to multiple med-
ical officers, the MTF at HKIA had more as-
sets and capability than any field facility 
they had ever seen (exhibits 66, 128, 130, 131). 
The second Role II facility, located at Camp 
Alvarado, was operated by personnel from 1/ 
82 IBCT and hosted an Army FRSD. The 
FRSD was capable of providing limited dam-
age control surgery and resuscitation (ex-
hibit 130). 
(b) Role I. There were two Role I–E facili-
ties at HKIA throughout the NEO. The 24th 
MEU’s STP operated next to the PAX Ter-
minal on NHKIA, while the SPMAGTF’s STP 
operated out of a building between East Gate 
and Abbey Gate. The MEU STP had two phy-
sician assistants (PA), two nurses, and 15 
corpsmen (exhibit 16). The SPMAGTF STP 
had two ER doctors, one PA, two nurses, and 
12 corpsmen (exhibit 66). In addition to the 
two Role I–E facilities, the U.K. operated a 
Role I facility out of the Barron Hotel, in vi-
cinity of Abbey Gate (exhibits 77, 98). 
(3) MASCAL Plan. Prior to executing the 
NEO, the MASCAL plan for HKIA was not 
comprehensive, in that it did not incorporate 
every compound surrounding the airfield. In-
stead, the existing MASCAL plan only re-
ferred to NHKIA, where the aforementioned 
NATO Role II/MTF was located. Leading up 
to the NEO, TF MED leadership began refin-
ing the MASCAL plan, and attempted to des-
ignate CCPs and evacuation routes through-
out the airfield (exhibit 128). The updated 
plan was not finalized prior to the beginning 
of the NEO, and as a result, during the NEO 
the MASCAL plan was reduced to, ‘‘In the 
event of a MASCAL event, utilize all avail-
able vehicles to transport casualties to the 
MTF as quickly as possible (exhibits 66, 128, 
130, 131)’’. The lack of a comprehensive 
MASCAL plan caused some frustration and 
concern for units operating away from 
NHKIA (exhibit 66). Despite the lack of a 
comprehensive plan, each unit conducted in-
ternal MASCAL rehearsals that undoubtedly 
contributed to the rapid, successful response 
witnessed following the Abbey Gate attack 
of 26 August (exhibits 66, 98, 128, 130, 131).

(MEDROE). At the start of the NEO, the 
MEDROE were unclear among the various 
medical providers (exhibits 66, 130, 131). The 
SPMAGTF STP and 1/82 IBCT Role II were 
initially under the impression they were to 
adhere to the standing CENTCOM MEDROE, 
which was complicated by the fact that serv-
ice members were coming into close, regular 
contact with large numbers of civilians at 
the HKIA gates (exhibits 66, 130). After oper-
ating for several days under an ambiguous 
MEDROE, TF MED’s (TEXT REDACTED) 
passed guidance to all providers at HKIA 
stating that they were responsible for pro-
viding care to anyone within the gates of the 
airfield (exhibits 66, 130, 131). The lack of ini-
tial clarity regarding MEDROE presented a 
challenge for some medical providers, and 
served as a source of frustration (exhibit 66). 
(5) MASCAL Preparations Prior to 26 Au-
gust. Upon his arrival at HKIA, 82nd 
Airborne’s Commander, MG Donahue, identi-
fied the likelihood of a MASCAL event dur-
ing the course of the NEO, and tasked the 
82nd’s senior medical officer with preparing 
for a MASCAL (exhibit 125). In the days lead-
ing up to the attack on 26 August, units at 
all echelons conducted MASCAL rehearsals 
(exhibits 16, 18, 21, 66, 98, 128, 130, 131). In re-
sponse to the increased threat leading up to 
26 August, the SPMAGTF STP (TEXT RE-
DACTED) ran MASCAL rehearsals in her 
clinic, and staged an ambulance with an en 
route care team inside the inner gate at 
Abbey Gate on the evening of 25 August (ex-
hibit 66). Beginning on the morning of 26 Au-
gust, Golf Company, 2/1 established a CCP in-
side the outer gate, and consolidated medical 
supplies, litters, and corpsmen at the CCP in 
anticipation of a potential attack and 
MASCAL event (exhibits 77, 98). Following a 
phone call from the USFOR–A FWD (TEXT 
REDACTED) at 1310 on 26 August warning of 
a likely attack, TF MED (TEXT RE-
DACTED) consolidated all medical personnel 
at the MTF, and kept them on standby 
throughout the afternoon so that they were 
prepared to respond rapidly to a MASCAL 
(exhibit 131). 
g. Chronology/Timeline of Events. See en-
closure 9. 
4. Recommendations. 
a. TBI Screening. During the course of the 
investigation, it became apparent Service 
Members received inconsistent evaluation 
for concussion and TBI after the attack at 
Abbey Gate. Since the initial medical evacu-
ation of the wounded, twelve Service Mem-
bers have been added to the list of those 
wounded in action; many for TBI. I therefore 
recommend forwarding findings and rec-
ommendations to all CENTCOM Service 
Component Commanders for consideration 
that all Service Members at Abbey Gate dur-
ing the attack, and present in any blast zone 
depicted in exhibit 137, slide 7, be evaluated 
for TBI. 
b. Mental Health Evaluation. A consistent 
trend during interviews with young Marines 
were stories involving traumatic injuries and 
death of children, separation of families at 
gates, and outright rejection of evacuees cul-
minating in their distraught return to the 
civilian population outside the gate. During 
the response to the attack at Abbey Gate, 
young Marines heroically recovered the 
wounded and rendered life-saving care. Oth-
ers carried the bodies of their deceased 
friends away from the canal. In consider-
ation of the mental and emotional strain 
placed on these young Marines and other 
Service Members, I recommend forwarding

the findings and recommendations to all 
CENTCOM Service Component Commanders. 
Recommend mental health evaluations and 
treatment options for all personnel exe-
cuting entry control point operations at 
Abbey Gate from 17–26 August. Evaluations 
and treatment options should also be pur-
sued for personnel involved in the medical 
response to the attack on Abbey Gate on 26 
August. 
c. Interagency NEO Doctrine. Many leaders 
observed planning and execution with inter-
agency partners was difficult, because there 
was no shared understanding or baseline con-
cepts common to the various entities in-
volved in the execution of NEO. To address 
this shortcoming, I recommend forwarding 
this investigation to the Joint Staff for con-
sideration in drafting and publication of 
interagency 
doctrine 
for 
Non-combatant 
Evacuation Operations. 
d. Further Investigation. During an inter-
view with Platoon Commanders of Golf Com-
pany, 2/1 Marines, a Platoon Commander 
stated a civilian was killed by a flash bang 
grenade. The investigator did not pursue the 
line of questioning, because of the group set-
ting and potential for misconduct and a 
rights advisement. After speaking with my 
legal advisor, I assessed this line of inquiry 
was outside my scope to investigate and 
would incur a significant delay in meeting 
my timeline and mandate. I recommend for-
warding exhibits 84 and 128 to MARCENT for 
potential 
investigation 
into 
statements 
made by the Platoon Commander from Golf 
Company, 2/1 Marines, concerning a possible 
civilian casualty caused by use of a flash 
bang grenade.

REMEMBERING CHARLES H. COO-
LIDGE 
AND 
HERSHEL 
W. 
‘‘WOODY’’ WILLIAMS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, in 
its mission statement, the National 
Medal of Honor Heritage Center in 
Chattanooga, TN, highlights the values 
of patriotism, citizenship, courage, in-
tegrity, sacrifice, and commitment as 
central to the character of every Medal 
of Honor recipient. When put into ac-
tion, these values culminate in uncom-
mon acts of heroism. 
Today, I have the privilege of recog-
nizing two heroes whose valor on the 
battlefield earned them the Medal of 
Honor and the admiration of their 
countrymen: Charles H. Coolidge of 
Tennessee and Hershel W. ‘‘Woody’’ 
Williams of West Virginia. We lost 
Charles last year and Woody just a few 
weeks ago, but their legacies remain a 
celebration of the sacrifice, resilience, 
and service of the 16 million men and 
women who served in the Armed Forces 
during World War II and saved the 
world 
from 
the 
horrors 
of 
authoritarianism. The Senate came to-
gether and rallied around one final 
tribute to the era’s Medal of Honor re-
cipients, and on July 14, Woody Wil-
liams became just the seventh Amer-
ican to lay in honor in the rotunda of 
the U.S. Capitol. It was a lovely, fit-
ting way to show our gratitude not 
only to Woody, but to all the World 
War II Medal of Honor recipients we 
lost before him. 
I can think of no better way to keep 
this spirit of camaraderie alive than to 
put their legacies to work on behalf of 
younger generations who are just be-
ginning to understand that the preser-
vation of freedom for all humanity will 
require much more than bold words. 
Liberty is not an act of sheer will, 
but a reflection within a people of the 
same values that prompted Charles and 
Woody to put themselves between their 
brothers in arms and enemy troops. On 
behalf of all Tennesseans, I thank these 
brave men for their commitment to the 
common cause of freedom and pray 
that all our Nation’s leaders will en-
deavor to follow in their footsteps. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO ELI DICKEN 
Mr. YOUNG. Mr. President, I rise to 
formally express my gratitude for the 
heroic actions of my fellow Hoosier, Eli 
Dicken, at the Greenwood Park Mall. 
On Sunday, July 17, 2022, in the midst 
of unimaginable tragedy, Eli boldly 
stepped forward into danger to save the 
lives of others. As a murderer com-
mitted a heinous act of violence at the 
Greenwood Park Mall, Eli, after direct-
ing others around him to get to safety, 
drew his own firearm, and fired upon 
the attacker, ultimately taking his life 
and saving the lives of countless inno-
cent bystanders. Within 15 seconds, Eli 
was able to stop an even greater trag-
edy. As Chief James Ison of the Green-
wood, IN, Police Department noted, 
Eli’s actions ‘‘were nothing short of he-
roic’’ and ‘‘many more people would 
have died . . . if it was not for his her-
oism.’’ Eli’s actions were possible due 
to this own bravery and because of ac-
tions taken by the State of Indiana to 
ensure that law-abiding citizens are 
freely able to exercise their constitu-
tional right to keep and bear arms. 
I mourn the three innocent lives that 
were taken and pray for the families 
and communities that this senseless 
tragedy has affected. I also pray for the 
continued recovery of those wounded in 
the attack, who were in part saved by 
Eli’s decisive actions and also by the 
exceptional response and care of first 
responders. So today, I add my own 
voice to those honoring Eli and express 
my gratitude for his selfless courage.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF WDEL 
RADIO 
∑ Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise 
today on behalf of Delaware’s congres-
sional delegation in honor of the 100th 
anniversary of Delaware’s first radio 
station, WDEL. The station was born 
on July 22, 1922, when amateur radio 
operator and shop owner Willard Wil-
son aired the first news reports and 
music out of his home in Wilmington, 
DE, on what was then WHAV. Over the 
years, the station changed its call let-
ters to WDEL and moved out of Wil-
son’s home to various spaces in down-
town 
Wilmington, 
where 
listeners 
could tune in to hear many famous 
‘‘big bands’’ live from the Gold Ball-
room of the Hotel Du Pont. Today, the 
station has a home on Shipley Road 
and has grown to provide local news, 
talk and traffic reports, with thou-
sands of listeners from Delaware and 
our surrounding States tuning in daily 
to hear from WDEL’s recognizable 
voices on the airwaves. 
Just like our home State’s motto, 
WDEL has been ‘‘first’’ many times 
when it comes to broadcasting. In 1933, 
WDEL became one of the first radio af-
filiates for Major League Baseball, air-
ing the Philadelphia A’s games. Today, 
you can still catch the crack of the bat 
on its signals 101.7 FM or 1150 AM dur-
ing the Philadelphia Phillies season. 
WDEL was also the first in Delaware to 
provide 
real-time, 
locally 
produced 
traffic reports, filling a need when 
other stations weren’t covering the 
busy roads in the Delaware region. The 
station also was one of the first sta-
tions to hire women for on-air posi-
tions when it wasn’t popular to do so. 
Over the years, WDEL has covered 
many historic moments in Delaware, 
including 
Presidential 
visits 
from 
Harry Truman, John Kennedy, Lyndon 
Johnson, Richard Nixon, George W. 
Bush, Barack Obama, and, of course, 
Delaware’s own Joe Biden. WDEL has 
also covered the moments that capture 
the cultural fabric of Delaware, includ-
ing broadcasts from the Greek, Italian, 
and Polish festivals, as well as the Wil-
mington Flower Market, and has a long 
history of giving back to the commu-
nity by supporting Nemours Children’s 
Hospital, 
Ronald 
McDonald 
House, 
Sunday Breakfast Mission, and many 
other children’s charities, shelters, and 
soup kitchens. 
WDEL’s dedication to its listeners 
was awarded numerous times over the 
years. WDEL was named Medium Mar-
ket Station of the Year by the Na-
tional Association of Broadcasters— 
NAB—named News Operation of the 
Year by the Chesapeake AP Broad-
casters Association several times, and 
was honored with the Edward R. Mur-
row 
Award 
for 
Overall 
Excellence 
twice, and the NAB’s prestigious Crys-
tal Award for public service. 
On behalf of both U.S. Senator CHRIS 
COONS
and U.S. Representative LISA 
BLUNT
ROCHESTER, I rise today to 
honor WDEL radio on a century of hard 
work and dedication to serving the 
community. The station that started 
as just one among 100 in the country 
has withstood a century of change and 
innovation and has been recognized as 
among the best in the Nation. We wish 
its employees and listeners many more 
years of this incredible news service on 
the airwaves.∑

after a 48-year career in broadcasting. 
He first joined the WIBW-TV team in 
April 1990 as an anchor for 13 NEWS at 
10. He briefly left WIBW-TV in the fall 
of 1998 for his wife’s job in Tennessee, 
but returned to his anchor desk in To-
peka exactly 2 years later, and has re-
mained a constant at 13 NEWS ever 
since. 
Ralph first thought of retirement 
more than 2 years ago, but when the 
pandemic began, he gladly remained 
part of the 13 NEWS teams to help get 
everyone through the tough times. The 
last 2 years were the most challenging 
and rewarding of Ralph’s entire career 
with WIBW-TV. 
Throughout his career, Ralph has 
hosted various programs and segments 
loved by many in Northeast Kansas. He 
was a longtime host for the Sunday 
night scholastic quiz bowl program 
‘‘High Q,’’ recognized exceptional stu-
dents of all ages in the ‘‘Good Kids’’ 
Tuesday night segment, and has hosted 
hundreds of viewers from the famous 
red couch set since 2006. Hosting this 
program from the red couch has been a 
blessing and joy for him, especially 
throughout the pandemic. Helping peo-
ple in their time of need is what the 
business is all about to Ralph, and the 
Red Couch Program provided him the 
opportunity to be able to help others. 
I now ask my colleagues to join me 
in recognizing the wonderful impact 
Mr. Ralph Hipp has had on the WIBW- 
TV team and to honor him for his 30 
years of serving the families of North-
east Kansas in what he calls ‘‘the best 
job in the world.’’∑

RECOGNIZING HOUSE DOCTORS 
HANDYMAN 
∑
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as rank-
ing member of the Senate Committee 
on Small Business and Entrepreneur-
ship, each week I recognize an out-
standing Kentucky small business that 
exemplifies the American entrepre-
neurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize House Doctors 
Handyman of Hardin County, in Eliza-
bethtown, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
For most people, retirement is the 
clear choice following an illustrious ca-
reer in their chosen field. Franko 
Antolovich, on the other hand, is not 
like most people. After serving in the 
U.S. Army for 35 years, including over 
20 years in the Special Forces, Franko 
took the road less traveled. When 
many would have chosen retirement, 
Franko embarked on a new endeavor, 
swapping his combat boots for work 
boots by becoming the franchise owner 
of House Doctors Handyman of Hardin 
County, KY. 
House Doctors provides top quality 
home repairs and maintenance to resi-
dents of central Kentucky and the sur-
rounding areas. Franko ensures that 
his customers receive exemplary serv-
ice by employing handymen who are 
the best at what they do, with most 
members of his team having years of 
experience in the realm of home repair. 
Franko understands that it takes a 
great amount of trust to employ some-
one to work on your own home. As the 
name House Doctors would imply, each 
employee of this successful franchise 
provides an unrivaled level of care be-
cause they understand that a house is 
more than just a roof over one’s head. 
The repair men and women operating 
at House Doctors treat their cus-
tomers’ homes with as much respect as 
they would treat their own; that is the 
level of quality that Franko and his 
team are committed to providing to 
Central Kentucky. 
House Doctors’ services range from 
one-time maintenance repairs for home 
appliances, 
to 
small 
projects 
like 
drywall installation and repair, all the 
way up to full home remodels. What-
ever the need may be, residents of cen-
tral Kentucky can count on House Doc-
tors to provide the services they need 
for quick and professional home repair. 
In addition to the wide array of serv-
ices they perform, House Doctors offers 
a 1-year labor guarantee for each job 
they perform, proving their steadfast 
commitment to quality craftsmanship. 
This 
commitment 
extends 
beyond 
House Doctors’ policy of a 1-year labor 
guarantee, as Franko ensures that all 
the handymen and women he employs 
are professional, insured, bonded, and 
trained. Residents of central Kentucky 
can achieve full peace of mind knowing 
that the job they have entrusted to 
House Doctors will be completed only 
after the highest standards of quality 
have been met. 
I want to thank Frank Antolovich for 
the service he has paid to this country 
and commend him for his transition 
from Active Duty to being an active 
member in his central Kentucky com-
munity. After putting his mind and 
body to work for our country, he saw a 
franchise opportunity that allowed him 
to work towards the betterment and 
protection of central Kentucky homes. 
It is the level of dedication and service 
that has been a hallmark throughout 
Franko’s life that makes his franchise 
thrive. 
Congratulations 
to 
Franko 
Antolovich and to the entire team at 
House Doctors Handyman of Central 
Kentucky. I look forward to watching 
your continued growth and success in 
Kentucky.∑

13581 OF JULY 24, 2011, WITH RE-
SPECT 
TO 
SIGNIFICANT 
TRANSNATIONAL CRIMINAL OR-
GANIZATIONS—PM 36 
The Presiding Officer laid before the 
Senate the following message from the 
President of the United States, to-
gether with an accompanying report; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on Banking, Housing, and Urban Af-
fairs: 
To the Congress of the United States: 
Section 202(d) of the National Emer-
gencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) provides 
for the automatic termination of a na-
tional emergency unless, within 90 
days prior to the anniversary date of 
its declaration, the President publishes 
in the Federal Register and transmits to 
the Congress a notice stating that the 
emergency is to continue in effect be-
yond the anniversary date. In accord-
ance with this provision, I have sent to 
the Federal Register for publication the 
enclosed notice stating that the na-
tional emergency with respect to sig-
nificant transnational criminal organi-
zations that was declared in Executive 
Order 13581 of July 24, 2011, under which 
additional steps were taken in Execu-
tive Order 13863 of March 15, 2019, is to 
continue in effect beyond July 24, 2022. 
The 
activities 
of 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
have reached such scope and gravity 
that they threaten the stability of 
international political and economic 
systems. Such organizations are be-
coming increasingly sophisticated and 
dangerous to the United States; they 
are increasingly entrenched in the op-
erations of foreign governments and 
the international financial system, 
thereby weakening democratic institu-
tions, degrading the rule of law, and 
undermining economic markets. These 
organizations facilitate and aggravate 
violent civil conflicts and increasingly 
facilitate the activities of other dan-
gerous persons. 
Significant transnational 
criminal 
organizations continue to pose an un-
usual and extraordinary threat to the 
national security, foreign policy, and 
economy of the United States. There-
fore, I have determined that it is nec-
essary to continue the national emer-
gency 
with 
respect 
to 
significant 
transnational criminal organizations 
declared in Executive Order 13581.

SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
715—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE ON THE VALUE OF A 
TAX AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN 
Mr. SASSE (for himself and Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 715 
Whereas Taiwan is a democratic success 
story, an economic success story, a key part 
of global technology supply chains, and a 
close security partner of the United States; 
Whereas the United States has pursued a 
robust unofficial partnership with Taiwan 
within the context of the current one-China 
policy of the United States; 
Whereas the Taiwan Relations Act (Public 
Law 96–8) has played an important role in 
promoting democracy and prosperity in Tai-
wan, peace and security in the Taiwan 
Strait, and close relations between the 
United States and Taiwan since 1979; 
Whereas Taiwan is the eighth-largest trad-
ing partner of the United States, United 
States exports of goods and services to Tai-
wan support at least 188,000 American jobs, 
and Taiwan’s cumulative investment in the 
United States is at least $13,700,000,000; 
Whereas the United States has ongoing 
economic dialogues with Taiwan that cover a 
range of trade, technology, and investment 
issues through the Trade and Investment 
Framework Agreement Council led by the 
United States Trade Representative, the 
U.S.-Taiwan Economic Prosperity Partner-
ship Dialogue led by the Department of 
State, and the Technology, Trade, and In-
vestment Collaboration framework led by 
the Department of Commerce; 
Whereas the Biden Administration an-
nounced the ‘‘U.S.-Taiwan Initiative on 21st 
Century Trade’’ on June 1, 2022; 
Whereas the United States has income tax 
treaties with 66 countries, including the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, and has agreements 
with other parties, including Taiwan, related 
to taxation, such as facilitating implementa-
tion of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance 
Act; 
Whereas Taiwan is the United States’ larg-
est trading partner with whom we do not 
have an income tax treaty; 
Whereas Taiwan has income tax agree-
ments with 34 countries, including countries 
that have trade agreements with the United 
States and do not maintain diplomatic rela-
tions with Taiwan; 
Whereas the United States signed a trans-
portation income tax agreement with Tai-
wan in 1988, under the auspices of the Amer-
ican Institute in Taiwan (AIT) and the Co-
ordination Council for North American Af-
fairs, which has since been renamed as the 
Taipei Economic and Cultural Representa-
tive Office (TECRO); 
Whereas an income tax agreement between 
the United States and Taiwan could boost bi-
lateral trade and investment by reducing 
double taxation and increasing economic ef-
ficiency and integration; and 
Whereas the American Chamber of Com-
merce in Taipei in its ‘‘2022 White Paper’’ 
called for the United States and Taiwan to 
continue exploring an income tax agree-
ment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the importance of Taiwan’s 
security and prosperity to the United States’ 
own security and prosperity; 
(2) encourages the President to begin nego-
tiations on an income tax agreement with 
Taiwan; 
(3) encourages the President and the House 
of Representatives to work with the Senate 
on a congressional-executive agreement to 
establish an income tax agreement between 
the United States and Taiwan, consistent 
with United States commitments under the 
Taiwan Relations Act; and 
(4) encourages the President to proactively 
seek other ways to increase trade, tech-
nology, and investment ties between the 
United States and Taiwan.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3614 
July 21, 2022 
was referred to the Committee on For-
eign Relations: 
S. RES. 717 
Whereas the revolution led by Fidel Castro 
in Cuba in 1959 started 63 years of an ongoing 
dictatorship that systematically violates the 
human rights of the Cuban people, including 
denying them the basic freedoms of press, re-
ligion, assembly, and association; 
Whereas Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as was born 
in Havana, Cuba, in 1952 and became a non-
violent critic of the communist regime as a 
teenager, resulting in 3 years of imprison-
ment in 1969 at a work camp, formerly 
known as ‘‘Isla de Pinos’’, in Cuba; 
Whereas Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as forewent a 
chance to escape Cuba in the 1980 Mariel 
boatlift, deciding instead to continue the 
fight for democracy in Cuba, saying, ‘‘This is 
what I am supposed to be, this is what I have 
to do.’’; 
Whereas, in 1988, Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as 
founded the Christian Liberation Movement 
that called for peaceful civil disobedience 
against the rule of the communist party of 
Cuba and advocated for civil liberties and 
human rights in Cuba; 
Whereas, in 1992, Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as 
announced his intention to run for the Na-
tional Assembly of Popular Power of Cuba 
and collected hundreds of signatures to sup-
port his candidacy, and 2 days before the 
election, was detained by police at his home 
and informed by communist party officials 
to be ineligible to run for office and threat-
ened that ‘‘blood will run’’ if he ran; 
Whereas, in 1998, Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as 
and other leaders of the Christian Liberation 
Movement initiated the Varela Project, the 
largest civil society-led petition in the his-
tory of Cuba, in order to circulate a legal 
proposal to advocate for democratic political 
change within Cuba, including ‘‘convert[ing] 
into law, the right of freedom of speech, the 
freedom of press and freedom of enterprise’’; 
Whereas, in May 2002, the Varela Project 
delivered 11,020 signatures from eligible citi-
zens of Cuba to the National Assembly of 
Popular Power, calling for an end to 4 dec-
ades of one-party rule, to which the com-
munist regime responded by beginning its 
own forced collection of signatures in viola-
tion of its own rules to make Cuba’s socialist 
system ‘‘irrevocable’’, and an additional 
14,000 signatures were added to the Varela 
Project petition in 2003, and 10,000 more sig-
natures were added in 2016; 
Whereas, in March 2003, the crackdown on 
Cuban dissidents by the communist regime 
in Cuba, referred to as the ‘‘Black Spring’’, 
led to the imprisonment of 75 individuals, in-
cluding 40 leaders of the Varela Project and 
25 members of the Christian Liberation 
Movement, and the formation of the Ladies 
in White movement by the wives of the im-
prisoned activists; 
Whereas, in 2003, Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as 
developed a Call for the National Dialogue, 
which collected the contributions of thou-
sands of Cubans inside and outside of Cuba; 
Whereas, in 2006, Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as 
published the ‘‘Todos Cubanos’’ program, 
produced as a result of the National Dialogue 
among Cubans, to achieve peaceful changes, 
to propose a referendum to institutionalize 
human rights, to ensure that the economic 
and social rights of the people of Cuba are re-
spected, to ensure that the people of Cuba 
are not excluded in Cuba, and to establish a 
rule of law; 
Whereas, in 2007, Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as 
called on the National Assembly of People’s 
Power to grant amnesty to nonviolent polit-
ical prisoners and to allow the people of 
Cuba to travel freely without a government 
permit; 
Whereas, in 2011, Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as 
denounced the communist regime of Cuba’s 
false 
liberalization 
for 
not 
recognizing 
human rights and proposed to directly carry 
out a Binding Plebiscite to change the sys-
tem towards democracy and establish a rule 
of law; 
Whereas, on July 22, 2012, Oswaldo Paya´ 
Sardin˜ as and Harold Cepero, a fellow pro-de-
mocracy activist, died in a troubling car 
crash in Granma Province, Cuba, after being 
followed by regime agents of Cuba; 
Whereas the communist regime of Cuba 
has failed to conduct a credible investigation 
into the car crash that led to the death of 
Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as; 
Whereas, according to a report published in 
2015 by the Human Rights Foundation, the 
best available evidence strongly suggests 
that the communist regime of Cuba is di-
rectly responsible for the deaths of Oswaldo 
Paya´ Sardin˜ as and Harold Cepero, evidence 
that was deliberately ignored by the judici-
ary system of Cuba; 
Whereas the trial and conviction of Angel 
Carromero, a youth leader of the People’s 
Party who was visiting Cuba and driving the 
car at the time of the crash, did not include 
testimony from key witnesses, and did not 
resolve questions about whether another car 
was involved or whether Mr. Carromero was 
coerced by the communist regime of Cuba 
into signing a false statement of guilt; 
Whereas, in 2013, a number of United 
States Senators and the Department of State 
called for an impartial, third-party inves-
tigation by the Inter-American Commission 
on Human Rights of the Organization of 
American States into the circumstances sur-
rounding 
the 
death 
of 
Oswaldo 
Paya´ 
Sardin˜ as; 
Whereas Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as has been 
formally recognized in the past for his dedi-
cation to the promotion of human rights and 
democracy, including by receiving the Homo 
Homini Award in 1999, the Sakharov Prize 
for Freedom of Thought in 2002, the W. Aver-
ell Harriman Democracy Award from the 
United States National Democratic Institute 
for International Affairs in 2003, and being 
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by 
Va´lclav Havel, the former President of the 
Czech Republic, in 2005; 
Whereas, in 2012, the United States Senate 
unanimously passed Senate Resolution 525, 
112th Congress, agreed to July 31, 2012, hon-
oring the life and legacy of Oswaldo Paya´ 
Sardin˜ as; 
Whereas, in 2018, the United States Senate 
unanimously passed Senate Resolution 224, 
115th Congress, agreed to April 11, 2018, rec-
ognizing the 6th anniversary of the death of 
Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as, and commemorating 
his legacy and commitment to democratic 
values and principles; 
Whereas, in 2021, the United States Senate 
unanimously passed Senate bill 2045, 117th 
Congress, agreed to July 30, 2021, to des-
ignate the area between the intersections of 
16th Street, Northwest and Fuller Street, 
Northwest and 16th Street, Northwest and 
Euclid Street, Northwest in Washington, 
District of Columbia, as ‘‘Oswaldo Paya´ 
Way’’; 
Whereas, on July 14, 2022, the City of 
Miami, Florida agreed to designate the area 
of LeJeune Avenue, between 11th and 14th 
streets, as ‘‘Oswaldo Paya´ Sardin˜ as Way’’ on 
the eve of the 10th anniversary of his death, 
July 22, 2022; 
Whereas, throughout his life and since his 
death, Oswaldo Paya´
Sardin˜ as, his family, 
and friends endured years of harassment and 
intimidation from the communist regime of 
Cuba for his peaceful, political activism; and 
Whereas, on July 11, 2021, thousands of peo-
ple in Cuba raised their voices against the 63- 
year rule of the communist regime and 
called for the same freedoms Oswaldo Paya´

INDIANA SUMMER 2022 COUNTY 
FAIRS 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, it is summer, 
and Hoosiers all over the great state of Indi-
ana are renewing our proud and long-standing 
tradition of attending our great country fairs. 
County fairs are a time for communities to 
gather, to celebrate, and to encourage young 
Hoosiers in agriculture. 
My team and I have spent our summer at-
tending county fairs across Indiana’s Sixth 
District. We enjoyed ribeye sandwiches in Jef-
ferson County, saw the livestock in Shelby 
and Henry counties, and cooled off with a 
lemon shakeup on Delaware County, among 
the many county fairs in southeast Indiana. 
I hope to see many more constituents at the 
fairs in the weeks ahead and encourage all 
Hoosiers to attend their local county fair and 
the Indiana State Fair, which runs from July 
29 through August 21.

HONORING COMMUNITY BRIDGES 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 45th anniversary of Commu-
nity Bridges and its impact on Santa Cruz 
County. Community Bridges empowers people 
to reach their full potential by providing essen-
tial services and resources. With 10 programs, 
including specific initiatives for Children and 
Nutrition, Family Resources, and Seniors and 
Transportation, this organization serves more 
than 22,000 people a year across Santa Cruz 
County. 
Since 
1977, 
Community 
Bridges, 
also 
known as Puentes de la Comunidad, has pro-
vided invaluable resources to the people I rep-
resent. At 20 locations and outreach sites, its 
efforts make a difference in the lives of sen-
iors, children, and countless families across 
Santa Cruz County, at no cost to the people 
it serves. The organization meets people 
where they are, providing bilingual and cul-
turally competent services, respecting the dig-
nity of those they serve, and helping everyone 
in Santa Cruz County reach their full potential. 
Moreover, it works to uplift the most vulner-
able and historically underrepresented; 76 per-
cent of its clients are people of color, and 
many of its programs are targeted to seniors 
and young families. 
As a true institution in Santa Cruz County, 
Community Bridges has expanded its reach 
through strong connections with countless and 
equally valuable organizations and programs. 
With a guiding principle that together, anything 
is possible, Community Bridges facilitates 
thousands of volunteers to come together and 
serve their neighbors and friends. 
As the Central Coast continues to recover 
from the COVID–19 pandemic, the effects of 
wildfires, and rising living costs, Community 
Bridges plays an invaluable role as a leader in 
our community and a catalyst for positive en-
gagement, recovery, and improvement. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize this impactful organization on the occa-
sion of its 45th anniversary. I extend my ap-
preciation to its committed Board Members 
and team of volunteers that continue to sup-
port the people of Santa Cruz County.

RECOGNIZING CHEF CAROLINE 
GLOVER 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the accomplishments of Chef Caro-
line Glover and congratulate her on receiving 
the 2022 James Beard Award for Best Chef in 
the Mountain Region. 
A Chef with a passion for farming and cook-
ing, Caroline combined both to open Annette: 
Scratch to Table, in the fall of 2016, in Aurora, 
Colorado. Annette is named for her Great 
Aunt Netsie who bestowed upon Caroline the 
need for a strong opinion and confidence in 
her own taste, which would carry her through 
15 years in the restaurant industry. 
A graduate of the Culinary Institute of Amer-
ica in Hyde Park, New York, Caroline devel-
oped her craft working as a sous chef in both 
New York and Denver in critically acclaimed 
restaurants. She has also spent an extensive 
amount of time on farms in Pennsylvania, 
Vermont, and Colorado, honing and devel-
oping her passion for locally-grown food. 
Caroline’s culinary creativity has not gone 
unnoticed. She was recognized as one of the 
‘‘10 Best Chefs in America’’ by Food & Wine 
Magazine in 2019, and Bon Appetit Magazine 
named Annette one of the ‘‘50 Best New Res-
taurants in the Country’’ in 2017. 
The awards don’t stop there. Caroline was 
a finalist for the same James Beard Founda-
tion Award in 2020 after being named a semi-
finalist in 2018 and 2019. This Award is pre-
sented annually to chefs and restaurants in 
the culinary industry who exemplify excep-
tional talent and excellency in their craft— 
alongside a commitment to racial and gender 
equity, sustainability, and community. Caroline 
focuses on sustainability and sourcing locally- 
grown food to honor food producers and nour-
ish eaters in a creative way, and as such, I 
cannot think of a chef more deserving of this 
award. 
Caroline’s culinary contributions to our com-
munity are representative of the extensive and 
diverse selection of food Colorado’s Sixth Dis-
trict has to offer. I congratulate Caroline on 
winning one of the most coveted awards in the 
culinary industry—and I have no doubt this is 
just the start of a long and incredible career.

HONORING EVERETTE B. ‘‘OBIE’’ 
OBENSHAIN, JR. 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Everette B. ‘‘Obie’’ Obenshain, Jr. 
of Salem, Virginia, who passed away on July 
14, 2022, at the age of 82. Obie served the 
City of Salem as sheriff for 30 years. 
Obie was born to Everette B. Obenshain, 
Sr, and Mildred Obenshain. He served as a 
Patrolman for the Salem Police Department 
from November 3, 1966, until July 4, 1969. 
That year, after Salem had become an inde-
pendent city, he was elected city sergeant and 
supervised an office of four deputies. In 1971, 
the Code of Virginia changed and the post be-
came sheriff. He held that position for dec-
ades. From 1981 to 1982, he also served as 
President of the Virginia Sheriffs’ Association. 
In addition to his service as the elected sheriff, 
Obie held an appointment on the Salem Board 
of Elections for nineteen years. 
Obie was an active citizen beyond his roles 
in Salem government. He belonged to the 
Edgewood Lions Club since 1965, the Amer-
ican Legion, and the Salem Sports Founda-
tion. As a proud Republican, he was the first 
member of the party to win a citywide election. 
While he was often encouraged to run as an 
independent when he was on the ballot, he al-
ways ran on the party ticket and supported 
others who did the same. 
I was honored to call Obie a friend. I knew 
him before my law career began and worked 
with him for years, including in his capacity as 
sheriff. During my terms in the Virginia House 
of Delegates, I heard from him often as he 
sought to raise the pay of his deputies. The 
loyalty he showed them was characteristic of 
the man. 
Obie was preceded in death by his wife, 
Hazel. He is survived by son Everette ‘‘EB’’ 
Obenshain III; daughter Susan King; grand-
children Amber Cook (Justin), Sarah Sieloff 
and husband, Jack, Emily Obenshain, Rachel 
Brodrecht and husband, Lawson, Mason King, 
and 
Gia 
King; 
and 
great-granddaughter, 
Haleigh Cook. He is also survived by adoptive 
grandchildren Scott McCauley, wife Amanda, 
and daughter, Braeleigh, Jordan McCauley 
and wife, Alexa, and DeAnna McCauley; and 
many nieces and nephews. I offer them con-
dolences on the loss of a fine man and public 
servant.

RECOGNIZING REBECCA 
LOCKRIDGE 
HON. RASHIDA TLAIB 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, today I want to 
celebrate the life of Rebecca Lockridge, a 
long-time resident of Southwest Detroit in 
Michigan’s 13th District Strong, on the occa-
sion of her one hundredth birthday. 
Mother Rebecca Lockridge was born on 
July 24, 1922 in Columbia, Tennessee, and 
later moved to Detroit, Michigan on February 
9th, 1944 at the age of twenty-two with her 
sister, Martha. She married the love of her life, 
Albert B. Lockridge in 1946, raising five chil-
dren in the home on Prairie Street that they 
bought as newlyweds. Mother Lockridge has 
remained an active and engaged neighbor 
through her work with the Midwest Civic Coun-
cil, where she served as Treasurer for dec-
ades, as well the Tabernacle Missionary Bap-
tist Church. She also served as a career coun-
selor at Chadsey High School for more than 
two decades, guiding our community’s youth 
in their college and career endeavors. Mother 
Lockridge has contributed so much value to 
her community, family, and friends. After her 
retirement, Mrs. Lockridge has maintained her 
good health by participating in a local exercise 
group, cooking healthy meals, and enjoying 
the sun with her friends and family, including 
her four grandchildren, and several great- 
grandchildren. May she continue to shine 
bright, surrounded by love and laughter in the 
years ahead. 
Please join me in wishing a happy 100th 
birthday to Mother Rebecca Lockridge, a par-
agon of Detroit’s perseverance and a figure of 
notable civic service in Michigan’s 13th District 
Strong.

TRIBUTE IN HONOR OF KAREN 
KELLY 
HON. HAROLD ROGERS 
OF KENTUCKY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to pay tribute to Karen Kelly, one 
of the most dynamic female leaders in Ken-
tucky politics, who has worked with me 
through various roles in southern and eastern 
Kentucky over the last 28 years. She has 
served as my District Director for Kentucky’s 
Fifth Congressional District since 2013, and as 
she moves on to the private sector, I want to 
honor her today before my House colleagues 
who understand the immense value of having 
a fierce and loyal leader on the frontlines in 
the district while we are working diligently on 
Capitol Hill for our people at home. 
Karen is the most recent of many incredible 
female leaders that I have been blessed to 
have on staff, starting with my very first Chief 
of Staff in Washington, Marty Driesler. Marty 
was a force of nature and was instrumental in 
many of my early successes in Congress— 
just as Karen Kelly has been in Kentucky for 
nearly three quarters of my tenure in Con-
gress. Much of my staff in Washington and in 
Kentucky have become long-tenured experts 
in their respective fields, providing excellent 
aid to folks across Kentucky’s Appalachian re-
gion, and trusted advisors during my public 
service in the U.S. House of Representa-
tives—and chief among them being Karen 
Kelly. 
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher 
once said, ‘‘If you set out to be liked, you 
would be prepared to compromise on anything 
at any time, and you would achieve nothing.’’ 
As we know well in Congress, the world of 
politics isn’t for weak-minded, spineless indi-
viduals. To be effective, you must stand firm 
on the values you hold dear, even at the risk 
of losing popularity; however, Karen has man-
aged to maintain both. In fact, she has be-
come one of the most highly respected lead-
ers in Kentucky because of her relentless 
commitment to her conservative values and 
her courage of conviction to do what’s best for 
the people of our region, even when the going 
gets tough. 
In 1994, Karen started out answering the 
phones and doing casework in my Pikeville of-
fice, quickly working her way up to become a 
Field Representative in my Hazard office. 
From day one she proved to be a highly moti-
vated and promising visionary with an intense 
work ethic to accomplish any task that I set in 
her path. Soon after, I asked her to lead the 
Eastern Kentucky PRIDE organization, a non- 
profit environmental education and improve-
ment task force to help clean up our hillsides, 
lakes, and streams across Kentucky’s Fifth 
District. She quickly learned the complex 
ropes of grant funding and grew PRIDE’s out-
reach operations in the schools. She also led 
the charge for more water and sewer project 
opportunities with the U.S. Army Corps of En-
gineers and exponentially grew volunteer 
cleanup participation. 
In the early 2000s, I quickly realized that we 
had another crisis to clean up in Eastern Ken-
tucky when a deadly scourge of prescription 
overdose deaths was ignited by a flood of 
overprescribed powerful painkillers in our rural 
region. When I considered the best person to 
give life to this multifaceted response, I tapped 
Karen to take on an unprecedented role and 
lead the nation’s first rural holistic organization 
to combat the growing drug epidemic. To-
gether, we named it Operation UNITE—Un-
lawful Narcotics Investigations, Treatment and 
Education. She formulated my vision into a 
comprehensive task force that become a 
model for the rest of the country—and she 
didn’t stop in Eastern Kentucky. Karen helped 
me coordinate with like-minded leaders in 
Washington on the issue to launch the Na-
tional Rx Drug Abuse Summit, putting Oper-
ation UNITE’s efforts on the national stage. 
We welcomed approximately 750 attendees to 
the first Rx Summit in 2012 in Orlando, Flor-
ida, and today, it is the largest comprehensive 
convention of its kind, with four U.S. Presi-
dents serving as keynote speakers, along with 
leaders from each ofNation’s top agencies on 
illicit drug-related policies. 
Nine years ago, I asked her to return to my 
Congressional office to help me reinvigorate 
and revitalize southern and eastern Kentucky 
just as the coal industry was targeted by a re-
lentless regulatory war that led to the loss of 
more than 12,000 coal mining jobs. During 
that time, she helped me established the bi-
partisan SOAR initiative—Shaping Our Appa-
lachian Region, with former Governor Steve 
Beshear. Her diligent work and coordination 
were invaluable to our early comprehensive 
efforts to formulate and lead the SOAR organi-
zation and gain the trust of our constituents as 
we worked hard to bring jobs and new indus-
try opportunities to the region, including the 
state’s largest rural broadband expansion 
project and much more. 
I often remind folks that our best resource in 
Eastern Kentucky isn’t coal, tobacco, or tim-
ber—it’s our people—and Karen exemplifies 
that. Her sheer determination to improve our 
region through compassionate advocacy and 
excellence in project execution has made a re-
sounding impact across our region. While she 
has rightfully earned recognition and many ac-
colades for her public service, her quiet gen-
erosity behind the scenes is a testament to 
her heart for God. Over the years, she has 
personally taken some of our less fortunate 
youth under her wing, providing support and 
encouragement to help them take hold of their 
own destiny. Today, many of them are now 
following in her footsteps to become the next 
generation of bright young rising leaders. 
I am personally grateful to have had such a 
wonderful leading lady by my side over the 
last 28 years and I wish Karen and her family 
the very best in years to come.

ice of Elmer Lee Davidson who lived 99 ex-
traordinary years before his passing on June 
9, 2022. Mr. Davidson was born February 4, 
1923 to G. Edgar and Minnie Bass Davidson. 
Shortly after the outbreak of WWII, Mr. David-
son and five of his high school buddies literally 
climbed out of a school window to enlist in the 
U.S. Army. At the age of 17, these brave 
young men lied about their age to answer the 
call to fight against the Nazis. Throughout their 
time in Europe, each of Mr. Davidson’s five 
high school best friends lost their lives fighting 
in support of the Allies. 
Elmer’s first taste of battle was near Bizerte, 
Tunisia on October 18, 1943, against the infa-
mous German Field Marshal Johannes Rom-
mel. After their triumph the 933rd departed Tu-
nisia for Naples, Italy. Shortly thereafter, the 
933rd Field Artillery Battalion was merged into 
the 940th Field Artillery Battalion. 
For almost 2 years in direct combat, Elmer 
served as a radio dispatcher/radio technician, 
Technical Sergeant in the 940th Field Artillery 
Battalion, under the command of General 
George Patton and later General Omar Brad-
ley. Elmer was on the front lines in North Afri-
ca, Italy, France, Germany, and Austria. He 
participated in numerous historic battles in-
cluding the breakthrough of the Gustav Line at 
Monte Cassino, one of the bloodiest, costliest, 
and coldest sieges in WWII. For his contribu-
tions, Elmer was awarded the French Croix de 
Guerre Silver Star. Then, the battalion shifted 
direction-to support the Rome Amo Campaign 
for the liberation of Rome, Siena, and Flor-
ence. 
Once 
secured, 
the 
940th 
moved 
to 
Sarreguemines, France in support of the cam-
paign to breach the Siegfried Line and cross

the Rhine River into Germany. Shortly after 
entering Germany, he was witness to the 
shocking 
tragedies 
of 
the 
Mannheim- 
Sandhofen concentration camp. He would also 
support the 45th Infantry Division’s liberation 
efforts at the Dachau concentration camp in 
April 1945. After the surrender of Nazi Ger-
many, Elmer arrived home in Dallas on August 
15, 1945. 
Once retired from the U.S. Army, Mr. David-
son worked at A.H. Belo Corporation news-
paper company for over 43 years, later be-
coming its publisher. Mr. Davidson fully retired 
in 1988 to enjoy life with his beautiful wife 
Frankie. He also received multiple civic 
awards including Citizen of the Year from the 
City of Grand Prairie. Without a doubt, Mr. Da-
vidson lived a life of dedicated service to his 
community and country. 
Madam Speaker, I have shared with the 
House today only a small portion of this hero’s 
life. I have requested the United States flag be 
flown over our Nation’s Capital to recognize 
Elmer Lee Davidson, a member of the great-
est generation. Furthermore, Madam Speaker, 
I extend my personal condolences to the Da-
vidson family for the loss of such an extraor-
dinarily brave and loving man. May God rest 
the soul of this great American.

HONORING 
ORLI 
SHEFFEY 
AND 
SHEDDING LIGHT ON THE MEN-
TAL HEALTH CRISIS 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I am 
here to shed light on the unprecedented men-
tal health crisis that is devastating countless 
families, including many in my own commu-
nity. 
Earlier this year, I attended the funeral of 
Orli Sheffey, an outstanding young constituent, 
and the daughter of my dear friend Steve 
Sheffey. She passed away at the age of 19 as 
a result of mental illness—an invisible illness 
that far too many Americans confront. I rise to 
honor Orli today. In Hebrew, Orli means ‘‘my 
light,’’ and Orli was a light to so many. She 
was a daughter, a sister, a classmate, and a 
friend, and while her time on this Earth was 
brief, her impact is lasting. 
It is clear that we must confront the nation-
wide mental health crisis. Too many people 
feel like they are in darkness. Too many peo-
ple feel alone and ashamed. And too many 
people cannot find the resources and health 
care that they need. According to reports, 4 in 
10 Americans report suffering from anxiety or 
depression. It’s not hard to see why. Ameri-
cans have been forced to deal with a dev-
astating pandemic, mass shootings, racial in-
justice, and increasing hate crimes and intoler-
ance. 
Congress and the Biden-Harris Administra-
tion recognize this crisis. I am proud that we 
passed the Dr. Lorna Breen Health Care Pro-
vider Protection Act, to improve mental health 
resources for healthcare workers. I am grateful 
that the 9–8–8 suicide and crisis lifeline is now 
LIVE. I urge anyone who is struggling with a 
mental health crisis to call the 9–8–8 lifeline. 
And we need to make sure that the resources 
that Congress has already created are known 
and easily accessible. In 2016, my bill, the 
Mental Health on Campus Act was enacted 
through an appropriations package. It created 
a grant program to ensure that colleges and 
universities could provide vital mental health 
resources for students. We must make sure 
students can access these resources and do 
not feel ashamed or stigmatized for doing so. 
There is much more work to be done. 
It is critical at this moment that we honor 
Orli. Part of what we can do is to work to 
shine light on this crisis. I will never stop fight-
ing to ensure that the mental health needs of 
our communities are met.

CELEBRATING POSSE LOS 
ANGELES’ 20TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Posse Los Angeles on their 20th An-
niversary. 
Posse 
Los 
Angeles 
is 
headquartered in California’s 34th Congres-
sional District and is the Pacific Coast branch 
of the national Posse Foundation. The Posse 
Foundation was founded in 1989 and is dedi-
cated to identifying and supporting public high 
school students with extraordinary academic 
and leadership potential who may be over-
looked by traditional college selection proc-
esses. 
The Foundation extends to students the op-
portunity to pursue personal achievement and 
academic excellence by placing them in sup-
portive, multicultural teams (‘‘Posses’’). 
Since 2002, Posse Los Angeles has se-
lected numerous talented and diverse leaders 
to attend some of the nation’s top colleges 
and universities. Posse Scholars are awarded 
full-tuition merit scholarships and begin a life-
long relationship with The Posse Foundation 
that will see them through to graduation and 
help them become leaders in the workforce. 
Today, I am proudly share that the Posse 
Foundation has identified, recruited, and 
trained more than 10,000 students with ex-
traordinary academic and leadership potential, 
and has been recognized as one of the most 
comprehensive college success and leader-
ship development initiatives in the country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring and celebrating Posse Los An-
geles on their 20th Anniversary and in wishing 
them continued success for years to come.

which celebrated its centennial on January 4, 
2022. Founded 100 years ago, the Granite 
Construction Company is one of our Nation’s 
largest civil infrastructure contractors and con-
struction materials producers. 
Pieces of its legacy came together in 1900 
when John T. Porter, his son Warren, and A. 
R. Wilson partnered to buy the Logan Quarry 
and form the Granite Rock Company in 
Watsonville, California. 
By 1922, the Granite Construction Company 
branched out as a wholly owned subsidiary. 
And since its founding, it has been guided by 
five core values: safety, integrity, excellence, 
inclusion, and sustainability. In 1990, Granite 
Construction Company entered the public mar-
ket and reached the $1 billion mark in annual 
revenues by the end of the decade. Over the 
past century, the company has expanded its 
projects across the United States, including 
the California Aqueduct system, highways for 
the 1960 and 1996 Olympic Games, transit 
projects in San Francisco and Oakland, Cali-
fornia and Washington, D.C., as well as the 
remarkable rebuilding of the World Trade Cen-
ter in New York City, New York. 
Granite Construction Company and its de-
voted staff, which includes thousands of Cen-
tral Coast community members, have created 
an innovative culture and exceptional team 
that delivers excellence for clients across the 
United States. Since 1922, the company has 
driven the creation of vital infrastructure that 
millions of people use every day. Granite Con-
struction Company is one of the largest diver-
sified construction and construction materials 
companies in the country, as well as a full- 
suite provider in the transportation, water infra-
structure, and mineral exploration markets. 
Granite 
Construction 
Company’s 
head-
quarters in Watsonville is a source of pride for 
the Central Coast and has been for the past 
100 years. Granite Construction Company 
contributes to California’s 20th Congressional 
District’s social, economic, and environmental 
success by providing career opportunities, op-
erating ethically and responsibly, and engag-
ing meaningfully for positive social impact. 
In addition to being an industry leader in 
safety and sustainability, Granite Construction 
is dedicated to diversity from the top down. Its 
diverse board of directors includes three 
women, and its Granite Resources and Oppor-
tunities for Women initiative is committed to 
supporting women in a typically male-domi-
nated industry. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to com-
memorate this company that has grown into 
one of our Nation’s largest civil infrastructure 
contractors and construction materials pro-
ducers. I extend my appreciation to Granite 
Construction and its team members, sub-
contractors, suppliers, and partners for cre-
ating an innovative culture and exceptional 
team that delivers excellence for our national 
infrastructure.

RECOGNIZING MR. WILLIAM J. 
PEREZ 
HON. NORMA J. TORRES 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mrs. TORRES of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to honor Mr. William J. Perez 
on the occasion of his retirement after more 
than 47 years in the construction industry. 
After decades of leadership and supporting In-
land Empire labor unions and helping to grow 
our economy, the Southern California commu-
nity owes a debt of gratitude to Mr. Perez for 
his work. 
Mr. Perez’s career began in 1975 in an 
electrician apprenticeship program, and he 
graduated in 1979 from the program as a 
Journeyman Electrician. In 1995, Mr. Perez 
became a Business Manager for the Inter-
national Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 
Local Union 440—a position he held for 11 
years. His expertise and experience as a fore-
man, general foreman, estimator, prevailing 
wage compliance director, and organizer 
made him an invaluable member of local 
unions and the construction industry. He also 
served as the President of the California State 
Association of Electrical Workers and Presi-
dent of the I.B.E.W–NECA Statewide Joint Ap-
prenticeship Committee. 
Since 2007, Mr. Perez has worked as the 
Executive Secretary-Business Manager for the 
Building and Construction Trades Council of 
San 
Bernardino 
& 
Riverside 
Counties. 
Through his role within the Council, Mr. Perez 
assisted with the representation of over 
16,000 skilled craft workers—represented by 
31 local construction unions and district coun-
cils in the Inland Empire. Mr. Perez’s dedica-
tion to the working families and workers’ rights 
is reflected in his current position as a board 
member for the State of California Building 
and Construction Trades Council, AFL–CIO. 
Bill’s dedication to his career is also re-
flected in his commitment to his family and his 
community. Bill has been married for over 30 
years to his wife. They have two children and 
four grandchildren. 
For his remarkable accomplishments, it is 
my honor to recognize William J. Perez. His 
decades of supporting the labor union commu-
nity and the working families of the Inland Em-
pire are worthy of the highest commendation.

TRIBUTE TO JESSE CHARLES 
ROMERO 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise in honor of Jesse Charles Romero 
who passed away on July 6, 2022. Mr. Ro-
mero dedicated his life to advancing minority 
rights and equal justice under the law. He is 
survived by his wife, Anna Alicia Romero, and 
sons Emiliano Sandino, Antonio Cesar, and 
Victor Aetius Emmanuel. 
Jesse Charles Romero was born in Corpus 
Christi, Texas on November 4, 1960, to Juan 
Leos Romero and Amelia Ramirez Romero. 
Mr. Romero was a first-generation college stu-
dent, earning his Bachelor of Arts degree from 
Southwest Texas State University. During his 
early career with the Texas State Legislature, 
he worked to address systemic inequalities 
facing minority groups, particularly among His-
panic and Latinos. Throughout his life, he held 
an enduring belief that inequality and injustice 
can be resolved through legislative solutions 
and hard work. 
Later, as a grassroots organizer, Mr. Ro-
mero worked at the Southwest Voter Registra-
tion Education Project, where he grew under 
the mentorship of voting rights activists includ-
ing Willie Velasquez, Antonio Gonzalez, and 
Andy Hernandez. As his career progressed, 
he served as Director of the Mexican Amer-
ican Legislative Caucus and a Policy Analyst 
for the Mexican American Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund (MALDEF), where he cham-
pioned equitable public school funding, college 
access, and healthcare for all. Some of his 
most rewarding work was in bilingual and dual 
language advocacy. Mr. Romero employed the 
motto, ‘‘educate, collaborate and advocate’’ 
and fought to improve education for non- 
English speakers. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to recognize 
the life and legacy of Jesse Charles Romero. 
I thank Mr. Romero for his many years of pub-
lic service and advocacy for a more equitable 
world. He will be missed, but the contributions 
he made to our community have left a lasting 
impact.

CONGRATULATING 
GEORGE 
W. 
WALDROP, 
SR. 
ON 
HIS 
100TH 
BIRTHDAY 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate George W. Waldrop, Sr., 
World War II veteran of Lancaster County, on 
the occasion of his 100th birthday and to wish 
him a joyous birthday celebration. 
Mr. Waldrop was born on July 26, 1922, in 
Greenville, South Carolina to Claude Furman 
Waldrop and Lola Elizabeth Waldrop. He at-
tended the Greenville city schools and grad-
uated from the high school in 1940. He then 
began work at the Ottaray Hotel and the 
Poinset Hotel, both in Greenville, South Caro-
lina. 
On February 13, 1943, Mr. Waldrop married 
Harriet Louise Sistare. Throughout their 73 
years of marriage, the pair raised two children, 
George W. Waldrop, Jr., and Harriett Waldrop 
Strom, and were blessed with four grand-
children. 
On July 15, 1943, Mr. Waldrop was sworn 
into the United States Army at Fort Jackson 
where he trained as a combat infantryman. He 
courageously served the nation during World 
War II in the European Theatre and partici-
pated in combat in the Ardennes, the Rhine-
land, and Central Europe, including the Battle 
of the Bulge. 
As a testament to his fearless service, Mr. 
Waldrop was awarded the World War II Vic-
tory Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, the 
American Theater Ribbon, the EAME Theater 
Ribbon, and three Bronze Service Stars. 
He authored What ‘‘Poppy’’ Did in The War 
or as I Remember It, recounting his experi-
ences serving in many locations during World 
War II. Mr. Waldrop is also a lifetime member 
of the American Legion Post 31 and is the old-
est member of that American Legion post. 
I am pleased to congratulate George W. 
Waldrop, Sr. on his life of service and sac-
rifice, and I wish him a very joyous 100th 
birthday celebration among his family and 
friends.

HONORING INDIANA STATE 
REPRESENTATIVE TOM SAUNDERS 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
honor State Representative Tom Saunders. 
Representative Saunders is retiring after near-
ly three decades of public service, and I am 
proud to join Hoosiers in celebrating a friend 
who has had an immeasurable impact on our

During his time of service, he had the honor

Award from the Indiana Department of the 
American legion. 
Representative Tom Saunders has long 
served as a distinguished voice on behalf of 
the people of Henry County and our entire 
state. He worked hard to bring greater eco-
nomic opportunity to Hoosiers and was a 
strong advocate for the improvement of local 
schools. 
Therefore, Madam Speaker, I rise to honor 
State Representative Tom Saunders, wish him 
an enjoyable retirement, and to thank him for 
his many years of public service.

HONORING JAMES RUFUS REED OF 
JASPER, ALABAMA 
HON. ROBERT B. ADERHOLT 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. ADERHOLT. Madam Speaker, today I 
would like to recognize and honor the life of 
James Rufus Reed of Jasper, AL after his 
passing on June 4, 2022. Rufus Reed’s dedi-
cation to his work, community, family, and es-
pecially his faith, serves as an example to us 
all of the love we should share for each other 
and those we hold dear to our hearts. 
James Rufus Reed was born on August 21, 
1940 in Cordova, Alabama. He attended Cor-
dova High School, and upon his graduation in 
1959, he went on to attend Walker College. 
Mr. Reed began working for the Alabama 
Power Company as an electrician, and retired 
as a Safety Specialist after 29 long years. 
Alongside his career serving the customers 
of Alabama Power, Mr. Reed served as a 
trustee for his alma mater, Cordova High 
School, where he dedicated his time to im-
proving the lives of young people. 
He also served on the Walker County Civil 
Service Board where he was committed to 
bettering the community that he called home. 
We will always humbly remember Mr. Reed’s 
service to Walker County and Alabama’s 
Fourth Congressional District. 
Most importantly, Mr. Reed was also a de-
voted servant of the Lord. He served as a 
deacon at Cordova First Baptist Church, and 
later as deacon at Jasper’s First Baptist 
Church. In his efforts to teach the Word, he 
faithfully led Sunday School and served as a 
devout leader in the church throughout the 
years. 
Mr. Reed was preceded in death by his 
grandparents, Joe and Alma Reed and Marion 
and Susannah Wylie; and his parents, Leigh-
ton and Mendie Reed. 
He is survived by his wife of 60 years, Patsy 
Collier Reed, who was his constant com-
panion.; Rufus had two wonderful children, 
Alabama State Senator Greg Reed, who mar-
ried, Mitsy; and Angie Reed Lum, who married 
George. His great legacy will also be cher-
ished by his grandchildren, Andrew Reed; 
James Reed; John Michael Reed and his wife, 
Kalei Woodley Reed; Reed Lum; and his sib-
lings, Doris Vines, Wilson Reed, Kay Williams, 
and Darlene Bell. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that you join me in 
celebrating the life of James Rufus Reed and 
the love he shared for his community, his 
state, his family, and especially for his faith.

RECOGNIZING CHIEF FERNANDO 
GRAY OF AURORA FIRE RESCUE 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize the accomplishments of Fire Chief 
Fernando Gray of Aurora Fire Rescue, and to 
congratulate him on his upcoming retirement 
from the City of Aurora. 
During his five exemplary years with Aurora 
Fire Rescue, Chief Gray remained dedicated 
to serving our community. He has surpassed 
expectations—striving to meet any and all 
challenges with innovative approaches and 
best practices, while emphasizing personnel 
safety. 
As Aurora Fire Rescue’s first Black fire 
chief, Gray was instrumental in recruiting more 
minority firefighters to the department, reflect-
ing the diverse community it serves. Faced 
with an unprecedented pandemic, fire depart-
ments across the country were forced to re-
structure their operations almost instanta-
neously—a 
feat 
Chief 
Gray 
tackled 
seamlessly. He worked with the Colorado At-
torney General’s office to implement a consent 
decree agreement to restore public confidence 
in Aurora’s public safety personnel after Elijah 
McClain was killed. 
Chief Gray is a life-long public servant com-
mitted to making our community a better and 
safer place through his work in the fire serv-
ice. Prior to his appointment as Fire Chief for 
the City of Aurora, Chief Gray worked for the 
City of Dallas for over 20 years—serving in 
nearly every capacity within the organization 
except Fire Chief. Further, city leadership af-
firms that Chief Gray’s commitment to profes-
sionalism in the fire service is unmatched, and 
I have no doubt the City of Aurora has bene-
fited greatly from his exemplary leadership. 
Chief Gray’s contributions to our community, 
Aurora Fire Rescue, and those around him 
have been enormous. I thank Chief Gray for 
his service to this community, and wish him 
the best on his next journey serving the Las 
Vegas community.

SPEECH OF 
HON. GWEN MOORE 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Tuesday, July 19, 2022 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Mr. Chair, I rise 
today in support of H.R. 8294, legislation that 
would authorize appropriations for Fiscal Year 
2023 for a number of federal agencies and 
programs, including the Department of Hous-
ing and Urban Development, or HUD. 
I want to thank Chairwoman DELAURO and 
Chairman PRICE, among others, for their sup-
port and leadership in putting together this 
strong package. While there are many good 
provisions in this package, I want to take a 
moment to highlight one of the key victories 
for our communities. 
Americans nationwide have faced difficulties 
finding affordable housing long before the start 
of the COVID–19 pandemic, but the pandemic 
has exacerbated an existing crisis. As rent in-
creases and wages stay stagnant, many mem-
bers of our communities are facing the threat 
of homelessness. 
Without stable housing, children face chal-
lenges in school, adults struggle to maintain 
employment, and those battling physical and 
mental health disorders, as well as substance 
abuse, lack the support they need to ade-
quately address and treat these issues. 
According to the Housing and Urban Devel-
opment 2021 Annual Assessment Report, the 
number of sheltered individuals that identified 
as chronically homeless increased by 20 per-
cent between 2020 and 2021. The report also 
identified that more than 326,000 people are 
still experiencing sheltered homelessness in 
the United States on any given night. Home-
less Assistance Grants, like the Continuum of 
Care and the Emergency Solutions grants, 
help people who are at risk of or are currently 
experiencing homelessness through non-prof-
its, 
community 
organizations, 
government 
agencies, or other providers. These programs 
are successfully used by state and local gov-
ernments, as well as an extensive network of 
providers of shelter and housing services in 
hundreds of communities, to reduce home-
lessness. 
I am delighted that the package that passed 
the House would provide $3.6 billion for the 
Department of Housing and Urban Develop-
ment’s McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance 
Grants program. Earlier this year, I led a letter, 
signed by 140 of my colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle, urging the inclusion of that 
amount. 
McKinney-Vento 
Homeless 
Assistance 
Grants, like the Continuum of Care grant, 
have a profound impact on our communities, 
including my own city of Milwaukee. According 
to the City of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee Con-
tinuum of Care was able to track a 77 percent 
decrease in people experiencing chronic 
homelessness over the last 10 years. This de-
crease was made possible through robust fed-
eral funding of supportive housing programs to 
end homelessness, including the Homeless 
Assistance Grants program. 
Given the lack of affordable housing across 
the Nation and the ongoing effects of the

FARM BILL IMPACT SERIES NO. 13 
HON. TRACEY MANN 
OF KANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. MANN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
deliver the 13th installment of my Farm Bill Im-
pact Series during a time when the effects of 
a poor wheat harvest in Kansas are only com-
pounded by crushing inflation. 
This is insult added to injury for Kansas 
wheat farmers. Producers are laboring under 
the burden of skyrocketing input costs while 
they work hard to keep our country fed, 
fueled, and clothed, and they deserve work-
able solutions to this inflation crisis before the 
situation gets any worse. Farming is already a 
risky, volatile business without the added bur-
den of inflation, and USDA estimates that 
input costs will continue to rise to astronomical 
rates throughout 2022. 
For an example of the risk and volatility— 
the wheat harvest just ended in Kansas, and 
the results were a fraction of the yield that 
farmers in the Wheat State hope for and bank 
on during normal seasons. The Farm Bill 
(which Congress will reauthorize in 2023) ex-
ists, in part, specifically for situations like this 
past wheat season—to provide emergency as-
sistance to the people who feed, fuel, and 
clothe the world even when mother nature 
doesn’t cooperate. 
The weather in Kansas can be extreme and 
unpredictable, which means that growing 
wheat in the wheat state can be a very difficult 
prospect sometimes. I had an intern in my of-
fice this summer named Parker Vulgamore 
who is a rising senior at Kansas State Univer-
sity where he serves as the student body 
president. He is also a member of the sixth 
generation of his family farm in Scott City, 
which lies in my district. Vulgamore Family 
Farms is a wheat, corn, and sorghum oper-
ation, with wheat being a staple. This year, 
due to an exceptional drought and extreme 
conditions throughout the growing season, 
much of the wheat never grew past three 
inches tall. So, what is typically a highly antici-
pated three-to-four-week wheat harvest only 
lasted a day and a half. Many wheat farmers 
in Kansas barely even ran their combines this 
year—they harvested what they could, cut 
their losses, and moved on. 
This is where Farm Bill emergency assist-
ance programs like crop insurance come in. 
Crop insurance serves producers and con-
sumers alike because it helps prevent pro-
ducers from going out of business and grocery 
store aisles from sitting empty. Farm Bill pro-
grams like crop insurance have secured our 
national food supply and helped generation 
after generation of producers avoid bankruptcy 
when times get tough. We’re in one of those 
times right now. Inflation is skyrocketing in 
America, President Biden is trying to impose 
his Farm Killer Tax, and producers are going 
out of business. The chance to reauthorize the 
Farm Bill for 2023 has come at a critical mo-
ment in time. 
The farm crisis isn’t just about money. It’s 
about morale and spirit. It’s about joy. Missing 
wheat harvest time in Kansas doesn’t just 
mean missing out on the yield of a cash 
crop—it means missing out on the special 
Kansas tradition of celebrating the culmination 
of all your family’s hard work. It means miss-
ing out on grandma’s casserole in the harvest 
field and missing out on seeing your mom in 
the semi, your dad in the combine, and your 
little brother getting to drive the grain cart for 
the first time. A bad wheat harvest in Kansas 
doesn’t just create financial insecurity, it also 
leaves a void where a renewal of family cama-
raderie should be. American agricultural pro-
ducers are hurting not only from the sky-
rocketing input costs that come with inflation, 
but also from the lowered morale that comes 
with drought, thin margins, and a broken sup-
ply chain. In 2023, Congress must reauthorize 
the Farm Bill with American farm families at 
the front of our minds, because they are in a 
crisis. 
I’ll be back on the floor soon to deliver an-
other installment of my Farm Bill Impact Se-
ries and highlight more programs and titles 
within the Bill that I believe Congress must un-
derstand and support to ensure that agri-
culture thrives in America. The people who 
feed, fuel, and clothe us all deserve our un-
wavering support. They also deserve a robust 
safety net in the Farm Bill and workable solu-
tions to the inflation crisis before it’s too late. 
HONORING DAVID KELLER 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in celebration of David Keller as he re-
tires from the Friends of the Eel River (FOER) 
Board of Directors after 21 years of service. 
Mr. Keller has long been committed to envi-
ronmental stewardship and public service. 
During his tenure on the FOER board, he 
played a key role as an advocate for critical 
community projects and restoration initiatives, 
and as an expert on watershed and coastal 
programs. 
Mr. Keller graduated from the City College 
of New York in 1967 cum laude, Phi Beta 
Kappa, with a BA in Psychology and Soci-
ology, and completed his graduate degree in 
Social Psychology at the University of Michi-
gan in 1969. His passion for woodworking 
brought him to Northern California, and since 
1976, he has been the manufacturer of his 
own specialized woodworking tools, the Keller 
Dovetail System. 
Mr. Keller’s public service precedes his time 
on the FOER board. He served on the 
Petaluma City Council from 1996 to 2000. In 
this role, he helped pioneer the first U.S. 
adoption of form-based building codes for 
downtown redevelopment and led the defeat 
of the first full privatization of a municipal 
wastewater treatment plant in the U.S., which 
resulted in a city-owned wetland-based treat-
ment facility. He also was a strong advocate 
for utility ratepayer protections in community 
choice aggregation programs. In addition to 
his service on the city council, Mr. Keller also 
served as an elected member of the Bolinas 
Fire Protection District Board of Directors, the 
Sonoma County Conservation Action Board of 
Directors, and is the founder and former Direc-
tor of the Petaluma River Council. He also 
served on the Bolinas Lagoon Technical Advi-
sory Committee where he led the campaign to 
reconstruct the Bolinas beach and groin after 
a 1982 storm disaster. 
Mr. Keller’s vast and successful service to 
the community was invaluable during his ten-
ure on the FOER Board. After two years as a 
general board member, Mr. Keller took on the 
role of FOER Bay Area Director in 2003. He’s 
worked tirelessly for dam removal on the Rus-
sian River, salmonid fisheries and watershed 
restoration, resolving inter-basin water transfer 
conflicts. and to help transform the defunct 
North Coast Railroad’s line to the Great Red-
wood Trail. Mr. Keller also played a role on 
the Potter Valley Project Ad Hoc Committee 
where he represented Eel River interests to 
ensure the protection of salmon and steelhead 
populations. 
Madam Speaker, David Keller exemplifies 
what it means to be a community-minded pub-
lic servant and environmental steward. His 
dedicated service both in the City of Petaluma 
and to the Friends of the Eel River has played 
a significant role in community action and en-
vironmental stewardship in the North Bay. 
Therefore, please join us in congratulating him 
for decades of inspiring work and in wishing 
him a fulfilling and relaxing retirement.

Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Decatur County and its county seat, 
Greensburg, Indiana, in its Bicentennial cele-
bration. Decatur County and the wonderful city 
of Greensburg were founded in the year of 
1822 by veterans and war heroes of the war 
of 1812, and still stand today as a model 
county and city. 
Decatur County is known for its Hoosier 
hospitality, industry, art filled streets, and rich 
history. Decatur County and the city of 
Greensburg will long stand as a beacon of 
hope, from the communities filled with hospi-
tality to the famous ‘‘Tree City’’ courthouse. 
Madam Speaker, today I honor Decatur 
County on its historic bicentennial.

AWARENESS 
MONTH 
HON. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Bebe Moore Campbell National 
Minority Mental Health Awareness Month. 
The COVID–19 pandemic brought on an un-
precedented number of mental health issues 
for Americans across the nation. However, 
America has been dealing with a crisis for 
years. 
This is particularly true for youth of color. 
Black children under the age of 12 are dying 
by suicide at twice the rate of their White 
peers. Suicide is the leading cause of death 
for Asian Pacific Islander youth ages 12 to 19 
years old. 
That is why I am proud to have introduced 
H. Res. 1217, urging mental health resources 
be provided for adolescents of color. 
Similarly, I am proud to see that as of this 
past week, Americans can finally use the na-
tionwide 988 Lifeline. 
This will afford everyone in need 24/7 con-
fidential support if they are experiencing suici-
dal or mental-health related stress. 
Despite this stride forward in our fight to ac-
cessible mental health care, there are still sys-
temic and institutional barriers to our children 
of color. Already, the lack of cultural under-
standing and competency by health care pro-
viders cause many to delay or forgo treatment 
and leads to ‘underdiagnosis’. 
We must commit to saving the lives of our 
children.

Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize The 75th Anniversary 
of the Bynum Baptist Church located in 
Bynum, Alabama. 
The Bynum Baptist Church began organiza-
tion on a Sunday afternoon on September 14, 
1947 at Bynum Community Building, Desoto

The members of the Organizing Presbytery 
consisted of: Dr. B. Locke Davis, Pastor, 
Parker Memorial Baptist Church in Anniston;

Bro. Ben Sawyer, Deacon, Parker Memorial 
Baptist Church; Bro. Fred B. Bryant, Deacon, 
Parker Memorial Baptist Church and Bro. S.L. 
Johnson, Moderator, Deacon, Parker Memorial 
Baptist Church. 
The church was organized with a charter 
membership of 37 Baptists living in and near 
the Bynum Community who desired to orga-
nize a church. Today the church’s pastor is 
Rev. Benjie K. Miller. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing this milestone for Bynum Baptist 
Church.

HONORING 
THE 
175TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE CITY OF TAYLOR, 
MICHIGAN 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in honor of the 175th Anniversary of the 
City of Taylor, Michigan, located in the 
Downriver area of Metro Detroit. The City of 
Taylor is strong and resilient—just like their 
residents. The city offers beautiful recreation 
areas, excellent educational opportunities, and 
a strong sense of community. Their nearly two 
centuries of excellence are worthy of com-
mendation. 
Named after former President Zachary Tay-
lor, the city began as a small township. In the 
city’s early days, it was part of Ecorse Town-
ship, but residents of the area found they were 
too spread out to fully participate in the nec-
essary civic functions. Because of this, resi-
dents petitioned to form a separate commu-
nity, which was approved in 1847. For what 
started as an agricultural area, Taylor has 
flourished into a diverse city of many indus-
tries and opportunities. Residents of Taylor 
can live, work, and shop all within a twenty- 
four square mile area. The city is well con-
nected to the rest of Metro Detroit through 
highways and is just east of the Detroit Metro-
politan Airport. As they say: ‘‘all roads lead to 
Taylor.’’ 
Taylor’s talented residents are employed at 
various medical centers, retail locations, and 
transportation practices, providing essential 
services to the entire Downriver community. 
The city is home to the Taylor High School, 
Taylor Prep Charter High School, Trillium 
Academy, and the Downriver campus of 
Wayne County Community College where stu-
dents thrive. Natives of Taylor include famous 
athletes, actors, and musicians—there is no 
shortage of talent coming from this city. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the City of Taylor as they cele-
brate 175 fantastic years. Although much has 
changed over the years, the sense of resil-
ience and community that is found in Taylor 
has never changed. We wish Mayor Tim 
Woolley and the entire Taylor community the 
very best during this time of recognition and 
celebration.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
PROFESSOR JOHN F. STACK, JR. 
HON. MARIO DIAZ-BALART 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, it is 
with a heavy heart I rise today to commemo-
rate a true academic scholar, Mr. John F. 
Stack, Jr. whose commitment to democracy in 
international and public affairs at the Florida 
International University has left an impression-
able mark on the community and on me. 
John began his career in 1976, as an in-
structor and shortly after Chair of the Depart-
ment of Political Science at FIU and remained 
committed throughout his tenure to advancing 
FIU’s core mission in providing high-quality 
teaching, state-of-the-art research, and col-
laborative engagement with our local and 
global communities. FIU’s College of Law is 
credited in large part to John’s leadership as 
Chair of the College of Law initiative in 2000 
and his devotion to the rule of law in remain-
ing part of the faculty for the past two dec-
ades. As if establishing a Law School wasn’t 
enough, Professor Stack additionally served 
as the founding Director of the Jack D. Gor-
don Institute for Public Policy and as the 
founding Dean of the Steven J. Green School 
of International and Public Affairs. 
Due in large part to his determination and 
vision for FIU, John led FIU to many firsts and 
has impacted thousands of students along the 
way. Under his leadership at FIU’s Green 
School of International and Public Affairs, 
South Florida made history as the first univer-
sity in Florida to achieve the designation of 
Association of Professional Schools of Inter-
national Affairs, one of only 40 globally. 
Throughout his extraordinary career, he has 
received numerous awards, including Doctor 
of Humane Letters in 2018 presented by his 
alma mater, Stonehill College. Among John’s 
proudest moment was leading and advising 
FIU’s Model UN team to rank Number 1 in the 
North American College Model U.N. Cham-
pionship in 2019, a first in FIU history. 
John was more than a professor; he be-
came a personal mentor to me as well as to 
my Chief of Staff, Cesar Gonzalez. Before I 
began my professional career a friend rec-
ommended that I sit down with John to dis-
cuss my future. Although I was not one of

me to consider public service. Though he con-
sidered public service demanding, he implored 
on me that there is no greater honor than 
serving your neighbor, community, country 
and fellow man. I am forever grateful for his 
mentorship and guidance throughout my time 
in public service. 
While the loss of John marks a sad day for 
FIU and South Florida, his legacy will remain. 
I am fortunate to have had the privilege of 
working with such a talented and honorable in-
dividual. 
Madam Speaker, I am honored to pay trib-
ute to my dear friend and mentor, Mr. John F.

dedication to higher education and public serv-
ice, and I ask my fellow colleagues to join me

HONORING DIANE WINSTON 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Diane Garner Winston of Wytheville, 
who passed away on July 7, 2022. 
Mrs. Winston was born in Norfolk, Virginia, 
on December 31, 1928, to George Hayden 
Garner and Vera Duke Garner. She earned a 
bachelor’s degree in medical technology from 
the Medical College of Virginia, now Virginia 
Commonwealth University School of Medicine. 
She married William Overton Winston and 
they raised four children. 
God and country were foundational in Mrs. 
Winston’s life. She was an active member of 
Draper’s Valley Presbyterian Church. During 
World War II, she volunteered in Norfolk as an 
airplane spotter and nurse’s aide. The faith 
and patriotism of individuals such as Mrs. Win-
ston have often been the stable and steady 
pillars holding up families and communities 
across our land. 
Mrs. Winston was preceded in death by her 
husband and a son, David C. Winston. Sur-
vivors include son Stephen Winston (Sandi); 
daughters Mary Blount (Tyler) and Rebecca 
Brewbaker (Bill); twelve grandchildren; and 
sixteen great-grandchildren. I offer them my 
condolences on their loss.

recognize the Liberian Association of Michigan 
as they gather to celebrate the one hundred 
seventy-fifth anniversary of Liberia’s independ-
ence and the contributions of Liberian Ameri-
cans to Michigan and the 13th Congressional 
District Strong. 
Founded in 1971, the Liberian Association

numerous 
events 
throughout the year, including African Heritage 
and Liberian Independence celebrations, as 
well as events that give back to the commu-
nity, such as Thanksgiving and Back to School 
programs. 
Beyond hosting numerous charitable and 
social events, Liberian Association of Michigan 
is ‘‘Doing the Right Thing for the Right Rea-
son,’’ the theme of this year’s annual celebra-
tion, in its outreach and support to recent im-
migrants to our country. The Association and 
its members have created a welcoming space 
for new residents, while providing social and 
economic support. I commend their incredibly 
valuable work and I am incredibly proud of the 
Liberian Association of Michigan’s many con-
tributions to our richly diverse communities. 
Please join me in recognizing the Liberian 
Association of Michigan as they celebrate 
more than fifty years of service, culture, and 
kinship across Michigan’s 13th Congressional 
District.

Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and celebrate the bicentennial of Henry 
County, Indiana. Henry County is rich in his-
tory and overflowing with Hoosier hospitality. 
Henry County was officially founded on June 
1, 1822. Today it boasts museums to cele-
brate it’s past, parks and trails to discover it’s 
nature, and manufacturers, factories, and 
small businesses. 
Henry County is home to the Indiana Bas-
ketball Hall of Fame and served as the home 
court to the movie Hoosiers in Knightstown. A 
museum and birthplace of the inspirational 
Wilbur Wright also find it’s home here, in 
Henry County. It is also the birthplace of the 
famous LOVE artist, Robert Indiana. 
The rich history and beauty of Henry County 
stands proudly on 392 square miles and in-
cludes the Old National Road, the oldest of 
the great Crossroads of America. 
So be it then, Madam Speaker, that all Hoo-
siers join us in celebrating Henry County’s 
grand Bicentennial.

HONORING COMMANDER MATTHEW 
MALDONADO 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, July 21, 2022 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the retirement of Commander 
Matthew Maldonado from the Salinas Police 
Department after 29 years of service. The Sa-
linas Police Department is an integral part of 
our community, ensuring the safety and 
wellbeing of all Salinas residents for more 
than 145 years. 
Commander Maldonado demonstrated an 
early commitment to public safety and serving 
his community. Raised in the City of Salinas, 
he graduated from Salinas High School in 
1989 and attended classes at Monterey Penin-
sula College and Hartnell College, going on to 
graduate from Union Institute and University 
with a bachelor’s degree in Criminal Justice 
Management. Following in the footsteps of his 
father Richard Maldonado, who served with 
the Marina Department of Public Safety, he 
began his career with the Monterey County 
Sheriff’s Department in 1992. 
After graduating from the Gavilan Police 
Academy and a two-year assignment to the 
Correction Division, Commander Maldonado 
was hired by the Salinas Police Department 
and assigned to the Patrol unit working the 
midnight shift. While on the force, Commander 
Maldonado served in a variety of roles includ-
ing patrol officer, crime scene investigator, and 
as a member of the Violence Suppression 
Unit/SWAT. 
In 2004, he was promoted to Sergeant, 
where he supervised Patrol operations, the Vi-
olence Suppression Unit, the Narcotic Unit, 
and the Monterey County Joint Narcotics 
Team. Throughout his tenure, Commander 
Maldonado has been a strong leader with a 
commitment to public safety and education, 
having served as a firearms instructor for 17 
years and as SWAT team leader-turned-com-
mander for 18 years. He was also a founding 
sergeant of the California Department of Jus-
tice ‘‘STING’’ Task Force. Then-Sergeant 
Maldonado’s teams were responsible for Op-
eration Knock Out and Operation Snake Eyes, 
two successful wiretap cases into the Nuestra
