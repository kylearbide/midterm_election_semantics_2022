f 
PRAYER 
Reverend William Gurnee, St. Jo-
seph’s Catholic Church, Washington, 
D.C., offered the following prayer: 
Almighty God, because our human 
weakness leads us sometimes to glam-
orize our elected leaders as symbols of 
power or status or wealth, we must 
rely on You more fervently in this mo-
ment 
of 
crisis 
in 
our 
Nation’s 
healthcare, that we may all together 
arrive at the truth. 
The Members of this body know that 
they have been tasked with a tremen-
dous responsibility to care not for the 
trappings of this world, but for the real 
treasure of our Nation: her people. 
You have given each public official 
gifts for the building up of Your king-
dom. Guide them by Your holy spirit 
with wisdom and humility to make the 
compromises and choices that are nec-
essary for the good of all. 
Grant us this day Your blessings, and 
may we praise You always. We make 
this prayer in Your holy name. 
Amen.

sense of the House of Representatives that 
the Government of the People’s Republic of

the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which in-
clude the Chinese Government’s intentional

censorship of doctors and journalists, and 
malicious disregard for the health of ethnic

S1975 
Vol. 166 
WASHINGTON, TUESDAY, MARCH 24, 2020 
No. 58 
Senate 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. GRASSLEY). 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty and everlasting God, mer-
cifully look upon our infirmities and, 
in all our dangers, defend us. 
Lord, sometimes You seem so far 
away. We cry out to You and seem to 
only hear the echoes of our laments. As 
our lawmakers reach out to You night 
and day, enable them to connect to 
Your matchless power. May they find 
in You a sure refuge, a shelter from the 
storms. 
Lord, strengthen the weakness of our 
faith, and give us trust for our trem-
bling and hope for our fears. Give us 
patience, cheerful endurance, and se-
renity of mind. 
Lord, place your healing hands upon 
John Bessler, Senator RAND PAUL, and 
others who need to feel Your touch. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak in 
morning business for 1 minute. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
NATIONAL AG DAY 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
every American is facing a very uncer-
tain future that the new virus has 
brought to our country and to the 
world. Our daily lives have become 
transformed for right now and maybe, 
to some extent, for a longer period of 
time. 
Grocery stores have been open—in 
fact, one of the few businesses that 
need to stay open. While it may shock 
some living in large cities, food does 
not come from grocery stores; food 
comes from farms. 
Today, we celebrate National Ag 
Day. Let me assure you, American 
farmers and ranchers are up to the 
challenge of producing food to fill the 
shelves of every grocery store and the 
fridges and cupboards of our house-
holds. Farmers are only 2 percent of 
the population, but they will provide 
for the other 98 percent. When you eat 
today, thank a farmer, as I will thank 
the 88,000 family farmers in Iowa. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
for weeks now, the American people 
have 
been 
contending 
with 
the 
coronavirus pandemic that is spreading 
across our country and the massive, 
massive disruptions to daily life it is 
creating for all of us. They are grap-
pling with small business closures, 
mass layoffs, and uncertainty for their 
families. But that isn’t all. For the last 
several days now, in the midst of all 
that—in the midst of all that—they 
have also had to watch the Senate spin 
its wheels. 
As we convene this morning, roughly 
40 percent of our population is under 
stay-at-home orders from State lead-
ers. Employers across America are 
wondering how they will keep the 
lights 
on. 
Doctors, 
nurses, 
and 
healthcare professionals are literally 
crying out for support. We literally 
have Army field hospitals on the way 
to being set up in our major American 
cities. 
In the space of just a few weeks, this 
has become, unfortunately, our new 
normal. This is a national crisis. It is 
the most serious threat to Americans’ 
health in over a century and quite like-
ly the greatest risk to Americans’ jobs 
and prosperity that we have seen since 
the Great Depression. 
Hundreds of thousands of Americans 
have already lost their jobs because so 
much of our commerce has been put on 
pause. Families are wondering how 
they are going to pay their rent or 
mortgage in 8 days. Rent is due on 
April 1. People don’t know how they 
are going to pay bills or make their car 
payment. 
Many other hard-working Americans 
are still employed for now but fall 
asleep every night wondering if it will 
be there when they wake up to that 
email or phone call tomorrow. 
American seniors have seen decades 
of savings cut down in the space of 
days as the markets literally tumble. 
Our national life has literally been 
transformed in less than a month. The 
urgency and the gravity of this mo-
ment cannot be lost on anyone. Every 
day, every hour the Congress delays in 
passing a significant relief package, we 
risk more American livelihoods and 
the safety of more healthcare profes-
sionals. That is why, right after I fast- 
tracked the Democratic House relief 
bill through the Senate, I immediately 
turned the Senate toward developing 
an even bigger and bolder relief pack-
age for the American people. 
Nine days ago, I laid out the key ob-
jectives of our work. We had to send di-
rect financial assistance to Ameri-
cans—direct assistance to Americans. 
We had to help Main Street small busi-
nesses. We had to act to stabilize the 
foundations of our economy for work-
ers. And, of course, we had to send 
more resources to medical profes-
sionals and our healthcare system.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1976 
March 24, 2020 
Five days ago, Senate Republicans 
released our initial framework for the 
CARES Act. We put forward bold poli-
cies like sending cash directly to 
Americans, pouring money into small 
businesses, lending to national indus-
tries to prevent mass layoffs, and surge 
resources for doctors, nurses, and pa-
tients. We knew we needed a proposal 
to address our Nation’s pain at lit-
erally every level. 
Now, in the past few days, some 
voices have tried to pit some Ameri-
cans against other Americans and 
argue that directly helping workers 
and strengthening businesses are some-
how conflicting priorities. That is 
utter nonsense. American workers need 
paychecks. They need jobs. 
The working men and women of this 
country do need direct relief from gov-
ernment in this crisis, but for good-
ness’ sake, they also need their pay-
checks. They need to be able to resume 
their lives and their jobs once this is 
over. The two things can’t be sepa-
rated. There is a term for when you 
separate employees from employers. 
There is a term for that. It is called un-
employment. Let me say that again. 
There is a term for when you separate 
employees from employers. It is called 
unemployment. That is what we are 
trying to avoid. 
This is no time to point fingers or 
stoke these culture wars. This is the 
time to unify. Perhaps now more than 
at any moment in living memory, all of 
us Americans are in this together. This 
pandemic is not the fault of the Amer-
ican workers who make this country 
run. It is not the fault of small busi-
ness owners. It is not the fault of major 
national employers. Everyone needs 
help. We are all in this together. We 
need an ‘‘all of the above’’ approach, 
and that is what our framework put 
forward: help for workers and families 
and employers and healthcare pro-
viders. 
As soon as Republicans put out a 
draft proposal to treat every aspect of 
this crisis, I immediately called for bi-
partisan talks. That is not something 
you see often in Washington. As soon 
as I released our first draft, I imme-
diately invited the other side, these 
folks over here, to make their sugges-
tions. That is what you call urgency. 
We set up bipartisan working groups. 
I asked negotiators to work together to 
turn our rough draft into something 
that could pass the Senate with over-
whelming bipartisan support. Repub-
licans and Democrats traded ideas. 
Democrats asked for many changes to 
the initial draft and received many. 
The updated text, released a few days 
ago, included proposals from the other 
side. And, of course, as our colleagues 
have dragged out the last several days, 
even further changes have been made 
at their request. 
This majority has gone out of its way 
to make this process as bipartisan and 
as open as possible. The administration 
has bent over backward to work with 
Democrats and address their concerns. 
Now, at last, I believe we are on the 5- 
yard line. It has taken a lot of noise 
and a lot of rhetoric to get us here. 
That, of course, sometimes happens in 
this town. 
At 
different 
times, 
we 
received 
Democratic 
counteroffers 
that 
de-
manded 
things 
like 
new 
emission 
standards or tax credits for solar pan-
els. We saw the Speaker of the House 
release an encyclopedia of unrelated 
demands 
as 
though 
it 
were 
a 
coronavirus proposal somehow. In spite 
of all that, we are very close. We are 
close to a bill that takes our bold Re-
publican framework, integrates further 
ideas from both parties, and delivers 
huge progress on each of the four core 
priorities I laid out a week ago. 
Today the Senate has a chance to get 
back on track. Today we can make all 
of the Washington drama fade away. If 
we act today, what Americans will re-
member and what history will record is 
that the Senate did the right thing, 
that we came together, that we took a 
lesson from the way Americans are 
uniting all across the country and 
working together, that we combined 
ideas from both sides and took a bold 
step to protect Americans and help our 
Nation through this crisis. 
I am not sure how many ways to say 
it, but the clock has run out. The buzz-
er is sounding. The hour for bargaining 
as though this were business as usual 
has expired. 
The American people need our Demo-
cratic friends to take yes for an an-
swer. I hope that will happen today. 
Doctors and nurses need masks. Fami-
lies need help. Small businesses need 
cash. Hospitals need funding. Their 
Senate majority is ready to deliver 
those things. We have been ready to de-
liver those things for a while. I hope 
today is the day this body will get it 
done.

LEGISLATIVE SESSION 
MIDDLE CLASS HEALTH BENEFITS 
TAX REPEAL ACT OF 2019—MO-
TION TO PROCEED—Resumed 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will re-
sume consideration of the motion to 
proceed to H.R. 748, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Rev-
enue Code of 1986 to repeal the excise tax on 
high cost employer-sponsored health cov-
erage. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, at 
this very minute, across the country, 
families are wondering how they are 
going to survive financially now that 
mom or dad is out of a job. Hourly 
workers whose businesses have closed 
temporarily are praying that they will 
still have a job to go back to when this 
is all over. Small businesses are facing 
agonizing decisions about whether they 
will have to lay off employees or close 
their businesses altogether. 
And Democrats? Well, Democrats 
have been focused on fuel emissions 
standards and early voting. That is 
right. In the midst of an unprecedented 
health and financial crisis, Democrats 
have been delaying a major relief bill 
in hopes that they can include a laun-
dry list of their pet projects—projects 
that have absolutely nothing to do 
with 
providing 
financial 
relief 
to 
Americans or ensuring the medical pro-
fessionals have the resources they need 
to fight this virus. 
Republicans developed this legisla-
tion in conjunction with Democrats. It 
was teed up, being written up Satur-
day, Saturday evening, ready to vote 
Sunday 
morning, 
when 
Democrats 
voted to block even getting on the 
bill—even getting on the bill. They 
said: Well, we need to block it now be-
cause we may not be able to block it 
later—not, of course, acknowledging 
that there is yet another 60-vote hurdle 
that we would have to get over before 
we get to final consideration of the 
bill. But it has been teed up and ready 
to go now since Saturday night. We 
made a lot of changes since then to the 
legislation to address the Democrats’ 
priorities. 
I thought we were very close to 
agreement on a final bill. Of course, 
then the Democratic leadership of the 
House and Senate stepped in. They ap-
parently decided this was a perfect op-
portunity to implement a bunch of 
Democratic pet projects that have 
nothing to do—nothing to do with 
fighting the coronavirus or helping the 
American families who are suffering fi-
nancially at this very minute. 
I know my Democrat colleagues have 
come to regard ‘‘bipartisanship’’ as a 
bad word in the past 3 years, but I had 
hoped—I really, sincerely had hoped— 
that in this hour of serious need, the 
Democrats would be able to put aside 
their prejudices and work with Repub-
licans to pass this critical legislation. 
Apparently, that was too much to hope 
for from the Democrat leadership. 
Neither my colleagues nor I have 
given up on reaching an agreement. We 
are still working, and I am still hoping 
we will arrive at a final bill sometime 
later today. 
We should already have passed this 
legislation 3 days ago. The blame for 
not passing it lies squarely on the 
Democrats’ shoulders. I really hope

S1977 
March 24, 2020 
they will rethink their decision to hi-
jack this relief bill for their political 
purposes, because the American people 
deserve better. 
The bill before us is filled with re-
sources to help struggling families, 
provide relief to workers, and enable 
businesses to retain their employees 
during this crisis. Americans need this 
bill today, not tomorrow, not next 
week, not when Democrats are finally 
satisfied that they have scored enough 
political points—today. 
I hope my Democrat colleagues will 
urge their leadership to come to the 
table and pass this legislation. Amer-
ican workers and families need relief, 
and they need it now. We can’t afford 
to let them down. All we need is a few 
Democrat Members who are willing to 
go against their leadership and vote 
with us to pass legislation that ad-
dresses all the fundamental issues that 
I just mentioned: assistance to families 
displaced, people who need cash, people 
who need to pay bills; assistance to 
those who are unemployed in the form 
of unemployment insurance, increasing 
the States’ unemployment insurance 
that people already get by $600 per per-
son per week for 3 months; checks of 
$2,400 for married couples and $500 per 
child on top of that, to go out imme-
diately upon passage of this bill. For 
small businesses, there is $350 billion 
set aside to pay their payroll, to keep 
employees working, hopefully, to keep 
those jobs there so that they don’t go 
away, and, when this thing is over, to 
ensure that those jobs are still there 
for people. 
Those are all provisions in this bill 
that are designed to help working 
Americans, families, and employees to 
keep their jobs and keep their liveli-
hood until we get to a better place, 
which, hopefully, will be very soon. In 
the meantime, we need to deal with the 
healthcare crisis, which this also ad-
dresses. 
Look at this. There is over $240 bil-
lion in relief in this bill dealing prin-
cipally with the challenges that our 
healthcare community has: $75 billion 
directly for hospitals and another $25 
billion would come in reimbursements 
under Medicare to hospitals, so $100 bil-
lion for hospitals; $20 billion for vet-
erans healthcare; $11 billion for vac-
cines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and 
other preparedness needs; $4.5 billion 
for the Centers for Disease Control; $1.7 
billion 
for 
the 
Strategic 
National 
Stockpile; $12 billion for America’s 
military, also an important component 
in this fight; $10 billion for block 
grants to States; $12 billion for K–12 
education; $6 billion for higher edu-
cation; $5 billion for FEMA disaster re-
lief; $10 billion for airports; and $20 bil-
lion for public transportation emer-
gency relief. 
In all, just in this particular provi-
sion of the bill, there is $242 billion in 
assistance—$186 billion, I might add, 
which would run through and be ad-
ministered by the States. 
All told, between the amount that is 
going to families, workers, employees, 
and small businesses, there is about 
$1.1 to $1.2 trillion that could be on the 
street 
today 
helping 
address 
the 
healthcare and economic crisis that is 
being felt and experienced by the 
American people. But no, we are still 
here. We are still here waiting for the 
Democrats to conclude, at some point, 
we hope, all these political games that 
they are playing. 
It does seem like a big transaction 
for them—political winners and polit-
ical losers. The only loser we know is 
the American people in all of this be-
cause the longer this goes on, the hard-
er it becomes for them to get back to 
where they were, and the harder it be-
comes for that small business to stay 
open or keep those employees em-
ployed. Every single day is costing the 
American 
economy 
and 
American 
workers jobs, resources, and wages 
they could be putting forward to take 
care of them and their families. 
The Democrats have said they want 
more money for hospitals. That is ne-
gotiable. They want more conditions 
on the loan fund that larger businesses 
would be able to access in order to keep 
their businesses afloat. That is a nego-
tiable thing. There are many of our 
Members here who support those very 
things. They say they want more 
money for State and local govern-
ments, which is probably something 
that could be negotiated. 
I keep having rank-and-file Democrat 
Members come up to me and say: This 
is the list of things we want to nego-
tiate on and get in this bill. 
Those are all things we are willing to 
negotiate on and, frankly, many of our 
Members would support some of the 
things some Democrats want to do 
there, too. 
What is the holdup? I don’t think 
rank-and-file Democrats even realize 
what their leadership is demanding 
just past those doors and trying to get 
done in this bill: getting the Green New 
Deal into effect; requiring, basically, 
federalization, nationalization of our 
election system in this country; and all 
kinds of new requirements that benefit 
their special interest groups. That is 
what this is about. This is the hijack-
ing of a crisis to try and get permanent 
changes on a political agenda they 
haven’t been able to get and normally 
wouldn’t be able to get under those cir-
cumstances. 
We are happy to debate all of those 
issues. We are happy to have the debate 
about all those other things they want 
to talk about. That is what we do here. 
That is what we do in the Senate. If 
you have a good idea and you think 
something needs to be changed in this 
country, let’s come here and let’s de-
bate it. Let’s get a piece of legislation 
to talk about and see if we can come up 
with a solution. 
Right now is not the time to be de-
bating ancillary, unrelated issues. Now 
is the time to put out the fire, and 
there is a fire burning in this country 
right now. It is affecting every Amer-
ican. Every single American is being 
affected. 
Today is the day. I hope and pray 
that when the Democrat leadership 
comes out here on the floor, they will 
announce that today is the day they 
are going to work with us on a bill 
which they had input in. 
Two of the great fallacies about this 
legislation is, one, that this is a par-
tisan bill. They know that isn’t true. 
Their rank-and-file Members who have 
participated in the working groups all 
know that isn’t true. Yet their leader-
ship keeps coming out here announcing 
this is a partisan bill. 
This is not a partisan bill. This was 
constructed in a way that gave both 
sides input, which includes many of the 
priorities both sides brought to the 
table. That is what this bill represents. 
It represents the very things they said 
they want: an emphasis on workers, an 
emphasis on unemployed people, and 
an emphasis on businesses. 
And the other great fallacy that they 
raised is somehow that this is a bailout 
for big businesses—big businesses that 
have been forced to shut down. Look at 
the airlines. They have 10 percent to 20 
percent capacity. Why do you think 
that is? That is not their fault. That is 
not their choosing. They have been 
forced to shut down. 
There are industries in industry sec-
tors all across this country that are 
being affected in the same way. All this 
bill includes is a provision that allows 
them to access credit so that they can 
keep their operations going, so that 
they can continue to pay the millions 
of employees who are employed by big 
businesses across this country. The 
Democrats continually come to the 
floor and say: This is a bailout for big 
corporations; we need more emphasis 
on workers. 
Who do you think employs the work-
ers? 
As I mentioned, all the provisions in 
this bill—this is a pro-worker bill. This 
is about getting paychecks in the 
hands of American workers. That is 
what this bill does. That is what this 
bill is about. It is a sad and regrettable 
chapter in this time of enormous cri-
sis—something we haven’t seen, cer-
tainly, in my lifetime. You have to 
look back in the annals of history a 
really long time to find a time where 
we 
are 
facing 
the 
kind 
of 
cir-
cumstances, the kind of crises, and the 
kind of hardships we see, both in terms 
of people’s health and livelihood, as 
well as their economic livelihood in 
our history. 
Today is the day to get this done. We 
can’t wait any longer. The time for po-
litical games is over. It is time to act. 
I hope and pray that, by the end of the 
day, we will see the kind of coopera-
tion, the kind of bipartisanship that 
will let us address the needs of hard- 
working Americans who are fearful for 
themselves and their families. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Wyoming.

March 24, 2020 
remarks of the Republican whip. The 
time for political games is over. It is 
time to get this piece of legislation 
passed and signed into law. The Amer-
ican people need it. They want it, and 
they are watching. 
Yesterday, the U.S. Surgeon General 
warned us. He said: ‘‘This week, it’s 
going to get bad.’’ He was talking 
about the healthcare aspects of it. 
I was on the phone last night, along 
with my colleague, Senator ENZI, in a 
telephone townhall meeting, talking to 
people all around Wyoming. 
It is not just the healthcare side of it 
that is going to get bad. The economic 
side of it is going to get bad, as people 
who every day want to get up and go to 
work are now, for the first time in a 
long, long time, told they can’t do so, 
not by their employer but by the gov-
ernment. 
I have been visiting with doctors. Our 
healthcare 
providers 
are 
expecting 
more patients today and tomorrow and 
through the week. Some healthcare 
systems are being overrun. We need to 
get this done today. 
Americans are doing their part in 
preventing community spread of the 
virus, but the men and women on the 
frontline taking care of those patients 
need resources that would be included 
in this bill, and we need to get this 
passed today. 
The private sector mobilized to pro-
vide more tests, more masks, more res-
pirators, and more ventilators. They 
are doing their job. This Senate needs 
to do its job today. The administration 
has 
green-lighted 
scientific 
break-
throughs 
and 
flexibility 
for 
our 
healthcare system. 
The Senate has had a bipartisan 
process throughout this entire process, 
as the Senator from South Dakota has 
just outlined. Working groups have 
been coming up with bipartisan solu-
tions. Together we have put together 
the largest economic and healthcare 
rescue package in the history of this 
country. It is time to pass it today. 
Today—at least at the end of last 
night—we were still at a standstill, 
being blocked and delayed by, basi-
cally, the Speaker of the House. We are 
blocked from providing relief for the 
American people by the Speaker of the 
House and the Democrats who are 
doing her bidding. They continue to 
play politics with the lives and liveli-
hoods of the American people. 
It is distressing because, just within 
the last hour, the Speaker of the House 
was on national television. She is talk-
ing about what her options are—her po-
litical options—with no sense of ur-
gency at all. I did not hear a sense of 
urgency in her voice. I didn’t get the 
sense that she understood the gravity 
of the situation when I listened to her 
voice talking about this. She talked 
about a number of things on her wish 
list and talked about leveraging oppor-
tunities. This isn’t about political le-
verage. This is about the American 
people and the needs of our Nation at 
this time of healthcare crisis and eco-
nomic crisis. 
She talked about calling the House 
back in session as one of her options 
and then having a House-passed bill 
and then going to a conference. We 
need action in this body today, and we 
need this bill on the President’s desk 
tonight. 
Today, in this country, we have over 
46,000 people who have had the test for 
coronavirus and have tested positive. 
There is a lack of testing. So even 
though 46,000 people tested positive, 
the total numbers may be beyond that. 
We have nearly 600 deaths in the 
United States from this virus that is 
raging around the world. 
In New York, where the minority 
leader is from, they are turning the 
Javits Center into a field hospital. Men 
and women in the military know what 
a field hospital is all about. Physicians, 
who have gone through medical school, 
understand the history of field hos-
pitals. According to some estimates, 
the New York healthcare system could 
be overrun in a week. 
This bill needs to pass today. When 
you will look back on this in a day, in 
a week, in a month, you will just ask: 
How many deaths could have been pre-
vented if this bill had been passed yes-
terday instead of today? If one thinks 
that delaying this even beyond today is 
an option, it is not. The bipartisan bill 
that the Senators have worked on 
needs to pass today, be accepted, and 
moved from the House to the White 
House. 
It is hard to defend the indefensible, 
but that is where we find ourselves 
with so many Democrats coming to 
vote against even the motion to pro-
ceed to debate on the bill—an unneces-
sary delay that blocks the surge in sup-
plies that our hospitals need; that 
blocks the access to healthcare; that 
blocks the medical innovation; that 
blocks the support for our healthcare 
workers. Every one of those ‘‘no’’ votes 
was a block to assistance for commu-
nities all around the country. The 
votes to block the move to the motion 
to proceed delayed over $240 billion in 
emergency funding. That vote to block 
the motion to proceed blocked $100 bil-
lion for hospitals, $20 billion for vet-
erans’ healthcare, $11 billion for vac-
cines and therapeutics. The list goes on 
and on. 
Why? 
It seems to me the Speaker of the 
House has come back here with her 
own bill that we had on the floor yes-
terday, having just been made aware of 
what was in it. We looked at this wish 
list while the American people waited 
and watched and worried. It was a lib-
eral wish list of things that had noth-
ing to do with the disease or the treat-
ment or the recovery of the economy. 
In their liberal wish list, they block 
the list of things that would help to 
save people’s lives—resources that, as a 
doctor, 
I 
know 
are 
needed 
in 
a 
healthcare crisis. 
Why are they holding this up? 
We had a productive, bipartisan proc-
ess in putting a bill together that 
seemed, on Saturday night, to be right 
on its way to being a successful, bipar-
tisan effort. Yet, at the direction of the 
Speaker of the House, they all voted 
no. She said she wanted more in it and 
came out with her own bill. I will get 
to that wish list in a moment. 
We told the American public and 
Governors and mayors and hospitals 
that we were doing everything we 
could, and over the weekend, I believed 
that as this bipartisan group worked 
together. Yet to have seen all of the 
Democrats come to the floor and vote 
no has made me rethink that. We have 
an opportunity to do something the 
American public needs. We could have 
done it and should have done it yester-
day. 
The demands we are looking at really 
have nothing to do with saving lives 
and nothing to do with combating the 
coronavirus. The list that I have seen 
in the House bill has everything to do 
with capitulating to the extremes of 
NANCY PELOSI’s party—the far left of 
her party—and in making good on the 
deal that she cut so that she could re-
main as the Speaker of the House. 
Yesterday, she seemed to be more in-
terested—and was more interested in 
terms of the press reports—in reliving 
the passage of ObamaCare 10 years ago 
than in the crisis that we are facing 
today. She seemed to be more inter-
ested in reliving a law of 10 years ago 
instead of in what law needs to be 
passed today and should have been 
passed yesterday. 
It is ironic that one of the architects 
of ObamaCare, Ezekiel Emanuel—one 
who celebrated it—wrote a book when 
ObamaCare was passed. He wrote in the 
book that we have too many hospitals 
in the United States. He actually wrote 
that we have 1,000 too many hospitals 
in the United States. 
Since ObamaCare has passed, 120 hos-
pitals have closed, and many of those 
have been rural hospitals. ObamaCare 
has also blocked the expansion of phy-
sician-owned hospitals. Yet I hear from 
the same folks that, today, we need to 
expand our healthcare capacity—that 
we don’t have the hospital beds and the 
facilities to provide for the care that 
may be necessary in what the Surgeon 
General has said will be a week during 
which things are going to likely get 
much worse. 
I don’t understand why the Senate 
Democrats have chosen to align them-
selves with Speaker PELOSI
on this 
leftist list of all of their wants that 
override the needs of the American 
people. The House bill that NANCY 
PELOSI just put out—1,100 pages—is one 
special interest giveaway after an-
other. 
This came up last night during the 
telephone townhall meeting that Sen-
ator ENZI and I had with the folks in 
Wyoming. I said: Really? There are tax 
breaks for solar panels? for wind tur-
bines? They are holding up voting for 
this emergency bill that will help the 
American people in terms of the econ-
omy and in terms of our healthcare

March 24, 2020 
over solar panels, wind turbines, and a 
Green New Deal about airline emis-
sions? 
In this bill, this emergency rescue 
package for the American people, there 
is a student loan giveaway, a bailout 
for the U.S. Postal Service, new same- 
day voter registration, and early vot-
ing requirements. Those have no place 
in an emergency rescue package for the 
American people. That is why we were 
astonished on this side of the aisle 
when the Democrats—one after an-
other, after another—came to the floor 
and voted no for even a motion to pro-
ceed to this rescue legislation. 
The American public needs relief— 
healthcare relief. The American public 
needs to know that there is treatment 
on the way; that there is research 
being done for vaccines; and that the 
things they need for testing are on the 
way. That is what the American people 
need to know. If they can’t get pay-
checks at work because their work-
places have been shut down and they 
can’t go to their jobs—whether they 
are at restaurants or stores or what-
ever has been shut down—they need to 
know they can pay for food to put food 
on the tables for their families. 
Instead, what the Speaker is asking 
for in her bill is to increase collective 
bargaining for Big Labor; requirements 
for racial and gender diversity for cor-
porate boards; an automatic extension 
of nonimmigrant visas; money for 
Planned Parenthood; and money to 
maintain the John F. Kennedy Center 
for the Performing Arts—the Kennedy 
Center? These are all worthy topics for 
discussion but not on this bill, which is 
a rescue bill for the American public. 
Let me be clear. This list that came 
to us from the House is a special inter-
est wish list. It is not a list for people 
who are suffering from the coronavirus. 
This is why we have 150 million Amer-
ican workers who are watching and 
waiting and worrying. If those on the 
other side of the aisle thought they 
could just slip some of these items that 
the Speaker of the House wants into 
this Senate bill in an emergency, they 
are wrong. The President said last 
night that he will not approve such a 
list. So they are delaying, and they 
seem to be blocking the bill for some-
thing that will never become law. 
We know what is going on here. The 
media even understands well what is 
going on here because one major out-
let, CNN, said the Democrats are en-
gaging in political gamesmanship. This 
is about the future of our country, the 
future of the people of our country. Yet 
we are seeing political gamesmanship 
being played by the other side of the 
aisle. The American people get it as 
well. They see through it. They know 
that valuable days are being lost here. 
We need to pass this today with no 
more delays. The bill has been written 
in a bipartisan way in the Senate, and 
it should pass with overwhelming num-
bers. I see no reason we can’t vote 
today. I see no reason to delay. This is 
the time to get healthcare capacity on-
line to deal with this healthcare crisis 
during a week that, as the Surgeon 
General said, is going to get much 
worse. We need today to prepare our 
hospitals and our healthcare systems 
for the surge of patients that is com-
ing. They need to be ready. 
The men and women who are working 
in those hospitals are ready. They are 
in the fight of their lives. They are the 
heroes in hometowns all across Amer-
ica because the coronavirus is in every 
State and in many, many communities. 
So those men and women are there, 
and they need to hear that the Senate 
and the House and the President and 
this 
Nation—the 
government—are 
standing behind them and not standing 
at a distance. They need to know the 
government is right there in the fight 
with them by providing what they 
need—the testing, supplies, the equip-
ment—one thing after another—so they 
can do what they are trained to do, 
which is to save lives, to heal the sick, 
and to prevent disease. 
That is why people go into medicine. 
That is why they go into the profes-
sion. Doctors and nurses and therapists 
and all of those people who work there 
go to school to learn to save lives. 
They learn to treat disease, to heal the 
sick, and to prevent disease. That is 
what this coronavirus has put them all 
in a position to do—to do their best 
work. We have to make sure they have 
everything they need. 
For that reason, we need to pass this 
bill today. There is no reason to delay, 
no reason to wait another day. The bill 
provides them with what they need, 
and it provides the economy the sort of 
certainty and security that the entire 
country needs. 
I appreciate the opportunity to share 
these thoughts. My final message is, 
this bill needs to be passed today. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, as we are all facing this, we are 
hearing from our Tennesseans; we are 
hearing from small businesses; and peo-
ple are trying to hang on to every piece 
of information they can get. 
It helps them to stay informed, and 
we encourage everyone: Stay informed. 
Stay up to the minute. Talk to us. Be 
on our websites and social media. 
We all want to get to you the infor-
mation you need as quickly as we get 
it because that is how we are going to 
defeat this—by realizing that we are all 
in this together, and it is going to take 
every single one of us doing our part to 
get past it. 
In my family, we had this mantra 
that we grew up with, and it was kind 
of my mother’s way of saying: Don’t sit 
around and wait. Do things. And it 
was—there were two things she would 
always say: Leave things in better 
shape than you found them. In other 
words, always be helping to improve a 
situation. Leave things in better shape 
than you found them. 
She would always say ‘‘Give back 
more than you take,’’ stressing to us 
the importance of being a giver to our 
community, to our family, to our soci-
ety, and not being a taker, sitting 
around feeling like you are entitled 
and you want people to bring things to 
you. 
So in our family, as we approached 
situations that may have been less 
than wonderful or if there had been a 
hurricane—I grew up in South Mis-
sissippi—or a terrible storm or some 
other event, we would always look at it 
and say ‘‘Leave things in better shape 
than you found them’’ and ‘‘Give back 
more than you take.’’ 
It was important that action be a 
part of the solution, not only for our 
family and our community but right 
now. Taking the right actions, exer-
cising good judgment, is something 
that is important for our entire Na-
tion, and Tennesseans are hard at work 
helping to address this coronavirus— 
COVID–19—crisis that we are under. 
Right now, there are 166 members of 
the Tennessee National Guard who are 
training to provide support to the Ten-
nessee Department of Health. All to-
gether, the State currently plans to ac-
tivate 250 guardsmen to help out at 
clinics across the State. They will be 
helping with assessments and screen-
ing. 
To 
these 
National 
Guardsmen, 
Guardswomen, to these members and 
their families who are going to acti-
vate in this crisis, bless you—God bless 
you—and thank you for once again 
stepping up to help defend our Nation 
and to meet our Nation’s needs. 
The Tennessee Air National Guard 
assisted in transporting 1 million test-
ing kits. They put these on the C–17s 
that are housed there in Memphis and 
flew them from Aviano Air Base in 
Italy to Memphis, and then those kits 
were divided out and sent to healthcare 
providers all across the Nation to get 
testing into communities where our 
citizens are fearing they may have con-
tracted COVID–19. 
In finding solutions, our scientists at 
Vanderbilt University Medical Center 
are working hard in participation with 
other labs to find a vaccine for this, 
the Denison Lab—and I had the oppor-
tunity to talk to Dr. Denison last 
week. We know that, in conjunction 
with other labs, they are expediting 
the testing that is necessary and find-
ing therapies, anti-virals, vaccines. 
This is something they are focusing on, 
and they are working as hard as they 
possibly can, around the clock, to find 
these solutions. 
Of course, we do know if China had 
been more forthcoming, if they had not 
tried to keep this a secret—imagine

trying to keep this a secret, which is 
exactly what they tried to do—we 
would be further along in this process, 
but we are so grateful—so, so grate-
ful—for these brilliant minds that are 
researching this and are building off 
past research from coronaviruses and 
from SARS, and they are whittling 
down what can be used to fight this. 
Indeed, the supercomputer at Oak 
Ridge and the team of scientists there, 
working with the supercomputer, the 
Summit, were able to put in a lot of in-
formation and distill down to 77 drugs 
that could be effective in this fight 
against COVID–19. 
You may remember that just as we 
identified our first case of COVID–19 in 
Tennessee, that was the week that 
West and Middle Tennessee were struck 
by a devastating series of tornadoes. 
TEMA, our emergency management 
agency, and all of the volunteers who 
have worked on this have done an un-
believable job in the midst of dealing 
with unprecedented devastation. 
Again, we thank President Trump for 
his attention to this, and the people of 
Tennessee are so grateful for his atten-
tion to the concerns of those hit with 
the tornado and his visit to the State 
and FEMA and TEMA working to-
gether to address that. 
So our State has had a full plate, and 
I say thank you to every Tennessean 
who has looked at the situation that 
we are in and decided that they are 
going to do whatever they can to help. 
We have a lot of distillers in our 
State, and, God bless them, they are 
stepping up and instead of distilling 
whiskey, they are moving to sanitizers. 
And, yes, to those distillers, we know 
there is an excise tax problem, and we 
are on it, trying to resolve that for 
you. 
I have to give a shout-out to our 
singers and our songwriters, our musi-
cians. While they cannot go fill the au-
dience at one of the clubs on Lower 
Broad or one of the concert venues in 
so many places around our State and 
up in Pigeon Forge and Gatlinburg, 
what they are doing is hosting virtual 
concerts on their own Instagram and 
Facebook, and they are doing this 
every single day, trying to bring a bit 
of joy to lift our hearts during a time 
when we are quarantining and staying 
separate and apart. How wonderful 
that we have this technology that will 
allow us to walk through this entire 
process of this pandemic together. 
Here in DC, we are doing our best to 
be as positive as we possibly can and to 
be productive because we know, as I 
said on this floor yesterday, that this 
is a very difficult time for small busi-
nesses, and it is why I have worked so 
very 
consistently 
and 
diligently 
through this process of negotiating our 
legislative solution to be sure that it 
includes a small business definition 
that is going to include the self-em-
ployed and the sole proprietors and the 
independent contractors so that they 
are not left in the lurch. We are con-
tinuing to do that. We are hearing from 
people every day. 
I heard from the manager of a YMCA 
that is outside of Nashville, and they 
have 65 part-time employees who work 
in that facility. This manager is con-
cerned about how nonprofits and small 
businesses are going to end up being 
treated in this legislation. He is cer-
tainly wanting to keep those people on 
the payroll. And do you know what? I 
agree with him. We want people to stay 
on the payroll. When we get past this 
15-day period—we are about halfway 
through it right now, 15 days to slow 
the spread that the President and Vice 
President have put in place—we want 
people to be going back to work. 
I heard from another business owner. 
It is a family-owned business, and they 
do maintenance services like plumbing 
and electrical work, and they have em-
ployees who have been with them since 
1993. They have never had to lay off one 
single employee, and they are con-
cerned about where uncertainty is. 
We have retail—fabulous, homegrown 
retail—entities in Middle Tennessee, 
around Nashville. One of those employ-
ers 
has 
five 
stores. 
They 
are 
headquartered in Franklin, TN, right 
outside of Nashville. He is keeping peo-
ple working even though they are bare-
ly bringing in revenue, and he needs us 
to pass this bill, this rescue bill, so he 
can keep those employees on the pay-
roll. Then a company that has stood 
itself up in the last several years—and 
they are a valuable asset in working 
with the vulnerable population, moving 
people from poverty to work—is want-
ing to keep people working. 
We are hearing from all of these 
about the importance of having this 
bill that will be a bipartisan bill to ad-
dress the concerns of businesses, large 
and small, and to address the concerns 
of workers who are working for those 
businesses, large and small. 
What we have had in the bipartisan 
bill—and hopefully this will move for-
ward—is $350 billion in loans for small 
businesses, and if people stay working, 
those become grants; $500 billion in 
emergency relief through low-interest 
loans that could go to businesses and 
hospitals; $242 billion in emergency ap-
propriations across Federal agencies. 
Seventy-five percent of that money 
would go to State, local, and Tribal 
governments, which are much better at 
managing their affairs than the Fed-
eral Government. There is $250 billion 
in increased and expanded unemploy-
ment benefits. I talked about this yes-
terday. If you normally are going to 
get $300 in unemployment, with the 
$600 plus-up, you are at $900 a week. 
These are all things to keep the econ-
omy going. There is an additional $75 
billion for hospitals and our healthcare 
workers. 
So there is much that is in there. 
Imagine a bipartisan bill including 
this—including tax rebates for Ameri-
cans, $1,200 for individuals, $2,400 for 
joint filers, $500 per dependent child. 
There are student loan deferments for 
those who are affected by COVID–19. 
All of that—all of that is in a bill. It is 
so incredibly disappointing to know 
that we had a failed vote—not once but 
twice—to get cloture to move forward 
to get on this bill. 
With all of these good-faith negotia-
tions, I have just been appalled, as I 
said yesterday, with the comments to 
restructure this bill to meet the pro-
gressive vision. You know, there is a 
season for everything. There is a time 
and place for everything, and this is 
neither the time nor the place to have 
a debate about things like collective 
bargaining powers for unions and mak-
ing our airlines meet emissions stand-
ards—the Green New Deal emissions 
standards by 2025. For goodness’ sake, 
let’s keep the airlines flying right now. 
Wind and solar tax credits have noth-
ing—nothing—to do with COVID–19. 
Come on, I say to my friends across the 
aisle, let’s set these aside for the ap-
propriate season to discuss this, but it 
is not now. Election assistance fund-
ing? That has nothing to do with 
COVID–19. Corporate board diversity? 
It has nothing to do with COVID–19. 
Same-day voter registration? The list 
goes on and on. There is a time and a 
place, there is a season, and right now, 
dealing with the crisis in front of us is 
what should be the center of our atten-
tion. 
I think that yesterday my fellow Re-
publicans and I made it abundantly 
clear. We do not have time. At this 
point in time, we do not have time for 
political 
games 
and 
antics 
based 
around a progressive policy wish list. It 
is disrespectful of the American people. 
It is hurtful to those who are directly 
affected by COVID–19, which, indeed, is 
everybody. It is important for us to 
move forward. 
I didn’t get everything I wanted. I 
would have preferred a payroll tax holi-
day. I would have preferred rebating in-
come taxes that have been paid for 
businesses and for individuals. I would 
have even liked to have seen more of 
my bipartisan SAM–C Act, Securing 
America’s 
Medicine 
Cabinet. 
But 
adults realize you are not going to get 
everything you want, and reasonable 
people realize you are not going to get 
everything you want. 
This is a time where we should be re-
spectful and we should be reasonable 
and we should apply common sense. We 
know the American people are expect-
ing our best efforts, and they are look-
ing forward to a solution. 
As I said yesterday, I had talked to 
someone who said: You know, I am 
scared to death. 
This is a small business owner who 
struggled. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
allowed them to move forward with 
growth. There are teenagers in the 
house, and homeschool is starting 
today. 
She said: I am screaming inside si-
lently. I do not want the kids to know 
that I am afraid. 
So I encourage my colleagues to lay 
down your progressive policy wish list. 
Lay it down. Set it aside. There is a 
season to everything. There is a time,

S1981 
March 24, 2020 
there is a season, and I encourage you 
to realize that this is neither the time 
nor the season. Let’s address the crit-
ical issues in front of us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The as-
sistant Democratic leader. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, first 
let me say a word to my colleague from 
Tennessee. 
It is good to see you, and it is a good 
social distance. I thank you for your 
presentation. We may not agree on ev-
erything, but we do agree on some 
things, and we are working together on 
the issues that affect Tennessee, Illi-
nois, and many other places, to in-
crease the number of medical profes-
sionals available in small towns and 
rural America. 
As we go through this public health 
crisis, it reminds us that we need to 
keep focused on that, and she and I will 
continue to work on that. I thank her 
for her bipartisan cooperation. That is 
a timely issue with or without the cur-
rent crisis we face, and I look forward 
to her successful completion on that 
bipartisan issue. 
Madam 
President, 
my 
daughter 
called me yesterday from New York 
and talked about her first day in the 
classroom. You see, our grandkids go 
to public schools in Brooklyn, and they 
are, of course, closed, and the kids are 
back home. Well, yesterday was the 
first day there was to be remote learn-
ing using laptop computers. So my son- 
in-law took my grandson and my 
daughter took my granddaughter into 
separate rooms and spent 3 or 4 hours 
in that made-up classroom. My daugh-
ter said: This is harder than I ever 
imagined. 
So it is a reminder, No. 1, of how 
much we owe it to teachers every sin-
gle day, and not with 1 child, usually 
with more than 1–15 to 30 in a class-
room. Let us also remember that the 
learning process is critically important 
as we go through this health crisis. I 
hope all parents will try—I know my 
daughter and her husband are trying— 
to help the kids keep up with their 
learning process. In some places, it is 
hard. Kids don’t have access to com-
puters or may not have remote-learn-
ing possibilities. But it is something 
that is essential, and I thank the 
teachers and school districts that are 
trying to put it together. 
Janice Jackson, who is the head of 
the Chicago Public Schools, called me 
just a few days ago, and we talked 
about how they were implementing 
this in the city of Chicago and how 
they are trying to distribute school 
lunches. It is an awesome responsi-
bility. 
Let’s give special thanks to those 
who are working overtime to try to 
make sure our kids can keep up with 
the learning process and some of the 
basics in life, like feeding them to 
make sure they have something for 
lunch and breakfast, if not more. 
I can go through the long list of peo-
ple to thank, which I have done before, 
starting with those in healthcare— 
nurses, doctors, lab technicians, and 
others working in senior citizen facili-
ties, our first responders, and many 
like them. Let us not forget that every 
single day while we isolate, they are 
forced to break isolation and to come 
to help those in need, and we can never 
thank them enough. 
So what is going on in the U.S. Sen-
ate? If you hear the other side of the 
aisle, there is a suggestion that we lost 
our opportunity, that we are wasting 
time and nothing is happening. They 
argue that we have had two votes in a 
row—Sunday afternoon and then yes-
terday—to decide not to debate on the 
floor the MCCONNELL bill which was 
produced. The argument is that we 
can’t waste a second, that we need to 
get to the serious business of helping 
people across America and turning our 
economy around. 
I just want to say for the record that 
I left the office not 30 or 40 feet away 
of the Democratic leader, Senator 
SCHUMER. I didn’t go and see him be-
cause he is in active negotiations at 
this minute with Treasury Secretary 
Mnuchin, 
representing 
the 
White 
House. He is in communication with 
the Speaker of the House, NANCY 
PELOSI, about the progress being made, 
and, as he said on the floor yesterday, 
he feels positive and optimistic about 
the outcome. I do too. 
This is an awesome undertaking. 
Consider for a minute that the bill we 
are trying to style and craft literally is 
larger than 1 year’s Federal budget for 
domestic discretionary spending, and 
we are doing it in a matter of days. 
When it comes to the Federal budget, 
we spend a year—sometimes longer— 
putting it together. In this case, we are 
writing a bill of that magnitude in a 
matter of days because it is a compel-
ling challenge and should happen. 
The argument on the other side of 
the aisle is that we wasted our oppor-
tunity here, that we should have 
agreed to the MCCONNELL bill that was 
brought forward for a vote on Sunday 
and got on with it. But many under-
stood that there was a fundamental 
flaw in the process Senator MCCONNELL 
started. 
When he suggested that we needed 
this third bill, it was after we had 
passed two previous bills. 
The first one, the President asked, if 
you will remember—it seems like an-
cient history—about 3 weeks ago, the 
President asked for $2 billion to deal 
with coronavirus. Many of us thought 
that was totally inadequate, and we 
put our heads together on a bipartisan 
basis with the President and raised it 
to $8 billion. We did it in a timely way, 
and we did it in a bipartisan fashion. It 
probably shocked people across Amer-
ica who have limited high regard for 
Congress to start with. 
Quickly thereafter came a need for 
another bill. We upped the amount 
from $8 billion to $100 billion in that 
second bill. It passed in the early 
morning hours of last Saturday—just 
last Saturday. What happened in the 
Senate? Well, the Senate didn’t move 
on the bill until Wednesday of last 
week. So we are talking about waiting 
4 days when we could have considered 
the bill in the Senate and didn’t move 
forward with it because we didn’t have 
consent requested or given. But it has 
been done that way before. It doesn’t 
have to physically make it across the 
rotunda. So 4 days passed, and last 
Wednesday, Senator MCCONNELL called 
for this vote, and it passed—$100 bil-
lion. 
Then he announced we would start 
crafting this third bill. If you notice 
the calendar days we are facing here, it 
hasn’t been a week since that an-
nouncement, and we are considering a 
bill of the size and magnitude the likes 
of which we have never seen in a single 
undertaking. It is a bill for authoriza-
tion and appropriation that may range 
somewhere north of $1.5 trillion. Why 
is it that big? Because the problem is 
that big, if not larger. That is why we 
are trying to do this the right way. 
When Senator SCHUMER was told by 
Senator MCCONNELL we were moving 
toward this third bill, his first response 
was the right one: Let’s do it as we did 
with the first two. Let’s have a bipar-
tisan, bicameral approach. He sug-
gested bringing together the four cor-
ners, as we call them here—the Demo-
cratic and Republican leaders of the 
House and Senate, together with the 
White House, sitting down at the table 
to craft this bill. 
Senator MCCONNELL refused. He said: 
We will start this as an exclusively Re-
publican Senate bill. We will ask our 
task forces to write something. We will 
get back to the Democrats in the Sen-
ate later. 
No mention was made of the involve-
ment of the House. 
Well, after some 48 hours, we were 
presented with the proposal from the 
Republican side. In fairness, there were 
parts of it that were bipartisan in the 
MCCONNELL bill. I think of the effort 
that Senator CARDIN of Maryland and 
Senator RUBIO of Florida put into the 
whole question of dealing with small 
business and the problems that they 
are facing with this massive public 
health crisis. They have come up with 
what I consider a good approach—a 
good approach that literally could help 
50 to 60 million small businesses across 
America. There were others involved in 
the 
conversation—Senator 
WYDEN, 
Senator GRAHAM, and others. It was bi-
partisan—start to finish—and I believe 
we are this close to coming up with 
this bipartisan proposal. 
However, the other provisions in the 
MCCONNELL bill were not as bipartisan, 
and there reached a point where Sen-
ator MCCONNELL announced that that 
was the end of the story. He was bring-
ing the MCCONNELL bill to the floor 
without 
further 
negotiation. 
That 
came as a surprise because there were 
elements that the Democrats were ask-
ing for and insisting on that really 
were fundamental.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1982 
March 24, 2020 
So a vote was taken this last Sunday 
afternoon, and we decided, as a caucus, 
to argue on the Democratic side that 
there were fundamental elements miss-
ing in the MCCONNELL proposal and we 
wanted to include them. So we voted 
no in going forward on the MCCONNELL 
proposal. 
At that point, we didn’t stalk off and 
fold our arms and say: That is it; we 
are not part of the process. Senator 
SCHUMER and the leaders in our caucus 
did exactly the opposite. We sat down 
with the White House, with the Treas-
ury Secretary, and started engaging on 
those issues of importance, and, within 
a few hours, we involved the Speaker of 
the House of Representatives, NANCY 
PELOSI. 
Time and again, I have noticed over 
the last several days that Senator 
MCCONNELL and others have come to 
the floor and complained that Speaker 
PELOSI was part of this negotiation 
process. If you go back to that pam-
phlet of how laws are made, you under-
stand that this is not a unicameral leg-
islature. Both the House and the Sen-
ate need to pass a measure for it to be 
sent to the President. So the involve-
ment of the House leaders—starting, of 
course, with the majority, Speaker 
PELOSI, and including Mr. MCCARTHY of 
California, representing the minority— 
is an integral part of this process, and 
it should be. I don’t understand why it 
is so unnerving for so many Republican 
leaders to consider sitting down at a 
table with this woman from California 
who happens to be the Speaker of the 
House and the leader of the majority, 
who is essential if we are going to get 
this done in a timely way. I think she 
should be part of it. 
She has been following the progress 
that is being made with Senator SCHU-
MER, Mr. Mnuchin, and Senator MCCON-
NELL. She has made positive state-
ments in the hopes that we can reach a 
point where we have a bipartisan 
agreement, and that would speed this 
up, as it should be. So we involved the 
House of Representatives in this con-
versation at the earliest stage, not 
after we have finished the Republican 
measure 
that 
Senator 
MCCONNELL 
wanted to bring to the floor, but after 
we have completed a bipartisan meas-
ure that is one that she may be able to 
take to the House of Representatives 
for consideration and maybe even a 
unanimous consent on the floor. 
So what are the items that we are 
now negotiating, and where do they 
stand? The first item—and we made it 
clear on the Democratic side—that is 
essential is that we deal with the 
healthcare system across America. The 
Governor 
of 
New 
York, 
Governor 
Cuomo, announced yesterday that he 
wishes that every hospital in New York 
would increase its capacity by 50 per-
cent. Then, he went on to say: I really 
mean 100 percent. But 50 percent is so 
that they have enough bed space for 
those who are likely to come in seek-
ing help facing this COVID–19 virus. We 
can understand that if a great State 
like New York—and even Illinois, for 
that matter—has to anticipate this 
dramatic increase in patients, our sys-
tem could be easily overwhelmed. 
So the Democrats have said from day 
one that we want to make that the 
highest priority in this third bill. We 
want to make sure we put money in 
there for hospitals and for healthcare 
to respond to this crisis, and I will tell 
you that progress has been made. Since 
the negotiation between Senator SCHU-
MER and Treasury Secretary Mnuchin 
has been under way, we have made 
progress, and I hope that if we can hold 
it, we will have a dramatic increase in 
the amount of money that was origi-
nally in the MCCONNELL bill for this 
purpose when it comes to hospitals. 
I also want to say a word about the 
unemployment insurance. This is a 
proposal that comes from the Demo-
cratic side but has been embraced by 
many Republicans as well, and the no-
tion behind it is that those workers 
who cannot go to work, because there 
is no work to be done or they have been 
furloughed or lost their jobs, would 
have access to the highest levels of un-
employment compensation in our Na-
tion’s history. Now, we think that this 
is a significant change and even a sig-
nificant restructuring of unemploy-
ment insurance to reflect the current 
crisis we face. 
I don’t run away from this issue of 
restructuring. I have heard many Re-
publican critics, but when it comes to 
unemployment insurance, we are, in 
fact, restructuring it. The payments 
that were generally made in my State 
of Illinois and in other States were just 
not sufficient for those to maintain a 
family and pay their bills during times 
of economic crisis. So we have started 
moving toward an amount for indi-
vidual workers closer to what they 
were paid at work, and we believe that 
this should be done over a long period 
of time. To say 3 months is enough 
may be a rosy scenario, which we hope 
will occur, but it may not. We want to 
give these workers the assurance that 
they can keep their families together 
and pay their basic bills, even if they 
are not going to work because of this 
public health crisis, which we are fac-
ing. 
Is that restructuring? I think it is. Is 
it necessary? Certainly, it is, and it has 
been agreed to on a bipartisan basis. 
That is one of the things that we don’t 
believe the MCCONNELL bill, originally 
proposed to us on Sunday, really ad-
dressed in a fulsome and complete way. 
We have made it our kind of standard 
on the Democratic side to make cer-
tain that we measure every proposal 
for economic recovery against the 
workers and working families of Amer-
ica—not what it does in the boardroom 
but what it does in the family room of 
individual families who still get those 
bills in the mail and still face the pres-
sures of being out of work and won-
dering if there is enough money to get 
by. 
We know that a majority of Ameri-
cans do not have savings of $400 or 
more. Many of them live week to week, 
not paycheck to paycheck, and we 
want to make certain that they have 
that peace of mind. We have measured 
every proposal for economic recovery 
against working families in America 
and against the individual workers and 
the challenges they face. 
There has been a complaint that we 
raised the issue of collective bar-
gaining. We want to make certain that 
when we give money to corporations, it 
does not change the status of the work-
ers whom they have bargained with 
over the years. We are going to wait, of 
course, for another day to consider fu-
ture contracts and work contracts, but 
for the time being, we want to make 
certain that whatever money is going 
into the corporation respects the exist-
ing rights of workers under their col-
lective bargaining agreements. I don’t 
think that is a radical notion. Corpora-
tions are going to continue to operate 
under the laws of America. I think that 
the workers should be entitled to the 
rights that have been granted to them 
under 
their 
collective 
bargaining 
agreements, and that is basically the 
bottom line for us when it comes to 
collective bargaining. 
When it comes to loans to corpora-
tions, that is where we have a serious 
problem with the MCCONNELL
bill. 
There was a provision in Senator 
MCCONNELL’s bill, which he calls a bi-
partisan bill—and I acknowledge that, 
in part, it was—but there was a provi-
sion that was far from bipartisan. It 
was a provision which said when it 
came to loaning money to corpora-
tions, the Treasury Secretary could 
waive the disclosure of that loan for up 
to 6 months. That is unacceptable to 
me, and it was to most of us on the 
Democratic side. 
We believe that if billions of dollars 
are flowing through the decision of the 
Treasury Secretary to individual cor-
porations, 
there 
should 
be 
trans-
parency and accountability: Who is re-
ceiving the money, under what condi-
tions, and what is going to happen with 
the money that is being sent—taxpayer 
money that is being sent—for this pur-
pose? 
So we have insisted, as we sit down 
in negotiation here, for this account-
ability and transparency when it comes 
to these massive amounts—billions of 
dollars—that could be transferred by 
the decision of one person in the ad-
ministration. I don’t think that is too 
much to ask. We should be held ac-
countable as Members of the Senate 
and the House of Representatives for 
the money that is appropriated when 
we allocate it, and the administration 
should be held to the same basic stand-
ard. 
We also believe that when it comes to 
the basic standards, we have been 
burned once and don’t want to be 
burned a second time. For those of us 
who voted for past legislation to give 
money to corporations, we want to 
make certain that that is for the good 
of the economy and the good of the

S1983 
March 24, 2020 
workers. Sadly, in the past, we have 
seen, under tax bills and other provi-
sions that were supposed to benefit the 
economy, that they ended up being a 
windfall for executives and corpora-
tions in terms of stock buybacks and 
dividends. Yes, we are holding a stand-
ard that buybacks should not be part of 
the future of any corporate assistance. 
We should be dealing with this to help 
the workers and help the economy but 
not to line the pockets of those who 
are at the highest levels of corporate 
governance. I don’t think that is a rad-
ical idea. I think most Americans agree 
with it, and it is one of the things that 
we continue to argue for. 
I see my friend Senator CARPER has 
come to the floor. We served in the 
House of Representatives together, and 
then he took a little vacation and be-
came Governor of the State of Dela-
ware and then returned to service at 
the Federal level in the Senate. He 
knows, as all of us do, that Governors 
across the United States and mayors 
and presidents of county boards, for ex-
ample, are making exceptional sac-
rifices to fight this battle against this 
coronavirus. They are spending a lot 
more money on public health matters 
than they ever anticipated. They are 
seeing more claims at our State level 
for unemployment insurance than they 
have seen in history, and many of them 
are facing fiscal budgetary problems 
because of it. It is so obvious. We have 
seen 
dramatic 
leadership 
when 
it 
comes to the Governors. 
One of our colleagues of the House, 
Mike DeWine, now the Republican Gov-
ernor of Ohio, has made some, I think, 
significant, important, and good deci-
sions for his State. Some of those have 
involved more spending by the State of 
Ohio than he ever could have antici-
pated. The same thing is true for J.B. 
Pritzker in the State of Illinois. I talk 
to him virtually every single day. We 
text many times during the day, and I 
know that he is spending money that 
he thinks is necessary to save lives in 
Illinois. 
So the point I am making is that we 
want to make sure that the bill that 
emerges helps State and local govern-
ments with the fiscal problems they 
face because of this economic and 
healthcare crisis. I don’t think that is 
unreasonable. I think it is the right 
thing to do, and I hope that we can in-
clude it. That is why the original pro-
posal in the MCCONNELL bill did not go 
far enough and why we have continued 
to negotiate up to this minute. 
I might raise an issue of difference 
between myself and the Senator from 
Tennessee, who was on the floor just a 
few moments ago. She had suggested 
that we shouldn’t involve ourselves in 
issues that really have nothing to do 
with COVID–19, and she used as an ex-
ample the administration and execu-
tion of elections. 
Well, I will tell you, we went into a 
debate just a week or so ago in Illinois 
as to whether to go forward with the 
primary election. We decided in Illinois 
to do it, and it wasn’t easy at all. They 
decided in Ohio to postpone the pri-
mary election. The point I am getting 
to is that the conduct and timing of 
elections relates directly to COVID–19, 
whether there are enough people who 
will be able to vote and enough people 
to serve as judges in polling places. 
So I don’t know if that is being de-
bated in the other room, but we should 
bring that issue up, because we want to 
make sure that, in this democracy, the 
most fundamental element of a free 
and democratic election is going to 
occur. I encourage all of my friends and 
family to vote by mail and vote early. 
We can do it in our State. In some 
States you can’t. I hope we can find a 
mechanism to guarantee that elections 
really do reflect the sentiment of the 
American populace. 
Is that related to COVID–19? You bet 
it is. It is basic. And whether it is in-
cluded in this bill or in a later bill, I 
don’t think we should ignore it. 
Finally, let me say a word about the 
President’s 
press 
conference 
last 
evening. I watched it, and I watched it 
because the news reports leading up to 
it raised a question as to whether the 
President was going to change Amer-
ica’s strategy when it comes to dealing 
with this coronavirus. The current 
strategy, of course, is social distance, 
to make sure that you are isolating 
yourself as much as possible, and when 
in the presence of others, you don’t 
stand too close, and wash your hands 
over and over. Those are the fundamen-
tals. I mean, we hear those rec-
ommendations, and I think they are 
sound. 
But now there is a suggestion from 
the President that we may take a dif-
ferent course. I don’t know what he 
will finally decide, but I will stand 
with the public health experts—Dr. 
Fauci and others—who believe that the 
best way to slow the growth of this in-
fection rate in our country is by using 
some form of social distance and isola-
tion of individuals and families. It is a 
great personal sacrifice and burden for 
many families to go through this, I 
know, but if, at the end of the day, we 
can reduce the number of people who 
suffer or die from this virus, it is worth 
the sacrifice, as far as I am concerned. 
Presidents, in times of national cri-
sis, are expected to be credible, with 
clarity and consistency. I hope the 
President will remember that as he 
makes his decision on policy. 
Don’t follow somebody talking on 
cable TV and their recommendations. 
Follow the experts in public health 
who have dedicated their lives to sav-
ing the lives of others. Even though it 
may not be politically popular to con-
tinue 
with 
this 
current 
social 
distancing, it is an approach which I 
believe has been proven in many other 
countries around the world to work 
successfully. 
The notion that we are doing damage 
to our economy, of course, is being 
heard. The number of unemployment 
claims may reach historic and record- 
breaking highs, but the fact is, if we 
don’t deal with the underlying cause of 
our economic chaos, and that is this 
virus, and deal with it effectively, 
sadly, we are going to see the economic 
situation in this country deteriorate 
even more in the future. 
I am going to close my bottom line 
with this: We believe that the first two 
measures passed related to COVID–19 
were done in a timely and bipartisan 
manner. They have been done in an ef-
fort to make sure the American people 
know that we can overcome our polit-
ical differences and actually come to-
gether in a bipartisan way to serve this 
Nation, as we were sworn to do. 
There have been differences along the 
way. This bill that we are currently 
considering is one of such magnitude 
that we have never seen anything like 
it in the history of Congress in terms 
of the dollar amounts that are being 
debated now. We want to make certain 
that we do everything in good faith 
that we can to have a good negotiation 
and a bipartisan negotiation involving 
the House, the Senate, and the White 
House in the hopes that we can get this 
done and come up with a truly bipar-
tisan package. 
The original bill—I mentioned four or 
five particulars—was lacking, from our 
point of view. I am happy to report 
that, in most of these, we have made 
progress since the early decision not to 
move forward with the MCCONNELL bill. 
But there is more work to do. 
I think it is naive to believe this is 
the last piece of legislation that will be 
needed. We don’t know where America 
will stand in 30, 60, or 90 days. But 
whatever it takes—whatever it takes— 
we need to come together as a nation, 
put aside political differences, and 
agree on a strategy that serves the best 
interests of families across our coun-
try, red and blue States alike, and do it 
here in Washington as well. 
Engaging the House of Representa-
tives in the earliest stages of these ne-
gotiations just makes common sense. 
Whatever we agree to here has to head 
over to the House of Representatives 
for approval as well. So let’s involve 
the Speaker, involve the Republican 
leader in the House—the four corners 
that Senator SCHUMER asked for at the 
earliest stage of this conversation. To 
me, that is the best way to achieve it. 
For those who see an empty Chamber 
and wonder if work is being done, as I 
mentioned earlier, just across the hall-
way, Senator SCHUMER, who may come 
to the floor in a moment to give us an 
update, has been negotiating around 
the clock with the White House and 
with Senator MCCONNELL to come up 
with a better bipartisan package to 
move forward from this point. 
I am going to close now with just one 
point I would like to make, and that is 
that many of my colleagues are joining 
Senator PORTMAN and me in cospon-
soring what we have called the remote 
voting amendment in the Senate rules. 
It is complex because it is the first of 
its kind where we are discussing using

modern technology to meet our con-
stitutional responsibilities and obliga-
tions. The reason, of course, is obvious. 
We shouldn’t be gathering on the floor 
in groups. We have been warned by the 
Centers for Disease Control not to do 
that. Yet we do it because we have very 
few alternatives. 
So I am hoping we can work with the 
Parliamentarian and with the officers 
of the Senate to come up with some-
thing that is bipartisan, makes sense, 
and protects the integrity of voting on 
the floor of the U.S. Senate. 
We need to do our jobs, even in times 
of national crisis, whether it is a public 
health crisis or a threat of terrorism. 
Let us devise a way—let’s work hard on 
it—that both the Senate and, I hope, 
the House can agree on that respects 
the rules and traditions of the Senate 
but gives us options that make more 
sense in this time of special peril. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, I want to thank my good friend, 
the Senator from Illinois, for his out-
standing work on this issue. He has 
been such a strong voice for the work-
ing families of America, for the people 
who need help. And his empathy and 
understanding of how average folks are 
suffering is very, very important. 
In fact, I just spoke to his Governor, 
J. B. Pritzker, and told him that Sen-
ator DURBIN is working very hard on 
something we Democrats believe is im-
portant, and that is money for the 
States and localities because they are 
getting clobbered economically by this 
crisis. They have new expenses, and 
without tax returns being filed until 
June, much of their income is not 
going to be there because of States fil-
ing in concert with the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Now, I will be brief. I just finished a 
very productive meeting with Sec-
retary Mnuchin, the White House con-
gressional liaison, Eric Ueland, and 
MARK MEADOWS, the President’s Acting 
Chief of Staff. 
Last night, I thought we were on the 
5-yard line; right now, we are on the 2. 
As I also said last night, at this point, 
of the few outstanding issues, I don’t 
see any that can’t be overcome within 
the next few hours. 
Here are the things that we have 
been fighting for, we Senate Demo-
crats. First, a Marshall Plan for our 
medical system. Our hospitals, our 
nursing homes, our community health 
centers—our 
whole 
healthcare 
sys-
tem—need desperately needed dollars. 
They need them fast, and they need 
them in a very large amount. 
Hospital beds have to expand. Ex-
panding capacity is not easy. The need 
for ventilators, for PPEs for the work-
ers, for masks, even things as simple as 
swabs are not always available. And in 
New York City, New York State, and 
around the country, hospitals are going 
to be overwhelmed. Our big hospitals, 
our medium-size hospitals, our small 
hospitals, and the small and rural hos-
pitals actually face the risk of closing 
if we don’t help them. 
So we Senate Democrats have been 
pushing very hard for an increase, a 
significant increase, in money for the 
healthcare system. We are very, very 
pleased with what seems to be moving 
forward in the bill, in the bipartisan 
bill, that we hope will be brought to 
the floor. 
Second, workers first—the title of 
our Democratic plan has been ‘‘Work-
ers First.’’ We believe we have to put 
working 
people—families, 
average 
Americans—ahead 
of 
anybody 
else. 
They are losing their jobs through no 
fault of their own. Their kids are stay-
ing home because there is no school. 
There are so many—so many—prob-
lems that are befalling average people, 
so we wanted to put them first. That 
has been our No. 1 goal, along with the 
Marshall Plan for hospitals. 
This bill, as it comes forward, as it is 
now at least being agreed upon, has a 
lot of that. It has unemployment insur-
ance on steroids. This is a great plan. 
What it says is that if you lose your job 
in this crisis, you can be furloughed by 
your employer. That means you stay 
on that employer’s payroll. If you have 
health benefits with the employer, you 
can keep getting them. But, and most 
importantly, the Federal Government 
will pay your salary, your full salary, 
for now 4 months. We had asked for 4 
months, and 4 months looks like what 
we are going to get when we come to 
this agreement. 
It will mean two things. Most of all, 
it will put money into the hands of 
those who need it so much because 
they have lost their jobs, as I said, 
through no fault of their own. So that 
is vitally important, and that will 
pump money into the economy prob-
ably in a better way than anything else 
could do. 
It also has a second benefit. It will 
keep companies intact. The small res-
taurant owner, the middle-size busi-
ness, even the large businesses worry 
that if they just had to remove their 
workers, fire them because they don’t 
have any money coming in, those 
workers would scatter to the winds, 
and they would look for other jobs, and 
when, God willing, this awful crisis is 
over, these businesses would not be 
able to reassemble. But with our plan, 
since they stay on the payroll of their 
employer, as soon as the crisis is over, 
they all can come back together, and 
that small restaurant, that middle-size 
manufacturing facility, and the service 
business will be able to reassemble 
quickly, and we can get the economy 
going again. That is another thing we 
have been fighting for. 
We have been fighting very hard that 
any bailout funds—money to industries 
that have trouble—have real oversight 
and transparency. That is vitally im-
portant. We cannot have the situation 
where, when a company is getting 
money from the Treasury, the Federal 
Reserve, we don’t know about it. And 
we have been pushing hard that for any 
contract 
the 
Federal 
Government 
makes with a company to give it loans, 
we know of that contract in a very 
short period of time so that we can ex-
amine it. And we, in the Senate, those 
in the House, the press, and the Amer-
ican public will see if those things are 
on the level because we all know there 
was a load of dissatisfaction with 
TARP. 
In addition, we are fighting for over-
sight, a new inspector general, to be 
able to look into these contracts. We 
would like very much, and believe we 
should have, a congressional oversight 
board as well. We are fighting for 
transparency, oversight, and disclosure 
when the Federal Government gives 
corporations money. 
We also want to make sure that 
workers are put first in these situa-
tions so that when there are direct 
Federal grants and direct Federal loans 
to these companies, they either have 
incentive or mandate to keep their em-
ployees and their benefits. We are mak-
ing very good progress in that direc-
tion as well. 
Small business—we all ache for these 
small business owners, probably second 
to the people who have illness in their 
families. We ache for these folks. My 
father was a small businessman. He 
had a little exterminating business. It 
was never very successful. He would 
pace the floor Sunday night at 2 a.m. 
because he hated going to work. So I 
know what people go through. You put 
your blood, sweat, and tears into your 
small business, and all of a sudden, it 
looks like it is blown away. Well, there 
is a very fine proposal, bipartisan, on 
small business that I believe will be in 
this package as well. 
So there are lots of good things here. 
We all know that not everyone is going 
to want every provision. We all know 
there are many things that so many of 
us want that are left out, but we all 
know we must do these things. 
We are not looking for things that 
are extraneous to this crisis, and I 
don’t believe they are in this package. 
We are looking at things that deal di-
rectly with this crisis, and that is what 
we have proposed here as Democrats in 
the Senate. Whether it be workers 
first, helping our medical system, pro-
viding oversight and transparency in 
the boards, and helping small business, 
those are all directly related to the cri-
sis. We need them soon. We need them 
desperately. 
In the last few days, we have made 
huge progress in achieving these goals. 
Again, I hope, I pray, that we can come 
together very quickly and pass in large 
numbers the bipartisan bill that will 
help the American people, who so 
badly, badly, badly need our help. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia.

am glad to be on the floor right now to

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1985 
March 24, 2020 
Democratic leader talk about the prin-
ciples of a bill that we want to pass and 
wanted to pass 2 days ago. 
The principles of helping workers 
first, the principles of helping small 
business, the principles of looking after 
the healthcare system in its entirety— 
these are the fundamentals of the bill 
that we have worked on together, in a 
bipartisan way. Both the Democratic 
whip and the Democratic leader said 
that this is and has been a bipartisan 
bill. 
I just got off the telephone with my 
local radio station, and I had to fight 
back the notion that the bill that was 
before us yesterday and Sunday was a 
strictly Republican bill; it was not. 
The bill that has the small business 
provisions that the Democratic leader 
just said was worked on in a bipartisan 
way, which we all know was and is a 
great idea. Jointly, we agree on that. 
So I am glad to see the acknowledge-
ment that, yes, we have been working 
together; yes, we have had conversa-
tions across the line; and, yes, we have 
worked on issues that we know are 
going to put workers and families 
across this Nation first. 
So I have spent a lot of time, as all 
of us have, talking to county commis-
sioners, our mayors, the Governor, 
health professionals, small business 
owners, individuals, moms and dads, 
wondering, Is it safe to have somebody 
help me with the kids? What kind of 
contact should I have with my grand-
children? This is something I am in 
constant debate on myself with my 
own grandchildren. 
So I think what I get from every-
body—more than anything—is not just 
the urgency of now but the urgency of 
yesterday and the day before. So I am 
glad to hear the leader say that we are 
close, on the 5-yard line or the 2-yard 
line. But let’s not get into too many 
football analogies. We have all been to 
football games where we have been on 
the 2 and people have fumbled the ball. 
We can’t do that because it has been 
fumbled long enough. 
So, for the past few days, I have been 
very frustrated, as have many of my 
colleagues. I know my fellow Senator 
from Iowa, who is here on the floor 
with me, and, certainly, the Presiding 
Officer from Georgia have had great 
angst and great frustrations that care 
has been delayed when Americans need 
it 
the 
most—both 
economic 
and 
healthcare. 
My West Virginians, they want to 
make sure that our hospitals, our com-
munity health centers, and other pro-
viders—our nursing homes, our ex-
tended-care 
facilities—have 
the 
re-
sources that they need to provide the 
best coverage. That has been in this 
bill. 
I heard the urgency of PPE. We hear 
that all over the country, certainly in 
our State, and, also, swabs and other 
testing equipment. This is part of that 
bill but also our hospitals, which are 
hurting because they don’t have the 
elective surgeries; they don’t have the 
revenues to keep them going. 
The $75 billion that we have in it— 
sounds like it may be more—fine, good. 
Let’s keep our hospitals going, particu-
larly our rural hospitals in rural areas 
where they don’t have the availability 
of healthcare like they have in other 
places. 
But, I tell you, we want our hospitals 
to be open. What West Virginians don’t 
want is a delay in getting them the 
help they need just to score political 
points. 
The other things West Virginians 
want are the best medical care for our 
veterans. We have four medical cen-
ters. We have a very patriotic State 
that has some of the highest per-capita 
military and veterans in the entire 
country. We want help for our vet-
erans. 
What we don’t want is to use a crisis 
to advance a partisan or ideological 
agenda, which we have seen. West Vir-
ginians want to make sure that we 
have protective equipment for doctors, 
nurses, and first responders on the 
frontline. I talked to some of my vol-
unteer fire departments. You don’t 
think how deep this goes or how deep 
the need is for personal protective 
equipment until you start thinking 
about all the different ways people 
have contact. I tell you what—they 
don’t want a Green New Deal in this 
bill; they want blue masks. 
West Virginians want research into 
new vaccines and treatments to help 
fight the coronavirus and end this epi-
demic. When we think about how we 
are going to get out of this, stopping 
the flow of the virus is certainly No. 1. 
But we also have to get confidence 
back that, if this comes back later, we 
have the vaccines or the therapeutics 
that are going to help people be 
healthier and fight the spread of the 
virus. 
What they don’t want are regulations 
and bureaucracies that get in the way 
of action. Our bill helped a lot with al-
leviating some of those regulatory bur-
dens that we see our healthcare pro-
viders fighting—at least in times of an 
emergency, 
alleviating 
those 
regu-
latory burdens. 
West Virginians want to allow more 
medical visits to be done by telemedi-
cine during this crisis to keep our pa-
tients and our providers safe. 
What they don’t want is to read to-
morrow morning a newspaper article 
that says who are the political winners 
and losers in this because they know, 
essentially, people are the ones who are 
losing by the stall tactics that we have 
seen. 
West Virginians want to help small 
businesses. We are probably 99 percent 
small business in our State—a small 
State. We want to stay afloat and keep 
our employees on the payroll. 
What we don’t want is for others to 
not realize the urgency that small 
business is feeling. As I said, not the 
urgency of now—the urgency of yester-
day. 
We just had a shelter-in-place put in 
place in our State. Think of all the im-
pacts this has across our State and the 
State of Iowa and others. 
West Virginians want a financial 
boost to our families during this uncer-
tain time. This is in the bill. I heard 
the leader talk about it like it was a 
new concept. It has been there. It has 
been in the bill. 
They don’t want us to leave our com-
munities without the tools they need 
to confront this crisis. 
West Virginians, we always really 
band together. We really do every-
where, but I have a particular pride, I 
think, in my State around neighbors 
helping neighbors. 
West Virginians want us to assist 
workers who have been laid off as a re-
sult of the emergency by extending un-
employment benefits. Again, it is in 
there. It has been in there. 
They don’t want for us to fail to show 
compassion for our fellow citizens dur-
ing an emergency. 
West Virginians want to keep edu-
cating our students. We have a par-
ticular issue here with our tele-edu-
cation because we don’t have the 
broadband. That is a subject for a dif-
ferent day. I know part of that is in 
this bill, but if anybody joins with me 
in this fight, which many of us have, 
the urgency of yesterday is here on the 
delivery of broadband services into 
rural America. 
What we don’t want is a Federal 
takeover of our election system that 
requires 
same-day 
registration 
and 
places 
Washington 
bureaucrats 
in 
charge of our local officials. West Vir-
ginia has a primary on May 12. I am 
working with the Secretary of State 
and the Governor to make sure that 
our State formulates how we can get as 
many people voting by mail as possible 
within the parameters of the way we 
want to conduct our elections. We 
don’t need a one-size-fits-all here. We 
need to keep the States in charge. 
West Virginians want to stabilize our 
economy and do everything possible to 
avoid a long-lasting economic reces-
sion. 
What we don’t want is to enact 
Speaker PELOSI’s Christmas list that 
includes new regulations on carbon 
emissions, wind, and solar tax credits, 
corporate board diversity reports, and 
a cap-and-trade program for our air-
lines. 
We have a bill before us. We have had 
it before us for several days. It is ap-
propriately called the CARES Act be-
cause it takes care of a lot of the prior-
ities and issues that we have been talk-
ing about, that we hear about in our 
tele-townhalls or in talking to our 
neighbors and talking to our constitu-
ents, the urgency of not now—yester-
day. We face a great public health 
threat, and we face a severe threat to 
our economy. 
I am a total optimist about every-
thing. My glass is always half full and 
I know we are going to get through this 
and I know we are going to survive it. 
I know we are going to be better for it 
because we are going to learn lessons,

but it sure is tough when you are in it. 
Even a full-blown optimistic person, I 
admit to myself and to you today, I 
have had some pretty low points during 
this whole thing, where I have won-
dered, where are we going? 
The last thing we need is the polit-
ical debate that we have had over the 
last 2 days over programs and the pa-
rameters that were just laid out by the 
Democratic leader that were in the 
bill, have been in the bill. 
So we must come together—bipar-
tisan. All of us work together. I work 
with the Senator from Delaware. We 
are on EPW together. He was born in 
West Virginia, so he can’t get too far 
away from me, and we work together a 
lot across party lines. This is an exam-
ple, and I think we are seeing that now. 
I think that, with the leader’s com-
ments, we see we are making great 
progress here. 
So I am encouraged that the deal is 
almost closed and that today might be 
the day that we will join together and 
that we will stop delaying care. Be-
cause today is the day—yesterday 
could have been the day, but today is 
the day—because I am an optimist, and 
I am always looking forward—today is 
the day we come together and take 
bold action for the American people. I 
know that is what Americans want, 
and I know that is what my West Vir-
ginians want. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
CRUZ). The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would 
say to my colleague, my West Virginia 
colleague and friend: Don’t lose that 
sense of optimism. It is going to carry 
us through this and, hopefully, well be-
yond. 
I live in Delaware. My wife and I live 
in Delaware. We live in the same house 
we have lived in for—gosh—33 years, 
and we raised our sons there and sent 
them off into the world. 
Every morning that I get up and I 
come here, I go to the train station. It 
used to take maybe 15 minutes from 
my house to get to the train station. 
Today there were just a few cars on the 
road—no buses. I got to the train sta-
tion, and most of the doors were closed. 
Up on the platform, I think two people 
were on the platform to catch the train 
that ultimately brought me down here. 
A lot of people whom I passed by on 
the way to the train station, some peo-
ple had slept out overnight—destitute, 
asking for money. Then, off the train 
station here, an hour and a half later, 
in Union Station, walking through the 
train station, it was almost empty. The 
train I had been on was almost empty. 
A number of the people whom I did 
run into walking through the station 
and out of the station, came out Dela-
ware Avenue to the Capitol, where peo-
ple were, again, destitute and begging 
for money. 
There are a lot of people who showed 
up last week and the week before in 
this country to ask for and sign up for 
unemployment benefits. They never 
imagined in their life that they would 
be in this situation. 
A lot of people who signed up in the 
last 2 weeks for food, what used to be 
food stamps—SNAP—food benefits for 
their family, they never imagined they 
would face this situation. 
My colleagues call me a recovering 
Governor. I was privileged to be Gov-
ernor of Delaware for 8 years. I chaired 
the National Governors Association. 
The Governors who met on the 50–State 
conference call several days ago, I was 
fortunate enough to talk to some of 
them afterward and ask them what 
their priorities were. 
They said, among other things: We 
want to make sure, when people file for 
unemployment insurance, if they are 
eligible for it, that it will actually be 
there; and these State funds that were 
created, contributed to by employers in 
50 States across America, when they 
are depleted, there needs to be a 
backup. They were pleading with us to 
make sure that that backup is there. 
I am encouraged that the package 
that is before us today will provide 
that liquidity, if you will, for unem-
ployment insurance so people will ac-
tually be able to get not necessarily 
their full payroll or full salary—full 
paycheck—back but at least maybe 
enough to get by. 
The Governors asked that we—they 
use the term ‘‘plus-up’’ the SNAP pro-
gram. We used to have food stamps. We 
now 
have 
something 
called 
SNAP 
cards, and they can be plussed-up or 
down remotely, electronically, and the 
Governors were asking that we do 
something about that to make sure 
that not only people have at least some 
kind of payment coming in, through 
unemployment 
insurance, 
to 
their 
homes but also something—some addi-
tional benefits for the SNAP program. 
I don’t think we are going to get 
that. We made some progress on SNAP 
in the last package that came through 
a week or so ago. And we probably, es-
pecially, need to focus on food benefits 
for families who have kids in schools. 
Schools are closed. Those kids used to 
get their lunch—maybe their break-
fast—at their school. They are not get-
ting it now. Those families, especially, 
are going to need some help. 
The third area I want to mention is 
health benefits—health benefits. A lot 
of people who have very good health in-
surance benefits through their em-
ployer are going to lose them or face 
the possibility of losing them. There 
are going to be people—millions of peo-
ple across the country—who are going 
to sign up for Medicaid who never 
thought they would be in a position to 
have to do that. 
The Governors are asking that we do 
a little bit more to help make sure that 
Medicaid, which is partly funded by the 
Federal Government and partly by the 
States—that there are sufficient dol-
lars to meet the demand for healthcare 
through Medicaid that certainly would 
not have been imagined a month or so 
ago. 
I want to just mention a couple of 
things. I see a colleague from Iowa is 
here, and I don’t want to take too 
much more time, but I am asking in-
dulgence for just a couple of minutes. 
One of our colleagues mentioned 
today looking ahead to the elections 
and thinking about the elections. We 
have great concerns about election se-
curity these days, with the Russians 
trying to interfere with our elections 
again. 
We have a Postal Service that is in 
dire straits. The Postal Service, as we 
know it, has faced great challenges in 
recent years because of the lack of 
first-class mail. People have moved off 
first-class mail into email to do busi-
ness and personal communications. 
The Postal Service is in dire straits. 
One of the ways we could help them is 
to expand vote by mail. Every State 
with counties and cities that have pri-
maries and general elections would be 
a source of revenue for the Postal Serv-
ice going forward. It actually helps ad-
dress the concerns we have about the 
Russians interfering in our business. 
In the last week or so—I know my 
colleagues did as well—I called really 
smart people I know who have been 
leaders in this country—people like 
Leon 
Panetta, 
Sylvia 
Mathews 
Burwell, John Kasich, and any number 
of other people—Democrats and Repub-
licans—just to pick their brains as to 
what they thought we should do. Some 
of the best advice from people like 
Leon Panetta, Mark Sandy, and several 
others used the three Ts. 
I said: Well, what are the three Ts? 
He said: When you are putting to-
gether this package, always remember 
the three Ts. 
What are they? 
He said: They are timely—whatever 
we do should be timely; targeted—it 
should be targeted; and it should be 
temporary. 
I believe that is what we are trying 
to do with this huge package—enor-
mous package. I never imagined we 
would be dealing with one bill of this 
size and magnitude. 
Timely, 
temporary, 
targeted—we 
have added one to that. Democrats sug-
gested this, and I think the Repub-
licans embraced this idea. It also 
should be transparent—transparent. 
I have a bunch of quotes I carry 
around with me on my cell phone. 
Sometimes I need some inspiration, 
and I pull out my cell phone and look 
at a couple of quotes. In anticipation of 
saying something today, I looked at a 
few of my favorites. One is John Ken-
nedy. I think it is especially timely 
right now. One said: ‘‘Let us not seek 
the Republican answer or the Demo-
cratic answer but the right answer’’— 
the right answer. 
Another quote I carry around on my 
phone is one by Churchill. Churchill 
used to say: The worst form of govern-
ment devised by man is democracy. De-
mocracy is the worst form of govern-
ment, except for all the rest. What he 
was saying there is this is a hard way

to govern. It sure is, especially in the 
midst of a pandemic, the likes of which 
we have never seen in our lifetime. 
The third one that comes to mind is 
actually an African proverb. It goes 
something like this: 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you 
want to go far, go together. 
Think about that. 
If you want to go fast, go alone. If you 
want to go far, go together. 
I think what we have coming to-
gether here is our Democrats and Re-
publicans—and maybe an Independent 
or two—who have decided over the last 
several days that despite our dif-
ferences, there is not a Republican an-
swer and there is not a Democratic an-
swer; they are the right answers. Hope-
fully, we get more right answers in this 
package—which I expect we will be 
considering later today—than wrong 
answers. The American people are 
counting on us to pull together, and I 
think we are beginning to do that. 
I would close by saying that this is 
not the first package—legislative pack-
age—that we prepared to adopt in the 
last 2 weeks or so. This is No. 3. People 
smarter than me say there will prob-
ably be a No. 4 and maybe No. 5 as we 
learn more going forward. 
The first one is pretty small, $3 bil-
lion. The second, which focused on a 
lot on testing, was over $100 billion. 
This one is many, many, many times 
that amount. 
I hope folks across the country will 
be encouraged that we were able to get 
it mostly right in the first legislative 
package and get it mostly right in the 
second legislative package. This one is 
huge. It took another week or so to 
pound it out, but I think it is probably 
better because we have gone slowly. 
I say to the American people, take 
heart. We have been through a lot 
worse than this in our lifetime—a civil 
war that killed about 800,000 men: fam-
ilies against families, brothers against 
brothers. Hundreds of thousands of 
other women, children, and old people 
were killed. After the Civil War was 
over, President Lincoln was assas-
sinated. A short while later, his suc-
cessor, Andrew Johnson from Ten-
nessee, was impeached. 
We somehow made it out of that cen-
tury to get into the 20th century just 
in time to fight not one world war but 
two 
world 
wars—fought 
them, 
led 
them, won them. The Cold War—led it, 
won it. And when the sun came up on 
January 1, 2001, here is where we were 
as a nation: We had the strongest econ-
omy on Earth. We had the most pro-
ductive workforce on Earth. We had 
four balanced budgets in a row. We 
hadn’t balanced our budget since 1968, 
but we ended up in the last 4 years of 
the Clinton administration with four 
balanced budgets in a row, with a Re-
publican-led Congress. 
We are the mightiest force for justice 
and the most admired Nation on Earth. 
If we can get through everything from 
the Civil War through the first day of 
2001, we can get through this as well. 
People are looking to us to lead. I hope 
and pray that later today that is ex-
actly what we will do. 
I want to thank everybody who is 
working very hard on our side, our 
leadership, our caucus and the Repub-
lican side, their leadership. I was sit-
ting in CHUCK SCHUMER’s vestibule ear-
lier today, and Secretary Mnuchin was 
going back and forth, and MARK MEAD-
OWS, who is the new Chief of Staff, was 
going back and forth. CHUCK SCHUMER 
and others—there was lot of activity 
and, I think, a little more optimism 
than I have seen in the last several 
days. 
America, take heart. We will get 
through this. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, we have a 
clear objective right now, which is to 
get additional, immediate relief into 
the hands of the American worker and 
to do it fast. That is what we are fo-
cused on, folks. That is what we have 
been focused on since passing the phase 
1 package, and then the House-led 
phase 2 relief package last week. 
The phase 2 bill was not perfect, but 
I was happy to support it because it 
was the right thing to do. It was the 
support that Iowans needed. Since 
President Trump signed that package 
last Wednesday—nearly a week ago—I 
have continued to hear from Iowans— 
those in our hospital industry, those in 
the restaurant industry, agriculture, 
trucking, retail, childcare, biofuels. I 
have heard from all of them, one-on- 
one conversations about the need for 
additional and immediate relief—relief 
for the young families in Iowa right 
now who are feeling very anxious about 
how they are going to make that end- 
of-the-month rent payment come April 
1; relief for the nurses, like my cousin, 
and the doctors who are fretting about 
going into work because they don’t 
have the personal protective equip-
ment they need to prevent them from 
getting and spreading the coronavirus; 
and relief for the small business owner 
who so badly wants to able to keep her 
employees on the payroll so that when 
we get through this pandemic—and 
folks, we will get through this pan-
demic—she can get her business up and 
running and can keep sending her em-
ployees those paychecks. We have a lot 
of those small business owners all 
across our Main Streets and all around 
our squares in Iowa. 
I also think about the seniors across 
my home State of Iowa who are prob-
ably worried about access to the med-
ical services and the care they might 
need during these very challenging 
times or the middle-aged couple who 
have been looking at the market and 
seeing those markets spiraling down 
every single day and wondering, What 
does that mean for our future and for 
our retirement plans? 
Folks, the American people are hurt-
ing right now. They are very anxious. 
And now, more than ever, they are 
looking to us. Iowans and, of course, 
all Americans need to know that we 
have their back and that their liveli-
hoods are our top priority. 
What we have seen over the past sev-
eral days is a very sad attempt by folks 
across the aisle to stall and exploit this 
crisis as an opportunity to jam through 
their political wish list. Folks, we can 
have those policy debates. We can have 
those another day. But with each pass-
ing minute we waste, more lives are at 
risk, more jobs are lost, and more com-
munities are turned upside down. 
We are not going to play games any-
more in the U.S. Senate. The American 
people have made it quite clear: They 
need relief, and they need it now. This 
phase 3 relief package is not and will 
not be a ‘‘Christmas tree’’ bill. In fact, 
folks, it has been the product of hours 
and hours of bipartisan negotiations 
from five different groups. Those work-
ing groups have worked late into the 
night and over the weekend to come up 
with a good bill for the American peo-
ple. This bill is squarely focused on 
getting immediate relief to millions of 
hard-working Americans across our 
great United States. 
Just a while ago, the Democratic 
leader was on the floor, and he was 
touting a number of these provisions. 
As my colleague from West Virginia 
pointed out, those provisions the leader 
is touting have been in this package. 
These are not new provisions. These 
are not new provisions, folks. We 
should have, and we could have, ad-
vanced this bill days ago. 
This bipartisan phase 3 package in-
cludes billions of dollars for our Na-
tion’s healthcare workers and our 
healthcare system as a whole. This has 
been a big priority of mine—something 
I have heard from time and again from 
Iowa’s hospitals and healthcare profes-
sionals and something I have called on 
Congress to respond to: billions of dol-
lars for additional personal protective 
equipment 
and 
other 
materials. 
Healthcare workers are depending on 
us to help increase the supply of the 
PPE they need so that they can con-
tinue to battle the spread of the 
coronavirus and care for their patients, 
some of whom are our most vulnerable. 
There are billions of dollars for small 
businesses across our States to be able 
to keep employees on the payroll and 
pay their bills. Again, that is a huge 
priority for Iowa. Again, as my col-
league from West Virginia stated, 
about 99 percent of her businesses in 
West Virginia are small businesses. 
That is true in Iowa, as well, with 99 
percent of our businesses being small 
businesses. 
There are billions of dollars to pro-
vide direct financial assistance to indi-
vidual Americans to ensure access to 
testing and a future coronavirus vac-
cine is covered at no cost—at no cost— 
to the individual and dollars going to 
expanded telehealth and to increase 
care for our veterans and also to pro-
vide unemployment insurance and to 
defer student loans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1988 
March 24, 2020 
Folks, the list goes on and on and on. 
This bipartisan phase 3 relief package 
is focused on the American worker and 
our American family. 
Again, many of these provisions have 
been in the bill since the beginning. 
These are not new provisions. We need 
to stop these stall tactics. It is not 
time for long, drawn-out policy debates 
on the floor of the Senate. 
Folks, now is the time for action. It 
is time for Congress to step up, put 
aside our partisan wants, and show up 
for the people of our States. 
I am an eternal optimist, and I have 
hope that we will be able to come to-
gether and reassure the American peo-
ple that they are our top priority. 
Each and every one of us in this body 
has an obligation to the men and the 
women who elected us to do our jobs, 
and right now our job is to get Ameri-
cans the relief that in some instances 
they are literally crying for. 
To my friends across the aisle, I be-
lieve you know what the right thing to 
do is. Join us. Put the people ahead of 
party. Help us deliver additional relief 
to the men, the women, and the chil-
dren of our great Nation. Let’s pass 
this phase 3 relief package today. 
Folks, we all want you to stay safe 
and stay strong. God bless you all. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, with 
every day that passes, the number of 
COVID–19, or coronavirus, cases con-
tinues to tick up, up, and up. A report 
by the World Health Organization last 
week noted that while it took more 
than 3 months to reach 100,000 cases 
worldwide, it took only 12 days to hit 
another 100,000. It doubled in 12 days. 
Now we know it took less than a week 
to add the next 100,000. Some of this is 
because of increased access to testing— 
something we knew we were not 
ramped up to do. 
More and more people are getting 
tested. That is good news. Those who 
have the virus can be isolated and 
treated, if necessary. Those who don’t 
have the peace of mind knowing that 
they do not carry the disease and they 
can—by virtue of good personal hy-
giene and social distancing—remain 
healthy. 
But if we are going to have any suc-
cess at slowing the trajectory of this 
virus and minimizing the economic 
harm, the time to act is now. The eyes 
of the Nation are upon us. They want 
to know if partisanship can be set aside 
in the face of a pandemic. They want 
us to know that partisanship is an in-
dulgence we cannot afford. 
If you are trying to figure out the an-
swer, let me recap what has happened 
in the Senate recently. 
For 
weeks, 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues agreed that this is indeed a cri-
sis, that we need to act promptly and 
we need to shed our partisanship be-
cause our country can’t wait. I agree. 
Our country is in dire need, and this is 
no time for politics as usual. 
Indeed, this has always been our cus-
tom. This has always been our instinct 
as Americans during crises like 9/11 and 
like the great recession of 2008. We 
would have every reason to expect that 
in the face of another national crisis, 
like the coronavirus, Democrats and 
Republicans would work together, but 
that has not been the case. 
We now need Republicans and Demo-
crats to come together as we have in 
the past to deliver on our shared prior-
ities to support our country during this 
unprecedented time. 
There is, in fact, broad bipartisan 
agreement about the result. We need to 
get relief directly from Washington to 
the American people as soon as pos-
sible. We need to provide small busi-
nesses with help so they can survive 
this storm and so that once the virus is 
defeated, they are still around to pro-
vide jobs to people they have now had 
to furlough or lay off. There seems to 
be broad bipartisan agreement that we 
need a freeze on student loan payments 
to provide peace of mind to tens of mil-
lions of borrowers. Employees who 
have been impacted by the virus should 
get support now, and they should have 
jobs to come back to later. 
Over the weekend, it seemed like we 
were making good progress. There had 
been negotiating between the parties, 
compromising. As of Sunday morning, 
it looked like we were just about there. 
Then the Speaker of the House and the 
minority leader of the Senate decided 
the crisis should not be wasted. They 
claimed all of a sudden that the deal 
was not good enough even though they 
themselves helped to write it. The 
Speaker in particular played a unique 
role in blowing this up. After sending 
the House home for a weeklong vaca-
tion, she flew back into town at the 
eleventh hour and laid waste to count-
less hours of bipartisan work. 
When the time came for a routine 
procedural vote in the Senate that 
would start the process of considering 
legislation and would have provided us 
even more time to debate it, Demo-
crats—on a party line led by the Demo-
cratic leader—killed it dead in its 
tracks. 
It is hard to think of an appropriate 
metaphor during a time like this, but 
when our Nation is on fire, Democrats 
decided to shoot the tires on the 
firetruck that was going to put out the 
fire. In doing so, they fell in lockstep, 
in spite of the fact that many of them 
had helped negotiate the bill, and they 
flushed every ounce of progress we had 
made over the weekend down the drain. 
Less than 24 hours later, we held an-
other routine procedural vote. Once 
again, Democrats, in lockstep, blocked 
us from even considering this bipar-
tisan legislation, which has their fin-
gerprints all over it. They claim they 
are still not happy with the text—or 
weren’t at the time, anyway. Yet that 
claim clearly doesn’t hold water. 
We continue to hear update after up-
date with Senator SCHUMER saying: A 
deal is close. A deal is close. 
But with each hour—let alone day— 
that passes, the number of corona cases 
is rising. The number of people dead of 
this virus is rising. Our public health 
system is taking a beating. The minor-
ity leader’s home State of New York is 
among the hardest hit. They now have 
25,000 confirmed cases in New York, 
and the number of cases doubles every 
3 days. You would think the Demo-
cratic leader would have a sense of ur-
gency about getting help to his own 
constituents in New York. 
If there was any doubt that our 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
prioritize politics over the health and 
safety of their constituents, let me tell 
you about some of the changes they 
were after. The minority leader wanted 
to include in this legislation an expan-
sion of tax credits for wind and solar 
energy. They wanted to give unprece-
dented authority to organized labor 
and to address fuel emission standards 
for airlines—none of which is relevant 
to the immediate crisis that is at hand. 
While these are normal topics that 
we would debate and vote on during 
normal times, they are not the sort of 
things that ought to occupy 1 minute 
of our time during this crisis. While 
doctors and nurses have bruises on 
their faces from wearing masks and 
goggles for 12-plus hours a day, this 
sideshow should not be part of the mi-
nority leader’s priorities. 
Clearly, his goal was not to make the 
legislation better for healthcare profes-
sionals or the millions of workers who 
lost their jobs. He is trying to use this 
national emergency as an opportunity 
to enact dramatic liberal policy re-
forms that have nothing to do with this 
crisis. People are dying. Hospitals are 
overwhelmed. Small businesses have 
closed their doors, and workers have 
lost their jobs. The American people do 
not have time for his games. This virus 
is spreading at an exponential rate, and 
we can’t afford to waste time fighting 
one another over these sorts of irrele-
vant partisan sideshows. 
I know under normal circumstances 
this kind of gamesmanship is part of 
the process, but now, in the face of this 
crisis, it is absolutely unconscionable. 
It is reckless and irresponsible. 
A pandemic has swept across the 
country with alarming speed. Our hos-
pitals are in need of personal protec-
tive equipment, businesses have shut 
their doors, employees have been laid 
off, and people across the country won-
der just how long they can survive at 
this pace. 
The bill we had last Sunday would 
have taken major steps to support our 
country during this crisis. It would 
have sent desperately needed funding 
to the hospitals that are struggling to 
manage a new influx of patients and 
helped fight the shortage of masks and 
other personal protective equipment. It 
would have provided direct financial 
assistance for middle-class families. A 
family of four would have received up 
to $3,400 to help cover rent, groceries, 
electric bills, and other expenses in the

interim between being laid off and 
being able to qualify for unemploy-
ment compensation. We would have 
provided them a lifeline, and we still 
need to do it, and we need to do it now. 
This legislation, which we could have 
passed 2 days ago, would have delivered 
relief for small businesses that are 
struggling to stay afloat and ensured 
that their employees impacted by this 
coronavirus would be taken care of. 
What is more, those small businesses 
need to be able to continue to exist so 
that when we defeat this virus, people 
will actually have jobs to go back to. 
But our Democratic colleagues said 
that wasn’t good enough. They chose to 
put their partisan political agenda 
ahead of the health and safety of the 
American people. So here we are with 
no end in sight. We keep reading re-
ports from the minority leader and 
others saying: Well, the bill is on the 2- 
yard line. Well, you can have the dis-
tance and still never get across the 
goal. 
Yesterday, House Democrats released 
their own coronavirus package, which 
is really amazing in the face of this bi-
partisan-negotiated 
bill. 
Speaker 
PELOSI parachutes back into town after 
a weeklong vacation and drops an 1,100- 
page piece of a bill which includes a 
host of proposals that have absolutely 
nothing to do with solving this crisis. 
As I mentioned, this includes emissions 
mandates for airlines, tens of millions 
of dollars for the John F. Kennedy Cen-
ter for Performing Arts, and early-vot-
ing and vote-by-mail requirements for 
every State across the country. This 
isn’t a sincere effort to support our 
healthcare 
providers, 
workers, 
and 
small businesses; it is a naked attempt 
to use a public health emergency as a 
smoke screen for their radical agenda. 
Democrats’ 
priority 
simply 
isn’t 
solving the healthcare and economic 
crisis we are dealing with today. It is 
not. If it were, Senate Democrats 
would not have voted against a bipar-
tisan relief bill two times already. And 
now House Democrats are flaunting a 
bill that does more to advance their 
agenda and does not solve the crisis at 
hand. We don’t have time for more lib-
eral virtue signaling. We need to act 
and act now. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mrs. FISCHER. Mr. President, yes-
terday, I came to the floor to talk 
about the need to provide relief for 
families across this country who are 
hurting because of this coronavirus cri-
sis. I said that people are frightened, 
that they are stressed, and that they 
are looking to us to take action. Many 
people have lost their jobs. Many are 
watching their hard-earned savings 
evaporate. Many don’t know when they 
will be able to go back to work. 
Here in this body, my colleagues and 
I are trying to move forward on a bill 
that would provide relief to individ-
uals, to families, to small and medium- 
sized businesses, and to our agriculture 
producers. Our bill would help to sta-
bilize our economy in this downturn. 
The Senate bill offers reasonable, sore-
ly needed solutions that will help fami-
lies. Yet, while the anxiety and frustra-
tion around this country rises, the 
other side is obstructing and delaying 
the relief that the American people 
need. 
Let’s look at what is happening here 
and on the other side of this building. 
The House Democrats ceased bipar-
tisan negotiations on COVID–19—the 
relief package that we have been work-
ing on—so that they could write their 
own bill. What are the provisions that 
Speaker PELOSI and the House Demo-
crats think are critical right now dur-
ing this crisis of unprecedented propor-
tion like we have never seen before? It 
is a wish list about which many of my 
colleagues have spoken. It is a wish list 
that has nothing to do with the crisis 
at hand—nothing to save lives and no 
serious, new effort to provide relief. 
Yesterday, I also spoke about the 
fact that, in our bill, we have relief for 
agriculture. It is the only effort to pro-
vide relief for agriculture producers, 
and it was facing a Democratic effort 
to be removed from the bill. I don’t 
often agree with the chair of the Ne-
braska Democratic Party, but she was 
right when she said recently, in an 
interview with The Hill, that the 
Democrats don’t have a plan for rural 
America. According to the article, she 
said that the Democrats only address 
rural voters directly—people in rural 
communities—when they show up in 
Iowa to campaign for votes. 
To the hard-working men and women 
of rural America, I say to you: Take 
note. Take note on who recognizes 
your vital role in our country and who 
is fighting for you. 
People are sick and people are 
scared. As of this morning, my home 
State of Nebraska now has 62 con-
firmed cases of COVID–19. Addressing 
these Democratic priorities will not 
help our healthcare workers, who are 
on the frontlines in this fight against 
this virus. It will not help our small 
businesses that might have to lay off 
people or shut their doors for good if 
they don’t get this assistance. It 
doesn’t help our ag producers in Ne-
braska and all across the heartland 
who are working tirelessly to feed the 
world during these tough times. 
I will say again what I said yester-
day: We don’t have a lot of time here. 
I urge all of my colleagues to work to-
gether and save the debate on a wish 
list for another day. Today, let’s give 
the American people what they need, 
and that is relief—relief for the fami-
lies who are at home, caring for their 
children, and doing everything they 
can to make ends meet; relief for our 
amazing healthcare workers and com-
munity hospitals that are combating 
this disease, caring for their patients 
and saving lives; relief for small Main 
Street 
businesses—the 
backbone 
of 
America—that make our communities 
vibrant and prosperous. Let’s give all 
of these great Americans the critical 
relief to help carry them through this 
crisis. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to work in a productive way 
to get this next phase of relief passed 
and send it to the President’s desk as 
soon as possible. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
TILLIS). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I ar-
rived in Washington in November of 
2001, after winning a special election to 
serve the people of the Third District 
of Arkansas in the House of Represent-
atives. This was shortly after 9/11. It 
was a very anxious time in the Capitol. 
Every one of my colleagues sought to 
find ways to work together to move 
major pieces of legislation that helped 
to return a sense of normalcy that 
Americans so desperately sought in the 
wake of the attacks. 
Given all that is at stake right now, 
for the life of me, I have not been able 
to understand why we have been strug-
gling to do the same now. Thankfully, 
the partisanship that has dominated 
these past few days has subsided. It ap-
pears that we can now move forward 
after this unnecessary delay. This is 
vital, as we simply can’t afford to wait. 
Many small businesses in Arkansas, 
large cities and small towns alike, are 
being forced to close during this crisis, 
both to protect the public health and 
to protect their families, and because 
of a shrinking customer base, as cus-
tomers are urged to stay home to re-
duce the spread of the disease. The un-
expected closure for small business 
owners, through no fault of their own, 
may prevent many of them from re-
opening by the time this is behind us. 
Those employed at these operations 
will be among the hardest hit finan-
cially by this crisis. 
Entire industries that are so vital to 
our Nation’s economic well-being have 
been crushed by the pandemic. The 
markets have taken a huge hit from 
the crisis, putting the retirement secu-
rity of millions of American in jeop-
ardy. And it certainly is expected that 
our healthcare sector, strained to ca-
pacity right now by the coronavirus 
pandemic, will face substantial chal-
lenges moving forward. 
Congress’s initial responses in the 
wake of the crisis were promising. We

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1990 
March 24, 2020 
came together to pass a comprehensive 
package to dramatically increase ef-
forts to prevent the spread of the dis-
ease, treat Americans diagnosed with 
COVID–19, and support research to find 
a vaccine. President Trump signed this 
bipartisan, bicameral emergency sup-
plemental appropriations package that 
provided a surge in funding throughout 
the government—almost $8 billion—to 
meet the growing challenge that we 
face. It promotes a government-wide 
approach, channeling the collective en-
ergy, knowledge, and talents of Fed-
eral, State, and local public health offi-
cials and healthcare professionals to 
mitigate the spread of the coronavirus 
and treat those who have been affected. 
After that, the House passed a bipar-
tisan relief bill, the Families First 
Coronavirus Response Act, which in-
cludes paid emergency leave for work-
ers, widespread coronavirus testing at 
no additional cost to patients, and en-
hanced food security initiatives. Last 
week my colleagues in this Chamber 
worked together to approve the Fami-
lies First Coronavirus Response Act 
and the President signed it into law. 
This was the first step in our efforts to 
provide economic relief. We called it 
phase 2. 
There are several aspects of that bill 
that the Senate would like to have 
changed, but for the sake of urgency 
and building bipartisan momentum, we 
passed the bill without a single amend-
ment. We put our differences aside and 
did what we believed was in the best in-
terest of the American people. 
Republicans and Democrats alike 
agree that much more is needed to be 
done to help individual Americans neg-
atively affected by this crisis and to 
stave off a massive economic disaster. 
That is what this bill does. 
Phase 1 provided immediate funding 
to address the public health crisis. 
Phase 
2, 
the 
Families 
First 
Coronavirus Response Act, marked the 
beginning of our efforts to address the 
coronavirus’s economic impact. It has 
a number of helpful provisions in it, 
but we have to build upon this effort 
and provide more relief to the Amer-
ican people in this time of crisis. 
That is phase 3, the Coronavirus Aid, 
Relief, and Economic Security Act, or 
the CARES Act, the bill we have been 
trying to move forward over the past 
several days. 
The CARES Act would send billions 
of dollars to hospital and healthcare 
providers, the men and women on the 
frontlines of this fight. It would send 
direct checks to millions of American 
households to offset the economic im-
pact of the crisis and allow for a much 
needed injection of liquidity into our 
economy. It would expand unemploy-
ment insurance while stabilizing indus-
tries to prevent mass layoffs, and it 
would provide dramatic relief to the 
lifeblood of our economy—our small 
businesses—which have taken a mas-
sive hit as a result of this unprece-
dented public health crisis. 
We have to create a path to economic 
recovery. We have told Americans they 
can’t go to work, and businesses are 
unable to operate. As a result of these 
measures, individuals are not getting a 
paycheck. We need to be helping them 
through this crisis by providing cash 
payouts, 
expanding 
unemployment 
benefits, and by ensuring that there 
will be jobs for Americans to return to 
when this is all over. 
This is not a stimulus plan. It is an 
existence plan. We have to pass this 
bill. Americans have lost faith in many 
of their institutions. This is a defining 
moment. We have a chance to restore 
some of the confidence that is being 
lost by putting the needs of the Nation 
over the wishes of the political class. 
Americans are looking toward Wash-
ington for leadership right now. This is 
a true test. 
Let’s pass this bill and show that we 
can rise up to the massive challenge 
before our Nation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, I ask unanimous consent 
that the order for the quorum call be 
rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
President, today I rise to speak about 
the fact that the past 2 weeks—espe-
cially the last 2 weeks—have been in-
credibly difficult times for South Caro-
linians and for Americans throughout 
the country. 
As we always do, our American fam-
ily has shown resilience, and so many 
are working to lift up those in need. I 
think about the folks who are going to 
drive-throughs and leaving tips. I have 
heard stories throughout South Caro-
lina—and I am sure it is true through-
out America—of folks paying for gro-
ceries for the single moms and for 
those in need behind them. I have 
heard of restaurants in South Carolina 
from the Halls food chain that are pro-
viding meals for single parents as well 
as for the homeless. There are so many 
positive stories coming out today and 
yesterday about the will of the Amer-
ican family to pull together during 
these incredibly unprecedented and 
challenging 
times. 
We 
have 
also 
learned a lot about social distancing 
and how to keep our restaurants open 
when folks are not allowed to go in. 
Schools have had to close down and 
shift to online-only learning environ-
ments, taxing both parents, as I under-
stand, and teachers. 
Many workers have been furloughed 
or laid off. I am sure it is true in North 
Carolina, but it is certainly true in 
South Carolina that so many of our 
restaurant owners—I have been on the 
calls with hundreds of them talking 
about shuttering their entire oper-
ations. Last Thursday and Friday, I 
saw that one restaurant with several 
different locations—I think 6 loca-
tions—laid off 900 employees, all going 
to the unemployment line. Another 
small restaurant chain with 6 or 7 loca-
tions laid off another 1,000 employees. 
In Myrtle Beach, SC, one of the meccas 
of tourism in the Nation, restaurant 
after restaurant, hotel after hotel is 
laying off parts of their family. Work-
ers who have become family members 
over a decade or two of working at the 
same place and serving amazing people 
are today without work, today without 
the paycheck that gives them the glue 
to not only keep their families to-
gether but to keep their finances to-
gether. 
Small businesses are scrambling. I 
have run three different small busi-
nesses. I know the pain of not signing 
the front of the paycheck for yourself, 
not being able to sign the back of that 
same paycheck for yourself because 
you are willing to do whatever it takes 
to make sure your employees get to 
cash their paychecks. I understand the 
turmoil in the heart of the employee 
and the employer who simply don’t 
have the resources they had just a cou-
ple of weeks ago. Even worse, because 
they did nothing wrong, they find 
themselves completely and totally ex-
asperated, unable to comprehend and 
understand how outside of their own 
control, they no longer have the re-
sources necessary to take care of their 
own family. 
We find ourselves in unprecedented 
times, but in these times, I am re-
minded of the entire group of heroes 
who show up every single day, and 
typically we are only talking about the 
law enforcement community and first 
responders, but today we have to add to 
the list of American heroes those folks 
who are clerks in grocery stores, filling 
the shelves over and over again. We 
have to add to that list those folks who 
are helping in the takeout delivery so 
folks can have hot meals when they go 
home. We undoubtedly keep in mind 
the 
true 
American 
heroes—our 
healthcare workers, the doctors and 
nurses and, as my mother has been for 
45 years, nurse’s assistants, showing up 
in hospital environments, putting their 
lives on the line for fellow Americans, 
folks they don’t even know. They do so 
not just because it is their job, not just 
their duty, but it is their calling and 
their mission. 
We are blessed to live in a nation 
where everyday people understand that 
which it seems we do not in this Cham-
ber. That is what makes the last 3 days 
so incredibly frustrating. 
On Saturday, it looked like this was 
all about over. We were so close to a 
deal—so close that Senator SCHUMER 
himself said on TV that he was very 
pleased with the negotiations, and he 
spoke about how bipartisan the nego-
tiations were. And then the Speaker of 
the House returned to town, and the 
tide of bipartisanship seemed to be 
coming to an end. 
We were making real progress, and 
the bill text was even released, and 
then, for absolutely no reason, the 
Speaker’s passion for partisan hogwash

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1991 
March 24, 2020 
started causing the type of delay that 
doesn’t simply cripple our economy but 
imperils our healthcare response to the 
people 
who 
are 
infected 
by 
the 
coronavirus. It impairs our response to 
the healthcare workers who are pro-
viding the response. It compromises 
our ability to respond with the PPE or, 
said differently, the material, equip-
ment, and the uniforms necessary to 
protect the healthcare workers. 
I honestly cannot believe we are still 
here not having already passed legisla-
tion that would make such a big dif-
ference in the lives of so many. In-
stead, we have to waste time explain-
ing to the Speaker and to some of our 
friends on the other side that airline 
fuel emissions is not important in this 
legislation. We can debate that at an-
other time. If you want the airline in-
dustry to be carbon neutral by 2025, 
let’s have that debate, but let’s not 
have it when people are desperately 
searching for help. We may even debate 
the importance of same-day registra-
tion and early voting, but let’s not 
hold up $1 trillion-plus from the hands 
of the people who can’t take care of 
their families because of a strong de-
sire to use this crisis to achieve par-
tisan ends. 
We all should be interested in diver-
sity, but let’s not hold up assistance to 
families because some folks, like the 
Speaker, want to use this legislation as 
a way to bring diversity to boards. This 
is not a place for this debate. This con-
versation should be a conversation 
about our healthcare workers, about 
those infected and those impacted, not 
about partisan political gains. 
Imagine that—wasting time on 1,119 
pages of the Speaker’s political hier-
archy. 
Thankfully, the American people are 
smarter and more resilient than those 
folks in Congress. The American people 
may be concerned, and they may feel 
the sense of uncertainty about how 
long—weeks or months—that this will 
play out, but they know what we need: 
Immediate help for workers, for small 
businesses, and for healthcare profes-
sionals. 
That is why, in this legislation, we 
fund hospitals. More than $70 billion 
for hospitals are being held up right 
now. More than $20 billion for veterans 
are held up right now. Tens of billions 
of dollars for vaccines, billions of dol-
lars for the CDC, billions of dollars for 
FEMA, billions of dollars in block 
grants for the States, and tens of bil-
lions of dollars of emergency assist-
ance for public transportation so you 
can get there are held up. 
What are they blocking? Well, they 
are blocking hundreds of billions of 
dollars in unemployment relief. Let me 
say it differently. In South Carolina, 
the average maximum benefit for un-
employment is $326 a week. If you are 
making 30 bucks an hour or $60,000 a 
year—$5,000 a month, $1,250 a week— 
the maximum benefit currently is $326 
in South Carolina. It is $327 in Ten-
nessee. In our legislation, no less than 
an additional $600 would flow to the un-
employed. It is not just the traditional 
unemployed, as we have always defined 
it, but we have expanded the definition 
of unemployment, who would be eligi-
ble, to include the 1099 or the person 
working for themselves because we 
want to make sure that the average 
person in this Nation, who is taking 
the risk and taking the chance to do 
something 
that 
they 
have 
always 
dreamed of doing, and they are work-
ing for themselves—that if this crisis 
has caused you to lose your paycheck 
and you are self-employed, we, in a bi-
partisan fashion, wove together legisla-
tion that takes you into consideration. 
So instead of giving the $326 in South 
Carolina or the $327 in Tennessee, you 
receive more than an additional $600 on 
top of that because we know the crisis 
that you are in is not of your own mak-
ing. 
We provide direct payments in this 
bill. It is very controversial and very 
debatable, but here it is, a minimum of 
up to $75,000 in individual income, 
$150,000 in household income. With two 
parents working, 75,000 and 75,000, you 
can get up to $1,200 per working adult 
and $500 for the children. That is $3,000 
almost held up in a partisan debate. 
As a small business owner, knowing 
how hard it is to keep employees when 
business is ripped out of your hand and 
you did nothing wrong, this legislation 
provides loans to keep your employees 
on the payroll if that is something that 
makes sense. If you use the funds that 
you borrow to keep your employees on 
the payroll, it becomes more of a grant 
than a loan. That is a good thing be-
cause it is far cheaper for your em-
ployer to keep you on the payroll than 
it is to gamble on the unemployment 
insurance line. 
So I am thankful to the American 
people. I am thankful to the American 
people because they have provided us 
everything. They have provided us ex-
amples of hope, reasons to be opti-
mistic, the picture of strength and te-
nacity and toughness, and, most impor-
tantly, in the midst of a crisis, they 
have provided us a picture of unity— 
people helping people. That is the part 
of the story that we haven’t heard a lot 
about—people helping people. 
So, as this charade finally comes to a 
close, hopefully, by the time we go to 
sleep tonight, I want to tell my folks 
back home in South Carolina and the 
doctors 
in 
Washington 
State, 
the 
nurses in New York City, and the res-
taurant owner in Myrtle Beach one 
thing: Thank you. Thank you for show-
ing us all what it means to be an Amer-
ican, especially during unprecedented 
times. Thank you for reminding those 
blinded by politics in Washington what 
the actual goal really is. 
I know America will not simply sur-
vive. America will, in fact, thrive in 
the aftermath of this crisis. I know it 
because I know many, many Ameri-
cans, and that is what we do. God has 
blessed the United States of America. 
Let us be a blessing to each other and 
get this done. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, our 
economy is in a free fall. I just got off 
the phone with another business in 
Ohio that was worried about whether 
they can survive, whether or not they 
can keep the workers they have, and 
looking to us to try to pass something 
that would actually help. 
The bill before us does that. Yet here 
we are. Another day has gone by. More 
people have lost their jobs. More small 
businesses 
have 
shuttered. 
The 
healthcare 
crisis 
continues. 
The 
coronavirus is spreading, and we are 
not passing legislation that addresses 
all of those issues. 
I ask my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle to work with us. Let’s come 
up with a bill here today. 
The bill was the result of a bipartisan 
process. I was part of it. So I can tell 
you that. There were four different 
task forces that were asked to deal 
with four different parts of the re-
sponse to the coronavirus. Each one 
was bipartisan. In our case, there were 
two Republicans and two Democrats. 
The administration was involved. We 
made 
concessions. 
The 
Democrats 
made concessions. The legislation rep-
resented that. There were ideas from 
both sides. 
Yet here we are, 48 hours after the 
bill was introduced. We had hoped to 
have the bill signed into law by the 
President on Monday. I had businesses 
calling me yesterday saying: I am hold-
ing on because I was told this was 
going to be done by Monday. 
My hope is that those meetings that 
are happening behind those closed 
doors over there result in something 
quickly and that Democrats don’t keep 
trying to add more things to this bill 
that are extraneous and that don’t 
have to do with the coronavirus. 
This is not the time to try to get 
whatever your wish list is on a piece of 
legislation that is moving. These are 
not normal times here, where Members 
try to take advantage of the bill going 
through by adding something to it. It 
is also not a time to say: Let’s spend 
more and more and more on every-
thing. 
This is unprecedented. The total 
spending in this bill will be about $1.5 
trillion. That is roughly the size of the 
entire appropriations that Congress 
normally makes. The entire appropria-
tions that come through the process 
here, called discretionary spending, is 
the amount of just one coronavirus 
emergency bill. 
To me, it is a rescue package. It is a 
rescue package that does three things. 
No. 1, it tries to keep the doors open in 
those small businesses that are watch-
ing us so carefully right now to see

March 24, 2020 
what is going to happen. Also, as part 
of keeping the doors open, it means 
that you can keep your employees. 
So goal one is to keep employees at-
tached to businesses. We should all 
want that. That is where most people 
get their healthcare and get their re-
tirement. That is where we want em-
ployees to be as we get over the hump 
here and begin to control this virus. 
Then we want to go back to work. We 
want to get the economy moving again 
so people can have paychecks and our 
economy can grow again. 
No. 2, we do want to take care of 
those people who, through no fault of 
their own, have found themselves out 
of work. Sadly, in my home State of 
Ohio and around the country, there are 
a lot of people in that category. 
Our unemployment insurance system 
is overwhelmed right now. This past 
week, compared to a week ago, we had 
a twentyfold increase. That is a 2,000- 
percent increase in the number of peo-
ple who were applying for unemploy-
ment insurance. Our claims have sky-
rocketed. It has overwhelmed the sys-
tem. That is happening all over the 
country. We want to take care of those 
people. 
And, No. 3, this legislation does what 
is perhaps the most important thing, 
which is that it addresses the problems 
in our public healthcare system that 
have resulted in this response to 
coronavirus not being as strong as we 
would like it. Think about more masks 
and more gowns and protective equip-
ment. Think about the anti-viral medi-
cation people can take—like for the 
flu, you can take Tamiflu. We need the 
anti-viral there to give people some 
comfort. 
Think about the fact that we don’t 
have enough tests out there, still. Yes, 
it has improved, and it is improving 
every day, but we don’t have enough 
tests. People who are asymptomatic 
ought to be able to get tests. If they 
are positive, then we ought to be able 
to trace it. That is what they did in 
South Korea. That is what they did in 
Japan. That is what they have done in 
other countries to try to get control of 
this. So that is all in this legislation. 
Until we solve the healthcare part of 
it—that last part, that third part—we 
are going to continue to have problems 
in terms of the economic free fall. We 
can’t spend enough money to stop what 
is happening in terms of this economic 
issue 
unless 
we 
deal 
with 
the 
healthcare part of this. 
I think we are starting to make 
progress. But do you know what? We 
need the funding now so that the Cen-
ters for Disease Control, so that the 
States, so that the State departments 
of public health, and so that the coun-
ty departments of public health can get 
to the point where they know who has 
this, they can trace it, and they can 
tell us with certainty whether we are 
making progress or not. 
One thing this bill will let us do is to 
develop those metrics so that you and 
I and everybody every day can see what 
the status is and how many new cases 
have been open that day. If we have 
this information from better testing, 
from better information flow, from the 
funding that is in this bill, including 
billions of dollars going to the Centers 
for Disease Control and back to the 
States, then we will be able to have 
some way to measure our success and 
eventually be able to say we are mak-
ing progress and we have actually re-
versed the trend. 
Only then will moms and dads feel 
safe having their kids go back to 
school. Only then will workers feel like 
it is safe to go back to work. Only then 
will restaurants be able to reopen and 
have people coming in to take advan-
tage of that hospitality. Only then will 
the theaters be able to open up and the 
bowling alleys. This is in this legisla-
tion also, in the first two we talked 
about, helping to keep employees at 
work and keeping the doors open for 
small businesses. 
Please, let’s pass this right away, be-
cause there are doors closing as we 
talk. Every minute we are here arguing 
over stuff, some of which has nothing 
to do with the coronavirus, means an-
other business is shut down and an-
other group of employees is let go. 
This legislation says, if you are a 
small business, you can get a loan from 
your bank to keep the doors open. And 
the loan effectively converts to a 
grant, meaning that you don’t have to 
pay it back if you use the loan to make 
your payroll, to keep people, to pay 
your rent, or to pay your mortgage. 
This is new. It is innovative. It is 
something that small businesses are 
excited about, but we have to pass the 
legislation to make it happen. This is 
$350 billion. And, again, there is total 
forgiveness of that loan if you use it 
for these purposes to keep your em-
ployees. 
Please, let’s get this passed right 
away. It is going to take a little while 
for these programs to get in place. 
That is all the more reason for us not 
to wait another day or even another 
hour. 
Second, for larger businesses, there is 
this new fund called the Exchange Sta-
bilization Fund. That is to help compa-
nies that can’t get a loan from a bank, 
to be able to get help from the Treas-
ury and the Fed to provide money for 
liquidity so they can stay in business. 
They may have little or no cash flow, 
but they are looking for a loan to be 
able to stay afloat. These loans don’t 
have to be paid back. Should there be 
accountability for these loans? Of 
course. Republicans are for account-
ability. That is fine. But let’s get mov-
ing on this. 
It is under this provision that there 
will be special help for certain indus-
tries: the national security industry 
and the airlines. Republicans are for 
that, but let’s make sure that this is 
not a giveaway and make sure there is 
an opportunity for the shareholders, 
who are the taxpayers of our country, 
to be able to get their money back, just 
like shareholders would want to in an-
other business kind of commercial 
loan. That is all we are asking for. 
The final thing is that, under this 
legislation, there is significant help for 
these companies to be able to keep 
their doors open—small, medium, and 
large—through some tax incentives 
that provide more liquidity during this 
year, 2020. 
One of the important points there is 
that if you do have payroll—and most 
of these companies still do—you don’t 
have to pay your payroll taxes during 
2020. So you defer your payroll taxes 
until next year or the year after. 
Companies care a lot about that. 
They tell me that is very important to 
them. That lowers their expenses, lets 
them keep people, and lets them stay 
in business. Yet they have to pay them 
back over time. So for the taxpayers, it 
is a good deal. 
There is also an opportunity here to 
help people directly. That is in this leg-
islation. That is the second goal. The 
first goal is to keep the doors open and 
keep the employees at work. The sec-
ond goal is to help people who, through 
no fault of their own, find themselves 
unemployed, some for the first time in 
their lives. 
I have friends at home I know who 
have been let go. They work in the re-
tail business or in the hospitality busi-
ness. There is just no business. They 
have never been to an unemployment 
insurance office. They never had to. 
Now they have to. 
So, yes, this legislation does include 
a little help for them in two ways. One, 
unemployment insurance is bumped up 
from the Federal Government. So 
every State in the country is going to 
have the ability to be sure that people 
who come and want to get on unem-
ployment have the ability—maybe not 
to match their salary entirely, not 
total wage replacement, but for low-in-
come workers, yes. And for others 
there will be at least enough money to 
be able to put food on the table, maybe 
to pay the rent, and maybe to make 
the car payment during this period. 
It is a short-term proposal. It is 3 
months, but it is really important. It is 
a safety net, the unemployment insur-
ance. 
And then, second, there is a direct 
payment. Perhaps you have heard 
about that. I think it is $1,200 per per-
son, $2,400 for a joint filer or for a cou-
ple, and then $500 per child. Why is that 
important? Because people need some 
cash right now. 
Some people are not going to be able 
to get on the unemployment insurance 
system for a while because it takes a 
little while to process that. But they 
will have the ability, because the IRS 
will be sending these checks out quick-
ly, to be able to have a little help, a lit-
tle cushion. 
So this bill has all of that. This bill 
is there to help people. This bill is 
there to ensure that doors can stay 
open in these businesses and people can 
stay employed, to the extent possible. 
Let’s not block it anymore.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1993 
March 24, 2020 
People said: Well, there is not enough 
money in here. That is really what 
Democrats wanted, to put more money 
in the bill. There is already $75 billion 
straight to hospitals, and then I would 
argue at least another $40 billion going 
to hospitals directly or indirectly 
through Medicare reimbursements and 
through other changes in the law that 
help. That used to be a lot of money 
around here. 
My point is, if that is not enough, in 
a few weeks Congress will be back. We 
can look at this. We will need to fine- 
tune this. But don’t block the bill 
today because it is not enough money 
for whatever you think your needs are. 
We don’t know what the needs are. 
Let’s be honest. What we do know is 
this is an unprecedented amount of 
money. Congress has never passed a 
rescue package like this before—$1.5 
trillion, on top of about $200 billion 
that was in the legislation that passed 
only a couple of weeks ago, on top of 
the $8.3 billion that was in the first 
one. This is phase 3. 
Then, finally, No. 3, this legislation 
does provide the help to the healthcare 
system, 
particularly 
the 
public 
healthcare system, to be able to pro-
vide the protective gear that is needed 
for our healthcare workers, the addi-
tional ventilators and respirators that 
are 
needed 
in 
our 
hospitals, 
the 
antiviral medication that can help 
when someone tests positive to know 
there is going to be a way to minimize, 
to reduce the effects of this virus and 
the infection. 
Then, really significantly, to not 
only increase the testing—and, today, 
LabCorp and Quest said that they can 
now do 300,000 tests a week. We need to 
use the cotton swabs. We need to get 
them the swabs. There needs to be a 
process there to get them, but now we 
are finally starting to come online. 
This legislation provides funding to 
help move that more quickly, to get it 
going so that we can have the informa-
tion to be able to measure whether we 
are succeeding or not; then, as we 
begin to measure our success, to be 
able to get people back to work, to be 
able to get the economy back on track, 
to be able to ensure people are out 
there again shopping. The consumer 
economy is so important. 
This can all happen, but this legisla-
tion is critical to making it happen, to 
providing the rescue to help people 
weather the storm and to ensure that, 
at the other end of this, we come out 
strong. And we will. We will. But it re-
quires us working together today, right 
now, to come out from behind these 
doors, stop the negotiating to add more 
here and there, and just say this is a bi-
partisan product. Nothing is perfect 
around here, but if you make perfect 
the enemy of the good, you are going 
to hurt more people. More small busi-
nesses will shut; more people will be 
out on their own; and there will be 
more and more people who will be in-
fected with this virus who otherwise 
could have been saved. 
So I ask my colleagues—it has al-
ready been too long—let’s pass this leg-
islation today. Let’s begin the rescue 
package and begin to help the constitu-
ents who deserve it. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
CAPITO). The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 8 
days ago we started the process of try-
ing to pull together this economic 
bill—8 days ago. We have been in con-
tinuous session every day since then. 
It was our belief that we would vote 
on this bill 2 days ago, on Sunday. The 
negotiations have gone on for this en-
tire 8-day time period. Republicans and 
Democrats have been meeting together 
every day, working through the proc-
ess—Republican chairmen, Democratic 
ranking members, sharing ideas. 
Eight days ago, Senator SCHUMER 
presented a list 10 pages long of ideas 
and priorities that the Democrats 
wanted to include in the economic re-
lief package. Multiple of those areas 
are included in this final package, in 
this compiled package that had all 
come together and was all headed to-
ward trying to vote on it on Sunday. 
Then Sunday happened, and it was: 
We are close. That wasn’t the answer 
of, We are voting on it. It was suddenly 
the negotiations are ‘‘We are close,’’ 
and a whole new set of priorities sud-
denly appeared from our Democratic 
colleagues to say, well, we have a few 
more things that we want to do and a 
few more things that we want to evalu-
ate. ‘‘We are close’’ is all we heard. 
We thought we were done. For the 
sake of the American people, we need 
to be done. We have folks at home 
across the entire country who are try-
ing to figure out if they can get a loan, 
if they can keep their business going, if 
they can keep their employees. They 
have no income coming, and all that is 
coming out of this body is: We are 
close. We have a few more things we 
want to discuss. 
Here is a sample of the calls that I 
got yesterday: A lady from Southwest 
Oklahoma called, literally in tears, 
saying she has a small business, and 
there is little to no business going on 
right now, with no cashflow, and she 
doesn’t know about she and her hus-
band’s retirement and she doesn’t 
know why the bill didn’t pass yester-
day. 
All we could say to her was we don’t 
know either because it was suddenly a 
new set of issues. It seemed to be all 
day long Sunday, Monday, and now we 
are deep into Tuesday, and we still 
can’t get a set of answers. 
Painfully enough, I caught one of my 
Senate colleagues on the Democratic 
side and just asked: What is the prob-
lem? What is the holdup? Their answer 
was: We are compiling our list from ev-
eryone right now to try to get down to 
what our priorities are. 
This was yesterday, Monday. We 
thought we would be done on Sunday. 
All I could say back to them was: You 
are compiling your list? You still don’t 
even know what all you want to be able 
to include in this bill, and we are just 
stalling and waiting until we can figure 
out what to do? 
We have been done, and now we are 
stuck waiting for the other side to say: 
I am thinking of a few more things we 
want to include. 
I had a lady from Southern Okla-
homa call me because the daycare cen-
ter where her daughter works has 
closed down. She doesn’t know what is 
going to happen and wanted to know— 
she has heard about this possibility of 
a check being sent out to every Amer-
ican—that would sure be helpful right 
now—and wanted to know when that 
was coming. 
All I could say was: I don’t know. We 
are waiting on our Democratic col-
leagues to finish compiling their list of 
the other things they want to add into 
this bill so we can even discuss it. All 
I can say is: I keep hearing we are at 
the 2-yard line or we are this close. 
But we never seem to get past the 2- 
yard line. It is always: We are close. 
Folks at home don’t need ‘‘We are 
close.’’ They need this done. 
So let me just say, really quickly, 
what is in this bill and why it is so im-
portant to us: 
Additional money for testing, addi-
tional money for work on vaccines, ad-
ditional money on trying to be able to 
go through treatments, ventilators, lit-
erally billions of dollars that go to hos-
pitals and clinics and nursing homes 
and senior centers. 
One section of the bill has $75 billion 
and another section of the bill has $40 
billion—just 
for 
hospitals 
and 
for 
healthcare. 
The hospitals are all telling us the 
same thing: We need help, and we need 
help right now. And I would say back 
to them: Would love to, except we seem 
to be parked on the 2-yard line while 
other folks are saying: We are close. 
We are still thinking of a few other 
things we want to get in. 
There is an immediate check that is 
to go out to every American to provide 
some support for utilities and the basic 
things because so many people are un-
employed. To those folks who are call-
ing us saying: When are they coming, 
all I can say is I don’t know. All I hear 
is that we are close because the other 
side wants to include a few more things 
they are thinking about on their list. 
Already in the bill is $250 billion for 
unemployment insurance, with an in-
crease on the amount that would come 
on each check. We would love to get 
that started, except we are on the 2- 
yard line, and we can’t seem to get 
past that because the other side is still 
making a list of the other things they 
want to include in the bill. 
So we can’t get help to hospitals. We 
can’t get immediate support checks 
out the door. We can’t get additional 
unemployment 
insurance 
going 
be-
cause they are thinking about a few 
other things they want to add into the 
bill. 
Already in the bill is help for small 
businesses: helping people retain their

full salary if they work at a small busi-
ness—that is, a business of 500 or less— 
so that they can stay connected to 
their employer so that, when we get 
through this virus, they actually have 
a job, and they can continue their same 
salary. That is an immediate offer. 
It is not like the one that passed last 
week that is small businesses are ex-
pected to pay for the coverage out of 
money they don’t have, and someday 
the Federal Government will figure out 
a process to reimburse them. This is 
totally different. This is an immediate, 
upfront infusion into small businesses, 
and they don’t have to come up with 
the cash. It is come up with for them, 
for them to be able to cover their em-
ployees. 
That helps their employees from 
going into unemployment insurance, 
and it helps this economy recover a lot 
faster because they are able to come 
right back to it. 
I would love to tell them: Go to your 
bank right now; that loan is ready—ex-
cept I can’t because the other side is 
still thinking about a few more things 
they want to add into this bill. 
And while small businesses can’t 
make it through the week because of 
their cashflow because they have been 
forcibly closed, the other side is think-
ing about a few more things they want 
to add in. 
There is help in this for nonprofits 
that are doing amazing work all over 
my State—and they probably are in 
States all over the country right now. 
Nonprofits out there that I have talked 
to recently—homeless shelters, but 
they are at max capacity right now. 
They are actually not allowing addi-
tional residents in some of the facili-
ties there. 
The YMCA and YWCA, they are feed-
ing youth in the community. The 
schools are stepping up, doing remark-
able work feeding folks. The free com-
munity clinic has had to close in some 
of my communities just because of 
COVID–19, so they are trying to find 
ways to help out in other ways. 
The Hope Center that is in Woodward 
is doing a drive-through food distribu-
tion right now instead of having people 
come in. So they are getting food to 
them. 
We have got some of the Youth & 
Family Services’ facilities that are 
doing amazing work right now, but 
they cannot make payroll right now. 
They are needing some help. Well— 
guess what—there is help in this bill 
for those nonprofits to keep their pay-
roll going and to be able to keep going 
because we desperately need those non-
profits to still be able to provide that 
help in those communities. 
I would love to tell those nonprofits 
help is on the way, but all I can tell 
them is we are on the 2-yard line wait-
ing for the other side to determine a 
few more things that they still want to 
put into the bill. So it is ready— 
maybe. 
A lot of large businesses that employ 
a lot of people in my State are not ask-
ing for grants, though they would love 
to get those, obviously. They are ask-
ing for capital. They are asking for ac-
cess to loans. They are asking for the 
opportunity to take out a loan and to 
be able to make a payment. That is in 
this bill. There is not a bailout for big 
companies in this bill. 
This bill provides an opportunity for 
medium and large companies to get ac-
cess to credit so they can get a loan to 
carry their company through. I would 
love to tell them: You can go take out 
that loan. But I can’t because the other 
side is still thinking about a few other 
things that they want to do. 
We are waiting. Time is important 
right now. 
While one of my colleagues made a 
public statement yesterday saying: 
This is a $2 trillion bill; we should real-
ly get it right—oh, I agree, but this 
doesn’t seem to be a matter of making 
sure the text is correct. All that I have 
heard for the last 48 hours is: There are 
a few more things we are thinking 
about that we want to be able to get 
into the bill. 
Yesterday it was solar energy panels 
and solar credits, which I don’t know 
how it connects with COVID–19. It was 
forcing airlines to be carbon neutral by 
2025. It was union representatives on 
corporate boards. It was limiting the 
ability of corporations to have any 
kind of access to doing stock buybacks 
for the next 10 years. 
All those things may be fine to de-
bate. Why in the world are we holding 
up small businesses and holding up 
checks to individuals and cutting off 
support for nonprofits because we are 
thinking about a few things like solar 
panels and carbon-neutral footprints 
for airlines? 
Why don’t we get this done? Time is 
important. People at home who have 
real lives and real families and a small 
business have no income coming in 
right now. They have no cash flow, and 
they are trying to pay their employees 
and figure out what is going to happen 
next, while the other side is thinking 
about something else they might want 
to add to this bill. 
I am fine with thinking through the 
details, but in our office, it is really 
difficult to continue to answer the 
phone and hear people say: I don’t 
know how we will stay open any 
longer. 
I will tell you what—why don’t you 
answer this call for me while you are 
thinking about what else you might 
want to add to the bill? A hotel owner 
in my State just closed their doors 
while you are thinking about what you 
want to do next. 
I am asking the other side. The bill 
already has these elements in it, and 
while I am confident people will step 
out of negotiations at some point and 
say ‘‘We miraculously saved the bill be-
cause we changed five lines in it and 
because we added additional dollars 
into this account’’ or ‘‘This account 
was too low, so now we didn’t give $75 
billion to hospitals; we gave $100 billion 
to hospitals. So, look, we fixed it. And 
we didn’t give $10 billion to cities; we 
gave $15 billion to cities, and so we 
saved it’’—well, while you are arguing 
about adding a few more dollars at the 
end of these different things, in the 
meantime, small businesses and people 
across the country are saying ‘‘Can I 
get the first dollar while you are argu-
ing about the fifteen-billionth dollar? 
Can I get some help now?’’ Time is im-
portant. Let’s stop pretending it is not. 
It may not be to some folks in this 
room; it is to the 4 million folks in my 
State. 
We were ready on Sunday with this 
bill and thought we were voting on it 
to finish it. Now, 48 hours later, the 
other side is still thinking about some-
thing they might want to add to this. 
Let’s vote. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arizona. 
Ms. MCSALLY. Madam President, we 
are at war. Unlike the enemies I fought 
against in uniform, this enemy is invis-
ible, but it is just as deadly. Earlier 
today, the World Health Organization 
cautioned that the United States could 
be 
the 
next 
epicenter 
of 
this 
coronavirus pandemic. The Surgeon 
General sounded the alarm that things 
would get drastically worse this week. 
Economists are warning of a prolonged 
economic downturn that will devastate 
the country financially in ways unseen 
since the Great Depression. 
As of right now, more than 600 Amer-
icans have died from the coronavirus. 
In Arizona, our Governor announced 
this morning that the death toll from 
the outbreak is up to five. In the past 
4 days, we have seen more than a 200- 
percent increase in the number of cases 
in my State. It is going to go up. These 
aren’t just numbers; they are people. 
Our hearts and our prayers are with 
the grieving families who lost their 
loved ones and those fighting for their 
lives right now. 
The Nation has embarked on a mas-
sive effort to flatten the curve of the 
coronavirus to protect the vulnerable, 
buy time, and ensure our healthcare 
system doesn’t get overwhelmed. These 
aggressive steps will save lives, but 
this path creates another calamity of 
massive economic hardship unlike any-
thing we have experienced. We are tell-
ing people to stay home and not work. 
The financial devastation is wide and 
deep. 
Arizonans are stepping up to do their 
part to save the vulnerable. Working 
people deserve relief, and their needs 
are urgent. 
I was home in Arizona a week ago 
Sunday and saw a neighbor, a single 
mom with three kids. She owns a food 
truck. She told me that her income 
just went to zero, with all events can-
celed. ‘‘What am I supposed to do?’’ she 
asked me, with her son by her side at 
the grocery store. I told her I was head-
ing back to DC to pass legislation to 
get her cash fast for her rent and food, 
plus additional support for her small

business. She was scared. I can’t imag-
ine the fear that must be gripping all 
Arizona parents just like her who must 
provide for their families in the face of 
this open-ended economic lockdown. 
That same day, I ordered takeout at 
my favorite local restaurant. There 
was hardly anyone there when it is 
usually packed, and this was before the 
Governor’s order to shut down eating 
in dining rooms. This is a family- 
owned, small restaurant where they 
poured their savings, their hearts, and 
their lives into building this local suc-
cess story. I asked how they were cop-
ing, and they said they were deeply 
concerned. ‘‘What are we supposed to 
do?’’ they asked. I told them to hang in 
there and that relief was on the way. 
More fear in the eyes of people whose 
only sin is to have worked hard and 
played by the rules in pursuit of their 
American dream. 
On Monday morning, I walked to the 
gate in the airport terminal where I 
usually hug a woman who shines shoes. 
We kept our distance, but I asked how 
the virus impacted her. She said that 
she had only one client that day and 
that things were grinding to a halt. 
‘‘What am I supposed to do?’’ I heard 
again. I took her phone number, and I 
told her relief was on the way soon. 
This morning, she is waking up to no 
relief bill and a news story that air-
lines have plans to shut down alto-
gether. It is a nightmare with no end in 
sight for so many like her. 
On the plane back to Washington, 
DC, I texted the woman who grooms 
my dog Boomer to ask how the virus 
was impacting her business. She told 
me that it was slowing down but that 
she wasn’t feeling well. I urged her to 
go home immediately and stay away 
from people. She said she couldn’t be-
cause she had to pay her bills. What is 
she supposed to do? I pleaded with her 
on text to go home and said relief was 
on the way soon. 
Later that day, I heard from a doctor 
who asked me to send a message of en-
couragement to the healthcare workers 
serving on the frontlines of the VA. 
‘‘We’re gonna need it,’’ he texted. ‘‘It’s 
coming.’’ He shared with me their con-
cerns about their patients and families. 
‘‘We want to do the best we can against 
an unknown enemy in darkness,’’ he 
said. He went on to share that he was 
most impressed by the nurses and the 
support staff, like the housekeepers 
who do their jobs in a petri dish, still 
smiling but terrified inside. I put a 
short video together to thank these he-
roes, and I told him that relief was on 
the way soon. 
Over the past 8 days, I have heard 
countless stories similar to these from 
Arizonans across the State. The situa-
tion is dire, and it is urgent. These are 
real people who are suffering real harm 
from this pandemic. Relief must be de-
livered posthaste, bold and swift. 
Time and again, every Senator in 
this Chamber has promised a con-
stituent that relief is on the way soon, 
but the actions by some Members in 
this Chamber have resulted in broken 
promises to the American people. By 
blocking advancement of this urgent 
relief package that was drafted by Sen-
ators of both parties, Democratic lead-
ership has ushered in one of the saddest 
chapters in American history. 
Although I have only been in the 
Senate for a little over a year, I can 
say it has lived up so far to its reputa-
tion as a place where nothing happens 
fast, but with a sense of urgency, Re-
publicans and Democrats came to-
gether and have been working around 
the clock to build this comprehensive 
relief package. We worked on this with 
the goal of keeping employees con-
nected to employers to the max extent 
possible, and we strengthened unem-
ployment benefits for those laid off. 
Working Arizonans need cash now to 
pay rent and buy food. Small busi-
nesses need to be rescued from closing 
forever. Our economy needs to be 
stopped from collapsing. Our hospitals 
need resources now to meet the coming 
tsunami. 
If passed on Sunday, this package 
would send $3,400 in cash to every fam-
ily of four in Arizona making $150,000 a 
year or less. It would give small busi-
nesses money they don’t have to pay 
back to keep their employees on the 
payroll and pay other overhead costs 
like rent. Those businesses are in dan-
ger of closing down in the next week or 
so, and they won’t be around to provide 
jobs when the virus is defeated. We 
must urgently—urgently—act to keep 
them afloat. 
The legislation also allows larger em-
ployers that provide jobs for people in 
each of our States to take out loans to 
keep people on the payroll as their rev-
enues plummet. Take PetSmart and 
Best 
Western 
Hotels, 
both 
headquartered in Arizona—these busi-
nesses and others like them provide 
jobs for our neighbors, and those are at 
risk too. 
For our frontline warriors in this 
pandemic fight, our initial bipartisan 
framework provides $75 billion to hos-
pitals, more than $1 billion to the In-
dian Health Service, $20 billion for vet-
erans’ health services, $11 billion to de-
velop treatments and vaccines, and $1.7 
billion 
for 
the 
Strategic 
National 
Stockpile for essential equipment like 
masks, test kits, and ventilators. 
If you want to plus it up, we could 
have done it Sunday afternoon. We 
could have had that conversation and 
swiftly passed this bill. 
We also significantly increased un-
employment benefits. Currently in Ari-
zona, unemployment is $250 a week. We 
increased that to $850, while expanding 
eligibility for those who are self-em-
ployed, independent contractors, part- 
time workers, and gig economy work-
ers, like Uber and Lyft drivers. 
All of that—that is what the Demo-
crats blocked on Sunday and then 
again on Monday. And for what? So 
they could throw money at liberal pet 
projects that have absolutely nothing 
to do with treating the health and eco-
nomic fallouts of the coronavirus— 
nothing whatsoever. 
Relief was on the way. It was all but 
a done deal. And then NANCY PELOSI 
landed in DC, and she and CHUCK SCHU-
MER decided to blow it all up for their 
unrelated, ideological wish list. People 
are dying, people are running out of 
money, and they are looking for us to 
provide strong relief now, but that 
doesn’t seem to matter to them. We 
said relief was on the way, and now it 
isn’t. 
I was presiding over this Chamber on 
Sunday night after the first failed vote 
when CHUCK SCHUMER waltzed in that 
door and objected to opening up the 
Senate early on Monday, instead forc-
ing us to wait until noon. He gave a 
theatrical speech from over there, 
filled with flat-out lies, saying that we 
had set ‘‘an artificial deadline’’ to pass 
this bill. An artificial deadline for 
whom? 
The following day was the deadliest 
day in the U.S. fight against COVID–19, 
with more than 100 new deaths re-
ported, and people in Arizona are los-
ing their jobs every single day. While 
the Senator from New York may not 
worry about where his next meal is 
coming from, the people I talk to every 
day in Arizona do. In fact, they are 
more than worried. They are afraid. 
People are dying, and the Democratic 
leaders think this is an opportunity to 
score political points and grab power. 
It is despicable. It is infuriating. It is 
immoral, and it must stop. 
This is an unprecedented challenge 
for our country, but I am confident we 
will prevail. Just like other severe cri-
ses in our history, this pandemic is 
bringing out the best of America and 
the best of Arizona. I am inspired every 
day by stories of Arizonans who are 
stepping up to serve others and putting 
their own concerns and fears aside. 
During this crisis, our country is not 
divided. Our States are not divided. 
Our communities are not divided. In-
stead, Arizonans are being selfless and 
serving others. Young people are deliv-
ering groceries to the elderly. Healthy 
people are volunteering at food banks 
and donating blood. Neighbors are 
pitching in to provide childcare for es-
sential healthcare workers. Faith com-
munities are delivering care packages 
to the vulnerable and first responders. 
They are rising to the occasion because 
that is what we do. 
So here in the Senate, what are we 
supposed to do? Follow their example. 
Rise to the occasion. Put selfish mo-
tives aside. Stop with the opportunism. 
Stop with the ideological wish list, and 
start voting yes immediately to get re-
lief to Americans and Arizonans now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Madam President, I am 
tempted to talk about all of the prob-
lems we have had in getting to this 
point with this legislation, but I am 
wondering if now is not the time to 
talk about why we need to get this

March 24, 2020 
done. We have heard a lot about who is 
wrong and who is right and who is tak-
ing advantage of the moment, but this 
is a moment at which we need to do 
something. This is truly an emergency 
piece of legislation that deals with a 
set of circumstances that nobody has 
ever seen before in our country. We 
have a virus that people are reacting to 
in a way that both encourages them 
and, in some cases, requires them to 
withdraw from the normal economic 
activity of the country. 
This is different than 9/11. With 9/11, 
the American people said: We are going 
to show those terrorists that they can’t 
slow us down. In many cases, people 
got out even more aggressively into 
the economy than they had been be-
fore. In 2008 and 2009, we clearly had a 
huge economic problem, but that eco-
nomic problem didn’t get dramatically 
changed by people’s unwillingness to 
participate, but there was a concern 
about participating. Now we have, fun-
damentally, a very strong economy 
that people have been asked to with-
draw from or have chosen to withdraw 
from or have been advised to withdraw 
from, and we need to figure out what to 
do about that both on the healthcare 
side and on the economic side. 
Our role here is limited. We can’t leg-
islate an end to the coronavirus. If we 
could, we would. We can’t legislate ex-
actly how people will behave, and if we 
could, we probably shouldn’t. We can’t 
tell people they have to wash their 
hands. We can talk a lot about the 
washing of hands, but, legislatively, 
there are a lot of limits there. There 
are some things we can do, and now is 
the time to do the things we can do. 
How do we get the most help to the 
most people in the quickest way? 
I hope we can come together today, 
in the next few hours, and decide that 
the moment is more important than 
everybody’s winning everything one 
would like to win, for this is not the 
moment in which to make the most of 
it because it will not come around 
again. Frankly, in my view, it is going 
to come around again pretty quickly. I 
would say that the minute we are done 
with phase 3, we will start talking 
about phase 4 because all of us know 
that phase 3 can’t include everything 
that needs to be included and that it 
can’t look at some of the details that 
will become only more available and 
obvious after we get into phase 3. 
What do we have to do right now? 
First of all, we have to create a way 
for people to see immediate cash as-
sistance coming for expenses they 
didn’t have before—either healthcare 
expenses they didn’t have before or 
childcare expenses they didn’t have be-
fore or other kinds of expenses. In 
many cases, we are going to see many, 
many more people who will have new 
or current expenses but will not have 
the income they had before. 
Under this bill, a typical middle-class 
family of four would get somewhere in 
the neighborhood of $3,000 to $4,000 
sometime in the early days of April. 
We will immediately begin to talk 
about whether that needs to be re-
peated again as the summer progresses, 
but that is not the point right now. 
The point is, what happens 2 and 3 
weeks from now? 
This bill will and should provide 
emergency funds for food and nutrition 
programs. It will create a temporary 
pandemic 
unemployment 
assistance 
program to give assistance to workers 
who normally wouldn’t be eligible for 
unemployment yet or who wouldn’t be 
eligible at a rate that would sustain 
their families’ expenses. This would in-
clude an additional $600 a week for 
every recipient of unemployment in-
surance for the next 3 weeks. By the 
time we are done, it might be longer 
than 3 weeks, but the goal here is to 
get money into the hands of families 
and, more importantly, to let them 
know that this money is on the way. 
We need to help small businesses that 
are, in many cases, being told they 
have to close. Restaurants and other 
retail businesses have been told by 
Governors in several States that they 
have to close their businesses—that 
they can’t be in those businesses. If 
you are in the restaurant business, you 
might still be able to open and have a 
business, but it will no longer be the 
business you used to have, wherein peo-
ple would come in and sit down and 
order or would come in and order and 
then sit down and the staffing is dif-
ferent. People are going to the unem-
ployment lines and on the unemploy-
ment rolls. 
Part of the goal of this legislation is 
to see that this doesn’t happen. The 
goal is to make loans available to 
small businesspeople. One of the pos-
sible ways to satisfy those loans is just 
to keep your employees in place as part 
of your employee structures for as long 
as you can. In Missouri, we have 532,000 
small businesses. More than 99 percent 
of our businesses in Missouri would 
qualify to meet that small business 
standard. Now, it is difficult enough to 
run a small business in the best of 
times, but these circumstances cer-
tainly don’t allow us to look at this as 
the best of times. 
This legislation would provide money 
to make sure that workers keep those 
jobs. It is easier to bring somebody 
back to work than it is to hire some-
body for work. It is easier if we can 
keep those employees and others in 
place. In fact, at the Big Business level, 
I think one of the criterion for some of 
the potential programs would be that 
you would have to keep your employ-
ees in place, as in the case of the air-
lines, through sometime in September. 
Hopefully, by September, businesses 
will have recovered to the point at 
which it will not be a hardship to keep 
those employees in place. We would 
start with small businesses and then 
look at all of the businesses, using 
loans to cover payroll costs, using 
loans to cover interest on their mort-
gages, if they are small businesspeople, 
or their rent or utilities—using loans 
in a way that they would if they had 
their normal levels of cashflow but 
that are not there now. 
Every day we wait makes it harder 
for a small business or any business to 
decide: Can I keep these people on the 
payroll any longer or is the only choice 
I have to put them on the unemploy-
ment roll? Every day we wait, there 
are more businesses that are making 
that decision. Remember, you have no 
income coming in. All of your money is 
going out, and you have nothing but a 
vague promise that Congress is trying 
to do something about this. People are 
getting let go every single day. There 
are more people out of work today than 
were out of work on Monday morning. 
There will be more people out of work 
tomorrow than there are today. 
We can have a positive impact on 
that if we will just act in a way that 
will help them keep their doors open 
when there is any business to be had 
and to keep their people who work for 
them on the payrolls. 
By the way, with a small business, it 
is usually not just the people who work 
for you but the people who work with 
you—the small businessperson who, in 
many cases, is doing every single job in 
the business, at some point, along with 
somebody else. What can we do to keep 
the door open, to keep the people on 
the payroll, and have them ready to 
bounce back the minute the immediate 
crisis is over? 
Then we need to do things in this bill 
that will support healthcare workers 
and healthcare providers. This bill will 
make sure, I think, to do that in any 
form it is taking at this moment. Cer-
tainly, in the healthcare part that I 
have worked on as the chairman of the 
subcommittee, 
testing 
for 
the 
coronavirus is going to be paid for. It is 
going to be paid for by Medicare. It is 
going to be paid for by Medicaid. It is 
going to be paid for by private insur-
ance. Hospitals will get relief in terms 
of the payments they are supposed to 
make. It will be the regulatory relief 
they need to have as they are trying to 
adapt to a new situation. 
Hospitals will have the flexibility 
with more telehealth services. We al-
ready put that in bill No. 2. We are try-
ing to further refine it here in this bill, 
bill No. 3. One thing that particularly 
has resonance at this moment is tele-
health. If you are telling people, 
‘‘Don’t go to the hospital unless your 
doctor tells you that you have to go to 
the hospital’’ or ‘‘Don’t go to the emer-
gency room as your first place to go; 
rather, find a doctor to talk to’’ or 
‘‘Don’t even go to the doctor; rather, 
find a doctor to talk to,’’ telehealth 
will allow you not only to talk to a 
doctor but also to have that doctor 
look at you and have you look at him 
as you talk to each other. 
We need to be sure that doctors have 
what we are now all calling the per-
sonal protective equipment, the PPEs. 
It is a term that, 6 months ago, I am 
not sure I would have recognized— 
maybe not 6 weeks ago—but it is very

S1997 
March 24, 2020 
much part of this discussion. As a mat-
ter of fact, it is one of the reasons hos-
pitals are being told not to perform 
elective surgeries. Elective surgery is, 
by definition, elective, which means 
you don’t have to have it at that mo-
ment. Yet, if people had plenty of 
equipment, there would be no reason 
for those surgeries not to happen. 
Make sure you have the protective 
equipment 
you 
need 
when 
the 
coronavirus hits your community. 
We need to figure out how to cut 
down the need for that equipment by 
expanding—again—telehealth and by 
not encouraging people to take the test 
who don’t need to take the test because 
every one of those tests requires one to 
wear a pair of gloves, a unique mask, 
and maybe, with some frequency, dif-
ferent protective equipment. We are 
trying to figure out how to do all of 
that. 
We are adding funds for agencies like 
the National Institutes of Health and 
the National Science Foundation so 
they may move toward both thera-
peutics and vaccines as quickly as we 
can. 
Therapeutics 
probably 
happen 
more quickly than vaccines, but we are 
looking for ways to do that and ways 
to encourage their early production. 
Community health centers matter. 
Certified community behavioral health 
centers matter. In this bill, we are 
looking at how we will extend the leg-
islation to allow those entities to exist, 
for we will have reached the end of the 
authorized period in May. There is no 
reason to have that happen in May. 
This bill should take those healthcare 
extension programs out longer than 
the 22nd of May, and I believe it will. 
There are a lot of competing inter-
ests here that we have to balance. By 
the time we vote on the bill, no person 
who will vote on it will think every-
thing in it is exactly what he would 
like to have there. We don’t get to leg-
islate that way. I am just hoping that 
there will not be so much in it that I 
won’t like that it will create a bigger 
problem than I will want to have. I 
want to vote for this bill. I want to get 
it done. I want to get it out there for 
people to see. It is harder for me to do 
that if it includes a lot of extraneous 
things that will clearly have nothing 
to do with this healthcare emergency. I 
hope that we will not have to make 
that decision. I hope we will get fo-
cused on the task. 
All of those whom I, the Presiding 
Officer, and Senator ENZI—sitting here 
beside me—have talked to have pretty 
good cases about how this is affecting 
them. Charities call in and say: We just 
had to cancel our one, big fundraising 
event of the year. Charities call in and 
say: Our volunteers aren’t showing up. 
The for-profit people are impacted; 
the not-for-profit groups are impacted; 
travel is impacted; agriculture is im-
pacted. We are about to get to the sea-
son of the year where people have com-
munity 
festivals 
and 
community 
fairs—the Missouri State Fair, Ozark 
Empire Fair, the carnivals that occur 
in our State. The 6- to 10-month travel 
destinations, like Silver Dollar City or 
Six Flags or Worlds of Fun—if you lose 
part of that season, that season is lost, 
and you are not going to get that May 
or that June or that April back. You 
are not going to be able to tack it on 
by saying: Well, we will just be open in 
January to make up for the people who 
would have been at our theme park in 
June. That is not going to happen. 
We are going to have the Ozark Em-
pire Fair in Springfield, MO, some dif-
ferent time of the year than August be-
cause August is hard this year. 
I noticed today they announced that 
the Olympics in Tokyo are going to be 
postponed by 1 year. You never get 
that year back. You never get that fair 
back. You never get that county fair, 
that agricultural opportunity to look 
at agriculture and horticulture and 
local industry back once it is gone, 
whether it is the midway operations or 
the part-time workers who make those 
things work. All those things are get-
ting away from us, and we have to 
begin to look—and I think we will do 
that more in part 4 than we were able 
to in part 3: How do we go back in and 
make sure that, as much as possible, 
we protected these businesses and 
these not-for-profits so that a year 
from now they are still around? How do 
you miss all or part of this year’s ac-
tivity and still be there next year? 
So we have our work cut out for us. 
It won’t end with the bill we are work-
ing on right now. So if anybody out 
there, my colleagues, is waiting until 
this bill solves every problem we need 
to solve, we will wait too long. 
Just as we were able to move forward 
with part 1 and get money out there 
quickly for the healthcare providers, 
the researchers at the Federal level, 
part 2 did more of that at the State and 
local levels, as well as beginning to 
think about people staying at work. 
Part 3 does all the things I have just 
talked about and more, but there will 
be a part 4. We have to get this done. 
People are unemployed today who 
would not be unemployed if we would 
have done this work on Monday. People 
will be unemployed tomorrow who 
would not have been unemployed if we 
finish this work today. 
Let’s get our business done. Let’s get 
started on finding out the gaps that 
still need to be filled. Let’s do what the 
American people expect us to do and 
treat an emergency like it is an emer-
gency, not like it is an opportunity. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
BLACKBURN). The Senator from Wyo-
ming. 
Mr. ENZI. Madam President, today I 
come to the floor to talk about the 
plight of America’s small businesses, to 
talk about the plight of their owners, 
to talk about the plight of their em-
ployees. 
As a former small business owner 
myself, I am here to plead their case 
and reiterate how important it is that 
Congress helps them and helps them 
now. 
Small businesses are an important 
part of our American economy that 
help our country and its inhabitants to 
thrive, and they employ millions of 
people. 
Here is what Congress has done so far 
in response to the coronavirus crisis: 
We had package No. 1. It was $8 billion. 
Around here, that used to be a big 
number—$8 billion for healthcare. 
Then we did package 2, and that 
beefed up the healthcare needs and 
other things. 
I should mention that that package 
was put together by the House without 
input from the Senate. It was put to-
gether by Democrats without Repub-
lican input. We in the Senate saw the 
crisis, and even though Republicans 
saw things they did not want and 
things that were missing, the bill 
passed in 1 day without amendments. 
We held our nose and swallowed. We 
recognized the urgency of the situa-
tion. 
Now a package has been put together 
through task groups with equal rep-
resentation from both sides of the 
aisle, and it is being decried as a Re-
publican bill. This package is to take 
care of the second wave of disaster— 
the disaster of unemployment—mas-
sive unemployment—caused by govern-
ment caution. Government caution is 
saving lives, but it is putting people 
out of work. 
The 
virus 
has 
closed 
businesses 
which, in turn, lay off employees. It 
has closed schools. It has changed 
every aspect of our daily lives, and it 
has left people isolated. It has put a 
strain on healthcare workers and first 
responders. It has done it in what was 
a strong and growing economy. 
Why isn’t there more concern for the 
employees out of work? Why haven’t 
we already done at least the parts of 
this bill that give nongovernment em-
ployees some comfort and hope? 
The main reason is government can’t 
identify with the small businessman. 
No one in Congress has to be concerned 
about how to pay his or her employees. 
That is the first place government 
money 
goes, 
even 
if 
government 
doesn’t have any. 
Government employees—our staffs— 
know they have a job and they will be 
paid. Employees in the private sector 
don’t have any confidence in their next 
paycheck in this new turmoil. 
Many have been laid off. They have 
lost their paycheck. They have lost 
their health benefits. The schools and 
daycare have closed. Their world has 
been upended. They went from a bright 
future to unemployed in a couple of 
weeks. Congress can’t even imagine 
their dilemma. Congress is immune 
economically. 
A small business doesn’t exist for the 
government; it exists in spite of the 
government. Someone with a lot of 
guts, determination, and what they 
think is a good idea had the gumption 
to start a business. They take risks 
without guarantees. Many folks, with-
out any help from Congress, launched

March 24, 2020 
new businesses to sell their products or 
services and were successful enough to 
hire employees. 
At that point, they built a business 
family. Successful small businesses 
work in that way. They know their em-
ployees and share a sense of pride for 
helping to provide for them. They often 
know the family of the employee. Usu-
ally, they work side by side with those 
employees. They share their joys and 
their sorrows. 
But in contrast to government, they 
have to sell something of value. They 
have to make a profit or they have no 
money to pay employees. 
None of them like to lay off employ-
ees, but we have built a backstop of un-
employment so that the employees can 
still get some money. However, the 
owner of the business doesn’t have that 
backstop. The owner of the business 
would rather be employing his people. 
But here is the dilemma we have for 
our small businesses, and it is unprece-
dented: Government has effectively 
taken their customers away. Govern-
ment, to protect people from the virus, 
has virtually closed down everything 
but grocery stores, hospitals, and clin-
ics. 
Government 
has 
even 
rec-
ommended 
curtailing 
nonessential 
medical services if they are not for ad-
dressing the virus or some other life- 
or-death situation. 
But the real sector that has been 
hurt is the employees in the small 
business sector, through no fault of 
their own nor any fault of the person 
managing the business. Government 
has taken their jobs away. 
Answers are available and have been 
worked out by a group of equal number 
from both parties, but we continue to 
be stopped in our efforts. 
I sincerely hope this is not about 
bringing down the President or some-
one trying to take advantage of a crisis 
in order to gain political achievements 
otherwise not possible. 
I gave a speech last Friday about the 
way to save the employees of small 
businesses. The package was ready 
then. That employee retention package 
is part of what has been held up since 
Sunday. 
Yes, we stayed through the weekend 
to get a solution before the markets 
opened on Monday, but it was voted 
down. 
In record time, we accepted a Demo-
cratic bill written in the House last 
week without any amendments. Now a 
bipartisan product has been held up. 
For what? Some of the demands of 
those across the aisle have nothing to 
do with the virus. There are demands 
for climate change. The economic cli-
mate has changed and is changing 
daily, and they want to wedge in some 
ideas they know would fail standing 
alone. 
I have always said the best legisla-
tion is step-by-step legislation, but we 
always try to be comprehensive. Maybe 
that is so that it is incomprehensible 
and too big for anyone to understand or 
know. 
Now, here is how the small business 
employee retention part works: Busi-
nesses across America are shut down or 
considering shutting down. Many busi-
nesses don’t have any sales. No sales, 
no money—no money to pay employees 
or other bills that come due. 
Every truly small business owner has 
that experience of sitting straight up 
in bed in the middle of the night and 
saying: Payroll is coming. Payday is 
coming. Do I have enough cash to pay 
my employees? That comes with a de-
crease in sales. 
But this time many businesses are 
faced with no business—no business— 
and not through a fault of their own. 
So the only controllable variable is 
employees. They can lay off employees 
to cut costs. If employees get laid off, 
they can file for unemployment, but 
they lose their health insurance at a 
time health expenses could be immi-
nent. 
Most people in government can’t ap-
preciate this dilemma. It is happening 
in the business world. In fact, the lines 
at some unemployment offices are so 
long, they discourage filing. And the 
rule about keeping safe distance? Wow. 
In this instance, the government has 
essentially shut down many businesses, 
eliminating their sales and eliminating 
their cash to pay employees. For small 
business, their bank says: I am sorry. I 
can’t loan you any money because you 
don’t have any sales, and you can’t pay 
me back. Government doesn’t have to 
file bankruptcy, but small businesses 
do. 
The owner probably also has to pay 
rent, heat, and utilities, to name a few 
essentials. 
But their main concern is with em-
ployees. They need employees. They 
need trained employees. When they lay 
off their loyal, trusted employees, they 
can’t be sure they can get them back 
later. 
So this bill has a solution, and I con-
gratulate the people who worked on it. 
One of them has joined me here on the 
floor, 
Senator 
SHAHEEN. 
Senator 
CARDIN worked on it. This bill has a so-
lution. 
While Congress continues to nego-
tiate it, here is the direction it is head-
ing: The Federal Government will loan 
the businesses the money to pay their 
employees, provided they don’t lay 
them off and they rehire the ones who 
have been laid off. The employees keep 
their jobs and their health insurance, 
even if the business is closed down. 
When things come back to more nor-
mal, if the owner has been keeping all 
of his employees, that part of the 
money that they got is forgiven. They 
are back in business. They have the 
skilled employees they had, and busi-
ness can continue to pay the employ-
ees. 
That part of the bill alone generally 
takes care of employees of any business 
with less than 500 employees—yes, even 
1 employee, which would be many busi-
nesses based in my home State of Wyo-
ming. In Wyoming there are a lot of 
communities that do not even have 500 
residents. We are a State made up of 
small towns, some of which have only 
one or two businesses. And in my 
State, hundreds are or could be laid off 
each day. Provisions to stop that are 
an important part of the bill. 
Another part of the bill helps those 
whose business is gone. In cases in 
which the pay retention for employees 
doesn’t work, the unemployment has 
been increased up to $600 a week in ad-
dition to the normal unemployment 
benefits. 
And to keep things intact during the 
transition, the bill provides direct pay-
ment to every taxpayer of $1,200 if 
making less than $75,000 or $2,400 if fil-
ing jointly and making less than 
$150,000 combined. Plus there will be 
$500 for each child in the family. That 
is to tide people over while the other 
relief kicks in. 
But it shouldn’t take long for the 
employer retention part to kick in, as 
all of the structure is in place now. 
Any community bank, any lending in-
stitution, can give the loan to a small 
business without having to check col-
lateral or any of the other cumbersome 
steps to normally getting a loan, and 
the lender is guaranteed by the Federal 
Government. 
Loans to others. You have heard 
about big businesses that have lost 
their customers in response to the 
virus. Generally, if they have over 500 
employees, they are ineligible for the 
employee retention piece, but there are 
loans quickly available. There are no 
grants for big companies, just loans, 
and the companies are prohibited from 
using the money to buy back stock and 
are also prohibited from pay increases 
or bonuses to managers. The loans are 
at market rate with no forgiveness. 
They will have to be paid back. This is 
a lifeline to keep jobs. 
There is money available to State 
and local governments—$186 billion. 
For hospitals there is another $75 bil-
lion; for veterans, $20 billion; another 
$11 billion for vaccines, therapeutics, 
and diagnostics; $4.5 billion more for 
the Centers for Disease Control, in ad-
dition to what was done before; $12 bil-
lion for K–12 education; $10 billion for 
airports; $20 billion for public transpor-
tation. 
These and other solutions have been 
held up by the Democrats. Every single 
Democrat has voted against cloture so 
far. They say they need more time to 
negotiate. They promise an agreement 
is imminent. 
My colleagues across the aisle have 
used Senate procedures to unneces-
sarily drag this out. Let me describe 
the Senate process and how long it can 
take to get a final product. It can be 
necessary to get three clotures. That 
means a vote supported by at least 60 
Senators. Anyone absent counts as a no 
vote. Neither party has 60 Members. So 
the minority has great power. Many 
votes from their side are necessary. 
Anyone who is sick from the virus and 
cannot be here counts as a no vote. If

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1999 
March 24, 2020 
the virus hits Congress harder, it will 
be harder for us to even function. So 
we can’t wait. 
Back to how cloture works and why 
it takes so long, bills can be delayed in 
the Senate almost a week if even one 
person doesn’t like it. That is what is 
happening now, except it is a lot more 
than one person. A shell bill from the 
House has been put up to conform to a 
constitutional rule that spending bills 
have to originate in the House. What 
we have been voting on isn’t even the 
real bill. It is a shell. 
A motion to proceed to the bill has to 
be by unanimous consent or have clo-
ture filed. If 60 Senators vote for clo-
ture, then there can be 30 hours of de-
bate on whether we should take up the 
real issue. 
To actually get to amend the bill 
takes another 60 votes, to allow amend-
ments and another 30 hours, unless ev-
erybody agrees. After amendments are 
finished or if there is a feeling that we 
could be moving on without unanimous 
consent, there would be a final vote to 
close off debate. That would also take 
60 votes. So the need to have leverage 
before the first cloture vote on the 
shell in order to negotiate just doesn’t 
cut it, with the first vote or the second 
vote and the expenditure of 30 hours 
between each vote. That is why we 
stayed around and voted on Sunday, so 
maybe we could get the first 30 hours 
out of the way while negotiations went 
on and then get to the bill and then get 
to the amendments. 
My colleagues across the aisle are 
using this process to forward their 
agenda even for issues unrelated to this 
crisis. We are not doing climate change 
as part of this emergency bill. Every-
thing should have a direct connection 
to the coronavirus. Rome is burning 
and Congress is fiddling. This bill 
should take care of our country’s in-
habitants and communities. Protec-
tions for small businesses, their own-
ers, and employers are vital and an im-
portant piece of this response. I im-
plore everyone to vote for cloture. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I 
come to the floor today, like so many 
of my colleagues, during what is un-
doubtedly the worst crisis that I have 
seen in my lifetime. It reminds me of 
hearing from my parents and grand-
parents about what it was like in 
America during the Depression and 
during World War II. This crisis in 
some ways is even worse because it is 
an enemy we can’t see—the novel 
coronavirus, or COVID–19. 
Not since the 1918 outbreak of the 
Spanish influenza has a pandemic 
posed such an immense threat to the 
public health of our country. As of this 
morning, more than 47,000 Americans 
who have been tested have tested posi-
tive for COVID–19. We have actually 
tested more than that, but that is the 
number who have tested positive, and 
593 Americans have, unfortunately, 
died from this disease. Just yesterday, 
health officials reported that more 
than 100 Americans lost their lives in a 
single day. 
I know that everyone in this Cham-
ber is thinking of those families and 
those people who have been lost due to 
this disease. 
Sadly, no one is immune. Everyone is 
affected, including in my home State 
of New Hampshire. We have had more 
than 100 Granite Staters who have fall-
en ill from the coronavirus, and, sadly, 
just in the last few days, one person 
has died. My heart goes out to these 
families and to the family of the person 
we have lost. 
This virus hasn’t only threatened the 
public health of the Nation, but it 
threatens our economy as well. Mil-
lions of Americans have been asked to 
stay in their homes. Schools and busi-
nesses have been closed. While we all 
understand that this is a necessary 
step to help curb the spread of the dis-
ease, it is taking a huge toll on our 
workers, our families, and our economy 
as a whole. The aftermath of this na-
tionwide emergency could leave tens of 
millions of families without work or 
steady income. 
I have been working closely with my 
colleagues here in Congress and with 
the rest of the delegation from New 
Hampshire and with our Governor to 
try and think about what we should 
come up with, what kind of package 
would help those people who are hurt-
ing. During the past couple of weeks, I 
have had many phone calls with may-
ors, public health officials, small busi-
ness owners, social service agencies, 
and all of those people who are on the 
frontlines of this crisis. 
I have heard from nonprofit organiza-
tions that provide vital services to 
with those with disabilities, to our sen-
ior citizens and veterans, and to those 
in recovery from substance use dis-
orders—because even as we are grap-
pling 
with 
the 
impact 
of 
this 
coronavirus, New Hampshire is still 
sadly in the midst of a persistent sub-
stance misuse epidemic. Thanks to the 
tireless efforts of advocates, providers, 
policymakers, and so many in our 
State, we have made strides toward 
curbing the substance misuse crisis. We 
are ensuring that resources are there 
so that people can get the care they 
need. Even though we are facing a pan-
demic, substance misuse doesn’t take a 
day off. 
However, organizations that provide 
essential treatment and counseling for 
Granite Staters are also dealing with 
decreased capacity and revenue short-
falls that threaten their ability to con-
tinue to be a resource for their commu-
nities over the long-term. Our critical 
frontline healthcare providers, as well 
as first responders, police, firefighters, 
and EMTs, who are on the frontlines of 
responding to and treating coronavirus 
cases are lacking medical resources 
and personal protective equipment that 
is so necessary to do their jobs at this 
critical time. We are hearing from hos-
pitals that are facing an uncertain fi-
nancial future due to the crisis. All of 
these troubling situations point to the 
need for immediate relief so that the 
organizations and agencies that Gran-
ite Staters rely on can continue to be 
there. 
I agree with my colleagues who have 
come to the floor over the last 2 days 
to say that Congress must act. We 
must act to provide relief so that so 
many Americans who are suffering can 
get the help they desperately need. 
In the past 2 weeks, Congress has 
taken several steps to provide imme-
diate help to those families who are af-
fected by the coronavirus. These in-
clude emergency paid sick leave to 
many workers who get infected with 
the virus, who have had to self-quar-
antine, or who need to take care of 
family members. We provided emer-
gency measures to ensure that every 
American, including those without in-
surance, 
is 
able 
to 
have 
their 
coronavirus testing costs fully covered. 
We have expanded unemployment in-
surance for those who are laid off as a 
result of the virus. 
We can and we must do more. Con-
gress must work to address the eco-
nomic devastation that so many are 
facing because of this virus. Just yes-
terday, we heard from a senior Federal 
Reserve official who warned that the 
U.S. unemployment rate could sky-
rocket because of this pandemic, and 
we are seeing that. I know that all of 
us are seeing that in our States. At 
home in New Hampshire, we have had 
thousands apply for unemployment in-
surance because they have been laid off 
in the last few weeks. 
The message from the frontlines is 
this: We need help and we need it fast, 
and Congress must provide that help— 
help for our hospitals, healthcare pro-
viders, and first responders as they pre-
pare for a surge in demand for treat-
ment as this virus spreads. 
We want to make sure that they have 
the medical equipment and the sup-
plies they need to keep them safe while 
they are treating so many people who 
are ill. We need financial relief and 
paid leave to workers, especially to 
hourly workers and to those who have 
been laid off because of the impact of 
this virus. 
We need support for small businesses. 
Small businesses are the lifeblood of 
New Hampshire’s economy. We have to 
make sure they stay afloat and that 
they pay their workers while they are 
closed or have reduced demand. We 
need to provide childcare and elder 
care for healthcare workers, especially 
for those who are being asked to work 
extra shifts. We need assistance so 
Americans can afford their healthcare 
treatment. That is what I am fighting 
for. 
We are making significant progress. 
We have seen movement in the last 
couple of days. I want to call out my 
colleagues, Senators RUBIO and CARDIN, 
the chair and ranking member of the 
Small Business Committee, and Sen-
ator COLLINS. The four of us have

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2000 
March 24, 2020 
worked together on small business pro-
visions that are in this bill. Work con-
tinued through the weekend and late 
into the night last night to reach 
agreement on these provisions, and we 
are almost there. I am confident that 
in the end we will be able to deliver a 
package of well-thought-out provisions 
that will provide over $350 billion in as-
sistance for small businesses and non-
profit organizations in New Hampshire 
and throughout the country. This bi-
partisan package will provide imme-
diate cash flow assistance so that small 
businesses can continue to pay their 
employees, make their rent, pay their 
mortgage, and pay their utility bills. 
The bill will also provide support to 
small business development centers, to 
women’s business centers, to veterans 
business outreach centers, and all 
those resource agencies that can help 
small businesses as they try to figure 
out how to navigate this crisis and how 
to get the help they need. 
We are also providing 6 months of re-
lief for existing SBA borrowers. Of 
course, to make this work, we need all 
those lending institutions—our banks 
and financial institutions that are al-
ready on the frontlines trying to help 
small businesses. They are going to be 
critical to making this package work. 
There is much more to be done. We 
still need to provide funding for State 
and local governments because, as we 
speak, tax revenues are plummeting 
and the costs of responding to this cri-
sis are skyrocketing. I have heard from 
so many municipal officials who are on 
the frontlines and spending money and 
are not sure how to replace those dol-
lars as they fight this crisis. 
We need additional funding for hos-
pitals because they are going to see a 
terrifying surge of patients in the com-
ing days and weeks. They are going to 
have to make very difficult decisions 
about the kind of care they are able to 
provide, and we need to make sure they 
have the resources they need. 
We need to make sure that big cor-
porations continue to support their 
workers through this crisis. We need 
legislation to ensure that New Hamp-
shire nonprofits and social service or-
ganizations like those in the rest of the 
country that are in dire financial 
straits can continue to receive assist-
ance because their services are needed 
now more than ever. Once we get 
through the worst of this crisis, we are 
going to need those organizations to 
continue to serve people in our commu-
nities. 
I think I and most of my colleagues 
here are working in a bipartisan way 
and with this administration to find 
common ground and to address the 
needs of the Nation. 
I have been disappointed at some of 
the partisan attacks on the floor of the 
Senate because I think everybody’s 
goal is the same. It is to respond to the 
needs of this Nation, to make it clear 
to people who are our constituents and 
people across this country that we are 
here to try and address the suffering 
they are experiencing. 
Our country is hurting right now. 
People are looking to this body for 
leadership. That is why it is so impor-
tant that we get this bill right. This is 
one of those times in history when 
Congress must set aside any political 
differences and where we must deliver 
a bill that meets the challenges we face 
because at the end of the day, we are 
all in this together. 
One of the encouraging things that I 
have felt as I have watched the news 
and heard from people across the coun-
try are those people who are stepping 
up now at this time of difficulty. Just 
this morning, I heard about one of our 
small 
businesses 
in 
northern 
New 
Hampshire who knew that people were 
buying out toilet paper and that super-
markets and any stores that carried 
toilet paper were sold out. 
They called down the road to Gorham 
Paper, which is one of our paper mills 
that is still operating that provides tis-
sue for people across the country. They 
called them to see if they had any toi-
let tissue they could provide for busi-
nesses in the community. We have a 
Federal prison in that community in 
Berlin. They found out, so they called 
them to provide toilet tissue for the 
prison. It seems like a small thing, but 
it is the kind of thing that has helped 
people and made it possible for people 
to continue to see past the worst of 
this crisis, to see beyond, and to see 
how we can all work together to co-
operate to get through this. 
Let’s show the American people that 
their elected leaders can address the 
needs of this country. Let’s get this 
bill done. We have no time to waste. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CAS-
SIDY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
Mr. LEAHY. Today, the American 
people are making sacrifices to keep 
themselves, their family, and their 
communities 
safe. 
Healthcare 
pro-
viders, grocery store staff, State and 
local government workers, truckers, 
bank tellers, journalists and countless 
others are doing important and nec-
essary work on the front lines of this 
crisis. As a Senator from Vermont, and 
a Member of this Chamber for more 
than 40 years, I want to send my pro-
found thanks. 
Right now, we are close to expressing 
our understanding of the sacrifices of 
the American people in more than 
words. I believe we are very close to 
reaching a bipartisan agreement that 
will provide direct and immediate re-
lief to working people and families in 
our country. 
As vice chairman of the Senate Ap-
propriations Committee, I want to pro-
vide Senators with an update on the 
status of those negotiations in the Ap-
propriations Committee between my-
self and Chairman SHELBY. There is 
much we have already agreed upon, and 
I am confident that we can reach a deal 
that will help millions of Americans in 
need. 
Hospitals, community health centers, 
and the health care institutions we will 
rely on in the coming weeks and 
months need to be ready for a potential 
surge of patients. In our agreement, we 
are securing hundreds of billions of dol-
lars in direct assistance for these vital 
institutions. 
Across the country, we are hearing 
reports of medical care providers and 
first responders reusing masks or first 
responders resorting to covering their 
faces with bandanas for protection. It 
is unacceptable. Increasing their po-
tential risk of exposure to the corona 
virus because they do not have the 
tools and resources they need to do 
their job will only put further strain on 
our healthcare system to say nothing 
of the danger to those men and women. 
So we fought hard to include the re-
sources to make sure health care, po-
lice officers, National Guard members, 
scientists and more have access to the 
personal protective equipment they 
need. 
In times of crisis, it is critical that 
we support the most vulnerable among 
us. That is why I fought to include sig-
nificant new resources for programs 
that provide food to those in need, in-
cluding 
child 
nutrition 
programs, 
SNAP, and senior meals. Sadly, as this 
public health crisis progresses, the de-
mand for nutrition programs will only 
grow in the coming months. I also 
fought to secure resources for the 
homeless, who without a clean, safe 
place to go are at a much higher risk of 
contracting the coronavirus among 
themselves and spreading it in their 
communities. 
Every Member in this Chamber rep-
resents a rural community, and we will 
ensure that they are not left behind by 
supporting rural business and including 
help for rural hospitals, who unfortu-
nately will not be spared for the im-
pact of this pandemic, and resources to 
support broadband access, which will 
be critically important for keeping 
people connected as we are encouraging 
them to stay apart. 
We are securing funds to support 
child care. We cannot ask communities 
to close down their schools and still 
rely upon their first responders, med-
ical providers, and those on the front 
lines without providing their children 
with a safe place to go. 
We are providing direct appropria-
tions to support a science-first ap-
proach to this pandemic by providing 
an infusion of funding to back research 
in therapeutics, vaccines, and treat-
ments. It is our communities—State 
and local govemment—who are on the 
front lines of this crisis, and it is our 
job to support their efforts. We will be 
including billions of dollars to support 
the services these communities are 
providing during this crisis.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2001 
March 24, 2020 
I have listened to the rhetoric on this 
floor the past few days, accusing Demo-
crats of delaying critical assistance to 
America. This is ridiculous. Democrats 
have spent the last 48 hours fighting 
for funding and legislation that will 
help people, not just corporations. We 
have been fighting for more money for 
healthcare, more money for children, 
more money for hospitals, more money 
for our schools. And in the last few 
days we have secured more funding for 
all of those things. 
I feel confident we will soon reach a 
deal. The Appropriations Committee’s 
component is only one part of this 
massive package. But the pandemic we 
face demands this response. The Senate 
has a history of being the conscience of 
the nation, and we must prove that his-
tory true again during this crisis 
whether it is today or tomorrow. We 
will get this done, and we will get it 
done soon. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). Without objection, it is so 
ordered. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
would 
like 
to 
speak 
to 
the 
coronavirus—more 
specifically, 
the 
Senate’s response to the coronavirus 
or, shall I say, apparently the absence 
of a response. 
I am a doctor, and one of the most 
exciting things they often show in a 
TV show is when there is an emer-
gency—there is a car wreck, some-
body’s heart stops beating, somebody 
faints, something like that—every re-
source is brought. I have been in that 
situation, and when it occurs, there is 
someone who might be called—you 
know, runs the show, if you will, or the 
captain of the show and begins to say 
‘‘You must do this’’ or ‘‘You must do 
that.’’ At that point, nicety does not 
matter. Orders are given, you respond, 
and things are done. That is because 
there is not a moment to be lost. 
I think I bring that sense of urgency 
to this situation. Our Presiding Officer 
was in the military as a combat pilot. 
She knows quite well that sometimes 
minutes matter. Sometimes minutes 
matter. I would argue that ‘‘sometime’’ 
is now. 
I have been staying away from gro-
cery stores, et cetera, and eating 
through my frozen food. There is stuff 
in the fridge. Somebody told me they 
went to the grocery store, and busi-
nesses that had been in business last 
week are now boarded up. I am having 
calls regularly with small business 
owners back in Louisiana, and they are 
so worried about cashflow and trying 
to keep people on. Some have already 
laid folks off, wondering what they can 
do. The uncertainty is destroying their 
livelihood. If the livelihood of a small 
businesswoman is destroyed, so is the 
livelihood of everyone she employs. 
There is a sense of urgency that every-
one in the Nation should feel but is not 
being acted upon now. 
Now, let’s describe the situation, be-
cause what I actually think—I have 
tried to understand why that urgency 
is not here. It is not a general lack of 
urgency; it is a specific lack of urgency 
of the Speaker of the House and the 
minority leader in the Senate—the mi-
nority leader being the senior Senator 
from New York. It is a specific lack of 
urgency in which they attempt to le-
verage the misery of the American peo-
ple so that they can achieve their po-
litical goal. 
I have thought deeply about that po-
litical goal. In fact, I have noticed 
whenever something is said by the mi-
nority leader—the senior Senator from 
New York—I have to think, well, it is 
opposite day, as my children will say. 
There is actually something opposite 
being said. Let me just figure out what 
that opposite thing is. 
So let’s go through where we are, and 
then we will go through the opposite- 
day aspect of our conversations. 
First, people are hurting, but not just 
people being laid off. Schools have been 
discharged. My wife cofounded a school 
for children with dyslexia—a public 
charter school. Children of all back-
grounds come and have their dyslexia 
addressed. It is critical that those chil-
dren be in school. There is a science- 
based way for those kids to learn how 
to read, and if they have to be dis-
missed because of fear about spreading 
disease, then those children are not 
being exposed to that science-based 
curriculum, and those children are, 
therefore, losing the opportunity both 
to learn and to have their issue of dys-
lexia addressed. That is just one 
school. There are very many more. 
So, to address that, last week, the 
Senate majority leader put together a 
proposal where he would have Senators 
from the Republican Party draft some 
initial concepts—clearly not written in 
stone and clearly open to negotiation— 
and then meet with Democratic coun-
terparts to come up with a bipartisan 
solution that would reflect the perspec-
tives of all 100 Senators, knowing that 
each Senator represents a different 
constituency elected by people with a 
different viewpoint, but the amalgama-
tion of those viewpoints and constitu-
encies would come up with a wide pub-
lic policy that would help to address 
both the medical crisis and the eco-
nomic crisis. It was bipartisan. And I 
was struck when one of our Democratic 
colleagues was on a show and was 
asked about the process, and he said 
that it actually worked well. 
I met with the small businesspeople. 
I met with this Senator from the 
Democratic side and this Senator from 
the Republican side, and we had a proc-
ess that worked. It worked very well on 
the Member level. It is in the leader-
ship that it broke down. Oh, that is in-
teresting. In the leadership, the bipar-
tisan process, with a product that both 
sides had agreed upon, broke down. 
Now, let’s contrast this bipartisan 
process, which led to a series of poli-
cies, with the opposite-day rhetoric 
that has been used by the Senate mi-
nority leader. The bipartisan product 
came up with an economic stabiliza-
tion fund in which dollars would be 
transferred to the Treasury Depart-
ment, which would then be transferred 
to the Federal Reserve to set up guar-
anteed loans so that an industry, not a 
specific business, an industry—think 
tourist 
industry, 
think 
healthcare, 
somebody particularly affected by the 
coronavirus 
epidemic—as 
a 
class, 
would be able to come and get guaran-
teed loans to keep their people em-
ployed and to keep their business going 
so that when we get through this rough 
patch, their business can restart as be-
fore. 
Now, the opposite-day rhetoric of the 
Senate minority leader is that this is a 
bailout for big corporations, and it was 
a sweetheart deal put together by Re-
publicans. Oh, opposite day. It was ac-
tually a bipartisan deal that goes 
through the Federal Reserve in a way 
that is sector-specific but not business- 
specific with the goal of keeping people 
employed. 
The opposite-day rhetoric is that it is 
a bailout. These are loans—specifi-
cally, loans that have to be paid back. 
By law, the Federal Reserve cannot 
take a loss. That is not a bailout. That 
is a loan to keep people employed, and 
it is wise public policy brought to-
gether on a bipartisan basis—bipar-
tisan, Democrats and Republicans—to 
come up with a solution reflecting all 
viewpoints across the country. 
So, despite the opposite-day rhetoric, 
as somebody who wishes to disparage, 
who wishes to diminish, who wishes to 
depreciate a process that worked as the 
Senate is supposed to work—instead, it 
was denigrated. I kept asking myself 
why. Why? We will come to that in a 
little bit. 
What else about the opposite-day 
process? That not enough is spent on 
healthcare. I am a doctor. I went 
through 
these 
provisions 
for 
healthcare. We are spending literally— 
literally—tens of billions of dollars on 
healthcare, trying to find where to use 
it best. The opposite-day rhetoric is 
that we are not. I didn’t quite figure 
that one out. 
We are not spending on the average 
American—opposite-day rhetoric. We 
give $1,200 to an individual and $2,400 to 
a couple. That just goes out the door. 
Those folks get it. That is a commit-
ment. 
We are also committed to keeping 
small businesses afloat with an expe-
dited process by which that small busi-
ness can obtain cash and a loan, and 
that loan, the portion of which is used 
to keep people employed, is forgiven— 
forgiven. So if I borrowed—if I were a 
restaurant 
owner 
and 
I 
borrowed 
$100,000 and I use $75,000 of it to keep 
my employees employed, that $75,000 is

S2002 
March 24, 2020 
forgiven, and I only owe back—I only 
have to pay back $25,000. That is a bi-
partisan policy put together specifi-
cally to keep Americans employed with 
their benefits. 
By the way, if you were a waitress or 
a waiter, your tips were included in 
your salary, so even though you might 
get a smaller amount, you make it up 
on tips. We took that into account 
with this bipartisan legislation—bipar-
tisan legislation that addressed that 
need. 
Opposite day—the Senate minority 
leader’s rhetoric was that we weren’t 
taking care of people. Why would he 
not tell the truth? Why would he spe-
cifically attempt to fool the American 
people about what was actually being 
done? I had to think about that. Why 
would he attempt to corrupt the entire 
process to tell the American people 
something which is not true? I am not 
sure about that. I am not sure about 
that. 
So we got the deal put up by the 
Speaker of the House in which she said: 
In exchange for the airlines being able 
to continue to employ flight attend-
ants and pilots and ground crew and 
administrators, they would have to do 
an emission profile for every airplane. 
Hmm, I am struggling to stay afloat. I 
have no passengers, and my cashflow is 
immediately interrupted, but, by the 
way, let me go out and get an emis-
sions profile for my airplane or else, 
otherwise, I don’t get to stay in busi-
ness. 
That is so absurd that I kept think-
ing: That cannot be the answer. That is 
so stupid. How can you label it any-
thing else in this circumstance? When 
people are in the process of boarding up 
their businesses, that is the nonsense 
you would propose? 
So I kept thinking: Why would they 
want that when American people are 
hurting, and just like in a military 
emergency and just like in a medical 
emergency, it demands rapid action? 
I was just presiding before you, and 
as I was about to come on, I heard on 
the TV somebody speaking, the senior 
Senator from Illinois, and I got a clue. 
He was not speaking of the Senate 
working, where Republicans and Demo-
crats come together and respecting 100 
different constituencies, 100 different 
viewpoints on a bipartisan basis, estab-
lishing policy that works for all, tak-
ing into account that Louisiana is dif-
ferent than Arizona, and Arizona is dif-
ferent than Maine, and Maine is dif-
ferent than Washington State. 
We are all Americans, but we have 
different industries, and so part of this 
bipartisan process, involving as many 
Senators as possible, was to totally re-
flect that which was going on. 
But I finally had my clue as to why 
the Senate majority leader wants this 
process to break down. It is not to be 
representative of us as a whole but, 
rather, that merely which he and the 
Speaker of the House can negotiate. 
The Democratic whip from Illinois 
spoke of the four corners process. Now, 
those who are watching may not know 
what the four corners are. The four 
corners are when nothing else can 
work, you get the Senate majority 
leader, the Senate minority leader, the 
Speaker of the House, and the minority 
leader of the House meeting with the 
White House, and the four of them de-
cide on everything. There is no trans-
parency. They will come out with a 
2,000-page bill with all kinds of sweet-
heart bills tucked into it, totally leav-
ing out 98 other Senators but not leav-
ing out those stakeholders. 
If you are a stakeholder and you have 
someone on your speed dial as one of 
those four corners, you can get what 
you want. So in this opposite-day type 
reality, where someone speaks of bail-
outs, I am thinking: Ah, somebody 
wants a particular industry bailed out 
and doesn’t want the scrutiny of 100 
Senators looking at it with enough 
time to consider it. No, they want to 
release the bill tonight to vote on it to-
morrow morning. Now, the emergency 
kicks in. They say: Oh, it is something 
we can think about—until that deal is 
baked, and then we have no time to 
consider it, and then we must vote. 
That is how the four corners process 
works. 
Suddenly, it dawned on me. Remem-
ber the process that I spoke of in which 
Senators from both parties came to-
gether on a bipartisan basis to come up 
with something that would provide a 
little bit of support—no, a lot of sup-
port—for the economy? Let’s talk 
about the airlines. In the deal that 
came together with all the Senators 
represented in one way or another, 
where the airlines would get a loan but 
would not get free money, that is what 
Republicans, frankly, wanted. That is 
what the White House wanted. That 
was agreed to in the bipartisan ar-
rangement before it got blown up by 
the Speaker of the House and the Sen-
ate majority leader. 
Do you know what I am going to be 
curious to see? I am going to be curious 
to see if the airlines get free money— 
not just a loan to bridge over the rough 
spots to keep people employed—the at-
tendants, the pilots, the administra-
tors, the ground crews, et cetera—but 
free money, and then I will understand 
opposite day. I will understand that 
the reason people have been talking 
about corporate bailouts is because 
they have particular industries which 
they wish to bailout. 
And those who speak of no trans-
parency—again, opposite day—now we 
are into the four corners situation, 
where no one knows what is being put 
into that package because 98 Senators 
have been excluded. 
By the way, let me just compliment 
my Senate majority leader. He is the 
one who proposed the transparent proc-
ess of a bipartisan set of Senators put-
ting this together. So let’s just drop 
blame where blame should be. 
As my Democratic colleague said on 
TV, it was going pretty well until it 
came to leadership. 
We will see that bill. We will vote on 
it after not having time to read it be-
cause it has been crafted in a small 
room with people who did not include 
Senators of both parties from different 
places because they had something 
they wished to put in there, and we will 
find out later what those stakeholders 
were able to get. 
My stakeholders are the American 
people. My stakeholders are the ones 
who are boarding up their buildings 
right now because a bill we could have 
voted on Sunday is still not decided 
upon because somebody has a special 
deal which they wish to place. 
The way the Senate works is not a 
four corners arrangement, where all 
the powers are in a group of one or two 
or three or four, in which deals are re-
leased the night before, released the 
next day, and no one has a chance to 
read, but some people are taken care 
of. Rather, it is to be as the Senate ma-
jority leader put up, where there is bi-
partisan agreement with an oppor-
tunity to study, to understand, to re-
flect upon, the American people are 
represented, and special interests are 
kept in their place. That is the way it 
should be. Unfortunately, that is not 
where we are now. I wish it were not 
opposite day, but we shall find out. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
NATIONAL AG DAY 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
last week, the U.S. Department of 
Homeland Security recognized agri-
culture for its critical role in the 
United States’ COVID–19 response. 
Today, in recognition of National Ag 
Day, I want to highlight the work that 
millions of Americans do each day to 
make 
the 
agriculture 
industry 
in 
America the greatest in the world. 
This industry is incredibly expansive, 
and at its most basic level, it is defined 
by the food, feed, fiber, and fuel it gen-
erates. But it is so much more. It fuels 
the global economy and is driven by 
millions 
of 
dedicated 
hard-working 
people who are working every day to 
deliver these products. 
These folks are our Nation’s farmers, 
ranchers, foresters, and producers. This 
includes those who manufacture and 
sell equipment, who drive trucks and 
barges to move products, who provide 
seed and fertilizer, and who store, proc-
ess, and market these products. 
It spans small and large businesses, 
from 
family 
farms 
to 
community 
banks, to universities, to science, vet-
erinarians, and livestock operations. 
In my home State of Georgia, agri-
culture is our No. 1 industry. It ac-
counts for more than 1 in 7 jobs, and we 
have 42,000 farms in Georgia. 
I grew up working in the soybean 
fields and the feedlot of my family’s 
farm. I know firsthand how hard those 
in agriculture work to provide poultry, 
peanuts, pecans, cotton, cattle, and 
blueberries. The risks they take each

S2003 
March 24, 2020 
day and the exposure with global mar-
kets and changing regulations, tech-
nology, consumer pressures, and eco-
nomic pressures—our ag industry rises 
to all of these challenges. 
This is especially true right now as 
our country faces the coronavirus out-
break. We have all seen how vital each 
role in our supply chain is, from the 
ground to the grocery store, and from 
the cotton gin to the global export 
market that the Savannah Harbor 
ships to around the world. 
Americans are used to a readily 
available supply of food, but in recent 
weeks, we have seen empty aisles in 
grocery stores. But we know that this 
is not the new normal. These shelves 
are quickly restocked because of the 
tireless work that is done each day by 
our farmers, food processors, truck-
drivers, and grocery store personnel. 
Without them, empty shelves and food 
shortages would be the norm. 
Today, Americans are heeding the 
call to protect themselves from the 
coronavirus. At the same time, agri-
business is continually managing their 
production, processing, and manufac-
turing. It is not just planting and har-
vest. 
While some businesses are being 
forced to take measures to slow their 
operations, sadly, such as restaurants, 
others, such as grocery stores, are see-
ing unprecedented demand. Everyone is 
dealing with uncertainty and vola-
tility. 
In Georgia, fruits and vegetables are 
being planted as I speak. Cotton and 
peanuts will be planted very soon. 
Some products, like Georgia’s Vidalia 
onions, will be harvested in the next 
month. 
As we recover from the crisis in the 
months to come, farmers will still be in 
their fields, working tirelessly to en-
sure that Americans have access to the 
food and the products they need. 
As a member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and 
Forestry, I am strongly committed to 
supporting America’s leading role in 
agriculture. 
I want to thank President Trump for 
his strong support of American agri-
culture and for recognizing the con-
tributions of the American Farm Bu-
reau, the FFA, 4–H, and so many oth-
ers. 
Last week, my colleague from Geor-
gia, Senator DAVID PERDUE, and I urged 
the administration to support our 
farmers by enabling flexibility for the 
labor that they rely on for their har-
vest and planting. 
As the third coronavirus relief bill 
comes to the floor, we worked to sup-
port rural America by expanding tele-
health, 
as 
well 
as 
funding 
rural 
healthcare programs that are so needed 
in our rural communities. This comes 
in the form of economic aid for agri-
business and farmers, whether through 
small business loans or other facilities, 
and 
to 
support 
things 
like 
tele-
communications and broadband. 
Agriculture is perhaps the world’s 
most important industry, and it is im-
portant to mark their contributions 
every year. But on this year’s National 
Ag Day, I call on my colleagues to re-
flect on where our country would be 
today without the contribution of the 
American 
agriculture 
industry 
and 
without the contribution of Georgia’s 
farmers. Especially as we face this un-
precedented challenge, we couldn’t do 
it without those who feed and clothe 
the world. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
ROUNDS). The Senator from South 
Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to enter into a col-
loquy with my good friend Senator 
DAINES from Montana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. GRAHAM. He is on the way. 
Here is the state of play, folks. If you 
are at home and you are a nurse or you 
are a doctor and you are running out of 
supplies, there is a lot of money in this 
bill that will help you. We just need to 
pass the damn bill. 
What is going on here? Endless nego-
tiations. 
Mr. President, in case you are watch-
ing, tell Steven Mnuchin to come back 
to the White House and end negotia-
tions. 
I am all for negotiating. I try to 
make deals. I understand the give-and- 
take of life and the give-and-take of 
politics, but I have been called by two 
good friends on the Democratic side in 
the last 5 or 6 hours wanting more 
money. 
End the negotiations. This bill is $2 
trillion. There is a ton of money in this 
bill for people who need it. But what 
we are doing now is every special inter-
est group in town is trying to get a lit-
tle bit more—nickel-and diming—at a 
time when people are dying—literally 
dying. Businesses are having to make a 
decision: Do I send my employees on 
unemployment or do I hope that Con-
gress can act so that I can keep them 
on the payroll? 
I tried to do my part in terms of bi-
partisanship, but this is ridiculous. 
Steven Mnuchin has done a good job. I 
appreciate his efforts to negotiate a 
bill that will help America. 
Senator MCCONNELL says we are on 
the 2-yard line. I believe it. The prob-
lem is that there are 20 people playing 
defense, and we need to take some peo-
ple off the field. What bothers me is 
that at this late hour, I am still get-
ting calls from people wanting more 
money. 
This is not the last bill we will do, 
but this is the last chance we have to 
save some lives in realtime. I am en-
couraging the President—begging the 
President—to end negotiations now. 
Write what we have done, and let’s 
vote. If it is not perfect, we will try to 
fix it later, but it is damn good. 
There is money in here to help people 
in small business who have had to close 
because 
they 
have 
no 
customers. 
Maybe we can change the containment 
policies, but it needs to be based on 
science. 
States now are sheltering in place. 
Anything the President does to try to 
open up the economy, count me in if it 
is based on sound science. It needs to 
be conditions-based. I want to leave Af-
ghanistan like everybody else, but it 
has to be conditions-based. 
I think we are a long way from beat-
ing this disease. I want to bomb it; I 
want to starve it; and I want to kill it. 
But right now, I want to get money, 
paychecks up and running that have 
been shut down—no fault of your own. 
If you own a bar or a restaurant in 
Arizona or South Carolina, if we can 
pass this bill, you can go to a bank, a 
credit union, and you can borrow 
money, which we will forgive. It will 
not be a loan. It will be a grant for 
your employees, up to $80,000 per em-
ployee. You can borrow money, which 
will become a grant to pay the rent. We 
just need to pass the bill. 
If you are on unemployment in South 
Carolina, the most you can get is $326 
a week. We add $600 to that—if we can 
pass this bill. 
To the hospitals on the frontline, 
there is a ton of money to help you 
with supply shortages on the medical 
side. To the nurses and doctors, there 
is money there for you. Elective sur-
gery has been banned in some States. 
We need to help hospitals which are 
losing revenue. It is all in the bill. 
If you have student loan debt, we 
defer all payments, I think, until Octo-
ber. I can’t remember. It is in there. 
That is good for you. It takes one rock 
out of your sack that you have to 
carry. It relieves your burden. 
Pass the damn bill. Stop negotiating. 
Enough is enough. This has been going 
on for 2 days. Like everybody else in 
the country, I have lost my patience 
with the political process. We are being 
nickel-and-dimed now. The big stuff we 
have pretty well right. If it is not per-
fect, we can fix it later, but we need to 
vote tonight. 
The reason I am on the floor is be-
cause I have been called by two Demo-
cratic colleagues in the last 5 or 6 
hours wanting more money. The store 
is closed. 
Mr. President, end negotiations. Re-
quire us to vote. Draft the bill. Do it 
tonight. 
There is $10 billion in this bill—a $2 
trillion bill—that may do more good 
than any $10 billion in the bill in terms 
of defeating the coronavirus. Every-
body says we are at war. 
Senator DAINES, do you agree we are 
at war with this virus? 
Mr. DAINES. We are at war. 
Mr. GRAHAM. How do you win a 
war? I want to starve the virus, starve 
the enemy. If we will practice good 
containment policy and stop going to 
the beaches and interacting with each 
other in an irresponsible way, we will 
starve the virus because it needs 
human transmission to survive. Con-
tainment policies well-practiced will 
starve the virus. Therapies, bomb the

virus. The anti-malaria drugs—I hope 
they work, but therapies are in the 
pipeline that can take the virus from a 
10 to a 1 or 2 so it is not so fatal. Bomb-
ing the virus is therapeutic drugs that 
lessen the mortality rates. Killing it is 
a vaccine or an antibody that will get 
to the underlying problem. 
Senator DAINES has been a one-man 
band to try to accelerate the ability to 
produce a virus that is the nuclear 
bomb to kill this damn thing. 
We have $10 billion in this bill— 
thanks to Senator DAINES—that will 
tell the drug companies that are in the 
business of creating vaccines and anti-
bodies: Do your trials. But if there is 
any promise, start production, and we 
will cover you. If it is a dry hole, we 
will pay the cost; but if we strike oil, 
we will all benefit. 
That $10 billion is going to allow 
drug companies that are in the virus- 
destruction business, creating vaccines 
and antibodies, money to start produc-
tion of anything that is promising—a 
dual system. 
Here is when we turn the corner: 
When infections go down, not up; when 
therapies begin to degrade the virus; 
and when a vaccine is on the horizon. 
That is when we have turned the cor-
ner. The money in this bill will accel-
erate turning the corner. 
I want to thank Senator DAINES and 
my good friend from South Dakota pre-
siding, who has been a Governor, who 
understands give-and-take, getting to 
yes. Nobody does a better job of getting 
to yes than our Presiding Officer. Both 
of you come from the part of the 
world—the Big Sky Country—where 
you have to live off the land, where 
neighbor helps neighbor. We need that 
attitude in this body. The store needs 
to close. 
Mr. 
President, 
end 
negotiations, 
write the bill, and let’s vote. 
The reason we need to vote is because 
people 
are 
suffering 
and 
literally 
dying. 
Senator DAINES, can you tell me 
what it is like in Montana right now? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. DAINES. Senator GRAHAM, thank 
you for joining me here tonight. 
I wish the C–SPAN camera, for a mo-
ment, could pan this Chamber. It is 
empty. There are three Senators in 
this 
Chamber 
right 
now. 
Senator 
ROUNDS is the Presiding Officer from 
South Dakota. He has to be here be-
cause he is the Presiding Officer. Sen-
ator GRAHAM is here, from South Caro-
lina, and I am here. 
Senator GRAHAM, this Chamber is 
empty tonight. We should be here, at 
this moment, voting. 
Our phones are ringing off the hook. 
Twenty-three hours ago—in fact, I was 
presiding—we were told that we were 
at the 1-yard line. The minority leader 
came down here and said: We are at the 
1-yard line, and we are going to have 
discussions all night—— 
Mr. GRAHAM. Would you yield for a 
question? 
Mr. DAINES. I will. 
Mr. 
GRAHAM. 
Have 
you 
gotten 
phone 
calls 
from 
Democratic 
col-
leagues wanting more money? 
Mr. DAINES. I have. 
Mr. GRAHAM. That makes it appear 
to me that negotiations are not on the 
1-yard line. 
Mr. DAINES. We are at the 1-yard 
line, we were told last night. Negotia-
tions would go all night. Everybody 
here said it has to be a good, bipartisan 
bill. But what we have right now is an 
economic emergency on our hands. 
This is like somebody has been seri-
ously injured and called the ambu-
lance, and we are debating right now 
about what color ambulance to send, 
while the patient is dying on the side 
of the sideline. 
Listen to some of these stories I had 
just today from the people of Montana. 
There is a 60-year-old woman who pro-
vides 
cleaning 
services 
in 
Ravalli 
County, south of Missoula. It is in the 
Bitterroot. It is a beautiful part of our 
State. She said that normal business is 
almost down to nothing because folks 
are scared to let her clean their homes 
and 
businesses 
because 
of 
the 
coronavirus. To make ends meet, she 
said she is even willing to do outside 
yard work during these times. She is 
worried about becoming homeless. This 
is a real story that came from a Mon-
tanan today. 
I posted a video, Senator GRAHAM, 
about her plight and a couple of others 
I am going to share with you tonight. 
Here is a warming part of this story. 
We had Montanans hear about her situ-
ation, and they said: We are going to 
band together here and help her. We 
are going to hire her and try to make 
sure she doesn’t become homeless, 
which is her current concern. 
Listen, we were told that we were at 
the 1-yard line last night to get this 
done. All I have to say is, the Senate 
may think it is at the 1-yard line right 
now, 
but 
Montanans 
are 
getting 
sacked. In fact, our unemployment 
claims in Montana since March 17—we 
just looked it up 15 minutes ago—14,350 
Montanans have filed for unemploy-
ment in the last week. 
There was a gentleman from Kali-
spell—another story here—who said his 
business has been hit hard because of 
the coronavirus. He wrote: Help, both 
for the businesses to remain afloat and 
our team members who are being laid 
off or having reductions in work hours. 
He is worried about his employees. 
Emergency personnel in Missoula, MT, 
let us know that ambulance drivers— 
EMTs—must travel longer distances 
because the volunteer fire departments 
don’t have enough equipment or staff. 
They can’t get enough personal protec-
tive equipment. 
That is in this bill, Senator GRA-
HAM—immediate 
billions 
of 
dollars 
right now—to get more PPE to the 
frontlines. 
And he said this: Many are working 
while spouses have lost their jobs. And 
they are wondering if they will be able 
to pay their bills if there is no relief 
soon. And their family members have 
lost their jobs with the community. 
They need relief now. 
I just got this letter. This came in 
this evening. In fact, it is stamped 7:50 
p.m. 
Dear Senator DAINES: 
I am the General Manager of Fairmont Hot 
Springs Resort. 
He gave us permission to use his 
name. I am not going to read you the 
description of the plight that he is in, 
but here is the bottom line. 
I just processed 146 layoff notices, or 85 
percent of our staff. 
This is this evening. It is breaking 
the hearts of these employers to lay 
their people off. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator 
yield for a question? 
Mr. DAINES. It is breaking the 
hearts of these employees who are los-
ing their jobs while the Senate is sit-
ting here fiddling at the moment. We 
have got to come together and pass 
this bill tonight. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator 
GRAHAM. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I would like to ask a 
question. I don’t know how many em-
ployees the gentleman has, but do you 
agree with me that if you have 500 or 
less employees, you are a small busi-
ness, and under this bill, instead of lay-
ing off your employees, you can go to a 
bank or credit union and get an SBA 
loan that will eventually become a 
grant to pay your employees up to 
$80,000 per employee; you can also pay 
the rent that is coming due? Do you 
agree that is in this bill? 
Mr. DAINES. Senator GRAHAM, that 
is in this bill. 
For these small businesses, help is on 
its way. But we can’t send the help, 
Senator GRAHAM, until we pass the bill. 
Yet the good news for the general man-
ager of Fairmont Hot Springs is that, 
as the Senator just said, it will not be 
a loan but a grant that will be for-
given. In other words, he won’t have to 
pay it back as long as he keeps the 
payroll paid, the rent paid, the mort-
gage paid. That makes a lot of sense. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Hire back the people. 
Mr. DAINES. He wouldn’t have to lay 
them off today. In fact, he continues to 
write that they just canceled con-
ferences in the last week that total 
$848,000. This is a big deal in Montana. 
In fact, another small business owner 
in Montana let us know, by the way, 
about two other of our well-known 
kind of resorts—Grouse Mountain re-
sort, which is up in Whitefish, as well 
as Chico Hot Springs. In fact, Senator 
GRAHAM, in 1979, Chico Hot Springs is 
where we had our homecoming dance 
dinner for Bozeman High School. 
Mr. 
GRAHAM. 
Everybody 
knows 
that. You don’t need to tell us stuff we 
already know. 
Mr. DAINES. Listen. They are in 
trouble. They are temporarily closed. 
In fact, they just closed Yellowstone 
National Park and Glacier National 
Park today. This business owner said

S2005 
March 24, 2020 
they are currently looking at addi-
tional layoffs. They are looking at 
cashflows of nearly zero. 
OK. So, right now, we are hearing 
about the plight of Montanans who are 
losing their jobs and losing their busi-
nesses. There are 14,000-plus Montanans 
who have filed unemployment claims, 
and what is the Senate doing tonight, 
Senator GRAHAM? Look around this 
Chamber. There is nobody here. It is 
you and I. 
Mr. GRAHAM. If the Senator would 
yield for a second, all of the people who 
are negotiating are my friends. I have 
been in tough negotiations, and it is 
hard to get to yes, but we have never 
faced a problem like this since World 
War II and 9/11. This is not any time. 
This is not any bill. This is not just an-
other legislative endeavor. This is life. 
It is death. It is the difference between 
bankruptcy and having economic hope. 
It is the difference between having the 
supplies you need to save lives and not 
getting them. 
To my colleagues who are doing the 
negotiations, stop. It is over. Write the 
bill. Let’s vote. 
Every time I hear it is close, that 
means we are just a couple of hundred 
billion dollars away. The reason I am 
so agitated is not to try to be cheap— 
the bill is $2 trillion. It is that, like 
Senator DAINES, I have been called in 
the last few hours by people who are 
wanting more money for this and that. 
All of them may be very worthy 
projects, but we need to stop negoti-
ating at this very moment, write the 
bill, and vote tonight or no later than 
tomorrow. 
Senator DAINES, I have a proposition 
for you. If we cannot do that as the 
U.S. Senate, don’t you agree with me 
that we should stop getting paid? 
Now, legally, maybe we can’t stop 
our salaries, for it will take a future 
Congress to do that, but we can all vol-
untarily give up our money. I have a 
hard time with my continuing to get 
paid when we can’t solve the problem. 
We have been doing this for days now, 
and enough is enough. 
Senator DAINES, do you believe it is 
time for there to be consequences for 
the body in our failing to deliver for 
the American people? 
Mr. DAINES. Senator GRAHAM, I sup-
port the idea, if we don’t get something 
done here, that Members of Congress 
shouldn’t be paid. Again, there are con-
stitutional issues, but we can get 
around that by just saying we will do-
nate our paychecks to some important 
COVID–19 relief effort that is going on. 
We will find something. 
Here is what we get. At least here in 
the Senate tonight, we have a choice as 
to whether we want to donate our pay-
checks or not. There are 14,700 Mon-
tanans who don’t have that choice be-
cause they have lost their paychecks in 
the last 7 days. I am usually a guy who 
stays pretty calm, cool, and collected. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. 
Mr. DAINES. LINDSEY, you could 
probably testify to that. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Yes, I can. 
Mr. DAINES. This is a moment in 
which I am just bringing the frustra-
tion and the fear that I hear in the 
voices of Montanans who are asking: 
What in the world is going on back in 
Washington, DC? 
We have a package. As you can see, 
what happened today in the markets 
around the world is that there was op-
timism. Why? Because we have some-
thing here that is going to be a rescue. 
First, they called it a stimulus. Then 
they called it a recovery package. I 
think this is called a rescue package. 
We are into a rescue here—rescuing 
this economy and rescuing the jobs of 
these small business owners. We could 
spend the next 30 to 40 minutes going 
through, in detail, all of the things 
that are in this bill that are going to 
help working people in this country 
and small businesses. 
In the meantime, Senator GRAHAM, I 
agree with you. If we can’t get this 
passed, every Member of Congress 
should start donating his pay to a 
charity that is currently on the front-
line of dealing with the coronavirus 
and COVID–19. 
Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, I think the 
Senator is speaking for most Mon-
tanans. I know he is speaking for 
South Carolinians. Let’s go back to the 
14,000 people in Montana who are on 
unemployment. I don’t know what kind 
of spike that is. I have been to Mon-
tana—a great place, a lot of land, not 
that many people, hardy folks. They 
don’t want to be unemployed; they 
want to be working. I know the Sen-
ator’s people pretty well. They are 
probably pissed off that they have been 
laid off, but there is nothing we can do 
about it until we control this virus, 
and we will. 
Do you realize, Senator, that in this 
bill, every unemployed person in Mon-
tana will get $600 on top of the State 
unemployment benefit? In South Caro-
lina, the maximum benefit is $326. This 
bill will take it up $600. Doesn’t the 
Senator think that will matter to the 
people in Montana? 
Mr. DAINES. It more than doubles 
what they would otherwise receive in 
the State of Montana in unemployment 
benefits. 
By the way, this unemployment in-
surance backstop that is part of this 
rescue package is not what Montanans 
are after. They want their jobs. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Yes. 
Mr. DAINES. So their first choice is, 
Would you please help me keep my job. 
For whatever reason, if we can’t do 
that, there will be the unemployment 
insurance. I will tell you that Mon-
tanans don’t want a handout, but it is 
there if they need it because it is really 
a hand-up—a bridge—until we get this 
economy back on its regular course. 
Mr. GRAHAM. If I may, we keep 
talking about being at war. I have 
made 50-something trips to Afghani-
stan and Iraq. We are at war with a 
virus, not with radical Islam, and we 
need to destroy this virus before it de-
stroys our economy and kills thou-
sands of Americans. 
The Senator’s legislation—his pro-
posal—of $10 billion to accelerate our 
finding an antibody or a vaccine is the 
ultimate nuclear weapon, and that is 
the best $10 billion in this entire pack-
age—to kill the virus. 
Yet the people in Montana, South 
Carolina, and South Dakota are out of 
work today because of containment 
policies. We have had to make a deci-
sion to stop the spread of the virus. It 
is probably one of the most draconian 
decisions we have made since World 
War II, when we rationed goods and 
couldn’t have the lights on at night. 
Everybody says we are going to get 
through it, and they are right, but I 
want you to know it will not be easy. 
It is going to take a while until we find 
the therapies and the vaccines to kill 
this virus. Until then, we need to act in 
Congress to get help to those who need 
it. They are the people the Senator has 
just described—the business owner and 
the unemployed person. There is a lot 
of help. 
You can call this bill whatever you 
would like, but the two Senators who 
are here with me tonight are from out 
West. This is the cavalry coming over 
the hill. You are under attack; you are 
under siege. If we can pass this bill, the 
cavalry will be there for your busi-
nesses, and it will be there for your 
families. 
The only way we are going to pass 
this bill, Senator DAINES, is to stop ne-
gotiations and write the bill. 
Do you agree? 
Mr. DAINES. There has been plenty 
of time to negotiate, Senator GRAHAM. 
There have been good faith negotia-
tions on both sides, and there has been 
shuttle diplomacy going on between 
both sides. There has been a lot of give 
and get. We are at a point now at 
which we need to vote, and we should 
be voting tonight. 
Regarding that $10 billion that is in 
this bill, I have been spending a lot of 
time thinking about how we get out of 
this war. 
Mr. GRAHAM. How do you kill it? 
Mr. DAINES. How do you win this 
war? 
Mr. GRAHAM. How do you kill this 
virus? 
Mr. DAINES. When you step back for 
a moment and think about the basics— 
of the panic and fear that the Amer-
ican people have with regard to this 
economy—the panic and the fear will 
not stop until the pandemic stops, and 
the pandemic will not stop until these 
great drugs start. 
Here is what we are thinking about, 
and I want to give a reason for great 
hope and optimism as to how we are 
going to get over this great hurdle that 
we face in our Nation today. We have 
some amazing vaccines in development 
as we speak. In fact, they started a 
trial in Seattle a week ago on Monday. 
They vaccinated 45 adults aged 18 to 55. 
They are getting the initial results. 
They will be looking at the safety as

March 24, 2020 
well as the efficacy—how well does it 
work?—over 
the 
course 
of 
several 
weeks. 
We have some other amazing, mir-
acle drugs. They are called monoclonal 
antibodies. That is the technical term 
for them. When you take that drug, it 
provides 
protection 
against 
the 
coronavirus so that you don’t even get 
the COVID–19 disease. 
Here is the challenge, Senator GRA-
HAM. We have to be operating on par-
allel paths right now to make sure we 
have those drugs available to the 
American people in a widespread fash-
ion before the next flu season hits this 
fall. We are seeing reports right now 
from Singapore and Hong Kong, and 
there are some reinfections going on. 
That should put us on notice. 
Assuming our containment strategy 
works and that we bend this curve, as 
we have talked about, so that we look 
more like South Korea than Italy—we 
pray for that and hope for that and are 
working to that end—the challenge 
will be our not having enough immu-
nity in our society coming up this fall. 
That will leave us vulnerable to a sec-
ond wave of this virus. 
The solution—the way we win this 
war—is to start manufacturing some of 
these drugs earlier, in parallel with the 
testing that is going on, so that, by the 
time the fall hits, we will have it avail-
able for the American people. That is 
in this bill. 
Listen, every hour that goes by in 
which we don’t pass this bill is an hour 
that is lost in this fight. We see what is 
going on. If you look at the World 
Health Organization’s numbers—we are 
calculating them on a daily basis and 
sometimes on an hourly basis—every 
hour matters right now, and every day 
matters. We have now lost 2 days this 
week. It has been incredible. 
Lindsey, it is Wednesday tomorrow. 
It is time to vote. This Chamber is 
empty. Senator GRAHAM, let’s get this 
Chamber full of Senators, and let’s 
have an up-or-down vote. Let’s get it 
done. 
Mr. GRAHAM. We will end where we 
began. The reason I am here with Sen-
ator DAINES is that I have been getting 
phone calls over the last several hours 
from people who want to add more 
money. It is not that it is a bad idea as 
much as it is we need to get this bill 
done. It will not be the last time we get 
to address this problem. It rattles me 
to no end to know that people are still 
asking for billions of dollars at 8:30 at 
night or 8 o’clock at night. That tells 
me that we haven’t sent the right sig-
nal, which is that this is a good bill. It 
is time to write it, and it is time to 
vote on it. It is time to end the nego-
tiations. 
Mr. President, you have done a very 
good job today. That news conference 
with you and Dr. Fauci was the most 
encouraging I have seen. We are going 
to listen to good science, and we are 
going to turn on the economy in a 
smart way with conditions being faced. 
You have encouraged Congress. You 
have been very nice to Congress. 
The reason we are here tonight is 
that we are both upset that people are 
still talking about adding to the bill 48 
hours after having been on the 5-yard 
line. We may be on the 1-yard line, but, 
apparently, there are 20 people on de-
fense when we need to get the ball in 
the end zone. 
I am just begging of my colleagues 
who have worked very hard—and I am 
not being critical as much as I am 
being 
insistent—because 
enough 
is 
enough. You have done a good job for 
the Democratic causes. We have done a 
good job for the Republican causes. The 
cause is the country. 
If you are out of work, we are going 
to keep you on the payroll so you don’t 
have to go on unemployment if your 
employer decides to go that route. If 
you are on unemployment, we are 
going to give you $600 more so you can 
actually survive better than you would 
have without this bill. If you are a 
nurse or a doctor and you are running 
out of supplies, this bill has a tremen-
dous supply chain in it. 
So our message is simple: No more 
negotiations. It is over. Let’s vote. 
Mr. DAINES. Senator GRAHAM, thank 
you, and we will conclude here. 
This is a moment in our history as a 
nation. Truly, we have got to come to-
gether. The American people are ask-
ing us to come together. 
Senator GRAHAM, I thought for cer-
tain we would have a vote today, and 
here we are, approaching 8:30 p.m., and 
no sign of a vote. We are going to lose 
another day while the unemployment 
claims are rising and people are get-
ting sicker. There is help on the way 
with this historic package. It is time to 
forget who is a Republican and who is 
a Democrat. The question is—these are 
100 Americans serving the U.S. Senate. 
It is time to rise above the current fra-
cas and vote. 
Mr. GRAHAM. One last thing. Who is 
the gentleman who is thinking about 
laying people off from Montana, that 
business? 
Mr. DAINES. Steve Luebeck. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Luebeck, I have 
never met you. Maybe one day I will. I 
enjoy my visits to Montana. Give us 24 
more hours. I am hoping and praying 
that we can write the bill. End the ne-
gotiations right now, write the bill, 
and vote on this thing, House and Sen-
ate, and put it on the President’s desk 
in the next 24 hours. Sir, if we can’t, we 
have let you down and everybody else 
in the country like you. 
To my Governor in South Carolina, 
you had to institute some very strong 
containment policies so we don’t be-
come New York. People in my State— 
there are 1,700 restaurants in Myrtle 
Beach, restaurants and bars. We are 
going into Easter in a few weeks, and 
that is when the season begins. 
Our Canadian friends would be com-
ing down any day now. They want to go 
swimming in March. We are glad to 
have them. We don’t like swimming in 
March because it is too cold for us, but 
the Canadians like it. It is a win-win. 
They are not coming. 
Those 1,700 restaurants and bars, in 
this bill, if we pass it, can go to a cred-
it union or a bank. You can borrow 
money to pay your employees up to 
$8,000. You can borrow money to pay 
the rent, pay yourself as the owner, 
and we will forgive it and make it a 
grant for 6 or 8 weeks. That will change 
everybody’s life all over South Caro-
lina. 
It is time to change people’s lives. It 
is time to stop negotiating. It is time 
to vote.

RECESS 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate

There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 8:32 p.m., recessed until 9:30 p.m. and 
reassembled when called to order by 
the Presiding Officer (Ms. MCSALLY). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
spoke to you earlier when you were 
presiding. 
I am about to take the Presiding Of-
ficer’s place, as she took my place ear-
lier, and we will swap once more. Yet, 
before I sit down, I want to repeat the 
message I gave earlier. 
As we wait for a decision to be made 
between the Democratic minority lead-
er, the Speaker of the House, and the 
administration, we had a deal that 
they had agreed to that was bipartisan, 
on which Senators from both parties 
had come together, had reviewed, and 
had an awareness of. No Senator 
thought it was a corporate bailout. If 
one did, one didn’t say so at the time. 
Every Senator felt like this was the 
way to emerge. This could have been 
passed into law on Sunday, but we are 
nowhere close, apparently. 
Tonight, I was asked on a TV show: 
What about the single mother in Baton 
Rouge? What would I tell her? 
Do you know what I would say to 
that single mother? I would tell her I 
care about single moms. I would say 
that we had a deal, but then the Speak-
er of the House and the Democratic mi-
nority leader decided to leverage the 
misery of the American people, the 
businesses that are shutting down as 
we speak, and the people who are being 
laid off every day, to their political ad-
vantage. I am so sorry to say that, but 
that is a fact. 
Then, afterward, they had to come up 
with a big, sort of, ‘‘Oh, my gosh. We 
can’t support it because of this or 
that.’’ It wasn’t what they were saying 
when they agreed to it. They had to 
come up with a reason to justify men-
dacity. They are leveraging the misery 
of the American people to their polit-
ical advantage. A deal could have been 
signed on Sunday—a bipartisan deal 
that 100 Senators had some input into 
and that the Speaker of the House had 
input into. 
Someone pointed out the irony to 
me—and I have to wrap up shortly—so 
I tweeted that the Democratic minor-
ity leader and the Speaker of the House

S2007 
March 24, 2020 
tried to impeach the President of the 
United States for allegedly withholding 
aid from Ukraine, and now they with-
hold aid from the American people. 
Whatever gloss they put on it, we could 
have finished this up on Sunday, and 
now we are stretching it out to their 
political advantage. 
I believe that was the allegation 
against the President: To his political 
advantage, he was using aid that was 
to go to the Ukrainians. Now we see 
two people—again, the Speaker of the 
House and the Democratic minority 
leader—both of whom are from States 
that have been hard-hit; my State of 
Louisiana and theirs, being New York 
and California, have been hard-hit— 
who are using that misery as leverage 
to their political advantage. 
I am sorry to be so worked up, but I 
have people calling me, asking: Do I 
have to lay somebody off? 
Oh, my gosh. I have lost my job. Will 
I have unemployment benefits? You 
say there is a check coming. When will 
this legislation pass? 
I realize it could have been done on 
Sunday until two people saw an oppor-
tunity that was to their political ad-
vantage. In their political advantage, 
they withhold aid from the American 
people, but they tried to impeach the 
President 
for 
such 
an 
allegation 
against another people. 
I hope they answer to the voters. I 
understand that the people who sup-
port them might not be touched by 
this, but my people are touched by it, 
and my State is affected by it. As a 
physician, I don’t care where you live 
in the country, for I feel, as a physi-
cian, that we should be doing every-
thing we can for those who are in dis-
tress right now and not using it to our 
political advantage or using it in a way 
to extract a little bit more—maybe in 
requiring airlines to do this or that or 
maybe in sneaking a sweetheart deal in 
for a friend because we will get that 
language and have to vote on it 2 hours 
later. 
This is not how our Founding Fa-
thers had imagined. It is, unfortu-
nately, how it has become—not to the 
benefit of the American people, to the 
benefit of two people, and I find that 
outrageous. 
I yield the floor.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The majority leader. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I have an update for the information of 
all the Senators and for the informa-
tion of the American people, and it is 
good news. It is good news for the doc-
tors and nurses in emergency rooms 
around the country who are waiting for 
more masks and more funding. It is 
good news for families all across Amer-
ica. At last we have a deal. 
After days of intense discussions, the 
Senate has reached a bipartisan agree-
ment on a historic relief package for 
this pandemic. It will rush new re-
sources onto the frontlines of our Na-
tion’s healthcare fight, and it will in-
ject trillions of dollars of cash into the 
economy as fast as possible to help 
American 
workers, 
families, 
small 
businesses, and industries make it 
through this disruption and emerge on 
the other side ready to soar. 
The 
bipartisan 
CARES 
Act 
will 
squarely address each of the four big 
priorities that I laid out in my legisla-
tion at the beginning of the process 
about a week ago. It will rush financial 
assistance to Americans through direct 
checks to households from the middle 
class on down and through a signifi-
cant and creative expansion of unem-
ployment insurance during this emer-
gency. 
It will deliver historic relief to Main 
Street America through hundreds of 
billions of dollars in emergency loans 
so more small businesses can survive 
this and keep paying their workers. 
It will help secure our economic 
foundations and stabilize key national 
industries to prevent as many layoffs 
as possible, while keeping big compa-
nies accountable, as both sides have 
sought to do. 
And, of course, it will push major re-
lief to hospitals and healthcare pro-
viders, invest in new medicines and 
vaccines so we can beat this virus fast-
er, and help get more equipment and 
masks to the frontline heroes who put 
themselves at risk to care for patients. 
In effect, this is a wartime level of 
investment into our Nation. The men 
and women of the greatest country on 
Earth 
are 
going 
to 
defeat 
this 
coronavirus and reclaim our future, 
and the Senate is going to make sure 
they have the ammunition they need 
to do it. 
I am thrilled that we are finally 
going to deliver for the country that 
has been waiting for us to step up. 
I am relieved that my distinguished 
Democratic colleagues are ready to 
take yes for an answer. This has been a 
long week for the Senate, but it has 
been a much longer week for the hun-
dreds of millions of Americans who find 
themselves in this strange new reality, 
where every morning brings new wor-
ries about their health, about their 
loved ones, and about whether their job 
or their small business will still exist 
at this time next week. 
So, Madam President, help is on the 
way. The American people are already 
rising to this grave challenge, and the 
Senate is about to follow suit. We are 
going to pass this legislation later 
today. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
after 5 days of arduous negotiations, 
after sleep-deprived nights, and mara-
thon negotiating sessions, we have a 
bipartisan agreement on the largest 
rescue package in American history. 
This is not a moment of celebration 
but one of necessity. We have the an-
guish of the American people, their 
wondering about the future of their 
health, the health of their loved ones, 
and the economy. It necessitates us to 
do all we can to help them and help our 
country. 
From the very beginning, the Demo-
crats have had two primary goals: a 
Marshall Plan for public health work-
ers and hospitals on the frontlines and 
of putting workers first. The agree-
ment now, after these 5 days, reflects 
those Democratic priorities, and we are 
proud that they are now part of this 
legislation. 
Like all compromises, this bill is far 
from perfect, but we believe the legis-
lation has been improved significantly 
to warrant its quick consideration and 
passage. Because many Democrats and 
Republicans were willing to do the seri-
ous and hard work, the bill is much 
better off than where it started. The 
Democrats have succeeded in making 
the bill substantially better on many 
counts. 
Here are four major pillars of the 
bill. 
First, a Marshall Plan for our hos-
pitals and medical needs—there is 
much more money for our hospitals, 
for our nurses and physicians, for our 
nursing homes and our community 
health centers to do the jobs they need 
to do, over $130 billion. 
Second, workers first—so many peo-
ple are being put out of work through 
no fault of their own. They don’t know 
what their futures are going to be like. 
How are they going to pay the bills? 
Well, we come to their rescue, and the 
most significant part of that is some-
thing we are proud to have devised. We 
call it unemployment compensation on 
steroids. All American workers who are 
laid off will have their salaries remu-
nerated by the Federal Government so 
they can pay their bills. Because so 
many of them will be furloughed rather 
than fired, if they have benefits, they 
will continue, and—extremely impor-
tant—they stay with the company or 
small business. That means that com-
pany or small business can reassemble 
once this awful plague is over, and our 
economy can get going quickly. 
Third, strict oversight, transparency, 
and accountability of all loans made to 
corporate America—we need oversight. 
We need transparency. Every loan doc-
ument will be public and be made 
available to Congress very quickly so 
we can see where the money is going, 
what the terms are, and if it is fair to 
the American people. There will be an 
oversight board, as well as an IG, to 
make sure things are done on the level. 
Fourth, real resources for our State 
and local governments—that was one 
of the last decisions we had to make. 
There is $150 billion that will go to 
States and localities that are so hard- 
pressed because of all the new expenses 
that COVID–19 puts upon them, and be-
cause they are not getting the re-
sources they usually get, taxes will be 
delayed until June. 
Finally, there is real, real help for 
small businesses. My dad was a small

businessman, an exterminator. I know 
how small business people worry and 
suffer. They will get loans, and their 
employees will be paid by the Federal 
Government while they are closed be-
cause they don’t have customers or 
services, and they can, too, bounce 
back afterward. So this agreement is 
really an outstanding agreement. 
To them and to all Americans, I say 
help is on the way, big help and quick 
help. We are going to take up and pass 
this package to care for those who are 
now caring for us and help carry mil-
lions of Americans through these dark 
economic times. 
I yield the floor.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. GRASSLEY: 
S. 3578. A bill to provide oversight for 
the care and assistance provided to 
businesses under the coronavirus relief 
package; to the Committee on Home-
land Security and Governmental Af-
fairs. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
Mr. 
GRASSLEY. 
Mr. 
President, 
today I am introducing legislation in 
response to the coronavirus outbreak. I 
submitted this proposal to Senate 
Leadership earlier this week. It is my 
expectation that the language I’ve de-
veloped will be included, in some form, 
in the final agreement we’re negoti-
ating. The legislation is designed to re-
move a stumbling block to enactment 
of a third coronavirus relief package. 
Specifically, the proposal I’ve devel-
oped responds directly to the con-
cerns—voiced by some of my colleagues 
in recent days—that we should add ac-
countability provisions to the relief 
package now under consideration by 
this chamber. It’s my understanding 
that the Senate leaders are seriously 
considering including this or very simi-
lar language in their compromise. I ap-
plaud them for their efforts and strong-
ly urge my colleagues’ support for 
these sensible provisions. 
My proposal would impose strict con-
gressional oversight over the Treasury 
Department fund that is tasked with 
extending lending and other assistance 
to air carriers and American companies 
that 
have 
been 
hard 
hit 
by 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. It mirrors close-
ly the language that this chamber 
adopted in 2008, during consideration of 
the Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
For example, this bill, like that 2008 
statute, calls for the creation of a spe-
cial 
inspector 
general 
for 
the 
coronavirus relief program and would 
authorize $50 million for this purpose. 
The special inspector general would be 
appointed by the President and con-
firmed by the Senate. As stated in the 
bill, this appointment must be made 
‘‘on the basis of integrity and dem-
onstrated ability in accounting, audit-
ing, financial analysis, law, manage-
ment analysis, public administration, 
or investigations.’’ 
The bill I’ve developed also calls for 
creation 
of 
a 
bipartisan 
oversight 
board, comprised of five high ranking 
executive branch officials. This board 
would meet every two weeks to review 
the activities of the Exchange Sta-
bilization Fund, a Treasury Depart-
ment vehicle through which hundreds 
of billions of dollars in loan assistance 
would flow to distressed sectors of the 
United States economy. This oversight 
board would have to report suspected 
fraud or malfeasance to the special in-
spector general that this legislation 
creates. Again, it is very similar to a 
board that Congress established in 2008, 
during another National crisis. 
In addition, my proposal calls for the 
head of the Office of Management and 
Budget to issue regulations to mini-
mize conflicts of interest that may 
arise in coronavirus relief activities. It 
also imposes limits on executive com-
pensation to senior officers of compa-
nies that accept lending assistance 
through the Treasury Department’s 
Exchange Stabilization Fund. 
The bill also calls for greater over-
sight and audits by the Government 
Accountability Office, a nonpartisan 
watchdog agency of Congress. Specifi-
cally, GAO is tasked with ongoing 
oversight, including conducting audits 
of the programs and financial trans-
actions of Federal agencies that extend 
financial assistance to private compa-
nies in response to the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
The bill also creates a bicameral, bi-
partisan Congressional Oversight Panel 
within the legislative branch. This 
panel would be comprised of five mem-
bers of the House of Representatives 
and Senate, appointed by the other 
chamber’s Speaker and the Senate 
Leader. This oversight panel would re-
view the state of the financial markets 
and submit regular reports on certain 
topics, such as Federal officials’ use of 
coronavirus relief authority and the 
impact of Federal assistance on the fi-
nancial markets, air carriers, and med-
ical providers. This congressional panel 
would have the ability to convene hear-
ings, call witnesses, take testimony, 
hire staff, get official data, and meet 
regularly. The panel, like many of the 
programs established under this bill, 
would terminate after this emergency 
ends. 
Mr. President, my office has ap-
proached multiple colleagues, includ-
ing those on the other side of the aisle, 
about these provisions. We’ve received 
encouraging comments from many. I 
believe this language could be accepted 
and urge that it be included in the final 
relief package, so that we can remove 
one of the remaining obstacles to mov-
ing forward.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2010 
March 24, 2020 
SEC. 4. COVID–19 RELIEF OVERSIGHT BOARD 
Creates a COVID–19 Relief Oversight Board 
(‘‘Oversight Board’’), comprised of executive 
branch officials, which is responsible for re-
viewing the exercise of authority under the 
COVID–19 Relief Program that relates to 
policies implemented to— 
increase loan forgiveness, loan eligibility, 
and loan deferment of eligible small busi-
nesses under section 7(a) of the Small Busi-
ness Act (15 U.S.C. 6636(a); 
extend grants or other forms of financial 
assistance to business concerns in response 
to the outbreak of COVID–19; 
make resources available, through the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs, to hos-
pitals and long-term care facilities for the 
elderly in response to the COVID–19 out-
break; 
extend emergency relief to distressed sec-
tors of the United States economy through 
the Treasury Department’s Exchange Sta-
bilization Fund. 
Tasks the Oversight Board with reviewing 
the effect of such policies and initiatives on 
the supply chain and the economy and with 
making recommendations, as appropriate, to 
designated executive branch officials. Speci-
fies that this Board also shall have the au-
thority to ensure that the policies imple-
mented through the Treasury Department’s 
Exchange Stabilization Fund are— 
in accordance with the purposes of this 
Act; 
in the economic interests of the United 
States; and 
consistent with protecting taxpayers’ in-
terests. 
Clarifies that Oversight Board may appoint 
a credit review committee for the purpose of 
evaluating the exercise of the authority pro-
vided under the COVID–19 Relief Program. 
Also calls for the Oversight Board to report 
any suspected fraud, misrepresentation, or 
malfeasance to the Special Inspector General 
for the COVID–19 Relief Program (created 
under this Act) or the Attorney General of 
the United States. 
Calls for the Oversight Board to meet 
every two weeks, report to Congress at least 
quarterly, and include in its membership the 
following: (1) the Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration; (2) the Secretary of 
the Treasury; (3) the Secretary of Transpor-
tation; (3) the Secretary of Commerce; (4) 
the Secretary of Health and Human Services; 
and (5) the Administrator of the Federal 
Emergency 
Management 
Administration. 
Calls for the chair to be elected by members 
of the board from among the board members 
(other than the Administrator of the Small 
Business Administration and the Secretary 
of the Treasury). 
Specifies that the Oversight Board’s role 
comes to an end after the expiration of the 
national emergency declared by the Presi-
dent with respect to the COVID–19 or after 
the Exchange Stabilization Fund ceases to 
make loans, loan guarantees, and investment 
or other assistance to air carriers and other 
key businesses affected by COVID–19. 
SEC. 5. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
Calls for Director of the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget (‘‘OMB’’) to issue any regu-
lations or guidelines necessary to address 
and manage, or to prohibit, conflicts of in-
terest that may arise in connection with the 
administration and execution of the authori-
ties provided under the COVID–19 Relief Pro-
gram. Deadline for their issuance is ‘‘as soon 
as practicable after the date of enactment’’

loans, loan guarantees, grants, or other as-
sistance through the Exchange Stabilization 
Fund shall be subject to executive compensa-
tion requirements in the Act and the provi-
sions under the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986, as applicable. Bars entities receiving 
this COVID–19 relief from providing incen-
tives for senior executive officers of a pri-
vate entity to take unnecessary and exces-
sive risks that threaten the value of such en-
tity. Also bars the entity from making any 
bonus, incentive compensation or golden 
parachute payment to a senior executive of-
ficer during the period in which such private 
entity receives Federal assistance through 
the Exchange Stabilization Fund. Defines 
the term ‘‘senior executive officer’’ as an in-
dividual who is one of the top 5 highly paid 
executives of a public or private corporation 
or limited liability company.

ceived Federal assistance in response to the 
COVID–19 outbreak. 
SEC. 7. OVERSIGHT AND AUDITS

programs, activities, receipts, expenditures, 
and financial transactions of Federal enti-
ties involved in extending authority or as-
sistance to private entities in response to 
the COVID–19 outbreak. Federal agencies or 
departments subject to such audits must 
take action to address deficiencies identified 
in the audits, as appropriate or certify to ap-
propriate committees of Congress that no ac-
tion is necessary or appropriate. Specifies 
circumstances for termination of GAO’s 
oversight authority after the national emer-
gency ends or the coronavirus relief activi-
ties cease.

lief programs established in response to the 
COVID–19 outbreak.’’ Clarifies that, in addi-
tion to the duties specified in this Act, the

responsibilities of inspectors general under 
the Inspector General Act of 1978. 
Requires that the Special OIG report to

ate confirmation, and every calendar quarter 
thereafter, on activities. Each report must 
include, for the period covered by such re-
port, a detailed statement of all purchases,

ize the public disclosure of information that 
is— 
specifically prohibited from disclosure by 
any other provision of law; 
specifically required by Executive order to 
be protected from disclosure in the interest 
of national defense or national security or in

ommendations for improvement. 
Sets the rate of pay and travel expenses of 
each member of the Oversight Panel, author-

Whereas, on January 1, the Hubei provin-
cial health commission ordered laboratories

samples of the same; 
Whereas, on January 2, the Wuhan Insti-
tute of Virology mapped the genome of 
COVID–19 in order to inform development of 
public health interventions and medical 
treatments for COVID–19, but the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China with-
held genetic information on COVID–19 until 
January 9; 
Whereas, on January 11, the Wuhan munic-
ipal health commission insisted that there 
were no new cases of infection by COVID–19; 
Whereas, on January 13, the first COVID–19 
case outside of the People’s Republic of 
China was announced in Thailand; 
Whereas, on January 14, the World Health

seen ‘‘no clear evidence of human-to-human 
transmission of the novel coronavirus’’; 
Whereas, on January 23, the Government of

(1) condemns the decision by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China to 
hide the emergence and spread of COVID–19 
within its borders during the initial weeks of 
the outbreak; 
(2) assesses that the decision by the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China to

uted to the rapid spread of that disease 
throughout the Indo-Pacific region, Europe,

al pandemic; and

strain of coronavirus; 
Whereas Dr. Yu Wenbin and a team of re-
searchers from Xishuangbanna Tropical Bo-
tanical Garden reported that the Huanan

uted to the spread of COVID–19 throughout 
the city of Wuhan; 
Whereas, after being informed of cases of a 
dangerous new strain of coronavirus con-
centrated around the Huanan Seafood Whole-
sale Market in Wuhan, the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China waited 5 days 
to shut down the market; 
Whereas Zhou Xianwang, the mayor of

the Hubei Provincial Health Commission or-
dered at least 1 private genomics testing 
company to cease testing samples of a 
SARS-like virus from Wuhan and to destroy 
all existing samples of the virus; 
Whereas, on January 3, 2020, the Public Se-
curity Bureau of Wuhan detained, ques-
tioned, and forced Dr. Li Wenliang and 7 
other doctors to sign a letter confessing that 
Wenliang had made ‘‘false comments’’ that 
‘‘severely disturbed the social order’’; 
Whereas, on January 3, 2020, the leading 
public health authority in China, the Na-
tional Health Commission, directed all re-
search institutions in China to cease pub-
licly publishing any information related to a 
then unknown SARS-like virus and ordered 
them to destroy existing samples of the virus 
or transfer them to approved testing sites; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention first asked permission to 
study COVID–19 in China on January 6, 2020, 
but was barred by the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China from entering the 
country until mid-February; 
Whereas authorities of the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China first publicly 
confirmed the existence of COVID–19 on Jan-
uary 9, 2020, 14 days after the presence of a 
novel strain of coronavirus was internally 
confirmed; 
Whereas the National Health Commission 
of China publicly denied that COVID–19 was 
transmissible through person-to-person con-

ber and having been alerted of the trans-
missibility of COVID–19 on January 1, 2020; 
Whereas, on January 18, 2020, more than

ganized and sponsored by the Wuhan city

month after the virus was internally con-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2015 
March 24, 2020 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention, the premier infectious dis-
ease research institution in the world, was 
well situated at the beginning of the COVID– 
19 outbreak to both assist the response of the 
people and Government of the People’s Re-
public of China and prepare the people and 
Government of the United States to handle 
the virus in the case of international spread; 
Whereas the National Health Commission 
of China failed to include individuals who 
tested positive for COVID–19 but remained 
asymptomatic in its daily tally of confirmed 
COVID–19 cases, hampering the ability of 
public health authorities in the United 
States to accurately account for the rate of 
spread and the health risks of the virus; 
Whereas a Foreign Ministry Spokesman of 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China, Zhao Lijian, claimed that COVID–19 
originated in the United States and that the 
United States Army brought COVID–19 to 
Wuhan to wage biological warfare on China; 
Whereas other officials of the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China, including 
scientists working on the COVID-19 response 
of China, the Ambassador to South Africa of 
China, and the Ambassador to Australia of 
China, have claimed that there is no evi-
dence that COVID–19 originated in China; 
Whereas, on March 4, 2020, Xinhua News 
Agency, an official mouthpiece of the Gov-
ernment of the People’s Republic of China, 
published an article threatening to cut off 
medical supply exports to the United States 
and ‘‘plunge [the United States] into the 
mighty sea of coronavirus’’; 
Whereas, on March 17, 2020, the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China ex-
pelled nationals of the United States work-
ing at the Wall Street Journal, the Wash-
ington Post, and the New York Times, reduc-
ing the spread of reliable information on the 
COVID–19 outbreak in China; and 
Whereas a study by the University of 
Southampton found that if the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China had taken 
action 3 weeks earlier, the spread of COVID– 
19 would be reduced by 95 percent globally: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) calls on the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China to— 
(A) publicly state that there is no evidence 
that COVID–19 originated anywhere else but 
China; 
(B) denounce the baseless conspiracy that 
the United States Army placed COVID–19 in 
Wuhan; 
(C) revoke the expulsion of journalists of 
the United States; 
(D) end the detainment of Uyghur Muslims 
and other persecuted ethnic minorities; and 
(E) end all forced labor programs; 
(2) condemns— 
(A) the censorship of the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China of doctors and 
journalists during the early days of the 
COVID–19 outbreak, particularly the treat-
ment of the deceased Dr. Li Wenliang; 
(B) the refusal of the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China to allow sci-
entists from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention to assist its response to 
COVID–19 for more than a month after co-
operation was offered, needlessly endan-
gering the lives of its own citizens and ham-
pering the early attempts of the United 
States to learn more about COVID–19; and 
(C) the duplicitous denial of the National 
Health Commission of China of the person- 
to-person transmissibility of COVID–19; and 
(3) calls for the Director-General of the 
World 
Health 
Organization, 
Dr. 
Tedros 
Adhanom Ghebreyesus, to retract highly 
misleading statements of support for the re-
sponse of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China to COVID–19, especially his 
praise for the ‘‘commitment from top leader-
ship [of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China], and the transparency they 
have demonstrated’’.

mines that, based on a repayment schedule 
that would provide for repayment of the full

plan will be able to repay without becoming 
within 18 months of insolvency.

such Code— 
(i) the suspension of benefits shall not be 
taken into account in applying subparagraph 
(A); and 
(ii) except as provided in subparagraph (B), 
the loan amount shall be the amount suffi-
cient to provide benefits of participants and 
beneficiaries of the plan in pay status and

1974 (29 U.S.C. 1431) is amended by adding at 
the end the following new subsection: 
‘‘(d)(1) The plan sponsor of a multiem-
ployer plan— 
‘‘(A) which is in critical and declining sta-
tus (within the meaning of section 305(b)(6)) 
as of the date of the enactment of this sub-
section, or with respect to which a suspen-
sion of benefits has been approved under sec-
tion 305(e)(9) as of such date; 
‘‘(B) which, as of such date of enactment, 
is in critical status (within the meaning of 
section 305(b)(2)), has a funded percentage of 
less than 40 percent (as determined for pur-
poses of section 305), and has a ratio of active 
to inactive participants which is less than 2 
to 3; or 
‘‘(C) which is insolvent for purposes of sec-
tion 418E of the Internal Revenue Code of 
1986 as of such date of enactment, if the plan 
became insolvent after December 16, 2014, 
and has not been terminated, 
and which is applying for a loan under the 
Butch Lewis Act of 2020 may also apply to 
the corporation for financial assistance 
under this subsection, by jointly submitting 
such applications in accordance with the 
rules of such Act. The application for finan-
cial assistance under this subsection shall 
demonstrate, based on projections by the 
plan actuary, that after the receipt of the 
anticipated loan amount under such Act, the 
plan will still become (or remain) insolvent 
within the 30-year period beginning on the 
date of the loan. 
‘‘(2) In reviewing an application under 
paragraph (1), the corporation shall review 
the demonstrations and assumptions sub-
mitted with the loan application under the 
Butch Lewis Act of 2020 and provide guidance 
regarding such assumptions prior to approv-
ing any application for financial assistance 
under this subsection. The corporation may 
deny any application if the assumptions and 
determinations are unreasonable, or incon-
sistent with rules issued by the corporation, 
and the plan and the corporation are unable 
to reach agreement on such assumptions and 
determinations. 
‘‘(3) In the case of a plan described in para-
graph (1)(A) or (1)(B), the financial assist-
ance provided pursuant to such application 
under this subsection shall be the amount 
(determined by the plan actuary and sub-
mitted on the application) equal to the sum 
of— 
‘‘(A) the percentage of benefits of partici-
pants and beneficiaries of the plan in pay 
status at the time of the application; and 
‘‘(B) the percentage of future benefits to 
which participants who have separated from 
service but are not yet in pay status are en-
titled, 
which, if such percentage were paid by the 
corporation in combination with the loan, 
would allow the plan to avoid projected in-
solvency. Such amount shall not exceed the 
maximum guaranteed benefit with respect to 
all participants and beneficiaries of the plan 
under sections 4022A and 4022B. For this pur-
pose, 
the 
maximum 
guaranteed 
benefit 
amount shall be determined by disregarding 
any loan available from the Pension Reha-
bilitation Administration and shall be deter-
mined as if the plan were insolvent on the

graph (1)(C), the financial assistance pro-
vided pursuant to such application under 
this subsection shall be the amount (deter-
mined by the plan actuary and submitted on 
the application) which, if such amount were 
paid by the corporation in combination with 
the loan and any other assistance being pro-
vided to the plan by the corporation at the 
time of the application, would enable the 
plan to emerge from the projected insol-
vency. 
‘‘(5)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph 
(B), the corporation shall provide the finan-
cial assistance under this subsection only in 
such amounts as the corporation determines, 
at the time of approval and at the beginning 
of each plan year beginning thereafter dur-
ing the period of assistance, are necessary 
for the plan to avoid insolvency during the 5 
plan year period beginning with the current 
plan year. 
‘‘(B) In the case of a plan described in para-
graph (1)(C), the financial assistance under 
this subsection shall be provided in a lump 
sum if deemed necessary by the corporation, 
and in no case later than December 31, 2020. 
‘‘(6) Subsections (b) and (c) shall apply to 
financial assistance under this subsection as 
if it were provided under subsection (a), ex-
cept that the terms for repayment under 
subsection (b)(2) shall not require the finan-
cial assistance to be repaid before the date 
on which the loan under the Butch Lewis Act 
of 2020 is repaid in full. 
‘‘(7) The corporation may forgo repayment 
of the financial assistance provided under 
this subsection if necessary to avoid any sus-
pension of the accrued benefits of partici-
pants.’’.
