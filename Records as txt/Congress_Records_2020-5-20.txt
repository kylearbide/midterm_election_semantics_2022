The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Heavenly Father, today, restore in 
our lawmakers faith in the ultimate 
triumph of Your plan for our Nation 
and world. Help them to realize that 
the power of Your providence will en-
able them to navigate every challenge

imagine. 
Lord, in spite of difficulties, dis-
appointments, and despair, reassure 
them that You are still in control. Re-
mind us all that in everything You are 
working for the good of those who love 
You, who are called according to Your

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mrs. 
LOEFFLER). The Senator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 
minute in morning business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNIZING THE DAILY IOWAN 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Journalists, as we 
all know, serve as the watchdog for ac-
countability, particularly to keep gov-
ernment responsible. These journalists 
inform and investigate issues impor-
tant to their readers, from human in-
terests to public interests. Right now, 
a lot of focus is upon the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
The University of Iowa’s independent 
newspaper, the Daily Iowan, has been 
named the ‘‘Best All-Around Daily Stu-
dent Newspaper’’ by the Society of Pro-
fessional Journalists. This prestigious 
honor follows its recognition as the 
2020 ‘‘Newspaper of the Year’’ by the 
Iowa Newspaper Association. 
I come to the floor to commend the 
team of collegiate journalists in the 
student-run newsroom at the Daily 
Iowan. These awards show that the 
staff’s hard work and commitment to 
their craft rise above the rest. 
You are the cream of the crop. Con-
gratulations and keep up the good 
work. 
I yield the floor.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader is recognized.

BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
week after week, this Capitol has been 
a study in contrasts. Call it the tale of 
two Chambers. Over here in the Senate, 
the lights are on, the doors are open, 
and we are working for the American 
people. All month, we have been in ses-
sion, passing national security legisla-
tion, confirming key nominees, and 
holding hearings on the coronavirus 
crisis and the effectiveness of the his-
toric rescue package the Senate wrote 
and the Senate passed. 
We are heeding medical guidance and 
taking new precautions, but we are 
showing up and getting things done. 
Over across the Rotunda, in the 
House, crickets—their lights are off. 
The doors are locked. The people’s 
House has shown up for a grand total of 
2 legislative session days since March. 
Well, 2 days in 8 weeks is a blistering 
pace. 
Last week, they flew into town to 
pass Speaker PELOSI’s latest 1,800-page 
liberal wish list. Diversity and inclu-
sion in the marijuana industry wasn’t 
going to study itself, after all. That 
had to be an A–1 priority during this 
crisis. The Speaker’s proposal was so 
unserious and so far left that it could 
not even unite her own conference. 
Even after a 2-month sabbatical, House 
Democrats could not contribute any-
thing serious. 
Yet they did find the time to keep 
fishing for another impeachment. More 
than a year after the Mueller report 
thoroughly 
debunked 
the 
collusion 
conspiracy theory, Democrats are still 
pursuing the administration in court 
over that document. In a new Supreme 
Court brief the day before yesterday, 
House Democrats said they have the 
right to continue because—listen to 
this—the President’s impeachment did 
not actually end with his acquittal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2512 
May 20, 2020 
The House Democrats are now claim-
ing the impeachment that ended in 
February is not really over. Their brief 
says they are weighing ‘‘whether to 
recommend new articles of impeach-
ment.’’ And referring to Chairman 
NADLER’s Judiciary Committee, ‘‘the 
Committee’s 
investigation 
did 
not 
cease with the conclusion of the im-
peachment trial.’’ That is Chairman 
NADLER’s argument in a court case. 
Perpetual 
investigation 
and 
per-
petual impeachment—if only someone 
could have predicted this. If only any-
one had warned that House Democrats’ 
opening the Pandora’s box of weak im-
peachments would affect our country 
into the future. Of course, Senate and 
House Republicans warned precisely 
that, and here we are. 
It is a suitable complement to the 
other ongoing incident, where a Fed-
eral judge has taken it upon himself to 
prolong a case that the actual prosecu-
tors want to drop. 
These are fascinating legal stand-
ards. Investigations no longer end 
when a jury acquits someone and pros-
ecutions no longer end when charges 
are dropped. The House Democrats 
would rather spend a fourth consecu-
tive year trying to cram their politics 
into the legal system than actually 
govern the country during a pandemic. 
Fortunately, as I laid out, the Senate 
is up to the job. Every single day, the 
historic CARES Act that we wrote and 
passed to fight this pandemic continues 
to come online. Direct payments hit 
families’ accounts. Support for major 
industries helps to prevent mass lay-
offs. Resources for doctors, nurses, hos-
pitals, and healthcare providers help to 
stabilize the system from coast to 
coast. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
has saved tens of millions of jobs for 
American workers. From big cities to 
small towns, to industrial suburbs, to 
farm country, Senate Republicans’ bold 
program is turning potential pink slips 
into paychecks every single day. 
To be sure, the program is imperfect. 
That was guaranteed when banks had 
to cram multiple years’ worth of lend-
ing into a few weeks. Yesterday, we 
saw a glaring example of that imper-
fection. The legislation we passed con-
tains specific eligibility requirements. 
One rule said affiliates of national non-
profits could not pose as small non-
profits and ask for money. But because 
time was and is of the essence, the leg-
islation set up a process of initial self- 
certification with review to follow, 
rather than lengthy vetting upfront 
that would have slowed the emergency 
money for rightful recipients. 
We learned yesterday that the Na-
tion’s 
largest 
abortion 
provider, 
Planned Parenthood, abused this emer-
gency process and grabbed tens of mil-
lions of dollars of taxpayer money for 
which they were completely ineligible. 
This is the organization that fired its 
new president last year because she 
was too focused on broader health 
issues and not sufficiently fixated on 
abortion above all else. Disrespecting 
human life is their central mission, and 
they just took advantage of a national 
crisis and helped themselves to tens of 
millions of taxpayer dollars they were 
clearly forbidden from taking. 
It goes without saying that the 
money must be sent back imme-
diately—right now. As we shine a light 
on Planned Parenthood’s misrepresen-
tations, we cannot let their actions 
jeopardize 
this 
important 
program 
with the tens of millions of Americans 
who are benefiting from it rightly. 
Remember, the PPP has pushed $500 
billion into the economy across more 
than 4 million loans. The average loan 
size is just $118,000, giving paychecks 
instead of pink slips for tens of mil-
lions of Americans. 
My hometown of Louisville, KY, is 
home to the baseball bat factory that 
makes the world-famous Louisville 
Slugger. For a few months, the bat fac-
tory was a temporary casualty of 
COVID–19. This month, the manufac-
turer secured a PPP loan, and 171 em-
ployees were pulled off furlough and 
put right back on the payroll. So 171 
family stories went from pain and 
chaos back to stability because of this 
program. That is just one business in 
one city in one State. 
There is also an automotive parts 
supplier and a hoagie shop in Michigan, 
a fresh flower shop in Arizona, a burger 
joint and a community nonprofit in 
North Carolina, and on and on and on. 
Four million loans across all 50 States 
and new loans are still being issued as 
we speak. This is what serious legisla-
tion looks like. This is what serious so-
lutions can accomplish. 
Every day, the Senate’s work is pay-
ing dividends to working families all 
across our country. 
The pandemic is not all we are work-
ing on. The Senate is also staying on 
top of foreign relations, national secu-
rity, and the personnel business. 
Yesterday, 
the 
Intelligence 
Com-
mittee reported out the nomination of 
the next Director of the National Intel-
ligence. The Armed Services Com-
mittee reported out nominations for 
Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Staff of 
the Air Force, and Deputy Under Sec-
retary of Defense for Policy. 
I hope our Democratic colleagues 
will not block the Senate from filling 
these key national security vacancies 
before we adjourn later this week. 
f 
TRIBUTE TO DR. BRIAN MONAHAN 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
throughout this health crisis, the Sen-
ate, its Members, and our staffs have 
been lucky to have the steady leader-
ship of Dr. Brian Monahan in our cor-
ner. Our Attending Physician has re-
sponded with the same ability and pro-
fessionalism that have benefited Con-
gress and the Supreme Court for more 
than a decade. His continued guidance 
is making it possible for the Senate to 
smartly and safely fulfill our constitu-
tional duty to the American people. 
The last time our Nation faced a pan-
demic on this scale, the 1918 Spanish 
flu, the Attending Physician’s office 
was still more than a decade away from 
even existing. Dr. Monahan has had to 
break unprecedented ground in his cru-
cial role on multiple levels, but, true to 
form, he has adapted on the fly to serve 
his country. 
Dr. Monahan has developed detailed 
advice for Members and committees. 
His team is working around the clock 
to answer questions and to keep us 
healthy. Expertise and attention to de-
tail are nothing new from our Attend-
ing Physician, who has spent a proud 
career in military service. The Senate 
is lucky that the public service of this 
decorated rear admiral and celebrated 
instructor has brought him to us. We 
certainly are grateful to him and his 
entire team. 
I am happy to report that we aren’t 
the only ones taking notice. 
Mr. President, as a measure of our 
collective gratitude, I ask unanimous 
consent that this recent New York 
Times feature profile of Dr. Monahan 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the New York Times, May 16, 2020] 
DOCTOR TO CONGRESS AND SUPREME COURT 
TOILS TO SIDESTEP POLITICS AMID PANDEMIC 
(By Emily Cochrane) 
WASHINGTON—When 
Senator 
John 
Bar-
rasso, Republican of Wyoming, sought guid-
ance on how to protect his family, including 
his 94-year-old father-in-law, when he re-
turned home from the nation’s capital amid 
the coronavirus pandemic, a doctor offered 
him some blunt advice. 
Don’t go home just yet, Dr. Brian P. 
Monahan, the attending physician of Con-
gress, told Mr. Barrasso, directing him to 
quarantine for 14 days before rejoining his 
family. ‘‘You’re a visitor,’’ Dr. Monahan 
said. 
But when House Democratic leaders want-
ed counsel on whether they could safely re-
convene in the Capitol with Covid–19 still 
spreading—a debate with political dimen-
sions as a partisan divide was emerging 
across the country over how quickly to re-
open—Dr. Monahan was less absolute. Re-
turning to Washington carried health risks 
he would not recommend taking, he told 
Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Rep-
resentative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the 
majority leader. But it was up to them to de-
cide what to do. 
They opted to delay their return, and on 
Friday, partly because of Dr. Monahan’s 
warnings, moved forward with plans to insti-
tute remote voting in the future. 
It was typical of Dr. Monahan, the 59-year- 
old Navy rear admiral who is known in the 
halls of the Capitol as much for his meticu-
lous attention to medical detail as he is for 
his efforts to stay completely out of politics. 
‘‘He is both an executive with lots of 
health 
care 
responsibilities—particularly 
now—and also has the unique relationship 
with members that a small-town doctor 
would have with the patients he knows and 
sees,’’ said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of 
Missouri and chairman of the Senate Rules 
Committee. ‘‘He’s in a unique role at a 
unique time’’ 
As government doctors have emerged as 
trusted public voices and political figures in 
the face of a fearsome pandemic—appearing

May 20, 2020 
in White House news conferences and as wit-
nesses at marquee hearings—Dr. Monahan 
has maintained an uncommonly low profile. 
He never issued a public statement offering 
his opinion on whether Congress should re-
convene, although he shared his warnings 
with House leaders and privately told senior 
Republican officials that his office did not 
have the capacity to screen all 100 senators 
for the coronavirus when they returned to 
work. When Alex M. Azar II, the health sec-
retary, said he would send 1,000 tests to Cap-
itol Hill to accommodate them, Ms. Pelosi 
and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of 
Kentucky and the majority leader, turned 
down the offer, wary of the optics of receiv-
ing special treatment at a time when testing 
was scarce—and prompting President Trump 
to suggest on Twitter that ‘‘maybe you need 
a new Doctor over there.’’ 
Dr. Monahan, who declined to be inter-
viewed, has been a calm and professional 
voice of reason during the pandemic, accord-
ing to interviews with more than two dozen 
lawmakers, Capitol officials and medical 
professionals who know him. They say he 
has taken a personal interest in his influen-
tial clientele, which also includes the nine 
Supreme Court justices, even as he fields po-
litically charged questions about reopening, 
testing and precautionary measures. 
Operating out of a nondescript clinic 
tucked away in the heart of the Capitol, Dr. 
Monahan and a small staff have been exceed-
ingly busy since the pandemic took hold, 
consulting with lawmakers who have con-
tracted Covid–19 or exposed to someone in-
fected with it, doling out health rec-
ommendations in detailed memos ahead of 
votes, and producing a series of videos re-
leased on an internal website to educate law-
makers and their staff on how to protect 
themselves. 
Dr. Monahan has filmed and produced the 
videos by himself in his office, often seated 
next to an elaborate bouquet of white flow-
ers and a tiny plastic model of a pangolin, 
the scaly mammal that may have been an 
intermediary carrier of the virus. 
In the videos, he typically walks through 
the most recent recommendations offered by 
the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion and demonstrates medical equipment, 
such as a thermometer and a variety of 
masks (including one made by his wife, using 
a black shopping bag and a sewing machine). 
‘‘He has a big job—two houses of Congress, 
two parties to deal with—but he’s not polit-
ical in any way,’’ Ms. Pelosi said. ‘‘He treats 
us all with respect, and we respect his judg-
ment in return.’’ 
Dr. Monahan in 2009 became the seventh 
man to serve as attending physician, taking 
up a position that has always been held by a 
Navy doctor. The House first approved a 
Navy officer to work out of the Democratic 
cloakroom in 1928 after one lawmaker died 
and two collapsed, with several hours pass-
ing before a doctor could arrive in each case. 
Two years later, the Senate extended that 
doctor’s jurisdiction to include its own mem-
bers, leading to the establishment of the Of-
fice of the Attending Physician. 
The office provides care to lawmakers for a 
fee, as well as offering some services and 
emergency care to staff and tourists. The 
first physician, Dr. George W. Calver, who 
began his work just before the start of the 
Great Depression, displayed placards in 
cloakrooms and elevators across the Capitol 
with his nine ‘‘Commandments of Health,’’ 
including ‘‘Accept Inevitables (don’t worry)’’ 
and ‘‘Relax Completely.’’ 
Dr. Monahan was born in Connecticut, the 
son of Irish immigrants who came to the 
United States in the 1950s. His mother grew 
up in Kilkee, while his father grew up in a 
house with a thatched roof without running 
water or electricity in Lissycasey. The first 
in his family to attend college, he worked 
full-time at a supermarket while commuting 
in a yellow Volkswagen Beetle to Fairfield 
University, a Jesuit college—an education, 
he would tell graduates in 2011, that meant, 
‘‘you are called to be ‘men and women for 
others.’ ’’ 
He studied biology and chemistry, and 
after graduating, joined the Navy through 
its Health Professions Scholarship Program, 
enticed in part by the offer of free tuition 
and a living allowance in exchange for a 
commitment to three years of service. 
‘‘Brian was always the smartest kid in the 
class,’’ said Dr. William Dahut, a medical 
oncologist who spent time with him in both 
medical school and the Navy. ‘‘If there was a 
publication or data, Brian knew that data 
and knew that well.’’ 
In 1989, as a resident in the cardiology 
ward in what was then the National Naval 
Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., he treated 
a 39-year-old woman for potentially fatal 
cardiac arrhythmias. The patient had taken 
the popular antihistamine Seldane, and his 
contribution to research on that medicine— 
and its connection to the arrhythmias—later 
helped lead to its removal from the market. 
Dr. Monahan rose through the ranks of the 
Navy, becoming a professor of medicine and 
pathology at the Uniformed Services Univer-
sity of the Health Sciences in Maryland, as 
well as participating in a number of national 
organizations related to cancer, oncology 
and hematology. 
While serving as the Chairman of the De-
partment of Medicine at the university, he 
received a call for a meeting in which offi-
cials with congressional leadership asked 
him to become the attending physician on 
Capitol Hill when his predecessor retired. 
He has since become a fixture on Capitol 
Hill, participating in congressional trips and 
functions and releasing health assessments 
for presidential and vice-presidential con-
tenders, including Senators Bernie Sanders, 
the Vermont independent, and Tim Kaine, 
Democrat of Virginia. (Mr. Kaine also asked 
him for ‘‘a tuneup’’ before hiking the Vir-
ginia section of the Appalachian Trail.) 
In 2016, it was Dr. Monahan’s assessment of 
Justice Antonin Scalia’s health at the time 
of his death—including sleep apnea, coronary 
artery disease, obesity and diabetes—that in-
fluenced the decision to decline an autopsy 
of the justice, The Associated Press reported 
at the time. 
‘‘He was the one who advised me to go to 
the 
hospital,’’ 
said 
Representative 
Ben 
McAdams, Democrat of Utah and one of the 
first lawmakers to contract the virus, said of 
Dr. Monahan. ‘‘He was clear: ‘I strongly rec-
ommend you go to the hospital—this is seri-
ous.’ ’’ 
The congressman has spoken with the doc-
tor at least a dozen times since, he said in an 
interview on Thursday—but had yet to meet 
Dr. Monahan in person. 
An avid photographer, Dr. Monahan’s 
photos are present in offices around the Cap-
itol—and he has been known to offer advice 
on how to best capture a scenic landmark or 
vista on trips overseas. 
He checks in with his powerful patients 
frequently, including long after they have re-
covered. 
‘‘I’ve been around for a long period of time, 
and he just takes more of a personal interest 
than anyone else I’ve ever known in that po-
sition,’’ said Senator James M. Inhofe, Re-
publican of Oklahoma and chairman of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee, who has 
been on Capitol Hill for more than three dec-
ades. ‘‘He just seems to be genuinely inter-
ested in me—and he’s that way with every-
body.’’ 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
we thank the good doctor for all he 
does for this institution and for his 
country.

EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under

ceed to executive session to resume 
consideration of the following nomina-
tion, which the clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read 
the 
nomination 
of 
Anna 
M. 
Manasco, of Alabama, to be United 
States District Judge for the Northern 
District of Alabama. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The

OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we 
are going to complete 3 weeks of Sen-
ate activity, called together by Sen-
ator MCCONNELL at a time when the 
House of Representatives, under the 
guidance of Dr. Monahan, who was just 
praised—and I join in that praise—was 
not in session when the Senate came to 
session. 
I said at the time that it was our re-
sponsibility to be here. That is why we 
ran for office. Important things need to 
be decided, and we need to be part of it 
for the good of the Nation. 
We are about to complete 3 straight 
weeks without one measure on the 
floor of the Senate relating to the na-
tional public health emergency—not 
one. There have been hearings in some 
committees, yes, but activity on the 
floor of the Senate, no. No bill was 
brought to the floor. 
In fact, there was an attempt yester-
day to bring a resolution that said the 
United States should be involved in the 
global international effort to find a 
vaccine. It was objected to on the Re-
publican side. The reason the Senator 
objected to it—the chairman of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee— 
is that he wants to take up the meas-
ure in his committee at some later 
date. I encourage that Senator to do it 
quickly. 
I think there is a sense of urgency 
across America in terms of this na-
tional health emergency that we face.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2514 
May 20, 2020 
Yet there is not a sense of urgency on 
the Republican side of the aisle, de-
spite the fact that for 3 weeks we have 
not considered one measure on the 
floor related to this COVID–19 virus, 
which is unexplainable and indefen-
sible. 
Senator MCCONNELL, of Kentucky, 
has told us that he doesn’t sense the 
urgency for us to take up the measure 
passed last week by the House of Rep-
resentatives. This was a bipartisan 
measure that was brought to the floor 
of the House of Representatives, which 
attempted to move us forward from the 
original CARES Act, the $3 trillion of 
cumulative spending that we have fo-
cused on the economy and the public 
health challenge facing our Nation. 
Is there any urgency to it? Well, I 
sense that urgency every time I pick 
up the phone or read the newspaper in 
my State of Illinois. I am on con-
ference call after conference call with 
groups across our State that are con-
cerned about economic issues, as well 
as public health issues. There is truly a 
sense of urgency where I live. I cannot 
believe 
that 
Senator 
MCCONNELL 
doesn’t sense it in his own State of 
Kentucky. 
Kentucky hospitals and healthcare 
providers have received $900 million in 
CARES Act funding. I don’t question 
whether they were deserving or needed 
it; we received funds, as well, in the 
State of Illinois. But the Kentucky 
Hospital Association tells us that the 
hospitals in Kentucky are expected to 
lose $1.3 billion in March and April 
alone. 
You know, we are next door to Ken-
tucky, and my hospitals in downstate 
southern Illinois, right next to Ken-
tucky, have told me the same thing. 
They are losing money right and left. 
Do they think this is an urgent prob-
lem in Illinois? You bet they do, and I 
will bet the hospitals in Kentucky do 
as well. 
This is what the vice president of the 
Kentucky Hospital Association, Carl 
Herde, said: ‘‘Since there is no clear 
path to recoup these losses, the hos-
pitals are left with no choice but to 
look at their own operations to cut as 
much cost as they possibly can.’’ 
The University of Kentucky is pro-
jecting a $160 million loss for its 
healthcare system. It has furloughed 
1,500 employees. Jenny Stuart Health 
in Hopkinsville, KY, has furloughed 248 
staff members. Appalachian Regional 
Health in Lexington will furlough 500 
employees. St. Claire Health in More-
head is furloughing 300. Pikeville Med-
ical Center has furloughed 200. 
Is there a sense of urgency in these 
communities, when many of these hos-
pitals are the largest employers in 
town and hundreds of people are being 
furloughed because of the COVID virus, 
because of the fact that they cannot re-
sume ordinary hospital operations with 
this shadow of infection hanging over 
them? 
The bill that passed the House of 
Representatives last week, which we 
did not consider or even discuss, to my 
knowledge, in the Senate this week, 
the HEROES Act, called for more than 
$100 billion more in relief to hospitals. 
How important is that? 
I know how important it is in Illi-
nois; I can tell you flat-out. As a 
downstater, when you take a look at 
the rural and smalltown hospitals in 
my State, they are struggling. 
One hospital administrator told me 
that she had scheduled four elective 
surgeries last Monday, a week ago, and 
only one patient showed up. The other 
three called in and said they were too 
frightened to go to the hospital and 
run the risk of being exposed to the 
COVID virus. I cannot imagine there is 
not the same situation going on in 
Kentucky. 
Isn’t there a sense of urgency in Ken-
tucky, as in Illinois, for us to move and 
move quickly to help these hospitals 
before they furlough more people and 
ultimately face closure—a disaster in 
any community that we want to ur-
gently avoid? 
State and local governments are 
struggling now to pay teachers, first 
responders, and healthcare workers as 
they face record revenue losses and in-
creased costs of fighting the virus. The 
measure that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives last week had almost $1 
trillion to help these State and local 
governments—not just in Illinois but 
in every State, including the Common-
wealth of Kentucky. 
In States around the country, red and 
blue—the Center for Budget and Policy 
Priorities estimates that States will 
lose $650 billion in revenues by next 
summer. By the end of the year, Ken-
tucky is expected to lose between 10 
and 17 percent of its annual revenues. 
Without help from the Federal Govern-
ment, Kentucky’s Governor announced 
that Kentucky’s ‘‘recession will be 
longer or unemployment will be great-
er.’’ 
Congress appropriated $150 billion in 
funding for State and local govern-
ments in the original CARES Act, but 
that funding is not enough to make up 
for the enormous losses that are being 
faced by State and local governments 
across the United States. These Gov-
ernors, these mayors, these leaders 
have a sense of urgency in making up 
this revenue. They face the reality of 
cutbacks in police, firefighters, first 
responders, paramedics, nurses, doc-
tors, and teachers. 
The HEROES Act which passed the 
House of Representatives last week and 
which has not been considered this 
week in the Senate included $875 bil-
lion in fiscal relief for State and local-
ities to help cover the shortfall to 
make sure communities can continue 
to pay frontline essential workers. 
Understand the deadlines that were 
built into the CARES Act. The first 
deadline is June 8. That is the date by 
which small businesses that borrowed 
money under the payroll protection 
part of that act need to have spent the 
money in order to have the loan for-
given—June 8. 
Who among us believes that small 
businesses will be in a position to re-
cover and get back to business as usual 
by June? I pray that is the case, but I 
know better in my home State and I 
will bet you in the State of Kentucky 
as well. 
How about unemployment? We came 
through in the CARES Act and did 
something 
dramatic 
and 
unprece-
dented. We said that we were going to 
give an extra payment, a Federal pay-
ment, to those who were unemployed 
so that they could weather this storm 
as their families try to adjust to no 
breadwinner in the house—$600 a week 
on top of whatever the State benefit of 
unemployment might be. For some 
families, it was just enough to get by. 
Understand, though, that benefit— 
that unemployment benefit of $600 
from the Federal Government each 
week—is going to end at the end of 
July. That is not that far way. We are 
talking about 10 weeks at the most. Do 
we honestly believe the unemployment 
crisis, with 36 million unemployed 
Americans, will be behind us by the 
end of July? I wish that were the case, 
but we know better. In my State of Illi-
nois, I know better. 
We are hoping to start reopening the 
economy in a safe, responsible, careful 
way and to give these small businesses 
a fighting chance to open their doors 
again and survive, but it is going to be 
a struggle, and many of them won’t 
make it. 
Earlier this month, 69,000 people filed 
new unemployment claims in Ken-
tucky—a 4,000-percent increase from 
last year. Do those families who are 
now unemployed feel that this re-
sponse, this Federal assistance in un-
employment benefits, is urgent? Well, 
you bet it is. How many of those in Illi-
nois or Kentucky believe they won’t 
need this help after the end of July this 
year? July—the same month the $600- 
per-week unemployment benefits ex-
pire—the unemployment rate in Ken-
tucky has been projected to be 16.3 per-
cent—the 10th highest in the Nation. 
Yet the Republican leader says there is 
no sense of urgency in moving on this 
measure that was considered by the 
House of Representatives and passed 
last week. 
The IRS has sent out almost 2 mil-
lion economic impact payments to that 
State of Kentucky, worth more than $3 
billion, helping families put food on 
the table and pay their rent and their 
mortgage. 
When you take a look at that eco-
nomic impact payment, understand 
that the measure that passed the 
House, which we did not bring to the 
floor this week in the U.S. Senate, 
calls for $1,200 more for each adult and 
$1,200 for each child. Do families need 
it in Illinois? You bet they do. 
Even though it was originally pro-
posed by President Trump, politics had 
nothing to do with the support that it 
received from both political parties— 
the support that this measure that just 
passed the House should receive from

both parties here in the Senate as well. 
There is a sense of urgency when it 
comes to these cash payments to peo-
ple who are struggling to make ends 
meet. The bill that passed the House 
includes a second round of these crit-
ical payments and makes sure that we 
extend the unemployment benefits be-
yond the end of July. 
According to the Kentucky Center 
for Economic Policy, tens of thousands 
of Kentuckians have lost their health 
insurance as a result of this pandemic. 
What a moment in life to lose your 
health insurance—in the midst of a 
pandemic, with people facing hos-
pitalizations, treatment in and out of 
the hospital and in some cases ICUs, to 
think that you would be without 
health insurance? 
The measure that passed the House 
of Representatives last week, which 
was not brought to the floor by the Re-
publicans this week in the Senate, in-
cludes a provision to ensure that peo-
ple who have lost their health insur-
ance as a result of becoming unem-
ployed can remain on their employer 
healthcare plan without paying any 
premiums. In other words, we want to 
make sure that people have health in-
surance rather than lose it. Was that 
brought up this week for debate and 
consideration in the Senate? No. No, it 
wasn’t. Is it a matter of urgency if you 
are facing the loss of health insurance 
in the middle of this coronavirus epi-
demic? Of course it is. 
The Paycheck Protection Program 
still has funding left in it to provide 
some loans, but businesses have to 
spend the money within 8 weeks of re-
ceiving the loan or it won’t be forgiven. 
Many small business owners across the 
United States are facing a June 8 dead-
line, struggling to spend the money due 
to the fact that they still haven’t been 
able to open their doors. 
The HEROES Act, which passed the 
House of Representatives and was not 
brought up for consideration in the 
Senate this week, which it could have 
been, would extend the deadline an ad-
ditional 16 weeks, providing small busi-
nesses 24 weeks to spend the money 
they were loaned by the SBA, and it 
would authorize the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program through the end of the 
year to ensure that we can continue to 
help small businesses through this dif-
ficult time. 
Is there a sense of urgency in small 
businesses in my State to extend this 
period that you can spend the money 
as a small business and have your loan 
forgiven? Of course there is a sense of 
urgency in Illinois, in North Carolina, 
in Georgia, and in Kentucky—across 
the United States. Why the Senate Re-
publican leader does not feel a sense of 
urgency on this measure, which ulti-
mately ends on June 30, is beyond me. 
I have heard from farmers across my 
State who are struggling to survive, 
asking for help. I have heard from the 
Census Bureau about the need to push 
back its response deadline to October 
31—measures also included in the HE-
ROES Act that passed the House of 
Representatives. 
Three weeks have ended here on the 
floor of the Senate, and, but for a few 
speeches on this floor, if you read the 
record 
of 
legislative 
activity, 
you 
would wonder if the leaders in the Sen-
ate even realize we are facing a pan-
demic. We have spent our time on nom-
ination after nomination. We have 
spent our time in hearings on friends 
and those who pass political muster 
who want lifetime appointments to the 
Federal court. But somehow we have 
managed to miss the biggest story in 
America—the pandemic. 
I would say to Senator MCCONNELL 
and the Republican leadership: We have 
wasted an opportunity—a 3-week op-
portunity—to move forward, and we 
have particularly wasted this week 
when we could have taken up the meas-
ure that passed the House of Rep-
resentatives last week. 
Are we prepared to negotiate a com-
promise? Of course we are. We have 
done that every time we have brought 
up a measure related to the pandemic. 
It should be bipartisan in the end. But 
to say it is ‘‘dead on arrival’’ and there 
is no sense of urgency among the Re-
publicans in the Senate to take up this 
measure is to ignore the obvious. 
Whether it is $1,200 payments to Amer-
ican citizens who are struggling to get 
by, whether it is an increased period of 
time for qualification to receive unem-
ployment insurance, whether it is 
loans to small businesses so they can 
survive, these are the urgent needs of 
America. 
When we have hospitals furloughing 
employees in Illinois, in Kentucky, and 
around the Nation, we run the risk of 
losing these great hospitals that are 
needed for the future. 
Is it urgent that we take up this mat-
ter? Of course it is. Yet this week we 
have done nothing, zero, when it comes 
to this measure. 
We are going to leave now for the Me-
morial Day week, which means it will 
be about 2 weeks before we return. I 
can just about guarantee that the 
sense of urgency across America will be 
palpable at that time. The question is 
whether there will be a sense of ur-
gency felt by the Republican leader 
from the State of Kentucky. 
The other day, my friend and col-
league from Texas, Senator CORNYN, 
came to the floor, as he has before, to 
discuss the issue of liability and immu-
nity as part of the conversation on the 
next measure of relief and rescue for 
our economy. 
For weeks, Senator MCCONNELL and 
Senator CORNYN have said that unless 
Congress gives broad legal immunity to 
corporations, they would block emer-
gency aid to help States and local gov-
ernments avoid massive layoffs of po-
licemen, firefighters, and teachers. The 
logic behind this position is hard to 
fathom. 
There has been no flood of COVID–19 
lawsuits. There is a website maintained 
by the law firm Hunton Andrews Kurth 
that tracks all the lawsuits filed in 
America based on COVID–19. Senator 
MCCONNELL
has cited this tracking. 
That tracker updated its numbers as of 
yesterday. It reported that out of 1.5 
million confirmed COVID–19 cases and 
90,000 deaths, there have been 2—2— 
COVID–19 medical malpractice cases 
filed in the United States in over 1,000 
complaints that have been filed and 26 
cases alleging workplace exposure to 
COVID–19. The Senator from Kentucky 
has called this a tidal wave of lawsuits, 
a windfall for trial lawyers—2 cases of 
medical malpractice and 26 cases for 
workplace exposure? 
The 
other 
cases 
that 
mention 
COVID–19 relate to prisoners in prisons 
and jails, who are questioning whether 
their rights are being violated because 
of the health circumstances in the pris-
ons. There are lawsuits against insur-
ance companies as to whether the pol-
icy covers a business that has suffered 
losses because of the COVID virus. 
There have been lawsuits as well be-
tween businesses as to responsibility 
for it. But this notion of a tidal wave of 
lawsuits being filed—2 medical mal-
practice cases across the United States 
of America and 26 workplace exposure 
cases. 
Keep in mind that if you do get sick 
and you want to file a lawsuit, a good 
lawyer will advise you: Be careful. 
Proving where you were infected is not 
an easy thing. And they also look at 
the standard of conduct of the business 
or individual who could be the defend-
ant. Did they act reasonably? 
We had a hearing in the Senate Judi-
ciary Committee last week on liability 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. I have 
quoted this before, but it is worth re-
peating. One of the witnesses called by 
the Republicans was a very good man, 
very thoughtful. His name is Kevin 
Smartt, and he is the chief executive 
officer and president of Kwik Chek 
Foods in Bonham, TX. He went through 
a litany of things that he had done in 
his workplace to make it safer, not just 
for his employees but also for the cus-
tomers who came in. It was impressive. 
If the statements he made to us were 
accurate—and I believe they were—he 
is doing his part to try to make his 
workplace safer. 
Here is what he said: 
This was a challenge because the guidance 
provided by the CDC, the Occupational Safe-
ty and Health Administration, as well as 
state and local governments, often conflicted 
with one another in addition to being vague 
and difficult to follow. Yet, despite many un-
certainties, including the constantly fluc-
tuating public health guidelines, we began to 
adjust to the pandemic. 
The point I am making—and I see our 
Democratic leader on the floor; I am 
going to wrap it up quickly—the point 
I am making is this: We should estab-
lish reasonable standards through the 
Centers for Disease Control and OSHA 
so that conscientious businesses can in 
good faith know what needs to be done 
to protect their employees and their 
customers. When they follow those 
guidelines, I believe they have absolved

themselves of liability. They certainly 
have a valid defense to any claims of 
wrongdoing. 
But 
this 
notion 
that 
comes before us on the floor from the 
Republican side goes to an extreme— 
asking for government immunity from 
the conduct of businesses in the midst 
of this pandemic without holding them 
to any standards. We are still waiting 
for an explanation. Why would we 
allow the workplace to be more dan-
gerous for employees? Why would we 
allow the business place to be more 
dangerous for customers? 
If the owner is willing to live up to 
reasonable standards established based 
on science and health, in my mind, 
that is a good defense, and that is the 
way it should be. To do otherwise is to 
give a green light to businesses that 
don’t follow standards, endangering 
their workers, their employees. It 
means more people are going to get in-
fected and sick in America—the last 
thing we need. 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
Democratic leader is recognized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first I want to thank my friend and col-
league, the senior Senator from the 
State of Illinois. He is always on the 
money, pushing this country to do 
what its better angels recommend, and 
I hope America listens to his floor 
speech today and every day because 
what he is doing would make America 
a better, stronger, more unified, more 
humane, 
and 
more 
compassionate 
place. 
As the COVID–19 pandemic continues 
to inflict our country, businesses are 
suffering, families are struggling to 
pay the rent, millions of Americans are 
filing for unemployment every single 
week, and tens of thousands of Ameri-
cans are dying. 
Every aspect of American society has 
been changed by this crisis—except, 
perhaps, the Republican Senate. Here 
it is business as usual. 
Leader MCCONNELL has spent 3 weeks 
of the Senate’s time largely on nomi-
nations, only one of whom is directly 
related to COVID–19. There is not one 
bill on the floor of the Senate having 
to do with COVID in the entire month 
of May. The leader has put none on the 
floor. 
Democrats have had to relentlessly 
pressure our colleagues to hold even 
the most routine and needed oversight 
hearings 
on 
the 
coronavirus. 
Coronavirus is raging, and people are 
upset about how the administration is 
implementing it. We don’t have hear-
ings until we push, push, push for 
them, and then they happen few, far 
between, and too late. 
It would be one thing if the Repub-
lican majority were doing this other 
business while negotiating with Demo-
crats on the next phase of emergency 
relief, but Republicans are not negoti-
ating about the next phase of emer-
gency relief. Many of my colleagues on 
the other side have said that more re-
lief just isn’t necessary. 
The Republican leader rejected legis-
lation from the House of Representa-
tives before the bill was even drafted— 
a knee-jerk partisan response at a time 
when we should be working together to 
help our suffering constituents. For the 
life of me, I don’t know why it has been 
so difficult to get our friends on the 
other side to focus on the ongoing na-
tional crisis, and it appears that the 
lack of focus, the lack of urgency, and 
the lack of compassion from the Re-
publican majority are about to get 
even worse. 
Today, in the Homeland Security 
Committee, the Republican chairman 
has convened a hearing that slanders 
the family of the President’s political 
opponent. Believe it or not, this power-
ful Senate committee, with broad ju-
risdiction over so many aspects of the 
government’s response to the ongoing 
pandemic, is prioritizing yet another 
attempt 
to 
smear 
Vice 
President 
Biden. The committee could be holding 
a hearing today with the FEMA Ad-
ministrator to discuss disaster assist-
ance. But, no, the highest priority of 
Senate Republicans lies in promoting 
conspiracy theories that have already 
been discredited on numerous occa-
sions—conspiracy theories, which, by 
the way, are known to be part of Rus-
sian disinformation campaigns. Our 
Republican majority is using Russian 
propaganda to try to damage a polit-
ical opponent. Is that a disgrace? Is 
that a disgrace? 
The Republican chairman is pressing 
forward, without Members even receiv-
ing a briefing from the intelligence 
community. Even more shameful, the 
company my colleague from Wisconsin 
wants to subpoena is cooperating with 
the committee in providing documents. 
It appears this subpoena is just for 
show—a way to create the false impres-
sion of wrongdoing. It is like in a Third 
World dictatorship, a show trial with 
no basis in fact, with no due process, 
and with no reality. 
Not to be outdone, the Republican 
chairman of the Judiciary Committee 
has asked members of his committee to 
consider subpoenas related to yet an-
other conspiracy theory pushed by 
President Trump—a theory that at-
tempts to rewrite the history of Rus-
sian interference in the 2016 election to 
match the fiction in President Trump’s 
head. It seems Republicans want to 
dive into the deepest muck of right-
wing conspiracy to invent scapegoats 
for the President to use in his reelec-
tion campaign. 
The conspiracy caucus is back. It 
reared its ugly head in December and 
has been on a simmer ever since. Now 
it is boiling over once again, shame-
fully, in the middle of a public health 
crisis and an economic disaster that re-
quire all of us to focus on the problems 
at hand. 
Senate Republicans aren’t drafting 
legislation to help the unemployed. 
They are holding sham hearings about 
the family of the President’s political 
rival. Senate Republicans aren’t debat-
ing measures to increase testing. They 
are turning Senate committee rooms 
into the studio of ‘‘FOX & Friends.’’ 
Senate Republicans are not just ignor-
ing the coronavirus. They are prac-
tically sprinting toward a partisan 
election, making this Chamber part of 
a reelection campaign—not what it was 
ever intended to be by the Founding 
Fathers or anyone else, until this fever 
to bow down to President Trump’s wild 
conspiracy theories that has overtaken 
just about every Senate Republican. 
Here is what Chairman GRAHAM said 
about his ‘‘investigation’’ yesterday. 
Here is what he said: 
I want to get all the information out there. 
I want to do it before the election. 
Well, there is a Republican intention 
right there—‘‘do it before the elec-
tion.’’ 
Leader MCCONNELL says that Repub-
licans have not felt the urgency yet to 
act on the coronavirus, but it sure 
sounds like there is some urgency to 
get these phony investigations going 
before November. A fever is raging in 
the conspiracy caucus. They are wor-
ried about the outcome of the election. 
They 
are 
worried 
that 
President 
Trump—they know—has done a very 
poor job in dealing with this crisis. So 
they turn to wild conspiracy theories 
and turn the Senate, which should be 
debating and discussing coronavirus re-
lief, into sort of a partisan sham Cham-
ber. It is disgraceful. 
Now, 
Leader 
MCCONNELL
gave 
a 
lengthy speech on the floor of the Sen-
ate yesterday giving cover to many of 
the President’s crackpot theories about 
what transpired in 2016. I will just say 
this: Leader MCCONNELL reportedly wa-
tered down a bipartisan warning about 
Russian interference in the fall of 2016. 
He stalled for years on election secu-
rity funding, and still, to this day, is 
blocking election security funding. If 
Leader MCCONNELL wants to look back 
at the history of Russian interference 
in the 2016 election, he should look in 
the mirror. He might not like the way 
his own role is viewed. 
The American people should be just 
furious with Washington Republicans, 
and so many are—more and more every 
day. Americans are waiting in modern- 
day breadlines, jammed into municipal 
buildings, and cars snaked around 
parking lots and city blocks. It is so 
sad to look at these pictures. Doctors 
and nurses and other caregivers have 
been working nonstop to save Amer-
ican lives, often without the proper 
equipment. Millions of American work-
ers are sitting at home, having lost 
their jobs, through no fault of their 
own, dreading the day the next rent 
payment comes due. Here in Wash-
ington, Senate Republicans feel no ur-
gency to help these Americans. They 
are too busy touting conspiracy theo-
ries and electioneering for the Presi-
dent.

May 20, 2020 
lunch with Senate Republicans. They 
had a giant pep rally. They got all fired 
up to do nothing. That was the conclu-
sion. On the way out of the Capitol, the 
President was asked about the fact 
that the United States leads the world 
in confirmed cases of coronavirus, and 
here is what President Trump said— 
amazingly. Listen to this. Asked about 
leading the world in confirmed cases of 
coronavirus, the President said: 
I don’t look at that as a bad thing. I look 
at that in a certain respect as being a good 
thing because it means our testing is much 
better. . . . So I view it as a badge of honor. 
Really? First of all, our testing is not 
much better. States are struggling to 
get people tested due to confusion and 
a lack of national leadership. Many ex-
perts believe we are far short on what 
we need on testing. None of these ex-
perts, who actually understands the 
testing and this virus, would say the 
President deserves a badge of honor for 
his work. But even more galling is the 
idea that lots of cases of coronavirus is 
‘‘a good thing.’’ That is what the Presi-
dent said: Having lots of cases of 
coronavirus is ‘‘a good thing.’’ 
A lot of cases is not ‘‘a good thing,’’ 
Mr. President. It means people are sick 
and people are dying. A lot of cases 
means more Americans are in the hos-
pital, more Americans in ICU strug-
gling to breathe on ventilators. A lot of 
cases means Americans will die as a re-
sult of the virus that has already 
claimed the lives of nearly 100,000. A 
lot of cases means a lot more Ameri-
cans are seriously ill. Mr. President, 
that is not ‘‘a good thing.’’ Even your 
mind, which seems so warped at times, 
cannot really believe that. 
There is no ‘‘honor’’ in leading the 
world in the number of people infected 
with 
coronavirus. 
For 
the 
United 
States to have 1.5 million cases is noth-
ing to celebrate. It is something to be 
ashamed of. Calling it a ‘‘badge of 
honor’’ isn’t just wrong, it is sick, and 
it is an insult to every American fam-
ily who loses a loved one to this evil 
disease. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded, and I ask 
unanimous consent that I be able to 
conclude my remarks before the 11 
o’clock vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
5G 
Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the 
internet has been a part of our daily 
lives for quite a while now: Netflix, 
Twitter, and Amazon. The internet has 
taken on new importance during the 
coronavirus pandemic. It has become 
the main source of connection with 
friends and family. It has enabled 
many people to work from home to 
help reduce the spread of the virus. It 
is the main reason that schools and 
colleges have been able to continue 
teaching students. 
It has drastically expanded nascent 
services, like telehealth, which has al-
lowed doctors and other medical pro-
fessionals to provide patient care re-
motely. 
With all of this new internet traffic, 
of course, has come a much greater 
load on networks. Not all countries’ 
networks have held up to the strain. In 
Europe, networks have had to slow 
streaming 
and 
ask 
providers 
like 
Netflix to diminish the quality of their 
videos. 
Here in the United States, our net-
works have faced very few problems, 
and there is a reason for that. Europe 
and the United States have very dif-
ferent regulatory regimes for the inter-
net. In Europe, the internet has been 
regulated using outdated communica-
tions rules designed for telephone mo-
nopolies. This has resulted in heavy-
handed regulation, which has discour-
aged companies from investing in com-
munications 
infrastructure 
and 
broadband expansion. 
The resulting lack of reliable infra-
structure is the primary reason inter-
net performance in Europe has suffered 
during the pandemic. The regulatory 
situation in the United States, on the 
other hand, has been much different. 
With a few exceptions, like the brief 
imposition of so-called net neutrality 
regulations in 2015, our country has 
taken a light-touch approach to inter-
net regulation. 
This has encouraged companies to in-
vest in the latest communications in-
frastructure and new technologies to 
make more efficient use of spectrum. 
Thanks 
to 
that 
investment, 
when 
coronavirus hit and internet usage 
soared, American networks were ready. 
Despite the additional burden on net-
works during the pandemic, Americans 
have been able to enjoy the same high 
speeds and streaming quality that they 
typically 
enjoy. 
Right 
now, 
most 
Americans are using 4G networks. 
The next generation of internet, 5G, 
is here. 5G networks are starting to be 
deployed, including in my home State 
of South Dakota. If we want the United 
States to handle 5G the way that we 
handled 4G and if we want our 5G net-
works to be as successful as our 4G net-
works, we still have some work to do. 
One thing that is absolutely essential 
is maintaining the light-touch regu-
latory approach that has produced so 
much U.S. investment and innovation. 
Despite the success of light-touch regu-
lation, there is always a segment of the 
Democratic Party pushing for greater 
government regulation of the internet, 
and 
that 
would 
chill 
American 
broadband investment. 
When Democrats briefly succeeded in 
forcing through heavier government 
regulations in the latter part of the 
Obama Presidency, broadband infra-
structure investment by U.S. compa-
nies dropped significantly, and it only 
rebounded when the Federal Commu-
nications Commission, under Chairman 
Pai, rolled back these heavyhanded 
regulations. 
Second, the United States still has 
more work to do to deploy the infra-
structure necessary for 5G. While 4G 
relies on traditional cell phone towers, 
5G technology will also require small 
antennas called ‘‘small cells’’ that can 
often be attached to existing infra-
structure, like utility poles or build-
ings. 
Last year, I introduced legislation, 
the STREAMLINE Act, to make it 
easier for companies to deploy these 
small cells so that we can get the infra-
structure in place for 5G technology. 
We also need to update Federal regula-
tions to ensure that it doesn’t take 
months or years to get permits for 
wireless infrastructure. 
Infrastructure is a key part of the 5G 
equation. The other key part is spec-
trum. Like all internet technology, 5G 
relies on radio spectrum—what we 
commonly call the airwaves. Radio 
spectrum is divided into bands—low 
band, mid band, and high band. 5G will 
rely upon all three. 
The United States has done a good 
job freeing up high-band spectrum for 
5G, but we still need to free up more 
mid-band spectrum to see full-scale 55 
deployment. 
In 2018, Congress passed my MOBILE 
NOW Act, which helped lay the ground-
work for freeing up more mid-band 
spectrum. 
This past November, Senator WICKER 
and I introduced the 5G Spectrum Act 
to require the Federal Communications 
Commission to free up a critical por-
tion of mid-band spectrum, commonly 
referred to as the C-band for 5G use. 
While Congress did not enact our leg-
islation at the end of February, the 
Federal Communications Commission 
announced that it would adopt a frame-
work similar to that outlined in our 
bill to make 280 megahertz of C-band 
spectrum available for 5G. 
Finally, we need to ensure that we 
have the workforce in place to handle 
the demands of installing and main-
taining 5G technology. It is estimated 
that deploying the necessary infra-
structure for 5G will create approxi-
mately 50,000 new construction jobs 
each year over the build-out period, 
and that is just for construction. 
Right 
now, 
there 
simply 
aren’t 
enough workers with the necessary 
training to meet the needs of nation-
wide 5G. Earlier this year, I introduced 
the Telecommunications Skilled Work-
force Act. My bill would help to in-
crease the number of workers enrolled 
in 5G training programs and identify 
ways to grow the telecommunications 
workforce to meet the demands of 5G. 
The coronavirus has shown us the re-
sult of robust investment in 4G infra-
structure and spectrum—strong net-
works that can handle steep surge in 
internet traffic. We need to make sure 
that we are putting in the necessary 
work and investment to ensure that 
our 5G networks are just as strong.

S2518 
May 20, 2020 
The 5G future is here. Let’s make 
sure that the United States is ready. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Madam President, before we vote 
here in just a few minutes, I want to 
just make a couple of remarks with re-
spect to coronavirus legislation. We 
have heard some of our colleagues on 
the Democrat side come down here and 
attack Republicans for not wanting to 
do more legislation and more spending, 
which is, as they know, completely not 
accurate. Republicans are prepared to 
do whatever it takes to help America 
recover from the coronavirus effects 
and to deal with the health emergency, 
which is why we have invested tens of 
billions of dollars in vaccines and 
antiviral therapeutics and testing—all 
the things that are necessary to get 
this healthcare crisis dealt with in a 
way that would allow Americans the 
confidence to get back out in the econ-
omy. 
Secondly, dealing with the economic 
impacts, which have been many, the 
bills that we passed so far—we passed 
four—and the combined amount of the 
spending in those four bills are almost 
$3 trillion. It is focused on families, 
getting 
direct 
assistance 
into 
the 
hands of American families. It is fo-
cused on workers, keeping workers em-
ployed. This Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram has clearly been one that has al-
lowed a lot of small businesses to con-
tinue to operate and to continue to 
keep their workers employed. It is fo-
cused on those who, through no fault of 
their own, have lost jobs, with a sig-
nificant plus-up in unemployment in-
surance accounts, supported at the 
State level but significantly increased 
in terms of funding from the Federal 
Government. 
Of course, as I said earlier, it is fo-
cused very directly on those healthcare 
professionals or healthcare workers on 
the frontlines, to make sure that they 
have PPE and ventilators, all the 
things not only to protect themselves 
but to care for the patients whom they 
are entrusted to care for. As I said be-
fore, investing heavily in those things 
will help us fight and win and beat the 
coronavirus—the 
vaccines, 
the 
antiviral therapeutics, and the testing. 
Those are all things that we have done 
already. 
Now, what you saw last week was the 
House of Representatives blow into 
town for a 24-hour period to pass a 
massive $3 trillion bill filled up with 
all kinds of goodies in a gift bag for 
special interest groups that they care 
about but that have little to do with 
addressing the fundamental challenges 
facing this country with respect to the 
coronavirus. 
I would argue that not only do they 
not know what the need is but that 
many of the dollars we have already 
pushed out are still in the pipeline and 
haven’t been used. We don’t know what 
our State and local governments need 
in terms of revenue replacement, and 
we have lots of dollars that are still 
going out to hospitals, healthcare pro-
viders, and nursing homes, much of 
which hasn’t been spent yet. Of course 
we have the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, which we are burning through 
fairly quickly but hasn’t run out of 
funding yet either. As I said, those are 
all the things—the almost $3 trillion— 
that have been disbursed and distrib-
uted already to address this crisis. 
What Democrats did last week in the 
House of Representatives is that they 
came in with a philosophical, ideolog-
ical wish list—a fantasy, if you will—of 
all of the things they would like to get 
done, very few of which actually deal 
with the crisis at hand, so much so 
that their bill—1,800 pages long, $3 tril-
lion in new spending, again, without 
knowing what the effect is of dollars 
already spent or what the need is out 
there for additional spending—included 
things like funding for studies on di-
versity and inclusion in the marketing 
of cannabis. Is that really something 
that is relevant to fighting and bat-
tling the coronavirus? They included in 
there tax increases for small busi-
nesses. The one tax cut they included 
in their bill dramatically cuts taxes for 
millionaires and billionaires. In fact, 56 
percent of that tax cut would go to the 
top 1 percent of wage earners in this 
country. Those are the types of things 
that were included in that bill. It real-
ly was an ideological wish list—noth-
ing more, nothing less, and nothing 
else. 
So for Democratic leaders to come 
down here and suggest for a minute 
that what the House did somehow 
ought to be something that the Senate 
contemplates or considers doing here is 
just completely missing the point of 
what the American people need in this 
crisis, and that is certainty. They need 
to know that we are dealing with the 
health emergency. They need to know 
that there is going to be support there 
for our small businesses, for our work-
ers, for people who are unemployed, 
and for our families. They need to 
know that we are committed to seeing 
that we have the vaccines in place, the 
therapeutics in place that will enable 
us to fight and win this battle against 
the coronavirus. That is what we ought 
to be focused on, not this crazy wish 
list of things that the House, in a short 
amount of time—24 hours—came in 
here to vote on and, as I said earlier, 
much of which was focused on an agen-
da—a more permanent agenda—rather 
than the task at hand, which is ad-
dressing the crisis in front of us. 
I hope my Democratic colleagues will 
work with us in a constructive way and 
in a bipartisan way to deal with the 
very real challenges that are being 
faced by the American people and not 
continue to come down here and advo-
cate for an ideological wish list that, 
one, can’t become law, and two, doesn’t 
deal with the task at hand. 
I yield the floor.

f 
HOLDING FOREIGN COMPANIES 
ACCOUNTABLE ACT 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I 
would like to talk for a few minutes 
about China. 
China, as you know, is a wonderful 
country. It has about 1.4, 1.5 billion 
people. A lot of times, you see reported 
that there are only 1.2 billion, but they 
are a lot bigger than that. America 
only has about 320, 330 million folks. 
By land size, it is about the same size 
as the United States. A lot of people 
think they are the biggest country by 
land in the world, but actually Russia 
is. Canada is No. 2, and China is prob-
ably No. 3 by land size, but we are both 
close. 
I love visiting China. The few times I 
have been there, the people of China 
were just wonderful people—very inter-
esting, very smart, very hard-working, 
very aspirational. I say this because 
when I talk today about China, I want 
you and my colleagues in the Senate to 
understand that I am not talking about 
the people of China. The people of 
China are good people; the Chinese 
Communist Party, not so much. 
I really regret having to say this. I 
would not turn my back on the Chinese 
Communist Party if they were 2 days 
dead. I don’t want to have a Cold War 
with China. I would rather see us work 
together for the common good of the 
planet Earth, and we have tried, but 
that hasn’t worked out real well. 
We admitted China to the World 
Trade Organization on December 11, 
2001. It wasn’t just our decision, but 
you know better than I do that China 
wouldn’t have been admitted to the 
WTO without our support. So we 
agreed—December 11, 2001. China start-
ed cheating December 12. They steal 
our 
intellectual 
property—not 
just 
ours but everyone else’s in the world. 
They steal the world’s intellectual 
property. They substantially subsidize 
their state-owned companies, so other 
companies throughout the world that 
don’t get state subsidies can’t compete 
with them. For years, they manipu-
lated their currency. They are trying 
to control the sea lanes of the world. 
They started in the South China Sea. 
They are seizing islands that don’t be-
long to them. The next step is, they 
will try to militarize space. They have 
used their economic power as a weap-
on. 
Our friends and allies in Australia 
have asked some very reasonable ques-
tions 
about 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
coronavirus and the COVID–19. China 
has responded by saying: We refuse to 
buy any more of your products. Those 
are just the facts. 
Now, the managerial elites told us— 
by that, I mean a lot of the entrenched 
politicians, the deep thinkers of the 
world, the academics, many members 
of the media, the bureaucrats, a lot of 
the corporate phonies, the ones who 
think they are smarter, more virtuous 
than the rest of us in America. They 
told us: Oh, you are wrong about China. 
Be patient with China. Be patient with 
them. Free enterprise will change 
China. 
China has changed free enterprise, 
and China is on a glidepath to domi-
nance. And do you know what the Con-
gress has done about it? Nothing. Zero. 
Zilch. Nada. 
Let me say it again. I love the people 
of China. I am talking about the Chi-
nese Communist Party. And I do not— 
I do not want to get into a new Cold 
War. All I want and I think all the rest 
of us want is for China to play by the 
rules. 
Let me give an example. Every com-
pany in the world that goes public 
would like to list on U.S. stock ex-
changes—the over-the-counter market, 
the S&P, the New York Stock Ex-
change. We are very efficient. We are 
excruciatingly transparent. We like in-
vestors throughout the world to know 
what they are buying. We require com-
panies to disclose. And I think our SEC 
does an extraordinarily able job. I 
think Chairman Jay Clayton has just 
been a rock star. 
We have a rule that if you list on our 
exchanges, you have to file periodic re-
ports. Once again, we want investors to 
understand what they are investing in. 
And those reports have to be accurate, 
or you get in a lot of trouble. One of 
the things, for example, in one of these 
reports that companies have to file is 
an annual audit, but we take it a step 
further in the United States. There is a 
Board within the SEC called the Public 
Company Accounting Oversight Board, 
PCAOB. Really, all that Board does—I 
say ‘‘all’’; it is important—that Board 
inspects the audits that the companies 
file, not because they think the compa-
nies are cheating, although some do. 
But it is like when we play poker with 
friends. I play poker with friends. They 
are my friends, but I cut the cards 
every single time. And that is what our 
SEC does through this Board. They 
say: We are going to double check your 
audits. Everybody has to comply with 
that rule—American companies, Brit-
ish companies, Malaysian companies, 
Turkmenistan companies—except one: 
Chinese companies. They just say: No. 
They just say: No, we are not going to 
do it. And you know what we do about 
it? Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Nada. 
This is not a 2- or 3-month phe-
nomenon. This has gone on for years 
and years and years, and all of us in 
the executive branch and, yes, in Con-
gress, we huff and we puff and we strut 
around and we hold hearings and we 
issue press releases, and then we do 
nothing. And where I come from, what 
you allow is what will continue. 
I have a bill. It is very simple. It says 
to all the companies out there in the 
world, including but not limited to 
China: If you want to list on an Amer-
ican exchange, you have to submit an 
audit. SEC has the right to look at 
that audit and audit the audit, and if 
you refuse not once, not twice, but 
three times—if over a 3-year period, 
each of those 3 years, the company 
says ‘‘You cannot audit my audit,’’ 
then they can no longer be listed on 
the American exchanges. It is very, 
very simple. 
Once again, I tried to be very fair in 
this bill, as did my coauthor, Senator 
CHRIS VAN HOLLEN. We spent a lot of 
time on this. We don’t want to be un-
fair to Chinese companies. We are not 
changing the rules; they have just been 
ignoring the rules. We are saying: 
Look, we are not going to give you just 
one chance; we are going to give you 
three chances. 
If a Chinese company or any other 
company ignores the SEC request, 
what they can do to all the other com-
panies in the world—that is, audit 
their audits—if you ignore the SEC for 
3 years, then you have to take your 
business somewhere else. 
Do you know whom that is going to 
help the most? The investors of Amer-
ica and the investors of the world. 
Most of the companies that are pub-
lic companies I believe tell the truth, 
but some of them don’t, and this is 
hard-earned money that people are in-
vesting. 
The name of our bill—Senator CHRIS 
VAN HOLLEN is the coauthor—is the 
Holding Foreign Companies Account-
able Act, and, as I just explained, it is 
very simple. 
Mr. President, as in legislative ses-
sion, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Committee on Banking, Housing, and 
Urban Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 945 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
A bill (S. 945) to amend the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act of 2002 to require certain issuers to dis-
close to the Securities and Exchange Com-
mission information regarding foreign juris-
dictions that prevent the Public Company 
Accounting 
Oversight 
Board 
from 
per-
forming inspections under that Act, and for 
other purposes. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Kennedy 
substitute amendment at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2520 
May 20, 2020 
The amendment (No. 1589) was agreed 
to as follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Holding For-
eign Companies Accountable Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT. 
Section 104 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 
2002 (15 U.S.C. 7214) is amended by adding at 
the end the following: 
‘‘(i) DISCLOSURE REGARDING FOREIGN JURIS-
DICTIONS THAT PREVENT INSPECTIONS.— 
‘‘(1) DEFINITIONS.—In this subsection— 
‘‘(A) the term ‘covered issuer’ means an 
issuer that is required to file reports under 
section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange 
Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m, 78o(d)); and 
‘‘(B) the term ‘non-inspection year’ means, 
with respect to a covered issuer, a year— 
‘‘(i) during which the Commission identi-
fies the covered issuer under paragraph (2)(A) 
with respect to every report described in sub-
paragraph (A) filed by the covered issuer dur-
ing that year; and 
‘‘(ii) that begins after the date of enact-
ment of this subsection. 
‘‘(2) DISCLOSURE TO COMMISSION.—The Com-
mission shall— 
‘‘(A) identify each covered issuer that, 
with respect to the preparation of the audit 
report on the financial statement of the cov-
ered issuer that is included in a report de-
scribed in paragraph (1)(A) filed by the cov-
ered issuer, retains a registered public ac-
counting firm that has a branch or office 
that— 
‘‘(i) is located in a foreign jurisdiction; and 
‘‘(ii) the Board is unable to inspect or in-
vestigate completely because of a position 
taken by an authority in the foreign juris-
diction described in clause (i), as determined 
by the Board; and 
‘‘(B) require each covered issuer identified 
under subparagraph (A) to, in accordance 
with the rules issued by the Commission 
under paragraph (4), submit to the Commis-
sion documentation that establishes that the 
covered issuer is not owned or controlled by 
a governmental entity in the foreign juris-
diction described in subparagraph (A)(i). 
‘‘(3) TRADING PROHIBITION AFTER 3 YEARS OF 
NON-INSPECTIONS.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—If the Commission de-
termines that a covered issuer has 3 consecu-
tive non-inspection years, the Commission 
shall prohibit the securities of the covered 
issuer from being traded— 
‘‘(i) on a national securities exchange; or 
‘‘(ii) through any other method that is 
within the jurisdiction of the Commission to 
regulate, including through the method of 
trading that is commonly referred to as the 
‘over-the-counter’ trading of securities. 
‘‘(B) REMOVAL OF INITIAL PROHIBITION.—If,

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. KEN-

CHINA 
Mr. SASSE. Mr. President, I had not 
planned to make a floor speech right 
now, but I wanted to commend you on 
both your legislation and on an impor-
tant point that I think you enumerated 
both for this body and for the Ameri-
cans watching. 
First of all, good piece of legislation. 
I supported it. I wanted it to move out 
of the Banking Committee and get to 
the floor. It is important legislation. 
Congratulations, and thanks for your 
leadership. 
Second of all, as you began your 
speech, you distinguished between the 
Chinese people and the Chinese Com-
munist Party. I think many of us are 
worried that the No. 1 long-term na-
tional security threat this country 
faces is the technology race with the 
Chinese Communist Party and the way 
that they use fake private sector com-
panies to steal from U.S. public and 
private sector entities. 
When we talk about the problems— 
those of us who would consider our-
selves China hawks—we regularly end 
up using a shorthand, ‘‘China,’’ when 
we have all spent a lot of time in the 
SCIF and in private, and we know we 
mean the Chinese Communist Party, 
but we don’t always adequately qualify 
that for people who may be entering 
the debate or new to the debate or 
looking to politicize the debate. 
So I think it was very important, the 
points that you made that our enemy 
here is not the 1.4 billion Chinese peo-
ple; our opponent here is the Chinese 
Communist Party, which is only about 
90 million people—6 or 7 percent of the 
population—and even a lot of those 
people don’t actually believe Com-
munist propaganda and nonsense about 
the fact that so many of their people 
and people beyond their borders are not 
perceived by the Chinese Communist 
Party as actually having dignity. Some 
people just join the party because they 
need to for local reasons—to get ahead 
or to maintain their property or their 
entities. 
So the Chinese Communist Party is a 
tiny subset of what is happening in 
China, and our battle, our fight, our 
problems are not with the Chinese peo-
ple; they are with the Chinese Com-
munist Party. 
One of the ways I learned this lesson 
was by having used a shorthand for

Vladimir Putin a few times in the past, 
and I said ‘‘Russia’’ when I meant 
‘‘Vladimir Putin.’’ 
I think the American people stand in-
terested not just in the future of the 
Chinese people but also of the Russian 
people, and both these countries are led 
by some really bad actors. 
One time I made a speech here on the 
floor about some of the terrible things 
Vladimir Putin was doing to oppress 
his people and to meddle in our elec-
tion and other elections. 
After the speech, which I thought 
covered the points I needed to cover, 
Gary Kasparov, the former world chess 
champion, came and said: Can I talk to 
you? 
We went to lunch, and he said: If you 
actually want to fight against Vladi-
mir 
Putin—because 
freedom-loving 
people in the United States and in Rus-
sia should be opposed to Vladimir 
Putin—it would be helpful that you 
not, in disparaging Vladimir Putin, say 
a whole bunch of bad stuff about the 
word ‘‘Russia’’ and you accidentally— 
he said to me—referred to our problem 
as ‘‘Russia’’ when you meant ‘‘Putin.’’ 
I think I have learned that lesson 
with regard to Russia, but I think a lot 
of us around here don’t always suffi-
ciently distinguish between China and 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
So I just wanted to affirm and under-
score your message—not just good leg-
islation that is good for Americans, is 
good for investors in the United States 
and abroad, is good for a level playing 
field, but as we oppose the bad actions 
of the Chinese Communist Party—their 
intellectual property theft and their 
manipulation of currency and numbers 
and public health data and on and on 
and on—our opponent is not the Chi-
nese people, and we should say that 
both so the American people under-
stand it and so that the Chinese people 
understand it. So I commend you on 
the way you introduced your legisla-
tion today. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
MCSALLY). The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I 
rise today to engage in a colloquy with 
Senators CASSIDY, COLLINS, and my fel-
low Senator from New Jersey, Senator 
BOOKER, and I ask unanimous consent 
that they be acknowledged in that 
order and that they be allowed to com-
plete their remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
SMART ACT 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, 
as 
our 
Nation 
grapples 
with 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic, our State, county, 
and municipal governments have been 
on the frontlines taking a leading role 
in responding to this crisis. As a result, 
they have been squeezed on both sides 
of the ledger, spending billions of dol-
lars in unforeseen costs on emergency 
response while watching as revenues 
dry up due to necessary stay-at-home 
orders and the closure of non-essential 
businesses. 
The emergency protective measures 
have been effective at flattening the 
curve and have no doubt saved thou-
sands of lives, but they also came with 
a cost. All revenue sources are down. 
Sales tax revenue has plummeted with 
businesses closed. Highway trust funds 
won’t have the resources to do basic 
road maintenance. Downtown parking 
meters are going empty due to people 
observing social distancing. Building 
permits and municipal court fees have 
fallen. 
Unless we act soon, we will see mass 
layoffs, devastating tax increases, and 
a breakdown in public safety and essen-
tial services. Already, the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics reported that State 
and local governments laid off 1 mil-
lion public employees in April. This 
challenge is true for every State, coun-
ty, city, and town in the country. 
The State Municipal Assistance for 
Response and Transition, or SMART 
Act, is the bold, bipartisan, and com-
monsense solution we need to give our 
communities a fighting chance and 
stop the economy from free-falling. It 
provides $500 billion in flexible Federal 
dollars that will help our communities 
dramatically expand the testing capac-
ity and contact tracing we need to con-
tain the virus—a necessary step in re-
storing consumer confidence and to re-
start the economy. It will help stave 
off massive layoffs, tax hikes, and deep, 
painful cuts to essential services. It 
will keep our police officers, fire-
fighters, public health workers, teach-
ers, and other essential employees on 
the job during this critical time, be-
cause it is not just about defeating 
COVID–19; we still need to keep our 
streets safe, our children learning, the 
trash picked up, the roads maintained, 
and the buses and trains running on 
time. 
I hear some of my colleagues speak 
from this floor, calling not for unity 
but for division. They callously ignore 
the pleas for help from their fellow 
Americans, comforted by the selfish 
but mistaken belief that their commu-
nities are immune to the fiscal Arma-
geddon facing our communities. Let 
me be clear. When your revenues drop 
30 percent overnight, it really doesn’t 
matter how fiscally responsible or con-
servative your State budget is; no one 
can prepare for that. 
Moody’s just reported that States 
like Ohio and Arizona are facing the 
fiscal shock of losing 20 percent of 
their entire budget, and West Virginia, 
40 percent. This is not a red State or 
blue State issue; this is a red, white, 
and blue issue. It is an American pri-
ority. 
In December of 1862, during the 
height of the Civil War, President Lin-
coln wrote the following message to 
Congress: ‘‘In times like the present, 
men should utter nothing for which 
they would not willingly be responsible 
through time and eternity.’’ 
I believe that history will look kind-
ly upon those who stood for unity and 
compromise over demagoguery, those 
who put the well-being of the country 
over scoring partisan points, those who 
stuck out their necks and took a polit-
ical risk for no other reason than it 
was the right thing to do. 
I am proud of the bipartisan coalition 
we have built, and I want to thank 
each of my colleagues for their work 
and their commitment to rebuilding 
our 
communities—Senator 
CASSIDY, 
who has led this effort with me, Sen-
ator HYDE-SMITH; Senator MANCHIN, 
Senator COLLINS, and my partner in 
New Jersey, Senator BOOKER. 
With that, I turn to my friend from 
Louisiana, the distinguished Senator 
who exemplifies these qualities and has 
been an incredible partner in crafting 
this legislation and building this coali-
tion over the past month. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
thank Senator MENENDEZ and return 
the 
compliment. 
We 
have 
worked 
through a lot of issues to find a bill 
that meets a valid, public purpose that 
can pass on a bipartisan basis in both 
Chambers. I thank Senator MENENDEZ 
for working with me on that. 
The title of this bill is the ‘‘SMART 
Act,’’ but in retrospect, I wish we had 
renamed it ‘‘the Thin Blue Line Act’’ 
because this is about helping cities and 
States preserve essential services such 
as police, fire, and education for the re-
opening of our economy. 
Let’s just kind of review. The Federal 
Government asked that State and local 
governments shut down their economy 
in order to control the coronavirus, 
and just like those small businesses 
closed at the behest of the government 
authority, so did State and local gov-
ernments close, if you will, at the be-
hest of the Federal authority. But 
what that did is it devastated the tax 
basis. 
Moody’s, which Senator MENENDEZ 
already alluded to, the independent 
agency that looks at the finances of 
cities and States, has said that if your 
State is dependent upon income tax, 
upon sales tax, upon tourism, and upon 
proceeds from energy, you have been 
hammered. Your tax base has fallen 
dramatically, and with the dramatic 
fall of that tax base comes a dramatic 
fall in the ability to support the thin 
blue 
line—the 
educators, 
the 
fire-
fighters, the you name it, the essential 
services that are essential to the re-
opening of our economy when we come 
out the backside of this epidemic. 
Now, 
it 
has 
already 
happened. 
Moody’s predicts that 3 million of 
these essential workers will be laid off. 
I am told that 1 million already have 
been. You can read about universities 
laying people off, but let’s go back to 
the thin blue line. 
The city of Shreveport, LA, just put 
out a budget in which there is a $20

May 20, 2020 
million hit to their city budget overall, 
and $3.9 million was, unfortunately, 
laid upon law enforcement and 54 posi-
tions eliminated. 
Now, I am told that some Federal 
dollars came through and allowed the 
restoration of some of those positions, 
which, if you will, is a proof in concept 
that if there is help from the Federal 
taxpayer to the State and local tax-
payer—because they are one in the 
same—then, these essential services 
can be preserved. And we know that if 
those police positions are preserved, 
then, that downtown in Shreveport is 
more likely to safely reopen for com-
merce. 
Now, we talked about Moody’s pre-
dicting loss of revenue. Louisiana is 
predicted to lose 45 percent of its rev-
enue, but there are other States af-
fected. New Jersey, Maine, Florida, 
Oklahoma, Michigan, Idaho, Alaska, 
Arizona, and Illinois are all predicted 
to lose large sums of tax revenue. 
So let me speak specifically about 
the SMART Act, or, again, as I call it, 
the ‘‘Thin Blue Line’’ bill. It is a rea-
sonable, bipartisan, ‘‘this is how we go 
forward’’ bill in both Chambers. We 
picked $500 billion. Some would say: 
Well, that is too much. Actually, that 
was the amount of money that Moody’s 
predicts State and local governments 
will lack over the next year and a half. 
So we actually kind of nail where the 
independent agency puts the need for 
our State and our local government, 
and it is targeted. 
One, there has been a lot of concern 
that this would be used to ‘‘bail out 
States,’’ that those who have accumu-
lated a large, unfunded accrued liabil-
ity in their pension funds would use 
that money to support those pension 
funds. We specifically do not allow 
that. So if that is somebody’s political 
concern, that has been addressed. 
What do we do? Well, first, a third of 
the dollars can go out now because it is 
based upon population. This recognizes 
that if California has 31 million people 
and Wyoming has 500,000, there needs 
to be some accommodation for just the 
population size because, inevitably, 
that is going to influence the total 
need. 
The next third will go out at the end 
of June, based upon how hard a State 
was hit in terms of health from the 
coronavirus. So if your State was 
slammed from coronavirus—Louisiana 
was, New Jersey was, and other States 
have been—then, that is where you get 
the help. 
Frankly, it is unfortunate that you 
are getting the help. It would be a lot 
better if your State had not been im-
pacted, but if it has been impacted, it 
is there to support your State through 
the health aspect of this crisis. 
The last third will go out at end of 
this calendar year. That is based upon 
the financial hit that your State has 
taken. So if your State’s tax base has 
been decreased by 45 percent, then, you 
would get additional dollars in the 
third tranche of money, which comes 
out at the end of the calendar year. Ob-
viously, at the end of this calendar 
year is almost beyond the fiscal year 
for most States, and so that would 
place the dollars at the State’s disposal 
for the next fiscal year. In that way, 
we cover this prolonged period that 
Moody’s says that State and local gov-
ernments will be out. 
There is one more concern, and that 
is whether or not all this money will go 
to a Governor’s office and none will go 
to counties or parishes or municipali-
ties in Louisiana. One-third of the dol-
lars will go directly to municipalities 
and counties—those local governments 
that are on the forefront of providing 
services to those who are being affected 
by the coronavirus epidemic. 
We think we have something which 
balances the needs of stakeholders—the 
most important stakeholder being the 
American citizen—that both addresses 
the need for fiscal accountability and 
the need to preserve those essential 
government services to get our econ-
omy going once more. 
Again, I am going to ask all of my 
colleagues to support the ‘‘Thin Blue 
Line’’ bill, otherwise known as the 
SMART Act. I think it is a smart way 
to go forward to make sure we don’t 
slip into a recession, but we return 
with as robust an economy from this 
crisis as when we entered the crisis. 
With that, I will yield to my col-
league from Maine. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I 
am pleased to be a cosponsor of the 
SMART Act, and I want to commend 
Senator MENENDEZ and Senator CAS-
SIDY for their tremendous leadership. 
Our bill would help offset the collapse 
of State and local revenues resulting 
from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The coronavirus has already claimed 
the lives of more than 90,000 Ameri-
cans. As the virus damages our health 
and deprives us of our loved ones, it 
has also devastated our communities 
and our economy. 
As of last week, nearly 20 percent of 
Maine’s total civilian workforce had 
filed for unemployment. The tourism 
sector has been particularly hard hit, 
and this is so important to my State. 
But the fact is that no industrial sec-
tor has been immune from this disease. 
Restaurants and hotels in southern 
Maine face uncertainty, not knowing 
when or even if they will ever reopen. 
As a result of having to cancel non-
essential surgeries, many hospitals are 
struggling to stay open. Lobstermen 
and fishermen have lost major mar-
kets. Potato farmers may be unable to 
sell more than $22 million worth of 
their 2019 crop. The motor coach indus-
try has been devastated. In short, 
working 
families 
and 
communities 
across the State of Maine have been hit 
hard. 
Moody’s forecasts that Maine may 
face one of the worst impacts in the en-
tire country in terms of lost revenues. 
Eighty-five percent of Maine’s State 
revenues are from income and sales 
taxes. They have plummeted. Gas tax 
revenues have tanked. These projected 
shortfalls threaten vital State and 
local services. 
One in six Mainers is employed in the 
public sector. These are the individuals 
who keep our communities and our 
citizens safe: the police officers, the 
firefighters, the EMS personnel. They 
provide healthcare and education. They 
maintain our roads and our bridges. 
When I visited the Orono Fire De-
partment recently to deliver some 
much needed masks, the town manager 
told me that the decline in excise taxes 
has been devastating for this town. 
Maine communities tell me that they 
will have no choice but to either in-
crease property taxes, at the worst pos-
sible time for working families, or 
eliminate first responder jobs and slash 
education funding if they do not re-
ceive help. 
The SMART Act would help to avoid 
the worst of these consequences by pro-
viding $500 billion in Federal relief to 
State, local, and Tribal governments. 
Unlike the CARES Act, where only big 
cities were eligible for assistance, 
under our bill every county and every 
community would be eligible for fund-
ing. Maine would receive at least $2 bil-
lion, including about $330 million for 
counties and $330 million for commu-
nities. And the $1.25 billion that we al-
ready appropriated for assistance to 
State governments under the CARES 
Act would be made much more flexible 
so it could be used to offset these dra-
matic revenue shortfalls. 
The fallout from the coronavirus is 
unprecedented. Congress has a tremen-
dous responsibility to help mitigate 
the impact of this crisis on our States 
and our local communities and on the 
families they serve. We must not wait. 
We should act now. 
Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. BOOKER. Madam President, I 
thank Senators CASSIDY and MENENDEZ 
for leading on this extraordinary bill 
and the broad bipartisan support that 
it has. 
I know Senator MENENDEZ and I have 
both been mayors in our communities, 
and when there is no crisis, we know 
intimately the challenges that so many 
of our public servants face. In times 
when we do not see pandemics, our fire-
fighters put their lives on the line, our 
police officers put their lives on the 
line, and our teachers extraordinarily 
work above and beyond the call of 
duty. Indeed, our communities are 
strong because of these dedicated pub-
lic workers. 
At a time of crisis, we see that our 
teachers are rising to the challenge, 
working to keep their students en-
gaged, even though they are now miles 
apart. I hear stories of teachers riding 
around, going out to visit students, 
keeping their distance but ensuring 
that the students get the support they 
need.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2523 
May 20, 2020 
Our firefighters are out there now, 
putting their lives even more at a risk, 
putting themselves on the line to help 
their communities. 
Police officers are answering calls 
without hesitation, despite the great 
risk that puts on them and their fami-
lies when they go home. 
So many of our other public servants 
are working diligently to keep our 
communities running, to keep our 
States strong to meet a crisis, and to 
try to help folks stay healthy and stay 
safe. Without hesitation, across New 
Jersey—across all of our 50 States—we 
are seeing more clearly the heroic ac-
tions of people who are leading in a 
time of crisis. 
But as was said by my colleagues, 
across the country, States are being 
hit by significantly declining revenues 
and extraordinarily increasing costs. 
We are already seeing early projec-
tions, as discussed by my colleagues. 
Even independent rating agencies like 
Moody’s are talking about hundreds of 
billions of dollars in deficits for our 
State and local governments. 
My own Governor has estimated New 
Jersey’s protracted gap caused by 
those declining revenues—those ex-
tremely rising costs—to be somewhere 
between $20 and $30 billion. 
Due to these shortfalls, without im-
mediate action from Congress, State 
and local governments will be forced to 
make deep cuts to public services, in-
cluding laying off folks who are not 
just essential in word but who often 
make the difference between life and 
death, safety or crisis in our commu-
nities. These would be the workers who 
would be laid off at a time when we 
need them the most. 
Not only do we need these vital pub-
lic servants on the job, protecting our 
communities, educating our kids, and 
supporting our neighbors, but cuts like 
these actually will aggravate and deep-
en the overall economic crisis facing 
our country. Independent rating agen-
cies and others say that cuts like these 
will actually prolong our economic cri-
sis and the time needed for recovery. 
This is not the time for half measures. 
This is the time to act at the scale that 
the crisis demands. 
The Federal Government needs to be 
providing a robust, accurately tailored 
response to this crisis by funding our 
State and local governments in a way 
that prioritizes those areas that have 
been hit the hardest. The SMART Act 
does exactly that. It is a bipartisan 
bill. It is thoughtful. It is tailored nar-
rowly to fit this crisis. 
The SMART Act is a commonsense 
approach that will make sure that the 
help is going to where it is needed 
most—to our hardest hit communities 
and States—and to help ensure that 
those workers whom we hail with our 
words—firefighters, police officers, and 
teachers—we support with our actions, 
as well, for they are out there right 
now supporting us. 
No State should go bankrupt fighting 
this virus, because of this virus. No 
State should go bankrupt because we 
in the Federal Government refuse to 
support them. No essential public 
worker should lose their job because of 
this crisis and because Congress was 
not stepping up to lead through it. 
There is no time to waste. As was 
said by my colleague, we have folks in 
my State who are putting together 
their budgets right now. As we heard 
from my colleague from Louisiana, 
they are already accounting for the 
need to make cuts. We have already 
seen hundreds of thousands of public 
workers being laid off. The delay has 
costs, and when you are talking about 
first responders, the delays can have 
costs that are hard to imagine. 
I encourage my colleagues to see this 
as what it is. It is an accurately tai-
lored response. It is a bipartisan bill. It 
is what our Nation needs right now. I 
encourage my colleagues in the Senate 
to work to get this to the floor so that 
we can vote on it, pass it, and get it 
through Congress to the President’s 
desk, so we can avoid the storm that 
we are in and, ultimately, overcome 
the severity of its ravages. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent to complete 
my remarks before the 12:30 p.m. vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S.A. RISE 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. Madam President, 
8 weeks ago today, the Senate passed 
the CARES Act, an unprecedented $2.2 
trillion package of legislation aimed at 
providing relief as our country took 
steps to respond to the threat of 
COVID–19. 
Previously, we passed legislation to 
expand free access to testing and paid 
leave, accelerate vaccines and treat-
ments, and to support the Federal 
agencies leading our pandemic re-
sponse. 
The CARES Act was designed to sup-
port the health of our citizens and the 
economy. It included direct payments 
to American families, grants to hos-
pitals, and the Paycheck Protection 
Program—forgivable loans to small 
businesses to keep their employees on 
the payroll. The program was so suc-
cessful that a month later, Congress 
approved the additional $310 billion for 
PPP loans, $75 billion for hospitals, and 
$25 billion for testing. 
Georgia hospitals have received over 
$1.7 billion, including at least $328 mil-
lion for our rural businesses under the 
CARES Act. 
I worked to include provisions in the 
CARES Act to expand rural health and 
telehealth program. Our State has re-
ceived more than $800,000 from these 
programs. They are helping Georgians 
across our State stay connected with 
their doctors from the safety of their 
own homes. 
In addition, our State and local gov-
ernments have received $5.8 billion to 
help schools adjust to online learning, 
to provide assistance for those who lost 
their jobs or homes, to keep our air-
ports running, and to help our commu-
nities respond and serve in this chal-
lenging moment. 
The action Congress took has helped 
to meet immediate challenges, but it is 
clear the pandemic has caused signifi-
cant human suffering and staggering 
economic losses. 
In the last 2 months, I have heard 
from hundreds suffering the effects of 
this outbreak and the response: first 
responders, doctors, and nurses on the 
frontline, small business owners and 
farmers who have seen the viability of 
their businesses threatened, families 
who have suffered job losses, children 
who are out of school, and food banks 
that have seen an unprecedented surge 
in demand. 
Before 
this 
pandemic, 
Americans 
were enjoying a thriving economy, 
with the lowest unemployment rate in 
50 years. Under the leadership of the 
Trump administration, more families 
were on their way to living the Amer-
ican dream. Then, in late March, the 
day after the Senate passed the CARES 
Act, we learned that a record 3.3 mil-
lion workers had applied for initial un-
employment benefits in a single week. 
The total is now a staggering 36.5 mil-
lion Americans who filed initial jobless 
claims. This is more than the combined 
populations of Georgia, Pennsylvania, 
and Ohio. 
In my State, more than one in three 
Georgians have lost their jobs. Watch-
ing this unfold, despite the relief of the 
CARES Act, I recognize that it is time 
to look beyond the immediate response 
and to focus on our recovery. As a 
member of the President’s Opening Up 
America Again Congressional Group, I 
am putting my nearly three decades of 
experience in building companies and 
creating jobs and opportunities to 
work for Georgians. With my experi-
ence and the conversations I have had 
with Georgians, I developed a U.S.A. 
Restoring and Igniting the Strength of 
Our Economy plan—or U.S.A. Rise—to 
bring back our thriving economy. The 
four pillars of the plan are Made in the 
U.S.A., Grown in the U.S.A., Hiring in 
the U.S.A., and Families in the U.S.A. 
I started to introduce legislative pro-
posals based on this four-pillar frame-
work that incentivize companies to in-
vest in America, to grow jobs, and to 
help families. 
I would like to highlight one of those 
pillars today, Families in the U.S.A. 
First, we mourn the loss of those to 
COVID–19. The toll of this has dev-
astated thousands of families. It is also 
clear 
that 
with 
economic 
damage 
comes societal damage. Our country 
needed to take dramatic actions to 
flatten the curve, but those steps 
meant most Americans were confined 
to their homes. This meant work from 
home, school from home, but also, in 
too many instances, lost jobs, isola-
tion, depression, suicide, and domestic, 
substance, and child abuse. 
It is timely that May is Mental 
Health Awareness Month. In a recent

Atlanta 
Journal-Constitution 
op-ed, 
Eve Byrd and Jennifer Olsen of the 
Cardinal Center wrote: ‘‘Isolation is 
one of the cruelest components of the 
outbreak.’’ 
Last week, I spoke with the head of a 
mental health treatment facility in 
Georgia. They are seeing a significant 
spike in those reaching out for help. 
The waitlist is growing, and the de-
mand for help is rising rapidly. An 
emergency hotline run by the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Services Ad-
ministration in HHS saw a 1,000-per-
cent increase in calls in just 1 month. 
That was this April compared to last 
April. 
I have spoken with local law enforce-
ment officials who have seen a serious 
spike in domestic abuse calls. The na-
tionwide Crisis Text Line has seen a 78- 
percent increase in texts related to do-
mestic violence across our country. 
The millions of Americans who have 
lost their jobs or their businesses are 
suffering. 
Tiffany, a mother of three from Col-
lege Park, GA, was furloughed from her 
steady job stocking store shelves. She 
said: ‘‘It is very overwhelming when 
you have rent, when you have children 
to take care of.’’ When a parent loses 
their job, they lose much more. They 
lose their ability to put food on the 
table, to pay rent, and the uncertainty 
grows for children. It is vital to help 
families weather this crisis. 
We know that Americans who have a 
steady paycheck are more likely to 
have stable, secure families, and chil-
dren from stable families are more 
likely to do well in school. That is why 
I have designed the USA RISE Plan as 
an economic framework that takes the 
human cost of the coronavirus into ac-
count. Helping families and job cre-
ation today will allow parents to get 
back to work and reduce the fallout 
from this pandemic from permanently 
impacting an entire generation. 
Importantly, this does not mean we 
should expand the grip of the Federal 
Government. An American Enterprise 
Institute 
report 
on 
achieving 
the 
American dream, released just a few 
weeks ago, states: 
The power of community has become all 
the more poignant as we retreated more to 
isolated lives required by social distancing. 
Oftentimes, local institutions and neighbor-
hoods have a greater influence on economic 
outcomes than what is occurring at the Fed-
eral level. 
Being in Washington working on be-
half of our State, I see that local im-
pact firsthand. Often, these organiza-
tions are at the heart of our commu-
nities. It is where people turn for help, 
for a sense of belonging. 
Churches and other nonprofits are 
doing amazing work during this very 
difficult time. They have been pro-
viding childcare, meals, and other sup-
port for family and children. For exam-
ple, YMCAs are the largest provider of 
childcare 
in 
Georgia. 
Many 
have 
stepped up to provide childcare for es-
sential workers. They are providing 
thousands of meals each week to help 
out needy families. 
That is why last week I introduced 
legislation, the Limiting Infant Fatal-
ity and Empowering Nonprofit Organi-
zation Workforces Act, or LIFE NOW 
Act. It allows larger nonprofits access 
to the Paycheck Protection Program 
loans. These loans will help them keep 
their doors open and continue to serve 
their communities while ensuring that 
no taxpayer dollars go to abortion pro-
viders. 
Yesterday, I introduced the Working 
Families Childcare Access Act. This 
will give more working families more 
flexibility by allowing parents to con-
tribute more to their employer-spon-
sored dependent care cafeteria flexible 
spending account, or FSA. If a family 
doesn’t use all their funds in 1 year, 
any leftover funds can be rolled over to 
the following year. This will help fami-
lies make plans for childcare as they 
begin to go back to work. 
I am continuing to work on addi-
tional legislation to provide families 
with targeted relief—for example, a bill 
to codify the Trump administration 
regulations to help Americans who re-
cently lost their jobs and their health 
insurance. The Trump administration 
expanded short-term, limited-duration 
health insurance plans after President 
Obama substantially restricted those 
plans just 2 months before he left of-
fice. These plans had previously been 
available for nearly 20 years. They are 
an affordable option for Americans who 
are in between jobs or who have been 
laid off. 
The 
dramatic 
economic 
numbers 
alone do not convey the full cost of 
this pandemic—the futures impacted, 
the isolation, domestic abuse, sub-
stance abuse, and suicide. As our coun-
try begins to look forward amid the 
coronavirus pandemic, we must sup-
port job growth and families to build 
strong futures. 
In the coming weeks, I will introduce 
additional bills as part of the USA 
RISE Plan aimed at incentivizing man-
ufacturing in the United States, help-
ing our farmers and small business 
owners, and to ensure that America is 
the best place in the world to do busi-
ness. 
While I continue to do all I can to 
fight COVID–19, I will also continue to 
do all I can to help Georgia families 
and employers recover and prosper. 
I yield the floor.

CHINA 
Mr. HAWLEY. Madam President, we 
have come to the middle hour of our 
struggle against this epidemic, against 
a disease unleashed on the world by the 
failures and falsehoods of a government 
in Beijing. This epidemic has brought 
devastation in its wake—lost jobs, lost 
lives, fear, and isolation. It is shaking 
old institutions and challenging old 
ways. 
The international order, as we have 
known it for 30 years, is breaking. Now 
imperialist China seeks to remake the 
world in its own image and to bend the 
global economy to its own will, and we 
face a moment of truth. Will we acqui-
esce? Are we, in this Nation, willing to 
witness the slow undoing of the free 
world? Are we willing to watch our own 
way of life, our own liberties and liveli-
hoods grow dependent on the policy of 
Beijing? 
Already, we hear a chorus of voices 
telling us that America must accept a 
narrower future. We must live with 
slower economic growth. We must ex-
pect lower wages. We must accommo-
date ourselves to the rise of China. 
Well, I, for one, am not willing to set-
tle for less. I am not willing to see blue 
collar workers go without work for 
months or years on end as their jobs 
are shipped overseas. I am not willing 
to watch wages flatline and fall. I am 
not willing to see families struggle for 
food and middle-class neighborhoods 
disappear, and neither are the Amer-
ican people. 
The Nation that sent a man to the 
Moon and defeated German and Soviet 
oppression in the space of 50 years will 
not be content to take second place to 
the imperialists in Beijing. We will not 
be content with a small future. Now, as 
in times past, this Nation must again 
take control of our own destiny and 
lead the free world to a better day. 
The free nations again confront a 
common threat. The Chinese Com-
munist Party is a menace to all free 
peoples. It seeks nothing less than 
domination. It wants nothing less than 
word power. This is China’s policy: to 
control Asia and to rule the Pacific. 
From there, the Chinese Government 
wants to spread its influence to Africa, 
to Europe, to South America—a master 
of home and abroad. 
And they are well on their way. For 
decades now, China has bent and 
abused and broken the rules of the 
international economic system to its 
own benefit. They have stolen our in-
tellectual property and forced our com-
panies to transfer sensitive trade se-
crets and technology. They have ma-
nipulated their currency and cheated 
time and again on their trade commit-
ments. They have been complicit in the 
trafficking of persons and relied on the 
forced labor of religious minorities. 
America has suffered. Since Beijing 
won most favored nation status and 
joined the World Trade Organization in 
2001, we have lost over 3 million jobs to 
China. During the past two decades, as 
we fought war after war in the Middle 
East, the Chinese Government system-
atically built its military on the backs 
of the American middle class. Oh, we 
were promised that things would be dif-
ferent. We were told that giving China 
access to our markets and allowing 
them power in the WTO would reform 
their behavior and it would make them 
more liberal. We were told it would be 
good for America and good for the 
world. 
Well, the only nation it was good for 
was China, and we cannot afford inac-
tion any longer. The threat of China to 
the free world grows by the day. If the 
coronavirus pandemic doesn’t make 
that clear, nothing will. What should 
be equally clear is that the United 
States must now reform the global 
economy itself to rebuild our strength 
and prevent China’s bid for domina-
tion. 
The economy has become the prin-
cipal arena for the great power contest 
in this new century. Economic policy is 
now security policy, and China under-
stands that. China has integrated its 
economic and security strategies for 
the last two decades, systematically 
weaponizing the institutions and proce-
dures of the global economy for its own 
benefit. 
It is the United States that has been 
slow to respond. Now we must recog-
nize that the economic system de-
signed by Western policymakers at the 
end of the Cold War does not serve our 
purposes in this new era, and it does 
not meet our needs in this new day. 
And we should admit that multiple of 
its founding premises were in error. 
The economic system over the last 30 
years—it is nothing sacred. It is not in-
evitable. It was a choice, and now we 
have the power to choose again, to 
choose differently, and for the better. 
You know, it didn’t start out this 
way. Decades ago, in the aftermath of 
the Second World War, the United 
States and its allies created a series of 
economic partnerships and institutions 
that aimed to strengthen the free 
world and check Soviet expansion. 
These agreements encouraged partner-
ship and trade among free nations as 
sovereign equals. Trade in commerce 
did increase and barriers did come 
down, but nations remained in control 
of their own economies and their own 
destinies. Important sectors were pro-
tected, capital flows controlled, and 
workers had a place to rise. 
But when the Soviet Union fell, am-
bitious policymakers in this country 
and other Western nations saw the op-
portunity to create something new, 
something in the spirit of Woodrow 
Wilson, a dream to remake the world. 
These Western leaders wanted a truly 
global economy, one that would in-
clude all nations, like-minded or not, 
to be governed by multilateral institu-
tions rather than nation-states, to op-
erate by a single set of rules, to pro-
mote the flow of goods and capital 
across borders. They wanted a single 
liberal market to support a single lib-
eral international order, one that was 
supposed to bring peace in our time. 
Well, that peace never arrived. Instead, 
these new Wilsonians embroiled the 
United States in conflict after conflict, 
war after war for decades, and the new 
global 
market 
they 
championed 
flatlined the wages of American work-
ers and shifted American industry 
overseas, all while multinational cor-
porations reaped the gains. 
One of the Wilsonians’ new institu-
tions 
particularly 
typified 
these 
trends. I am talking about the World 
Trade Organization. It was established 
in 1995 as a successor to the Cold War- 
era General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade. The idea was for the WTO to 
help harmonize trading rules the world 
over and have the teeth to enforce 
them. 
The WTO would have its own court— 
I was part of the design—a dispute res-
olution body that would interpret 
trade agreements and settle the dif-
ferences between nations over trade. 
The effect was to take trade disputes 
out of the hands of elected national 
leaders and commit them to the con-
trol of international lawyers in Gene-
va. 
It worked in the sense that the 
WTO’s court increasingly set trade pol-
icy for the world. The old system, the 
GATT, had allowed for national policy 
needs to come first—our workers and 
our industries—but the WTO reversed 
these priorities. Now global concerns 
reigned supreme, which meant the pri-
orities of multinational corporations 
and global capital. 
Not surprisingly, the WTO lawyers 
have not been kind to America. The 
WTO’s dispute resolution process has 
systematically disfavored the United 
States—a complaint that Presidents of 
both parties have made for years. The 
United States has lost 90 percent of the 
cases brought against it, hurting indus-
tries across the Nation, from steel-
workers in the Rust Belt to cotton 
farmers in States like mine. 
Meanwhile, the WTO dispute resolu-
tion body has systematically expanded 
its own jurisdiction, going beyond the 
text of the actual trade agreements 
and citing itself as authority. 
That is not all. The WTO permitted 
China to claim special status as a de-
veloping country from the moment

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2526 
May 20, 2020 
China entered the organization even 
though China was already the sixth 
richest nation in the world by GDP in 
the year 2000. China jealously guards 
that sweetheart deal even today, allow-
ing it to defer its obligations, to skirt 
the rules we follow, and to continue to 
amass power at our expense. 
I could go on. 
The WTO places strict limits on the 
support we can provide our farmers and 
ranchers, even as other nations refuse 
to comply with WTO rulings in favor of 
our producers. 
It is clear that the WTO is deeply 
flawed. The institution’s design makes 
it nearly impossible to reform, as we 
saw during the failed go-around, and it 
remains completely ill-equipped to deal 
with forced technology transfer and in-
tellectual property theft like we have 
seen from China for decades. 
The American people get the idea. No 
trade regime can last when it no longer 
serves the people of the countries that 
are part of it. The truth is, our inter-
ests and those of the WTO diverged 
many years ago. The WTO is a symbol 
of an economic order whose Wilsonian 
ambitions have cost this country dear-
ly, enabling and empowering the rise of 
an imperialist China. 
Now, American leadership is re-
quired—it is essential—to chart a new 
course. This Nation has never been 
content to linger in the rear while oth-
ers lead the way, and we will not begin 
now. We will lead. We will act. 
I call on this body to do its part by 
taking a vote to withdraw from the 
WTO. The agreement by which we 
joined that organization expressly af-
fords us this right. It commits to Con-
gress—both Houses—the right to de-
bate the WTO’s workings and the right 
to vote to continue in the WTO or to 
withdraw. This is a right—it is our re-
sponsibility, really—that the Senate 
has never exercised since 1995, not one 
time. We are past due. 
We should take up our responsibility 
and debate this issue critical to the fu-
ture of our country, and we should vote 
to leave. To begin a new era, we must 
end the old. So let’s vote, and let it be 
a new beginning. Let the work begin in 
earnest to forge a new way forward. 
Thinking of that future, I offer two 
principles to guide our policy. 
First, as a member of the world econ-
omy, we must never privilege the pref-
erences of other nations or multilat-
eral institutions over the needs of our 
own people and our own workers. As 
the leader of the free world, we must 
empower other countries to resist Chi-
nese imperialism at every turn, wheth-
er on their own or standing together 
with us as a coalition. 
To put these principles into action, 
we must leave the WTO and construct 
a new trade system that helps the 
United States grow strong. This new 
system should retain and deepen the 
principle of reciprocity. It should en-
courage cooperation and market access 
but without compromising nations’ 
economic sovereignty and their inter-
nal control of their own economies. 
We in America cannot compromise 
our sovereign right to protect the 
American people and their livelihoods, 
so we must replace an empire of law-
yers with the confederation of truly 
mutual trade. Mutual trade will re-
quire a new approach to dispute resolu-
tion, one that will offer nations flexi-
bility and choice, allow countries to 
litigate trade disputes like a private 
contract, through third-party arbitra-
tion chosen by the parties on a case-by- 
case basis, with ground rules agreed 
upon by both sides and subject to revi-
sions as circumstances warrant, or 
allow countries to set up enforcement 
procedures within the trade agree-
ments themselves, like we have done in 
our recent phase 1 negotiations with 
China. On either approach, choices over 
trade will be made and policies will be 
set, as they should be, by elected lead-
ers who are accountable to the people, 
not by a court sitting in Geneva. 
But reform should not stop at trade. 
We must also think seriously about 
what occurs upstream from trade, and 
that means global capital. There is a 
reason why Wall Street loves the sta-
tus quo. There is a reason why they 
will object to leaving the WTO and re-
sist major reforms to our global eco-
nomic order. That is because they are 
on a gravy train of foreign capital 
flows that keep their checkbooks fat. 
But this foreign money pouring into 
our country has a distorting effect. We 
get asset bubbles that could spur reces-
sions, and our exporters have trouble 
selling abroad. Our farmers and pro-
ducers know this problem all too well. 
So now we must work for new agree-
ments and better managed capital mar-
kets to stop currency manipulators and 
to protect this Nation’s producers. By 
moderating 
these 
flows 
of 
foreign 
money, we can help give a much needed 
boost to our producers at home and fi-
nally reverse our massive trade deficit 
with China and with the world. 
Finally, actions at home are only 
part of the solution. Trade and current 
policy, after all, are not made in a vac-
uum. The world is changing, and if we 
are to halt China’s bid for hegemony 
over the coming decades, we will need 
to work with our allies and partners to 
do it. So it is in America’s interest to 
see that other free nations grow strong 
and that we are able to work together 
to deter and defeat Chinese economic 
coercion. 
We benefit if countries that share our 
opposition to Chinese imperialism— 
countries like India, Japan, Vietnam, 
Australia, and Taiwan—are economi-
cally independent of China and stand-
ing shoulder to shoulder with us. So we 
should actively pursue new networks of 
mutual trade with key Asian and Euro-
pean partners, like the economic pros-
perity network recently mentioned by 
Secretary Pompeo. 
We should offer partner nations new 
incentives to support the purchase of 
our products made here in America by 
American workers. A new system of ex-
port financing and loan guarantees 
would serve as a powerful counter-
weight to China’s expanding Belt and 
Road Initiative, and it would boost de-
mand for our products, raising wages 
and creating good jobs along the way. 
Here again, our aim must be to build 
networks of strong partners able to 
stand tall against Chinese aggression 
while strengthening our workers and 
fostering our industries. 
A new departure is upon us whether 
we like it or not. The old order is giv-
ing way. The future need not be lim-
ited, however, not for this country. 
This moment is full of promise if we 
have the courage to lead. 
We can build a future that looks be-
yond pandemic to prosperity—a pros-
perity shared by all Americans, from 
the rural towns of our country to the 
urban core. 
We can build a future that looks past 
a failed consensus to meet the national 
security needs of this new century. 
We can build a future that transcends 
the narrow thinking of the Washington 
beltway and that gives confidence to 
American workers and to the commu-
nities they call home. 
With a global economy that better 
suits our interests, that better protects 
our people, we can find the strength 
and purpose to counter the gravest 
danger to American workers in a cen-
tury and to unleash again the promise 
of our unique and marvelous way of 
life. 
To my colleagues in the Senate, I 
say: It is time to lead. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa is recognized. 
POLITICAL PRISONERS 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
rise for two reasons: one, for a very 
short comment on political prisoners 
in foreign lands, and the other one on 
how the CARES Act is developing and 
the reaction to it. 
First of all, our country is now hope-
fully recovering from COVID–19, so I 
want to take this opportunity to ad-
dress the plight of an extremely vul-
nerable population—political prisoners 
abroad. 
In Turkey, Syria, China, and a lot of 
other countries, political prisoners re-
main locked away in crowded prisons 
without adequate medical care. The 
spread of COVID–19 among this popu-
lation dramatically increases the risk 
of serious medical consequences or 
even death. 
Authoritarian regimes only risk fur-
ther destabilization of their countries 
by jailing the innocent. Political pris-
oners ought to be released, and they 
ought to be released now. 
HEROES ACT 
Madam President, at the beginning of 
March, we worked to get ahead of the 
COVID pandemic, and an amazing 
thing happened. Congress came to-
gether quickly and developed a broad 
package of measures to provide relief 
to families, workers, and businesses to 
weather the COVID–19 event and the 
crisis that it is.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2527 
May 20, 2020 
Coronavirus aid, relief, and economic 
security—those words make up the 
CARES Act—included a broad range of 
tools: first, direct payments to individ-
uals and families; second, it expanded 
unemployment insurance benefits for 
the unemployed; third, lending pro-
grams for businesses of all sizes; and 
fourth, targeted tax relief to help busi-
nesses continue operations and keep 
workers on the payroll. 
Our objective for the tax provisions 
in the CARES Act was twofold: first, to 
help individuals, families, and busi-
nesses weather the storm caused by the 
stay-at-home governmental decisions, 
and second, lay as much of a founda-
tion as possible for restarting the econ-
omy once businesses could start to re-
open and Americans could get back to 
work. 
The 
CARES 
Act 
came 
together 
through a bipartisan process, and that 
process took place over 8 short days 
and ultimately and amazingly passed 
the Senate 96 to 0 on March 25. The 
House passed it by a voice vote 2 days 
later, and President Trump signed it 
into law that same day. 
As chairman of the Finance Com-
mittee, my approach for tax relief was 
to provide as much liquidity as possible 
and as quickly as possible. For individ-
uals, that meant providing the Treas-
ury Department with authority to 
issue nearly $300 billion in economic 
impact payments to families across the 
Nation. This economic impact payment 
was $1,200 for an individual, $2,400 for a 
couple, and $500 for each child. That 
went out in checks or direct deposit. It 
also meant giving individuals access to 
cash 
in 
retirement 
accounts, 
sus-
pending required distributions from re-
tirement accounts already hit by steep 
declines in the stock market, and giv-
ing employers more flexibility to help 
employees with student loan payments. 
Many of these tools are similar to 
ones made available to help families 
recover from natural disasters in re-
cent years. So we were not reinventing 
policy for this pandemic; we were mak-
ing use of things we had already tried 
before. Each of these changes I just 
mentioned is a tool that can be imple-
mented very quickly to help families 
access the care they need to get 
through these difficult times. 
Going through the business tax relief 
measures, our approach was to modify 
existing provisions of the Tax Code, 
easing limits and restrictions so that 
businesses could apply for this help 
easily and quickly. The key was for 
businesses to keep cash on hand if they 
hadn’t already filed or give refunds to 
give them the liquidity to keep the 
doors open, the machinery running, 
and most importantly, employees paid, 
at least to the greatest extent possible. 
Most of these tax measures have been 
employed in previous economic crises 
and natural disasters. Again, these 
policies 
were 
not 
reinventing 
the 
wheel; we were taking advantage of 
things that had worked in the past. 
Particularly, we expanded the ability 
of businesses to use net operating 
losses—or, as we call them in tax jar-
gon, NOLs—just like Congress did in 
2002 after 9/11, in 2005 for taxpayers af-
fected by Hurricane Katrina, and again 
in 2009 after the financial crisis. 
Those were actually bipartisan relief 
efforts just like the CARES Act. These 
provisions are temporary. They are de-
signed to terminate after the recovery 
is in full force. 
While it seems longer, you have to 
remember the CARES Act was enacted 
just over 7 weeks ago. In that time, 
Treasury has distributed economic im-
pact payments far faster than ex-
pected. Americans have received ap-
proximately 140 million economic im-
pact payments worth $249 billion. Over 
4.3 million small businesses have been 
approved for more than $500 billion of 
loans under the Paycheck Protection 
Program and businesses of all sizes 
have started to use the tax tools that 
we provided for their liquidity. 
But in that time, the critics have 
also done what they do best: They 
criticize. The media has seized on an 
opportunity to perpetuate every nega-
tive story that critics can manufac-
ture. You can imagine my surprise 
when Democrats criticized the net op-
erating loss carryback provisions in 
the CARES Act. Oddly, Democrats pre-
viously supported the last three bills, 
where we expanded the net operating 
loss carrybacks in 2002, 2005, and even 
in 2009—in the last instance, with all- 
Democratic rule. 
I don’t recall, in any of those in-
stances, any partisan attacks from 
Democrats about this previously bipar-
tisan, anti-recessionary policy tools. 
So why now? Sadly, that irrespon-
sibility has led our Democratic col-
leagues in the House to pass legislation 
that would take back important tax 
tools that we have provided in the 
CARES Act to the tune of $254 billion, 
and that is a tax increase on the Amer-
ican businesses, and with more taxes, 
less employees. 
It is hard to understand how the 
House Democrats think that this pol-
icy makes any sense. Imposing tax in-
creases when you have a downturn— 
imposing a quarter of a trillion dollar 
retroactive tax increase on businesses 
in need of cash to restart their oper-
ations as States begin to lift shutdown 
orders—is a recipe for further disaster, 
as opposed to the disaster we are al-
ready in. 
It makes one think that House 
Democrats don’t want an economic re-
covery, at least until they can defeat 
President Trump. Imposing such a tax 
increase when the country is facing un-
employment levels not seen since the 
Great Depression fails the common 
sense test. 
It is even more disturbing to the ex-
tent that the House Democrats’ pro-
posal targets small businesses and 
other 
pass-through 
entities. 
Aren’t 
these losses just as real as larger cor-
porations and their need for liquidity 
possibly even greater? 
According to the Tax Foundation, 
more than 90 percent of American busi-
nesses in recent years operate as pass- 
through entities. Pass-through busi-
nesses include some of those hardest 
hit by this pandemic we are in, like 
farmers, restaurants, manufacturers, 
retailers, and healthcare providers. 
They employ over half of America’s 
workers. Yet the Democrats want to 
take them on. 
It is critical that these businesses 
also survive this pandemic to ensure 
that Americans have jobs to return to 
as it becomes safe to go back to work. 
I have heard some critics even suggest 
that allowing small businesses and 
pass-throughs to use their net oper-
ating losses is kind of a tax gimmick or 
loophole. Apparently, they don’t under-
stand that these are real economic 
losses that businesses incur because 
there isn’t enough income to cover 
payroll, rent, utilities, and other fixed 
expenses. 
The whole goal of the CARES Act is 
to help businesses tap cash paid as 
taxes in prior years when times were 
very good, so that they can survive 
through this current crisis. When we 
drafted the CARES Act, we didn’t pick 
winners and losers, and government 
shouldn’t pick winners and losers. The 
tools generally apply to all types and 
sizes of businesses, from farmers and 
sole proprietorships to partnerships, to 
LLCs and S corporations, to the large 
corporations. They apply across all in-
dustries, since nearly every sector is 
bearing the burden of stay-at-home and 
shutdown orders across our entire Na-
tion. 
Most importantly, we didn’t try to 
decide which jobs were more worthy of 
saving than other types of jobs. Our 
goal was to help preserve as many jobs 
as possible, regardless of whatever 
business they were in. Those objectives 
were the right ones. 
This partisan tax increase also flies 
in the face of anti-recessionary fiscal 
policy 101. Find me a credible econo-
mist who says that we should raise 
taxes in a normal recession. It is just 
common sense not to. In a normal busi-
ness cycle downturn, tax increases 
hurt, rather than help, the recovery. 
Why double down now, as the House is 
doing, in the greatest and sharpest eco-
nomic contraction in modern history? 
The House Democrats have reverted 
to partisan politics, as usual, in the 
middle of the worst pandemic in more 
than 100 years and the worst economic 
crisis in nearly that long. Maybe, they 
should think about former President 
Obama’s support for this kind of anti- 
recessionary fiscal policy back in 2009. 
What former President Obama said 
then should apply now: Don’t raise 
taxes in a recession. 
Nevertheless, I am hopeful that we 
can maintain the bipartisan spirit of 
the CARES Act in the Senate as we 
chart the next steps to reopen the 
economy and get Americans back to 
work. 
While some businesses will feel the 
impact of this pandemic more than 
others, none of these businesses are

doing well. They all deserve as many 
tools as we can provide to weather this 
storm. What is more, employers across 
the country who have been relying on 
the CARES Act shouldn’t be deterred 
by the misguided tax hike proposed by 
the House Democrats. The messaging 
bill that the House just passed can’t be 
allowed to undermine access to capital 
needed to reopen their businesses, 
bring back employees, and win back 
the customers that made them success-
ful before the pandemic attack. 
And to the Democratic critics, I say 
this: Let’s put away the partisan at-
tacks. Let’s put away the political pan-
dering. Let’s keep working for the good 
of the country, so our families, busi-
nesses, and economy really can come 
out of these tough times on a strong 
footing and with the best shot at a 
rapid recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
PERDUE). The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to use my military 
rucksack in my speech. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. President, on Mon-
day we honor the fallen on Memorial 
Day. While we traditionally spend this 
day of remembrance with our family 
and friends, things will look a little bit 
different this year. Even though we 
will not have the same services and 
ceremonies that we typically take part 
in, it does not make this day any less 
important. Just like every year, on 
this Memorial Day, let’s commemorate 
the servicemembers and families who 
have sacrificed in defense of our free-
dom. 
The freedoms we cherish, which are 
so often taken for granted, did not 
come without a price. For generations, 
American patriots have secured our 
blessings of liberty by willingly laying 
down their lives in defense of our great 
Nation. 
Every fallen soldier leaves behind a 
grieving parent, child, sibling, spouse, 
or friend. These family members and 
friends never forget that knock at the 
door, the sound of Taps, the loud thun-
der of the 21-gun salute, or the touch of 
a folded flag once laid on a casket. 
As a combat veteran who served in 
Operation Iraqi Freedom, I know that 
the men and women in uniform who 
served bravely alongside the fallen 
never forget either. I think of Iowans, 
like Iraq War veteran Richard Miles, 
whose picture I proudly display on my 
desk; Iowa Army National Guardsman 
Brent Maher. 
Iowa 
National 
Guardsman 
James 
Carney, whose family are dear friends, 
just 22 years old, was killed in Afghani-
stan. 
Army 
SGT 
James 
‘‘Jamie’’ 
Skalberg, Jr, died in combat in Afghan-
istan at just 25 years old, leaving be-
hind his beautiful son, who was not 
even a year old when he lost his father. 
SGT Joseph Milledge was killed when 
a roadside bomb exploded near his unit, 
as it searched for weapons in Baghdad, 
and he was just 23. It was the knock 
that I gave on his mother’s door to tell 
her that her son would never be coming 
back home. 
Command SMA Marilyn Gabbard, the 
first woman in the Iowa Army National 
Guard to be promoted to the rank of 
Command Sergeant Major, was killed 
in Iraq in a Blackhawk helicopter 
crash. 
These stories and many, many more 
of these men and women of Iowa are 
heartbreaking and heroic and the very 
reason for Memorial Day. 
For 23 years, I served alongside the 
best of our Nation, women and men 
who risked absolutely everything to 
preserve our great freedoms. One of the 
many ways I pay tribute is through a 
ruck march. Every couple of months— 
that is, until COVID–19—I would gather 
a group of people to go on a ruck 
march. I grab my rucksack, filled with 
nearly 35 pounds of weight, and march 
down around the Washington Monu-
ment and back. These marches offer 
time for us to remember and reflect on 
the service and sacrifice of those in our 
armed services. 
A couple of years ago, I went on the 
Bataan Memorial Death March in 
White Sands, NM. This is 26 miles. It is 
a marathon in the desert, with a 46- 
pound rucksack—not my typical 35 
pounds. Folks, let me tell you, it was 
exhausting. My feet were blistered. My 
legs were swollen and sore, and my 
back ached for days after. There were 
times 
during 
that 
march 
when 
I 
thought I couldn’t keep walking and I 
was probably dehydrated, and I just 
simply wanted to quit. But every 
minute and every mile was worth it be-
cause we were honoring the lives of the 
fallen, those who were on that Bataan 
death march and others who had sac-
rificed family, comfort, health, and, in 
so many cases, their lives. The Bataan 
march really put the meaning behind 
Memorial Day into focus. 
While this weekend is a time to re-
flect on the sacrifice and lives lost, this 
entire month is Military Appreciation 
Month. So I want to take just a minute 
to commend our servicemembers. Dur-
ing this pandemic, our men and women 
in 
uniform 
have 
fought 
tirelessly 
against this invisible enemy, and they 
have been doing an outstanding job. 
For instance, our troops have stepped 
up to care for patients in hospitals and 
created deployable medical units, such 
as the Air Force expeditionary medical 
system, Army combat support hos-
pitals and field hospitals, and Navy ex-
peditionary medical facilities. Mem-
bers of our U.S. Air Force have trans-
ported critical supplies around our Na-
tion. 
And the heroes who are near and dear 
to my heart, our National Guardsmen, 
have been working around the clock to 
disinfect public spaces, to hand out 
food, and to provide transportation and 
logistic support. 
To all of our servicemembers at home 
and abroad, thank you. And to their 
families and loved ones who also make 
tremendous sacrifices, we appreciate 
you and we support you. Because of the 
ongoing service of our military men 
and women, we will defeat this virus. 
Folks, on this Memorial Day and dur-
ing Military Appreciation Month, I 
pray we take time out of our lives, we 
pause, and we remember all of those 
who have made the ultimate sacrifice, 
and the families and the friends and 
loved ones whom they left behind. 
To all of our soldiers, airmen, ma-
rines, and sailors who never returned 
home, today we honor you. 
May God bless our troops and their 
families. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, let me 
join my other colleagues in apprecia-
tion for Senator ERNST and her service 
in Iraqi Freedom, her two decades of 
service, being ready and able to go 
whenever she was called to go, and her 
continued service here, and her appre-
ciation for those who serve, which she 
feels in such a unique way. 
She pointed out that this is a dif-
ferent Memorial Day. Communities 
across Missouri and across the country 
have traditional events that were long 
planned on Memorial Day. Every year, 
Memorial Day looks the same. It will 
not look the same in very many places 
this year. If you did have a parade or 
an event planned, it was probably can-
celed weeks ago. Even with the best of 
efforts, it was probably not put to-
gether for Monday. 
But it doesn’t mean that we still 
don’t have an opportunity and an obli-
gation, in fact, to remember those who 
served. Also, Memorial Day has long 
become a time, at least where I live, in 
the middle of the country—and it may 
be more southern and in southern Mis-
souri than in other places. Memorial 
Day really became a day to remember 
all of those who have gone before us, 
those who passed along values to us, 
those who have done things that made 
life possible today. 
When I was growing up, sometimes 
we called Memorial Day ‘‘Decoration 
Day,’’ because it was the beginning of 
the tradition of Memorial Day, and 
people would go and decorate the 
graves of soldiers after the Civil War. 
That has continued. Memorial Day be-
came a time when families would go to 
cemeteries, and you sort of had the 
genealogical lesson right there, as you 
walked from gravestone to gravestone, 
and it was explained to you how those 
people were related to you. 
Many family members who were here 
last year aren’t here today and will not 
be 
here 
on 
Monday. 
Clearly, 
the 
coronavirus pandemic has had a dev-
astating impact on families. It has had 
a devastating impact on communities. 
It has had a devastating impact on 
lives. 
As we support this Memorial Day, as 
we think about this Memorial Day, we 
will be remembering a unique Memo-
rial Day, where so many have given

their lives in a war that was different 
than other wars, to an enemy that was 
not easily seen, to an enemy that 
turned out to be deadlier around the 
world than any would have predicted. 
And that is part of Memorial Day this 
year. 
Part of Memorial Day is remem-
bering the sacrifices that people have 
made, and we also on this day want to 
remember the sacrifices that people 
made to try to keep people alive with 
this virus—the sacrifices people have 
made to try to give care, to bring peo-
ple out of the emergency room, to 
bring people off the ventilators, and to 
do those things. 
It is, in fact, a unique Memorial Day. 
It is a Memorial Day where, 75 years 
ago, we were just finishing the incred-
ibly devastating war of World War II. 
V-E Day ended the war in Europe on 
May 8. Seventy-five years ago right 
now, American soldiers were fighting 
the Battle of Okinawa. Just 2 weeks be-
fore that, our country and our allies 
fought the fierce Battle of Iwo Jima. 
These were really the two last major 
battles. 
One of the people who died on Iwo 
Jima was an 18-year-old marine from 
Bates County, MO, named George Phil-
lips. On the night of March 14, an 
enemy hand grenade was tossed into 
the area where his squad had sought 
shelter. Private Phillips shouted a 
warning and threw his body on top of 
the grenade, saving the lives of every 
other person there, but gave his life to 
save theirs. 
For his actions that day, he was 
awarded the Medal of Honor. The cita-
tion was signed by another former sol-
dier from Missouri—President Tru-
man—honoring that bravery. 
That kind of unhesitating bravery is 
a characteristic of American soldiers 
over centuries of understanding what it 
meant to defend your family, to defend 
your friends, to defend those serving 
with you, and, in the case of our coun-
try, to be willing to defend freedom, to 
be willing to jump on the grenade, to 
be willing to do what is necessary to 
protect others. 
We have seen many examples of that 
in the last year. Some of those exam-
ples were in the military. Others were 
in those who protect us and in first re-
sponders and police and fire, and then 
many examples of people who risked 
their lives to save others with the virus 
that has attacked our country. 
We have a lot to think about this Me-
morial Day, a lot to dedicate ourselves 
toward as we look to a future where 
people continue to help others, where 
people continue to give selflessly, and 
for those who have served in the mili-
tary, to be willing to pay whatever 
price, and we stand in appreciation of 
that on this Memorial Day, as we ap-
proach this weekend. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, it is an 
honor for me to be here with my fellow 
Senators. I was very moved by Senator 
ERNST’s recounting not only of her 
service but of the service of so many 
Iowans, and Senator BLUNT, as well, 
from Missouri, reminding me of what 
Memorial Day is for and how it is com-
memorated around the country for 
those brave soldiers from Missouri. 
So we are getting ready to com-
memorate Memorial Day, and we will 
be doing it differently than we have in 
the past years. But it is still just as 
important for us to honor the brave 
men and women of the U.S. armed serv-
ices. They have selflessly served our 
country by standing up to protect the 
freedoms that we hold so dear and 
going into the line of fire in many 
ways. 
This Memorial Day is particularly 
momentous because 2020 marks the 
75th anniversary of the conclusion of 
World War II. Earlier this month, on 
May 8, as Senator BLUNT mentioned, 
we recognized V-E Day, or Victory in 
Europe Day, marking the anniversary 
of the Nazi surrender and the end of 
the Allies’ European campaign. 
In a few months, on September 2, we 
will recognize the 75th anniversary of 
Japan’s signing its surrender, subse-
quently ending the Pacific campaign 
and the war. 
During World War II, the United 
States lost over 400,000 soldiers, who 
were fighting to uphold our values and 
defend the liberties of those abroad as 
well. 
As the daughter of a proud World 
War II veteran myself, I had the chance 
to hear firsthand the acts of valor that 
my father, SGT Arch Moore, witnessed 
on the battlefield. 
I also had the honor this past Decem-
ber to travel with several of my col-
leagues to Luxembourg and Belgium to 
commemorate the 75th anniversary of 
the Battle of the Bulge. My dad was 
wounded just weeks before the battle, 
where he was, but his company went on 
to fight in Belgium, and only 3 of the 36 
men made it out alive. I think about 
those 33 men and their families on this 
Memorial Day. 
Being able to attend those cere-
monies and to honor all of the soldiers 
who fought during the Battle of the 
Bulge was a humbling experience that I 
will never forget, and those who re-
turned to commemorate that occasion, 
most of them were in their nineties— 
mid to late nineties. 
The efforts of our servicemembers in 
both the European and Pacific theaters 
were great. 
A couple of months ago we marked 
the 75th anniversary of the Battle of 
Iwo Jima. I was hoping to go to com-
memorate 
that, 
as 
well, 
but 
the 
coronavirus got in the way. The U.S. 
Marine Corps and Navy were able to 
seize the island and to give America 
the stronghold needed to win the war 
months later. 
While this year marks the 75th anni-
versary of the conclusion of World War 
II, we must also never forget all of the 
Americans who have lost their lives in 
battle, whether it be the Korean war, 
the Vietnam war, the first Gulf war, or 
the ongoing fight against terrorism in 
the Middle East and in all of the con-
flicts that America has fought. 
Many of our country’s servicemem-
bers have made the ultimate sacrifice 
to keep our liberties intact. 
I recently read a book called ‘‘No 
Surrender,’’ by Christopher Edmonds. 
You may have heard of it. It is the true 
story of his father, Roddie Edmonds, 
who risked his life during the final 
days of World War II to save others 
from the Nazis. His heroic duty saved, 
I think, thousands of lives. He was cap-
tured and sent to a POW camp in Ger-
many. He risked his life to prevent 
hundreds of others from Nazi persecu-
tion and possible death, but at the 
same time he witnessed horrific acts 
and he also witnessed many, many of 
his fellow soldiers losing their lives in 
the name of freedom. 
The members of the U.S. military 
have always put our country first and 
will continue to do so to keep our flag 
flying high, and Roddie Edmonds was a 
perfect example of this. West Vir-
ginians have always believed in putting 
our country and State first, and I am 
proud of all of the men and women in 
my State, of which we have a very high 
percentage—past 
and 
present—who 
have answered the call of duty. 
It saddens me that we will not be 
able to come together in person, as we 
normally do as a nation, to honor the 
heroic efforts of the brave men and 
women in our country who have given 
the ultimate sacrifice in service, but I 
know we will come together in spirit. 
While we might not have the usual pa-
rade and barbecues that we have be-
come accustomed to on Memorial Day, 
we can use this time to reflect upon 
the sacrifices made by our Armed 
Forces and their families. 
Whether you are at home or with a 
small group of friends and family, I en-
courage everyone to take the time to 
remember those who lost their lives 
serving our country. Memorial Day is 
often considered the first unofficial 
day of the summer, but really it is a 
time to pay tribute to those who made 
America the great country that it is 
today. On Monday, take a moment to 
pray for those servicemembers who 
have lost their lives fighting for this 
country and for their families as well. 
For the children who are out of school, 
take time to learn more about the men 
and women who came before you and 
defended this country and its values. 
I want to say thank you to all of 
those who have served and to all of 
those families who have lost loved 
ones. Your sacrifice has not gone unno-
ticed, and we are forever grateful. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from North Dakota.

with my esteemed colleague from West 
Virginia and my colleague from Mis-
souri and others to remember, to com-
memorate, and to honor those who 
have given their lives in service to our

country. Those who fought and died for 
our Nation have secured our freedoms, 
and we are forever indebted to them. 
That includes many North Dakotans 
who gave their lives serving in our Na-
tion’s Armed Forces. These fallen he-
roes served in World War I, World War 
II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghani-
stan. 
While we set aside a day each year, 
Memorial Day, to honor those who 
have given their lives on behalf of our 
Nation, every day we are reminded of 
the dedication and sacrifice of those 
who serve to protect our freedoms and 
liberty. 
We must never forget those who have 
made the ultimate sacrifice, as well as 
those who are missing in action. That 
is why in 2014 I supported legislation to 
create the Defense POW/MIA Account-
ing Agency. This DOD Agency seeks to 
locate the nearly 82,000 missing service 
personnel, so we can bring them home 
and provide answers to their families. 
We also recognize that those who 
serve do not serve alone. The friends 
and family of those in the service of 
our country also serve, and those who 
have lost loved ones know well the cost 
of freedom. As fellow Americans, it is 
our duty to ensure that their survivors 
are taken care of and that these heroes 
are never forgotten. 
We can better uphold our promise 
and honor those who made the ulti-
mate sacrifice by providing their fellow 
servicemembers, veterans, and their 
survivors with the healthcare benefits 
and recognition that they have earned. 
That is why we continue to work with 
the Department of Veteran Affairs as 
they implement the VA MISSION Act, 
which gives our veterans more options 
to seek care in their home commu-
nities, and veterans are provided access 
to long-term and nursing home care 
closer to home. 
Last fall, I also helped to dedicate 
the Fargo National Cemetery, the first 
VA national cemetery in North Da-
kota. We worked to secure the ceme-
tery because its presence allows North 
Dakotans who have served to be laid to 
rest with honor, while being close 
enough to their homes for family and 
loved ones to visit and pay their re-
spects to our heroes. 
The new cemetery complements the 
North Dakota Veterans Cemetery in 
Mandan, which is operated by the 
State. To help support maintenance 
and operations of our State’s veterans 
cemeteries, I am helping to introduce a 
bipartisan bill—the Veterans Cemetery 
Grants Improvement Act—with Sen-
ators TESTER, ROUNDS, and REED, so 
that State-operated veterans ceme-
teries receive the funding they need to 
ensure that all of our veterans can be 
laid to rest closer to their loved ones. 
Our servicemembers and their fami-
lies have given much in defense of our 
Nation and our way of life. The State 
of North Dakota especially has a rich 
tradition of military service. 
With deepest appreciation and admi-
ration, we look to the meaning of their 
service, never forgetting to honor those 
who have passed, and we extend our 
gratitude to the families and loved 
ones left behind. 
May God bless those who have gone 
before, those who continue to serve, 
and may He continue to bless this 
great country that they have served so 
very well. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Ms. 
COLLINS. 
Mr. 
President, 
throughout America, we set aside Me-
morial Day to honor those who gave 
their all for all of us, but this Memo-
rial Day will be very different from 
those we have celebrated in the past, as 
we honor our veterans. This Memorial 
Day, there will be no big parades and 
no formal ceremonies at State veterans 
cemeteries. 
In Bangor, ME, where I live, each 
year there is a fabulous Memorial Day 
parade in which veterans from all con-
flicts and all eras march down Main 
Street, often with walking sticks that 
were provided by one of Maine’s great-
est veterans, Galen Cole, who passed 
away recently, a World War II veteran 
who made a pledge that he would al-
ways honor our veterans. 
But despite the absence of big pa-
rades and big celebrations of fireworks 
this year, we should still take the time 
to honor those who have worn the uni-
form of our country. 
From America’s founding to our 
time, the men and women of our Armed 
Forces have written the history of our 
freedom. From generation to genera-
tion, they add new and inspiring chap-
ters of valor, devotion to duty, and sac-
rifice. As we honor the fallen, we also 
honor those who served and returned 
home and those who serve today, 
joined together, as we grieve for their 
fallen comrades. 
We also thank the families—the hus-
bands, 
wives, 
sons 
and 
daughters, 
brothers and sisters, mothers and fa-
thers—who endure the grief that is 
part of freedom’s price. 
It is significant that a day dedicated 
to the deepest of human emotions— 
grief, remembrance, and gratitude— 
began not by decree from any high au-
thority but in the hearts of everyday 
people. As the Civil War ravaged the 
countryside and took on an ever great-
er and more ghastly toll, widows and 
grieving mothers on both sides of the 
conflict began placing wild flowers on 
the graves of the soldiers, regardless of 
uniform, who fell in their fields and 
forests. 
From those humble beginnings, we 
have remained true to Memorial Day’s 
original spirit. Memorial Day is a na-
tional observance. Yet it remains deep-
ly personal for each of us. 
For me, it brings back a cherished 
memory from my early childhood. My 
father was a World War II veteran who 
was wounded twice in the Battle of the 
Bulge. He taught me to honor our vet-
erans and our flag, and each year, as I 
was growing up, he would take me to 
the Memorial Day parade in our home-
town of Caribou, ME. He would perch 
me high on his shoulders and there, 
from the best vantage point, I could see 
our veterans march by and our flag go 
by. 
Memorial Day is all about remem-
brance. It is also about our resolve to 
uphold the values that inspire the sac-
rifice we honor today. This was best ar-
ticulated in what many regard as the 
first and finest Memorial Day speech. 
It was not given on a warm May morn-
ing but on a chilly November after-
noon, in a place called Gettysburg. 
These are the words of President 
Abraham Lincoln: ‘‘That from these 
honored dead, we take increased devo-
tion to that cause for which they gave 
the last full measure of devotion.’’ 
May those who have fallen rest in 
peace. May we always remember them 
this Memorial Day and forever, and 
may God bless the United States of 
America. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. YOUNG. Memorial Day. If you 
travel door to door in neighborhoods 
across this country, all Americans will 
agree that this day is special. It is a 
day to honor the men and women who 
made the ultimate sacrifice on behalf 
of our country. Thanks to their her-
oism, we have our freedom, our strong 
democracy, and our country’s great-
ness. For their contributions, we owe 
them a debt we can never repay. 
It was 152 years ago that our 16th 
President, Abraham Lincoln, enacted 
the first national Memorial Day. It was 
a day meant to honor the valiant sol-
diers who fought in the Civil War, and 
today we still heed Abraham Lincoln’s 
timeless words: 
Bind up the nation’s wounds to care for 
him who shall have borne the battle, and for 
his widow, and his orphan. 
To me, Memorial Day is a day to re-
flect—reflect on the Hoosiers and other 
great Americans we have lost to causes 
greater than their own. 
This day honors Alec, LCpl Alec 
Terwiske of Dubois, IN, a fellow U.S. 
marine. Alec lost his life in the line of 
service in Afghanistan in 2012, and I 
proudly wear his memorial bracelet 
around my wrist as a reminder of that 
sacrifice. 
This day honors James, CPL James 
Bethel Gresham from Evansville, IN. 
He is in the history books for being 
among the first American soldiers to 
give their lives in the line of duty dur-
ing World War I. 
This 
day 
honors 
Charles, 
SGT 
Charles G. Ruble of Parker City, IN, 
who was killed in Europe during World 
War II in 1944. His remains were re-
cently identified and returned to the 
United States, and in March, he was 
buried with full military honors at Ar-
lington National Cemetery. 
This day honors Christopher. Just 2 
weeks ago, we lost SGT Christopher 
Wesley Curry. Only 23 years old, this 
Hoosier soldier from Terre Haute, IN, 
was stationed in Iraq. Those who knew 
Christopher said:

Sgt. Curry’s incessant optimism was the 
hallmark of his personality and often pro-
vided respite for others during times of 
stress. His honesty, lightheartedness, and 
wit will always be remembered by his broth-
ers in arms. 
To those who are not here today be-
cause they made the ultimate sacrifice 
for our Nation, we humbly say thank 
you. Their legacy lives on in the hearts 
of every American. 
God bless America. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. 
ROBERTS. 
Mr. 
President, 
I 
thank Senator YOUNG and Senator COL-
LINS, who have just preceded me and 
set the tone, as only they can do, with 
regard to honoring Memorial Day. 
It is truly an honor to stand on the 
floor of the Senate and speak about so 
many who have served and defended 
our Nation. As the son of a World War 
II veteran—a marine veteran, I might 
add—and a veteran myself, also a ma-
rine, it is a privilege to represent our 
men and women in uniform in the U.S. 
Senate and to be able to ensure they 
have all the tools they need to fulfill 
their missions, to ensure their families 
are supported here at home, and to en-
sure our veterans receive the care and 
services they deserve. 
Just a word about my dad. He was 41 
when the war started. He joined the 
Marines—he 
was 
in 
a 
non-combat 
role—at a recruiting station in Kansas 
City. They looked and looked and 
looked for a combat billet and finally 
found one that said that the top age 
was 39. They really needed people. He 
was 41. He lied about his age, and then 
went into that billet to see action in 
Guam, Okinawa, and, yes, Iwo Jima. 
I went to Iwo Jima on the 15th anni-
versary—that was about 60 years ago. 
We now have the 75th. When standing 
on top of Mount Suribachi, you really 
stop and realize exactly the sacrifice 
my dad and others made. He survived 
those attacks, and thank you to Presi-
dent Truman for allowing my dad to 
get back. 
Throughout our Nation’s history, our 
service men and women have repeat-
edly answered the call of duty and 
stepped forward to defend the freedoms 
we hold dear. From the earliest days of 
struggle for our Republic to the cur-
rent unprecedented threats from ter-
rorism, to cyber attacks, to unpredict-
able regimes with missile capability to 
attack our shores, and, yes, to global 
pandemics, the principles set forth by 
our Founding Fathers have been de-
fended by our brave men and women in 
uniform. 
I stand here once again to commemo-
rate those who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our freedoms. Hopefully 
they will continue to be remembered 
by those of us who enjoy the freedoms 
for which they fought and died. 
Memorial Day is the day when a 
grateful nation recognizes those who 
have given so much out of love for 
their country, their family, and their 
fellow citizens. 
Remembering service and sacrifice 
does not happen just on Memorial Day. 
One of the greatest honors to me is 
meeting the veterans who visit Wash-
ington, DC, through the incredible ef-
forts of the Honor Flight Network. 
Having the opportunity to visit with 
members of the ‘‘greatest generation’’ 
who make the journey to Washington— 
often with high school students who 
are learning firsthand about their serv-
ice and that history—so they can see 
their memorial is a humbling and up-
lifting experience for me and for all of 
us. To watch these men and women 
share their stories, many for the first 
time, is incredibly moving. 
When meeting these members of the 
‘‘greatest generation,’’ you understand 
how befitting that label is for these 
humble men and women who stood in 
the face of tyranny and triumph. We 
see this same courage and resolve dem-
onstrated daily by the good men and 
women currently serving in our Armed 
Forces throughout the world. We see 
acts of uncommon valor and great sac-
rifice for a cause and a deep belief in 
something bigger that just one person. 
We honor all the American men and 
women who have given their lives for 
their country since our Nation’s found-
ing. SUSAN
COLLINS
just referred to 
that in her very fine speech. We honor 
the more than 300,000 living veterans, 
from those folks to the ‘‘greatest gen-
eration,’’ and we honor the families of 
those who are here and are serving. 
Speaking of the ‘‘greatest genera-
tion,’’ I have the honor of being the 
chairman of the Eisenhower Memorial 
Commission, the memorial which pays 
tribute to Kansas’s favorite son Ike’s 
leadership both as Supreme Allied 
Commander, where he saved Western 
democracy, and the 34th President of 
the United States, where he gave us 8 
years of peace and prosperity. This me-
morial will serve as a symbol for all 
generations of the promise of America 
and what our values make possible 
here and around the world. 
We were supposed to dedicate this 
memorial this month, but, like every-
thing else, the pandemic put those 
plans on hold. When we dedicate the 
memorial in September, we hope to 
have many World War II veterans at-
tending, including Kansas’s other fa-
vorite son, Senator Bob Dole. 
While our debt to these heroes can 
never be repaid, I know that my fellow 
Kansans agree that these liberators 
and defenders of democracy deserve our 
utmost respect and gratitude. 
I am going to quote from General Ei-
senhower when he was President and 
following 
that. 
‘‘There 
is 
nothing 
wrong with America that the faith, 
love of freedom, intelligence, and en-
ergy of her citizens cannot cure.’’ I 
hope those words by Ike at that par-
ticular time can ring true in this body 
and more especially, those of us who 
are privileged to serve in this body. 
There is another quote I will repeat 
from Winston Churchill, who said: 
‘‘Kites rise highest against the wind, 
not with it.’’ We have seen a lot of talk 
about the pandemic, and those winds 
have been a bit partisan, to say the 
least. I would hope that we would stop 
for a moment and honor Memorial Day 
in the true way we should do that. 
I would close by saying, in the words 
of Ronald Reagan: 
Freedom is never more than one genera-
tion away from extinction. It is not ours by 
inheritance. It must be fought for and de-
fended constantly by each generation, for it 
comes only once to a people. Those who have 
known freedom and then lost it have never 
known it again. 
I think President Reagan gives us a 
great deal of insight. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNITED STATES PARK POLICE 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
today concerning the tragic death of a 
young Virginian, Bijan Ghaisar, who 
was shot and killed by two U.S. Park 
Police officers over 2 years ago. 
While this tragic incident occurred, 
as I mentioned, more than 2 years ago, 
many questions remain unanswered re-
garding the circumstances of Bijan’s 
death. Unfortunately, the Department 
of the Interior has failed to answer 
many of the basic questions that I have 
asked about the night of Bijan’s death 
and subsequent actions the National 
Park Service has taken following the 
shooting. 
In November of last year, I wrote the 
Department and requested information 
about the U.S. Park Police’s use of 
force and vehicle pursuit policies, as 
well as information about the Park 
Service’s response in the aftermath of 
Bijan’s shooting. Unfortunately, there 
has been no response. 
The Department found time to do 
some PR work. They provided copies of 
the updated use of force and vehicle 
pursuit policies to the Washington 
Post earlier this year, but I still have 
not received a response to my letter 
that was sent over 6 months ago. 
To this point, the Department has 
failed to answer many basic questions 
about this incident—questions that I 
have asked, as well as my friend, the 
senior Senator from Wyoming. They 
are questions about the incident, such 
as these: Did the Department open an 
internal affairs inquiry into the inci-
dent to see if any violations of Park 
Police policy occurred? What is the 
timeline for such an investigation? Is 
the U.S. Park Police conducting a 
thorough after-action review of the in-
cident? What is the status of the Park 
Police officers involved in the inci-
dent? 
Are 
they 
on 
administrative 
leave, desk duty, or are they back on 
patrol?

May 20, 2020 
These are basic questions. If the De-
partment of the Interior had any inter-
est in transparency, they could answer 
them today. The Ghaisar family de-
serves answers about what happened to 
Bijan. The pain they have experienced 
over the last 2 years is immeasurable. 
As if the premature death of their son 
wasn’t bad enough, they have waited 2 
years for answers from a Federal Gov-
ernment that has failed completely to 
adequately respond to this tragedy. 
I am not going to rest until the 
Ghaisar family has the answers they 
deserve about what happened to Bijan 
that night. If the Department wants to 
ignore these basic questions I have 
asked and if they want to disregard le-
gitimate congressional oversight, then 
there will be consequences until their 
action changes. 
In February, I voted against Kath-
arine MacGregor’s nomination to be 
Deputy Secretary of the Interior. I said 
very clearly at that time that if the 
Department of the Interior continues 
to ignore my questions about the kill-
ing of Bijan Ghaisar, I would hold up 
future Interior nominees. For this rea-
son, I am today placing a hold on the 
nomination of Lanny Erdos to serve as 
Director of the Office of Surface Min-
ing 
Reclamation 
and 
Enforcement 
within the Department of the Interior. 
If we don’t get answers to legitimate 
questions that I and other Members of 
this body and Members of the House 
have raised about the shooting of Bijan 
Ghaisar, I am prepared to hold up even 
more nominees. This is not something 
I take lightly. Holding up nominees 
should always be a last resort. But I 
have been patient and Bijan’s family 
has been patient, and still the Depart-
ment of the Interior has been silent. 
For Bijan’s family, 2 years is too long 
to wait. They deserve answers about 
what happened the night their son was 
shot and killed. I urge the Department 
to swiftly provide substantive answers 
to my outstanding questions regarding 
the death of Bijan and the Depart-
ment’s response. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDENTIAL TRANSITION 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, the 
hallmark of American democracy, the 
single greatest feature that sets us 
apart from every other country in the 
world, is the peaceful transition of 
power that occurs every 4 or sometimes 
every 8 years on January 20. It is a leg-
acy we inherited from our forefathers 
and one that generations of Americans 
have fought hard throughout our his-
tory to protect. It is a remarkable mo-
ment. The most powerful person in the 
world bows to the will of the people 
and sits only a few yards away as the 
next President takes the oath of office. 
Think about the wars that have been 
fought throughout history over who 
the next leader of a country would be. 
Yet, in America, dating back to 1797, 
when Washington willingly passed the 
torch to Adams, the peaceful transition 
of power has defined the American 
Presidency. But a growing body of evi-
dence suggests that the January 20, 
2017, inauguration of President Donald 
Trump was an exception to that hal-
lowed tradition. 
Since the FBI launched its Russia 
probe in July 2016, there has been no 
shortage of stories about what did or 
did not happen in the months leading 
up to that election. For the better part 
of 3 years, the speculation dominated 
headlines and news feeds, with even the 
smallest details consuming hours of 
airtime. 
Beyond the Russian active measures 
campaign, which we know did happen, 
there was a lot of attention focused on 
the Trump campaign itself. Now, al-
most 4 years later, we know a lot about 
what happened and what didn’t happen. 
For 
example, 
we 
know 
from 
the 
Mueller report that there was no crime 
of collusion or obstruction committed 
by the President or his campaign. But 
since the special counsel’s report was 
completed more than a year ago, we 
have learned a lot more about the out-
sized role played by some very senior 
Obama administration officials in what 
can only be described as an insurgency 
campaign against the Trump Presi-
dency. 
To be blunt, these revelations have 
given the American people good reason 
to be concerned about the outgoing ad-
ministration, which took aggressive, 
possibly unlawful steps to interfere 
with initially the Trump campaign and 
then 
to 
undermine 
the 
incoming 
Trump administration. 
For starters, there was the Depart-
ment of Justice inspector general re-
port on the Crossfire Hurricane inves-
tigation, which was released in Decem-
ber of last year. The inspector gen-
eral’s findings provided evidence that 
the concerns were more than war-
ranted. 
Inspector General Horowitz detailed 
a series of errors and missteps made by 
the FBI throughout the investigation, 
including alarming abuse of the powers 
of the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act. This act confers extraor-
dinary power on the FBI and the intel-
ligence community. 
In the FISA application for Carter 
Page, Inspector General Horowitz iden-
tified 7 errors in the initial application 
and 10 additional errors in 3 renewals. 
We are not talking about innocent 
typos or misspelled words. This was 
not just sloppiness. There were signifi-
cant and material errors, plus the de-
liberate falsification of material infor-
mation about Carter Page’s past serv-
ice to the U.S. Government, as well as 
the omission of important exculpatory 
information, which deceived and mis-
led the FISA Court. 
I would hope we could all agree that 
lying to a court is serious and com-
pletely unacceptable.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2533 
May 20, 2020 
The meticulous requirements Con-
gress mandated in the Foreign Intel-
ligence Surveillance Act and the pains-
taking procedures of the FISA Court 
were created to help instill trust and 
confidence and accountability in the 
institutions charged with protecting 
our national security, while at the 
same time protecting our privacy and 
civil liberties. Sadly, much of that 
trust has been destroyed by these rev-
elations uncovered by the inspector 
general of the Department of Justice, 
and sadly, another recent development 
has sown even more distrust and sus-
picion of the FBI and the Department 
of Justice during the previous adminis-
tration, their motives, and the legality 
of their actions. 
Last week, the Acting Director of 
National Intelligence, Richard Grenell, 
provided a declassified list of senior 
Obama administration officials who 
made requests to unmask the identity 
of Michael Flynn. Masking the name of 
a U.S. person in foreign surveillance is 
routinely done to minimize the intru-
sion into their privacy rights. 
I know trying to keep up with the 
flood of facts about these incidents can 
be a challenge, so let’s quickly recap. 
General Flynn was a member of the 
Trump campaign, and at the beginning 
of the administration, he was named as 
the National Security Advisor. We 
know his tenure was short-lived. Only 
a few weeks after assuming the post, 
General Flynn resigned after a storm 
erupted when leaks were published 
about his conversations with Russian 
Ambassador Kislyak. 
I am not here primarily to talk about 
General Flynn’s case. That is in the 
hands of the courts. But the list of 
Obama-era officials provided by Acting 
Director Grenell gave us some unset-
tling details about the larger context 
of the whole Russia investigation. If an 
American citizen is intercepted in con-
nection with foreign intelligence, the 
name of that person is masked when 
intelligence reports are disseminated 
in order to protect their identity and 
their privacy, but it is not unusual for 
intelligence officials to request that 
somebody be unmasked. It could be 
critical to a counterintelligence inves-
tigation or to understanding the na-
ture or context of the intelligence. 
Here, over the course of about 6 
weeks between late November 2016 and 
January 2017, 39 separate Obama-era of-
ficials made unmasking requests—39. 
This list is very odd. It included a 
range of high-ranking officials at the 
Departments of Treasury and Energy 
and a number of Ambassadors and even 
NATO officials. It extended to the 
highest levels of the Obama adminis-
tration—U.N. Ambassador Samantha 
Power, CIA Director John Brennan, 
FBI Director James Comey, the Presi-
dent’s Chief of Staff Denis McDonough, 
and even Vice President Biden himself. 
It reads like a guest list for an Obama 
administration state dinner. It is not 
what you would expect to see for legiti-
mate unmasking requests. 
You have to wonder, why are these 
high-ranking officials, including the 
Vice President of the United States, 
unmasking the name of an American 
citizen in foreign intelligence on an eve 
of the inauguration of their successor? 
Then-U.N. 
Ambassador 
Power 
sub-
mitted seven separate requests. Direc-
tor Clapper, then-Director of National 
Intelligence, submitted three. Director 
Brennan and Secretary Lew each sub-
mitted two. 
Somehow—I 
know 
this 
sounds 
strange, working in Washington, DC— 
somehow, once General Flynn’s name 
was unmasked in response to 39 sepa-
rate requests from Obama-era officials, 
that information was leaked to the 
press. In the intelligence community, 
intelligence is shared based on the need 
to know. What I want to know is, what 
need did these 39 Obama-era officials 
have for this surveillance, which in-
cluded the name of a U.S. citizen? I 
suspect it was done because—what nat-
urally happens next? The more people 
who know, the more likely the infor-
mation is to leak to the press in serv-
ice of a narrative. 
While unmasking can be legal if done 
by the rules, leaking that information 
is not. It is a crime. It is a felony pun-
ishable by up to 10 years in prison. 
As I mentioned, when it comes to un-
derstanding this investigation, there is 
a lot of information to sort through. 
That is why I am glad that Chairman 
LINDSEY GRAHAM, chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee, plans to hold ex-
tensive 
hearings 
into 
this 
whole 
mater—something that the Presiding 
Officer and I will participate in as 
members of that committee. But I 
worry that in the process of leaning in, 
trying to connect the dots in a very 
complex situation, we could lose sight 
of the big picture. 
It appears that high-ranking officials 
from a political party used their posi-
tions to gain and leak information on a 
political rival. We are not just talking 
about one or two rogue operators here; 
more than three-dozen senior officials 
released that information to the media 
only 8 days before the end of the 
Obama administration. 
Add to this the rapidly growing list 
of wrongs we have learned about so far: 
the inspector general report on the for-
eign intelligence surveillance abuse, 
the infamous texts between Lisa Page 
and Peter Strzok, the first altered and 
now missing 302 for Michael Flynn, 
Susan Rice’s inauguration day email to 
herself. Well, there is political intrigue 
and manipulation written all over this. 
Here is the point. Our intelligence 
community and system of justice must 
not be manipulated for political pur-
poses, and they certainly must not be 
used as a tool to disrupt the peaceful 
transition of power that is the very 
foundation of our democracy. 
On Monday evening, Attorney Gen-
eral Barr was asked about the inves-
tigation, and he made a comment that 
I think appropriately sums up the en-
tire issue. He said: 
The proper investigative and prosecutorial 
standards of the Department of Justice were 
abused, in my view, in order to reach a par-
ticular result. We saw two different stand-
ards of justice emerge, one that applied to 
President Trump and his associates, and the 
other that applied to everyone else. We can’t 
allow this ever to happen again. 
I agree with the Attorney General. 
This entire matter has been riddled 
with a combination of exploitation, 
abuse of power, and possible crimi-
nality. At the very best, it highlights 
dysfunction, but at worst, it looks like 
a coordinated effort by one administra-
tion to abuse its power, to sandbag and 
undermine its successor. 
Despite the time and taxpayer dol-
lars that have been funneled into the 
Russia-related probe, it has provided 
no 
evidence 
of 
collusion 
that 
we 
thought and were told was its object. 
Instead, it has highlighted men and 
women at the highest levels of govern-
ment using their positions for political 
purposes. This is a far cry from the 
peaceful transition of power our fore-
fathers wanted and provided for. 
When exiting the Constitutional Con-
vention in 1787, Benjamin Franklin was 
approached by a group of citizens who 
asked what type of government the del-
egates had created. He famously an-
swered ‘‘a republic, if you can keep it.’’ 
In order to maintain this grand Re-
public, we must be able to trust our in-
stitutions, especially law enforcement 
and the intelligence community. We 
need to respect the choices of the 
American 
people 
in 
our 
elections, 
which provides those elected with le-
gitimacy and authority. These are es-
sential to a constitutional republic 
like ours. 
These revelations about actions from 
Obama administration officials under-
mine that trust, and we must and will 
get to the bottom of it so we can en-
sure that it never ever happens again. 
I yield the floor.

SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
think each person in this body recog-
nizes the importance of small business 
to our economy and to our way of life. 
Small businesses are called the job cre-
ator in our economy. They create more 
jobs than larger companies. They pro-
vide innovative ways in order to move 
forward on our economy. They can fig-
ure out better ways to do things more 
efficiently, meeting the needs of the 
people of our community. 
They are also more vulnerable. They 
don’t have access to the type of capital 
that larger companies have. They don’t 
have the resiliency. So when COVID–19 
struck, we recognized—those of us in 
the Senate and the House recognized 
that we had to take special effort to 
protect the economic viability of the 
small businesses in our country. They 
did not have the reserve capital and 
they did not have the resiliency to deal 
with this prolonged downturn in our 
economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2534 
May 20, 2020 
Eight weeks ago, we came together, 
Democrats and Republicans, by a 96-to- 
0 vote and passed the CARES Act. I was 
proud that a significant part of the 
CARES Act responded to the needs of 
small businesses. 
We had a working group, a bipartisan 
working group. Senator RUBIO, the 
chairman of the Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Committee—I am the 
ranking Democrat—we were joined by 
Senator SHAHEEN and Senator COLLINS, 
and we worked in an expedited way in 
order to see what we could do to help 
small businesses get through COVID– 
19. 
The CARES Act provides new oppor-
tunities for us to help small businesses 
during this unprecedented disaster. We 
passed the PPP program, the Paycheck 
Protection Program, and provided $660 
billion of help for America’s small 
businesses. 
I want to compliment the men and 
women at the Small Business Adminis-
tration and at Treasury for putting 
this program together literally over-
night, and today 4.3 million loans have 
been given under this program that 
didn’t exist just 8 weeks ago. 
There are $513 billion in loans under 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program. 
That is quite an accomplishment, but 
there are challenges. There are chal-
lenges with any new program, but this 
program has major concerns. When we 
passed the program, we thought that 8 
weeks later, our economy would be per-
forming at a much higher level than it 
is today. We need to revisit that. 
A second program that we modified 
and changed was the Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan Program. We provided 
an additional $50 billion of funds for 
the EIDL loans so that the Small Busi-
ness Administration, which makes di-
rect loans, could provide $360 billion of 
additional loans to small businesses. 
The EIDL Program works with the 
PPP program. The PPP program covers 
payroll for 8 weeks, plus some addi-
tional expenses. The EIDL Program 
provides working capital so small busi-
nesses that have been impacted by 
COVID–19 can stay afloat. 
Here, the results are nowhere near as 
promising. Only 252,000 loans have been 
issued under the EIDL loan program 
for under $25 billion. As I pointed out 
earlier, they have the capacity for $360 
billion. It has been very slow at the 
SBA in issuing EIDL loans. 
Then we provided for grants under 
the EIDL Program. Initially, we pro-
vided $10 billion, and we increased that 
to $20 billion. Yet the number of loans 
that have been issues or grants that 
have been issued under EIDL—a little 
over a million—a little over $10 billion. 
But this program has not operated as 
we intended. We wanted these grants to 
be given within 3 days—we put that in 
the statute—and we certainly didn’t 
expect that the average loan would be 
between $4,000 and $5,000 when we gave 
grants up to $10,000. So challenges exist 
on both the loan and grant program 
under EIDL. 
Then we provided debt relief for 
those who have micro-loans or 7(a) 
loans or 504 loans under the SBA—6 
months of relief—and, quite frankly, 
we don’t know a lot about how that 
program has been working. We don’t 
have much information about it. 
That is what we did 8 weeks ago and 
then supplemented it with some addi-
tional funds. What should we do now? 
The Senate has not finished its work as 
it relates to helping the small busi-
nesses of America. We still have work 
we need to do. 
First and foremost, we need to have 
transparency and data related to how 
these programs are working. Expedi-
ency does not excuse transparency and 
accountability. Yes, we wanted to get 
the money out quickly, and we got the 
money out quickly under the PPP pro-
gram. That was our desire. But we need 
to have transparency, and we need to 
have accountability. 
We need to get the geographical in-
formation, including how many loans 
can be given in the traditionally under-
served 
communities—minority 
busi-
nesses, women-owned businesses, vet-
eran-owned businesses, the rural com-
munity, and the smaller of the small 
businesses. We need to get information 
by the size of the business, the number 
of employees they have, the industries, 
and the lender types. We need to get 
the numbers on how much has gone to 
the nonprofit community and to affili-
ates and those under the NIC code ex-
ception. 
All that is information we need to 
have in order to carry out our respon-
sibilities in the Senate. And, yes, we 
need to get information from the Small 
Business 
Administration 
and 
from 
Treasury so that we can properly pre-
pare for additional resources that may 
be needed in order to fund these pro-
grams. 
This is not a new request that I have 
made. On April 17, I joined with Sen-
ator SCHUMER, Senator SHAHEEN, and 
Senator WYDEN in a letter to Secretary 
Mnuchin and Administrator Carranza 
asking for this information to be made 
available on a regular basis. To date, 
we have still not gotten that detailed 
information. 
So I filed legislation in order to man-
date that that data be provided, much 
of that on a daily basis. We tried to get 
a UC on it, and we could not do that, 
but we had certain promises that infor-
mation would be made available. 
We are still not getting the granular 
information that is necessary for us to 
properly evaluate this program. We 
need to get that information. We need 
to have transparency. We have to have 
accountability. You have heard about 
the highly visible loans that were made 
that were given back by the pro-bas-
ketball team and by the larger public 
corporations. We need to see exactly 
how the money was allocated. 
Then there is a second thing we need 
to do in addition to getting the data 
and having transparency. We need to 
have a hearing in the Small Business 
and Entrepreneurship Committee with 
Administrator Carranza being there 
answering questions from the members 
of the authorizing committee as to how 
this program is working. 
We have to have that public hearing, 
and, quite frankly, Senator RUBIO, the 
chairman of the committee, has been 
trying to get that for us, and he has 
been rebuffed by the SBA. That is not 
acceptable. We need to have a public 
hearing. I support Senator RUBIO’s re-
quest that we schedule this hearing. It 
should have been scheduled by now. We 
should have already had this hearing, 
but we are scheduling it for the week 
we return, the week of June 1, and I 
hope Administrator Carranza will ad-
here to the request of both the chair-
man and ranking member to be here to 
answer questions about these pro-
grams. 
We have a responsibility. We have ap-
propriated over $700 billion. We have a 
responsibility to conduct an adequate 
oversight hearing on how those funds 
are being used. 
We need to do more than that. We 
also need to recognize what is going to 
be the next step and what is going to 
come next. I will tell you, there are 
certain things that can be done admin-
istratively. Some might require the ac-
tion of Congress, but some things can 
be done administratively, and we need 
to get that done as quickly as possible. 
One of the things we need to get done 
is to make sure that the underserved 
community gets adequate resources. 
When we reauthorized the extra $310 
billion for the PPP program, we allo-
cated $60 billion to smaller financial 
institutions, and that was a step in the 
right direction. I noticed that Sec-
retary Mnuchin mentioned in a hearing 
this week that he was amenable to al-
locating 
additional 
monies 
to 
the 
CDFIs. We need to allocate at least $10 
billion to the CDFIs and the minority 
depository institutions in order for the 
resources to be targeted to the under-
served and the underbanked commu-
nity. But, quite frankly, I think we 
need to do even more than that. 
I have introduced legislation with 
Senator BOOKER that will help to de-
velop the financial institutions in the 
underserved, 
underbanked 
commu-
nities. It will strengthen the abilities 
of those communities to have institu-
tions in place that can help deal with 
the credit gap in the underserved com-
munities. Our legislation would also 
strengthen the SBA tools that serve 
the underserved communities. We be-
lieve all of this can be done to help 
strengthen our commitment, which 
was in the CARES Act, to make sure 
that all communities are fairly treated 
with the tools that we made available. 
Another thing that we can do imme-
diately is to get the data. That infor-
mation can be made available now. I 
noticed that Secretary Mnuchin has 
tried to help us get certain data, but 
we are still not where we need to be. 
We need to get that information now.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2535 
May 20, 2020 
Another thing we can do—and, quite 
frankly, I think there is bipartisan sup-
port and a willingness on behalf of the 
administration—is to deal with return-
ing citizens who were denied any abil-
ity to participate in the PPP program. 
My goodness, for a person who has paid 
their debt to society, who has returned 
to the community, who is working a 
small business, should we say no, we 
are not going to help them survive? 
They 
have 
enough 
challenges 
out 
there. We certainly don’t want to take 
away their ability to take advantage of 
tools that are available to all Ameri-
cans in order to help their small busi-
nesses. I believe there is bipartisan 
support for this, and we hope that we 
will be able to get that done adminis-
tratively. After all, the restrictions 
were imposed administratively. They 
can be removed administratively. 
Then there is another issue that we 
need to deal with immediately, and 
that is the 8-week restriction that is in 
the PPP program. It was well intended 
when we passed it. It was based on the 
dollars that were available, and we 
thought that after 8 weeks, by June, we 
would see our economy back per-
forming at a level in which small busi-
nesses could be expected to be able to 
do well. Well, that is clearly not the 
case. We now need to provide addi-
tional help to small businesses as it re-
lates to the 8-week period. 
We can do that. We recognize that. 
The monies have already been appro-
priated. This does not really require 
any additional funding, but it will 
allow us to give small businesses the 
opportunity to spend the money over a 
longer period of time. Why? Because 
their businesses aren’t open. The 8 
weeks started the day they got the 
loan. Yet today they are still not at 
full operation, and some are not at any 
operation. 
So I was pleased to see that the 
House acted on this by extending this 
to 24 weeks. I hope that we could find 
common ground, because I think there 
is support on both sides of the aisle and 
with the administration to give greater 
discretion on that 8-week period so 
that it is a longer period of time and so 
that the small businesses have the op-
portunity to spend the funds that are 
under the loan in a way that they can 
get maximum forgiveness of that loan, 
which will also require us to extend the 
June 30 date for those businesses that 
need extra time in order to bring their 
workers back. 
I think there is general agreement on 
this. I hope that we can act this week 
on that provision, because by the time 
we come back after recess, the very 
first loans that have been issued under 
the PPP program will have reached 
their 8-week period, where loan for-
giveness applications are going to start 
to be processed. We need to act before 
that date. There is a sense of urgency. 
We need to get that done this week, if 
at all possible, and we should work to 
try to get that done. 
Let me also point out that, even 
when we fix the problems with these 
programs—and I hope that by oversight 
we can get the EIDL Program working 
properly and get those loans out 
there—we can increase the size of the 
EIDL grants, get more information 
about the loan forgiveness, and get the 
PPP program working in all commu-
nities, including the underserved com-
munities, giving more flexibility to 
businesses on the 8-week period. 
We are going to need additional help. 
Eight weeks of payroll help is not 
going to be enough for many small 
businesses. So as we start to consider 
the next round, I hope that we will 
look at a program that is targeted to 
the small businesses that need the help 
the most. 
When we passed the bill 8 weeks ago, 
our objective was to get money out 
quickly, and we succeeded in doing 
that. It was successful. Now we need to 
look at those small businesses that 
have the greatest need. We need to tar-
get it to those that have had signifi-
cant revenue losses. We need to target 
it to the underserved communities. We 
need to target it to the smaller of the 
small businesses. If we can target the 
program properly, the cost will be 
much less than the original cost, and 
we can save businesses that otherwise 
would have a hard time surviving. 
The key to what we did is that we 
worked together. It was bipartisan 
from the beginning. We need to do that 
again. Our small businesses, our work-
ers, and our economy depend upon our 
getting this right. I look forward to 
working with my colleagues in order to 
get this done. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to complete my 
remarks before the vote begins. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF JOHN F. HEIL III 
Mr. LANKFORD. Madam President, 
in a few minutes, the Senate will vote 
on the nomination of John Heil to 
serve as a district court judge for Okla-
homa. 
We have three areas in Oklahoma: 
the Northern District, Eastern district, 
and Western district. This judge posi-
tion covers all three of those, and they 
move to wherever there is the greatest 
need, and we are in great need. This is 
a position that we have needed for a 
while, and I am proud that John Heil 
has gone through this process. He was 
overwhelmingly confirmed in his nomi-
nation process through committee. I 
expect him to have wide bipartisan 
support when it passes this floor in a 
few moments and look forward to him 
transitioning from being a great attor-
ney in our State to being a great judge 
to serve the people of Oklahoma and 
the United States on the Federal 
bench. So I am looking forward to that 
vote being completed. 
MEMORIAL DAY 
Madam President, in the days ahead, 
we will celebrate Decoration Day. 
Decoration Day was first declared lo-
cally in 1866, after the Civil War. It was 
a day to remember those who gave 
their lives in battle for our country by 
decorating the graves and remembering 
their sacrifice. 
Now we call it Memorial Day. We re-
member all of those who have given 
their lives for our Nation. It is, unfor-
tunately, not those who just gave their 
lives long past. Unfortunately, it is 
still in the painful present. 
Last weekend, I sat in the agonizing 
funeral of TSgt Marshal Roberts, who 
was killed by rocket fire just 21⁄2 
months ago. He was in the process of 
getting others to safety when a rocket 
took his life. He is the first Oklahoman 
air guardsman to ever lose his life in 
battle. This Memorial Day will be very 
different for his wife, his daughter, 
their family, and the State of Okla-
homa, because it is not just a day 
about sleeping in and sales on dish-
washers and cars. It will evoke the 
memory of TSgt Marshal Roberts and 
the hundreds of thousands of others 
like him. They gave their everything 
for the sake of our liberty. Those men 
and women are not forgotten. They are 
our heroes, and this Memorial Day we 
will remember. 
AGRICULTURE 
Madam President, in this time, it is 
interesting to note that, with all that 
is going on, America is still eating, and 
America is still moving because there 
are essential workers who are still 
serving. They are healthcare workers. 
They are grocery store workers. They 
are truckers. They are folks at conven-
ience stores, gas stations, sanitation 
workers, and in power generation. 
They are farmers and ranchers. They 
are the refineries. Yes, they are even in 
government—public safety and law en-
forcement. 
While the news every day covers 
folks who are at home waiting to re-
turn to work, at times we forget the 
people who are working twice as hard 
right now to be able to make sure that 
is even possible. And we are grateful 
for what they are doing. We are grate-
ful for the sacrifices of their families 
and of the hours they are putting in. 
But I want to highlight a couple of 
different groups that are unique in this 
mix—some of the folks who are really 
and truly behind the scenes and whom 
we really don’t see a lot, but we see the 
end result of their products. 
Let me start with farmers and ranch-
ers. They are folks who are on the farm 
and the ranch, and they are taking 
care of our food because, as we know 
well, food does not grow in a grocery 
store. It actually has to happen some-
where by folks putting in the workout 
in the Sun and getting the chance to be 
able to bring that crop in. 
We are watching it happen across my 
State and across the country right 
now. In Oklahoma, wheat is coming in, 
and it looks beautiful. It is green still, 
but in the days ahead, as it comes in, it 
will be very important to us. But it 
will be interesting to see this crop, if it

is not taken out by the hail that is 
coming in this weekend. As it comes 
in, this crop will be very important to 
us. But this year the challenge will be 
that the H2A workers who typically 
come in literally from all over the 
world to do custom cutting are not 
able 
to 
come 
because 
of 
the 
coronavirus. And the challenge will be 
this: Will Americans step up when, lit-
erally, the harvest is plentiful, but the 
workers are few? Will Americans step 
up and say: I will not let that harvest 
go to waste; I will engage and bring the 
harvest in. 
Folks who are in forestry—yes, for-
estry and logging is a crop in Okla-
homa. For those of you who haven’t 
been there, it is the eastern side of our 
State. It is incredibly important to us. 
We are seeing a boom in that area, 
thanks to things like a great need for 
boxes, for everyone who is getting all 
of their materials shipped to their 
house right now and this small com-
modity we call toilet paper, for which 
there seems to be a run on going on 
right now. 
Cotton, corn, sorghum, beans—there 
are so many things that are so impor-
tant and behind the scenes. If we lose 
sight of that fact, we will just miss it. 
One of the things that has been in the 
news lately is livestock and the proc-
essing of the livestock. There has been 
news about how coronavirus has spread 
in some of those facilities. I have one 
of those facilities in my State. It is 
Seaboard. It is a tremendous operation, 
where folks have worked for decades in 
a tremendous place to be able to har-
vest those hogs and to turn them into 
fabulous things like bacon and pork 
chops. 
In this location in Texas County, in 
Guymon, we have seen an outbreak. 
The folks at Seaboard Farms have 
stepped up to it. Ninety-five percent of 
their workers have now been tested, 
and they are in the process of actually 
doing an entirely different test all over 
again just to be able to track and to be 
able to find, even for the people who 
were negative, if they will show up 
positive the next time and to make 
sure they are staying on top of it. But 
they are running at 60 percent oper-
ation right now. That may not seem 
like a big deal to you, but that is about 
7,000 hogs a day that are not being har-
vested. They are having to be—what is 
euphemistically 
called—depopulated. 
That is a tremendous loss to everybody 
in the entire country. 
We are seeing major issues that are 
also happening with our beef produc-
tion, as we have had enormous issues 
on trying to harvest those animals. 
As we go through the process and all 
the challenges, it has become ex-
tremely personal to a lot of the folks in 
my State. In my State, this is not just 
a theory. In my State, this is actually 
happening to real people. It is Jim 
Howard, a fourth-generation rancher, 
who ranches in Jefferson County. His 
whole family—his brother, his wife, his 
grandson, his sons-in-law—everyone is 
involved in the operation. They are 
ranching cows, calves, and stockers. 
They have a food lot operation. They 
have it all. But at this point, they are 
facing between 35 and 40 percent loss in 
the price of cattle. Literally, he loses 
money on every single cow. 
It is Robert Frymire, from Custer 
County. He is a third-generation wheat 
and cattle farmer. Using today’s wheat 
prices, even with the crop that is com-
ing in, he will lose $150,000 this year on 
his wheat crop, not to mention what is 
going to happen on the beef cattle. 
There is a reason we are trying to put 
solutions in the CARES Act. There is a 
reason we put $19 billion there to help 
our food supply, and $3 billion dollars 
of that has gone toward providing for 
our food pantries and nonprofits and 
places to be able to get food out to peo-
ple so that food doesn’t go to waste. 
But there is direct aid that is going to 
farmers and ranchers to make sure we 
keep those operations alive long term, 
because we need them to exist at the 
end of this. We are grateful to be able 
to come alongside of them. 
There are real challenges in the 
packing operations that are not new. 
They have been around for a while. We 
are pushing in a couple of areas to say: 
We have to solve a couple of these 
problems. Our small packing houses 
that are out there pay almost $80 an 
hour for overtime fees. That is $80 an 
hour for each inspector to do overtime. 
So if we have a location like Seaboard 
Farms that goes down, and they want 
to be able to go out to another location 
and to ramp up, they are actually fi-
nancially punished from being able to 
do that, and they can’t make the math 
work. We have to solve that so that we 
are not punishing small to medium- 
sized operations for ramping up in mo-
ments when we need them. And we 
need the small and medium-sized busi-
nesses to be able to ramp up and grow 
larger. 
And we have to solve the issue of the 
CIS Program, which is allowing folks 
to be able to sell over State lines. 
Twenty-seven States, including my 
own, have State inspection programs 
that are equal to the USDA program. 
They have to be equal to it, but they 
are still not allowed to sell over State 
lines until they get the CIS Program 
done, and only three States have been 
able to complete that. This should be 
logical. We should be able to solve this. 
Those two things would allow long- 
term fixes for the packing house oper-
ations. It is something we have com-
plained about for a long time, and we 
should have solved this at this moment 
because it has become even more obvi-
ous. 
The issues about energy continue to 
rise for us. As a nation, we are finally 
energy independent—finally. We choose 
to buy energy from places where we 
want to buy energy because we can 
produce it ourselves, but we cannot go 
backward to a time period when we 
were dependent on the Middle East 
again because of what has happened 
with COVID–19. We have to pay atten-
tion to this. There are commonsense 
solutions, and I understand full well 
that there are some folks who don’t 
like fossil fuels. I get it, but those 
same folks fly on planes and drive cars 
and trucks. And we like wearing 
clothes, and we like having paint. And 
as for all of those things that are dis-
posable now, like PPE, guess what they 
are made of. Petroleum. There is this 
whole challenge about trying to get 
away from petroleum. It has been in-
teresting to me how many people have 
suddenly gone from ‘‘let’s reuse every-
thing’’ to the last 2 months saying: No, 
actually, we want to have disposable 
everything now. Well, guess what. 
Those disposable items are made with 
petroleum products. 
We do need this balance. We can do it 
clean, but we have to be able to keep 
this part of industry open and still 
functioning. And if the whole system 
collapses, we will not be able to do 
that. 
Many of you know that my State is a 
production State. At times, we will 
have hundreds of wells for oil and gas 
running. Right now, in the entire State 
of Oklahoma, there are 12 rigs work-
ing—12. That is the collapse of thou-
sands and thousands of jobs, and if 
those jobs and those companies go 
away and do not recover, then, we are 
suddenly dependent on the Middle East 
again. We cannot go there. We have to 
resolve that. That is why the Paycheck 
Protection Program was opened up to 
small businesses—and, yes, even energy 
companies—to help sustain them for a 
couple of months to be able to get 
through this. But it is going to be a 
very big challenge for them. 
Quite frankly, there is something 
that is news to this body that I want to 
raise. In 2007, long before I was in Con-
gress, Congress passed an act dealing 
with ethanol, mandating a certain 
number of gallons of ethanol to be used 
every year. Well, guess what. America 
wasn’t driving in March and in April. 
That means we are not going to be 
close to the number of gallons of gaso-
line that we normally use, but we still 
have a requirement sitting out there 
for the number of gallons of ethanol 
that have to be used this year. We lit-
erally 
have 
an 
energy-ticking 
timebomb, based on a bad law that was 
written years ago dealing with ethanol, 
and if we are not careful, we are going 
to cause even bigger challenges in en-
ergy based on that ethanol law and the 
number of gallons that are required 
when there is literally no way, even if 
we poured it on the ground, that we 
can use the gallons required in that 
law. 
That is going to be an issue for us, 
and it is one that we need to work co-
operatively on and in a nonpartisan 
way to say: Let’s have some common 
sense in this moment to solve how we 
deal with our energy, lest the prices of 
gasoline explode at the backside of 
this, not because of undersupply but 
because of ethanol regulations. We

should not allow that to occur. We 
should be able to not only solve that 
for this year but solve it long term. 
I am grateful for the folks who are 
farmers and ranchers who are working, 
and in energy, the folks who work be-
hind the scenes, who make America 
move, because in the days ahead, we 
will start moving. 
My State has already reached phase 2 
of reopening, and we continue to see a 
decline in the number of cases, but 
those folks who were working behind 
the scenes the whole time are making 
the difference for us.

MEMORIAL DAY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
last week, I received the very sad news 
that the 5th Special Forces Group, 
which is stationed at Fort Campbell, 
which is in Tennessee, was going to 
have to forgo and cancel their annual 
Memorial Day Gold Star Ceremony. 
This is a tradition at the post. It is 
something that is so special to those 
Gold Star families, and we are dis-
appointed with that but understand. 
I have really been pleased that today 
Senator ERNST has organized a time for 
us to come to the floor to really come 
together to honor not only our fallen 
but also their loved ones, who have had 
to spend this year’s remembrance sepa-
rated from other Gold Star families, 
and we know that is a time they cher-
ish, having that togetherness. 
Although the formal ceremonies are 
canceled, please note that each of these 
families is in our prayers, they are in 
our thoughts, and that we grieve along-
side them. 
This Memorial Day, reflections are 
framed by a world that has really been 
made much smaller by our shared expe-
riences with COVID–19. Even so, the 
state of our world makes the battle-
fields we send our soldiers and sailors 
and airmen and marines to seem very 
far away because in their world, au-
thoritarian regimes rule with an iron 
fist, and they violate human rights 
with impunity. Violence often replaces 
diplomacy as the preferred method of 
dispute resolution and freedom, when 
it is discussed at all. Many times, it 
feels like an impossibility. This is what 
they deal with on a daily basis. 
The danger this creates is no secret 
to anyone. Like the rest of us, our sol-
diers read the news reports from the 
frontlines. They hear the enemy propa-
ganda. They hear those who repeat the 
enemy propaganda. Many of them have 
experienced the ferocity of the enemy 
attacks against our forces and against 
our allies. They know what they are up 
against. They see it and they live it 
each and every day. Yet, in spite of the 
danger, they answer the call because 
they have something inside them that 
says that freedom is worth fighting for. 
It is their commitment to that cause of 
liberty to allow us to live in a free and 
open society, to allow us and our chil-
dren to pursue those dreams, to dream 
those big dreams and to make them 
come true. 
Whether we lost loved ones and 
friends on the battlefield or, later, lost 
them to the trauma of combat and loss, 
this weekend, we thank them for their 
sacrifice, we honor their memory, and 
we express our gratitude to their fami-
lies, who this year will have to cele-
brate as a family and not with others. 
I yield the floor.

FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND 
UNIVERSITIES 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
week Congress submitted to the Presi-
dent the bipartisan Congressional Re-
view Act resolution that overturned 
Education Secretary DeVos’s borrower 
defense rule. 
The rule that she came up with at 
the Department of Education makes it 
almost impossible for student loan bor-
rowers, including many, many vet-
erans, who have been defrauded by 
their schools—these are usually for- 
profit schools—to have Federal student 
debt discharged because of the fraud 
under the Higher Education Act’s bor-
rower defense provisions. 
Ten Republicans joined with the 
Democrats in March to reject this rule 
in the Senate and pass this resolution. 
I thank those on the other side of the 
aisle who stood up for the veterans and 
for students who have been defrauded. 
I urge President Trump to sign this 
bill without delay. More importantly 
than my urging, 30 different veteran 
organizations urged the President to 
sign our resolution. We are going to be 
giving a lot of speeches about veterans 
on the Senate floor and back home 
over Memorial Day weekend. Here is a 
chance for the President to stand up

for the veterans on Memorial Day 
weekend. 
In a March 13 letter to President 
Trump, these veterans asked him to 
ensure ‘‘that the men and women who 
served their country honorably are not 
burdened with student loans that re-
sult from fraud.’’ 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
March 13 letter to President Trump be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
MARCH 13, 2020. 
Hon. DONALD J. TRUMP, 
The White House, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR PRESIDENT TRUMP: In August 2019, 
you stood with veterans in directing the 
Education Department to ensure that all to-
tally and permanently disabled veterans 
would have their student loans forgiven. We 
were so grateful to you then. We write now 
to 
ask 
that 
you 
please 
stand 
with 
servicemembers, veterans, their families, 
and survivors again in supporting a bipar-
tisan resolution, H.J. Res 76, which would 
help veterans and military-connected stu-
dents get relief from student loans they in-
curred as a result of fraud. 
With a bipartisan vote in both the Senate 
and the House of Representatives, it is clear 
the 
support 
of 
Congress 
for 
veterans, 
servicemembers, and their families and sur-
vivors stands above partisan politics. 
Please join us in ensuring that the men 
and women who have served their country 
honorably are not burdened with student 
loans that result from fraud. This has been 
an important priority for veterans organiza-
tions as reflected in a letter from 27 veterans 
organizations to the Education Department 
and a letter from 37 veterans organizations 
to Congress. 
We appreciate your support.

Mr. DURBIN. President Trump has 
the opportunity to be the one who res-
cues these defrauded veterans from a 
rule that the American Legion has en-
titled ‘‘fundamentally rigged against 
defrauded borrowers’’ and give these 
Americans who served our country not 
just a pat on the back but a chance to 
get back in the game in their lives. 
American voters are behind us, over-
whelmingly, from both political par-
ties. New polling by Third Way finds 
that voters in key red and swing States 
believe that the Federal Government 
should not make students who took out 
loans to attend fraudulent or mis-
leading institutions of higher edu-
cation pay back those loans. 
In Ohio, 73 percent of voters believed 
this, 68 percent in Indiana, 64 percent 
in Colorado, 63 percent Pennsylvania, 
61 percent Missouri and North Caro-
lina, and 60 percent South Carolina. 
When asked if schools that mislead stu-
dent borrowers should be held account-
able, the numbers are dramatically 
higher, and 95 percent of Republicans 
in North Carolina agree and 91 percent 
of Republicans in South Carolina. The 
list goes on. 
The DeVos borrower defense rule 
would make it impossible for defrauded 
borrowers to get the relief that the 
American people and I believe they de-
serve. It will lessen accountability for 
the schools that defrauded these bor-
rowers. They are just going to do it 
again. God forbid we loan these de-
frauding schools money in the current 
economic crisis so they can continue to 
defraud veterans and other students. 
This 
isn’t 
a 
controversial 
issue 
among 
the 
American 
people, 
just 
among politicians. By signing this res-
olution, President Trump will be sup-
porting 
America’s 
veterans, 
Demo-
cratic and Republican voters. I hope he 
listens. 
f 
IMMIGRANT HEALTHCARE HEROES 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Ameri-
cans owe a great deal of gratitude to 
healthcare workers on the frontlines of 
the fight against the COVID–19 pan-
demic. I can’t tell you how many 
heartbreaking stories I have read of 
these healthcare workers who are so 
depressed over the number of infec-
tions, the suffering that people are 
going through, and, of course, those 
whose lives have been taken by this 
coronavirus. I can’t imagine what it is 
like physically and mentally, what 
they go through. Bless them. Bless 
them for caring enough for us and for 
our families to risk their own lives and 
go to work every single day. 
I want to spend a minute talking 
about 
a 
special 
group 
of 
these 
healthcare workers—immigrants. That 
is right—immigrants. Consider this: 1 
in 6 healthcare and social service work-
ers is an immigrant; 3.1 million out of 
18.7 million. Over 3 million immi-
grants. 
These immigrants are playing a cru-
cial role in the battle against the pan-
demic. Yet, the President continues to 
disparage them falsely, claiming they 
are a drain on society. He wishes they 
would leave. I hope they never do. 
I have come to the floor to tell the 
story of one. I will continue to high-
light these stories because we need to 
put faces on this issue. You need to un-
derstand who these people are, these 
people who are immigrants to this 
country and willing to risk their lives 
to save ours. I invite my colleagues to 
do the same. Tell the stories in your 
own States. I can guarantee you, wher-
ever you are from, there are immigrant 
health heroes. 
Not to take anything away from 
those who are not new immigrants, but 
these people need special attention at a 
time when there is so much criticism 
of immigration to this country of im-
migrants. Many of these healthcare 
workers are young immigrants who 
came here as children. They are known 
as Dreamers. I know because 20 years 
ago, I introduced the DREAM Act so 
that these young people, brought to 
this country as toddlers, infants, and 
little kids, could have a chance to be 
part of a future. They are American in 
every way except their immigration 
status. 
I joined with Republican Dick Lugar 
years ago on a bipartisan basis, calling 
on the President to use his authority 
to protect these Dreamers from being 
deported. President Obama responded. 
He created the DACA Program. DACA 
provided temporary protection from 
deportation to Dreamers if they reg-
istered with the government, paid a 
$500 filing fee, went through a criminal 
background check, and had no serious 
problems. They were allowed to stay 2 
years at a time, not be deported, and 
legally work in America. 
More than 800,000 Dreamers came for-
ward and received DACA protection, 
and let me tell you what they did. 
They turned around and became teach-
ers, nurses, soldiers, small business 
owners, and 100 other things important 
to America. 
Listen to this: More than 200,000 
DACA recipients are essential critical 
infrastructure workers. I didn’t make 
that up; that number came out of 
President Trump’s own Department of 
Homeland Security. Among these es-
sential workers are 41,700 DACA recipi-
ents in the healthcare industry. These 
include doctors, intensive care nurses, 
paramedics, and respiratory therapists. 
Understand this: These are undocu-
mented people in America, brought 
here as children, grew up here, went to 
school here, got an education, devel-
oped skills and training, and now we 
need them in this pandemic—41,700 of 
them. 
On 
September 
5, 
2017, 
President 
Trump repealed DACA. Hundreds of 
thousands of Dreamers faced losing 
their work permits and being deported 
from this country to places that many 
of them barely remember. Thank good-
ness the court stepped in to stop the 
President’s action, but the President 
decided to appeal the case, and now, 
across the street in the Supreme Court, 
they are sitting on a case that will de-
cide the fate of 800,000 of these DACA

protectees, many of them—thousands 
of them healthcare workers who are 
doing essential work every day. We can 
get a decision from the Court any day. 
Will we be better off if 41,000 of these 
DACA healthcare professionals are de-
ported from this country in the midst 
of this pandemic? No sensible person 
believes we would be. If the Court rules 
in favor of President Trump, up to 
200,000 essential workers in America 
would be sidelined in the middle of this 
national emergency. Many of them 
face deportation. 
I sent a letter to the President, with 
37 of my Senate colleagues last month, 
urging him to extend the work author-
ization for DACA recipients to the end 
of the year. It is not too much to ask. 
They have lived in this country for 
years, and they passed a criminal back-
ground check. 
For goodness’ sake, Mr. President, 
don’t get tough on these people when 
we need them the most. 
But if you consider what the Presi-
dent said about immigrants over and 
over again, I know it is unlikely that 
he is going to have a moment of caring 
when it comes to their future, so Con-
gress has to step in. 
The HEROES Act, which the House of 
Representatives passed last week and 
which we did not even consider this 
week in the U.S. Senate, includes a 
provision 
to 
automatically 
extend 
work authorizations for DACA recipi-
ents. This is what they are talking 
about when critics of that House action 
come to the floor and talk about all 
the benefits for undocumented people 
living in this country—the extension of 
DACA protection for thousands of es-
sential workers in this country who are 
protected by DACA. 
They say: Oh, it sounds like they are 
opening the doors for illegal people to 
come in here and get royal treatment 
in America. 
The opposite is true. These are people 
who are risking their lives providing 
healthcare 
and 
essential 
services 
across America. The HEROES Act that 
passed in the House of Representatives 
simply said we are not going to deport 
them. What a radical suggestion, that 
we could use their help and we need 
their help through the rest of the year. 
We certainly do. Those who come and 
mock this provision by saying it is just 
a giveaway to illegal immigrants are 
really doing a disservice to these peo-
ple and the sacrifice they are making. 
Ultimately, we need to give these 
Dreamers a chance to become citizens. 
I believe it now, and I have believed it 
for 20 years. It has been that long since 
I introduced the DREAM Act, a bipar-
tisan bill, which would accomplish 
that. 
Last year, the Congress passed the 
Dream and Promise Act, which would 
have solved this problem based on the 
DREAM Act. The vote was 237 to 187 in 
the House. Leader MCCONNELL has re-
fused to even consider calling that 
measure for consideration in the Sen-
ate. And it isn’t because we are over-
worked; just take a look at this empty 
Chamber. 
Over the years, I have come to the 
floor of the Senate more than 100 times 
to tell the stories of Dreamers. I want 
you to know who they are. These sto-
ries show what is at stake when we 
consider the future of DACA. 
Today, I want to tell you about 
Javier Quiroz Castro. Here is Javier 
dressed for work. He is the 121st 
Dreamer whose story I have told on the 
Senate floor. 
Javier’s parents brought him to the 
United States when he was 3 years old. 
He grew up in Nashville, TN. His father 
worked in construction as a bricklayer. 
His mother cleaned homes and office 
buildings. As the oldest child and the 
best English speaker, Javier took care 
of his three younger siblings and 
helped his family navigate the chal-
lenges of being in America. 
Javier went to a private Christian 
college in Nashville, Lipscomb Univer-
sity. At Lipscomb, he discovered his 
love of nursing. He enrolled in the 
school of nursing and did his clinical 
training at Vanderbilt Medical Center. 
Javier graduated in May 2013 with his 
bachelor’s in science of nursing. Javier 
received the Spirit of Nursing Award, 
which each year is given to only one 
nursing student who has best delivered 
quality care. 
Because President Obama established 
DACA in 2012, Javier had a chance. Be-
fore that, he had no chance to become 
a registered nurse in this country. But 
he had a chance, and he took advan-
tage of it. 
Javier now lives in Houston, TX, and 
works at Houston Methodist Hospital. 
He is part of the team taking care of 
patients with COVID–19. This is what 
he wears to work. 
Javier wrote me a letter. Here is 
what he said: 
Thanks to DACA, I have been able to save 
a lot of lives. I have been able to be there 
with patients at their final moments of life. 
I have been able to take care of people of 
many different backgrounds, nationalities, 
races, socioeconomic levels, and cultures. 
This wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t 
introduce you to Javier’s daughter. 
Take a look at this beautiful little girl. 
This is Isabelle Quiroz. A few weeks 
ago, she took her first steps. I bet you 
she is about the same age as my grand-
daughter, whose birthday is Friday of 
this week. She is about to take her 
first steps too. This beautiful little 
girl, Javier’s little girl, her faith and 
future are at stake, too, in this debate 
in the U.S. Senate. 
I want to wish Isabelle a happy birth-
day tomorrow and my little grand-
daughter Jill a happy birthday on Fri-
day. 
Javier’s wife is also a nurse. She and 
Javier worry every day about not in-
fecting their baby daughter as they go 
to work to save other people, but they 
still get up every day and go to work to 
care for their patients. 
I want to thank Javier Quiroz Castro 
for 
his 
service. 
He 
is 
indeed 
a 
healthcare hero. He is an immigrant 
healthcare hero. He puts himself and 
his family at risk in order to save 
American lives. He shouldn’t have to 
worry about a decision across the 
street at the Supreme Court which 
would deport him back to a country he 
cannot even remember. 
We must do better. We are better 
than that as a country, to say to some-
one like Javier: Well, thank you for 
working so darn hard. Thank you for 
getting through nursing school with 
the highest grades. Thank you for your 
professionalism. Thank you for risking 
your life for America. But I am sorry, 
buddy, you are undocumented. Get out 
of the country. 
The bill that passed the House would 
protect him until the end of the year— 
until the end of the year. Yet Members 
come to the floor and mock this bill 
and say: Oh, you are trying to give 
things away to illegal immigrants. Ille-
gal immigrants like Javier? Get real. 
Get serious. Be human. 
We have to do better for Javier and 
the DACA recipients. They are count-
ing on us—those of us in the Senate— 
to solve this crisis created by President 
Trump’s action. 
As long as I am a Senator, I will con-
tinue to come to the floor of the Sen-
ate to advocate for Javier and the 
Dreamers. I have done it for a long 
time, but the job is not finished. It 
would be an American tragedy to de-
port this brave and talented nurse who 
is saving lives in Houston, TX, as we 
speak. We must ensure that Javier and 
hundreds of thousands of others in our 
essential workforce are not forced to 
stop working when we need them the 
most. 
Ultimately, we need to pass legisla-
tion that demonstrates who we are, 
what we believe in, and what our val-
ues are. What does it say about Amer-
ica if we say to Javier ‘‘We don’t need 
you’’? We do. We need him and so many 
just like him who are performing es-
sential services at this time of national 
emergency. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Ohio.

THOUSAND TALENTS PLAN 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, last 
week I came to the floor of the Senate 
to talk about how the tragic spread of 
the coronavirus around the world un-
derscored the need for us to focus on 
the persistent challenge of China not 
playing by the rules. 
In the case of coronavirus, that was 
about China not telling the World 
Health Organization, not telling other 
countries, and not telling their own 
people what was happening in terms of 
the coronavirus and not taking steps to 
stop international travel early on. 
That wasn’t playing by the WHO 
rules—the World Health Organization 
rules—and the result has been devasta-
tion. It has meant the spread of the 
virus. So much of that devastation we

May 20, 2020 
have seen around the globe, in my 
view, could have been avoided had they 
played by the rules. 
Unfortunately, not playing by the 
rules applies to China in many other 
areas too. We have talked a lot about 
trade on the floor of the Senate, to be 
sure that there is a level playing field 
between China and the United States 
and making sure they play by the 
international trading rules. But here is 
another one where China and the Chi-
nese Communist Party have not played 
by the rules, and that is with regard to 
obtaining our intellectual property, 
our innovation, and our research. 
In the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations, which I chair, we found 
not playing by the rules to be the case 
when we conducted a bipartisan, year-
long investigation into how China has 
used so-called talent recruitment pro-
grams—most notably its Thousand Tal-
ents Plan—to steal U.S. taxpayer-fund-
ed research to help fuel the rise to both 
the Chinese military and the Chinese 
economy over the past 20 years. It has 
been going on for two decades. 
You might ask, how has this hap-
pened? How could this be possible? This 
is how it happens. Every year, Federal 
grant-making agencies, like the Na-
tional Institutes of Health, the Depart-
ment of Energy and their National 
Labs, the National Science Founda-
tion, and others, give out more than 
$150 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds for 
research. That is quite a bit of money. 
For the most part, this system works 
well. American taxpayers send the 
money to these Federal grant-making 
agencies here in Washington, which 
then give it out to the best researchers 
and the best research labs in the coun-
try. It has resulted in important new 
breakthroughs in science, technology, 
healthcare, energy, military equip-
ment, and more. 
The NSF helped fund the creation of 
the internet. The NIH has funded re-
search into very successful and innova-
tive treatments for cancer and other 
diseases. So there is a lot of good stuff 
coming out of these research dollars. It 
has made America really the leader in 
the world on innovation and new ideas. 
For the most part, this Federal re-
search funding has enjoyed broad bi-
partisan support here in the Congress. 
But guess what. It has also attracted 
interest from researchers around the 
world who want the chance to take a 
part in this cutting-edge research. 
That is good, too, as long as they play 
by the rules. 
What we have learned and we proved 
through our report is that this system 
is very vulnerable to theft by other 
countries. That is exactly what has 
happened in the case of China. 
China has made no secret that its 
goal is to surpass the United States as 
the world leader in scientific research. 
They have seen an opportunity to get 
ahead by exploiting this system of tax-
payer-funded grants and the open and 
collaborative research enterprise that 
we have in this country. They have 
taken advantage of that. 
Specifically, the Chinese Government 
has systematically targeted the most 
promising U.S. researchers. So they 
find out somebody is doing some re-
search on something interesting to 
them, and they systematically target 
that person. They have been paying 
these grant recipients to take their re-
search—remember, research paid for by 
U.S. taxpayer dollars—and apply what 
they have learned here in labs over in 
China at Chinese universities affiliated 
with the Chinese Communist Party. 
The research they are taking over to 
China isn’t just going toward academic 
purposes. That wouldn’t be right, ei-
ther, because our taxpayer dollars are 
going in to fund this research. They are 
then leapfrogging us by getting that 
research. But it is not just for aca-
demic purposes. Often, the research 
ends up going directly into things like 
advancing China’s military, which has 
made great strides in the last two dec-
ades, 
advancing 
its 
technological 
growth, its economy, its manufac-
turing processes, and so on. 
A State Department witness at one 
of our Senate hearings on our report 
said this: ‘‘The Chinese Communist 
Party has declared the Chinese univer-
sity system to be on the front line of 
military-civilian 
fusion 
efforts 
for 
technology acquisition.’’ So there is a 
clear link here between the research 
going to these Chinese university labs 
and that same research being used to 
allow China to effectively leapfrog us 
in terms of their military improve-
ments and their economic growth. 
Part of the reason it has gone on so 
long, frankly, is because we have been 
asleep at the switch. We haven’t been 
focused on this. We do have an open, 
collaborative research system in this 
country, and we haven’t been effective 
at cracking down on this intellectual 
property theft. That is starting to 
change, and I am appreciative of that. 
It started to change, frankly, in the 
wake of our subcommittee investiga-
tion. The Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations hearings also helped. 
Our report also helped. During one of 
our hearings, the FBI actually ac-
knowledged what has been happening. 
This is what the FBI said: ‘‘With our 
present-day knowledge of the threat 
from Chinese talent plans, we wish we 
had taken more rapid and comprehen-
sive action in the past, and the time to 
make up for that is now.’’ I appreciate 
the candor. I appreciate the fact that 
the FBI was willing to say: Now that 
we have learned all of this, we should 
have been acting on this a long time 
ago. We are going to do it now and 
make up for lost time. 
They have been much more aggres-
sive. Since our hearing and detailed re-
port last November, we have seen a 
number of high-profile arrests of aca-
demics in this country who have con-
sistently hidden their participation in 
China’s Thousand Talents program and 
have taken research over to China. 
You may remember hearing about 
this issue earlier this week when a Har-
vard 
professor 
named 
Dr. 
Charles 
Lieber, who was the chair of Harvard 
University’s 
chemistry 
department, 
was accused of secretly taking money 
from China and sharing his U.S. tax-
payer-funded research with the Chinese 
Government. It was really a shocking 
example of this. 
But he is not the only case. In March, 
we received news of another arrest of a 
professor who used to work at West 
Virginia University who participated 
in Thousand Talents. In this case, the 
Justice Department found that he had 
convinced his employer—a U.S. public 
university—to give him paid parental 
leave funded by American taxpayers 
while he went to China to work at a 
university there to continue his work 
on specializing molecular reactions 
used in coal conversion technologies. 
This is from West Virginia University. 
These two cases would be bad enough 
on their own, but since the start of this 
month, we have actually had three 
more cases announced by the Depart-
ment of Justice and the FBI in relation 
to this Thousand Talents program. I 
commend the DOJ and the FBI for 
their work to continue to crack down 
on this program and to go after these 
problems, but they need better tools to 
do it. 
About 2 weeks ago, a former Emory 
University professor pled guilty to fal-
sifying his tax returns to conceal his 
work for the Chinese Government. The 
professor worked simultaneously and 
secretly for 6 years for both Emory 
University and overseas for Chinese 
universities affiliated with the Com-
munist Party of China, conducting 
similar research projects at both insti-
tutions. Despite this clear conflict of 
interest, he failed to report any of his 
at least $500,000 in foreign income on 
his Federal tax returns. 
That very same day, a professor at 
the University of Arkansas was ar-
rested on charges of wire fraud for al-
legedly failing to disclose his ties to 
the Chinese Government, despite being 
required to do so as a grant recipient of 
money from NASA—NASA. 
Just this past week, we found out 
that this problem had reached my 
home State of Ohio when the Depart-
ment of Justice announced the arrest 
of a researcher previously affiliated 
with the world-renowned Cleveland 
Clinic. This researcher had received 
more than $3.6 million in taxpayer- 
funded grants from the National Insti-
tutions of Health—again, taxpayer dol-
lars. To secure that grant, he is ac-
cused of lying to hide the fact that he 
was given a deanship at the university 
in Wuhan, China. 
He is also accused of lying about his 
Chinese Government-funded research 
directly overlapping with his NIH-fund-
ed research. According to the criminal 
complaint, he received $3 million in 
funding from China to run a shadow lab 
in Wuhan to replicate his Cleveland 
Clinic research, along with free travel 
and free lodging funded by the Chinese 
Government. It says he even admitted

that he hand-carried samples of bio-
logical material from Cleveland, OH, to 
Wuhan. Those samples are still stored, 
by the way, in China. 
It also states that he did not disclose 
that one of his Chinese grants required 
that he be in Wuhan for 10 months of 
the year at the same time he was also 
employed full time at the Cleveland 
Clinic, again, working on NIH-funded 
research. 
I commend the Cleveland Clinic for 
working with the FBI and the U.S. At-
torney’s Office to ensure that we were 
able to stop this from happening. 
As a Thousand Talents member, the 
criminal complaint also alleges that 
this individual recruited around 40 to 
50 other U.S.-based researchers for his 
Chinese university by hosting events at 
Harvard and other schools in the 
United States. 
This is a big deal, and it needs to 
stop. I commend the Assistant Attor-
ney General for National Security, 
John Demers, for his work on this and 
other cases and also U.S. Attorney Jus-
tin Herdman of the Northern District 
of Ohio, FBI Special Agent in Charge 
Eric Smith, and all the members of 
their team for their work on this 
Cleveland Clinic case. 
Again, these cases are all positive 
steps in the right direction, but the 
problem, as you might notice, is that 
none of these criminal charges and ar-
rests were actually based on partici-
pating in a Thousand Talents program 
or even hiding that from the U.S. Gov-
ernment research institutions or uni-
versities. The criminal charges and ar-
rests were all for other crimes, like 
perjury, wire fraud, and tax evasion. 
That is because, amazingly, failing to 
disclose on a grant application to re-
ceive U.S.-taxpayer funds that you are 
receiving compensation—clear conflict 
of interest—from a foreign government 
and giving them your research is not 
currently a crime. That needs to 
change. 
One example: The Emory University 
professor, according to the law, only 
committed tax fraud, while the Arkan-
sas professor only committed wire 
fraud. The fact that these are tech-
nically only financial crimes show that 
we are still just nibbling around the 
edges of this problem. It is time for us 
to get at the underlying flaw in our re-
search enterprise of talent programs 
enticing researchers here in the United 
States to steal for other countries. We 
are going to need targeted legislation 
that will take direct action against 
this practice, and that is exactly what 
we have done. 
Along with a group of colleagues, in-
cluding Democrat TOM
CARPER, the 
ranking member of the Permanent 
Subcommittee on Investigations, we 
are 
introducing 
the 
Safeguarding 
American Innovation Act, which is 
going to build on the recommendations 
made in our PSI report and address 
some of these root causes of the ongo-
ing IP theft that is currently going on. 
First and foremost, our bill is going 
to help the Department of Justice go 
after the Thousand Talents partici-
pants by allowing DOJ to hold Federal 
grant recipients accountable for failing 
to disclose their foreign ties on Federal 
grant applications. This isn’t just 
about more arrests, either. We should 
all agree that transparency and hon-
esty in grant applications are critical 
to the integrity of U.S. research, and 
this provision will help to promote 
those principles. 
Our 
bill 
makes 
other 
important 
changes, as well, based on the rec-
ommendations in our report. It re-
quires the Office of Management and 
Budget, or OMB, to streamline and co-
ordinate grant-making between these 
Federal agencies, so there is needed ac-
countability and transparency when it 
comes to tracking the billions of dol-
lars of taxpayer funds in grant money 
that is being distributed. 
We have worked closely with NSF, 
NIH, Department of Energy, and others 
on this important piece of legislation. 
They agree it is important. It allows 
the State Department to deny visas to 
foreign researchers who are seeking to 
access sensitive U.S. research when 
there is a threat to our economic or 
our national security. This may sur-
prise you, but they can’t do that now. 
Career Foreign Service officers and em-
ployees of the State Department have 
begged us for that authority. 
Our bill also requires research insti-
tutions to have safeguards in place to 
prohibit unauthorized access to sen-
sitive research because we found that 
to be a serious problem. And our bill 
ensures transparency by requiring uni-
versities to report any foreign gift of 
$50,000 or more, and it empowers the 
Department of Education to fine uni-
versities that repeatedly fail to dis-
close these gifts. 
Right now, our No. 1 priority is and 
should be solving the coronavirus cri-
sis. I get that. By the way, the FBI 
sent a notice around last week to uni-
versities and research institutions say-
ing: Watch out because there are actu-
ally Chinese hackers trying to get your 
research on coronavirus. It just hap-
pened last week. 
I have to tell you that in the context 
of this crisis, we have to reevaluate 
how we do business with China. We 
have to look at this with fresh eyes and 
realize that in many areas China has 
not been playing by the same set of 
rules as the rest of the world. 
We talked about that earlier, with re-
gard to trade and with regard to re-
porting on the coronavirus. I think in a 
fair and straightforward manner, we 
have to lead in insisting that there be 
a level playing field, whether it is the 
WHO or whether it is transparency 
with coronavirus or trade policy or 
how research is acquired. 
My hope is that our PSI report and 
the legislation we are introducing will 
let us reset the way we conduct our re-
search. Our goal should be to continue 
to reward those who come to our shores 
and discover new breakthroughs in 
science and technology. We want that. 
We are very proud of the fact that we 
are the most innovative country in the 
world and we are known for our re-
search enterprise. We want to continue 
that, but we want to do it in a smart 
way. We want to be sure that we are 
keeping China and other nations and 
competitors from stealing that re-
search for its own purposes. I know we 
can achieve that balance. Our legisla-
tion does that. 
I look forward to getting support 
from both sides of the aisle because 
this is a problem we should all be con-
cerned about. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 3608 
Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want 
to talk for a few minutes about the 
Coronavirus Relief Fund Flexibility for 
State and Local Government Act. Be-
fore I get to my motion, I just want to 
make a couple of points. 
Point 1, as you know, we have passed 
four bills dealing with the pool of mis-
ery America and the world find them-
selves 
in 
with 
respect 
to 
the 
coronavirus. We have spent a breath-
taking amount of money. I never imag-
ined that I would vote for bills of the 
magnitude that I have voted for, but 
we all did what we had to do. 
If you add up the four bills, we have 
spent $3 trillion so far. I have expressed 
it this way before, but I am going to 
keep doing it because it is just a 
breathtaking amount of money: $3 tril-
lion is 3–0-0–0-0–0-0–0-0–0-0–0-0 taxpayer 
dollars. We may have to spend another 
$3 trillion. 
As you know, we set up some facili-
ties at the Federal Reserve. They are 
called 13(3) facilities, through which 
the Federal Reserve is loaning money 
to American businesses to try to keep 
them afloat after the government shut 
down the American economy. 
The Federal Reserve cannot lose 
money. I am not suggesting that all $3 
trillion that the Federal Reserve ends 
up loaning out will remain unpaid. I 
hope not. But for the portion that does 
go into default, we are going to have to 
appropriate money to cover those 
losses. We already appropriated $450 
billion, but if the losses go higher, we 
have to cover them. 
We have spent $3 trillion for certain 
and, potentially, we are going to have 
to spend another $3 trillion. It is a 
staggering amount of money. The en-
tire U.S. economy, the greatest econ-
omy in all of human history, to put 
things in context, is $21 trillion a year. 
That is how much we produce a year if 
you add up all the goods and services 
that we, as Americans, produce. 
As you know, Speaker PELOSI has in-
troduced yet another bill, a fifth bill. 
The House has passed it. It was on a 
party-line vote. I think one Republican 
voted for the bill. A number of Demo-
crats voted against it. It was a close

May 20, 2020 
vote, but the House passed it at Speak-
er PELOSI’s suggestion. It would cost 
another $3 trillion. 
I have to tell you, when I first heard 
about the bill and after I looked at the 
bill, I was very, very surprised. I was 
shocked. I don’t mean to overstate my 
case. I didn’t faint or anything, but 
maybe it would be fair to say that my 
emotions were a cross between surprise 
and shocked. 
It is not a coronavirus bill. It is a 
‘‘remake American society’’ bill. For 
one thing, it would cost another $3 tril-
lion. I am not going to recite the zeros 
again, but $3 trillion is $3,000 billion on 
top of the money we have already 
spent. It really would remake Amer-
ican society. 
The 
Speaker 
included 
provisions 
about immigration laws. A lot of tax-
payer money would be given to people 
who are in our country illegally. It 
would let Federal prisoners go free. It 
would expand the Affordable Care Act, 
which even President Obama calls 
Obamacare. 
I 
remember 
when 
ObamaCare passed. We were promised— 
President Obama promised—that if you 
pass this bill, health insurance will be 
cheaper, and it will be more accessible, 
and your life will be better. None of 
those things have any resemblance to 
reality. 
Of course, I could go on about Speak-
er PELOSI’s legislation. It is not going 
to pass the Senate. I suspect she knows 
that. What is going to happen next in 
this opera? Well, if past is prologue, 
the majority leader and the minority 
leader in the Senate and the majority 
leader in the House and the Speaker 
and Secretary Mnuchin—all of whom I 
have respect for—will go off and they 
will negotiate a deal, and then they 
will come back and they will present it 
to the Senate and the House. I could be 
wrong, of course. I am in labor, not 
management. I could be wrong, of 
course, but the bill will not go through 
regular order. It will never be consid-
ered by committee. We probably will 
not be allowed to amend the bill be-
cause a deal has been made. It will be 
‘‘take it or leave it.’’ 
Now, if past is prologue, given the 
circumstances, people will moan and 
groan, but they will vote for the bill, 
whether they know what is in it or not, 
whether they were included in the dis-
cussions or not. That is what happened 
with the CARES Act. 
I am not sure that is going to happen 
this time. I am not sure that this time 
the 
non-negotiating 
Senators 
and 
House Members are going to moo and 
follow their leaders into the chute like 
cows. I think this time might be dif-
ferent. I am not saying that is a good 
or bad thing. It depends on what the 
deal is. I am raising the possibility. 
Speaker 
PELOSI
could 
eliminate 
every other word in her bill and cut the 
price tag in half and I still don’t think 
that the Republicans of the Senate are 
going to support it. If she takes out all 
the goodies for the leftwing—the left 
leftwing—of her party—I don’t use that 
in a pejorative sense. If she takes out 
all the goodies that remake Western 
civilization in her bill, I am not sure 
that the leftwing of her party in the 
House is going to vote for it. What I am 
saying is, for better or worse, I am not 
sure there is going to be a fifth bill. 
That is point 2. 
Point 3, let me go back to our 
CARES Act. In our CARES Act, we 
spent an enormous amount of money to 
help States and to help local govern-
ments. We gave $150 billion directly to 
States 
and 
cities 
to 
combat 
the 
coronavirus. We appropriated extra 
money on top of that for public 
schools. We appropriated extra money 
on top of that $150 billion for univer-
sities. We appropriated extra money on 
top of all that for our hospitals, many 
of which are public. 
We appropriated extra money on top 
of all of that to give States extra Med-
icaid money. My State received $1.8 
billion for State and local government, 
$300 million for public schools, $200 mil-
lion for universities, over $600 million 
and climbing for our hospitals, and 
extra Medicaid money. It is about $3.5 
billion in Louisiana. That is a lot of 
money along the bayou. 
I want to dissuade people who say we 
haven’t done anything for State and 
local government. We have. We have 
done a lot. That is point 3. 
Point 4, I am not guaranteeing it is 
my final point, but I intend it to be. 
Point 4, the $1.8 billion that we gave 
State and local government has re-
strictions. It can only be spent com-
bating the coronavirus. If you don’t 
spend it combating the coronavirus, 
you are supposed to give it back. That 
will happen when donkeys fly. We will 
never see that money again. It is spent, 
for better or worse. And I voted for the 
bill. I don’t think any fairminded per-
son can deny the fact—and I think it is 
a 
fact—that 
as 
a 
result 
of 
the 
coronavirus, just as the Federal Gov-
ernment has had and will have revenue 
shortfalls, so will State governments 
and so will cities. People haven’t been 
paying sales tax because they haven’t 
been buying stuff. People haven’t been 
paying income tax at the State and 
local levels because they haven’t been 
working. I wish that weren’t the case, 
but it is a fact. 
My bill would say to those States and 
cities: You can use the $1.8 billion to 
offset revenue shortfalls. Some of my 
colleagues for whom I have great re-
spect—one of them is here tonight, 
Senator RICK SCOTT, and I mean that. 
He was a heck of a Governor. He is a 
heck of a Senator. They have argued 
that we shouldn’t give that flexibility 
because some States are mismanaged. I 
agree with that. I do. If I were King for 
a day and had a magic wand, I would 
take all of the many measures that 
then-Governor SCOTT implemented in 
Florida and say we need to do these in 
every State. We can debate whether 
that would violate federalism, but I 
watched him carefully as Governor. He 
was a great Governor. When he inher-
ited Florida, it was a mess, and he 
cleaned it up. 
So when he and others make the 
point that we shouldn’t bail out mis-
managed States, I agree with that. But 
I can’t divorce myself from the fact 
that every State—mismanaged, well 
managed, medium managed, poorly 
managed—has revenue losses as a re-
sult of the coronavirus. That doesn’t 
mean that they shouldn’t cut their 
budgets. That doesn’t mean that they 
shouldn’t 
scrub 
their 
budgets. 
We 
ought to do it at the Federal level. 
That will happen, too, when donkeys 
fly. We expect our friends at the State 
level and at the local level to scrub 
their budgets, but I still think they are 
going to come up short. I worry that if 
they do that and they have to start 
laying off first responders, it is going 
to hurt the recovery. 
Now, not everybody agrees with what 
I have just said, and not everybody 
agrees with Senator SCOTT’s position. 
Reasonable people disagree sometimes. 
But this much I also know: Whether 
you agree or disagree for the next 6 
months, Senator SCOTT is not going to 
convince, 
for 
example, 
Governor 
Cuomo of New York to adopt his posi-
tion. I am pretty confident of that. And 
over the next 6 months, Governor 
Cuomo is not going to convince—I 
know this—Senator SCOTT to adopt his 
position. In the meantime, we have a 
problem to deal with. 
I will make one final point. Some of 
my colleagues have said: KENNEDY, we 
don’t need your bill because the Treas-
ury Department through the Secretary 
of Treasury has issued directives say-
ing that the money can be used for 
first responders. 
Now, look, I am a big Secretary 
Mnuchin fan. I think he has been a 
rockstar through this process, but I 
don’t understand this concept of a di-
rective. I know what a rule is. I know 
what a regulation is. I know what due 
process is. I know what the Adminis-
trative Procedure Act is, and I don’t 
think a directive fits into those cat-
egories. 
I also know that a Secretary of a de-
partment, no matter how bright and 
capable and talented he may be, cannot 
change an act of Congress, and the 
CARES Act doesn’t say a dadgum thing 
about using this money for first re-
sponders. If I am a Governor, I am 
going to worry that, if I do spend the 
money without an act of Congress, that 
someday: Knock, knock, knock on my 
door. Hello? I am from the government. 
In fact, I am an inspector general, and 
I want to see your books, and I have 
looked at your books, and I want you 
to give that money back. It has hap-
pened before. 
The only way to give our friends in 
State and local government security is 
for us to pass law, not for the bureauc-
racy to tell us what we did. We know 
what we did. 
Look, I know that some on my side 
of the aisle disagree with me, and I 
have learned a little bit in 31⁄2 years. I

have learned two things mostly. I 
learned this the first week: Everybody 
up here who smiles at you is not your 
friend. And, No. 2, I have learned up 
here you have got to watch what peo-
ple do, not what they say. 
This bill is not coming to the floor of 
the U.S. Senate anytime soon. I know 
that. I get it. I am just saying it 
should. I am saying it if it does—if it 
does—it will get 90 votes. I am saying, 
finally, that these revenue losses are 
real. Managed, mismanaged—we can 
debate that forever. They are real, and 
we have got to get this economy up and 
going again. If States are laying off 
teachers and first responders and po-
licemen and firemen and people at pub-
lic hospitals or raising taxes, it is 
going to be that much harder. That is 
why we ought to pass my bill. 
It doesn’t spend a single, solitary 
new penny—no new money. It just 
gives Governors and mayors a little 
more flexibility. 
For that reason, I have to read this 
long script. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that, at a time to be determined 
by the majority leader in consultation 
with the Democratic leader, the Com-
mittee on Appropriations be discharged 
from further consideration of S. 3608 
and the Senate proceed to its imme-
diate consideration; I further ask unan-
imous consent that there be 2 hours of 
debate, equally divided between the 
proponents and the opponents of the 
bill, and that upon the use or yielding 
back of that time, the Kennedy sub-
stitute amendment No. 1581 be consid-
ered and agreed to; that the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time, and that the Senate vote on pas-
sage of the bill, as amended, with a 60 
affirmative vote threshold for passage 
with no intervening action or debate; 
finally, if passed, the motion to recon-
sider be considered made and laid upon 
the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
reserving the right to object. 
The first thing I want to do is I want 
to thank my colleague from Louisiana 
for the kind words about my tenure as 
Governor and tell him I respect and ad-
mire his passion for being a U.S. Sen-
ator and his passion for the wonderful 
State of Louisiana, which is a wonder-
ful State. 
As we all know, this is a challenging 
time for every level of government. 
This crisis was unprecedented, and 
Congress absolutely took bold action 
to stem the spread of the virus and 
work to save our economy. But if we 
are not careful, Congress will create 
another 
equally 
devastating 
crisis 
down the road, a crisis of our own mak-
ing. 
Our national debt and deficits—al-
ready at unsustainable levels—have 
skyrocketed as Congress has spent, as 
my colleague said, almost $3 trillion to 
address this crisis. To put that in per-
spective, Congress has spent $9,000 for 
every American—$9,000 for every Amer-
ican. 
At some point, we need to start 
thinking about the impact this spend-
ing will have on the future of our chil-
dren and our grandchildren and how we 
are impacting our ability to fund our 
military and our safety nets like Social 
Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. 
Again, I know everyone here, includ-
ing 
my 
colleague 
from 
Louisiana, 
wants to help their State. I want to 
help States too, which is why I support 
continuing the existing restrictions 
tied to the coronavirus relief fund that 
were included in the CARES Act to 
make 
sure 
this 
spending 
is 
for 
coronavirus relief and response. Re-
gardless of whether we are removing 
existing guardrails or talking about 
completely new funding, both actions 
would result in a blank-check bailout 
for States. 
Let’s remember, we are talking about 
$150 billion. To put that in perspective, 
the median income for a worker in 
Florida is approximately $30,000; $150 
billion will pay the total annual in-
come for more than 5 million Florid-
ians. 
And let’s talk about who we are bail-
ing out here: Not those on unemploy-
ment, we took care of them in the 
CARES Act; not our teachers, we took 
care of them in the CARES Act; not 
our healthcare workers, we took care 
of them in the CARES Act. 
We are bailing out liberal politicians 
who cannot live within their means, 
and now, we are asking Floridians to 
pay for the incompetency of Governors 
like Andrew Cuomo. We know Cali-
fornia, New York, and Illinois have no 
problem using hard-earned taxpayer 
dollars to fund their liberal priorities 
and to backfill their budget shortfalls 
and solve their longstanding fiscal 
problems. But it is not fair to the citi-
zens of States like Florida, where we 
made the hard choices to put our State 
on a financially secure path. 
The Wall Street Journal laid it out 
clearly for us this week when they 
said: 
Democrats in Albany are claiming to be 
victims of events that are out of their con-
trol. But they have increased annual spend-
ing by $43 billion since 2010—about $570,000 
for each additional person. Florida’s annual 
budget has increased by $28 billion while its 
population has grown by 2.7 million—a 
$10,400 increase per new resident. 
New York has a top state-and-local tax 
rate of 12.7 percent, while Florida has no in-
come tax. Yet New York has a growing budg-
et deficit, while Mr. SCOTT, as Governor of 
Florida, inherited a large deficit but built a 
surplus and paid down State debt. The dif-
ference is spending. 
The Wall Street Journal concluded: 
The policy question is why taxpayers in 
Florida 
and 
other 
well-managed 
States 
should pay higher taxes to rescue an Albany 
political class that refuses to restrain its tax 
and spend governance . . . Mr. Scott is right. 
The Wall Street Journal is right, so 
is the Chicago Tribune, which called 
out its own State leaders this week for 
mismanaging Illinois taxpayer dollars. 
The Chicago Tribune said: 
Preparing for the next recession and the 
next unanticipated crisis—think pandemic— 
is a huge component of leadership. So when 
our politicians whimper that they’re helpless 
in the face of disaster, remember: They and 
their forebears had decades in which to pre-
pare for whatever would surprise them. In-
stead they chose to borrow more money, 
spend on new programs and watch their pen-
sion indebtedness sore. 
American families make responsible 
budgetary decisions every day. Suc-
cessful companies make responsible 
budget decisions every day. Well-man-
aged States like Florida have done it 
for years. It is time for New York, Illi-
nois, and California to do the same. 
Let’s look at—and my colleague said 
some of this: We have given States $150 
billion—billion—for their COVID ex-
penses. 
Now, to put that in perspective, with 
hurricanes, we don’t give 100 percent. 
We had four major hurricanes while I 
was Governor. The Federal Govern-
ment, one, did not cover all the ex-
pense of the hurricane and did not 
cover any budget shortfalls I had, any 
lost revenues I had, which I had when 
tourists couldn’t come during a hurri-
cane and after. 
Five hundred billion dollars in short- 
term loan opportunities for municipal 
governments, $45 billion in FEMA dis-
aster funds, $30 billion for education, 
and we have no earthly idea whether 
education costs have gone down or 
gone up. I would assume education 
costs have gone down; $34 billion for 
mass transit community grants; $270 
billion for emergency appropriations; 
$50 billion for Medicaid, and, again, we 
haven’t seen it, but I would assume our 
Medicaid costs so far have gone down. 
Then on top of it, through the small 
business relief, individual checks, un-
employment, we have given our States 
another $1.3 trillion. 
Now, put that in perspective, their 
annual revenues, not including Federal 
dollars, is a little over $1 trillion a 
year, so look at what we have already 
spent. So as you can see from this 
chart, Congress has already allocated 
billions in direct and indirect aid to 
States and localities. 
Total direct funding from the Federal 
Government exceeds $1 trillion dol-
lars—trillion. Even this doesn’t begin 
to account for another $1.3 trillion in 
indirect assistance to small businesses, 
individuals, and increased unemploy-
ment benefits to families in all of our 
States. 
These numbers, as my colleague has 
said, are staggering, what we have al-
ready spent. We have to get serious 
about how we are spending taxpayer 
money and the fact that this year’s 
Federal budget deficit will be the larg-
est in the history of our Nation. 
While it may be tempting and easy to 
believe that removing the restrictions 
on the coronavirus relief fund will sat-
isfy States looking for a bailout, I am 
afraid that we are all mistaken. It will 
never be enough. These funds are still

needed, one, for coronavirus relief, and, 
unfortunately, many States have not 
been shy about their desire for hun-
dreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer 
bailouts for their liberal agendas. 
I am not going to let this happen. I 
think about this in the context of my 
seven grandchildren. We cannot saddle 
them and children like them all across 
our great country with mountains of 
debt. Right now, the debt stands at 
over $77,000 per American. 
Now, think about that for a second. 
The median income for Americans is 
about $33,000, and we already have put 
them on the hook for $77,000—$9,000 
just with what we have done this year. 
Now, to put that in perspective, after 
the first 200 years of this country’s ex-
istence, national debt per person was 
around $3—$3, after 200 years—and now, 
we are at $77,000. 
I think about that in the context of a 
Social 
Security 
recipient 
like 
my 
mom. How are we helping people like 
my mom when we run multiple tril-
lion-dollar deficits and grow our na-
tional debt to an excess of $26 trillion? 
What happens to those living on fixed 
incomes when our deficits and national 
debt cause high inflation? 
I grew up in a poor family in public 
housing. My mom worked three jobs 
and my parents—my adopted dad and 
my mom—were constantly struggling 
for work. Even though my mom had no 
money, she told me: You are the 
luckiest kid alive because you grew up 
in this country. She was optimistic, 
and she was hopeful. She told us that 
we were blessed because God and our 
Founders created the greatest country 
ever, where anything was possible. 
To take away the same opportunities 
I had to live the American Dream from 
our children and grandchildren would 
not only be a political failure, it would 
be an abdication of our moral responsi-
bility. 
It is time we make the hard choices 
to put our Nation on a path to recov-
ery—recovery from this virus, from the 
economic devastation it brought with 
it, and the fiscal calamity that decades 
of politicians have ignored. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
this fight to keep our country’s future 
bright. To do that, we have to make 
hard choices; we have to be fiscally re-
sponsible. 
Mr. President, I therefore respect-
fully object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
f 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. President, I am 
here on the floor to talk about how 
Congress can do a better job in re-
sponding to the coronavirus pandemic 
that has gripped our country. 
I just thought that debate was great, 
something we just heard a moment ago 
about what we should do going for-
ward. 
This crisis is unlike anything we 
have ever seen. I mean, it has dev-
astated so many families. It has turned 
our lives upside down. It has put an 
enormous strain on our healthcare sys-
tem; 
and 
our 
frontline 
healthcare 
workers, our researchers, our first re-
sponders are working around the clock 
to help patients and look for treat-
ments. For the past couple of months, 
every American has been asked to do 
his 
or 
her 
part 
through 
social 
distancing, through doing smart things 
like wearing masks, like being sure 
that we are doing all we can within our 
home, within our workplace, and out in 
public to stop the spread of the dan-
gerous virus. 
I think these have helped. I think 
these measures have made a difference, 
and I think we are in a better place by 
most metrics on the public health dan-
ger. I just saw the numbers from Ohio 
a moment ago here, and we have fewer 
new positive cases today than we have 
had over the past week or the past few 
weeks on average, and so we are begin-
ning to make progress, but it has come 
at an enormous cost to our economy, 
and I would say even at an enormous 
cost to our culture and our society. 
Since the crisis began a couple of 
months ago, more than 36 million 
Americans have lost their jobs or filed 
for unemployment. Some estimates 
show that we could potentially hit a 25- 
percent unemployment rate before this 
is over. I think we probably will. By 
the way, that would match the worst of 
our country’s unemployment that we 
have ever seen, and that would be dur-
ing the Great Depression. That is 
where we are headed. 
Some small businesses have had to 
close their doors; others are teetering 
right on the brink of bankruptcy. Hos-
pitals have been closed for needed pro-
cedures like mammograms and cancer 
screenings. More are being missed 
every day, and basic healthcare is at 
risk. So that is one consequence that 
we don’t always focus on, but our 
healthcare system has had to respond 
to the coronavirus appropriately. 
But there is a balance here, and the 
result has been we have had other 
healthcare 
needs 
that 
have 
gone 
unmet. 
Without that revenue, by the way, 
from surgeries—so-called elective sur-
geries, although some aren’t very elec-
tive, like they are necessary surgeries 
for a back or a knee or something like 
that—many hospitals now are in very 
deep financial trouble because that is 
how they make most of their money. 
Colleges and universities, of course, 
are losing revenue, and children are 
out of school, which is not a good thing 
because our kids, many of whom are 
not able to get the same help at home 
that they can get at school are falling 
behind. 
We have also got to acknowledge the 
impacts of isolation on people’s mental 
health, on substance abuse. I talked to 
an individual earlier today who focuses 
a lot on human trafficking, an area I 
have worked a lot in, and he is talking 
about the increase he has seen in do-
mestic violence and human trafficking 
and the calls that have increased, the 
number of suicides. 
This is all troubling. This kind of a 
crisis, therefore, requires swift and de-
cisive action to ensure that we have 
got the resources and the help to be 
able to respond to both the healthcare 
crisis, which we have to address on the 
coronavirus front, but also on the eco-
nomic and the broader societal issues 
we talked about here and how it im-
pacts us and the rest of our lives. It is 
a tough balance. 
I think, for the most part, Congress 
and the Trump administration have 
done that. They have responded swiftly 
and correctly with major new legisla-
tion. We came together here in Con-
gress, on a bipartisan basis, to pass leg-
islation already that has addressed the 
healthcare crisis the virus has caused. 
We have also passed legislation that 
has helped the economic crisis caused 
by government at all levels effectively 
pumping the brakes on the economy. 
The legislation that has been en-
acted, of course, isn’t perfect. It is 
thousands of pages, and it is now four 
different bills that have been passed al-
ready. I think it was necessary for us 
to act quickly, in a unified manner, 
and on a bipartisan basis to get stuff 
done around here. By the way, that bi-
partisanship 
has 
been 
a 
welcome 
change because that is not typical for 
this place. 
So far, on each of the 4 pieces of leg-
islation we passed to respond to the 
challenges of this pandemic, an aver-
age of 500 of the 535 Members of both 
the House and Senate have voted in 
favor of passage. That is how bipar-
tisan it has been. Five hundred of the 
535, on average, have voted yes on 
these 4 pieces of legislation. 
These are not small bills. Combined, 
the funds provided by these first four 
rescue packages total about $2.8 tril-
lion. That is $2.8 trillion—$2,800 billion. 
Phase 3 of the CARES Act alone—the 
most recent one we passed—is about 
$2.2 trillion in resources. That is an un-
precedented amount of spending. It has 
never been done before. It has certainly 
never been done in such a short period 
of time. 
Now Congress is talking about a fifth 
rescue package. The fifth rescue pack-
age that is being talked about—it has 
already passed the House of Represent-
atives. It is being talked about even 
though—and this might surprise you— 
only about half of the $2.8 trillion in 
the first four packages has actually 
been disbursed. Think about that. Only 
about half of the money in the first 
four legislative projects that we have 
undertaken here has actually gone out 
the door to the intended recipients. Yet 
we are talking about another package. 
For example, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program to help small businesses 
stay afloat still has about 25 percent of 
its original capacity that hasn’t gone 
out, about $160 billion. Well below half

of the funding—the $175 billion that 
Congress provided to hospitals has yet 
to be sent out under the Provider Re-
lief Fund. Less than half of the 
healthcare dollars have even gone out 
the door. 
Of the roughly $450 billion that the 
CARES Act gave to Treasury to unlock 
the Federal Reserve lending facilities, 
less than $40 billion of that has been 
operational. That is right—less than 10 
percent of the money designated to 
provide direct lending to businesses of 
all sizes so they can stay in business 
and hire people has been sent out. 
So even though about half the money 
from the CARES Act hasn’t even been 
spent—and we still don’t have a good 
handle, of course, on how the money 
that has been sent out is being spent— 
Democrats in the House have gone 
ahead and passed a new rescue pack-
age. 
In many respects, it is a wish list of 
Democratic priorities that has been 
talked about here on the floor. Some 
are related to the coronavirus, and 
some are not. It passed by a near-party 
line vote. I think one Republican voted 
yes and more than a dozen Demo-
crats—more 
moderate 
Democrats— 
voted no. Again, this is a $3 trillion 
package—$3,000 billion. That is more 
than the total spending of all four of 
the previous coronavirus bills. So all 
four of the previous combined are less 
than the spending that the House is 
recommending for the fifth coronavirus 
bill. 
It is actually also a lot more money 
than Congress would normally appro-
priate in an entire fiscal year. It is 
about half of what we just appropriated 
from the fiscal year we are in, in one 
bill—in one bill. I am sorry; it is twice 
as much as Congress appropriated for 
the current 12-month period we are in. 
So the appropriations for this fiscal 
year, 2020, are less than half of what 
the House is now proposing to spend in 
one bill. 
I think, you know, we have to be very 
cautious, and we have to be sure it is 
the right amount of money going out 
because it is a huge and unprecedented 
spending package. Our annual deficit 
here in the Congress is already pro-
jected to be over $1 trillion. We were 
already running a large deficit. 
By the way, it has only been at that 
level four times in the history of our 
country. So the $1 trillion was already 
viewed by many of us, including me, to 
be an unacceptably high number for 
our annual deficit. Now the estimate is 
that this year’s annual deficit will be 
between $3.7 trillion and $4.2 trillion— 
mind-boggling. We have just never had 
deficits like these before. Of course, 
that adds to the $23 trillion national 
debt, which is already at record levels. 
We are entering dangerous, unchart-
ered waters here from a fiscal point of 
view. Most economists agree that this 
increases the chance of a fiscal and 
therefore a financial crisis that would 
follow. 
Of course, we have to respond to this 
immediate crisis. Again, I voted for the 
first four bills. I believe it was nec-
essary to act and act quickly, but I 
also believe there are real limits as to 
how much financial risk we should 
take beyond the, again, $2.8 trillion we 
have already spent in the first four 
bills. We have to be sure, at a min-
imum, that every new dollar is spent as 
wisely as possible, so it is as targeted 
as possible. 
Even overlooking the massive $3 tril-
lion price tag, by the way, the House 
bill also focuses on some things that 
just seem unrelated to this crisis. For 
example, the House spends $136 billion 
on repealing the cap on the State and 
local tax deduction. There is a deduc-
tion, but it is capped right now. 
By the way, this $136 billion policy 
they have in their bill would deliver 
half of its benefits—50 percent of its 
tax benefits to the top 1 percent of tax-
payers. Tell me how that is related to 
the coronavirus. To put that in some 
context, we can use that same amount 
of money—the $136 billion—to provide 
almost 2 million more PPP loans to 
small businesses that need it most: 
movie theaters, bowling alleys, res-
taurants, bars. 
There are also provisions that would 
force States to adopt broad changes in 
their election laws regardless of wheth-
er they want to. Election law has al-
ways been in the province of the 
States, but that is in this legislation. 
They also want to raise taxes on em-
ployers. Bad time to raise taxes. We 
want employers to stay in business be-
cause they are the ones who create the 
jobs. 
They also want to help cannabis 
growers, which I think is interesting. 
Cannabis is mentioned dozens of times 
in the legislation. 
They also want $50 million, as an ex-
ample, 
for 
environmental 
justice 
grants. What does that have to do with 
the coronavirus? 
Once more of the existing funds are 
delivered—in other words, as I said ear-
lier, of the first four bills, only about 
half of it has even gone to the intended 
recipients. Once more of these existing 
funds are delivered and we know more 
about what is working, what is not 
working, and where the needs are, I 
suspect more funds will be needed. 
They will probably be needed for the 
healthcare side of this—for testing, as 
an 
example—and 
that 
is 
probably 
money well spent. 
There probably needs to be more 
flexibility, as the Senator from Lou-
isiana just talked about. I believe there 
does need to be more flexibility. I also 
believe we need to find out, once the 
money goes to the local communities, 
what their budgets look like. Do they 
need more money to be able to con-
tinue to provide police protection, fire-
fighters’ salaries, and EMS services? 
We don’t know that yet. How can we 
know it when the money hasn’t even 
gone down yet? In Ohio, not one penny 
is gone except for the amount that 
went directly to the largest five coun-
ties and the one large city. But the 
part that went to the State hasn’t even 
gone down to the local communities, 
and that is happening all over the 
country. 
We need more information to be able 
to know how much of this new spend-
ing is necessary. But again, even with 
all the new spending, this new $3 tril-
lion House bill does very little to do 
something else really important in the 
next bill, which is help get the econ-
omy moving. Again, it raises taxes on 
businesses. It does some other things 
that have nothing to do with the 
coronavirus. What it doesn’t do is it 
doesn’t provide the stimulus you would 
hope would be in the next bill we are 
going to pass because that is what ev-
erybody is looking for right now. How 
do you do something here in Wash-
ington to make it easier to create jobs, 
make it easier to invest, make it easier 
for small businesses to get back on 
their feet? 
Much of what we did in the first four 
bills was really a rescue package, and 
it was necessary. People had lost their 
jobs for no reason that they could do 
anything about. It wasn’t their fault— 
36 million Americans. We had to do 
something to shore that up—the direct 
payments, unemployment insurance, 
and other things. We had to help small 
businesses with the PPP program to 
ensure they weren’t going to close 
their doors, some forever. 
Those were more rescue packages to 
get us through the storm, to weather 
the storm. Now we have to figure out 
how we do something to actually get 
this economy moving. That ought to be 
the goal because there is a limit to how 
much Federal tax dollars can be relied 
on to subsidize the economy. The bet-
ter way is to get the economy moving, 
get revenues flowing again, and reopen, 
therefore, our hospitals and schools. 
Hospitals can get more revenue if they 
can reopen and do more procedures, 
and they can keep from either shutting 
their doors or relying on the Federal 
taxpayer for more and more subsidies. 
Getting back to work is critical, and 
we have to do it in a safe way, and we 
can. 
We have to use social distancing 
smart practices. We have to be sure we 
have the testing. I agree with all that. 
But any new legislation that Congress 
considers has to include measures that 
are going to help get people back into 
the workforce safely and get this econ-
omy moving again. I think that should 
include some tax incentives for invest-
ment and jobs. I think it should in-
clude some targeted infrastructure in-
vestments to create good jobs and also 
economic benefits that come from the 
right kind of infrastructure. 
I think one place to start is Federal 
highway projects. We need to pass that 
bill around here. Also, there are a 
bunch of State highway projects that 
would normally be funded by the State 
gas tax. Because we aren’t driving 
nearly as much, the State gas tax has 
plummeted. In the State of Ohio, for 
instance, there are a lot of great

projects out there that have gone 
through all the process. They have 
been 
vetted, 
and 
they 
have 
gone 
through a merit-based process. They 
are ready to go. In other words, they 
are shovel-ready. Yet the State is not 
going to have enough money to pay for 
them. 
So rather than sending the money to 
the States, how about sending some 
money directly to these infrastructure 
projects? Good jobs. Economic benefits. 
The analysis is, in the right kind of in-
frastructure investments, you spend a 
dollar and you get back more than a 
dollar in terms of revenue from the 
economic benefit. That is the sort of 
thing I think should be in this next 
package to help get the economy back 
on its feet. 
Right now, I am told by small busi-
nesses that one of the biggest barriers 
to getting the economy going is the un-
employment insurance provisions that 
were passed as part of the CARES Act 
back in March. This is what I am hear-
ing from small business owners all 
around Ohio—that the additional un-
employment insurance benefits in the 
CARES Act, which allow individuals at 
or below the average income to receive 
more in unemployment than they 
could get at work, is a disincentive to 
work. 
Of course, again, we needed to act to 
make sure people who lost their jobs 
through no fault of they own could get 
by while government at every level ef-
fectively pumped the brakes on the 
economy 
to 
better 
withstand 
the 
health crisis. In other words, people 
lost their jobs because the government 
said: You can’t go to work. 
At the same time, it was not the best 
solution to provide a flat $600 increase 
in benefits to everybody, which is on 
top of the State unemployment insur-
ance benefits, and that is what we did. 
That was the proposal here that was 
passed. That continues, by the way, 
until July 31. 
Wage replacement for people making 
at or below the average income level 
would have been a good and generous 
approach—in other words, saying: If 
you make up to whatever the wage av-
erage is in your State—$52,000 a year, 
$48,000 a year, or $58,000 a year—you get 
full wage replacement. But that is not 
what this is. The $600 on top of the 
State benefit, which is, on average, $360 
probably, puts you up near $1,000 a 
week. That is more than wage replace-
ment for people who make less than 
the average wage. 
Regardless of how you feel about the 
$600-per-week Federal increase, we are 
in a very different situation now than 
we were 2 months ago when we passed 
it. Back then, remember, we were en-
couraging people to stay home and not 
to go to work because that was the 
time period when we were shutting 
things down and we were giving stay- 
at-home orders. So it made much more 
sense to have an unemployment insur-
ance system that actually would en-
courage people to stay home. Now we 
are reopening all around the country, 
and, small business people are telling 
me: I would like to get started again, 
but I can’t get the employees. 
Some say: Well, you can go to that 
unemployment insurance office and say 
‘‘I have a job,’’ and then, under the 
State’s rules, they have to tell these 
people ‘‘You are no longer under UI, 
and you have to go back to work.’’ 
That is true, but, one, the unemploy-
ment insurance systems are over-
whelmed. They tell me that really is 
not something they have the capability 
of doing right now. They are over-
whelmed. They have never seen these 
kinds of numbers ever. 
Secondly, a lot of employers don’t 
want to do that, and I get it. Their em-
ployees are making a lot more money, 
in some cases, on unemployment insur-
ance than they can in their place of 
business, and they are just hesitant to 
tell them to come back and make less 
money. I do think there is a role for us 
to help make that happen and do it in 
a smart way. 
Things are different in other respects 
too. Not only is the economy starting 
to reopen around the country, but it is 
being done in a much safer manner. 
Why? Because we have a lot more test-
ing, and that is good. 
We need to do a lot more, by the way. 
Ohio has gone from about 3,700 tests 
per day a few weeks ago to over 10,000 
tests a day now. Soon it will be over 
20,000 tests a day in a couple of weeks, 
they say. That is good. 
We also have more PPE, personal 
protective gear, and that is important 
because if you reopen—say you run a 
factory. You want people to have the 
protective gear they need to keep them 
safe. 
Also, we finally have some anti-viral 
medications 
coming 
online, 
thank 
goodness. Remdesivir is the first one 
approved by the FDA. It is now in Ohio, 
my own State, and other States. Peo-
ple are using it. That is great. That 
gives people more comfort in being 
able to go back to work more safely. 
It is time to start to transition from 
thinking about helping people get by 
and helping to encourage them to stay 
home through unemployment to think-
ing about how we can get people back 
into the workforce safely so we can get 
this economy, our small businesses, 
our hospitals, our colleges and univer-
sities, back on track. 
We should also want to help people 
get back to work because that is good 
for everybody. It is where most people 
get their healthcare—from work, from 
their employer. We want to get them 
back to that. It is where most people 
get their retirement, their 401(k). Not 
everybody offers it, but if you have 
one, you are probably getting it from 
work. 
It is good to get people back to work 
and connected with their benefits. It is 
also good to get people returning to a 
safe workplace because that is what 
most people want to do. They want to 
go back to work. They don’t want to 
stay on unemployment insurance. Yes, 
it pays more for many Americans, but 
they would rather be at work. The dig-
nity and self-respect for work is real. It 
gives meaning to your life. 
I think we need to take a hard look 
at this flat $600 increase in the unem-
ployment benefits and ask ourselves 
whether it is really in the best interest 
of those workers, of our businesses. Is 
it really the best system to have it in 
place when we are trying to get people 
to get back to work? Again, this addi-
tional $600 benefit on top of the $360 av-
erage the States have means that un-
less 
you 
are 
making 
more 
than 
$50,000—or in some States, $60,000 a 
year—it is more advantageous to be on 
unemployment insurance than to go 
back to work. 
A recent study by the American Ac-
tion Forum and the University of Chi-
cago says that between 60 and 70 per-
cent of individuals on unemployment 
are making more than they did in their 
prior job—60 to 70 percent. Further, for 
about 20 percent of wage earners, they 
say, on average, they are making dou-
ble on unemployment insurance what 
they made in the workforce. So they 
say that for the bottom 20 percent of 
wage earners, on average, they are 
making double on unemployment in-
surance. 
Again, people needed the help. They 
needed direct payments, and they need-
ed the UI help. A lot of people lost 
their jobs and had no income coming in 
just to put food on the table, pay the 
rent, and pay their car payment. Some 
people used this UI, even though it was 
more than they were making before, to 
help with healthcare. That is impor-
tant. But isn’t the best thing to do is 
to get people back to work? 
We need to continue to help people 
during this time who have lost their 
jobs, no question. Not every business is 
ready to reopen, by the way, and the 
employees who had to be let go by 
some businesses certainly shouldn’t be 
punished for that. 
At the same time, we have to ask 
ourselves whether there is a way we 
can combine that need with the need to 
actually get people back to work as we 
reopen. I think there is. Specifically, I 
would propose that instead of keeping 
in place the additional $600 of the Fed-
eral benefit for people on unemploy-
ment between now and July 31, let’s 
shift some of those Federal dollars to a 
back-to-work bonus—a program where 
you let people take some of that $600 
with them to work. I propose $450 a 
week. Others have different numbers, 
probably. They think that is too much, 
or they think it is too little. I chose 
$450 per week because that represents 
the amount that would be needed to 
make a person making the average 
minimum wage better off in the work-
force than on unemployment. When 
you take the minimum wages around 
the country, on average, you take $450 
a week with you to work. That means 
that you would be making a little bit 
more in the workforce than you would 
be on unemployment.

What is more, this return-to-work 
bonus would put additional cash in the 
hands of individuals who lost their jobs 
due to the health crisis, which would 
provide additional stimulus to the 
economy, which is experiencing his-
toric declines in consumer spending. 
This incentive for people to get back 
into the workforce to get our economy 
running again is exactly the kind of 
policy we should all want. Instead, I 
will tell you that as for the $3 trillion 
House bill we talked about earlier, all 
it does is to propose extending the $600 
per month from the end of its expira-
tion at the end of July into the begin-
ning of next year. 
We talked earlier about how the next 
package—whatever it is—ought to en-
courage the economy to get moving 
again, right? The House bill doesn’t do 
that in a lot of respects we talked 
about. But, specifically, on unemploy-
ment insurance, what it says is, let’s 
continue this policy of making it hard-
er for people to get back to work. It 
will ensure that that 60 or 70 percent of 
the workforce that the study showed 
are making more on unemployment in-
surance would be better off staying on 
the unemployment rolls. 
By the way, it is also another $300 
billion of taxpayer spending in this $3 
trillion bill. I don’t think it is going to 
move our country forward. It is going 
to make it even harder to get back on 
track. 
By the way, our back-to-work bonus 
also benefits taxpayers. So instead of 
$300 billion in additional funding that 
is going to go into the House bill for 
unemployment insurance, if we assume 
that States would have trouble enforc-
ing their UI laws, which we talked 
about earlier, and that individuals 
would choose unemployment over re-
turning to work, even if 25 percent of 
those who were on unemployment in-
surance today chose to take advantage 
of this $450 bonus—and I think a lot 
will; I think a lot more than that will, 
but let’s be conservative, and let’s say 
that just 25 percent take advantage of 
it—that will result in tens of billions of 
dollars of savings to the taxpayer. 
Think about it. For the State, they 
will not have the unemployment insur-
ance benefit that they are providing 
because the person will be at work. 
That is good. And for the Federal Gov-
ernment, the $600 is reduced to $450. So 
that enables savings to the taxpayer. It 
enables people to get back to work. It 
allows our small businesses to be able 
to reopen. 
It is a solution that I think Repub-
licans and Democrats alike can get be-
hind. Let’s continue to help the people 
who can’t return to the workplace 
through no fault of their own, but let’s 
also remember that the American peo-
ple right now are looking to us here in 
Congress to come together on a bipar-
tisan basis to put in place policies that 
will actually help move us forward in 
this crisis, get back to normalcy, get 
back to work safely, and get our econ-
omy back on the historically strong 
footing it had here only a few months 
ago. 
Back in February, we had the 19th 
straight month of wage increases of 
over 3 percent, most of which was 
going to lower income and middle-in-
come workers. We had unemployment 
tied with the 50-year low. Unemploy-
ment was low then. It is incredibly 
high now. 
To get back to that, we have to put 
some more policies in place, and I be-
lieve the back-to-work bonus is exactly 
that. It will not solve everything, but 
it will help people get back into jobs, 
and it will send a clear message that 
Congress is looking forward and pro-
viding a positive path forward for 
workers, for small businesses, and for 
taxpayers. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, I was 
unable to attend the vote No. 93 on 
May 18, 2020, on the nomination of 
Scott H. Rash to be the United States 
District Court for the District of Ari-
zona. Had I been able to attend, I would 
have supported the nomination.

MEMORIAL DAY 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I 
rise today to pay special tribute to the 
Michigan heroes who have given their 
lives for their country while serving in 
our military. This is an especially fit-
ting time to do so as we commemorate 
the 75th anniversary this year of the 
end of World War II. 
The people of Michigan have always 
stood up whenever our Nation has 
needed us. That was certainly the case 
during World War II. Perhaps no State 
was as crucial to our Nation’s victory 
in the fight against tyranny as was 
Michigan. 
More than half a million Michigan 
men and women proudly served in uni-
form in the Pacific Theater, the Atlan-
tic Theater, and anywhere and every-
where we were called. Back home, the 
people of our State were hard at work 
producing the bombers, tanks, trucks, 
helmets, and guns needed to win the 
war. We were the Arsenal of Democ-
racy, and both at home and abroad, 
victory depended on us, the people of 
Michigan. 
We won that fight; yet the costs were 
staggeringly high. Sadly, more than 
10,000 Michiganders never made it 
home. These were our beloved children 
and 
parents, 
siblings 
and 
cousins, 
friends and neighbors. We were so in-
credibly proud of their willingness to 
give everything—even their lives—to 
defend freedom; yet that pride could 
never fully fill the aching loss our fam-
ilies and communities endured. Those 
losses are still felt 75 years later. 
Now, once again, Michigan is mourn-
ing. Far too many of our beloved chil-
dren and parents, siblings and cousins, 
friends and neighbors have been lost to 
an invisible enemy that can’t be seen 
or heard; yet just as we did in World 
War II—just as Michigan has always 
done—we are standing up, and we are 
fighting back, together. 
Our plants once produced bombers 
and tanks; today, they are producing 
ventilators and respirators, gowns and 
testing supplies. People are stepping up 
to serve across our State: tending the 
sick in our hospitals and clinics, deliv-
ering food to neighbors in need, even 
sewing masks to keep one another safe. 
Seventy-five years after World War 
II, a lot of things have changed, but 
one thing hasn’t: The people of Michi-
gan are still willing to step up and 
serve whenever and wherever we are 
needed, and we are needed today. 
On Memorial Day and every day, let 
us remember all servicemembers we 
have lost, thank those who are still 
with us, and surround our military 
families with love and support. Our 
military members and veterans have 
provided us the very best examples to 
follow. Let’s honor their service and 
sacrifice with our actions.

TRIBUTE TO MYRON LEPP 
Mr. CRAMER. Mr. President, I want 
to honor the half century of distin-
guished Federal service of a remark-
able North Dakota man who is retiring 
at the end of May. 
Myron Lepp has been the administra-
tive program director for the North Da-
kota office of USDA Rural Develop-
ment for the past 13 years. He took this 
position after 37 years in the military, 
retiring as a full colonel. In these 50 
years of service, Myron has brought 
knowledge, intelligence and dedication 
to everything he has undertaken. 
He began his military service in 1971 
and became a commissioned officer in 
1976. Myron served in the North Dakota 
National Guard as director of informa-
tion management for 12 years and later 
held other positions such as chief of 
staff for the adjutant general, State di-
rector of maintenance, and joint forces 
logistics director. In his final 2 years in 
the military, he was the national com-
mand logistics inspector for the Na-
tional 
Guard 
Readiness 
Center 
in 
Washington, DC, traveling every other 
week to conduct combat readiness in-
spections at all State Army National 
Guard units 
Myron brought this invaluable back-
ground to the USDA Rural Develop-
ment office, giving exemplary guidance 
to the crucial work this agency does to 
support 
our 
rural 
communities 
in 
North Dakota. His lifelong background 
in farming and ranching enhanced this 
work. Myron has raised crops such as 
wheat, oats, and corn, and he has a 
cow/calf operation near his hometown 
of Lehr. 
I came to appreciate Myron’s dedica-
tion and professional expertise when 
we worked together on North Dakota’s 
Roughrider Honor Flight program. As 
president 
of 
this 
program, 
Myron 
oversaw the work of many dedicated

volunteers who organized five flights 
for 500 veterans to visit the National 
World War II Memorial in Washington, 
DC. 
The profound impact Myron Lepp has 
made over these 50 years to enhance 
the military and agricultural strength 
of North Dakota will never be ade-
quately measured. We can only thank 
him for this service, which I want to do 
here on behalf of all North Dakotans. I 
congratulate him on his well-earned re-
tirement and wish him many years of 
health and happiness in the future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING STUDENTS WORKING 
ON COMMUNITY OUTREACH 
∑ Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, I am 
proud to recognize Kearsarge High 
School’s 
student 
group, 
Students 
Working 
on 
Community 
Outreach, 
SWOCO, for continuing to lift up their 
fellow classmates and support commu-
nity members—even from a distance— 
amid the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Even before the pandemic, SWOCO 
members worked hard to make a dif-
ference in their community. One of 
their 
most 
impressive 
accomplish-
ments was hosting a conference for 
neighboring school districts on how 
students could become stronger leaders 
in their communities. The group also 
partnered with the National Honor So-
ciety to organize blanket drives and 
food drives for Liberty House, a vet-
erans homeless shelter. 
Like so many Granite Staters, these 
students have needed to adjust to the 
new realities of this pandemic, includ-
ing finding ways to organize without 
being in the same physical space. 
Among other things, the students, who 
are now meeting over conference calls, 
organized both a student and teacher 
Zoom talent show in an effort to keep 
their classmates engaged with their 
school community during this chal-
lenging time. 
The members of SWOCO also started 
a Little Free Pantry project in Kear-
sarge, which is a grassroots movement 
to help members of the community 
who are food insecure access essentials, 
such as food and personal care items. 
The members are coordinating all of 
the 
food 
pantries 
throughout 
the 
school district and have encouraged 
various student organizations to sign 
up to help stock the shelves. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has caused 
Granite Staters to face unprecedented 
challenges, but even in the face of this 
crisis, they are coming together to sup-
port one another. For the members of 
SWOCO, 
this 
pandemic 
may 
have 
changed how they operate, but it did 
not change their mission or commit-
ment to their community and fellow 
citizens. Their commitment to forging 
ahead in difficult times to help people 
from all walks of life and to support 
their 
community 
exemplifies 
New 
Hampshire at its best. I am, above all 
else, grateful for their hard work and 
look forward to seeing what they ac-
complish next.∑

lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 589 
Whereas the people of the United States 
join together each May to pay tribute to the 
contributions of generations of Asian Ameri-
cans and Pacific Islanders who have enriched 
the history of the United States; 
Whereas the history of Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders in the United States is 
inextricably tied to the story of the United 
States; 
Whereas the Asian-American and Pacific 
Islander community is an inherently diverse 
population, composed of more than 45 dis-
tinct ethnicities and more than 100 language 
dialects; 
Whereas, according to the Bureau of the 
Census, the Asian-American population grew 
faster than any other racial or ethnic group 
over the last decade, surging nearly 72 per-
cent between 2000 and 2015; 
Whereas there are approximately 22,000,000 
residents of the United States who identify 
as Asian and approximately 1,600,000 resi-
dents of the United States who identify as 
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, 
making up nearly 7 percent of the total pop-
ulation of the United States; 
Whereas the month of May was selected for 
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month be-
cause the first Japanese immigrants arrived 
in the United States on May 7, 1843, and the 
first transcontinental railroad was com-
pleted on May 10, 1869, with substantial con-
tributions from Chinese immigrants; 
Whereas section 102 of title 36, United 
States Code, officially designates May as 
Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month and 
requests the President to issue an annual 
proclamation calling on the people of the 
United States to observe the month with ap-
propriate programs, ceremonies, and activi-
ties; 
Whereas 2020 marks several important 
milestones for the Asian-American and Pa-
cific Islander community, including—

aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery of Elli-
son Shoji Onizuka, the first Asian American 
in space; 
(2) the 45th anniversary of the end of the 
Vietnam War and the beginning of the 
Southeast Asian diaspora to communities 
across the United States; 
(3) the 45th anniversary of the completion 
of 
the 
double-hulled 
voyaging 
canoe, 
Hokulea, marking the first traditional Poly-
nesian voyaging canoe built in Hawaii in 
more than 600 years; 
(4) the 55th anniversary of the enactment 
of the Act entitled ‘‘An Act to amend the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, and for 
other purposes’’, approved October 3, 1965 (79 
Stat. 911), landmark legislation that re-
versed 
restrictive 
immigration 
policies 
against immigrants from Asia; and 
(5) the 110th anniversary of the establish-
ment of Angel Island Immigration Station in 
San Francisco Bay, California, which served 
as a major port of entry for immigrants com-
ing to the United States from Asia and the 
Pacific; 
Whereas Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers have made significant contributions 
to the United States at all levels of the Fed-
eral Government and in the United States 
Armed Forces, including— 
(1) Daniel K. Inouye, a Medal of Honor and 
Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient 
who, as President pro tempore of the Senate, 
was the highest-ranking Asian-American 
government official in the history of the 
United States;

(2) the Territories of American Samoa, 
Guam, and the Commonwealth of the North-
ern Mariana Islands; 
Whereas, in 2020, Asian Americans and Pa-

Whereas, since January 2020, the increased 
use of anti-Asian terminology and rhetoric 
related 
to 
the 
2019 
novel 
coronavirus 
(COVID–19) has perpetuated an anti-Asian 
stigma and has resulted in a dramatic in-
crease in reports of hate crimes and inci-
dents against individuals of Asian descent; 
Whereas there remains much to be done to 
ensure that Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers have access to resources and a voice 
in the Government of the United States and

Whereas celebrating Asian/Pacific Amer-
ican Heritage Month provides the people of 
the United States with an opportunity to 
recognize the achievements, contributions, 
and history of, and to understand the chal-
lenges faced by, Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the significance of Asian/Pa-
cific American Heritage Month as an impor-
tant time to celebrate the significant con-
tributions of Asian Americans and Pacific Is-
landers to the history of the United States;

HAWLEY, Mr. CASEY, Mr. JONES, Ms. 
WARREN, Mr. GRASSLEY, Mr. SCOTT of 
South Carolina, Mr. BRAUN, and Ms. 
ROSEN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
S. RES. 590 
Whereas millions of older adults in the 
United States (referred to in this preamble 
as ‘‘seniors’’) are targeted by scams each 
year, including Social Security imperson-
ation scams and Internal Revenue Service 
impersonation scams, sweepstakes scams, ro-
mance scams, computer tech support scams, 
grandparent scams, debt scams, home im-
provement scams, fraudulent investment 
schemes, and identity theft; 
Whereas other types of fraud perpetrated 
against seniors include health care fraud, 
health insurance fraud, counterfeit prescrip-
tion drug fraud, funeral and cemetery fraud, 
‘‘anti-aging’’ product fraud, telemarketing 
fraud, and internet fraud; 
Whereas, in 2020, scammers are exploiting 
the ongoing coronavirus crisis to prey on 
seniors through a variety of scams, including 
economic impact payment scams, test kit 
scams, contact tracing scams, and work- 
from-home scams; 
Whereas the Government Accountability 
Office has estimated that seniors lose a stag-
gering $2,900,000,000 each year to an ever- 
growing 
array 
of 
financial 
exploitation 
schemes and scams; 
Whereas, since 2013, the fraud hotline of 
the Special Committee on Aging of the Sen-
ate has received more than 9,500 complaints 
reporting possible scams from individuals in 
all 50 States, the District of Columbia, and 
the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; 
Whereas the ease with which criminals 
contact seniors through the internet and 
telephone 
increases 
as 
more 
creative 
schemes emerge; 
Whereas, according to the Consumer Sen-
tinel Network Data Book 2019 released by 
the Federal Trade Commission, people age 60 
or 
older 
reported 
losing 
approximately 
$445,000,000 to fraud in 2019, with a median 
loss for victims age 80 or older of $1,600, more 
than triple the median amount lost by vic-
tims between the ages of 50 and 59; 
Whereas senior fraud is underreported by 
victims due to shame, stigma, and lack of in-
formation about where to report fraud; and 
Whereas May 15, 2020, is an appropriate day 
to establish as ‘‘National Senior Fraud 
Awareness Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the designation of May 15, 2020, 
as ‘‘National Senior Fraud Awareness Day’’; 
(2) 
recognizes 
National 
Senior 
Fraud 
Awareness Day as an opportunity to raise 
awareness about the barrage of scams that 
individuals age 65 or older in the United 
States (referred to in this resolution as ‘‘sen-
iors’’) face in person, by mail, on the phone, 
and online; 
(3) recognizes that law enforcement, con-
sumer protection groups, area agencies on 
aging, and financial institutions all play 
vital roles in— 
(A) preventing the proliferation of scams 
targeting seniors in the United States; and 
(B) educating seniors about those scams; 
(4) encourages— 
(A) the implementation of policies to pre-
vent scams targeting seniors; and 
(B) the improvement of efforts to protect 
seniors from those scams; and 
(5) honors the commitment and dedication 
of the individuals and organizations that 
work tirelessly to fight against scams tar-
geting seniors.

the United States was $1,240,000,000,000; 
Whereas African American women were as

tion; 
(2) the economic consequences of depleted 
resources; and 
(3) the moral and political consequences of 
a growing world population that is vulner-
able to extreme weather, famine, and other 
stressors exacerbated by climate change; 
Whereas 
multiple 
national 
and 
inter-
national scientific reports have concluded 
that the climate crisis is an urgent threat to 
the planet and all life on the planet that re-
quires urgent action; 
Whereas, as of the date of introduction of 
this resolution, there are 74,000,000 children 
and youth under 18 years of age in the United 
States; 
Whereas young individuals were critical in 
the 
organization 
and 
mobilization 
of 
20,000,000 individuals on the first Earth Day 
in 1970, making that celebration the largest 
environmental grassroots event in history at 
that time; 
Whereas the first Earth Day spurred broad 
support for environmental conservation and 
contributed to the creation of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency and the enact-
ment of bipartisan bedrock Federal environ-
mental protections, including the Clean Air 
Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Federal Water 
Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.),

climate activism that has led to hundreds of 
thousands of individuals in the United States 
demanding climate action; 
Whereas 
low-income 
communities

communities of color continue to face dis-
proportionate harm from climate change, 
pollution, and environmental degradation; 
and 
Whereas the mission and purpose of Earth 
Day remains relevant in 2020 for a new gen-
eration to face environmental challenges 
that lie ahead: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate—
