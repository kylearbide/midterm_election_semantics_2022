PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
Heavenly Father, thank You for giv-
ing us another day. 
We thank You for every day You give 
us to be here at the seat of partici-
pative government. Bless the work of 
all the men and women who represent 
the people of the United States. Fill 
them with wisdom and good will, that 
they might better work together for 
the benefit of our Nation. 
Bless all the leaders of all the 
branches of our government at the end 
of a difficult week when the divisions 
in our polity and our faith have been 
on open display for all the world to see. 
Father, forgive us and send us Your 
spirit, that we might indeed heal the 
divisions and learn to love those with 
whom we disagree, even our enemies. 
May all that is done this day be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

RECOGNIZING GUN VIOLENCE 
SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Madam Speaker, I want 
to recognize National Gun Violence 
Survivors Week and the 58 percent of 
Americans who have experienced gun 
violence in their lifetimes. 
Gun 
violence 
kills 
nearly 
40,000 
Americans every year; more than half 
of those deaths are suicide. Another 
100,000 people are physically caught 
wounded in the crossfire. 
Entire 
communities 
suffer, 
too— 
those that may never shake the trau-
ma, fear, anxiety, and sadness of vio-
lent tragedy, like my friends Marge 
Sexton, Jami Amo, Jennifer Lugar, 
Julia Spoor, gun violence survivors 
who live with the scars of unimagi-
nable tragedy and yet continue to fight 
for sensible gun violence prevention 
legislation. 
Our communities should be safe, joy-
ful places. We should not live in fear of 
gun violence at our public schools, our 
places of worship, movie theaters, 
music venues, night clubs, or even in 
our homes. 
This National Gun Violence Sur-
vivors Week, let’s hold survivors closer 
in prayer, in love, and in action and 
promise we will do more and every-
thing we can to end the crisis of gun vi-
olence in this Nation. 
f 
THE FLANNEL CHECK CHALLENGE 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to raise awareness of the 
need for annual physicals through my 
participation in the Flannel Check 
Challenge. 
The goal of Flannel Check is simple: 
Wear flannel; schedule your annual 
physical screening; and cure diseases 
early. 
Some may ask, why flannel? The an-
swer is that every individual disease 
has a color to raise awareness, like 
pink for breast cancer, light blue for 
prostate cancer, red for heart disease, 
and so on. Flannel and plaid patterns, 
which come in countless color com-
binations, create one identifiable pat-
tern for all diseases. 
The unfortunate reality is that dis-
ease is all around, and the key to de-
feating any disease is by catching it 
early through annual physicals. How-
ever, only 20 to 25 percent of males and

60 to 65 percent of females go in for 
physicals every year. 
Madam Speaker, we must work to-
gether to raise awareness on this im-
portant issue. So I encourage everyone 
to participate in Flannel Check’s chal-
lenge by wearing flannel and sched-
uling an annual physical today. 
Together, we can help save lives. 
f 
PROVIDING YELE SOWORE WITH 
DUE PROCESS RIGHTS 
(Mr. GOTTHEIMER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
this morning, hardworking families 
across northern New Jersey woke up, 
made breakfast, and wished each other 
good-bye before leaving for work or 
school. 
But our thoughts are with one family 
that was unable to be together this 
morning, this Sowore family from 
Haworth in Bergen County. That is be-
cause Yele Sowore, a husband, father, 
and 
neighbor, 
remains 
in 
Nigeria 
awaiting the outcome of his pending 
trial. 
For months, members of the New 
Jersey delegation, including Senator 
MENENDEZ and Senator BOOKER, have 
been closely following Mr. Sowore’s 
case and working together with the 
Haworth community to advocate on be-
half of our neighbor and friend. 
We were relieved when, in December, 
after months of detention, Mr. Sowore 
was finally released on bail. But we 
continue to urge the Government of Ni-
geria to follow its own laws and to do 
the right thing: providing Yele with 
the due process rights he deserves. 
I want to recognize Yele’s family, es-
pecially his wife, Ope, who has dealt 
with a trying situation with extraor-
dinary courage and determination. 
As Representative of the Fifth Con-
gressional District, I am very proud to 
stand beside Yele’s many friends and 
neighbors 
throughout 
north 
Jersey 
whose hope is that he will soon be able 
to be reunited with his family. We are 
thinking of him, praying for him, and I 
will not stop working until he comes 
home. 
f 
HONORING JAMES BLACKBURN 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life of Mr. James Blackburn, who 
passed away on January 22 at the age 
of 94. 
Mr. Blackburn dedicated his life to 
practicing law and using his craft to 
make the Savannah area a better place 
to live. He was sworn in to the bar over 
70 years ago and worked as the city at-
torney for the city of Savannah until 
he was 86. He even continued to legally 
represent the Savannah Airport Com-
mission until just last year, when he 
was 93 years old. 
But his service to the public went 
much further than the law. He served 
in the United States Navy during 
World War II as a radarman on a tug-
boat, was a recorder with the Alee 
Shrine, and was a former president of 
the 
Kiwanis 
Club 
of 
Savannah. 
Through all of his work, he believed in 
treating all people with fairness, dig-
nity, and compassion. 
His family and friends will be in my 
thoughts and prayers during this most 
difficult time. 
f 
HONORING KEVIN HARDEN 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to share the story of my 
State 
of 
the 
Union 
guest, 
Kevin 
Harden, a West Philly native, a suc-
cessful attorney, and a gun violence 
survivor. 
When Kevin was in college, he sur-
vived five gunshot wounds during an 
altercation at the Myers Recreation 
Center in Southwest Philadelphia. 
Kevin’s life had not been easy. His 
mother suffered from addiction, and his 
father juggled several jobs to make 
ends meet. His neighborhood lacked 
economic and educational opportunity. 
In the 2 years after the shooting, he 
lost both parents to cancer and as-
sumed responsibility as primary care-
taker for his younger siblings. 
Kevin’s turbulent childhood did not 
diminish his spirit. He was fortunate to 
find mentors. He graduated from col-
lege and decided to pursue law school. 
He became a successful lawyer and now 
works in his community to extend a 
helping hand to others like him. 
We know there isn’t a one-size-fits- 
all solution to gun violence, but every 
day that we fail to act, we fail our chil-
dren and our country. It has been 345 
days with no action or vote from the 
Senate on commonsense gun safety 
measures passed by the House. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF TROOPER 
JOSEPH BULLOCK 
(Mr. MAST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MAST. Madam Speaker, I speak 
to honor the life of Trooper Joseph 
Bullock, whose watch ended on the 
morning of February 5, 2020, when fa-
tally shot in the line of duty. 
Trooper Bullock’s life was devoted to 
protecting those he had never met, in 
the Air Force and the Florida Highway 
Patrol for 19 years, and he paid dearly 
that others would be safe. 
There are no words or actions that 
can repay the debt we each owe heroes 
like Trooper Bullock. It would be fruit-
less for me to attempt words to remove 
grief from his family or fellow troop-
ers. 
I can only offer from our Nation the 
most ardent thanks for sharing him as 
a protector and pray to our Father in 
Heaven that every thought of him is a 
cherished memory and pride that he 
was a man who laid down his life for 
others. 
f 
HONORING BOB MARLEY 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday was the birthday of Bob 
Marley. 
Born on February 6, 1944, in Jamaica, 
he became a reggae pioneer. From 
humble beginnings, Marley went on to 
sell more than 20 million records and 
was inducted into the Rock and Roll 
Hall of Fame in 1994. 
His music has served as an inspira-
tion and mantra for social movement. 
Let’s hear some of those words now: 
How can you be sitting there 
Telling me that you care— 
That you care? 
When every time I look around, 
The people suffer in the suffering 
In every way, in everywhere. 
And: 
Emancipate yourself from mental slavery, 
None but ourselves can free our minds. 
Have no fear for atomic energy, 
‘Cause none of them can stop the time. 
How long shall they kill our prophets 
While we stand aside and look? 
Some say it’s just a part of it, 
We’ve got to fulfill di book. 
Won’t you help me sing 
These songs of freedom? 
‘Cause all I ever had, 
Redemption songs. 
We need redemption. 
Happy birthday to Bob Marley. 
f 
INDIANA’S EARLY COLLEGE 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM 
(Mr. PENCE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize seven high schools 
located in Indiana’s Sixth District for 
their extraordinary Early College De-
velopment Program that I observed 
when I was at Lawrenceburg High 
School. 
Participating in this program are 
also high schools in Greensburg, Con-
nersville, Richmond, Muncie Central, 
Delta, and the New Castle Career Cen-
ter. 
The Early College Development Pro-
gram provides students the ability to 
earn both a high school diploma and an 
associate’s degree or up to 2 years’ col-
lege credit towards a bachelor’s degree. 
The Early College Development Pro-
gram also provides higher learning at a 
much lower cost, with early college 
tuition waived for some students. 
I am proud to see the Hoosier State 
being a leader in education, preparing 
our students for the future, and finding 
solutions to fight the rising cost of 
higher education.

CELEBRATING 60TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE SAN DIEGO VOICE & 
VIEWPOINT 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with what little voice I have to 
honor the San Diego Voice & View-
point Newspaper in recognition of their 
60th anniversary. 
San Diego’s Voice & Viewpoint is the 
largest African American newspaper in 
San Diego and is a core piece of our 
community. This newspaper’s success 
was the result of a dedicated couple’s 
hard work. 
Though the newspaper began in the 
1960s, John Warren and his wife, Gerri 
Warren, took over the publication in 
1987. The couple was deeply involved in 
the African American community and 
showed their leadership skills in pub-
lishing. Their efforts have resulted in a 
nationally award-winning publication. 
The newspaper has highlighted the 
perspectives of the San Diego African 
American community and provided a 
great service to the city. In fact, the 
publication is in all the zip codes of 
San Diego and has a readership of over 
60,000. 
I would like to honor the San Diego 
Voice & Viewpoint for its dedication 
and lifelong commitment to the Afri-
can American community and the San 
Diego community. 
f 
PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS 
FREEDOM 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. 
Madam Speaker, yesterday’s National 
Prayer Breakfast brought to my mind 
the quote by President Lincoln: ‘‘I 
have been driven many times upon my 
knees by the overwhelming conviction 
that I had nowhere else to go.’’ 
I, like Lincoln, feel inadequate to my 
task at times. I, like Lincoln, seek 
strength and discernment from prayer. 
I need prayer. 
It is not just Members of Congress 
that should be allowed to call upon 
prayer. Students, like my three sons, 
and millions more, deserve this power-
ful tool. That is why I thank the ad-
ministration for their recent decision 
to protect the right to pray in schools. 
The freedom to seek strength from 
someplace other than ourselves en-
riches this Nation, just as it enriched 
President Lincoln.

EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL AP-
PROPRIATIONS 
FOR 
DISASTER 
RELIEF AND PUERTO RICO DIS-
ASTER TAX RELIEF ACT, 2020 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on H.R. 5687. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
VARGAS). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from New 
York? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 833 and rule 
XVIII, the Chair declares the House in 
the Committee of the Whole House on 
the state of the Union for the consider-
ation of the bill, H.R. 5687. 
The Chair appoints the gentlewoman 
from Florida (Ms. CASTOR) to preside 
over the Committee of the Whole. 
b 0917 
IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, 
the 
House 
resolved 
itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the state of the Union for the 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 5687) 
making emergency supplemental ap-
propriations for the fiscal year ending 
September 30, 2020, and for other pur-
poses, with Ms. CASTOR of Florida in 
the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the 
bill is considered read the first time. 
General debate shall be confined to 
the bill and shall not exceed 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Appropriations. 
The gentlewoman from New York 
(Mrs. LOWEY) and the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. GRANGER) each will 
control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
In recent weeks, thousands of fami-
lies in Puerto Rico were forced from 
their homes, schools were flattened, 
roads and infrastructure were severely 
damaged as earthquakes racked an is-
land still struggling to recover from 
the devastation of Hurricanes Maria 
and Irma. 
While President Trump has finally 
released some of the aid that Congress 
appropriated 
for 
those 
hurricanes, 
more support is clearly needed. We 
must act now on our shared responsi-
bility to assist Americans in need. 
This emergency supplemental would 
provide $4.67 billion in targeted assist-
ance to help families and communities 
recover from these devastating earth-
quakes and put Puerto Rico on a better 
path to long-term recovery. 
It includes: $3.26 billion in Commu-
nity Development Block Grant Dis-
aster Recovery funds; 
$1.25 billion for repairs to damaged 
road systems; 
$100 million to restart school oper-
ations; 
$40 million for disaster nutrition as-
sistance in Puerto Rico; and 
More than $20 million to help address 
the island’s energy needs. 
In addition, this bill would provide 
Puerto Rico with flexibility to use this 
funding in conjunction with earlier dis-
aster relief resources. 
Critically, it also takes swift action 
against the Trump administration’s 
outrageous withholding of vital aid to 
Puerto Rico. This bill would require de-
tailed spending plans and mandate that 
funding be released in a timely man-
ner. 
Finally, the bill carries a number of 
tax-related provisions in the jurisdic-
tion of the Committee on Ways and 
Means that will complement the emer-
gency 
appropriations 
and 
support 
working families and encourage eco-
nomic growth. 
Madam Chair, our fellow Americans 
in Puerto Rico need our help. Unless 
we step up to the plate right now, we 
further jeopardize their safety and se-
curity. 
With this bill, we can provide fami-
lies and communities swift relief and 
put Puerto Rico on the path to long- 
term recovery. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
support of this legislation, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise today in opposition to H.R. 
5687. 
While this bill is being sold as an ap-
propriations bill for Puerto Rico, it has 
more than $16 billion in unnecessary 
tax breaks which are largely unrelated 
to the recent earthquakes that hit the 
island. 
Also included in this bill are more 
than $4 billion in new emergency ap-
propriations, much of that for disasters 
that haven’t happened yet. 
And finally, this bill is premature, as 
Puerto Rico has funds from previous 
bills that have not been used. 
Over the last 3 years, we have allo-
cated more than $40 billion for Puerto 
Rico disasters, and less than half of 
that has been spent. And we have all 
seen recent press reports about ware-
houses in Puerto Rico full of water, 
diapers, and food that have not been 
distributed to residents in need. 
As for the recent earthquakes in 
Puerto Rico, the Federal Government 
has not completed the required studies 
and reporting on the extent of the dam-
age. 
While I, too, have been frustrated 
with the amount of time it takes the 
Federal 
Government 
to 
distribute 
funds after a disaster, appropriating 
funds before we know what is truly 
needed is not the answer. 
There are billions in the FEMA 
Major Disaster Relief Fund that are al-
ready available and can be used toward 
earthquake response and recovery ef-
forts now, while we wait on a full and 
accurate report on the damage and es-
timated cost. 
When disasters strike, it is our job to 
ensure that the Federal Government 
helps those in need. We also have a 
duty to ensure that taxpayer dollars 
are used in a fiscally responsible man-
ner. 
Unfortunately, including tax breaks 
related to disaster recovery and funds

for disasters that haven’t even oc-
curred yet is not a good use of taxpayer 
funds. 
Again, when funds are needed, we 
will be there, just as we have been 
there repeatedly for Puerto Rico for 
the last several years. But at this time, 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR), the 
distinguished chairwoman of the Sub-
committee on Energy and Water Devel-
opment, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. KAPTUR. I thank our hard-
working chair, NITA LOWEY, for yield-
ing me this time. 
Madam Chair, I rise in support of 
H.R. 5687, the Puerto Rico earthquake 
supplemental funding. 
This $4.67 billion in funding is a vital 
lifeline for our fellow citizens in Puer-
to Rico reeling most recently from a 
series of devastating earthquakes, but 
also still recovering from the con-
sequential damage of 2017’s massive 
Hurricanes Irma and Maria. 
Since late December, a series of 
quakes rattled Puerto Rico, including 
another magnitude 5 earthquake just 
this last Tuesday. Today, this body 
sends a powerful message to the island 
community: This House will not let 
you suffer from inaction by this admin-
istration. 
Following the most powerful quake 
in early January, millions were left 
without power and running water for 
days. The electric grid struggled to 
keep up with demand. Anxiety remains 
high as more than 30 category 5 or 
higher 
earthquakes 
have 
hit 
this 
month. 30. Unbelievable. 
As we learned from Hurricane Maria, 
the aftermath can prove to be even 
more dangerous and deadly if there is 
not speedy and effective action. And I 
want to thank the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers, and also the Ohio National 
Guard that has made journeys there, 
and other defense units that have risen 
to duty to protect and serve the people 
of our country in Puerto Rico. 
This emergency supplemental will 
provide these hard-hit, anxiety-ridden 
fellow Americans and communities 
with strength, hope, and support to 
begin moving forward again. A failure 
to act now is not just unacceptable, it 
is immoral. 
This bill provides the means to ad-
dress current challenges inflicted on 
the human condition. It also includes 
funds to strengthen infrastructure for 
future mitigation. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. I yield the gentle-
woman from Ohio an additional 30 sec-
onds. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Within my subcommit-
tee’s Energy and Water accounts, the 
bill provides over $21 million for the 
Department of Energy to provide tech-
nical assistance help restore and re-
build the electric grid in Puerto Rico 
and other U.S. territories. These funds 
will allow the Department and our Na-
tional Labs to provide the expertise 
necessary to begin the repair. 
Equally important is the significant 
financial support to meet the edu-
cational needs of island children for 
disaster nutrition assistance and repair 
all of the infrastructure. 
This Nation must help destroyed 
communities of our fellow citizens to 
help them recover from these historic 
disasters. We never know when it will 
hit our own backyard. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
important emergency supplemental. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, I thank Ranking 
Member GRANGER for yielding. 
Since December 28, Puerto Rico has 
experienced more than 2,100 earth-
quakes that have significantly im-
pacted our southwestern region. Actu-
ally, I was on the island on January 6 
when a 5.8 earthquake struck us, and 
then the next day, a 6.4, and then half 
an hour later another 6.2. 
I thank the President for imme-
diately issuing an emergency declara-
tion and, days later, a major disaster 
declaration, which prompted imme-
diate Federal assistance to the now 29 
municipalities that have been hit the 
most. 
However, the seismic activity has not 
stopped. Every day the infrastructure 
weakens. More roads and houses are 
damaged. The anxiety of the people on 
the island grows; and that is why I 
stand here today in support of this dis-
aster supplemental package. 
I am thankful to Chairwoman LOWEY 
for introducing this bill. And yet, in 
order to get this legislation enacted 
into law, in order to truly get the aid 
to Puerto Rico and other States and ju-
risdictions affected by natural disas-
ters, it is imperative to have the input 
of both sides of the aisles, Senate and 
House administration, and get this 
ready to go. 
So it is my sincere hope that, as we 
move forward with this bill, and the 
negotiations that may begin as a result 
of it, that we keep in mind that we are 
dealing with real people’s lives and 
their suffering here. 
Every week, every single week, when 
I go back home, I meet with people who 
have lost everything due to the earth-
quakes. And again, we are used to hur-
ricanes, but we are not used to earth-
quakes, so this is a completely new 
game in Puerto Rico. 
I meet parents who are too fright-
ened to send their kids to schools, and 
families refusing to return home out of 
the fear that their houses will collapse.

At one point, over 7,000 people were 
living in shelters, many establishing 
campsites on the side of the road, in 
parks, and in open areas. The devasta-
tion, my friends, is real. 
It is true that the island has already 
allocated over $40 billion, not $90 bil-
lion, in funding to respond to the un-
precedented Hurricane Maria. However, 
we are dealing here with an entirely 
different disaster. And let me say, of 
all that money that has been allocated, 
just $1.5 billion has been disbursed, so 
we don’t have the cash, and we don’t 
have the funds that Congress already 
allocated 2 years ago. 
The earthquakes are ongoing. The 
ground has not stopped shaking. While 
FEMA and the administration officials 
are onsite, Congress cannot wait until 
funds are depleted to act. 
Madam Chair, I want to highlight 
also the tax provisions included in this 
bill for Puerto Rico. Although some 
may argue that they have no place in a 
supplemental, 
these 
provisions 
are 
vital for the long-term recovery of the 
island and all those efforts. 
I thank Chairman NEAL for crafting 
this package, including legislation that 
I have previously introduced, such as 
H.R. 302, to provide families in Puerto 
Rico with one or more children the 
same treatment currently given to is-
land families with three or more kids 
under the child tax credit; H.R. 1786, to 
make the rum cover-over tax perma-
nent on the island—we managed to in-
clude a 5-year extension, but now this 
will make it permanent; and a provi-
sion extended to the earned income tax 
credit for the island, which is similar 
to legislation I introduced in H.R. 754. 
I will always stand with the people I 
represent. I am the sole representative 
of the people of the island, 3.2 million 
Americans. Yet, we don’t have a dele-
gation in the House and in the Senate 
to support and push for these kinds of 
bills. That is why I am supporting this 
bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to 
do the same. 
What has happened in Puerto Rico, 
we don’t know yet how much longer 
these earthquakes are going to con-
tinue to happen. The U.S. Geological 
Survey is saying that it may be a year, 
or it may be months. 
Every time this happens, the infra-
structure weakens. Again, it began 
with just six towns. Now, we have 29 
towns in the disaster declaration. 
This is an ongoing emergency. I wish 
nobody would suffer what we are suf-
fering today without having a complete 
recovery from the hurricanes. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. SERRANO), the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Commerce, Jus-
tice, and Science. 
Mr. 
SERRANO. 
Madam 
Chair, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of this emer-
gency supplemental, which will help 
Puerto Rico recover from damage 
caused by the ongoing earthquakes 
that have struck the island. It will help 
an island that is still struggling to re-
cover in the wake of Hurricanes Maria 
and Irma. 
Since December 28, Puerto Rico has 
experienced thousands of earthquakes,

including 
numerous 
powerful 
ones. 
These earthquakes have caused signifi-
cant damage to the island’s roads and 
schools and left many individuals’ 
homes 
structurally 
unsound. 
Many 
residents are fearful and uncertain of 
what comes next. 
Thousands of Puerto Ricans are in 
need of assistance to repair the damage 
to their homes and lives. Many have 
once again left the island for New 
York, Florida, and elsewhere, and need 
help there, also. 
This bill provides the island with the 
support necessary to help repair dam-
aged infrastructure, allow students to 
continue learning, and assist in its eco-
nomic recovery. It provides nutrition 
assistance to the most vulnerable 
members of Puerto Rican society. 
This bill also puts in safeguards to 
ensure that the administration spends 
the money as instructed by Congress so 
the island’s recovery is not hindered by 
a further man-made disaster. 
We all know what happened to our 
fellow citizens of Puerto Rico in the 
aftermath of Hurricane Maria and how 
our government’s inadequate response 
hurt the response and recovery efforts. 
I am thankful that my colleagues here 
in the House are determined not to let 
that happen again. 
I hope our Republican colleagues in 
the Senate will act quickly to help 
Puerto Rico, and I urge strong support 
for this bill in the House. 
I usually do not comment on any 
comment made by another Member. 
The person who made these comments 
is a person I have the utmost respect 
and admiration for, but our ranking 
member to the committee said that the 
bill is premature. How can it be pre-
mature to try to help American citi-
zens still recovering from two hurri-
canes? How can it be premature to help 
American citizens? It is never pre-
mature. The time is right. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the chair-
woman of the Subcommittee on Labor, 
Health and Human Services, Edu-
cation, and Related Agencies. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise 
to speak in support of the supple-
mental bill for Puerto Rico. 
The island has been rocked by earth-
quakes and tremors. Thousands of 
Americans are left without water or 
power, facing catastrophic property 
damage. 
In my district, I met with affected 
families and community members. We 
discussed the ongoing disaster and the 
response and recovery needs. 
I have staff, people who have family 
in Puerto Rico who are sleeping out-
doors for fear of going back into a 
home that is badly damaged. 
There should be no question about 
providing the resources necessary to 
recover. This supplemental package 
provides $4.67 billion for educational 
needs, 
transportation 
infrastructure 
repairs, and disaster relief activities, 
including $100 million for education. 
For K–12 programs, it helps schools 
restart operations, support reenroll-
ment, and pay for the costs of pro-
viding education to students who have 
been displaced by natural disasters, 
and yes, it addresses the mental health 
needs of children as they have experi-
enced a traumatic event. Higher edu-
cation, the funding helps defray the un-
expected costs associated with enroll-
ing displaced students and with re-
building damaged facilities. 
This supplemental also extends the 
child tax credit to all children in Puer-
to Rico and the U.S. territories. Under 
the current system, Puerto Rican fami-
lies are only eligible for the child tax 
credit for the third or subsequent child. 
What we need to do is to expand and 
improve the child tax credit, make it 
fully refundable, but this is a necessary 
step in the meantime so that U.S. citi-
zens in the territories are treated ex-
actly like those in the States. 
Let me just also assure my col-
leagues on a final note, that we are 
working with the administration to de-
termine the costs of our ongoing re-
sponse to the 2019 novel coronavirus. 
We have urged the administration to 
work with the Congress on a bipartisan 
basis to enact an emergency supple-
mental for that public health emer-
gency. We stand ready to move forward 
quickly to protect public health and 
safety. 
On this supplemental for Puerto 
Rico, let me urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes,’’ vote ‘‘yes’’ for Americans who 
are in dire straits on that island, and it 
is unconscionable that we would have 
second thoughts about the kind of sup-
port that they need during this crisis. 
Urge the Senate, urge the President to 
add their support swiftly. Our fellow 
Americans and Puerto Rico cannot af-
ford for us to delay any longer. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the chairman of 
the Subcommittee on Transportation, 
Housing and Urban Development, and 
Related Agencies. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I thank my colleague for yield-
ing, and I am pleased to rise in strong 
support of this supplemental appropria-
tion. 
This bill provides $4.7 billion for dis-
aster assistance, including $3.3 billion 
for HUD’s Community Development 
Block Grant program and $1.25 billion 
for emergency highway repairs. This 
funding will provide substantial help to 
the people of Puerto Rico, where dev-
astating earthquakes have compounded 
earlier damage from Hurricanes Maria 
and Irma, as well as other States and 
territories still recovering from major 
disasters. 
I would remind colleagues that CDBG 
money from earlier disasters cannot be 
used for earthquake relief. We need 
this bill. 
The bill also provides targeted re-
sources for Puerto Rico’s school sys-
tem, as well as nutrition assistance 
and tax relief for low-income families 
and small businesses. 
When it comes to disaster relief, we 
should be putting politics aside. There 
should be widespread consensus that 
the Federal Government should be 
there as an active partner in the recov-
ery effort. 
Unfortunately, for far too long, the 
Trump administration has erected ar-
bitrary barriers that have hindered 
Puerto Rico’s recovery. They have con-
tributed to desperate conditions to 
many places on the island. 
For example, HUD refused to provide 
more than $16 billion in already appro-
priated recovery funds for nearly 700 
days. HUD officials admitted during a 
hearing before our subcommittee that 
they willingly ignored a statutory 
deadline requiring them to move for-
ward. 
Now, HUD is imposing special grant 
conditions and other requirements on 
Puerto Rico, which will slow down the 
recovery effort even further. 
While the island has clearly been sin-
gled out for disparate treatment, nu-
merous States from Florida to Texas to 
my home State of North Carolina have 
also waited longer than they should for 
HUD to publish Federal Register no-
tices governing the use of disaster re-
covery funds. 
This bill responds to the unaccept-
able administrative delays by includ-
ing new accountability measures, new 
deadlines—actually, not so new dead-
lines; they were included in legislation 
already passed by this body—deadlines 
requiring HUD to publish notices, re-
view and approve action plans, and sign 
grant agreements within a fixed time-
frame. Those provisions were included 
in the bipartisan Reforming Disaster 
Recovery Act, which passed the House 
back in November, but unfortunately, 
like so much else, it is still languishing 
in the Senate. 
Madam Chairman, enough is enough. 
We must provide the vital assistance to 
Puerto Rico and other communities 
that are struggling to recover, and we 
need to send a signal to the adminis-
tration that Congress, not the White 
House, holds the power of the purse. 
I urge all my colleagues to support 
this emergency disaster supplemental. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts (Mr. NEAL), the distinguished 
chairman who came to Congress at the 
same time I did and is now chair of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. 
(Mr. NEAL asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NEAL. Madam Chair, I thank 
Chairwoman LOWEY for yielding me the 
time. 
I am happy to stand in support of 
this legislation today. This is a dis-
aster relief package that I worked on

In 
addition 
to 
providing 
supple-
mental appropriations to respond to 
the recent natural disasters that af-
fected Puerto Rico and other U.S. ter-
ritories, H.R. 5687 includes the Puerto 
Rico Disaster Tax Relief Act. These 
provisions will help Puerto Rico re-
build its homes and communities and 
provide much-needed relief to workers 
and families after these devastating 
earthquakes. 
Specifically, H.R. 5687 provides addi-
tional allocations of the low-income 
housing tax credit, which will allow 
critical investments in new affordable 
housing throughout the island. It also 
makes additional allocations to the 
new markets tax credit in Puerto Rico, 
allowing the island to make important 
investments, like rebuilding commu-
nity centers and hospitals in low-in-
come neighborhoods. 
This legislation helps Puerto Rico 
and other territories implement the 
earned income tax credit and the child 
tax credit, two of the most powerful 
tools we have to combat poverty. 
Last year, the Committee on Ways 
and Means reported out similar provi-
sions in our consideration of H.R. 3300, 
the Economic Mobility Act. 
b 0945 
Today, many Puerto Rican residents 
can be taxed into poverty from the U.S. 
payroll taxes that they pay. With our 
changes to the tax credit, we are cre-
ating long-awaited parity between the 
residents of Puerto Rico and the resi-
dents of the 50 other States. 
Additionally, the earned income tax 
credit is one of the most important 
work incentives we have in our code. 
This bill certainly rewards work. 
And, Madam Chair, I want to ac-
knowledge BILL PASCRELL from New 
Jersey, who did much of the good work 
in helping get to those success stories. 
We encourage work, we reduce poverty. 
This is a win-win for the island. 
As Puerto Rico and other territories 
try to recover from natural disasters, 
it is appropriate that we are taking ac-
tion to ensure that these territories 
have access to these critical tools for 
community development and poverty 
reduction. 
It is impossible to deny the suffering 
on the ground today on the island of 
Puerto Rico. It is my hope that Con-
gress will come together, as it has in 
the past, to help all members of the 
American family. 
We also urge full support on the 
other side. We took into consideration 
what they had to say at the com-
mittee. 
Madam Chair, I want to thank Chair-
woman LOWEY for moving this legisla-
tion swiftly to the floor today. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. PASCRELL), a distinguished 
member of the Committee on Ways and 
Means. 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Chair, I 
thank Chairwoman LOWEY and Rank-
ing Member GRANGER. 
I support this supplemental. It is 
very necessary. The destruction in 
Puerto Rico from Hurricane Maria and 
the terrible earthquake last month, 
with its ongoing aftershocks, make 
this relief more necessary than ever. 
I am thankful that legislation I pro-
posed, H.R. 3307, to provide a Federal 
supplement to the earned income tax 
credit in Puerto Rico and the other 
U.S. territories, was included in the 
bill. 
Unlike Americans in every other 
State, working Puerto Rican taxpayers 
are excluded from the Federal EITC to 
supplement their incomes. This is a 
deeply unfair restriction. It has tied 
the commonwealth’s hands at the 
worst possible time as islanders are re-
covering from disaster and facing high 
unemployment and dreadful levels of 
poverty. 
The EITC has repeatedly proven a 
critical tool to alleviating poverty, im-
proving health outcomes, and encour-
aging 
labor 
participation. 
Why 
shouldn’t our fellow Americans in 
Puerto Rico—and they are our fellow 
Americans—be able to earn the same 
benefit? 
With this Federal support, we can 
provide a very powerful tool for Puerto 
Ricans to get back on their feet and 
get a leg up. They deserve that help. 
Madam Chair, I ask that we support 
this legislation. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ), the distin-
guished chairwoman of the Committee 
on Small Business, who has been an el-
oquent, persistent speaker in favor of 
this aid because she understands that 
her homeland, where family still re-
sides, needs this money now, and we 
have an obligation to provide it now. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Chair, I 
thank Chairwoman LOWEY and all the 
members of the Appropriations Com-
mittee for working diligently to bring 
this bill to the floor and for recog-
nizing our moral and legal obligation 
of this Congress. 
Puerto Rico, an island invaded by the 
United States Armed Forces, a col-
ony—it is our responsibility to take 
care of our fellow American citizens. 
Don’t come here and say that we 
have been there for Puerto Rico. 
Yes, we passed a disaster relief pack-
age. And this administration has done 
everything within their power to with-
hold the money flowing to Puerto Rico. 
Don’t come here and say that you 
have been there for Puerto Rico. Don’t 
tell that to the parents of a 13-year-old 
girl who died in Vieques because they 
lack a functional hospital while FEMA 
has been withholding their money. 
Just this past Tuesday, Puerto Rico 
got hit by another 5.0 aftershock. This 
is one out of more than 3,000 that have 
stricken the island since December 
2019. In fact, the USGS has estimated 
that aftershocks from the 6.4 January 
earthquake will persist in Puerto Rico 
for years, if not decades. 
Imagine, 
decades 
of 
feeling 
the 
ground under you shaking, never know-
ing when or just how bad it will be on 
any given day. 
More than 1,150 houses are destroyed, 
while another 3,000 homes have suffered 
some structural damage. Such devasta-
tion has left over 4,000 people living in 
tent shelters, with many more families 
at risk of losing their homes. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gentle-
woman has expired. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 
an addition 1 minute to the gentle-
woman. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Chair, I 
thank the chairwoman for yielding. 
Not only are 194,000 children still out 
of school, countless more live in fear 
after they have seen their homes de-
stroyed and loved ones battle the anx-
iety and mental health battles common 
after natural disasters. 
Finally, let me address this adminis-
tration’s recent comments on this bill. 
Once again, they are misleading the 
American people about how much 
money has been spent to aid Puerto 
Rico. They are using these false num-
bers as a pretext to oppose assistance 
following the earthquake. 
Let me just say, and let me be clear, 
we will not be deterred. The 1.3 million 
Puerto Ricans who live in Florida will 
not be deterred. The thousands and 
hundreds of thousands who live in 
Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New 
York, and in every part of this country 
will not be deterred. 
We will pass this bill. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. GRIJALVA), the chairman of 
the Committee on Natural Resources. 
Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, let 
me thank Chair LOWEY and the Speak-
er for responding with urgency in 
bringing this legislation that I support, 
H.R. 5687, to the floor to help the fami-
lies of Puerto Rico who are enduring, 
once again, another natural disaster. 
Beginning on December 28, seismic 
activity began in Puerto Rico and con-
tinued to escalate, including a 6.4 
earthquake. These quakes and ongoing 
quakes have destroyed homes, infra-
structure, affected power generation, 
and triggered blackouts across the is-
land. 
Close to 7,500 people have left their 
homes out of fear that they may col-
lapse, seeking shelter wherever they 
can find it. 
Staff from the Natural Resources 
Committee investigated the damage 
caused by the earthquakes on the 
southern coast of Puerto Rico. In a 
committee report, we recommended 
high-priority actions, including emer-
gency funding, which H.R. 5687 rep-
resents.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H945 
February 7, 2020 
The administration’s recent state-
ment opposing H.R. 5687 shows total 
disdain for the people of Puerto Rico. 
President Trump continues to lie to 
the American people about the amount 
of Federal funding spent to address 
natural disasters on the island. 
The President and his administration 
have a responsibility to ensure the peo-
ple of Puerto Rico are treated as full 
Americans and not colonized subjects. I 
hope that, at the National Prayer 
Breakfast, there was some echo of un-
derstanding regarding the teachings of 
the Good Samaritan, the compassion 
that we must have for other people, 
and that those will motivate the House 
today to pass this bill and move it for-
ward. The disaster recovery funds that 
have been appropriated for Puerto Rico 
need to be disbursed. 
The people of Puerto Rico deserve 
much more. Our fellow Americans on 
the island deserve to be treated as we 
have 
treated 
all 
Americans, 
from 
Katrina to Sandy, with the same con-
cern, the same support. 
Madam Chair, I urge passage of the 
legislation. 
The CHAIR. Members are reminded 
to refrain from engaging in personal-
ities toward the President. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
as much time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from South Carolina 
(Mr. RICE), a member of the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I am not here to cast aspersions 
on disaster relief. I live in a coastal 
area in South Carolina that has been 
hit by three storms in the last 5 years: 
Joaquin, then Matthew, then Florence. 
I was a tax lawyer before I got here. 
I didn’t know that much about disaster 
relief, and, unfortunately, I have had 
to learn way more than I ever wanted 
to. But one thing that concerns me, 
and concerns me greatly, is the hap-
hazard way in which disaster relief is 
granted. 
And just to understand the order of 
magnitude that we are talking about 
here in relief for Puerto Rico, the re-
quest of the Governor in Puerto Rico 
amounts to, just for the two hurri-
canes—I don’t even know what it is for 
the earthquake; I don’t know if they 
have made an official request yet—but 
for the two hurricanes, Maria and the 
other one, amounts to $94 billion. They 
have been awarded $39 billion, allo-
cated or announced, and they have re-
ceived, obligated, $20 billion. 
Now, there were 476,000 applicants ap-
proved by FEMA in Puerto Rico. So, if 
you look at the amount that the Gov-
ernor 
requested, 
$94 
billion, 
that 
amounts to $200,000 per FEMA appli-
cant, $200,000, roughly. The amount 
that has been allocated or announced, 
$40 billion, divided out, it is just under 
$100,000 per FEMA applicant. And then 
the amount that has actually been paid 
works out to—and I have got that 
exact number here—$41,816 per FEMA 
applicant for these two storms. 
And there is, remaining, a tremen-
dous amount of money that has al-
ready been allocated that hasn’t been 
paid out yet. And there was disaster 
money that was made available in the 
appropriations bill in December for 
storms that occurred last year plus any 
storms that occurred within 60 days 
thereafter, and so these earthquakes 
are also allowed to access that money. 
So I don’t know that we really need 
to be rushing in to allocate another $5 
billion in aid when there is so much 
money that is already available to be 
used for this disaster. I hesitate to do 
this, but I want to point this out just 
to show you the order of magnitude. 
After Hurricane Florence, the Gov-
ernor of South Carolina requested $1 
billion. Puerto Rico has requested $94 
billion. 
The most affected counties in my dis-
trict were Marion, Dillon, Marlboro, 
and Chesterfield. Marion, Dillon, and 
Marlboro are three of the poorest coun-
ties in the State. Marion County is 57 
percent 
African 
American; 
Dillon 
County is 51 percent African American; 
and Marlboro County is 51 percent Afri-
can American. The average number of 
people in poverty is 30 percent. The av-
erage household income is around 
$30,000—just so you know the quality of 
life of these folks. 
There were 14,000 houses flooded, 
water inside the house. Five thousand 
of those, for some reason, were ap-
proved by FEMA. Even though they ex-
cluded two-thirds of the people who 
were damaged in this storm, we were 
still only awarded $14,000 per FEMA ap-
plicant. 
Puerto Rico, right now, stands at 
$41,816 per FEMA applicant before this 
$5 billion that they are talking about 
adding in here—and keeping in mind 
that we already did an appropriations 
bill in December for disaster allocation 
for last year that this earthquake is al-
ready allowed to access. 
b 1000 
So that is what I wanted to say about 
the disaster, the total amounts that 
are asked to be allocated here. But I 
want to talk also a little bit about 
these tax benefits. 
In addition to the $4.7 billion in addi-
tional money that is being asked to be 
allocated here, over the $40 billion that 
has already been allocated, there are 
several tax provisions in this bill that 
have never been considered by the 
Ways and Means Committee. Tax bills 
should arise in the Ways and Means 
Committee. Tax bills should be debated 
thoroughly. 
I have heard over and over again, you 
shouldn’t legislate an appropriations 
bill. This appropriations bill, this dis-
aster bill, contains a number of very 
significant changes to the Tax Code. 
Now, some of these were a part of a 
bigger bill that was marked up with no 
debate and with no hearings 6 months 
ago or a year ago, but they have never 
been debated. There has never been a 
hearing on any of this in the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
The two biggest things are, we are 
extending here to residents of Puerto 
Rico, the child tax credit as it exists 
under the United States Tax Code and 
the earned income tax credit. Now, 
people don’t know what that means. 
But, basically, that amounts to about 
$4,400 per family. And that is not a one- 
time thing like this disaster allocation 
is. That is forever. It goes on forever. 
The really interesting thing about 
extending this credit to residents of 
Puerto Rico, is that residents of Puerto 
Rico don’t pay U.S. income tax. They 
don’t file U.S. income tax returns un-
less they work for the U.S. Govern-
ment, or unless their income comes 
from outside Puerto Rico, which is a 
small number of people. They don’t pay 
U.S. income tax. 
So what we are talking about doing 
here is the U.S. Treasury will pay the 
child tax credit and the earned income 
tax credit to residents of Puerto Rico, 
credits against tax they don’t owe and 
will never owe because they simply 
don’t pay income tax. 
What this is, is a basically $400 a 
month entitlement forever to the resi-
dents of Puerto Rico and it makes no 
sense. It is not related to the disaster 
in any way. It is simply a pork barrel 
earmark is what it is that lasts forever 
going to Puerto Rico. Those are the big 
things: the earned income tax credit 
and the child tax credit. But let me go 
further. 
In addition, this bill would provide 
New Markets Tax Credits of $500 mil-
lion to Puerto Rico. Now, the New Mar-
kets Tax Credit is a wonderful thing. 
Again, it is something under the 
United States Tax Code. Puerto Ricans 
don’t pay taxes under the United 
States Tax Code, but this would extend 
that credit. I guess, if people invest in 
Puerto Rico, they would get a credit on 
their U.S. tax return, $500 million. 
Just to put that in perspective, it is 
designed to get people to invest in run-
down areas, in needy areas, and it is a 
good thing. But last year, the total 
amount for the whole country that we 
allocated, that we made available for 
the whole country, was $3.5 billion. 
This would give $500 million of that to 
Puerto Rico which would amount to 
one-seventh of what was granted to the 
entire country last year. $500 million. 
I just want to step back and just look 
at and consider carefully these tax pro-
visions, in particular, before we move 
forward with them. In my opinion, 
again, they are not related to the dis-
aster in any way. They are simply a 
method of creating a new entitlement 
in Puerto Rico, credits against U.S. tax 
for people who pay no U.S. tax. 
But if we are going to do this, cer-
tainly, it should be debated fully on 
this floor, and, certainly, before it ever 
gets to this floor, it should be debated 
fully in every committee—particularly, 
the Ways and Means Committee— 
which has any possible jurisdiction. 
So let me go back and end where I 
started. And that is, that I am not here 
to cast aspersions on disaster relief. 
My poor rural counties in South Caro-
lina have been terribly affected, have

February 7, 2020 
requested disaster relief, and have re-
ceived disaster relief. Now they have 
received far less than we are talking 
about here in Puerto Rico. 
Probably, if you looked at all of this, 
maybe a sixth of what my poor fami-
lies, my poor African American fami-
lies, who had nothing to begin with— 
right in Marion County and Dillon 
County and Marlboro County—are re-
ceiving about a third of what the peo-
ple in Puerto Rico are going to receive 
with this disaster bill. 
We really need to consider the order 
of magnitude, number one, and when I 
say these numbers, I am not even 
counting these tax credits. These tax 
credits need to be pulled out of this bill 
and they need to be fully debated. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. I 
would like to remind the gentleman 
from South Carolina, who is on his way 
out, that this bill has $25.7 million for 
South Carolina to deal with the de-
struction and the needs. 
I would also urge the gentleman, be-
cause he did give a thoughtful analysis, 
to perhaps visit Puerto Rico as many 
of us have. See the tarps on the homes, 
people without roofs, kids that are not 
in school, homes that don’t have water, 
and don’t have heat. 
I would be happy to work with the 
gentleman to analyze, visit Puerto 
Rico, see the needs, and I am happy to 
come to South Carolina if there are 
unmet needs that have not been pro-
vided for. We are happy to work to-
gether. But again, in this bill, there is 
$25.7 million for South Carolina. 
Madam Chairwoman, I am pleased to 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from 
the 
Virgin 
Islands 
(Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I 
thank the gentlewoman for the time. 
I was actually going to discuss some 
of the issues and specifics that were in 
the bill, this incredible bill that is so 
helpful, but I think the last comments 
caused me to have to take pause. 
First of all, I don’t know why we 
have to single out African Americans 
in South Carolina, as if they are in 
more need than anybody else for fund-
ing or for underfunding when they are 
more affected by disasters. But the rea-
son that these things are happening in 
the territories is because of the under-
funding of this body to the territories 
in ways that do not happen in States 
throughout this country. 
There is no cap on Medicaid in South 
Carolina. There is no arbitrary amount 
of percentage that the Federal Govern-
ment is paying as opposed to a local 
government is paying in South Caro-
lina like there is in Puerto Rico and 
the Virgin Islands where Congress arbi-
trarily said: We will only pay 55 per-
cent. You pay 45 percent, based on a 
number that has nothing to do with 
your population or its demographics. 
There is no cap on highways and us 
being removed from Federal formulas 
that the rest of the States have. So 
when we have a disaster, yes, we need 
more money because we have under-
funding and our infrastructure is a lot 
more fragile than the rest of this coun-
try because this body hasn’t done its 
job. 
The gentleman talks about taxes. 
Why doesn’t the Virgin Islands pay 
taxes in the same way? Because almost 
100 years ago, when we asked this gov-
ernment to be treated in the same way 
as the others, this government said: 
You know what, we will let you keep 
your Federal taxes and then we won’t 
have to give you the same amounts of 
money that we give the rest of the 
States, when, in fact, at that time, 
maybe 100 people met the criteria of in-
come to pay Federal taxes. 
So it is a sham and it is an okeydoke 
what this country did to the rest of us. 
And then everyone wants to hold us to 
the same standards and make sure that 
we are not supposed to get money the 
same way. It is just ridiculous. 
I think this is an incredible bill. I 
think it is long overdue. This does not 
even put us on the same footing as the 
States in terms of what should happen, 
and I urge all of my colleagues to sup-
port it. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Chair, I want to thank the gentle-
woman from Texas for yielding me the 
time. 
Madam Chair, we are in a situation 
where we absolutely have needs in 
terms of disaster victims, whether it is 
Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Texas, 
South Carolina, North Carolina, Lou-
isiana, and other States that have been 
impacted by disasters. 
We have had hundreds of billions of 
dollars in damages in those States in 
just the last 4 years. It is extraor-
dinary. I had the chance to travel to 
many of those States and territories to 
see firsthand the impacts, and I wanted 
to be very clear. Virtually what every-
one said on both sides of the aisle, they 
are right in terms of what the disaster 
victims are going through. 
But I do not agree in what folks are 
prescribing the strategy to be. We 
don’t need to stand here and see who 
can out-Puerto Rico the other. It is not 
a money problem. I have been through 
this with millions and millions of peo-
ple. We have policy problems. There 
are literally tens of billions of dollars 
in the bank today that we are unable 
to get to disaster victims. 
Dumping more money on top of the 
existing more than $40 billion in the 
Disaster Relief Fund, and the billions 
and billions of dollars available today 
for Puerto Rico under the Community 
Development Block Grant Disaster Re-
covery Program, that doesn’t solve the 
problem. 
There is an amendment coming up 
later today by our Members from Texas 
to put more money into a fund because 
some of the agencies have had trouble 
even getting law changes interpreted 
out. 
This isn’t the solution. I want to 
thank everybody for coming here and 
trying to solve the problem for disaster 
victims. But when you investigate this, 
I assure you, every single one of you 
will come back and understand that 
this is a capacity problem. Getting the 
bureaucracy in both the territories, the 
States, and also at the Federal level, 
getting the dollars to the disaster vic-
tims, that is why we are having prob-
lems today. 
I want to say this again. There are 
tens of billions of dollars available. 
President Trump approved individual 
and public assistance for disaster vic-
tims of the earthquakes in Puerto 
Rico. We have got to make sure that 
the money is actually getting to the 
right people. 
Dumping additional money on top of 
the tens of billions of dollars doesn’t 
solve the problem. We need to focus on 
real solutions and not stand here and 
practice politics with one another. 
I urge rejection to this bill. Let’s 
take a step back and fix the policy 
problems. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN 
B. MALONEY), chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Chair, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 5687. When Hurricane 
Maria hit Puerto Rico, its entire elec-
trical grid was destroyed and millions 
of its citizens were without power. It 
took years to rebuild a lot of that in-
frastructure and just when it was get-
ting repaired, it was struck by another 
natural disaster, another huge earth-
quake on January 7. That led to yet an-
other round of power outages and even 
more suffering and deaths in Puerto 
Rico. 
This bill will provide desperately 
needed disaster relief that will allow 
the island to rebuild its infrastructure 
and revitalize its economy. Puerto 
Rico is home to 3.2 million U.S. citi-
zens, and when disaster strikes, Con-
gress has a duty to step up and provide 
all the support our fellow Americans 
need. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Chairwomen 
VELA´ ZQUEZ and Lowey for their pas-
sionate work on this bill and their help 
for Puerto Rico. I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on 
this bill. It is desperately needed. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
2 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chairwoman, I thank the 
ranking member for yielding again. 
I think we have not understood the 
magnitude of this event. Yes, we do 
have $40 billion in approved funds for 
Puerto Rico, but of that, just $1.5 bil-
lion has been disbursed to the island. 
The rest of the funds go through a dif-
ferent process. 
Actually, in February of last year, 
there was the publication of the guide-
lines to access $8.7 billion. Of that, just 
1.7 got a grant agreement in January of

this year. So, again, in order to get the 
funds, it will be several months before 
we have it. 
b 1015 
That is the reason one of the con-
cerns is that FEMA is getting the 
emergency disaster individual assist-
ance as we speak, the same thing as 
the other Federal agencies that are 
doing the job on the ground. 
But at the same time, we did have a 
power plant on the island that is com-
pletely shut down, so we lost the power 
for a few days. Right now, we don’t 
have 500 megawatts reserved. Actually, 
if we do have another earthquake or 
any other replicas, we may run out, 
again, of power because our power 
plants were affected as well. 
I do believe that roads and pipelines 
were affected. Government buildings 
were affected as well. We haven’t seen 
yet the amount of destruction. 
Again, you will see a lot of Puerto 
Ricans leaving the island. It is hap-
pening already. It happened with Hur-
ricane Maria. They flew to Florida. We 
are depleting, basically, our island be-
cause of these kinds of things. 
Yes, we do need the money. We do 
need to help our people in this stress. 
The tax provisions are good in this bill. 
Let me say, they are not an invention 
from me. This House and Senate did a 
report in 2016 recommending the child 
tax credit, the earned income tax cred-
it, and many other amendments that 
treat Puerto Rico and the territories 
differently. That is the reason we don’t 
have enough resources to face a lot of 
these challenges. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from New York (Ms. OCASIO- 
CORTEZ). 
Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ. Madam Chair, 
I thank the chairwoman for the gen-
erous introduction and time on this 
bill. 
Madam Chair, the fact of the matter 
is that innocent children, families, and 
the elderly in Puerto Rico are dying. 
They are breathing poisoned air, and 
they are now enduring the psycho-
logical trauma of ongoing earthquakes. 
My own grandmother is oxygen de-
pendent, and every day when the Earth 
shakes below her, we don’t know if she 
will have the power to continue her 
equipment that is medically necessary. 
While everyone here is arguing over 
money and over the administration of 
a colonial state, we have to take a look 
at the actual reality on the ground. 
Ninety-five percent of schools in Puer-
to Rico are not up to code. They are 
leaving thousands of Puerto Rican chil-
dren vulnerable to the effects of nat-
ural disasters. Many have lost all their 
belongings, and many more live with 
psychological trauma. 
But this administration is not releas-
ing any of these funds that are sup-
posed to be duly allocated for recovery. 
For that, we have to make sure that we 
support this bill, and I strongly support 
H.R. 5687. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from the Northern Mariana Islands 
(Mr. SABLAN). 
Mr. SABLAN. Madam Chair, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding. 
Madam Chair, I cannot imagine. I 
come from a district where we are the 
typhoon alley. A little over a year ago, 
the second largest storm since 1935 
that hit the United States hit my is-
land, and that was subsequent to an-
other typhoon that hit my island just a 
year before that. 
But for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Vir-
gin Islands, for Puerto Rico in par-
ticular, two major storms hit the is-
lands, and before the people even had a 
chance to truly get their lives back in 
order, earthquakes. Those homes that 
were not destroyed by the storms are 
now destroyed by the earthquakes. 
Madam Chair, in a previous adminis-
tration, I was a Special Assistant for 
Management and Budget, and we did an 
analysis of what it would be like to 
apply the U.S. Internal Revenue Code 
fully to the Marianas. We would lose 
more money if we change Federal taxes 
than if we don’t. So I support the bill, 
and I ask for its passage. 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself the balance of my time to close. 
Madam Chair, this emergency supple-
mental is critical to help Puerto Rico 
get back on its feet and build a better 
future. 
In a demonstration of unprecedented 
hostility to Puerto Ricans, President 
Trump has turned his back on the is-
land. This Congress must not do the 
same. 
With this legislation, Madam Chair, 
we can feed the hungry, repair damage, 
rebuild roads, restart schools, and keep 
the lights on. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to vote for this critical assistance. It is 
absolutely essential. I do wish more of 
my colleagues had visited the island, 
seen the tarps on the homes instead of 
roofs, tried to get back through those 
roads that are so slushy, walking 
through, driving through, and talking 
to the people. It is essential that we 
pass this critical assistance. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The CHAIR. All time for general de-
bate has expired. 
Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be 
considered for amendment under the 
5-minute rule and shall be considered 
as read. 
The text of the bill is as follows:

quent payments.

and 
(2) for purposes of paragraph (4)(C) of sec-
tion 3 of the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act 
of 2010 as being included in an appropriation 
Act. 
The CHAIR. No amendment to the 
bill is in order except those printed in 
part C of House Report 116–392. Each 
such amendment may be offered only 
in the order printed in the report, by a 
Member designated in the report, shall 
be considered read, shall be debatable 
for the time specified in the report, 
equally divided and controlled by the 
proponent and an opponent, shall not

the question. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS. SHALALA 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 1 printed in part 
C of House Report 116–392. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Chair, I have 
an amendment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 3, line 25, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $1,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 833, the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. SHALALA) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Florida. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Chair, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, our fellow Americans 
in Puerto Rico have suffered greatly in 
the last few years, from fiscal calamity 
to a monster hurricane to the Earth 
shaking and continuing to shake. 
I have seen the suffering personally. 
These disasters have resulted in many 
Puerto Ricans leaving the island, and 
many are children or young adults who 
are still in school. 
This amendment increases funding to 
conduct a study on the impacts that 
these young people face when they 
have to disrupt their education. 
The truth is, we don’t know the best 
way to help children who have to leave 
their homes to pursue their education 
in another State or have to miss weeks 
of school because their school building 
is structurally unsound after an earth-
quake. But we need to. We need to 
know the best way to make sure that 
all children can reach their full poten-
tial and are able to cope with whatever 
trauma they may have faced. 
Ultimately, 
this 
amendment 
will 
save us money because we will have fu-
ture natural disasters where children 
will have to move away from their 
schools or pause their education. Un-
fortunately, there will be more Marias 
and more Katrinas, and there will be 
more wildfires. 
We need to make sure that we are 
serving both children and the tax-
payers. We should spend our money in 
the most impactful way possible. The 
study will guide us on the most effec-
tive policies and the most effective 
way we can use disaster funds to help 
our children. 
I thank my distinguished colleague, 
Congresswoman GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, for 
her work and her support on this 
amendment, as well as Congresswoman 
STEPHANIE
MURPHY, 
Congressman 
ALCEE
HASTINGS, and Chairman JIM 
MCGOVERN. 
Madam Chair, I support the under-
lying bill. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, I claim the time in 
opposition, although I am going to be 
in favor of the amendment. 
The CHAIR. Without objection, the 
gentlewoman from Puerto Rico is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, first, I want to 
thank 
Congresswoman 
SHALALA. 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for visiting the 
island several weeks ago with Con-
gressman POSEY
and Congresswoman 
MURPHY. 
Madam Chair, let me tell you what 
this amendment is about. This will pro-
vide $1 million to conduct a study on 
the impacts of educational attainment, 
long-term economic opportunities, as 
well as the well-being of students from 
Puerto Rico who have had to disrupt or 
change their educational path due to a 
natural disaster. 
Although the full extent of the dam-
age is still being assessed, it is evident 
that the ongoing earthquakes impact-
ing Puerto Rico have been particularly 
harmful for our students and edu-
cational system. 
Following the collapse of this public 
school in Guanica—thank God it was 
4:24 in the morning, and there were no 
students and teachers in that school. It 
completely collapsed. The Department 
of Education delayed the start of the 
semester across the island in order to 
conduct structural inspections of all 
public schools. To this day, 69 schools 
have already been deemed unsafe and 
thus unable to reopen. Another 234 
have been classified as partially ade-
quate, which means that only some 
parts of the school’s buildings are safe. 
In fact, although inspections are on-
going, the Puerto Rico Department of 
Education is projecting that 25 percent 
of the island’s public schools will be 
unable to be reopen during this semes-
ter. 
In Guanica, this town, there are six 
schools. All of them are closed. As we 
speak, tents are being installed as out-
door classrooms to ensure students 
don’t lose their semester, specifically 
seniors going off to college. 
The disruptive nature of the event 
cannot be overstated. Puerto Rico will 
need to identify alternative and/or 
temporary sites to open schools and re-
locate misplaced students. Many will 
probably leave the island altogether, 
the way it happened with Maria. The 
provision of counseling and mental 
health services will be crucial to ad-
dress the fear and similar challenges 
among the impacted student popu-
lation and their families. 
Therefore, I support the $100 million 
included in the supplemental to help us 
meet the educational needs of those af-
fected by disasters. 
The study funded by this amendment 
will provide us with vital information 
to help address challenges faced by stu-
dents impacted by earthquakes, miti-
gate additional impacts on their edu-
cational attainment, and better pre-
pare them for future disasters. 
I want to conclude by thanking 
Ranking Member GRANGER for allowing 
me 
the 
time 
and 
Congresswoman 
SHALALA for her hard work in working 
together on behalf of the people of 
Puerto Rico. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Chair, I yield 
2 minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO). 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I rise 
in support of this amendment. It is $1 
million that provides funds for a study 
on the impacts of natural disasters on 
the well-being and educational paths of 
affected students and children in Puer-
to Rico. 
The children in Puerto Rico have 
been struggling from the trauma of 
multiple natural disasters. It has been 
resulting in unbelievable disruptions to 
their lives at home and at school. 
After Hurricane Maria, Congress-
woman GRACE MENG from New York 
and I went to Puerto Rico. We visited 
the schools, and the teachers told us 
that the children were not coming to 
school. Why? We asked the question: 
Why? 
They were scared that if they went to 
school and they returned home, they 
would not find their families, their 
home, or anything else that gave them 
their strength and the hope with their 
families, so they weren’t going. They 
also couldn’t go because the power was 
out, and the heat was too much for 
them to be there. 
What is it that you can’t understand? 
What is it that this administration 
doesn’t understand about what is hap-
pening to children, American children, 
in Puerto Rico? 
b 1030 
We included $3 million in the 2019 
Labor-HHS appropriations bill to pro-
vide behavorial health services and 
counseling to children in Puerto Rico. 
These 
services 
are 
being 
provided 
through the National Child Traumatic 
Stress Network, which is a national 
network of grantees that provide serv-
ices for children and adolescents ex-
posed to traumatic events. 
Schools are the center of our commu-
nities. 
They 
offer 
students 
stable 
schedules, warm meals, and support 
from teachers and school professionals. 
They are the center of learning. We 
need to act with urgency to support the 
school recovery and restore this sta-
bility for the children in Puerto Rico,

but we must take a careful look at the 
long-term impacts of these disasters on 
student well-being and educational ac-
cess and success. 
Madam Chair, this amendment pro-
vides those resources. I support it, and 
I urge my colleagues to do the same. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, may I inquire how 
much time is remaining. 
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from 
Puerto Rico has 2 minutes remaining. 
The gentlewoman from Florida has 1 
minute remaining. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, the school that I 
am showing you here is one from 
Guanica. Maybe many people here will 
not know that the schools in Puerto 
Rico are used for shelters during hurri-
canes, so this is having the place for 
shelters being destroyed and many of 
them not compliant right now and dur-
ing the assessment. 
Let me give you an example. When 
we had the first earthquake, 6.4, and 
then the replica, the government of 
Puerto Rico has to do an assessment of 
the infrastructure in all schools. But 
weeks later, we got more aftershocks 
of 5, 5.4, 4.9. So that assessment contin-
ued to happen, and it is an ongoing sit-
uation every week in order to have our 
kids and teachers safe. 
So right now, I told you already the 
number of schools that are deemed un-
safe to return to classes. But if we do 
have another replica of 5 or 4.9 during 
these next days, and we are having be-
tween 8 and 12 tremors a day, that may 
be that many more schools can be in-
cluded. 
Actually, originally, there were just 
six towns included in the mayor’s dec-
laration of disaster. Right now, it is 29, 
because the infrastructure gets weak-
ened with all the tremors, and that is 
the reason I do support this amend-
ment. 
The mental health issue for students, 
for parents, for kids is a real situation 
on the island. We don’t want to lose 
more kids. We don’t want kids to lose 
their semester. So I think this amend-
ment would provide that much-needed 
help. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Chair, this 
amendment is simply about helping 
American children, and I urge my col-
leagues to support it. 
Madam Chair, I yield to the gentle-
woman from New York (Mrs. LOWEY), 
the chair of Committee on Appropria-
tions. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I am 
pleased 
to 
support 
this 
excellent 
amendment. 
Ms. SHALALA. Madam Chair, I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. SHALALA). 
The question was taken; and the 
Chair announced that the ayes ap-
peared to have it. 
Mrs. LOWEY. Madam Chair, I de-
mand a recorded vote. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of 
rule XVIII, further proceedings on the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Florida will be postponed. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2 OFFERED BY MISS GONZA´ LEZ- 
COLO´ N OF PUERTO RICO 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 2 printed in part 
C of House Report 116–392. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, I have an amend-
ment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 27, line 7, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $170,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 833, the gentlewoman from Puer-
to Rico (Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Puerto Rico. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, I yield myself such 
time as I may consume. 
Madam Chair, today, I rise in support 
of this amendment. It is a bipartisan 
amendment to increase the amount of 
disaster nutrition assistance for Puerto 
Rico to $210 million. 
The island has been experiencing con-
stant seismic activity since December 
28 of last year, and thousands of Puerto 
Ricans have lost their homes and all 
their belongings. This challenges their 
safety and job security, as well as their 
ability to provide food for themselves 
and their family members. 
Puerto Rico does not participate in 
the national Supplemental Nutrition 
Assistance Program, or SNAP, as do 
our counterparts in the mainland; 
Washington, D.C.; Guam; and the Vir-
gin Islands. Instead, Puerto Rico has 
the Nutrition Assistance Program, or 
NAP, which receives significantly less 
funding. 
Excluding us from SNAP—and that is 
another issue that this House ad-
dressed and we are making a study in 
that sense. Excluding us from SNAP 
also excludes us from the disaster por-
tion of this program, known as D– 
SNAP. This means that every time 
there is a natural disaster like the one 
we are experiencing now, Congress 
needs to step up and appropriate Fed-
eral funding for disaster nutrition. 
We saw that after Hurricane Irma 
and Maria. And now, we are facing an-
other emergency, and that is the rea-
son Congress needs to approve funds for 
this food nutrition assistance. This 
amendment will help support bene-
ficiaries of the program and allow an 
increase in enrollment, ensuring that 
those impacted by disasters were sup-
ported in their effort to maintain food 
security. 
The earthquakes have caused wide-
spread infrastructure damage. Over 
15,000 residents have reported damage 
in their homes. Of those, more than 
1,000 are damaged to a point of being 
unlivable or destroyed. 
This is a wide infrastructure issue 
that has impacted private homes, pub-
lic buildings, and private businesses, 
including supermarkets, pharmacies, 
and stores in that region. 
Since the seismic activity is ongoing, 
we expect the infrastructure problems 
to worsen. Some structures have sur-
vived seismic movements thus far, but 
there is no telling us when or if they 
will be destroyed or affected by future 
aftershocks. 
People are living in fear; people are 
living in desperation—especially in the 
southwestern region of the island. At 
one point, over 7,000 people were living 
in shelters without a clear idea of when 
they will be able to return to their 
homes. 
I have experienced these tremors my-
self, and I can firmly state that fear 
during these times is more than justi-
fied. 
The unpredictability of earthquakes 
challenges any forecast capabilities. 
According to the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey, there is no telling when the earth-
quakes will stop. However, one thing 
we do know is that the island needs 
help, and we need it now. 
Madam Chair, this is why I am sup-
porting the underlying bill and why I 
am offering this amendment. There are 
close to 397,000 NAP beneficiaries in 
the affected municipalities, of which 
over 92,000 are children. These numbers 
may grow, contingent on more munici-
palities being affected and more resi-
dents joining the program. 
Madam Chair, food security is a crit-
ical part of any recovery effort. My 
amendment will ensure earthquake 
victims can count on disaster nutri-
tional funds to get them through this 
difficult time. 
I thank Congresswoman DELAURO, 
Congresswoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, Congress-
men SOTO and JOSE SERRANO for spon-
soring this important amendment for 
the people of Puerto Rico. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
to vote in favor. And, again, I cannot 
vote for the bill. I cannot have Mem-
bers in the House and in the Senate 
representing Puerto Rico, but I can, 
with all of you, vote for Puerto Rico in 
this amendment. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I ask 
unanimous consent to claim the time 
in opposition, although I am not op-
posed to the amendment. 
The CHAIR. Is there objection to the 
request of the gentlewoman from Con-
necticut? 
There was no objection. 
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Chair, I look 
forward to the day when my colleague, 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N
from 
Puerto 
Rico, can vote in this House of Rep-
resentatives. 
I also want to add one thing. 
A colleague from South Carolina said 
earlier that folks in Puerto Rico do not 
pay taxes. They pay payroll taxes. We

all understand payroll taxes; and, quite 
frankly, that is the basis on which the 
child tax credit is determined. So they 
are paying taxes. 
Madam Chair, I rise in support of this 
amendment. I am honored to colead it 
with 
my 
colleague 
JENNIFFER 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, with Congresswoman 
NYDIA
VELA´ ZQUEZ, and Congressmen 
SERRANO and SOTO. It increases funding 
for Puerto Rico’s Nutrition Assistance 
Program to $210 million. 
The $40 million in the underlying bill 
provides a strong foundation on which 
to build; and, in light of a new analysis 
from leading nutrition experts which 
has shown how great the need is, the 
amendment increases the resources to 
what the experts are now calling for. 
Thousands have been left without 
food, water, or power. We cannot turn 
our backs on the people of Puerto Rico. 
We need to meet basic needs so that 
they can rebuild. It is not only a re-
sponsibility, but it is a moral responsi-
bility. 
And why is this necessary? Because 
Puerto Rico receives a block grant for 
nutrition assistance. It is known as the 
Nutrition Assistance Program, or NAP. 
Because the value of the block grant is 
fixed, their nutrition assistance is un-
able to meet the heightened needs of 
children and families in times of dis-
aster. It is fundamentally different 
from how food stamps work for the 
millions of other Americans elsewhere 
in our country. 
But we know where this administra-
tion falls on the food stamp program. 
They are willing to deny 3 million peo-
ple access to food stamps, take 2 mil-
lion kids off of the School Lunch Pro-
gram. 
Folks here are in need, but the people 
in Puerto Rico, the children in Puerto 
Rico are in need. An island ravished by 
earthquakes and tremors—Wednesday 
saw a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. 
In her request to the Congress, Puer-
to Rico’s Governor warned: ‘‘Puerto 
Ricans are currently suffering eco-
nomic and job loss, displacement and 
interruption of essential services, and 
thousands of refugees currently located 
in camps are children and the elderly.’’ 
We offer a bipartisan amendment 
today to build on the underlying bill. I 
commend the committee chair, Con-
gresswoman 
LOWEY, 
and 
the 
sub-
committee chair, Congressman BISHOP, 
for their hard work on this fast-moving 
matter. 
To my colleagues: Have a sense of 
what food means to people. We live in 
a land of plenty. We should not be 
about the business of denying food and 
nutrition help to others, and especially 
American children and American fami-
lies from Puerto Rico, the nutrition as-
sistance, the food that they need in 
order to survive. 
Madam Chair, no one should go to 
bed hungry in this country or in those 
countries where we have American citi-
zens, and that is Puerto Rico. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues, 
please—please—deal 
with 
what 
our 
moral responsibility is in this body. We 
have the power to make this happen. 
Let’s make it happen today. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman 
from 
Puerto 
Rico

GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 3 OFFERED BY MS. PLASKETT 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 3 printed in part 
C of House Report 116–392. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I 
have an amendment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 3, line 5, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $3,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 833, the gentlewoman from the 
Virgin Islands (Ms. PLASKETT) and a 
Member opposed each will control 5 
minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I rise 
in support of my amendment. This 
amendment would increase the Depart-
ment of Energy technical assistance 
for electrical grid recovery in the U.S. 
territories by $3 million. 
High energy costs have bedeviled the 
U.S. insular territories for many years, 
harming consumers, limiting develop-
ment, and draining capital from our is-
lands’ economies. The average price of 
electricity paid by U.S. Virgin Islands 
residents in mid-2019 was about three 
times higher than the average power 
price in the mainland United States. 
These islands have suffered at least 
one tropical cyclone, typhoon, or hurri-
cane in the last 3 years, storms made 
stronger by warming oceans. 
As a result of unprecedented recent 
disasters and the impact of enormous 
physical damage, the Virgin Islands are 
currently going through an energy cri-
sis. Hurricanes Irma and Maria dam-
aged approximately 80 to 90 percent of 
the electrical transmission and dis-
tribution systems in the territory. 
Rolling blackouts persist to this day. 
b 1045 
Successfully incorporating resiliency 
measures into the electrical system re-
covery effort, including by building 
microgrid systems, and adding renew-
able generation capacity to the system 
does require significant technical as-
sistance from the Department of En-
ergy. 
I am pleased that the House, through 
this bill, will be taking action to make 
appropriations for technical assistance 
with rebuilding electric systems in the 
insular areas. However, given the cur-
rent state of the islands, including 
Puerto Rico, which has had the unique 
challenge of natural disasters reoccur-
ring over the past several months, I am 
concerned that the amount of $15 mil-
lion may not be enough to adequately 
address the urgent needs for assistance 
to improve grid resiliency and to lower 
the cost of electricity. 
That is why I requested this modest 
uptick of $3 million. It is to see that 
utilities in the smaller territories like 
my district can get the technical as-
sistance they need to solve energy 
problems that are unlike any other in 
the United States. 
Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), who is the majority 
leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentlewoman from the Virgin Is-
lands (Ms. PLASKETT) for yielding. I la-
ment that, as Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N 
pointed out, she will not be able to 
vote on the final passage of this bill. 
I lament that Puerto Rico is not a 
State. If it were a State or if the Virgin 
Islands were a State, they would have 
already been addressed and helped, con-
sistent with what we have done for 
States. 
Madam Chair, history will remember 
this generation of Puerto Ricans for 
their perseverance, their courage, and 
their strength. Having endured two 
devastating hurricanes in 2017, they 
have had to cope with their heart-
breaking aftermath, characterized by 
the Trump administration’s failure to 
allocate resources properly, fairly, ef-
fectively, and timely. 
Now a series of powerful earthquakes 
have struck the island, causing addi-
tional damage and, sadly, loss of life. 
We have heard reports that, while 
much of the power transmission infra-
structure that was rebuilt stronger 
after the hurricanes were able to hold 
up, the aging power plants they serve 
sustained substantial damage. 
Madam Chair, I will remind my col-
leagues that the people of Puerto Rico 
are our fellow American citizens. They 
are our brothers and our sisters, our 
fellow Americans. Their well-being is 
our concern. Their capacity to rebuild, 
and rebuild stronger, is our responsi-
bility as the representatives of the 
American people—of all the American 
people. That is what we do after nat-
ural disasters: We help our fellow 
Americans in need. 
Madam Chair, I and several of my 
colleagues will be traveling to Puerto 
Rico over the President’s Day district 
work period next weekend. We will be 
visiting communities in the south of 
the island that have been hardest hit 
by the earthquakes. Many of the same 
communities are still trying to rebuild 
from Irma and Maria. 
I was there in 2017, in Puerto Rico, 
and in the Virgin Islands with Rep-
resentative PLASKETT. I was there with 
the Republican leader, Mr. MCCARTHY. 
We visited with families who lost their 
homes, who lost loved ones, and who 
asked us to come back here to Wash-
ington and help. 
We worked together, Republicans and 
Democrats, to pass emergency funding 
and partnered on an effort to amend 
the Stafford Act to promote resilience

by ensuring that structures are built to 
21st century standards. 
Madam Chair, when I return to the 
island later this month, I want to tell 
the people I meet that Congress has 
not and will not forget them, that their 
brothers and sisters on the mainland 
are with them. I want to tell them that 
we took action to provide the addi-
tional funding the island needs to re-
cover from this most recent disaster. 
I want to tell them that the Congress 
came together to approve the nec-
essary funds to help communities on 
the island restore critical infrastruc-
ture and rebuild schools and housing. I 
want to tell them that we came 
through with assistance for repairing 
the energy grid and making it more re-
silient. 
I also want to be able to share with 
them that Congress made key tax re-
forms 
to 
give 
low-income 
Puerto 
Ricans some help with childcare and 
affordable housing as they rebuild, as 
we do for people here on the mainland. 
Madam Chair, that is why I am ask-
ing my colleagues to join me in passing 
this bill and making all of those things 
possible. When I go down to Puerto 
Rico in just over a week, I want to be 
able to tell the people there that this 
House did its job. 
Sadly, we have seen the administra-
tion’s veto threat, which was little 
more than a denigration of our fellow 
Americans, accusing Puerto Ricans of 
corruption and being untrustworthy of 
receiving emergency aid. Ironic that 
his administration would make such a 
charge. Shame on them for making 
that allegation, and shame on them 
even more if they veto disaster aid to 
Puerto Rico under such a spurious and 
hateful belief. 
House Democrats will continue to 
conduct oversight in order to ensure 
that the administration does not con-
tinue to withhold critical, congression-
ally appropriated disaster aid from the 
people of Puerto Rico who need it to 
rebuild. The stronger they are, the 
stronger our Nation will be. 
Madam Chair, I want to thank the 
chairwoman 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Committee, Mrs. LOWEY, as well as the 
chairman of the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, Mr. NEAL, along with members 
of their committees for their hard 
work on this package. 
Madam Chair, I want to thank Rep-
resentatives 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
SERRANO, 
SOTO, OCASIO-CORTEZ, and, yes, Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, as well, for advo-
cating for Puerto Ricans in Congress. 
Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues 
on both sides of the aisle to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this package. Keep faith with our 
fellow citizens wherever they might 
live, in the East, in the West, in the 
South, or in Puerto Rico, all Ameri-
cans worthy of having confidence that 
we will stand with them in hours of 
distress. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. I would like to claim the time in 
opposition, and although I am claiming 
the time in opposition, I am in favor of 
the 
amendment 
presented 
by 
Ms. 
PLASKETT. 
The CHAIR. Without objection, the 
gentlewoman from Puerto Rico is rec-
ognized for 5 minutes. 
There was no objection. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, I think it is impor-
tant to understand that living on an is-
land puts us in a different mode than 
the rest of the States where you can re-
ceive and manage electricity at the 
power plants differently. 
Our infrastructure is weakened by 
hurricanes, and by many years of hur-
ricanes in our case. So I do believe that 
this allocation of funds for technical 
assistance from the Department of En-
ergy will help us to get through this 
situation and allow the U.S. Virgin Is-
lands, and Puerto Rico as well, to fig-
ure out what is going to be the kind of 
energy we are going to be using. 
We approved $1.9 billion for technical 
assistance in CDBG funds for the elec-
trical grid on the island of Puerto Rico, 
but the guidelines have not been pub-
lished yet. So that means we don’t 
have 
access 
to 
those 
funds, 
even 
though the Department of Energy has 
been doing the assessments on the is-
lands of Puerto Rico and U.S. Virgin 
Islands. Because of that, I do support 
the amendment. 
Madam Chair, I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, I 
am greatly honored to support this 
piece of legislation, especially honored 
that Chairwoman LOWEY has put lan-
guage in there that will streamline the 
process that Mr. HOYER helped to de-
velop. 
I would just like to add this. I know 
what it is like to live in harm’s way. In 
Houston, Texas, we have billion-dollar 
floods that take lives, and these are 
supposed to be 100-year floods. Unfortu-
nately, they are happening all too 
often, and sometimes on a yearly basis. 
So I stand here today to say thank 
you to all involved, especially to Mrs. 
LOWEY
for what she has done to 
streamline this process. It will be help-
ful to persons in Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands, but, also, in the long 
run, it will be helpful to the people of 
Houston, Texas. 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto 
Rico. Madam Chair, I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Chair, I 
urge adoption of this amendment. This 
is important to the territories. 
As you heard from my colleague from 
Puerto Rico, islands are very fragile, 
and we do not have the scale that oth-
ers have, nor do we have grids that can 
be attached to other areas. So this is 
really important to us, and the tech-
nical assistance of this Nation, from 
the Department of Energy, would go a 
long way in supporting a more resilient 
grid. 
Madam Chair, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. 
PLASKETT). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4 OFFERED BY MR. CRENSHAW 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 4 printed in part 
C of House Report 116–392. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. I have an amend-
ment at the desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 20, line 7, after the dollar amount, in-
sert ‘‘(increased by $45,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 833, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CRENSHAW) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Texas. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Chair, I rise today to support 
the people from the great State of 
Texas. 
It has been 21⁄2 years since Hurricane 
Harvey. Many of my constituents are 
still struggling to finance their re-
building. And it is not as if Texans sim-
ply waited on Federal aid. We passed a 
local bond for $2.5 billion to address re-
covery and future prevention. Addi-
tionally, many took out SBA loans, a 
low-cost loan to get themselves back 
on their own feet. 
Here is the problem: My constituents 
never thought that taking out an SBA 
loan, a loan that they would be paying 
back, would prevent them from also re-
ceiving other Federal aid. 
This problem of dual benefits was ad-
dressed in law recently by my friend 
Representative GARRET GRAVES from 
Louisiana, but the fix came too late for 
some. Many victims of disasters who 
would be eligible for Federal aid such 
as CDBG-DR are not able to access 
that aid. 
This amendment will not be able to 
provide the estimated nearly $3 billion 
that the Texas General Land Office be-
lieves would be needed to help all of 
those affected, but my amendment will 
solve this problem for some of the most 
vulnerable people who unfairly fell 
through the bureaucratic cracks. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in sup-
port of this amendment, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Chair, I 
ask unanimous consent to claim time 
in opposition, although I do not oppose 
the amendment. 
The CHAIR. Is there objection to the 
request 
of 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas? 
There was no objection. 
The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from 
Texas (Mrs. FLETCHER) is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. I yield myself such 
time as I may consume.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H957 
February 7, 2020 
Madam Chair, I rise today to offer 
this bipartisan amendment with my 
colleague and neighbor, Mr. CRENSHAW, 
to help families who, through no fault 
of their own, were denied disaster re-
covery funding—in our case, for our 
constituents 
affected 
by 
Hurricane 
Harvey. 
As Members of this body will recall, 
Hurricane Harvey landed on the Texas 
Gulf Coast in August of 2017. It was the 
second costliest hurricane in United 
States history. It took 68 lives, it 
dropped more than 60 inches of rain, 
and it caused nearly $125 billion in 
damages. 
Our community came together to 
help, and we showed each other and the 
Nation how much we can accomplish 
when we work together to help our 
neighbors in need. 
This body worked, too, appropriating 
funds quickly to help those affected for 
immediate assistance and for long- 
term rebuilding. 
But the needs were great and the 
funds, though well-intentioned, were 
slow. So many of our constituents took 
out loans from the Small Business Ad-
ministration, where they could get 
low-interest loans to begin the nec-
essary and immediate work of rebuild-
ing. 
When they applied for the SBA loans, 
they were told that taking out a loan 
would not disqualify them from other 
disaster aid. Unfortunately, they were, 
in fact, disqualified from other forms 
of Federal aid because they had taken 
out an SBA loan. 
b 1100 
If they had taken out a loan from a 
friend or a bank, they would not have 
been in this situation. They would still 
be eligible for the Federal aid. 
But because they chose to take out 
an SBA loan in the midst of an unprec-
edented disaster, they were disqualified 
from receiving further Federal assist-
ance. 
Of course, that is inconsistent with 
the program, it is inconsistent with the 
intent of this body to punish people for 
seeking help from the agencies that are 
there to help them in their times of 
need. 
I have heard from so many constitu-
ents who have been left behind by 
what, by all accounts, was a mistaken 
interpretation of the intent and the 
rules that need to be corrected. We 
simply cannot leave them behind. 
We now have the opportunity to cor-
rect this error here and to bring mean-
ingful relief to disaster victims. This 
amendment will fund $45 million to 
those in Texas who were wrongfully de-
nied assistance because they took out 
SBA disaster recovery loans. We have a 
chance today to right this wrong and 
to deliver the help that our neighbors 
have been waiting on for years. 
During Harvey, our community dem-
onstrated that we are at our best when 
we are working together to solve prob-
lems, and this amendment does the 
same. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
amendment, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. CRENSHAW. Madam Chair, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. 
GRAVES). 
Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Madam 
Chair, I thank the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW) for fighting for 
the disaster victims of the awful hurri-
canes that his constituents and others 
have gone through in Texas, Florida, 
North Carolina, Puerto Rico, and the 
Virgin Islands. 
And I want to thank Congresswoman 
FLETCHER for her co-sponsorship of this 
amendment and efforts to get this 
wrong fixed. 
Madam Chair, I want to very simply 
explain what is happening here. So you 
have people that have experienced dis-
asters; that have been through some 
type of flood or other disaster. The im-
mediate assistance that is available to 
those disaster victims, and this is for 
homeowners, for renters, not for busi-
nesses—but the Small Business Admin-
istration offers loans, disaster loans, to 
individuals. They offer it to businesses, 
too, but they offer loans to individuals. 
And that is the only money that is 
largely available in the immediate 
aftermath. There may be a small grant 
available from FEMA, but it is the 
only money. So if you want to be 
proactive, if you want to lean forward, 
those are the resources that are avail-
able. You apply for a loan. So that is 
one of your options. 
The other option that you have is 
that you can sit back in a FEMA-sup-
plied hotel room, or you can sit back in 
a FEMA-supplied trailer. The trailers, 
by the way, cost about $150,000 a piece, 
under FEMA’s ridiculous process. 
So you can have one option where 
your thousands and thousands of dol-
lars of taxpayer funds are paying for 
your hotel room. You can have another 
option where $150,000 is going toward a 
trailer to house you temporarily, while 
you sit back and wait. 
The other option is you lean forward, 
you get the loan, and you help to re-
build. You help to get your community 
back on its feet. You help to get the 
tax base. 
Under our ridiculous Federal policies, 
the people that were proactive are pe-
nalized. 
The gentleman from Texas, the gen-
tlewoman from Texas, they are exactly 
right. The people are penalized that are 
trying to get recovered faster; that are 
trying to get their community recov-
ered faster; that are trying to not 
spend more taxpayer funds on hotel 
rooms or trailers. 
Yet, our Federal policy penalizes 
them for it; tells them that when 
grants are available, grants that you 
don’t have to pay back; that they are 
ineligible. We are rewarding the wrong 
type of behavior. 
So, with the help of many people in 
this room, we changed the law. The 
Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 
changes, section 1210(a). We fixed this. 
The problem is, it took HUD over a 
year to write guidance, and they to-
tally missed it. They invented criteria 
that is not in the law. They totally 
missed it. They introduced discrimina-
tory criteria and make it virtually im-
possible for many people to get assist-
ance. 
So what this amendment does, it is 
adding money to help fix a wrong. It 
shouldn’t have to be done. 
I urge adoption of this amendment. 
But most importantly, Madam Chair, 
we have got to fix these policies that 
are causing the Federal Government to 
re-victimize disaster victims. That is 
not why we are here. That is not rep-
resenting. 
I will say it again; I urge adoption of 
this amendment. I want to thank my 
friends from Texas for their work on 
this. We need to move forward and fix 
this long-term. 
The CHAIR. The time of the gen-
tleman from Texas has expired. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Chair, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the chair-
man of the Transportation, and Hous-
ing and Urban Development, and Re-
lated Agencies Subcommittee. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Chairman, I rise in support of this 
amendment. 
I know the amendment doesn’t fully 
address the Member’s concerns, but it 
addresses them substantially, and I 
look forward to working with them fur-
ther to engage both HUD and the Texas 
Land Office to work toward a solution 
for this issue. 
So I thank both of my colleagues for 
putting this constructive amendment 
forward, and their effort to highlight 
this issue that is of great importance. 
I am happy to offer my support. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Chair, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Chair, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding, and I 
thank her and Mr. CRENSHAW for this 
very wise amendment to this impor-
tant legislation. I thank them for their 
leadership. The experience that they 
had in Texas is one that is shared in 
the rest of the country as well. 
I urge an ‘‘aye’’ vote on that impor-
tant Crenshaw/Fletcher amendment. 
Madam Chair, many of us remember 
that nearly 21⁄2 years ago, Hurricanes 
Maria and Irma tore through Puerto 
Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and 
left a trail of heartbreak and devasta-
tion in their wake. Thousands of Amer-
icans, all Americans citizens, trag-
ically lost their lives. 
Following 
the 
hurricanes, 
many 
Members traveled to the islands. We 
saw firsthand the homes that were de-
stroyed, the communities that were 
ravaged, and the businesses and schools 
left in ruin. And we saw that the in-
competence and indifference of many 
from here compounded this terrible hu-
manitarian crisis. 
It is unacceptable that the adminis-
tration illegally withheld for a full

H958 
February 7, 2020 
year the assistance that Congress ap-
propriated and that Puerto Rico needs, 
both to recover from Maria, and to pre-
pare for future disasters in Puerto Rico 
and the Virgin Islands. 
In recent weeks, tragedy has once 
again hit Puerto Rico as more than 
1,000 
earthquakes—1,000 
earthquakes 
have rocked the island since December 
28. Schools have crumbled, hospitals 
are in disarray, and houses have been 
destroyed. Thousands of people are 
staying in shelters or sleeping outside 
out of fear that their homes could col-
lapse as they sleep. 
And tragically, two Americans have 
lost their lives, including a 13-year-old 
girl in Vieques, where too many are 
still waiting for the Federal assistance 
needed to modernize hospitals and im-
prove access to care. 
Madam Chair, as Members of Con-
gress, our most important responsi-
bility is to keep the American people 
safe. Two weeks after devastating 
earthquakes struck Puerto Rico, our 
fellow Americans on the island still 
face serious challenges to their safety, 
health, and well-being. 
Every family that is sleeping outside, 
every child who no longer has a school 
to go to because of seismic dangers, 
every person who dies because they 
can’t access a hospital, each is a chal-
lenge to the conscience of our country. 
Today, with this strong supplemental 
assistance package, the Democratic 
House and, hopefully, with strong bi-
partisan support, is showing the people 
of Puerto Rico that we are there for 
them now, and throughout the road to 
recovery. 
I 
salute 
Chairwoman 
NYDIA 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, our fearless, persistent 
champion of Puerto Rico in the Con-
gress, born there, family there. Thanks 
also to the members of the Congres-
sional Hispanic Caucus for raising a re-
lentless drumbeat on behalf of the fam-
ilies on the island. 
Today, I also salute the distinguished 
chair of the Appropriations Committee 
for working right away, as soon as we 
came back into session in January, to 
provide assistance to Puerto Rico, the 
best route there. That guidance was led 
by our distinguished chair of the sub-
committee of jurisdiction, Mr. PRICE. 
So I thank Chairwoman LOWEY and 
Chairman PRICE. Thank you for bring-
ing us to the floor today on this impor-
tant legislation. 
This supplemental assistance pack-
age provides the relief that is urgently 
needed to help Puerto Rico and the 
Virgin Islands rebuild and recover 
today. And it invests billions in efforts 
to prevent damage and loss of life in 
the future. 
Although the earthquake was in 
Puerto Rico, the ramifications are in 
that region. 
The package, as has been noted, pro-
vides more than $3 billion for disaster 
relief and long-term recovery; $1.25 bil-
lion for highway emergency relief, 
which will also go to disaster-struck 
States on the mainland; hundreds of 
millions for critical investments in 
education, nutrition assistance, elec-
tric grid recovery, and strong tax relief 
for Puerto Rico and other territories, 
including permanent changes to the 
Earned Income Tax Credit and the 
Child Tax Credit, and new investments 
to boost local economies and create 
good-paying jobs on the island. 
I thank our distinguished chair of the 
Ways and Means Committee, RICHIE 
NEAL, for his leadership in having this 
part of the package. 
Sadly, there are some who have some 
obstacles to sending this emergency 
money to Puerto Rico following the 
earthquake. As Members of Congress, 
we have a responsibility to act because 
our fellow Americans deserve to know 
that their government will be there for 
them without question or hesitation in 
this dark hour. 
Might I say, I am reminded, so many 
people in our country don’t realize 
Puerto Ricans are American citizens. 
Many of them, if you visit there, you 
will visit veterans’ centers where so 
many of them come together. They are 
American patriots who help our coun-
try. We are so proud of them, and we 
salute them; and in this time of need 
we want to help them. 
I urge a strong vote to provide help, 
healing, and hope for Puerto Rico. 
Mrs. FLETCHER. Madam Chair, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I thank my colleagues for their col-
laboration on this bill. I thank Mr. 
CRENSHAW for working with me on this 
important effort for our community 
and for communities across our State 
and, of course, our country. 
I thank everyone for their collabora-
tion and support in this effort, and for 
the eloquent statements and important 
statements made this morning in sup-
port of this amendment on the floor. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this amendment. And I yield back the 
balance of my time.

amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. CRENSHAW). 
The amendment was agreed to.

Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I have an

ficiency in accordance with the Final Guid-

(72 Fed. Reg. 2732),’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 
833, 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB) and a Member op-
posed each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from Michigan. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I would 
like to begin by thanking Congress-
woman 
LOWEY, 
our 
Subcommittee 
Chairman PRICE, and their staff for 
working with me on this amendment 
and for their critical leadership on this 
bill. 
I would also like to thank my sisters 
in service, Congresswoman VELA´ ZQUEZ 
and Congresswoman OCASIO-CORTEZ, for 
leading this amendment with me. I am 
so proud to partner with them to make 
our government more accessible, espe-
cially in times of disaster. 
This amendment ensures meaningful 
access to fellow Americans with lim-
ited English abilities to the public in-
formation maintained by grantees of 
the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development’s 
Community 
Develop-
ment Fund. 
The amendment rests on two prin-
ciples, Madam Chair. First, the Puerto 
Rican people have a right to know how 
this relief money is being spent in their 
own communities. 
Second, no one is in a better position 
to hold officials and grant recipients 
accountable and to ensure that the 
money we allocate today is used in the 
best interests of the community than 
the people of Puerto Rico themselves. 
That is why it is critical that we en-
sure that any information made avail-
able is easily accessible to all people, 
regardless 
of 
what 
language 
they 
speak. 
I cannot overstate how important it 
is that we pass this bill. The people of 
Puerto Rico are struggling and perse-
vering through some of the most dif-
ficult circumstances that any of us 
have ever experienced. 
The bill provides over $4 billion in 
critical disaster relief and long-term 
recovery assistance, and funds pro-
grams and grants to get kids back in 
fully-functioning 
schools, 
repairing 
damages to infrastructure and roads, 
and to rebuild the island’s electrical 
grid that has been damaged because of 
disasters and so forth, and ensure that 
no one else is affected, or that children 
don’t go to sleep hungry. 
It is time—it is time to release these 
funds. 
To hold the money that can save 
lives is not only inhumane and im-
moral, but it is, more dangerously, a 
form of oppression. The disconnection 
to human suffering that we cause by 
doing nothing is what will continue to 
fail the American people. 
Passing this bill fulfills the central 
promise of our democracy governed ‘‘of 
the people, by the people, and for the 
people.’’ 
b 1115 
Passing this amendment in this bill 
ensures that some of the most vulner-
able people have full access to democ-
racy, regardless of who they are, where 
they are from, and what language they 
speak.

port this amendment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H959 
February 7, 2020 
from North Carolina (Mr. PRICE), my 
distinguished 
fellow 
colleague 
and 
chairman of the Subcommittee on 
Transportation, 
and 
Housing 
and 
Urban Development, and Related Agen-
cies. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Chair, I thank my colleague for yield-
ing. 
I am happy to rise in support of this 
amendment. It is a very well-consid-
ered amendment, one that is an impor-
tant addition to this bill. 
Access to linguistically appropriate 
materials, understandable materials, 
in the CDBG-DR program is vitally im-
portant. Meaningful access to program 
materials is essential for transparency, 
for public input, and for knowledge on 
how you take advantage of these bene-
fits and these programs and what is 
available under the disaster assistance 
programs. 
While HUD currently requires all 
grantees to provide meaningful access, 
this puts a finer point on it, and we 
need to do that. It is important to un-
derscore HUD’s responsibility and the 
grantee’s responsibility to provide ac-
cess in dispensing this aid. 
I thank my colleagues for this 
amendment. 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Chair, I want to 
reiterate 
the 
importance 
of 
this 
amendment. As a person who was born 
and raised in this country and who 
didn’t speak English when I started 
school, and who is now a Member of 
this Chamber, I can tell my colleagues 
personally how critical this is to our 
democracy and to protecting all of us. 
I thank my colleagues again for their 
tremendous support, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 6 OFFERED BY MR. LEVIN OF 
MICHIGAN 
The CHAIR. It is now in order to con-
sider amendment No. 6 printed in part 
C of House Report 116–392. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chair, I have an amendment at the 
desk. 
The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate 
the amendment. 
The text of the amendment is as fol-
lows: 
Page 12, line 18, after the dollar amount, 
insert ‘‘(reduced by $1,000,000)(increased by 
$1,000,000)’’. 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Reso-
lution 833, the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. LEVIN) and a Member opposed 
each will control 5 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Michigan. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, 
I 
thank 
Chairwoman 
LOWEY
and subcommittee Chairman 
PRICE
for their leadership and for 
bringing this much-needed package to 
the floor today. 
I am pleased to see that this bill in-
cludes funding for the long-term recov-
ery of territories impacted by recent 
disasters, including continued support 
for the electric grid’s recovery. 
After Hurricane Maria hit Puerto 
Rico in 2017, it took an entire year to 
restore power to the whole island. Then 
last month, back-to-back earthquakes 
damaged Puerto Rico’s main power 
plants and caused yet another major 
blackout. 
The people of Puerto Rico—and all 
Americans, for that matter—cannot be 
forced to grapple with blackout after 
blackout, 
especially 
when 
climate 
change has made catastrophic storms 
all too frequent. As we think about 
what is needed to ensure the long-term 
recovery of these areas, it is absolutely 
essential that renewable resources be 
part of that conversation. 
That is why I have introduced this 
simple amendment to prioritize fund-
ing for renewable energy projects, like 
wind and solar power, that will en-
hance the long-term resiliency of Puer-
to Rico’s infrastructure. 
We have already seen what renewable 
energy can do in the aftermath of a dis-
aster. During the blackout that fol-
lowed Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rican 
homeowners, businesses, and hospitals 
waiting for repair crews actually in-
stalled their own solar panels and bat-
teries to get their power back faster. 
Last year, Puerto Rico passed a law 
setting a timeline to power the island 
entirely by renewable energy by 2050. 
That is a great step, but it is not near-
ly enough, and Puerto Rico needs our 
Nation’s help. 
We have to ensure renewables are 
prioritized for Puerto Rico’s recovery, 
for the sake of their ability to survive 
disasters like Hurricane Maria and for 
the sake of our planet. Power genera-
tion from fossil fuels is a major source 
of the greenhouse gas emissions that 
are making climate change worse. 
We have to make major changes fast. 
Shifting to renewables is one change 
that will help combat climate change 
and help the American people cope in 
the aftermath of major disasters. 
Again, I thank Chairwoman LOWEY 
for her work on this bill, and I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina 
(Mr. 
PRICE), 
the 
sub-
committee chairman and my dear col-
league. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Chairman, I thank my colleague for 
yielding. 
I am happy to rise in support of this 
amendment. This amendment high-
lights the importance of prioritizing 
funding for renewable energy projects 
that will enhance the long-term resil-
ience of Puerto Rico’s infrastructure. 
A reliable and resilient power grid is 
critical to Puerto Rico’s ability to 
withstand and quickly recover from fu-
ture disasters. 
Madam Chairwoman, if I might, I 
want to take just a moment also to 
highlight section 304 of the bill. Sec-
tion 304 requires HUD and other Fed-
eral partners to finish the consultation 
on the $2 billion provided in the Bipar-
tisan Budget Act for electrical grid im-
provements in Puerto Rico and the 
U.S. Virgin Islands within 30 days and 
for HUD to issue a notice in 60 days. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Chairwoman, I will close by saying 
that I really appreciate our ability to 
take this small step, but I think we 
ought to all dream big for this beau-
tiful part of our country. 
Puerto Rico has been subject to mis-
fortunes, and we can think about a dif-
ferent future for Puerto Rico where it 
moves very quickly not just to renew-
able energy but to localized renewable 
energy, so that each community has 
solar, microgrids, and battery storage, 
so that they really aren’t subject to 
these disasters in the same way at all. 
Madam Chairwoman, I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The CHAIR. The question is on the 
amendment offered by the gentleman 
from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN). 
The amendment was agreed to. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MS. SHALALA 
The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of 
rule XVIII, the unfinished business is 
the demand for a recorded vote on the 
amendment No. 1 printed in part C of 
House Report 116–392 offered by the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Ms. 
SHALALA) on which further proceedings 
were postponed and on which the ayes 
prevailed by voice vote. 
The 
Clerk 
will 
redesignate 
the 
amendment. 
The Clerk redesignated the amend-
ment.

So the amendment was agreed to. 
The result of the vote was announced 
as above recorded. 
The Acting CHAIR (Mr. HORSFORD). 
There being no further amendments, 
under the rule, the Committee rises. 
Accordingly, the Committee rose; 
and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. CAS-
TOR of Florida) having assumed the 
chair, Mr. HORSFORD, Acting Chair of 
the Committee of the Whole House on 
the state of the Union, reported that 
that Committee, having had under con-
sideration the bill (H.R. 5687) making 
emergency 
supplemental 
appropria-
tions for the fiscal year ending Sep-
tember 30, 2020, and for other purposes, 
and, pursuant to House Resolution 833, 
he reported the bill back to the House 
with sundry amendments adopted in 
the Committee of the Whole. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the rule, the previous question is or-
dered. 
Is a separate vote demanded on any 
amendment reported from the Com-
mittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair 
will put them en gros. 
The amendments were agreed to. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the engrossment and 
third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time. 
MOTION TO RECOMMIT 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I have a 
motion to recommit at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the 
gentleman opposed to the bill? 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I am in 
its current form. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion to recom-
mit. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Cole moves to recommit the bill H.R. 
5687 to the Committee on Appropriations. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes 
in support of his motion. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
reluctant opposition to this bill. Long 
before I was privileged to come to this 
House, I was Secretary of State in 
Oklahoma at the time of the Oklahoma 
City bombing, and I was tasked by the 
Governor to work with my friend, our 
colleague Mr. LUCAS, to work with the 
Congress to see that we received timely 
assistance for a disaster that was clear-
ly not of our own making. We got that 
assistance, and I am forever grateful to 
this body and the people in it that 
worked with us at that particular time. 
Madam Speaker, since I arrived in 
Congress, I never forgot the help that 
we received from the Congress of the 
United States. So I routinely voted for 
almost every supplemental that related 
to disaster relief. I was one of 49 Re-
publicans who voted for Sandy relief, 
and I have no doubt that our fellow 
Americans in Puerto Rico are in dire 
need and certainly need help at this 
particular time. 
I was very proud, as I know many 
Members were in the last Congress, to 
vote for over $40 billion of relief to 
Puerto Rico. It needed that money. 
There was no question about it. 
Madam Speaker, we are moving pre-
maturely here. That money, that $40 
billion, roughly half has yet to be ex-
pended. It is available for immediate 
use right now. 
We still have $42 billion in the Dis-
aster Relief Fund. That money is avail-
able for immediate use right now. 
There is an ongoing FEMA investiga-
tion to determine the precise needs of 
Puerto Rico. That has yet to be com-
pleted and reported to Congress. We 
should wait for that disaster relief, not 
because it may tell us that we need 
less, but it might actually tell us that 
we need more. We should not act with-
out appropriate information. 
So, Madam Speaker, I think the ap-
propriate thing to do is to send this 
back to the committee and wait for the 
information to move. If we move now, 
precipitously, it is almost certain that 
the United States Senate will not pick 
up this relief, and the President will 
probably not sign this bill if it got to 
his desk. 
If we wait for the appropriate infor-
mation, use the available funds that we 
have right now to help people in Puerto 
Rico, we have a much better chance of 
getting our fellow Americans the help 
they need, when they need it, in the 
right amounts, and in the right way. 
There is no doubt in my mind that 
this 
Congress 
will 
respond 
appro-
priately to an emergency. I have seen 
us do it time and time again on a bi-
partisan basis. I know we will do it 
again at the appropriate time. 
So Congress will respond, if nec-
essary. Frankly, Madam Speaker, I 
simply move that we recommit the 
current legislation to the Appropria-
tions Committee, wait on the informa-
tion, and then act in the interests of 
our fellow Americans. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to the motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Florida is recognized for 5 
minutes. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma talked about 
timely assistance for his State. I think 
that is important because that is what 
we are asking for for Puerto Rico here 
today. 
We talked about the $42 billion for 
hurricanes. We all know that less than

February 7, 2020 
half that money has still gotten to the 
island already, and we are talking now 
about earthquakes, a totally different 
disaster in the southwestern portions 
of the island, unique in character. 
These funds may not even cover some 
of these other issues happening. When 
you look at the schools, in particular, 
that are all across the island, this is 
unique because they were made to 
withstand hurricanes, not earthquakes. 
I agree, if we need more funds, we can 
always supplement with another bill. 
Why are we waiting? Why would we 
wait today when the people of Puerto 
Rico, our fellow Americans, need our 
help? 
That is why we are here today. Imag-
ine a thousand earthquakes since De-
cember and imagine those thousand 
earthquakes happening after Hurricane 
Maria—nearly a hurricane five—hits 
and destroys most of your island. 
My guest was Jessica Carrillo who 
left the island and had to come to cen-
tral Florida because she was weary 
from sleeping in her car or sleeping on 
her porch, day in and day out for over 
a month. 
I had the opportunity to go firsthand 
to Puerto Rico and see that damage as 
the grounds shifted below our feet. We 
talked about the schools. We talked 
about the folks who were in the dis-
aster relief camps, and the Costa Sur 
Power Plant, which is closed, that now 
puts them in a tough position. 
So I ask: Let’s put together and pass 
this bill that will provide $4.67 billion 
in disaster relief and vote against the 
motion to recommit because we can’t 
wait any longer. 
I ask you to vote ‘‘yes’’ on the ulti-
mate package, to rise above the poli-
tics of disaster relief because but for 
the grace of God go you and your fami-
lies, your districts, and your States. 
We rose together for Hurricane Mi-
chael in my State of Florida and for 
Hurricane Harvey in Texas. 
I ask this House to get the job done 
here today. Vote ‘‘no’’ on the motion to 
recommit and vote ‘‘yes’’ on this very 
good bill to help Americans in Puerto 
Rico. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to recommit. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
RECORDED VOTE 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I demand 
a recorded vote. 
A recorded vote was ordered. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 9 of rule XX, this 5- 
minute vote on the motion to recom-
mit will be followed by a 5-minute vote 
on passage of the bill. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—ayes 178, noes 223,

f 
b 1215 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Speaker, last 
night during Roll Call No. 51, I was in-
advertently recorded as voting ‘‘no’’ on 
H. Res. 826, Expressing Disapproval of 
the Trump Administration’s Actions 
Towards Medicaid, when it was my in-
tention to vote ‘‘yes.’’ I respectfully re-
quest this be officially reflected in the 
RECORD, and ask my full written state-
ment be entered in the RECORD as well. 
Madam Speaker, last night during a long se-
ries of votes, I was inadvertently recorded as 
voting ‘‘no’’ when it was my intention to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on rollcall No. 51. H. Res. 826, a resolu-
tion ‘‘Expressing disapproval of the Trump Ad-
ministration’s harmful actions towards Med-
icaid.’’ I rise today to correct the record and 
make it clear to my constituents and col-
leagues that I unequivocally oppose the 
Trump Administration’s proposal to block grant 
Medicaid and gutting a critically important 
piece of the Affordable Care Act. 
The Trump Administration’s proposal which 
will cap federal funding and cut coverage and 
benefits, is exactly the opposite of what I’ve 
championed during my time in congress. The 
proposal will harm low-income parents and 
children, people with disabilities, and many 
older Americans. It would make it more dif-
ficult for states to finance their Medicaid pro-
grams which would ultimately and inevitably 
lead to reductions in benefits for our most vul-
nerable citizens. 
The administration’s proposal also turns its 
back on the commitment Congress and the 
federal government made to states to cover 
90 percent of the cost of Medicaid if those 
states agreed to expanding the program. As a 
steadfast supporter and defender of the Af-
fordable Care Act, it is undeniable that the ex-
pansion of Medicaid under that law has pro-
vided us the greatest opportunity to provide

tens of millions of uninsured Americans health 
coverage. This expansion has resulted in the 
lowest uninsured rate in our country’s history 
leading to better coverage, access, and quality 
of care and I would never do anything to un-
dermine this important law. 
Thank you, Madam Speaker, for the oppor-
tunity to address the House and make clear 
my opposition to the Trump Administration’s 
attacks on our critically important Medicaid 
programs.

ADJOURNMENT 
FROM 
FRIDAY, 
FEBRUARY 7, 2020, TO MONDAY, 
FEBRUARY 10, 2020 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that when the 
House adjourns today, it adjourn to 
meet on Monday next, when it shall 
convene at noon for morning-hour de-
bate and 2 p.m. for legislative business. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
MALINOWSKI). Is there objection to the 
request of the gentleman from Mary-
land? 
There was no objection. 
f 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. SCALISE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), my friend, the majority leader, 
for the purpose of inquiring about the 
schedule for the House next week. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the minority whip for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I will say that the 
House will meet at 12 p.m. for morning- 
hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative 
business, with votes postponed until 
6:30 p.m. on Monday next. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 
House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning- 
hour debate and 12 p.m. for legislative 
business. 
Mr. Speaker, on Thursday, the House 
will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative busi-
ness, with last votes of the week ex-
pected no later than 3 p.m. We will con-
sider several bills under suspension of 
the rules. The complete list of suspen-
sions will be announced by the close of 
business today. 
Mr. Speaker, the House will consider 
H.R. 2546, Protecting America’s Wilder-
ness Act. This bill is a package of lands 
bill out of the Committee on Natural 
Resources and would designate 1.3 mil-
lion acres as wilderness or potential 
wilderness areas, preserving these pub-
lic lands for the benefit of current and 
future generations. 
In addition, Mr. Speaker, the House 
will consider H.J. Res. 79, Removing 
the Deadline for the Ratification of the 
Equal Rights Amendment. This bill 
would remove the deadline to ratify 
the ERA, paving the way for it to be 
added to the Constitution and taking a 
historic 
step 
forward 
for 
women’s 
equality. 
Mr. Speaker, I would add this is not 
an adoption of an assumption, that, in 
fact, the 38 States who have ratified to 
date have not ratified within the 
framework of the Constitution, and, 
therefore, that amendment should in 
fact be judged to have been adopted. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding back and 
for going through those items that are 
going to be up on the House floor next 
week. 
I would like to ask the majority lead-
er with respect to some of the things 
that were discussed at the State of the 
Union—and I am sure we are going to 
be talking about a few things that hap-
pened during the State of the Union. 
The President identified a number of 
items where he challenged us in Con-
gress to work with him on addressing 
some of the challenges that are facing 
our country. And he identified some 
items by executive order that he is 
working on, but he also identified some 
items from infrastructure—where I no-
ticed there was applause on both sides 
of the aisle—to some areas on edu-
cational opportunities, school choice— 
where 
unfortunately, 
the 
remarks 
weren’t received as equally as maybe 
they should have been—but it also pro-
vides us some opportunities to find 
some areas where we can work and 
achieve some things that would benefit 
people all across this country. 
I would ask the gentleman, first, 
starting with infrastructure, there is 
tremendous interest that I have heard 
from Members on both sides to try to 
work on a package that we can get 
agreement on. 
I haven’t seen the Committee on 
Transportation 
and 
Infrastructure 
tasked directly with doing that, but I 
have heard there is interest from 
Chairman DEFAZIO and from Ranking 
Member SAM GRAVES in trying to reach 
that common ground. 
Is there an emphasis that is placed 
from the leadership of the majority on 
tasking the Committee on Transpor-
tation and Infrastructure with actually 
going and working and going and find-
ing that common ground, which we 
know is there, to try to put together an 
infrastructure package in these next 
few months? 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the answer 
to the gentleman’s question is yes. And 
indeed—as I think the gentleman prob-
ably knows—the leaders of the relevant 
committees, Mr. NEAL and Mr. DEFA-
ZIO—Mr. NEAL on the funding side, Mr. 
DEFAZIO on the substantive side of the 
policy with respect to infrastructure 
and transportation and other items 
that we think need to be included in in-
frastructure. 
We met with the President of the 
United States in April. Mr. Speaker, I 
will tell the gentleman, it is probably 
the most positive meeting that I have 
had with the President and that other 
members in the group had. This was 
Democrats and then the Secretary of 
Transportation was also there, Ms. 
Chao. 
And we talked about our joint com-
mitment to infrastructure investment. 
We had suggested, as the President 
suggested during his campaign, that 
our target be $1 trillion over 10 years. 
In other words, a $100 billion a year, or 
on average, investment in infrastruc-
ture so that we will not only create a 
lot of American jobs, but also assure 
ourselves of being competitive with our 
competitors around the world in the 
21st century. 
The President responded that he 
thought $1 trillion was too little and 
suggested a $2 trillion investment, i.e., 
doubling the $100 billion to $200 billion 
on average per year over 10 years. And 
we had discussion about that. We indi-
cated that we agreed with the Presi-
dent that such an investment would be 
warranted, and productive and, frank-
ly, grow the economy and therefore be 
an investment and not simply an ex-
penditure. 
Mr. NEAL made the point, Mr. Speak-
er, that the President—if we would give 
him some direction on what he could 
support in terms of funding that in-
vestment. And I made the observation, 
I said to him, ‘‘Mr. President, neither 
in the Senate nor the House will Re-
publicans or Democrats support that 
big of an investment if you are not 
leading. To which he responded to me, 
Mr. Whip, ‘‘Steny, I agree with you.’’ 
We then scheduled a meeting to be 
held—we thought—3 weeks, but it was 
some 5 or 6 weeks later. And unfortu-
nately, for whatever reason—both sides 
have their thoughts as to why—the 
President came to the meeting and said 
he was not prepared to meet. And we 
have not had that meeting since. 
But I will emphatically say to the 
gentleman, we want to work on infra-
structure. We think it is critically im-
portant. The President said during the 
campaign he thought it was critically 
important. I think your side, both here 
and on the Senate side, believes infra-
structure is important. 
So certainly, as I said, yes, we want 
to see if we could work together to 
adopt 
a 
significant 
infrastructure 
package, which we think would be good 
for the country. 
Secondly, let me say that the Presi-
dent also mentioned two other things— 
one of which was prescription drugs. 
We had passed a prescription drug bill, 
H.R. 3. The President sent down a mes-
sage that he would veto it if it were 
passed as it was. 
What I would suggest, following the 
regular order, the Senate ought to take 
it up, change it, amend it—do whatever 
they feel is appropriate to do—pass it, 
if they can, and then let us have a con-
ference. Because we have all said that 
we want to bring down the prescription 
drug prices. 
In fact, the President says he wants 
to negotiate. We included in H.R. 3 ne-
gotiation. The President said he want-
ed to key prices to our global competi-
tors. In particular, we put six large na-
tions, which are similar to ours, in-
cluding Australia, Great Britain, Ger-
many, Canada, France—and one other

February 7, 2020 
nation—in that calculation. And that 
we would, in our bill, cap the prices at 
120 percent of the average price across 
those six nations. That was something 
the President wanted to do. 
And he responded to a question about 
negotiation, saying ‘‘I want to nego-
tiate like crazy.’’ He is a businessman. 
He is a realtor. He knows a lot about 
negotiation and price. And so I think 
we have component parts in common. 
And my suggestion would be, again, 
that they take up H.R. 3, which is the 
prescription drug bill, do what the Sen-
ate’s will is to do, that we go to con-
ference, 
and 
that 
we 
discuss 
dif-
ferences, harmonize the bills, and pass 
a bill and send it to the President. 
So there is certainly, in my experi-
ence of a long time here, that is the 
way we should get that done. I think 
that would be positive for the country 
and I think we could reach consensus, 
hopefully 
from 
the 
administration, 
from your party, my party, and pass 
those two bills to the benefit of the 
American people. 
The last thing I would discuss is the 
President said he was against pre-
existing conditions being precluded 
from getting insurance. We share that 
view. We have passed a bill over to the 
Senate that affects that end. The Sen-
ate could take that bill up. Again, 
work on it, do whatever the will of the 
Senate is to do, go to conference. And 
assuming that we follow the Presi-
dent’s stricture of wanting to ensure 
that preexisting conditions do not pro-
hibit anybody from getting insurance, 
we could pass that bill. 
So my response is that we pass three 
bills—or two bills and then infrastruc-
ture, which were four—and those are 
positive items we can work on, and we 
are prepared to do so. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. On those fronts, clearly 
there is an ability to find common 
ground as we talk about infrastructure. 
There has been a lot of discussion over 
what that number would be, what the 
amount would be, because ultimately, 
it would have to be a number that we 
could both get an agreement amongst 
Republicans and Democrats that would 
be paid for. 
And I think both sides acknowledge, 
it has got to be paid for. That has usu-
ally been the sticking point with infra-
structure. But within that, whether it 
is $200 billion or $2 trillion, there is an 
understanding that we need to do more 
work to try to find out how we can get 
agreement on how to pay for it. And I 
do think the ability is there to find 
that agreement. The amount would be 
variable. 
But also, it is something the Presi-
dent has talked about, as well as a 
number of Members of Congress have, 
making reforms to the way we build 
major projects: roads, bridges. The in-
frastructure delays so often are caused 
by red tape that is unnecessary. 
I have heard from Governors, both 
Republican and Democrat, that would 
like to see Congress not only send 
money—obviously, the States would 
like to see more Federal money come— 
but also, to see less strings attached so 
that a project that right now might 
take maybe 10 years to do, because of 
so many overlapping delays in red tape, 
that should maybe take 2 years at 
most. In many cases, that delay alone 
is what prohibits the project from 
being done because it drives the cost up 
so much. Because a project that might 
take 10 years, in many cases is going to 
be deemed unaffordable and it just gets 
scrapped as opposed to if we address 
not just the financing, but also the bu-
reaucracy and eliminating red tape so 
that we can get more projects done 
quickly. I think that would be another 
area where there is a lot of mutual in-
terest in seeing if we can come to-
gether. 
And the President is very interested 
in doing that, when I have had talks 
with him. It is not just the amount 
that we are able to get agreement 
upon, but it is also the reforms to the 
red tape so that we can move projects 
quicker. 
And 
in 
many 
cases, 
do 
projects that are unaffordable because 
of those delays that are unnecessary. 
And I know that is something we can 
work on. Hopefully, we can get every-
body together a few more times to get 
closer to finding that agreement on in-
frastructure. 
As it relates to healthcare, there has 
definitely been a divide between our 
sides, if you look at H.R. 3. I think the 
gentleman recognizes it was a very bi-
partisan bill. The vote reflects that. 
The Senate—however our agreement 
might be on how the Senate does busi-
ness, clearly, they do business dif-
ferently than the House—but tradition-
ally, they have been reluctant to take 
up hyper-partisan bills when they are 
moving things through. They will go 
more to a bill that has got more broad 
support. USMCA is a real good example 
of that. It is probably the best tem-
plate for how both sides can work to-
gether to do something big. Something 
very bipartisan, something very good 
for our country and something that we 
were able to get moved through both 
sides. 
b 1230 
If you look at H.R. 19, for example, I 
would suggest to the gentleman that 
whatever the bill number is, it is not 
really the number of the bill. It is what 
is ultimately in it that we can get bi-
partisan agreement upon. 
H.R. 19 was an approach that we took 
to say let’s go find not the partisan ap-
proaches 
to 
healthcare, 
but 
areas 
where we had broad bipartisan support, 
including the package of bills that 
came out of the House Energy and 
Commerce Committee unanimously. 
Most people across the country are 
shocked when they hear that Congress 
actually did work together. 
Republicans and Democrats came to-
gether to put together a package of 
bills that would lower drug prices that 
the President would sign that could be 
in law today where prescription drugs, 
generic drugs, would be on the market 
quicker so people could be paying a 
lower cost. 
That package of bills came out of 
committee unanimously. Every Demo-
crat, every Republican worked for 
months. It took a long time to put that 
agreement together, but, ultimately, 
both sides did come together. 
If we could look at those approaches. 
And, again, H.R. 19 includes only bills 
that 
were 
bipartisan. 
People 
had 
worked together on various elements of 
improving healthcare, from lowering 
prescription 
drugs, 
protecting 
pre-
existing conditions, but not in a par-
tisan way, in a bipartisan way that 
could actually get signed into law. 
One way or another, we are going to 
find some issues where we can move, 
both Republican and Democrat coming 
together, bills over to the Senate. 
Those would clearly have a much high-
er likelihood of not only getting taken 
up by the Senate, but actually getting 
signed into law. 
So I would suggest, when you look at 
some of those approaches, the bipar-
tisan approach where you don’t have a 
Presidential veto, but you also have a 
strong ability to get Senators on both 
sides to want to take that up as well. 
And then, finally, on school choice, 
the Education Freedom Scholarship 
and Opportunity Act, this is something 
that President Trump cited in the 
State of the Union specifically, and 
you can see it in isolated cases. 
I come from a city, New Orleans. I 
was born in the city of New Orleans. I 
was on the board of Teach for America 
in New Orleans, and we had a dramatic 
overhaul of our public school system 
where we created a charter school 
movement. 
It was actually a Democrat Gov-
ernor, Kathleen Blanco, who, unfortu-
nately, passed away recently, who 
signed 
that 
bill, 
Republicans 
and 
Democrats working together, that has 
transformed some of the worst failed 
public school systems in the country. 
New Orleans’ public school system— 
prior to our reforms, considered by 
most as the most failed public school 
system in the country—now has a very 
healthy 
charter 
school 
movement 
where children have real opportunities. 
Parents 
have 
real 
opportunities. 
Schools are competing for students, 
and it is working for the student. This 
is in a large urban system where it was 
failed, and now it is very successful. 
Clearly, no system is perfect, but 
there are many more options there. 
There are many more options for par-
ents. 
Congressman BYRNE has a bill—there 
are other bills that are out there—to 
try to give at least some additional op-
tions to families so that, if they are in 
a failing school, they can have a better 
place to go, and, ultimately, the sys-
tem would be working better for the 
students. 
So, on all of those fronts, I would 
hope that we could find those areas of

common ground and start there, build 
that, and work with the Senators and 
with the President, who wants to ad-
dress these issues, like we were able to 
address USMCA, which was signed into 
law last week. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comment. 
First, let me talk about the prescrip-
tion drug bill. We did pass a bill that 
was a compilation of six bills that had 
five Republican supporters when we 
voted on it. So there was a bipartisan 
bill. 
Let me suggest we ought not to dis-
miss however the Senate operates, the 
way the regular order operates is we 
pass a bill. Yes, we are in charge, and, 
like you, we pass bills that we think 
are important. When you were in the 
majority, you did the same thing. 
Some had Democratic votes, some did 
not. But the Senate had an opportunity 
to send us back bills. 
We have 275 bills that we have done. 
We think they are all on substantive 
matters that deal with items that are 
good for the people, for the American 
people, and the Senate has not acted on 
them. 
The way the system ought to work is 
we send our ideas over there; if they 
have different ideas, they send them 
back to us, and we go to conference and 
resolve it. I agree with the gentleman, 
that is what we ought to do, and I am 
hopeful that we could do that. 
But the bill that we did pass, as I say, 
was a compilation of seven bills and 
had five Republicans. But, as you do, 
five Republicans makes it a bipartisan 
piece of legislation, and the Senate 
could send it back with something we 
don’t agree on and try to resolve it be-
cause we want to reach that end. 
The other bill the gentleman talks 
about, H.R. 3, the bill that we brought 
out had improvements to the ACA to 
make it work for the American people. 
Your side, of course, wants to repeal 
the Affordable Care Act. Our side dif-
fers and believes that, in fact, millions 
of people, not only those who avail 
themselves of ACA—and, in the short 
term, it didn’t bring down premiums, 
but it is now starting to bring down 
premiums, as we thought it would. 
The constant assaults on the ACA by 
people who want to see it repealed have 
obviously hurt that because it has un-
dermined certainty, which means that 
the insurers are not certain what the 
rules are going to be, and, therefore, 
our view is the premiums are still in-
flated. 
But, again, I would urge the whip to 
talk to Mr. MCCONNELL and say: Look, 
we have a lot of bills over there. Pass 
your version of the bill, send it back 
and let us work on it, and let’s see if we 
can get to an agreement. 
That is how we have done for hun-
dreds of years, and that is the way we 
ought to continue to do it. 
I realize that Mr. MCCONNELL, as any 
majority leader the Senate has, has 
challenges in doing that; and what I 
think, frankly, he does not want to do 
is get to a bipartisan agreement which 
will allow passage through the Senate. 
We don’t have that here, as you 
know. Your side could pass bills on a 
partisan 
basis 
when 
you 
were 
in 
charge; we can do the same. 
As I say, we had five Republicans 
agree with us on the bill to which you 
referred, but I would hope you would 
urge Senator MCCONNELL to pass our 
bills. 
Senator BRAUN from Indiana was on 
TV with Chuck Todd on ‘‘Face the Na-
tion’’ talking about impeachment. He 
said: Let’s get through this impeach-
ment and get to the people’s business. 
I think that was a reasonable propo-
sition. The problem is the Senate is not 
getting to the people’s business. They 
are not passing their own bills, and 
they are not passing our bills. In fact, 
they are spending all their time con-
firming judges. 
We think that has a purpose of mak-
ing sure that, for the long term, wheth-
er they are in the majority or not, they 
will have an influence on what happens 
in the United States. I understand that 
political motivation, but it is impeding 
us doing the people’s business. 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. SCALISE and I try to 
work together. I would hope that the 
Senate would work together so that 
they could send us back bills of their 
choice, we can go to conference, and we 
can make things happen. 
This House, last year, passed over 400 
pieces of legislation. I don’t have the 
exact number that the Senate has 
passed of significant bills as opposed to 
naming post offices or something like 
that, but it is in the tens, not the hun-
dreds. 
Mr. SCALISE. Clearly, we have got a 
lot of agreement on our disagreement 
with the Senate’s way of doing busi-
ness. Of course, one of their impedi-
ments that I know I have encouraged a 
change in that they haven’t taken up is 
the 60-vote rule just to bring up a bill. 
So many of the bills, when we were in 
the majority, that would go over to the 
Senate that we felt strongly about that 
would not be brought up, it was a ma-
jority Republican Senate, but because 
they have a 60-vote requirement, the 
minority could and would, on occasion, 
prevent many of those bills from com-
ing up. 
But that is why I suggested to the 
gentleman, what we found is, of the 
issues we would like to tackle that we 
really do feel confident we can get an 
agreement with the President on, the 
Senate has shown a higher likelihood 
of taking up a bill if it has got that 
broad support. 
And so in the example of H.R. 3—and, 
for the record, there were only two Re-
publicans who voted for it—while that 
could be called bipartisan, there was a 
separate package of bills that came out 
of committee unanimously. 
So, if you have one approach that 
still is viewed as very partisan, with 
just two Republicans voting for it, to 
address healthcare issues, if there is a 
different way to approach it where 
every Republican and every Democrat 
on 
the 
committee 
of 
jurisdiction 
passed those bills that would lower 
drug prices and the President said he 
would like to sign it, I would think the 
gentleman would agree, if those two 
bills are put side by side, which one do 
you think would have a higher likeli-
hood of making it through the Senate 
to the President’s desk? It is very clear 
that the one that was unanimous would 
have a higher likelihood. 
And that is why I just suggested H.R. 
19, because that was a bill that, while 
we would have liked to have included a 
number of other issues that maybe just 
our side might support, we put those on 
the side for now to say let’s find those 
areas in healthcare where we have very 
broad support amongst Republicans 
and Democrats, and that is reflected in 
H.R. 19. You want to put a different 
package together. 
If the approach is let’s address this in 
a bipartisan way, we have a very high 
likelihood of getting not just the Presi-
dent’s support, but also the Senate’s 
support at moving that through. 
I don’t know if the gentleman has 
any more comments on that. 
Mr. HOYER. I would simply say, if we 
reach a consensus in the Congress—we 
are a coequal, separate branch of gov-
ernment—and 
whether 
Obama 
was 
President or whether Mr. Trump is 
President, I am for the Congress acting 
on that which it agrees. 
Is it helpful to have agreement with 
the President? It is. But if we can’t 
reach agreement with the President, 
our responsibility as a Congress, the 
Senate and the House, is to move poli-
cies that we believe are advantageous 
for the people. 
If the President disagrees, then we 
have the option of overriding that veto. 
It is doubtful that we would do that, I 
understand. But that is the process 
that I think is most productive and 
most expected by the American people. 
I would again reiterate, on the bill 
that you keep saying could have unani-
mous support, in my opinion, what it 
would not have in terms of healthcare 
is support for doing what we so fer-
vently believe needs to be done, and 
that is to make sure the ACA works as 
it was intended to do. 
If there is an alternative, we should 
consider that. But, very frankly, nei-
ther the President nor your side of the 
aisle has had agreement on an alter-
native. 
Senator McCain, as you know, was 
the deciding Republican vote on the 
last health bill that you sent to the 
Senate, and you sent that when you 
were in the majority. It didn’t pass, 
notwithstanding the fact that you also 
had the majority in the Senate. 
Two weeks after you had the celebra-
tion at the White House, I was as-
tounded to hear that the President ef-
fectively called that a mean bill. 
So we do have substantial disagree-
ments. That does not mean that, given

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H966 
February 7, 2020 
the fact that we have a Democratic 
House, that is, that we are in the ma-
jority, and a Republican Senate with 
the Republicans in the majority—now, 
I understand the gentleman’s concern 
that it is necessary to get bipartisan 
agreement in the Senate in order to get 
that 60-vote threshold. And you and I 
may agree on the 60-vote threshold of 
getting bills on the floor. It is one 
thing to pass something or not. 
But, in any event, I would urge the 
gentleman to urge Mr. MCCONNELL to 
pass their prescription bill. And if it is 
what you say and it can be done unani-
mously, send it over here and we will 
have a conference. Because both of us 
have articulated that we are for mak-
ing sure that prescription drug costs do 
not price people out of being healthy. 
So I would urge you to do that. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman. 
And now that the Senate has a little 
more free time, maybe we can get them 
to take up some of that legislation. I 
surely hope that we, on both sides, will 
continue working toward those, be-
cause there are areas of common 
ground that many have found and 
many have worked for months to find. 
I do want to shift gears and talk 
about the decorum the night of the 
State of the Union. 
The President talked about many 
things, as in any State of the Union, 
and I have attended 10 now. We have 
had Republican and Democrat Presi-
dents, and there are things that I agree 
with in certain States of the Union, 
and you can stand, you can sit, you can 
applaud. But I think we all saw some-
thing that goes way beyond and, in 
fact, violates the rules of decorum in 
the House, and that is when the Speak-
er ripped up the speech. 
Clearly, it was a premeditated move. 
I have seen actual video of her prac-
ticing or starting to rip it prior to the 
end of the speech. 
But 
when 
you 
go 
through 
the 
speech—and, 
again, 
the 
President’s 
theme was ‘‘the great American come-
back,’’ and he talked about things that 
are working well in our country, work-
ing well for everybody, where every 
segment of society is benefiting, and, 
of course, as every President since 
Ronald Reagan has done, highlighting 
some of those great things that are 
happening in our country by bringing 
people into the gallery to show the real 
face on some of these great things that 
our country does. 
Again, if part of a policy that created 
that great visual is something that one 
side disagrees with, some people stand 
up, some people don’t. But to suggest 
that it didn’t happen or that it is a 
lie—as some in the leadership of your 
majority 
actually 
said, 
the 
whole 
speech was a lie—I would ask: Was 
General Charles McGee’s recognition as 
a Tuskegee Airman a lie? I think that 
was something great that people en-
joyed celebrating. 
Kayla 
Mueller, 
the humanitarian 
worker who was brutally murdered by 
al-Baghdadi—it happened. Her family 
was here. And al-Baghdadi was taken 
out by American troops, which I think 
was the right thing to do. That is not 
a lie. That is something that we ought 
to recognize and respect. 
b 1245 
When 
Staff 
Sergeant 
Christopher 
Hake was killed serving a tour of duty 
in Iraq by a roadside bomb that was 
generated from an Iranian terrorist, 
which was led by General Soleimani. 
And now Soleimani is gone because the 
President took action to take him out. 
That happened. It is not a lie. 
In fact, the fact that Soleimani is 
gone is something we should all cele-
brate, just as we celebrated when 
President Obama gave the order to 
take out Osama Bin Laden. 
I think for most people there wasn’t 
a dry eye in the House. I know I have 
heard from friends all across the coun-
try who were tearing up when they saw 
First Class Sergeant Townsend Wil-
liams, who had been on his fourth tour 
in the Middle East, and here was his 
wife and young children, and the Presi-
dent surprised surely her, and all of us, 
by bringing him back home. What a 
special moment that was, just to see 
that family reunited. 
And, again, tears, I think, were not a 
partisan issue at that moment. But it 
clearly did happen, and is not a lie, and 
it is something, again, we should all 
celebrate. 
But again, for decorum of the House, 
for the Speaker to do that, I think 
most would agree, was not appropriate. 
At a minimum, an apology should have 
happened. There wasn’t. 
We brought legislation yesterday to 
rebuke the Speaker to make it clear 
that that is something not becoming of 
any Member of the House, let alone the 
Speaker of the House. Unfortunately, 
it was tabled on the roll call vote yes-
terday. 
But I would hope that we could rec-
ognize, when that happens again, that 
we won’t tolerate that kind of activity 
from our Members, let alone our lead-
er. 
If the gentleman has anything to say 
about that, I will yield. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, starting a 
State of the Union with a shout of 
‘‘four more years’’ reminds me more of 
a rally than a State of the Union. 
Clearly, neither the Speaker, nor any 
of us in any way diminished people 
that he introduced; some of whom I se-
verely disagree with and thought that 
the actions taken with respect to that 
individual were totally inappropriate 
in a State of the Union because it 
served further to divide and to under-
mine any ability to work together. 
Having said that, ‘‘four more years’’ 
was disrespectful to this institution. 
The recitation in the gentleman’s 
resolution of the honoring of individ-
uals he just reflected had nothing to do 
with the State of the Union, but had 
everything to do with honoring people 
who had done great things, experienced 
great 
hardship, 
who 
ought 
to 
be 
empathized with; no one was saying 
those were a lie. 
One can interpret the speech for what 
each believed it was and can say some-
thing about it and reflect to the Amer-
ican people what they think of the sub-
stance of the representation of the 
State of the Union. 
It had nothing to do with the people 
who were honored, whether we agreed 
with them being honored or not. Cer-
tainly, I agreed with almost every one 
of them, save one. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman’s comments, but 
those names were part of that docu-
ment that was ripped, and I am sure 
many of them were as offended as we 
are that it happened. I just would hope 
it wouldn’t happen again. I wish we 
would all speak out equally against 
that. 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, none of 
those individuals should take anything 
that was done personally. In fact, al-
most every one of those individuals 
was honored by people on this side of 
the aisle and that side of the aisle ac-
knowledging them and honoring them 
with appropriate action. 
Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I appre-
ciate the gentleman making that state-
ment, and I would share that. I wish 
the person who took the action would 
make that statement to those people 
because many were offended. But that 
will be left to discuss later. 
But for now, I look forward to work-
ing with the gentleman on all of these 
issues that we discussed that the Presi-
dent offered the olive branch for us to 
work with him on and, I think, are 
very achievable if we do roll up our 
sleeves and tackle it together. 
I think there is, again, a template for 
how to do it. USMCA is clearly one, 
and there are many others. 21st Cen-
tury Cures is another example when we 
were in the majority with a Democrat 
President and worked very closely to 
achieve something that will be a mile-
stone in curing major diseases for 
years to come; and, hopefully, we can 
deliver more of those kinds of wins for 
the American people that we all rep-
resent. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS WEEK 
(Mr. HORSFORD asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HORSFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate Gun Violence 
Survivors Week. 
Every Nevadan was affected by the 
October 1 shooting that claimed 59 
lives, injured more than 800, and shat-
tered the lives of countless more. Gun 
violence has touched too many of our 
lives, both on that day, 2 years ago, 
and daily. In Nevada, someone is killed 
by gun violence every 19 hours.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H967 
February 7, 2020 
I personally lost my father to gun vi-
olence when I was 19 years of age. And 
these deaths are preventable. 
My bill, H.R. 4836, the Break the 
Cycle of Violence Act, is an important 
step forward to get ahead of the sense-
less violence. 
I am also proud that nearly a year 
ago, the House passed H.R. 8 for mean-
ingful gun background checks. 
I know the cruelty of suffering a loss 
at the hands of a gun; knowing your 
loved one won’t come home because 
someone was armed with a weapon 
they should not have had access to. 
I urge my colleagues in the Senate to 
vote on H.R. 8, and for this body to 
take up H.R. 4836.

MERRILL’S MARAUDERS 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I had 
the honor of meeting Gilbert Howland 
and Bob Passanisi at a reception hon-
oring Merrill’s Marauders of World War 
II. 
During the war, Gilbert and Bob vol-
unteered for a mission that was de-
scribed as only dangerous and haz-
ardous. These brave men, and approxi-
mately 3,000 others, answered the call 
of duty and were deployed to Northern 
Burma to fight behind enemy lines. 
Only nine of these selfless volunteers 
are still alive today, and they deserve 
to be honored for their bravery, their 
sacrifice, and their love of country. 
Pennsylvania had more Marauder 
volunteers than any other State, and 
one volunteer, Russell Hamler, from 
Pittsburgh, is still with us today. 
I am proud to cosponsor H.R. 906, the 
Merrill’s 
Marauders 
Congressional 
Gold Medal Act, introduced by Rep-
resentative PETE KING of New York. I 
would like to encourage my colleagues 
to support this bipartisan legislation 
and honor the legacy of Merrill’s Ma-
rauders.

f 
ISSUES OF THE WEEK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GOHMERT) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the minority 
leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, under 
the new rules of this Congress, since 
the rules have been changed that only 
allow one Special Order per week, and 
despite for years my having encouraged 
members of our conference to sign up 
for Special Orders, it is our chance to 
get messages out that we feel need to 
be out. 
As I have said for years to our con-
ference, you need to sign up for the 
Special Orders because you don’t want 
my face to be the face of the party. 
And I am very encouraged, we have got 
more people signing up now. 
But under the Speaker’s new rules, as 
of this Congress, only one per week per 
person, so I am pleased, Mr. Speaker, 
to be here for my one Special Order of 
the week. 
And what a week it was. Wow. The 
impeachment proceedings came to the 
conclusion that most everybody who 
had studied the situation knew that 
they would; no matter how long it got 
drug out, it was going to be this con-
clusion. 
The State of the Union address Tues-
day night; most people, or at least 
around here, most people know the 
Constitution requires a State of the 
Union report or address, but it doesn’t 
require that it be done orally. And 
originally, the very first were provided 
in writing. 
But it is an opportunity for us to 
come together, even though it has not 
been quite as homogenous a body as it 
has been at times when it comes to the 
State of the Union. 
It has just been interesting. You 
know, some call it Trump Derange-
ment Syndrome, some call it PTSD, 
President Trump Stress Disorder. But 
apparently, he causes stress, in some 
cases derangement, so people that nor-
mally think straight just have trouble 
reaching the same wise conclusions 
that they used to. So that has been an 
interesting thing to observe. 
But here we are, end of the week of 
impeachment, end of the week after a 
State of the Union address. 
I was honored to have my friend, 
Nigel Farage, who has been fighting for 
about a decade, actually, to make the 
point that President Trump has been 
making here in America; that unless 
our country is strong, we cannot take 
care of other countries’ disasters and 
problems 
or 
assaults 
on 
freedom 
around the world. We can’t. We have to 
make sure we are strong first. 
And the example that has been given 
before of being on a jet plane, and the 
instructions, for good reason, say that 
the adult must put the mask on in the 
event of a loss of cabin pressure, which 
means there will be a loss of oxygen. 
So put your mask on first, so that you 
will be conscious and helpful to your 
children and others who are not able to 
put the mask on themselves. 
If we are not strong, if we don’t take 
care of the United States of America, 
as our oath should require us to do, 
then we are not able to be that shining 
light on a hill. We are not able to be 
that hope for freedom. 
There are a lot of countries around 
the world that don’t care for the 
United States. Some of it is simple 
jealousy. 
But some call the United States im-
perialist pigs, which is no reflection on 
the United States. It is a reflection on 
their ignorance of what imperialism 
means, as well as exactly what the his-
tory of the United States is. 
We have gone and fought and sac-
rificed our greatest treasure, American 
lives—you are hard-pressed to find any 
place in history where a country sac-
rificed that precious treasure, in our 
case, American lives—for other peo-
ple’s freedom. And we don’t require 
that they learn our language; that they 
begin to get permission from our gov-
ernment here in order to conduct af-
fairs in their own country. 
We are not imperialists. We are not 
seeking a hegemony. That is not the 
case at all. We are about freedom. 
b 1300 
We have so many friends in France. 
We have, of course, a painting over 
here. It is the only painting in the 
whole Capitol full length of a foreigner, 
and here it is. It has been here in the 
House for so many decades, a friend of 
George Washington that is over here on 
my right, Lafayette. 
We have had great help from the 
French. In fact, they helped ensure the 
final victory at Yorktown with their 
ships and their military. The French 
military was there at the surrender, 
where Cornwallis cowardly said he was 
ill and couldn’t come out and sur-
render, so he sent out a subordinate. 
We owe the French people a great deal. 
Historians have wrestled with how, 
after the American Revolution, we 
came about having freedom without 
the thousands of heads being separated 
from bodies, as occurred after the 
French Revolution that began 10 or so 
years after we got our Constitution. 
The French Revolution ended up ulti-
mately resulting in an Emperor named 
Napoleon. Before Napoleon even took 
charge, so many people were killed, so 
much bloodshed. 
Historians have wrestled with that. 
How did the American Revolution re-
sult in freedom without the tremen-
dous beheadings and hangings that oc-
curred in other places like after the 
French Revolution? What made the dif-
ference? I believe those who point to 
the First Great Awakening around the 
1730s and 1740s, a recognition of Bib-
lical principles and of just who Al-
mighty God was and is and this desire 
for freedom that our Creator has pro-
vided. 
Some say, well, if we are endowed 
with it, why doesn’t everyone have 
freedom around the world? Well, like 
anything you inherit, if you are not 
willing to fight for it, there will be evil 
people who will take it from you, and 
you won’t have it. Thank God for all of 
those who have served in our military 
and fought for freedom. 
Some historians say the big dif-
ference, they believe, between the re-
sults of the American Revolution and

the French Revolution was that the 
American Revolution was about lib-
erty, and the French Revolution was 
about revenge. As long as this country 
has been about liberty, it has soared, 
and people have done well. 
Of course, in the second century of 
our country, there was another great 
awakening in the decades before the 
Civil War, and some would indicate ac-
tually the second great awakening, an 
awakening of something Daniel Web-
ster, John Quincy Adams, of course, 
Frederick Douglass knew better than 
anybody. But how can you be a Chris-
tian and follow the teachings of Jesus 
and at the same time put brothers and 
sisters in chains and bondage? They are 
inconsistent. They are incongruent. 
You can’t have those two things work-
ing together. Sure, slavery is talked 
about in the Bible, and it has always 
been around, and it grieves me greatly. 
We heard a year ago, at the National 
Prayer Breakfast, there are now more 
slaves in the world than there have 
ever been at any time in the world’s 
history. Tragic. Some say, well, that 
points to our own disgusting history 
here in the United States, like Colum-
bus coming over and establishing slav-
ery. Again, a lot of people don’t know 
their history, but there were Indian 
tribes that had captured and enslaved 
other Indian tribes. I used to say Na-
tive Americans, but we have had so 
many Native Americans testify before 
our committee, and they normally say 
I am an Indian from the such and such 
Indian Tribe, so that has been a revela-
tion. 
Nonetheless, 
slavery 
has 
existed 
since the fall of man. It is an evil that 
exists in this world, and I am glad we 
were rid of it in the United States. It is 
tragic that it took a Civil War and the 
loss of a half-million lives, but, again, 
it took a second great awakening. And 
that was about liberty; it wasn’t about 
revenge. 
We get to the 20th century, helped in 
two world wars. We haven’t had a great 
awakening in over 100 years. I think it 
shows in the activity here in this body, 
and I think it shows in activities 
across the country. I think it is some-
thing that would serve us well and help 
refine the country if we were to have a 
third great awakening. Instead, we see 
tremendous partisanship. 
I really appreciated the majority 
leader explaining for our Speaker what 
she really meant by things she had 
said. Of course, she had said that the 
State of the Union Address had no con-
nection with reality. She said the 
speech was a pack of lies. She said the 
President was selling a bill of goods, 
like a snake oil salesman. And I appre-
ciated our minority whip, my friend 
STEVE SCALISE, asking about that. It 
certainly appears there were a lot of 
truthful things. 
Just to highlight some of the Presi-
dent’s guests, this should have been a 
feel-good event across the aisle. And I 
wasn’t a personal fan of President 
Obama, but when he would tell a story 
that touched the heart, as there were 
so many of those stories in the State of 
the Union, how could you not be 
moved? How could you not applaud and 
stand and cheer for some of those he-
roic situations? So I thought it was 
like a good movie. You laugh, you cry, 
you cheer. And there were those 
events. 
I have run into this myself. One lady 
told me she was so sensitive to the 
Holy Spirit after she finished saying 
some really nasty things about me. She 
said, when you came up, the Holy Spir-
it left, and I realized she was com-
pletely consumed with hate. So, yes, 
you can’t be consumed with that kind 
of hate and still feel the presence, as 
you say you have, of the Holy Spirit. If 
you can set those kinds of feelings of 
hate aside long enough, then it is easi-
er to find areas of mutual agreement. 
Stephanie and Janiyah Davis from 
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she was 
the fourth grade student who loves art 
and math. For too long, she has been 
assigned to low-performing schools. 
Her mom, Stephanie, is a hardworking, 
single mom who tried to apply for a tax 
credit scholarship. But since the Gov-
ernor had vetoed the school choice leg-
islation, Janiyah remained among the 
estimated 50,000 students on a wait list. 
As was announced here in this body— 
I was sitting right up there—she was 
getting a scholarship. How could we 
not all cheer this child with so much 
promise having the chance to pursue 
her dreams and get the best education, 
just like children of Presidents of both 
parties have here in Washington as 
they send their child or children to pri-
vate schools? Why not give a poor mi-
nority a chance that the President’s 
children have? 
Juan Guaido from Caracas, Ven-
ezuela, of course, he was the interim 
President of Venezuela. I thought it 
was inspirational to have him here and 
allow us to pay tribute to whom many 
of us believe is the actual, legitimate 
Venezuelan 
President. 
But 
as 
the 
President pointed out, the U.S. is sup-
porting the Venezuelan people in their 
struggle for freedom and democracy. 
Kelli and Gage Hake from Stillwater, 
Oklahoma, Kelli was at home with her 
1-year-old son, Gage, when she learned 
that her husband, Army Staff Sergeant 
Christopher, had been killed while 
serving his second tour of duty in Iraq. 
He was killed by the explosive devices 
designed and produced under the aus-
pices of a guy named Soleimani, whom 
President Trump had ordered taken 
out. Such an irony, too, he was killed. 
It shouldn’t have been a partisan 
thing over someone being killed by a 
drone strike because I am not aware of 
any of my friends across the aisle who 
expressed any concern when President 
Obama had a father and son, two Amer-
ican citizens, killed without arrest or 
trial with a drone strike. I don’t re-
member anybody on the other side of 
the aisle being upset or expressing that 
outrage that President Obama had fa-
ther and son killed—the son, appar-
ently, a minor—had them both taken 
out by a drone strike. But I could un-
derstand why President Obama would 
do that. This al-Awlaki, he was an 
American citizen. 
As I pointed out before, it is a flaw 
that has occurred in our citizenship 
system, where there was no act of Con-
gress. We can’t find that there was 
even an executive order. But some-
where along the way, despite the lan-
guage during debate of the 14th Amend-
ment that made clear, no, they were 
not anticipating that if you were—and 
they didn’t say alien. They said for-
eigner or a diplomat here. Well, of 
course, your children are not going to 
be American citizens, and they weren’t 
for years. But somewhere, in the dec-
ades following the adoption, the ratifi-
cation of the 14th Amendment—and 
like I say, I can’t even find an execu-
tive order—some bureaucrats appar-
ently in the State Department, I guess, 
just decided it would be easier to start 
bestowing citizenship on children of 
people who were here illegally, or as 
the ratifiers of the 14th Amendment 
called them, foreigners. They didn’t 
even care if they were legally here or 
illegally here. They certainly did not 
anticipate that children of foreigners 
here would be American citizens. 
Like I say, I have been trying to find 
out who made that decision to start 
giving citizenship to people who are 
born here. Our friend Judge Andrew 
Napolitano, I have heard him say on 
FOX News before that, basically, peo-
ple need to get over it. It doesn’t mat-
ter who you are. If you are born here, 
you are an American citizen. 
But he was just ignorant of the fact 
that if you are a diplomat’s child born 
here, you are not an American citizen. 
So those were the two areas. If you are 
a foreigner’s child, a diplomat’s child, 
you weren’t to be an American citizen. 
b 1315 
But it would be very interesting if we 
could ever find out who made that call 
and how do we go about curing it now. 
But I think the President is right. If 
that was done by just some bureau-
crat’s decision, no act of Congress, no 
executive order, just somebody just 
started giving out American citizen-
ship to people who were born here to 
foreigners, then you should be able to 
retract it with a President’s executive 
order overruling whatever desk jockey 
or bureaucrat decided it was too dif-
ficult to assess whether somebody was 
here legally or not, and so just start 
giving out American citizenship. 
But the name al-Awlaki, he is one of 
many people that we know—at one 
point, I only knew a couple. I wasn’t 
willing to give those names out be-
cause they were given to me in a per-
sonal request not to give them out 
until others were known so that that 
person’s identity wasn’t in jeopardy of 
being learned. 
But al-Awlaki, his parents came over 
on a student visa. He was born here.

They take him back to Yemen. They 
teach him to hate America. 
Apparently, there may have been 
people in the Bush administration; cer-
tainly there were in the Obama admin-
istration. They apparently thought he 
was being a double agent and helping 
the U.S., when, actually, he was fo-
menting violence against Americans 
here and abroad. 
So it is understandable that Presi-
dent Obama or people in his adminis-
tration who had tried to work with al- 
Awlaki, they wouldn’t want him com-
ing back and having a big trial where 
he revealed the different people he had 
worked with in different administra-
tions, so the answer is take him out 
with a drone strike. Never mind his 
minor son is in there. We don’t know if 
he was guilty of fomenting violence or 
not, but he was a juvenile, as I under-
stand it. 
We hear all these allegations about 
President Trump but not so much 
about the murders ordered by Presi-
dent Obama, whether we call them 
murders or killings. I don’t think they 
actually meet the criminal require-
ments of being murder because they 
were people normally that he took out 
by order of a strike. They were enemy 
combatants who were killing Ameri-
cans. 
So I didn’t have a problem with him 
protecting American interests in doing 
what President Obama did, nor do I 
have a problem with President Trump 
protecting our country doing the same 
thing. 
Again, I appreciate the majority 
leader saying: No. No. When the Speak-
er was talking about all the lies, just 
the whole speech was a pack of lies. He 
was selling a bill of goods like a snake 
oil salesman. The whole speech had no 
connection with reality. 
He was explaining that she actually 
wasn’t talking about all these people 
who were introduced. I look forward to 
the Speaker pointing that out. 
Jody Jones from Farmersville, Cali-
fornia: On December 17, 2018, Jody’s 
brother, Rocky Jones, was shot and 
killed by an illegal immigrant in Cali-
fornia. The criminal alien who had 
committed this brutal murder was pre-
viously arrested for violent crimes and 
twice deported. 
The criminal alien was arrested in 
December 2018 for the sixth time, but 
because of California’s sanctuary State 
policy, he was released from jail. A few 
days later, he went on a 24-hour reign 
of terror, injuring several people, rob-
bing a gas station, leading law enforce-
ment on a high-speed chase, and killing 
51-year-old Rocky, who was known as a 
kind and gentle soul. He left behind a 
precious daughter and four brothers. 
I don’t see anything in any of these 
that should have been considered lies. 
These are touching stories. 
I realize we have a disagreement 
here, as many do across the country. I 
think there is a bill proposed with a 
new way forward where we even pro-
vide airfare to people who have been 
deported to bring them to the United 
States. 
I think the Trump administration is 
doing a good job getting rid of people 
who are criminal threats to this coun-
try, and I applaud those efforts. I think 
it is part of our keeping our oath to our 
Constitution that we take here. 
Our devotion is not to citizens of the 
world. It is like President Trump has 
pointed out: We can’t help the world if 
we are not strong as a nation. 
That is what Nigel Farage has been 
successful in promoting, a removal of 
the U.K. from the European Union. You 
have got some bureaucrats making de-
cisions who are not residents of Eng-
land, and yet they are making deci-
sions that have adversely affected the 
lives of the British people, and I can 
understand them being upset. 
Yes, there are those who say, if we 
had a one-world government, then 
there is no need for war, the same ar-
gument that was made for the Euro-
pean Union: Look, if we are all one 
country, then we can’t have another 
world war started between Germany 
and France or anybody else because we 
are all one government. 
Orwell would probably acknowledge 
that as a great basis for creating Big 
Brother that watched over everybody, 
which seems to be where we continue 
to move in this country, into a great 
socialist, communist, progressive soci-
ety. 
As 
Whittaker 
Chambers 
quoted 
Dostoevsky: 
The problem with communism is not eco-
nomic. The problem with communism is 
atheism. 
I will never forget, before the fall of 
the Soviet Union, going into the only 
authorized seminary, Christian semi-
nary in the whole Soviet Union at a 
place called Zagorsk. As you turned in 
the gate, there was a big building 
there, and the building had a picture of 
Lenin’s face, and it said, in Russian: 
‘‘Lenin is with us.’’ 
The message was clear: You may be 
going into this Christian seminary, but 
just understand, this is a communist 
country—or a socialist country, as 
they called themselves—and here, it 
isn’t Christianity that is good. It is im-
portant you know Lenin is the one who 
is with us. 
It was interesting visiting Lenin’s 
tomb in those days. The rumor was 
that his ear had deteriorated to the 
point that they replaced it with a rub-
ber one. I never knew if that was true 
or not, but his ear didn’t really look 
real. 
But, nonetheless, that was their mes-
sage: This dead Lenin is with us and 
not some God you Christians think you 
should worship. 
But we are moving toward a time in 
this country, unless it is interrupted— 
and I think the election of President 
Trump 
helped 
interrupt 
it—where 
Christians are really the only identifi-
able group in America where it is po-
litically correct to condemn them, to 
belittle them, to persecute them. And 
we are still seeing that grow. 
It is interesting that it grows at a 
time when anti-Semitism continues to 
grow here, as in Europe. 
We had, from Scottsdale, Arizona, 
Iain Lanphier. I didn’t realize his 
great-grandfather was going to be right 
there and that he was a 100-year-old 
Tuskegee Airman, one of those heroic 
airmen who were segregated but had 
incredible courage, incredible ability, 
and they flew missions that were just 
incredible. They showed such courage 
in helping protect freedom even though 
they were fighting segregation, or had 
to deal with it back then. What a he-
roic group. 
This young man is the great-grand-
son 
of 
Tuskegee 
Airman 
Charles 
McGee. Of course, Iain wanted to be, 
and still wants to be, a member of the 
United States Space Force. 
Those were all inspirational. 
Now, I know, and I think the major-
ity leader referred to it, they disagreed 
with Rush Limbaugh being recognized. 
He is an incredible man, an extraor-
dinary man. I recall back when I was 
on the bench as a judge in Texas seeing 
that the Republican majority elected 
in November of 1994 recognized Rush as 
an honorary member of their class. 
They paid tribute. Without him, they 
didn’t think Republicans, for the first 
time in 40 years, would have gotten the 
majority back. 
Of course, Newt Gingrich was leading 
that 
charge 
from 
a 
congressional 
standpoint. 
But he is an amazing guy. Even when 
I get really frustrated and depressed 
about some of the things going on here, 
I can listen to Rush, and he has such an 
amazing sense of humor. So it has been 
interesting. 
As his producer—Bo Snerdley is his 
radio name—can verify, as he has to 
me many times—I love the guy—he can 
personally testify that Rush Limbaugh 
is not a racist. James can verify that, 
has verified that. 
Anyway, I know Rush. I just think 
the world of Rush and what he has 
tried to do. I thought now that he has 
been diagnosed with stage IV cancer, it 
was a great tribute. 
We see it here in this body. We have 
people in this body who have made ar-
guments staunchly against the things 
we really believe in, and we find out 
they have got cancer. In our Thursday 
morning Prayer Breakfast, we pray for 
each other. It doesn’t matter about 
party. 
Sometimes in that Prayer Breakfast 
you hear testimonials from people and 
you had no idea the things they have 
gone through, but we set aside the po-
litical things to pray for each other 
and care about each other. 
So I have been a bit burdened to see 
people 
so 
angry 
about 
Rush 
Limbaugh’s recognition for the things 
that he has been amazing and done. I 
think the slurs about him being a rac-
ist, they are absolutely absurd. Talk to 
James. 
Rush did not hire James because he 
was Black. He hired him because he is

an amazing guy, and he has been help-
ful to Rush. But, like I say, I love 
James. He is just great guy. 
I am so pleased the President recog-
nized Rush. I got up to the gallery up 
there, Rush was there, and it meant a 
lot to me to hug Rush Limbaugh and 
encourage him, and I will continue to 
pray for him as well. 
I am just sorry that people can’t take 
a step back when somebody is going 
through what Rush is and at least drop 
some of the outrageous slander. 
We also had retired Brigadier General 
Charles McGee. He is the great-grand-
father of Iain Lanphier. 
I know comments were made that the 
whole speech was a pack of lies, but 
these were extraordinary people. As 
their stories were told, there was 
cheering. There were tears. It was just 
a feel-good time. 
It should have been for all Ameri-
cans, when we could see the things that 
brought us together and made us 
strong, and yet there were people who 
were not about to stand up and ac-
knowledge and applaud some of these 
folks.

That is really tragic. And it wasn’t 
just Rush Limbaugh. 
Paul Morrow, a United States Army 
veteran, but he started a successful 
contracting 
business. 
Today 
he

portunity zone in Montgomery. 
Carl and Marsha Mueller from Pres-
cott, Arizona, as far as I know, no rela-
tionship to Bob who cost us $30 million 
or so when he knew immediately that 
his investigation was a sham. There 
was no collusion or conspiracy between 
the Trump campaign and Russia, even 
though there are people who continue, 
after 2 years and 30 or so million dol-
lars, establishing no conspiracy or col-
lusion between the Trump campaign 
and Russia, people still keep wanting 
to bring up that as if the lie is truth. 
But Bob Mueller—I regret the dam-
age that he has done to the name 
‘‘Mueller.’’ These folks were wonderful. 
Kayla was a devoted humanitarian 
aid worker. I knew the story. My heart 
broke for these people. It is just hor-
rendous 
to 
think 
about 
what 
al- 
Baghdadi did to their daughter, a lov-
ing, caring, dedicated person of faith 
trying to help others, and al-Baghdadi 
repeatedly raped her. It is more than a 
parent should ever have to deal with to 
think about. 
But we also heard those stories about 
Boko Haram after they attacked a 
Christian school. I was invited over 
there. We didn’t have people from the 
Obama administration that appeared 
to want to help initially, even though 
there 
was 
a 
hashtag, 
#bringbackourgirls. That didn’t bring 
back anybody. 
But then I secretly met with dozens 
of the mothers of girls who were kid-
napped and were enslaved and being 
raped, that was a very emotional 
evening. But I asked their pastor pri-
vately, I said: ‘‘Where are all of the fa-
thers?’’ 
And he said: ‘‘That is part of all of 
this tragedy. The fathers know their 
daughters are being raped daily. They 
don’t feel like they should be sleeping 
in a bed comfortable when they were 
not able to protect their daughters.’’ 
So they have gone to the bush, jungle, 
rainforest, whatever you want to call 
it, and they are living out there and 
many have already died out there. 
There was a quote from a Catholic 
bishop and I was told when I was over 
there: ‘‘Yeah, the Obama administra-
tion is saying that if you want some 
real help with Boko Haram’’—not just 
a hashtag—‘‘but you want some real 
help that will make a difference and 
stop Boko Haram, you have got to do a 
couple of things. You have got to legal-
ize same-sex marriage, and you have 
got to start funding abortions, and 
then we will be able to be of more help 
to you.’’ 
Of course, that kind of reminds you 
of asking Ukraine to help with the in-
vestigations into corruption. 
But, anyway, President Obama obvi-
ously wasn’t impeached and nor did 
anybody that I am aware of think we 
should have tried to impeach him be-
cause he wasn’t helping these Christian 
girls the way we could have by helping 
take out Boko Haram, even with drone 
strikes, or more. 
I understand there was some intel-
ligence provided to the Nigerians, but 
according to the people I met with, 
they weren’t getting the help because 
they weren’t going to change their 
laws to adopt same-sex marriage or le-
galize abortion. 
But what a tragedy. And I don’t 
know, maybe people, some of the ones 
that didn’t stand and applaud for that 
couple that has endured so much, 
maybe it was that they didn’t want to 
applaud 
because 
al-Baghdadi 
was 
killed, even though he was responsible 
for the killing of so many Americans, 
so many Christians, so many Jews, and 
actually, Muslims as well. 
Maybe they did not approve of a ter-
rorist thug like al-Baghdadi being 
killed. And I know President Obama 
had said that ISIS is not true Islam. 
Well, it was a radical form of Islam. Al- 
Baghdadi had a Ph.D. in Islam, so I al-
ways kind of felt like he at least knew 
something about Islam, perhaps more 
than people who did not have a Ph.D. 
in Islamic studies. 
I was very grateful that President 
Trump took the actions he did to 
eliminate the person who could do the 
kind of things that he did to Carl and 
Marsha Mueller’s daughter. But, again, 
I would have thought that we could 
have celebrated the taking out of just 
a thug, an enemy combatant, a person 
who wanted to see America destroyed, 
that we might have had more commu-
nity, or camaraderie in relieving the 
world of somebody that did so much 
damage to people in it. 
We had Deputy Chief Raul Ortiz. I 
mean, the guy is a hero. I have met 
him before. It was good to see him 
here. He is with the U.S. Border Patrol. 
He joined them in 1991. He had served 
in the United States Army, and he has 
got a lot of responsibility down on the 
border trying to protect our country, 
because there are people trying to 
come in with drugs, that are killing 
Americans, they are enslaving Ameri-
cans, or people who don’t like us. 
Fortunately, the majority of people 
coming in, they do like America and 
want to live here, but we can’t know 
who wants to help and who wants to 
hurt unless we have a secure border 
and can control who comes in. 
Tony Rankins from Cincinnati, Ohio, 
had suffered from PTSD, post-trau-
matic stress disorder. He had become 
addicted to drugs. Anyway, Tony’s 
story kind of reminded me of a friend 
from Texas, Curtis Brown, who is a 
Christian and who has been able to 
conquer some of these same demons, is 
doing great in helping others. 
So I have great appreciation for Tony 
Rankins and what he has overcome. 
And now the company he started, R In-
vestments, today he is working in an 
opportunity zone in Cincinnati, but the 
new job has helped him overcome his 
drug addiction. 
But there is more that has to be done 
to keep someone from falling back into 
drugs. It is a daily battle, and people 
should be applauded for being able to 
do that. I regret that we didn’t have 
more stimulating applause and rec-
ognition. 
Robin and Ellie Schneider—Ellie was 
the one born at 21 weeks and 6 days, 
one of the youngest babies to survive 
in America at the time. It is an amaz-
ing story. How could you not applaud 
that little child in her mother’s arms. 
It was very touching, very moving. 
It wasn’t a lie. These weren’t lies. 
These were real American stories that, 
again, should have made us all laugh, 
all cry, and all cheer over the good 
things. 
Ivan Simonovis from Caracas, Ven-
ezuela, he was the chief of police there 
in Venezuela’s capital city. He was es-
teemed as the nation’s top cop. But he 
was imprisoned in 2004 for protecting 
protesters. He was held in captivity for 
nearly 15 years by Chavez and the 
Maduro regimes, but he escaped in 2019, 
got to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and 
was welcomed in the United States. 
That ought to be a story we could all 
cheer for on both sides of the aisle. 
That is a good thing. 
I regret we were not even more laud-
atory for a guy who had overcome all 
of that. I guess for some people, if you 
applaud his escaping Venezuela in the 
Chavez and Maduro era, maybe it was 
thought that applauding that might be 
some recognition of just how brutal so-
cialism, 
progressivism, 
and 
com-
munism becomes. 
Natan Sharansky, it was my privi-
lege to have a long conversation with 
him and Sheldon and Miriam Adelson 
years ago. The guy is brilliant. He 
served 12 years, though, in a Russian

gulag because he wanted freedom of 
speech. 
As Natan points out, you have fear 
societies and you have free societies, 
and you can test which you are in. Are 
you free to say absolutely anything 
you want to in the town square with-
out fear of harm or arrest? If you are 
able to do that, you are in a free soci-
ety. 
And, unfortunately, for Natan, he 
was in a fear society. And that is where 
communist systems go. They don’t feel 
they can allow widespread Christi-
anity. They suppress. They keep people 
in fear. 
It is amazing, too, as I have traveled 
around the United States, it seems like 
some of our best citizens who under-
stand the threats against America, 
they are from the former Soviet bloc 
countries, and they say: We are hearing 
all of this great stuff about socialism. 
We heard all of that before, and we 
know that it leads to a loss of freedom. 
It leads to our lives being dictated by 
people above. It leads to the loss of pa-
rental rights because the government 
is going to tell you what you are al-
lowed to talk to your children about. 
I was shocked to find out years ago 
that in the Soviet Union, they made 
very clear—I heard the presentation— 
that these children do not belong to 
the parents. The parents are temporary 
caretakers. And if they ever found out 
that a parent has ever said anything 
negative about the Soviet Union, the 
Soviet Government, those children will 
be removed and they will be put in the 
hands of other temporary caretakers 
who the government likes and who will 
not say anything negative about their 
government. 
That is, as Sharansky would say, a 
fear society. And I fear we have moved 
in that direction dramatically. 
Joshua Smith from Paducah, Ken-
tucky was up here. His 16-year-old 
brother, Channing, committed suicide 
last September in Tennessee. He had 
suffered from cyber assault on social 
media by students in his high school. 
Joshua described Channing as ‘‘the 
sweetest kid on Earth’’ who loved play-
ing musical instruments. But he was 
bullied, cyberbullied. 
The 
Williams 
family 
from 
Fort 
Bragg, that was so touching. And I was 
surprised. How could you not cheer this 
father coming back into the lives of his 
wife and two children? I mean, most of 
us were moved to tears. Some were not. 
I don’t really understand how every-
body was not totally moved by what 
went on there. 
Anyway, I was pleased that the ma-
jority leader clarified the Speaker’s 
comments about those being, as she 
said, no connection with reality, a 
pack of lies, selling a bill of goods like 
a snake oil salesman. 
I was glad he clarified that she 
wasn’t really talking about all of those 
human-interest stories, and things that 
should have brought us together. But 
unfortunately, they didn’t, as they 
should have. 
b 1345 
For those who love justice, I am 
hopeful that now that this 3-year pur-
suit of impeachment is behind us, now 
we are told: Oh, that is just the begin-
ning. We are not stopping impeach-
ment. We are going to keep going for-
ward. 
A court was told: Oh, yeah, we are 
going to keep going forward with im-
peachment. We are not done. We are 
going to keep trying to find something. 
Really, this kind of sounds like basi-
cally, since it has been made very clear 
as of this week the Senate is not going 
to buy into some bogus group of allega-
tions that are not impeachable of-
fenses, which makes clear, then, you 
are pursuing it, apparently using tax-
payer dollars, to try to besmirch a can-
didate for November 2020, to try to de-
feat him by using taxpayer dollars to 
make all kinds of allegations that you 
know will not result in removal from 
office but you are hoping will result in 
his defeat in November. 
It is amazing the effect President 
Trump has on people. You can call it 
Trump 
derangement 
syndrome 
or 
whatever, but for so long as we have 
had deep state people, they felt like, as 
unelected bureaucrats, they were sup-
posed to be in charge. It appeared pret-
ty clear to me Lieutenant Colonel 
Vindman was offended. You could tell 
by his body language and the things he 
said. He was really bothered that Presi-
dent Trump didn’t do exactly what he 
told him to do in his talking points. 
How dare the elected President of the 
United States who embodies foreign 
policy—President Obama, agree or dis-
agree, when he was President, as he 
had said before, elections have con-
sequences. So many of us disagreed 
with his foreign policy. He was Presi-
dent. He could have whatever foreign 
policy he cared to pursue. 
But you have people like Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman who didn’t think that 
President Trump should do what he 
felt appropriate. He felt he should do 
what 
Lieutenant 
Colonel 
Vindman 
thought was appropriate. After all, he 
saw himself as the be-all and end-all 
resource on all things to do with 
Ukraine. From the things we found out 
he said to the Ukrainian leaders, it 
struck me from his testimony, my 
gosh, he is being more loyal to Ukraine 
and the Ukrainian President than he is 
to his own oath of office and his own 
Commander in Chief. He is advising 
them not to listen to his Commander 
in Chief, which is totally consistent 
with his activity in Moscow, appar-
ently, when he was overheard belittling 
America and doing so to Russians. 
Anyway, hopefully, he won’t be there 
much longer. But just think about it: If 
we hadn’t gone through impeachment, 
then we wouldn’t have known about all 
these people who are unelected bureau-
crats who thought they ought to be in 
charge of everything. 
So looking for a silver lining, I think 
there is a great silver lining because 
these people have now raised their 
heads and made themselves known that 
they think, as bureaucrats, they should 
run everything, and they will do every-
thing they can to undermine the Presi-
dent of the United States. Now we 
know who they are so we can start get-
ting rid of those people. That will be a 
good thing for the country. 
We had Christopher Wray, the Direc-
tor of the FBI, before our Judiciary 
Committee this week. I was hoping 
when he was appointed Director of the 
FBI that he would come in and would 
clean house here in Washington, and he 
would help restore the FBI’s sterling 
reputation that it had built over time. 
It seemed that he had a habit, though, 
if you pointed out problems in the 
Washington FBI office, he would defend 
by saying: You are basically casting as-
persions on these 37,000 fine employees 
of the FBI. 
That is why I had to make clear to 
him this week that we are not casting 
any aspersions on anybody around the 
country who are part of the FBI be-
cause I have known too many FBI 
agents. I still do. I know, as a felony 
judge, they would never have come and 
lied to me in seeking a warrant. They 
would never have created an untruthful 
document by changing information, 
like we are told Clinesmith did. I still 
have some concern they may make him 
the one fall guy. 
In my opinion, if you seek to get a 
warrant to spy on a Presidential cam-
paign that you don’t want to win, Mr. 
Speaker, and you take information 
that says that Carter Page was an 
agent for our intelligence sources and 
spying on Russia, and you change that 
to say he was not so it helps you get a 
warrant to spy on a campaign you 
don’t like, to me, he ought to be in jail 
for committing a fraud upon the FISA 
court. I think he ought to be in jail for 
any other crimes that were committed 
in the process of seeking to provide 
false information to violate American 
citizens’ civil rights. I hope Carter 
Page is very successful in his legal ef-
forts. 
Instead, we find out, the one guy I 
thought, oh, well, they will make him 
the fall guy, when there are a lot of 
people who probably should be going to 
jail. 
But under Christopher Wray’s leader-
ship, what have they done to Mr. 
Clinesmith? They let him resign, retire 
early, go get employment elsewhere, 
and make a good living somewhere 
else. Really? 
As I said to Christopher Wray: You 
are in law enforcement. You have to 
know how important deterrence is, and 
when somebody does acts like he did, 
in essence, there is no punishment. 
It is just one of many things that 
seems to indicate to me that Chris-
topher Wray thinks the way to get the 
FBI’s reputation back is to cover up 
much of the problem, not punish peo-
ple. They need to be punished publicly 
so that it is a deterrence to any other 
FBI agents who might be tempted to 
act similarly as Clinesmith or Comey

or McCabe or Strzok. These are people 
who ought to be required to answer for 
their wrongdoing. 
Yes, I still have significant problems 
with Inspector General Horowitz. He 
did a lot of investigation, but it is very 
clear that Strzok and Page had tre-
mendous bias. 
His original report, in effect, said 
there is no indication that it affected 
the outcomes. How about the fact that 
every outcome was consistent with 
their bias? Not one single outcome was 
inconsistent with their bias for Hillary 
Clinton and their hatred for Donald 
Trump. When it is 100 percent con-
sistent, then it means it is time to do 
something. Christopher Wray needs to 
go, too. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
f 
MODERNIZING ENTITLEMENTS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman 
from 
Arizona 
(Mr. 
SCHWEIKERT) for 30 minutes. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, my 
family accuses me of being incapable of 
speaking without moving my hands or 
without displays, so we are going to see 
if we can do a little bit of both that we 
are good at. 
Mr. Speaker, about every week, I try 
to take a block of time and come here 
to walk through both what I see hap-
pening math-wise and what I see hap-
pening demographic-wise. I know as 
soon as I use those words, most anyone 
who is watching this is now falling 
asleep. But the math is important. 
I put this board up because I am a be-
liever that there is a way to save the 
country from being buried in debt. 
There is a way that the next 30, 40 
years can be incredibly prosperous, but 
we need to invest in this magic device, 
which is called a calculator, because 
much of what we do here is rhetorical. 
We do policy by feelings, and we en-
gage in just absolute absurdity in our 
unwillingness to talk about the reality 
of what is going on. 
So, first, a bit of premise, and then 
we will do a little bit of what happened 
in today’s job report to demonstrate 
there is a path, but that path doesn’t 
exist until we start to be honest with 
each other. 
So just a top-line understanding, the 
next 5 years, just the growth in Social 
Security and Medicare—it is mostly 
Medicare—and 
healthcare 
entitle-
ments, just the growth equals the en-
tire Defense Department. 
Mr. Speaker, you have to understand 
what is happening. It is not Republican 
or Democrat. It is demographics. There 
are 74 million of us who are baby 
boomers, and we are moving into our 
retirement years. We have earned bene-
fits, and there is no money in the bank. 
It is all going to be borrowed. 
So think of that: Over the next 10 
years, just the growth of Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, and healthcare entitle-
ments is the entire discretionary budg-
et. Everything else is on autopilot. 
Yet how many of our brothers and 
sisters who are elected, and who have 
this incredible opportunity and respon-
sibility to come tell the truth, are 
comfortable coming behind this micro-
phone and saying: Hey, it turns out 
that we are getting old very fast as a 
society. We have stunning numbers of 
promises that we have an obligation to 
keep. And we are unwilling to have the 
honesty of the discussion of what we 
are about to do to our kids in crushing 
them. 
I have a 4-year-old daughter. Doesn’t 
she deserve to have the same opportu-
nities we all have had? 
It turns out there is a path, but we 
need to stop delusional thinking. For-
give me when my brothers and sisters 
on the Republican side say, ‘‘Well, if we 
just got rid of waste and fraud,’’ it is a 
rounding error. It is important, and we 
need to do it. 
‘‘We just have to tax rich people 
more.’’ It is delusional. It is fractions 
of a percent, and you could take all 
their wealth, Mr. Speaker. 
We don’t seem to have our heads 
around the scale of this math and the 
number of zeros that go with it. 
Let’s sort of walk through this. In 
the last couple of years, we have been 
trying to pitch a concept. You can’t 
just do one thing, Mr. Speaker. You 
can’t just change entitlements and 
think you are going to accomplish any-
thing. You can’t just tax people more 
and think you are going to get any-
where. You have to do everything. 
It is sort of the wholistic—I prefer 
the term ‘‘unified’’—theory that we 
have to get the economics working. We 
have to maximize economic growth, 
and we have to maximize labor force 
participation. We need to adopt revolu-
tionary and disruptive technology to 
crash the price of healthcare because, 
as I was just sharing with you, Mr. 
Speaker, healthcare is what drives the 
deficit. 
I was here last week, and I was show-
ing slides that 90 percent of the future 
debt is substantially Social Security 
but mostly Medicare, yet the only calls 
I get when I show that slide is I get 
people angry: Stop telling us that. 
That doesn’t fit the folklore I bathe in. 
But the fact of the matter is, there 
are 
technology 
disruptions 
coming 
right now that could crash the price of 
healthcare and be amazing in changing 
our debt curve. The problem is a bunch 
of that technology is actually illegal 
because it uses algorithms, sensors, 
and things that our current legal 
framework and reimbursement frame-
work isn’t ready for. We need to mod-
ernize. 
b 1400 
Employment, we are going to talk 
about some of the remarkable things 
that came out in today’s unemploy-
ment numbers that should be incred-
ibly hopeful to both those on the left 
and the right of what is happening, 
where our brothers and sisters—what 
we refer to as marginally detached— 
are coming back into the labor force. 
This is a good thing. It makes remark-
able differences. 
You are going to start to see: Do we 
add incentives in the earned and even 
unearned benefits? Remember, in our 
society, the vast majority of our spend-
ing, 70-plus percent, is on autopilot. It 
is what we call entitlements. 
You earned your Social Security. 
You earned your Medicare. You earned 
your VA. You earned these things. 
There are other benefits you get be-
cause you fell below a certain income. 
You are part of a certain Tribal popu-
lation—those things. These are treaty 
obligations. They are societal obliga-
tions we have made decisions on. 
Are there things we can do to add a 
spiff? Saying: Yes, you may be 70 years 
old, you have your earned entitlement, 
but could we give you a little spiff? Are 
you healthy? Do you want to continue 
to work? Do you want to stay in the 
labor force? 
Because it turns out to be really good 
for society. It turns out to be really 
important. 
We still have a problem with millen-
nial men, which is a different speech, 
and one day, we will figure out why 
they are underparticipating. 
Population stability, a really uncom-
fortable part of the conversation to 
have, but the math is the math. Our 
birthrates have collapsed. We are look-
ing at data right now that says half of 
millennials, more than 50 percent of 
millennials, 
will 
never 
marry. 
It 
doesn’t mean they won’t be in long- 
term committed relationships, but are 
there incentives we can produce as a 
government, as a society, that those 
stable relationships bring another gen-
eration? Because it is an honest math 
problem. We are collapsing population- 
wise. 
Immigration, how do you design an 
immigration system that is open, wel-
coming, but is talent-based? Because 
the reality of it is, we are about to hit 
such a demographic headwind if we do 
not have brothers and sisters becoming 
Americans who have certain skill sets. 
In many ways, it is a more elegant 
system. I don’t care about your race, 
your religion, who you cuddle with, all 
of these things. I do care that you add 
velocity to our society, to our econ-
omy. 
Then, there are other things: tax 
policies, regulatory policy, smart tech-
nology, things we can do to maximize 
economic growth. 
Look, our pitch is: If we can make 
these things work—and you can’t do 
one or two of them; you have to do all 
of them—we have a model that says, at 
the peak of the baby boom, so about 15 
years from now, or less than that, we 
kiss up to 95 percent of debt-to-GDP, 
but we can hold it. Then, it fades back 
to something normal. 
If we don’t do this, there are charts 
out there that show a couple hundred 
percent of debt-to-GDP. We blow up the

society. We basically become anemic, 
slow-growth. We raise taxes like crazy 
on young people to make them pay our 
benefits. We become a country that has 
crushed any excitement and hope. 
Let’s talk about the good things, be-
cause there is starting to be some proof 
that when you get tax policy correct, 
regulatory policy correct, some of 
these incentives, good things happen. I 
know in today’s rage-based politics, we 
sit there and attack everything, but 
there are good things happening. 
How do we figure out what makes 
them happen and do more of it? And 
the things that aren’t working, let’s do 
less of them. It is not that com-
plicated. 
Look, today, we got the jobs report. 
The jobs report we get about January 
is really important because they also 
give us a sense—it is not the final num-
ber but the sense of what was hap-
pening in 2019 and those last 4 months. 
Every smart economist we work 
with—I am the senior Republican on 
the House side on something called the 
Joint Economic Committee. It is basi-
cally for all the kids in your high 
school who were president of your 
math club. If you love the data—and I 
happen to be blessed to have a couple 
of economists who work for me in that 
capacity—we were all expecting revi-
sions and some ugly numbers. 
Turns out, a few hours ago, we found 
out that there were 55,000 added in No-
vember and December, the ending parts 
of last year. The economy turns out to 
have been healthier. The employment 
opportunities were healthier. 
You all saw the number for January, 
225,000 jobs, far beyond even the most 
optimistic predictions. There should 
have been joy in this room. Those are 
people who are working, who are com-
ing back in the labor force, who are 
changing their lives. But this place is 
incapable of joy anymore. 
These are really, really good things. 
But there is something even more re-
markable underlying in that data, and 
it is important. I know it is not excit-
ing, but it is really important if you 
care about people. 
First, we work on the premise that 
growth is moral. You are going to see 
some numbers here where our brothers 
and sisters who had basically quit, 
they had stopped trying to find em-
ployment. They had dropped out. We 
called them the marginally detached. 
Those people who might have a small 
part-time job, but they are unhappy. 
They are basically the working poor. 
All of a sudden, we are seeing, in the 
last 24 months, remarkable movement 
in their wages and even more remark-
able movement in their job opportuni-
ties. There is something working out 
there. 
Remember, the first slide we were 
talking about how we have a healthy 
enough economy, a healthy enough ec-
onomics in our society so we can keep 
our promises. This is one of the charts 
that is really important. 
If you all remember your high school 
economics class, what are the two com-
ponents that make wages go up, the 
two things we focus on? Well, one is 
productivity, and the other is inflation. 
When your wages go up, well, infla-
tion is up, so we are going to pay you 
more, even though you have no im-
provement in your purchasing power. 
And inflation-driven wage growth, you 
are typically falling behind. 
The other side—and that is what this 
chart talks about—is productivity. The 
company invested in a new piece of 
equipment, new software, new meth-
odologies, or new supply chains, but it 
requires capital investments. But we 
have gotten more productive, meaning 
we can pay our workers more. 
We were panic-stricken, functionally, 
at the end of 2016. Productivity had 
collapsed. Lots of the smart people 
were saying: Well, you have had the 
tax reform. People did their investing, 
this and that. It is going away. 
Turns out, they were absolutely 
wrong. Look at the last bar. That is 
2019. We have had a spike. Now, I still 
don’t think it is enough, but we are up 
to 
what 
we 
call 
1.7 
productivity 
growth. For an economy our size, that 
is remarkable. We can do better, but it 
is going the right way. 
If we are going to pay our brothers 
and sisters more, if the working poor 
are going to have an opportunity, this 
is crucial. Can we fixate on the things 
that are working in our economy? Be-
cause there is something working now, 
so how do we do more of it? 
This next chart is impossible to read, 
but it is really important. You have 
three layers in here. These are for 
wages, so those folks who are at the 
low end of the scale, middle end of the 
scale, and those folks who are making 
lots of money. 
The remarkable thing that has hap-
pened since tax reform—I know this is 
really hard to see. It turns out, it is the 
working poor, that lowest quartile, 
that is having the most growth in their 
wages, that bottom 10 percent of our 
brothers and sisters that we were writ-
ing off as a society. 
I have been on the Joint Economic 
Committee now for years, and just 3 or 
4 years ago, we brought in these fancy, 
very well-credentialed, really smart 
economists who basically said that 
Americans 
who 
didn’t 
finish 
high 
school, 
Americans 
with 
moderate 
skills, they are part of the permanent 
underclass. Start thinking of ways to 
provide them subsidies, welfare, hous-
ing, because they are going to stay 
there. 
The velocity, the concept that you 
can start out poor today, learn a skill, 
work hard, and move up, they basically 
said was over. They are wrong. And 
this isn’t Republican or Democrat. 
This is hope. This is what America is 
supposed to be about, that those folks 
come back. 
You may not have had the oppor-
tunity to have great skill training. 
Maybe something horrible happened in 
your life, you dropped out of high 
school. Three years ago, we were writ-
ing you off. Today, you have double, 
more than double, the wage growth of 
everyone else and the mean in this so-
ciety. 
I know this is geeky, but it is really 
important. These numbers are millions 
and millions and millions of our broth-
ers and sisters out there who had a 
really crappy decade. All of a sudden, 
something 
is 
happening 
out 
there 
where their wages are growing. The job 
stability, the value of their labor, it 
may be the most elegant way to say 
it—and some of this is complex. And 
this is an uncomfortable part of the 
conversation. Forgive me if I am not as 
eloquent on this as I would like to be. 
For low-skilled populations, it is a 
combination of a robust enough econ-
omy to have a need for those skills or 
lack of skills. But there is a need for 
that labor. The other side is, you are 
not flooding your society with a type 
of immigration that puts so much low- 
skilled population in the society that 
you crush the working poor. 
So think of a little bit of a seesaw. 
You have to do both to get the value of 
that working poor population, to make 
their labor valuable. It is happening. 
That should be joyful. Now, we should 
figure out how to do more of it, how to 
keep this going, because it is working. 
Now, here is the one where I may 
take us a little bit to a level of com-
plexity in the thinking, but it is really 
important. When we did tax reform a 
couple of years ago, the Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation folks—they are all 
freaky smart. There is like 50 of them. 
A number have Ph.D.’s in econometrics 
and all these things. 
They came to us and said: David, 
there are two fragilities in tax reform 
for the economy to grow. It is capital 
stock, available cash to be lent for 
businesses, 
for 
organizations, 
for 
things to grow, to buy that new piece 
of equipment for that labor produc-
tivity. The other thing was labor itself. 
We are getting old very fast as a soci-
ety. There are some charts out there 
that say, within the decade, we func-
tionally have two workers for one per-
son in retirement. It is not Republican 
or Democrat. It is those of us who are 
baby boomers. It is what it is. 
Something has started to happen in 
the last 2 years, and we saw a pop of it 
in this January data. Think about this. 
This over here is sort of that 2008, 2009, 
and we were at 67 percent labor force 
participation. Now, labor force partici-
pation basically means everyone in so-
ciety less those people who are under 
16. So those who are eligible to work, 
up and to, I believe, being much older. 
Now, this number was always sup-
posed to crash because we are getting 
older as a society. But it was supposed 
to continue to just dive down because 
we are only halfway through the retire-
ment of the baby boomers. 
All a sudden, in the last couple years, 
we have broken the trendline. All of a 
sudden, today, we saw we are up to 63.4 
percent labor force participation. Most 
people glaze over and go: What the hell 
does that mean?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H974 
February 7, 2020 
Well, it means it is a number that 
those smart economists a couple years 
ago were telling us we would never get 
to, but somehow it has happened. We 
are functionally living in a time when 
we are going to be rewriting textbooks. 
But what is also remarkable—and 
you are going to see this in one of the 
other charts here—is those who are 
coming back, they are starting to look 
for unemployment. 
So how do you have this weird num-
ber today? There are 225,000 people who 
moved into the labor force, or took 
jobs in January, but unemployment ac-
tually ticked up one-tenth of a point. 
But the labor force participation, the 
number in the labor force, also goes up 
two-tenths of a point. That is actually 
wonderful. 
What it means is that people who had 
given up, who weren’t looking, hadn’t 
looked in the last 4 weeks, in the last 
year, they had functionally given up, 
almost a couple hundred thousand, 
maybe 170,000 or so, came back and 
started looking, coming back into our 
society’s labor force. 
This is really important because 
there is just that societal concept of 
you are less likely to be using bad 
things if you are working. You are 
more likely to be able to start having 
a functioning family, maybe even fam-
ily formation, if you are working. Your 
future, your optimism, your health are 
better if you are working. 
All of a sudden, we are starting to see 
populations that those fancy econo-
mists were writing off just a couple 
years ago. They are coming back. 
b 1415 
This is moral, but it is also really 
good. Why does it become partisan, 
saying: Well, it is not as good as it 
should be? It is a remarkable break of 
every trend line we had. 
You would think we would have this 
honorable conversation, saying: Let’s 
understand what is working and do 
more of it because, if we can do this for 
a few more years, another decade, that 
economic trend line starts to change 
remarkably. 
And I will try to make that make 
sense. 
So last August, CBO did debt projec-
tions. We just got another one last 
week. Did anyone come behind these 
microphones—well, 
I 
did—and 
say: 
Hey, did anyone notice that the 10-year 
window of debt actually went down $705 
billion? 
It turns out, if you dive into that, 
some of that was payrolls. There are a 
lot more people working. They are pay-
ing a lot more payroll tax. That is won-
derful. 
There is another thing that is actu-
ally a little more complex to get your 
head around: interest rates. We expect 
the cost of financing the deficits of the 
U.S. Government to also came down 
about $400 billion. 
But there is an argument that the 
tax reform—remember how we said 
what were the two fragilities, labor and 
capital stock? It turns out that thing 
called capital stock is remarkably bet-
ter than anyone had modeled. 
We did something in the tax reform 
to stop businesses from moving their 
domiciles overseas, taking their profits 
and booking them overseas, keeping 
that capital overseas. We changed that. 
We have had a remarkable amount of 
that, billions and billions, I mean, a 
few hundred billion dollars come crash-
ing back to the United States, where 
they have to pay some taxes here on it, 
but that cash is now in our society. 
It turns out also savings rates have 
turned out to be much better than we 
modeled. 
So just that and the fact that more 
people are working is about a $705 bil-
lion reduction in the deficit. In that 
one period between August and last 
week when we got the CBO report—and 
remember, the cost of tax reform we 
thought would be about $1.4 trillion. 
We just covered about half of it. So it 
is just an interesting thought on what 
is going on. 
This is the remarkable chart. This is 
the one we need to get our heads 
around. So think about this. 
It is January 2009, January 2010. How 
many of you remember people getting 
behind microphones and talking about 
the real unemployment rate? Do you 
remember 
the 
real 
unemployment 
rate? It is not these people who are out 
looking. It is all the people. It is the 
worn-out workers. Those people have 
quit. We had numbers where it was ap-
proaching 17.6, 17.5 percent of our Na-
tion was part of the real unemploy-
ment. 
Take a look at what has happened. 
This is remarkable. We are now start-
ing to see numbers that were 6.7 per-
cent of the—this is people who are 
looking, not looking, who have worn 
out, who have given up. It has been cut 
substantially, more than half. 
And we are at this point where we 
have been having this amazing aca-
demic debate, conversation: What is 
real unemployment? Not only that, 
what is full employment? How much— 
and I was told never to use this word 
behind the microphone—but this con-
cept of elasticity. How many of our 
brothers and sisters are actually avail-
able to come back into the labor force? 
It turns out there is a miracle hap-
pening out there. Every month, we will 
tell you: Oh, 150,000 or, in this case, 
225,000 took jobs, because it is not part 
of the way they calculate. We are not 
telling you: Hey, there may have been 
another couple hundred thousand who 
moved back into the labor force who 
weren’t even looking, so we don’t count 
them. 
They deserve to be counted, and they 
are counted in this data here. They are 
what they call the U–6 unemployment. 
If we could keep this going for a few 
more years, we are already breaking 
the rules in almost every textbook, but 
this becomes remarkably important. 
For my brothers and sisters on the 
left, my brothers and sisters on the 
right, we get elected to do our best to 
make people’s lives better and protect 
the Constitution, defend the Constitu-
tion. If you don’t see this as making 
Americans’ lives better, you don’t un-
derstand, you don’t own a calculator, 
or you don’t have a heart. 
I get behind here and I talk about the 
math, but this math is people. It is 
families. It is folks who are being 
crushed in the last decade who now ac-
tually have hope. 
Why isn’t there some joy? Why do we 
have to live in a time where rage is the 
commodity of politics and not joy for 
the success we are having for so many 
people who are part of the working 
poor that now have hope, now have fu-
tures? It is working. 
And the other thing that is also 
somewhat joyful, you see the red bar, 
that is real GDP. 
You have got to understand, if we 
were going back to around ‘16, even 
when we calculated the year ‘17, how 
much of our GDP was also being 
dragged along, helped, assisted by the 
rest of the world? Now, when you look 
at what is going on, we have had a re-
markable level of stability, but we are 
dragging the rest of the world with us 
because the rest of the world is basi-
cally an anemic mess right now. 
And, yes, next month I expect some 
ugly things in some of the numbers be-
cause of the virus and what it has done 
to trade. There may be an upside in an 
odd way where many manufacturers, 
businesses, will consider moving their 
supply chains, making them less frag-
ile, less concentrated, which will be 
great for us as a country because we 
have just now had USMCA, the NAFTA 
replacement, pass, so now, all of a sud-
den will you think about moving part 
of your manufacturing back to North 
America. 
But this is actually a really inter-
esting chart to understand. Even in a 
time where the rest of the world’s eco-
nomic growth has been collapsing, we 
are still doing remarkably well. 
And I was going to come up here and 
show you the formulas of, hey, a point 
of GDP in the EU means this much to 
us. But just understand, we had some 
help 3 or 4 years ago. Now we are the 
ones helping the rest of the world. 
Now, back to that being remarkable, 
and this is sort of the closing on the 
concept that growth is moral. But 
there also should be joy. 
Those who come behind these micro-
phones and say, ‘‘We care about peo-
ple,’’ ‘‘We care about the workers,’’ 
‘‘We care about the working poor,’’ 
‘‘We want society to continue to ex-
pand and be healthy,’’ take a look at 
the chart on my side. If you see blue, it 
is the previous 8 years. If you see the 
red, it is a function of the last 3 years. 
Do you know which bar is the highest 
and has the biggest separation? Who 
has had the biggest growth in earnings 
on this chart? Turns out it is the bot-
tom workers in our country. 
If you care about our brothers and 
sisters who have been struggling for so

February 7, 2020 
many years, this should be joyful, be-
cause something amazing is happening 
out there. 
Now everyone is doing better—well, 
except high-wage managers. They are 
basically static. If you come over here 
and actually look at the top income, 
they are doing fine, but the bottom is 
the remarkable change. 
This is really important, because for 
so many years, I would listen to my 
friends on the left come behind these 
microphones and talk about income in-
equality. It is a real thing. But what 
happens when you have made more 
progress, particularly in the last 12 
months, of closing that gap of income 
inequality 
not 
because 
you 
have 
crushed those with high skills, those 
with high wages, but because you have 
brought up so much of our society, you 
have grown their wages remarkably? 
This needs to be our goal. Our goal as 
a society must be to lift everyone up, 
not figure out that one quartile you 
have identified as the enemy and go 
out and decide you are going to crush 
them. That is what our modern politics 
has become. 
Back to the first slide again. 
Over the next 30 years, if you look at 
the math of what is coming at us, if 
you actually strip Social Security and 
Medicare out of the next 30 years and 
say, ‘‘What do we look like 30 years 
from now?’’—so my little girl, when 
she is 34 years old, what does the Fed-
eral budget look like as we see it 
today? It is about $23 trillion. If we 
don’t add Social Security and Medicare 
into the number, it is about $23 trillion 
cash in the bank. Now, that is not in-
flation adjusted, but $23 trillion cash in 
the bank. 
If we put Social Security and Medi-
care back into that 30-year window, my 
little girl and every other young per-
son, every other person who thinks 
they are still going to be around in 30 
years, we are $103 trillion in debt. 
It doesn’t have to be that way, but 
we have got to crush the price of 
healthcare with technology. We have 
got to have people in the economy who 
are helping it grow. We need the pro-
ductivity. We can have a remarkable 
future. 
But the intellectual capacity of the 
debates we are having around here, we 
have functionally gone a year and done 
nothing, nothing that actually helps 
America, but we have done some great 
messaging bills and great politics and 
great grandstanding and pretty good 
speeches. 
We can do better, and there is a path. 
Mr. Speaker, thank you for your pa-
tience. I yield back the balance of my 
time.

CORRECTION 
TO 
THE 
CONGRES-
SIONAL RECORD OF THURSDAY, 
FEBRUARY 6, 2020 AT PAGE H868 
Ms. GRANGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to offer a question of the privileges 
of the House previously noticed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). The Clerk will report the 
resolution. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
H. RES. 832 
Whereas, on December 20, 2019, Speaker 
Pelosi extended an invitation for President 
Trump to address a joint session of Congress 
on February 4, 2020; 
Whereas, on February 4, 2020, President 
Trump delivered his State of the Union ad-
dress, in which he honored the sacrifice of 
the following American heroes and their 
families: 
General Charles McGee, one of the last sur-
viving Tuskegee Airmen, who served in 
World War II, the Korean War, and the Viet-
nam War; 
Kayla Mueller, a humanitarian aid worker 
who was caring for suffering civilians in 
Syria when she was kidnapped, tortured and 
enslaved by ISIS for over 500 days before 
being murdered by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al- 
Baghdadi; 
Anny Staff Sergeant Christopher Hake, 
who was killed while serving his second tour 
of duty in Iraq by a roadside bomb supplied

and 
Sergeant First Class Townsend Williams, 
who is currently serving his fourth deploy-
ment in the Middle East and his wife Amy, 
who works full time for the Army and de-
votes hundreds of hours helping military 
families; 
Whereas immediately following the ad-
dress, while still presiding over the joint ses-
sion, Speaker Pelosi ripped up an official 
copy of the President’s remarks, which con-
tained the names and stories of these patri-
ots who sacrificed so much for our country; 
and 
Whereas the conduct of Speaker Pelosi was 
a breach of decorum and degraded the pro-
ceedings of the joint session, to the discredit 
of the House: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives disapproves of the behavior of Speaker 
Pelosi during the joint session of Congress

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
SISTER MARGARET CLAYDON 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I rise to pay 
tribute to Sister Margaret Claydon, who served 
as President of Trinity Washington University 
(then Trinity College), my alma mater. Sister 
Margaret was a beloved pillar of the Trinity 
community, a revolutionary who transformed 
women’s education in America and a role 
model for thousands of young women and me. 
Sister Margaret dedicated her life to Trinity. 
She enrolled at Trinity as a freshman in the 
fall of 1941, entered the Sisters of Notre 
Dame de Namur (SNDdeN) in 1946 and 
taught Latin at several SNDdeN high schools 
before returning to Trinity in the English De-
partment in 1952. She served as Trinity’s 
president from 1959 to 1975, becoming one of 
the youngest college presidents in the country, 
and then served as a professor of English until 
her retirement in 2004. She continued to live 
in the SNDdeN community at Trinity until mov-
ing to Mount Notre Dame in Cincinnati in 
2015. 
Sister Margaret Claydon was an exemplar 
of the ideal Trinity Woman: a leader of pene-
trating intellect, firm faith and inquiring mind, 
whose keen sense of purpose and courage to 
question the status quo was an inspiration to 
all who walked through our school’s halls. For 
the women in my class and me, Sister Mar-
garet, with her youth, sophistication and suc-
cess, was a symbol of strength and empower-
ment, whose leadership was a reminder that 
women could become not only a Secretary or 
Treasurer, but a President—or the Speaker of 
the House. 
Sister Margaret’s leadership of Trinity was 
transformational. During an era of great up-
heaval on campuses and in communities 
across America, she boldly led Trinity into the 
future: revitalizing and modernizing the cur-
riculum, leading the conversion of governance 
to the lay board and securing a Phi Beta 
Kappa Chapter for Trinity, all while holding 
firm to Trinity’s proud heritage as an all wom-
en’s Catholic institution. The excellence of her 
leadership was recognized in her being named 
to many of the great boards of higher edu-
cation and her serving as the only woman on 
a significant delegation of presidents of Catho-
lic colleges to the Vatican in the late 1960s. 
Speaking before the National Catholic Edu-
cational Association fifty years ago, Sister 
Margaret declared, ‘‘We have to be willing to 
acquaint our students with controversy and 
problematic knowledge. The emphasis cannot 
be only on the assemblage and mastery of 
facts, but must be on how to make sense of 
them in relation to the whole human condition 
. . . For the times in which we live, rigidity or 
timidity have no place. These times, these 
problems cry out for courage, for openness.’’ 
May Sister Margaret’s lifetime of coura-
geous leadership to educate and empower 
women to seek the truth and pursue progress 
for all continue to be a blessing to our commu-
nity. And may it be a comfort to the Trinity 
community, the Sisters of Notre Dame de 
Namur, her family and all who knew and loved 
Sister Margaret that so many mourn their loss 
and pray for them during this sad time.

COMMEMORATING THE LIFE OF 
LINA FAT 
HON. AMI BERA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. BERA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
commemorate the life of Lina Fat. 
Born in Hong Kong, Lina moved to the 
United States to attend college in Tennessee. 
She eventually graduated from the University 
of California, San Francisco School of Phar-
macy. She married Ken Fat in 1940 and 
worked as a pharmacist. 
Lina then made a career change and stud-
ied at the Culinary Institute of America, Le 
Cordon Bleu, and the Dickson Culinary 
School. In 1974, the Fat Family opened China 
Camp in Old Sacramento, which celebrated 
the Chinese connection to the Gold Rush. It 
was Lina’s idea to base the menu on grilled 
meats and she became the chef of China 
Camp. Eventually, she became the Fat Family 
Restaurant Group’s executive corporate chef 
and later the vice president of culinary re-
search and development. 
In 2000, Lina was named businesswoman 
of the year by the Sacramento Metropolitan 
Chamber of Commerce. In 2007 she launched 
the Sacramento World Music and Dance Fes-
tival. Lina and her family also were generous 
supporters of the Asian American community 
and other civic efforts. 
I am pleased that the Sacramento Asian Pa-
cific Chamber of Commerce will honor Lina’s 
legacy by renaming its ‘‘Small Business of the 
Year Award’’ to the ‘‘Fat Family Legacy 
Award.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I invite my colleagues to 
join me in remembering Lina’s life and her 
contributions to our community in Sacramento.

HONORING THE SERVICE OF MS. 
TERRY ROWE 
HON. ZOE LOFGREN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate and offer gratitude to Ms. Terry 
Rowe who dedicated over 40 years of out-
standing service to the House of Representa-
tives. Terry started her career at the House as 
the Junior Secretary for the Member Services 
Division of House Information Systems; and 
her final years of service included her time as 
the Director of House Graphics Studio and the 
Art Director of House Creative Services. 
For many years, Terry led House Graphics 
and served the entire House community by 
providing excellent consultation and design 
services. Terry’s colleagues at the CAO and 
the 
countless 
Congressional 
offices 
she 
worked with over the course of her four-dec-
ade career not only praised her insight and 
talents, but also commended her for her hard 
work, dedication, professionalism, and con-
tributions, day-in and day-out, to strengthen 
and protect the institution of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. 
In the aftermath of September 11, 2001 and 
the subsequent anthrax attack on Capitol Hill, 
Terry was a steady voice of institutional knowl-
edge, and a ‘‘can do’’ spirit for an impromptu 
communications team that supported the CAO 
operations. She served as the liaison with the 
Government Printing Office and took care of 
the preparation and printing of all materials 
needed to support the House community 
through this very difficult time. Her ability to 
create partnerships and solutions enabled oth-
ers on the team to effectively complete their 
tasks without un-do stress. All required mate-
rials would be ready for the House Executive 
Committee the following morning. 
During her service to the House, she pro-
vided the highest quality graphic design and 
artistic work to Members, Committees, Leader-
ship, and support offices. Her work directly 
contributed to the House of Representatives 
carrying out the people’s work by enabling 
Members to use high-quality visual aides to 
support their communications. Many counted 
on this service for effective, quality products 
that help to brand and market their services. 
Terry never said ‘‘no’’ to a service request and 
always delivered on time and with her famous 
smile. For those who have known Terry 
throughout her career on the Hill, it has been 
an honor to serve with her. 
After 40 years of service, Ms. Rowe will 
leave the House better than when she joined 
it, and her helping hand will be missed by 
many.

HONORING THE LIFE AND CON-
TRIBUTIONS 
OF 
JACK 
CREIGHTON 
HON. DENNY HECK 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, my heart is at 
half-mast after the passing of a business lead-
er from my home state, Jack Creighton. He 
was a beloved husband, father, and grand-
father. He was also a mentor and a friend. 
Jack had an impressive resume. President 
and CEO of Weyerhaeuser, Interim Chairman 
and CEO of United Airlines, national president 
of the Boy Scouts of America, Civilian Aide to 
the Secretary of the Army—those are just a 
few of the highlights. If I were to list all his ca-
reer accomplishments, board memberships,

foundation 
involvements, 
and 
community 
projects, that list would take up more space in 
the RECORD than I am permitted. 
But those who knew Jack—as I was so for-
tunate to have—understand that there was so 
much more to him than his resume. Simply 
reading through his list of accomplishments, 
impressive as it is, misses the essence of 
Jack’s contributions to our society and the 
many people whose lives have been enriched 
and improved because of him. I am one such 
person. 
Several years before I first ran for Con-
gress, I co-founded a company that provides 
professional learning and training services to 
Fortune 500 companies. As the company 
grew, Jack became the chairman of the board. 
I had ongoing involvement in the management 
and operations of the business, as I was also 
a board member. The truth is that I learned 
much more than I contributed. Sitting next to 
Jack every meeting was like going to graduate 
school for business. 
But beyond his vast knowledge and busi-
ness acumen, Jack brought something else to 
our board meetings, something that has 
stayed with me ever since, something I hope 
to emulate: his compassion. Jack cared deep-
ly for the employees of the company and al-
ways looked out for their interests. ‘‘We have 
to take care of our people,’’ he frequently said. 
To Jack, a successful business wasn’t meas-
ured merely by impressive numbers on a bal-
ance sheet; it was about the people. The most 
effective way to invest in the success of a 
company was to invest in the success of the 
people who comprise it. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House join 
me in honoring the life and contributions of 
Jack Creighton, and in sending condolences 
to his wife, Dr. Jan Creighton, and the entire 
Creighton family. I will remember Jack as a 
teacher, a mentor, and a friend. Knowing him 
has made me a better person. While he is no 
longer with us, his example remains and will 
continue to inspire those who knew him, be-
cause Jack knew that a successful life is not 
measured merely by impressive lines on a re-
sume. It is about the people. And the most ef-
fective way to make the world a better place 
is to invest in the success of the people who 
comprise it.

HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the Navy Junior Reserves Offi-
cers Training Corps (NJROTC) program at 
Calexico High School. This is the only 
NJROTC program in the Imperial Valley, CA. 
Calexico High School established a Navy 
National Defense Cadet Corp (NNDCC) pro-
gram in August of 2016. The establishment of 
a NNDCC program at Calexico High School 
included coordination with the Naval Service 
Training Command and the NJROTC Director. 
On September 23, 2019, the Secretary of 
the Navy, approved Calexico High School’s re-
quest to advance from an NNDCC unit to an 
NJROTC unit. There were 181 students en-
rolled as NJROTC cadets at this time. 
HONORING THE SERVICE OF 
ROBERT ARMSTRONG 
HON. MARK DeSAULNIER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. DESAULNIER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the service of long-time 
community member Robert (Bob) Armstrong 
as he celebrates his 90th birthday. 
Bob was born in Visalia, California, but the 
Armstrong 
family 
eventually 
relocated 
to 
Northern California where Bob graduated from 
Richmond High School. Following graduation, 
Bob entered the U.S. Navy and served as an 
electronic technician. He married Anna Mae 
Caliri before attending the University of Cali-
fornia, Berkeley, and graduated with a degree 
in Electrical Engineering and a teaching certifi-
cate in 1957. 
In 1958, Bob and Anna moved to Concord 
where they raised their two children, Janet 
and Jim. That same year, Bob began a career 
as a high school teacher, and he would go on 
to teach math, electronics, and driver’s edu-
cation at multiple high schools including Mt. 
Diablo High School, Pacifica High School, 
Ygnacio Valley High School, and Concord 
High School. Not only was Bob dedicated to 
educating youth in our community, but he was 
also actively involved in the teachers’ union. 
After 30 years of teaching, Bob retired in order 
to take care of his aging parents. Retirement 
also gave Bob time to enjoy his many hob-
bies, spending many days boating and fishing 
and even joining a gym at age 86 where he 
takes cardio dance classes. Bob bowls four 
times a week and is still picking up new activi-
ties to stay busy. His adventurous spirit has 
led Bob to try many new things in life and he 
loves sharing his wisdom with others. 
Bob has been a member of the community 
for over 60 years. He is known for always hav-
ing a smile on his face and spreading joy to 
everyone who knows him. Please join me in 
wishing Bob well on his 90th birthday.

NO PUBLIC CHARGE DEPORTATION 
ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, for over 100 
years, public charge has been part of U.S. im-
migration law as a ground of deportation. It is 
time we change that part of law, especially 
with 
how 
the 
current 
administration 
is 
weaponizing this rule to hurt families and limit 
them from accessing critical safety net pro-
grams. 
Since the Trump administration published 
the new public charge rule in 2018, there are 
reports that this has led to chilling impacts on 
immigrant families participating in safety net 
programs for fear of jeopardizing their immi-
gration status. One in seven adults in immi-
grant families reported that they or a family 
member did not participate in a noncash ben-
efit program in 2018, out of fear of risking fu-
ture green card status. Even permanent resi-
dents who would not be affected by this pro-
posed rule have reported forgoing safety net 
programs. 
Madam Speaker, even more frightening is 
that this rule instills fear in families with chil-
dren. In fact, the rule could lead up to 4.7 mil-
lion people to withdraw from Medicaid and the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program alone. 
This fear has resulted in parents trying to opt 
out of free school lunch for their children— 
New York State schools have free lunch for all 
students—out of concern that they may be 
deemed a public charge and even possibly 
lose status and be deported. 
That is why, I am introducing the ‘‘No Public 
Charge Deportation Act’’, which would amend 
the Immigration and Nationality Act to remove 
public charge as a ground of deportation. 
The Trump administration is weaponizing 
the public charge rule to discriminate against 
low-income immigrants and immigrants of 
color. We need to assure families that they will 
not be deported if they legally use critical ben-
efits such as Medicaid, SNAP, and housing 
assistance. 
Madam Speaker, families should not have 
to decide between putting food on the table 
and risk getting deported. I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation to make 
sure families will not forgo programs that help 
provide basic necessities because of a public 
charge rule.

HONORING MS. LORENA L. LACAR 
FOR HER COMMITMENT TO THE 
VETERAN COMMUNITY 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Lorena L. Lacar’s professionalism 
and dedication to the Veteran community. 
Lorena L. Lacar entered employment as an 
extra-help employee with the County of Impe-
rial on April 7, 1993. She then transferred to 
the Imperial County Veterans Service Office 
on January 27, 1995, where she served for 
over 20 years. 
During Ms. Lacar’s tenure, she helped over 
20,000 veterans, dependents and widows 
claim their benefits which amounted to over 
$13,449,000 
in 
retroactive 
payments, 
$1,678,032 in monthly award payments and 
over $112,447 in lump sum payments, thus al-
lowing veterans to enjoy an increased quality 
of life owed to them for their service. 
Ms. Lacar’s exemplary professionalism and 
diligence has earned her the love and respect 
of the Imperial Valley’s veteran community. 
She has developed a vast array of resources 
and professional relationships to help enhance 
the quality of life for veterans. She has also 
devoted herself to assist veterans in need of 
shelter, subsistence, and has generously vol-
unteered her time after hours to assist vet-
erans in need of crisis counseling or depend-
ents in need of emergency services.

HONORING ELEANOR (ELLIE) 
BLOCH 
HON. JARED HUFFMAN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of Eleanor (Ellie) Bloch, who 
passed away on January 15, 2020, at the age 
of 83 after a lifetime of public service to her 
community. 
Born in 1936 in Brookline, Massachusetts, 
to 
Hymen 
Stutman 
and 
Nellie 
Wiener 
Stutman, Ellie graduated from Brookline High 
School in 1954 and then attended Boston Uni-
versity as a music major. She later graduated 
from Susquehanna University in Pennsylvania. 
After meeting and marrying her first husband, 
Harry Salesky, who passed away in 1983, 
they moved to New York and then Tiburon, 
where she remained for the next 48 years. In 
1985, Ellie married Don Spater, who died 
1996. She met her third husband, John Bloch, 
through mutual friends, and they married in 
1999. 
Ellie was elected to represent Marin County 
in the California Senior Legislature in 2004, 
and she served in this role tirelessly up until 
her passing. Among her many efforts, she 
worked hard to help pass a state emergency 
plan that included best practices for local gov-
ernments and municipalities to evacuate sen-
iors and people with disabilities. She served 
as one the vice chairs of the Joint Rules Com-
mittee from 2013–2015, and was a member of 
the Housing and Transportation committee, 
spending days at a time in Sacramento advo-
cating for seniors and people with disabilities. 
In 2017, Ellie was awarded the Moira Jackson 
award for distinguished service to the Cali-
fornia Senior Legislature. 
In addition to her work with the California 
State Legislature, Ellie was a member of the 
legislative committee for the California Com-
mission on Aging, served as president of the 
Tiburon Sunset Rotary Club, and from 2010– 
2018, she was an advisory board member for 
San Francisco State University’s Romberg 
Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies. She 
also served as a board member for Family 
Service Agency of Marin for 20 years, and she 
was a board member and secretary for the 
Marin City Community Development Corpora-
tion and Marin City Land Corporation for 15 
years. 
Beyond her incredible community service, 
Ellie was also the co-founder, coordinator, and 
mediator for Marin Mediation Services where 
she worked for 40 years. In this capacity, she 
was known for her ability to treat everyone 
who came before her fairly, toiling to reach 
resolutions that would benefit all parties in-
volved. In her free time, Ellie could be found 
enjoying art, music, spending time with friends 
and family, participating in yoga classes, and 
at the Corinthian Yacht Club. 
Ellie is survived by her husband, John 
Bloch, and three sons, William Salesky, Jo-
seph Salesky and Andrew Salesky, and step-
children Julie Middlebrook, Jenni Hamilton, 
Andrew 
Bloch, 
Deborah 
Spater-Melnick, 
Cheryl Spater and Lori Munoz, as well as 
seven grandchildren, one step-grandson, four 
great-grandchildren and two step-great-grand-
children. While she will be greatly missed, 
Ellie’s legacy will live on through the indelible 
and positive impact she had on her family, 
friends and extended community. Madam 
Speaker, please join me in sending her loved 
ones our sincere condolences and warm re-
gards.

INTRODUCTION OF TSA CHILD 
CARE ACT 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, over 44,000 
Transportation Security Officers serve as our 
first line of defense at airports across the 
country. Due to the nature of their job, these 
hardworking men and women, many of whom 
are parents, work abnormal hours, yet are not 
provided with the benefits, such as childcare, 
that many other federal employees receive. 
We need to ensure that Transportation Se-
curity Officers’ children are taken care of when 
their parents are working, especially during 
split shifts. Moreover, we need to provide our 
Transportation Security Officers that are ex-
pecting adequate breaks and provide des-
ignated lactation facilities for mothers. 
For that reason, I am introducing the TSA

RECOGNITION OF MR. TRACY ‘‘T- 
DOG’’ RASCOE, AS CALIFORNIA 
56TH ASSEMBLY DISTRICT’S 2019 
VETERAN OF THE YEAR 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Mr. Tracy ‘‘T-Dog’’ Rascoe, who 
was recently recognized by California State 
Assembly Member, Eduardo Garcia, as Cali-
fornia 56th Assembly District Veteran of the 
Year for 2019. 
Tracy served as a Surface Sonar Techni-
cian in the U.S. Navy for 10 years before join-
ing the U.S. Navy Reserves. There, he served 
for two years before transferring to the U.S. 
Army Reserves. In the Army reserves, he 
served as a Human Resource and Training 
noncommissioned officer (NCO) with the 104th 
and 95th Infantry Training Division where he 
helped train drill sergeants. 
After Tracy’s U.S. Navy active duty service, 
he joined the renewable energy industry in 
wind power. There, he utilized his training and 
managerial background and became a Tech-
nical Trainer and Training Manager for major 
leading organizations within the industry. Rec-
ognizing the potential for the industry’s future 
growth in the U.S. and the job opportunities it 
could provide veterans and others, Tracy be-
came a director of wind energy technology for 
both a community college and a for-profit 
school. During his term as a director, he vol-
unteered to lead the American Wind Energy 
Association (AWEA) Education Work Group. 
Here he worked diligently for two years with 
middle and senior members of the industry, 
colleges, technical schools, the Department of 
Energy and the Department of Labor to create 
skill sets for Wind Energy Technicians in the 
U.S. The skill sets were approved in 2010 and 
have resulted in the creation of official U.S. 
job codes for Wind Technicians. Currently, he 
serves on the AWEA Veterans Employment 
Committee, which focuses on attracting addi-
tional veterans to the wind industry. 
In 2012, Tracy left the Pattern Energy Oper-
ations Headquarters in Houston Texas, to be-
come an Operations Manager of their wind 
farm in Ocotillo, CA. As a veteran, Tracy and 
his wife (Dawn), were determined to be of 
service to others alike and transferred their 
American Legion memberships to the Boyce 
Aten Post located in El Centro. There, they 
quickly identified the need to revitalize the 
Post for the good of its members and the local 
community. 
While serving two consecutive years as the 
Post Commander, Tracy rose through the 
elected ranks in the 30th District (Imperial 
County) as 2nd Vice Commander, 1st Vice 
Commander and then Commander. As the 
30th District Commander, his successful lead-
ership and hands on approach helped revi-
talize the district posts. One of the posts under 
his leadership was severely struggling and on 
the verge of closure. As a result of his leader-
ship, the post was not only able to remain 
open, but it successfully achieved 135 percent 
increase in membership and has remained 
stellar in various performances to date. His 
leadership helped the 30th District achieve 3rd 
place in membership in the entire state of 30 
districts. As a result, the district received great 
respect and admiration within the American 
Legion Department of California 5th Area, 
which comprised of 107 American Legion 
Posts with over 25,000 members in Imperial, 
Orange, San Bernardino, San Diego and Riv-
erside counties. 
This past year, he was elected and served 
honorably as the American Legion Department 
of California (DOC) Vice Commander-Area 5. 
During his one-year term, he again earned 
great respect and admiration from leaders 
within the DOC. 
As a mentor, Tracy continues to strive to im-
prove. Last year he and Dawn completed the 
California American Legion College. They sup-
ported one another as she serves as an Auxil-
iary Unit 25 President and was recently elect-
ed as the Auxiliary 30th District President. 
Tracy presently serves as Jr. Past Vice 
Commander-Area 5, 30th District Judge Advo-
cate and as an Executive Board Member for 
the Boyce Aten American Legion Post 25 and

Veteran of Foreign Wars (VFW) No. 9305, in 
El Centro, CA. In addition, he was selected to 
be one of only seven members of the newly 
formed American Legion Department of Cali-
fornia Training Committee. There he drafted 
the approved Annual Training Budget and is 
leading the development of Post Finance Offi-
cer training to assist the 442 American Legion 
DOC Posts. 
Tracy continues to demonstrate his dedica-
tion to our community, veterans and patriot-
ism. This can be easily seen by his roles and 
active participations: Co-Founder and Presi-
dent of the Imperial Valley Patriotic Planning 
Committee, member of the 9/11 Memorial 
Stair Climb Committee, member of the Viet-
nam Moving Wall 2020 Ceremonies Com-
mittee, Advocate and active participant for the 
Imperial County Veterans Advisory Council 
and Veterans Employment Committee, mem-
ber and Secretary of the Imperial County Con-
tinuum of Care Council and Point-In-Time 
Count Committee. 
Tracy is a Cold War and Gulf War Veteran. 
In the past year, he alone raised several hun-
dreds of dollars to help support California Vet-
erans through the American Legion’s CALVAR 
Helmets for Heroes program. He has also pro-
vided multiple patriotic ceremonies to the com-
munity and served as the Master of Ceremony 
for the Boyce Aten Post 25’s 100th Anniver-
sary. 
Tracy is known and highly respected by 
many of the elected leaders within my district 
and Imperial County. I thank Tracy for his 
service and congratulate him for being se-
lected as California 56th Assembly District’s 
2019 Veteran of the Year.

LOCAL-BASED SOCIAL SECURITY 
BENEFITS ACT 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
bring attention to the need to ensure that we 
protect the most vulnerable of Americans, our 
elderly, disabled and disadvantaged citizens, 
from the risk of living in poverty. Social Secu-
rity was established 85 years ago, to provide 
a structure to maintain a collective sense of 
security amidst the expansion and develop-
ment of our great Nation. 
According to the Social Security Administra-
tion (SSA), about 63 million Americans re-
ceived $1 trillion in benefits in 2018. SSA esti-
mates that about one-third of beneficiaries de-
pend on Social Security benefits for more than 
90 percent of their retirement income. Further-
more, the number of Americans 65-and-older 
is projected to nearly double from 52 million in 
2018 to 95 million by 2060; their total popu-
lation will rise from 16 percent to 23 percent. 
Unfortunately, due to inflation and wide eco-
nomic disparities by region, Social Security 
provides an uneven distribution of benefits 
across the country. As you know, New York 
City is one of the most expensive places to 
live in the nation, and many, especially sen-
iors, battle with paying for even the most basic 
of necessities, including food and rent. 
That is why I am introducing the ‘‘Locality- 
based Social Security Benefits Act’’, which 
would adjust the amount of monthly old-age, 
survivors, and disability insurance payments 
under Title II of the Social Security Act based 
on locality-based comparability payment rates. 
Madam Speaker, Social Security is an im-
portant safety net that many Americans have 
come to rely upon as their main source of in-
come. We must ensure that the quality of life 
is not dependent upon where our senior and 
disadvantaged citizens live in America. I urge 
my colleagues to support this legislation.

RECOGNIZING THE 40TH ANNUAL 
SALUTE OF THE BLACK NURSES 
ASSOCIATION 
OF 
GREATER 
WASHINGTON D.C. AREA, INC. 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to ask the House of Representatives to join 
me in recognizing the 40th Annual Salute of 
the Black Nurses Association of Greater 
Washington, D.C. Area, Inc. 
The Black Nurses Association (BNA) of 
Greater Washington, D.C. Area (GWDCA), 
Inc., chartered in 1975, endeavors to support 
the mission of the National Black Nurses As-
sociation (NBNA) and provide services to resi-
dents in the D.C. area. 
BNA of GWDCA acts as a vehicle for cohe-
sion and solidarity among Black nurses to en-
sure the continuity of common heritage. The 
BNA of GWDCA hosted its first Annual Salute 
to a Black Nurse on February 14, 1981 at St. 
Elizabeths Hospital to recognize the contribu-
tions of nurses in the community and to cele-
brate Black History Month. ‘‘The Salute’’ has 
become a signature community program, 
where one practicing nurse is awarded ‘‘Nurse 
of the Year’’ and one nursing student is 
awarded a scholarship. 
BNA of GWDCA has a distinguished legacy 
of community service with a focus on address-
ing specific health problems of the Black con-
sumer and health care disparities. Past pro-
grams have included participation in the Na-
tional Black Nurses National Hypertension 
Project, National Depression Project and part-
nerships with the American Heart Association 
and the American Cancer Society. The asso-
ciation’s signature community service project 
provides community-based health assess-
ments and teaching through church-based and 
collaborative health fairs and partnerships with 
the D.C. Department of Health, Office of Im-
munizations and the Washington Hospital 
Center. 
Importantly, we are grateful that in response 
to the critical shortage of nurses in all areas 
of practice, the BNA of GWDCA’s ‘‘Choose 
Nursing Project’’ provides career information 
and mentoring in the field for students in D.C. 
area middle and high schools. As a chapter, 
BNA of GWDCA continues to carry the mis-
sion of ‘‘Empowering the community through 
Education, Service and Caring’’ and support 
the NBNA’s theme, ‘‘The Art and Science of 
Nursing.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to ask the 
House of Representatives to join me in hon-
oring the Black Nurses Association of Greater 
Washington, D.C. area for 45 years of working 
to improve the lives of D.C. residents and the 
profession of nursing. 
RESOLUTION 
EXPRESSING 
SUP-
PORT FOR THE DESIGNATION OF 
THE LAST DAY OF FEBRUARY 
EACH YEAR AS ‘‘RARE DISEASE 
DAY’’ 
HON. ANDRE´ CARSON 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to reintroduce this resolution with 
my colleague Rep. RICHARD HUDSON of North 
Carolina. Our resolution supports the designa-
tion of Rare Disease Day on the last day of 
February. I am pleased that this resolution has 
been endorsed by the National Organization 
for Rare Disorders (NORD) and am thankful 
for its leadership on these critical issues over 
many years. 
Nearly one in ten Americans live with one or 
more of the roughly 7,000 known rare dis-
eases. More than half of those struggling with 
rare diseases—defined as affecting less than 
200,000 people—are children. Sadly, many 
rare diseases and conditions are serious, life- 
threatening, and lack effective treatments. 
These are not just statistics: I am sure most 
of us know at least one family member or 
friend who has been affected by or struggled 
with the unique challenges of rare diseases. 
Moreover, as we observe Black History 
Month, it’s important to know that African 
Americans and other minorities are especially 
vulnerable to rare diseases, including Sickle 
Cell Anemia and Sarcoidosis. These diseases 
and conditions—including Thalassemia and 
Hereditary ATTR (hATTR) amyloidosis—dis-
proportionately affect African Americans. De-
spite these unique obstacles, African Ameri-
cans have an inspiring tradition of both com-
batting rare diseases and improving medical 
science. 
One great example is Dr. Charles Drew, an 
African American scientist who helped found 
the modern ‘‘blood bank,’’ which helped dra-
matically expand blood transfusions. A faculty 
member at Howard University, Dr. Drew’s pio-
neering work in blood transfusions took place 
against the backdrop of segregation and dis-
crimination. During his time overseeing the 
Red Cross’s blood plasma donation program, 
Dr. Drew was prohibited from donating his 
own blood because of the color of his skin. 
Despite these obstacles, Dr. Drew’s work im-
proved the practice of blood transfusions, 
which is now a lifeline for many individuals 
struggling today with rare diseases. The ex-
amples of Dr. Drew and countless other re-
searchers, physicians, nurses, activists, and 
patients underscore the importance of bringing 
additional awareness to rare diseases. 
Despite 
the 
many 
challenges, 
some 
progress has been made. More than 840 
drugs and biologics have been approached by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
the treatment of rare diseases. However, Con-
gress must do more to combat rare diseases. 
That’s why in September of 2019, Rep. HUD-
SON and I introduced the Rare disease Ad-
vancement, surveillance Research, and Edu-
cation (RARE) Act of 2019 (H.R. 4228). Our 
legislation, cosponsored by 57 bipartisan 
Members of Congress, expands the ability of 
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and 
Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention 
(CDC) to study rare diseases by improving

treatment, research, and diagnostics of rare 
diseases through new and existing programs. 
More work needs to be done to bring atten-
tion to the needs of those who struggle with 
rare diseases, and to celebrate their courage. 
That’s why Rep. HUDSON and I are introducing 
this important resolution. Each year, many in-
dividuals with rare diseases and their loved 
ones celebrate Rare Disease Day to share 
their stories and educate communities of re-
searchers, health professionals, governments, 
and community organizations about how rare 
diseases affect them. 
In 2019, more than 100 countries observed 
Rare Disease Day. Our resolution expresses 
support for the designation of the last day of 
this month as Rare Disease Day. Congress 
should recognize this work and improve our 
efforts to address the challenges facing the 
rare disease patient community. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will 
join us in supporting Rare Disease Day’s des-
ignation on the last day of February to better 
champion people with rare diseases. I urge 
the House to support this resolution.

SAN DIEGO VOICE & VIEWPOINT’S 
60TH DIAMOND ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JUAN VARGAS 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the San Diego Voice & Viewpoint 
Newspaper in recognition of their 60th anni-
versary. 
The San Diego Voice & Viewpoint is the 
oldest and largest African American news-
paper in San Diego. Its publisher, Dr. John 
Warren, and his late wife and co-publisher, 
Gerri Warren (emeritus) took over the Voice & 
Viewpoint in 1987. The couple worked dili-
gently in the community to make the publica-
tion a nationally award-winning publication. 
From small church gatherings to major polit-
ical campaigns, for six decades, the San 
Diego Voice & Viewpoint has faithfully re-
ported the news for African American commu-
nities in San Diego County. As San Diego’s 
largest African American publication, their 
news features have highlighted people and 
events in a more comprehensive manner, 
while commentators have argued from dif-
ferent points of view in the lively op-ed pages. 
The Voice & Viewpoint has grown over the 
last decade to over 350 newsstands and out-
lets in convenience stores. The publication 
can be found in all 89 zip codes of San Diego 
and has readership of over 60,000. 
I would like to honor San Diego Voice & 
Viewpoint for its dedication and lifelong com-
mitment to the African American community 
within California’s 51st Congressional District.

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to

the 2020 Dale City Civic Association awards. 
With the core values of compassion and a true 
sense of community, Dale City Civic Associa-
tion honors community members who are 
making a positive impact in their city. 
The Dale City Civic Association stages this 
annual banquet to honor those in their com-
munity who have gone above and beyond the 
call in their service to our community. This 
banquet and the awards serve a strong pur-
pose by helping strengthen the community’s 
foundation and welcoming neighborhoods in 
Dale City. Improving the quality of life in Dale 
City for their residents is the goal of the Dale 
City Civic Association and these award recipi-
ents have made that goal much more achiev-
able. From teachers to public safety officials, 
to those who volunteer in their free time, these 
civil servants show why it is imperative to 
have individuals like them who selflessly dedi-
cate their time and efforts to make sure their 
community is prepared for the challenges of 
the day while laying the groundwork for a bet-
ter tomorrow. Their great work should be a 
model to us all, and it is my honor to enter

ment. In addition to his role in the Reserves, 
LTC Kelly serves as a local prosecutor.

mitment to serving the people of Southern

RECOGNIZING THE INCOMING 2020 
OFFICERS 
OF 
THE 
OCCOQUAN- 
WOODBRIDGE-LORTON 
VOLUN-
TEER FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the incoming 2020 officers of the 
Occoquan-Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire 
Department. OWLVFD is located in Prince 
William County Virginia, 25 miles from our Na-
tion’s Capital. The OWLVFD goes on an aver-
age of 20,000 runs per year, aiding 80,000 
residents in a 27 square mile area. 
Incorporated in the Commonwealth of Vir-
ginia in 1938, the OWLVFD is comprised of 
committed community members who volunteer 
their time, energy, and financial resources to 
ensuring the safety of the families and prop-
erty in and around Woodbridge. During its 80- 
year history, the Department has continued to 
expand and there are now three stations 
staffed by approximately 250 volunteers who 
serve and protect an ever-growing local popu-
lation. From their bravery in action, to their 
presence with the youth in the community, 
OWLVFD is readily available for the families of 
Woodbridge. 
It is with great honor I enter into the 
RECORD the names of the following Occoquan- 
Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire Department 
Officers: 
Department Chief—Rick Michael 
Department President—David Williams 
Executive Vice President—George Smith 
Membership Secretary—Scott Shaw 
Treasurer—Debra Haight 
Board of Directors—Jonathan Baldwin, Mike 
Clark, Anna Smith, Rebecca Barnes, Michele 
Bauer, Melissa Payne, Zachary Wessolleck, 
Kevin Lewis 
Election Officer—Sabrina Brandon Ricks 
Sergeant-At-Arms—Thomas Hubbard 
Assistant 
Chiefs—Kurt 
Bolland, 
Ernest 
DeSantis, Steve Godin, Wayne Haight, Ryan

Rescue Chief—Edward Craig 
Fire Captains—Kody Perry, Justin Witt 
Rescue Captain—Sandra Williams 
Fire Lieutenants—Mark Chandler, Jonathan 
Baldwin 
EMS Lieutenants—Melissa Westphal, Sybil 
Meeley, Michael Yankaskas, Mark Powers. 
While a new executive board has been 
elected and new officers sworn in, the mission 
of OWLVFD remains the same. The volun-
teers of the OWLVFD continue to put them-
selves in harm’s way for the benefit of the 
residents of the area and have educated and 
mentored the youth in Woodbridge, not only 
teaching fire safety education, but also 
strengthening community relations. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleague 
join me in recognizing the men and women of 
the Occoquan-Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer 
Fire Department for their service to our coun-
try and steadfast commitment to their commu-
nity and in congratulating the newly elected of-
ficers and board members. I thank them for 
their dedication and to all I say: ‘‘Stay safe.’’

and YEA on H. Res. 833. During the second 
vote series, I would have voted YEA on the 
Stevens/Morelle Amendment, NAY on the 
Foxx Amendment, NAY on the Roe Amend-
ment, YEA on the Wild Amendment, NAY on 
the Allen Amendment, NAY on the Meadows 
Amendment, YEA on the Jackson Lee Amend-

on the Republican Motion to Recommit on 
H.R. 2474, YEA on Final Passage of H.R.

I’d like to highlight that I am particularly dis-
appointed that I missed the vote for H. Res. 
826, a resolution to disapprove of the Trump 
Administration’s Medicaid block grant scheme. 
Millions of Americans, including more than 1 
million in Alabama, have access to the health 
care they need and deserve because of Med-
icaid. Most health care providers in my district 
and across the country are dependent on re-
imbursements from Medicaid to keep their 
doors open and to continue delivering care in 
our communities. I am proud the House 
Democrats took a strong stance against this 
Administration and their continued assault on 
health care access and coverage by passing 
a resolution condemning the most recent at-
tacks on Medicaid. 
On February 7, I would have voted YEA on 
the Shalala Amendment, NAY on the Repub-
lican Motion to Recommit on H.R. 5687, and 
YEA on Final Passage of H.R. 5687.

RECOGNIZING AN HILL’S 
NATURALIZATION CEREMONY 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize and congratulate An Hill for recently 
becoming a United States citizen. 
An and her husband, Geoffrey, met abroad, 
fell in love, and married. With hopes of starting 
a family in the United States, they needed to 
first secure a visa for An and turned to my of-
fice in hopes of obtaining assistance. 
After my office successfully helped the Hill 
family, An moved to Ohio with her husband 
and began the journey to become a natural-
ized citizen. 
Just a few weeks ago, her journey was 
complete, and my staff was honored to join 
her and her family at the naturalization cere-
mony as she took her oath of citizenship. 
To me, nothing is quite as beautiful than a 
naturalization ceremony. Congratulations, An, 
on all your hard work and dedication to be-
coming a United States citizen. 
An, raise the American flag and know that 
it is your flag, and the United States is your 
nation—your home.

TO 
THE

VOLUN-
TEER FIRE DEPARTMENT 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY

Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the service and dedication of Chief 
James

of 
the 
Occoquan- 
Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire Depart-
ment. Chief McAllister is retiring from the 
Occoquan-Woodbridge-Lorton Volunteer Fire 
Department following nearly three decades of 
service to our community. 
Chief McAllister joined OWLVFD in June of 
1991. Throughout his years of service Chief 
McAllister has served the department in every 
operational role. He has been a Firefighter, 
Medic, and for the last 11 years he has led 
the department as its Chief. Under his stead-
fast leadership, the department has continued 
to grow and expand, along with the community 
it serves. The OWLVFD is one of the largest 
volunteer departments in the country with al-
most 300 volunteer members and three fire 
stations. It provides fire suppression, EMS 
care and rescue services to 80,000 residents 
who live and work in a 27 square mile area. 
Last year, the department responded to more 
than 8,000 911-emergency calls which re-
sulted in nearly 20,000 runs. 
In addition to his duties leading the depart-
ment, he has served the county through his

Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me once again in congratulating Chief James 
McAllister for his 28-years of service to 
OWLVFD. His positive contributions, and dedi-
cated service to our community can never be

Mr. NORCROSS. Madam Speaker, yester-

INTRODUCTION OF THE 
WASHINGTON, D.C. ADMISSION ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform is preparing 
to hold the first markup of the District of Co-
lumbia statehood bill in either chamber of 
Congress since 1993, when I got the first-ever 
floor vote on the bill. I rise today to introduce 
a revised version of the bill, the purpose of 
which is to make technical and conforming 
changes and to address transition issues. 
On January 3, 2019, the first day of this 
Congress, I introduced H.R. 51, the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act, which has 224 co-
sponsors, a record for the D.C. statehood bill 
and far more cosponsors than most bills 
passed by the House. The bill I introduce 
today includes the text of H.R. 51, but makes 
technical and conforming changes to the text, 
provides transition assistance to the new state 
and establishes a transition commission to as-
sist with the orderly transition to statehood and 
to a reduced federal district. The D.C. state-
hood bill is well within the authority of Con-
gress, and is in compliance with the Admis-
sions and District clauses of the Constitution, 
as well as the 23rd Amendment. 
While the Constitution does not establish 
prerequisites for admission of states into the 
Union, Congress has generally considered 
three factors: commitment to democracy, sup-
port for statehood and requisite population and 
resources for the state to support itself. The 
District meets each prerequisite. The District 
has a larger population than two states, pays 
more in federal taxes than 22 states and pays 
more in federal taxes per capita than any 
other state. D.C. has a higher per capita per-
sonal income and gross domestic product than 
any state. In November 2016, over 86 percent 
of District residents voted in favor of an advi-
sory referendum requesting that the D.C. 
Council petition Congress for statehood. 
Congress has two choices. It can continue 
to exercise undemocratic, autocratic authority 
over the 705,000 American citizens who re-
side in our nation’s capital, treating them, in 
the words of Frederick Douglass, as ‘‘aliens, 
not citizens, but subjects.’’ Or it can live up to 
this nation’s promise and ideals, end taxation 
without representation and pass the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act. 
Since the founding of the nation, District 
residents have always carried all the obliga-
tions of citizenship, including serving in all of 
the nation’s wars and payment of federal 
taxes, all without voting representation on the 
floor in either house of Congress or freedom 
from congressional interference in purely local 
matters. The bill I introduce seeks to end this 
unequal treatment and give the residents of 
the nation’s capital their full rights as American 
citizens. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
THE 
UNDER-
STANDING 
AND 
STUDYING 
AMERCIAN (USA) CIVICS ACT OF 
2020 
HON. EARL BLUMENAUER 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, today 
I am pleased to introduce the Understanding 
and Studying American (USA) Civics Act of 
2020. 
Today, only 32 percent of Americans can 
name all three government branches. That 
means two-thirds of the people in the U.S. are 
not equipped with foundational knowledge 
necessary to participate in and navigate our 
democracy. Investing in civics education is key 
to ensuring that future participants and leaders 
in our democracy are equipped with the nec-
essary knowledge and skills to do so. 
The USA Civics Act of 2020 would provide 
grants to establish and strengthen civics pro-
grams to promote more comprehensive under-
standings of the history, achievements, and 
global impacts of American constitutional and 
representative democracy. Specifically, the bill 
supports the efforts of social science teachers 
in primary and secondary schools. In addition 
to funding teacher initiatives and educational 
curricula and materials, the USA Civics Act of 
2020 would provide funding to develop open 
educational resources and outreach activities. 
The USA Civics Act promotes the study of 
American political thought and constitutional 
democracies globally, invests in opportunities 
for civics educators to deepen their knowledge 
of the field, and opens new doors for our 
young future leaders to learn how they can 
participate in the country’s political life. I urge 
my colleagues to support this bipartisan legis-
lation. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS 
RAILSBACK 
HON. DARIN LaHOOD 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. LAHOOD. Madam Speaker, I would like 
to honor and remember the life of Congress-
man Thomas Railsback, who passed away on 
January 20, 2020, at the age of 87. 
Born in Moline, Illinois in 1940, Tom dis-
played a natural gravitation towards leader-
ship. He began his studies at Grinnell College 
in Iowa and then Northwestern Law School in 
Illinois. Not long after he finished his formal 
education, Tom served in the United States 
Army from 1957 to 1959. After the completion 
of his military service, Tom returned home to 
the Quad Cities to practice law. 
Tom had a resilient passion for ethical lead-
ership, which pushed his desire to hold public 
office promoting just ideals, supporting bi-par-
tisan solutions advocating for good constituent 
service. In 1962, he was elected to the Illinois 
General Assembly as a republican state rep-
resentative, where he served for two terms. In 
1966 he was elected to the U.S. House of 
Representatives, where he represented Illinois’ 
19th congressional district for 16 years. While 
serving in the House, Tom played a key role 
in the passage of the Juvenile Justice and De-
linquency Prevention Act of 1974, which pro-
vides critical support for state programs that 
assist communities to take a comprehensive 
approach to juvenile justice. Tom was the sec-
ond ranking republican on the House Judiciary 
Committee and a key member during the 
Nixon presidency. 
Tom found joy in his life through his family 
and many lifelong friends. He and his first 
wife, Patricia (Sloan) Railsback, raised four 
daughters: Kathryn, Julie, Maggie, and Lisa. 
Tom married Joyelyn Railsback on Oct. 23, 
1998. They enjoyed golfing together, playing 
word games, and traveling during their 21 
years of marriage. 
Congressman Tom Railsback’s steadfast 
work to improve the lives of American citizens 
stands as a model for progress to further the 
greater good and prosperity of the union. He 
set the standard for the values and priorities 
which current—and future—public servants 
should strive to uphold in order to better our 
communities. It’s my honor to commemorate 
his life and his tireless bi-partisan work to im-
prove the lives of Americans and strive for 
ethical leadership. My deepest condolences 
go out to his wife, family, colleagues, and 
friends during their time of mourning.

HON. GRACE MENG

Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to

know, our nation is faced with a staggering

experiencing homelessness in a given night—

February 7, 2020 
and this number can vary throughout the year. 
In the State of New York, we are faced with 
more than 90,000 New Yorkers without a 
home. Furthermore, nationwide, only 37 af-
fordable and available homes exist for every 
100 extremely low-income renter households. 
In my own Sixth Congressional District of New 
York, these numbers are even worse; only 18 
housing units are available for every I00 ex-
tremely low-income households. 
Madam Speaker, these are not just data 
points; these are heartbreaking numbers—es-
pecially when one considers the families, the 
children in these households. We know that 
children living in stable, affordable homes are 
more likely to thrive in school and have great-
er opportunities to learn inside and outside the 
classroom. 
And yet, low-income families continue to 
face the unjust and heartbreaking decision of 
choosing between paying rent or paying for 
necessary 
expenses 
such 
as 
groceries, 
childcare, or prescription drugs. 
Madam Speaker, this is a cruel and impos-
sible decision. 
In September 2019, the Trump Administra-
tion took aim at individuals experiencing 
homelessness in the U.S. by releasing a re-
port that targeted a handful of states and cities 
by offering policy responses that adopted an 
‘‘out of sight, out of mind’ approach, such as 
rounding up and increasing the policing of vul-
nerable communities. Slashing HUD pro-
grams, tripling the rents for the lowest-income 
subsidized residents, allowing homeless shel-
ters to discriminate against the LGBTQ com-
munity, and evicting thousands of people will 
only exacerbate the homelessness crisis in 
America. 
In addition, the Administration has repeat-
edly taken steps to increase the number of 
families and individuals living in unstable 
housing situations and those at risk of home-
lessness. While Congress has continued to 
push back against the Administration’s every 
attempt to gut and dismantle our federal 
homelessness and affordable housing pro-
grams, Congress must—and can—do more. 
That is why I am introducing the Pathway to 
Stable and Affordable Housing for All Act. We 
need bold and robust solutions to address 
these housing challenges that every single 
congressional district faces. That is why, 
today, I am introducing the Pathway to Stable 
and Affordable Housing for All Act—a bill sets 
forth a 10-year investment plan based on esti-
mates from frontline service providers and ex-
perts that focus on meeting the challenges our 
states and communities face every day. 
Specifically, this bill consists of four provi-
sions: two of which would help states and or-
ganizations on the ground assist individuals 
experiencing homelessness into homeless 
shelters quickly and efficiently, and two fo-
cused on getting those in the shelter system 
into safe, affordable housing: 
$10 billion per year in additional funding for 
Emergency Solutions Grants; 
$10 billion per year in additional funding for 
Continuum of Care grants so organizations 
can move those experiencing homelessness 
into the shelter system and provide needed 
supports; 
$40 billion per year direct appropriation to 
the Housing Trust Fund—on top of the exist-
ing funding provided by Fannie Mae and 
Freddie Mac—to begin to chip away at the 
deficit of units in our nation’s affordable hous-
ing stock; and 
Fully funding tenant-based rental assistance 
to allow all eligible households to get into per-
manent, safe, affordable housing. 
The National Low Income Housing Coalition 
estimates, if enacted, this bill would effectively 
end homelessness and housing poverty. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to 
support this critical bill—the Pathway to Stable 
and Affordable Housing for All Act—to ensure 
housing justice for all Americans.

THE 
SOUTHERN 
DISTRICT 
OF 
OHIO 
HON. BRAD R. WENSTRUP

Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. WENSTRUP. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
congratulate Judge Matthew McFarland on his 
confirmation to the U.S. District Court for the 
Southern District of Ohio. 
Raised just outside of Portsmouth, Ohio, 
Judge McFarland has extensive personal and 
professional history practicing law across 
Scioto County and Southern Ohio for the last 
20 years. His dedication to public service is 
admirable. 
As an appellate judge, Judge McFarland au-
thored over 1,000 opinions and made over 
2,900 panel votes and served as the Presiding 
and Administrative Judge for multiple years. 
He has served as a visiting Judge on the Su-
preme Court of Ohio on four separate occa-
sions allowing him to sit on each level of the 
Ohio Judiciary including the trial, appellate, 
and supreme court bench. 
Judge McFarland is now only the second 
federal judge to serve the Southern District of 
Ohio from Scioto County. 
I’m proud to recognize Judge McFarland for 
his outstanding public service and for his re-
cent confirmation. I am confident he will con-
tinue to serve the people of Ohio well and I 
wish him the best of luck as he begins his ten-
ure on the federal bench.

CLARIFICATION OF CHANGES TO 
THE ALTERNATIVE FUEL MIX-
TURE 
CREDIT 
CONTAINED 
IN 
H.R. 1865 
HON. KEVIN BRADY 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Mr. BRADY. Madam Speaker, in December 
Congress addressed a number of expired or 
expiring tax provisions, commonly known as 
‘‘tax extenders,’’ by passing H.R. 1865 as part 
of year-end, FY’20 spending measure. 
For the most part, these tax provisions were 
simply extended seamlessly through 2020, 
which I viewed as a wasted opportunity to cre-
ate real certainty around these provisions for 
taxpayers. 
Additionally, one provision extending a fuel 
excise tax credit known as the Alternative Fuel 
Mixture Credit (AFMC) contained modifications 
prohibiting the blending of certain categories 
of fuels in order to claim the credit. These fuel 
categories had been part of the AFMC and the 
related Alternative Fuel Credit since both were 
created in a Surface Transportation bill in 
2005, and they had also been extended mul-
tiple times since then in past tax extenders 
bills. The intended purpose of these provisions 
was to reduce the United States’ dependence 
on foreign oil and to encourage cheaper, 
cleaner burning fuels (whether for transpor-
tation or other uses). 
One of the longstanding fuel categories 
eliminated in H.R. 1865 was liquified petro-
leum gas. Since enacted, the AFMC had pro-
vided a credit to taxpayers for mixtures of liq-
uefied petroleum gas, including propane, and 
taxable fuel. The modification in H.R. 1865 
eliminates the credit for any mixture that in-
cludes any type of liquefied petroleum gas. 
Madam Speaker, I have long been an oppo-
nent of retroactive tax increases, and there 
are currently several taxpayers in disputes 
with the Internal Revenue Service over wheth-
er they can properly claim the AFMC on past 
tax returns. 
I will note that the subsection of H.R. 1865 
that eliminated the longstanding classes of 
fuels from the AFMC also contained ‘‘no infer-
ence’’ language stating: 
‘‘Nothing contained in this subsection or the 
amendments made by this subsection shall be 
construed to create any inference as to a 
change in law or guidance in effect prior to en-
actment of this subsection’’ (enactment oc-
curred when H.R. 1865 was signed into law 
on December 20, 2019). 
The Congressional intent of this ‘‘no infer-
ence’’ language is unambiguous—this provi-
sion should ensure a fair day in court for tax-
payers in legitimate disputes with the IRS over 
the AFMC.

AS THEY MARK THEIR 130TH AN-

HON. ROSA L. DeLAURO 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, February 7, 2020 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, it gives 
me great pleasure to rise today to join the 
many family, friends, and community leaders 
who have gathered today and extend my very 
best wishes to Howard and Ken Kreiger as 
they mark the 130th Anniversary of their iconic 
Main Street store, Spector Furniture. Family 
owned and operated since its doors opened in 
1890, Spector Furniture is a cornerstone of 
the community of Ansonia, Connecticut. 
One hundred-thirty years of Spector Fur-
niture is an impressive achievement. As old as 
the City of Ansonia itself, it is the oldest fur-
niture store in Connecticut and a testament to 
the honored traditions of Yankee craftsman-
ship as well as entrepreneurial spirit. Simon 
Spector opened the business and it has been 
passed down generation to generation—from 
Simon to George Spector, then Lawrence 
Winer, followed by David Kreiger, and now 
Howie and Ken—with each facing their own 
challenges to survival. Spector Furniture has 
weathered World War I, Prohibition, the Great 
Depression, the devastating Flood of 1955, 
de-industrialization, stagflation, NAFTA, and 
the rise of Made in China. Through it all, and 
all of the changes that have taken place in the

American economy, the Connecticut economy, 
and the economy of the Valley, Spector Fur-
niture has stood tall. 
I have often said that small businesses are 
the backbone of our nation’s economy. For 
one hundred-thirty years, Spector Furniture 
has been a fixture in Ansonia and throughout 
its history, has been a testament to the impact 
small businesses can have on a community. 
Even as the store has grown and expanded 
over the years, their vision and commitment to 
innovation and quality service has never 
wavered. It is small businesses like Spector 
Furniture, that forge the strongest bonds of 
our communities. 
I am honored to take this moment and stand 
to recognize the innovative and entrepre-
neurial spirit of Simon Spector and the gen-
erations of his family who have not only made 
Spector Furniture a success, but, more impor-
tantly, have ensured that its success has bol-
stered the Ansonia community as a whole. To 
Howard, Ken and the entire family—my heart-
felt congratulations on this incredible mile-
stone. I have no doubt that Spector Furniture 
will continue in its success for many years to 
come. One hundred (Cent’ Anni).
