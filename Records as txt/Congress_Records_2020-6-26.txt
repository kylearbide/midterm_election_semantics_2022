Bless the people’s House, and may all 
that is done be for Your greater honor

Amen.

CONGRATULATING ZACK EARP 
(Mr. TAKANO asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate a dear friend and 
community member, Zack Earp, on re-
ceiving the Riverside Spirit Award. 
Zack was a longtime educator and 
Marine veteran who saw combat in 
Vietnam. 
Despite the health challenges he has 
faced, Zack continues to serve actively 
in our community by working with 
local volunteers, advocating for local 
students, and volunteering with the 
Boy Scouts. 
Zack has inspired so many people, in-
cluding me, with his positive attitude 
and his will to make our community a 
better place for all. 
Zack has dedicated his life to service 
and to activism, and we are lucky to 
have him in Riverside. 
Zack is deserving of this award, and 
I am glad that the Riverside City Coun-
cil is recognizing such an outstanding 
citizen.

CONGRATULATING MAJOR 
GENERAL JON JENSEN 
(Mr. STAUBER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. STAUBER. Mr. Speaker, it is my 
honor to stand here today and con-
gratulate Major General Jon Jensen of 
the Minnesota National Guard on his 
recent nomination to become the next 
Director of the Army National Guard. 
Major General Jensen is a proven

June 26, 2020 
service to the great State of Minnesota 
and our Nation. 
Currently, 
Major 
General 
Jensen 
serves as the adjutant general of the 
Minnesota National Guard, meaning 
that he is the highest ranking guards-
man in our State. Major General Jen-
sen has also held numerous other lead-
ership positions during his 37 years 
with the National Guard. 
Throughout his entire career, Major 
General Jensen has served with the 
highest level of dedication. His service 
has earned him the respect of the pub-
lic; 
countless 
government 
officials; 
and, 
most 
importantly, 
his 
fellow 
guardsmen. 
On behalf of the entire State of Min-
nesota, I thank Major General Jon Jen-
sen for his service and congratulate 
him on this well-deserved nomination. 
Major General Jensen’s rich experi-
ence makes him the perfect fit for the 
position, and I look forward to seeing 
him confirmed by the United States 
Senate soon.

SENATE MUST PASS JUSTICE IN 
POLICING ACT 
(Ms. MENG asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MENG. Mr. Speaker, I rise today 
because our Nation is screaming out, 
grieving for those killed by police bru-
tality and racial injustice. 
I rise today because, for 8 minutes 
and 46 seconds, a police officer pressed 
his knee on George Floyd’s neck, slow-
ly killing him, but we know there are 
countless more who will forever remain 
faceless and nameless because their 
stories were never recorded. 
I rise today because Black lives mat-
ter. 
Last night, I proudly voted to pass 
this historic, transformative bill, the 
Justice in Policing Act. 
This bill would finally put in place 
unprecedented and bold reforms to curb 
police brutality and racial profiling 
and combat the epidemic of racial in-
justice. 
Mr. Speaker, we cannot turn our 
backs on the cries for justice. We can-
not go back to a system that would 
look the other way when faced with po-
lice brutality. 
The Senate must follow the House’s 
lead and immediately pass this bill be-
cause this moment of national anguish 
demands nothing less. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE OF ROBERT 
BOATRIGHT 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember and honor 
the life of Mr. Roger Boatright of 
Alma, Georgia, who passed away on 
May 8. 
Roger was a remarkable man of great 
courage, leadership, and depth, and I 
had the honor and privilege of knowing 
him well. 
Roger retired from the Georgia State 
Patrol as a trooper first class and was 
a faithful member to his church and 
numerous community organizations, 
such as the Bacon County Exchange 
Club; the Bacon County Hospital Au-
thority; and the Georgia Municipal As-
sociation, to which he served as presi-
dent. 
When Roger was elected as a council 
member for the city of Alma in 1986, 
this paved the course of his life of serv-
ice to his community. 
A few years later, Roger was elected 
mayor of Alma, where he faithfully 
served 14 years. In 2009, he was elected 
chairman of the Bacon County Board of 
Commissioners and later returned to 
serve as a council member for the city 
of Alma. 
While tremendously improving his 
city as mayor, he was appointed to the 
board of the Georgia Department of 
Community Affairs before he became 
chair of this statewide board. 
Roger was truly a pillar in his com-
munity, which is why he was rightfully 
rewarded various accolades. 
Although Roger had a passion for 
service and loved his community deep-
ly, he loved his family more than any-
thing. 
I am thankful for the lasting impact 
Roger had on so many, including my-
self, and I know his legacy and influ-
ence will remain for years to come. 
My thoughts and prayers are with all 
who worked with him, knew him, and 
loved him. Southeast Georgia has lost 
a great man. 
f 
DEMOCRATS REMAIN COMMITTED 
TO STRENGTHENING HEALTHCARE 
(Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, on 
Monday, the House will vote on the Pa-
tient Protection and Affordable Care 
Enhancement Act, a bill that will 
lower healthcare costs and prescription 
drug costs, protect patients with pre-
existing conditions, expand Medicaid, 
and lower prescription drug costs. 
Democrats 
have 
been 
committed 
since the day we arrived here to 
strengthening 
access 
to 
quality 
healthcare. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle, on the other hand, are trying 
to rip away healthcare from 20 million 
Americans and weaken protection for 
135 million Americans with preexisting 
conditions. 
They have been trying to do this for 
10 years. They are obsessed with the 
very idea. 
Yesterday, President Trump joined 18 
Republican Governors and attorneys 
general in filing a brief in the United 
States Supreme Court to have the en-
tire Affordable Care Act declared un-
constitutional in the middle of a global 
health pandemic. More than 40 million 
Americans have filed for unemploy-
ment; 120,000 Americans have died; and 
more than 2.25 million Americans have 
been infected with this virus. There has 
never been a more important time to 
protect access to quality, affordable 
healthcare than right now. 
That is why Democrats are going to 
move forward with another bill that 
will further strengthen access to high- 
quality, affordable healthcare. It is im-
portant that we continue this fight to 
protect the American people and their 
access to healthcare. 
f 
RECOGNIZING 70TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF KOREAN WAR 
(Mr. WILSON of South Carolina 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, yesterday marked the 70th 
anniversary of the Korean war. On 
June 25, 1950, at 4 a.m., the North Ko-
rean army mercilessly crossed the 38th 
parallel with 135,000 troops to begin the 
invasion of the South. 
This anniversary is an opportunity to 
especially remember the 326,863 Ameri-
cans who served and the 36,574 who died 
to successfully stop communist impe-
rialism. 
I am grateful that President Donald 
Trump and First Lady Melania Trump 
provided a wreath at the extraordinary 
Korean War Veterans Memorial on The 
Mall yesterday in Washington. 
There is no greater contrast between 
the blessings of democratic capitalism, 
with South Korea being one of the 
world’s wealthiest nations as North 
Korea’s totalitarian socialist regime 
has mass poverty. 
Korea is well represented in Wash-
ington by Ambassador Lee Soo-hyuck, 
and Korean Americans are valued citi-
zens. 
In conclusion, God bless our troops, 
and we will never forget September the 
11th in the global war on terrorism.

HONORING THE LIFE OF 
REVEREND MAGGIE HOWARD 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today with an incredibly heavy 
heart to honor the life of my dear 
friend, Reverend Maggie Howard, a 
woman whose kind soul is impossible 
to describe in just this 1 minute that I 
have. 
From her Stapleton UAME Church 
on Tompkins Avenue on Staten Island, 
Reverend Howard led a ministry of 
service that was impossible to miss. 
Through her soup kitchen and pan-
try, she not only opened the doors of 
her church; she opened her heart and 
soul to anyone in need. When others 
might see someone homeless or suf-
fering and look the other way, no, 
Maggie would offer them a meal or 
even a job. 
That love for her community earned 
her the nickname Stapleton’s Mother

Teresa, and it was her fierce spirit that 
allowed her to overcome so many chal-
lenges in her life, including fighting 
through her own health struggles. 
I know that all of Staten Island is 
feeling the pain of losing Reverend 
Howard this young, but I want to close 
out with words of optimism that were 
near and dear to her heart: ‘‘No matter 
what happened yesterday, tomorrow 
can be better if we start today.’’ 
Today, Staten Islanders are going to 
come together to honor and celebrate 
Reverend Howard’s life, and we will 
never forget her memory. 
f 
RECOGNIZING NATIONAL PTSD 
AWARENESS MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
June as National PTSD Awareness 
Month, and this Saturday, June 27, as 
PTSD Awareness Day. 
We need to do more to defy the stig-
mas surrounding mental health. PTSD 
treatment is a crucial tool that helps 
many individuals, particularly our Na-
tion’s veterans, process, cope, and treat 
emotional and mental trauma. 
Sadly, many of the men and women 
who have served in the United States 
military return home with injuries and 
scars, but sometimes, it is the invisible 
scars that hurt the most. Many strug-
gle privately with PTSD and feel there 
is no outlet. 
PTSD Awareness Month is not only 
an opportunity to raise awareness 
about this, but it is also an oppor-
tunity to raise awareness about treat-
ment options. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
offers a variety of resources to help 
those suffering from PTSD. Those 
seeking treatment should know that 
telemedicine may be an option as well, 
ensuring our veterans receive timely 
healthcare no matter where they live. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank our Nation’s 
veterans for their service, and I encour-
age those who are struggling with 
PTSD to pursue treatment. 
f 
CONGRESS CANNOT STOP HERE 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise in support of the George Floyd 
Justice in Policing Act. The measures 
in this bill are long overdue and are a 
step forward in ensuring people, espe-
cially Black folks in our country, do 
not experience racist police violence. 
We can’t stop here, though, Mr. 
Speaker. I think about Aiyana Stan-
ley-Jones, a young girl in Detroit who 
would be graduating from high school 
this year if she had not been murdered 
by police when they raided her home, 
the wrong home, while she slept in 
2010. 
We can’t stop here. We must continue 
to push policies that will tear down 
structural racism, reimagine public 
safety, and divest from policing so we 
can 
invest 
more 
in 
education, 
healthcare, mental health, jobs, trans-
portation, things that keep us safe and 
our communities thriving. 
Aiyana should be here. George should 
be here. Breonna Taylor should be 
here. They all should be here. 
Thank you so much, Mr. Speaker, 
and I continue to work toward justice 
for all of us.

BUILD 
UPON 
THE 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF OUR FOREFATHERS 
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, leaders 
everywhere should decry the violent 
crowds toppling our statues. Our sys-
tems are the greatest ever devised by 
mankind. They deliver more equality, 
more justice, more liberty, and more 
pursuits of happiness than any other 
system throughout history. 
Now, we haven’t always lived up to 
the ideals of our system, but we should 
build upon the accomplishments of our 
forefathers, not destroy their memo-
ries. We must bring about change by 
following the laws, not breaking them. 
We must support our police, not am-
bush them.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill,

hour equally divided and controlled by 
the chair and ranking minority mem-
ber of the Committee on Oversight and 
Reform. 
The gentlewoman from the District 
of Columbia (Ms. NORTON) and the gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE) each 
will control 30 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
sert extraneous material on H.R. 51. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States is the 
only democratic country that denies 
both voting rights in its national legis-
lature and local autonomy to the resi-
dents of its nation’s capital. 
As we approach July Fourth, it is 
long past time to apply the Nation’s 
oldest slogan, ‘‘no taxation without 
representation,’’ and the principle of 
consent of the governed to District of 
Columbia residents. H.R. 51 would do 
so, and Congress has both the moral 
obligation and the constitutional au-
thority to pass the bill. 
H.R. 51 would admit the State of 
Washington, Douglass Commonwealth 
into the Union and reduce the size of 
the Federal District. The State would 
consist of 66 of the 68 square miles of 
the present-day Federal District. 
The reduced Federal District, over 
which Congress would retain plenary 
authority, would consist of 2 square 
miles. The reduced Federal District 
would consist of the Washington that 
Members of Congress and visitors asso-
ciate with the Nation’s Capital, includ-
ing the White House, the Capitol, the 
Supreme Court, and the principal Fed-
eral monuments. 
H.R. 51 has both the facts and the 
Constitution on its side. The Constitu-
tion 
does 
not 
establish 
any 
pre-
requisites for new States, but Congress 
generally has considered three factors 
in admission decisions: resources and 
population, support for statehood, and 
commitment to democracy. 
The District pays more Federal taxes 
per capita than any State and pays 
more Federal taxes than 22 States of 
the Union. The District’s population of 
705,000 is larger than those of Wyoming 
and Vermont, and the new State would 
be one of the seven States with a popu-
lation under 1 million. 
D.C.’s $15.5 billion budget is larger 
than those of 12 States, and the Dis-
trict’s AAA bond rating is higher than 
those of 35 States. D.C. has a higher per 
capita personal income and gross do-
mestic product than any State. 
Eighty-six percent of D.C. residents 
voted in favor of statehood in 2016. In 
fact, D.C. residents have been fighting 
for voting rights in Congress and local 
autonomy for 219 years. 
The 
Constitution’s 
Admissions 
Clause gives Congress the authority to 
admit new States, and all 37 new 
States have been admitted by an act of 
Congress. The Constitution’s District 
Clause, which gives Congress plenary 
authority over the Federal District, 
sets a maximum size of the Federal 
District of 100 square miles. It does not 
set a minimum size. Congress pre-
viously has changed the size of the 
Federal District, including by reducing 
it 30 percent in 1846. 
Over the last few months, the Nation, 
and even the world, has witnessed dis-
criminatory and outrageous treatment 
of D.C. residents by the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
In 
March, 
Congress 
passed 
the 
CARES Act, which deprived the Dis-
trict of $755 million in coronavirus fis-
cal relief by treating the District as a 
territory rather than a State. The HE-
ROES Act, passed by the House in May, 
would restore those funds. 
This month, Federal police and out- 
of-State National Guard troops occu-
pied D.C., without the consent of the 
D.C. Mayor, to respond to largely 
peaceful protests. Prior to this occupa-
tion of the city, there had been much 
more looting and property destruction 
in other cities, but the Federal Govern-
ment did not occupy those cities. The 
Federal occupation occurred solely be-
cause the President thought that he 
could get away with it. He was wrong. 
For me, H.R. 51 is deeply personal.

on a plantation, made it as far as D.C., 
a walk to freedom but not to equal citi-

family has been denied the rights other 
Americans take for granted. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself an additional 1 minute. 
Congress has two choices: It can con-
tinue to exercise undemocratic or auto-
cratic authority over the 705,000 Amer-
ican citizens who reside in our Nation’s 
capital, treating them, in the words of 
Frederick Douglass, as ‘‘aliens; not 
citizens, but subjects’’; or Congress can 
live up to this Nation’s promise and 
ideals and pass H.R. 51. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank 
Speaker NANCY PELOSI, Majority Lead-
er STENY HOYER, Majority Whip JAMES 
CLYBURN, Chairwoman CAROLYN MALO-
NEY, and the late Elijah Cummings, our 
millions of allies across the country, 
and, most importantly, generations of 
D.C. residents and officials who have 
refused to simply accept their treat-
ment as second-class citizens for bring-
ing us to this historic day. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 51, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE JUDCIARY, 
Washington, DC, June 18, 2020. 
Hon. CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, House of Representatives, Wash-
ington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY: This is to ad-
vise you that the Committee on the Judici-
ary has now had an opportunity to review 
the provisions in H.R. 5803, the ‘‘Washington, 
D.C. Admission Act,’’ that fall within our 
Rule X jurisdiction. I appreciate your con-
sulting with us on those provisions. The Ju-
diciary Committee has no objection to your 
including them in the bill for consideration 
on the House floor, and to expedite that con-
sideration is willing to forgo action on H.R. 
5803, with the understanding that we do not 
thereby waive any future jurisdictional 
claim over those provisions or their subject 
matters. 
In the event a House-Senate conference on 
this or similar legislation is convened, the 
Judiciary Committee reserves the right to 
request an appropriate number of conferees 
to address any concerns with these or simi-
lar provisions that may arise in conference. 
Please place this letter into the Congres-
sional Record during consideration of the 
measure on the House floor. Thank you for 
the cooperative spirit in which you have 
worked regarding this matter and others be-
tween our committees. 
Sincerely, 
JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM, 
Washington, DC, June 22, 2020. 
Hon. JERROLD NADLER, 
Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your 
letter regarding H.R. 5803, the Washington 
D.C. Admission Act. As you know, the bill 
was referred primarily to the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, with an 
additional referral to the Committee on the 
Judiciary. 
I thank you for allowing the Committee on 
the Judiciary to be discharged from further 
consideration of the bill to expedite floor 
consideration. This discharge in no way af-
fects your jurisdiction over the subject mat-
ter of the bill, and it will not serve as prece-
dent for future referrals. In addition, should 
a conference on the bill be necessary, I would 
support your request to have the Committee 
on the Judiciary represented on the con-
ference committee. 
I would be pleased to include this letter 
and your correspondence in the Congres-
sional Record during floor consideration to 
memorialize our understanding. 
Sincerely, 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND COMMERCE, 
Washington, DC, June 19, 2020. 
Hon. CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Re-
form, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN MALONEY: I write con-
cerning H.R. 5803, the ‘‘Washington, D.C. Ad-
mission Act,’’ which was additionally re-
ferred to the Committee on Energy and Com-
merce (Committee). There are certain provi-
sions in the legislation which concern the 
Medicaid federal medical assistance percent-
age for a newly admitted state and fall with-
in the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee 
on Energy and Commerce. 
In recognition of the desire to expedite 
consideration of H.R. 5803, the Committee 
agrees to waive formal consideration of the 
bill as to such provisions. The Committee 
takes this action with the mutual under-
standing that we do not waive any jurisdic-
tion over the subject matter contained in 
this or similar legislation, and that the Com-
mittee will be appropriately consulted and 
involved as this bill or similar legislation 
moves forward so that we may address any 
remaining issues within our jurisdiction. I 
request that you urge the Speaker to name 
Members of the Committee to any con-
ference committee which is named to con-
sider such provision. Such participation will 
be critical to allow the Committee to con-
tinue to work on the policy involving the 
Medicaid federal medical assistance percent-
age for a newly admitted state. 
Finally, I would appreciate the inclusion of 
this letter into the Congressional Record 
during floor consideration of H.R. 5803. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK PALLONE, Jr., 
Chairman. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND REFORM, 
Washington, DC, June 22, 2020. 
Hon. FRANK PALLONE, 
Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: Thank you for your 
letter regarding H.R. 5803, the Washington 
D.C. Admission Act. As you know, the bill 
was referred primarily to the Committee on 
Oversight and Government Reform, with an 
additional referral to the Committee on En-
ergy and Commerce, due to provisions in the 
legislation which concern the Medicaid fed-
eral medical assistance percentage for a 
newly admitted state. 
I thank you for allowing the Committee on 
Energy and Commerce to be discharged from 
further consideration of the bill to expedite 
floor consideration. This discharge in no way 
affects your jurisdiction over the subject 
matter of the bill, and it will not serve as 
precedent for future referrals. In addition, 
should a conference on the bill be necessary, 
I would support your request to have the 
Committee on Energy and Commerce rep-
resented on the conference committee. 
I would be pleased to include this letter 
and your correspondence in the Congres-
sional Record during floor consideration to 
memorialize our understanding. 
Sincerely, 
CAROLYN B. MALONEY, 
Chairwoman. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admis-
sion Act. 
There is a whole lot more to state-
hood than simply being a large and vi-
brant city. Our Nation’s Founders 
made it clear that D.C. is not meant to 
be a State. They thought about it, they 
debated it, and they rejected it. In fact, 
in those early days, Alexander Ham-
ilton himself proposed an amendment 
that would allow the District residents 
to have a voting Member in the House, 
and that proposal was rejected. 
If the majority wishes to go against 
our Founders, that is their prerogative, 
but they should simply admit, in their 
opinion, the Founders were wrong. 
They cannot ignore the intention be-
hind D.C.’s current status. The Con-
stitution simply does not allow city 
governments to become microstates 
with all the rights and responsibilities 
of full States. The debate about the na-
ture of Washington, D.C., is not a new 
debate, but it is absolutely a settled 
one. 
My friends on the other side of the 
aisle may gasp and protest in outrage 
at the suggestion that what this is 
really all about is an attempt to get 
two more Democratic Senators. That is 
what this really is all about. 
On our side, there is no question that 
we have the Constitution on our side 
on this whole debate. The Constitution 
clearly establishes a federation of sov-
ereign States, and representation here 
in Washington, D.C., comes from those 
States, the federation of those States. 
This District is a unique entity. It was 
set apart to not be influenced by a 
State, but to, in itself, be governed by 
those representatives of the various 
States who are here. 
Our Founders did not want this city, 
the seat of our Federal Government, to 
be influenced by any other State, but 
that is exactly what this proposal 
would do. 
As James Madison expressed it him-
self in Federalist 43, if the Nation’s 
Capital City were situated within a 
State, the Federal Government could 
be subject to undue influence of that 
State. That is not the intent of our 
Federal Government; that is not the 
intent of this District that has been set 
aside; and that is exactly what would 
happen under this bill. 
My colleagues across the aisle be-
lieve that excluding a small Federal 
enclave from this new State would nul-
lify the need for a constitutional 
amendment, but that is simply not 
true. The original text of the Constitu-
tion is clear. 
Congress has the power to create 
States from two sources: a territory or

an existing State that agrees to secede 
its territory to become a State. Wash-
ington, D.C., is neither of these. It is 
the Nation’s only Federal District, and 
it is set aside for a specific purpose. 
Congress does not have the authority 
to take this District and create a State 
out of it. At least one constitutional 
amendment would be required for that 
to happen. 
During the markup of this bill, I per-
sonally raised these constitutional con-
cerns and offered an amendment to 
provide an expedited procedure to deal 
with the constitutional amendment, 
but the Oversight Committee Demo-
crats opposed that amendment, and 
they opposed, in fact, all of our amend-
ments that were put forth. 
This is not a surprise that this whole 
proposal has been rejected by the 
American people. 
b 0930 
In fact, in a Gallup Poll last year, 64 
percent of Americans reject the idea of 
D.C. being a State, only 29 percent ap-
prove of it. 
Granting D.C. statehood goes against 
not only the American citizens’ de-
sires, but more importantly, against 
the Constitution itself and certainly 
our Framers’ original intent. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues in 
the House to oppose the Washington, 
D.C. Admissions Act. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from New 
York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. MALONEY), 
chairwoman of the House Committee 
on Oversight and Reform, and I thank 
her for the way she conducted hearings 
on H.R. 51. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman from the District of Columbia 
(Ms. NORTON), and my good friend, for 
her years of leadership on this bill. She 
is not only the author of the bill, but of 
this historic day for our democracy. 
For the first time in a generation, 
the House will vote today on whether 
hundreds of thousands of American 
citizens will finally have their voices 
counted in Congress. 
We will vote to honor the most fun-
damental principles of this Nation and 
for which a revolution was launched: 
no taxation without representation and 
consent of the governed. 
I can think of no more honorable or 
patriotic endeavor than taking up this 
legislation today to give the people of 
the District the same rights enjoyed by 
hundreds of millions of other Ameri-
cans across our country. 
The United States is a democracy, 
but its capital is not. The United 
States is the only democratic country 
that denies both voting rights in the 
national legislature and local self-gov-
ernment to the people of the capital. 
That is wrong and violates everything 
we stand for as Americans. 
The District pays more in Federal 
taxes than 22 States and more per cap-
ita than any State. Think about that. 
It pays more than nearly half the 
States in this country, yet D.C. resi-
dents have no vote in Congress, and 
that is wrong. 
The people of the District have been 
fighting for equal rights for more than 
200 years. In 2016, an overwhelming 86 
percent of D.C. residents voted for 
statehood. 
President Trump’s recent decision to 
deploy thousands of Federal law en-
forcement officers in D.C. against resi-
dents peacefully exercising their con-
stitutionally-protected right to pro-
test, and without the consent of the 
District’s 
elected 
officials, 
dem-
onstrated the urgent need for full local 
government 
and 
congressional 
rep-
resentation. 
Unfortunately, so far, Republicans 
have opposed our effort, and the Presi-
dent made clear exactly why: they 
would rather deny voting rights for 
hundreds of thousands of American 
citizens than even consider the possi-
bility that representatives from the 
new State could be Democrats. 
Now, think about that argument. 
They are willing to violate the core 
principles of our democracy merely be-
cause they may be from a different po-
litical party. This argument is anti- 
democratic and un-American. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentle-
woman from New York. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. The questions for Republicans 
are these: Do they truly believe in tax-
ation without representation? Do they 
truly believe in States’ rights? Do they 
truly believe the Federal Government 
should stay out of local affairs? If they 
do, then join us and act on these beliefs 
today. This bill should be bipartisan. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge every 
Member to vote on H.R. 51 for the soon- 
to-be 51st State of our great country. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I would just remind the 
chairwoman that the entire court sys-
tem of Washington, D.C., is supported 
by the Federal Government. 
And there is representation. This 
District has three electoral votes. No 
other city in the country has that. 
There is a representative here. 
It is just an amazing thing, too, that 
this whole bill does not even allow 
elections for the new Governor that is 
proposed here, so the very thing they 
are arguing, they reject and deny from 
the residents. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. 
MURPHY), my good friend. 
Mr. MURPHY of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 51. 
Voting against this legislation is not 
an economic, racial, or a social injus-
tice, as my colleagues across the aisle 
may unfairly claim. I have no doubt 
that my Democratic friends, just like 
Republicans, 
want 
the 
citizens 
of 
Washington to have political rights 
like every other American. However, 
let’s talk about what is honest here. 
Let’s just be honest. 
The true goal here is to have two vir-
tually 
guaranteed 
new 
Democratic 
seats so that D.C. can become a State. 
That is what it comes down to. That is 
the goal. 
Why do I say that? Because there is a 
much simpler alternative that I am 
baffled that the Democrats do not want 
anything to do with. I offered an 
amendment to this bill that would 
retrocede the District of Columbia 
back to Maryland. That is where the 
land came from. 
Congress ceded the west side of the 
Potomac, now Alexandria, from the 
District of Columbia back to Virginia 
in 1847. So there is plenty of historical 
precedent for this action. 
Unfortunately, despite making total 
sense, 
my 
amendment 
was, 
sadly, 
blocked. 
If D.C. were ceded back to Maryland, 
citizens can vote for Members of the 
House of Representatives and Senate in 
Maryland. They would have congres-
sional representation in both Cham-
bers, with the exact effect of statehood. 
The move is simply unnecessary, 
when ceding D.C. back to Maryland is a 
viable, cost-effective, and common-
sense option. 
To further nullify this debate, the 
District of Columbia would require a 
constitutional amendment to change. 
The Framers of the Constitution, as 
has been said before, were very clear 
about this. The Supreme Court re-
affirmed this in 1949. 
So why are we trying to overturn the 
Supreme Court? One answer: politics, 
pure and simple. 
Even setting aside the obvious need 
for a constitutional amendment, my 
colleagues across the aisle know that 
this legislation has no chance of be-
coming law. It is just the majority’s 
attempt, again, to message bills to sat-
isfy the base. 
Let me be clear: Republicans do not 
want to attempt to stifle voices or sup-
press representation. 
If the D.C. citizens want to have rep-
resentation, then cede the land back to 
Maryland, because I have demonstrated 
it is a more hands-down, more prac-
tical solution. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, it is in-
teresting to note that the gentleman’s 
amendment to cede the District of Co-
lumbia back to Maryland did not have 
the consent of Maryland. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Virginia (Mr. CON-
NOLLY), my good friend. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, 
I 
thank 
my 
good 
friend, 
ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON, who is managing to-
day’s bill to right a wrong, but unfortu-
nately, because D.C. does not have a 
vote here in the Congress, she won’t be 
able to cast a vote on final passage of 
her own bill.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2534 
June 26, 2020 
Today, we are being asked to right a 
wrong. And you hear the contortions 
on the other side of the aisle to con-
tinue to justify a fundamental right 
being denied 700,000 fellow Americans 
who pay taxes, who fight in our wars 
and serve in government, who have 
families, who are Americans, but have 
no votes in the United States Congress. 
They are bigger than five States. 
They hide behind the Constitution. 
The Constitution was written before 
they even knew where the capital of 
the United States would be, before a 
blade of grass was touched to construct 
Washington, D.C. No one at that time 
could have envisioned the metropolis 
of 700,000 Americans, let alone that 
they would be denied their funda-
mental American right. 
Let’s cede it to Maryland. Two prob-
lems: Maryland doesn’t want D.C. and 
D.C. doesn’t want to be in Maryland. 
The consent of the governed is a funda-
mental part of the American architec-
ture, which you conveniently overlook. 
And then there is the right to be rep-
resented, another fundamental right 
denied D.C. 
Mr. Speaker, it is partisan politics, 
yes. It is theirs. They want to deny 
700,000 people their right to representa-
tion in this body and in the other body 
because of their politics, or likely poli-
tics. 
When have we ever done that as 
America? We haven’t looked at how 
people would vote before we decide to 
incorporate them into the Union as a 
State. We understood the right of peo-
ple to petition to become a State, and 
Congress has that power. 
Let’s right a wrong, especially in the 
post-George Floyd world, and give peo-
ple their rightful representation in the 
people’s body and in the Senate. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Kentucky (Mr. COMER), my good friend 
and a great member of the Oversight 
Committee. 
Mr. COMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. HICE) 
for his great leadership on this issue. 
At a time when Speaker PELOSI is 
keeping Congress largely on the side-
lines, it is unfortunate that we are 
spending precious work time debating 
blatantly unconstitutional legislation. 
Not only is this measure unconstitu-
tional and dead on arrival in the Sen-
ate, but it should not be a priority for 
this body right now. Our Nation is fac-
ing a serious need for action. We need 
police reform that focuses on trans-
parency and accountability, we need to 
support American workers as States 
safely reopen their communities and 
economies, and we need to ensure that 
money we have spent to fight the 
coronavirus 
is 
effectively 
guarded 
against waste, fraud, and abuse. 
Passing this measure today would 
signal a stunning lack of respect for 
the Constitution. Making Washington, 
D.C., a State would specifically violate 
the intentions of our Founding Fa-
thers, who wanted the national seat of 
government to belong to no State. 
In fact, the Constitution specifically 
calls for Congress, not any State gov-
ernment, to have authority over the 
District serving as the seat of Federal 
Government. 
Granting statehood for Washington, 
D.C., requires a constitutional amend-
ment, just as granting the District 
three electoral college votes required 
the ratification of the 23rd Amend-
ment. 
It is time for Congress to get back to 
full-time work and take up the press-
ing issues facing our country, not play-
ing unconstitutional games. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. RASKIN), my good friend and 
neighbor. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, when in 
the course of human events a relation-
ship stops working and one party expe-
riences a long train of abuses and in-
dignities at the hands of the other, you 
scrap the old relationship and you 
start anew. 
It is nothing personal, but I wish our 
GOP colleagues in the House and Sen-
ate could recognize that this just isn’t 
working out anymore for the people of 
Washington. The relationship you have 
taken for granted for so long with the 
local population is dysfunctional and, 
frankly, abusive. 
Plainly put, the people of Wash-
ington want out. 
It is not just the pepper spray and 
the tear gas and the rubber bullets; it 
is not just crashing their churches and 
desecrating their religion with your 
photo-ops; it is not just the use of their 
sons and daughters in the National 
Guard to put down protests by their 
sons and daughters in the streets; it is 
not just the threats to Federalize their 
local police or the decision to overturn 
their adoption laws, their marijuana 
laws, and their health funding choices; 
or your control of their judges and 
prosecutors; or the constant Presi-
dential insults leveled against their 
chosen leaders; it is not that the GOP 
Members who claim to be the attentive 
partners of the District never listen to 
the people here, never go to their local 
meetings, don’t know the mayor or the 
city council or the ANC members; it is 
not even the $750 million that they just 
cheated the people of Washington out 
of in the middle of this plague. 
It is something deeper. It is not just 
something you did. 
The people of Washington have found 
someone and something else. They 
have voted to break up this dysfunc-
tional relationship with Congress to 
start a healthy and respectful relation-
ship with America. 
In America, States make their own 
local policy and budget decisions with-
out constant tampering and inter-
ference by other people’s representa-
tives. 
In America, every political commu-
nity stands on equal footing through 
statehood. Each one sends two Sen-
ators to the U.S. Senate and voting 
representatives to the House, delega-
tions that guarantee no one will push 
their people around. 
b 0945 
When you are a State, you help de-
cide things like whether your country 
goes to war, who will be your judges 
and supreme court justices, how will 
your Federal tax dollars get spent, and 
what should be the laws of the Nation. 
The only question now is whether 
Congress is mature enough, is man 
enough, to deal with the fact that 
Washington no longer wants to be 
under our thumb. A mature and faith-
ful Congress that wants the best for all 
of its people is not afraid of statehood. 
We celebrate it. We delight in it. 
America started as 13 States, but we 
have exercised our powers under Arti-
cle IV, Section 3, 37 separate times to 
admit 37 new States, all of them by 
simple legislative acts, none of them 
by 
constitutional 
amendment, 
and 
each one was controversial in its own 
way. 
I heard the gentleman say that you 
have to be either a territory or for-
mally part of another State to be ad-
mitted as a State. It is not true. I have 
a one-word answer to that: Texas. It 
was its own independent country. It 
was a republic, and people said that 
was 
unconstitutional 
and 
Congress 
said: No, we are going to favor the tra-
jectory of democratic inclusion and po-
litical equality. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Maryland an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. RASKIN. So every State has 
faced objections. They said Utah was 
too Mormon, and New Mexico was too 
Catholic. Hawaii and Alaska, in 1959, of 
course, they weren’t contiguous; they 
couldn’t be admitted. 
Yes, the District exists now under 
Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, but the 
gentlewoman from the District of Co-
lumbia proposes to shrink the Federal 
district the way it was shrunk in 1847 
because the slave masters of Virginia 
wanted the land back in advance of 
congressional abolition of the slave 
traffic in the District. 
If we can modify the boundaries of 
the Federal district to placate the 
slave masters in the 19th century, we 
can modify the boundaries of the Fed-
eral district in the 21st century to 
grant statehood and equal rights to the 
people of Washington, D.C. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
will just remind my good friend, listen, 
we share the concern if people are 
upset, if it is not working. But the re-
ality is, if it is not working, we have a 
system in this government, in our sys-
tem, to deal with it. And in this case, 
it is called a constitutional amend-
ment. 
Why the Democrats are not pre-
senting a constitutional amendment to

June 26, 2020 
deal with the problem is beyond me, 
but it is what it is. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR), 
my good friend. 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to H.R. 51 
and its affront to the Constitution. 
The Founding Fathers did not intend 
for Washington, D.C., to be a State. Ar-
ticle I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the 
United States Constitution provides 
Congress with exclusive jurisdiction 
over the District of Columbia. The en-
clave clause was included for specific 
reasons, notably the fact that the oper-
ation of the seat of the Federal Govern-
ment of the United States, whose laws 
now affect approximately 330 million 
Americans, should not be impeded by 
local ordinances, actions, or taxation. 
The Framers of the Constitution had 
good reason for this concern, having 
witnessed the reluctance of local au-
thorities to police disorderly conduct 
by protesters in June of 1783, conduct 
that forced the adjournment of Con-
gress and the flight of its Members to 
neighboring States. We see similar sit-
uations playing out in the streets 
today, right here in Washington, D.C. 
Passage of this vote today violates 
the Constitution in two different ways: 
first, withdrawing specifically enumer-
ated powers granting Congress control 
of the Federal district; and, two, ignor-
ing 
the 
constitutional 
amendment 
process the Framers outlined to make 
changes to our founding charter. 
Yesterday, I testified on my amend-
ment to the Rules Committee, which 
reaffirmed and enhanced congressional 
leadership over the District provided in 
the District of Columbia Home Rule 
Act. Unfortunately, my colleagues did 
not accept this amendment, which was 
crafted in the spirit of the Constitu-
tion, pushing this legislation and the 
legal thought behind it even further 
away from our founding tradition. 
The last few months have been very 
difficult times in this country, with 
unrest spanning throughout our Na-
tion, including right here inside Wash-
ington, D.C., itself. In the face of will-
ful disregard for the rule of law, it is ir-
responsible for this body to follow in 
these footsteps by blatantly taking ac-
tion against our Constitution. 
The democratic and legal wisdom of 
our Founders is unprecedented, and 
their calls for a legal charter, which 
granted and preserved individual lib-
erties and good governance, stand true 
today. Going against their intentions 
now is neither prudent nor in the best 
interest of the country. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
H.R. 51. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding and for 
her tremendous leadership over time to 
remove obstacles of participation to 
our democracy, whether it is a voting 
rights act for all, or whether it is ob-
serving the 100th anniversary of women 
having the right to vote, and whether 
it is about giving full participation in 
our democracy to the District of Co-
lumbia. 
I am proud to join her in wearing this 
mask. It says ‘‘51st,’’ and that is why 
this legislation is H.R. 51, D.C. state-
hood, which I will talk about now. 
But 
Congresswoman 
ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON has been brilliant, re-
lentless, persistent, dissatisfied about 
the lack of full participation for her 
constituents in the work of Congress. 
So I salute her as the patron saint and 
guiding star of D.C. statehood, even be-
fore she came to Congress, but since 
she came to Congress, she has worked 
tirelessly and relentlessly to build his-
toric support for this bill. She gives us 
the honor of participating in this his-
toric vote, wherein the House of Rep-
resentatives, for the first time, will 
vote for statehood for the District. 
D.C. statehood, Mr. Speaker, is both 
an official and a personal priority for 
me. My colleagues have heard me say 
this, but I will say it again. When I was 
born, my father was a Member of Con-
gress from Baltimore, Maryland. He 
was on the Appropriations Committee, 
and he served as the chair of the D.C. 
appropriations subcommittee. 
At that time, they tell me, that per-
son would be regarded as the mayor, 
unofficial mayor, of Washington be-
cause that Appropriations Committee 
made all the decisions, so many deci-
sions, for the District of Columbia. He 
was a big supporter of home rule, see-
ing from that perspective the unfair-
ness of it all, a big supporter of home 
rule. 
In any event, he did his job in a way 
to try to make a path, and it passed; 
then later, home rule; then later a 
mayor and the rest; and now, to where 
we are now. 
Yesterday, someone said: Can you 
find middle ground? This is middle 
ground, the status quo. We have to go 
forward. 
I later had the privilege of serving on 
the Appropriations Committee, on the 
District of Columbia subcommittee, 
and I saw the obstacles to home rule 
that some in our Congress would put 
forth, diminishing the self-determina-
tion that the people of the District of 
Columbia should have. 
Statehood for the District is about 
showing respect for our democracy. It 
is not just about the District. It is 
about our democracy, for the American 
people and for our U.S. Constitution, 
yes. 
The Constitution begins with our 
beautiful preamble, ‘‘We the People,’’ 
setting out our Founder’s vision of a 
government of, by, and for the people 
of the United States. It doesn’t say, 
‘‘except for the District of Columbia.’’ 
Yet, for more than two centuries, the 
residents of Washington, D.C., have 
been denied their right to fully partici-
pate in our democracy. Instead, they 
have been dealt the injustice of paying 
taxes, serving in the military, and con-
tributing to the economic power of our 
Nation, while being denied the full en-
franchisement that is their right. Serv-
ing in the military, fighting, risking 
their lives for our democracy, funda-
mental to that democracy is represent-
ative government. They were willing to 
risk their lives for a principle, for a 
value, for our democracy, while where 
they lived was being denied that full 
opportunity. 
Today, by passing H.R. 51, the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act, to admit 
the State of Washington, Douglass 
Commonwealth—State of Washington, 
Douglass 
Commonwealth—to 
the 
Union—that would be Frederick Doug-
lass, from Maryland but who lived in 
the District of Columbia, an aboli-
tionist and a suffragist, actually. He 
was in Seneca Falls at the Conference 
of Women, coming together for women 
having the right to vote, so much 
about our democracy and voting for all 
Americans. 
In doing so today, we will bring our 
Nation closer to the founding ideals 
that all are created equal and all de-
serve a say in our democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge a bipartisan vote, 
I hope, again, but a strong vote in the 
House for this very important legisla-
tion, legislation important to our de-
mocracy, to our Constitution. 
I thank, again, and salute ELEANOR 
HOLMES
NORTON
for her leadership, 
working with our distinguished leader, 
Mr. HOYER, for whom this has been a 
priority. I am proud that this is on the 
floor today. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 181⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentlewoman from the 
District of Columbia has 14 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
would just say again that our Constitu-
tion has representation here in our 
Capitol from the Federation of the 
States, and this district was set apart, 
not to be a State, nor to be influenced 
by one. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Kentucky 
(Mr. 
MASSIE), a great member of the Over-
sight and Reform Committee. 
Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Speaker, if there is 
a constitutional way to turn D.C. into 
a State, this bill is not it. This bill is 
a farcical exercise in legislative virtue 
signaling because it contains a fatal 
constitutional flaw. 
Let’s talk about what this bill 
doesn’t do. This bill doesn’t magically 
convert all of D.C. into a State. This 
bill doesn’t create a new State con-
taining a city called D.C. Because both 
of these clearly violate the Constitu-
tion. 
Some overly clever legislative artists 
think they have found a new loophole, 
a way to create a State in D.C. without 
violating the Constitution. What this 
bill does is it seeks to shrink the city

of D.C. into a tiny city, and then cre-
ates a State from the territory that is 
left over. 
The problem with that is there is the 
23rd Amendment to the Constitution 
that gives the city of D.C. presently 
three electoral votes. Paradoxically, 
the bill itself acknowledges the con-
stitutional flaw within because it con-
tains an expedited procedure to vote on 
the repeal of the 23rd Amendment in 
this Chamber and the Senate Chamber. 
The problem is, the bill keeps plow-
ing forward and would create a new 
State, even if the 23rd Amendment is 
not repealed. This creates the farcical 
situation where the few residents, 
which are the residents at 1600 Penn-
sylvania Avenue, the First Family, 
would control three electoral votes. 
This is crazy. 
So, I urge my colleagues to vote for 
the 
Constitution 
today 
and 
vote 
against H.R. 51. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, the last 
thing we have to be concerned about is 
whether or not the 23rd Amendment 
will be repealed, and the bill, H.R. 51, 
contains an expedited procedure for 
that. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), 
my good neighbor and good friend, the 
majority leader of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I am going 
to leave my mask on, not only because 
it is the safe thing to do for all of you— 
not for me, for you—but also because it 
represents the best of America. 
I am from Maryland. Maryland was a 
slaveholding State. I represent the dis-
trict that probably had the most 
slaves, along with my friend from the 
First Congressional District. 
b 1000 
In fact, there were many sympa-
thizers for the Southern cause that 
would have had Marylanders join the 
Confederacy. They were, of course, 
wrong. But I want to tell my friends 
from those States that withdrew and 
whose States tried to destroy the 
Union that they ought to remember 
that this Nation took them back with-
out condition with full citizenship and 
the right to vote. Surely we can do the 
same for our fellow citizens. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of this bill, and I thank Delegate ELEA-
NOR HOLMES NORTON in her extraor-
dinary quest keeping her eye on the 
prize to make sure that the citizens she 
represents have full citizenship and 
have our respect. I am proud to stand 
with her in supporting statehood for 
the people of the District of Columbia. 
On this mask, there is a drawing of 
the outline of the District of Columbia. 
That is Maryland before the 1789 and 
subsequent actions. That was Mary-
land. I daresay, there is not a Mary-
lander who voted on that secession of 
that land for the Capital of the United 
States who thought to themselves they 
were disenfranchising those who lived 
in that District. 
I want to thank Mayor Bowser, with 
whom I have been proud to work to 
move this issue forward with the lead-
ership of Delegate Holmes Norton. I 
made clear when we announced that 
the House would consider this bill 
today that the people who call our Na-
tion’s Capital home have been disen-
franchised and shortchanged too long. 
Martin Luther King said: How long? 
Too long. 
Not only have the residents of one of 
America’s most historically African- 
American cities—let me repeat that— 
historically, it is one of our largest Af-
rican-American cities. It is not exclu-
sive. It is a diverse city. Very frankly, 
it does not make a decision, if you 
don’t vote for us, we will not allow you 
to vote. 
Hear me: If you don’t vote for us, we 
will not allow you to vote. 
But President Trump says that my 
friends on the other side of the aisle, 
Mr. Speaker, would be foolish to vote 
for this bill. Why? Because we are too 
Democratic and we wouldn’t vote for 
you. 
What do you think the North would 
have done with the 11 States that tried 
to destroy the Union if we had said: 
You are not going to vote for us, so you 
can’t come back—at least, you can’t 
come back with voting rights, and we 
will keep you as subjects, not as citi-
zens? 
I hope every Member who represents 
one of those States thinks about that 
proposition as you vote to exclude 
706,000 of your fellow citizens from full 
participation in our democracy. 
Not only have the residents of one of 
America’s great cities been prevented 
from having full citizenship, but they 
have also been shortchanged in the 
money that we give them. Just re-
cently, COVID–19, we gave them 40 per-
cent of what we gave Wyoming, an en-
tity 200,000 people smaller than the 
District of Columbia. 
I see no heads shaking on the other 
side of the aisle, Mr. Speaker. I see no 
agreement on that. 
Should we say Wyoming is too small 
and that we ought to exclude Wyo-
ming, it is not big enough to be a 
State? 
Yet Wyoming, more than 10 times 
smaller than the State of Maryland 
and, as opposed to 40 million people in 
California, 500,000, one-eightieth of the 
size, have two United States Senators. 
Stand up if you think Wyoming 
ought not to have a vote. 
I see no one standing. 
This constitutional argument is a 
Don Quixote windmill argument. These 
are 706,000 American citizens. At the 
same time, their elected leaders can be 
overruled by Congress and by the 
President when it comes to local 
issues, as we saw when President 
Trump ordered Federal law enforce-
ment and the National Guard to sup-
press peaceful and legitimate protest 
against the killing of Black men and 
women in encounters with the police 
and with others. George Zimmerman 
comes to mind and Trayvon Martin. 
This is about human rights. This is 
about democracy. This is about our Na-
tion being better than that. 
I see my colleague from Maryland 
shaking his head. We disagree. 
The people of D.C. deserve not only 
real self-government, but also full rep-
resentation in the Congress of the 
United States. 
Are these 700,000 people less than the 
500,000 people in Wyoming? 
If we ask somebody to come to the 
District of Columbia and work for our 
government, is the condition that they 
lose their citizenship, that they lose 
their full voting rights? Is that the 
condition we put on them? If so, I re-
spectfully disagree with my colleagues 
who believe that is what America is 
about. 
That is what this historic legislation 
would do, admit Washington, D.C., as 
the 51st State. That would provide resi-
dents of the District of Columbia with 
a voting House Member and two Sen-
ators, as every other group of Ameri-
cans who lives in a jurisdiction called a 
State has the right to have. 
It would right a historical wrong to 
ensure that our Founders’ vision of 
representative government will be en-
acted for all Americans, no longer ex-
cluding the 706,000 in the District of 
Columbia. 
The House will take action today to 
make the District of Columbia a State. 
It is an historic day. 
Be on the right side of history. So 
many voted against the Civil Rights 
Act of the 1960s and years thereafter. 
They were on the wrong side of history. 
The gentleman is absolutely right. 
Somebody mentioned it was Demo-
crats. We were a segregationist party. 
And guess what? We said we do not 
want to be that kind of party, and Hu-
bert Humphrey got up in 1948 in New 
York at a Democratic convention and 
said that we need to come out of the 
dark shadows of slavery and segrega-
tion into the bright sunlight of justice 
and equality. 
Yes, I understand that was our party. 
We said to them: We do not want to be 
that party. 
Don’t you be that party. Don’t you 
have Lincoln turn over in his grave and 
say: That is not our party. 
Yes, I heard the gentleman over 
there. Sadly, in the denial of democ-
racy, the Republican-led Senate has in-
dicated, Mr. Speaker, it will not act, 
just as it has not acted on 275 bipar-
tisan bills that we have sent to the 
United States Senate. They will not 
act. 
The majority of the Senate is elected 
by 18 percent of the American people. 
That is unfortunate, Mr. Speaker, be-
cause this is more than just a local 
issue for the District of Columbia. It is 
a civil rights issue for our country, as 
yesterday was a civil rights issue for 
our country. 
It is something that ought to concern 
all Americans, because when some 
Americans are denied the full rights 
and representation of citizenship, it di-
minishes the meaning of citizenship for

all. Statehood is not merely a status; it 
is a recognition by the rest of the 
States of the sovereign equality of the 
people who live there that they are 
part of the main, not simply an island, 
as the poet reflected, and that they 
cannot be treated as lesser by their fel-
low citizens. 
By admitting Washington, D.C., as a 
State, we will admit what we already 
know to be true: that its people are our 
fellow Americans, equal in their pur-
suit of happiness and their enjoyment 
of the full rights and privileges of 
American citizenship, including rep-
resentation in the Congress of the 
United States. 
Our patriot forebears in the 18th cen-
tury used to cry out, ‘‘No taxation 
without representation.’’ 
The citizens of Boston stole some 
tea, a criminal act, and they threw it 
into the Boston Harbor. Why? They 
said: Because we will not be taxed 
without representation and that King 
George cannot tell us what to do with-
out consulting us. 
Be on the right side of history. Wash-
ington residents correctly still use that 
battle cry in the 21st century. Let us 
make it ring true at last. Let us make 
our Union of States a more perfect one 
by adding to its number as we have 37 
times consistent with the Constitution. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
stand up for America, stand up for de-
mocracy, and stand up for the premise 
of America that every person counts. 
Vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TRONE). Members are reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
feel like the arguments on the other 
side of the aisle are so weak that they 
respond by yelling louder. 
We have just heard a great, pas-
sionate speech about something that is 
totally irrelevant. In fact, the point 
was highlighted that the condition for 
statehood is not population; otherwise, 
we would not have States like Wyo-
ming or Alaska or other States that 
were ever admitted. That is not the 
issue. The issue was that Washington, 
D.C., was set apart as a seat of govern-
ment not to be the same as the federa-
tion of States that our Constitution 
grants us. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. I yield to the 
gentleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman very much for his re-
spect. 
Is the gentleman aware that the Dis-
trict of Columbia was reduced in size 
historically a while back so that the 
land was reduced? 
This is what is happening here. There 
is clear precedent for doing this. 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY), who is my good friend 
and a great leader. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Georgia for yielding. 
I appreciate the opportunity to ad-
dress this important issue and the 
question the gentleman from Maryland 
just asked. I hear the question. 
Yes, their District boundary lines 
have changed in the past, but what the 
majority wants to do today is fun-
damentally alter what Washington, 
D.C., is. That is what is at stake here. 
I would love to hear the gentleman 
from Maryland expound on his support 
and belief in our electoral college 
since, suddenly, my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle have a newfound 
respect for the power of States and the 
importance of States. I would love to 
hear them expound on that. 
I would love to hear my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle talk about 
what is critical about community and 
about respecting the ability of people 
to live differently in order for us to 
agree to disagree, to allow Texas to be 
Texas, California to be California. I 
would like love to hear my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle expound 
on these principles. 
This is about power. That is what 
this is about. Let’s make no mistake 
about it. D.C., I do not believe, should 
become a State—and I use that word 
importantly, should not become a 
State. 
We can talk about the constitutional 
infirmities with what the majority is 
trying to do. My colleagues are doing 
that, and they have laid that out. 
The Constitution speaks to creating 
the Federal city in Washington, D.C. 
The Founders wanted to do that for a 
reason. We wanted this seat to be com-
pletely unintertwined and separated 
from other States. We wanted it to be 
special and unique and not subject to 
the powers and the struggles that go on 
about the people in a certain State. 
That is what is at stake here. 
I would note that my friends, Mr. 
RASKIN, Mr. CONNOLLY, Mr. HOYER, and 
Mr. BEYER, are the first to rattle—the 
very first to rattle—if we dare go down 
the road of potential shutdown, if we 
dare go down the road of limiting the 
size and scope of the Federal Govern-
ment. Why? Because the jurisdictions 
they represent are wholly and heavily 
dependent on this Federal Government. 
I am a proud Texan dating back to 
the 1850s, but I grew up in Loudoun 
County, Virginia, and went to the Uni-
versity of Virginia. When I grew up in 
Loudoun County, it was 80 percent dirt 
roads. There was one stoplight in my 
entire school district. It was a rural 
county fully separated from Wash-
ington, D.C., and now it is the richest 
per capita county in the United States 
of America because leviathan grows. 
b 1015 
It is because leviathan continues to 
separate from the real Americans out 
there—the people throughout the en-
tire country who are not being rep-
resented by this body. 
If we want to talk about representa-
tion, then let’s talk about this body 
doing its job to represent the people, 
the forgotten man. The American peo-
ple are tired of watching their country 
burning to the ground, statutes being 
toppled, people getting killed in the 
streets. And we are spending time here 
today on an unconstitutional effort to 
create a State out of a Federal city 
that the Constitution contemplated 
being separated so that it could be 
unique and be the power seat of this 
great country. 
Mr. Speaker, that is what this is 
about. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Maryland State (Mr. SAR-
BANES), my good friend, that ceded land 
in perpetuity out of which the District 
of Columbia was formed. 
Mr. 
SARBANES. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentlewoman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, our colleague across the 
aisle a moment ago talked about the 
District of Columbia being special. 
There is nothing special about being 
second class, which is what has hap-
pened to the residents of the District. 
For two centuries, the people of the 
District of Columbia have been disen-
franchised, denied fair representation, 
excluded from our great democratic ex-
periment. Over 700,000 residents—who 
just like my constituents and your 
constituents—work 
hard, 
pay 
their 
taxes, and contribute every day to the 
betterment of our society. Yet, they do 
not have an equal voice in this Cham-
ber. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to remedy 
this great injustice. ELEANOR HOLMES 
NORTON should have the same oppor-
tunity that every one of our Members 
does: To see her name on that board for 
every vote, to walk into the well and 
cast her ‘‘yea’’ or ‘‘nay’’ on behalf of 
the constituents she represents. 
We thank Congresswoman NORTON 
for her service and for her tireless fight 
to bring dignity to the residents of 
Washington, D.C. 
House Democrats committed to this 
moment when this body passed H.R. 1 
more than a year ago. We observed 
then and we reiterate today: There are 
no constitutional, historical, financial, 
or economic reasons why the 700,000 
Americans who live in the District of 
Columbia should not be granted State-
hood. 
At a time when Americans of all po-
litical stripes are demanding a greater 
voice and participation in the political 
town square, the residents of D.C. are 
being forcibly kept out of the town 
square by this bizarre and indefensible 
anachronism. 
Today, we are declaring enough is 
enough. It is time to give a voice and a 
vote to the residents of the District of 
Columbia. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 51. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, to 
somehow try to paint a picture that 
D.C. is a second-class city is absolute 
absurdity. Without question, this is the 
most influential city in this country— 
perhaps in the world.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2538 
June 26, 2020 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN), my friend. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, first 
of all, a little comment, maybe clear-
ing things up. I will point out to every-
one in the room that when we say the 
Pledge of Allegiance, the phrase ‘‘to 
the Republic for which it stands’’ is in 
the pledge. And I think we all remem-
ber the memorable comment of Ben-
jamin Franklin at a time around when 
the 
Constitution 
was 
drafted. 
He 
talked about he was giving us ‘‘a Re-
public, if we can keep it.’’ 
Now, at the time the Constitution 
was drafted, our forefathers did include 
a district, which would be the capital 
for the country. Our forefathers put to-
gether the United States and reached a 
compromise between the 13 States. 
They realized at the time it would be 
ridiculous to break apart a State and 
give it two Senators, like all of the 
other States. In part, that is because it 
is so different and has such a different 
interest in the States. 
All of the States, the 50 States, to a 
variety of degree, have been given an 
amount of agriculture. There is vir-
tually no agriculture—maybe no agri-
culture—maybe somewhere there is a 
greenhouse or something in the Dis-
trict of Columbia. There is no manufac-
turing. There is no mining or logging. 
Or if there is, it is so tiny we can bare-
ly see it. 
Mr. Speaker, it is a unique city be-
cause it is based on government jobs 
and tourist jobs connected to people 
coming and visiting those government 
buildings. It is not like any other State 
out there. If it were to become a State, 
its representatives would have spent 
all their time almost devoted to get-
ting more money for the city. And al-
ready the Federal Government puts a 
great deal of money into the city. You 
couldn’t complain that they do not 
have enough funds for their schools or 
their city. I believe their schools are 
somewhere in the top—if you consid-
ered it a State—somewhere in the top 
three or four in the country, as far as 
funding per person. 
Mr. Speaker, it would make no sense, 
say, for Wisconsin to break off and give 
two Senators to Milwaukee and give 
two Senators to the rest of the State. 
Milwaukee is not a State. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Ms. KELLY). 
Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 51. 
For more than 200 years, Americans 
living in the District of Columbia— 
many of whom serve the people of this 
great Nation as public servants—have 
been denied the right to self-govern-
ment. That is a founding principle of 
our great Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, today, D.C. is home to 
more than 700,000 Americans and, yet, 
they have no voting Members of Con-
gress and no voice in the Senate. 
Establishing Washington, Douglass 
Commonwealth would not create our 
Nation’s smallest State by population, 
nor would it be reliant on the Federal 
Government to survive. 
There are States with smaller popu-
lations and many other States that are 
far more dependent on Federal assist-
ance. 
Despite paying more in total Federal 
income tax than the residents of 22 
other States, D.C. is continually treat-
ed like a territory instead of a State in 
funding bills. These calculations starve 
the local government of the funds they 
rightly deserve. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
listen to the voice of our Founding Fa-
thers, who we keep hearing about. ‘‘No 
taxation 
without 
representation.’’ 
Well, D.C. pays its taxes. It deserves a 
voice in Congress. And let’s be clear 
about who is playing politics. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT), my good friend 
and a great leader. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is 
amazing to hear people that have been 
trained in the Constitution disregard it 
so. But we are taught at law school the 
ability to rationalize absolutely any-
thing. But the fact is, Article I, Sec-
tion 8, there is not one of the 37 States 
that have been brought in by Congress 
that is addressed in the Constitution 
like this district is. And it says specifi-
cally—this is the right of Congress— 
‘‘To exercise exclusive legislation in all 
cases whatsoever, over such District 
(not exceeding 10 miles square)’’—that 
is this one—‘‘as may, by cession of par-
ticular States and the acceptance of 
Congress, become the seat of Govern-
ment of the United States.’’ 
And if you go back and look at Fed-
eralist Paper 43, you look at the debate 
at the time, they understood. We have 
had the capital in New York City. We 
have had it in Philadelphia. And that is 
dangerous. Because it means if you are 
surrounded by a State and the capital 
is part of that State or in the middle 
surrounded by the State, then pressure 
can be brought to bear that would be so 
unfair. Look at the debate. That is why 
that is in there, to protect that. 
Mr. Speaker, now, one of the things 
that we agree on is that it is wrong to 
make the residents of the District of 
Columbia pay income tax. I have been 
filing a bill since 2008, I think it was, 
that would eliminate the Federal tax. 
None of the territories—who also don’t 
have full voting Members of Congress— 
pay Federal income tax. D.C. shouldn’t 
either. That is a legislative fix we can 
do. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining for each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 9 minutes re-
maining. The gentlewoman from Wash-
ington, D.C. has 10 minutes remaining. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I say to 
the gentleman, paying Federal taxes, 
that says everything about the desire 
of citizens of Washington, D.C. to be 
equal, that we are quite willing to con-
tinue to pay Federal income tax. 
And I appreciate his amendment. We 
have rejected his amendment because 
we want to be full citizens. That means 
paying our share. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT), my good friend. 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, as a 
Member representing the territories, I 
would rather pay taxes than have the 
treatment that this body gives to those 
that live in the territories. I believe it 
is the greatest scam and an okey-doke 
that you have allowed us not to pay 
taxes and hold that against us to ask 
for our equal treatment. So keep pay-
ing those taxes and you will get your 
Statehood one day. 
Mr. Speaker, the United States terri-
tories that I represent are also not on 
equal footing with the rest of the Na-
tion. There is no representation in the 
U.S. Senate. No equal voting represen-
tation in the House of Representatives. 
Unlike D.C., we cannot vote for Presi-
dent. We know what it is like to be 
part of the greatest country in the 
world but not a full participant, and it 
feels incomplete. 
As Americans, we strive to be pro-
ductive citizens and an asset to the Na-
tion. Statehood for D.C. is a matter of 
fairness that has been slow in coming. 
This city, built by African Americans 
with the use of forced labor, contrib-
utes more in Federal taxes on a per 
person basis than many States. It is a 
punishment to Americans living in the 
capital, including those working in pol-
icy or public service for the good of the 
Nation, to be disenfranchised when 
they establish a home in the District. 
This body changed the boundaries in 
the 1800s to ensure that slave owners 
could keep their slaves. We have 
changed the boundaries in the com-
mittee to allow for the Federal city to 
still exist and the residents of D.C. to 
become a State. It has been done by 
this body before. Don’t make it seem 
like it is something that can’t happen 
again. At this very moment, citizens 
across this Nation are clamoring for 
change, equality, and justice. With one 
vote, we can deliver that for the people 
of D.C. 
Mr. Speaker, it is time to do what is 
right and allow the people of this city 
to feel whole, to feel complete, to feel 
like they matter. Support H.R. 51. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, it 
certainly can happen. It just requires a 
constitutional amendment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Maryland (Mr. HAR-
RIS), my good friend. 
Mr. HARRIS. Mr. Speaker, I hope 
America is watching what is going on 
on the floor today, and they are paying 
careful attention to this debate. 
We hear speaker after speaker from 
the other side of the aisle say things 
like, ‘‘It has been done before.’’ The 
majority leader: ‘‘Clear precedent.’’ 
Yeah, there is clear precedent. We 
know the person who was in the Chair 
just before comes from the State that 
actually was the clear precedent: In

1847, when retrocession occurred. You 
know, my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle say this isn’t politics. This 
is about getting voting rights. This is 
about things like this. I would suggest 
that perhaps the people watching go to 
Wikipedia and see what the history is 
about the support for retrocession back 
to Maryland. 
Mr. Speaker, because, you see, this is 
not Congress’s land. This is Maryland’s 
land. Maryland gave it to the United 
States for the sole purpose of a perma-
nent, Federal enclave. The nerve of 
hundreds of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle thinking it is their 
land. It is Maryland’s land. And if you 
want voting rights, it is simple: Do ex-
actly what occurred in 1847 and give 
the land back to Maryland. 
But, whoa, wait a minute. That is not 
what this debate is about, because ret-
rocession has been proposed many 
times with no Democrat supporters. In 
fact, the majority leader was in Con-
gress when these bills were proposed. If 
what he really wants is voting rights, 
he should have cosponsored the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, you know that if ret-
rocession occurs, every single resi-
dent—except those ones in the White 
House—because of the amendment to 
the Constitution they actually get 
three electoral votes under this pro-
posed legislation, every single one of 
those residents would have representa-
tion in Congress. And, yes, ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON could sit in Congress 
representing people from the State of 
Maryland. 
b 1030 
This is a pure political ploy. That is 
why none of my colleagues from Mary-
land are going to vote against this bill 
today. That is why none of my col-
leagues from Maryland have put in a 
retrocession bill. That is why all of my 
hundreds of colleagues across the aisle 
are going to pretend this is Congress’ 
land. This is not. 
The Constitution is clear. If this land 
is given back to Maryland, Maryland 
has to accept. 
Well, the argument is that Maryland 
doesn’t want it back. That is inter-
esting. I sat in the Maryland legisla-
ture with my colleague, who is sitting 
across the aisle right now. If our rep-
resentatives from Maryland are so con-
cerned about getting voting rights, it 
is very simple. Go to their colleagues 
in the Maryland General Assembly, 
fully controlled by the Democrats, and 
say: ‘‘Let’s take it back. Let’s give 
those 700,000 people voting rights.’’ 
Mr. Speaker, that is the correct ap-
proach. Don’t steal this land from 
Maryland. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, impor-
tant to note that Maryland perma-
nently ceded the land that now is part 
of the District of Columbia. You can’t 
get back what you permanently ceded. 
And it is important to note that we 
have had several Members from Mary-
land speak. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Maryland 
(Mr. 
MFUME). 
Mr. MFUME. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
thank the distinguished Delegate, the 
congressperson from Washington, D.C., 
for her steadfast leadership on this. 
I had the opportunity to work with 
her predecessor back in the late 1980s 
in 
this 
Chamber, 
Delegate 
Walter 
Fauntroy, who passed the torch, and 
the Delegate has done a great job. 
It took 27 years to get this vote back 
onto the floor. I was there in 1993 when 
we came up short. Today, I am hoping 
and praying that this bill passes. 
I want to congratulate you on that 
and to remind others that this is not 
going to go away because, at the end of 
the day, this is really about taxation 
without representation, one of the 
original 27 colonial grievances filed 
against the King, which was a major 
cause of the Revolutionary War. 
So when people in Boston had the 
Tea Party and threw tea in the Boston 
Harbor in December of 1773, they were 
making a statement and setting an ex-
ample for people across this Nation to 
understand that we just can’t tax peo-
ple without allowing them to be rep-
resented. 
You have heard the great discussions, 
the cogent points about the fiscal side 
of this, that D.C. residents pay more 
taxes per capita than any other State, 
that they pay more general taxes than 
22 States, that they have a budget larg-
er than 11 States, and a bond rating 
better than almost 30 other States. 
I have heard this discussion when it 
comes to fiscal matters about the con-
stitutional federation of States, the 
great words of Hamilton and the Fed-
eralists and the Federalist Papers. I 
understand that. 
But one thing we have to remember 
when we raise Hamilton and talk about 
the Federalists is that their stated be-
lief was the Constitution was meant to 
evolve, that it was a living document. 
That is not my impression. That is the 
impression and the opinion of the Fed-
eralists. 
If that were not true, I could not be 
here as a descendant of a slave without 
the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. 
The distinguished woman couldn’t be 
here. She had not the right to vote 
under the Federalist Papers. Alaska 
and Hawaii, when I was born, were not 
States. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, 
the Constitution can change by amend-
ment only. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
Alabama 
(Mr. 
BROOKS). 
Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speak-
er, I will never vote to give Wash-
ington, D.C., separate statehood status. 
Washington, D.C., is a city, not a 
State. Its population is roughly one- 
seventh that of Alabama. 
To add perspective, giving D.C. state-
hood is the equivalent of giving Jeffer-
son County, Alabama, or the Tennessee 
Valley separate statehood status. That 
is nuts. 
History is in order. The District of 
Columbia originally was 100 square 
miles, 10-miles square. Part of D.C. was 
in Maryland; part was in Virginia. 
In 1847, the Virginia part of the Dis-
trict of Columbia was given back to 
Virginia, leaving only the Maryland 
portion of D.C. still in D.C. 
These former D.C., now Virginia, 
residents gained the right to vote on 
U.S. Senators once Senators became 
elected rather than appointed. 
If D.C. residents want to vote on U.S. 
Senators, fine. That can be done by fol-
lowing historical precedence and giving 
the residential portion of D.C. back to 
Maryland, keeping the Federal Govern-
ment 
portion, 
the 
Capitol, 
White 
House, monuments, The Mall, Federal 
buildings, and the like in D.C. 
But this option won’t be offered by 
Democrats because they don’t care one 
twit about D.C. residents voting on 
U.S. Senators. Rather, their goal is to 
have two more guaranteed leftwing 
Senators. 
If offered, I will vote to return resi-
dential portions of D.C. to Maryland, 
thus giving D.C. citizens the power to 
vote on Maryland’s two U.S. Senators. 
That option is consistent with histor-
ical precedence. 
But I will never vote to give a single 
middling-size city the same political 
power as one of America’s great 50 
States. I will never support this sham 
that is motivated by crass partisan po-
litical power, not a desire to let citi-
zens of the District of Columbia vote 
on U.S. Senators. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from the District of Colum-
bia has 51⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. WATERS), my friend and the 
chair of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
support H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. 
Admission Act, which would end cen-
turies of taxation without representa-
tion and make Washington, D.C., the 
51st State. 
And nobody is giving back anything. 
Washington, D.C., is the home to more 
Americans than two States, and more 
than 46 percent of its 700,000 residents 
are Black. 
Make no mistake, race underlies 
every argument against D.C. state-
hood, and denying its citizens equal 
participation and representation is a 
racial, democratic, and economic injus-
tice we cannot tolerate. 
It must be acknowledged that the 
chance to right these wrongs with to-
day’s vote would not be possible with-
out my good friend, ELEANOR HOLMES 
NORTON. We were both elected at the 
same time, and she has been dogged 
and consistent every single year since 
then in her fight for this bill and D.C. 
statehood. 
I am so pleased to join my friend in 
today’s milestone vote, and I am hope-
ful that ELEANOR’s long effort will fi-
nally give D.C. the rights they deserve.

June 26, 2020 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
have no further speakers. I am pre-
pared to close, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BUTTERFIELD). 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank Delegate ELEANOR HOLMES NOR-
TON for her years of leadership on this 
issue. 
Mr. Speaker, from 1910 through 1970, 
thousands of African Americans from 
my district, and from your district, Mr. 
HICE, migrated to Washington, D.C., 
seeking employment and better oppor-
tunities than existed in the segregated 
South. They work and worship, and 
they pay their taxes. They own and op-
erate businesses here in D.C. They 
teach in the public schools. They are 
Capitol Police. They clean our offices. 
I know very well that some of Ms. 
HOLMES NORTON’s ancestors originated 
in my congressional district. 
Mr. Speaker, D.C. residents pay the 
highest per capita Federal income 
taxes in the country. They pay more 
Federal taxes than residents of 22 
States. It is a grave injustice that they 
don’t have representation in this body. 
It is time to say to the citizens of 
this city that they, too, are American 
citizens and deserve to be part of this 
great Union, with full rights of citizen-
ship. 
What they don’t need to hear on this 
floor today is for Members to say, ‘‘I 
will never vote for D.C. statehood.’’ 
That is irresponsible. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Georgia 
(Mr. JOHNSON). 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, Article IV, Section 3.1, provides 
that new States may be admitted by 
Congress into this Union. There is ab-
solutely no requirement for a constitu-
tional amendment. 
I was born and raised in Washington, 
D.C., spending my formative years in 
this great domain, and I grew up know-
ing that my parents paid taxes but had 
no voting representation in Congress. 
It was paradoxical that I learned in 
school that the cries of patriots, ‘‘No 
taxation without representation,’’ did 
not apply to the people of this great 
domain. 
We obeyed the same laws and paid 
the same taxes as our fellow Ameri-
cans, but we had no hope in taking part 
in the governance of America. 
I 
thank 
the 
Delegate 
ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON for keeping hope alive. 
I am here today to say that it is time 
to end the legal disenfranchisement of 
a population larger than the States of 
Vermont and Wyoming. This vote is 
long overdue, and I intend to vote in 
favor of D.C. statehood, and I encour-
age my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. May I inquire 
as to how much time I have remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Georgia has 4 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Michigan (Ms. STEVENS). 
Ms. STEVENS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my esteemed and tireless colleague 
from the District of Columbia, Con-
gresswoman HOLMES NORTON. 
In this very Chamber, we have, 
throughout our Nation’s history, long 
debated statehood for many lands and 
many people, and adding new States we 
have. 
In 1837, Michigan statehood was 
passed by Congress as the 26th State 
and signed by President Jackson, who 
proudly stated Michigan was ‘‘admit-
ted into the Union on an equal footing 
with the original States in all re-
spects.’’ 
In 1959, as we added Hawaii to the 
Union, the Secretary of the Interior de-
clared: ‘‘The great statehood of Hawaii 
will be granted and prove to the world 
. . . that we practice what we preach.’’ 
Now, as we add Washington, D.C., and 
recognize the over 700,000 people, hun-
dreds of thousands of Federal tax-
paying people, to this Union, we reaf-
firm, we restore, and we continue to 
flourish our democracy that manifests 
to promote the general welfare. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire as to how much time I have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from the District of Colum-
bia has 11⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds 
to 
the 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
want to give all acknowledgment to 
the outstanding gentlewoman, ELEA-
NOR HOLMES NORTON. 
President 
Washington 
said: 
‘‘The 
Constitution is the guide which I will 
never abandon.’’ Nothing in the Con-
stitution says that we cannot make the 
Washington State the Douglass Com-
monwealth. Frederick Douglass said 
there is no power without struggle. 
The sons and daughters of Wash-
ington, D.C., laid down their lives for 
this country in World Wars. They stand 
for this country in service to this gov-
ernment. Why are we denying them 
their rights? 
Alaska has 700,000-plus people. There 
is no population requirement. Make 
Washington, D.C., a State now. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary, as an original co-
sponsor of the legislation, I rise in strong and 
enthusiastic support of H.R. 51, the ‘‘Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act,’’ which declares 
the State of Washington, Douglass Common-
wealth, to be a State of the United States of 
America, and declares its admission into the 
Union on an equal footing with the other 
States in all respects whatsoever. 
George Washington, the nation’s first Chief 
Executive, and the President of the Constitu-
tional Convention which met in Philadelphia, 
said: ‘‘The Constitution is a guide which I will 
never abandon.’’ 
The action we are taking today to admit the 
State of Washington, Douglass Common-
wealth, as the 51st state of the Union is con-
sistent with the authority vested in the Con-
gress by the Constitution in Article IV, section 
3, clause 1. 
The Constitution does not specify a min-
imum population or acreage test that a state 
must meet to gain admission to the Union, 
rather leave the determination to be made in 
the sound judgment of the Congress, which 
admitted Wyoming which has more than 
200,000 fewer persons than the District of Co-
lumbia, and Alaska, which had only 224,000 
persons when it was admitted as a state in 
1959. 
Mr. Speaker, in doing passing this legisla-
tion, we remove a stain that has blighted our 
nation for more than 200 years. 
I thank Congresswoman ELEANOR HOLMES 
NORTON, my colleague and the representative 
of the 706,000 residents of the District of Co-
lumbia, for her tireless and relentless efforts in 
shepherding this legislation to the floor today. 
Mr. Speaker, in his famous 1857 oration in 
Candaigua, New York, the great abolitionist, 
Frederick Douglass, said: ‘‘If there is no strug-
gle there is no progress. Those who profess to 
favor freedom and yet deprecate agitation are 
men who want crops without plowing up the 
ground; they want rain without thunder and 
lightning. They want the ocean without the 
awful roar of its many waters.’’ 
The vote we are about to cast today is long 
time in coming but shows that struggle can 
lead to progress, that truth crushed to earth 
shall rise again, that justice cannot be denied. 
Today, we vote to end two centuries of 
shame and correct an injustice to the citizens 
of the District of Columbia. 
Mr. Speaker, let us not lose sight of one in-
disputable and shameful fact: over 700,000 
people living in the District of Columbia lack 
direct voting representation in the House of 
Representatives and Senate. 
Specifically, the citizens of the District of 
Columbia pay more in federal taxes than 22 
states and pay more in federal taxes per cap-
ita than any state. 
The 
District 
of 
Columbia’s 
population 
(705,000) is larger than the populations of Wy-
oming and Vermont, and seven states had 
populations under one million in the last cen-
sus. 
The District of Columbia’s annual budget 
($15.5 billion) is larger than the budgets of 14 
states. 
The District of Columbia has a higher per 
capita personal income and gross domestic 
product than any state. 
District of Columbia residents have fought 
and died in every American war, including the 
Revolution itself, and almost 200,000 District 
residents have served in the military since 
World War I alone. 
Approximately 30,000 veterans live in the 
District of Columbia, and it should be noted 
that during the Vietnam War, 243 District resi-
dents were casualties of war, a casualty figure 
greater than that observed by 10 different 
states. 
So, Mr. Speaker, it is undisputable that resi-
dents of the District of Columbia serve in the 
military, pay billions of dollars in federal taxes 
each year, and assume other responsibilities 
of U.S. citizenship. 
But for over 200 years, the District of Co-
lumbia has been denied voting representation

in Congress—the entity that has ultimate au-
thority over all aspects of the city’s legislative, 
executive, and judicial functions. 
Mr. Speaker, if a person can be called upon 
to pay federal taxes and serve in the armed 
forces of the United States, then he or she 
should at least have the opportunity to vote for 
a representative who could at least cast a 
symbolic vote in this chamber on critical mat-
ters facing our nation. 
Issues like war and peace, equality and jus-
tice. 
And tear-gassing peaceful protestors in La-
fayette Square exercising their First Amend-
ment rights. 
Mr. Speaker, taxation with representation is 
tyranny. 
H.R. 51 would create a state from essen-
tially the eight hometown wards of the District 
of Columbia and provides that the new state 
would be equal to the other 50 states in all re-
spects, and that the residents of the State of 
Washington, D.C. would have all the rights of 
statehood, including voting representation in 
Congress and full local self-government. 
Under the legislation this new state would 
have no jurisdiction over the reduced federal 
district, which would consist of the area that 
Members of Congress and visitors associate 
with the capital of our country: the U.S. Cap-
itol, the U.S. Supreme Court, the White 
House, the principal federal monuments, and 
the federal buildings and grounds adjacent to 
the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol. 
It is unconscionable that 700,000 Americans 
are being unconscionably denied a vote and a 
voice in the most important legislative body in 
the world. 
As a supporter of freedom, democracy, and 
equality, I believe that it is long overdue for 
the citizens of the District of Columbia to have 
representation in the House and the Senate to 
advocate for their interests on vital matters 
coming before the Congress of the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, it is wrong that we must be re-
minded daily by license plates in the District of 
Columbia that ‘‘Taxation without representa-
tion is tyranny.’’ 
The people in Boston felt so strongly about 
this in 1775 that they rebelled in Boston Har-
bor, launching the ‘‘Boston Tea Party.’’ 
The principle that political authority derives 
from the consent of the government is no less 
applicable when it comes to the District of Co-
lumbia. 
Let us be clear, there is no dispute that hun-
dreds of thousands of American citizens re-
side in the District of Columbia. 
We all agree that universal suffrage is the 
hallmark of a democratic regime, of which the 
United States is the world’s leading exemplar. 
None of us believes it is fair that citizens of 
the District of Columbia pay federal taxes, risk 
life and limb fighting wars abroad to protect 
American democracy and extend the blessings 
of liberty to people living in foreign lands. 
In short, there is no moral reason to deny 
the citizens of the District of Columbia admis-
sion as a state in the United States and the 
right to full representation in Congress. 
The only question is whether Congress has 
the will and the constitutional authority to do 
so. 
Congress has always had the constitutional 
authority but for much of the last 200 years, it 
has not had the will. 
Let us change that, beginning today with our 
vote to pass H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. 
Admission Act. 
b 1045 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
seconds to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
am intrigued listening to my col-
leagues waxing eloquent about the di-
vine creation of the District of Colum-
bia. Give me a break. It was old-fash-
ioned horse trading between Hamilton, 
Madison, and Jefferson like the dec-
laration of enslaved people being three- 
fifths of a person without being able to 
vote for themselves, just simply power 
for White people. 
It is time to recognize the reality of 
what I think was a corrupt bargain and 
give the District of Columbia the state-
hood it deserves. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Despite the passionate arguments 
that we have heard today regarding 
H.R. 51, the plain truth is that Wash-
ington, D.C.’s status as the Capital of 
the United States is exactly as our 
Founders intended. 
To be clear, Washington, D.C., is a vi-
brant and special city holding a unique 
position in our Nation’s Federal sys-
tem. Our Nation’s Capital does not 
exist within one State, and therefore, 
it is free from the influence of any 
State. That is exactly the intention of 
our Constitution and our Founders. 
But not only is the Constitution pro-
posal going to be a violation of our 
Constitution, but practically speaking, 
D.C. is not prepared financially and 
otherwise as a microstate. 
Currently, Washington, D.C., only 
raises about half of its annual budget 
through local taxes, despite the fact 
that they have some of the highest 
taxes in the Nation. This shows a lack 
of financial readiness for the responsi-
bility of statehood. 
Congress has already dealt with this 
in the past, and D.C.’s financial situa-
tion, we bailed it out in the 1990s after 
20 years of troubled self-rule. 
The majority’s bill does not take into 
account how these budgetary shortfalls 
would be remedied or how the tax-
payers would be relieved. Statehood 
first, the details later, that is the ma-
jority’s proposal. 
In seeking to gain an extra two seats 
in the Senate, Democrats would strip 
this great historic city of its special 
status and make it a shell state. The 
Democrat’s statehood proposal leaves 
us with a State in name only, and a 
tiny remnant of a Federal district. 
This is far from the intent of our 
Founding Fathers. 
We live in a federation, a federation 
of States. I would say there is no one 
who is a greater supporter of States’ 
rights than I am, but because I believe 
in States’ rights, I cannot support this 
city becoming a State. 
D.C. is simply not equipped to shoul-
der the burden of statehood. If Demo-
crats were serious about granting rep-
resentation to the citizens of D.C., they 
would consider retroceding the land 
back to Maryland, as has been pro-
posed, but that has been rejected over 
and over. If D.C.’s citizens rejoin Mary-
land, they would gain the Senate and 
House representation that supposedly 
is what this bill is after. 
But this statehood proposal is about 
politics all dressed up in noble argu-
ments about disenfranchising and tax-
ation without representation. It is just 
a big sham. 
The Constitution is clear. A new 
State can be formed from Federal ter-
ritories or from existing States with 
their permission. But the current Fed-
eral district is not an existing State, 
nor is it a territory. It is unique, and 
our Framers specifically crafted the 
Constitution with a maximum size for 
the District, so as to prevent it from 
becoming a State. 
We have been over this time and 
again, but H.R. 51 changes the clear in-
tentions of our Founders. By making 
the District a State, we are going ex-
actly against the intent of our Framers 
and the intentions of our Constitution. 
The Framers crafted our Constitution 
with the direct intent that we would 
have a unique district, the seat of our 
Federal Government that is not influ-
enced by a State. That is what we 
have, and that is what we need to keep. 
H.R. 51 disregards the Constitution, 
and we cannot take this lightly. I ask 
my colleagues to oppose this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, how 
much time do I have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from the District of Colum-
bia has 30 seconds remaining. 
Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
This bill allows our country to live 
up to its claim to be a democracy. We 
stand out as the only democracy which 
denies democracy to the residents of 
its own Capital City. 
Our claim to world leadership is 
marred until, with this bill, the resi-
dents of our Capital are equal in citi-
zenship to the citizens of every Member 
of the House of Representatives. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 51, the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act—a bill long over-
due and exceedingly necessary. 
This is a measure that I have supported 
since my inaugural term in the House of Rep-
resentatives, 27 years ago, when I cospon-
sored Representative HOLMES NORTON’s sec-
ond-ever statehood bill. Her continued leader-
ship and tenacity on this issue as the Dele-
gate from Washington, D.C. is nothing short of 
extraordinary, and it is because of her efforts 
that today we vote on a statehood bill for the 
first time in almost three decades. 
For too long, the over-700,000 residents of 
the District of Columbia been denied voting 
representation while still paying taxes, serving 
in our military, and adhering to federal laws. 
Think of that—here, in the greatest legislative 
and deliberative body in the world, we rou-
tinely prevent hundreds of thousands of our

citizens, half of which are African American, 
from having their voices heard. The admission 
of D.C. as a state and redesignation as the 
Douglass Commonwealth will not only extend 
rights and liberties to its residents but, in doing 
so, honor the memory of the iconic abolitionist 
and D.C. native Frederick Douglass. 
Mr. Speaker, as over half of the Members of 
the House of Representatives are already co-
sponsoring H.R. 51, I do not doubt that it will 
pass. I urge those remaining who have not co-
sponsored this bill to stand on the right side of 
history and support this bill. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of D.C. statehood. Today’s 
affirmative vote in the House of Representa-
tives to admit the State of Washington, Doug-
lass Commonwealth as the 51st state in the 
Union is long overdue for the more than 
700,000 disenfranchised American citizens 
who currently live in the District of Columbia. 
This is the first time a chamber of Congress 
has voted to approve D.C. statehood. I have 
long been a proponent of D.C. statehood and 
was the only member of the Virginia delega-
tion to vote for D.C. statehood the last time it 
came before the House in 1993. And during 
my service as a member of the Virginia House 
of Delegates, I introduced the resolution for 
Virginia to ratify the Constitutional Amendment 
to grant full Congressional voting rights to the 
District of Columbia. Unfortunately, neither my 
resolution nor the Constitutional Amendment 
were ultimately successful. 
Today’s vote marks a historic victory for the 
indefatigable advocates for statehood includ-
ing my colleague, Congresswoman ELEANOR 
HOLMES NORTON, who has been a tireless ad-
vocate for the disenfranchised citizens of our 
nation’s capital. Supporting D.C. statehood is 
about our nation’s core constitutional prin-
ciples of self-determination, opposition to tax-
ation without representation, and giving an 
equal voice to all Americans regardless of 
where they live. I hope my Republican col-
leagues in the Senate put aside politics and 
pass this bill and finally end the historic injus-
tice that has persisted for more than 200 
years for the people of Washington, D.C. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of H.R. 51—the Wash-
ington, D.C. Admission Act—introduced by my 
colleague, Del. ELEANOR
HOLMES
NORTON. 
This bill would not only establish the District of 
Columbia (‘‘D.C.’’) as the 51st state of the 
United States, but it would also grant long 
overdue voting representation at the federal 
level to the residents of D.C. 
I remain committed to the principles this 
country boasts: democracy and representa-
tion. Since 1801, the residents of D.C. have 
been denied federal representation. They pay 
their taxes and have fought and died in every 
American war, yet those armed service mem-
bers and their families are deprived of the 
freedoms they have fought to protect. State-
hood is the only remedy that provides full rep-
resentation in Congress for the residents of 
Washington, D.C. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1017, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment

Mr. KELLER (during the reading). 
Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent 
to dispense with the reading. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 min-
utes in support of his motion. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to 
talk about how for over 200 years law-
makers have come from every State in 
the Union to work and live in this Dis-
trict. 
The city was not meant to be a prize 
of conquest like the ancient walled cit-
ies of Europe. It was not meant to be 
the hub of trade like the early Amer-
ican cities. Above anything, it was 
meant to represent a center of the fed-
eration created by our Constitution. 
The city is tied to the idea of the 
American Republic, a living piece of 
collaboration, the star on the map rep-
resenting the 50 stars on the flag. 
With the creation of a 51st State of 
Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, 
a State the size of a small county, that 
collaboration will be gone. The major-
ity believes it is a small price to pay 
for two Senators. 
Republicans need assurances that the 
interests of our constituents will be re-
flected in this new State that will have 
undue influence over the Nation’s Fed-
eral Government. 
So, my motion contains reasonable 
additions to H.R. 51 that will require 
the President to ensure certain amend-
ments to the State constitution are in-
corporated before granting statehood. 
These provisions reflect the entirety of 
the Nation’s views, not just those of 
cities controlled by Democrats. 
There is provision that prohibits the 
former capital from being a sanctuary 
city. These are provisions that prohibit 
taxpayer funds being used for political 
campaigns. These are provisions to pro-
tect Americans’ Second Amendment 
rights. These are provisions that pro-
vide full funding for law enforcement, 
that prohibit the destruction of our na-
tional monuments, that prohibit the 
creation 
of 
so-called 
autonomous 
zones. 
Since early entry of new States into 
the Union, Congress has required that 
constitutions of the new States reflect 
certain considerations before granting 
admission. Nevada and West Virginia 
were required to prohibit slavery. Var-
ious Western States were required to 
prohibit polygamy. 
These requests do not violate the Su-
preme Court’s equal footing doctrine, 
but the idea of the State of Wash-
ington, Douglass Commonwealth con-
taining wholly within it the entirety of 
the Federal Capital does, in fact, vio-
late this doctrine. 
A State with a controlling influence 
over the Nation’s Federal Government 
and Capital is simply not on equal foot-
ing with the other 50 States. It is above 
them. 
A vote for the majority’s design for 
D.C. statehood is a vote for D.C.’s supe-
riority. The Founders recognized the 
status of Washington, D.C. House Re-
publicans do not support deviation 
from their vision. 
However, if the Democrats insist on 
creating this new State, it is only fair 
that it be established as a State with 
policy values that more closely reflect 
the rest of the country. 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor 
of this motion to recommit, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I claim 
the time in opposition to the motion to 
recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Maryland is recognized 
for 5 minutes. 
Mr. RASKIN. Mr. Speaker, I urge all 
of my colleagues to reject this weak 
and unconstitutional motion to recom-
mit. 
The motion proposes to condition the 
admission of Washington, Douglass 
Commonwealth on either the imposi-
tion of the whimsical policy pref-
erences of the minority or simply banal 
restatements that the State will follow 
Federal law, which, obviously, it must 
do already under the Supremacy Clause 
of the Constitution. All of the States 
must. 
But the paradigm example here, and 
the thing that really appears to be 
really on their mind, and I am glad we 
at least have boiled it down to this 
issue, is they want to make sure that 
the new State doesn’t come in without 
an amendment written by the people of 
Washington, D.C., saying that they will 
not charge people a fee for carrying a 
concealed weapon. 
Now, that is not in the U.S. Constitu-
tion, and it is not a matter of Federal 
law obligating the 50 States to do it, so 
you cannot selectively impose that on 
the new State of Washington, D.C. 
That is the equal footing doctrine, 
which the Supreme Court has empha-
sized repeatedly throughout our his-
tory, that every new State that we 
have granted admission to since the 
original 13, all 37 have entered on the 
exact same plane of political and con-
stitutional equality as the original 13. 
So, they want to impose their var-
ious policy preferences on different 
things, like concealed carry weapons 
and so on. 
If you want to do that, then try to 
pass it for the entire country, and it 
would apply within the new State, as 
well. I don’t think you can do it con-
stitutionally, but that is a separate 
matter. Or, resign your seat from wher-
ever you happen to be from. If you are 
from Georgia, resign your seat in Geor-
gia, move to the new State, and then 
campaign as a Member of Congress 
from here or campaign for Governor or 
State legislator in the new State and 
get them to change their law because 
that is a matter of local policy. 
I would think that the great cham-
pions of federalism and State rights 
would want to allow every State to 
make a decision for itself. 
Mr. Speaker, a number of things have 
been said that need to be corrected.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2544 
June 26, 2020 
For one thing, the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY) said that we should 
legislate for the real Americans, and he 
is going to speak for the real Ameri-
cans, not the people who live in Wash-
ington. I would hope he would reflect 
on that and issue an apology to the 
people of Washington, D.C. 
But it seemed that the logic of the 
argument was that the only people who 
live here are Federal employees, and 
they are different from the rest of 
America. 
Now, think about that for a second. 
In the first place, the overwhelming 
majority of Federal employees do not 
live in Washington, D.C. As far as I 
could tell, less than 8 percent of Fed-
eral employees live in Washington, 
D.C., which means 92 percent of them 
live in our States in the rest of Amer-
ica. 
Should those people be disenfran-
chised? Should people who work for the 
post office lose their right to represen-
tation in Congress? Should members of 
the Armed Forces be disenfranchised? 
The Supreme Court already said no in 
Carrington v. Rash. Check it out. 
So, the overwhelming majority of 
Federal employees don’t live in D.C., 
and the overwhelming majority of peo-
ple who live in Washington, D.C., and 
are the constituents of Representative 
NORTON
are not Federal employees. 
They do other things. 
Yes, they are real Americans, too. 
They are bus drivers. They are school-
teachers. They are businesspeople and 
entrepreneurs. I mean, come on, get 
real, be serious, get out and meet the 
people in Washington. 
The gentleman from Georgia said 
Washington, D.C., was set aside in the 
Constitution as a Federal district, and 
that was echoed by the former judge 
from Texas. But here, our friends just 
advertised their unfamiliarity both 
with the Constitution and with Amer-
ican history. 
The Constitution does not fix the ge-
ographic site of the so-called seat of 
government, the district that is set 
aside for the seat of government. That 
is why after the Constitution was 
adopted, the capital was in New York 
for a while. It was in Philadelphia for a 
while. Before that, it was in Trenton, 
New Jersey. It was in Princeton. It was 
in Annapolis. We have a whole room in 
Annapolis set aside for where Congress 
met. 
So the idea that you can look up the 
Constitution and see the boundaries or 
the map of Washington, D.C., is just 
absurd. 
Now, does Congress have the author-
ity to modify the boundaries of the 
Federal district as proposed by Ms. 
NORTON? Of course it does. We voted to 
do that in 1846 at the behest of a couple 
hundred slaveholders in Virginia who 
were afraid that this Congress would 
follow the advice of Representative 
Lincoln from Illinois, who said abolish 
the slave traffic in Washington, D.C. 
b 1100 
And they were afraid it was going to 
happen, so Alexandria, Arlington, and 
Fairfax county were given back to Vir-
ginia, and it was perfectly constitu-
tional. And there is no legal authority 
to the contrary in any way. 
If we can modify the boundaries of 
the Federal District to placate a couple 
hundred slave masters from the 19th 
century, we can modify the boundaries 
of the Federal District to grant state-
hood and political equality for the peo-
ple of Washington, D.C. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered on the motion to recommit. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The

NATIONAL PULSE MEMORIAL 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 3094) to designate the National 
Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South 
Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, 
and for other purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 3094 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF NATIONAL PULSE 
MEMORIAL. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—The Pulse Memorial located 
at 1912 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 
32806, is designated as the ‘‘National Pulse Me-
morial’’. 
(b) EFFECT
OF DESIGNATION.—The national 
memorial designated by this section is not a unit 
of the National Park System and the designa-
tion of the National Pulse Memorial shall not 
require or permit Federal funds to be expended 
for any purpose related to that national memo-
rial. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. SOTO) and the gentleman 
from California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Florida. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Florida? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, on June 12, 2016, a 
gunman shot and killed 49 people and 
injured 53 others in the Pulse nightclub 
shooting in Orlando, Florida. It was 
the single deadliest known violent at-
tack on the LGBTQ community, the 
deadliest violent attack in America at 
that time, and an attack on our Latino 
community, 
our 
African-American 
communities, and so many others. 
After this tragedy, our city came to-
gether. Doctors, first responders, and 
friends rushed to save the wounded; 
others donated funds, supplies, even 
their blood. Countless works of art, 
gifts, and letters were left at im-
promptu memorial sites paying tribute 
to the victims and survivors. 
We came together in candlelight vig-
ils across the globe to grieve and re-
member. We became truly Orlando 
Strong in the face of adversity for the 
whole world to see. 
As we continue to honor 49 angels, we 
remind the world that love will always 
conquer hate in the end. The designa-
tion of the Pulse nightclub as a na-
tional 
memorial 
honors 
the 
lives 
taken, as well as the survivors, first re-
sponders, and an entire central Florida 
community. Together, we will open 
minds and hearts and make the Pulse 
Memorial a national symbol of hope, 
love, and change. 
I thank my Orlando area colleagues, 
Congresswoman VAL DEMINGS and Con-
gresswoman STEPHANIE
MURPHY, for 
joining me in leading this important 
bipartisan legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 3094, offered by our col-
league from Florida (Mr. SOTO). 
A little over 4 years ago, on June 12, 
2016, the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, 
Florida, became the scene of the worst 
terrorist attack on American soil since 
September 11, 2001. 
Forty-nine Americans died and 53 
were injured that terrible night at the 
hands of an ISIS-inspired coward who 
turned on the very country where his 
parents had sought refuge from the vio-
lence in Afghanistan. Instead of grati-
tude, he unleashed hatred and violence 
upon this country that had sheltered 
his family and made it possible for him 
to be born into a land of freedom and 
opportunity. 
The poisonous political ideology that 
infected and animated him in his at-
tack—and to which he pledged alle-
giance just before the attack—is a fa-
miliar nemesis to the founding prin-
ciples of our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2545 
June 26, 2020 
This craven and wanton attack re-
minds us of the threats of Islamic ex-
tremism both at home and abroad: that 
they are real, that they are malignant, 
and that they are deadly. 
In the aftermath of this terrible at-
tack on the patrons of the Pulse night-
club, its owner established a nonprofit 
called the onePULSE Foundation to 
memorialize those who died in this 
mass murder, known simply as ‘‘the 
49.’’ The foundation worked quickly to 
establish a memorial in Orlando, but 
recently began working with Orlando’s 
mayor to launch a design competition 
for a permanent memorial and museum 
slated to open in 2022. 
This bill would redesignate the Pulse 
Memorial in Orlando as the National 
Pulse Memorial. The bill makes clear 
that this memorial will not be a unit of 
the national park system, and a des-
ignation as a national memorial does 
not require any Federal funds to be ex-
pended. 
The House’s action on this bill today 
complements the United States Sen-
ate’s resolution passed on June 11 of 
this year honoring the victims of this 
outrage, as well as the State of Flor-
ida’s designation of June 12 as Pulse 
Remembrance Day. 
I urge adoption of the measure, and I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California and our 
friends across the aisle for their sup-
port. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. 
DEMINGS). 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Madam Speaker, it 
is time to make the Pulse nightclub a 
national memorial, and the reason is 
that what Pulse symbolizes is relevant 
to all Americans. 
Let me say this: Orlando does not 
need Congress in order to honor the 49 
victims, nor the 53 who were wounded 
that night. We have honored them and 
will continue to do so for as long as 
their memories live on. 
But it is still the right thing to do, 
that Congress take this action today, 
because, by making Pulse a national 
memorial, we honor not only the vic-
tims, but what they stood for, what 
they represent, and what our country 
could be and should be. 
Pulse is in my district. It was a sanc-
tuary. It was a place where Orlando’s 
LGBTQ residents could find safety and 
friendship. The people there that night 
were not in the wrong place at the 
wrong time. They were exactly where 
they were supposed to be, among 
friends and loved ones, taking joy to-
gether in what my bishop referred to as 
a late night fellowship. 
Isn’t that worth celebrating? Isn’t 
that worth protecting for every Amer-
ican? Could there be any right more 
basic? 
And that is why we are here: to honor 
and remember them. 
We will continue to grieve for those 
we lost and to help those who survived. 
We will continue together and remem-
ber. 
We will continue to act on gun vio-
lence and civil rights, for the survivors 
of Pulse have called upon us to honor 
those we lost with action, not just 
words. 
Today, with this vote, we state that 
Pulse was a national tragedy not only 
for what it was, but for what it meant; 
and it will be a national memorial not 
just to commemorate our past, but to 
guide our future. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further speakers on our side, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank you, who brought me to the site 
of this horrible tragedy and allowed me 
to see the warmth and beauty of your 
community in response to it. 
Four years ago, 49 people were mur-
dered in a violent, hate-filled mass 
shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando. 
In the days that followed, we saw and 
heard stories of courage, bravery, and 
resolve. But mostly, there was un-
speakable pain for those who lost 
someone in this attack. And although I 
pray that the passage of 4 years has 
brought some measure of relief, the 
truth is that their pain will never fully 
go away. 
It is critical that we designate this 
memorial today so that our country 
never forgets those who are lost, but it 
is also important to take action so this 
never happens again. 
Individuals convicted of hate crimes 
should never own a gun, and that is 
why I introduced the Disarm Hate 
Act—to do just that. If you commit a 
hate crime, you shouldn’t be allowed to 
own a gun, period. We know that those 
who commit hate crimes become in-
creasingly violent as time goes on. 
b 1115 
No American family should have to 
suffer because of this loophole. Let’s 
disarm hate once and for all. 
We will never forget the 49 young 
people who lost their lives at the Pulse 
club in Orlando, the extraordinary re-
sponse of the first responders, and the 
hospital facilities that provided mirac-
ulous care that prevented so many 
other lives from being lost. 
Let’s do all that we can to prevent 
the next hate-filled tragedy. 
Again, I salute Orlando Strong for 
the magnificent and nurturing re-
sponse of the entire community to this 
devastating attack on all of us. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, I take this oppor-
tunity to commend Congressman SOTO, 
Congresswoman DEMINGS, and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Florida 
(Congress-
woman MURPHY), who is in the Chair, 
on this incredibly important legisla-
tion. 
I traveled to attend a memorial serv-
ice in the aftermath of the tragedy at 
Orlando’s 
Pulse 
gay 
nightclub 
to 
mourn with the stunned community 
how the confluence of bigotry and 
weapons of war conspired to steal 49 in-
nocent lives. 
I remember the feeling of numbness 
and agony. It was so hard to grasp that 
in 2016, visitors to Pulse that night suf-
fered a violence that far too often 
plagues LGBTQ-plus communities and 
communities of color, but this time on 
a mass scale. They were targeted for 
who they were. 
Out for the evening, they assumed it 
was safe to be themselves, to live their 
truths, and yet their precious lives 
were snuffed out. 
But in this darkest of moments, Flo-
ridians opened their arms to embrace 
and heal one another. They vocally de-
nounced bigotry, whether it was aimed 
at our LGBTQ-plus or Hispanic com-
munities, or too often both. They 
would not stay silent. 
Even public figures who were not al-
ways clear LGBTQ-plus allies stood up 
and made a commitment to equality. 
It was an encouraging moment of sol-
idarity amidst such tragedy. Most Flo-
ridians responded by drawing closer 
than ever before. 
Two years later, my community en-
dured similar heartache and anger 
when 17 students and educators were 
killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas 
High School. Days after that horrific 
school shooting, I was in Orlando and 
visited Pulse, where spontaneous mes-
sages of love and sadness were left be-
hind. 
As I added my message to the thou-
sands hanging on banners there, I saw 
Pulse was not simply a site of tragedy 
and pain. It was a hallowed place to re-
member and honor all the individuals 
who were lost. But it was also now a 
public space affirming that equality, 
justice, and love are worth rallying to 
and fighting for. 
Making Pulse a national memorial 
would, 
most 
importantly, 
properly 
honor those we lost way too soon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 1 minute to the gentle-
woman from Florida (Ms. WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ). 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam Speaker, but it would also ele-
vate that site so that millions of Amer-
icans might turn our collective pain 
into collective action. 
In passing this bill, I hope visitors 
the world over will be inspired by a 
community that emphatically declared 
that love and hope will always triumph 
over prejudice and violence. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL). 
Ms. MUCARSEL-POWELL. Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to rise in support 
of H.R. 3094, a bill to designate the Na-
tional Pulse Memorial.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2546 
June 26, 2020 
On June 12, 2016, a shooter hatefully 
took the lives of 49 people at the Pulse 
nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Those 
who died were sons and daughters, 
brothers and sisters, mothers, fathers, 
and loving members of Florida’s com-
munities. 
This tragedy brought grief and pain 
to all parts of the Nation, to Florida, 
including my very own district, and to 
the LGBT community. 
That evening at the nightclub was 
Jerry Wright. His parents, MJ and 
Fred, are part of our community in 
south Florida. They described Jerry as 
a wonderful, loving, and caring son. He 
was there that evening, like any other 
evening, enjoying Latin music with 
friends, and from 1 minute to the next, 
his life was cruelly taken from him. He 
was only 31 years old. 
We all know that Jerry did not de-
serve this. His parents and family did 
not deserve this. 
I am very close friends now with the 
Wright family, and I know firsthand 
the anguish and the pain that they go 
through every single day, Mother’s 
Day, Father’s Day. That pain never 
goes away. 
I 
know 
that 
personally, 
Madam 
Speaker, because I have also lost a 
loved one tragically to gun violence. 
So the pain that the families and the 
friends of 48 other people who lost their 
lives the same way is still present 
today. 
Just over 4 years later, now it is time 
that we designate the Pulse nightclub 
as a national memorial. 
This memorial will honor the mem-
ory of those who died that evening. It 
will ensure that loved family members 
like Jerry Wright are never forgotten. 
It will reflect on the pain that their 
families are still suffering. But most 
importantly, it will serve as a reminder 
that we as a country have to stop this 
violence and disarm hate. 
This memorial is a testament to 
those who died, and it is a mandate 
that we do more to stop it from hap-
pening again. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Florida (Mrs. MURPHY), my neighbor in 
central Florida. 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam 
Speaker, I thank my colleague for 
yielding to me. 
Four long years have passed since a 
gunman walked into my community 
and took the lives of 49 innocent people 
at the Pulse nightclub. 
At that time, the events marked the 
largest mass shooting in this country, 
and to this day, it remains one of the 
largest incidents of a hate crime in our 
history. 
Most of the victims were members of 
our LGBTQ community in Orlando, a 
community that created Pulse to be a 
safe place to be themselves, a place 
where hate and violence could not 
reach them. 
It took one lone gunman to shatter 
that reality. But it is up to us on this 
day, 4 years later, to take it back. 
We owe it to those we lost to honor 
their memories by dedicating a na-
tional memorial at Pulse, a memorial 
that reflects the same love, accept-
ance, and spirit of community that em-
bodied the victims and that embodies 
the LGBTQ community at large, a 
place of healing for the survivors and 
all those affected, a welcoming place 
for all those seeking inspiration to act, 
to create a better, safer, and more in-
clusive Nation. 
By taking this important step, Amer-
ica is telling the world that we will 
never let hate win, that we won’t for-
get the victims, and that we will fight 
to ensure no community will ever go 
through something like this again. 
God bless the Pulse victims and their 
families. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
would inquire if the gentleman is ready 
to close. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I have 
three more speakers. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. TAKANO). 
Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Four years ago, during Pride Month, 
our country awoke to the devastating 
news about a shooting at a nightclub in 
Orlando, Florida. The Pulse nightclub, 
a safe haven for the LGBTQ-plus com-
munity in Orlando was the target of an 
act of hate. 
Forty-nine lives were taken and 53 
were wounded after a gunman opened 
fire. The victims and survivors were 
LGBTQ-plus 
and 
members 
of 
the 
Latinx community. 
This shooting was one of the dead-
liest attacks on LGBTQ-plus Ameri-
cans in our history, and it left our 
community hurting, fearful, and skep-
tical about the progress our Nation had 
made 
towards 
acceptance, 
under-
standing, and belonging for LGBTQ- 
plus people. 
Four years later, we are still griev-
ing, we are still healing, and we are 
still demanding action to make equal-
ity the law of the land and to end gun 
violence in America. 
When I visited Orlando to pay my re-
spects to the victims and to honor 
their memories, what I saw at Pulse 
during such a painful time gave me 
hope. I saw a community that had 
come together to condemn hate, to re-
ject intolerance, and to celebrate the 
lives of every single soul that was lost 
that night. 
Our community’s pride and the brav-
ery we exhibit when we choose to em-
brace our identity, even in the face of 
hate and homophobia, is proof of how 
resilient we are. 
Designating Pulse as a national me-
morial would honor the lives of those 
lost and it would forever stand as a 
symbol of pride, hope, and courage, 
which will always triumph over hate. 
Madam Speaker, as the co-chair of 
the LGBT Equality Caucus, I thank 
Representative SOTO for his leadership, 
also Representative MURPHY and Rep-
resentative DEMINGS. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 3094. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Mas-
sachusetts (Ms. CLARK), the vice chair 
of our caucus. 
Ms. 
CLARK 
of 
Massachusetts. 
Madam Speaker, almost 4 years ago 
today, I joined with my colleagues and 
my friend, Congressman JOHN LEWIS, in 
leading a sit-in on this very floor after 
the Pulse nightclub shooting in Or-
lando, Florida. 
We could not stand for another mo-
ment of silence. We could not stand for 
another day of inaction. We could not 
stand for another mass shooting in 
America. 
We sat in protest. The House Demo-
crats stopped the work of Congress be-
cause Congress had stopped working 
for the American people. 
Now, 4 years later, our commitment 
to ending gun violence and hate re-
mains absolute. 
Making the Pulse nightclub a na-
tional memorial will honor the 49 lives 
lost in Orlando and will declare that 
love is love. 
Today, during Pride Month, we cele-
brate these lives and we honor them, 
but we can’t stop there. We need com-
monsense 
gun 
violence 
prevention 
measures now. 
Within weeks of taking the majority, 
House Democrats passed two bipartisan 
gun safety bills. To this day, they re-
main stalled in the Senate. 
COVID–19 is not the only public 
health crisis in this country. We lose 
40,000 Americans a year to gun vio-
lence. 
We cannot waste another day. We ask 
the Republicans in the Senate to pass 
our legislation, end this sickening 
cycle of gun violence in our country. 
Choose love, choose peace, recognize 
that gun violence is often the lethal 
partner of racism and bigotry. 
With this national memorial, we will 
have a physical manifestation of our 
commitment to end gun violence and 
to have equality for all. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I would 
inquire how much time we have re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
MURPHY
of Florida). The gentleman 
from Florida has 41⁄2 minutes remain-
ing. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE).

Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
this is a somber moment, and I thank 
the gentleman from Florida for not 
only his passion but his recognition 
that America should never forget.

families and loved ones that were im-
pacted. Forty-nine lives, I believe, were 
taken in one moment, with an act of 
violence by a crazed gunman, with a 
gun. 
We have been trying to stand in the 
gap, with background checks passed 
the very first moment under the lead-
ership of Speaker PELOSI, gun violence 
legislation that has no impact on the 
Second Amendment but seeks to derail 
the kind of crazed gunman that was 
able to take these lives before first re-
sponders could come. 
I remember hearing the stories of 
families waiting outside of the Pulse 
nightclub, saying they heard from 
their loved one but had not seen them 
because they were making their last- 
minute cries for help. 
This memorial would say to America 
that we are not a nation of bigots, of 
xenophobia, racism, hatred. We are a 
nation of respect and dignity. 
I know the families of those who died 
at the Pulse nightclub are still in pain 
and will never forget. 
But it is the duty of the United 
States 
Congress, 
with 
our 
voices 
raised, to say that the book that I have 
been holding on to over the last 2 days, 
to fight for justice in policing, to talk 
about D.C. statehood, this book, this 
Constitution, 
which 
George 
Wash-
ington said he would use as a guide, 
that he would never abandon, everyone 
has the right to decency and life and 
due process. 
I enthusiastically support this legis-
lation to give dignity to the lives, and 
for America never to forget those lives, 
at the Pulse nightclub. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
House of Representatives, I rise in strong sup-
port of H.R. 3094, ‘‘To designate the National 
Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South Orange 
Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, and for other 
purposes.’’ 
I am voting for H.R. 3094 because it not 
only memorializes and honors the 49 people 
who tragically lost their lives from this horrific 
act of violence, but it also stands as a symbol 
to the LGBTQ+ community, to our Latino com-
munity, to our nation, and to the world, that we 
will not stand for or tolerate acts of hatred 
against marginalized persons. 
Madam Speaker, you will remember that the 
Pulse nightclub shooting took place on June 
12th, 2016 in Orlando, Florida when a gunman 
shot and killed 49 people and injured 53 oth-
ers. 
It was the single deadliest known violent at-
tack on both the LGBTQ+ community and our 
Latino community. 
The Pulse nightclub was a haven for the 
LGBTQ community to live, love, and dance. 
They came for music, celebration and fel-
lowship. 
Over four dozen would leave the Pulse 
Nightclub with their names added to a list of 
fatal victims of gun violence . 
In the aftermath, we saw communities come 
together and support one another. 
We saw doctors, first responders, and 
friends rush to save the wounded. 
Others donated funds, supplies, and even 
their blood. 
There were countless murals and other 
artworks, gifts, and letters left at impromptu 
memorial sites, paying tribute to the victims 
and survivors. 
Our nation refused to let hate win. 
We came together in the form of thousands 
of candlelight vigils to grieve, remember, and 
heal. 
By passing H.R. 3094 today, we seek to 
create a permanent reminder that this act of 
violence and other heinous instances of big-
otry are not emblematic of America or its true 
values. 
It will also remind us that it is our duty as 
a society to be better and do better in terms 
of standing up against hate in all its forms. 
I ask all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 3094, ‘‘To designate the National Pulse 
Memorial located at 1912 South Orange Ave-
nue, Orlando, Florida, 32806, and for other 
purposes.’’ 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. PELOSI), the Speaker of the 
House of Representatives. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
I thank you and him for making this 
important memorial possible for us 
today. 
I rise to solemnly join my colleagues 
to honor the 49 beautiful souls mur-
dered 4 years ago in an unfathomable 
act of hatred and bloodshed at the 
Pulse nightclub in Orlando. 
I thank Congressman DARREN SOTO 
for giving us this opportunity of ob-
serving and for being a voice for peace 
and healing for all of those affected. 
Pulse was a peaceful haven where 
young LGBTQ Americans could enjoy 
music, dancing, and celebration, know-
ing they were in a sanctuary of safety 
and solidarity. 
Pulse was a monument to joy, a trib-
ute to resilience and pride born out of 
the grief that Barbara Poma experi-
enced after losing her brother, John, to 
AIDS. That was her motivation for 
starting that. 
May the grief that we experience now 
at the loss of 49 who were murdered 
move us to turn our pain into purpose. 
This poster is all of them. 
But some time after the terrible 
tragedy, we stood on the steps of the 
Capitol, holding their individual pic-
tures. At that time, we said: We will 
never forget. 
Thank you for giving us the oppor-
tunity to keep that promise to turn 
pain into purpose. 
Shortly after the horrific act of ha-
tred at Pulse, I had the solemn privi-
lege of traveling to Orlando and meet-
ing with survivors and families who 
had lost loved ones. Their message to 
the Congress, to a person that I met 
with there, was: Please, do something 
to stop gun violence. 
Yet, painfully, since that tragic 
night, the horror that we saw in Or-
lando has been replicated in countless 
other communities across the country. 
In too many places, the epidemic of 
gun violence has killed too many inno-
cent people and left too many families 
suffering unimaginable pain and loss. 
As one of the first actions of our ma-
jority last year, the House took action 
to end the bloodshed by passing H.R. 8 
and H.R. 1112, H.R. 8 so designated be-
cause it had been 8 years since the as-
sault on the life of our colleague Gabby 
Giffords. 
She survived. She is doing remark-
able things, in terms of trying to end 
gun violence. But other people died. 
Hence, H.R. 8, as it was 8 years since. 
Then, H.R. 1112 was Mr. CLYBURN’s leg-
islation to address what happened in 
South Carolina. 
485 days, nearly 500 days, later, we 
continue to urge the Senate to take up 
this legislation, supported 
broadly, 
Democrats, independents, Republicans, 
gun owners, hunters, many of whom 
have had to pass background checks in 
order to have their guns and to enjoy 
their sport and protect themselves. 
They 
are 
not 
against 
background 
checks. Across the country, this has 
broad support, nonpartisan support. 
Yet, in the Congress of the United 
States, there is resistance to that safe-
ty of simply commonsense background 
checks. It isn’t as if we were starting 
something new. This is just an expan-
sion of the background checks that al-
ready exist to include gun shows and 
online sales, et cetera, just an expan-
sion.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2548 
June 26, 2020 
I remind my colleagues that an aver-
age of 100 people die every day from 
gun violence. Let me restate, it has 
been almost 500 days since the House 
passed those bills and the Senate has 
failed to take it up—almost 500 times 
100 a day. 
We see the consequences. Not that all 
of them would have been saved, but 
some, many, would have. Many have 
been saved since the original back-
ground check legislation passed. 
Four years later, 4 years after Pulse, 
our grief remains raw. But our resolve 
to end the deadly scourge of gun vio-
lence and hatred—discrimination, that 
it was about, too—remains unwavering. 
Strengthened by the memories of 
those who were lost to gun violence—49 
souls here, and so many others—in-
spired by the spirit of hope that we cel-
ebrate during Pride Month, especially 
this weekend, let us never relent in our 
mission to end the horror of gun vio-
lence once and for all and end discrimi-
nation against anyone in our commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, I thank and com-
mend Mr. SOTO, and I urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I again want to commend Mr. SOTO 
on this bill. 
In closing, it is important to note 
that the attack that we remember with 
this legislation was directed against all 
Americans, not just the patrons of the 
nightclub that night. The killer made 
this abundantly and chillingly clear. 
He declared himself an ‘‘Islamic sol-
dier’’ and declared his allegiance and 
obedience to the terrorist leader, Abu 
Bakr al-Baghdadi. This was an attack 
motivated by hate, hatred against our 
country, hatred against all that our 
country stands for. 
I think we can take some solace in 
knowing that Americans today retain 
their 
right 
to 
defend 
themselves 
against such attacks, that such ter-
rorist attacks like this should remind 
us how important our Second Amend-
ment rights remain today. 
We can also take solace from the fact 
that al-Baghdadi, the inspiration for 
this terrorist attack, was hunted down 
and brought to justice in October last 
year by American Delta Force com-
mandos, as he shielded himself with 
children, who he killed when he deto-
nated a suicide vest rather than to be 
taken prisoner. 
Madam Speaker, in memory of the 49 
Americans killed by this terrorist at-
tack, I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ vote in this 
House today. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
We all agree this was an attack moti-
vated by hate, and today, we recognize 
the 49 angels we lost and the 53 who 
were injured during the Pulse night-
club shooting. 
Vigils occurred across this Nation, 
across the political spectrum, after 
this deadly shooting. I can tell you, on 
behalf 
of 
Congresswoman 
DEMINGS, 
Congresswoman MURPHY, myself, and 
our region, we want to thank everyone 
for doing that. 
We want to thank our colleagues, 
both Democrats and Republicans, for 
coming 
together: 
Chair 
GRIJALVA, 
Ranking Member BISHOP, Mr. MCCLIN-
TOCK, 
Miss 
GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N, 
Mr. 
FITZPATRICK. We appreciate all the 
work being done in the Senate. 
Today, we recognize the memory of 
these 49 angels across our Nation by 
making this the Pulse National Memo-
rial. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from Florida (Mr. SOTO) 
that the House suspend the rules and 
pass the bill, H.R. 3094, as amended.

VETO 
MESSAGE 
FROM 
THE 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
NEGUSE). Pursuant to the order of the 
House of June 18, 2020, the unfinished 
business is the further consideration of 
the veto message of the President on 
the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 76) pro-
viding for congressional disapproval 
under chapter 8 of title 5, United 
States Code, of the rule submitted by 
the Department of Education relating 
to ‘‘Borrower Defense Institutional Ac-
countability’’. 
The Clerk read the title of the joint 
resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is, Will the House, on recon-
sideration, pass the joint resolution, 
the objections of the President to the 
contrary notwithstanding? 
(For veto message, see proceedings of 
the House of June 1, 2020, at page 
H2362.) 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. SCOTT) is 
recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of over-
riding the President’s veto of H.J. Res. 
76, a bipartisan Congressional Review 
Act resolution that would stop the De-
partment of Education’s harmful bor-
rower defense rule from going into ef-
fect. 
Mr. Speaker, I first want to recognize 
the hard work of the gentlewoman 
from Nevada, Representative SUSIE 
LEE, for her tireless efforts in pro-
tecting students, particularly student 
veterans, from predatory schools. 
b 1145 
Borrower defense is a valuable tool to 
provide relief to student borrowers who 
are defrauded by predatory institu-
tions. Unfortunately, instead of using 
the Department’s authority to make 
borrowers whole and give students a 
second chance at a quality education, 
it has gone out of its way to prevent 
victims of fraud from getting relief. 
The Department’s rewrite of the bor-
rower defense rule, which is set to go 
into effect on July 1, will mean that a 
vast majority of defrauded student bor-
rowers will get virtually no relief. Even 
in cases where a school clearly violates 
the law, defrauded victims can still be 
denied relief under the rule if they 
can’t show that the school inten-
tionally defrauded them or they can’t 
file their claim fast enough or they 
can’t 
document, 
according 
to 
the 
flawed Department methodology, ex-
actly how much harm they suffered due 
to fraud. 
Even those student borrowers who do 
receive partial relief will receive sig-
nificantly less relief than before. Under 
Secretary DeVos, the average loan dis-
charge amount for approved borrowers 
has dropped from about $11,000 to about 
$500, and for many students zero relief 
will be available even though they can 
prove massive fraud. 
Class actions are not allowed under 
the rule. Each student must bring an 
individual case even though the school 
may have been found to have been 
guilty of egregious systemic fraud. 
Democrats and Republicans came to-
gether earlier this year to pass a Con-
gressional Review Act resolution that 
rejects this rule and prevents the De-
partment of Education from denying 
borrowers the relief they deserve. A 
broad coalition, including veterans and 
military groups, consumer advocates, 
student advocates, and civil rights 
groups, called on the President to sign 
the congressional resolution and pro-
tect student borrowers from predatory 
schools; but, while the President ini-
tially indicated support for the resolu-
tion, he ultimately chose to veto it. 
Today the House has one final oppor-
tunity to ensure that defrauded stu-
dents get the relief they deserve by 
overriding that veto. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote to override the President’s veto. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield the customary 30 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX), who is the 
ranking member, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume, and I thank my col-
league from Virginia for yielding me 
the time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposi-
tion of H.J. Res. 76, a resolution that 
would overturn the Education Depart-
ment’s effort to assist students who

June 26, 2020 
have been defrauded by colleges and 
universities while also taking nec-
essary precautions to protect taxpayer 
interests. 
Democrats have resorted to political 
finger-pointing on this issue at every 
turn. First, Education and Labor Com-
mittee Democrats held a hearing at the 
end of last year to hurl unfounded and 
personal attacks at Secretary DeVos. 
Then they passed H.J. Res. 76 shortly 
after to overturn the Education De-
partment’s borrower defense rules; and 
now, after President Trump has vetoed 
this resolution, the Democrats still 
can’t take no for an answer and want 
to override the President’s veto. 
As we stand here today—yet again— 
to watch the Democrats’ political 
games unfold, I would like to begin by 
highlighting real priorities we are let-
ting fall by the wayside as we waste 
time debating this partisan resolution. 
For starters, we should be working 
on bipartisan solutions to combat the 
devastating effects of the coronavirus. 
We should be addressing the concerns 
of small businesses—the backbone of 
our economy—and the workers whose 
livelihoods are being impacted by this 
crisis. 
Or we could address labor union 
shortcomings, including the widespread 
and brazen corruption amongst United 
Auto Worker, UAW, union leadership. 
We know the UAW senior union leaders 
engaged in money laundering, tax 
fraud, bribery, and embezzlement, yet 
no action has been taken to examine 
this abuse of power by union bosses. 
Unfortunately, Democrats have a 
long track record of pursuing ideolog-
ical objectives at the expense of tax-
payers, students, and schools. Today is 
no different, so I would like to spend 
some time touching upon the advan-
tages of the Trump administration’s 
new rule and providing context on the 
Obama-era borrower defense rule and 
its many shortcomings. 
The borrower defense rule was first 
released by the Education Department 
in 1994. Borrowers rarely used this 
process over the next 20 years, until 
2015, when a large for-profit school 
closed. During the final stretch of his 
Presidency, the Obama administration 
used this school closure as an oppor-
tunity to issue new regulations on bor-
rower defense. 
The caveat? A potential $42 billion 
price tag to be footed by taxpayers 
that encouraged tens of thousands of 
borrowers, whether they were harmed 
or not, to apply to have their loans for-
given. In fact, claim filings for loan 
forgiveness went from 59 submitted in 
the first 20 years to roughly 300,000 
claims submitted in the last 5 years. 
Let me repeat that. 
For the first 20 years of the rule, 
there were 59 claims. Then the Obama 
administration 
begins 
encouraging 
frivolous appeals, and the appeals 
jumped to 300,000 and climbing. 
This shouldn’t come as a surprise. 
Massive loan forgiveness has long been 
a Democrat objective, and the Obama 
rule was a giant leap toward that 
goal—one that also ignored the high 
cost to taxpayers. 
Furthermore, the Obama administra-
tion’s regulations were convoluted, 
blurring the line between fraud and in-
advertent mistakes made by schools. 
The distinction between the two is im-
portant because, if institutions are 
found to engage in fraud, the Edu-
cation Department can cause schools 
to close—despite no intentional wrong-
doing—through 
significant 
financial 
penalties. 
But don’t just take my word for it. 
Colleges and universities, including 
historically Black colleges and univer-
sities, HBCUs, voiced concerns about 
the Obama regulation. Postsecondary 
education leaders believed what Presi-
dent Obama’s administration proposed 
could ruin those colleges and univer-
sities that did not have large endow-
ments or significant revenue streams 
like the Ivy League institutions. The 
Obama rule could shutter the very in-
stitutions designed and dedicated to 
serving 
low-income, 
minority, 
and 
first-generation students. 
Additionally, The Washington Times 
pointed out: ‘‘Under the Obama rule, 
students in the coronavirus era who 
could not attend classes on campus and 
were forced to take makeshift Zoom 
classes would have legitimate claims 
against 
their 
schools 
because 
the 
Obama rule does not differentiate be-
tween willful misrepresentation and 
schools’ 
varied 
responses 
to 
the 
coronavirus. Great for trial lawyers, 
but bad for students and their schools.’’ 
The Obama regulations created more 
chaos than clarity, and the Trump ad-
ministration recognized immediately 
the need to right these wrongs. So, 
working with the Education Depart-
ment, President Trump produced a rule 
with clearer standards for borrower de-
fense and increased transparency for 
both students and institutions. 
The rule, first and foremost, holds all 
schools 
accountable. 
Students 
who 
have been lied to and suffered financial 
harm are entitled to relief and forgive-
ness. 
Let me repeat that. The Trump ad-
ministration’s borrower defense rule 
delivers relief to students, including 
veterans, who have been lied to and 
suffered financial harm. 
In fact, the Obama rule undermined 
the ability of veterans to earn relief if 
the institution was considered an elite 
liberal arts institution. In contrast, 
President Trump’s rule makes sure stu-
dents have the last word no matter 
what institution they attend. 
Democrats will have you believe that 
the President and Secretary DeVos 
want to intentionally harm students 
who have been defrauded by an institu-
tion of higher education, and that is 
simply not the case. 
While my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle are willing to spend 
taxpayer money recklessly, President 
Trump’s rule actually reduces the cost 
of the 2016 Obama-era regulations by 
$11 billion because it helps students go 
to and complete their education rather 
than closing schools indiscriminately. 
This is an $11 billion savings for Amer-
ican taxpayers during a time when 
many are struggling to make ends 
meet. 
Additionally, the Trump borrower de-
fense rule holds all institutions, not 
just for-profit colleges, accountable for 
misrepresentations instead of picking 
winners and losers at considerable cost 
to taxpayers. It ensures due process for 
all parties; extends the look-back win-
dow to qualify for closed school loan 
discharges from 120 to 180 days so when 
schools close more students are eligible 
for forgiveness; and allows for arbitra-
tion, which could result in borrowers 
recovering resources such as cash pay-
ments or other expenses not provided 
by the Education Department. 
Furthermore, this rule is the result 
of more than 2 years of deliberations, 
public hearings, and negotiations with 
higher education stakeholders, as well 
as considering, incorporating, and re-
sponding to public comments on this 
issue. 
Thanks to this regulatory reset, all 
colleges and universities will be held 
accountable, defrauded students will 
see relief, and taxpayer dollars will be 
better protected. 
Republicans stand ready to provide 
relief to students who have been 
harmed by fraud, and the borrower de-
fense rule issued by the Trump admin-
istration delivers on that front. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ 
vote on this resolution, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Nevada (Mrs. LEE), who is the 
sponsor of the resolution and a hard-
working member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise to urge my colleagues to join me 
in overriding the Presidential veto of 
H.J. Res. 76. 
Last night, we took a historic vote 
for racial justice, the Justice in Polic-
ing Act. Time and again, Congress 
takes votes, votes like this one that 
will soon be forgotten in the media, but 
these are the votes that quietly perpet-
uate the systemic inequality and rac-
ism in our country. That is what this 
vote today is about. 
Communities of color, minority and 
low-income students, and veterans are 
preyed upon by predatory for-profit 
schools. They are manipulated. They 
are lied to and they are defrauded. 
Because we, the Federal Government, 
did not do enough to prevent that 
fraud, we established the borrower de-
fense rule as part of the Higher Edu-
cation Act as a way to give these stu-
dents a path to justice and relief. But 
the Department of Education not only 
rewrote that rule to make justice for 
our students virtually impossible, it is 
also failing to hold these predatory 
schools accountable for their actions. 
Time and time again, we tell young 
students in this country education is

the answer, and they believe us. But 
that system failed them. The system 
failed my constituent, Kendrick Har-
rison, a brave Iraq war veteran, a fa-
ther, and a Black American. 
Kendrick and his family were left 
homeless after his for-profit school 
blew through his GI benefits and con-
vinced him to take out $16,000 in debt 
right before shutting their doors. He is 
fighting to this day and working as 
hard as anyone to get his life back on 
track. 
I promise this story is not an excep-
tion. There are over 350,000 students 
just in recent years who were lied to, 
manipulated, and defrauded by preda-
tory schools. 
So I ask my colleagues: Are you 
going to stand with these students? Are 
you going to stand with the system 
that perpetuates inequality and holds 
down brave Americans like Kendrick? 
Are you going to let these for-profit 
schools wreak havoc on the lives of 
these students and take advantage of 
American taxpayers? 
Because it is us, American taxpayers, 
who foot the bill for these bad actor 
schools because the Department of 
Education refuses to hold them ac-
countable. 
I am ready to take a stand against 
this broken policy, and I need you to 
stand with me. Take a stand for the 
very communities who have been rising 
up in this country. 
These protests over the last several 
weeks are about police brutality, but 
they are about so much more. They are 
about decisions that we make in this 
body that perpetuate inequality and 
continue to stack the deck against 
Black Americans, student veterans, 
students in poverty, and working peo-
ple who are just trying to better them-
selves. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote to override the President’s veto. It 
is time to take a stand. 
b 1200 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMP-
SON). 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank our education Re-
publican leader for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
the veto override of H.J. Res. 76. 
The Department of Education first 
released borrower defense rules in 1994, 
which were rarely used over the next 20 
years. After a large for-profit school 
closed in 2015, the Obama administra-
tion used this opportunity to issue new 
regulations on borrower defense. These 
regulations could cost the American 
taxpayer more than $40 billion and en-
courage tens of thousands of bor-
rowers—whether they were harmed or 
not—to apply to have their loans for-
given. The 2016 Obama regulations cre-
ated more chaos than clarity and set 
massive loan forgiveness of a loan, re-
gardless of the cost to taxpayers. 
However, in 2019, the Trump adminis-
tration issued that new borrower de-
fense rule, which takes effect July 1. 
The new rule creates clear, consistent 
standards and procedures for borrowers 
who have suffered financial harm due 
to a misrepresentation by a school. 
Specifically, the rule: 
Ensures due process for all parties; 
Holds all institutions—not just for- 
profits—accountable for misrepresenta-
tions; 
It delivers relief to students, includ-
ing veterans, who have been lied to and 
suffered financial harm; 
It preserves student choice, including 
student veterans in institutions that 
best suit their educational needs; 
And it saves taxpayers $11 billion by 
incentivizing students to finish their 
education rather than indiscriminately 
closing schools. 
H.J. Res. 76 would undermine the re-
peal of the Trump administration’s 
borrower defense rule and go back to 
Obama regulations that harm students 
and taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I urge 
my colleagues to oppose this measure. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Mrs. DAVIS), the chair 
of the Subcommittee on Higher Edu-
cation and Workforce Investment. 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, there are 240,000 defrauded students 
waiting for student loan relief. Over 
40,000 of those students are from my 
home State of California. 
After doing nothing for students who 
have been defrauded by predatory col-
leges, the Department has come out 
with a new borrower defense rule that 
only makes things worse—in several 
ways—under the guise of protecting 
the taxpayer from footing the bill. But 
we have to remember, our students are 
taxpayers, too. 
This new rule clearly gives pref-
erence to the very colleges causing the 
harm from the borrower defense rule 
that it was intended to prevent. If a 
school closes before delivering on its 
promises to students, they should have 
automatic discharge of their loans to 
that institution. Students who have 
spent years bettering themselves work-
ing to get into jobs, sacrificing in the 
hope of improving financial conditions 
for their families are being told that 
they simply don’t matter. 
Colleges, on the other hand, can use 
this system to keep taking money and 
they don’t have to deliver what they 
promise. Our students deserve protec-
tion from predatory practices. 
Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us 
today is the first step toward blocking 
the new fraud borrower defense rule 
from taking support, and I urge its sup-
port. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. KEL-
LER), another great member of the 
committee. 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the attempted 
veto override of H.J. Res. 76. 
When this legislation was advanced 
through this Chamber in January, the 
majority sought to turn back the clock 
on borrower defense leading to dan-
gerous 
consequences 
for 
students, 
those repaying their loans, and the 
American taxpayer. The Obama-era 
rule, which the majority seeks to re-
turn us to, in this legislation was 
marked by regulatory chaos, excessive 
punishments, and ridiculous costs. The 
Obama rule provided no clarity and 
sought to forgive student loans at a 
massive scale, regardless of the cost to 
taxpayers or merits of the borrower’s 
case. 
Mr. Speaker, most importantly, the 
Obama-era regulations did not distin-
guish between deliberate fraud and un-
intentional errors made by schools, 
which is critical because the Depart-
ment can levy substantial financial 
penalties against institutions found to 
engage in fraud, which can cause a 
school to close despite no intentional 
wrongdoing, thus ending access to al-
ternative avenues for higher education 
for some current and prospective stu-
dents. 
Estimates put the total cost of the 
Obama Loan Forgiveness giveaway as 
high as $40 billion. That is why in 2019, 
the Trump administration issued the 
new Borrower Defense Institutional 
Accountability Rule. The new rule, 
which takes effect on July 1, provides 
regulatory clarity; affords due process 
to both students and institutions; pro-
vides students relief relative to actual 
harm; holds all institutions account-
able for misrepresentation; provides 
students with more options to continue 
their education, should their school 
close; and allows for faster relief by al-
lowing institutional level arbitration. 
Importantly, the 2019 rule is estimated 
to save taxpayers $11 billion from the 
2016 Obama-rule baseline. 
Mr. Speaker, we simply cannot afford 
to return to the outdated, costly, and 
confusing Obama-era rule. I also urge a 
‘‘no’’ vote, because with respect to this 
issue, Congress should stay in its lane. 
The Trump administration was right-
ly using its authority to implement the 
laws promulgating the new Borrower 
Defense Institutional Accountability 
Rule. They did so at a substantial sav-
ings to the taxpayer, while protecting 
student borrowers and holding bad ac-
tors accountable. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. COURTNEY), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, just a 
few weeks ago, right before Memorial 
Day, President Trump very quietly, be-
hind closed doors, vetoed this bill, a 
bill that protects a borrower defense 
rule, which was supported by a wide 
range of veteran service organizations. 
For 
years, 
young 
veterans 
who 
sought an education after serving their 
country have been targeted by for-prof-
it, rip-off education factories that 
swallow up their GI benefits and then 
pile on new student loans.

June 26, 2020 
Stories 
abound 
about 
men 
and 
women who wore the uniform of this 
country left with crushing debt and 
worthless degrees that denied them the 
rewarding careers they were promised. 
Although many today are entitled to 
loan forgiveness, the Department of 
Education, 
under 
Secretary 
Betsy 
DeVos, has willfully made this process 
as onerous as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, if we listen to the 
American Legion, the Iraq and Afghan 
Veterans of America, and the Vietnam 
Veterans of America, vote to override, 
and we can restore these victims of 
fraud and greed some semblance of fi-
nancial solvency. If we do not override 
this veto, the share of eligible debt for-
giveness will drop from 53 percent to 
just 3 percent, and we will betray thou-
sands of Americans who stepped up and 
volunteered to protect our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ to override. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I find it interesting that my 
colleague would say the President 
‘‘very quietly and behind closed doors’’ 
vetoed a bill. They issued a statement 
on it almost immediately, so it wasn’t 
exactly quietly. Generally, they have 
to veto a bill at a desk with people 
present. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the 
gentleman from Georgia (Mr. ALLEN). 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to voice my strong opposition to 
overriding President Trump’s veto. 
We can all agree that no student 
should be intentionally misled and 
schools engaging in fraudulent mis-
representation must be held account-
able. But the Obama-era borrower de-
fense regulations lack clarity, and sim-
ply, did not function. The 2016 regula-
tions did not make the critical distinc-
tion between fraud and unintentional 
mistakes made by schools. 
Mr. Speaker, under the rule, the De-
partment of Education can impose sig-
nificant financial penalties on institu-
tions found to engage in fraud. But 
with no distinction, this can cause a 
school to have to close despite no in-
tentional wrongdoing, hurting students 
on their path to a higher education. 
That is why President Trump took de-
cisive action and created the 2019 bor-
rower defense rule to clear this up. 
Mr. Speaker, the Trump administra-
tion’s solution delivers relief to stu-
dents, including veterans, who have 
been lied to and suffered financial 
harm. It would also save taxpayers $11 
billion by helping students complete 
their education, rather than indis-
criminately 
closing 
schools. 
The 
Trump rule will ensure due process for 
all parties, while also ensuring institu-
tions engaging in fraudulent misrepre-
sentation are held accountable. 
Mr. Speaker, when Democrats origi-
nally brought forward a resolution to 
disapprove this new commonsense rule, 
I voted ‘‘no,’’ and I will vote ‘‘no’’ 
again today. 
I thank President Trump for right-
fully using his veto authority, because 
we cannot go back to the Obama-era 
regulations that hurt students and tax-
payers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this measure today. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Oregon (Ms. BONAMICI), the chair 
of the Subcommittee on Civil Rights 
and Human Services. 
Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.J. Res. 76, 
the veto override. 
The Obama administration wrote the 
original borrower defense rule to pro-
vide defrauded students with the debt 
relief they are entitled to under the 
Higher Education Act. 
Rather than protect students, how-
ever, DeVos rewrote the rule to make 
it nearly impossible for students who 
are victimized by deceptive institu-
tions to get the relief they deserve. 
That is not justice. 
Mr. Speaker, five months ago, I urged 
my colleagues to support the resolu-
tion to reverse Secretary DeVos’ harm-
ful new borrower defense rule. I was 
glad it passed with bipartisan support. 
We are here today because the Presi-
dent has chosen to veto the resolution 
and stand with Secretary DeVos and 
unscrupulous institutions that cheated 
students. This is indefensible. 
Mr. Speaker, we are in a challenging 
time for our country, but this should 
not be hard. Let’s stand with the vic-
tims of deception, the students we rep-
resent across the country, not with un-
scrupulous institutions, not with Sec-
retary DeVos, and not with Donald 
Trump. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join together and override this veto. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE). 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise in opposition to the res-
olution. 
As a ranking member of the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs, I have 
heard a lot of misinformation about 
the Department of Education’s bor-
rower defense rule and its effects on 
student veterans. 
Here is the truth: The rule does not 
limit the rights or benefits provided for 
veterans in the GI bill or servicemem-
bers who use the Department of De-
fense’s Tuition Assistance Program, or 
the TAP program. Any veteran or serv-
icemember who is defrauded by an in-
stitution and took out Federal loans, 
will have the opportunity to have that 
claim fairly adjudicated, just like any 
other student would under the rule. 
When I was chairman of the Com-
mittee on Veterans’ Affairs in 2017, I 
offered the Forever GI bill to make 
more veterans eligible to receive a GI 
bill benefit and make veterans eligible 
to receive this valuable benefit for life. 
Mr. Speaker, 45 years ago, this Army 
veteran, when he left the Army, used 
the GI bill. I know how valuable it is, 
personally, Mr. Speaker. It helped me 
and my family tremendously, and that 
is why we wanted to make this benefit 
a lifetime benefit. 
Mr. Speaker, just a few months ago, 
this Congress passed two bills to pro-
tect student veterans whose GI bill 
benefits 
were 
impacted 
by 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. My record has 
shown that one of my top priorities is 
ensuring veterans can receive a quality 
education, and a large part of that is 
ensuring that they receive the edu-
cation they were promised and holding 
schools accountable for fraud. 
Mr. Speaker, the Department’s rule 
does just that. And it sets up a clear 
process for borrowers to have their 
claim adjudicated and hold institutions 
of all types accountable. This rule is 
fair to borrowers. It is fair to schools. 
It is fair to taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this rule, and 
I support the President’s veto. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. TAKANO), a mem-
ber of the Committee on Education and 
Labor, but more importantly, chair of 
the full Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs, because so many veterans have 
been implicated by fraud on these in-
stitutions. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, so when the Trump ad-
ministration and Secretary DeVos ap-
proved its new borrower defense to re-
payment rule late last year, it was 
clear that they had chosen to pander to 
the for-profit college industry and 
cheat thousands of borrowers out of 
the relief that they deserve. 
Predatory for-profit institutions con-
sistently put their profits over stu-
dents’ education. They make false 
promises about job prospects, drain 
Federal resources, and leave millions 
of students with useless degrees and 
high student loan debt. 
Mr. Speaker, yes, veterans are among 
that group of people, and that is why 
major veteran service organizations 
have come out in favor of this veto 
override in support of the original leg-
islation. Veterans, women, and minori-
ties are aggressively recruited by these 
institutions who only see them as a 
benefit to their bottom line: 
ITT Technical Institute, Corinthian 
Colleges, Dream Center Colleges are 
just some of the predatory for-profits 
whose lofty promises turned student 
dreams into a nightmare. The student 
borrowers who were defrauded by these 
schools are desperately seeking relief, 
but Secretary DeVos is making that 
task nearly impossible. And that is 
why this year, both Chambers of Con-
gress passed a bipartisan Congressional 
Review Act resolution that rejected 
Secretary DeVos’ harmful rule. 
Students, consumer advocates, and 
student veteran groups spoke out in 
favor of this CRA and urged President 
Trump to sign it into law. But the 
President refused to heed their call, 
choosing instead to uphold Secretary 
DeVos’ watered-down rule to put addi-
tional burdens on borrowers.

We must override the President’s 
veto. Congress must again stand with 
student loan borrowers and stop the 
Trump 
administration’s 
attack 
on 
America’s students and his attempts to 
rig the rule in favor of Secretary 
DeVos’ cronies. More than 200,000 stu-
dent borrowers are still waiting for re-
lief. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
SMUCKER). 
Mr. SMUCKER. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to today’s 
attempt to override the President’s 
veto. 
I think all of us agree that it is im-
portant to offer borrowers a process to 
discharge loans when they have been 
defrauded by a school, and that is what 
the rule, crafted with significant stake-
holder input, offers. That was the origi-
nal intent of the borrower defense proc-
ess when it was enacted in 1995. 
However, in 2016, as we have heard, 
the Obama administration used this 
process to advance an ideological loan 
forgiveness scheme, and it worked as 
they intended. We went from fewer 
than 60 claims over 20 years to nearly 
330,000 claims in 4 years, which would 
cost the hardworking taxpayers, if you 
had to pay this price, $40 billion. And 
they will have to pay that price. 
Now, I don’t need to go into reasons 
why that 2016 Obama rule was flawed. 
Instead, I will highlight some of the 
improvements made under the new 
rule. 
This rule strengthens protections for 
borrowers from fraud and applies the 
same accountability metrics to all in-
stitutions across the board. 
The rule provides due process for stu-
dents and institutions but, rightfully, 
gives students the last word. The rule 
keeps the standard of evidence the 
same as the one used by the Obama ad-
ministration, by the way, and thanks 
to stakeholder feedback, the rule does 
not require borrowers to prove intent. 
Another point, this new rule will 
only apply to new claims for loans 
taken out after July 1. 
I do want to thank Secretary DeVos 
and all of the hardworking individuals 
at the Department of Education for 
working through the caseload under 
the Obama standard. Your hard work of 
processing more than 5,000 cases per 
week for borrowers seeking relief has 
not gone unnoticed. 
A vote against this veto override is a 
vote in favor of creating a system that 
is fairer for students and taxpayers. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
oppose this resolution. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from North Carolina (Ms. ADAMS), the 
chair of the Workforce Protections 
Subcommittee and also chair of the 
HBCU Caucus. 
Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of this measure to override the 
President’s veto and to stand up for our 
Nation’s 20 million college students. 
Secretary DeVos’ rule would harm 
tens of thousands of college students 
and would allow bad actors to continue 
some of the worst practices, such as 
forcing students to sign pre-arbitration 
agreements that limit their rights. We 
cannot allow predatory institutions to 
steal the dream of a college degree 
from any child. 
It is shameful that in his veto mes-
sage, President Trump used histori-
cally Black colleges and universities, 
HBCUs, as cover for his pro-fraud, anti- 
student agenda. 
Now, let’s be clear. No HBCU has 
ever been implicated in a borrower de-
fense claim, and no HBCU has voiced 
support for Secretary DeVos’ rule. 
That is fake news. 
It is time that President Trump and 
Secretary DeVos began standing up for 
North Carolinians seeking opportunity 
instead of lying down to our Nation’s 
worst institutions. And if they won’t 
do it, Congress will. 
It is a fundamental right. Du Bois 
told us: ‘‘Of all of the civil rights for 
which the world has struggled and 
fought . . . the right to learn is . . . the 
most fundamental.’’ 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to gen-
tleman from Alabama (Mr. BYRNE). 
Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to overriding Presi-
dent Trump’s veto of H.J. Res. 76. 
Everyone in this Chamber can agree 
that schools that commit fraud and 
take advantage of students must be 
held accountable. However, returning 
to the 2016 borrower defense rule put in 
place by the Obama administration is 
not the answer. 
Put simply, the Obama-era rule sends 
millions of taxpayer dollars to those 
who were not harmed by their univer-
sity. Under the Obama-era rule, the 
standard to define fraud was placed so 
low that the Department of Education 
saw about 300,000 relief applications in 
just 5 years. Compare that to the just 
59 applications in the previous 20 years 
the borrower defense process has been 
in place. 
Understanding 
this 
problem, 
the 
Trump administration released an up-
dated borrower defense rule in 2019 to 
prevent fraud, ensure taxpayer dollars 
are spent responsibly, and cut the regu-
latory red tape that has made it dif-
ficult for students and educational in-
stitutions to understand the old rule. 
The new rule also ensures that due 
process, a founding principle of our Na-
tion, is in place for both students and 
institutions. 
The cost of allowing the Obama rule 
to stand is great, over 40 billion tax-
payer dollars. Thankfully, the changes 
made by the Trump administration 
will save taxpayers billions while still 
ensuring that students are protected 
from fraud. 
The Trump administration rule ap-
plies relief where it is needed, unlike 
the overly broad Obama-era rule. This 
should be something both parties can 
support. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that 
students who are defrauded by edu-
cational institutions deserve debt re-
lief, but the Obama-era rule is not the 
answer. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ 
and sustain the President’s veto. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, the 
American people do not support Betsy 
DeVos. 
We don’t support her radical at-
tempts to privatize education. 
We don’t support her corrupt efforts 
to take coronavirus relief away from 
public schools so that it can be sent to 
private ones. 
We 
don’t 
support 
her 
hateful, 
transphobic agenda or her attacks on 
survivors of sexual assault. 
And we do not support her putting 
predatory, 
for-profit 
colleges 
over 
those they cheated with a rule that 
would force the most vulnerable stu-
dents who were robbed to repay 97 per-
cent of what they borrowed. That is 
why Congress passed H.J. Res. 76, with 
bipartisan support. 
But just as Vice President PENCE had 
to save Betsy DeVos’ Senate confirma-
tion, President Trump is trying to save 
her dangerous rule against our bipar-
tisan bill. 
So I urge my colleagues to override 
this veto, and, once again, let’s make 
clear that the people’s House stands on 
the side of the people and not Betsy 
DeVos. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Kansas (Mr. WATKINS). 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
opposition to this costly resolution 
that would allow more fraud, waste, 
and abuse. 
No one condones fraud, especially 
when it is perpetrated by an institute 
of higher learning. Every student who 
is financially defrauded is entitled to 
relief and forgiveness, period. But we 
should make sure that we are helping 
those who have been defrauded. It is 
our job to do due diligence for the 
American taxpayer. 
The Trump administration has made 
this a priority, unlike the Obama ad-
ministration. They used the rule to for-
give as many student loans as they 
could. They would even target institu-
tions they didn’t like. That is partisan. 
It is costly to the taxpayer, and it is 
harmful to the student. That is why I 
support Secretary DeVos and President 
Trump. Their borrower defense rule 
takes taxpayers into account. 
After seeing the enormous price tag 
of $42 billion that the Obama rule cre-
ated, President Trump and Secretary 
DeVos acted swiftly to take that bur-
den off the backs of the taxpayers. I 
thank the President and Secretary 
DeVos. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2553 
June 26, 2020 
from Pennsylvania (Ms. WILD), a dis-
tinguished member of the Committee 
on Education and Labor. 
Ms. WILD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of H.J. Res. 76. 
Students defrauded by predatory, for- 
profit colleges can be left with crush-
ing debt, useless degrees, and none of 
the job opportunities they were prom-
ised. 
Secretary DeVos could provide im-
mediate relief to students who were de-
frauded. Instead, she has halted stu-
dent loan relief and written a new rule 
under which defrauded borrowers could 
be denied debt relief, even when preda-
tory colleges clearly violated the law. 
Earlier this year, bipartisan majori-
ties in the House and the Senate voted 
together to reject that rule, but Presi-
dent Trump has vetoed our legisla-
tion—yet another of his actions that 
will hurt students and taxpayers. 
More than 7,000 Pennsylvanians are 
suffering while their applications for 
financial relief are sitting in limbo at 
the Department of Education. If Con-
gress does not override the President’s 
veto, 
student 
borrowers 
will 
be 
harmed, and predatory colleges will re-
ceive another giveaway. 
I am proud to stand with students 
and to vote to override the President’s 
veto of H.J. Res. 76. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gen-
tleman from Kentucky (Mr. GUTHRIE). 
Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today, yet again, to urge my colleagues 
to vote ‘‘no’’ on today’s vote to over-
ride the President’s veto of H.J. Res. 
76. 
It is unconscionable that any institu-
tion of higher education would engage 
in 
fraudulent 
misrepresentation 
to 
prey on student loan borrowers, par-
ticularly veterans who are able to qual-
ify for GI benefits to attend schools. 
President Trump’s commonsense rule 
would help students who were de-
frauded and suffered financial harm by 
any school, giving them the oppor-
tunity to individually make their case, 
ensuring due process for all parties. It 
would also save taxpayers $11 billion, 
compared to President Obama’s last- 
minute, one-size-fits-all rule that did 
not hold schools accountable. 
As a member of the Education and 
Labor 
Committee 
and 
the 
former 
chairman of the Higher Education Sub-
committee, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ today. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HARDER), a distin-
guished member of the Committee on 
Education and Labor. 
Mr. 
HARDER 
of 
California. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to encourage my 
colleagues to vote to protect my con-
stituents who were scammed by for- 
profit colleges. 
Both the House and the Senate took 
bipartisan votes to protect these stu-
dents, but the President overruled our 
votes, siding with Secretary DeVos and 
her billionaire donors. 
This issue hits home for me. I met a 
woman named Artemisa, who attended 
a corrupt college in my district. She 
studied to be a nurse and graduated 
with $40,000 in debt, but no one would 
hire her. She is still paying off that 
debt to this day. 
And it is not just Artemisa. Thou-
sands of students at scam colleges 
across the country have similar sto-
ries. And if Secretary DeVos’ new plan 
isn’t stopped, these student borrowers 
may never get the justice they deserve. 
That is not what we do in this coun-
try. 
If Secretary DeVos is concerned 
about cost, she should talk to her bil-
lionaire friends in the corrupt college 
industry. The criminals should not be 
putting the financial burden on the vic-
tims of this fraud. 
I encourage everyone to vote to over-
turn the President’s veto. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. WATERS), the chair of 
the Committee on Financial Services. 
b 1230 
Ms. WATERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman SCOTT for yielding to me on 
this important issue. 
I rise to override the President’s veto 
of H.J. Res. 76, which undoes a Sec-
retary DeVos rule that would make it 
nearly impossible for veterans and stu-
dent borrowers defrauded by their 
schools to obtain financial relief. 
Congress voted, on a bipartisan basis, 
to reject Secretary DeVos’ borrower 
defense rule, which only cancels 3 per-
cent of the student loans resulting 
from school misconduct, keeping 97 
percent of our veterans and student 
borrowers drowning in debt they only 
incurred due to fraud and from which 
they may never recover. 
If 
Secretary 
DeVos’ 
efforts 
to 
prioritize profit over education are al-
lowed to stand, then the for-profit in-
dustry will continue to do what it al-
ways has: exploit veterans, student 
borrowers, and those trying to better 
their lives and support their families 
by obtaining an education. 
This is a fight with which I am deep-
ly familiar. This Congress, the House 
Financial Services Committee held two 
hearings examining the student loan 
crisis and approved three bills that will 
provide strong student borrower pro-
tections, including for those harmed by 
for-profit colleges. And during this 
COVID–19 crisis, I have fought to pro-
vide up to $10,000 of relief for private 
student loan borrowers, and I continue 
to fight to protect student loan bor-
rowers who should not have to deal 
with debt collections, negative credit 
reporting, late fees, and penalties while 
dealing with this pandemic. 
With over 200,000 pending borrower 
defense applications for loan relief, 
these students desperately need and de-
serve our help. 
I urge my colleagues to support vet-
erans and student borrowers by over-
riding the President’s veto of H.J. Res. 
76. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the 
chair 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Sub-
committee 
on 
Labor, 
Health 
and 
Human Services, Education, and Re-
lated Agencies. 
Ms. DELAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I rise to 
support this override. 
Predatory for-profit colleges scam 
students and taxpayers out of millions 
of dollars. Predatory for-profit colleges 
account for 9 percent of students in 
postsecondary education but 33 percent 
of defaults. 
To help students, the Department of 
Education under the Obama adminis-
tration created a streamlined resolu-
tion process under the borrower de-
fense to repayment provision of the 
Higher Education Act. Now, Secretary 
DeVos is breaking the process. 
I will tell you what her goal is. It is 
to aid the perpetrators, not to help the 
victims. Under her new rule, borrowers 
lose out. They lose out if they cannot 
prove the school intentionally de-
frauded them, if they cannot file their 
claim fast enough, or if they cannot 
document their exact financial harm. 
As a result, as little as 3 percent of 
eligible debt will be forgiven now. 
What little relief there is now will like-
ly be shouldered by taxpayers, not the 
schools committing the fraud. 
Stopping the Secretary as we are 
pushing to do has wide support: 20 
State attorneys general and nearly 60 
advocacy groups for students, civil 
rights, and education. The American 
Legion has said: ‘‘Deception against 
our veterans and servicemembers has 
been a lucrative scam for unscrupulous 
actors.’’ 
So I say to my Republican colleagues 
who want to support the military: Sup-
port this override. 
And to those of us who want to fight 
for racial and economic justice: Sup-
port this override. 
In 2018, we wrote to the Secretary, 
alarmed about how this rule could hurt 
students of color: ‘‘Ninety-five percent 
of Black students attending a for-profit 
college took out student loans, and a 
staggering 75 percent of Black students 
who did not complete their programs 
defaulted.’’ 
We must act now for veterans, for 
students of color, for borrowers across 
this country. In Connecticut, 1,100 de-
frauded students are waiting to be 
made whole. They need this override, 
not that cruel policy. Vote to override. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
before I yield to the gentleman from 
Rhode Island, I would like to remind

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2554 
June 26, 2020 
our colleagues that just yesterday a 
Federal court ruled that the Depart-
ment of Education must provide full 
relief for 7,200 defrauded Massachusetts 
student borrowers who attended Corin-
thian Colleges. Unfortunately, there 
are still borrowers around the country 
still waiting for relief. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. 
CICILLINE), a member of the House Ju-
diciary Committee. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. I rise in 
strong support of the resolution to 
override the President’s veto. 
In 2016, the Obama administration 
issued the borrower defense rule in 
order to provide relief to student bor-
rowers defrauded by predatory for-prof-
it institutions, which promised an edu-
cation and credentials to pursue a ca-
reer only to find these credentials did 
not have the value they were promised. 
In the aftermath of the collapse of in-
stitutions like Corinthian Colleges and 
ITT Technical Institute, the Obama ad-
ministration sought to provide relief to 
those students left out in the cold. 
The borrower defense rule provided a 
path to relief to those students who 
sought to receive an education but 
were instead left with nothing but debt 
and few paths forward. 
Sadly and predictably, the Trump ad-
ministration ended these protections 
and implemented a rule making it 
harder to obtain relief, siding with 
predatory for-profit institutions rather 
than the victims—the students and 
veterans—of these wrongdoers. 
According to the Institute for College 
Access and Success, the number of stu-
dents eligible to seek debt relief or 
loan forgiveness will drop from 53 per-
cent of borrowers under the Obama-era 
rule to just 3 percent under the Trump 
rule. 
In response, Congress, in a bipartisan 
way, came together to reject the ad-
ministration’s rule change, rejecting 
efforts to leave defrauded students out 
in the cold. The President vetoed this 
relief. Now, Congress must once again 
stand on the side of those who sought 
to obtain a higher education and pro-
vide a better life for their lives and 
family. 
I urge adoption of the override reso-
lution. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PORTER), a mem-
ber of the Financial Services and Over-
sight and Reform Committees. 
Ms. PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Under the Higher Education Act, stu-
dents who are defrauded by private 
predatory colleges are entitled to relief 
on their loans. The prior administra-
tion created a streamlined process to 
help defrauded borrowers access relief 
and move forward with their lives. 
Secretary DeVos tried to strip those 
protections away, but we fought back. 
Some of my Republican colleagues in 
the House and Senate voted with us to 
overturn Secretary Betsy DeVos’ new 
rule. We came together to defend stu-
dents and to stand up against fraud, 
waste, and abuse. 
But President Trump vetoed this im-
portant resolution. Instead of standing 
with students and taxpayers, President 
Trump stood with corrupt private col-
leges and Secretary DeVos. 
Today, I ask my Republican friends: 
Do you want to stand with our coun-
try’s students, with the future of our 
workforce and our communities, or do 
you want to betray them to please the 
President? I think the choice is clear, 
and I hope you do, too. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
could you advise how much time is re-
maining on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Virginia has 9 minutes re-
maining. The gentlewoman from North 
Carolina has 7 minutes remaining. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Iowa (Ms. FINKENAUER). 
Ms. FINKENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise in support of this resolution in 
overriding the President’s veto. 
I want to talk about two Iowans who 
tried taking a step forward but were 
knocked two steps back by a for-profit 
school looking for an easy buck and 
taking advantage of the hopes and 
dreams of my constituents. 
Julie, a mother from Iowa, was look-
ing to boost her career, and Jeff, an 
Army reservist and construction man-
ager, was trying to continue his edu-
cation. 
They bought into ITT Technical In-
stitute’s promises, worked hard for new 
career opportunities, and took out 
loans to do it. Both had their lives 
turned upside down when ITT Tech-
nical Institute suddenly closed. 
A 2016 Federal rule forgave loans for 
folks like Julie and Jeff, who were ob-
viously taken advantage of. 
Unfortunately, this administration 
decided to roll back the commonsense 
rule, weakening protections for bor-
rowers. 
In our State, there are more than 
1,000 borrowers who were taken advan-
tage of and who are still waiting for 
their cases to be resolved. 
We must stand with them and over-
ride the President’s veto of this resolu-
tion. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Ms. TLAIB), a member 
of the Financial Services Committee 
and Oversight and Reform Committee. 
Ms. TLAIB. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
In January of this year, I stood here 
to speak against this administration’s 
continued attack on our students. Five 
months later, Secretary DeVos, with 
the support of this administration, 
continues to work on behalf of preda-
tory for-profit institutions rather than 
the students they lied to that they 
scammed. 
Instead of ensuring that students 
who were cheated out of their future by 
this these fraudulent institutions re-
ceive debt relief, Secretary DeVos is 
fighting to ensure that these institu-
tions are never held accountable. 
Both 
Democratic 
and 
Republican 
Members alike agreed that if you were 
defrauded by one of these colleges, then 
your Federal student loan should be 
forgiven. We must stop this adminis-
tration’s relentless efforts to protect 
the pockets of predatory corporations 
at the expense of our students. I am 
proud to support this veto override. 
Ms. FOXX of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. Speaker, contrary to the Demo-
crats’ claims that we have heard today, 
the Trump administration and Repub-
licans in the House are committed to 
providing relief to students who have 
been truly harmed by fraudulent prac-
tices. 
The 
Obama 
administration’s 
bor-
rower defense rule, though, was ex-
tremely difficult to administer. It left 
students and institutions confused, en-
couraged massive and unnecessary loan 
forgiveness, and created a hefty bill for 
taxpayers. Anyone who believes it was 
a streamlined process, I will show you 
some swampland in New Mexico. 
President Trump acted quickly to 
protect borrowers and taxpayers bet-
ter. The 2019 borrower defense rule 
clarified standards and made a process 
more accessible. 
If Democrats overturn the Presi-
dent’s veto, we will be left with the 
convoluted Obama rule. Under the 
rules associated with today’s legisla-
tion, there can be no revisions made 
even to improve or clarify the Obama 
rule. 
We want all schools to serve students 
well. In particular, we want veterans 
and their education benefits protected. 
In this administration, they will be. 
Mr. Speaker, I have worked hard all 
my life to help people get a good edu-
cation and have a better life. I would 
not be supporting the overturn of this 
rule if that was not the direction in 
which we were going. The Education 
Department’s borrower defense rule 
protects all student borrowers, includ-
ing veterans; holds higher education 
institutions accountable; and saves 
taxpayers $11 billion. 
Unfortunately, Democrats will stop 
at nothing to tear down meaningful re-
forms 
ushered 
in 
under 
President 
Trump’s leadership, even if it comes at 
the expense of our Nation’s students. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
I yield myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, we have heard a lot 
about $11 billion. Let me tell you ex-
actly what that is. That is $11 billion

that students who have been defrauded 
will now have to pay if this resolution 
fails. 
According to the fraud formula from 
the Department of Education, even 
those who can prove fraud can expect 
relief, on average, to go from about 50 
percent of their debt down to 3 percent 
of their debt. Many, because of that 
formula, will get absolutely nothing. 
b 1245 
Mr. Speaker, now is the time that we 
have a choice. We can give relief to 
students, especially veterans who have 
been defrauded by predatory colleges, 
or make them pay student loans even 
though they received a worthless edu-
cational experience. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
side with the students and vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without 
objection, the previous question is or-
dered. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is, Will the House, on recon-

the objections of the President to the 
contrary notwithstanding.

ESTABLISHING 
JOINT 
CONGRES-
SIONAL 
COMMITTEE 
ON 
INAU-
GURAL CEREMONIES 
Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I ask unanimous consent to take 
from the Speaker’s table the concur-
rent resolution (S. Con. Res. 38) to es-
tablish the Joint Congressional Com-
mittee on Inaugural Ceremonies for the 
inauguration of the President-elect and 
Vice President-elect of the United 
States on January 20, 2021, and ask for 
its immediate consideration in the 
House. 
The Clerk read the title of the con-
current resolution. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
DINGELL). Is there objection to the re-
quest of the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia? 
There was no objection. 
The text of the concurrent resolution 
is as follows: 
S. CON. RES. 38 
Resolved by the Senate (the House of Rep-
resentatives concurring), 
SECTION 1. ESTABLISHMENT OF JOINT COM-
MITTEE. 
There is established a Joint Congressional 
Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies (in this 
resolution referred to as the ‘‘joint com-
mittee’’) consisting of 3 Senators and 3 Mem-
bers of the House of Representatives, to be 
appointed by the President of the Senate and 
the Speaker of the House of Representatives, 
respectively. The joint committee is author-
ized to make the necessary arrangements for 
the inauguration of the President-elect and 
Vice President-elect of the United States on 
January 20, 2021. 
SEC. 2. SUPPORT OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE. 
The joint committee— 
(1) is authorized to utilize appropriate 
equipment and the services of appropriate 
personnel of departments and agencies of the 
Federal Government, under arrangements 
between the joint committee and the heads 
of those departments and agencies, in con-
nection with the inaugural proceedings and 
ceremonies; and 
(2) may accept gifts and donations of goods 
and services to carry out its responsibilities. 
The concurrent resolution was con-
curred in. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
RECESS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 12(a) of rule I, the Chair 
declares the House in recess for a pe-
riod of less than 15 minutes. 
Accordingly (at 2 o’clock and 45 min-
utes p.m.), the House stood in recess. 
f 
b 1459 
AFTER RECESS 
The recess having expired, the House 
was called to order by the Speaker pro 
tempore (Mrs. DINGELL) at 2 o’clock 
and 59 minutes p.m. 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. FERGUSON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise for the purpose of inquiring of the 
majority leader the schedule for the 
week to come. I yield to my friend 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the major-
ity leader. 
Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman 
from Georgia for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, on Monday, the 
House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning- 
hour debate. I would repeat that be-
cause it is unusual. On Monday, we are 
meeting at 9 a.m. for morning-hour de-
bate and 10 a.m. for legislative busi-
ness, with votes expected to occur as 
early as 2:30 p.m. 
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the 
House will meet at 9 a.m. for morning- 
hour debate and 10 a.m. for legislative 
business. 
On Thursday, the House will meet at 
9 a.m. for legislative business. 
The House will consider H.R. 1425, the 
Patient Protection and Affordable Care 
Enhancement Act. This bill will sig-
nificantly increase the ACA’s afford-
ability and subsidies, lower prescrip-
tion drug prices, expand coverage, and 
crack down on junk plans, while 
strengthening protections for people 
with preexisting conditions and ad-
dressing racial health disparities. 
The House will also consider, Madam 
Speaker, H.R. 7301, which is the Emer-
gency Housing Protection and Relief 
Act of 2020. This bill would authorize 
nearly $200 billion for the dire housing 
needs arising due to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
H.R. 7301, which was included in the 
HEROES Act, would help renters and 
homeowners by extending the eviction 
and foreclosure moratoria and pro-
viding $100 billion for emergency rental 
assistance; $75 billion for homeowners 
assistance to cover mortgages, prop-
erty taxes, and utilities; and more than 
$11 billion for homeless assistance pro-
grams. 
I would again reiterate that that bill 
passed as a part of the HEROES Act, 
which is now pending in the Senate. 
Lastly, the House will consider H.R. 
2, the Moving Forward Act. This bill 
would invest more than $1.5 trillion in 
modern, 
sustainable 
infrastructure, 
while creating millions of good-paying 
jobs; combating the climate crisis; and 
addressing disparities in urban, subur-
ban, and rural communities. 
The bill includes a 5-year reauthor-
ization of the surface transportation 
program, invests in schools with the 
Reopen and Rebuild America’s Schools 
Act, invests over $100 billion in our Na-
tion’s affordable housing infrastruc-
ture, delivers affordable high-speed 
broadband internet access to all parts 
of the country, and promotes new clean 
renewable energy infrastructure. 
We expect, at that point in time, to 
be out on Thursday for the July Fourth 
break. I would tell the House that the 
2 weeks that will follow the July

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2558 
June 26, 2020 
Fourth weekend will be reserved, as 
were the first weeks in June, for com-
mittees to do their work, in particular, 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act being considered by the House 
Armed Services Committee. 
That bill is, obviously, very lengthy. 
It composes a little more than half of 
the discretionary spending, and we ex-
pect the committee to need substantial 
time to mark up that bill. 
In addition, the Appropriations Com-
mittee will be marking up its 12 bills 
for consideration by the House. 
Then, the last 2 weeks, we will be 
taking the products that will not be 
limited to the NDAA and the appro-
priations bills, but we will be primarily 
taking up the time with other legisla-
tion that will be promoted and sent to 
the floor for consideration by the com-
mittees. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
very much appreciate that update. 
Question: Does the gentleman expect 
to consider amendments to H.R. 2, the 
transportation bill, on the floor next 
week? 
I yield to the gentleman from Mary-
land. 
Mr. HOYER. Yes. I talked to Mr. 
MCCARTHY
yesterday. Obviously, be-
cause 
of 
the 
timeframe 
that 
the 
COVID–19 health strictures have im-
posed upon us, it takes a long time to 
vote on amendments. So, rather than 
consider amendments individually, the 
leader and I talked about having 
amendments 
either 
in 
manager’s 
amendments or in amendments that 
have a lot of individual amendments 
within them. And they will be consid-
ered en gros so that there may well be 
a lot of amendments, but we hope to 
hold the votes down to a manageable 
level. 
As the gentleman knows, votes have 
been taking about an hour. If we took 
every amendment seriatim, frankly, we 
wouldn’t finish until September. So, we 
are trying to manage that, and we are 
working with the minority leader. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, I 
am happy to hear that. But it seems 
kind of odd that this week, when we 
were considering the police reform bill, 
there were no amendment consider-
ations. 
I believe the majority leader, Madam 
Speaker, said on the floor that we have 
constraints on amendments because of 
the coronavirus. So I ask, if there were 
amendment constraints this week, do 
those same constraints exist next 
week? 
Mr. HOYER. No, it turns out that we 
considered the bill in the House the 
same way the majority leader in the 
Senate wanted to consider the Scott 
bill, or the Republican policing bill. So, 
both Houses wanted to consider them, 
apparently, in the same way. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Well, I certainly ap-
preciate that, but I was a little dis-
appointed this week, in the fact that I 
thought we had a chance to make the 
police reform bill better. It was a gen-
uine effort on both sides of the aisle to 
have this discussion. 
But once again, the Republican voice 
was left out. There were some really 
good amendments and ideas from my 
side that simply did not gain consider-
ation on the floor, and they should 
have. 
One such example was the Cline 
amendment that really would have dis-
couraged collective bargaining agree-
ments with organizations that really 
kind of had poor officer disciplinary 
tactics, something that could have fun-
damentally changed how departments 
operate in big cities. 
But anyway, it is a disappointment. I 
hate that we did not get to do that. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. FERGUSON. I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. We are hopeful that the 
Senate will pass a bill. I know that my 
friend will say, Well, yes, but it is the 
Democrats that stopped the bill. 
Let me tell the gentleman, I genu-
inely hope that we have a bill passed 
by the Senate, that we go to con-
ference, and that we adopt a bill that 
can garner the support of the majority 
of the House and the Senate and can be 
signed by the President of the United 
States. 
As I said on the floor when we consid-
ered the bill, KAREN BASS, the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, and those of us 
who strongly supported the bill, we 
don’t want to send a message. We want 
to make a difference. To the extent 
that making a difference requires us to 
have agreement between the two par-
ties, I am hopeful we will get to that 
objective. 
Mr. 
FERGUSON. 
Reclaiming 
my 
time, those words are fine now. But 
when we talk about having agreement 
and talk about having those discus-
sions, Madam Speaker, clearly, the 
committee and this body should be 
considering it as an entire body. The 
opportunity for us to consider those 
amendments here on the floor of the 
House is really important. 
But we understand that the minority 
in the Senate blocked debate and con-
tinuation of Mr. Scott’s bill, Senator 
SCOTT’s bill, which was, quite candidly, 
an excellent piece of legislation. If any-
one has not seen his remarks on the 
Senate floor and his speech, I would 
highly encourage you to do it. 
That was a disappointment. But 
then, to hear the majority leader say 
that we are going to eliminate debate 
in this House simply to do it in con-
ference, I think we deserve a better op-
portunity than that. 
But I understand. You are in the ma-
jority, and that is the way that you all 
have chosen to do that. But, hopefully, 
we can get to that point where we can 
have those honest debates right here 
on the House floor. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. FERGUSON. For just a minute. 
Mr. HOYER. The gentleman will 
surely note that when his party was in 
power and was scheduling bills, you 
had the most closed rules of any Con-
gress in the history of the Congress. 
Mr. FERGUSON. It seems to me that 
I voted on a lot more amendments last 
year than I have this year. We probably 
did have more closed bills, but we 
seemed to have a lot more legislative 
activity. It seemed to be a lot more 
productive. 
But anyway, Madam Speaker, an-
other thing that is concerning to me is 
that I am disappointed about what has 
transpired in the House over the recent 
weeks. For the first time in 230 years, 
Members had to elect to come to D.C. 
to represent their constituents, but 
they no longer need to do that. Instead, 
they can now turn their voting cards 
over to another Member, including 
Speaker PELOSI, or any other Member, 
and have them vote in their place using 
this new proxy vote scheme. 
One thing that I am thankful for is 
that the covered period for this laid 
out by the Speaker comes to an end 
July Fourth, and we look forward to 
seeing all the Members come back to 
do their jobs. 
Since many States are fully re-
opened, and even here in D.C., phase 2 
reopening is in its place, and you can 
go to restaurants and gyms. As a mat-
ter of fact, we can even now go to the 
House gym again. And most employees 
are returning to work. 
With that said, I would like to con-
firm with the gentleman that he does 
not plan to extend the July Fourth 
covered period and continue this ab-
surd proxy voting scheme. 
Mr. HOYER. First of all, of course, I 
reject emphatically the premise that 
this is absurd. As the gentleman 
knows, there were some 70, some weeks 
ago, who cast a vote. There were 30 
today. They cast their votes because 
they were concerned about their health 
or families’ health to whom they would 
return. 
I think the gentleman probably has 
been reading, as well, and maybe lis-
tening to the extraordinary spike in 
cases that have been identified and the 
concern that hospital beds will be over-
run. 
We will end this when the medical 
community, not somebody who has no 
medical knowledge and very little com-
mand of the facts, tells us it is time to 
get together again. When he told peo-
ple to do that, they did get together, 10 
of whom apparently work for the White 
House who have gotten infected, and, 
frankly, spikes in Florida, Texas, Ari-
zona, and, yes, even California and 
some other States as well, including 
Arkansas. 
Now, I am not sure exactly what the 
figures are in the gentleman’s State. 
But, Madam Speaker, I believe that we 
are going to continue to be concerned 
about the health of the Members, the 
health of the staff, the health of the 
people who cover us on behalf of the 
American people. 
So, I can’t tell the gentleman wheth-
er it is going to end because I can’t tell 
you when the pandemic is going to end.

H2559 
June 26, 2020 
I can’t tell you when the spike in the 
numbers of people who are getting sick 
or people who are dying is going to end. 
But I can tell you that we will be 
very sensitive to the risks, and we will 
act accordingly. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Well, certainly, we 
want to be safe and thoughtful about 
what we do. But I think America—I 
think we have done an excellent job of 
what we set out to do, which was not to 
stop the spread of this virus, but it was 
to slow the spread of the virus. 
Not a single one of us, not a single 
person in America, wanted to see one 
of our fellow Americans suffer because 
there was no room for them in a 
healthcare facility where they needed 
it. And I think that we have done that. 
I think America has shown that they 
have had the discipline to say at home 
and to bend the infection rate curve 
down. 
So, sure, there will be more Ameri-
cans that contract COVID. But thank 
goodness that our healthcare system is 
strong enough and intact that we have 
the capacity to take care of the most 
vulnerable. 
Speaking of that, I think, as I have 
watched a lot of the news, a lot of the 
data, I am very, very, very concerned 
about the most vulnerable in our Na-
tion. I think one of the most horrific 
things that has happened seems to be 
the blatant disregard for rules from 
CDC and CMS by some Governors, 
where they returned COVID-positive 
patients to the nursing homes, where 
they were able to infect the most vul-
nerable. 
So, I would ask the majority leader, 
do you think that there will be legisla-
tion considering how to protect our pa-
tients in nursing homes and also to 
really hold those accountable that vio-
lated the rules and were reckless with 
our fellow Americans’ lives? 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman from 
Georgia yield? 
Mr. FERGUSON. I yield to the gen-
tleman. 
Mr. HOYER. I hesitate to ask the 
gentleman a question I don’t know the 
answer to, so I won’t. But I don’t know 
which Governors the gentleman is 
talking about. But I will, certainly, 
want to find that out from the gen-
tleman at some point in time. 
Mr. 
FERGUSON. 
Reclaiming 
my 
time for just a minute, sir, I would 
refer you to the special committee led 
by the gentleman from South Carolina, 
Mr. CLYBURN. And I would refer you to 
the data that is coming out of that 
committee that clearly indicates where 
those particular States are. 
Mr. HOYER. Let me tell the gen-
tleman that we certainly intend to 
continue, as I said, to try to protect 
the American people. A lot of people 
have died. Over 122,000 people have 
died. 
Mr. FERGUSON. And every one is a 
tragic loss. 
b 1515 
Mr. HOYER. The President of the 
United States said this virus was a 
hoax. 
Because he said it was a hoax, people 
thought they didn’t have to worry 
about it. I tell my friend from Georgia, 
a hoax. He is a gentlemen who refuses 
to set the example of wearing a mask, 
which the science and medical people 
say we ought to do, a gentleman who 
really shunted aside much of the 
science and medical advice that he got. 
So I tell the gentleman we hope that 
the President is as concerned as my 
friend has stated he is, and I know that 
I am and I think all of our Members 
are. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time, I am certainly glad 
to hear that my colleague from Mary-
land is truly committed to making 
sure that every single American stays 
as safe as they possibly can. When 
those incidents occurred where rules 
were violated, regulations were dis-
regarded, there was, in fact, harm 
caused to our fellow Americans. 
I tell my friend I am glad to know he 
is as committed to getting to the bot-
tom of that as well, because I believe 
he is a man of honor and integrity. I 
believe his commitment to lead it to 
going to where the data and facts are, 
I tell my friend I am awfully glad to 
hear that. 
Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. FERGUSON. I yield to the gen-
tleman from Maryland. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I hope 
the gentleman has as high an expecta-
tion for the President of the United 
States as he has of others. 
Mr. FERGUSON. Oh, Madam Speak-
er, not only is there an expectation, 
there is gratitude for the work that the 
President and the administration have 
done to get information out, to expand 
testing, to go out to make sure that 
the resources were delivered to our col-
leagues in the great State of New York, 
resources there to build extra hospital 
beds that nursing home patients could 
have gone to but, unfortunately, were 
sent back to their nursing homes. 
Yes, I am grateful not only for his 
commitment to America, but I am 
grateful for the fact that he has helped 
lead this country and will continue to 
lead this country back. So, yes, we 
should all expect a lot of ourselves. We 
should be committed to the greatness 
of this country, as I know that we all 
are. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2562 
June 26, 2020 
Our credit reporting system is badly 
broken, and consumers have little re-
course. It should be no surprise that 
consumer complaints regarding credit 
reporting errors and failed attempts to 
fix these errors are consistently a top 
complaint submitted to the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau and the 
Federal Trade Commission. This dem-
onstrates that millions of consumers 
are frustrated with the current system 
and need our help. 
H.R. 5332 would direct the nationwide 
consumer reporting agencies to create 
a streamlined, single online portal for 
consumers to have easy access to free 
credit reports, credit scores, dispute er-
rors, and place security freezes. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 5332. 
I want to first thank the gentleman 
from New Jersey for his work on this 
bill. I am disappointed we were not 
able to come to a bipartisan com-
promise. We worked for the better part 
of a year to try to achieve a good prod-
uct that could broadly be supported. 
This product does not represent that 
work, sadly. Unfortunately, we didn’t 
get there. 
I believe that we are considering, 
today, a bill that is just another at-
tempt for House Democrats to socialize 
the credit reporting and scoring indus-
try. We are voting on a bill that will 
decrease competition, increase fraud, 
prop up the trial bar, and expand au-
thority of an already unaccountable 
CFPB, Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau. 
First, this bill directs the three na-
tionwide credit reporting agencies to 
create a shared online portal. This por-
tal will allow unlimited and free con-
sumer access to credit information— 
this is good—and credit freezes. This is 
good and allows consumers to initiate 
disputes. 
That all sounds very good. In fact, 
Republicans support a one-stop shop 
for consumers to access important 
credit information. But we are talking 
about the three largest players in the 
industry, and this bill codifies their 
place—their oligopoly structure and 
their favored view of the current mar-
ketplace—and enshrines them further 
into law with this outsized authority. 
This bill condones their market 
structure by mandating that many of 
their services be merged into a single 
web portal. This doesn’t make things 
better; it makes it worse. 
If Congress really wants to protect 
consumers, we should be working to 
promote more competition in the cred-
it reporting and scoring industry. We 
should be promoting new ways to 
eliminate barriers to entry, not pro-
moting what really comes down to less 
consumer choice. 
Second, this bill requires the com-
plete Social Security numbers be used 
to confirm the consumer’s identity. So 
here is the problem: The bill fails to set 
appropriate standards to protect that 
information. Specifically, the bill di-
rects the credit reporting agencies to 
match all nine digits of a consumer’s 
Social Security number before includ-
ing any information in consumer credit 
reports. 
That sounds well, fine, and good, but 
we know hacks happen. As Federal em-
ployees, we have had our information 
hacked and sold. Just look at the cred-
it reporting agencies. They have had 
their information hacked and sold. 
This is why we wanted to come to a bi-
partisan compromise. 
There is something legitimate we 
should be doing, but today, not all data 
furnishers collect full Social Security 
numbers for submission for consumer 
credit information to the credit bu-
reaus. That means this bill has a re-
quirement now that they collect all the 
Social Security information to confirm 
the consumer’s identity. This will po-
tentially 
have 
two 
negative 
con-
sequences for consumers. 
First, data that is not already linked 
to that Social Security number will be 
excluded from credit bureaus. That 
means, under this bill, accurate infor-
mation will be removed for no other 
reason than it is missing the Social Se-
curity number. 
This will actually decrease the pre-
dictive power of credit files. That is a 
negative for consumers. That, in turn, 
will jeopardize the ability to get low- 
cost credit for consumers, especially 
for those who are on the margin where 
much of their information is derived by 
being a consumer and paying back reg-
ular consumer debt. 
Second, data furnishers will start ag-
gressively capturing and storing Social 
Security numbers for consumers just 
so the data can be used in the credit 
models. That means that our Social Se-
curity number will be in more places 
and identity theft can then increase 
with more opportunities to steal our 
information. It means that consumers 
will be further at peril for fraudulent 
activities by bad and malicious actors. 
So committee Republicans have con-
sistently expressed concern with the 
private sector and government use of 
Social Security numbers for identity 
verification. I think we should all 
agree on that. This bill will only exac-
erbate the problem by statutorily di-
recting an increase in reliance on this 
very highly personal information. 
Next, this bill creates an additional 
opportunity for trial lawyers to exploit 
the litigation system, ultimately rais-
ing the cost of credit for all consumers. 
The bill expands the private right of 
action under the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act to allow for injunctive relief. It 
further provides plaintiffs with com-
pensation for attorney fees, and more 
litigation means increased costs asso-
ciated with credit reporting. 
Additionally, this bill allows con-
sumers to continuously dispute infor-
mation even if the account is verified 
as accurate, promoting an endless 
cycle of frivolous reinvestigations and 
decreasing the effectiveness of credit 
reporting. 
Lastly, this bill continues the Demo-
crats’ goal of expanding the statutory 
authority of the Consumer Financial 
Protection Bureau, or the CFPB. The 
bill creates duplicative ombudsmen in 
the CFPB for credit reporting, some-
thing that they currently have, but the 
person has more than just consumer 
credit reporting responsibilities. 
Since its creation, congressional Re-
publicans have fought to place this un-
accountable government agency under 
the annual appropriations process and 
have argued that the single-Director 
structure is unconstitutional. That is 
being litigated and will be decided by 
the Supreme Court this summer. 
While the current CFPB Director is 
working to increase the accountability 
and transparency at the agency, we 
don’t know what the next Director will 
do, if he or she will abuse his or her 
power. We should fix the CFPB before 
we expand their authorities. 
b 1530 
Madam Speaker, I also want to take 
issue with a larger set of issues here. 
The Democrats’ decision to report 
out a closed rule means that you can’t 
even have the ultimate goal of a bipar-
tisan bill that can then get action in 
the Senate and then, potentially, get a 
signature by the President. 
This, too, is a sad sign of the state of 
affairs in what seems to be a highly 
broken legislative process that we are 
in the midst of. It further dem-
onstrates my point that my colleagues, 
in particular, on the other side of the 
aisle have no interest in working with 
Republicans to craft a bill that pro-
tects consumers’ personal information. 
I submitted amendments to the Com-
mittee on Rules that provide for tar-
geted solutions: 
Eliminating this reliance on Social 
Security numbers; 
Removing 
paid 
non-elective 
debt 
from credit reports—which this bill 
fails to do; 
Allowing parents to electronically 
freeze their minor’s credit report— 
which this bill fails to do; 
Requiring sources for public record 
data in credit reports, which would 
then expand credit files so that those 
who are on the margins for credit-
worthiness would have enhanced credit 
potentially; 
Prohibit the inclusion of adverse in-
formation relating to predatory mort-
gage lending; 
Financial abuse or fraud associated 
with private student loans in credit re-
ports. This bill does not act; 
And directing the GAO to study and 
report to Congress on the use of non-
traditional data and credit scoring, 
this is something that has bipartisan 
support in our committee and has been 
reported out in other measures, but not 
in this one. 
And so those are sensible measures 
that could have been included if we had

an open amendment process. But then, 
again, we are wearing masks, we are 
conducting business in this odd way, 
where Members can vote for other 
Members that are not here on the 
House floor and we have to go through 
this whole long process. So I under-
stand they have a need to rush, right, 
but this is an ill-conceived bill that 
will have a negative impact on every 
American—every American—if this is 
signed into law. 
Madam Speaker, I think we need bet-
ter consideration and a better product 
that could actually achieve a bipar-
tisan outcome. 
Let’s vote ‘‘no’’ on this, and let’s get 
on with the real work of the American 
people. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER), author of this bill and a 
member of the Committee on Financial 
Services. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the chairwoman for allowing 
me to speak today on behalf of my bi-
partisan legislation, H.R. 5332, the Pro-
tecting Your Credit Score Act of 2020. 
Madam Speaker, since I took office, I 
have been committed to helping pro-
tect seniors and other vulnerable com-
munities from fraud and to protect 
their financial well-being. Like many 
of my colleagues, constituents in my 
district are feeling the economic pain 
caused by the ongoing pandemic. 
Just this week, in fact, a constituent 
of mine, Patricia from Wantage, New 
Jersey, reached out to me to ask: What 
can we do as policymakers to help pro-
tect people’s credit during this crisis? 
Madam Speaker, I am proud that we 
were able to provide Americans with 
debt and credit relief as part of the bi-
partisan CARES Act, protecting home-
owners in forbearance and Federal stu-
dent loan borrowers. We were able to 
continue to work to do so with the bi-
partisan HEROES Act, which has yet 
to become law. It is in the Senate now 
waiting action. And that act, including 
suspending negative credit reporting 
during the pandemic, giving Americans 
time to recover economically before 
there is a risk of being hit on their 
credit reports. It is also time that we 
look at the way hardworking Ameri-
cans are able to track and ensure accu-
racy in their credit reports so that 
their scores are where they need to be 
as we progress into our economic re-
covery. 
Madam Speaker, I really want to 
thank Chairwoman WATERS
for her 
impactful leadership and partnership 
on this bipartisan bill and her incred-
ibly supportive and smart team. I also 
thank Ranking Member MCHENRY for 
spending so many months working 
with me in such a constructive and co-
operative manner. My bill reflects a lot 
of his wise input. I, too, am sorry we 
weren’t able to find ultimate common 
ground. I also want to thank my good 
friend and co-chair of the Problem 
Solvers Caucus, TOM
REED, for his 
work cosponsoring this important leg-
islation. 
Madam Speaker, after working on 
this bill for a year, I was proud when 
the bill was reported favorably out of 
the Committee on Financial Services 
on December 11, 2019. 
I am also proud the House last night 
passed the landmark George Floyd Jus-
tice in Policing Act. We must continue 
to come together as a country to fight 
for racial justice on all fronts, and to 
combat inequalities that have plagued 
this Nation for too long, which in-
cludes the ability to access credit. 
Credit affects all communities, im-
pacting what Americans pay for a car, 
whether they can get a mortgage for a 
house, the rates on a credit card, and 
how much they can receive for a small 
business loan. The impact it has is es-
pecially strong on communities of 
color. And experts have testified to the 
Committee on Financial Services that 
the credit reporting system is biased, 
particularly 
against 
these 
commu-
nities. 
Running this crucial part of our 
economy are three companies in the 
United States that literally hold the 
keys to the kingdom. It is an oligopoly. 
They decide Americans’ credit fate and 
whether they should get access to cred-
it, and it is all done in a closed-off sys-
tem behind the drapes. And we don’t 
know what goes on, how they develop 
those scores. 
I am very glad the ranking member 
is interested in trying to get more 
competition into that process. And I 
am very eager—and I am sure the com-
mittee is, too—to work together on 
that front. 
I am also glad that there are areas 
that he would like to go further on 
overall when it comes to access to 
credit. And I am also eager to sit down 
as well. 
Madam Speaker, the bottom line is 
these three credit bureaus come up 
with their own magic number: Your 
credit score. Houdini, himself, could 
not figure out how these credit scores 
are calculated. They have their own se-
cret formula. It impacts every aspect 
of your life, as I said, from your car 
loan to your mortgage, and it is up to 
you to track it and beg them to fix in-
accuracies when they arise, which is 
far too often, and most often not your 
fault. 
The best way to discover whether 
there are errors on your credit report 
is to check your three reports from 
these companies, and FCRA currently 
only gives consumers the right to view 
their report for free once every 12 
months. 
Otherwise, you have got to pay out of 
your own pocket and chase down these 
three credit bureaus—anywhere from 
$9.95 a report to $15.95 a report. Experts 
recommend that you check your report 
before applying for any new line of 
credit or making a large purchase or 
renting or buying a home because a 
mistake can easily seriously affect 
your credit. It could lead to more costs 
and things like rising interest rates 
that would affect your loans, and even 
worse, you may be ineligible to qualify 
for financing altogether. 
The Federal Trade Commission has 
previously found that one in 5 con-
sumers have verified errors in their re-
ports, not of their own making. And 
one in 20 consumers have errors so seri-
ous that they would be denied credit or 
need to pay more for it. That adds up 
to 42 million Americans with errors in 
their credit and 10 million with errors 
that can be life-altering. 
We also now live in a world where 
data breaches are a constant threat. 
Unfortunately, every year 15.4 million 
Americans are victims of credit card 
fraud—42,000 people every single day. 
According to the Merchant Risk 
Council, 80 percent of all credit cards 
are compromised. And the Identity 
Theft Resources Center has reported 
that as of June 11, there have been 475 
reported data breaches already this 
year, exposing more than 5 million 
records. And once you are a victim, al-
most immediately the criminals, they 
start in. They apply for new cards, for 
mortgages, for loans, for cars—any-
thing else they can get their hands on, 
all under your name—affecting your 
credit score within these three credit 
bureaus. And it is vital that these 
fraudsters be caught immediately and 
not be allowed to cause further damage 
undetected between the one free annual 
report. 
It has happened to my sister, to my 
constituents, to people I know. And I 
am sure everyone out there knows 
someone this has happened to. And 
when someone is the target of this 
fraud right now, it is up to the victim 
to fix these issues. They receive all of 
the burden of chasing after these three 
companies with their own systems and 
procedures and beg them for help. And 
that can take 3 to 6 months. 
Madam Speaker, my bipartisan legis-
lation with Congressman TOM
REED 
from New York asked the private sec-
tor, not the government, to help fix 
this. And this is a big distinction here 
that I want to point out to the ranking 
member, this is driven by the private 
sector, not the government, to fix this 
issue. My bipartisan bill sets up a one- 
stop shop online portal to check your 
credit report for free at any time. It al-
lows victims to shut off the ability of 
credit crooks from using your informa-
tion to apply for credit under your 
name. 
The portal will also provide the abil-
ity to initiate and resolve disputes be-
tween you and the credit bureau, and 
you will be able to see who the bureaus 
have sold your data to in the prior 2 
years. Because, yes, they take your 
data and they go make money on your 
information. 
Madam Speaker, the bill strengthens 
cybersecurity safeguards of informa-
tion held by consumer reporting agen-
cies, to help prevent a repeat of the

2017 Equifax data breach. The bill also 
asks the GAO to examine the most se-
cure and accurate marker to track 
your credit, whether it is your Social 
Security number or another Federal 
identifier. And this is very important. 
I am glad the ranking member raised 
this issue, because I agree. We should 
find the best possible identifier that is 
most secure, and that is exactly what 
this study is all about because we need 
to make sure we keep your identity se-
cure. By creating this one-stop portal, 
all three credit bureaus will now have 
to work together to help protect you 
and make your lives better, not the 
other way around. 
And I understand the issue that is 
raised about the security and making 
sure that this is not handed off to 
someone. That is why, again, as I say, 
the private sector will develop these 
websites. 
And to a point about this that was 
raised: If my friend is actually really 
concerned, and he thinks that these 
three 
bureaus 
don’t 
have 
secure 
websites now, well then we better get 
them here immediately and find out 
why he is worried about that and if 
they actually should be more secure. 
Because what we are asking them to do 
is develop a website just like they have 
now, which I hope—and I will ask the 
companies again—I hope that they are 
doing everything possible to keep their 
own websites secure. 
Madam Speaker, well, my own sister 
had her credit hacked last year. She 
told me she was lucky to get a day off 
from her job to figure all this out. She 
had to sit on the phone and chase ev-
eryone. But what if you don’t have the 
ability to take a day off to sit on the 
phone with each credit company and 
chase down every single issue? Our bi-
partisan legislation will help fix this 
and help Americans protect what they 
spent a lifetime building, and that is 
their credit. 
Madam Speaker, I am also proud, 
lastly, to have the support of several 
businesses and consumer groups. Vince 
Malta, the President of the National 
Association of Realtors, sent a letter 
to me this week on the bill, which 
states: ‘‘Access to free credit scores, 
transparency in the reporting process 
and use of consumer credit information 
high standards for vetting credit infor-
mation, and a reliable method for con-
testing and correcting inaccurate in-
formation are critical to a vibrant 
housing market and economy.’’ 
Other supporting groups include the 
National Consumer Law Center, the 
Consumer Federation of America, Con-
sumer 
Action, 
and 
World 
Privacy 
Forum. 
Madam Speaker, while we did not 
earn the support of every group—and I 
recognize that—I am proud that even 
among those who disagree with us ac-
knowledged the efforts that we took in 
order to work towards a bipartisan 
agreement. I will continue to work to 
make every effort to reach consensus, 
and I appreciate their acknowledgment 
of that effort. 
Madam Speaker, finally, let me say 
that during an economic downturn and 
throughout the years we are going to 
spend recovering from it, Americans’ 
financial security will and must be 
paramount. 
We have already seen spikes in fraud 
throughout this pandemic, especially 
related to direct payments and dif-
ferent types of loans. And the chair-
woman has worked overtime in all of 
our bills to make sure we do every-
thing possible to protect Americans 
during this time. I am grateful for her 
leadership. 
Madam Speaker, as we recover from 
this crisis, I want to make sure Ameri-
cans can protect their credit and re-
solve disputes that may arise. As SEC 
Chairman CLAYton testified just yes-
terday to the House Committee on Fi-
nancial Services, for a consumer, the 
best thing you can do for yourself is 
understand your credit and get your 
credit under control. 
We need a modernized system that 
empowers all consumers, especially 
those facing new challenges with this 
new pandemic, with transparency and 
the ability to correct errors to their 
credit reports, and to make sure every-
one can have access to credit so that 
they can have a home, a car, and enjoy 
everything that everyone who works 
hard should have access to. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this commonsense 
bipartisan bill, which will help every 
American. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
highlight for the bill’s sponsor that 
first with the Equifax data breach, it is 
proof that the industry could use bet-
ter data standards. 
Second, making sure that they have 
the fullness of the Social Security 
numbers only means that when they 
steal that information, they also steal 
our full Social Security numbers so 
they can have full action for fraudulent 
activity and identity testimony. That, 
we know, and it should have been ad-
dressed in this bill, and it is a failure of 
this legislation and the reason why I 
oppose it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Georgia 
(Mr. 
LOUDERMILK), the ranking member on 
the Task Force on Artificial Intel-
ligence. 
Mr. LOUDERMILK. Madam Speaker, 
I thank our ranking member for not 
only yielding, but his fine leadership in 
this committee. 
I also appreciate my colleague, Mr. 
GOTTHEIMER, sponsor of this legisla-
tion. I appreciate his leadership on 
this, and I truly believe he did work 
very hard in a bipartisan manner to try 
to come to an agreement. And unfortu-
nately, we just weren’t able to close 
that gap. And I hope that going for-
ward we will be able to do that, be-
cause this is something that we do sup-
port on this side with the certain con-
straints to protect the consumers’ 
identity. 
One of my major concerns on this is 
cybersecurity. As was spoken about 
earlier, the bill would create an online 
portal for consumers to access their 
credit reports from all three major 
credit bureaus in one place. The idea is 
a good idea, and very worth discussing 
and very worth pursuing. But in its 
current state, it would be a massive 
amount of sensitive data in one place, 
so it must be done in a way that is 
cybersecure to make sure that the in-
formation doesn’t lead to more fraud 
and more identity theft. 
As someone who has spent many 
years in the IT sector, as I know my 
good colleague, Mr. GOTTHEIMER, has as 
well, I am very concerned about the po-
tential of breaches of this portal. 
We all remember the 2017 Equifax 
data breach that exposed the financial 
information of millions of Americans, 
and the last thing we should be doing is 
increasing the chance of that kind of 
event happening again. But this bill 
has the potential to do that very thing 
because it does not include robust cy-
bersecurity protections to make sure 
the information on the portal is secure. 
b 1545 
Another worthy goal of the bill is to 
make it easier for consumers to dispute 
errors in their credit reports. But the 
bill allows consumers to repeatedly 
dispute the same information on their 
credit reports, even if it is found to be 
accurate, which would lead to unneces-
sary and frivolous disputes. 
Another significant concern I have 
with this bill is that it would expand 
the authority of the Consumer Finan-
cial Protection Bureau. The CFPB is 
an unaccountable regulatory agency 
that took many rogue actions under 
the previous administration. 
My colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle know that expanding the 
CFPB’s power is a nonstarter for Re-
publicans; therefore, I cannot support 
this bill. I ask my colleagues to oppose 
this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
just one point I want to bring back up, 
if I may. I want to thank my friend for 
his comments, and I appreciate his 
work and our efforts together here. 
The one point about the Social Secu-
rity number that I want to raise is, the 
bill requires a study at the GAO to see 
what the best answer is, whether if 
that is a Federal identifier number or a 
Social Security number, whatever the 
best answer is. 
I know we spent a lot of time talking 
about this. I, too, am very concerned 
with making sure that we have the 
best possible outcome to protect people 
and protect their information. 
So if the GAO comes back and says 
that we need to develop a new Federal 
identifier so that we keep it separate 
from the Social Security number, then, 
to me, that would be the best outcome. 
That is exactly why the bill requires 
the GAO to study this. 
Again, just one other point, if we are 
concerned about current security and 
cybersecurity.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2565 
June 26, 2020 
Mr. MCHENRY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. I yield to the 
gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. MCHENRY. What I am high-
lighting is the fact that, in one section 
of the bill, you have the study to say 
whether or not using Social Security 
numbers is good or bad. I think that is 
good. That was laudable. 
The problem is, in another part of 
the bill, you mandate immediately 
that they need the fullness of the So-
cial Security numbers in order for the 
data to be included. That is what I am 
highlighting, and that is one of the 
rubs that I have with the bill. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Reclaiming my 
time. 
Yes, they also have a period of time 
to develop the site. It is not going to 
happen overall. In that period of time, 
we will get direction on what the best 
outcome is in terms of using a Federal 
identifier, and we will execute against 
that as we develop this site. 
Back to the site. If the oligopoly of 
the three bureaus—if right now our 
concern is that their sites are not se-
cure, then we better have them in im-
mediately and have them take us 
through their sites again. Because if 
you are still concerned about this— 
Mr. MCHENRY. Will the gentleman 
yield? 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. I yield to the 
gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. MCHENRY. I commend Chair-
woman WATERS for bringing the three 
CEOs in. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Right, right. I re-
member that. 
Mr. MCHENRY. We, on a bipartisan 
basis, beat them up, which is a rare 
thing in Congress. We beat them up be-
cause they had a massive data breach 
that exposed our data. That is why I 
sincerely wanted to get to the bottom 
of this and have a bipartisan bill. 
This is not a result of this product. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Reclaiming my 
time. 
Just one question on that. Do you 
feel now that the three are still inse-
cure? And are you concerned about 
them? 
Mr. MCHENRY. For sure, for sure. 
That is why I want to get to a solution. 
This bill, sadly, incorporates none of 
the conditionalities that I wanted. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Reclaiming my 
time. 
Does the gentleman agree that we 
should have them back in immediately, 
again, to talk to them and find out if 
they have made progress? 
Mr. MCHENRY. The point is, we 
could have had a massive vote on some-
thing that reformed them rather than 
bring them in and wag our finger 
again. 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. The whole point 
is that, because they are still insecure, 
we better let people actually have ac-
cess to their data all the time. That is 
what this bill does, so they can find 
out, instead of having to pay 10 bucks 
or 15 bucks every time to see if these 
sites are secure. That is my concern. 
I thank the gentleman. I think we 
are good. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 30 seconds. 
What I would say, very simply, 
Madam Speaker, is that we could have 
had a bipartisan solution here. That is 
what I was offering. Give up the pri-
vate right of action, so you don’t have 
more lawsuits, and give up your view of 
a government-centric portal that basi-
cally enshrines these big three. Those 
are two additions. 
The final kicker is this: End the reli-
ance on Social Security numbers and 
put the date in the future, and the 
technology solution will be there. That 
is an industry mandate that I offered 
as a matter of compromise. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from North Carolina 
(Mr. BUDD), my colleague from Davie 
County, North Carolina, a great leader 
on the Financial Services Committee. 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I want 
to rise in strong opposition to H.R. 
5332, the Protecting Your Credit Score 
Act of 2019. 
Although I will not be supporting the 
gentleman from New Jersey’s legisla-
tion, I want to make sure that people 
know that I consider him a friend, and 
I thank him for his efforts to try to 
bring reform to the credit reporting in-
dustry. 
There are some good ideas in this 
bill, such as the one-stop-shop ap-
proach for consumers to freeze and 
unfreeze their credit for all three na-
tionwide bureaus that we have just 
talked about, as well as access to cred-
it reports and scores. 
But even this idea is taken too far in 
the bill, and it leaves too many unan-
swered questions about exactly how it 
is going to be carried out. 
Now, it is really unfortunate that a 
bipartisan 
compromise 
was 
not 
reached. I know the ranking member 
and his staff worked tirelessly on this 
with the gentleman from New Jersey 
and his staff. 
But there are a few other points I 
want to make. You know, it is a chief 
priority for committee Republicans to 
protect consumers’ personal informa-
tion. That is something that both sides 
have brought up. 
Yet, we are preparing to vote on a 
bill that still makes Social Security 
numbers the primary way to identify a 
person, despite the fact that we know 
Social Security numbers threaten con-
sumers’ personal information. Worse 
yet, the bill will mandate furnishers to 
match all nine Social Security digits. 
Another concern with this bill is the 
creation of yet another ombudsman at 
the CFPB to deal exclusively with con-
sumer reporting agencies. This provi-
sion is unnecessary and duplicative. 
The CFPB already has an ombudsman 
to deal with consumer-facing issues. 
There is no logical reason why the pro-
posed authorities cannot simply be 
given to the existing ombudsperson. 
This is simply another move by the 
Democrats to expand the statutory au-
thority of the unaccountable CFPB. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. CASTEN), a member of the 
Financial Services Committee. 
Mr. CASTEN of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5332, 
the Protecting Your Credit Score Act. 
I support this bill because, like so 
many Americans, I personally know 
the frustration of dealing with erro-
neous marks on your credit report and 
thought I would share a recent story. 
About a month ago, I got a letter 
from a bank where I don’t have an ac-
count, Bank of America. They were 
thanking me for something that I 
didn’t recognize. So, I did what all good 
Americans do: I threw it in the recycle 
bin and moved on with my day. 
The next day, I got a similar letter 
from Navy Federal Credit Union, where 
I also do not have an account. This one 
had a summary of my credit score and 
was shortly followed with another note 
saying that my account was overdrawn 
by $3,250. 
I am going to be honest. The only 
reason that the Navy Federal Credit 
Union letters got my attention and 
didn’t end up in the recycling bin is be-
cause they were addressed to Lieuten-
ant Commander SEAN CASTEN. I have 
been called a lot of things in this job, 
but that is a rank that I have never 
earned. 
A few phone calls and a similar over-
draft notification from Bank of Amer-
ica later, and I had fraud alerts placed 
on both accounts. 
On the advice of the banks, I called 
TransUnion to ensure this wouldn’t 
show up on my credit report. The agent 
was helpful. At the end of the call, she 
said: ‘‘Is there anything else I should 
know?’’ 
And I just couldn’t resist telling her: 
‘‘Only that I am a member of the House 
Financial Services Committee with 
oversight of you, and I appreciate how 
helpful you have been.’’ 
Now, I tell that story because I was 
able to correct this. But I can imagine 
a ton of other scenarios where I don’t 
check the recycling, where I am not al-
leged to be a commissioned naval offi-
cer, where I hadn’t been in enough 
committee hearings on this subject to 
recognize fraud early on. And in all 
those scenarios, this story has a much 
less happy ending. 
But those incidents happen every day 
to an awful lot of Americans. We know 
21 percent of consumers had verified er-
rors in their credit reports. Thirteen 
percent had errors that affected their 
credit scores. Five percent had errors 
serious enough to cause them to be de-
nied or pay more for credit. But those 
are only the accounts we know about. 
Many don’t know where to turn or 
have the resources or the time to cor-
rect them. Fraudulent or accidental 
marks on a credit report can have a 
life-altering consequence, so it is im-
portant that those reports are correct. 
But credit scores and reports are a 
critical gatekeeper for Americans’ fi-
nancial well-being and access to the

most basic building block of the Amer-
ican Dream. 
It is determinative in setting pre-
miums for auto and homeowner’s in-
surance. It informs landlords on which 
renters they want to rent their apart-
ments to. Your score determines if you 
must make a bigger deposit to get your 
utilities. 
That is why this bill is so important. 
It creates an online consumer portal 
where consumers will have free and un-
limited access to their consumer re-
ports and credit scores. 
Allowing consumers the ability to 
initiate disputes about credit report 
accuracy—rather than all the rig-
marole I had to go through—and to 
place or remove a security freeze, is a 
critical tool that allows Americans the 
control and the ability to remedy those 
errors. 
It is 2020. It is long past time to mod-
ernize the way that consumers address 
errors on their credit scores. 
I thank Representative GOTTHEIMER 
for introducing this bill, and I urge my 
colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Virginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN). 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 5332, 
the Protecting Your Credit Score Act. 
I would like to thank the ranking 
member for his leadership, but also my 
colleague from New Jersey. Not only is 
he a friend, but I respect him very 
much, and I do applaud his efforts on 
this legislation. 
I share his interest in ensuring credit 
reports are complete, accurate, and 
transparent, but I believe this bill fails 
to achieve that goal. 
The passage of H.R. 5332 will have 
harmful and unintended consequences 
for consumers. It is, simply put, yet 
another veiled attempt to socialize the 
credit reporting and scoring industry 
that will cause harm to hardworking 
Americans. 
This bill is disguised as pro-con-
sumer, but H.R. 5332 will decrease com-
petition, increase the cost of credit for 
consumers, provide opportunities for 
trial attorneys to exploit the litigation 
system, and expand the authority of 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau. 
It undermines the Fair Credit Re-
porting Act and our ability to main-
tain a nationwide credit reporting sys-
tem that benefits businesses and con-
sumers. This bill would create a con-
flicting patchwork of interpretations of 
the Fair Credit Reporting Act that will 
lead to confusion among financial in-
stitutions and raise costs for all con-
sumers. 
While my colleague named this bill 
the Protecting Your Credit Score Act 
of 2019, it does little to protect con-
sumers and their data. Quite to the 
contrary, it expands and increases the 
risk of harm to consumers affected by 
a data breach. 
This bill mandates the three nation-
wide credit reporting agencies create a 
shared online portal and would create 
significant cybersecurity vulnerabili-
ties for consumers and companies, all 
while creating opportunities for bad ac-
tors to manipulate and take advantage 
of our consumer data. 
I know a little bit about this because 
I have done this for about 22 years. 
Creating a one-stop-shop for the cred-
it report, personal information, and So-
cial Security number of every indi-
vidual would be disastrous in the event 
of a cyber hack or data breach. 
We need to find targeted solutions 
that focus on increasing the cybersecu-
rity capability at credit reporting 
agencies, increase competition, and in-
crease access to credit for consumers 
and businesses, rather than put forward 
proposals that undermine the con-
sumer reporting system and further 
empower unelected bureaucrats at the 
expense of the free market. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time I have 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman has 121⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank Mr. RIGGLEMAN for his points. 
He is a good friend, and I respect him 
deeply. 
I disagree here, respectfully. The 
whole point of this is to protect con-
sumers. Giving consumers more data to 
have access to about themselves and to 
understand their own credit scores and 
their own credit history and have more 
transparency into their own lives does 
not hurt them; it helps them. 
That is exactly what we are doing 
today, so that if you are hacked, if you 
are one of the millions of Americans 
whose credit is stolen every single day 
and you are trying to put your credit 
life back together, not by your own 
making, because someone did it to you, 
and they are opening accounts and 
doing things to you, what this legisla-
tion will do is help you. 
Instead of having to spend hours 
chasing down the three bureaus and 
hoping that they actually do what they 
say they are going to do and put your 
credit back together, so that when you 
want a house and a mortgage, or you 
want a car, and you want to do the 
things that you have worked very hard 
to build your credit for, someone else 
who stole your credit won’t be able to 
undermine that. That is what this bill 
does. 
One point, just to clarify this impor-
tant point that the ranking member 
made. The bill does not mandate the 
collection of Social Security numbers. 
It simply requires that credit bureaus 
match the information they already 
have on file to ensure that Jane Doe in 
Illinois who defaults on her payments 
does not impair the credit of Jane Doe 
in Indiana. 
One of the biggest reasons consumers 
have errors in their files is because of 
the mixed files when negative informa-
tion is assigned to the wrong person. 
It is, once again, another reason why 
we need a place for consumers to go to 
get free access to their reports, to file 
complaints immediately, to contest 
issues when they see them, and to 
make sure their credit isn’t sold off to 
someone else right underneath them. 
That is the point of this. And why we 
are having a GAO study is to make 
sure we find the best way, the most se-
cure way, to do this going forward. 
This legislation protects consumers; 
it protects Americans; and it doesn’t 
look out for the oligopoly. We need 
more competition there. It looks out 
for the American consumer, and that is 
the point. 
b 1600 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
think that since this is such a critical 
issue, we should count up how many 
hearings we had in the Financial Serv-
ices Committee. We had one in Feb-
ruary of 2019. 
We could have gotten to the bottom 
of these things if we actually had mul-
tiple hearings to figure this stuff out. 
Instead, we got a parsing bill on the 
floor that doesn’t achieve the things 
that we needed to achieve. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. 
STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my colleague from North Carolina for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition 
to the act. 
Like many of my colleagues, I am 
committed to ensuring that all con-
sumers can have faith in the validity of 
their credit score. Unfortunately, the 
bill fails to achieve that goal. It puts 
consumers at greater risk of having 
their information stolen. 
It threatens to increase the cost of 
credit by creating more opportunities 
for trial lawyers and by making scores 
less protected. 
Further, it expands the jurisdiction 
of the Consumer Financial Protection 
Bureau, which is completely unac-
countable to Congress. 
Credit scores are an essential part of 
our financial system. Both Republicans 
and Democrats, I believe, agree on that 
point. We also agree that many Ameri-
cans have difficulty accessing their 
credit due to their poor or insufficient 
credit histories. 
With that in mind, we should work 
together to enhance cybersecurity at 
credit reporting agencies, reduce fraud, 
and help consumers get the relief they 
need in times of crisis. 
Our ranking member has been a lead-
er on this issue, introducing amend-
ments and standalone legislation to 
move the ball forward. Unfortunately, 
his ideas and the ideas of those on our 
side of the aisle and other constructive 
suggestions have not been included in 
this bill, making it a flawed bill. I urge 
my colleagues to oppose the legisla-
tion. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I

colleague has any remaining speakers 
on his side. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
do. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), the ranking 
member of the Investor Protection, En-
trepreneurship, and Capital Markets 
Subcommittee. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 5332, 
and it is not because I don’t believe 
that there isn’t a motive behind this 
that isn’t intended to help consumers. 
I just don’t think it is going to hit the 
target. 
This bill requires the three largest 
nationwide credit reporting agencies to 
create a single shared online portal to 
allow consumers one-stop access to 
consumer reports, credit scores, and 
credit freezes, as well as to initiate dis-
putes. This portal would contain infor-
mation on consumer rights and direc-
tions on how to dispute a credit report. 
The bill requires credit reporting 
agencies to match all nine digits of a 
consumer’s Social Security number 
with the information included in a con-
sumer file. 
In addition, the bill codifies the 
CFPB’s supervision of credit reporting 
agencies and expands their authority 
to 
establish 
‘‘administrative, 
tech-
nical, and physical safeguards,’’ cur-
rently under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley 
Act, to all credit reporting agencies. 
The bill provides injunctive relief to 
allow a court to compel a credit report-
ing agency to fix an error or remove in-
accurate information from a consumer 
report. 
Furthermore, the bill creates an ad-
ditional 
ombudsman 
at 
the 
CFPB 
tasked with resolving persistent errors 
on reports that are not addressed in a 
timely fashion and allows the ombuds-
man to make referrals to the Office of 
Supervision and Enforcement for cor-
rective action. 
We are all supportive of increased ac-
cess and availability on credit reports, 
scores, and file freezes, but this legisla-
tion is just overly broad and proscrip-
tive. 
I, too, like one of my other col-
leagues who just talked about having 
mysterious things show up in the mail, 
have been a victim of that. I have also 
had my credit card numbers stolen in 
the past. We have had to be online and 
try to deal with these things. 
The goal to make sure that we are all 
protected as much as possible is a lofty 
goal. The problem here, though, is that 
this is going to potentially decrease 
competition, 
which 
then 
actually 
disincentivizes that access; increasing 
fraud risk, which I am very concerned 
about; propping up the trial bar, which 
I know is a common theme here in 
Washington, D.C., at least out of one 
party; and expanding the authority of 
the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau. 
So, let’s talk a little bit about the 
PII, that personally identifiable infor-
mation. When you are matching all 
nine digits of consumers’ Social Secu-
rity numbers, it doesn’t provide any al-
ternate methods for verification. We 
have had problems with this in the 
past, and I, for one, and many Repub-
licans have consistently—in fact, a 
number of my Democrat friends—have 
consistently expressed concerns regard-
ing the private sector and govern-
ment’s overreliance on the use of these 
Social Security numbers for identity 
verification, 
which 
threatens 
con-
sumers’ personal information. 
I oppose the Securities and Exchange 
Commission and other Federal agen-
cies’ use of PII in their databases be-
cause there have been breaches. I am 
reminded of the old adage: Why would 
you rob a bank? Because that is where 
the money is. Why would you go after 
a database? Because that is where the 
digital gold is. 
What we are doing is, we are putting 
more digital gold into a new database. 
So we are increasing that vulnerabil-
ity. We need to be working to promote 
more competition in the credit report-
ing and scoring industry, not less. I 
think that is what this bill, unfortu-
nately, is doing. 
Instead, we should be debating more 
targeted solutions, such as H.R. 3821, 
which would bolster cybersecurity ca-
pacity at credit reporting agencies, en-
courage an alternative to use of Social 
Security 
numbers, 
protect 
minors 
against fraud, and help consumers who 
may be facing medical debt as a result 
of the global pandemic. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject this bill. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the right to close, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume to close. 
Madam Speaker, as I said in my 
opening, this is yet another attempt by 
House Democrats to socialize the cred-
it reporting and scoring industry. 
We had an opportunity for a bipar-
tisan bill, and this is not the work of 
that product. This bill will decrease 
competition in the industry, increase 
fraud risk related to consumers’ per-
sonal data, prop up the trial bar, and 
expand the authority of the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau. 
If Congress really wants to protect 
consumers, we should be working to-
gether promote more competition in 
the credit reporting and scoring indus-
try. We should be promoting new ways 
to eliminate the barriers to entry, not 
promoting what really comes down to 
less consumer choice. 
We marked up this bill in the Finan-
cial Services Committee back in De-
cember. 
The 
committee 
Democrats 
noted in their report on the bill: ‘‘It 
has been more than 15 years since Con-
gress enacted comprehensive reform of 
the consumer credit reporting system, 
and there have been numerous short-
comings with the current system iden-
tified during that time that need to be 
addressed.’’ 
Yet, since the Democrats took over 
in 2019, the House Financial Services 
Committee has held one hearing on 
credit reporting. We had a bipartisan 
consensus on the things that needed to 
be done and the challenges therein. 
This hearing featured a public grilling 
of the CEOs of the three nationwide bu-
reaus. The hearing discussed structural 
problems within the industry, yet this 
bill just solidifies that structure. 
The number one complaint in the 
CFPB consumer complaint database is 
about consumer issues with credit re-
porting. 
Why are we reinforcing the current 
structure of this industry by legis-
lating that? We should promote more 
competition in the system, not perpet-
uate an obviously broken one. 
The Democrats took issue with the 
market failure in credit reporting, an 
issue we agree on. However, their legis-
lative response does not do the things 
necessary to increase competition and 
consumer choice and protect our data. 
The fact that Democrat leadership 
decided this bill was perfect and needed 
no 
amendments 
demonstrates 
my 
point. My colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle have no interest in working 
with Republicans to craft a bill that 
will really protect consumers’ personal 
information. This bill is about catering 
to their stakeholders. 
Madam Speaker, I will reiterate, like 
I have with so many bills that have 
passed the House: This bill has no 
chance of being passed by the Senate or 
signed into law. 
Preserving access to and making 
available low-cost credit options to 
consumers should be Congress’ pri-
ority. We should be working toward bi-
partisan 
solutions, 
and 
we 
should 
prioritize those things. We should be 
working toward those solutions, and 
that is why I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD letters in opposition to this 
bill by the Consumer Data Industry As-
sociation, the Credit Union National 
Association, the U.S. Chamber of Com-
merce, the American Bankers Associa-
tion, the National Taxpayers Union, 
and the Consumer Bankers Associa-
tion.

this opportunity to express our opposition to 
the bill. 
We believe that this bill will have negative 
impacts on the American consumer. Over the 
last decade Congress has prioritized the 
‘‘ability to repay’’ as the most important 
part of underwriting a financial product, to 
fight predatory lending and ensure that con-
sumers are not able to borrow more than 
they can afford. This bill will make it harder

for lenders to determine whether a consumer 
has an ability to repay, increase loan losses 
and ultimately result in higher prices, espe-
cially for those who previously received the 
best prices on loan products after a lifetime 
of on-time payments. 
The bill: could make the cost of borrowing 
more expensive and limit access to credit; 
could introduce new threats to consumers’ 
information and physical security; and intro-
duces unnecessary and expensive burdens 
into the credit reporting system, making it 
harder for consumers disputes to be proc-
essed in a timely fashion. 
The bill could make the cost of borrowing 
more expensive and limit access to credit. 
Section 4 of the bill could lead to higher 
costs of credit for the overall market, and 
specifically for consumers who pay their 
bills on time every month. This section of 
the bill would allow consumers who have not 
paid their bills on time to continue disputing 
information, even if the account is verified 
as accurate. This would increase the likeli-
hood that that accurate, though negative in-
formation, will be excluded from credit 
scores, thereby impeding lenders from mak-
ing adequate risk decisions. 
This bill could introduce new threats to 
consumers’ information and physical secu-
rity. 
Section 6 would require CRAs to effec-
tively mail a credit report to a consumer 
every time an adverse action occurs in a 
credit transaction. If, for example, a con-
sumer applies for a mortgage and receives a 
rate higher than the lowest possible rate due 
to the consumer’s higher credit utilization 
rate, then each credit bureau would have to 
physically mail a report to the consumer, 
whether the consumer requested it or not. 
And if the consumer applied to several mort-
gage companies, the CRAs would have to 
mail the report to the consumer’s last 
known address each time. This would create 
data security issues, as thousands of credit 
reports would be sent, by mail, to people who 
didn’t ask for them, don’t want them, or 
don’t need them. Also, tens of millions of 
consumers move each year, increasing the 
likelihood that credit reports would fall into 
the hands of persons other than the intended 
consumer. Consumers today can receive free 
credit reports as often as every week and 
have additional opportunities to get their 
credit report under certain circumstances. 
CRAs should not be mailing millions of cred-
it reports with very sensitive information to 
people who did not ask for them. 
Section 2 of the bill could also harm con-
sumers’ personal physical security. This sec-
tion includes language giving consumers new 
rights to opt out of sales of non-credit report 
information. The identity information that 
also appears in a credit report is critical for 
companies that need to confirm identity, al-
ternate names, and previous addresses, such 
as criminal-background screeners. The effect 
of this provision would be to allow someone 
to hide their relevant criminal history from 
employers, volunteer agencies or other users 
of criminal history reports. For example, 
someone convicted of elder or child abuse 
could simply move to a new jurisdiction, opt 
out of non-credit report sales and apply for 
jobs with nursing homes or child-care cen-
ters. Today, when someone like this applies 
for a job and discloses neither their old ad-
dress nor the criminal conviction, the back-
ground screener would purchase an address 
history from a credit bureau to identify ju-
risdictions in which to search for records. 
While this method is not fool proof, it is the 
industry standard and results in detection 
rates comparable to fingerprinting by the 
FBI. Without it, employers, volunteer agen-
cies, youth sports leagues and other legiti-
mate users of background screening would be 
at the mercy of any convicted criminal who 
is willing to lie on an application. 
The bill introduces unnecessary and expen-
sive burdens into the credit reporting sys-
tem, making it harder for consumers dis-
putes to be processed in a timely fashion. 
The addition of a new ‘‘consumer portal,’’ 
also in Section 2, would create an unneces-
sary new government-mandated website for 
consumers when existing options for con-
sumers already exist. Consumers currently 
can visit any of the websites of the nation-
wide CRAs and file a dispute, set a security 
freeze and exercise other rights that are 
guaranteed by the Fair Credit Reporting 
Act. This provision is unnecessary and could 
create additional data security issues. 
Consumers who pay their bills on time 
would also be the ones most impacted by the 
bill’s requirement for full nine-digit Social 
Security Number (SSN) matching. The FTC 
studied this matching topic in an exhaustive 
report directed by the 2003 FACT A Act, and 
found that matching nine digits of the SSN 
is not a viable solution, as it would not re-
sult in greater accuracy of credit reports, 
but it would lead to fewer consumers being 
approved for credit. By denying CRAs the 
ability to anticipate and fix transcription er-
rors, consumers could end up having mul-
tiple fragmentary credit reports, each one 
tied to a given SSN. Then, when applying for 
new credit, a lender will not be able to see 
the full picture of the individual, meaning 
that the consumer who has paid their bills 
on time every month won’t receive the ben-
efit accrued during their many years of hard 
work. And some consumers will find strang-
ers’ files associated with their SSN, compli-
cating the lending process. The Consumer Fi-
nancial Protection Bureau supervises and ex-
amines the nationwide CRAs and has not 
raised this issue as a concern; this section of 
the bill will harm, not help, consumers. 
We would also note that Section 5 of the 
bill includes injunctive relief that exposes 
users of credit reports to private enforce-
ment for consumer notices and red flags. 
This would be a significant change in prac-
tice that would expose lenders to new liabil-
ities from the trial bar. 
This bill was the subject of a great deal of 
negotiation and discussion with Representa-
tive Gottheimer, the bill sponsor, before the 
Financial Services Committee passed the 
bill. We appreciate his spirit of cooperation, 
but unfortunately the bill before the House 
falls short of its goals to strengthen the con-
sumer credit market and protect consumer 
credit scores.

DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of America’s credit unions, I 
am writing regarding H.R. 5332, the Pro-
tecting Your Credit Score Act of 2019. The 
Credit Union National Association (CUNA) 
represents America’s credit unions and their 
115 million members. 
Accurate and complete credit reports are 
essential to credit unions providing safe and 
affordable financial services to their mem-
bers. Whereas credit unions’ field of member-
ship restrictions were originally designed as 
a mechanism for determining borrowers’ 
credit worthiness, today credit unions and 
other financial institutions rely on credit re-
ports and credit scores to assess credit wor-
thiness and inform lending decisions. It is in 
the interest of all stakeholders in the lend-
ing process for borrowers’ credit reports to 
be accurate and complete. 
H.R. 5332 would require credit reporting 
agencies to create an online portal for con-
sumers to access free credit reports and cred-
it scores, and dispute errors. It would also di-
rect the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau (CFPB) to impose and enforce data se-
curity safeguards for the credit reporting 
agencies. 
While the legislation may be well-inten-
tioned, we oppose H.R. 5332 because the ex-
pansion of private rights of action and allow-
ing courts to award injunctive relief could 
increase the frequency of meritless lawsuits 
under the Federal Credit Reporting Act 
(FCRA). When entities are subject to frivo-
lous litigation, resources are distracted from 
providing services, increasing the cost of 
service to all consumers. In the case of credit 
unions, frivolous litigation means that ac-
cess to safe and affordable financial services 
becomes more expensive and potentially less 
available for credit union members. 
We also have concerns that the online por-
tal mandated under this legislation would 
pose significant cybersecurity risks for con-
sumers, financial institutions, and compa-
nies. The portal created would have no direct 
owner and require its own authentication 
and security, leading to the possibility of 
consumers either being rejected from the 
portal or a nefarious actor abusing the sys-
tem. 
Finally, we question the need for this leg-
islation. Under the FCRA, consumers can 
dispute the accurateness of information on 
their credit reports. They can either raise 
the dispute directly with the credit reporting 
agency or with their creditor. The FCRA re-
quires these disputes to be resolved in a 
timely manner and, if the disputed informa-
tion is incorrect, the information in question 
is eliminated from the report. As such, con-
sumers already have significant tools to dis-
pute information and correct errors in their 
credit reports. 
On behalf of America’s credit unions, 
thank you for the opportunity to share our 
views. 
Sincerely, 
JIM NUSSLE, 
President & CEO. 
CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OF THE 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, 
Washington, DC, June 23, 2020. 
TO
THE MEMBERS
OF
THE U.S. HOUSE
OF 
REPRESENTATIVES: The U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce opposes H.R. 5332, the ‘‘Protecting 
Your Credit Score Act of 2019.’’ 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) re-
quires 
each 
consumer 
reporting 
agency 
(CRA) to achieve maximum possible accu-
racy in compiling a consumer report. Every 
CRA also has a legal obligation to safeguard 
the personal information that they hold. 
This legislation would require companies 
to jointly establish an online consumer por-
tal with its own authentication and security, 
without a specific owner. This portal would 
create 
significant 
cybersecurity 
vulnerabilities for consumers and compa-
nies—making it impossible for CRAs to meet 
existing obligations. Further, the authen-
tication of the portal could potentially ex-
pose credit reports to abusive credit repair. 
If the authentication is tuned too high, then 
real consumers would be rejected from the 
website. If authentication is too loose, then 
it could be abused. 
The Chamber supports efforts to stream-
line access to credit data for consumers; 
however, it must be done in a responsible 
way that does not prevent access to credit. 
While we appreciate the extensive efforts of

AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, June 23, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
Minority Leader, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND MINORITY LEAD-
ER MCCARTHY: The American Bankers Asso-
ciation writes to express our opposition to 
H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit Score 
Act of 2020, scheduled for consideration be-
fore the House this week. 
We share the sponsor’s interest in ensuring 
that credit reports are complete and accu-
rate and that consumers have appropriate 
protections, including rights to challenge 
and have corrected any inaccuracies in their 
reports. Though the legislation is well-in-
tended, we believe it will make credit re-
ports less predictive and useful by promoting 
the elimination of negative but accurate in-
formation that will weaken the underwriting 
process and thus increase borrowers’ costs 
and reduce people’s ability to get loans. In 
addition, allowing courts to award injunctive 
relief will promote questionable lawsuits and 
replace the current single-interpretation re-
gime with inconsistent interpretations that 
vary across the country. 
The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) cur-
rently provides consumers strong dispute 
rights to challenge the accuracy of informa-
tion in their reports—rights that are en-
forced 
through 
supervision, 
government 
agency enforcement actions, and civil law-
suits. Consumers may submit claims to ei-
ther the consumer reporting agency or di-
rectly to the furnisher of the information. 
Disputes must be investigated and resolved 
promptly. If not, the information is deleted. 
Thus, consumers have ample legal means to 
challenge the accuracy of information in 
their credit reports. 
We are concerned about the abuse of these 
protective provisions to remove accurate but 
negative information, not only by credit re-
pair organizations and those hoping to erase 
accurate negative information from their re-
port to improve their ability to obtain cred-
it, but also by individuals, including those 
involved in organized crime, seeking to de-
fraud lenders. 
H.R. 5332 will make it even easier than it is 
today for individuals to flood consumer re-
porting agencies and furnishers of informa-
tion with false claims of inaccuracies that 
must be resolved in a timely fashion or de-
leted. The resulting degradation of the re-
ports will reduce the ability of lenders to 
evaluate an applicant’s creditworthiness and 
ability to repay, which in turn will increase 
what consumers pay for credit and make it 
harder for many consumers, especially the 
underserved, to get credit. Moreover, re-
sources and money spent to manage the in-
creased volume of false claims are better 
spent resolving legitimate disputes. 
The bill will further undermine the con-
sumer reporting system by expanding pri-
vate rights of action against users of credit 
reports and by creating uncertainty about 
how banks and others must comply with the 
FCRA. Allowing courts to award injunctive 
relief means that multiple courts can inter-
pret this complicated statute differently 
from the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-
reau, the primary agency tasked with inter-
preting and enforcing FCRA. The result will 
be a patchwork of inconsistent interpreta-
tions, uncertainty about how to comply, and 
lawsuits of questionable merit. 
While 
we 
appreciate 
Representative 
Gottheimer’s efforts and welcome discussion 
on these issues, we must oppose H.R. 5332 as 
currently crafted. 
Sincerely, 
JAMES C. BALLENTINE. 
NATIONAL TAXPAYERS UNION, 
Washington. DC, June 26, 2020. 
The National Taxpayers Union urges Rep-
resentatives to vote ‘‘NO’’ on H.R. 5332, the 
‘‘Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2020.’’ 
Though well-intentioned, this legislation 
would cede more power to the unaccountable 
Consumer 
Financial 
Protection 
Bureau, 
jeopardize consumer information, and poten-
tially weaken lending underwriting stand-
ards. 
Accurate and complete credit reports are 
the foundation of this country’s robust and 
competitive consumer credit market. Most, 
if not all, lenders rely upon credit history 
data found in credit reports to identify and 
evaluate potential risks a consumer may 
pose before entering into a financial rela-
tionship with that consumer. That informa-
tion is critical for lenders to evaluate the ap-
plicant’s ability to repay, interest rates, and 
other loan terms. Since many home loan bor-
rowers will have their mortgage guaranteed 
by the federal government, lawmakers must 
be cautious in their reforms to the Fair 
Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) to avoid adding 
undue credit risk onto the government-spon-
sored enterprises’ balance sheets. 
Perhaps the most problematic provision of 
H.R. 5332 is the requirement for the three 
major credit bureaus, which are entirely pri-
vate businesses, to jointly create an online 
consumer portal for consumers to access 
their credit reports and scores, dispute er-
rors, and place or lift security freezes. While 
a one-stop shop may seem to offer consumer 
benefits, having one location containing 
every credit report, personal information, 
and social security number of every indi-
vidual could have disastrous consequences in 
the event of a cyber hack or data breach. 
Secondly, this legislation provides no legal 
protection to these entities in the event of a 
large scale cyber breach, leaving these busi-
nesses vulnerable to big class-action law-
suits. H.R. 5332 also changes how consumers 
dispute adverse information found in their 
credit reports, allowing individuals to flood 
reporting agencies and lenders with false 
claims of inaccuracies that must be resolved 
in a timely manner. Ultimately, this pro-
posal shifts the burden on dispute resolution 
from the individual onto the credit bureaus. 
Additionally, this bill establishes a second, 
duplicative ombudsman at the CFPB who 
will have sole control over credit reporting. 
The ombudsperson would have to help re-
solve persistent errors in credit reports that 
aren’t addressed in a timely manner, and 
make referrals for supervisory or enforce-
ment actions against credit reporting com-
panies. This situation sets up a new oppor-
tunity for the CFPB to specifically target 
certain companies that may become ‘‘unsa-
vory’’ and be subject to political targeting. 
NTU also questions the need for such legis-
lation, as the FCRA currently provides con-
sumers ample opportunity to dispute inac-
curate information on their credit reports. 
The FCRA already requires these disputes to 
be resolved in a timely manner and, if the 
disputed information is incorrect, the infor-
mation in question is eliminated from a re-
port. In essence, this legislation does not 
bring any new meaningful benefits to the 
credit reporting process. 
Roll call votes on H.R. 5332 will be included 
in NTU’s annual Rating of Congress and a 
‘‘NO’’ vote will be considered the pro-tax-
payer position. If you have any questions, 
please contact NTU Policy and Government 
Affairs Manager, Thomas Aiello. 
CONSUMER BANKERS ASSOCIATION, 
Washington, DC, June 25, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
Washington, DC. 
Hon. KEVIN MCCARTHY, 
House Minority Leader, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI AND LEADER MCCAR-
THY: On behalf of the Consumer Bankers As-
sociation (CBA), I am writing to share our 
views on H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Cred-
it Score Act of 2019. CBA is the voice of the 
retail banking industry whose products and 
services provide access to credit for con-
sumers and small businesses. Our members 
operate in all 50 states, serve more than 150 
million Americans, and collectively hold 
two-thirds of the country’s total depository 
assets. 
CBA opposes the Protecting Your Credit 
Score Act of 2019. Section 5 of the bill, ‘‘In-
junctive Relief for Victims,’’ is especially 
concerning because it undermines the CFPB 
and Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) pri-
mary authority to enforce the Fair Credit 
Reporting Act (FCRA) in a manner con-
sistent with maintaining a nationwide credit 
reporting system that benefits businesses 
and consumers. Congress enacted FCRA in 
1970 with emphasis on ensuring fairness, ac-
curacy, and efficiency within the banking 
system, and in doing so specifically pro-
tected federal regulators’ sole authority to 
pursue injunctive relief for violations, to 
avoid any possibility of multiple courts 
issuing conflicting orders. Undoing this de-
liberate design is unnecessary given the seri-
ous fines and other existing penalties al-
ready in place under the FCRA and court dis-
rupt credit markets without any positive im-
pact on consumer credit reports. As deposi-
tory institutions supervised by prudential 
federal regulators with deep expertise and 
experience in financial markets, CBA mem-
bers are concerned with the potential for un-
limited injunctive authority to impair na-
tionwide financial systems. 
CBA is also troubled by Section 4, ‘‘Im-
proved Dispute Process for Consumer Re-
porting Agencies.’’ The CFPB already has 
authority to enforce fines for FCRA viola-
tions, and this proposal would complicate ex-
isting cost effective and efficient processes 
furnishers are mandated to use under federal 
law to distinguish false or illegitimate dis-
putes from actual consumer problems that 
should draw focus and proper inquiry. Safety 
and soundness considerations require the 
highest standards for complete and accurate 
consumer information in the underwriting 
process. Modifying or deleting disagreeable, 
but accurate consumer information from any 
report without proper input from furnishers 
will interfere with prudent risk assessments 
and raise costs for all consumers. 
Furthermore, the ‘‘Bureau Credit Report-
ing Ombudsman’’ as written under this sec-
tion has seemingly unrestrained individual 
authority that could make determinations 
on a consumer’s credit profile without the 
due process or appeal mechanisms generally 
required under the Administrative Procedure 
Act (APA). This unilateral decision-making 
authority would have a serious and negative 
impact on a bank’s ability to determine risk 
and extend affordable credit. 
Thank you for your consideration of our 
views. CBA remains eager to assist your ef-
forts at improving outcomes for all bor-
rowers. 
Sincerely, 
RICHARD HUNT, 
President and CEO. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this bill, and I 
yield back the balance of my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2570 
June 26, 2020 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, it has been nearly 17 
years since major reform legislation to 
address common problems with credit 
reporting has been enacted into law. To 
that end, I am pleased that, earlier this 
year, the House passed H.R. 3621, the 
Comprehensive Credit Reporting En-
hancement, 
Disclosure, 
Innovation, 
and Transparency Act. 
Representative GOTTHEIMER’s bipar-
tisan bill complements those efforts to 
ensure we have a well-functioning cred-
it reporting system that is streamlined 
and easy to use and that better pro-
tects the data of all consumers. 
Republicans were in charge when 
Equifax exposed sensitive data of 150 
million Americans. What was their re-
sponse? Nothing. 
Earlier this year, the House passed 
the Comprehensive CREDIT Act to 
overhaul our broken credit reporting 
system and enhance cybersecurity of 
the credit reporting bureaus. Repub-
licans voted no. 
Representative GOTTHEIMER
offered 
this bill that would strengthen cyber-
security of Equifax and other credit bu-
reaus, and now Republicans are saying 
no. 
We have some Republicans who op-
pose giving the CFPB expanded author-
ity, although I would note Ranking 
Member MCHENRY introduced H.R. 3821 
that would do just that, giving the 
CFPB authority of cybersecurity for 
the credit bureaus. The bill before us 
would do the same. 
I would urge Republicans to recon-
sider their opposition to the bill. I urge 
an ‘‘aye’’ vote on this commonsense 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD support for this bill from the 
Americans for Financial Reform, the 
National Consumer Law Center, Con-
sumer Action, Consumer Federation of 
America, Consumer Reports, National 
Association of Consumer Advocates, 
World Privacy Forum, and also the Na-
tional Association of Realtors. 
JUNE 23, 2020. 
DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
WATERS: The under-
signed consumer organizations write to sup-
port H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit 
Score Act of 2019 (Gottheimer). This bill will 
address serious problems in the credit re-
porting system and empower consumers by 
providing them with much greater access to 
and control over their own information. 
Credit reports and credit scores play a 
huge role in determining a consumer’s finan-
cial health. Not only do they determine a 
consumer’s ability to obtain credit at a fair 
price, but they are used by many other sec-
tors—insurance companies, landlords and 
even employers. Despite their importance, 
credit reports are also full of errors, which 
can cost a consumer thousands of dollars in 
higher-priced credit, or worse yet, result in 
the denial of a job, insurance coverage, an 
apartment rental, or the ability to open a 
small business or buy a house. The Federal 
Trade Commission’s definitive study showed 
that 21% of consumers had verified errors in 
their credit reports, 13% had errors that af-
fected their credit scores, and 5% had errors 
serious enough to cause them to be denied or 
pay more for credit. 
Trying to fix these errors can be a Kafka- 
esque nightmare in which the Big Three na-
tionwide 
consumer 
reporting 
agencies 
(CRAs)—Equifax, Experian and TransUnion— 
consistently favor the side of the creditor or 
debt collector (‘‘the furnisher’’) over the con-
sumer. As documented in NCLC’s report 
Automated lniustice Redux (2019), some of 
the most serious problems include consumers 
having their credit files ‘‘mixed’’ with the 
wrong person, being unable to remove nega-
tive information even after court judgments 
in their favor, the after-effects of identity 
theft when CRAs don’t believe the victim, 
and being labeled as dead when they are 
alive and breathing. The report also docu-
ments the massive number of credit and con-
sumer reporting complaints to the Consumer 
Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), over 
380,000 since July 2011, which is often the top 
category of complaints to the CFPB. 
The irony of these problems is that credit 
reports consist of our information. Yet con-
sumers are only entitled to free access to 
this information once a year and in certain 
other limited situations, despite the fact 
that the Big Three nationwide CRAs are 
making tens of millions selling our financial 
data. Also, consumers are not entitled to our 
own credit scores for free, while these same 
scores are being sold to creditors and others 
for hefty profits. 
Last, but not least, there are serious issues 
with data security at the nationwide CRAs, 
of the type that led to the massive Equifax 
data breach in 2017. These data security 
issues have not yet been adequately ad-
dressed. 
The Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 
2019 would address these issues by: 
Fixing the broken system for credit report-
ing 
disputes 
by 
(1) 
creating 
a 
CFPB 
ombudsperson that will have the power to re-
solve persistent errors when CRAs don’t fix 
them properly, and to make referrels to the 
Office of Supervision or the Office of En-
forcement for supevisory or enforcement ac-
tion when CRAs don’t comply with their 
disput investigation reponsibilities and (2) 
requiring CRAs to dedicate sufficient re-
sources and provide proper training to per-
sonnel who handle disputes. 
Giving consumers the tools they need to 
access their rights, understand their credit-
worthiness, and control their financial des-
tinies by (1) giving consumers the right to 
unlimited free credit reports and free credit 
scores online; (2) requiring the Big Three na-
tionwide CRAs to create a simple, easy-to- 
use portal tool to access online credit re-
ports and credit scores, as well to exercise 
other important rights such as placing a se-
curity freeze, initiating a dispute, and opting 
out of prescreening (i.e., the use of credit re-
port information to generate offers of cred-
it). 
Improving credit reporting accuracy by (2) 
requiring CRAs to conduct periodic audits to 
check for accuracy and (2) mandating that 
Big Three nationwide CRAs use all 9 digits of 
the consumer’s Social Security number when 
matching information from a lender to a 
consumer’s file, thus preventing mixed files, 
which are one of the worst types of errors. 
Improving data security for credit reports 
by giving the CFPB the authority to write 
rules under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to 
govern the Big Three nationwide CRAs. 
Give consumers a tool to compel CRAs to 
fix a credit report by providing them with a 
right to seek injunctive relief so that a court 
could order a CRA to correct an error or oth-
erwise follow the law. 
There are a number of other important re-
forms in the bill, such as giving consumers 
the right to opt out of the selling or sharing 
of information about them that does not fall 
into the FCRA’s current definition of ‘‘con-
sumer report’’ and creating a comprehensive 
registry of all consumer reporting agencies. 
The above reforms are urgently needed in 
order to ensure that consumers are treated 
fairly by the credit reporting system and 
that they have the access and control that 
they should be entitled to. Thus, we support 
the Protecting Your Credit Score Act of 2019 
an look forward to working with you to 
swiftly enact it into law. 
Thank you for your attention. If you have 
any questions about this letter, please con-
tact Chi Chi Wu (cwu@nclc.org) at (617) 542–

Hon. JOSH GOTTHEIMER, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE GOTTHEIMER: On be-
half of the 1.4 million members of the Na-
tional Association of REALTORS® (NAR), I 
am pleased to support several provisions of 
H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit Score 
Act of 2020. 
NAR has a long history of involvement in 
issues concerning the use and disclosure of 
consumer credit data. Nearly 90 percent of 
home sales are financed, and a borrower’s 
credit report and credit score form a critical 
gateway to obtaining a mortgage. Unfortu-
nately, inaccurate credit reports and unfair 
credit reporting methods raise the cost to 
borrow and/or limit access to mortgage cred-
it for many prospective borrowers. 
REALTORS® believe that access to free 
credit scores, transparency in the reporting 
process and use of consumer credit informa-
tion, high standards for vetting credit infor-
mation, and a reliable method for contesting 
and correcting inaccurate information are 
critical to a vibrant housing market and 
economy. To this end, NAR applauds your ef-
forts in H.R. 5332, the Protecting Your Credit 
Score Act of 2020. We are particularly sup-
portive of sections two through six, which 
reflect NAR’s principles on credit reporting. 
While NAR has no position on the primary 
regulator of the CRAs, we appreciate your ef-
forts in clarifying that important point. 
Creditor and consumer confidence are crit-
ical in the home financing process, and our 
nation’s housing market and overall econ-
omy benefit tremendously from balanced fi-
nancial regulation and appropriate consumer 
protection. REALTORS® thank you for your 
diligent work to improve the accuracy and 
accountability of consumer credit informa-
tion. 
Sincerely, 
VINCE MALTA, 
2020 President, National Association 
of REALTORS®.

Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, pur-
suant to House Resolution 1017, I call 
up the joint resolution (H.J. Res. 90) 
providing for congressional disapproval 
under chapter 8 of title 5, United 
States Code, of the rule submitted by 
the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency relating to ‘‘Community Re-

The Clerk read the title of the joint

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 1017, the joint

The text of the joint resolution is as 
follows: 
H.J. RES. 90 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress 
assembled, 
That 
Congress 
dis-
approves the rule submitted by the Office of

‘‘Community

ber of the Committee on Financial 
Services. 
The gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. WATERS) and the gentleman from 
North Carolina (Mr. MCHENRY) each

The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days within 
which to revise and extend their re-
marks on H.J. Res. 90 and to insert ex-
traneous material thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in support of 
H.J. Res. 90, a Congressional Review 
Act resolution of disapproval to nullify 
the Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency’s rule undermining the Com-
munity Reinvestment Act. 
I introduced this resolution with our 
Consumer Protection and Financial In-
stitutions Subcommittee chair, Rep-
resentative MEEKS, and I am proud we 
are joined by 70 other Members who 
have cosponsored the resolution. 
The Community Reinvestment Act is 
a civil rights act. It is a law enacted in 
1977 to prevent the discriminatory 
practice of redlining, in which banks 
discriminate against prospective cus-
tomers in nearby neighborhoods, often 
based on their racial or ethnic back-
ground. The law requires banks to in-
vest and lend responsibly in low- and 
moderate-income communities where 
they are chartered. 
Unfortunately, 
implementation 
of 
the Community Reinvestment Act has 
not been robust. Today, 98 percent of 
the banks routinely pass their Commu-
nity Reinvestment Act exams. How-
ever, research has shown that more 
than 60 metro areas across the country 
are now experiencing modern-day red-
lining today. These findings clearly 
demonstrate the need to strengthen 
the implementation of the law. Unfor-
tunately, the OCC’s rule would do the 
opposite. 
Despite the warnings of a wide range 
of stakeholders, former Comptroller 
Otting rushed to finalize this rule in 
his final days on the job. So, without 
the support—without the support—of 
the Federal Reserve or the Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation, the other 
banking regulators were responsible for 
enforcing the law. 
Mr. Otting appears to have been de-
termined to undermine the Community 
Reinvestment Act ever since the law 
complicated his efforts to quickly ob-
tain regulatory approval for OneWest 
Bank, a bank that he ran with Treas-
ury Secretary Mnuchin, to merge with 
another bank in 2015. 
I am deeply concerned that the OCC’s 
final rule will harm low-income and 
minority communities that are dis-
proportionately suffering during this 
crisis, effectively turning the Commu-
nity Reinvestment Act into the com-
munity disinvestment act. 
If this resolution is not adopted, we 
will have different rules for different 
banks, leading to regulatory arbitrage 
and a race to the bottom of weaker 
standards that will only hurt the peo-
ple the law is intended to help. 
Notably, the OCC rule was adopted 
with insufficient and incomplete data, 
and it incentivizes large deals at the 
expense of smaller and more contin-
uous financial transactions that truly 
benefit LMI communities. 
For example, the OCC final rule al-
lows CRA credit to be given for activi-
ties 
in 
LMI-qualified 
opportunity 
zones, but the rule does not ensure that 
these activities promote community 
development that includes affordable 
housing or small business economic de-
velopment. This can lead to the unac-
ceptable result of banks receiving CRA 
funding for building luxury housing in 
opportunity zones, providing no direct 
benefit to LMI communities. 
Additionally, the OCC concedes it 
does not have all the data it needs to 
properly 
implement 
its 
new 
CRA 
framework, with the rules stating that 
the OCC will need to issue yet another 
notice of proposed rulemaking in the 
future to help set specific benchmarks, 
thresholds, and minimums. It doesn’t 
speak highly of a rule when the office 
says it is half baked. 
A wide range of stakeholders have 
criticized OCC’s efforts. For example, a 
group of civil rights and consumer 
groups issued a statement noting: ‘‘The 
new OCC rules stick with an overly 
simplistic metrics system that creates 
a loophole for banks to exploit, allow-
ing them to get a passing CRA rating 
by making investments in commu-
nities where they can reap the largest 
rewards, while leaving too many credit 
needs 
unmet 
for 
underserved 
con-
sumers and neighbors.’’ 
During these difficult times, commu-
nities across the country have taken to 
the streets to demand justice and to 
tell their elected officials that they 
can no longer ignore the needs of com-
munities of color. In a letter sup-
porting this resolution from various or-
ganizations led by the Leadership Con-
ference on Civil and Human Rights and 
National Community Reinvestment Co-
alition, they wrote: ‘‘In the weeks 
since the OCC finalized its rule, our Na-
tion has been facing a long overdue 
reckoning with our troubled legacy of 
racial and ethnic discrimination. . . . 
Now is certainly not the time to weak-
en the most important civil rights laws 
we have at our disposal to correct 
those disparities.’’ 
Congress must block any effort by 
the Trump administration to weaken 
our civil rights laws and send a strong 
message to Federal regulators that 
they should be doing all they can dur-
ing this pandemic to help, not hurt, 
low- 
and 
moderate-income 
commu-
nities, and especially communities of 
color. 
By passing this resolution, Congress 
will block the OCC’s harmful rule so 
that, once the pandemic passes, bank-
ing regulators can renew efforts to col-
laborate, modernize, and strengthen 
the Community Reinvestment Act with 
a new joint rulemaking that truly ben-
efits the community the law was in-
tended to help.

leagues in the House to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.J. Res. 90.

Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I

Madam Speaker, as I said, I rise in

fore I get into the contents of my dis-
cussion here, I want to thank Chair-
woman WATERS for her steadfast and 
long-time leadership in supporting mi-
nority, rural, low- and middle-income 
communities, LMI communities. Her

Senate and Congress has been commen-
surate with that work and that focus.

these communities. For example, we 
know that community development fi-
nancial institutions and minority de-
pository institutions play critical roles 
in getting necessary funds to the 
smallest of small businesses in these 
communities. 
Committee Republicans support the 
efforts of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram to target small lenders as well as 
small businesses in communities across 
America. 
Committee Republicans believe the 
reforms made in the underlying final 
rule promulgated by the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency will con-
tinue to support minority, rural, and 
LMI communities into the 21st cen-
tury. 
Madam Speaker, the Community Re-
investment Act was enacted in 1977, 
nearly 43 years ago. Its purpose was to 
ensure 
depository 
institutions 
like 
banks and savings associations help 
meet the needs of their local commu-
nities. The law tasks the OCC, as well 
as the other bank regulators, with 
issuing rules to carry out that purpose. 
However, the last time the CRA regula-
tions were meaningfully updated was 
in 1995. 
I think we can all agree that a lot 
has changed in the past 25 years, in-
cluding how banks can best serve their 
communities. Much of this change has 
been driven by technology and innova-
tion. 
In 1995, it was cutting edge when you 
could call your bank and get your bal-
ance and the last couple of checks that 
cleared your account. Calling up and 
not having to talk with somebody and 
a computer tell you the answer, that 
was cutting edge. And at that time, 
only 24 percent of Americans had 
accessed the internet. 
Since that time, we have witnessed a 
massive shift to online and mobile de-
livery of banking services, and that is 
for good in many, many ways. This 
virus has really enhanced that trend 
just in the last few months. This means 
that where banks get their deposits 
doesn’t necessarily match up with 
where their branches are physically lo-
cated. 
Second, the number of bank branches 
has steadily declined since the finan-
cial crisis, but the CRA regulations 
continue to place a very heavy empha-
sis on banks’ physical footprints rather 
than where they truly serve. 
At the same time, CRA exams have 
gotten more complex and less trans-
parent. Banks can only guess which of 
their community investments will re-
ceive credit, because the exams are 
quite highly subjective. The written 
evaluations can be thousands of pages 
long, and yet the regulators and the 
public have no clear data to help un-
derstand where all the CRA money has 
gone. 
But there are, sadly, a few things 
that have not changed in the last 25 
years—sadly—including socioeconomic 
conditions in the poorest communities, 
economic opportunity, and the per-
sistent lack of capital in those commu-
nities. The CRA is intended to help ad-
dress those issues, and that is why it is 
a vital and important law and, properly 
structured, can deliver in a better way. 
But, clearly, we know the status quo 
is not working. It is not working for 
the communities that we care des-
perately about giving opportunity to, 
economic opportunity to, and that is 
really what this is driven towards with 
this law. 
Modernizing this regulatory frame-
work is long overdue. Here are a few 
aspects of the rule that I believe rep-
resent major improvements over the 
old regulations. 
First, the rule provides for a public 
list of activities that will count for 
CRA credit so the community can un-
derstand, the banks can understand, 
and we, as elected officials who have 
oversight of this program, we can un-
derstand, too. And they will have that 
public list on what counts for CRA 
credit. 
This list will eliminate regulatory 
ambiguity and provide certainty over 
the types of investments that will lead 
to a good evaluation. With more cer-
tainly, banks will naturally make more 
investments. That is how capitalism 
works. This change alone is likely to 
increase 
community 
reinvestment 
across the board. 
Second, the rule provides a better 
model for where the activity can count. 
Banks will be incentivized to invest 
where they take deposits instead of 
only around their branches. Let me ex-
plain. 
Previously, a bank was only evalu-
ated on its lending and investment in 
an area around its physical footprint, 
but banking today is very different 
than it was a generation ago when this 
regulation was written. Banking today, 
with the help of new technology and in-
novation has changed substantially. 
So, if an online bank chooses a head-
quarters in one State—let me give you 
an example: Utah. 
Utah has a lot of online banks and 
they domicile in Salt Lake City, so 
that is where the community giving is 
around Salt Lake City, even if they 
take most of their deposits from Chair-
woman WATERS’ district or my district. 
So, if you have that headquarters for 
an online bank, it should not prevent 
them from making investments in 
other States or localities that des-
perately need capital. 
Under the final rule, banks will get 
credit for investing in so-called bank-
ing deserts. This has been a priority of 
mine for the last decade, to help those 
who are in communities where they 
can’t get ready access. We know food 
deserts in urban areas, and if you can’t 
get access to fresh food, you can’t have 
a healthy diet. 
b 1630 
That is a huge issue. It is a huge 
issue in rural areas, it is a huge issue 
in urban areas. 
So we have banking deserts now, and 
this rule prioritizes those banking 
deserts that don’t have a branch or 
don’t have many branches. And those 
underserved places under this rule are 
distressed 
areas, 
economically 
dis-
tressed areas, Tribal lands, folks that 
have been hit by natural disasters, re-
gardless of where they get deposits or 
if they get deposits from those areas. I 
think there are some laudable changes. 
Now 
communities 
without 
bank 
branches that were essentially invis-
ible under the current framework will 
be able to receive CRA investment. 
This is a huge improvement. 
Finally, the rule introduces objective 
metrics and transparent evaluations. I 
think that is a really good thing for 
regulation. Instead of a highly subjec-
tive exam and a 1,000-page evaluation, 
examiners will be able to deliver more 
consistent, useful, and timely CRA 
evaluations; ‘‘timely’’ meaning more 
frequent and more readily available. 
Clearer metrics and better reporting 
will enable banks, regulators, and the 
public to have a better understanding 
of the CRA activities of individual 
banks and of cross-sections of the in-
dustry. Consumers will be able to see 
that and understand the type of insti-
tution they are banking with as well. 
I would also note that this final rule 
is a culmination of a multiyear proc-
ess. It reflects more than a decade of 
dialogue about how to make the CRA 
work better, it builds on recommenda-
tions that Federal banking agencies 
submitted to Congress in 2017 and rec-
ommendations released by the Treas-
ury Department in April of 2018 and 
more than 75 hard comments submitted 
during the rulemaking process that up-
dated and changed and made better the 
regulations that the administration 
put forward. 
Republicans and Democrats agree the 
Community Reinvestment Act is ex-
tremely important, it is an important 
law. And because it is important, the 
regulations need to keep pace with how 
Americans bank today. 
I believe this rule is a huge improve-
ment over the status quo. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this resolution 
and support the underlying rule. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS), who is the 
chairman of the Subcommittee on Con-
sumer Protection and Financial Insti-
tutions and the coauthor of this bill. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.J. Res. 90, and I am 
proud to have joined Chairwoman 
WATERS in introducing it. 
This resolution provides for congres-
sional disapproval of the rule sub-
mitted by the Office of the Comptroller 
of the Currency relating to the Com-
munity Reinvestment Act. 
The Community Reinvestment Act 
was enacted into law, as indicated, in 
1977 as a direct response to the long, 
painful legacy of structural discrimina-
tion, financial exclusion, redlining, and

economic suppression of racial minori-
ties in America, a legacy of prejudice 
and economic exclusion that we are 
seeing all-too-clearly still echoes to 
this day, which is why many of the in-
dividuals you see in the streets today 
want to correct this structural problem 
that we have in our Nation. 
At its core, the Community Reinvest-
ment Act is a civil rights bill. It was 
the fourth in a series of banking bills 
passed to address systemic discrimina-
tion in banking, including the Fair 
Housing Act of 1968, the Equal Credit 
Opportunity Act of 1974, and the Home 
Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975. 
These bills built on the findings of 
the 1961 report from the U.S. Commis-
sion on Civil Rights, and community- 
led civil action in Chicago to hold 
banks accountable for rampant dis-
crimination in lending in Black and 
Hispanic communities. 
Any efforts at reforms and mod-
ernization must remain true to this 
legacy, particularly given the over-
whelming evidence of continued dis-
crimination in banking and access to 
finance. 
We must make sure that when we 
look at the CRA, the CRA is creating 
an opportunity for minority businesses 
to thrive and strive and investing fur-
ther in its communities; that afford-
able housing is something that is 
there, not something where we are in-
vesting and driving people out so they 
can’t have the benefits in the commu-
nity. It must be relevant to the com-
munity and keeping the people in the 
community so that they can see a bet-
ter life. 
Under Comptroller Otting’s leader-
ship, the OCC’s work on CRA mod-
ernization has systematically failed to 
remain true to the law’s civil rights 
roots. In fact, the very way in which 
the rule was finalized and published by 
the OCC was symptomatic of the agen-
cy’s failed approach from the start. It 
was rushed, unfinished, unsupported by 
data, and not done in coordination 
with the other prudential regulators. 
And to cap it all off, Comptroller 
Otting abandoned his post within the 
very same week of publishing this rule, 
in the middle of a pandemic, economic 
crisis, and a looming banking crisis, 
leaving everyone else to hold the bag. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, the 
fact is, there is room to modernize CRA 
and to update it to the realities of 
modern-day banking. The Fed and com-
munity advocacy groups have put for-
ward some thoughtful ideas on just 
how to do that. 
Let us pass this bill, let us stop this 
ill-fated rule that the OCC put out, and 
let us do some real CRA to help people 
in these communities who have been 
deprived for far too long. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. TIPTON), a great member 
from the Financial Services Committee 
who also is the vice chair of the West-
ern Caucus. 
Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to the resolution 
on the floor today. 
We agree that the Community Rein-
vestment Act is an important historic 
piece 
of 
legislation; 
however, 
my 
friends 
across 
the 
aisle 
have 
mischaracterized the OCC’s rule and 
the modernization of the CRA. 
First, the OCC’s rulemaking process 
has 
been 
thorough, 
inclusive, 
and 
thoughtful. CRA regulations haven’t 
been meaningfully updated since 1995, 
making this a much-needed effort to 
ensure that regulations match the 
modern state of the banking industry. 
The OCC’s processes included input 
from the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, 
the Federal Financial Institutions Ex-
amination Council, and the Treasury 
Department. 
The OCC has also provided ample op-
portunities for regulated banks and 
consumer groups to weigh in. 
What is more, 94 percent of the par-
ticipants in the OCC’s advance notice 
of proposed rulemaking agreed that the 
current CRA rules lack objectivity, 
transparency, and fairness. These are 
the central themes to the OCC’s mod-
ernization effort. 
Second, this update to the CRA is 
needed now more than ever. One large 
bank’s CEO recently noted that due to 
COVID–19, the bank has seen some-
where between a 17 and 35 percent in-
crease in online banking activity that 
normally would have been conducted in 
the branch. Americans are turning to 
online banking resources now more 
than ever. 
The OCC’s rule takes steps to be able 
to ensure that CRA dollars go into low- 
to-moderate 
income 
communities 
where banks draw their deposits, not 
only where they have bank branches. 
This change is forward-looking and 
should mark significant new opportuni-
ties to be able to invest in underserved 
communities. 
Third, the OCC regularly and mean-
ingfully engaged with critics in the 
rulemaking process. The OCC met with 
community, consumer, and academic 
groups to listen to their concerns 
about the proposal. 
These 
meetings 
resulted 
in 
real 
changes to the OCC’s final rule, includ-
ing a raised exemption threshold for 
community banks, changes to the 
treatment of mortgage origination and 
sale on the secondary market for pur-
poses of the CRA, and raising the bar 
for a passing grade in CRA examina-
tions. 
This rule creates greater account-
ability between banks and the commu-
nities they invest in under the CRA. It 
adds transparency in what activity 
counts towards CRA credit, creates 
fairer and more timely examinations, 
and allows CRA performances to be 
measured assessment over assessment 
and against other banks. It also allows 
banks to reach new constituencies with 
their CRA dollars, most notably dis-
abled, Tribal, rural, and farm popu-
lations. 
By increasing regulatory certainty 
and reducing subjectivity, the OCC 
CRA modernization rule can equal 
greater lending and investment in un-
derserved communities. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the measure. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN), the chairman of the 
Subcommittee on Oversight and Inves-
tigations. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, it is an honor to serve in the Con-
gress of the United States of America 
under Chairwoman WATERS’ leadership. 
Madam Speaker, Ms. WATERS and I 
both know that the CRA was not born 
to create luxury homes in opportunity 
zones. The CRA was not birthed to pro-
vide opportunities in what are being 
called banking deserts that may not be 
LMI communities. 
The CRA was born to correct the 
harm that the government had done in 
the 1930s. 
At that time, the government, by and 
through the FHA, decided that it would 
craft maps, and these maps had red 
lines on them. These red lines became 
communities that were undesirable, 
but more appropriately, they were 
deemed unsafe, and as a result, lending 
institutions would not lend in these 
redlined areas. 
The CRA was born to end the dis-
crimination, the redlining, but this bill 
takes a step back to the 1930s. 
This bill will not undo the harm that 
was done; it will increase the harm. I 
cannot support it. 
The CRA was created to help LMI, 
low-to-moderate income, communities 
have banking privileges that they were 
denied under the law. 
This bill doesn’t help us with the 
LMIs. It is going to give those big guys 
an opportunity to acquire these funds. 
I stand against it. 
Madam Speaker, I support the chair 
of the committee and I stand for jus-
tice for the LMI communities. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Michigan (Mr. HUIZENGA), my friend 
and the ranking member of the Sub-
committee on Investor Protection, En-
trepreneurship, and Capital Markets. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 90, 
which is an effort to overturn a long- 
overdue regulatory update of the Com-
munity Reinvestment Act. 
Frankly, it is ludicrous to compare 
this modernization effort to bringing 
us back to 1930s banking policy. I don’t 
understand how my colleagues on the 
other side can possibly equate that. 
So we all agree the fundamental pur-
pose of the Community Reinvestment 
Act is to combat unacceptable, dis-
criminatory 
redlining, 
and 
demand 
that banks meet the credit needs of

their communities. There is no dis-
agreement on that. My friend from 
New York laid out that history very, 
very well. It is the reason why we sup-
port the CRA and modernizing it. 
However, the regulations promul-
gated to implement the CRA haven’t 
been meaningfully updated since 1995. 
Now, earlier we were talking about 
credit reporting, and the chair cited 
the fact that we had not addressed this 
in 17 years, as to why we needed to pass 
the bill that was on the floor. Well, we 
haven’t addressed the CRA in any 
meaningful way for 25 years. We have 8 
years on that on this particular issue. 
So in May of this year, the Office of 
the Comptroller of the Currency issued 
a final rule that modernizes the Com-
munity Reinvestment Act regulations 
for the 21st century. 
The final rule provides clarity to 
banks on what activities count for a 
Community Reinvestment Credit, up-
dated the geographic definitions of a 
bank’s community, as well as accounts 
for the technological transformation of 
banking services that we have seen. 
This will ensure that banks’ reinvest-
ment will be in those communities that 
need it most. 
The final rule establishes new per-
formance standards and metrics that 
will allow OCC bank examiners to 
measure performance objectively and 
produce more consistent, useful, and 
timely Community Reinvestment Act 
evaluations to provide more clarity to 
banks. 
Now, I understand that some of my 
colleagues want to have this ‘‘let’s 
move the target to my pet project’’ 
kind of a way of evaluating where a 
bank is going, but that is not what it is 
intended to do. 
Lastly, 
this 
modernization 
intro-
duces objective reporting measures 
that will allow comparison over time 
and between banks, which has never 
been possible in the history of the 
CRA. What is a good project in one 
neighborhood should be viewed as a 
good project in an adjacent neighbor-
hood, and that isn’t the case today. 
b 1645 
As we work to ensure a strong eco-
nomic recovery for all Americans—all 
Americans—it is critical that we en-
courage financial institutions to con-
tinue to provide services to those most 
in need. 
I have the poorest county in the 
State of Michigan. I have urban and 
suburban areas. These are issues that 
affect all of America. 
The OCC’s rule will play an impor-
tant role in this recovery effort by en-
couraging more capital, investment, 
and lending services in the commu-
nities hardest hit by COVID–19. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Michigan an 
additional 1 minute. 
Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate the ranking member doing 
that. Let me just wrap up. 
By using the Congressional Review 
Act to overturn this critical final rule, 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle will only delay progress and harm 
the very communities that I know they 
want to protect. Those are the same 
communities that I serve as well. 
I urge all of my colleagues to vote 
against this partisan attempt to over-
turn much-needed reform and mod-
ernization of the Community Reinvest-
ment Act, and I am hopeful that we are 
going to be able to come together and 
work on true, meaningful, actual re-
form in the long run. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. HECK), a senior mem-
ber of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. HECK. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for introducing this 
important measure, of which I am a 
proud cosponsor. 
This resolution is especially timely 
as we reckon with the legacy of dis-
crimination in our country. In that 
process, we must consider how housing 
policy has contributed to systemic in-
equality. 
For decades in this country, we al-
lowed a Federal agency to legitimize 
racial discrimination by creating those 
color-coded maps indicating where in-
vestments 
would 
be 
profitable, 
‘‘greenlined,’’ or where it would not be, 
‘‘redlined.’’ 
We built institutional obstacles for 
Black families trying to purchase a 
home, and that resulted in devastating, 
intergenerational financial disadvan-
tages. 
Redlining prevented access to the 
single most important wealth-building 
tool an American has access to, that is, 
owning a home. The result? Black fam-
ilies have a median net worth of 
$17,000, compared to $171,000 for White 
families. In fact, homeownership by 
Black families is 44 percent, and by 
White families, 74 percent. 
We have a responsibility to do every-
thing we can to correct this. After all, 
we created it. 
Yet, in the middle of a pandemic that 
has made racial disparities all the 
more pronounced, the OCC rushed out a 
final rule that undermined the legisla-
tion that made redlining illegal, and 
they even did it without the support of 
the Federal Reserve or FDIC. 
The OCC’s vague definitions and 
overly simplistic metrics do not do jus-
tice to what a crucial role homeowner-
ship and housing policy have played in 
racial inequality. 
Their approach takes us backward. If 
you don’t want to go backward, vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this measure. If you believe 
homeownership should be available to 
all Americans, regardless of skin color, 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on this matter. If you op-
pose redlining, vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
measure. If you want to stand for ra-
cial justice, vote ‘‘yes’’ on this meas-
ure. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
would just note for the RECORD that 
the FDIC approved just this week this 
rule, the CRA, so that is, in fact, they 
actually support this underlying rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to 
the gentleman from Little Rock, Ar-
kansas (Mr. HILL), my colleague and 
friend, the ranking member of the Na-
tional Security, International Develop-
ment 
and 
Monetary 
Policy 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member 
for the time. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in oppo-
sition to H.J. Res. 90, but I rise in sup-
port of the Community Reinvestment 
Act. And I rise in support of the goal of 
CRA, for a fair and more equitable 
treatment of financial investment, par-
ticularly in low- and moderate-income 
areas of our communities. 
This resolution overturns the up-
dated Community Reinvestment Act 
regulation before it has even had a 
chance to take effect. 
Speaking purely from a procedural 
standpoint, this resolution, in my view, 
Madam Speaker, is not necessary. We 
could be spending time on the House 
floor today in a much more productive 
way to advance the economy. 
The Office of the Comptroller of the 
Currency has gone through a rigorous 
Administrative Procedure Act process. 
I think our constituents should know 
they have conducted outreach since 
2017, 3 years, and have taken all that 
into consideration, the Federal Reserve 
data, Treasury recommendations, and 
have conducted both advanced notice 
for proposed rulemaking and a notice 
of proposed rulemaking, and received 
7,500 comments. 
The final rule ended up incorporating 
much of this serious and constructive 
criticism 
received 
from 
all 
stake-
holders, 
notably, 
our 
community 
groups. 
Banks have been complying with the 
Community 
Reinvestment 
Act 
for 
years. This is not a new rule, Madam 
Speaker. This rule is simply being up-
dated to reflect the current economic 
and banking conditions in our country. 
The last time that was updated was 
1995. 
Working for a publicly traded bank 
in Arkansas then, I was involved in the 
training and the implementation at 
that bank for those 1995 revisions. 
Madam Speaker, as one of the few 
Members of Congress who has actually 
gone through multiple CRA examina-
tions, I can assure my colleagues that 
this rule could benefit from a thought-
ful update. 
The final rule clarifies what counts 
for CRA credit. It updates what bank 
activity counts for CRA credit. It eval-
uates the CRA performance of our fi-
nancial institutions in a much more 
fair, open manner. It makes CRA re-
porting more transparent and faster. It 
reflects the fintech community of dig-
ital banking in our country today. And 
it enhances CRA for rural areas and 
Tribal areas in our country. 
In short, the bank branch issue that 
the ranking member mentioned is seri-
ous. We have had a shrinking number

of banks since the original rule was 
proposed in 1977, and the CRA rule was 
connected to those bank branches. 
That is another reason for modernizing 
the rule. 
Since we created this bank branch 
closure system by our economy con-
tracting the number of banks, due to 
regulation and the like, it is a double 
whammy, so let’s make sure that our 
banks can get credit for doing a good 
job on accessing of all of our commu-
nities, particularly our minority, low- 
to-moderate income, and rural areas 
served by those institutions. 
Let’s fix this problem by having the 
certainty that we have an effective 
CRA rule, that it is implemented prop-
erly, and that we can all see our con-
stituencies benefited by that. 
Let’s let the Comptroller of the Cur-
rency do their job. They are the bank-
ing experts. They are the ones who 
have been managing this work. Con-
gress should not be undermining it. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the chair-
man for the time, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on the resolution 
but support the work of the Commu-
nity Reinvestment Act. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY), a 
member of the Financial Services Com-
mittee. 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in support of this critical 
resolution reversing a rule tainted by 
conflicts of interest and callous dis-
regard for the communities most af-
fected. 
As hundreds of thousands take to the 
streets, as the cries for a reckoning 
with this Nation’s past and present 
grow louder, this administration be-
lieves that the future is further deregu-
lation. 
Today, we reject the administration’s 
position that it is banks that are de-
serving of our time and sympathy as 
further relief funding is denied to mil-
lions of struggling families. 
There is no separating the history of 
banking from the history of racism in 
this country. Wall Street, our Nation’s 
financial capital, is named after a 
structure erected by enslaved people 
and then served as a site where they 
were bought and sold. 
Today, we have predatory lenders set 
up in Black communities, where sys-
tems of oppression ensure a steady 
stream of customers, communities that 
banks have decided are simply not 
worth their time or their business. 
The Community Reinvestment Act 
reflects, and is a direct response to this 
history, and aims to reverse course. 
I urge all of my colleagues to ac-
knowledge the decades of divestment 
from our communities and to support 
this crucial civil rights legislation. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Janesville, Wisconsin (Mr. STEIL). 
Mr. STEIL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the resolution of 
disapproval. 
The Community Reinvestment Act is 
an important law that encourages in-
vestments in places like Racine, Keno-
sha, and Janesville, and communities 
in need across this country. But the 
rulings governing the CRA haven’t 
been updated since 1995. 
In the last 25 years, the banking in-
dustry 
has 
undergone 
significant 
changes. 
Small 
and 
medium-sized 
banks have consolidated and closed. 
Branches have disappeared from some 
rural and low-income areas. Tech-
nology has drastically affected the way 
millions of Americans are conducting 
their banking. 
The CRA needs to be updated to fit 
the banking system we have today and 
to meet the needs of the communities 
in 2020. That is exactly what the OCC is 
trying to do with the new rule. 
The new CRA rule provides financial 
institutions with greater clarity about 
which activities count for CRA credit 
and where that activity needs to take 
place. It also takes into account the re-
ality that many banking activities are 
conducted online by giving banks that 
are largely digital credit for investing 
in areas where they take deposits. 
By implementing consistent, objec-
tive metrics, the new CRA rule also 
makes it easier for examiners to meas-
ure the performance and to compare in-
stitutions. 
This 
resolution 
of 
dis-
approval would block all that progress, 
to the detriment of communities in 
need. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this resolution. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. OCASIO-CORTEZ), 
who is also a member of the Financial 
Services Committee. 
Ms. 
OCASIO-CORTEZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairwoman WATERS 
for her continued leadership on the 
Community Reinvestment Act. 
Over the last several weeks, our Na-
tion has been gripped by the uprisings 
against anti-Black racism and sys-
temic 
racial 
injustice 
across 
the 
United States. But there is a difference 
between saying that we believe in the 
inherent dignity, equality, and value of 
our Black brothers and sisters and ac-
tually committing to it. The Commu-
nity Reinvestment Act is one such 
commitment. 
Our Nation has an unconscionable ra-
cial wealth gap that is directly rooted 
in the racist financial practice of red-
lining, whereby Black communities 
had red lines drawn around them on a 
map and were systematically denied 
banking, housing, and economic oppor-
tunities. 
As a result, generations of White 
communities were given a head start at 
homeownership, which was the founda-
tion of generational wealth, while 
Black communities were denied. 
This fuels a runaway generational 
wealth gap that haunts the United 
States today. It is a practice that con-
tinues, with over 60 metro areas, in 
this very moment, having banks that 
deny Black applicants at significantly 
higher rates than they do White appli-
cants. 
Now, the CRA is an antiracist, anti-
poverty policy that seeks to remedy 
some of the damage done. 
Yet, while this administration and 
the Republican Party paid lip service 
to Black and Brown communities with 
toothless policing legislation, behind 
everyone’s back, the OCC made moves 
to gut rules around the CRA and ad-
vance the continued economic oppres-
sion of Black people in the United 
States. In fact, these rule changes ad-
vance gentrification and value luxury 
housing over investment in Black lives. 
Well, to that move, we have four 
words: Not on our watch. That is be-
cause, in this House, in the 116th 
House, under the leadership of Chair-
woman WATERS, we will value Black 
lives. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A), a member of the 
Financial Services Committee. 
b 1700 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairwoman WATERS 
for this opportunity. 
I rise in support of this resolution 
and join my colleagues in opposition to 
the Trump administration’s new rule 
that weakens implementation of the 
Community Reinvestment Act. 
It is an outrage that the Trump ad-
ministration’s OCC issued this rule 
that guts a historic law in the midst of 
an unprecedented pandemic. 
To add insult to injury, former Chair-
man Otting resigned his post imme-
diately after issuing the rule so that he 
will avoid cleaning up the fallout from 
this mess. It is up to Congress to clean 
it up, and that is what we are seeking 
to do. 
The Community Reinvestment Act 
was enacted more than 40 years ago 
and has been one of our most powerful 
tools against redlining and the per-
petration of systemic racism and pov-
erty. 
Like so much of our country’s his-
tory, the story of the CRA runs 
through Chicago, where a local commu-
nity organizer in the Austin neighbor-
hood, Gale Cincotta, led the fight 
against discriminatory housing injus-
tice and earned the nickname ‘‘Mother 
of the CRA.’’ Through her work with 
her neighborhood association and Na-
tional People’s Action, Cincotta fought 
against redlining and disinvestment 
from our communities using some of 
the innovative and confrontational tac-
tics that we recognize in today’s pro-
test movements. 
My district is a working-class immi-
grant district, and Gale Cincotta and 
organizers like her across the country 
fought to pass the CRA so that commu-
nities like mine would not be left be-
hind by financial institutions. 
The OCC’s rule allows lenders to 
count activities that have nothing to

do with improving our neighborhoods 
toward their requirements to serve 
low- 
and 
moderate-income 
commu-
nities, 
decrease 
transparency, 
and 
make it even harder to hold these in-
stitutions accountable. That is why we 
oppose it. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close. 
May I inquire if there are further 
speakers on the majority side. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
have additional speakers. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Florida (Mr. CRIST), who is a member 
of the Appropriations Committee. 
Mr. CRIST. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to thank 
Chairwoman WATERS for promoting ac-
cess to capital for minority borrowers. 
Since the murder of George Floyd, 
our Nation has embarked on a true, 
broad-based push to defeat institu-
tional racism. America is coming to re-
alize that racism did not end with 
emancipation, and it did not end with 
civil rights. It is still very much with 
us all today. 
So, as we commit ourselves to Black 
Lives Matter, we need to also ensure 
Black 
communities 
matter, 
Black 
homeownership matters, Black wealth 
matters, and Black businesses matter. 
My hometown of south St. Peters-
burg, Florida, is blessed by a large and 
vibrant Black community where, de-
spite their strength, pride, character, 
and entrepreneurial spirit, we are still 
working to overcome institutional rac-
ism. Underinvestment in the commu-
nity, food deserts, and redlining exist. 
This past weekend, I witnessed the 
unveiling of the Black Lives Matter 
mural in front of the Dr. Carter G. 
Woodson African American Museum. It 
is right near one of my favorite res-
taurants on the south side, Chief’s Cre-
ole Cafe. 
While the art moved me beyond 
words, reality quickly set in. The own-
ers of Chief’s Creole, the Brayboys, 
were told by their bank that they 
couldn’t get a PPP loan, not because 
they didn’t qualify, but because the big 
banks are leaving behind the smallest 
businesses, businesses overrepresented 
by Black, women, and veteran owners. 
If the banks aren’t making PPP 
loans to Black-owned businesses when 
they don’t have skin in the game, how 
can we trust them to do the right thing 
when it is their own money at risk? 
That is why the Community Rein-
vestment Act is so vitally important. 
That is why we need it to work for the 
communities it was actually designed 
to serve. 
The OCC got it wrong. Vote ‘‘yes’’ to 
repeal the rule. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, if Mr. 
MCHENRY has no more speakers, I am 
prepared to close. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
So, in closing, the Community Rein-
vestment Act, we agree, is an impor-
tant law that is intended to support 
underserved communities across Amer-
ica. Maintaining the status quo also ig-
nores the innovation and the needs of 
our community. 
The innovations taking place to fi-
nancial services and to banking over 
the last 25 years need to be addressed, 
but also the fact that we are not actu-
ally meeting the needs desperately 
needed in communities around our dis-
trict, both the urban and rural. 
The new regulations will increase in-
vestment and capital in communities 
and provide more clarity and trans-
parency to all parties involved in the 
process. That is why it is a good up-
date. 
As we work to ensure a strong eco-
nomic recovery for all Americans, it is 
critical we encourage financial institu-
tions to continue to provide services 
for those most in need. The OCC’s final 
rule will play an important role in this 
recovery effort by encouraging more 
capital, investment, and lending serv-
ices in the communities hardest hid by 
COVID–19. That is good. 
The OCC took a very thoughtful ap-
proach, embracing input from other 
agencies and stakeholders over the 
course of several years. The final rule 
builds in nearly all of the constructive 
criticism 
the 
agency 
has 
received 
through the open comment process. In 
fact, this shows the agency is willing 
to compromise but not willing to settle 
for the status quo. 
The OCC’s modernization of the CRA 
regulation is a long overdue update 
that will help our communities come 
into the 21st century stronger and 
healthier. The last time these regula-
tions were revised was in 1995, when 
banking received most of their deposits 
through branches, and as such, the old 
regulations that are on the books still 
rely heavily on branch locations. 
Quite frankly, what we have seen 
over the last 100 days in America is 
that branches are less vital than they 
were in previous generations, because 
most of these branches have been shut 
down in our States because our States 
are trying to do the right thing to ad-
dress this health crisis. That is why we 
are wearing masks, that is why we are 
social distancing, and that is why we 
are trying to be responsible to one an-
other and be thoughtful in our ap-
proach to one another. 
But, unfortunately, this bill before us 
is a very straightforward up-and-down. 
I will say let’s not support the status 
quo. Let’s support innovation and an 
update to our regulation to meet the 
needs of our communities and to meet 
the needs that are so desperately need-
ed both in the rural communities and 
the urban communities in America. 
Vote against this resolution and sup-
port the underlying rule. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time is re-
maining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 81⁄2 min-
utes remaining. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, be-
fore I move into my closing, I would 
like to correct Mr. MCHENRY, who said 
the FDIC approved the OCC CRA rule 
this week. That is not correct. My staff 
just called the FDIC to confirm that 
they did not approve the rule. 
Mr. MCHENRY. Will the gentle-
woman yield? 
Ms. WATERS. I yield to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. MCHENRY. I misspoke. I said 
they supported the CRA. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I

groups in support of H.J. Res. 90. 
CHIEF COUNSEL’S OFFICE, OFFICE OF 
THE
COMPTROLLER
OF
THE
CUR-
RENCY, 
Washington, DC. 
Attention: Comment Processing 
We are writing to oppose the Federal De-
posit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and the 
Office of Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) 
proposed changes that would seriously weak-
en the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
The U.S. Conference of Mayors has strong 
policy supporting the CRA. The law was 
passed in 1977 to end redlining, and to meet 
the credit needs of communities where banks 
do business. Discrimination in lending still 
exists. 
But the FDIC and OCC proposed changes 
would make the banks less accountable to 
their communities through complex and con-
fusing performance measures on CRA exams 
while oversimplifying how bank’s perform-
ances to local needs are measured. Moreover, 
public input into the process will be difficult 
and limited. This will result in significantly 
fewer loans, investments and services to 
communities most in need of more credit and 
capital. 
The CRA has been of enormous benefit to 
low- and -moderate income Americans. For 
example, since 1996, CRA-covered banks 
issued more than 27 million small business 
loans in low-and moderate-income tracts, to-
taling $1.093 trillion, and $1.076 trillion in 
community development loans that support 
affordable housing and economic develop-
ment projects benefitting low-and moderate- 
income communities. 
While such results are very good, the pro-
posed rule will make it all but impossible to 
continue such impressive results. Moreover, 
much more can be achieved by regulations 
that modernize the CRA to take into ac-
count changes in the banking industry and 
the economy. For example, independent 
mortgage companies not covered by CRA 
make more than 50 percent of the home 
mortgages in our nation. If anything, the 
CRA should be strengthened to reflect 
changing demographics and changes in the 
financial industry, and not weaken the CRA 
as the proposed rule would do. We strongly 
encourage you to reconsider a proposed rule, 
and look to modernizing CRA that will truly 
benefit low and moderate income citizens.

CALIFORNIA REINVESTMENT COALITION, 
June 23, 2020. 
CRC AND CA GROUPS SUPPORT H.J. RES. 90 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI, The California Re-
investment Coalition (CRC) and our member 
organizations and allies write in strong sup-
port of H.J. Res. 90, the Congressional Re-
view Act Resolution to reverse the harmful 
rule recently finalized by the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) which 
would gut the Community Reinvestment Act 
(CRA). Please find following a letter from 
over sixty (60) California based and Cali-
fornia servicing organizations in support of 
the Resolution. 
The California Reinvestment Coalition 
builds an inclusive and fair economy that 
meets the needs of communities of color and 
low-income communities by ensuring that 
banks and other corporations invest and con-
duct business in our communities in a just 
and equitable manner. 
The CRA is a critical piece of civil rights 
legislation that has worked to fight historic 
and continuing redlining practices, and to 
bring much needed lending and investment 
into low-income communities of color. The 
CRA encourages banks to help meet local 
community credit needs by creating opportu-
nities for homeownership, small business 
ownership, job creation, financial capability, 
and affordable housing and community de-
velopment in neighborhoods that have been 
otherwise excluded from the financial main-
stream and the American dream. 
The OCC’s harmful rule will reverse these 
gains by substantially lowering the bar and 
enabling banks to get passing grades through 
activities that are further and further re-
moved from low-income communities, home-
owners, tenants and small businesses. The 
OCC takes this damaging action during a 
pandemic that has had a disproportionate 
impact on the very communities meant to 
benefit from CRA. 
We urge all members of Congress to co- 
sponsor and vote in favor of this important 
resolution. Defending civil rights and pro-
tecting communities ravaged by redlining 
and systemic racism has never been more 
important. 
Thank you for your concern regarding 
these issues and your consideration of our 
views.

THE LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE
AND 
NATIONAL
COMMUNITY
REINVEST-
MENT COALITION, 
June 23, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR SPEAKER PELOSI: We, the undersigned 
organizations, write to express our strong 
support for H.J. Res. 90, a Congressional Re-
view Act resolution of disapproval that will 
nullify a rulemaking by the Office of the 
Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) that, if 
allowed to stand, would drastically under-
mine one of our nation’s most important 
civil rights laws, the Community Reinvest-
ment Act of 1977 (the CRA). 
Enacted in 1977, the Community Reinvest-
ment Act (CRA) has been vital in fighting 
redlining, a practice that systematically— 
and for decades, as a matter of federal pol-
icy—shut neighborhoods of color and lower- 
income communities out from home loans 
and other essential financial services. The 
CRA requires banks to undertake reasonable 
efforts to lend to and invest in all of the 
neighborhoods in areas where they do busi-
ness. The law has helped to spur increased 
investments in formerly-redlined commu-
nities. It did not, however, prevent non-bank 
lenders (who are not subject to the CRA) 
from flooding communities of color with 
toxic subprime mortgages in the years before 
the 2008 crisis; and research shows that ra-
cial disparities in lending—which cannot be 
explained away by differences in credit 
scores—persist to this day. 
It is clear that the CRA needs to be mod-
ernized and strengthened in order to fulfill 
its original purpose. But in January, the 
OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Cor-
poration (FDIC) published a Notice of Pro-
posed Rulemaking (NPRM) that would in-
stead significantly weaken the CRA. The 
agencies proposed new overly simplistic 
metrics system that would make it far easier 
for banks to pass their CRA exams by mak-
ing large investments in communities where 
they can reap the largest rewards, rather 
than carefully-targeted, smaller investments 
in underserved consumers and neighbor-
hoods. 
Even before the NPRM was published, a 
wide range of stakeholders weighed in with 
both the OCC and FDIC to raise concerns and 
to ask for more data justifying the changes. 
Those concerns were not addressed, and the 
data was never released. By the time the 
NPRM was published, the United States and 
the world were just beginning to learn about 
the growing threat posed by a dangerous new 
respiratory virus. In the coming weeks, it be-
came clear that the virus had not been con-
tained, and it spread rapidly to multiple 
countries including the United States. As 
stakeholders and the public began devoting 
more and more resources and attention to 
the health, social, and economic fallout of 
the growing pandemic, and many urged the 
OCC and FDIC to temporarily suspend rule-
making not related to COVID–19, the agen-
cies continued plowing ahead, only agreeing 
to a one-month extension for comments. 
In the days before the deadline for com-
ments on the rule, it had become clear that 
COVID–19 was proving fatal to communities

of color—the very communities the CRA was 
intended to help—at a rate several times 
higher than the population at large; the U.S. 
Surgeon General warned the public to pre-
pare for ‘‘our 9/11 moment,’’ and models pre-
dicted 100,000 or more deaths in the United 
States alone. Only 41 days after the com-
ment period ended, and even though only a 
minority of commenters voiced support for 
the new framework, the OCC rushed through 
a final rule that left it largely intact. The 
FDIC, to its credit, declined to finalize its 
version of the rule at this time. 
In the weeks since the OCC finalized its 
rule, our nation has been facing a long-over-
due reckoning with our troubled legacy of 
racial and ethnic discrimination. While 
much of the conversation has rightly been 
focused on police brutality and the impact of 
over-policing in communities of color, this 
conversation is inexorably tied to the lasting 
economic, social, and legal legacy of red-
lining and other forms of racial discrimina-
tion. 
We will not succeed in addressing issues 
surrounding law enforcement in commu-
nities of color without also addressing dec-
ades of underinvestment in housing, employ-
ment, education, health care, transpor-
tation, and other factors that, to this day, 
have contributed to the longstanding dis-
parities that are once again coming to light. 
Now is certainly not the time to weaken the 
most important civil rights laws we have at 
our disposal to correct those disparities. 
As such, we urge Congress to support H.J. 
Res. 90, to overturn the OCC’s regulatory at-
tack on the Community Reinvestment Act. 
Thank you for your consideration.

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
U.S. Capitol, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR REPRESENTATIVE: The Center for Re-
sponsible Lending writes to express our 
strong support for H.J. Res. 90, a Congres-
sional Review Act resolution of disapproval 
that will invalidate the Office of the Comp-
troller of the Currency (OCC) final rule on 
the Community Reinvestment Act. 
The Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 
(CRA) was one in a series of landmark civil 
rights legislation and is a critical tool to 
help our nation work toward overcoming the 
legacy of redlining. Today’s racial wealth 
gap and lending disparities are in large part 
the result of decades of government policies 
and practices that enabled the redlining of 
communities of color for most of the 20th 
century. In the post-Depression era, federal 
policies that created housing opportunities 
for returning veterans and their families ex-
plicitly excluded people of color from the 
benefits of government-supported housing 
programs. Among these programs were pub-
lic housing, the Home Owners’ Loan Corpora-
tion 
(HOLC), 
and 
mortgage 
insurance 
through the Federal Housing Administration 
(FHA). Not only did this redlining segregate 
residential neighborhoods across the United 
States, but it granted whites the ability to 
build wealth through homeownership while 
denying equal opportunities for families of 
color to build similar home equity over the 
same period. The inequities that result from 
these discriminatory programs are part of 
the injustices that today’s people led pro-
tests are demanding are addressed. 
The CRA imposes continuing and affirma-
tive obligations on banks to help meet the 
credit needs of the local communities in 
which they are chartered and continues to be 
an important tool for fostering access to 
credit for these communities today. The law 
has urged banks to more actively lend in 
LMI areas; it has also played a key role in 
ensuring bank participation in community 
revitalization efforts across the country. 
Despite the importance of CRA and the 
community investment it has spurred, CRA 
rules must be strengthened. The CRA as ap-
plied has not done nearly enough to revi-
talize previously redlined areas and has not 
made a substantial dent in the lagging home-
ownership rate for people of color. The white 
homeownership rate is 73.7% while the rate 
is 44% and 48.9% for Black and Latino bor-
rowers respectively. Additionally, bank lend-
ing in LMI communities and communities of 
color has declined dramatically since the 
Great Recession. And existing disparities 
will be further perpetuated in the face of the 
COVID–19 global public health and economic 
crisis. 
Unfortunately, the OCC decided to act uni-
laterally—without the Federal Reserve and 
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation—to 
issue a structurally flawed final rule that 
weakens the CRA and will harm low- and 
moderate-communities and communities of 
color. Rather than postpone rulemaking to 
focus on the devastating economic crisis 
caused by the COVID–19 health pandemic, 
the OCC issued the rule a mere six weeks 
after the closing of the comment period on 
its proposed rule despite broad requests for 
delay from community groups, civil rights 
and consumer organizations, and industry. 
The OCC acknowledged in the preamble to 
the final rule that most of the comments dis-
agreed with the proposal’s approach. Yet, the 
OCC decided to side with the minority of 
comments in support of the proposed rule. 
The OCC’s rule will harm the communities 
most adversely affected by the current crisis, 
including many families that were hardest 
hit by the Great Recession and have yet to 
recover. 
The final rule imposes an overly simplistic 
evaluation measure that fails to ensure that 
local banking needs are met, and sanctions 
bank redlining. The rule overvalues the dol-
lar amount of CRA activities in comparison 
to the quality of such activities and allows 
banks to earn more credit for easier and 
larger investments in communities from 
which they can get the highest return. In-
deed, the rule permits banks to ignore 20% of 
their assessment areas and still pass, result-
ing in unchecked neighborhood disinvest-
ment and redlining. The rule also disincen-
tives investment in LMI neighborhoods and 
communities of color. It incentivizes activi-
ties and investments that do not ‘‘pri-
marily’’ benefit LMI communities, such as 
large-scale 
infrastructure 
projects. 
Esti-
mating such projects’ impact on LMI neigh-
borhoods is difficult and thus will likely di-
vest funds away from smaller scale, yet 
impactful community development activi-
ties. Furthermore, the rule reduces the im-
portance of retail lending and retail services, 
resulting in less lending and investments in 
communities that are already credit starved. 
The rule is opposite to the CRA’s statutory 
mission and will cause deep harm to commu-
nities. 
We urge support for H.J. Res. 90 to reverse 
the OCC’s regulatory attack on the Commu-
nity Reinvestment Act. Thank you for your 
consideration. 
Sincerely, 
CENTER FOR RESPONSIBLE LENDING. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to close by thanking Rep-
resentative MEEKS for his leadership on 
this issue. I appreciate the support we 
have received from our colleagues in 
this effort. 
Make no mistake, unchecked, the 
OCC’s final rule will harm low- income 
and minority communities that are 
disproportionately 
suffering 
during 
this COVID–19 crisis, and it will turn 
the Community Reinvestment Act into 
the community disinvestment act. 
In passing this Congressional Review 
Act resolution, we are not only nul-
lifying the OCC rule, but we are send-
ing two clear messages: regulators 
should be focused on protecting the 
economy from the pandemic and not on 
removing safeguards, and that after 
the pandemic, the OCC should go back 
to the drawing board and work with 
the Federal Reserve and FDIC to joint-
ly issue a new rule that strengthens 
the Community Reinvestment Act and 
helps low-and moderate-income com-
munities, including communities of 
color. 
For over a month now, by the thou-
sands, Americans have been marching 
in the streets for justice. They are 
standing up against racism and fight-
ing for justice for all. Just yesterday, 
this House passed historic legislation 
to reform our Nation’s police forces 
and the unfair treatment so many peo-
ple of color have experienced at the 
hands of those meant to serve and pro-
tect. 
As we unite to fight against discrimi-
nation in our criminal justice system, 
we must also fight against discrimina-
tion, disinvestment, and injustice in 
our financial system and economic in-
justice in our communities. The OCC’s 
rule would encourage disinvestment in 
communities of color and lead to red-
lining on a massive scale. We must 
stand up against this blatant effort to 
economically disenfranchise hundreds 
of low-income and minority commu-
nities nationwide. 
So I want to say to my Members on 
the opposite side of the aisle: I have 
heard this theme that you support the 
Community Reinvestment Act but you 
don’t support my bill. 
I would say to the Members: You 
can’t have it both ways. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote on H.J. Res. 90, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
submit the following letters to be included in 
the debate on H.J. Res. 90. The following let-
ters express support for H.J. Res. 90.

June 26, 2020 
90, a disapproval resolution that would over-
turn a poorly constructed rule change on the 
Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) hastily 
finalized in May, days before Comptroller 
Otting’s resignation from the agency, and 
published this month. 
At the outset, it is critical to note that the 
Trump Administration is split on the CRA 
final rule. With a lack of interagency coordi-
nation among the nation’s bank regulators, 
different banks will be held to different rein-
vestment standards depending on their regu-
lator—an outcome that both banks and advo-
cates have cautioned against. Federal Re-
serve Chairman Jerome Powell testified just 
last week that he expects the agency to 
move forward with CRA updates intended to 
garner ‘‘broad support among the commu-
nity of intended beneficiaries’’ something he 
considers to be ‘‘one non-negotiable condi-
tion for it.’’ The OCC’s final rule achieved no 
such support or consensus. The vast majority 
of public comments—about 90 percent—op-
posed the CRA evaluation measure and pre-
sumptive ratings framework that remains at 
the heart of the final rule, but the OCC 
adopted it anyway. 
The OCC’s final rule makes a series of 
changes to the CRA regulatory framework 
that reduce incentives for banks to lend to 
low-and-moderate income (LMI) families and 
invest and serve LMI communities: home 
buyers and homeowners, small businesses, 
community development projects that pri-
marily benefit and serve LMI people. It also 
expands the number of banks that will have 
no review of how they open and close bank 
branches and provide key bank services in 
LMI and underserved neighborhoods. 
These harmful changes could not come at a 
worse time. The ongoing COVID–19 pandemic 
and widespread social unrest that is gripping 
the nation has hit LMI and communities of 
color the hardest and brought gapping dis-
parities to the forefront. The changes to the 
CRA being pushed through by the OCC would 
do little to address the pressing national pri-
orities of reducing the racial wealth gap, of 
better serving those traditionally under-
served by the nation’s financial system or 
stimulating an economic recovery from 
COVID–19 that is equitable. While the OCC 
claims its aim is to increase CRA activity, 
the lack of interagency agreement among 
this 
Administration’s 
regulators 
should 
serve as a dire warning about that claim. We 
do not yet know the full impact of COVID–19 
on local mortgage markets, small business 
resiliency, or how LMI households, neighbor-
hoods, local jobs, and key sectors will re-
cover. Weakening CRA at this moment is a 
blueprint for a crisis after the crisis. 
For all these reasons and more, we urge 
you to cosponsor H.J. Res. 90 and support it 
when it is considered on the House floor.

threat to our recovery from the COVID–19 re-
cession and undercuts the purpose and intent 
of CRA, harming underserved communities 
throughout the nation. 
As NHC stated in its formal comment let-
ter on the CRA NPR on April 8, we have no 
idea how severely the pandemic will impact 
our economy, the financial system and com-
munities throughout the nation. Committing 
resources to regulatory initiatives that do 
not directly support our national response to 
the COVID–19 pandemic is a dangerous dis-
traction: On April 27, NHC joined 14 other 
major national organizations, including the 
National Association of REALTORS and the 
National League of Cities, to urge regulators 
to refrain from committing resources to reg-
ulatory initiatives that do not directly sup-
port our national response to the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Notably, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve 
Board refused to join the OCC on this ill- 
timed decision. As FDIC Chairman Jelena 
McWilliams noted in her March 19, 2020 let-
ter to the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board, 
financial 
institutions 
‘‘will 
face 
unique difficulties over the coming weeks 
and months to adequately staff customer- 
facing functions; ensure that deposit, loan, 
and IT systems operate normally; help bor-
rowers that are experiencing unanticipated 
cash flow difficulties; and address the earn-
ings and capital implications of near zero 
percent interest rates and a potential surge 
in borrowers who are unable to meet con-
tractual payment terms.’’ We could not 
agree more. 
CRA modernization is a once-in-a-genera-
tion opportunity. There is much to improve, 
as the law and most recent regulations were 
written before the proliferation of interstate 
banking, internet banking and the revital-
ization of America’s cities; the latter being 
the opposite trend of one of the two major 
reasons for CRA’s adoption—urban disinvest-
ment—as well as the stubborn persistence of 
redlining and its legacy impact. Instead, the 
OCC has pursued an entirely new system 
that will gut CRA’s effectiveness for years 
and undercut broader efforts to address the 
very issues that Congress attempted to solve 
in 1977, and still struggles with today. 
The OCC’s rule has received nearly uni-
versal condemnation. Using its ratio-driven 
approach, banks will be powerfully incented 
to make only the largest investments in 
communities that need it the least, and may 
also fuel the displacement of those people 
who need it the most. This rule eliminates 
the fundamental value of CRA, which at its 
best, levels the playing field between large, 
highly profitable investments, and the hard-
er and smaller but still profitable deals that 
often have disproportionately positive im-
pact on communities; and are by their na-
ture, harder to get an allocation of capital 
from a bank that we want to be governed by 
a culture that focuses on a risk-weighted re-
turn. 
CRA modernization is long overdue and 
needs to be done so banks and communities 
get the clarity and flexibility they need to 
ensure it has the maximum positive impact. 
But no modernization effort is worth gutting 
the central purpose of CRA—constructive re-
investment in the communities that need it 
most. Consequently, the National Housing 
Conference strongly supports H.J. Res. 90 
and hope that once this unprecedented na-
tional crisis is behind us, we can all work to-
gether to fully realize the purpose and intent 
of CRA. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID M. DWORKIN, 
President and CEO. 
HOPE, 
June 23, 2020. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House, 
House of Representatives. 
SUPPORT FOR H.J. RES. 90 
HOPE (Hope Enterprise Corporation/Hope 
Credit Union/Hope Policy Institute) supposes 
H.J Res. 90, providing for congressional dis-
approval of the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency’s (OCC) final rule overhauling 
the Community Reinvestment Act. 
HOPE is a Black-led, women-owned com-
munity development financial institution, 
credit union, and policy institute in Jack-
son, Mississippi. HOPE was established 25 
years ago to ensure that all people regardless 
of where they live, their gender, race or 
place of birth have the opportunity to sup-
port their families and realize the American 
Dream. HOPE has generated over $2.5 billion 
in financing that has benefitted more than 
1.5 million people throughout Alabama, Ar-
kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Ten-
nessee. 
The Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) 
has been a critical tool for HOPE to leverage 
the resources it needs to serve low-income 
communities, rural communities, and com-
munities of color in the Deep South. Unfor-
tunately, the OCC’s final rule moves the 
CRA—and economic opportunity for our 
communities—further out of reach in three 
ways: 
Incenting larger, easier activities, poten-
tially reducing the smaller, more intensive 
investments that Deep South communities 
so often need, 
Deprioritizing meaningful CRA activities 
in the country’s most distressed commu-
nities, and 
Diverting investments to activities far 
from the CRA’s original intent of redressing 
redlining. 
As just one example, the OCC’s failure to 
prioritize bank branches in low-income and 
rural areas will be acutely felt in the Deep 
South, where already much of the region is 
already in a banking desert and includes 
areas with the highest percentage of persons 
who are unbanked in the United States. Mis-
sissippi and Louisiana, with over 15% of 
unbanked residents, have the highest per-
centage among all states. The rate of 
unbanked Black households is even higher, 
at 28% both states. As made plain during 
COVID–19, these disparities in access to 
banking relationships lay the foundation for 
broader disparities in access to capital for 
small businesses and individuals. 
Ultimately, the OCC’s final rule widens the 
wealth gap and further inhibits economic op-
portunity in already hard-pressed areas of 
the country, particularly here in the Deep 
South. 
NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF COMMUNITY 
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIA-
TIONS, 
June 23, 2020. 
REPRESENTATIVE MAXINE WATERS, 
Chairwoman, House Financial Services Com-
mittee, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRWOMAN WATERS: Thank you for 
leading and actively supporting H.J. Res. 90, 
a disapproval resolution to overturn the 
Community Reinvestment Act rule change 
finalized by the Office of the Comptroller of 
the Currency (OCC) in May 2020. The Na-
tional Alliance of Community Economic De-
velopment Associations (NACEDA) and our 
members find the OCC’s final rule deeply 
problematic for low and moderate-income 
communities for the reasons outlined in our 
public comment letter dated April, 8, 2020. 
The final rule addresses very few of the 
concerns we expressed in our April letter. 
The final rule is deeply problematic and fun-
damentally flawed. 
To paraphrase FDIC Board Member Martin 
Gruenberg’s statement on December 12, 2019, 
in opposition to the proposed rule, the pro-
posed rule severely undermines what has 
been a core strength of CRA for 40 years—the 
encouragement of bank engagement and dia-
logue with stakeholders in local commu-
nities, including community-based organiza-
tions, community development corporations, 
and others, to understand and better serve 
historically underserved areas. For this rea-
son and more, we support your committee’s 
Congressional Review Act resolution to over-
turn the rule change. 
Sincerely, 
FRANK WOODRUFF, 
Executive 
Director,

HONORING THE LIFE OF MARNY 
XIONG 
(Ms. MCCOLLUM asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. MCCOLLUM. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Marny 
Xiong, the chairwoman of the Saint 
Paul Public Schools Board of Edu-
cation, who passed away from COVID– 
19 on June 7 at the age of 31. We mourn 
the loss of this young woman, a rising 
star whose legacy was an inspiration to 
us all. 
Marny was a trailblazing activist and 
a proud member of Saint Paul’s Hmong 
community. She was a dedicated advo-
cate for young people, and she stood up 
for equality and racial justice. She un-
derstood the disparities that students 
of color face in our State, and she 
worked to make sure that every child 
had an opportunity to succeed. 
As chairwoman of the board, her 
leadership was critical to successfully 
resolving the district’s first ever teach-
ers’ strike. When confronted with the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Marny helped to 
steer the district’s unprecedented tran-
sition to distance learning for 37,000 
students.

ents, her seven siblings, her extended 
family, and her friends at this time of 
great grief.

POLICING IS STATE AND LOCAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
(Mr. ARRINGTON asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
the vast majority of law enforcement 
across the country are good. They are 
competent. They are professional. And 
they serve with integrity. And when 
they don’t, with the immense power 
they have over their fellow citizens, 
they must be held accountable, but 
that starts at the local level. 
Policing is a State and local respon-
sibility, not a Federal responsibility. 
When local leaders fail to do their job 
and citizens fail to hold them account-
able, the system breaks down. You 
have incidences of abuse and, some-
times, cultures of corruption. 
So what is the solution? It is not an-
other top-down, one-size-fits-all from 
Washington, D.C. 
We don’t need to Federalize policing. 
We need to hold our local leaders ac-
countable. We need to come alongside 
of them at all levels of government to 
make sure that we don’t recycle the 
bad actors. So we get rid of them. And 
if we do, then the 1 percent won’t take 
the 99 percent that are protecting and 
serving us and risking their lives to do 
so.

IN MEMORY OF DR. JAMES HENRY 
NEELY 
(Mr. KELLY of Mississippi asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 
life of Dr. James Henry Neely, who 
passed away on Monday, June 22, in Ox-
ford, Mississippi. 
Dr. Neely was born August 8, 1932, in 
West Point, Mississippi. His many ac-
complishments began at Mary Holmes 
College High School. He was the editor 
of the school newspaper, secretary of 
the senior class, president of the ath-
letic club, and member at large of the 
student council. He took his successes 
to Kentucky State University, earning 
a degree in chemistry and a minor in 
math and French. 
His passion for chemistry and aca-
demia led Dr. Neely to Meharry Med-
ical College in 1960. After graduation, 
he took his leadership skills to the 
United States Air Force, where he 
served honorably until his discharge in 
1964, and he relocated in Tupelo, Mis-
sissippi. He served his community as a 
medical practitioner for 35 years. He 
was the first African American doctor 
to have hospital privileges, admitting 
privileges, and could treat patients at 
North Mississippi Medical Center. 
He would go on to earn the Mis-
sissippi Medical Surgical Award, Prac-
titioner of the Year, and Meharry Med-
ical 
College 
Distinguished 
Service 
Award. Dr. Neely, though, will tell you 
his greatest accomplishment was his 
marriage to Elaine Kilgore for 66 years. 
Outside of the medical profession, Dr. 
Neely held many memberships, includ-
ing the National Medical Association, 
the Black Business Association of Mis-
sissippi, the NAACP, and was a mem-
ber of the West Point Trinity United 
Presbyterian Church. He was not only 
a prominent figure in the medical field, 
but in the community in which he 
served. 
Left to cherish his memory is his 
wife, Elaine; his son, my friend and 
mentor and an assistant district attor-
ney in my office, Brian Neely; his 
daughter, acclaimed poet and Goodwill 
Ambassador for the State of Mis-
sissippi, Patricia Neely-Dorsey; his 
four grandchildren, and many others. 
Dr. Neely led a life we should all ad-
mire. He affected change in Mississippi 
and this Nation by his life of public 
service.

IN HONOR OF MONSIGNOR J. GAS-
TON HEBERT’S 60TH ORDINATION 
(Mr. HILL of Arkansas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. 
HILL 
of 
Arkansas. 
Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Mon-
signor J. Gaston Hebert’s 60th ordina-
tion as a priest as well as to salute his 
lasting contributions to our Catholic 
diocese in Arkansas. 
He was baptized and received his 
First Communion at St. Mary Church 
in Hot Springs, where he also cele-
brated his first mass as an ordained 
priest in 1960. 
I was privileged to have Monsignor 
Hebert as my teacher at Catholic High 
School in Little Rock, where he served 
as an English and drama teacher from 
1960 to 1965. 
Even after he retired from serving as 
the pastor of Christ the King Church in 
Little Rock for 20 years, he continued 
to serve the diocese in Arkansas as 
vicar general under Bishop Andrew 
McDonald and Archbishop J. Peter 
Sartain. And again, importantly, as 
our diocesan administrator from 2006 
to 2008, prior to the Holy Father’s ap-
pointment of Bishop Anthony Taylor. 
Monsignor Hebert has served our 
community faithfully, and I thank him 
for his love, dedication, and years of 
service. 
Madam Speaker, we miss seeing him 
and are forever grateful.

REMEMBERING DEPUTY JAMES 
BLAIR 
(Mr. GUEST asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. GUEST. Madam Speaker, last 
week, we were reminded once again of 
the great sacrifice made by the men 
and women of law enforcement as fam-
ily, friends, and fellow officers gath-
ered to pay their respects to Deputy 
James Blair, who lost his life in the 
line of duty on Friday, June 12 in 
Simpson County, Mississippi. 
Deputy Blair was a husband, a father, 
a grandfather, and a great-grandfather, 
who devoted his life to his family, his 
community, and to law enforcement. 
He was a generous man who was deeply 
loved and worked to support his grand-
children following the passing of their 
mother. 
Deputy Blair spent over 50 years of 
his life in service to his fellow man 
through law enforcement. He will be 
deeply missed by our Mississippi fam-
ily, but his selfless spirit will live on 
through the memory of his sacrifice 
and through those who had the privi-
lege of knowing him during his time on 
this Earth. 
Please join me in a moment of si-
lence in remembrance of Deputy James 
Blair.

DESECRATION OF MONUMENTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, you 
would have to be living in a hole some-
where to not have noticed that across 
the Nation, the desecration happening 
to our national monuments, statues, 
memorials, and even the vandalization 
of some of our large cities has been 
running rampant. 
It is time for that to end. In many 
cases, these acts of vandalism are tar-
geted towards longtime institutions of 
those that tirelessly fought for our 
freedoms. This desecration must end. 
And there must be severe penalties for 
doing these felonious acts. 
We have seen George Washington 
statues, the Father of our country, who 
valued freedom above all else, knocked 
down. Ulysses S. Grant, the Com-
manding General of the Union Army, 
who helped stop the slavery effort of 
the South, who signed the Civil Rights 
Act of 1875 and the ratification of the 
15th Amendment, was toppled in San 
Francisco. Abraham Lincoln, who freed 
so many from slavery. Even down the 
street from here, they are having to 
guard the Mary McLeod Bethune stat-
ues down there at Lincoln Park, along 
with Mr. Lincoln. And she was a key 
element of FDR’s original Federal 
Council of Negro Affairs, otherwise 
known as the ‘‘Black Cabinet.’’ 
There is not even any logic or sense 
to the vandalism and chaos that is 
going on here when they are tearing 
down statues on all sides of the issue. 
It needs to be stopped, and there needs 
to be harsh penalties for those doing 
this.

IN RECOGNITION OF SID MARTIN 
BIOTECH UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA 
(Mr. YOHO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Sid Martin Biotech 
at the University of Florida for win-
ning the Randall M. Whaley Incubator 
of the Year Award, the top award given 
by the International Business Innova-
tion Association. 
This marks the third time in the last 
10 years that Sid Martin Biotech has 
been recognized as the top incubator in 
the world. Even more, Sid Martin 
Biotech is the only program in the 
world to win more than one Randall M. 
Whaley award. This is a tremendous 
feat, and I am proud that this program 
is located in North Central Florida in 
Florida’s Third Congressional District. 
Sid Martin Biotech has incubated 106 
startups since its first opening. These 
companies have raised over $8.8 billion 
in funding and created over 8,000 high- 
tech jobs. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the 
entire team at Sid Martin Biotech for 
this great accomplishment, and I am 
confident that this success will con-
tinue in the future.

UNITE AMERICA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEAN). Under the Speaker’s announced 
policy of January 3, 2019, the gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. BIGGS) is rec-
ognized for 60 minutes as the designee 
of the minority leader. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. 
SHIMKUS). 
IN MEMORY OF MARY ELLEN WITTER 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague for the time and 
courtesy. 
Madam Speaker, I rise to speak 
about my West Point mom, who just 
recently passed away. Mary Ellen 
Witter of Bluffton, South Carolina, 
passed away peacefully Sunday, June 
21, 2020, with her family around her. 
My West Point mom, who loved me 
even though I ate her food, broke her 
chairs, and disobeyed a rule now and 
then. She was the definition of grace. 
She was preceded in death by her 
husband, the love of her life, Colonel 
Lee Witter. They were married 61 
years. She was the daughter of the late 
Allan and Alma Imse, born in Mil-
waukee, Wisconsin in 1937. 
Mary Ellen went to the University of 
Wisconsin, Milwaukee, for her bach-
elor’s degree in Elementary Education. 
She received her masters from C.W. 
Post Center, Long Island University, 
New York, in Library Science. 
She was a dedicated military wife. 
She represented America while being 
an embassy military wife in Indonesia. 
She was a longtime educator, both here 
and abroad. 
Mary Ellen was a pianist, singer, and 
a devout Christian, who was very ac-
tive in her church and was part of the 
Stephen Ministries and prayer groups. 
For those who knew her, she was a 
soft-spoken woman who loved trav-
eling, reading, gardening, camping, 
bird-watching, and going to the beach. 
But most of all, she loved her family 
and her friends. 
She was preceded in death by her son, 
Mathew. She is survived by her two 
daughters, Nanette Jordan of Norwalk, 
Connecticut, and Dorinda Selby of 
Beaufort, South Carolina. She is sur-
vived by her sister, Sharon Quade of 
Crandon, Wisconsin, and her brother, 
Robert Imse of Naples, Florida. She 
dearly loved her five grandchildren: 
Ashley Benusa of Hong Kong; Taylor 
Jordan 
of 
Boston, 
Massachusetts; 
Zachary Jordan of Waterbury, Con-
necticut; Senior Airman Mathew Selby 
of Davis Monthan Air Force Base, Tuc-
son, Arizona; and Thomas Selby of 
Beaufort, South Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to at-
tending the burial service, which will 
take place at West Point Military 
Academy National Cemetery at a later 
date. There, she will be laid next to her 
husband, Colonel Witter, and her son, 
Mathew. 
First Thessalonians 4:14 states: ‘‘For 
we believe that Jesus died and rose 
again and so we believe that God will 
bring with Jesus those who have fallen 
asleep in him.’’ May we find comfort in 
this promise. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his words and ex-
press condolences for his loss of his 
dear friend. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tlewoman from Arizona (Mrs. LESKO), 
my colleague and longtime friend. 
Mrs. LESKO. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS) for yielding me the time. 
Lawlessness has broken out across 
our Nation. It is absolutely outrageous, 
and it has to be stopped. Mobs are tak-
ing over parts of the city of Seattle. 
They took over a police precinct. 
Just last Saturday, people were shot, 
and one man was killed. Criminals are 
looting stores and businesses all over 
the Nation, including in Arizona in the 
upscale Scottsdale Fashion Square. 
Protestors are throwing bricks at po-
lice officers. They are throwing water 
bottles at police officers. And I have 
seen them shine flashlights right up 
close into the police officers’ eyes and 
call them all kinds of names. Rioters 
are burning the flag, the American 
flag. And the Lincoln Memorial and 
World War II Memorial have been de-
faced. 
Madam Speaker, a few days ago, St. 
Serra, the patron saint of peace, was 
torn down in San Francisco. 
Francis Scott Key’s statue was torn 
down. 
The statue of Ulysses Grant, who was 
the general for the Union was torn 
down by thugs in San Francisco. 
b 1730 
And then we saw the other night how 
they were trying so hard, these crimi-
nals, to tear down the statue in Lafay-
ette Park. And they almost had it torn 
down, if it wasn’t for the Trump ad-
ministration sending in the National 
Guard to stop. 
And do you know what they wrote 
and spray-painted on that statue, that 
Federal statue? ‘‘Killer scum.’’ 
Does any of this show tribute to 
George Floyd? No. 
Does any of this help? Absolutely 
not. 
Now, I was really surprised to see 
that one of our colleagues, Congress-
woman NORTON, who is a nonvoting 
Member but represents Washington, 
D.C., has introduced legislation to have 
a statue of Abraham Lincoln taken 
down, a statue that was funded by the 
freed slaves. 
What has our country come to? We 
need to return to a semblance of civil-
ity in our country. And so that is why 
I call on Democrat-run cities to clamp 
down on these criminals. No more au-
tonomous zones. No more looting. No 
more destructing statues. Let’s bring 
back law and order. 
That is why I stand with President 
Trump and his calls to arrest and pros-
ecute criminals. Let’s stop the lawless-
ness. Let’s try to heal our country. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman, and I appreciate her 
comments. 
We do see an increase in the amount 
of lawlessness. We have moved from 
peaceful protests, which I support, I 
understand. That is what the guarantee 
of the First Amendment is for. We all 
get a right to assemble with whom we 
want to assemble with. We get a right 
to speak. We get a right to seek redress 
of grievances from the government. All 
of those are important rights that we 
support, we stand for. 
But we move into rioting, looting, 
mayhem. 
There 
has 
been 
murder. 
There has been assaults. There has 
been brutal violence. 
I have heard some of my colleagues 
in this body call those protests. It is 
not protesting. That is lawless rioting, 
and it needs to be curbed and checked. 
I yield to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. 
BISHOP 
of 
North 
Carolina. 
Madam Speaker, the coronavirus pan-
demic reminded us that we are in this 
together. Despite serious and, as yet, 
unresolved ongoing questions about 
policy responses to that event, we have 
stayed home and sacrificed for our 
neighbors’ health. We have seen the 
best of us. 
But in the past month, we are seeing 
the worst of us: violent mobs stoning 
business owners, Federal agents shot to 
death, looting occurring nationwide, 
and avowed Marxist activists openly 
defending and promoting it, six blocks 
of a major U.S. city ceded to anar-
chists. 
I don’t recognize this America. Peo-

wanton destruction of their liveli-
hoods, their cities on fire or being can-
celed by social media mobs; govern-
ment buildings attacked; monuments 
and memorials spanning the breadth of 
our history, from Washington to Lin-
coln to Roosevelt, torn down or threat-
ened by riotous mobs. 
And this is not impassioned, heat-of- 
the-moment destruction. It is a tar-
geted, organized, and methodical purge 
of figures who represent ideas they 
wish to bury, ideas such as all people 
are endowed by our creator with in-
alienable rights to life, liberty, and 
property, and that government by, for, 
and of the people shall not perish from 
the Earth. 
We have seen this deliberate tactic 
throughout history, in communist Chi-
na’s cultural revolution, in the theo-
cratic purge of Afghanistan’s Taliban, 
even in the terror campaigns of the Re-
construction and Jim Crow South. 
What distinguishes America is how 
this Nation responds to such lawless 
and purposeful attacks. We hold, it is 
declared, that government’s very pur-
pose is to secure the inalienable rights 
of all of us and that, when order falls 
apart, so, too, does our Nation. 
What we have seen in recent weeks 
begs the question: How is government 
serving its core purpose? 
Local and State officials have flouted 
that purpose, abandoned that responsi-
bility. But in those circumstances, the 
Federal Government has the tools to 
secure the rights of the people. 
Attorney General Barr, chapter 13 of 
the United States Criminal Code, pro-
vides all the authority you may need. 
FBI Director Wray, the evidence of 
criminal conspiracies is in plain sight. 
The Department of Justice and the 
FBI must act without delay. This gov-
ernment must restore the America we 
know. 
Word is the Department of Justice is 
leading over 500 investigations, and 
that is good news. We are counting on 
them, and we know they are up to the 
task. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from North Carolina for 
his comments, and I echo his sentiment 
that what needs to happen to restore 
order here is one must arrest malefac-
tors who are committing crimes. We 
must then charge them and prosecute 
them and give them due process. But 
without a restoration of order, no one 
in this country has freedom. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WEBER). 
Mr. WEBER of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, some history from our country. 
Yesterday was June 25. On June 25, 
1788, the State of Virginia ratified the 
U.S. Constitution and thereby became 
the 10th State of the United States. 
Virginia willingly joined the Union. 
Virginia willingly left the Union and 
then willingly eventually rejoined the 
Union, a reminder from our past. Do we 
take down everything about Virginia? 
Certainly not. 
Madam Speaker, on June 25, 1868, 
Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Georgia, 
North Carolina, and South Carolina 
were readmitted to the Union. Again, 
they had willingly joined the Union; 
they willingly left the Union; and, yes, 
they 
willingly 
rejoined 
that 
same 
Union. Reminders from the past. Do we 
do away with all reminders? 
On May 18, 1896, the Supreme Court 
in Plessy v. Ferguson upheld the con-
stitutionality of racial segregation for 
public facilities as long as they were 
separate but equal. In 1962, the Su-
preme Court ruled that the use of unof-
ficial 
nondenominational 
prayer 
in 
public schools was unconstitutional. 
They got it wrong twice, just two ex-
amples. Do we do away with any men-
tion of the Supreme Court? 
Madam Speaker, in 1973, June 25, 
again, yesterday, John Dean, White 
House Counsel for President Richard 
Nixon, admitted that President Nixon 
was involved in the coverup. Do we do 
away with all mention of President 
Nixon? 
Madam Speaker, how about Presi-
dent Bill Clinton, who was accused of 
several sexual harassments and was 
found guilty of lying under oath and, 
as I recall, tampering with a witness or 
obstruction of justice? Are all men-
tions of President Clinton gone? No, 
not him, not Nixon. They were Presi-
dents of this United States. 
Madam Speaker, in 1999, on June 25, 
Germany’s Parliament approved a na-
tional Holocaust memorial to be built 
in Berlin, a painful but necessary re-
minder from the past. 
And we could go on. We could talk 
about professional entertainers—and I 
use the word ‘‘professional’’ loosely— 
who have been accused. And the list is 
Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein, and on 
down. You go right down that list. Do 
we demand any and all of their works, 
their mentions, their movies, their 
shows be blotted out from memory? 
We could talk about professional ath-
letes—and again, I use the word ‘‘pro-
fessional’’ loosely—who have been ac-
cused of sexual assault, beating their 
wives up, their girlfriends up, caught 
with 
drugs, 
performance-enhancing 
drugs, gambling, cheating. Do we blot 
them out from all memory and all 
mentions? No. 
Madam Speaker, even churches—the 
Catholic Church, the Baptist Church, 
the Methodists, other churches, other 
denominations—scandals, military sex 
scandals, Boy Scouts, congressional sex 
scandals, every occupation, every race, 
color, creed, and religion, none is per-
fect. Where does it end? 
Should we pull down and attempt to 
erase all mentions of countries like 
Japan, Germany, France, Spain, Italy, 
China? The list is endless. 
Madam Speaker, George Floyd had a 
criminal record, but he did not deserve 
execution at the hands of an errant po-
lice officer. And then again, those 
whose lives and/or their livelihoods are 
being destroyed by vandals, looters, 
and rioters don’t deserve to have their 
families and their livelihoods and their 
lives ruined either. 
It is time for the violence to stop. 
Peaceful protests, yes; violence, no. 
The 
Governors 
and 
the 
President 
should send in troops when requested 
and needed. I stand with the President 
in that. 
These criminals and lawbreakers de-
serve to be dealt with in a manner con-
sistent with their behavior and the 
law. They are pulling down statues 
that were paid for with tax dollars, 
erected with the consent of the gov-
erned, no matter what community or 
timeframe. These thugs simply think 
they can tear them down. 
Do we acknowledge there are those 
who have an improper mindset? Of 
course. Those are thugs tearing things 
down. Of course we do. 
Do we also acknowledge that Black 
lives matter? You bet we do. I cannot 
even begin to understand the fear of 
parents and their children who live in 
that fear that some day they may suf-
fer that same fate. 
But let’s have that conversation 
within the framework of a civilized 
people who earnestly desire what Presi-
dent Lincoln called ‘‘a more perfect 
Union.’’ 
Violence, property destruction, van-
dalism, arson, looting, and, yes, killing 
others is hardly what I think we would 
want or call a more perfect Union, 
Madam Speaker. 
So how about a new reset? Looking 
backwards will only leave us hating ev-
eryone and everything. Statues and 
symbols of our great country should re-
mind us how far we have come, but, 
more importantly, how far we have got 
to go still. 
We should be taking pride in how far 
we have come. Actually, let us hope in 
the promises of where we can go, while 
being saddened as to some of the things 
that have had to happen to get us to 
this point. 
Madam Speaker, how about a reset? 
b 1745 
George Orwell once said: 
The most effective way to destroy people is 
to deny and obliterate their own under-
standing of their history. 
Madam Speaker, as we reassess our 
shared experience, let us learn from the 
past in order to make a better, brighter 
future. America’s history is imperfect. 
But projecting contemporary norms 
through violence while rejecting the 
experiences of our past does a dis-
service to the sacrifices of the great 
men and women like President Lin-
coln, who fought for equality for all. 
We must not erase our history. We 
must learn from it. This is one of the 
promises and the highest callings of 
America the beautiful. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his comments, par-
ticularly relating to history. I am re-
minded, as I was pondering that, that 
each of us has a history. Each of us has 
a personal history. None of us are per-
fect. Sometimes, we have flaws that 
seem almost insurmountable in our 
own lives. But if we deny our history,

then we deny who we are and who we 
can become. 
When I hear folks out there attack-
ing our history and saying, let’s bring 
down this statue or let’s do this or let’s 
do that, some of it is so acontextual. 
By that, I mean it is as if there was no 
history to learn from. And I think, how 
in the world can we be so narcissistic 
that we don’t accept the flaws of our 
own past and build upon the promise of 
the future? 
We have problems, for sure, but it 
does not inure to lawlessness, rioting, 
murder, and mayhem. It should, in-
stead, inure to the better angels within 
us. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
yield to the gentleman from California 
(Mr. LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
appreciate my colleague from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS) for leading this tonight and 
for what he has been standing up for. 
I just have to say that I am really 
grieved by the strife we have in this 
country, especially trying to exit out 
of this Wuhan virus situation and the 
horrific things we saw happening in 
Minneapolis. That was the moment 
when we saw George Floyd being 
abused and ultimately killed by that. 
There was unity among 99.9 percent 
of the population of the people in this 
country saying that is wrong. We had a 
moment to learn from that, to build 
upon that. 
Indeed, it seemed to be a short mo-
ment. Peaceful protests immediately 
followed. We agree with those. And 
then that has been co-opted by these 
forces coming out of the ground that 
have been looking for an opportunity 
to divide us, divide our Nation, wheth-
er it is antifa or other groups that are 
forming and now seeking political 
power with this. It is now beyond rac-
ism. It is something completely dif-
ferent. 
The violence that we are seeing, the 
mayhem, the destruction, the van-
dalism has nothing to do with the good 
conversation we should have been hav-
ing in that spirit of unity that I think 
most Americans felt in that window of 
time right after the George Floyd kill-
ing. 
How are we going to come out of 
this? How are we going to have a good 
conversation about how we can im-
prove things with law enforcement but 
not impugn law enforcement for what 
they are doing? They are out there 
every day trying to find the balance be-
tween how to defend the public, how to 
defend their own life when they knock 
on a door or walk up to a car—they 
don’t know what is going on inside 
there—and also being a good ambas-
sador for somebody who they just need 
to talk to. 
How are we going to find this balance 
again amidst all of this mayhem, 
amidst all of this violence? Well, cer-
tainly, the signal needs to be sent that 
we are not going to tolerate the vio-
lence, the mayhem, the destruction, 
the vandalism. Severe penalties need 
to be coming down upon those who we 
already have on camera or other ways 
to identify in anything going forward. 
I just came from Lincoln Park about 
10 blocks east of here, and they have to 
put fencing and have guards out there 
for the statue of Abraham Lincoln, who 
is shown there putting a hand up for a 
slave depicted in that statue, an eman-
cipated slave. He is still wearing the 
chains. He is looking up at Mr. Lin-
coln, who is lifting him and going to 
take him to a better place. 
Yet, that is being misinterpreted in 
2020 as something that is hateful. That 
same statue was paid for by emanci-
pated slaves back then who were in-
spired by what Mr. Lincoln had done. 
They even have a fence around Mary 
McLeod Bethune right next-door be-
cause they are afraid that might get 
vandalized because there is indiscrimi-
nate vandalism happening to any stat-
ue, to any memorial, to any monument 
just because it is a mayhem out there. 
That doesn’t even make sense. It is 
not even logical that you would tear 
down the ones, General Grant or who-
ever, who were actually in the fight to 
end slavery. We are not going to have 
a very good conversation about racism 
when frauds like this go on. 
Even something so simple or silly as 
a garage at a raceway here a while 
back where somebody said it was a 
noose in the garage, and the media ran 
with it immediately without taking at 
least 12 hours to check out and find out 
that it was a pull handle for shutting a 
garage door. In no way does it meet the 
specifications for a noose. Unfortu-
nately, the driver doubled down on 
that and continued in interviews say-
ing definitely a noose. 
That doesn’t do anything to bring the 
harmony we should be having, espe-
cially when that driver was shown an 
incredible amount of harmony by his 
colleagues there when first that inci-
dent was reported. 
Where are we going with all of this? 
I grieve for our country, the one that 
had imperfect roots but always has 
strived to build upon itself to do bet-
ter, to improve. 
Slavery came in with the country, 
but the Founders knew it wasn’t right. 
There were compromises made to at 
least form this country to be some-
thing better than the monarchy that 
England had, compromises but still 
building until finally in the 1860s when 
Mr. Lincoln came and said enough. You 
had more than half the country that 
was already ready to do that. 
We don’t get a lot of talk about that 
because you think the whole country 
was racist. Most of the country was 
not. It was eradicated. Then we had the 
13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to 
grant rights to those who originally 
did not have them. The Civil Rights 
Act of the 1960s continued on that path, 
the Voting Rights Act. 
Yet, all we hear around here is, Re-
publicans are against all that, when 
you find out that, actually, Repub-
licans were leading in greater numbers 
on all of those things all the way back 
at that time. Now, Democrats are try-
ing to co-opt that and turn it into 
something else completely. Indeed, the 
first 20 Members of Congress who were 
Black were also Republican because 
they saw who was really trying to lead 
them toward freedom. 
What we have going on right now is 
not going to keep this great country in 
a place that is free. We have lost a lot 
of freedom already by the virus, first— 
something we have to handle—but also 
the 
freedom 
to 
actually 
assemble 
downtown in a large city or to go visit 
a statue or do anything. 
Our freedoms are being eroded. Our 
freedoms are being eroded by roving 
bands of people who—mayors in large 
cities, Democrat mayors, and some 
Democrat 
Governors 
that 
govern 
States aren’t doing anything about it. 
What are we supposed to do? Stand 
and watch what is going on here? No, 
we are not going to watch this any-
more. We are not going to put up with 
it. Severe penalties need to be had for 
these people inflicting this mayhem 
upon their own Nation, upon their own 
neighbors, 
upon 
neighborhoods. 
It 
needs to be harsh. 
Then, once we can get the violence 
stopped, maybe we can get back to the 
table and have a real conversation 
about how we are going to improve the 
situations with race. 
It grieves me that young Black males 
feel like they are going to be victim-
ized 
by 
the 
term 
‘‘driving 
while 
Black.’’ That is an awful feeling for 
them and for us, I think, to see that 
happen. 
Our great colleague over on the other 
side, Senator TIM
SCOTT, when he 
brought forth a bill he has been work-
ing on very hard for a long time, look-
ing for bipartisan efforts, his JUSTICE 
Act, and then someone tells him it is a 
token effort. 
What the heck does that mean? That 
really struck him deeply, that people 
would say that about that and not even 
give him the opportunity to have that 
bill developed further in the Senate. 
What a shameful moment that was. 
Yet, now we have legislation here 
that is trying to eviscerate the ability 
of cops to operate how they need to, to 
have a little bit of immunity because a 
cop doesn’t know what he is walking 
into or what she is walking into. They 
need a little latitude, not the latitude 
we saw in Minneapolis, but one to sim-
ply operate. 
Doctors need latitude in order to 
work on patients and not be sued to 
death. Yet, we have this legislation 
that is going to be, basically, sue a cop. 
That is not going to help anything. 
What is that going to do for morale 
for keeping cops on the force, for re-
cruiting new ones? Do we want this 
mayhem we keep seeing happening 
right here in D.C., Minneapolis, L.A., 
any other large city, and we don’t have 
some kind of law enforcement there? 
Social workers do have their place in 
certain situations, and they can be

helpful. But we don’t take money 
away. We don’t defund the cops who 
are already shorthanded in rural areas 
like mine, sheriffs, police, in order to 
try and change the whole game. 
We have a lot of listening to do to 
each other on both sides. Not every-
body with light-colored skin is a racist, 
and I think a lot of people around this 
country are really feeling, after the 
unity we had, after the George Floyd 
ugly incident in Minneapolis, this is a 
time to get together and listen to each 
other. 
If this is allowed to continue to hap-
pen, it is going to make it awful hard 
for people to listen to each other be-
cause they are feeling under fire them-
selves for something they never did, 
never stood for. Instead, they have al-
ways stood for the greatness of that 
flag right up there. In God we trust. 
I appreciate the time. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California for his 
passionate and heartfelt words. 
It is my pleasure now to yield to the 
gentleman from Florida (Mr. POSEY). 
Mr. POSEY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
‘‘We want America back.’’ Those 
were just a few of the lyrics of a song 
written by a group named The Steeles 
in 1996. Some of the lyrics said: 
Something is wrong with America. 
This Nation is like a runaway train, 
Headed down the wrong track. 
And it concludes, in part, with: 
I love America. But I do not love what she 
has become. 
Circumstances 
seemed 
pretty 
de-
spairing back then, but they pale in 
comparison to what we are seeing 
going on across our country today, per-
petrated by Marxists, anarchists, and 
those malcontents who are funding 
them. 
Today, the miscreants are using 
George Floyd’s death to neuter the 
ability of the police to enforce the law. 
So far, they have been successful in 
getting the police out of the way. 
Without law enforcement, their mobs 
are free to move in, smash businesses, 
injure people, and cause chaos. Those 
aren’t peaceful protesters, and they are 
not peaceful protests. 
Their outcry for justice makes sym-
pathetic, or perhaps even cowardly, 
corporations and stupid movie stars 
send money to them. Now they are 
tearing down the statues, intimidating 
the public and politicians into accept-
ing their farfetched demands, and giv-
ing them even more power. 
Circumstances are advantageous for 
them right now because we are in the 
midst of a pandemic so they have a 
freer rein of the streets. 
Who could have ever imagined sanc-
tuary cities where America’s rule of 
law is ruefully ignored by government 
officials? 
Who would have ever imagined some 
elected officials would allow domestic 
terrorists or wannabe revolutionaries 
to commandeer a complete takeover 
and rule of both public and private 
property and have dominion over other 
unwilling citizens of the United States 
in so-called autonomous zones. 
Give me a break. 
Then, the lawbreakers have the au-
dacity 
to 
demand 
our 
police 
be 
defunded or reimagined, whatever the 
heck that means. It sounds insane. 
It is really a campaign to drive our 
duly-elected President Donald Trump 
from office. Anyone who stands in their 
way they think should be destroyed. 
We can expect it to get worse and 
worse until November 3, when they 
hope to put an end to the prosperity 
created by the President. You have to 
suffer from the world’s worst case of 
Potomac fever, or beltway brain drain, 
to think they are fooling anybody. 
Meanwhile, the leadership and major-
ity in this Chamber have been silent. I 
have not heard a single word, syllable, 
or letter uttered by them in opposition 
to the miscreants. It is past time for 
them to condemn their activities, and 
it is time for law enforcement across 
this Nation in every State, in every 
county, in every city, in every little 
burgh, community, and the rural areas 
in-between to put an end to this law-
lessness. 
If you don’t start acting soon, there 
wouldn’t be anything left to tear down. 
I would like to take a bunch of these 
wannabe revolutionaries to South or 
Central America for a few days to see 
how their game would end if they were 
successful in having it their way. 
b 1800 
If you have ever traveled throughout 
those socialist countries there, it is a 
very eye-opening experience. The State 
Department, and even their own offi-
cials, warn you, don’t wear any jew-
elry; don’t carry much cash, because 
there is a good chance you are going to 
get robbed. And if you are approached 
by a robber, hand over everything, hold 
back nothing, because they would just 
as soon shoot you and kill you as not 
shoot you and kill you. 
There is a lot of lawlessness, and 
they don’t fear justice. They don’t fear 
the police. They are going to take, and 
you are going to give, or you are going 
to die. And you know what the State 
Department and the local officials tell 
you next? If you get robbed, don’t call 
the police. It is not like in our country 
where, if there is a problem, you call 
the police. There, they tell you not to 
call the police because they are all cor-
rupt and they will shake you down for 
anything the robbers missed. 
One common denominator of the 
countries that I visited, which was 
Brazil, French Guiana, Suriname, and 
Trinidad, was a common denominator 
that every single house that I saw, 
large or small, urban or suburban, no 
matter how far out you went into the 
country, every single house that was 
more than a cardboard box had bars on 
every window and most of the doors. 
Why? Because that is what lawlessness 
brings. 
They truly go to bed every night in 
those socialist countries with the ex-
pectation that if they did not have 
bars, they wouldn’t wake up in the 
morning; or if they did, every posses-
sion that they had that was worth any-
thing would be gone. 
Very little police, high crime, high 
unemployment, bars on all the win-
dows. Is that what we really want for 
our future? 
We have been blessed to live in the 
land of opportunity, the most free and 
prosperous nation in the history of the 
world. Many, many, many people have 
risked their lives and the lives of their 
wives, their grandparents, their par-
ents, their children, family members to 
come here. This place is really that 
good that people would risk their life 
just to come here, a chance at coming 
here. We cannot stand back and let it 
be destroyed. We want America back. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his thoughts and 
taking time to share those with us. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Florida (Mr. YOHO). 
Mr. YOHO. Madam Speaker, I thank 
my good colleague from Arizona (Mr. 
BIGGS) for putting this on. I really do 
appreciate it because it is so timely. 
Growing pains, I think that is what 
we can say we are going through is 
growing pains again as a nation, a na-
tion birthed over 200 years ago. 
And for anybody who watched yester-
day’s debate, Madam Speaker, on the 
House floor, I think it was interesting 
to see the amount of, I guess, race-bait-
ing that was coming from the other 
side, from my colleagues, which I found 
very unreasonable that, for some rea-
son, if you are a Black man, you have 
to tell your children how to act with 
the police. 
My mom and dad had that talk with 
me, probably for good reason, too, and 
they said: If you get pulled over, ‘‘Yes, 
sir,’’ ‘‘No, sir,’’ and then when you get 
home we want to know what happened 
and why you got pulled over. I had to 
have that talk with my children. So 
that is nothing new, and I think that 
we sometimes overplay that. 
Does it happen maybe more with mi-
nority communities? Yes, I think it 
does, but nobody is immune to that. 
When I came into Congress, I got 
stopped multiple times to see if I had 
the right credentials. That has hap-
pened to me. 
Since we have been up here, the di-
vide in this country has gotten so 
much worse, and it has been since Don-
ald Trump has gotten elected. And peo-
ple will blame the President for doing 
this, but we can go back to other Presi-
dents where we have seen this happen. 
We are Americans. We need to come to-
gether as a nation. 
I have had the great fortune of being 
in Congress. This is my last term. I 
will have served 8 years. I was the 
chairman of the Asia-Pacific Sub-
committee last year, last Congress; I 
am the ranking member this year. I 
have bean able to travel the world. I 
have been in the Democratic Republic 
of the Congo.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2586 
June 26, 2020 
Africa is a continent of 1.2 billion, 
yet today, in the 21st century, 650 mil-
lion people do not have electricity. I 
suppose they have a reason to protest. 
I suppose they have a reason to com-
plain. But do they have the right to 
protest? 
Being 
on 
the 
Asia-Pacific 
Sub-
committee we got to travel to a lot of 
the Asian countries. We all know what 
is going on in Hong Kong today. Hong 
Kong is a province of China. There was 
an agreement of one country, two sys-
tems, where Hong Kong was supposed 
to be a semi- or a self-ruling area with 
an independent judiciary committee. 
Yet, 23 years into that agreement, Xi 
Jinping, the leader of the Communist 
Party, said that is null and void, and 
they have put the heavy hand of the 
Communist Party in there. 
These young students are out there 
holding up that flag behind you, 
Madam Speaker, holding up that flag 
for liberty and freedom because they 
have tasted that. That is all they have 
ever known. Yet the Chinese Com-
munist Party wants to take that away 
because it scares them. Free thought, 
independent thinking, freedom, they 
know the Communist Party cannot 
survive, so they are going in there to 
squash that. 
These students are holding those 
signs up. Our flag is up. They have been 
in my office here in the Washington 
Capitol. They have a reason to protest, 
but they do not have the right. 
You talk about Venezuela, somebody 
talked about it. Go down to Cuba and 
talk against the Castro regime. You 
don’t have the right. Talk about reli-
gion in those countries. You do not 
have the right. 
But then I look at this country, and 
I am as guilty as anybody else in this 
country. We have the right to protest, 
the First Amendment, but sometimes I 
think—and this is where I feel like I 
am guilty, like a lot of us. I think we 
take it for granted what we have in 
this country. 
It was interesting because I was with 
the Ambassadors of both Malaysia and 
Indonesia, and they talked about the 
founding of their country. When they 
got their independence, when they 
broke away and they formed those 
countries, they told me that their 
founding fathers could have picked any 
system in the world. They could have 
taken Great Britain’s system of gov-
ernment. They could have taken Ger-
many’s, Russia’s, China’s. But you 
know who they took? They took the 
principles of America because they had 
read our history, they had read those 
documents and what those documents 
meant. 
And I heard people over and over here 
today, since I have been in Congress, 
America is not a perfect country be-
cause people are in it, and people are 
not perfect, but the ideals laid out 
there were the best ideals that have 
ever been laid out. If not, why are 
other countries adopting them? Why do 
people in Cuba come across the ocean, 
a 90-mile stretch, on inner tubes, on 
rafts, on surfboards to get to this coun-
try? It is called freedom. It is called 
justice. 
But do you know what? We are not 
going to fix it if this side is accusing 
this side, and this side over here is ac-
cusing that side of pandering to our au-
dience. 
So what that meant to me when I 
was with those Ambassadors from In-
donesia and Malaysia, what it meant to 
me was: Do you know what? America is 
bigger than a Presidency. It is bigger 
than the Democratic Party. It is bigger 
than the Republican Party. It is those 
ideals that this country stands for that 
we all need to fight to hold on to. 
I want to read something that one of 
my constituents sent me. It says: ‘‘The 
lesson taught at this point by human 
experience is simply this, that the man 
who will get up will be helped up, and 
the man who will not get up will be al-
lowed to stay down. . . . Personal inde-
pendence is a virtue and it is the soul 
of which comes the sturdiest manhood. 
But there can be no independence with-
out a large share of self-dependence, 
and this virtue cannot be bestowed. It 
must be developed from within.’’ 
I had an African-American man, a 
conservative Republican who is afraid 
to tell people he is a conservative Re-
publican because he gets labeled Uncle 
Tom. You have been put on the planta-
tion. 
These are not my words. These are 
words coming from him. 
But that quote came from somebody 
I wish we could go back and meet, Mr. 
Frederick Douglass, a person born into 
slavery who picked himself up by the 
bootstraps, who educated himself. He 
stood beside President Lincoln when 
they dedicated the Emancipation stat-
ue. 
And I have got these people out here 
who loathe, despise, disdain this coun-
try, and it is being flamed by people— 
and I can’t blame just people, the 
Democrats. There are people out there 
who just hate this country, but they 
are using that to tear this country 
apart 
instead 
of 
remembering 
the 
ideals that this country is built on. 
And those are American ideologies— 
not conservative, not liberal, not Re-
publican or Democrat, American—and I 
think it is time that we all come to-
gether and realize we are Americans 
and we are on the same team. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for his passionate com-
ments about freedom. 
Madam Speaker, those of us who 
have had the good fortune of studying 
history, we know that it bumps and 
claws along. We do see progress some-
times, and we also see devolution 
sometimes. 
What we are seeing today, though, 
reminds me an awful lot of a revolution 
that took place in the early part of the 
20th century. It was not a large revolu-
tion; it was a small revolution. It was 
the Bolshevik Revolution. It was fund-
ed by some of the bourgeoisie who did 
not like the form of government in 
then-Russia. It was not a massive revo-
lution. It wasn’t widespread, but it 
changed that entire nation’s form of 
government. 
I am reminded that it was Trotsky 
who prevented the military from inter-
vening against the lawless revolution. 
What I am seeing here today reminds 
me an awful lot of that. This is a small 
revolution that is violent in nature, is 
anti-American in nature. 
And so when my colleagues mention 
the police and what they need to do, 
what happens is there has been an 
emasculation of the police. They don’t 
really want to get involved because, 
should they get involved, there is a le-
gitimate concern that they will be 
sued, arrested, et cetera. So when you 
get rid of the blue line of defense 
against lawlessness, then you basically 
destroy the foundation of the protec-
tion of your freedoms. 
President 
Trump 
called 
certain 
groups antifa, domestic terrorists. In 
our debate in the Judiciary Committee, 
some of my colleagues said antifa is a 
fiction. So I said: Well, you know, is it 
a fiction? 
So I went to CNN, because I knew 
that if I went to FOX and referred to 
FOX, nobody was going to believe that 
that was not biased. So I went to CNN 
because I wanted to find out what they 
said, and you can go through and find 
extensive interviews where the conclu-
sion is clear: antifa is a real organiza-
tion. It is a group. And the group some-
times chooses to resort to violence. 
So what do you have? They are defi-
nitely domestic. They are committing 
terrorist 
activity 
in 
this 
country. 
Thus, they are domestic. 
And what would terrorism be? Ter-
rorism is the use of force, intimidation, 
violence to change or alter behavior for 
a particular purpose. 
So you begin to see you have domes-
tic terrorism going on. 
b 1815 
18 U.S. Code, Section 2339A, I call on 
FBI Director Wray to begin using that 
statute, make the arrests necessary to 
restore order. And I call on Attorney 
General William Barr to use that same 
section to charge and prosecute these 
individuals who are attempting to in-
timidate Americans out of their free-
dom. 
A lot of these Federal monuments 
and statues that are coming down, 
these memorials that are being ripped 
to shreds, destroyed are on Federal 
property. 
And you know what? 18 U.S. Code 
1369 is the statute that Director Wray 
should be having his Federal agency 
make arrests under. And then I call on 
Attorney General Barr to have his U.S. 
attorneys charge and prosecute under 
18 U.S. Code 1369 for destruction of vet-
erans’ memorials. And we can go for-
ward. 
But why do I even bring that up? It is 
because I believe sincerely that this 
country is built on the idea that each

of us should have agency, will, choice. 
It hasn’t always worked out really well 
or perfectly. There are those who have 
had their choices and will taken away 
from them. That is inexcusable, of 
course. 
But if we are going to have will and 
choice and freedom, then we are part of 
this great social contract where I dele-
gate my right to defend myself because 
I can’t do it all the time. There are 
people who are stronger or more vi-
cious or are more malevolent who want 
to compel me to do something or take 
something from me. 
We delegate police authority to po-
lice. It is not carte blanche. It is rea-
sonable. 
We have got to restore respect for the 
law, for the police, for the courts, and 
for process. 
It is imperfect. I worked in that sys-
tem for a lot of years on both sides, 
prosecuting and defending. It is not a 
perfect process. 
The reality is, though, it is as Win-
ston Churchill said, Democracy is the 
worst form of government except for 
all those others. 
It is the best humankind has come up 
with. 
To destroy our history seems so anti-
thetical to making progress, eradi-
cating our history, erasing it. 
College professors are now saying we 
have got to go through and remove 
books from the library. 
Remove them from the library, be-
cause why? They have unpopular ideas 
in them. They may be unpopular ideas, 
but you know what is better than tak-
ing them out and burning them or re-
moving them and trashing them ala 
Adolph Hitler and the Nazis? It is let-
ting us read them, discuss them, and 
point out their flaws, and rehabilitate 
us, our hearts. 
Artwork being removed from muse-
ums, being removed from this House. 
Why? Because some were not 2020 po-
litically correct. What they did was, to 
some, unconscionable and abominable. 
Let’s have the discussion. 
Removing your history allows you to 
repeat the mistakes of your history. I 
simply don’t understand it. 
We have now moved beyond a moti-
vational or some kind of philosophical 
attempt to remove historical items. 
Now we are seeing indiscriminate ac-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a series of articles. 
[From Breitbart News] 
A greater percentage of U.S. registered 
voters believe Confederate statues, which 
have been targeted by protesters in recent 
weeks, should remain standing despite activ-
ists’ demands to remove them, a Morning 
Consult poll released this week revealed. 
The survey, taken June 6–7, showed that a 
greater number of Americans believe Confed-
erate statues should remain standing, 44 per-
cent, as opposed to the 32 percent who say 
they should be removed. Twenty-three per-
cent expressed no opinion on the matter. 
The fundings reflect a slight shift in opin-
ion over the last three years. In August 2017, 
52 percent of voters indicated that the stat-
ues should be left alone, with just over a 
quarter, 26 percent, indicating otherwise. 
However, Morning Consult reported that 
the purported increase in support over the 
years is largely driven by Democrats: 
The rise in support for removing the stat-
ues was driven by Democrats, a majority of 
whom now take that position, and independ-
ents, who still favor keeping those statues 
standing by a 10–point margin. Eleven per-
cent of GOP voters say the statues should be 
removed, virtually unchanged since 2017. 
The vast majority of Republicans, 71 per-
cent, believe the Confederate statues should 
remain standing, whereas the majority of 
Democrats, 53 percent, believe they should 
be taken down. Forty percent of independ-
ents believe they should remain standing, 
with 30 percent vying for their removal and 
30 percent expressing no opinion. 
The survey was taken among ‘‘roughly’’ 
1,900 voters, with a margin of error of +/- two 
percent. 
The survey comes as protesters vandalize 
and, in some cases, tear down Confederate 
statues and others they deem offensive, in-
cluding statues of Christopher Columbus. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D–CA) has 
also embraced the calls for change, request-
ing in a letter on Wednesday the removal of 
Confederate statues occupying the U.S. Cap-
itol, or as she called them, ‘‘monuments to 
men who advocated cruelty and barbarism to 
achieve such a plainly racist end.’’ 
‘‘Monuments to men who advocated cru-
elty and barbarism to achieve such a plainly 
racist end are a grotesque affront to these 
ideals,’’ she said in a letter to Committee 
Chair Roy Blunt (R–MO) and Vice Chair Zoe 
Lofgren (D–CA). ‘‘Their statues pay homage 
to hate, not heritage. They must be re-
moved.’’ 
Interestingly, Pelosi has remained silent 
on her own father’s role in the dedication of 
a Confederate statue in Baltimore’s Wyman 
Park in 1948. 
As Breitbart News detailed: 
However, her father, Thomas D’Alesandro, 
Jr., oversaw the dedication of such a statue 
in Baltimore’s Wyman Park—the Stonewall 
Jackson and Robert E. Lee Monument—as 
mayor of the city in 1948. At the time, the 
Speaker’s father said people could look to 
Jackson’s and Lee’s lives as inspiration and 
urged Americans to ‘‘emulate Jackson’s ex-
ample and stand like a stone wall against ag-
gression in any form that would seek to de-
stroy the liberty of the world.’’ 
World Wars I and II found the North and 
South fighting for a common cause, and the 
generalship and military science displayed 
by these two great men in the War between 
the States lived on and were applied in the 
military plans of our nation in Europe and 
the Pacific areas,’’ D’Alesandro said at the 
dedication ceremony, as detailed by the Bal-
timore Sun. He continued: 
Today with our nation beset by subversive 
groups and propaganda which seeks to de-
stroy our national unity, we can look for in-
spiration to the lives of Lee and Jackson to 
remind us to be resolute and determined in 
preserving our sacred institutions . . . re-
main steadfast in our determination to pre-
serve freedom, not only for ourselves, but for 
other liberty-loving nations who are striving 
to preserve their national unity as free na-
tions. 
Pelosi’s office did not return Breitbart 
News’s request for comment. 
[From Fox News, Aug. 21, 2018] 
WHICH CONFEDERATE STATUES WERE 
REMOVED? A RUNNING LIST 
(By Christopher Carbone) 
More than 30 cities across the United 
States have removed or relocated Confed-
erate statues and monuments amid an in-
tense nationwide debate about race and his-
tory. 
After a ‘‘Unite the Right’’ rally in Virginia 
in August to protest against the removal of 
a statue of Robert E. Lee resulted in the 
death of a woman who was demonstrating 
against white supremacy, other cities have 
decided to remove Confederate statues. 
Many of the controversial monuments 
were dedicated in the early twentieth cen-
tury or during the height of the Civil Rights 
Movement. Discussions are under way about 
the removal of monuments in Houston, At-
lanta, Nashville, Pensacola, Florida, Jack-
sonville, Florida, Richmond, Virginia, Bir-
mingham, Alabama, and Charlottesville, Vir-
ginia. 
Here is a running list of all the monuments 
and statues that have been removed and the 
cities that have taken them down: 
ANNAPOLIS, MD. 
Under cover of darkness, city workers re-
moved a statue in August 2017 of former Su-
preme Court Justice Roger Taney that had 
been on the State House’s front lawn for 145 
years. Taney authored the Supreme Court’s 
1857 Dred Scott decision, which held that Af-
rican-Americans could not be U.S. citizens. 
The city’s Republican mayor said through a 
spokesman that it was removed ‘‘as a matter 
of public safety.’’ 
AUSTIN, TEXAS 
The statues of four people with ties to the 
Confederacy—Robert E. Lee, Albert Sidney 
Johnson, John H. Reagan and former Texas 
Gov. James Stephen Hogg—were removed 
from pedestals on the University of Texas 
campus on Aug. 17, 2017. UT’s president said 
in a written statement the deadly clashes in 
Charlottesville made it clear ‘‘Confederate 
monuments have become symbols of modern 
white supremacy and neo-Nazism.’’ Sepa-
rately, a 1,200–pound bronze statue of Confed-
erate President Jefferson Davis that was re-
moved from UT’s campus in 2015 has now re-
turned to the campus, at the Briscoe Center 
for American History. 
The Austin school board voted to strip 
Confederate names from five district schools, 
though they haven’t been renamed yet. The 
board had previously renamed Robert E. Lee 
Elementary School in 2016. 
The Austin City Council approved renam-
ing Robert E. Lee Road and Jeff Davis Ave-
nue. 
BALTIMORE, MD. 
Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh told re-
porters she wanted to move ‘‘quickly and 
quietly’’ to take down four Confederate stat-
ues or monuments—statues of Lee and 
Thomas, J. ‘‘Stonewall’’ Jackson and monu-
ments for Confederate Soldiers and Sailors 
and Confederate Women—from the city’s 
public spaces. Although the plan had been in 
the works since June 2017, the Baltimore 
City Council approved it only two days after 
the deadly events in Charlottesville. On 
March 10, 2018, the space where the Confed-
erate statues had stood was rededicated to 
abolitionist and civil rights pioneer Harriet 
Tubman. 
BRADENTON, FLA. 
Mantee County removed a Confederate sol-
diers memorial obelisk on Aug. 24 after the 
city commission voted 4–3 to take it down 
and place it in storage. The monument, 
which had stood there for more than 90 
years, was accidentally broken into two 
pieces when city workers removed it. The re-
moval came after days of protests from resi-
dents and activists, most of whom were in 
favor of taking it down, and it cost $12,700 to 
remove. 
BROOKLYN, N.Y. 
Plaques honoring Lee were removed from 
an episcopal church’s property on Aug. 16,

2017 and the governor called on the Army to 
remove the names of Lee and another Con-
federate general from the streets around a 
nearby fort. ‘‘It was very easy for us to say, 
‘OK, we’ll take the plaques down,’ ’’ said 
Bishop Lawrence Provenzano, of the Epis-
copal Diocese of Long Island, who called 
them ‘‘offensive to the community.’’ New 
York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for 
a review of all the city’s public art to iden-
tify ‘‘symbols of hate’’ for possible removal. 
DALLAS, TEXAS 
A bronze statue of Robert E. Lee, formally 
called the Robert Edward Lee Sculpture, was 
removed in mid-September 2017 from Robert 
E. Lee Park, which was also named in honor 
of the Confederate general. The Dallas City 
Council voted 13–1 to remove the statue, 
which has stood in Lee Park for 81 years. 
The park was dedicated to Lee by Presi-
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936 dur-
ing a renaming ceremony of the park. 
DAYTONA BEACH, FLA. 
Three Confederate monuments were re-
moved from a city park Friday morning. A 
city spokesperson said the plaques were 
going to be cleaned up and taken to a nearby 
museum. The decision to remove them did 
not require public input, the spokes-person 
told FOX35, because they were donated and 
not purchased with taxpayer funds. 
CHAPEL HILL, N.C. 
Protesters toppled the ‘‘Silent Sam’’ stat-
ue that has stood on the University of North 
Carolina’s Chapel Hill campus since 1913 on 
Aug. 20. More than 200 people had gathered 
and were chanting ‘‘hey, hey, ho, ho, this 
racist statue has got to go.’’ In a statement, 
UNC Chancellor Carol Folt called the act 
‘‘unlawful and dangerous,’’ adding that law 
enforcement were investigating the incident. 
The statue had been a source of controversy, 
with school officials claiming that state law 
prevented them from removing it. 
DURHAM, N.C. 
A nearly-century old statue of a Confed-
erate soldier was toppled not long after 
Charlottesville by protesters associated with 
the Workers World party. North Carolina 
Central University student Takiyah Thomp-
son, along with three others, were arrested 
and charged with felonies in the days fol-
lowing. As the bronze statue lay crumpled on 
the ground, protesters could be seen kicking 
it on social media. A Worthington assistant 
city manager said the community seeks to 
be one that ‘‘promotes tolerance, respect and 
inclusion.’’ 
A statue of Lee was removed from the en-
trance to Duke University Chapel on Aug. 19, 
2017 and is set to be preserved in some way to 
study the university’s ‘‘complex past.’’ 
‘‘I took this course of action to protect 
Duke Chapel, to ensure the vital safety of 
students and community members who wor-
ship there, and above all to express the deep 
and abiding values of our university,’’ uni-
versity President Vincent Price wrote in 
statement to the school. 
FRANKLIN, OHIO 
A monument to Lee was removed in Au-
gust 2017 by Franklin workers. Gainesville, 
Fla. 
A chapter of the United Daughters of the 
Confederacy paid for the removal of a monu-
ment to Confederate soldiers known locally 
as ‘‘Old Joe’’ that stood in front a building in 
downtown Gainesville for 113 years. It was 
moved to a private cemetery outside the city 
in August 2017. 
HELENA, MONT. 
The state’s capital city on Aug. 18, 2017 re-
moved a memorial to Confederate soldiers 
that had been in a public park since 1916. The 
granite fountain, which was dismantled, had 
been donated by the United Daughters of the 
Confederacy. City Parks and Recreation Di-
rector Amy Teegarden told the Spokesman- 
Review that the fountain initially will be 
stored in a city warehouse—but it could be 
reassembled at a future date. 
KANSAS CITY, MO. 
A Confederate monument was boxed up in 
summer 2017 and is slated to be removed. The 
Missouri division of the United Daughters of 
the Confederacy had asked Kansas City 
Parks and Recreation to find a new home for 
it. 
LEXINGTON, KY. 
Two 130-year-old Confederate statues were 
removed from downtown Lexington on Octo-
ber 18 after the state’s attorney general 
issued an opinion giving the city permission 
to take them down and move them to a pri-
vate cemetery. Lexington used private funds 
to take the statues, of Confederate General 
John Hunt Morgan and John Breckinridge, a 
former U.S. Vice President and the last Con-
federate Secretary of War. Private funds will 
cover the cost of their upkeep in the ceme-
tery. 
LOS ANGELES, CALIF. 
A large stone monument commemorating 
Confederate veterans was taken down Aug. 
16 from the Hollywood Forever Cemetery 
after hundreds of people demanded its re-
moval. The 6-foot granite marker was loaded 
into a pickup truck and taken to a storage 
facility. A petition calling for it to be taken 
down had garnered 1,3000 signatures. 
LOUISVILLE, KY. 
A statue of a Confederate soldier was re-
moved from the University of Louisville 
campus after a legal battle between the city 
residents, the mayor and the Sons of Confed-
erate Veterans. It was relocated to Branden-
burg, Kentucky, which hosts Civil War Re-
enactments. 
MADISON, WIS. 
A plaque honoring Confederate soldiers 
were removed Aug. 17 from a cemetery not 
long after residents and city leaders began 
calling for it to be taken down. ‘‘The Civil 
War was an act of insurrection and treason 
and a defense of the deplorable practice of 
slavery,’’ said Mayor Paul Soglin in a state-
ment. ‘‘The monuments in question were 
connected to that action and we do not need 
them on city property.’’ 
MEMPHIS, TENN. 
Crews removed two Confederate statues 
from Memphis parks on Dec. 20 after the city 
sold them to a private entity. The City 
Council voted unanimously earlier in the day 
to sell both Health Sciences and fourth Bluff 
Parks where the Confederate statues, of Con-
federate General Nathan Bedford Forrest and 
Confederate President Jefferson Davis, were 
located. 
NASHVILLE, TENN. 
The Legendary Ryman Auditorium, where 
stars like Dolly Parton, Patsy Cline and Lo-
retta Lynn made their Grand Ole Opry de-
buts, quietly moved a sign on Sept 21 hang-
ing the venue’s upper level that read ‘‘1897 
Confederate Gallery.’’ Honoring an 1897 re-
union of Confederate veterans at the Ryman, 
the sign had been shrouded over the years 
but has now been permanently removed from 
the main auditorium and added to a museum 
exhibit that explains the history of the 125- 
year-old music hall. 
NEW ORLEANS, LA. 
New Orleans city workers removed four 
monuments in April dedicated to the Confed-
eracy and opponents of Reconstruction. The 
city council had declared the monuments a 
public nuisance. The monuments removed 
were of Confederate General P.G.T. Beau-
regard, Davis and Lee. Also removed was the 
Liberty Place Monument, which commemo-
rated a Reconstruction Era white suprema-
cist attack on the city’s integrated police 
force. The mayor plans to replace with new 
fountains and an American flag. 
NEW YORK, N.Y. 
Busts of Lee and Jackson were removed 
overnight on Aug. 17 from the Hall of Fame 
for Great Americans at Bronx Community 
College. Prior to its removal, Bro x Borough 
president Ruben Siaz Jr. had said ‘‘there is 
nothing great about two men who committed 
treason against the United States to fight to 
keep the institution of slavery in tact.’’ 
ORLANDO, FLA. 
A Confederate statue known as ‘‘Johnny 
Reb’’ was moved in June 2017 by officials 
from Lake Eola Park to Greenwood Ceme-
tery in response to public outcry about it 
being symbolic of hate and white supremacy. 
A spokesperson for Orlando’s mayor told Fox 
News that city officials are working with 
historians on a new inscription to put the 
monument ‘‘in proper historical perspec-
tive.’’ 
RICHMOND, VA. 
The Richmond school board voted 6–1 on 
June 18, 2018 to rename J.E.B. Stuart Ele-
mentary School to Barack Obama Elemen-
tary School. The process began several 
months prior and involved input from stu-
dents, teachers, administrators and local 
stakeholders. Virginia is home to the largest 
number of Confederate monuments and sym-
bols in the country. 
ROCKVILLE, MD. 
A 13-ton bronze Confederate statue that 
had stood for decades next to Rockville’s Red 
Brick Courthouse was relocated in July next 
to a privately run Potomac River ferry 
named for a Confederate general. The reloca-
tion cost about $100,000, according to the 
Washington Post. 
SAN DIEGO, CALIF. 
A plaque honoring Davis was quietly re-
moved Aug. 16, 2017 from a downtown park. 
‘‘This morning I ordered the immediate re-
moval of a plaque honoring the Confederacy 
at Horton Plaza Park,’’ Mayor Kevin 
Faulconer told the Los Angeles Times. 
‘‘San Diegans stand together against Confed-
erate symbols of division.’’ 
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS 
A Confederate statue was removed from 
Travis Park overnight Sept. 1, 2017 after the 
City Council voted 10–1 in favor of taking it 
down the previous day. There were no pro-
testers during or after the removal, accord-
ing to local media reports. ‘‘This is, without 
context, a monument that glorifies the 
causes of the Confederacy, and that’s not 
something that a modern city needs to have 
in a public square,’’ said San Antonio Mayor 
Ron Nirenberg following the council vote. 
SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS 
A Jefferson Davis highway marker was re-
moved in 2016. 
ST. LOUIS, MO. 
The Missouri Civil War Museum oversaw 
the removal in late June 2017 of a 32-foot 
granite and bronze monument from Forest 
Park, where it had stood for 103 years. It 
shouldered the costs of removal and will hold 
the monument in storage until a new home 
can be found for it. The agreement stipulates 
the monument can be re-displayed at a Civil 
War museum, battlefield or cemetery. In 
Boone County, a rock with a plaque honoring 
Confederate soldiers that had been removed 
from the University of Missouri campus was 
relocated a second time after the Charleston 
AEM church massacre to a historic site com-
memorating a nearby Civil War battle.

ST. PETERSBURG, FLA. 
St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman or-

federate marker at noon on Aug. 15, 2017 
after determining that it was on city prop-
erty. It’s being held in storage until a new 
home can be found for it. ‘‘The plaque recog-
nizing a highway named after Stonewall 
Jackson has been removed and we will at-
tempt to locate its owner,’’ Kriseman said in 
a statement to the Tampa Bay Times. 
WASHINGTON, D.C. 
The stewards of the National Mall an-
nounced this week that the exhibit alongside 
the Thomas Jefferson Memorial will be up-
dated to showcase his status as both one of 
the country’s founders and a slaveholder. 
‘‘We can reflect the momentous contribu-
tions of someone like Thomas Jefferson, but 
also consider carefully the complexity of 
who he was,’’ an official with the Trust told 
the Washington Examiner. ‘‘And that’s not 
reflected right now in the exhibits.’’ 
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker introduced a 
bill in Sept. 2017 to remove Confederate stat-
ues from the U.S. Capitol Building. 
The National Cathedral voted that same 
month to take down two stained-glass win-
dows of Confederate generals. The removal 
could take a few days and workers seen put-
ting up scaffolding around the windows to 
start the process- 
Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, 
signed a bill to replace a statue of a Confed-
erate general at the U.S. Capitol with one of 
Mary McLeod Bethune, a black woman who 
founded 
a 
school 
that 
became 
BethuneCookman 
University 
in 
Daytona 
Beach, Florida. She’ll become the first black 
female to be honored in Statuary Hall. 
WORTHINGTON, OHIO 
Worthington removed a historic marker 
Aug. 18 outside the former home of a Confed-
erate general.

POLLS FIND LITTLE SUPPORT
FOR CONFED-
ERATE
STATUE
REMOVAL—BUT
HOW
YOU 
ASK MATTERS 
(By Ariel Edwards-Levy) 
Americans are generally unsupportive of 
attempts to remove memorials honoring 
Confederate leaders, new polling shows—al-
though the way the question is framed may 
make a significant difference. 
In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, a third of 
Americans favor removing statues and me-
morials of Confederate leaders, with 49 per-
cent opposed. Just 29 percent of Americans 
favor changing the names of streets, schools 
and buildings commemorating Confederate 
leaders, while half are opposed. 
Those surveyed are effectively split on 
whether the Confederate flag is more a sym-
bol of Southern pride (36 percent) or racism 
(35 percent), with the rest unsure or saying it 
represents neither. But even if Americans 
don’t overwhelmingly recognize the flag as a 
symbol of racism, there’s also little wide-
spread enthusiasm for its use. Just 34 per-
cent of Americans say they approve of dis-
playing the Confederate flag in public, while 
47 percent disapprove. 
Opinions on the Confederate memorials are 
divided along racial lines, but to an even 
greater degree along political ones. Black 
Americans are 18 percentage points likelier 
than white Americans to favor removing 
statues of Confederate leaders—but the gap 
between Democrats and Republicans on the 
question is 46 points. And the difference be-
tween Hillary Clinton voters and those who 
supported President Donald Trump in last 
year’s election is a full 58 points. 
Within the Democratic Party, white and 
black people are about equally likely to 
favor removing the statues: 64 percent and 63 
percent, respectively, say they’d like to see 
them taken down. There are differences, 
however, by ideology among the party’s 
members—77 percent of self-described liberal 
Democrats, but just 40 percent of self-de-
scribed moderates or conservatives—want to 
see the statues removed. 
Most other surveys released in the past few 
weeks find at best modest support for remov-
ing Confederate memorials, although two 
distinctively-worded questions stand out in 
these results. 
The strongest support for keeping memo-
rials in place came in the poll conducted by 
Marist for NPR and PBS NewsHour, which 
gave respondents a choice between letting 
statues ‘‘remain as a historical symbol’’ and 
removing them ‘‘because they are offensive 
to some people.’’ (Arguably, the question 
might have been better balanced had the 
first option been written as ‘‘because some 
people view them as a historical symbol.’’) 
The only poll to find majority support for 
removing some monuments, conducted by 
the Democratic firm Public Policy Polling, 
adopted a framework far more sympathetic 
to the monuments’ opponents, asking about 
their ‘‘relocation’’ rather than their ‘‘re-
moval.’’ 
PPP found voters split—39 percent to 34 
percent—on whether they ‘‘support or oppose 
monuments honoring the Confederacy.’’ But 
those voters were largely willing to relocate 
Confederate monuments if the issue was in-
stead presented as an attempt to move them 
‘‘to museums or other historic sites where 
they can be viewed in proper historical con-
text.’’ Unlike other questions, PPP also 
asked specifically about memorials on gov-
ernment property, rather than a broader 
question about public spaces. 
Opinions surrounding Confederate symbols 
have also proved to be fairly mutable in re-
sponse to current events. After a white su-
premacist killed nine members of a black 
church in Charleston, South Carolina, two 
years ago, support for the Confederate flag 
dropped quickly and significantly. 
That doesn’t appear to have happened yet 
following the violence earlier this month in 
Charlottesville, Virginia, sparked by a white 
nationalist rally opposing efforts to remove 
a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. 
But if the issue remains a flashpoint in the 
days to come, its prominence could possibly 
polarize views even further than they al-
ready are. (Charlottesville on Wednesday 
draped black shrouds over the Lee statue and 
one for Confederate Gen. Thomas ‘‘Stone-
wall’’ Jackson.) 
Since Trump took office, Democrats have 
repeatedly rallied around opinions that serve 
as anti-Trump shibboleths, expressing sharp-
ly increased alarm about global warming, 
mistrust of Russia and support for immigra-
tion. While Democrats are already generally 
in favor of taking down the Confederate stat-
ues, their level of support for doing so ranges 
between 45 percent and 72 percent in recent 
surveys—far lower than the party’s almost 
unanimous dislike for the president.

ABOLITIONIST MONUMENTS DEFACED BY ANTI- 
RACISM’ RIOTERS IS WHAT TEACHING FAKE 
HISTORY GETS AMERICA 
(By Joy Pullmann) 
The imagery couldn’t be more direct. 
Across the nation, rioting and unrest that 
has killed black Americans and destroyed 
black neighborhoods has included the deface-
ment of historic monuments, including those 
to abolitionists. 
The last wave of monument destruction, in 
2017, largely focused on Confederates and 
slave holders, erasing all the accomplish-
ments of figures such as George Washington 
and Thomas Jefferson with a scarlet S, for 
slave-holder. This time, the ignorance has 
descended even further. 
The rioters are now tearing down and de-
facing memorials wantonly, apparently as-
suming that if someone is being celebrated 
that person is ‘‘probably a racist,’’ as the 
image below says. 
This prejudiced ignorance appears to be 
widespread, and unchecked by local authori-
ties. Several of the defaced monuments are 
of abolitionists, including the Great Emanci-
pator Abraham Lincoln, as Tristan Justice 
reported Thursday. For example: 
‘‘[I]n Boston, demonstrators also vandal-
ized a monument to the 54th Massachusetts 
regiment, the second all-black volunteer 
regiment of the Union Army,’’ Justice 
writes.’’ . . . Add to the growing list of civil 
rights freedom fighters defaced by social jus-
tice protestors a Minnesota memorial to 
three black men who were lynched in 1920 
following false rape accusations from a white 
woman.’’ 
These mob actions are not the result of ac-
cidental ignorance, but of cultivated preju-
dice. One month ago, I collected just a few 
pieces of evidence pointing in this direction: 
A 2019 poll found . . . that ‘‘more than 80 
percent of Americans ages 39 and younger 
could not say what rights the First Amend-
ment protects, and three-quarters or more 
couldn’t name any authors of The Federalist 
Papers.’’ Another 2019 poll found ‘‘just 57 per-
cent of millennials believe the Declaration of 
Independence ‘better guarantees freedom and 
equality’ than the Communist Manifesto.’’ A 
2016 Federalist article notes, ‘‘40 percent of 
recent grads were unaware that Congress has 
the right to declare war and 10 percent think 
Judge Judy is on the Supreme Court.’’ 
In February, I presented more such evi-
dence: 
Today, 4 in 10 Americans who are younger 
than 39 disagree that the United States ‘‘has 
a history we should be proud of,’’ according 
to a 2019 poll by FLAG/YouGov. The poll also 
found that half of all Americans agree the 
United States is a sexist and racist country, 
including 
two-thirds 
of 
millennials. 
Millennials showed the lowest level of agree-
ment with the statement, ‘‘I’m proud to be 
an 
American.’’ 
Thirty-eight 
percent 
of 
‘‘younger Americans do not agree that 
‘America has a history that we should be 
proud of,’ ’’ according to the poll. 2019’s an-
nual poll from the Victims of Communism 
Memorial Foundation found that 37 percent 
of millennials think the United States is 
‘‘among the most unequal societies in the 
world.’’ 
The anti-American group of recent grad-
uates is not a fringe element. It is a substan-
tial and ominously growing group of voting- 
age adults. 
The recent riots have given us many more 
indications that America’s education insti-
tutions do not merely keep kids ignorant, 
but actively teach them to hate their coun-
try. Just refer to any of the emails and 
website banners you’ve been subjected to 
from every company you’ve ever purchased 
from online, detailing about how they’re all 
‘‘fighting racism’’ by frantically donating to 
people and organizations that make a living 
off heightened racial tensions. 
These messages reveal that the nation’s 
leadership class has all been re-educated ex-
tremely successfully to believe a pack of 
things that just aren’t true about American 
history and ideals. They are well-catechized 
in what is billed as antiracist attitudes and 
activities that are rooted in false informa-
tion and more likely to instead increase ra-
cial tensions. 
Hardly a one of them, or any other Amer-
ican, can tell you much about George Wash-
ington besides he was a slave owner. Hardly

one of them can identify Woodrow Wilson 
and Franklin Delano Roosevelt as bona fide, 
deep-dyed racists. Not one of them know one 
of the first acts of Congress—the Congress 
that existed before today’s Congress, the one 
that pre-dates the Constitution—was to pass 
a massive document outlawing slavery in 
territory newly acquired from Great Britain 
during postwar negotiations. 
But they all have heard of Audre Lorde, 
whose great contribution to society is basi-
cally being black and gay. They are all up on 
movies directed by black women like Ava 
DuVernay and books by pathos-filled but 
fact-challenged black writers like Ta-Nehisi 
Coates. They all know Michael Brown put 
his hands up and said ‘‘Don’t shoot’’ even 
though he didn’t. They’re passing around dis-
credited fake history like The New York 
Times’s 1619 Project as if it were accurate, 
and using it to justify supporting totali-
tarian thought policing because a black guy 
says this will solve racism. 
These people’s heads aren’t empty. Their 
hate isn’t blind. It’s very well-formed. And 
it’s been deliberately aimed at the very 
country that has paid for and overseen their 
indoctrination into political violence. 
I’ve now spent about a decade tracking in-
formation like this, and have researched and 
written about it in more detail than most, 
and therefore can assure you there is much 
more to find. Entire books have and could be 
written to detail more. Each generation of 
American children has learned less real his-
tory than the generation before it. Each gen-
eration of American children has instead 
been subject to greater levels of indoctrina-
tion in place of genuine education. The 
alarms have been sounded for decades, even a 
century, and nothing effective has been done. 
So now we have riots and unfettered monu-
ment smashing. This is no accident. It is a 
logical consequence of convincing ourselves, 
against all evidence, that America’s public 
education institutions are largely sound out-
side a few crazies who never happen to be in 
one’s own school district, and even if they 
were, one’s own children would of course be 
impervious. Not like their stupid dupes of 
classmates, who in just a few short years 
will go on to vote and tear down monuments 
to American abolitionists in the name of 
anti-racism. 
This is what happens when conservatives 
spend 120 years complaining about the left 
controlling academia while the politicians 
conservatives vote for and cheerily profile in 
our publications keep increasing funding for 
these intellectual enemies of our country. 
Seventy years later, God and man are still 
objects of scorn at Yale, and so is our nation, 
but still we keep sending them our kids and 
money, hiring their graduates to teach our 
children and rule us, and funding their stu-
dents. 
The postwar convention of Minnesota nice-
ness in politics has been a disaster. That’s 
because cowardice ultimately is not nice. It 
leaves the innocent and the vulnerable de-
fenseless. And, as with Stockholm Syn-
drome, some of the preyed upon ultimately 
turn predator themselves after identifying 
too strongly with their captors. 
How many more statues and American 
minds have to get smashed before people who 
genuinely love their country gain the cour-
age to start fighting effectively for her res-
toration before it’s too late? Here’s part of 
what that would look like: Civil authorities 
first stopping vandalism and pursuing the 
vandals to mete out their just, legally deter-
mined penalties; second, politicians who 
claim to love America fighting for her by re-
fusing to send public funds to institutions 
that fail to prove their graduates honor the 
country that pays for their education. At 
this point, that’s just about all of them. 
It’s time for a new, non-racist boycott, di-
vest, sanction movement—for taxpayer-fund-
ed education. Liberate public funds from 
these institutions with a century-long record 
of failure. Return it to families. At least half 
of them will be delighted to choose pro- 
America schools. That’s a lot more than pick 
proAmerica schools now. It would give this 
country a chance to strive toward its ideals 
once more rather than burn them in chaos.

HERE’S A LIST OF ALL THE MONUMENTS 
LIBERALS WANT TO TEAR DOWN SO FAR 
(BY BRE PAYTON) 
In the wake of the violence that took place 
in Charlottesville over last weekend, numer-
ous activists and politicians have called for 
the destruction of more historical monu-
ments, although a significant majority of 
Americans (62 percent) think the monuments 
should stay put. Only 27 percent of Ameri-
cans think these statues should be removed 
for fear of offending some people. As usual, 
public opinion’s not stopping liberals from 
pursuing an unpopular agenda. 
Though by no means comprehensive, here’s 
a list of the monuments that are facing calls 
for removal or have already been torn down. 
1. THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL IN WASHINGTON DC 
In a PBS interview, Al Sharpton called for 
the Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC to 
be abandoned because the third president of 
the United States and author of the Declara-
tion of Independence was a slave owner. 
2. STATUES IN THE CAPITOL 
Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D–Calif.) and Sen. Cory 
Booker (D–N.J.) have both called for statues 
commemorating Confederates to be removed 
from the U.S. Capitol. 
3. MOUNT RUSHMORE 
Vice News’s Wilbert L. Cooper called for 
Mount Rushmore to be destroyed because 
the U.S. presidents whose visages are carved 
into the mountainside are problematic by to-
day’s standards. 
4. MONUMENTS IN BALTIMORE 
Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh had Civil 
War monuments removed from the city in 
the cover of night, without any public hear-
ings or any public discussion process. Pugh 
told The New York Times that she used her 
emergency powers as mayor to take down 
statues of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jack-
son from a public park—surprising even 
some members of the city council. 
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan also called for 
a statue memorializing Roger B. Taney, a 
Supreme Court justice who penned the infa-
mous Dred Scott decision. which determined 
that anyone descended from a slave could 
not be an American citizen, be removed from 
the pedestal where it had been erected since 
1887. 
5. STONE MOUNTAIN 
Democratic 
gubernatorial 
candidate 
Stacey Abrams called for a frieze depicting 
Confederate soldiers to be removed from 
Stone Mountain in Georgia. 
6. ALBERT PIKE STATUE IN WASHINGTON DC 
In Washington DC, a group of protestors 
gathered on Sunday to call for the statue of 
Albert Pike, a Confederate general, to be 
torn down. 
7. CHICAGO PARKS NAMED AFTER WASHINGTON 
AND JACKSON 
A Chicago pastor has asked the mayor to 
remove the names of two former presidents— 
George Washington and Andrew Jackson— 
from city parks because both men owned 
slaves. 
8. CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS MONUMENT IN 
DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA 
The Confederate Soldiers Monument was 
torn down by protesters from its spot in 
front of the old Durham County Courthouse 
on Monday. Four have been arrested in con-
nection to this instance of vandalism. The 
Workers World Party released a statement 
claiming that it should be their right to tear 
the monuments down. 
9. MONUMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF 
NORTH CAROLINA 
North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has called 
for additional monuments to be torn down 
and is asking the state legislature to repeal 
a 2015 law that prevents the destruction of 
Civil War monuments. 
10. MONUMENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF 
VIRGINIA 
In a statement released Wednesday after-
noon, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe is ask-
ing state legislators and city officials to tear 
down monuments throughout the Old Do-
minion. 
11. ‘OLD JOE’ STATUE IN GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA 
In Gainesville, Florida, a statue of a Con-
federate soldier was removed Monday from 
outside a county administrative building. 
12. STATUES IN LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY 
The City Council of Lexington, Kentucky 
voted unanimously on Tuesday to remove 
Confederate statues from the lawn in front of 
an old county courthouse. In response, a 
white nationalist group is reportedly plan-
ning a protest. 
13. STATUES IN LOUISVILLE, KENTUCKY 
On Monday, protesters gathered in favor of 
removing a statue of Civil War officer John 
B. Castleman from Louisville, Kentucky. 
14. STATUES IN NASHVILLE TENNESSEE, 
INCLUDING ONE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY 
In Nashville, Tennessee, protestors gath-
ered to call for the removal of a monument 
depicting Nathan Bedford Forrest, a lieuten-
ant in the Confederate army, from the state 
capitol on Monday. People have also called 
for a memorial of Forrest, which sits on pri-
vate property, to be hidden from view of the 
nearby highway. 
15. TWO STATUES VANDALIZED IN WILMINGTON, 
NORTH CAROLINA 
‘‘A white flag was hung on the gun of the 
statue and its head and feet were spray 
painted,’’ WECT reports. ‘‘Officers were 
called back to the scene and found a rope 
tied to the statue’s neck. Upon examination, 
officers said they believe it was likely tied to 
a vehicle in an attempt to pull the statue 
over.’’ Another statue was marked with graf-
fiti. 
16. A CEMETERY MARKER IN LOS ANGELES 
A statue that stood in the Confederate sec-
tion of Hollywood Forever Cemetery for 
more than 90 years was toppled on Wednes-
day, Los Angeles Times reports. A plaque 
commemorating Jefferson Davis was also re-
moved from a park this week. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I will 
say that as we go forward, if we con-
tinue to denigrate all police officers be-
cause of a few police officers, if we 
denigrate all of our society because of 
a few in our society, we will see this 
Nation, the ideals of individual free-
dom, erased from this Earth. 
I used to do work at multilateral in-
stitutions and at the United Nations, 
and I will tell you this: This country, 
to me, is special and unique; imperfect, 
but the idea, the ideals, the people who 
have gone before us, how can we erase 
what they have done? Some made mag-
nificent sacrifices that we might enjoy 
the freedoms we enjoy today, and yet 
they were wrong on other issues in 
their lives.

JUNE IS LGBTQ PRIDE MONTH 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. GREEN) is recognized for 60 min-
utes as the designee of the majority 
leader. 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. 
I am here for a special purpose, and I 
shall not deviate from the cause that 
has brought me to this podium tonight, 
but I do assure you there are things 
that have been said that at an appro-
priate time, I will respond to. 
Tonight, I rise to call to the atten-
tion of this House H. Res. 1014, Encour-
aging the celebration of the month of 
June as LGBTQ Pride Month. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank the 
many original cosponsors of this reso-
lution. There are 60. I would like to 
thank the Human Rights Campaign for 
the work that it has done to help us 
construct this resolution. I would like 
to thank the Center for Transgender 
Equality, the Equality Caucus, and 
Dignity Houston. 
I rise tonight because 51 years ago, 
the Stonewall riots in New York her-
alded in the beginning of the end of a 
shameful period in our history, because 
51 years ago, Madam Speaker, in June 
1969, police raided The Stonewall Inn, a 
gay bar in Greenwich Village, New 
York, causing a civil uprising and 
clashes between the police and thou-
sands of protesters. 
Those historic events catalyzed a 
generation of activists who birthed a 
civil rights movement for LGBTQ 
equality. 
I rise tonight because I am an ally of 
the LGBTQ-plus community. 
I rise tonight because I didn’t get 
here by myself. There were people of 
all stripes who made it possible for me 
to stand here in the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
I rise tonight because 51 years ago 
being 
gay, 
lesbian, 
bisexual, 
or 
transgender was illegal in most States 
in this country. Another way of put-
ting it is this: It was illegal to be who 
you were in this country. 
Fifty-one years ago, no Federal or 
State laws existed to secure the rights 
of lesbian and gay people to live openly 
in a relationship with their partner. 
Fifty-one years ago, no law precluded 
even the most overt discrimination on 
the basis of sexual orientation or gen-
der identity. 
Fifty-one years ago, our legal system 
afforded LGBTQ-plus persons no pro-
tections under the law to live free from 
discrimination 
in 
employment, 
in 
housing, in finance, in education, or in 
healthcare. 
I rise tonight because 51 years ago, 
there were few openly gay politicians 
or public figures in this country. 
I am honored to say that the Honor-
able Barney Frank, whom I served with 
in Congress, has been and continues to 
be a part of this resolution. Each reso-
lution that I have sponsored has hon-
ored the Honorable Barney Frank, a 
Member of Congress from 1981 to 2013, 
and recognized him as an honorary co-
sponsor of this resolution. 
I rise because 51 years ago, being 
openly gay was a finable offense, a 
crime, in many Federal agencies and a 
per se bar to obtaining a Federal secu-
rity clearance. 
But today, thanks to the resolution 
and thanks to the revolution that 
began this month 51 years ago at 
Stonewall, I am proud to say that sev-
eral openly gay persons serve proudly 
on my congressional staff. I am proud 
to have them, and I am proud of the 
work they do. 
Today, I am even more proud that as 
of last Monday, when the Supreme 
Court 
decided 
Bostock 
v. 
Clayton 
County, each member of my staff and 
all LGBTQ persons in the United 
States of America now enjoy the same 
legal protections against employment 
discrimination as all other persons 
without regard to sex, sexual orienta-
tion, or gender identity. 
In that historic 6–3 decision, the 
Bostock court resoundingly affirmed 
that the prohibitions of Title VII bar 
all discrimination in employment on 
the basis of sex, including sexual ori-
entation or gender identity. 
Today, we recall the painful, bloody, 
and often deadly toll of the 51 forma-
tive 
years 
between 
Stonewall 
and 
Bostock. 
Today, we remember each LGBTQ- 
plus victim of discrimination, violence, 
and 
prejudice 
in 
the 
intervening 
years—51 years, I might add—who were 
shut out, subjugated, or even killed. 
Today, we mourn each one of the 
Black transgender women who have 
been murdered in this year alone. 
And today, with consideration of this 
Pride resolution, we continue the tra-
dition that I began as an original spon-
sor of Congress’ Pride Month resolu-
tion. 
I am proud of how far we have come 
as a Nation in our struggle for full 
LGBTQ-plus equality. And in this sea-
son of Pride, it is fitting to celebrate 
that remarkable hard-won progress. 
b 1830 
But today, I also recognize that, al-
though we have come a long way in 51 
years, we still have far to go. Today, 
we must ensure that full inclusion for 
LGBTQ-plus persons does not take an-
other 51 years or even 51 weeks. It is 
now time that we must complete the 
march toward full legal equality for all 
persons, without regard to sexual ori-
entation or gender identity. 
Today, I call upon the Senate to take 
up and pass the Equality Act, H.R. 5, 
without further delay. I am proud to be 
the original sponsor of this resolution. 
I am grateful to all who have become 
original cosponsors. It is not too late 
for persons to cosponsor the resolution, 
and I would beg that persons would do 
so. 
So now, having finished my com-
ments on the Pride Month resolution, I 
would like to step over to the next 
microphone. 
VALUING ORDER AND LAW INSTEAD OF LAW AND 
ORDER 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise because now I must say it was 
most difficult to sit in this House and 
hear some of the comments made by 
my colleagues tonight. They seem to 
value statues above human life. 
All the vandalism and crimes that 
have been committed, I don’t support 
that, and I don’t think that the pro-
testers who were out there peacefully 
protesting supported it either. 
I don’t think you ought to paint all 
protesters with one brush, just as I 
don’t paint all peace officers with one 
brush. I never conclude that all officers 
are bad, but those who are bad ought to 
be punished. 
I find it quite fascinating that my 
colleagues who came here and spoke so 
eloquently tonight, I haven’t heard 
them on the floor in prior times talk-
ing about all of the atrocities being 
committed against people of color at 
the hands of the constabulary. I just 
question why is it that they don’t come 
to the floor and stand up for people of 
color. 
I stand up for all people. It doesn’t 
matter your color, your sex, your sex-
ual orientation. I have been on this 
floor consistently doing this, but I 
don’t see that from the other side. 
I see them here for what I call order 
and law, not law and order, and here is 
how that works: You have a President 
who goes before members of the police 
community, and he says to them: When 
you arrest a person, you don’t have to 
be so nice. 
Now, he is talking about a person 
who is in the care, custody, and control 
of the police, and that person does not 
have to be treated so nice. 
He sent a message. That message 
was, you maintain order, do whatever 
you have got to do, and I will provide 
the law to support you. That is order 
and law. 
I support law and order. I have an 
uncle who was a deputy sheriff. He in-
fluenced my life. I am probably in Con-
gress today because of words that he 
spoke to me, so I support policing. I 
understand the necessity to have per-
sons who are going to assure us that we 
can be protected. 
But what I don’t support is a belief 
that peaceful protesters are all some-
how a part of a mob. You can peace-
fully protest and go to jail. I know; I 
have been there. I was there with the 
Honorable JOHN LEWIS. We were peace-
fully protesting, but we went to jail. 
Peaceful protesters go to jail. Peace-
ful protesters get in the way. Peaceful 
protesters disrupt. That is what protest

is about. If people don’t get uncomfort-
able, then your protest has accom-
plished very little. 
Dr. King was in jail when he wrote 
the letter from the Birmingham jail. 
He was peacefully protesting, but he 
went to jail. It happens. That is a part 
of the protest movement. 
When I went out to protest, knowing 
that I would likely go to jail, I had 
somebody to post my bail. 
Peaceful protest does not mean that 
you are not disruptive. It means that 
you have a message that has to be 
heard. As Dr. King put it, protests can 
be the language of the unheard, peace-
ful protest especially. 
So I am here to say to my colleagues, 
I regret that you cannot see the hurt 
that is being felt by people of color. 
I don’t understand why my tax dol-
lars have to support a statue along 
some thoroughfare of Robert E Lee. 
You can have it. Take it to a museum. 
Tuck it away for whatever purposes 
you like. But you don’t have to impose 
it upon me. 
We don’t allow—or, more appro-
priately, Germany does not have stat-
ues of Hitler in the public squares. And 
I refuse to stand by and allow statues 
of people who wanted to keep my an-
cestors in chains, in slavery, which is a 
nice way of saying rape, murder, kid-
napping, stripping babies from their 
parents, and sending the parents one 
way and the children another. It is too 
nice a word for what happened to my 
ancestors. 
So, I am not going to celebrate them. 
I have never celebrated them, and it is 
time to remove them. 
I am not going to go out and pull one 
over and push it off into some corner. 
But I don’t see my colleagues helping 
with the means by which they can be 
removed, and you take them and put 
them wherever you would like to have 
them. I have no problem with your 
ownership of them, but don’t expect me 
to celebrate them and have my tax dol-
lars take care of them. 
There was one in my congressional 
district, a Confederate soldier named 
Dowling. It has been removed, and I am 
proud to know that was removed. 
So I rise now, as I close, to say just 
simply this: I love my country. I love 
my country. I love it because of many 
of the good things that have happened 
to me. But I also love it in spite of 
many of the things that were not ap-
propriate that have occurred. And I 
will continue to love my country. 
But I refuse to accept symbols of rac-
ism and hate. I will never honor them, 
and I would badly have my colleagues 
take them to some other place out of 
the public square. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

HONORING LUKE MARCHANT’S 
40TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor a very special constituent of 
the 24th Congressional District, my son, Luke 
Beckett Marchant. Tomorrow, Luke celebrates 
his 40th birthday with his wife, Katie, and their 
two young children, Walker Ross and Carter 
Bailey. 
While working in Austin in an internship dur-
ing college, he worked for Senator Ken 
Armbrister. After learning the ropes in the 
Texas Senate, he shifted gears to run and 
manage the race for Texas Agriculture Com-
missioner Todd Staples. 
Luke graduated from Southern Nazarene 
University in Bethany, Oklahoma, in 2003 with 
a bachelor’s degree in Political Science and 
promptly came up to Washington, D.C., in 
hopes of finding himself a job in public serv-
ice. I offered to put Luke up at the Pentagon 
Days Inn in Arlington, VA, for two weeks while 
he hit the pavement on Capitol Hill in hopes 
of landing a job as a recent college graduate. 
After wearing out considerable shoe leather, 
Luke was hired to work in the mail room for 
Senator JOHN CORNYN and later learned every 
street in the nation’s capital while navigating 
the Senator around town as his driver. He 
quickly rose up through the ranks while never 
forgetting that he came to work each day to 
better serve the people of Texas to the best 
of his ability. 
Luke’s passion for political life has taken 
him from Maine to Kentucky; Florida to our 
Lone Star State. He would go on to work for 
our colleagues Congressman PETE OLSON and 
Senator MARCO RUBIO. I’m fiercely proud to 
note that he also worked for Texas Attorney 
General and now Governor Greg Abbott. 
Even though Luke has journeyed across our 
great country, it was deep in the heart of 
Texas, working on PETE OLSON’s first run for 
Congress, when Luke got luckiest. There he 
met his future wife, Katie, and it changed his 
life. I’m so proud of the man he has become 
and the family he and Katie have built. l look 
forward to spending more time with them and 
their children at our ranch. 
Since December 2016, Luke has served as 
Vice President for Hill and Knowlton Strategies 
in Dallas, Texas. I would like to say that I 
taught him everything that he knows, but that 
hasn’t been true for a very long time. Now-
adays he has been teaching his old man plen-
ty. 
I wish Luke a wonderful last day of his 30s 
today, and ask all of my colleagues to join this 
proud father in wishing him a very happy 40th 
birthday tomorrow. 
COMMEMORATING NASA WALLOPS 
FLIGHT FACILITY’S 75TH ANNI-
VERSARY 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize the 75th anniversary of 
the first launch at NASA Wallops Flight Facil-
ity. 
As the only Member of Congress to rep-
resent two NASA facilities, I am honored to 
share with Congress this historic achievement. 
The Wallops Flight Facility, established in 
1945 by the National Advisory Committee for 
Aeronautics, NASA’s predecessor, has sup-
ported government and commercial scientific 
discovery and exploration missions, contrib-
uted significantly to the Eastern Shore com-
munity, and expedited our nation’s techno-
logical advancements. Wallops employs over 
1,000 individuals and is home to NASA’s only 
owned rocket launch range for suborbital and 
orbital rockets. During its creation, Wallops Is-
land was sought out by the scientific agency 
for multiple reasons, including its proximity to 
another NASA facility and a military base. 
Wallops was established initially for guided 
missile flight research, but since then has ex-
panded to a diverse and multifaceted mission. 
On June 27, 1945, the original team launched 
its first test for the radar systems on their 
small rockets. While the first launch at Wallops 
consisted of very few resources and tech-
nology, this kickstarted an enduring and crit-
ical NASA facility. From that day, NASA Wal-
lops continued to grow, and now the facility is 
worth over $1 billion. 
Wallops has undertaken a multitude of mis-
sions, such as supporting aircraft research, 
launching rockets and scientific balloons, and 
enabling critical research aboard the Inter-
national Space Station, which have improved 
our nation’s understanding of space and be-
yond. NASA Wallops has led our country and 
the world in providing flight and launch range 
services and more generally meeting the 
needs in the science, aerospace, defense, and 
commercial industries. I am honored to recog-
nize the hard-working men and women at 
NASA Wallops and to commemorate this im-
portant day in history.

RECOGNIZING LINDA ROST OF 
BAKER 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, Mon-
tana has some of the best, brightest, most in-
novative educators in our country, and our stu-
dents are better for it. I rise today to honor 
one of the best, Linda Rost of Baker who’s 
recognized for her dedication to students and 
for her outstanding accomplishments in edu-
cation. 
Linda loves rural living and that’s why Baker 
is her perfect fit. She enjoys the culture and 
the pride people have living in a small commu-
nity. She says, when there’s crummy winter 
weather, everyone goes through it together, 
and the community grows stronger and closer. 
Her extended family lives in nearby Willard. 
Linda feels a deep connection to the area. 
When a teacher is linked to her community 
that much, she can more easily relate to the 
kids and make a lasting difference in their 
lives. 
While attending New Mexico State Univer-
sity, Linda started studying to be a scientist, 
but soon found the lab lonely and boring. She 
noticed she enjoyed tutoring and began taking 
education classes. That’s when she realized 
where her passions lie and what she truly 
wanted to do. Fast forward to today, she 
earned two master’s degrees in education 
from Montana State University, and is working 
on a Ph.D. in Curriculum and Instruction with 
a specialization in Science, Technology, Engi-
neering and Mathematics at Texas Tech Uni-
versity. 
Linda teaches biology, AP biology, chem-
istry, anatomy and physiology, and science re-
search at Baker High School, the same high 
school her father went to. She says it’s really 
exciting to see her students pick a research 
project they’re passionate about, lead it to 
completion, and find themselves along the 
way. Many of Linda’s students have competed 
in national and international science competi-
tions. 
Two recent graduates of Baker High School 
conducted innovative, cutting-edge research. 
One student studied breast cancer signs and 
tested novel drugs used on brain cancer. He 
conducted weekly Skype sessions with sci-
entists and got good results. 
Another student wanted to make a bio-
degradable wrap for hay bales. She produced 
a bioplastic for the bales out of algae—strong-
er than the usual wrap—and after two weeks, 
it degraded slowly while maintaining its 
strength. 
Linda calls herself a ‘‘guide,’’ but she is so 
much more. Linda serves as an inspiration for 
her students. 
Linda is the 2020 Montana Teacher of the 
Year, and she was one of four finalists for 
2020 National Teacher of the Year, which is 
run by the Council of Chief State School Offi-
cers. 
Teaching is Linda’s passion, and Montana is 
better for it, Madam Speaker, for her commit-
ment to education, her exceptional, engaging 
science instruction, and her lasting impact on 
students.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF SMSGT JEAN J. HAMILTON 
HON. ADAM KINZINGER 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. KINZINGER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the life and service of Sen-
ior Master Sergeant Jean J. ‘‘JJ’’ Hamilton 
who passed away on May 10, 2020. Jean en-
listed into the Air Force in 1960 and remained 
for twenty-eight years, dedicating his career to 
serving our country. 
While in the Air Force, Jean was a flight at-
tendant with the Presidential Fleet, serving five 
Presidents, many dignitaries, and Heads of 
State. As a Noncommissioned Officer in 
charge of the VC–137 and VC–135 Flight At-
tendants of the Presidential support program 
and as a Flight Examiner, Jean was respon-
sible for over 100 Flight Attendants operating 
both Air Force One and Air Force Two. Addi-
tionally, Jean served in the U.S. State Depart-
ment as Special Assistant to Secretary James 
A. Baker in the George H.W. Bush Administra-
tion. 
Throughout his service, Jean attended the 
NCO Leadership School, NCO Academy, and 
the Senior NCO Academy to further his mili-
tary career. Due to his hard work, leadership, 
and dedication, Jean received numerous 
awards while in the Air Force. Jean was hon-
orably discharged on August 1, 1988. 
Aside from his military service, Jean was a 
true family man who dearly loved his wife 
Mea, children Orlando and Yvonne, and all of 
his family and friends. He also loved to serve 
others and was a faithful member to Pastor 
John A. Cherry, at From the Heart Ministries. 
Jean served as a chef for the Christian school 
and was on the Ministry of Helps Committee. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the 16th Dis-
trict of Illinois, I want to express my condo-
lences, but encourage family, friends, and the 
community to celebrate the life of Jean Ham-
ilton and his service to this great nation.

HONORING THE ROTARY CLUB OF 
WAYNESBORO 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, it is my honor to recognize the Rotary Club 
of Waynesboro, Pennsylvania for its century of 
service. Chartered on April 22, 1920, the club 
has marked 100 years of dedication to the 
Waynesboro community. 
During its many years of service, the Rotary 
Club of Waynesboro has been instrumental in 
a number of important community achieve-
ments, including the organization of a summer 
youth baseball organization later known as 
Waynesboro Little League, the initiation of a 
dental education program in Waynesboro 
Schools, and the introduction of a community- 
wide Easter Seals program, among many ad-
ditional accomplishments. Its long record of 
service has left a profound legacy in Waynes-
boro and Franklin County. 
On behalf of the 13th District of Pennsyl-
vania, I thank the members of the Rotary Club 
of Waynesboro for their tireless commitment 
and hard work to continue the legacy of this 
outstanding organization. As the club cele-
brates its 100th anniversary, I look forward to 
its many years of service to come and wish 
these Pennsylvanians every continued suc-
cess.

RECOGNIZING CRAFT SPIRITS 
WEEK 2020 
HON. PETER WELCH 
OF VERMONT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. WELCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
during Craft Spirits Week to show my support 
for the more than 2,000 craft distilleries across 
the United States that support our vibrant tour-
ism and hospitality industries, countless jobs, 
local farmers and manufacturers, and the larg-
er economy. Vermont is home to a few of 
these companies and they are a wonderful ad-
dition to our vibrant tourism economy. 
Recent events surrounding COVID–19 have 
put an unprecedented burden on our craft dis-
tillers. According to a survey conducted by the 
Distilled Spirits Council of the United States 
and American Distilling Institute, approximately 
43 percent of distillery employees have been 
let go or furloughed since the start of the 
COVID–19 crisis, bringing the average number 
of a respondent’s employees from 14 down to 
8. On average, distilleries reported a 64 per-
cent sales decline. Two-thirds of respondents 
did not believe they will be able to sustain 
their businesses for more than 6 months, 
while almost half did not anticipate being able 
to sustain their businesses for more than 3 
months. 
Many were forced to close their doors to the 
public, but instead of closing shop entirely, 
craft distillers in every single state altered their 
business plans to help address the nationwide 
shortage of hand sanitizer. In the greatest time 
of need, craft distillers showed up for their fel-
low Americans without hesitation with many 
even donating their products to first respond-
ers. In Vermont, our distilleries pivoted quickly 
when the COVID–19 pandemic hit and even 
provided sanitizer to businesses and domestic 
violence shelters. 
The economic hardships caused by this 
pandemic have been immediate and will last 
well beyond the end of COVID. The losses 
they have suffered over the last couple of 
months can never be fully recouped. That is 
why we need to come together to support 
these local businesses. 
These businesses don’t operate in a vacu-
um, but in an ecosystem that support dozens 
of other businesses. The livelihoods of farm-
ers, glass bottle makers, truck drivers, ware-
house workers, and countless others con-
nected to the hospitality and tourism industries 
are also compromised by the challenges con-
fronting the distilled spirits industry. With distill-
eries located in every state in the nation, this 
should cause great concern for each member 
of Congress. 
I urge all my colleagues to take time to visit 
with and talk to the distillers in their districts to 
show their support for these small businesses 
during Craft Spirits Week. Distillers, like other 
businesses, need our support during this time. 
I look forward to working with my colleagues 
as well to support distillers and those in the 
hospitality sector who have been significantly 
impacted by the COVID–19 crisis.

IN MEMORY OF MR. ANDRE MOSES 
WHITE 
HON. SANFORD D. BISHOP, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, it 
is with a heavy heart and solemn remem-
brance that I rise today to pay tribute to an ac-
complished businessman, athlete, artist, and 
dear friend of longstanding—Mr. Andre Moses 
White. Sadly, Mr. White passed away on 
Tuesday, June 9, 2020, from complications 
with COVID–19. A memorial service honoring 
his life was held on Saturday, June 20, 2020, 
at 11:00 am at the Georgia International Con-
vention Center in College Park, Georgia. 
Andre Moses White (affectionately known as 
‘‘Moses’’ to his family, friends, and colleagues) 
was born in Winter Park, Florida, to the union 
of the late Moses and Lucille White. He was 
born on October 7, 1944, and was the young-
est of three sons. 
He attended Middleton High School in 
Tampa, Florida, and Lincoln High School in 
Tallahassee, Florida. After graduating high 
school, he attended Florida Agricultural & Me-
chanical University (FAMU), where he re-
ceived a Bachelor of Science in Physical Edu-
cation and played as a Tight End under 
FAMU’s legendary coach, Jake Gaither. 
Upon graduation, Moses was drafted by the 
Denver Broncos, thus beginning his career in 
the National Football League, where he also 
played for the San Diego Chargers and was 
one of the first African Americans to sign with 
the Cincinnati Bengals. 
Following a career-ending injury, he re-
turned to Tampa, Florida, and became the 
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
Officer for Hillsborough County, where he is 
most well-known for fighting to remove the 
confederate flag from the county seal—a feat 
that was finally accomplished in 2015. 
Moses continued his father’s legacy in food 
and music by overseeing the family’s historic 
restaurant, Moses White’s Cozy Corner BBQ 
restaurant, and by working in the entertain-
ment industry alongside icons such as Marvin 
Gaye and James Brown. Later on, at the age 
of 71, Moses went on to release two digital 
singles titled ‘‘We’re Americans’’ and ‘‘My 
Man’’ under the name ‘‘Moses White.’’ 
After moving to Atlanta in 1988, he and his 
son, Andre, started The Georgia Sentinel, a 
progressive news outlet for Atlanta’s African 
American community. While laying his founda-
tion there, he served as the President of the 
Auburn Avenue Merchants Association, where 
he re-established the Auburn Avenue Festival 
(a pre-cursor to Music Midtown), which hosted 
the return of James Brown and the Famous 
Flames for a free reunion concert for the com-
munity. 
Moses cared about his community and was 
always engaged in organizations that did posi-
tive work. His most notable roles were as the 
Founder and President of the Moses White 
Foundation, which strives to improve the qual-
ity of life for the underprivileged in Tampa 
through education, community revitalization,

and individual empowerment; as a Board 
Member of Wayfield Foods, where he played 
Wayfield’s Santa Clause for nearly 30 years 
and brought joy to thousands of inner-city kids 
and their families during the holidays; and as 
a cherished member of the National Grocers 
Association, which is in the process of devel-
oping a scholarship fund in his name to ben-
efit young African-Americans seeking a career 
in food retail. 
Maya Angelou once said, ‘‘A great soul 
serves everyone all the time. A great soul 
never dies.’’ Andre Moses White is undoubt-
edly great because of his distinguished service 
to his community, devotion to his craft, and 
the compassion he showed for his friends and 
loved ones. 
Moses accomplished much in his life, but 
none of this would have been possible without 
the Grace of God; the love and support of his 
late wife, Joyce; his children, Andre, Andrea, 
Richard, and Raulnin˘a; and a host of family, 
friends, and loved ones who will miss him 
deeply. 
On a personal note, I will always cherish the 
friendship my wife and I shared with Moses 
and Joyce. They were both very special peo-
ple and we enjoyed every opportunity we had 
to fellowship together. The kindness of their 
spirits truly revealed the timbre of their char-
acter. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
my wife, Vivian, and me, along with the more 
than 730,000 residents of Georgia’s Second 
Congressional District, in paying tribute to Mr. 
Andre Moses White and in extending our 
deepest sympathies to his family, friends, and 
loved ones during this difficult time of bereave-
ment. Moreover, we pray that we will all be 
consoled and comforted by an abiding faith 
and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, and 
months ahead.

2020 RBC HERITAGE PRESENTED 
BY BOEING TOURNAMENT 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, on Sunday Webb Simpson stunned 
the golf world with birdies on five of his last 
seven holes at the 2020 RBC Heritage Pre-
sented by Boeing Tournament on Hilton Head 
Island, South Carolina, edging Abraham Ancer 
by one stroke. 
Played over the Harbour Town Golf Links 
since 1969 the event is celebrating its 52nd 
year envisioned by the late Charles Fraser for 
Sea Pines. The inaugural champion was Ar-
nold Palmer. It created a platform of celebra-
tion and a marketing tool to introduce Hilton 
Head Island (the second largest island after 
Long Island on the Atlantic) to the world, 
named the No. 1 Island in the United States 
by Travel and Leisure Magazine. 
With an economic impact of over $102 mil-
lion now annually, the Heritage Classic Foun-
dation with J. Simon Fraser as Chairman and 
Cary Corbitt as 2020 Tournament Chairman; 
has since 1987, distributed $44.6 million to 
persons in need throughout South Carolina 
and Georgia for charitable organizations, the 
arts, medical institutions, and for college 
scholarships. 
The Island Packet with Stephen Fastenau 
provided proactive coverage with a photo of 
PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan talking 
with Heritage Classic Foundation President 
Steve Wilmot, Hilton Head Assistant Town 
Manager Josh Gruber, Town Manager Steve 
Riley, and Mayor John McCann at the Harbour 
Town Golf Links. The RBC Heritage is broad-
cast in 23 languages to 226 countries outside 
the United States. More than 1 billion house-
holds across the world could see the Harbour 
Town’s famous candy cane striped lighthouse. 
The Tournament is traditionally kicked off 
with a procession from the Lighthouse at the 
Marina led by bagpipers from The Citadel of 
Charleston. The first stroke is by the prior 
year’s winner using an antique club from the 
Course of St. Andrews which had been pro-
vided by the First Secretary of Scotland 
(Prime Minister) Alex Salmond during a pres-
entation ceremony at the U.S. Capitol steps 
coordinated by Congressman JOE WILSON (R– 
SC) who was gratefully wearing the Heritage 
Tartan plaid blazer. 
A highlight of the Tournament is a Saturday 
flyover of a Boeing 787 Dreamliner or 
Dreamlifter over the famed eighteenth fairway. 
The world-class jetliner is manufactured at the 
Boeing facilities in Charleston which was 
toured last month by Boeing President David 
Calhoun who provided three cargo shipments 
of personal protective equipment to Governor 
Henry McMaster and Medical University of 
South Caroline President David Cole to com-
bat the virus pandemic. 
The Tournament is in recognition of the first 
golf course in the New World established in 
the Province of South Carolina by immigrants 
from Scotland.

TRISOMY 13 AWARENESS 
HON. DUSTY JOHNSON 
OF SOUTH DAKOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Madam 
Speaker, I include in the RECORD my con-
stituent, 
Belle 
Lunders 
proclamation 
on 
Trisomy 13 awareness. 
I thank Belle Lunders for sharing the signifi-
cance of Trisomy 13 awareness. 
Trisomy 13 is a chromosomal disorder 
where the 13th pair of chromosomes have an 
extra copy creating three chromosomes. 
Trisomy 13 is the least common and most se-
vere of the feasible autosomal trisomies. Me-
dian survival is fewer than three days. It af-
fects one in every 8,000 to 12,000 live births. 
Babies born with Trisomy 13 can have many 
health problems and more than 80 percent 
don’t survive more than a few weeks. Be-
tween 86 percent and 91 percent of live births 
do not live past their first year. Survival be-
yond the first year is associated with mosai-
cism. There is no cure for Trisomy 13 but dif-
ferent treatments depend on the symptoms. 
In most cases surgery and therapy are the 
best 
options. 
Prenatal 
testing 
and 
ultrasound can confirm a Trisomy 13 diag-
nosis through amniocentesis. 
CELEBRATING AIMEE STEPHENS 
HON. HALEY M. STEVENS 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Ms. STEVENS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in memory of the incredible Aimee Ste-
phens, who passed away on May 12 at the 
age of 59. 
Aimee was born on December 7, 1960, in 
Fayetteville, N.C. She graduated from Mars 
Hill University in 1984 with a degree in reli-
gious education and obtained a degree in 
mortuary science from Fayetteville Technical 
Community College in 1988. 
In 2013, she was fired from her job as a fu-
neral director in suburban Detroit after she an-
nounced that she would begin living as a 
woman. After filing a complaint against her 
employer with the federal Equal Employment 
Opportunity Commission, Aimee’s case began 
its long journey through the United States 
court system. In April of 2019, the Supreme 
Court agreed to hear the case on the question 
of whether the Civil Rights Act of 1964 pro-
tects transgender people from workplace dis-
crimination. 
On June 15, 2020, shortly after Aimee’s 
passing, the Court ruled that the Civil Rights 
Act protects gay, lesbian, and transgender 
employees from discrimination based on sex. 
The ruling was 6–3, with Justice Neil Gorsuch 
writing the majority opinion. 
Aimee’s story is one of courage and for-
titude. We owe her immense gratitude for her 
bravery in standing up for the equal rights of 
the L.G.B.T.Q. community nationwide. Her 
sacrifice in the name of progress and inclusion 
will not be forgotten; she will be remembered 
for her enduring hope. 
Aimee spent her final days at her home in 
Redford Township, Michigan, of Congress-
woman TLAIB’s District. She is survived by her 
wife, Donna, and their daughter, Elizabeth. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in reflecting on the remarkable life of 
Aimee Stephens: a hero in the fight for equal 
rights in America.

Friday, June 26, 2020

family of Mr. Jack Alexander Thompson from 
Montgomery, 
Alabama. 
Jack 
Thompson 
passed away on Sunday after a full life of 
eighty-eight years. He was an upstanding cit-
izen of our state and a respected member of 
the Montgomery community. 
Jack Thompson was an Alabamian through 
and through, as he was born in Colbert Coun-
ty in 1932 and remained in the state his entire 
life. After graduating from Colbert County High 
School, Jack Thompson married his sweet-
heart, Ruth Hester, at the age of twenty. Jack 
and Ruth were married for sixty-seven years 
and raised four wonderful children, which led 
to the additional joy of having grandchildren

and great-grandchildren. As a student, Jack 
dedicated his studies to agriculture, which is 
evident that it played a big role in his life for 
as long as he lived. He earned his B.S. in Ag-
riculture from Auburn University and his mas-
ter’s in animal science from the University of 
Tennessee. If it was not clear before these de-
grees, it was clear afterwards—Jack was 
going to make a difference in agriculture and 
better the lives of many people along the way. 
For the following thirty-one years Jack 
worked for the Auburn University Extension 
Service, where he engaged with 4–H students, 
Cattlemen, and Agronomy farmers in Mont-
gomery, Elmore, and Limestone counties. 
After retiring, Jack went on to own a farm in 
Athens, Alabama and served as the Assistant 
Commissioner of Agriculture before assuming 
the role of Commissioner of Agriculture and 
Industries for four years. Jack also combined 
his two passions, agriculture and Auburn Uni-
versity, and lobbied for financing to construct 
the Ag and Industries Thompson Bishop 
Sparks Diagnostic Lab on Auburn’s campus. 
This was quite the undertaking, but Jack got 
it done, and he went on to do much more. 
As a volunteer, Jack Thompson’s list of 
service roles is incredible. He was president of 
the Athens-Limestone Chamber of Commerce; 
Campaign Chairman of the United Way; presi-
dent of the Limestone County Cattlemen’s As-
sociation, a lifetime Director of the State 
Cattlemen’s Association; a lifetime member of 
the Athens Industrial Development Associa-
tion; and was a board member at the Salva-
tion Army. Jack also worked with 4–H kids in 
coordinating with state, district, and local steer 
shows and managed livestock for what is now 
the Alabama National Fair. 
Jack Thompson is now survived by his four 
children; David Thompson, Keith Thompson, 
Susan Woodham, and Janice Thompson. In 
addition, he is survived by his sister, Ann 
Thomas, and his eleven grandchildren and 
seven great-grandchildren. 
It is with a heavy heart for the family of Mr. 
Jack Thompson and the community of Mont-
gomery, Alabama that I recognize the life of 
Mr. Jack Thompson. His legacy will live on 
well into the future.

HONORING THE LIFE OF MR. 
CHRISTOPHER EDMOND ANGELO 
HON. TED LIEU 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. TED LIEU of California. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the life of Mr. Chris-
topher Edmond Angelo, a beloved member of 
California’s 33rd Congressional District, who 
passed away at the age of 70 on May 19, 
2020. With decades of legal advocacy on be-
half of consumer and patient rights, Chris 
helped to further the protections of the most 
vulnerable in our community. 
Born on December 19, 1949 in Los Ange-
les, California, Chris attended Hollywood High 
School, the University of California, Riverside, 
where he sat on the Board of Trustees for 
several years, and Loyola Law School. After 
graduating law school, Chris began his career 
as a defense attorney at Spray, Gould & Bow-
ers and later moved on to representing plain-
tiffs at Gage, Mazury, Schwartz, Angelo & 
Kussman. In 1988, he and his partners formed 
Mazurky, Schwartz & Angelo and in 2003, he 
formed a partnership in Manhattan Beach with 
Joseph DiMonda. 
Throughout his legal career, Chris’ legal 
work helped to expand the rights of patients to 
ensure the medical field prioritized patient care 
before profit and established duties on the part 
of commercial and industrial landowners to in-
spect for safety and toxic environmental haz-
ards. This work also led to more oversight of 
insurance companies by expanding the ability 
of policyholders to discover insurer internal 
loss reserves and reinsurance records when 
suing for unfair claims practices. Additionally, 
Chris fought against jury nullification and spo-
liation of evidence, in order to help expand 
fairness and accountability both in and outside 
of the court room. 
Chris was also a fierce advocate for parents 
of children with developmental disabilities. 
With his legal background, he taught both par-
ents and institutions how to effectuate insur-
ance coverage for their children and patients 
with disabilities. Through innumerable hours 
counseling parents, and producing and donat-
ing a booklet called ‘‘For Our Children: A Law-
yer’s Guide to Insurance Coverage and a Par-
ent’s Call to Organize’’ (1998), Chris helped to 
educate communities on holding insurance 
communities accountable, while bolstering the 
rights of individuals and families with children 
with disabilities. 
Chris is survived by his wife of 40 years, 
Patti; son Alexander; sister Juliet; and brother 
Mark; beloved brothers and sisters-in-laws; 13 
nieces and 22 great nieces and nephews. May 
his compassion, leadership, and devotion to 
protecting the rights of the most vulnerable 
continue to live on in the fight for a more equi-
table and just world.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF DR. 
JAMES HENRY NEELY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Dr. James 
Henry Neely, who passed away on Tuesday, 
June 23, at Baptist Memorial Hospital in Ox-
ford, Mississippi. 
Dr. Neely was born on August 8, 1932, in 
West Point, Mississippi. His many accomplish-
ments began at Mary Holmes College High 
School. He was the editor of the school news-
paper, secretary of the senior class, president 
of the athletic club and, member at large of 
the Student Council. He then took his suc-
cesses to Kentucky State University, earning a 
degree in chemistry and a minor in math and 
French. 
His passion for chemistry and academia 
lead Dr. Neely to Meharry Medical College in 
1960, where he received his Doctor of Medi-
cine degree. After graduation, he took his 
leadership skills and medical expertise to the 
United States Air Force. He earned the rank of 
Captain and served as a Flight Surgeon sta-
tioned in El Paso, Texas, and Belleville, Illi-
nois. 
Dr. Neely’s achievements didn’t stop there. 
After an honorable discharge from the military 
in 1964, he relocated to Tupelo, Mississippi, to 
set up his medical practice. He served his 
community in medical practice for 35 years. 
He was the first African American doctor to 
have full hospital privileges of admitting and 
treating patients at the North Mississippi Med-
ical Center. This was only the beginning of his 
successes in the medical field. He would go 
on to earn the Mississippi Medical and Sur-
gical Award as Practitioner of the Year and 
the Meharry Medical College Distinguished 
Service Award for 25 years of service. Out of 
all of his accomplishments, however, Dr. 
Neely claimed his greatest achievement was 
his marriage to Elaine Kilgore for 66 years. 
Outside of the medical profession, Dr. Neely 
held memberships in numerous organizations 
including the National Medical Association, 
The Black Business Association of Mississippi, 
the NAACP, and was a member of the West 
Point Trinity United Presbyterian Church. 
Dr. Neely was not only a prominent figure in 
the medical field but in his community as well. 
He served as a member of the Board of Direc-
tors Community Development Foundation. He 
was involved in Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Boy 
Scouts of America, Tupelo UNCF, Good Sa-
maritan Health Services and, St. Paul Out-
reach Boys Home. 
Left to cherish his memory is his wife, 
Elaine; his son and my friend, mentor, col-
league, and Assistant District Attorney in my 
office Brian Neely; his daughter, acclaimed 
poet and Goodwill Ambassador for the state of 
Mississippi Patricia Neely-Dorsey; his four 
grandchildren, and many other friends and ex-
tended family members. 
Dr. Neely’s life was one of service, grace, 
and love for his family and community. He will 
be greatly missed by all whom he encoun-
tered. In today’s world, we should all look to-
wards Dr. Neely as an example of how to 
make desired change by way of public serv-
ice.

who passed away on June 15, 2020 at the 
age of 81. 
Mr. Thompson was a pharmacist by profes-
sion and a leader in the business community. 
In 1965, he founded Thompson Pharmacy in 
Juniata, PA. In time, Thompson Pharmacy ex-
panded to multiple locations in central Penn-
sylvania. Additionally, Mr. Thompson served 
as treasurer and vice president of Value Drug, 
a cooperative of independent pharmacies in 
the Altoona area, for nearly 50 years. 
In recognition of his service and dedication, 
Mr. Thompson was honored with a number of 
awards. In 2004, the School of Pharmacy at 
the University of Pittsburgh presented him 
their Distinguished Alumni Award. He was also 
the 2014 recipient of the Blair County Cham-
ber of Commerce’s Lifetime Achievement 
Award. 
Bill Thompson was an incredible advocate 
for central Pennsylvania, and his work made 
Blair County a better place. On behalf of the 
13th District of Pennsylvania, I extend my con-
dolences to Mr. Thompson’s family, friends, 
neighbors, and colleagues.

HONORING UOFSC ALUMNUS, JOHN 
CARRINGTON 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, a constituent of the South Carolina’s 
Second Congressional Distict and Univesity of 
South Carolina alumnus, John Carrington, has 
answered the call to help with the COVID–19 
pandemic. John is the CEO of ZVerse, a dig-
ital manufacturing technology company based 
in Columbia, South Carolina, that is known for 
making 3D printing software. As the lack of 
personal 
protection 
equipment 
began 
to 
plague healthcare providers, ZVerse took ini-
tiative to transform operations to address the 
needs of these essential workers. 
First starting with 3D printing and then shift-
ing to the process of injection molding, ZVerse 
was able to create a large number of medical 
shields at an affordable price. By early June, 
ZVerse produced and shipped 4 million reus-
able protective face shields for health care 
workers with an additional 3 million more to 
follow. These shields shipped nationwide to 
recipients who need them most, ranging from 
local municipalities to the U.S. Department of 
Veterans Affairs. 
ZVerse has now become the largest manu-
facturer in the country of reusable protective 
face shields and is now working to address 
the needs for workers outside of healthcare in 
need for this protection, such as restaurants 
and grocery stores. ZVerse has now doubled 
the amount of its employees and expects to 
continue growing in the coming year. 
South Carolinians appreciate John for his 
leadership and active response to the pan-
demic and wish him continued success. 
A special thanks to Megan Sexton at the 
University of South Carolina for covering this 
story and sharing the positive impacts of 
UofSC alumni.

GEORGE FLOYD JUSTICE IN 
POLICING ACT OF 2020 
SPEECH OF 
HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, June 25, 2020 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, nearly a month 
ago, our nation watched in horror as a white 
Minneapolis, MN police officer murdered 
George Floyd. His murder, and those of 
Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbury, Rayshard 
Brooks, and far too many others, serve as a 
sobering reminder of the original sin on which 
our nation has been built—the brutal legacy of 
slavery, segregation, oppression, and discrimi-
nation spanning more than 400 years. 
In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, 
thousands of Americans peacefully assembled 
in every state and the District of Columbia to 
exercise their First Amendment rights to pro-
test and petition their government for change. 
My hometown, which has a proud tradition of 
civic participation and free speech expression, 
saw the largest protest in our history as resi-
dents demanded immediate justice and re-
form. 
On Tuesday, June 23, I held a listening ses-
sion with Black Lives Matter activists, commu-
nity organizers, and local officials to discuss 
systemic racism, police brutality, and what it 
will take to heal the deep wounds that still ail 
our nation. This session was powerful and 
moving, cementing my commitment to the 
eradication of racism in every corner of the 
nation. Racism is present in nearly every insti-
tution, every system. 
One individual, whose family has lived in 
Oregon for generations, shared her family’s 
experience growing up in segregated Eugene, 
OR. Her mother’s two sisters, only four and 
six years old, were hit by a fast-moving vehi-
cle and when community members called for 
help, no ambulance came. They both died. 
Why? Because the victims were two black 
girls. They were seen as less than human, 
and our public safety response treated them 
like they were. Racism is present in our public 
safety and emergency response. 
A member of the CAHOOTS Crisis Re-
sponse team also joined our discussion. CA-
HOOTS is a nonprofit in our district which pro-
vides mental health crisis intervention. Last 
year alone, CAHOOTS responded to roughly 
20 percent of the area’s 911 and public safety 
calls. 
She shared how just a few weeks ago, she 
convinced an armed black man in crisis—sur-
rounded by armed police—to disarm himself. 
She then escorted him to her van, uncuffed, 
and helped him receive the mental health 
intervention he needed. CAHOOTS is a model 
for what our future public safety response 
could look like, and heroes like her exemplify 
how an armed response may not always be 
the best or most appropriate response. 
One activist spoke about her experience 
with racism in professional spaces. She told 
me about how her identity as a Black woman 
made her supervisors scrutinize her work 
more heavily and less willing to help when 
employees of color were dealing with personal 
struggles. Racism is present in our work-
places. 
One community leader, joined by a separate 
activist, discussed disparities in mental health 
and how our healthcare system often fails 
Black Americans and people of color. They 
called for the creation of institutions that spe-
cialize in delivering mental health care to peo-
ple of color because it’s clear: racism is 
present in our healthcare system and its con-
sequences can be fatal. 
Racism is present in nearly every sector of 
American life, and everywhere around our na-
tion, including in the progressive communities 
of Eugene and Springfield, where I call home. 
It is abundantly clear we have reached a tip-
ping point. Americans will no longer tolerate 
antiquated systems of oppression. They are 
demanding that their government act, and I 
have heard their calls. I am committed to 
proactively working to dismantle institutional 
racism and oppression. It will take anti-racist 
policy and direct action to finally exorcise 
these evils and heal the wounds they created. 
We must rethink and reform our institutions. 
The Justice in Policing Act is a critical first 
step; but make no mistake, much more work 
needs to be done. We must look at increasing 
funding for alternative public safety programs. 
We must fight racism in every corner of the 
country. It is a cancer. Too long it has been 
ignored and allowed to grow and divide out of 
control. We must, and we will, take a stand 
here and now. Enough is enough. 
TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE J. ‘‘BUD’’ 
BROWN, JR. 
HON. JIM JORDAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I am hon-
ored to commend to the House the admirable 
service of former Congressman Clarence J. 
‘‘Bud’’ Brown, Jr., on the occasion of his 93rd 
birthday on June 18. 
Born in Columbus in 1927, Bud spent much 
of his youth in Washington, D.C., where his fa-
ther, the late former Congressman Clarence J. 
Brown, Sr., represented Ohio’s Seventh Con-
gressional District from 1939 to 1965. Bud 
succeeded his father, serving in this House 
with distinction from 1965 to 1983. He was 
then selected by President Reagan to serve 
as the nation’s fifth Deputy Secretary of Com-
merce. 
From 1992 to 1999, Bud served as Presi-
dent and Chief Executive Officer of the United 
States Capitol Historical Society, which is 
dedicated to preserving the heritage and his-
tory of the Capitol. The Society honored him 
with its Freedom Award upon his retirement. 
Bud and his wife, Joyce, are the proud par-
ents of four children: Cate, Clancy, Roy, and 
Beth. Beth died at age seven after a three- 
year battle with leukemia. The foundation that 
Bud and Joyce established in her name has 
helped hundreds of high school graduates 
from Champaign County study medicine and 
related careers in college. 
Madam Speaker, Bud Brown has been a 
personal friend and mentor for decades. We 
are grateful that good men like Bud commit 
their lives to public service and inspire others 
to follow in their footsteps.

part of the SRNL team that developed an 
automated 
controlled-potential 
coulometer 
used in the measurement of plutonium that is 
used by the IAEA, Los Alamos National Lab-
oratory, and Japanese Atomic Energy Agency. 
Mr. Cordaro has 12 inventions with 4 patents. 
Dr. David Diprete has served as the tech-
nical lead for the radiochemistry team in the

sulted in the lab’s national success and 
achievements. I would also like to commend 
Colin Demarest, a journalist at the Aiken 
Standard, for covering this story and high-
lighting the success of these prestigious Fel-
lows.

HONORING THE LIFE OF THYRA 
STEVENSON 
HON. RUSS FULCHER 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, prior to 
serving in Congress, I served in the Idaho 
Legislature with a beloved individual. This spe-
cial person, who passed recently, was an air-
craft commander, an instructor, a Captain, a 
teacher, a linguist, and a mother to five chil-
dren and twelve grandchildren in her life of 75 
years. Joyfully, Thyra Stevenson of Lewiston, 
Idaho, lived to the fullest in her life of adven-
ture but sadly, she died suddenly last month. 
As a precursor to her success, Thyra was the 
Valedictorian of Lewiston High School, a doc-
torate of Latin American Literature, having 
studied in Madrid, Spain, and at the University 
of Washington in Seattle. Additionally, she 
was a musician playing the oboe, cello, piano, 
and the bagpipes. Amid her career, Thyra 
served our country as an amazing pilot and 
worked as an officer in the United States 
Coast Guard. Thrya flew large transport jet air-
planes including the McDonnel-Douglas DC–9, 
the Boeing 727, the Boeing 737, and the Boe-
ing 757. After her time as a pilot, Thyra went 
on to serve in the Idaho House of Representa-
tives for three terms. While in the State Legis-
lature, Thrya’s passion for education shined 
through, and she took a keen interest in en-
suring the success of our local dairymen, 
farmers, and ranchers. In 2018, Thyra, in the 
self-described ultimate show of her life, pur-
chased a 2019 F–350 Platinum. It is said that 
parking for such a large truck was limited 
around the Idaho State Capitol, but, today, our 
hearts are joined by family, friends, and col-
leagues in celebrating the ‘‘full-throttle’’ life she 
led. Thyra, a woman of her time, and a 
woman beyond her time will be sorely missed. 
I believe lhe embodiment of this message is a 
small tribute to the large life she lived. I pray 
for her family and those impacted by the sud-
den loss of loved ones during this difficult 
time. The CONGRESSIONAL RECORD is the per-
manent archive of the American people, and I 
am thankful to include the life of Thyra Ste-
venson of Lewiston, Idaho. May God bless our 
great country and wonderful people like Thyra 
that grace this world with their lives.

RECOGNIZING NATIONAL 
POLLINATOR WEEK 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in recognition of National Pollinator Week. 
Our pollinators are an invaluable asset to 
our food production, environment, and econ-
omy. Over 100 of our crops and $18 billion in 
crop production revenue rely on pollinators like 
the monarch butterfly, over 250 species of 
bumblebees, and hummingbirds. They help 
sustain life on Earth and we are obligated to 
protect them. 
As a country, we have taken necessary 
steps to rally around pollinators. In 2019, NIFA 
awarded $4 million in competitive grants for 
pollinator health related projects and the Ap-
propriations Committee funded $400,000 for a 
designated pollinator research coordinator in 
the United States Department of Agriculture. It 
is reassuring to see united support from the 
USDA, Department of the Interior, and the En-
vironmental Protection Agency, each of which 
signed proclamations declaring this week Na-
tional Pollinator Week. 
My district is the proud home of three cities 
designated as a ‘‘Monarch City USA,’’ includ-
ing Oak Harbor, Port Clinton, and Sandusky, 
Ohio. These three cities have contributed to 
the protection of the monarch butterfly by 
planting milkweed and nectar plants, among 
other conservation efforts. This year the 
Trump Administration will decide whether the 
monarch butterfly should be added to the en-
dangered species list as populations continue 
a harrowing multi-decade decline. I urge the 
Administration to use science and common 
sense when considering their decision. 
In honor of National Pollinator Week, please 
join me in celebrating the beauty and utility of 
one of nature’s finest constructs, and renewing 
our promise to protect these keystone species: 
pollinators. 
TRIBUTE TO TEDDY ALVAREZ-NIS-
SEN—UNITED 
STATES 
PRESI-
DENTIAL SCHOLAR IN THE ARTS 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to congratulate Theodore ‘‘Teddy’’ Alvarez- 
Nissen, who has been named one of 20 
United States Presidential Scholars in the Arts 
for 2020. 
Teddy was born in Sacramento, California, 
on October 19, 2001, the son of two lifelong 
nonprofit and legal advocates, Lynn Alvarez 
and Steven Nissen. His talent in the arts was 
nurtured early in California’s public schools, 
first at Lanai Road Elementary School, then at 
Robert A. Millikan Affiliated Charter & Per-
forming Arts Magnet Middle, and finally at the 
Los Angeles County High School for the Arts. 
Teddy’s filmmaking journey began in ear-
nest in fifth grade, when Ms. Karen Bennett’s 
dedication and insight helped Teddy become 
one of the youngest filmmakers to compete in 
national film festivals across the country. Re-
cently, Teddy has used his art to highlight so-
cial causes that are important to him, including 
creating media for the Los Angeles Ronald 
McDonald House, El Nido Family Centers, and 
Arts for Incarcerated Youth. 
Teddy plans to pursue his dream of making 
movies as a member of the 2024 class of the 
prestigious University of Southern California 
School of Cinematic Arts with a major in Film 
and Television Production. Looking into the fu-
ture and following in his parent’s footsteps, 
Teddy hopes to start a nonprofit which pairs 
young artists with charitable organizations in 
order to create free informational and edu-
cational content. 
Apart from filmmaking, Teddy is an active 
member of his community through the Cali-
fornia YMCA Youth & Government program. 
Throughout his four years of participation, 
Teddy has been a natural leader in this politi-
cally active community of over 3,500 teen-
agers throughout the state. His peers elected 
him California’s 72nd Youth Lieutenant Gov-
ernor in January 2020, and he has used this 
platform to champion youth initiatives ranging 
from criminal justice reform to combating food 
waste. 
Throughout his high school career, Teddy 
has consistently amplified student voices in 
politics. In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas 
High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, 
Teddy marched with a group of students on 
Los Angeles City Hall to speak out against 
gun violence. Before he could vote himself, 
Teddy helped to pre-register over 30 percent 
of the eligible student body at his school to 
vote. As part of the Western Justice Center’s 
‘‘Creating Bias-Free Classrooms’’ initiative, 
Teddy acted in short plays and improv situa-
tions to help train teachers to combat racial 
prejudice in the classroom. 
It is no surprise that Teddy’s dedication to 
the art of filmmaking and determination to use 
his talents to serve others is being honored by 
the White House and the U.S. Department of 
Education by naming Teddy one of 20 United 
States Presidential Scholars in the Arts. 
I ask all Members today to join me in cele-
brating this exceptional young man of Califor-
nia’s 28th Congressional District, Teddy Alva-
rez-Nissen.

NEW SUDAN 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, congratulations to the Prime Minister 
of Sudan, Abdullah Hamdok, and President of 
the Sovereign Council, Lt. General Abdel 
Fatah al-Burhan, for their invaluable efforts to 
transition to a ‘‘New Sudan’’ characterized by 
a civilian-led democratic state, that promotes 
religious freedom and the rights of women and 
minorities. 
There 
are 
immense 
challenges 
facing 
Sudan including political instability, economic 
fragility, and food security, all exacerbated in 
the face of a pandemic. The American people 
are supportive as evidenced by H.R. 6094, 
The Sudan Democratic Transition, Account-
ability, and Financial Transparency Act of 
2020; the $356 million in financial support 
from USAID announced on June 25, 2020, 
and the 2020 bipartisan House Foreign Affairs 
Committee visit to Sudan. 
The challenges and personal risks accepted 
by the Prime Minister and Sovereign Council 
President are recognized. The House of Rep-
resentatives and the American people are 
committed to a prosperous and democratic 
Sudan. 
Sudan is ably represented in Washington by 
Ambassador Noureldin Satti.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. JOHN R. CURTIS 
OF UTAH 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. CURTIS. Madam Speaker, had I been 
present, I would have voted nay on H.R. 51, 
the Washington, D.C. Admission Act. I missed 
this vote due to a scheduled surgery I needed 
to attend in Utah. 
Our nation was founded on the belief that 
Americans should have equal opportunity to 
participate in government—and I believe that 
an engaged citizenry is vital to a successful 
nation. Because our Founders also believed 
that no individual state should have undue in-
fluence on the federal government, they cre-
ated a location for the federal government 
over which Congress has ultimate authority: 
Washington, D.C. Statehood for D.C. would 
undoubtedly give the new state priority over 
existing states, including Utah.

HONORING THE CAREER OF ALEX 
DELGADO 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize my dear friend, Ms. Alex Delgado, 
on the occasion of her retirement from tele-
vision news after 22 years at Fresno County’s 
news station KSEE24. Alex has been a staple 
in homes across the Central Valley and will be 
greatly missed. 
Alex was born in Mexico City, Mexico and 
lived in Chicago and Texas, before relocating 
to the Central Valley. Her journalism career at 
KSEE 24 began in 1998. Alex has dedicated 
her career to ensuring the Central Valley’s 
residents are informed and their stories are 
told. In 2004, she launched a 4 o’clock news 
segment, as solo anchor and continued to 
contribute to late-night newscasts. Three years 
later, Alex started the Valley’s first live com-
munity lifestyle program, Central Valley Today. 
In 2019, Alex returned to the news desk as 
the anchor for KSEE24’s morning program, 
Sunrise. 
Along with her award-winning journalism ca-
reer, Alex has found time to give back to her 
community. Alex has helped host the Central 
Valley Veterans Day Parade for many years 
and served on the local board of the American 
Red Cross. Her many awards include being 
named Business Street’s Top 40 Under 40, a 
Top 100 Most Influential Women, and an 
EMMY Award for her work. 
For 26 years, Alex has put her time and en-
ergy into bettering the community. She is a 
mother to two, cares for her family, and still 
has time to help those in need in the commu-
nity. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great respect that 
I ask my colleagues in the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in congratulating Alex 
Delgado on her career as an award-winning 
journalist. I ask that you join me in wishing 
Alex and her family continued success, health 
and happiness in this new chapter of her life.

HONORING THE LEGACY OF 
SHIRLEY MCKAGUE 
HON. RUSS FULCHER 
OF IDAHO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. FULCHER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the honorable life and work 
of a beloved fellow Idaho native. A graduate of 
Idaho schools, a successful small business 
co-owner, and a leader in public service—also 
a long-time personal friend and legislative col-
league of mine, Shirley McKague will be dear-
ly missed. First, as a State Representative, 
then an Idaho State Senator, Shirley worked 
her way into the hearts of her colleagues in 
the Idaho Statehouse through her wit, charm-
ing personality, and talent. For her family, 
Shirley leaves behind her husband Paul of 50 
years, and six children to carry on her wonder-
ful legacy. I am honored to highlight a life of 
success and positive influence. As a genuine 
conservative, Shirley was instrumental in the 
Idaho State Legislature and in the public serv-
ice careers of countless fellow Idahoans who 
refer to her as their inspiration. In everything 
she did, Shirley was always more interested in 
the welfare of fellow Idahoans than that of her 
own. Shirley was a beacon in our local com-
munities and known as someone who was 
thoughtful and soft-spoken, but always on tar-
get. God bless Shirley and her family. We will 
also miss her, and her passion for life.

CELEBRATING MOSS BROTHERS 
TIRES 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today I rise to celebrate Moss Broth-
ers Tires, a fourth-generation tire business in 
West Rockingham, North Carolina that has 
been in operation for more than 100 years. 
Moss Brothers was founded as general 
store by G.W. Moss in 1917. Through skillful 
management, G.W. Moss helped the business 
survive the Great Depression and even loaned 
money to members of the West Rockingham 
community who were in need. 
Moss Brothers was converted to a tire store 
over 30 years ago and now serves an esti-
mated 50–75 customers each day, including 
from neighboring counties and into South 
Carolina. Moss Brothers is currently owned by 
Will Moss, G.W.’s great-grandson, who con-
tinues the family tradition of hard work, dedi-
cation and commitment to community. 
I salute Moss Brothers for their longstanding 
service to Richmond County. Here’s to an-
other 100 years.

House Judiciary Committee Democrats 
were back at their ‘‘politicized Justice De-
partment’’ theme this week, calling a dis-
gruntled former lieutenant of special counsel 
Robert Mueller to accuse the department of 
giving 
special 
treatment 
to 
President 
Trump’s allies. Too bad the testimony came 
on the very day a federal court confirmed 
that Mr. Mueller’s team and the Federal Bu-
reau of Investigation engaged in misconduct. 
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of 
Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit 
did so via an order requiring Judge Emmet 
Sullivan to dismiss charges against former 
national security adviser Mike Flynn. Most 
of the focus has been on the legal merits of 
the ruling. Judge Neomi Rao’s compelling 
opinion rebuked Judge Sullivan for ignoring 
the department’s call to drop the case and 
instead setting himself up as both prosecutor 
and jury. This was a win for the separation 
of powers, even as it was a step toward jus-
tice for Mr. Flynn.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E582 
June 26, 2020 
Largely overlooked was the decision’s re-
buke of the FBI and the Mueller team. The 
D.C. Circuit became the first federal court to 
acknowledge the misconduct that Attorney 
General William Barr is trying to bring to 
light. Most of the courts that oversaw Mr. 
Mueller’s prosecutions were asked to do no 
more than rubber-stamp a plea deal or sign 
off on a jury verdict. But Mr. Flynn, backed 
by tenacious lawyer Sidney Powell, fought 
the charges—forcing the Justice Department 
to review its actions, acknowledge its bad 
acts, and move to dismiss its case. Demo-
crats and the press cast this outcome as evi-
dence of Mr. Barr’s ‘‘politicization.’’ The cir-
cuit court begs to differ. 
The Justice Department’s credibility was 
at stake here. Judge Sullivan bought into 
the same Democratic conspiracy theories, 
which is why he refused Justice’s motion to 
dismiss and appointed retired judge John 
Gleeson to act as shadow prosecutor. He ar-
gued the Justice Department wasn’t entitled 
to the usual ‘‘presumption of regularity.’’ 
And if the circuit judges thought there was 
anything to claims that Mr. Barr was play-
ing political favorites, it could have allowed 
the process to continue. 
Instead they bluntly noted that there was 
no ‘‘legitimate basis’’ to question the depart-
ment’s behavior. They even slapped Mr. 
Gleeson for relying on ‘‘news stories, tweets 
and other facts outside the record.’’ By con-
trast, Judge Rao’s opinion notes: ‘‘The gov-
ernment’s motion includes an extensive dis-
cussion of newly discovered evidence casting 
Flynn’s guilt into doubt.’’ It points out that 
this includes ‘‘evidence of misconduct by the 
Federal Bureau of Investigation.’’ It finishes 
by noting that each government branch 
must be encouraged to ‘‘self correct when it 
errs.’’ 
The court’s conclusion is obvious. All it 
had to do was look at the voluminous evi-
dence the Justice Department supplied. Its 
briefs proved the FBI had improperly pur-
sued Mr. Flynn, keeping open an investiga-
tion that produced no evidence, ginning up a 
‘‘violation’’ of the seldom-enforced Logan 
Act, sandbagging Mr. Flynn with an inter-
view that had no ‘‘legitimate investigative 
basis.’’ It even provided new FBI notes this 
week suggesting that then-President Obama 
and Vice President Joe Biden were improp-
erly engaged in the investigation. The de-
partment’s filings showed that the Mueller 
team had consistently denied defense attor-
neys exculpatory information. And it ex-
plained the straightforward process by which 
it had reached its decision to withdraw: Mr. 
Barr in February appointed veteran U.S. At-
torney Jeff Jensen to review the case, and in 
May Mr. Jensen concluded dismissal was 
‘‘the proper and just course.’’ 
What matters, however, is that the public 
gets the truth from credible sources. It’s 
been coming, from congressional inquiries, 
from the nonpartisan Justice Department in-
spector general, from internal Justice and 
FBI reviews. And now from a court. 
PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. STEVEN M. PALAZZO 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, due to 
travel requirements, I was not present to vote 
during the first vote series on June 25, 2020. 
Had I been present, I would have voted 
NAY on Roll Call No. 116 and NAY on Roll 
Call No. 117.

HONORING THE LIFE OF RUFUS 
HERNANDEZ, JR. 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the life and service of Mr. Rufus Her-
nandez, Jr., who passed away on April 19, 
2020. Rufus was a longtime Fresno commu-
nity leader and veteran of the Merchant Ma-
rines and Air Force, who dedicated his life to 
helping others. 
Rufus was born on February 12, 1927 in 
Roseville, California. At the age of 17, he en-
listed in the Merchant Marines and served as 
a mariner seaman on the William N. Byers 
Liberty Ship in 1945 and the SS Monroe Vic-
tory Ship from 1945 to 1946 during World War 
II. His duties included lookout, cargo transfer, 
and deckhand. Rufus volunteered to navigate 
the ship through a foreign port and channels 
when there was no pilot available to navigate. 
After his time in the Merchant Marines, Rufus 
joined the Air Force in 1948 until his service 
ended in 1952. He served in the 7th Air Divi-
sion and volunteered for photography training 
which took him to Denver, South Dakota, and 
England. He earned the rank of staff sergeant 
and ran the photography department along 
with training new recruits. 
After his military career, Rufus became a 
restaurateur and a bank executive. He most 
enjoyed being a father to his six children and 
later, a grandfather and great grandfather. He 
enjoyed spending his time with his fellow vet-
eran friends and was involved in the American 
Legion. He was honored as Grand Marshall in 
2014 Central Valley Veterans Day Parade, 
representing the Merchant Marines. For many 
years, Rufus participated in the Central Valley 
Veterans Day Parade and enjoyed being 
around veterans who loved their country just 
as much as he did. 
Rufus is preceded in death by his father, 
Rufus Hernandez, Sr., mother, Sarah Her-
nandez (Morales), and his two brothers, Rob-
ert and Michael Hernandez. 
He is survived by his children, daughter 
Catherine Hernandez, daughter Cheryl Walter 
and son-in-law Marty Walter, daughter Teresa 
Smith and son-in-law Doug Smith, daughter 
Sandra 
Bettencourt 
and 
son-in-law 
Jeff 
Bettencourt, son Richard Hernandez and 
daughter-in-law Sol Fernandez, daughter Eliz-
abeth (Lizzie) Ahrens; and his many grand-
children and great grandchildren. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life of Rufus Hernandez, 
Jr. His commitment to his country and dedica-
tion to the Central Valley has left an impact. 
I join his family and friends in honoring his 
great life.

CALLING FOR A PEACEFUL RESO-
LUTION TO GERD PROJECT NE-
GOTIATION 
HON. JASON CROW 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, June 26, 2020 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of continued cooperation and peaceful 
negotiations between Ethiopia, Egypt, and 
Sudan regarding the construction and oper-
ation of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance 
Dam (GERD). Furthermore, I urge the Trump 
Administration to respect our nation’s role as 
an impartial observer to these discussions 
going forward. 
As you know, the GERD project broke 
ground in 2011. Next month, construction will 
be complete. When fully filled and operational, 
the dam will generate approximately 6,000 
megawatts of electricity—making it the largest 
hydropower project in Africa. It will directly im-
pact the flow of water, increase the supply of 
energy, and help ensure food security in Ethi-
opia, Egypt, and Sudan. In Ethiopia, it will help 
alleviate drought conditions that have im-
pacted nearly one fifth of its population and in-
flicted untold damage on crops across the 
county. In Egypt, it will help improve water 
supply for the rapidly growing population. In 
Sudan, it will help reduce sediment and con-
trol flooding. 
For the past four years, negotiations have 
followed the 2015 Declaration of Principles, 
agreed upon by the three countries involved in 
the negotiations. These principles outlined a 
commitment to peaceful resolution to conflicts 
as they arise; mutual trust and respect; infor-
mation sharing; security; respect for one an-
other’s sovereignty; and stewardship of the 
River Nile. 
In recent months, tensions have escalated 
between Ethiopia and Egypt, putting the 
project in jeopardy. We must honor our na-
tion’s role as an observer of these negotia-
tions and avoid taking on an additional role as 
a facilitator or mediator. Moreover, we must 
not play favorites or take any other action that 
may risk damaging the integrity of this process 
or put a peaceful, mutually beneficial agree-
ment out of reach. 
As negotiations continue, I urge the United 
States Government and all other international 
parties to respect the 2015 Declaration of 
Principles, engage only with African Union dip-
lomats, and support a peaceful resolution for 
all countries involved and for the region at 
large.
