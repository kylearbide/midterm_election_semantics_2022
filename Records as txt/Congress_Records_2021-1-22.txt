FRIDAY, JANUARY 22, 2021 
The Senate met at 10 a.m. and was 
called to order by the President pro 
tempore (Mr. LEAHY).

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Sovereign King, our hope for years to 
come, deliver us from the sin of run-
ning from the truth. Remind us often 
that truth brings freedom. 
Thank You that You are our helper, 
sustaining our lives and keeping us 
strong. You guide us through the wil-
derness and protect us through life’s 
storms. 
Lord, inspire our lawmakers to place 
themselves into Your hands, permit-
ting You to fulfill Your purposes 
through their faithful toil. Fill them 
with reverential awe and give them a 
sanctified audacity, even when facing 
trials and setbacks. 
We pray in Your loving Name. Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The President pro tempore led the 
Pledge of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 
majority leader is recognized. 
NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
it came to our attention last night 
that members of the National Guard, 
after standing on duty to protect the 
Capitol for Inauguration Day, keeping 
us safe, were sleeping in parking ga-
rages and cramped quarters without 
proper space or ventilation. It was ut-
terly unacceptable. 
I have told those who run the secu-
rity of the Capitol that it can never 
happen again, and I pledge to every Na-
tional Guard member that it will not 
happen again. 
The minute I heard about this out-
rage last night, we made sure it was 
fixed immediately. Every member of 
the Guard was found proper accom-
modations inside, and, as of this morn-
ing, everyone was accounted for and 
taken care of. 
This morning I went over to the CVC 
and I spoke to a number of Guardsmen 
personally to make sure they were OK. 
I want to thank Senators HASSAN, 
DUCKWORTH, KELLY, and HEINRICH for 
their work on this matter last night, as 
well as Senator LUJA´ N, who went 
around late at night to make sure 
things were OK, as well. And I want to 
thank all the Members who were con-
cerned and lent a hand. 
I also want to particularly thank 
Acting Sergeant at Arms Jennifer 
Hemingway, who, when we told her 
about this situation, patrolled the 
floors of the Capitol Complex until 
past 3 a.m. to ensure that no one was 
left behind or not where they belonged. 
And she was back at her desk first 
thing today to follow up. 
We owe an enormous debt of grati-
tude to the men and women who 
worked to keep us safe on January 6 
and the days since. A situation like 
last night will never happen again. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, I have spoken 
about the Senate’s agenda for the next 
several weeks. We have three essential 
items on our plate: one, the confirma-
tion of President Biden’s Cabinet and 
other key officials; two, legislation to 
provide desperately needed COVID re-
lief; three, a second impeachment trial 
of Donald Trump. The Senate must and 
will do all three—COVID relief, con-
firmation of nominees, and an im-
peachment trial. 
Now, the first order of business is to 
fulfill our constitutional duty to advise 
and consent on the President’s appoint-
ments to his Cabinet. This morning the 
Senate will vote to confirm President 
Biden’s nominee for Secretary of De-
fense, Lloyd Austin. Mr. Austin will be 
the first African American to ever 
helm the Defense Department in its 
history—a powerful symbol of the di-
versity and history of America’s Armed 
Forces. 
Mr. Austin has a storied career in the 
Army, but those days are behind him. 
As Secretary of Defense, he has prom-
ised to empower and lift up his civilian 
staff, and I believe he will be an out-
standing Secretary of Defense for ev-
eryone at the Pentagon—servicemem-
bers and civilian employees alike. 
The Secretary of Defense, of course, 
has a hugely important task ahead of 
him. He must once again demonstrate

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S96 
January 22, 2021 
to the world that the U.S. military will 
always support our friends, deter our 
adversaries, and, if necessary, defeat 
them. 
Lloyd Austin is the right person for 
the job. He has the experience, the vi-
sion, and the competence to run the 
largest agency in our government. I 
look forward to confirming his nomina-
tion shortly. 
Afterward, the Senate must continue 
to install President Biden’s team by 
confirming Secretaries of State, Home-
land Security, and Treasury. We need 
Republican 
cooperation 
to 
confirm 
these nominees, but we expect that co-
operation to continue. The continuity 
of our national security, military, and 
intelligence policy, as well as our abil-
ity to effectively respond to the cur-
rent health and economic crises, de-
pend on having these Cabinet officials 
confirmed. 
Now, as I mentioned, the Senate will 
also conduct a second impeachment 
trial for Donald Trump. I have been 
speaking to the Republican leader 
about the timing and duration of the 
trial, but—make no mistake—a trial 
will be held in the U.S. Senate, and 
there will be a vote on whether to con-
vict the President. 
I have spoken to Speaker PELOSI, 
who informed me that the article will 
be delivered to the Senate on Monday. 
Now, I have heard some of my Repub-
lican colleagues argue that this trial 
would 
be 
unconstitutional 
because 
Donald Trump is no longer in office— 
an argument that has been roundly re-
pudiated, debunked by hundreds of con-
stitutional scholars—left, right, and 
center—and defies basic common sense. 
It makes no sense whatsoever that a 
President or any official could commit 
a heinous crime against our country 
and then be permitted to resign so as 
to avoid accountability and a vote to 
disbar them from future office. It 
makes no sense. 
Regardless, the purveyors of this un-
usual argument are trying to delay the 
inevitable. The fact is, the House will 
deliver the Article of Impeachment to 
the Senate. The Senate will conduct a 
trial of the impeachment of Donald 
Trump. It will be a full trial. It will be 
a fair trial. But make no mistake, 
there will be a trial, and when that 
trial ends, Senators will have to decide 
if they believe Donald John Trump in-
cited the insurrection against the 
United States. 
Now, over the course of elections in 
November and January, the American 
people chose to retire four Republican 
Senators and elect a Democratic ma-
jority to this Senate. The Senate must 
now take the basic step of passing an 
organizing resolution and setting up 
the rules for a Senate where there are 
50 Members of either party. 
Luckily, we have a clear precedent 
for what to do in this situation. In 2001, 
then-Majority Leader Lott and Minor-
ity Leader Daschle came together and 
agreed on a set of rules to govern a 50– 
50 Senate. We should follow that prece-
dent. 
We have offered to abide by the same 
agreement the last time there was a 50– 
50 Senate. What is fair is fair. That is 
precedent. We could organize the Sen-
ate today if both sides agreed to abide 
by the same rules as last time. 
The Republican leader, however, has 
made 
an 
extraneous 
demand 
that 
would place additional constraints on 
the majority—constraints that have 
never been in place before. In fact, his 
proposal would remove a tool that the 
Republican leader himself used twice 
in just the last Congress to accelerate 
the confirmation of Republican nomi-
nees. 
Leader MCCONNELL’s proposal is un-
acceptable, and it won’t be accepted. 
And the Republican leader knew that 
when he first proposed it. 
Only 2 days ago, we celebrated the in-
auguration of a new President and the 
turning over of a new leaf. The Amer-
ican people want us to work together 
and move past the meaningless polit-
ical fights and gridlock that have 
plagued us for too long. 
It is time to get to work. A first step 
is for the Republican caucus to agree 
to follow the same precedent that gov-
erned the Senate the last time around. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
MANCHIN). The Republican leader is 
recognized. 
f 
NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday evening, we learned that some 
of the National Guard forces who were 
helping protect the Capitol Complex 
were being made to rest in parking ga-
rages between their shifts. I don’t 
think a single Senator feels that was 
acceptable. I am glad the situation was 
resolved, and I hope we learn exactly 
what happened. 
In that regard, I want to thank all 
the National Guard, including more 
than 300 Kentucky Guardsmen, and 
local and Federal law enforcement who 
helped supplement our very own Cap-
itol Police in the wake of January 6. 
Your Congress and your country appre-
ciate all you have done to secure the 
Capitol and the inauguration. 
Later today, I will have the honor of 
meeting a number of my Kentuckians 
who have been helping out here at the 
Capitol. It is going to be the highlight 
of my day. 
In the near future, Congress needs to 
smartly transition toward a more sus-
tainable security presence. Keeping the 
Capitol safe cannot and will not re-
quire 
huge 
numbers 
of 
uniformed 
troops and vast systems of emergency 
fencing to remain in place forever. 
With the inauguration behind us, we 
should find the right middle ground be-
tween the unacceptable lapses 3 weeks 
ago and the extraordinary short-term 
measures that have been put in place 
since that time. In the meantime, we 
need to make darn sure that we look 
after the men and women who look 
after us. 
f 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a totally different matter, 
while business proceeds on the floor, 
the Democratic leader and I are con-
tinuing to flesh out the structure of 
this 50–50 Senate. 
When Leaders Lott and 
Daschle 
wrote a similar agreement 20 years 
ago, there wasn’t a need at all to reaf-
firm the basic standing rules that gov-
ern legislation here in the Senate. It 
was safely assumed that no majority 
would break this rule for short-term 
gain. 
Floor remarks surrounding those 2001 
discussions specifically cite the legisla-
tive filibuster as an important and un-
questioned part of the backdrop that 
lay beneath the negotiations on the 
finer details. It was assumed no one 
would ever take that step. 
After the fact, Leader Daschle, the 
Democrat, praised the legislative fili-
buster as a crucial rule. President 
Biden has praised this distinctive fea-
ture of the Senate on many occasions. 
Our current Democratic colleagues 
used it liberally—liberally—over the 
last several years when they were in 
the minority. More than two dozen 
signed a bipartisan letter in 2017 saying 
our Republican majority should not 
break the rule by brute force. Let me 
say that again. Two dozen Democrats 
signed a bipartisan letter in 2017 saying 
our Republican majority should not 
break this rule by brute force. I agreed. 
I didn’t do it. President Trump was not 
happy with that. He tweeted against 
me numerous times because I didn’t 
put an end to the legislative filibuster. 
So the Democrats used it constantly, 
as they had every right to. They were 
happy to insist on a 60-vote threshold 
for practically every major bill I took 
up. 
So we will continue to request that 
our Democratic colleagues reaffirm 
this standing rule of the Senate, which 
they have been happy to use on many 
occasions, I can attest. If we are going 
to truly replicate the 2001 agreement, 
we need to reaffirm this crucial part of 
the foundation that lay beneath it. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, yes-
terday I also shared a proposal for the 
pretrial steps in the Senate impeach-
ment process that appears to be headed 
our way and, as I understand it, will be 
headed our way on Monday. By Senate 
rules, if the article arrives, we have to 
start a trial right then. 
This impeachment began with an 
unprecedentedly 
fast 
and 
minimal 
process over in the House. The sequel 
cannot be an insufficient Senate proc-
ess 
that 
denies 
former 
President 
Trump his due process or damages the

Senate or the Presidency itself. Senate 
Republicans strongly believe we need a 
full and fair process where the former 
President can mount a defense and the 
Senate can properly consider the fac-
tual, legal, and constitutional ques-
tions at stake. 
For that reason, we suggest the 
House transmit this article next Thurs-
day, but that apparently is going to be 
next Monday; that former President 
Trump’s answer and the House’s pre-
trial brief, I suggested, be due on Feb-
ruary 4; and that the former Presi-
dent’s pretrial brief be due, I suggested, 
on February 11. That timeline would 
have provided the Senate some more 
floor time before we step fully into the 
unknown of a trial—which, by the way, 
would have been of substantial benefit 
to the incoming administration and al-
lowed them to get more of their Cabi-
net confirmed, on which we are cooper-
ating as best we can to expedite. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Finally, Mr. Presi-
dent, on one final matter regarding 
nominees, we are considering President 
Biden’s nominees to key Cabinet posts. 
On Wednesday, Admiral Haines was 
confirmed as Director of National In-
telligence on a big bipartisan vote, in-
cluding my own. We hope to be able to 
consider Tony Blinken to be the Sec-
retary of State early next week. 
Today, we are considering GEN Lloyd 
Austin, President Biden’s nominee to 
serve as Secretary of Defense. I voted 
to approve the waiver that would allow 
him to serve in this post yesterday, 
notwithstanding the 7-year cooling-off 
period after military service, and I will 
be voting in favor of his confirmation. 
I am voting yes because the nominee 
is clearly qualified and because Presi-
dents should get real latitude to fill 
their teams with qualified and main-
stream people of their choosing. At the 
same time, the Senate should pause 
and reflect on the fact that we will 
have begun two consecutive Presi-
dential administrations by issuing a 
waiver to a four-star general and 
former CENTCOM commander to lead 
the Pentagon. 
The Armed Services Committee held 
a hearing last week to examine the 
waiver and the current state of civil- 
military relations at the Pentagon. I 
expect the committee will continue to 
pay close attention to this important 
issue in the months ahead and will in-
vestigate steps that Congress can take 
to help restore balance over at the Pen-
tagon. 
The law that we keep waiving actu-
ally exists for a good reason. Civilian 
control of the military is a funda-
mental principle of our Republic. We 
emphatically do not want high-ranking 
military service to become a tacit pre-
requisite for a civilian leadership post 
over at the Department of Defense. 
It is not just about a simplistic fear 
that the military will end up running 
itself. To the contrary, many experts 
worry that military leaders’ appro-
priate fixation on being nonpolitical 
may not prepare them for the job, to 
forcefully fight for our armed services 
amid the political rough-and-tumble in 
the executive branch and here in Con-
gress. To put it another way, they are 
taught from the beginning to stay out 
of politics entirely. But we do want a 
Secretary of Defense who is willing to 
engage in the issue-based discussions 
that we have related to the Depart-
ment. 
Nevertheless, I will vote today to 
confirm a clear patriot with an impres-
sive career, but I will cast that vote 
with the understanding that our new 
Secretary of Defense specifically com-
mits to balancing civil-military rela-
tions, empowering civilian leaders at 
the Pentagon, and playing an active 
role in the inherently political budget 
process to get our forces what they 
need. 
Our 
intensifying 
competition 
with China, Russia, and all the other 
threats we face demand nothing less.

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the Senate will pro-
ceed to executive session to consider 
the following nomination, which the 
clerk will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Lloyd James 
Austin, of Georgia, to be Secretary of 
Defense. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will be 10 
minutes of debate equally divided in 
the usual form. 
NOMINATION OF LLOYD JAMES AUSTIN 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, our Found-
ing Fathers believed strongly in the ci-
vilian control of our military. Having 
escaped from the tyranny of the Brit-
ish crown, they did not want the pow-
ers of government and military to be 
fused. In America, the people would 
control 
their 
Armed 
Forces. 
This 
standard has endured, and was en-
shrined in law in 1947. Congress had to 
pass a waiver to the 1947 law in 2017, 
and we are being asked to do it again 
in 2021. I hope that this is the last time 
Congress will be asked to pass such a 
waiver. 
Civilian control of the military goes 
beyond the basic question of how long 
ago a nominee wore the uniform. It is 
also a question of whether the nominee 
is enmeshed in the interests of our vast 
defense contracting industry, an indus-
try whose bottom line depends on an 
expansive American military posture 
and, with it, an ever-growing defense 
budget. Going from firing the missiles 
to selling the missiles is technically a 
move into a civilian role, but nothing 
more. It is every bit as corrosive to the 
principle of civilian rule for the head of 
the Pentagon to churn from the mili-
tary to the boardroom to the Pen-
tagon, working with many of the same 
people at every step along the way. 
General Austin retired from the 
Army in 2016, and he immediately 
joined the board of United Tech-
nologies, 
which 
was 
acquired 
by 
Raytheon. 
He 
was 
very 
well-com-
pensated for his work there, and is re-
portedly due a buy-out of up to $1.7 
million when he leaves Raytheon and 
his other work and returns to the Pen-
tagon. All we are doing by confirming 
these types of nominees, no matter 
their other qualifications, is tightening 
the ever-increasing bonds between the 
military and the contractors who serve 
it. It is getting hard to see where one 
stops and the other begins. No pledge 
of recusal from a nominee will solve 
this larger problem. We are not limited 
to selecting our Secretary of Defense 
from the world of defense contractors, 
and our country would be better off if 
we stopped. However, with regard to 
experience and expertise, I do not ques-
tion General Austin’s qualifications 
and will vote to allow the President his 
choice. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of General Lloyd 
Austin’s confirmation to be Secretary 
of Defense, and I urge my colleagues to 
support his nomination in the vote we 
are about to take. 
General Austin has proven through 
his 41-year military career that he is 
extremely capable of leading our mili-
tary as they confront multiple chal-
lenges. 
First, General Austin is a proven 
leader that will provide stability with-
in our military ranks. After 4 years of 
tumultuous 
leadership 
under 
the 
Trump administration, our troops de-
serve a steady hand to lead them in the 
defense of our Nation. 
Moreover, our allies need a Secretary 
of Defense who speaks reliably on be-
half of the President. 
Second, General Austin brings a 
wealth of experience to counter global 
defense challenges. He oversaw U.S. 
and coalition forces in Iraq, served as a 
Vice Chief of Staff of the Army where 
he worked to increase diversity in the 
highest ranks of our military, and com-
manded U.S. Central Command in its 
fight against ISIS and other regional 
threats. 
Third, General Austin’s previous ap-
pointments to the Joint Staff and as 
Vice Chief of Staff of the Army pre-
pared him to tackle strategic issues in 
the Department of Defense. He has 
committed to filling key positions with 
personnel that bring civilian expertise,

a sign he fully respects civilian control 
of the military. 
Finally, our country faces several 
threats that President Biden’s adminis-
tration 
must 
address 
immediately. 
General Austin’s intimate knowledge 
of our military will allow him to hit 
the ground running at the Department 
and make wise investments that deter 
global aggressors. 
I especially welcome General Aus-
tin’s pledge to support our country’s 
pandemic response efforts, such as 
helping with the distribution of vac-
cines nationwide. Through his leader-
ship, the military can provide much 
needed medical and logistical support 
to counter the COVID pandemic. 
We are facing an unprecedented set of 
national security challenges, both at 
home and overseas. I have full con-
fidence in General Austin’s ability to 
help us overcome these challenges, and 
I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of 
his confirmation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is my 
understanding that Chairman INHOFE is 
in route to provide his comments, and 
I just want to begin by thanking him 
for his tremendous leadership. Without 
his dedication to a bipartisan, thought-
ful process, we would not be here 
today, and it is the hallmark of his 
leadership throughout the years we 
have worked together. I anticipate his 
arrival. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Duly 
noted. 
Mr. REED. In order to expedite the 
vote, I will proceed. 
Mr. President, I rise to express my 
support for the confirmation of Lloyd 
Austin to be the Secretary of Defense 
of the United States. 
General Austin is an exceptionally 
qualified leader with a long and distin-
guished career in the U.S. military. He 
has served at the highest echelons of 
the Army and capped his service as the 
commander of U.S. Central Command. 
His character and integrity are unques-
tioned, and he possesses the knowledge 
and skills to effectively lead the Pen-
tagon. 
The United States faces many com-
plex security threats. If confirmed as 
Secretary of Defense, General Austin 
will lead the Department during a time 
when U.S. strategic priorities have 
shifted to focus increasingly on near- 
peer competition with China and Rus-
sia. The Department must also trans-
form how it operates with an increased 
focus on critical technologies like arti-
ficial 
intelligence, 
quantum 
com-
puting, biotechnology, and cyber secu-
rity, while also emphasizing rapid de-
livery of advanced new weapons sys-
tems on timelines that keep pace with 
technological change. 
In addition, President Biden must ad-
dress the urgent and dire challenges 
that few of us would have anticipated 4 
years ago. Our country is in the midst 
of a pandemic that has claimed hun-
dreds of thousands of lives and infected 
millions more and resulted in billions 
in economic damage, and the virus is 
still not under control. Recently, it 
was revealed that large segments of the 
Federal Government and major compa-
nies were hacked by Russia. We are 
still trying to ascertain the extent of 
the breach, but it could be the most 
significant cyber intrusion in the his-
tory of our country or perhaps the 
world. This event, too, should prompt 
us to move promptly to fill Cabinet po-
sitions that are critical to our national 
security. 
Unfortunately, the Department of 
Defense is adrift and in desperate need 
of steadfast leadership. Over the course 
of the past 4 years, there has been re-
peated turnover at senior levels of the 
Department and a concerted effort to 
purposefully leave multiple civilian of-
fices unfilled, necessitating the install-
ment of career or midlevel officials 
into positions in an acting capacity. 
Unlike other nominees for Cabinet 
positions, Congress must provide, as 
Senator MCCONNELL indicated, an ex-
ception for General Austin to serve as 
Secretary of Defense. Under the cur-
rent statute, individuals are prohibited 
from appointment if they are within 7 
years of military service. Congress 
found itself in a similar situation 4 
years ago when President Trump nomi-
nated Gen. James Mattis to be the Sec-
retary of Defense. 
Prior to General Austin’s confirma-
tion hearing, the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee held a hearing on civil-
ian control of the Armed Forces that 
focused on the erosion of civil-military 
relations. At the hearing, valid con-
cerns were raised about providing an-
other waiver so soon after Secretary 
Mattis. However, at his nomination 
hearing earlier this week, General Aus-
tin pledged his commitment to repair-
ing civil-military relations while also 
empowering civilian personnel within 
the Department of Defense. These are 
critical commitments by General Aus-
tin and ones that I support. 
Therefore, yesterday I voted in favor 
of the legislation to provide General 
Austin with an exception to serve as 
Secretary of Defense, and I was pleased 
the legislation received strong bipar-
tisan support. 
General Austin is an outstanding 
choice to serve as Secretary of Defense. 
I am proud to support his nomination, 
given the unique challenges we face. I 
think from now on, in a few moments, 
we can refer to him as Secretary Aus-
tin, which is the appropriate title for 
his role. 
With that, I yield the floor to my col-
league, the chairman. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, yester-
day I had the opportunity to respond to 
the majority on my support for Tony 
Blinken to be the Secretary of State. 
He is someone I have known for a long 
period of time. I think we will see that 
with the new administration here and 
myself being a conservative Repub-
lican, there will be some appointments 
that I will not really be excited about 
and agree with, in which case I will 
state it. But in the case of the Sec-
retary of State, I expressed myself yes-
terday and I want to do it again today 
for what I consider to be a really crit-
ical first appointment—second appoint-
ment that the new administration 
makes, and that would be for General 
Austin to be the person in charge at a 
time that is very unique. 
I agree with the Senator who just 
spoke about the qualities of this gen-
eral. We know that he rose through the 
ranks through the Army to become the 
first four-star general and commander 
of Central Command from 2013 to 2016. 
He has done everything right. 
We, right now—I know the Presiding 
Officer is aware of this and certainly 
the ranking member of the committee 
is aware of this—we are in the most 
threatening times that we have ever 
been in. We have China and Russia out 
there with capabilities that we didn’t 
really believe we would find ourselves 
with. So that is going to be the pri-
mary concern of this new administra-
tion, and I can’t think of a better per-
son to take the helm than General Aus-
tin to provide the leadership. 
And it is true that we had to have a 
waiver yesterday. That waiver was 
overwhelmingly supported in a bipar-
tisan way. So everyone knows that we 
gave a lot of thought to it. And this is 
at a time where we really needed some-
one with the background of General 
Austin to take that position, and I 
strongly support it and look forward to 
serving with him. 
I yield the floor. 
VOTE ON AUSTIN NOMINATION 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Austin nomination? 
Mr. INHOFE. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
called the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from North Carolina (Mr. BURR), the 
Senator from West Virginia (Mrs. CAP-
ITO), the Senator from Mississippi (Mrs. 
HYDE-SMITH), the Senator from Kansas 
(Mr. MORAN), and the Senator from 
North Carolina (Mr. TILLIS). 
Further, if present and voting, the 
Senator from Kansas (Mr. MORAN) 
would have voted ‘‘yea.’’ 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). Are there any other Senators 
in the Chamber desiring to vote? 
The result was announced—yeas 93,

f 
NOMINATION OF JANET LOUISE 
YELLEN 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, a few 
minutes ago, Chair Janet Yellen was 
approved by the Senate Finance Com-
mittee to be Secretary of the Treasury 
by an extraordinary 26-to-0 vote. 
I have seen times around here in the 
Senate where you come away con-
vinced you couldn’t get 26 to 0 among 
Senators to buy a soda. I want to 
thank Senators GRASSLEY and CRAPO 
for working very closely with me and 
Senate Democrats to achieve this re-
markable vote this morning. 
The fact is, Janet Yellen has been 
confirmed by this body four times. She 
really belongs in the Senate confirma-
tion hall of fame, and the reason that 
she has been confirmed all of these 
times is because of what we saw at her 
confirmation hearing on Tuesday. She 
did a superb job. After the hearing, she 
responded in a substantive way to hun-
dreds of questions that came from col-
leagues and has made a real commit-
ment to transparency. 
Now, I know that Senators are work-
ing on a variety of issues now, but I 
would like to say that I think, given 
the urgency of the economic challenge 
our country faces, in a truly perilous 
economic time, I would very much like 
to work with all of my colleagues, par-
ticularly Senators CRAPO and GRASS-
LEY, to find a way to, today, bring up 
Chair Yellen for confirmation to be our 
Secretary of the Treasury. 
I want to say I very much appreciate 
the conciliatory way this was discussed 
today, and I really hope the Senate can 
vote on her nomination today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Arkansas is recognized. 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that at the end 
of my remarks the Senator from Okla-
homa, Senator INHOFE, be recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that at the conclu-
sion of the remarks from the Senator 
from Arkansas that I be recognized. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
f 
CHINA 
Mr. COTTON. Madam President, on 
Wednesday, just moments after Joe 
Biden took office, China’s Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs sanctioned 28 members 
of the outgoing administration, includ-
ing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, 
National 
Security 
Advisor 
Robert 
O’Brien, and UN Ambassador Kelly 
Craft. 
According to Chinese State media, 
these Trump administration officials 
were guilty of ‘‘crazy moves which 
gravely interfered in China’s internal 
affairs.’’ Those ‘‘crazy moves’’ include 
presumably condemning the Chinese 
Communist Party’s genocidal cam-
paign against religious minorities in 
Xinjiang Province or its atheistic 
crackdown on Chinese Christians. In 
addition to interfering, these officials 
allegedly offended the Chinese people 
and seriously disrupted U.S.-China re-
lations. I guess that refers to some, 
such as Secretary of Health and Human 
Services Alex Azar, who traveled to 
Taiwan. 
Under the new sanctions, these offi-
cials are now barred from entering 
China, but more important and more 
ominous, institutions associated with 
them are also restricted from doing 
business with China. 
Now, it is tempting to laugh off these 
sanctions, as I did last summer when 
China sanctioned me. You know you 
won’t have a second honeymoon in 
Wuhan or you will have to vacation in 
a nongenocidal country. 
But these sanctions are no laughing 
matter. They are not bluster. They are 
another step in China’s long-term cam-
paign to coerce Americans at every 
level of government and business. They 
are a direct attack on the independence 
of U.S. policy toward China and an at-
tempt to blackmail the Biden adminis-
tration with personal financial ruin in 
the future if they dare to stand up to 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
Some may start to think about the 
potential damage to their future, and 
they may start to sweat a little bit. 
Now, you may say: Good. I am glad 
that former government officials can’t 
cash in on their service and go to influ-
ence-peddling firms like WestExec or 
Albright Stonebridge and sell access to 
the Chinese. 
I might even agree with that point, 
but consider a few other hypotheticals. 
The Chinese State media singled out 
book publishers as just one example of 
who could pay the price. Many public 
officials like to write memoirs, and 
these memoirs often add a lot to our 
understanding of current events, but 
Chinese State media singled out book 
publishers as an example of companies 
that would be banned from China if 
they associated with sanctioned indi-
viduals. 
In fact, China has already used Amer-
ican books as pawns in the trade war 
with the United States. So will major 
publishing houses really risk losing ac-
cess to the Chinese market for all their 
other titles to strike a book deal with, 
say, a former Biden Cabinet official 
who was tough on China and ended up 
getting sanctioned? It is unclear but, I 
would say, doubtful. 
Other public officials practice at big 
law firms. And I know that we all 
make jokes about lawyers, but it is an 
honorable profession. There is nothing 
wrong with practicing at a big law 
firm, and they may plan to return to 
their firms after the administration is 
over. A lot of those firms have clients 
with close ties to China. And even if a 
former public official has no client 
with any business in China, will those 
law firms really take back their old 
employees if it means potentially los-
ing valuable clients who are afraid of 
angering 
the 
Chinese 
Communist 
Party? Again, I would say it is unclear 
but, perhaps, doubtful. 
Once 
you 
consider 
these 
hypotheticals and others that don’t in-
volve influence peddling or anything 
untoward, you can begin to see the in-
sidious consequences of these new sanc-
tions. Beijing wants to scare the Biden 
administration into doing its bidding, 
and they want to scare U.S. businesses 
into blacklisting any official who irri-
tates the Chinese Communist Party. 
Therefore, I call on the Biden admin-
istration to treat these sanctions as a 
day-one assault on the independence of 
its foreign policy by denouncing this 
intimidation in the strongest possible 
terms. 
But as the Chinese Communist Party 
is determined to prove, actions speak 
louder than words, so I also call upon 
President Biden to act reciprocally by 
sanctioning Chinese officials who are 
responsible for this blackmail cam-
paign against his administration. 
Those officials shouldn’t be able to 
ferret away their fortunes in the U.S. 
banking system the way so many cor-
rupt Chinese oligarchs do, nor should

their princeling children get degrees 
from our top universities or intern-
ships at prestigious Washington think 
tanks. 
President Biden should also refuse to 
nominate for senior positions individ-
uals who are professionally or finan-
cially entangled with China, who could 
be compromised by the mere threat of 
sanctions. 
Finally, President Biden should de-
termine whether Chinese Ambassador 
Cui Tiankai was involved in these sanc-
tions, and if so, he should be expelled 
immediately for this egregious effort 
to subvert American foreign policy. 
And that is just for the short term. 
America must also begin to disentangle 
our economy from China, to decouple 
our 
economies. 
The 
Chinese 
Com-
munist Party sanctions pose a threat 
only because American society is so 
deeply compromised by Chinese influ-
ence. 
American 
corporations, 
the 
big 
banks, think tanks, universities, film 
studios, even our sports leagues—even 
LeBron James—are all addicted to Chi-
nese cash. They are all part of a new 
China lobby that is deeply invested in 
the status quo and, thus, hostile to any 
efforts to redefine U.S.-China relations 
in America’s interest. 
This lobby makes their money in 
China. They make their products in 
China. They have made their bed in 
China, and now they are all vulnerable 
to pressure from the Chinese Govern-
ment. 
America hasn’t been in such a bind 
since our earliest days, when our young 
Republic was encircled by hostile impe-
rial powers. 
Even during the Cold War, America 
had few entanglements of the sort we 
face today. The United States had very 
little trade with the Russians. We com-
peted in separate lanes, like runners in 
a race. 
The new Cold War with China isn’t so 
orderly. Communist China is wealthier 
and has more people than did Soviet 
Russia, and our economies have be-
come deeply entangled. These new 
sanctions are just the latest example of 
how that entanglement threatens our 
security and prosperity. 
Here is how the United States can 
beat China in this strategic competi-
tion. First, the United States should 
impose restrictions on inbound and 
outbound investment with China. Wall 
Street has financed China’s industrial 
and 
technological 
development 
for 
more than four decades and has become 
compromised for the bargain. That has 
to end. 
Second, the United States should 
move supply chains for critical goods, 
such as semiconductors and pharma-
ceuticals, out of China and back to 
American soil. China, today, may be 
the so-called factory of the world, but 
it was corporate America, with its 
Army of bankers and lawyers and con-
sultants, who built that factory. That 
has got to end as well. 
Third, the United States must re-
strict the flow of knowledge and ad-
vanced technology between our coun-
try and China. American colleges, uni-
versities, and research laboratories are 
the finest in the world, but they allow 
Chinese nationalists to participate, 
even in cutting-edge research with 
military applications. This research 
has an alarming tendency to end up in 
China, in the weapons fielded by the 
People’s Liberation Army against our 
own troops. That information pipeline 
needs to be shut off, and many of those 
Chinese nationalists need to go. 
None of these steps will be easy, but 
the Chinese Communist Party’s puni-
tive sanctions against Trump adminis-
tration officials and his blackmail 
campaign against the Biden adminis-
tration officials demonstrate that de-
coupling our economies is both nec-
essary and urgent. 
The Communists in Beijing have 
lulled too many Americans into com-
placency and dependency over the 
course of many years. They now intend 
to blackmail even our government into 
inaction. Our intention must be dif-
ferent. The United States must break 
free of the Chinese Communist’s suffo-
cating grasp, fight back, and win. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma is recognized. 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first 
of all, let me just compliment my 
friend from Arkansas on his great re-
marks. People are not aware of the 
threats we are facing in this country. I 
want to join him in encouraging the 
new administration to understand and 
address these threats. 
f 
NATIONAL GUARD 
Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, since 
last week, there have been over 20,000 
members of the National Guard sta-
tioned here at the Capitol. They are 
here—and have been here and are still 
here—to keep us safe, keep the Mem-
bers safe, Senators safe, staff, press— 
all of us. It seems that people are spec-
ulating that maybe this was overkill, 
maybe we didn’t really need this many 
people here. They are wrong. This was 
a nice, successful inauguration and 
successful, peaceful transfer of power 
because they were there. I made that 
very clear to the ones I have been talk-
ing to in the field over the last 3 days. 
I know, firsthand, that they are really 
outstanding 
professionals, 
these 
guards. 
We have about 400 guards here from 
the Oklahoma National Guard. I vis-
ited with them—I guess it was on 
Wednesday—in five different groups. I 
went around and talked to them be-
cause they weren’t all in the same lo-
cation, and we thanked them for the 
service and the sacrifices they are 
making. Long hours. These guys are 
having long hours. They are the best of 
the best. The many I saw did deploy-
ments in Afghanistan. 
When I was talking to them, they 
would remember, and say: Well, Sen-
ator INHOFE, I remember we were to-
gether in Afghanistan; we were to-
gether in Ukraine. These guys—that 
was 10 years ago, and they are still on 
the job working. I don’t know what we 
could have done without them. 
In fact, I asked several of them, how 
many of you in this group, from Okla-
homa, in the Guard, have never been to 
Washington before, that this is your 
first trip. More than half of them had 
never been to Washington before. That 
was a great opportunity for them too. 
But I am really humbled and grateful 
for what they are doing for us, and I 
am sure all of our colleagues are. 
That is why I was so shocked and 
really angry last night—and I picked it 
up on TV—I didn’t know anything 
about it—when I heard that the guards 
were being made to feel like they were 
unwelcome by some person in the Cap-
itol Police, and they were to take their 
rest breaks someplace else and actu-
ally sent to the parking garage, of all 
places. Our Guard members are being 
lodged in hotels. They are working 
shifts, 12-hour shifts a day. They are 
long shifts, on their feet, so they need 
to have rest breaks. And they can’t do 
that lying in the Senate garage. 
They have 2 hours on and 1 hour off, 
plus time for eating and that type of 
thing. We can all agree they should be 
comfortable on their breaks, a place to 
sit and lie down, eat, charge their bat-
teries, and things they have to do— 
talk to their families at home. That is 
what they are supposed to be doing. 
That is precisely where they were. 
They were using the buildings here in 
the Capitol before they were made to 
feel unwelcome and pushed to the ga-
rage. 
I understand, and I am glad that they 
have moved back in and they are now 
well taken care of. And that is a good 
thing. But they should never have had 
to go through this in the first place. 
What we did, you have to find out— 
you get to the bottom of it. And that is 
what we are doing now. We are getting 
answers. I called the acting chief of the 
Capitol Police this morning. I called 
General 
McConville. 
General 
McConville is the Chief of Staff of the 
Army, and they are all working to find 
out how this happened. The acting 
chief, Pittman, says the guards were 
never asked to leave yesterday. 
I know that she believes that. But 
several—multiple members of the mili-
tary said, no, they were told to leave. 
We know one thing; that whether it 
was confusion from the fog and the 
friction and the environment or what-
ever it was, the troops didn’t move on 
their own, so they were asked by some-
body. 
This isn’t a blame game. But I do 
want to know what happened to make 
sure it doesn’t happen again. This is 
what happened. There was one uni-
formed police officer who issued an 
order without authority or without 
going through the chain of command. I 
am glad that the U.S. Capitol Police 
and the Guard are talking and trying 
to figure this out. We are going to be

able to identify who that person was, 
and we will make that public. But, ul-
timately, one message for our National 
Guard up here: You are appreciated. 
You are welcome. We are very, very 
grateful for the sacrifices that you 
made. And if you are ever told at any 
point that you need to vacate and don’t 
have a comfortable place, just go to 
Russell 205, and I will make sure that 
you will be very comfortable in my of-
fice. 
I know that there is bipartisan out-
rage about this, so I think you will 
have plenty of places to rest. You have 
done a great job. You will be returning 
home soon. And you will be able to say: 
Job well done.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
f 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
want to congratulate now-Secretary of 
Defense Lloyd Austin on his confirma-
tion to be Secretary of Defense. I spoke 
yesterday about his confirmation, the 
two votes that had to happen. I had the 
honor of introducing this great Amer-
ican at his confirmation hearing at the 
Armed Services Committee. I served 
with him in the military many years 
ago. And I think he is going to be an 
important 
addition 
to 
President 
Biden’s team. 
One of the things that we have been 
working on, over the last several years, 
is rebuilding our military after drastic 
cuts by the Obama-Biden administra-
tion. Hopefully, we are not going to see 
that again. One of the reasons I was 
strongly 
supporting 
now-Secretary 
Austin was because I believe—and I 
certainly hope this is a correct belief, 
and I have commitments from him—he 
won’t agree with that, although I am 
sure some, unfortunately, in this body 
and others in the Biden administration 
are going to agree with drastic cuts to 
the military. It will hurt readiness. So 
one of the reasons that I think he is 
going to be a good Secretary is not just 
his exceptional character, humility, 
leadership but because he knows what 
will happen if there are dramatic cuts 
like there were in the second term of 
the Obama-Biden administration to our 
military. Not good. 
One of the things I had the oppor-
tunity to talk to him about—one of the 
things that has been a huge positive for 
America over the last decade, for so 
many reasons, is that we have become 
the world’s energy superpower again— 
like we were, essentially, during World 
War II. 
What do I mean by that? Prior to the 
pandemic, we were the No. 1 producer 
of oil. Yes, people still need to use oil. 
I know some of my colleagues in this 
body don’t believe that, but it is true; 
the No. 1 producer of natural gas, clean 
burning natural gas. We are starting to 
export it all around the world; No. 1 
producer of renewables. So all of the 
above, America is the superpower of 
energy. 
This is good. It is great for the na-
tional security of our Nation, for a 
whole host of reasons. General Austin 
understands 
that—Secretary 
Austin 
understands that. It is great for jobs. 
In the 2008–2009 recession, the No. 1 sec-
tor of the economy that got us out of 
the great recession was the energy sec-
tor, in terms of GDP growth and jobs. 
It is great for the environment. Why 
do I say that? Some people tilt their 
heads. It is great for the environment 
because in America—certainly, in my 
State, Alaska—we have the highest 
standards on the environment of any 
place in the world by far. It is not even 
close. If you need energy, which you 
do, you should do it, produce it in the 
place that respects the environment 
the most—not Russia, not Saudi Ara-
bia—America, Alaska. 
It is good for energy security. It is 
good for manufacturing low-cost nat-
ural gas throughout the country. Like 
I said, it is really good for jobs. These 
are really good jobs. Resource develop-
ment jobs are really good jobs. They 
support working families and the mid-
dle class. Everybody knows that. That 
is a good thing that is happening in the 
United States of America. 
There are some fringe groups that 
don’t like energy. Unfortunately, some 
of my colleagues in the Senate don’t 
like hydrocarbons. By the way, as we 
became the world’s energy superpower, 
our greenhouse gas emissions declined 
probably more than any other industri-
alized economy in the world. Why? Be-
cause natural gas is clean-burning. So 
this is a win-win-win-win-win on so 
many fronts. 
Here is why I am speaking right now: 
Because it is all at risk. It is all at 
risk. The first few days of the new 
Biden Administration have seen an un-
precedented assault on resource devel-
opment and energy jobs, an attack on 
the men and women—working men and 
women with good wages—who produce 
really important resources for this 
great Nation and now for other coun-
tries because we export a lot of these 
resources. It is an assault on good en-
ergy jobs, good resource development 
jobs that have been the bedrock of mil-
lions of middle-class Americans for 
decades. 
Let me just give you an example, just 
in my State. Everybody knows about 
ANWR, right? This body moved in 
terms of legislation for leases. We did 
it the right way, with a law passed by 
the Senate and the House, signed by 
the President to move forward on 
leases. 
The first day on the job, the new 
President decides he is going to sus-
pend everything with regard to ANWR. 
OK, that wasn’t a surprise, to be hon-
est, but, of course, it was a huge dis-
appointment. I am not sure it is legal. 
Like I said, we did it the legal way. He 
is doing it the old-fashioned, ‘‘Obama 
pen and phone’’ way. There are prob-
ably a lot of questionable legalities 
there. That is one. We were expecting 
that. 
Here is the other one. We have an-
other part of Alaska called the Na-
tional Petroleum Reserve in Alaska, 
set aside by Congress for oil and gas de-
velopment. It is not controversial. We 
have been doing it for decades. It was 
originally called the Naval Petroleum 
Reserve for America. This is not con-
troversial. And we have a lot of energy 
projects in the NPRA that are ongoing. 
Heck, even the Obama-Biden adminis-
tration allowed us to drill there be-
cause that is what Congress said for 
decades, and it is good for the country. 
We need energy. We need energy. So 
if we need it, shouldn’t we get it from 
America? Shouldn’t we get it from 
American workers? That is better than 
getting it from Russia. The NPRA is a 
really important area of America’s en-
ergy production in my State—the Na-
tional Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. It 
has been that way for decades. 
So there is a moratorium on any 
more permits for energy production in 
the NPRA yesterday. I woke up to text 
messages from Alaskans saying: Sen-
ator, help us. My little company is 
going to go out of business. I have to 
lay off a bunch of workers. 
Workers who are doing what? Pro-
ducing American energy. 
Since when was that bad, Mr. Presi-
dent? Since when was that bad? 
One more thing, they say: Well, it is 
only a 60-day moratorium. 
In Alaska, because we have the high-
est standards in the world on producing 
energy, exploring for energy, we only 
do exploration in the winter. It costs 
more for energy companies. Why do we 
do that? Because it is the high stand-
ards that we have—the highest stand-
ards of any place on the planet Earth. 
What do I mean by that? 
We build what are called ice roads 
and ice pads on the tundra when we ex-
plore and when we drill. That means we 
just do it in the winter. You build 
these ice roads and ice pads that cost a 
lot of money and when you move equip-
ment across the tundra on ice, you 
drill for 3 months and when the winter 
is over, you move it off. The ice melts, 
and there is not one tiny impact. It is 
called zero-impact drilling and explo-
ration. 
I used to be in charge of this in Alas-
ka. I am very familiar with it. We have 
the highest standards on the planet. So 
if you put a 60-day moratorium on 
drilling on the NPRA, guess what. You 
lose the whole season. You lose the 
whole season. That is what the Biden 
Administration did yesterday. I lit-
erally have people back home in my 
great State calling frantically saying 
hundreds—if not thousands—of jobs are 
at risk. That was day two of the Biden 
Administration: Let’s crush every sin-
gle energy job in America. 
Why? I don’t know why. I don’t know 
why. 
Since when is it bad to produce en-
ergy for your fellow Americans? We 
need it. We have the highest standards 
in the world. These are great middle- 
class jobs. But on day one in this ad-
ministration, they are attacking the

men and women who produce energy 
for this great Nation—shameful. 
Now, it is not just me who is a little 
bit upset. You can tell I am a little bit 
upset. The Keystone pipeline was can-
celed again—again, no idea why they 
would do that. There is nothing about 
climate change. As a matter of fact, 
that pipeline was going to be all union 
jobs, and they had it developed and 
worked on in a way that was going to 
be emissions neutral. 
Here is the head of the Laborers’ 
International Union of North Amer-
ica—LIUNA, 
the 
laborers. 
Terry 
O’Sullivan is a great American. I know 
him well. His father was a marine. He 
served in the Chosin Reservoir during 
the Korean war. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a statement by Terry O’Sullivan on be-
half of the Laborers’ International 
Union of North America. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
CANCELING KEYSTONE KILLS UNION JOBS 
KILLING GOOD UNION JOBS ON DAY ONE WITH 
NOTHING TO REPLACE THEM, IS NOT BUILDING 
BACK BETTER 
WASHINGTON, DC (January 20, 2021).—Terry 
O’Sullivan, General President of LIUNA—the 
Laborers’ International 
Union 
of 
North 
America—made 
the 
following 
statement 
today: 
The Biden Administration’s decision to 
cancel the Keystone XL pipeline permit on 
day one of his presidency is both insulting 
and disappointing to the thousands of hard-
working LIUNA members who will lose good- 
paying, middle class family-supporting jobs. 
By blocking this 100 percent union project, 
and pandering to environmental extremists, 
a thousand union jobs will immediately van-
ish and 10,000 additional jobs will be fore-
gone. 
We had hoped the new Administration 
would make a decision based on the facts as 
they are today, not as they were perceived 
years ago. The Keystone XL pipeline of 
today is dramatically different than the 
pipeline rejected while President Biden was 
in the Obama Administration. In an agree-
ment with North America’s Building Trades 
Unions, the project owner, TC Energy, had 
committed $1.7 billion to operate the pipe-
line with renewable energy and achieve net- 
zero emission within two years—all using 
union workers. Their commitment amounted 
to the equivalent of taking 650,000 cars off 
the road, one of the largest renewable energy 
investments ever. 
We support the President’s campaign to 
‘‘build back better.’’ But for union members 
affected by this decision, there are no renew-
able energy jobs that come even close to re-
placing the wages and benefits the Keystone 
XL project would have provided. Killing good 
union jobs on day one with nothing to re-
place them, is not building back better. 
Hopefully, the Biden Administration will not 
continue to allow environmental extremists 
to control our country’s energy agenda at 
the expense of union construction workers 
being forced to the unemployment lines. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. This is a statement 
by Terry O’Sullivan: 
The Biden Administration’s decision to 
cancel the Keystone XL pipeline permit on 
day one of his presidency is both insulting 
and disappointing to the thousands of hard- 
working LIUNA members who will lose good- 
paying, middle class family-supporting jobs. 
By the way, LIUNA is the largest 
labor union in construction, the largest 
labor construction union in America— 
500,000 members. 
By blocking this 100 percent union project, 
and pandering to environmental extremists, 
a thousand union jobs will immediately van-
ish and 10,000 additional jobs will be fore-
gone. 
That is day one. This isn’t me talk-
ing, the Senator from Alaska. This is 
the head of LIUNA. 
We support the President’s campaign to 
‘‘build back better.’’ But for union members 
affected by this decision, there are no renew-
able energy jobs that come even close to re-
placing the wages and benefits the Keystone 
XL project would have provided. Killing good 
union jobs on day one with nothing to re-
place them is not building back better. 
This is, again, Terry O’Sullivan, head 
of LIUNA. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have printed in the RECORD 
a statement by Mark McManus. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
Mark McManus, General President of the 
United Association: ‘‘In revoking this per-
mit, the Biden Administration has chosen to 
listen to the voices of fringe activists instead 
of union members and the American con-
sumer on Day 1. Let me be very clear: When 
built with union labor by the men and 
women of the United Association, pipelines 
like Keystone XL remain the safest and most 
efficient modes of energy transportation in 
the world. Sadly, the Biden Administration 
has now put thousands of union workers out 
of work. For the average American family, it 
means energy costs will go up and commu-
nities will no longer see the local invest-
ments that come with pipeline construc-
tion.’’ 
Mr. 
SULLIVAN. 
This 
is 
Mark 
McManus, General President of the 
United Association of Union Plumbers 
and Pipefitters. They were going to 
build the Keystone pipeline, too, just 
like the LIUNA members. 
In revoking this permit, the Biden Admin-
istration has chosen to listen to the voices of 
fringe activists instead of union members 
and the American consumer on Day 1. Let 
me be very clear: When built with union 
labor by the men and women of the United 
Association— 
Mr. McManus’s union— 
pipelines like Keystone XL remain the safest 
and most efficient modes of energy transpor-
tation in the world. Sadly, the Biden Admin-
istration has now put thousands of union 
workers out of work. 
Let me close with this. There are a 
number of Senators who want to meet 
directly with the President on this 
issue. By the way, when they made 
these announcements about Alaska, no 
one from the Biden Administration 
reached out. No one called me. No one 
called Senator MURKOWSKI. No one 
called Congressman YOUNG. You would 
think if they were going to kill hun-
dreds, if not thousands, of jobs in your 
State, 
that 
somebody 
would 
have 
reached out to us. 
I just spent the last week working 
hard to make sure the Biden Adminis-
tration’s Secretary of Defense got con-
firmed. I probably worked harder than 
any other Senator in this body on that 
issue. I did that because I think it is 
going to be good for the military, good 
for America. 
But we are trying. We are trying. I 
haven’t heard from one person on the 
Biden Administration. A number of us 
tried to request a meeting with the 
President. The President talks a lot 
about 
his 
blue-collar 
background. 
Great, but guess what: The President is 
killing blue-collar jobs right now by 
the thousands. A lot of them are in my 
State. 
I hope somebody in the new adminis-
tration is listening to this. I hope he 
realizes what he is doing. We are in 
this pandemic. Our economy needs to 
grow. We have high unemployment. 
The idea that you would start your ad-
ministration by targeting the men and 
women who have built this great Na-
tion, who have good-paying jobs is as-
tounding to me. 
Mr. President—I am not talking 
about the President of the Senate, 
Madam President, I am talking about 
the President of the United States— 
you need to listen to us. This is not a 
good start. You talked in your inau-
guration about putting yourself in 
other people’s shoes. Well, I hope you 
put yourself in the shoes of the energy 
workers in America whom you are 
crushing right now. Put yourself in 
their shoes and maybe rethink these 
crazy, crazy policies that are only 
harming Americans throughout the 
country. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
(Mr. WARNER assumed the chair.) 
(Mrs. 
GILLIBRAND 
assumed 
the 
chair.) 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KAINE). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
IMPEACHMENT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
have made good progress in our efforts 
to determine the timing and structure 
of the impeachment trial of Donald J. 
Trump. 
For the information of all Senators, 
the House managers will come to read 
the Article of Impeachment at 7 p.m. 
on Monday, January 25. Members will 
then be sworn in the next day, Tues-
day, January 26. 
After that, both the House managers 
and the defense will have a period of 
time to draft their legal briefs, just as 
they did in previous trials. During that 
period, the Senate will continue to do 
other business for the American people,

relief for millions of Americans who 
are suffering during this pandemic. 
Then, once the briefs are drafted,

The January 6 insurrection at the 
Capitol, incited by Donald J. Trump, is 
a day none of us will ever forget. We all 
want to put this awful chapter in our 
Nation’s history behind us, but healing 
and unity will only come if there is 
truth and accountability, and that is 
what this trial will provide. 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF LLOYD JAMES 
AUSTIN 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, yester-
day, I voted for H.R. 335, which waived 
the requirement that a commissioned 
officer be retired from the military for 
at least 7 years before serving as Sec-
retary of Defense. I believe civilian 
control and strong civilian-military re-
lations strengthens our democracy. 
Congress designed the waiver process 
to guarantee that someone dedicated 
to the principle of civilian control can 
lead our military and to prevent the 
politicization of the officer corps. I 
continue to believe that the waiver 
should only be granted in unique cases. 
Secretary Austin is uniquely qualified 
to lead at this moment in our coun-
try’s history, which is why I voted for 
his waiver. I believe Secretary Austin 
will work to maintain the safety and 
integrity of our institutions and fur-
ther our Nation’s interests at home and 
abroad. In the future, I will review any 
waiver that comes before this body 
with the care and consideration befit-
ting this process and subject. 
f 
200TH ANNIVERSARY OF CANTON, 
MAINE 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today to commemorate the 200th anni-
versary of the Town of Canton, ME. 
Canton was built with a spirit of deter-
mination 
and 
resiliency 
that 
still 
guides the community today, and this 
is a time to celebrate the generations 
of hard-working and caring people who 
have made it such a wonderful place to 
live, work, and raise families. 
The year of Canton’s incorporation, 
1821, was but one milestone in a long 
journey of progress. For thousands of 
years, the land of fields, rivers, lakes, 
and forests of what is now Oxford 
County was the home of the Abenaki 
Tribe, and Canton Point, or Rokomeko, 
was 
the 
headquarters 
of 
the 
Anasagunticook Band of the People of 
the Dawn. The reverence the Abenaki 
had for the natural beauty and re-
sources of the region is upheld by the 
people of Canton today. 
In the 1790s, following America’s 
independence, 
an 
early 
settlement 
called Phipp’s Canada was established. 
Maine achieved statehood in 1820, and 
on February 5 of the following year, 
the town of Canton was incorporated. 
With the mighty Androscoggin River 
providing power, Canton soon was 
home to lumber and grain mills, along 
with many other small industries. 
When the first paper mill opened in 
nearby Rumford in 1893, the people of 
Canton were part of the skilled and 
dedicated workforce that built a great 
Maine industry. The prosperity pro-
duced by hard work and determination 
was invested in schools and churches to 
create a true community. 
Maine is known as ‘‘Vacationland,’’ 
and Canton has played a key role in 
the development of our State’s tourism 
industry. A guidebook to the region 
published in 1888 described the eastern-
most town in Oxford County as ‘‘one of 
the most beautiful and charming in all 
this attractive region.’’ With guests ar-
riving by train and, later, by bus and 
car, some of the first family vacation 
resorts were established on the shores 
of Lake Anasagunticook. Today, visi-
tors and residents alike enjoy Canton’s 
scenery, history, and outdoor recre-
ation opportunities. The energy and 
planning that are going into Canton’s 
yearlong bicentennial celebration dem-
onstrate the pride townspeople have in 
their town. 
The celebration of Canton’s 200th an-
niversary is not merely about the pass-
ing of time. It is about human accom-
plishment. We celebrate the people 
who, from the dawn of our Nation to 
our time, have pulled together, cared 
for one another, and built a great com-
munity. Thanks to those who came be-
fore, Canton, ME, has a wonderful his-
tory. Thanks to those there today, it 
has a bright future.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING JAMES ‘‘JIM’’ 
MILLIMAN 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, today we 
honor the life and legacy of a great 
Kentuckian, James ‘‘Jim’’ Milliman. 
Jim was born October 29, 1942, in Nor-
walk, OH. He led a life of faith, passion 
for the law, and an unmatched enthu-
siasm for Notre Dame football. Jim at-
tended Notre Dame, then earned his 
law degree from the University of Lou-
isville Brandeis School of Law, which 
is where he would embark on a bril-
liant career as a lawyer. 
Jim began his legal career at Mid-
dleton-Reutlinger Law firm, where he 
most notably appeared in the U.S. Su-
preme Court confirming his defendant’s 
constitutional right to a speedy trial. 
He would continue his work fighting 
for the little guy always advocating for 
equal justice under the law. After a 
long successful tenure practicing law, 
Jim shifted to being my State director. 
With Jim’s guidance, my staff and I 
have been able to fight for Kentuckians 
in Washington and throughout the 
State. The feats we have accomplished 
would not have been possible without 
the mentorship of Jim Milliman. 
Jim passed January 5, 2021. A true 
testament to his impact on people, 
Jim’s eulogy was not given by any of 
his law partners, business, or political 
friends—he 
had 
plenty—but 
by 
Muhammed Lasege, a former Univer-
sity of Louisville basketball star from 
Nigeria whose college career was cut 
short due to eligibility issues. A suc-
cessful businessman himself, he told 
the story of how Jim provided guidance 
and hope when his basketball dreams 
were crushed. He described their rela-
tionship of a father-son bond, despite 
the fact that Jim never had a son and 
Muhammed never knew his father. 
While our hearts are heavy acknowl-
edging Jim’s passing, we reminisce 
with great joy remembering all our ac-
complishments, but most of all our 
friendship. May Jim Milliman rest in 
peace.∑

January 22, 2021 
SENATE 
RESOLUTION 
13—EX-
PRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
THE 
INTER-
NATIONAL OLYMPIC COMMITTEE 
SHOULD REBID THE 2022 WINTER 
OLYMPIC GAMES TO BE HOSTED 
BY A COUNTRY THAT RECOG-
NIZES 
AND 
RESPECTS 
HUMAN 
RIGHTS 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida (for himself, 
Mr. BRAUN, Mr. RUBIO, Mr. YOUNG, Mr. 
COTTON, Mr. INHOFE, and Mrs. BLACK-
BURN) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 13 
Whereas the International Olympic Com-
mittee announced Beijing, People’s Republic 
of China, as the host city of the 2022 Winter 
Olympic Games; 
Whereas the Olympic charter states that 
the goal of Olympism is to promote ‘‘a peace-
ful society concerned with the preservation 
of human dignity’’; 
Whereas, on January 19, 2021, the Depart-
ment of State determined that the Com-
munist Party of China has committed geno-
cide against the predominantly Muslim 
Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious mi-
nority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Auton-
omous Region (XUAR); 
Whereas the 2020 Trafficking in Persons 
Report of the Department of State relating 
to the People’s Republic of China indicates 
that— 
(1) authorities in the People’s Republic of 
China have arbitrarily detained more than 
1,000,000 ethnic Muslims, including Uyghur, 
ethnic Kazakh, and Kyrgyz individuals, in as 
many as 1,200 ‘‘vocational training centers’’, 
which are internment camps designed to 
erase ethnic and religious identities; 
(2) the national household registry system 
of the People’s Republic of China restricts 
the freedom of rural inhabitants to legally 
change their workplace or residence, placing 
the internal migrant population of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China at high risk of forced 
labor in brick kilns, coal mines, and fac-
tories; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China subjects Christians and members 
of other religious groups to forced labor in 
brick kilns, food processing centers, and fac-
tories as part of detention for the purpose of 
ideological indoctrination; and 
(4) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China provides financial incentives for 
companies to open factories near the intern-
ment camps, and local governments receive 
additional funds from the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China for each inmate 
forced to work in an internment camp; 
Whereas, in June 2020, the Associated Press 
reported that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China uses forced birth control, steri-
lizations, and abortions on Uyghur and other 
minority women to diminish the birth rate 
among Muslim populations; and 
(2) Uyghur and other minority women are 
subjected to internment camps and large 
fines for giving birth to too many children, 
which is subjectively defined by the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China; 
Whereas, in October 2019, Radio Free Asia 
reported that— 
(1) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China, as part of its Pair Up and Be-
come Family program, assigns male Han 
Chinese ‘‘relatives’’ to monitor the homes of 
Uyghur families in the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region and to regularly sleep in 
the same beds as the wives of men detained 
in the internment camps of the region; and 
(2) Uyghur individuals who protest hosting 
‘‘relatives’’ or refuse to take part in study 
sessions or other activities with the officials 
in their homes are subject to additional re-
strictions and may face detention in the in-
ternment camps; 
Whereas, in July 2019, Australia, Austria, 
Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Estonia, Fin-
land, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, 
Japan, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, the 
Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Spain, 
Sweden, Switzerland, and the United King-
dom jointly condemned the arbitrary deten-
tion and surveillance of Uyghur individuals 
and other minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur 
Autonomous Region; 
Whereas, in June 2019, the Independent Tri-
bunal Into Forced Organ Harvesting from 
Prisoners of Conscience in China of the 
China Tribunal found that— 
(1) forced organ harvesting has been car-
ried out for years throughout the People’s 
Republic of China on a significant scale, and 
practitioners of Falun Gong have been the 
main source of organs; and 
(2) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China has committed crimes against 
humanity with respect to Uyghur individuals 
and practitioners of Falun Gong; 
Whereas the report of Freedom House enti-
tled ‘‘Freedom in the World 2019’’ indicates 
that— 
(1) women, ethnic and religious minorities, 
and the LGBT community in the People’s 
Republic of China have no opportunity to 
gain meaningful political representation and 
are barred from advancing their interests 
outside the formal structures of the Com-
munist Party of China; 
(2) foreign journalists in the People’s Re-
public of China were surveilled, harassed, 
physically abused, detained to prevent meet-
ings with certain individuals, and had their 
visas withheld; 
(3) hundreds of Falun Gong practitioners 
have recently received long prison terms, 
and many other individuals were arbitrarily 
detained in various ‘‘legal education’’ facili-
ties, where they were tortured, sometimes 
fatally, until they abandoned their beliefs; 
(4) limitations on due process in the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, including the exces-
sive use of pretrial detention, are rampant, 
and an extended crackdown on human rights 
lawyers has weakened the access of defend-
ants to independent legal counsel; and 
(5) individuals attempting to petition the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China with respect to grievances or injus-
tices are routinely intercepted in their ef-
forts to travel to Beijing, forcefully returned 
to their hometowns, or subjected to extra-
legal detention in ‘‘black jails’’, psychiatric 
institutions, and other sites at which they 
are at risk of abuse; 
Whereas the annual report of the U.S. Con-
gressional-Executive Commission on China 
for 2019 indicates that— 
(1) the one-party authoritarian political 
system of the People’s Republic of China de-
prives the people of the People’s Republic of 
China of their right to meaningfully partici-
pate in electoral processes and public life 
generally; 
(2) in 2019, the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China detained and prosecuted 
individuals who criticized government offi-
cials and policies online and censored or dis-
torted a range of news and information that 
the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China considered ‘‘politically sensitive’’, in-
cluding— 
(A) the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen 
Square massacre; 
(B) human rights abuses in the Xinjiang 
Uyghur Autonomous Region; and 
(C) the protests in Hong Kong against pro-
posed extradition legislation; 
(3) Hong Kong authorities, under the influ-
ence of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China, violated fundamental free-
doms of the people of Hong Kong, as articu-
lated in the Basic Law, including the free-
doms of expression, association, and assem-
bly; 
(4) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic 
of 
China 
has 
used 
propaganda, 
disinformation, and censorship in an attempt 
to shape reporting on the Hong Kong pro-
tests, attributing the protests to influence 
by ‘‘foreign forces’’, and threatening pro-
testers in Hong Kong; 
(5) officials of the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China and the Communist 
Party of China continue to abuse criminal 
law and police power to punish critics and 
‘‘maintain stability’’ with the goal of perpet-
uating 
one-party 
rule, 
often 
targeting 
human rights advocates, religious believers, 
and ethnic minority groups; and 
(6) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China is likely committing crimes 
against humanity; 
Whereas, before the 2008 Summer Olympics 
were held in Beijing, the Department of 
State Country Report on Human Rights 
Practices for 2006 reported that the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China prac-
ticed severe cultural and religious repression 
of minorities, especially of Uyghur individ-
uals in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Re-
gion, and according to the Department of 
State Country Reports on Human Rights 
Practices for 2018, such repression has inten-
sified since the 2008 Summer Olympics in 
Beijing; 
Whereas four Special Rapporteurs of the 
United Nations have urged the governing au-
thorities in Hong Kong and the People’s Re-
public of China to ensure protestors in Hong 
Kong may fully exercise the right to peace-
fully assemble, including— 
(1) the Special Rapporteur on the pro-
motion and protection of the right to free-
dom of opinion and expression; 
(2) the Special Rapporteur on the situation 
of human rights defenders; 
(3) the Special Rapporteur on the rights to 
freedom of peaceful assembly and of associa-
tion; and 
(4) the Special Rapporteur on torture and 
other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment 
or punishment; 
Whereas police in Hong Kong have arrested 
more than 6,000 individuals and fired more 
than 16,000 rounds of tear gas during the 
seven months of protests by people of Hong 
Kong seeking to uphold their liberties and 
the autonomy of Hong Kong, as articulated 
in the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Re-
public of China (referred to in this preamble 
as the ‘‘Basic Law’’); 
Whereas, the Law of the People’s Republic 
of China on Safeguarding National Security 
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion (referred to in this preamble as the 
‘‘Hong Kong national security law’’) is im-
plemented to suppress pro-democracy dem-
onstrators and remove the rights and lib-
erties from the people of Hong Kong guaran-
teed in the Basic Law; 
Whereas the report of the Network of Chi-
nese Human Rights Defenders entitled ‘‘De-
fending Rights in a ‘No Rights Zone’: Annual 
Report on the Situation of Human Rights 
Defenders in China (2018)’’ indicates that— 
(1) authorities in the People’s Republic of 
China continue to charge Tibetans with ‘‘in-
citing separatism’’ for expressing political or 
religious dissent and impose heavy prison 
sentences on such individuals; 
(2) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China continues to implement its dra-
conian 2017 cybersecurity law, which author-
izes invasive cyber surveillance and provides

broad authority to restrict and penalize on-
line expression; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China intends to have ‘‘full coverage, 
connectivity, and control’’ of the entire Peo-
ple’s Republic of China by police video sur-
veillance; and 
(4) the Government of the People’s Repub-
lic of China boldly retaliates against human 
rights advocates for their work upholding 
international 
standards 
and 
cooperating 
with the United Nations human rights mech-
anisms; 
Whereas, in January 2020, the editorial 
board of The Washington Post questioned 
whether the People’s Republic of China 
should ‘‘be allowed to host the 2022 Winter 
Olympics in one city while running con-
centration camps in another’’; and 
Whereas the flagrant human rights abuses 
committed by the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China are inconsistent with 
Olympic values: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That— 
(1) the Senate supports the values of 
Olympism and the principles of Team USA 
with respect to the protection of— 
(A) the rights, safety, and well-being of 
athletes; and 
(B) the integrity of sport; and 
(2) it is the sense of the Senate that, con-
sistent with the principles of the Inter-
national Olympic Committee, unless the 
Government of the People’s Republic of 
China demonstrates significant progress in 
securing fundamental human rights, includ-
ing the freedoms of religion, speech, move-
ment, association, and assembly, the Inter-
national Olympic Committee should rebid 
the 2022 Winter Olympics to be hosted by a 
country that recognizes and respects human 
rights.

14—DESIG-
NATING 
JANUARY 
23, 
2021, 
AS 
‘‘MATERNAL 
HEALTH 
AWARE-
NESS DAY’’ 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. 
MENENDEZ) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 14 
Whereas, every year in the United States, 
approximately 700 women die as a result of 
complications related to pregnancy and 
childbirth; 
Whereas the pregnancy-related mortality 
ratio, defined as the number of pregnancy-re-
lated deaths per 100,000 live births, more 
than doubled between 1987 and 2017; 
Whereas the United States is the only de-
veloped country whose maternal mortality 
rate has increased over the last several dec-
ades; 
Whereas, of all pregnancy-related deaths 
between 2011 and 2016— 
(1) nearly 32 percent occurred during preg-
nancy; 
(2) about 35 percent occurred during child-
birth or the week after childbirth; and 
(3) 33 percent occurred between 1 week and 
1 year postpartum; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of maternal 
deaths in the United States are preventable; 
Whereas, in 2014 alone, 50,000 women suf-
fered from a ‘‘near miss’’ or severe maternal 
morbidity, which includes potentially life- 
threatening complications that arise from 
labor and childbirth; 
Whereas around 17 percent of women who 
gave birth in a hospital in the United States 
reported experiencing 1 or more types of mis-
treatment, such as— 
(1) loss of autonomy; 
(2) being shouted at, scolded, or threat-
ened; and 
(3) being ignored or refused or receiving no 
response to requests for help; 
Whereas certain social determinants of 
health, including bias and racism, have a 
negative impact on maternal health out-
comes; 
Whereas significant disparities in maternal 
health exist, including that— 
(1) Black women are more than 3 times as 
likely to die from a pregnancy-related cause 
as are White women; 
(2) American Indian and Alaska Native 
women are more than twice as likely to die 
from a pregnancy-related cause as are White 
women; 
(3) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Na-
tive women with at least some college edu-
cation are more likely to die from a preg-
nancy-related cause than are women of all 
other racial and ethnic backgrounds with 
less than a high school diploma; 
(4) Black, American Indian, and Alaska Na-
tive women are about twice as likely to suf-
fer from severe maternal morbidity as are 
White women; 
(5) women who live in rural areas have a 
greater likelihood of severe maternal mor-
bidity and mortality compared to women 
who live in urban areas; 
(6) less than 1⁄2 of rural counties have a hos-
pital with obstetric services; 
(7) counties with more Black and Hispanic 
residents and lower median incomes are less 
likely to have access to hospital obstetric 
services; 
(8) more than 50 percent of women who live 
in a rural area must travel more than 30 
minutes to access hospital obstetric services, 
compared to 7 percent of women who live in 
urban areas; and 
(9) American Indian and Alaska Native 
women living in rural communities are twice 
as likely as their White counterparts to re-
port receiving late or no prenatal care; 
Whereas pregnant women may be at in-
creased risk for severe outcomes associated 
with COVID–19, as— 
(1) pregnant women with symptomatic 
COVID–19 are more likely to be admitted to 
an intensive care unit, receive invasive ven-
tilation, and receive ECMO treatment, com-
pared to nonpregnant women with sympto-
matic COVID–19; 
(2) pregnant women with symptomatic 
COVID–19 are at a 70-percent increased risk 
for death compared to nonpregnant women 
with symptomatic COVID–19; and 
(3) pregnant women with COVID–19 may be 
at risk for preterm delivery; 
Whereas more than 40 States have des-
ignated committees to review maternal 
deaths; 
Whereas State and local maternal mor-
tality review committees are positioned to 
comprehensively assess maternal deaths and 
identify opportunities for prevention; 
Whereas more than 30 States are partici-
pating in the Alliance for Innovation on Ma-
ternal Health, which promotes consistent 
and safe maternity care to reduce maternal 
morbidity and mortality; 
Whereas 
community-based 
maternal 
health care models, including midwifery 
childbirth services, doula support services, 
community and perinatal health worker 
services, and group prenatal care, in collabo-
ration with culturally competent physician 
care, show great promise in improving ma-
ternal health outcomes and reducing dispari-
ties in maternal health outcomes; 
Whereas many organizations have imple-
mented initiatives to educate patients and 
providers about— 
(1) all causes of, contributing factors to, 
and disparities in maternal mortality; 
(2) the prevention of pregnancy-related 
deaths; and 
(3) the importance of listening to and em-
powering all women to report pregnancy-re-
lated medical issues; and 
Whereas several States, communities, and 
organizations recognize January 23 as ‘‘Ma-
ternal Health Awareness Day’’ to raise 
awareness about maternal health and pro-
mote maternal safety: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates January 23, 2021, as ‘‘Mater-
nal Health Awareness Day’’; 
(2) supports the goals and ideals of Mater-
nal Health Awareness Day, including— 
(A) raising public awareness about mater-
nal mortality, maternal morbidity, and dis-
parities in maternal health outcomes; and 
(B) encouraging the Federal Government, 
States, territories, Tribes, local commu-
nities, public health organizations, physi-
cians, health care providers, and others to 
take action to reduce adverse maternal 
health outcomes and improve maternal safe-
ty; 
(3) promotes initiatives— 
(A) to address and eliminate disparities in 
maternal health outcomes; and 
(B) to ensure respectful and equitable ma-
ternity care practices; 
(4) honors those who have passed away as a 
result of pregnancy-related causes; and 
(5) supports and recognizes the need for 
further investments in efforts to improve 
maternal health, eliminate disparities in 
maternal health outcomes, and promote re-
spectful and equitable maternity care prac-
tices.
