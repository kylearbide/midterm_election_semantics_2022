The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC,

ENHANCE, DON’T CUT, SOCIAL 
SECURITY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Connecticut (Mr. LARSON) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. LARSON of Connecticut. Madam 
Speaker, the COVID virus has impacted 
our senior citizens more severely than 
any other population. With over 1 mil-
lion deaths now in the country, more 
than 750,000 of them are people over the 
age of 65. 
This 
global 
pandemic 
has 
also 
brought with it inflation, as well, and 
people on fixed incomes are the people 
who are most hurt by inflation. 
Madam Speaker, those are our fellow 
senior citizens who are struggling now 
in this pandemic. Martin Luther King 
used to say that it is important to al-
ways recognize the fierce urgency of 
now. The fierce urgency for the 65 mil-
lion Americans on Social Security is 
that we do something now. 
It has been more than 51 years since 
Congress 
enhanced 
Social 
Security 
benefits. This is not something the 
President can do by executive order, al-
though I commend President Biden for 
his straightforward support of Social 
Security, calling it a sacred trust with 
the American people. Indeed, it is. 
Now, in the midst of this pandemic 
and in the midst of what has transpired 
with regard to inflation, our senior 
citizens need direct relief from Con-
gress. Congress is the only body that 
can provide it. 
The good news is that President 
Biden and the House of Representatives 
have a bill to do just that, a bill that 
will enhance benefits that haven’t been 
taken up in more than 51 years. People 
will see an across-the-board increase in 
their Social Security. People who were 
paying taxes on Social Security will no 
longer be paying those taxes. People 
who have gotten a COLA some years 
and other years not will now get a 
COLA based on their actual expenses. 
There will be no more waiting period 
for disability victims. 
There will also be the repeal of WEP 
and GPO, as the President of the 
United States has called for, making 
sure that firefighters, policemen, and 
teachers all across this country will 
now be able, as will their spouses, to 
receive the benefits that they richly 
deserve. 
These are consequential times that 
we live in, Madam Speaker, and the 
spotlight is upon us as we approach the 
summer recess. 
There are plans as to how to deal 
with Social Security, and they are 
pretty straightforward. The Repub-
licans have put forward three plans. 
RICK SCOTT from Florida calls for end-
ing Social Security in 5 years. The Re-
publican Study Group has more than 20 
specific cuts and a 21 percent across- 
the-board cut to Social Security by 
raising the age of Social Security re-
cipients. For every year you raise the 
age, it is a 7 percent cut. There is no 
logic to the fact that people are living 
longer so they should receive less. 
Madam Speaker, you know that, in 
1971, the last time Congress expanded 
Social 
Security 
benefits, 
Richard 
Nixon was President of the United 
States and a gallon of milk cost 72 
cents. There has not been an improve-
ment and enhancement to Social Secu-
rity since 1971. It is our responsibility 
as a Congress to do so. 
The Republicans have a plan. God 
bless his soul, Sam Johnson, who I ad-
mired, a Vietnam war hero, a person 
who had incredible integrity, put for-
ward a plan. His plan called for cuts in 
order to make Social Security solvent. 
The Democratic plan says, no, it is 
time to enhance Social Security. More 
than 5 million people live in poverty 
and 
receive 
a 
below-poverty-level 
check from their government. It is 
time for us to act. 
f 
PROTECT ENERGY GRID FROM 
GREEN NEW DEAL POLICIES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. JOYCE) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam 
Speaker, as temperatures rise, our en-
ergy grid has been left unprepared to 
keep up with the power demands to 
keep up with this intense summer heat. 
Instead of investing in the coal, nat-
ural gas, and Marcellus shale that is 
under the feet of my constituents in 
Pennsylvania, 
President 
Biden 
has 
turned his back on my communities in

order to enact Green New Deal policies 
that fail to meet our energy needs, fail 
to meet the needs that, right now, in 
the heat of July, are expanding. 
It has become abundantly clear that 
solar panels and windmills cannot 
produce the power needed to keep the 
lights on and keep the air-conditioners 
humming. 
This failed pivot to radical energy 
policies that could lead to rolling 
blackouts and has led to skyrocketing 
electric bills across the country needs 
to be addressed and needs to be ad-
dressed right now. 
It is time for the Biden administra-
tion to protect our energy grid, and it 
is time to ensure that we are using the 
resources that we have right here at 
home to serve the American people. It 
is not time to turn to OPEC for addi-
tional support when we have the re-
sources right here in America. It is 
time that we come together and serve 
the American people with the resources 
that are right here in America. 
f 
WHITE HOUSE IS MISLEADING 
AMERICAN PEOPLE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
Tennessee (Mr. ROSE) for 5 minutes. 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, on July 
2, the President of the United States 
sent out this message to small business 
owners across America: ‘‘My message 
to the companies running gas stations 
and setting prices at the pump is sim-
ple: This is a time of war and global 
peril. Bring down the price you are 
charging at the pump to reflect the 
cost you are paying for the product, 
and do it now.’’ 
When I first read this message, I was 
perplexed. After all, the President 
should know that gas stations already 
offer their fuel at a price just slightly 
above what they buy from wholesalers. 
There is basically no room for cost sav-
ings at this final step in the supply 
chain. In fact, most gas stations make 
their money on what is sold in the con-
venience store and not at the gas 
pump. 
This ill-advised message does nothing 
to help solve the problem but only con-
fuses and angers the small business 
owners who own gas stations and con-
venience stores. Even billionaire Jeff 
Bezos called out the White House, say-
ing: ‘‘Inflation is far too important a 
problem for the White House to keep 
making statements like this. It is ei-
ther straight-ahead misdirection or a 
deep misunderstanding of basic market 
dynamics.’’ 
I agree with Mr. Bezos. This is far too 
important of an issue for the White 
House to keep misleading the Amer-
ican 
people. 
Apparently, 
President 
Biden missed the lesson on economics 
the day they studied it in class, or 
maybe he has just forgotten what he 
learned. 
The bottom line is that the President 
needs to take this issue more seriously 
and stop pointing the blame at others. 
First, it was Russia; then, it was the 
oil companies; and now, it is the gas 
station owners. It is only a matter of 
time until the President finds a way to 
blame this on Republicans or perhaps 
former President Trump. 
Ultimately, the buck stops at the 
White House, and the President must 
take responsibility for his anti-energy 
policies that have made it more and 
more difficult to explore and drill for 
oil right here under our feet in the 
United States. 
f 
BAD BEHAVIOR AT NLRB 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from 
North Carolina (Ms. FOXX) for 5 min-
utes. 
Ms. FOXX. Madam Speaker, the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board, NLRB, 
under the Biden administration is so 
tightly wound around the little finger 
of union bosses that the circulation has 
been cut off entirely. Workers and em-
ployers are getting stiffed at every 
turn. 
Under Republican administrations, 
the NLRB took practical measures to 
protect the rights of workers and job 
creators. 
The 
times 
have 
indeed 
changed. 
The current NLRB’s radical leftward 
lurch proves one solitary thing: Demo-
crats will always twist themselves into 
a legislative pretzel to push the pro-
gressive policies of Big Labor. 
We are seeing a concentrated effort 
by the NLRB to expand Big Labor’s 
power. For instance, the NLRB is 
exhuming policies from days gone by 
like the Joy Silk doctrine, which would 
allow unions to organize a workplace 
without ever receiving majority sup-
port in a secret ballot election. By 
eviscerating the secret ballot, a hall-
mark of democratic elections, card 
check makes workers more vulnerable 
to harassment from union organizers. 
Don’t forget, a prominent union lead-
er testified before the House Education 
and Labor Committee that union work-
ers need workers’ personal information 
to harass them at the grocery store or 
in their own homes to pressure them 
into supporting the union. Their ad-
mission tells you all you need to know 
about the political hackery of unions 
today. 
The Biden-appointed NLRB general 
counsel 
has 
also 
challenged 
long-
standing precedent regarding employ-
ers’ rights to educate their employees 
about the downsides of union represen-
tation. 
General 
Counsel 
Jennifer 
Abruzzo believes that such efforts are 
at odds with the fundamental labor 
laws of this country. 
Yet, this precedent was established 
in 1948, and no other general counsel 
ever found reason to challenge such a 
significant precedent. Coincidence? I 
think not. 
With a union cheerleader as the 
NLRB general counsel, the current 
NLRB is hell-bent on supporting the 
agenda of union bosses. Abruzzo is a 
former union executive and is pushing 
radical pro-union policies. 
Having former union employees serve 
in a union-regulating agency creates a 
clear conflict of interest. But under the 
Biden administration, this is the norm, 
not the exception. 
Every level of the NLRB, and the 
Biden administration, is packed with 
former union employees. Even his 
Labor Secretary was a former union 
boss who still walks the picket lines. 
But such actions are totally on brand 
for 
this 
administration. 
President 
Biden swore to be the ‘‘most pro-union 
President’’ in American history, and 
Big Labor is now the kingpin of this 
administration. At this rate, President 
Biden might as well be a stooge. 
Republicans must work to rein in the 
NLRB union’s zealotry. Its heavy- 
handed actions infringe upon the free-
doms of workers and hamstring em-
ployers.

INFLATION DENIAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair recognizes the gentleman from 
California (Mr. LAMALFA) for 5 min-
utes. 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
President Biden has allowed the Amer-
ican people and Main Street businesses 
to suffer while his reckless spending 
policies continue to make things even 
worse. 
With this crisis weighing heavy on us 
all, the President and Senate Demo-
crats are pushing to add a trillion dol-
lars in higher taxes on Main Street 
small businesses. That will only lead to 
more higher prices, wage cuts, and sup-
ply shortages, exacerbating the infla-
tion problem significantly. 
Instead of working to address Amer-
ica’s inflation crisis, House Democrats 
will spend this week pushing for tril-
lions more in government spending, 
which will only worsen America’s infla-
tion crisis further. 
Instead of addressing the economic 
crisis, Democrats are prioritizing lib-
eral initiatives and increasing Federal 
spending with some accounts receiving 
double-digit and triple-digit percentage 
increases. 
Some of these out-of-touch woke 
spending priorities include taxpayer- 
funded abortion. Funding for FDA—the 
same agency that failed to prevent the 
infant formula crisis—has increased 10 
percent. And partisan climate change 
initiatives, even though the American 
people are facing the highest gas prices 
on record. 
The American people don’t need any 
of these far-left priorities. 
They need a responsible spending 
plan. 
They need the Biden administration 
to unleash American energy independ-
ence and domestic production. 
They need the Republicans to stop 
the 
Biden 
administration’s 
radical 
policies 
from 
driving 
our 
Nation 
straight into another recession.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6685 
July 18, 2022 
President Biden’s denial of inflation 
that his policies have created are lead-
ing the Nation straight into said reces-
sion. 
Last week, June’s Consumer Price 
Index score came out and revealed that 
inflation has soared 9.1 percent. That is 
right, the largest 12-month increase in 
over four decades. I kind of believe 9.1 
percent might be a lowball number 
when it gets right down to kitchen- 
table issues that regular, everyday 
Americans have to deal with. So even 
though inflation is up by 9.1 percent, 
the American people are paying far 
more for just about everything, such as 
gas, approximately 44 percent; airline 
tickets, 33 percent; used cars, 23 per-
cent; hotels, 23 percent; suits, 22 per-
cent; bacon, 18 percent; oranges, 17 per-
cent; tires, 16 percent; furniture, 15 per-
cent; milk, 15 percent; coffee, 14 per-
cent; deliveries, 14 percent; bread, 14 
percent; baby food—if you can find it— 
13 percent; soup, 13 percent; cereal, 12 
percent; eggs, 10 percent; dry cleaning, 
10 percent; then the rents on their 
homes and apartments and such, aver-
aging about 30 percent. 
And we saw that a little over a year 
and a half ago, lumber had gone up 
quadruple. It is coming back, but it is 
still double of 2 years ago for lumber in 
order to build homes and build any-
thing else. 
So where are we at? These out-
rageous prices are crushing the Amer-
ican Dream. 
Last July, the President claimed 
that inflation was only transitory; that 
if we continued down this administra-
tion’s path, then prices would go down 
again. 
Certainly. Right. 
Obviously, that was false. 
Now it is the blame game: Putin. The 
war in Ukraine. Gas stations. Or Re-
publicans. We are not the ones doing 
the big spending. 
Inflation is indeed a tax on all Amer-
icans. It is caused by Biden and the 
House Democrats’ out-of-control spend-
ing—trillions without accountability. 
Small businesses can’t afford the in-
crease of input costs across the board. 
Farmers’ fertilizer and all the other 
things that you would use to grow 
something, build something, manufac-
ture something, are driven at their 
core by high energy costs. That is at 
the base of everything, energy costs. 
So workers are effectively—because 
of all these costs—really seeing their 
wages cut. Even though they have seen 
some increases on paper, the higher 
costs of doing everything is hurting 
low- 
and 
middle-income 
Americans 
badly. 
What I hear coming out of Sac-
ramento and out of the White House 
doesn’t seem to be helping. It seems to 
be more focused on a handful of agenda 
items. The religion of climate change— 
which, by the way, I will remind you 
again, carbon dioxide is only 0.04 per-
cent of our atmosphere. 
So we have to get back to business 
and rely on Americans to do business 
and produce things domestically. Let’s 
not import all this stuff from China. 
We don’t need their stuff. We can make 
it here. We can make it efficiently. We 
can make it more ecologically sound 
with our energy than it can be done 
anywhere else in the world. 
Madam Speaker, let’s put Americans 
back to work and let’s get the govern-
ment off their backs and out of their 
wallets.

PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, call us into Your presence 
this day, that we, with full abandon, 
would run into Your loving embrace 
and receive the plenteous gifts You de-
sire to lavish upon us. 
What an image. Your love is so wel-
coming. Your concern for our welfare 
so strong, and Your generosity over-
whelming. We are humbled by Your 
grace. 
Held in Your everlasting arms, may 
we find the courage to ask for Your 
wisdom and guidance, that we would 
receive; to seek to discern what is good 
and right, that we may find; and to 
knock on doors barricaded by doubt 
and despair, that even these would be 
opened to us. 
O God, You are the source of our 
every hope, the answer for all we seek, 
and the treasure we hope to be opened 
to us. In this knowledge, may our joy 
be complete. 
In Your loving name we pray. 
Amen.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands 
(Ms. PLASKETT) come forward and lead 
the House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Ms. PLASKETT led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
JOB EXPANSION 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this 
June, the private sector added 372,000 
jobs to the economy, surpassing pre- 
pandemic levels. 
I would recognize the leadership of 
the 
Biden 
administration 
and 
my 
Democratic colleagues in Congress for 
taking swift action to strengthen the 
economy through robust job expansion. 
Since President Biden took office, 
the economy has added over 9 million 
jobs, and the unemployment rate has 
decreased from 6.4 percent to 3.6 per-
cent after losing 3 million jobs during 
the pandemic. 
The price of oil is decreasing due to 
the leadership of President Biden. De-
spite high inflation rates, today, we are 
seeing 
the 
strongest 
economy 
for 
American workers in decades. People 
are receiving higher wages, increased 
benefits, and better jobs overall. 
House Democrats will keep working 
to develop the labor market, underpin 
economic progress, and prioritize ex-
panding accessible and inclusive em-
ployment opportunities for American 
people, because that is who we care 
about. 
f 
RECOGNIZING TOM LANIER 
(Ms. FOXX asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize a very soothing, informed, and 
familiar voice in the High Country in 
North Carolina: Tom Lanier. 
On July 23, Tom will be celebrating 
his 50th year on the air at WATA in 
Boone—a monumental milestone. 
In both Boone and surrounding areas, 
he is highly regarded as a true staple 
as he continues his early morning radio 
program without fanfare. With half a 
century of serving the High Country, 
you would be hard-pressed to find 
someone who does not know of Tom 
and his commitment to keeping people 
informed. 
Tom, the service you continue to pro-
vide to our community is invaluable, 
and it is a testament to the caliber of 
person you are. 
Congratulations, and here is to many 
more years on the air.

HAPPY 100TH BIRTHDAY 
JOSEPHINE BIZZARRO 
(Mr. OBERNOLTE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. OBERNOLTE. Mr. Speaker, I am 
honored to rise this afternoon in cele-
bration of the 100th birthday of a mem-
ber of my district. Josephine Bizzarro, 
a resident of the High Desert, turns 100. 
She is preceded in death by her hus-
band, Mr. Domenick Bizzarro. They are 
both members of the Greatest Genera-
tion. 
The Nazis held Domenick Bizzarro as 
a prisoner of war in Germany, during 
World War II where he earned a Bronze 
Star and three Purple Hearts. 
His wife, Josephine, was the consum-
mate military spouse whose unwaver-
ing commitment to her husband is 
what saw him through those dark days 
in World War II. 
Mr. Speaker, everyone that knows 
her celebrates her life as the epitome 
of what a life well lived should be, and 
Heather and I join them in wishing Jo-
sephine Bizzarro a very happy 100th 
birthday. 
f 
RISING ENERGY COSTS 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, one in 
four Americans can’t afford to have 
their basic needs met now due to high 
energy costs. 
Instead of prioritizing policies that 
will knock down costs and provide fi-
nancial relief to the American people, 
House Democrats are doubling down on 
their woke environmental policies in 
this week’s spending package. 
Far-left spending priorities include a 
20 percent increase for the EPA. This 
comes right after the Supreme Court 
ruled that the agency is to roll back 
their overreaching, self-endowed au-
thority. 
Also in the package, is taking away 
the status of biomass from our forests 
that are on fire all the time—especially 
this time of year. The biomass would 
be 
a 
renewable 
resource 
to 
help 
produce electricity, et cetera. They 
want to take that away. So let the for-
est burn. 
It also further restricts offshore oil 
and gas activities while increasing oil 
and gas inspection fees at the same 
time that President Biden is over there 
begging the Saudis to send more im-
ported oil to us. 
How is this going to help? 
Instead, the Biden administration 
must end the Federal freeze on oil and 
gas leases, fast-track pending LNG ex-
port permits, and expedite approval of 
all pipeline and energy development. 
This will help regular American peo-
ple with their high costs of doing busi-
ness and raising their families.

HONORING PATRICK JONES 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in honor of a good 
friend and a remarkable Georgian, Pat-
rick Jones. 
Patrick graduated from the Univer-
sity of Georgia in 1987 with a bachelor’s 
degree in risk management. A loving 
father and devoted husband, he and his 
wife, Kara, have two children and re-
side in Blackshear, Georgia, in my 
First Congressional District. 
Patrick spent over three decades of 
his career working at Flash Foods 
alongside his brother. Under their lead-
ership, it became one of the largest 
convenience chains in the Southeast. It 
was one of the first convenience chains 
to establish a loyalty program, a pro-
prietary retail pricing platform, and a 
robust item-level inventory manage-
ment system. 
In 2016, Flash Foods was acquired by

IOWA’S COUNTY FAIR SEASON 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
in Iowa, the official start of summer 
also brings the official start of county 
fair season. 
All 99 counties in Iowa have a county 
fair that brings together kids, families, 
4H, FFA, farmers, and the broader 
community for their games, fair food, 
arts and crafts, the showing of live-
stock, concerts, tractor pulls, and also 
car races. 
The amount of work young people 
put into raising bottle-to-bucket calf, 
hogs, horses, chickens, rabbits, sheep, 
goats, and even llamas is incredible. 
They take great pride in showing their 
animals at the fair, and they develop 
tremendous confidence. 
There are also static exhibits, which 
are arts and crafts. At one of the coun-
ty fairs, I met Wesley, who was going 
into the first grade, and he showed his 
pencil drawings, photographs, cupcakes 
that he baked, and also his corn for 
that group. He won 10 blue ribbons at 
the age of 6. 
The fair is such a great opportunity 
for families to get together and young 
people to develop the confidence they 
need to succeed in life. It is a wonder-
ful summer educational opportunity 
packed with hands-on learning in a 
fun-filled week. 
I encourage everyone to visit a coun-
ty fair in their own State, and I ap-
plaud all of our children’s dedication, 
compassion, and work ethic.

July 18, 2022 
SEC. 2. ACCESS ROAD FOR DESERT SAGE YOUTH 
WELLNESS CENTER. 
(a) ACQUISITION OF LAND.— 
(1) 
AUTHORIZATION.—The 
Secretary 
of 
Health and Human Services, acting through 
the Director of the Indian Health Service, is 
authorized to acquire, from willing sellers, 
the land in Hemet, California, upon which is 
located a dirt road known as ‘‘Best Road’’, 
beginning at the driveway of the Desert Sage 
Youth Wellness Center at Faure Road and 
extending to the junction of Best Road and 
Sage Road. 
(2) COMPENSATION.—The Secretary shall 
pay fair market value for the land author-
ized to be acquired under paragraph (1). Fair 
market value shall be determined— 
(A) using Uniform Appraisal Standards for 
Federal Land Acquisitions; and 
(B) by an appraiser acceptable to the Sec-
retary and the owners of the land to be ac-
quired. 
(3) ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.—In addition to the 
land referred to in paragraph (1), the Sec-
retary is authorized to acquire, from willing 
sellers, land or interests in land as reason-
ably necessary to construct and maintain 
the road as required by subsection (b). 
(b) CONSTRUCTION
AND
MAINTENANCE
OF 
ROAD.— 
(1) CONSTRUCTION.—After the Secretary ac-
quires the land pursuant to subsection (a), 
the Secretary shall construct on that land a 
paved road that is generally located over 
Best Road to facilitate access to the Desert 
Sage Youth Wellness Center in Hemet, Cali-
fornia. 
(2) MAINTENANCE.—The Secretary shall— 
(A) maintain and manage the road con-
structed pursuant to paragraph (1); or 
(B) enter into an agreement with Riverside 
County, California, to own, maintain and 
manage the road constructed pursuant to 
paragraph (1). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 144 authorizes the In-
dian Health Service, or IHS, to pur-
chase land in Hemet, California, for the 
purpose of constructing a paved road 
that facilitates access to the Desert 
Sage Youth Wellness Center. IHS will 
then maintain the road or enter into 
an agreement with Riverside County, 
California, to maintain the road. 
This critical legislation will expand 
healthcare access to American Indian 
and Alaska Native youth in California 
by ensuring that the Desert Sage 
Youth Wellness Center can be reached 
by safe roadways. 
Prior to 2016, indigenous youth in 
California experiencing substance use 
disorders were forced to travel to out- 
of-State facilities in order to receive 
care. Recognizing this added barrier to 
quality care, IHS built the Desert Sage 
Wellness Center in Hemet, California. 
The center is notable for providing cul-
turally sensitive treatment to indige-
nous youth battling substance use dis-
orders and can hold up to 32 patients at 
a time. 
Unfortunately, during the center’s 
construction, IHS was unable to reach 
an agreement with adjacent property 
holders on the pavement and mainte-
nance of an access road to the facility. 
As a result, the center is currently ac-
cessible only by a dirt road that is 
often washed out from heavy rainfall 
or in a general state of disrepair. 
The center remains the sole IHS 
youth regional treatment facility in 
the State, and it is a much-needed re-
source to California’s American Indian 
and Alaska Native communities. How-
ever, the center’s physical inacces-
sibility poses yet another obstacle to 
indigenous youth seeking care. 
This bill will solve the issue by 
granting IHS the authority to acquire 
the necessary nearby land in order to 
build an operational access road to the 
center. 
I thank Senator FEINSTEIN for mov-
ing this important bill through the 
Senate, as well as our colleague, Rep-
resentative 
RAUL
RUIZ, 
for 
cham-
pioning the House version of the bill. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge swift adoption of 
S. 144, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, S. 144 would authorize 
the Secretary of Health and Human 
Services, acting through the Director 
of the Indian Health Service, to pur-
chase land from willing sellers at fair 
market value to facilitate access to the 
Desert Sage Youth Wellness Center in 
Hemet, California. 
In March 2017, IHS opened Califor-
nia’s first youth regional treatment 
center in Hemet, California. The Desert 
Sage Youth Wellness Center was de-
signed as a coed inpatient facility to 
serve Native youth aged 12 to 17 with 
substance abuse and co-occurring dis-
orders. 
The facility is located approximately 
a half mile from a paved county road. 
According to the IHS, a half-mile ac-
cess road was granted under an ease-
ment from two landowners at the time 
construction began on the facility. Un-
fortunately, the IHS was unable to 
come to a purchase agreement with the 
landowners by the time the construc-
tion was completed. 
To secure access to the facility, the 
IHS is requesting purchasing authority 
since authorities previously granted 
have since expired for this facility. 
It is my understanding that this road 
has historically been dirt and gravel, 
and it can be washed out in heavy 
rains, thus affecting access to the facil-
ity. 
Once the title to the access road is 
acquired, the IHS can make improve-
ments, specifically to pave the road, 
which will provide better and safer ac-
cess to the Desert Sage facility for 
staff, Native youth seeking care, and 
visitors. 
After the necessary improvements 
are made, S. 144 provides that the IHS 
can continue to own and maintain the 
road, or it can enter into an agreement 
with Riverside County, California, for 
the county to own, maintain, and man-
age the road. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 144. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 1286, the Southern Campaign of 
the Revolution National Heritage Cor-
ridor Act, introduced by our esteemed 
colleague, Majority Whip CLYBURN. 
H.R. 1286 would establish in the 
States of North Carolina and South 
Carolina the Southern Campaign of the 
Revolution national heritage corridor. 
The Revolution national heritage 
corridor is an 8-mile-wide area filled 
with an abundance of the Carolinas’ 
Revolutionary War sites and historic 
resources, including battlefields, his-
toric communities, farmsteads, and 
landscapes. These Revolutionary War 
sites are critical to the preservation of 
the Carolinas’ history, as they reflect 
the cultural and natural environments 
of North Carolina and South Carolina 
in the late 18th century. 
The protection, conservation, and 
restoration of these sites ensure that 
the story of these sites is preserved so 
that residents of and visitors to the 
corridor can have the opportunity to 
learn from and understand its rich his-
tory. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, 
Representative 
CLYBURN, 
for 
intro-
ducing this important legislation and 
championing this bill on behalf of my 
constituents. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on H.R. 1286, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
1286, a bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Congressman JAMES CLYBURN of South 
Carolina, which would establish the 
Southern Campaign of the Revolution 
national heritage corridor. 
The corridor established by this leg-
islation would connect the greatest 
concentration of the Carolinas’ Revolu-
tionary War sites, including battle-
fields, 
historic 
communities, 
farmsteads, and landscapes. 
A study was conducted regarding the 
suitability and feasibility of desig-
nating the Southern Campaign of the 
Revolution national heritage corridor, 
and the National Park Service deter-
mined that the study area met each of 
the criteria for designation as a herit-
age corridor. 
The Southern Campaign of the Revo-
lution national heritage corridor will 
serve to educate the public about our 
national identity and the ideals of lib-
erty, natural and civil rights, equality, 
and responsible citizenship. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
such time as he may consume to the 
gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. 
CLYBURN). 
Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding me the 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on 
this august body to vote in favor of 
H.R. 1286, the Southern Campaign of 
the Revolution National Heritage Cor-
ridor Act. 
The 
American 
victory 
at 
Kings 
Mountain in South Carolina was once 
described by a British commander as 
‘‘the first link in a chain of evils that 
. . . ended in the total loss of Amer-
ica.’’ 
When we hear the story of the Amer-
ican Revolution, we don’t often learn 
of the war’s Southern Campaign or ap-
plaud the dramatic impact that cam-
paign had on the Revolution. Signifi-
cant American victories in the Caro-
linas between 1775 and 1783, such as at 
Kings 
Mountain 
and 
the 
Guilford 
Courthouse, paved the way for Amer-
ica’s final victory in the War for Inde-
pendence. 
Today, there are historical land-
marks and battlefields that mark this 
rich history throughout the Carolinas. 
This legislation seeks to connect these 
sites to tell this under-recognized story 
and acknowledge the enduring signifi-
cance of the Southern Campaign on our 
Nation’s history by establishing this 
heritage corridor. 
As a former teacher and lifelong stu-
dent of history, it is a personal mission 
of mine to increase public awareness of 
and appreciation for our Nation’s tre-
mendous natural, historical, scenic, 
and cultural resources. It is my hope 
that the creation of this Southern 
Campaign of the American Revolution 
national heritage corridor will attract 
visitors to learn more about both Caro-
linas’ contributions to this country 
and further fulfill South Carolina’s 
lesser-known motto: Prepared in Mind 
and Resources. 
I thank former Congressman John 
Spratt, who spearheaded this effort and 
secured a feasibility study for this her-
itage corridor back in 2006. I also sa-
lute and commemorate Jayne Scar-
borough, the late executive director of 
the Olde English District Tourism 
Commission, who was a tireless advo-
cate for this project. I am proud to con-
tinue their great work and to be joined 
by the entire South Carolina delega-
tion as we finally bring this legislation 
to the House floor for a vote. 
I commend the South Carolina Bat-
tlefield Preservation Trust for their 
help in informing this process and the 
University of South Carolina for its 
commitment to managing this heritage 
corridor. 
Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask my 
colleagues to vote in favor of this bill. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this 
important legislation, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1286, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2024, the Southern Maryland National 
Heritage Area Act, introduced by our 
esteemed colleague, Majority Leader 
HOYER. 
This bill directs the Secretary of the 
Interior to establish the Southern 
Maryland National Heritage Area to 
preserve, protect, and restore the area 
along with the local coordinating enti-
ty. 
The heritage area would include por-
tions of St. Mary’s, Calvert, Charles, 
and Prince George’s counties in Mary-
land, with the specific boundaries to be 
established by the Department of the 
Interior. 
A management plan would be pro-
posed from the Tri-City Council, which 
is also serving as the local coordi-
nating entity. This management plan 
would come no later than 3 years after 
which the funds are made available to 
carry out this act. An inventory will 
also be taken because of the signifi-
cance of the property. 
Establishing this Southern Maryland 
National Heritage Area ensures that 
the land is maintained, preserved, and 
protected so all Americans will be able 
to use this space, as well as to learn 
and understand its rich history. 
I, again, congratulate Majority Lead-
er HOYER for championing this bill on 
behalf of his constituents, and I urge 
everyone to support the bill today. 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
2024, sponsored by Majority Leader 
STENY HOYER, which would establish 
the Southern Maryland National Herit-
age Area. 
Southern Maryland is notable for 
being the home of the first English col-
ony to pass a law granting freedom of 
religion, which later led to the protec-
tion of religious freedom in the First 
Amendment. 
The area also serves as home to sev-
eral national historic and scenic trails, 
sites related to several American wars, 
and Project Mercury, the first human 
spaceflight program. 
I urge adoption of this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have 
no further requests for time and I am 
prepared to close, so I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
an ‘‘aye’’ vote on this legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2024, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

SEC. 9. TERMINATION OF AUTHORITY. 
The authority of the Secretary to provide as-
sistance under this Act terminates on the date 
that is 15 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days to revise and ex-
tend their remarks and include extra-
neous material on the measure under 
consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 3222, the Alabama Black Belt 
National Heritage Area Act. 
This bill would establish the Ala-
bama Black Belt National Heritage 
Area, consisting of land in 19 counties 
in the State of Alabama, including 
Montgomery County, as a national her-
itage area. 
The region’s identity is rooted in its 
cultural geography and historical de-
velopment. During the mid-1900s, Ala-
bama’s Black Belt area gave rise to the 
civil rights movement emerging in the 
South. 
Montgomery County witnessed the 
bus boycotts in the 1950s. Dallas, 
Lowndes, and Montgomery Counties 
also gave way for the famous march for 
equal rights from Selma to Mont-
gomery in 1965, led by the Reverend 
Martin Luther King, Jr. 
National heritage areas leverage pri-
vate funding for long-term projects 
that have substantial economic and en-
vironmental benefits. The protection, 
conservation, and restoration of Ala-
bama’s Black Belt area, in partnership 
with the National Park Service, will 
ensure that the powerful history of this 
area is preserved for posterity. These 
are stories that need to be told. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
SEWELL, for introducing this important 
legislation and championing this bill 
on behalf of her constituents. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 3222, and I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
3222, a bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Representative SEWELL of Alabama. 
This bill establishes the Alabama 
Black Belt National Heritage Area, 
comprised of land in 19 Alabama coun-
ties, and designates the Center for the 
Study of the Black Belt at the Univer-
sity of West Alabama as the manage-
ment entity. 
The Black Belt region of Alabama 
stretches across the lower central por-
tion of Alabama, from the eastern bor-
der of Mississippi to the western border 
of southern Georgia. The region is rec-
ognized by many as the center of the 
civil rights movement of the 1950s and 
1960s. 
Several pivotal events in the civil 
rights movement took place in the re-
gion, including the Montgomery bus 
boycott and the march from Selma to 
Montgomery, which helped lead to the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting 
Rights Act of 1965. 
The Black Belt region is a special 
area of our country that deserves na-
tional recognition. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I too, 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
this legislation, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3222, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

KISSIMMEE RIVER WILD AND 
SCENIC RIVER ACT 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 4404) to amend the Wild and Sce-
nic Rivers Act to designate segments of 
the Kissimmee River in the State of 
Florida as a component of the Wild and 
Scenic Rivers System, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 4404 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Kissimmee River 
Wild and Scenic River Act’’. 
SEC. 2. DESIGNATION FOR STUDY OF WILD AND 
SCENIC 
RIVER 
SEGMENTS, 
KIS-
SIMMEE RIVER, FLORIDA. 
Section 5(a) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1276(a)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(ll) KISSIMMEE RIVER, FLORIDA.—The re-
stored segment of the Kissimmee River, begin-
ning approximately 16 miles downstream of 
Lake Kissimmee and ending approximately 15 
miles upstream of Lake Okeechobee.’’. 
SEC. 3. STUDIES AND REPORTS. 
Section 5(b) of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act 
(16 U.S.C. 1276(b)) is amended by adding at the 
end the following: 
‘‘(ll) KISSIMMEE RIVER, FLORIDA.—Not later 
than 3 years after the date on which funds are 
made available to carry out this paragraph, the 
Secretary of the Interior shall— 
‘‘(A) complete the study of the Kissimmee 
River, Florida named in paragraph (l) of sub-
section (a); and 
‘‘(B) submit to the Committee on Natural Re-
sources of the House of Representatives and the 
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of 
the Senate a report that describes the results of 
the study.’’. 
SEC. 4. EFFECT ON MANAGEMENT. 
This Act and the amendments made by this 
Act shall not interfere with the current manage-
ment of the area of the Kissimmee River de-
scribed in section 5(a)(l) of the Wild and Scenic 
Rivers Act, nor shall the fact that such area is 
listed for study under the Wild and Scenic Riv-
ers Act (16 U.S.C. 1271 et seq.) be used as jus-
tification for more restrictive management until 
Congress acts on the study recommendations.

California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 4404, the Kissimmee River Wild 
and Scenic River Act to direct the Sec-
retary of the Interior to amend the 
Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and des-
ignate segments of the Kissimmee 
River as a component of the National 
Wild and Scenic Rivers System. 
After efforts in the 1940s to control 
the Kissimmee River’s flow led to 
issues that destroyed habitats, Con-
gress directed the Army Corps of Engi-
neers to restore the river back to its 
original path in the 1990s. 
The completion of this project has al-
ready contributed to the return of 
many wildlife species and a healthier 
ecosystem. 
This bill will ensure that the restored 
segments of the river are preserved for 
future generations to enjoy, by adding 
them to the National Wild and Scenic 
Rivers System. 
Congress created the National Wild 
and Scenic Rivers System in 1968 to 
preserve 
certain 
rivers 
with 
out-
standing natural, cultural, and rec-
reational values in a free-flowing con-
dition for the enjoyment of present and 
future generations. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
SOTO, for introducing this important 
legislation and championing it on be-
half of his constituents. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
4404, a bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Representative DARREN SOTO of Flor-
ida. 
The Kissimmee River stretches more 
than 100 miles in Central Florida and 
serves as both the headwaters for the 
Everglades and the main drainage 
route for the expansive Kissimmee 
River Basin. 
H.R. 4404, as amended, would author-
ize a Wild and Scenic River study to be 
completed by the Secretary of the Inte-
rior. The study will confirm whether 
the river meets the high standards set 
forth in the Wild and Scenic River Act. 
I appreciate the majority supporting 
an amendment at markup to protect 
private property rights by clarifying 
that this study cannot be used as a jus-
tification for new restrictive manage-
ment practices prior to Congress acting 
to officially designate the river as wild 
and scenic. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I too, 
urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time.

question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6695 
July 18, 2022 
for long-distance biking on Federal 
land. 
The legislation would expand outdoor 
recreation 
opportunities 
throughout 
the country and boost local economies 
that rely on tourism and the outdoor 
industry. 
Additionally, 
ensuring 
Americans 
have access to public lands is critical 
to the development of multiple-use 
management, which includes outdoor 
recreation, resource development, and 
grazing. This bill identifies long-dis-
tance bike trails on Federal lands, 
making them easier for the public to 
explore and use for personal enjoy-
ment. 
I thank my colleague, Representative 
NEGUSE, for introducing this important 
legislation and championing it on be-
half of his constituents. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES, 
Washington, DC, July 15, 2022. 
Hon. DAVID SCOTT, 
Chair, Committee on Agriculture, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIR SCOTT: I write to you con-
cerning H.R. 6337 the ‘‘Biking on Long-Dis-
tance Trails Act.’’ 
I appreciate your willingness to work coop-
eratively on this legislation. I recognize that 
the bill contains provisions that fall within 
the jurisdiction of the Committee on Agri-
culture. I acknowledge that your Committee 
will not formally consider H.R. 6337 and 
agree that the inaction of your Committee 
with respect to the bill does not waive any 
future jurisdictional claim over the matters 
contained in the bill that fall within your 
Committee’s Rule X jurisdiction. 
Additionally, the Committee on Natural 
Resources 
confirms 
our 
mutual 
under-
standing that the Committee on Agriculture 
will be appropriately consulted and involved 
as the bill or similar legislation moves for-
ward so that you may address any remaining 
issues within your jurisdiction. I am pleased 
to support the appointment of members of 
the Committee on Agriculture to any con-
ference committee to consider such provi-
sions. 
I will ensure that our exchange of letters is 
included in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD dur-
ing floor consideration of the bill. I appre-
ciate your cooperation regarding this legis-
lation and look forward to continuing to 
work with you as this measure moves 
through the legislative process. 
Sincerely, 
RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chair, House Natural Resources Committee. 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, 
Washington, DC, July 15, 2022. 
Hon. RAU´ L M. GRIJALVA, 
Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources, 
House of Representatives, Washington, DC. 
DEAR CHAIRMAN GRIJALVA: This letter con-
firms our mutual understanding regarding 
H.R. 6337, the Biking on Long-Distance 
Trails Act. Thank you for collaborating with 
the Committee on Agriculture. 
Our Committee will forgo consideration of 
this bill so that it can proceed expeditiously 
to the House floor. However, the Committee 
on Agriculture reserves the right to seek the 
appointment of conferees to any House-Sen-
ate conference and requests consultation on 
any remaining matters within our jurisdic-
tion. 
We would appreciate a response to this let-
ter confirming this understanding with re-
spect to H.R. 6337, and request that a copy of 
our letters on this matter be published in the 
CONGRESSIONAL RECORD during Floor consid-
eration. 
Sincerely, 
DAVID SCOTT, 
Chairman. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
6337, a bipartisan bill sponsored by 
Representative JOE NEGUSE. 
The Biking on Long-Distance Trails, 
or BOLT Act, is intended to meet the 
needs of biking enthusiasts by increas-
ing the number of long-distance biking 
trails on Federal lands. 
The BOLT Act would require the Sec-
retaries of the Interior and Agriculture 
to identify at least 10 existing long-dis-
tance bike trails and identify at least 
10 areas where there is opportunity to 
develop or complete such trails. 
Mountain biking is one of the fastest 
growing sectors in the outdoor recre-
ation economy, and I support identi-
fying new opportunities for the public 
to recreate on Federal lands. The 
BOLT Act will make long-distance 
bike trails safer and more accessible to 
riders throughout the country. 
I urge adoption of this bill, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
b 1500 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill and yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion and yield back the balance of my 
time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6337, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are 
postponed. 
f 
GATEWAY SOLIDARITY ACT 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 7002) to authorize the Gateway 
Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, to be illu-
minated by blue and yellow lights in 
support of Ukraine, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 7002 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Gateway Soli-
darity Act’’. 
SEC. 2. ILLUMINATION OF THE GATEWAY ARCH IN 
SUPPORT OF UKRAINE. 
To show support and solidarity with the 
Ukrainian people, the Secretary of the Interior 
shall illuminate the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, 
Missouri, by blue and yellow lights— 
(A) in 2022, within 15 days following enact-
ment of this act, for no fewer than 5 consecutive 
days; and 
(B) annually on August 24, in recognition of 
Ukrainian Independence Day, until the Presi-
dent reports to Congress that the government of 
the Russian Federation has ceased its desta-
bilizing activities with respect to the sovereignty 
and territorial integrity of Ukraine. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7002, the Gateway Solidarity Act, to il-
luminate the St. Louis Gateway Arch 
in the colors of the Ukrainian flag. 
As we know, Russian president Vladi-
mir Putin launched an unprovoked in-
vasion of Ukraine, and since then, the 
country and its people have experi-
enced the largest armed conflict in Eu-
rope since World War II—a conflict 
consisting of Russian attacks that 
have leveled Ukrainian cities, caused 
civilian casualties, and sparked an 
enormous refugee crisis. 
Introduced by my colleague across 
the aisle, Representative ANN WAGNER, 
this bill would require the Secretary of 
the Interior to illuminate the Gateway 
Arch in the colors of the Ukrainian 
flag to show that we, in the United 
States, are behind Ukraine, sending a 
message to our friends and allies in Eu-
rope and across the globe that the 
American people are supportive of a 
sovereign Ukrainian nation. 
I ask my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
H.R. 7002 and reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7002, sponsored by 
my Republican colleague, ANN WAGNER 
of Missouri, would authorize the Sec-
retary of the Interior to illuminate the 
Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, 
in blue and yellow, the colors of the 
Ukrainian flag. 
Throughout the world, international 
landmarks have been illuminated in 
blue and yellow as a sign of solidarity 
with the people of Ukraine. 
These landmarks include the Ken-
nedy Center, Niagara Falls, the Sydney 
Opera House, the Empire State Build-
ing, the Seattle Space Needle, and the 
Eiffel Tower.

July 18, 2022 
In 2004, Congress enacted legislation 
requiring the Secretary of Interior to 
illuminate the Gateway Arch with pink 
lights 
in 
honor 
of 
Breast 
Cancer 
Awareness Month each October. 
In 2015, the Gateway Arch was illumi-
nated gold to commemorate its 50th 
anniversary. Most recently, in 2020, the 
Gateway Arch was illuminated purple 
and gold to commemorate the 100th an-
niversary of the 19th Amendment. 
The 
Gateway 
Solidarity 
Act, 
as 
amended, would require the Secretary 
of the Interior to illuminate the Gate-
way Arch in St. Louis, Missouri, in 
blue and yellow lights for 5 days fol-
lowing enactment, and annually on Au-
gust 24th, in recognition of Ukrainian 
Independence Day, until the President 
reports to Congress that Russia has 
ceased its hostilities against Ukraine. 
I thank Representative WAGNER for 
sponsoring this bill. The bill’s sponsor 
regrets that she was unable to be here 
today due to weather delays. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this 
bill and yield back the balance of my 
time.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7025 is a bipartisan 
bill led by the chair and the ranking 
member of the Natural Resources Com-
mittee. It will significantly improve 
the 
management 
and 
oversight 
of 
international conservation programs at 
the Department of the Interior. 
Over the past couple of years, our 
committee conducted a bipartisan in-
vestigation into the role of the World-
wide Wildlife Fund, or WWF, and the 
Department of the Interior, DOI, re-
garding allegations of human rights 
abuses at conservation parks around 
the world. 
The reports are deeply upsetting, de-
scribing decades of abuse toward indig-
enous and local people in the name of 
conservation. 
The committee’s oversight hearing in 
October 
revealed 
numerous 
short-
comings in how WWF carries out its 
work and how DOI oversees grant fund-
ing in challenging locations. 
These 
allegations 
aren’t 
unique. 
Leading voices at the U.N. and else-
where have, for years, warned of grave 
abuses in the name of conservation, in 
large part due to the colonial-based 
‘‘fortress conservation model’’ that 
kicked indigenous and local people off 
their lands to set up protected areas. 
International 
conservation 
efforts 
are critical to the success of our na-
tional security, international develop-
ment, climate, and biodiversity goals. 
However, when investing in these 
goals, we must ensure commonsense 
safeguards are in place that protect 
human rights. This bill does that. 
First, it expands human rights vet-
ting to international Fish and Wildlife 
Service-funded conservation projects. 
It prohibits Fish and Wildlife Service 
funds from going to armed groups that 
commit gross violations of human 
rights. 
Second, the bill establishes a thor-
ough, fair, and transparent process for 
investigating credible allegations of 
human rights abuses. 
Third, this legislation weaves the 
highest human rights standards into 
grant contracts. 
This bill is common sense, it is good 
government, and it will make inter-
national conservation more successful, 
benefiting local and indigenous com-
munity members and the planet. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on this legislation and reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7025, the Advancing Human Rights- 
Centered International Conservation 
Act of 2022. 
This bill is the result of a bipartisan 
investigation on how the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service’s international grant 
program helped fund human rights 
atrocities 
committed 
by 
eco-para-
military forces in Africa and else-
where. 
The bipartisan investigation led to 
an oversight hearing at the Committee 
on Natural Resources last year, where 
we heard from expert witnesses about 
the need for reform in this program. 
The hearing and the findings of our in-
vestigation ultimately led to this bill. 
The fundamental concepts of this bill 
are agency accountability and trans-
parency. This bill would specifically re-
quire the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Serv-
ice to vet the human rights record of 
conservation groups and their sub-
grantees prior to awarding the grant. 
The inclusion of subgrantees is crit-
ical. Unfortunately, we have seen some 
conservation groups avoid taking re-
sponsibility for the actions of their 
subgrantees. 
Experts, such as Wake Forest Univer-
sity International Law Professor John 
Knox, who has extensive knowledge on 
this issue, recommended this reform. 
Mr. Knox and other witnesses and ex-
perts have been instrumental in help-
ing the committee throughout the leg-
islative process. 
The experts and bipartisan members 
of the committee agree that the Fed-
eral Government has a responsibility 
to ensure that American taxpayer dol-
lars are not being spent to perpetuate 
human rights abuses. This bill requires 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to 
live up to that responsibility. 
This legislation is a much-needed and 
significant change from the status quo. 
This is a matter where both sides of 
the aisle have come together to ensure 
our conservation efforts do not occur 
at the cost of human lives. 
I thank Ranking Member WESTERMAN 
and Chairman GRIJALVA
and their 
staffs for their hard work and coopera-
tion on this bill. I urge adoption of this 
bill and reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman from New Mexico for 
mentioning Professor Knox. He was an 
outstanding witness in our hearings on 
this subject. 
The truth is, the product of 3 years of 
work that is before us today was a real-
ly good exercise in bipartisan leader-
ship, so I appreciate that. 
I have no further requests for time 
and am prepared to close, so I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge 
adoption of this bill, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote on this legislation and yield 
back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
HUFFMAN) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7025, as 
amended. 
The question was taken.

SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS 
FOR THE NATIONAL PARK FOUNDA-
TION. 
Section 101122(a) of title 54, United States 
Code, is amended— 
(1) by striking ‘‘$5,000,000’’ and inserting 
‘‘$15,000,000’’; and 
(2) by striking ‘‘2023’’ and inserting ‘‘2030’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. HUFFMAN) and the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
New 
Mexico 
(Ms. 
HERRELL) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 7693, the National Park Founda-
tion Reauthorization Act of 2022. 
This bill will ensure that the con-
gressionally 
charted 
philanthropic 
partner of the National Park Service 
can continue supporting our parks for 
years to come. 
Specifically, this bill will reauthorize 
Federal funding for the National Park 
Foundation through 2030 and increase 
the overall annual authorization level 
from $5 million to $15 million. 
This is a smart and commonsense in-
vestment in the future of our national 
parks. Every Federal dollar requires a 
minimum 1-to-1 match with private 
dollars, creating a multiplying effect 
that reaches units throughout the en-
tire system. 
After more than 100 incredible years, 
our national parks are more popular 
than ever. This means they need our 
support to ensure that the National 
Park Service can address challenges 
that include aging infrastructure, over-
crowding, 
and 
inconsistent 
funding 
from Congress. 
The National Park Foundation is a 
key partner and ally. Innovative part-
nerships that leverage Federal invest-
ments and private donations help our 
parks thrive. I am proud to support 
this bill today so that the foundation 
can keep serving this important role. 
Later this week, we will consider the 
Interior 
Appropriations 
legislation, 
which includes vital funding for the 
National Park Service. 
I thank my colleagues on the Appro-
priations Committee for developing a 
bill that includes a robust investment 
in our national parks, and I hope that 
Congress can keep making sound in-
vestments that ensure the National 
Park 
Service 
continues 
to 
thrive 
throughout its second century and be-
yond. 
I thank our colleague, Ranking Mem-
ber WESTERMAN, for introducing this 
important legislation. Mr. Speaker, I 
urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes,’’ and 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. HERRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 
7693, the National Park Foundation Re-
authorization Act of 2022. This bipar-
tisan bill has the support of 51 cospon-
sors. This bill will leverage private in-
vestment and innovative public-private 
partnerships to reduce the $21.8 billion 
deferred maintenance backlog at our 
national parks, and address pressing 
issues like park overcrowding. 
Very importantly, the foundation is 
required to provide a dollar-for-dollar 
match with private funds for their Fed-
eral appropriations, and Federal funds 
cannot be used by the National Park 
Foundation for overhead, administra-
tive expenses, or land acquisition. 
In 2016, Congress passed the National 
Park Service Centennial Act, which au-
thorized the National Park Founda-
tion, the official charitable partner of 
the National Park Service, to receive 
up to $5 million in discretionary appro-
priations annually through fiscal year 
2023. 
The foundation utilizes its Federal 
appropriations to work with local part-
ners and leverage private investment 
to achieve the greatest impact pos-
sible. 
The foundation works together with 
the National Park Service to identify 
projects, 
including 
rehabilitating 
trails, visitor centers and other facili-
ties, expanding youth access, and con-
serving park habitat. 
b 1515 
To date, the Foundation has rou-
tinely exceeded the minimum 1-to-1 re-
quired match and has more than $20 
million worth of projects awaiting 
funding in the pipeline. 
Since first receiving an appropriation 
in fiscal year 2018, the Foundation has 
funded more than 100 projects in 32 
States and two territories. By the end 
of next year, the Foundation plans to 
have funded projects in all 50 States 
and multiple territories. 
This bill builds on the National Park 
Foundation’s success by creating addi-
tional opportunities to encourage even 
more private funding for the parks. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 
7693, and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I urge a 
‘‘yes’’ vote, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr.

for the sovereign decision of Finland 
and Sweden to apply to join the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 1130 
Whereas Finland and Sweden have made a 
historic decision to deepen their security 
ties with the transatlantic community; 
Whereas a more resilient security architec-
ture in Europe advances democracy, human 
rights, and values consistent with the North 
Atlantic Treaty; 
Whereas, on April 4, 1949, Belgium, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxem-
bourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, 
the United Kingdom, and the United States 
formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organiza-
tion, hereinafter referred to as NATO, to 
serve as a defensive alliance based on pro-
moting democratic values and the peaceful 
mediation of disputes; 
Whereas NATO membership is open to 
‘‘any other European state in a position to 
further the principles of this Treaty and to 
contribute to the security of the North At-
lantic area’’; 
Whereas Finland and Sweden are European 
states with strong democratic foundations 
that share the transatlantic community’s 
dedication to the rule of law and the peaceful 
resolution of disputes; 
Whereas Finland and Sweden have been 
members of NATO’s Partnership for Peace 
program since 1994 and have contributed to 
NATO-led operations in the Balkans, Af-
ghanistan, and Iraq; 
Whereas NATO established the Partnership 
Interoperability Initiative at the Wales 
Summit in 2014 to develop military-to-mili-
tary interoperability between select partner 
nations enabling them to contribute to fu-
ture crisis management, including NATO-led 
operations; 
Whereas Finland and Sweden were des-
ignated inaugural Enhanced Opportunities 
Partners at the Wales Summit in 2014; 
Whereas the hard-fought post-World War II 
European security architecture has been up-
ended by the Russian Federation’s cruel full- 
scale invasion of Ukraine which began on 
February 24, 2022; 
Whereas the Russian Federation’s invasion 
has fomented the worst European humani-
tarian crisis since World War II with 4,339 ci-
vilian deaths, 4.8 million Ukrainian refugees 
across Europe, and 7.1 million more inter-
nally displaced within Ukraine, according to 
the United States Agency for International 
Development as of June 10, 2022; 
Whereas Finland and Sweden’s populations 
expressed support for NATO membership;

H6700 
July 18, 2022 
Whereas Finland and Sweden’s highly ca-
pable 
militaries 
are 
interoperable 
with 
NATO forces and would increase and fortify 
NATO’s collective security by increasing the 
security and stability of the Baltic Sea re-
gion and Northern Europe; 
Whereas officials of the Russian Federa-
tion issued threats directed at Finland and 
Sweden prior to their decision to exercise 
their sovereign right to apply for NATO 
membership; 
Whereas despite these threats from the 
Russian Federation, Finland and Sweden’s 
national institutions have reviewed their 
policies of military nonalignment and their 
governments and parliaments have expressed 
support for applying for NATO membership; 
and 
Whereas in the best interests of their re-
spective peoples, the European security ar-
chitecture, the rule of international law, and 
democracy in Europe, Finland and Sweden 
have announced their support for NATO 
membership: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-

(1) expresses support for Finland and Swe-
den’s sovereign and historic decision to 
apply to the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-

(5) recognizes that the accession of Finland

sign and ratify protocols of accession; and 
(6) calls on the member states of NATO to 
formally support the accession of Finland 
and Sweden into NATO.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
1130, as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of Chairman KEATING’s resolution ex-
pressing support for the sovereign deci-
sion of Finland and Sweden to apply 
for the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation, also known as NATO, and call-
ing on all members of NATO to swiftly 
ratify the protocols of accession. 
Since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 
February of this year, the world has 
changed. The world has watched as 
Vladimir Putin ordered his military to 
march through Ukraine, brutally at-
tacking civilians and civilian infra-
structure, 
making 
it 
exceptionally 
clear that his senseless imperial aspi-
rations go far beyond the Donbas and 
even Ukraine in its entirety. As a mat-
ter of fact, he has stated such. 
In response, our transatlantic allies 
and partners have had to completely 
rethink, as is clear, our security pos-
tures, tighten our ranks, and counter 
global challenges. 
In response to the Russian Federa-
tion’s 
unthinkable 
aggression 
in 
Ukraine, Sweden and Finland, both 
long-term security partners of the 
United States and NATO as a whole, 
have made the sovereign decision to 
apply for NATO membership. This did 
not come about easily or automati-
cally. 
Both Chairman KEATING and I believe 
Finland and Sweden’s accession to 
NATO presents a strong, unified mes-
sage against Putin’s aggression in 
Ukraine, and this would support peace 
and the values that we all adhere to in 
the NATO alliance. Finland and Swe-
den’s militaries, already equipped with 
modern technology and weapons, some 
of which have already been delivered to 
Ukraine, are fully interoperable with 
NATO systems, which makes them a 
good fit. 
Additionally, NATO’s land border 
with Russia will now include signifi-
cantly more territory, thereby acting 
as a greater deterrence to Russian 
threats and aggression. Their accession 
will also bolster NATO’s capabilities in 
the Baltic Sea region, building on the 
capabilities of our Baltic partners, as 
well as Poland, who have each been 
steadfast in their commitments to 
countering Russian aggression and re-
sponding to this grave humanitarian 
crisis that is Russia’s responsibility 
and Russia’s responsibility solely on 
their part. 
For this decision, as Finnish Presi-
dent Niinisto has rightly said, when 
Vladimir Putin looks in the mirror, he 
has only himself to blame. Putin’s en-
tire warfighting efforts—the bombings, 
the 
airstrikes, 
the 
ground 
move-
ments—have been counterproductive. 
Instead, Putin and the military of the 
Russian Federation, as I and many oth-
ers have said, have committed war 
crimes, forced Ukrainians from their 
homes into filtration camps and de-
ported them to far-away Russian terri-
tories, and singlehandedly instigated 
the largest humanitarian crisis in Eu-
rope since World War II. 
Despite his goals of dividing the 
transatlantic alliance, Putin has in-
stead united us more resolutely than 
ever before against his attempt to 
spread hate and violence across the 
globe and to create more division. 
Clearly, that has been his goal, and it 
has been his goal for years. In addition, 
individuals from around Europe, most 
notably Central Europe, have wel-
comed 
those 
fleeing 
violence 
in 
Ukraine in their own homes in Poland, 
Romania, and many other European 
countries. It is really an incredible hu-
manitarian effort that these central 
European countries have engaged in, 
and it has been heartening for the en-
tire world to see. 
Bearing the events of the last few 
months in mind, this resolution ex-
presses support for Finland and Swe-
den’s monumental decision to apply for 
NATO membership. Furthermore, this 
resolution echoes the leadership role 
that Congress and this administration 
have taken in uniting the transatlantic 
alliance and the world in support of 
Ukraine. 
This did not happen overnight. Presi-
dent Biden last year began working 
closely with our NATO allies, sharing 
intelligence, working together to build 
on that alliance, including more re-
cently Congress providing over $50 bil-
lion 
in 
support 
for 
Ukraine’s 
warfighting effort and the immense hu-
manitarian crisis that has resulted. 
These funds have been crucial in ensur-
ing that Ukraine can continue their 
fight, and it has provided leadership for 
our other European allies to do the 
same. This is a fight for democracy, a 
fight for freedom, and it is a fight that 
Ukrainians must win. This is the test 
of our time, and President Zelenskyy 
has stood up, reminding all of us that 
the price of freedom is not free, and 
those brave Ukrainian people, how 
much they have done to show the en-
tire world that they stand for their 
sovereignty. 
However, this resolution would not 
have been possible without the bipar-
tisan support of many of my col-
leagues, who have long supported the 
NATO alliance, like Congressman TUR-
NER and so many others. This includes 
the lead on this resolution, Chairman 
KEATING, as well as the lead original 
cosponsors on this resolution, House 
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Eu-
rope, Energy, the Environment, and 
Cyber, 
Ranking 
Member 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK, as well as Representa-
tives ERIC SWALWELL and ANN WAGNER, 
and 
Representatives 
CONNOLLY
and 
TURNER of the NATO Parliamentary 
Assembly. 
In addition, I thank all of the chairs 
of the House Finland and Sweden Cau-
cuses for signing on as original cospon-
sors of this legislation. 
Finally, I also specifically thank 
Chairman MEEKS and Ranking Member 
MCCAUL of the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, who have been united in 
these efforts over the recent months. 
I also express my gratitude to Leader 
HOYER and Chairman MEEKS for allow-
ing this resolution to move to the floor 
so expeditiously. 
Through this resolution, the House 
will loudly and clearly welcome Fin-
land and Sweden into the NATO alli-
ance, a clear sign of transatlantic 
unity in response to Vladimir Putin’s 
brutal ambition. 
I was in Brussels in February, 2 days 
before the invasion, and I have never 
seen NATO as united perhaps since the 
Cold War. 
The fact is that we have a strong his-
tory, and we have the opportunity to 
be bolstered by the strength of their 
military alliance as well as the demo-
cratic resolve of their governments.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6701 
July 18, 2022 
So in the spirit of unity and recogni-
tion of Finland and Sweden as long- 
term friends of the United States, I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
this resolution, and I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I thank Representative COSTA, who I 
am very proud to serve with on the 
board of the NATO Parliamentary As-
sembly. We look forward to recognizing 
and accepting a full delegation to the 
NATO Parliamentary Assembly from 
both Finland and Sweden. 
Vladimir 
Putin 
launched 
his 
unprovoked war of aggression against 
Ukraine and the inhumane assault on 
innocent civilians, thinking that he 
would be able to divide the NATO alli-
ance. He was mistaken. 
Instead, Finland and Sweden re-
sponded by dropping their policies of 
military neutrality and applying for 
NATO membership. 
As NATO Secretary General Jens 
Stoltenberg put it, Vladimir Putin 
wanted less NATO, and now he is get-
ting more NATO on his borders. Fin-
land and Sweden will both be signifi-
cant security providers for NATO. 
This bipartisan resolution supports 
ratifying the accession of Sweden and 
Finland to NATO. 
Having served as the president of the 
NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I un-
derstand the fundamental role this or-
ganization plays in defending democ-
racies and supporting freedom. 
Finland and Sweden’s strategic loca-
tion in northern Europe, advanced 
militaries, and decades of fighting 
alongside the U.S. and NATO mean 
that their accession will immediately 
strengthen transatlantic security. Fin-
land and Sweden have well-trained 
armed forces, sophisticated modern 
weapons systems, and have committed 
to allocating 2 percent of their gross 
domestic product to defense spending. 
Both militaries are highly interoper-
able with NATO forces, having partici-
pated in numerous NATO-led oper-
ations from Afghanistan, Iraq, Bosnia 
and Herzegovina to Kosovo. Meanwhile, 
Finland has finalized its purchase of F– 
35 fighter jets from the U.S. in a $12 
billion deal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join me in supporting this resolution, 
which calls on all members of NATO to 
ratify Sweden and Finland’s protocols 
of accession swiftly. 
Finally, for the alliance to be cred-
ible, every nation must do its fair 
share. The resolution also urges mem-
bers of NATO to meet their 2 percent 
defense 
spending 
pledge. 
President 
Trump successfully pushed our NATO 
allies to spend more on defense. Putin’s 
invasion has been another motivation 
to convince our allies who had not been 
living up to their military commit-
ments to NATO to increase their de-
fense spending and make concrete 
plans to reach the 2 percent require-
ment. 
A strong, united NATO is in the 
United States’ interest. With Sweden 
and Finland as members, the balance of 
power in Europe will be tipped against 
Putin. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this resolu-
tion, and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
b 1530 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the distinguished 
majority leader of the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
my friend, Mr. COSTA, for yielding this 
time. I thank my friend and the rank-
ing member, Mr. TURNER, for his role 
in bringing this to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, as has been said over 
and over again, Vladimir Putin made a 
terrible 
strategic 
and 
tragic 
mis-
calculation by illegally invading the 
sovereign and democratic nation of 
Ukraine. His false justification for that 
invasion was the supposed threat posed 
by NATO expansion. His other false 
claim was that Russian Ukrainians 
were being terrorized and threatened. 
Neither of those allegations was true. 
Now, his actions have led directly, as 
Mr. TURNER just pointed out, and as 
Mr. COSTA pointed out, to the opposite 
of what he intended. That is, we are 
going to be adding two extraordinary 
members of the European community, 
two countries that have shared our val-
ues, our democratic values, our nation 
of laws values, and our humanitarian 
values with us for literally over half a 
century. 
Together, Finland and Sweden will 
add substantial capabilities to NATO’s 
collective defense and make the Baltic 
region much more secure against Rus-
sian aggression. But much more than 
that, they will add value, because of 
their values, to our alliance. 
Mr. Speaker, I was in Denmark in 
April, meeting with senior officials. I 
can attest that the addition of Finland 
and Sweden to the NATO family will 
create a Scandinavian bloc—Denmark, 
Norway, Sweden, and Finland—within 
NATO that will be more than the sum 
of its parts, significantly contributing 
to the peace and stability of Europe 
and to the security of all NATO na-
tions, including the United States. 
As I have said before, we must ensure 
that Putin’s invasion will result in a 
strategic defeat for Russia. I pause, Mr. 
Speaker, to emphasize that point. 
Vladimir Putin must not win this war, 
not only for the sake of the Ukrainians 
and their extraordinary bravery, and 
the bravery and the leadership of Mr. 
Zelenskyy, their President, but be-
cause the free world needs to send a 
very strong, clear, and unmistakable 
message that tyranny will not prevail. 
We must send a message to dictators 
around the world that this action is un-
acceptable and will be opposed until 
victory by the free world. 
We must defend the hard-won prin-
ciple in international laws and norms 
that a nation cannot simply invade and 
seek to conquer territory from a neigh-
bor by force. That was accepted for 
centuries, indeed, millennia, but it is 
not acceptable today in a world of nu-
clear weapons, in a world that has a 
United Nations that stands for the 
principle that no nation can by force 
take the land of another nation. 
I thank Representative KEATING for 
his leadership on this resolution. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we can all come 
together, Democrats and Republicans, 
as I think we will, in a resounding, 
unanimous vote to show our support 
not only for Ukraine, which we have 
demonstrated over and over again by 
votes of this House, but also for our 
new NATO allies, the people of Finland 
and Sweden. 
I thank the Prime Minister of Swe-
den, Magdalena Andersson, and the 
Prime Minister of Finland, Sanna 
Marin, for their leadership in taking 
what is in many respects a courageous 
stand. 
The Finns, of course, have a very 
long border with Russia. They believe, 
correctly, in my view, that their secu-
rity is contingent, and that is why they 
are joining NATO. 
As we have reiterated time and time 
again, this House is committed to hon-
oring Article 5 of the NATO Charter. 
Mr. Speaker, this is a good resolution 
that will stand us in good stead as a 
nation and as a global community. 
Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time for clos-
ing. 
I thank Representative KEATING and 
Representative COSTA for their work on 
this resolution. I also thank Majority 
Leader HOYER for his comments in sup-
port of NATO and in support of 
Ukraine. Certainly, the crisis that is 
occurring there is an impetus, I think, 
for our moving quickly and in support 
of this resolution. 
The Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee will consider the accession pro-
tocols for these two countries in the 
next week. This vote is an opportunity 
for the House of Representatives to 
demonstrate their support for Fin-
land’s and Sweden’s NATO member-
ship. This support should be over-
whelming. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
join in supporting this resolution. In 
the face of Vladimir Putin’s aggres-
sion, it is critical that the United 
States Congress speak with one voice 
on strengthening NATO. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time for the pur-
pose of closing. 
I thank Ranking Member TURNER for 
his leadership and for his support of 
our common alliance and our defense 
in these critical and dangerous times 
that we are living in. 
I want to reflect on why I think this 
resolution is so important, and it is an 
inflection 
point 
that 
Chairman 
KEATING and so many of us feel with re-
gard to global history. As I said, this is 
a test of our time as to whether or not

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6702 
July 18, 2022 
democracies will be willing to stand to-
gether for the common values we 
share, for the rule of law, for a rules- 
based economy, and for all the free-
doms we cherish that we share in com-
mon. 
Simply stated, this is a choice about 
good and evil. For the first time in 
eight decades, we have seen a full-scale 
land invasion in Europe instigated, re-
sulting in an unprecedented humani-
tarian crisis. 
Think about this. The alliances that 
we have created post-World War II, be-
ginning with the Marshall Plan and 
then NATO and the European Union, 
and everything that has followed since 
that, have resulted in one of the larg-
est peacetime periods in Europe in over 
1,000 years. Think about that. 
What 
we 
have 
also, 
obviously, 
learned the hard way is that these un-
conscionable crimes committed against 
the Ukrainian people, I think, con-
stitute a form of genocide. 
I said in a speech several months ago 
that, in my view, after Bucha, Presi-
dent Putin should be considered a war 
criminal along with all who have been 
involved in these horrific crimes that 
we have seen committed and see 
daily—hospitals, 
schools, 
apartment 
buildings, innocent children, and citi-
zens being attacked. 
The 
brave 
men 
and 
women 
of 
Ukraine and their leadership, President 
Zelenskyy, have reminded us once 
again that we who share the common 
values of democracies must stand to-
gether. 
We are at the front lines in this fight 
for freedom, and Ukraine today is sadly 
paying the heavy price. But they have 
demonstrated an importance to all of 
us of unity in the face of Putin’s cata-
strophic and violent attack. They have 
demonstrated why our support mat-
ters, and it does. Crucially, they have 
proven that without a doubt, as was 
said by my colleague and friend, Con-
gressman HOYER, democratic values 
will prevail over an authoritarian ide-
ology. That is why we must ensure that 
Putin fails in his war of aggression. 
Finland’s and Sweden’s historic and 
sovereign decisions to apply for NATO 
membership create an echo of trans-
atlantic unity on this issue, and this 
resolution represents strong bipartisan 
support here in Congress for Ukraine. 
I thank my colleagues on the other 
side. Chairman KEATING
leads this 
NATO resolution in response to the al-
liance, 
our 
transatlantic 
alliance, 
which has stood up to the aggression of 
Russia in the face of unprecedented, 
unprovoked aggression, and we have 
come together to do the right thing. 
To my colleagues in the Senate, who 
will be taking up these articles of ac-
cession shortly, I urge you to dem-
onstrate full support for Finland and 
Sweden to join the NATO alliance. 
As to my colleagues in this Chamber, 
I urge your support, as well, for this 
resolution so that the United States 
Government can speak with one voice, 
one voice in the resolute support of our 
Nordic allies and unwavering support 
for Ukraine’s fight for freedom and 
their democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues 
will join me in supporting this bill, and 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
COSTA) that the House suspend the

NORTH CAROLINA IS AMERICA’S 
TOP STATE FOR BUSINESS 
(Ms. MANNING asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to celebrate a recent mile-
stone in my home State of North Caro-
lina. CNBC just recognized North Caro-
lina as America’s Top State for Busi-
ness in 2022. 
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan 
and 
bipartisan 
infrastructure 
law, 
North Carolina’s economy persevered 
through the pandemic and is con-
tinuing to grow rapidly. 
Major companies like Toyota and 
Boom Supersonic Jets are building in-
novative manufacturing operations in 
North Carolina’s Sixth District, prov-
ing that we have what businesses want. 
With a well-equipped workforce, in-
vestments in infrastructure and re-
search, and stellar institutions of high-
er education, it is no surprise that 
North Carolina is garnering national 
recognition for its business-friendly 
climate and strong economy. 
I thank Governor Cooper for his lead-
ership. I will continue to work with our 
elected officials and businesses to en-
sure that North Carolina remains the 
strongest economic State in the coun-
try. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE RUTH M. SMITH 
CENTER 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recog-
nize the Ruth M. Smith Center in Shef-
field, Pennsylvania, for 100 years of 
service to their community. 
The Ruth M. Smith Center has been 
supporting the community of Sheffield 
since 1922 when the Smith family gave 
their home to the Women’s Society of 
Christian Service. Since then, the 
home has served as an orphanage, a 
daycare preschool, and as a personal 
care home for adults with intellectual 
and physical impairments as well as 
older adults. 
The center is a staple of the Sheffield 
community as it continues to provide 
support and assistance to those who 
need care beyond the basic necessities 
of food and shelter. 
As a nonprofit association, the Ruth 
M. Smith Center is able to support 
those who cannot afford the costs of 
care through donations by individuals, 
churches, and State grants. 
Madam Speaker, the Ruth M. Smith 
Center is a testament to the power of 
community groups to uplift those most 
in need of support. It is a privilege to 
congratulate them on their continued 
service to Sheffield, Pennsylvania. 
f 
REPORT FROM ROBB 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SHOOTING 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I hold in my hand the interim report 
2022 Investigative Committee on the 
Robb Elementary School Shooting. 
Tragically, I was there within days of 
the shooting in May. Tragically, I got 
to listen to parents whose children bled 
out. All of us know the story of a little 
girl who smeared blood on herself just 
to have them think she was dead. 
Part of what this report says is at 
Robb Elementary School, law enforce-
ment responders failed to adhere to 
their active shooter training, and they 
failed to prioritize saving the innocent 
victims over their own safety. There 
was no command post, as this report 
says, and there was no point of com-
mand. 
But really I think what is important 
is that we are due for Federal involve-
ment, as I have called. It is time now 
to give answers to our community. And 
let me simply say the words that 
struck me in this executive summary: 
We recognize that the impact of this 
tragedy is felt more profoundly by the 
people of Uvalde in ways we cannot 
fully comprehend. Their children are 
dead, and we have no answers, and 
there are people who failed to save the 
children’s lives. 
I call for a congressional investiga-
tion and hearings so that we can give 
them solutions and not just concerns. 
They need it, because their children’s 
lives are lost.

DEMOCRATS’ FAILED ECONOMIC 
POLICIES

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6704 
July 18, 2022 
economic record for the Biden adminis-
tration: Inflation has hit 9.1 percent. 
Grocery costs are up. Gas prices are up. 
Nearly every essential item for living 
is up. 
The Biden administration’s failed 
economic policies and congressional 
Democrats’ unchecked spending has 
put our economy on the verge of reces-
sion. 
In Kentucky, citizens are paying 
twice as much at the gas pump as they 
did last year. In fact, Kentuckians have 
seen a 50 percent increase in gas pries 
since last year and a diesel increase of 
84 percent, which is detrimental to the 
farming industry. 
Farmers are at their breaking point. 
The USDA recently reported that farm 
expenses are expected to rise by over 
$20 billion next year alone. 
I am hearing from constituents in 
Kentucky’s First District who are 
deeply concerned and rightfully so. 
Farmers are saying it is costing thou-
sands of dollars more per day to keep 
their farm equipment operational due 
to the skyrocketing price of diesel. 
This is unsustainable. 
On top of inflation, it is clear that 
President Biden has made diminishing 
American energy production a top pri-
ority. 
Madam Speaker, Americans are in 
trouble. No matter how hard Demo-
crats try, Congress cannot spend their 
way out of this problem. 
f 
SUPPORTING BIRTH CONTROL 
(Ms. BROWNLEY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. BROWNLEY. Madam Speaker, 
last month, the extreme and radical 
wing of the Republican Party and the 
Supreme Court took a dangerous and 
detrimental strike against women’s re-
productive rights by overturning Roe 
v. Wade and dismantling decades of 
healthcare and privacy protections, 
and they are not stopping there. 
In 
his 
opinion, 
Justice 
Clarence 
Thomas threatened American women 
that the Supreme Court will no longer 
protect the right to birth control. 
Nearly all women in the United 
States use contraceptives at least once 
during their lifetime and an estimated 
65 percent of women use a form of birth 
control every single day. 
This is but another egregious compo-
nent of the radical Republican agenda 
to restrict women’s rights and the fun-
damental right to her bodily auton-
omy. 
This is why I am supporting the 
Right to Contraception Act, and I urge 
all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ to 
protect access to birth control. 
House Democrats will not be deterred 
in the fight for the health, safety, and 
reproductive freedom of women and 
every American. 
b 1915 
BIDEN’S VISIT TO SAUDI ARABIA 
(Mr. ROSE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ROSE. Madam Speaker, this 
weekend, President Biden took a trip 
to Saudi Arabia with the purpose of 
asking Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
Salman to increase oil output. News re-
ports are saying the President might 
have come home empty-handed after 
the Crown Prince informed the Presi-
dent that Saudi Arabia is already close 
to reaching maximum output. 
I don’t understand why the President 
would go through all this hassle when 
we have what it takes to increase oil 
output, lower prices, and reemerge as 
the energy-independent country we 
were under President Trump, right 
here at home. The President could have 
saved time and taxpayer dollars by 
taking a trip to Texas, Louisiana, and 
Oklahoma. 
Unfortunately, as long as the Biden 
administration continues to implement 
more regulations and restrictions on 
investments in the oil and gas indus-
try, we will continue to be at the 
mercy of foreign countries and their 
dictators. 
f 
GATEWAY SOLIDARITY 
(Mrs. WAGNER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, as 
we stand here today, Vladimir Putin 
continues his unconscionable assault 
on the sovereign nation of Ukraine, 
displacing millions of families and kill-
ing thousands of innocent civilians. 
In response to this horrific assault, 
my home State of Missouri has pro-
jected the colors of the Ukrainian flag 
on to our State capitol, as well as both 
landmarks in St. Louis and Kansas 
City. 
My bill here today will illuminate 
the Gateway Arch, the defining struc-
ture of the St. Louis skyline and a 
symbol of pride for the people of St. 
Louis, Missouri. It will also show the 
world that we stand united in soli-
darity with the people of Ukraine. 
Madam Speaker, with the support of 
the entire Missouri delegation, I urge 
my colleagues to pass this legislation. 
f 
A NEW RECORD OF BORDER 
CROSSINGS 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, in 
the midst of all the talking about the 
love affair the Democratic Party has 
for abortion and talking about Ukraine 
and making another vote there, I am 
afraid the press isn’t going to pick up 
on the numbers that have just been re-
leased for border crossings of illegal 
immigrants or people we have not ap-
propriately vetted for June of 2022. 
It is a hot month in Mexico and a hot 
month on the border, so the numbers 
are not as great as the prior month, 
but compared to past Junes, we have 
once again set a record, and nothing is 
being done about it. 
If you look at two Junes ago, June 
2020, a total of about 11,000 people were 
allowed in this country. 
Last June, we shot up from 11,000 to 
79,000, and this year we are at 142,000. 
Madam Speaker, that is 142,000 in one 
month; once again, a record in June of 
the number of people crossing the bor-
der, and all this body can talk about is 
Ukraine and abortion. It is time to 
talk a little bit about the future of the 
country and ask what the Biden admin-
istration is doing to stop this invasion.

Let us pray. 
Eternal God, look down from Heaven

Your presence. Listen to our prayers. 
Lord, our hearts are steadfast toward 
You, so lead our Senators safely to the 
refuge of Your choosing. Thank You for 
giving us a future and a hope. 
Today, give our lawmakers the power 
to do Your will as they fully realize 
they are servants of Heaven and stew-
ards of Your mysteries. Provide them 
the wisdom to make faith the litmus 
test by which they evaluate each ac-
tion as they refuse to deviate from the

from being careless about their spir-
itual and moral growth. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen.

RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The majority leader is recog-
nized. 
CORONAVIRUS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
first, let me thank all of my colleagues 
for their kind words during my time 
isolating due to COVID last week. As 
you can see, I have made a full recov-
ery after experiencing only mild symp-
toms, thank God. COVID has done in-
calculable damage to scores of Amer-
ican families, but because I was fortu-
nate enough to be vaccinated and dou-
ble boosted, my case was not as bad as 
it could have been. 
I urge all Americans who have not 
been vaccinated yet to talk to their 
doctors and get the vaccine, if possible, 
and then get boosted when the time is 
right. Speaking from personal experi-
ence, it makes all the difference in the 
world. 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Now, Madam President, the Senate 
gavels back in for the second week of 
an exceedingly busy work period. There 
is a lot we must do quickly to lower 
costs and improve the lives of Amer-
ican families. 
On the nominations front, we will 
continue confirming as many of Presi-
dent Biden’s qualified judges and ad-
ministrative appointees as possible. 
Last week, the Senate confirmed our 
70th Biden-appointed Federal judge, on 
a voice vote, and this week we intend 
to keep going by confirming Judge 
Michelle Childs, of South Carolina, to 
serve as a circuit judge on the very, 
very important DC Circuit. 
Very soon, the Senate must also take 
swift action to pass the PACT Act for 
a second time in order to correct a 
technical error that arose in the House. 
This legislation will be the most im-
portant healthcare reform bill that our 
veterans have seen in years, and there 
is absolutely no justification—none 
whatsoever—to delay the swift passage 
of this bill. 
And, most importantly, the U.S. Sen-
ate must finish work on one of the 
most 
urgent 
priorities 
facing 
this 
Chamber: addressing the chip shortage 
that is hurting American consumers, 
decimating our supply chains, and en-
dangering our national security. 
For the information of all, tomorrow, 
we are going to hold the first proce-
dural vote on legislation to address 
these critical issues, which both sides 
have been working on for months. As 
we speak, Democrats and Republicans 
are hashing out the final details on a 
bill so we can move forward this week. 
The chip shortage is not some ab-
stract issue; it is impacting the daily

lives of millions of Americans. Cars, re-
frigerators, and other household appli-
ances require chips to function, but 
supply shortages mean prices have 
gone up and up and up for those goods, 
and Americans have to wait months 
just to get a hold of them. If you want 
to help with inflation and get it down, 
this bill is an important bill to vote 
for, and we can take a giant step to-
ward fixing this problem if we act now. 
Last week, the Secretaries of Com-
merce and Defense told us plainly that 
‘‘our economic and national security 
depends on our ability to invest in the 
technologies of today and tomorrow.’’ 
So, again, we need to move quickly. 
Right now, some of the most impor-
tant manufacturers in our country are 
weighing where to make their invest-
ments in semiconductor production. 
Many of them are holding off on final 
decisions to see what Congress does, 
but they are not going to wait around 
forever. 
As one company told the Wall Street 
Journal, ‘‘Without these incentives 
[from Congress], the capital invest-
ment required for [expanding produc-
tion] is not economically viable in the 
United States given other global alter-
natives.’’ 
Other countries have copied our leg-
islation, and they are offering compa-
nies huge amounts of money to locate 
there, and that, of course, will endan-
ger our security—economic and na-
tional. The message is not subtle. If 
countries do not think it is profitable 
to make chips here in America, they 
are going to go somewhere else. 
Countless good-paying American jobs 
are on the line, and billions of dollars 
in economic activity are on the line. As 
I said, our national security is at 
stake. For these reasons, I urge my col-
leagues to move forward tomorrow. 
Of course, as we work on chips legis-
lation this week, I urge my colleagues 
on the conference committee to con-
tinue finalizing the larger jobs and in-
novation package that both sides have 
been working on for months. 
I want to see this Chamber send a 
compromise bill to the President’s 
desk because this is so important for 
the future of our country and for our 
national security. I have worked for 
more than a year with Republicans to 
get a competition and innovation bill 
done, so I strongly support my col-
leagues as they keep working. 
In the meantime, we must take steps 
to get chips done as soon as we can. 
This is about lowering costs, increasing 
manufacturing, and making sure we 
are competitive with our rivals abroad. 
The 21st century will belong to na-
tions willing to invest in the tech-
nologies and innovations of tomorrow. 
I want to get there first, but to do that, 
the Senate must act this week.

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
INFLATION 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
last week, American families’ pain was 
confirmed by yet another round of 
awful statistics. Year-on-year inflation 
set a new 40-year high in June. The 
painful fallout of Washington Demo-
crats’ 2021 spending binge continues to 
spread. A loaf of bread costs the Amer-
ican consumer 10 percent more than it 
did a year ago. A dozen eggs will run 
you 33 percent more. The price of a gal-
lon of gas, of course, rose more than 100 
percent on Democrats’ watch. 
Across the board, the American peo-
ple’s hard-earned dollars are not going 
nearly as far as before Democrats’ in-
flation. Even as nominal wages rise, 
millions of families have seen their 
real income decrease; a net pay cut for 
workers, 
courtesy 
of 
Washington 
Democrats’ runaway spending. No won-
der three out of four Americans—three 
out of four—say inflation is causing 
them financial hardship. Seventy-five 
percent of the country is in a tough 
spot. 
Of course, it is not affecting everyone 
equally. The lowest earning Americans 
consistently spend larger portions of 
their incomes on the sort of essentials 
that are most expensive right now, 
from housing to fuel, to groceries. And 
workers in blue-collar industries are 
among those having the hardest time

keeping up. U.S. manufacturing work-
ers are seeing their lowest average 
earnings—adjusted for inflation—since 
2014, while the overall private-sector 
workforce is seeing wages at 2019 lev-
els. 
Unfortunately, these hardships show 
little sign of slowing anytime soon. 
Last month’s core inflation, when com-
pared to just a few months earlier, is 
actually accelerating. So we have got 
the worst inflation since 1981. The vast 
majority of Americans are saying it 
has them in a bind financially. And it 
is low- and middle-income families who 
are actually bearing the brunt of it. 
This, Madam President, is the land-
scape as Washington Democrats keep 
trying to force even more party-line 
liberal bills with even more new Wash-
ington spending and—for a bonus—a 
bonus—massive new tax hikes. For the 
better part of a year, our colleagues 
have been trying to cook up legislation 
that would make life harder for small 
businesses, attack affordable American 
energy, and hike income taxes on fami-
lies in every single tax bracket. 
Apparently, for most Washington 
Democrats, spending the country into 
inflation actually wasn’t enough. Now, 
for a second act, they want to tax us 
into a recession. The response for 
Democrats robbing American families 
once cannot be for Democrats to rob 
American families a second time. 
PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS 
Madam President, now, on a related 
matter, one of the things Washington 
Democrats appear most eager to do 
with their one-party control of govern-
ment is to resurrect their war on 
America’s world-leading medical inno-
vation sector. In a statement just last 
week, President Biden praised fellow 
Democrats for having ‘‘beaten back’’ 
the industry behind most of the world’s 
lifesaving treatments and cures. And as 
things stand right now, it appears our 
colleagues intend to work from a fa-
miliar leftwing playbook in the coming 
weeks. 
Washington Democrats are working 
right now—right now—to find ways to 
put more bureaucracy between Amer-
ican patients and the treatments they 
rely on. They want to put socialist 
price 
controls 
between 
American 
innovators and new cures for debili-
tating diseases. With one-party Demo-
cratic control of government, they just 
might get away with it. But our col-
leagues need to think again. Even just 
the medicine-related parts of their par-
tisan plans would have hugely, hugely 
negative consequences for our country. 
The American people know that gov-
ernment can’t magically make things 
cost less by passing laws saying things 
should cost less. There is no Wash-
ington magic wand—trust me—or else 
we would have every American driving 
$1 pickup trucks and eating $1 steaks 
just by passing a law setting those 
prices at $1. 
There is no such thing as a free 
lunch. The bill for made-up price con-
trols always comes due. In this case, 
the invoice will be delivered to the 
American people who are living with 
actual health challenges. The price of 
bigger government will be fewer life-
saving cures and less innovation in the 
future. 
Let’s face it, prescription treatments 
are expensive to produce. Long-term 
investments in cutting-edge research 
and development require certainty. 
What Washington Democrats want to 
do right now would bleed hundreds of 
billions of dollars in potential R&D out 
of American industry, shrinking the 
pipeline for new therapeutics for pa-
tients with chronic conditions, pouring 
cold water on the next breakthroughs 
in the fight against Alzheimer’s and 
Parkinson’s. 
Prescription drug socialism would 
have devastating and compounding ef-
fects. By one analysis, price controls 
like the ones Washington Democrats 
want to ram through could cost more 
than 330 million cumulative years of 
life expectancy. That is enough to 
shorten every American’s life by a full 
year. 
Two years ago, in 2020, America’s 
medical innovators were busy blowing 
away expectations and responding to a 
once-in-a-century pandemic with life-
saving therapeutics and vaccines in 
record time—record time. Two years 
later, in 2022, Democrats have decided 
that 
what 
those 
same 
innovators 
need—the same innovators need—is 
heavyhanded 
Washington 
micro-
management from the same politicians 
who couldn’t even—listen to this— 
couldn’t even keep baby formula on 
store shelves. 
Our country is contending with his-
toric inflation. Our economy is on the 
brink of recession. And Washington 
Democrats want to gamble with the 
health of the American people? It 
doesn’t get much more reckless than 
that. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
wonder if Americans think the cost of 
prescription drugs are too high. I won-
der if Americans realize that the cost 
of prescription drugs are so high in this 
country that they are driving the cost 
of health insurance premiums up. 
Don’t take my word for it. BlueCross 
BlueShield of Illinois told me that di-
rectly. Why are premiums going up? 
Prescription drug prices are going up. 
I wonder if the American people real-
ize there are only two nations on Earth 
that allow drug companies to advertise 
drugs on television. You know one of 
them: United States of America. The 
other: New Zealand. No other country 
allows them to take place. 
I wonder if the American people real-
ize that the same exact American 
drugs that are sold here at the highest 
prices are sold at a deep discount in 
other countries: Canada. In Canada, 
the reason American drugs cost less 
than they do in America is because the 
Canadian people won’t tolerate the 
prices 
pharmaceutical 
companies 
charge people in this country. So they 
established 
standards 
and 
cut 
the 
prices for the exact same drugs made, 
manufactured, and sold in the United 
States. They are not alone. Europe 
does the same thing, bringing down 
these prices. 
So we decided that at least in one 
area—one area—we were going to make 
an exception to this overpricing of pre-
scription drugs: the Veterans’ Adminis-
tration. We said it costs a lot to keep 
our promise to veterans who have 
served this country and need medical 
care afterward. So we are going to 
allow the Veterans’ Administration— 
we do under law—to negotiate with the 
drug companies to bring prices down. It 
works. They are brought down dra-
matically. 
For the longest time, many of us 
have thought that isn’t enough because 
most of the drugs are being sold out-
side the Veterans’ Administration, and 
there is no negotiation; it is a take-it- 
or-leave-it. Medicare—tens of millions 
of Americans who are covered by Medi-
care face the cost of drugs which are 
sky-high. 
So we decided, on the Democratic 
side, that we were going to listen to 
the people we represent, who have told 
us over and over again that when it 
comes to the cost of living and ex-
penses families face, many of these 
families were facing a choice of their 
money or their lives to buy drugs that 
doctors told them were essential for 
their survival. So we proposed that, fi-
nally, the pharmaceutical companies 
have to negotiate with the government 
when it comes to Medicare drug pric-
ing. 
Now, you didn’t hear that directly 
from the Senator from Kentucky who 
just spoke. He talked about socialism 
in pricing drugs. Socialism? For the 
government to suggest we want to bar-
gain for prices? These companies, inci-
dentally, are not getting by hand to 
mouth. They are doing quite well, and 
they are making a lot of money. 
And they didn’t do it on their own. I 
want to address that issue, this notion 
that if they were paid less for their 
drugs, it would stifle innovation. The 
pharmaceutical 
industry 
typically 
spends more money on advertising 
than they do on research. 
Why would they do that? So that 
some people watching the ad of a per-
son skipping through a field of flowers 
will finally get to the point where they 
can spell ‘‘Xarelto’’ and go into a doc-
tor’s office and say: I want to skip 
through flowers. I want Xarelto. And— 
you know what—some doctors say 
‘‘fine’’ and write the script. That is 
why 
the 
cost 
of 
medicine 
and 
healthcare goes up. 
The bottom line is this. These phar-
maceutical companies, as good as they 
are, as many things as they find, they 
don’t do it alone. You know what the 
No. 1 supplier of research information 
is to the private sector pharmaceutical 
companies in America? The Federal 
Government. The National Institutes

of Health. We spend tens of billions of 
dollars each year doing basic research, 
which is then used by the pharma-
ceutical company to develop their 
drugs. 
Is it too much to ask them to bargain 
a fair price for drugs sold to Medicare 
so that the taxpayers get a break, and 
the pharmaceutical profits may go 
down just slightly? I don’t think it is 
too much to ask. 
We are going to have an interesting 
debate in the next few weeks because 
the Democrats think it is time that 
pharma be held responsible for dra-
matically overcharging Americans for 
pharmaceutical drugs that cost a frac-
tion of its price in Canada and Europe. 
The Senator from Kentucky obvi-
ously sees it another way. He thinks it 
is socialism. He calls it a free lunch— 
we want to give away a free lunch. It 
isn’t a free lunch when you can’t afford 
to fill your prescription the doctor 
gave you and you wonder if you are 
jeopardizing your health or your life. 
Take the drug insulin. We are work-
ing on that too. Insulin wasn’t discov-
ered by Americans; it was discovered 
by Canadians back in the early part of 
the 20th century. And they decided— 
and what a gesture it was—that they 
were going to give away and surrender 
the patent on this discovery. 
Before then, it was not atypical that 
people died from diabetes. After insu-
lin, they could survive. It was a life 
and death drug. And the researchers 
who discovered it said: This shouldn’t 
be a profitmaker; this should be some-
thing that is priced so that people can 
continue to live. 
Well, what has happened to insulin? 
Over the years, the pharmaceutical 
companies started doing their magic, 
and the cost of insulin for many people 
is dramatically higher than they can 
afford. Some people actually cut the 
amount of insulin which they are told 
to take because they can’t afford it. 
We want to bring down the cost of 
this lifesaving drug to a $35 a month 
maximum premium for insulin, and I 
think that is a reasonable amount of 
money. 
So I believe that when it comes to 
the drug industry in America, it is a 
great sector of our economy. They have 
found some wonderful things, with the 
help of Federal research. They are 
making profits, as I guess every private 
sector company is designed to do. But 
it is not unreasonable for us to ask, it 
is not socialistic for us to ask, as 
American citizens, that they negotiate 
fair prices for all Americans. They do 
it for veterans. They can do it for 
Medicare and others. 
And if Senator MCCONNELL is sig-
naling we are in for a fight over this 
issue, all I have to say are three words: 
Bring it on. Bring it on. The American 
people are sick and tired of the over-
pricing of these drugs, and I think it is 
time that we have this debate. And if 
the Republicans want to stay on the 
side of pharma and say the Democrats 
are wrong, let’s take that to the Amer-
ican people in November. I think it is a 
viable issue. 
ABORTION 
Madam President, in the weeks since 
the Alito-Thomas Supreme Court ma-
jority erased the constitutional right 
to 
abortion, 
the 
rightwing 
disinformation machine has kicked 
into high gear. Again and again, we 
hear the same empty words of reassur-
ance from the Republican side. They 
claim that overturning Roe simply 
handed the question of abortion back 
to the people’s representatives, back to 
the States—just that simple. 
This is false, and they know it. The 
reality is overturning Roe has un-
leashed a healthcare crisis in this 
country. It has ripped a right to make 
essential healthcare decisions away 
from the people and their doctors and 
handed it to the politicians in indi-
vidual States. 
As soon as Roe was overturned by the 
Alito Supreme Court, nearly a dozen 
States outlawed abortion. 
In Ohio, abortion access is so re-
stricted that we have heard this hor-
rible, bone-chilling story of a 10-year- 
old rape victim who was denied care in 
the State of Ohio. Ten years old, 
Madam President. At the age of 10, par-
ents and grandparents are still worried 
about 10-year-old grandkids crossing 
the street. This 10-year-old victim had 
been raped. She was pregnant. 
The State’s law in Ohio only permits 
abortions before fetal cardiac activity 
is detected, which is usually at 6 weeks 
of gestation. At the time this 10-year- 
old child sought care, she was 6 weeks 
and 3 days pregnant. She missed the 
deadline. So the child was forced to 
flee her home State of Ohio and travel 
to Indiana, where she was given med-
ical care. 
And from the moment this story 
made headlines, what was the response 
from Republican politicians and the 
conservative media? They said it was 
fake news; that it is a hoax. They ac-
cused the doctor who treated the girl of 
just plain lying. They said that Demo-
crats were making up these doomsday 
scenarios to scare the American people. 
The Wall Street Journal—the Wall 
Street Journal, Madam President— 
even ran an editorial calling the story 
‘‘Too Good to Confirm.’’ 
But unthinkable and sickening as it 
may be, the story is true. So why did 
Republicans go to such great lengths to 
discredit it? Because they refused to 
admit the truth. When faced with a 
case that shows the extreme con-
sequences of outlawing abortion, as the 
Supreme Court just did weeks ago, 
they dismissed the facts as a lie. 
Well, here is the truth. Republican 
anti-choice policies will force chil-
dren—children who are still not old 
enough to cross the street on their 
own—to give birth. Ten years old. And 
Republicans are not content with sim-
ply banning all abortion. They want to 
prosecute the healthcare professionals 
who have to make the life-and-death 
decisions in the practice of medicine— 
healthcare professionals like the one 
who treated this little girl from Ohio. 
Just last week, Indiana’s Republican 
attorney general declared he was going 
to investigate this doctor from Indiana 
who provided this abortion. Well, what 
were his grounds for investigating? He 
claimed that the doctor didn’t properly 
report the abortion to State authori-
ties. But even that isn’t true. Records 
show the doctor followed the law ex-
actly as it is written. 
How did we reach this point? It has 
not even been a month since the Dobbs 
decision, and Republican officials are 
already finding ways to intimidate doc-
tors who are providing essential care to 
Americans and America’s children. The 
radical rightwing majority on the Su-
preme Court has given these law-
makers a green light to enact the most 
unreasonable, 
outrageous 
abortion 
bans imaginable. 
And as cruel as these bans may be, 
they cannot change the reality that re-
productive healthcare is healthcare. In 
some cases, an abortion can mean the 
difference between life and death. 
The moment politicians start med-
dling in life-or-death health decisions, 
the moment we turn over these life-or- 
death decisions to a legislator rather 
than to a doctor and a patient, we are 
headed down a dark, dangerous, and 
deadly road. 
Here is what is happening. Right 
now, there is a doctor in America, 
today, who is being forced to make an 
impossible decision: Do I risk jail time, 
do I risk criminal charges by providing 
the care that I believe my patient 
needs, or do I sit back and risk my pa-
tient’s life and health from pregnancy 
complications? 
What a choice. Do you want to make 
that as an elected official? I am not 
competent to make that choice. I am a 
lawyer—liberal arts. I didn’t spend a 
day in medical school. When it comes 
to the people I care about—my family 
and others—I want medical profes-
sionals to make that decision, not run- 
of-the-mill politicians. 
Last week, the Texas attorney gen-
eral filed a lawsuit against President 
Biden’s administration. What was the 
reason? Because the administration 
issued guidance making it clear that 
healthcare providers are legally pro-
tected when offering legally mandated 
life- or health-saving services in emer-
gency situations. 
Think about that. Texas would rath-
er allow women to risk their health— 
even death—than allow them to seek 
emergency lifesaving care. 
And, 
yesterday, 
the 
New 
York 
Times—and I commend this article to 
everyone—reported that miscarriage 
patients in Texas are being turned 
away by doctors. These women are 
being denied care because ‘‘doctors . . . 
worried the patients might have actu-
ally taken abortion pills that hadn’t 
expelled the pregnancy, two situations 
that appear medically identical.’’

July 18, 2022 
[T]he art of medicine is lost and ac-
tually has been replaced by fear. 
This is the world we have entered 
after the fall of Roe. And it is a wake- 
up call for every Member of this Sen-
ate. Don’t turn your eyes away from it. 
This is the reality of the Supreme 
Court decision. 
Our constitutional rights should not, 
and cannot, differ State by State. For 
50 years, this was a fundamentally con-
stitutional guaranteed freedom. And it 
needs to be protected again by Federal 
law. 
I don’t think this Court is going to 
stop with overturning Roe. I com-
mended to all my colleagues, there was 
a speech made last Thursday by Sen-
ator KAINE of Virginia. Before he was 
in politics, he was a civil rights lawyer. 
And he is a good one. And he explained 
the 14th Amendment and what it 
means if we were to take the Alito 
Court analysis and basis and reject the 
notion that the 14th Amendment de-
fines our citizenship in so many dif-
ferent ways. 
Justice Clarence Thomas has indi-
cated the far right majority is coming 
next for the right to family birth con-
trol and contraception. 
Oh, that can’t be true, Senator. They 
aren’t going to go after birth control 
pills—watch them; they have already 
announced they are underway—and 
marriage equality and making our de-
cisions about the future of our fami-
lies. 
This Senate must act to protect mar-
riage equality and all the fundamental 
human rights that are under threat by 
this radical Supreme Court. The ques-
tion, though, when November comes 
around, will the American people care, 
or will they take a nap? Will they de-
cide it is somebody else’s problem? 
Well, I hope they don’t because these 
problems are really facing all of us as 
Americans, whether we like it or not. 
We would rather not talk about this 
issue, but the Supreme Court gives us 
no choice. 
Now, let’s be sensible. These are med-
ical decisions that should be made by 
medical professionals. 
FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION 
Madam President, 2 weeks ago, the 
Center for Disease Control issued an 
alert: There was a listeria outbreak 
that sent nearly 2 dozen people in 10 
States to the hospital. 
For those who may not know, listeria 
is the bacteria that causes listeriosis. 
It is serious. It is a life-threatening ill-
ness. In most cases, the infection 
causes fever, sometimes confusion, loss 
of balance; but in some cases, it can be 
deadly. 
Tragically, 
an 
expectant 
mother 
from Massachusetts who contracted it 
lost her baby. And another person in 
my home State of Illinois lost her life. 
Her name was Mary Billman. She was 
from Pesotum, IL. It is a small 
downstate community, about 15 miles 
south of Champaign. 
In January, she went to Florida to 
visit her daughter. One day, she de-
cided to grab an ice cream cone. Harm-
less, right? As it turned out, no. That 
ice cream was contaminated. Ice cream 
is the most likely source of this lis-
teria outbreak. Mary Billman was 79 
years old. The listeria that she faced 
took her life. 
This outbreak is one example of a 
long list of outbreaks in America, 
which are becoming way too common. 
The Food and Drug Administration is 
responsible for regulating 80 percent of 
our Nation’s food supply. Nearly all of 
the foods we buy at the supermarket 
are supposed to be guaranteed as safe 
by the Food and Drug Administration. 
So when we pick up a box of cereal for 
the kids, a bag of lettuce, a jar of pea-
nut butter, a pint of ice cream, we as-
sume it has been inspected. We assume 
it is safe. 
Here is the problem: Too often, that 
is not the case. The FDA is failing to 
uphold its most basic food safety re-
sponsibility: inspecting facilities. Over 
the past decade, the number of inspec-
tions it performs has fallen by nearly 
60 percent—60–percent decline in in-
spections in the last decade. And to add 
insult to injury, that decline happened 
after Congress passed the FDA Food 
Safety Modernization Act—a 2011 bill, 
which I offered, that instructed the 
FDA to increase the number of inspec-
tions. They did the opposite. 
If that weren’t bad enough, in 2017, 
the HHS inspector general concluded 
that, even when the FDA did inspect 
facilities, the Agency did not always 
take action when it uncovered signifi-
cant inspection violations. We know 
that story. 
This summer, a bacteria known as 
Cronobacter contaminated infant for-
mula, leading to nationwide shortages. 
The FDA was alerted to this problem 4 
months before it took any action—4 
months. So even when the FDA per-
forms an inspection and identifies a 
threat to public health, it doesn’t take 
timely action, not even when the prob-
lem can sicken and kill adults, chil-
dren, infants. That is hard to imagine. 
The FDA is adrift. And our most vul-
nerable people in America—children, 
mothers, and older Americans—are at 
risk. 
Last week, I introduced a bill that 
would transfer all of FDA’s food re-
sponsibilities to a new Agency outside 
the FDA that we hope will actually do 
its job. We are calling it simply the 
Food Safety Administration. Congress-
woman ROSA DELAURO, my friend and a 
Representative from the State of Con-
necticut, has introduced the com-
panion bill in the House. Our bill rep-
resents a clean slate for food safety in 
America. It would create a new Food 
Safety Administration that would be 
run by food safety experts who were fo-
cused on protecting the Nation’s food 
supply. 
If I went into detail of the respon-
sibilities of different Federal Agencies 
to inspect foods, you wouldn’t believe 
it. If you have a cheese pizza, Food and 
Drug Administration; put pepperoni on 
the pizza, now it is the Department of 
Agriculture. It changes based on defini-
tions that might have made sense 
sometime in the past, make no sense 
anymore. 
On behalf of the 15 million Americans 
who contract a foodborne illness each 
year and tens of thousands who are 
hospitalized, it is time to stop talking 
about it and do something. 
The FDA failed my constituent Mary 
Billman, along with 3,000 Americans 
like her who lose their lives every year 
to foodborne illness. Many of these 
deaths are preventable, but they will 
keep happening if we don’t fix our Na-
tion’s defunct food safety system. 
We say America is the wealthiest Na-
tion in human history. We are blessed, 
we know, with one of the most abun-
dant agriculture industries. And we are 
home to some of the best and brightest 
scientists in the world. So there is ab-
solutely no excuse for allowing the 
FDA’s food safety failures to persist. 
With our legislation, we can replace 
this broken system with one that will 
finally protect our families. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
INFLATION 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
at each of my 99 county meetings and 
in conversations with Iowans gen-
erally, the record cost of living is top 
of mind as Iowa families feel the im-
pact of 9.1 percent inflation. They feel 
that on their family budgets, for sure. 
Due to rampant inflation spurred by 
reckless government spending, con-
sumer prices are escalating at a his-
toric pace. Middle-class Americans are 
paying more for everything from gaso-
line, food, and shelter, to home fur-
nishings, prescription drugs, and cloth-
ing. 
Since President Biden took office 
January 2021, consumer prices have in-
creased, on average, 12 percent nation-
ally. As a result, the average Iowa 
household has seen its monthly living 
expenses increase to $670 a month. The 
rising cost of transportation, energy, 
and food has hit household budgets par-
ticularly hard. 
Since January 2021, Americans on av-
erage are paying an extra $206 a month 
on energy, $334 a month on transpor-
tation and gas, and an additional $76 a 
month for food. It is no wonder infla-
tion is the No. 1 concern that I hear 
about as I tour Iowa’s 99 counties. 
Rising 
wages 
have 
helped 
some 
Iowans manage the rising cost of liv-
ing. However, for most, rising prices 
have far outpaced the wage gains. 
While trying to make up an extra $600 
a month is hard enough for wage earn-
ers, it is next to impossible for senior

citizens who are on fixed incomes. For 
senior citizens, there is no prospect of 
getting a raise like you might get if 
you have a job. They must make do by 
stretching 
their 
Social 
Security 
checks, their pensions, or investment 
income, if they have that. They must 
count on just stretching that as far as 
they can. 
While there is an annual cost of liv-
ing adjustment intended to maintain 
the purchasing power of Social Secu-
rity benefits, this adjustment lags in-
flation increases. The 5.9 percent COLA 
for 2022 was the largest increase since 
1982, the last time we had this out-of- 
control inflation. However, that is far 
below the 9.1 percent annual inflation 
rate reported for June. So just like 
wages go up 5.5, they can’t keep up 
with a 9.1 percent increase inflation. 
So you get a 5.9 percent increase in 
your COLA for Social Security; that is 
far below the 9.1 percent increase in in-
flation. Now, the Social Security Ad-
ministration reports the 2023 COLA 
will be between 7.3 percent and 10.8 per-
cent. Well, that might help. But will it 
make up for what inflation is? 
Unfortunately, seniors have another 
6 months until they see this relief in 
their benefit payments. 
The current turmoil in the stock 
market has made it even harder for 
seniors to keep their heads above 
water. They are seeing their retire-
ment savings in 401(k)s, their IRAs, 
and their non-tax-advantaged accounts 
eroded by stock market declines, by in-
flation, and by taxes. 
Seniors are understandably looking 
to the administration and to this very 
Congress to take action to address in-
flation and rising prices. Unfortu-
nately, all the administration and a 
majority in Congress have offered them 
are false assurances, more reckless 
spending, and damaging tax hikes. 
It is time that we try an entirely dif-
ferent approach. That approach should 
be one focused on fiscal prudence, tar-
geted non-inflation inducing relief, and 
increasing 
market 
competition 
or 
boosting supply. 
The most important thing Congress 
can do to fight inflation is stop its 
reckless spending. Even better would 
be to trim the budget to eliminate un-
necessary spending. 
As for providing inflation relief, it 
must be done in a way that won’t add 
to our growing debt or further fuel the 
flames of inflation. One way to do this 
is to provide targeted inflation relief 
that incentivizes and rewards tax-
payers who save rather than spend. 
This is the approach taken in the 
Middle-Class Savings and Investment 
Act, which I introduced last month. 
Under my legislation, most middle- 
class savings and investment income 
would be subject to zero tax. This 
means middle-class seniors would be 
subject to no Federal income tax on 
their long-term capital gains and divi-
dend income. They would also be ex-
empt from Federal tax on up to $600 of 
interest income that they earn in a 
year. Exempting most middle-class 
savings from tax not only provides re-
lief to those seniors and to others but 
also will reduce tax bias that favors 
consumption over saving. 
While not a silver bullet by any 
stretch of the imagination to stop in-
flation, encouraging more consumers 
to save rather than spend may help re-
duce inflation pressures by dampening 
demand. 
Importantly, my proposal is fully 
paid for, so it won’t add to our 
unsustainable debt and deficits. 
In addition to practicing fiscal re-
sponsibility and providing sensible, 
targeted relief, I support policies de-
signed to hold down prices by increas-
ing supply and promoting greater com-
petition in the marketplace. A prime 
example of this is my work to rein in 
out-of-control prescription drug prices. 
Americans—especially our seniors— 
are paying too much for their prescrip-
tion drugs. AARP says brand-name 
drugs that seniors use are going up 
more than twice the rate of inflation. 
Recent data indicates that nearly a 
half million seniors filled a single pre-
scription that met their out-of-pocket 
threshold and millions of seniors are 
reaching the catastrophic phase of Part 
D. 
We must act to lower prescription 
drug prices. I passed out of the Finance 
Committee a bipartisan and negotiated 
bill that will lower the cost of prescrip-
tion drugs. It is called Grassley-Wyden 
or by its name the ‘‘Prescription Drug 
Pricing Reduction Act.’’ It saves sen-
iors $72 billion and taxpayers $95 bil-
lion. It caps out-of-pocket costs at 
$3,100 and eliminates the doughnut 
hole. And perhaps the most important 
part of it will also cap year-over-year 
price increases of prescription drugs at 
the CPI. This also ends taxpayer sub-
sidies to Big Pharma and provides real 
relief to our seniors. 
Let’s not waste another minute to 
lower drug prices. I will work with any-
one who wants to pass the bipartisan 
Grassley-Wyden bill. 
In addition to prescription drugs, I 
am leading the charge to lower the cost 
of 
grocery 
bills. 
The 
big 
four 
meatpackers who have over 85 percent 
of the market use anticompetitive tac-
tics to hurt smaller producers or inde-
pendent family farmers. While inde-
pendent farmers in Iowa are forced to 
sell livestock at dirt-cheap prices, the 
cost to the consumer is climbing to a 
historic high level. This is happening 
at the same time the big four packers 
are reaping record profits. 
Just this past week, Sysco—the larg-
est food distributor in the United 
States—filed a lawsuit against these 
very same big four packers alleging 
price fixing. Sysco claims that these 
packers intentionally reduce the num-
ber of slaughtered cattle to inflate beef 
prices that families must pay at the su-
permarket. 
We must maintain a cash market for 
cattle producers and thus increase 
competition. Toward this goal, I am 
spearheading two bipartisan bills that 
sailed through the Senate Agriculture 
Committee that would do just that. 
Another reason why we are seeing 
high prices on store shelves is the high 
price of gasoline and diesel. Contrary 
to what some people believe, food does 
not grow on grocery store shelves; food 
comes to the stores on trucks. And our 
country has never seen prices at the 
pump as high as they are right now. In 
fact, gas prices have doubled since 
President Biden took office. 
Instead of focusing on domestic fuel 
production, the President and his ad-
ministration have caved to environ-
mentalists in shaping our energy poli-
cies. Since energy is an input in every 
item on the store shelves, energy prices 
mean climbing prices at the cash reg-
ister at Hy-Vee in Des Moines, IA, or 
Walmart anyplace in the country and 
every other store. 
It is time to reverse course on Presi-
dent Biden’s energy policies and pursue 
an ‘‘all of the above’’ strategy. Let’s go 
back to being energy independent rath-
er than energy dependent. 
Instead of just talking about infla-
tion and its impact on Iowa families 
and seniors, it is time for this Congress 
to stop reckless spending and start fo-
cusing on commonsense relief and re-
forms. I am leading the charge to do 
just that through targeted tax relief— 
the savings bill that I talked about; 
market reforms in key industries to 
hold down prices, like the cattle bill I 
was talking about; and by boosting the 
supply of fuel to keep prices at the 
pump in check. I urge my colleagues on 
both sides of the aisle to join me in 
these efforts. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

pore. The clerk will call the roll.

SEMICONDUCTORS 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, it 
has been more than a year since the 
U.S. Senate passed the bipartisan U.S. 
Innovation and Competition Act, com-
monly known as USICA. It includes an 
important 
provision 
that 
Senator 
MARK WARNER, the Senator from Vir-
ginia, and I introduced more than 2 
years ago called the CHIPS Act, which 
is designed to shore up a dangerously 
vulnerable supply chain of high-end 
semiconductors 
from 
Asia 
to 
the 
United States. 
The fact is that the United States 
makes zero percent of those advanced 
semiconductors that are necessary for 
everything from your iPhone to fifth- 
generation Joint Strike Fighters like 
the F–35. 
Unfortunately, after we passed the 
bipartisan bill in the Senate, the House 
decided to go the partisan route and

add additional, unrelated pieces of 
their wish list, everything from hand-
outs to labor bosses to money for a 
U.N. climate slush fund. 
We were in the process of stripping 
out these partisan provisions through 
the conference committee that was ap-
pointed by the House and the Senate 
when Senator SCHUMER made a big de-
cision. He said that Democrats were 
likely to bring to the floor another 
reckless 
tax-and-spending 
bill 
like 
Build Back Better, although in a dif-
ferent version. Our Democratic col-
leagues got the bright idea that they 
wanted to revive something like the 
Green New Deal, increase taxes on 
working families, and give runaway in-
flation even more staying power. 
Well, Senator MCCONNELL, the Re-
publican leader, and Members of the 
Republican conference thought that 
was a bad idea and said that there 
would not be a bipartisan conference 
bill and a partisan, reckless tax-and- 
spending spree bill. It wasn’t a threat; 
it was just a statement of fact. There is 
no such thing as negotiating with our 
Senate colleagues on the Democratic 
side while they sit on the sidelines 
drafting partisan legislation. 
The provisions negotiated out of the 
bipartisan bill wouldn’t land in the 
trash; they would simply be recycled 
through a partisan reconciliation bill. 
But Senator MANCHIN, the Senator 
from West Virginia, put an end to that 
last week when he killed the bill that 
would increase taxes on families and 
small businesses and implement costly 
Green New Deal climate policies. In my 
book, that is a big win for the Amer-
ican people, who are already facing 
high prices at grocery stores and at the 
filling station. 
With this reckless tax-and-spending 
spree reconciliation bill dead and bur-
ied, there is now an opening to do 
something that we can agree upon on a 
bipartisan basis. I spent the weekend 
talking with a number of our col-
leagues, both Republicans and Demo-
crats, and I am cautiously optimistic 
that we can now proceed to a vote on 
the USICA bill or some version of it. 
Based on our discussions, it sounds like 
the majority leader will bring a nar-
rower bill to the floor that focuses on 
chips funding—again, something that 
has been pending now for more than 2 
years—as well as tax incentives for 
manufacturers. 
This bill will not be USICA, though, 
and it won’t be ‘‘Endless Frontier,’’ 
which was the name of the bill when it 
was initially introduced, and it sounds 
like a far cry from the COMPETES 
Act, which was the House’s partisan re-
sponse; rather, from all reports, it fo-
cuses on the core issue of reshoring 
American 
semiconductor 
manufac-
turing here in the United States. 
With COVID–19, we became aware of 
a lot of supply chain vulnerabilities 
that I think we just, frankly, were not 
aware of. It is one thing to be aware of 
a supply chain for things like toys or 
consumer items, but it is another to be 
dependent on a supply chain—a foreign 
supply chain—for something as critical 
to our way of life and our economy and 
our national security as advanced 
semiconductors. 
What Senator WARNER and I initially 
proposed and what I hope we will be 
voting on this week provides market- 
based incentives to close the cost gap 
between manufacturing overseas in 
places like Taiwan and doing so here in 
the United States. According to a Tai-
wan 
semiconductor 
manufacturing 
company located in Taipei, they figure 
it costs about 30 percent less to manu-
facture these high-end semiconductors 
in Taiwan than it does in the United 
States. 
If we are going to get some of that 
manufacturing capacity back here to 
the United States to protect us against 
potential blockades, whether it comes 
from a military conflict or a pandemic 
or a natural disaster, we are going to 
have to find a way to provide incen-
tives for those manufacturing, fabrica-
tion facilities to be located here in the 
United States. That is what we are 
talking about. 
There is a closing window of oppor-
tunity 
for 
us 
to 
act. 
Secretary 
Raimondo, the Secretary of Commerce 
in the Biden administration, has made 
clear, as have various CEOs of semicon-
ductor companies, that if the United 
States does not act soon, they will 
have to make a business decision to lo-
cate their manufacturing facilities in 
other places in the world where those 
incentives are already provided. But it 
does nothing to protect the U.S. econ-
omy or national security to have an-
other fab or manufacturing facility lo-
cated 
somewhere 
else 
around 
the 
world. We need them here in the United 
States if we are going to protect our 
economy and guard against those na-
tional security threats. 
So if we don’t make a decision soon— 
and I am talking about in the next cou-
ple of weeks—then we can kiss those 
manufacturing facilities goodbye, and 
places like Texas, Ohio, Arizona, and 
other States around the country that 
might benefit from that construction 
and the high-paying jobs that go along 
with them will see them taken to Eu-
rope or somewhere else. 
Well, even though the Senator from 
West Virginia said he would not sup-
port the reckless tax-and-spending por-
tion of the reconciliation bill, it is pos-
sible our colleagues will move forward 
with a slimmed-down version of an al-
ready-slimmed-down reconciliation bill 
that would require the Federal Govern-
ment to set a price for drugs covered 
by Medicare—a move which I believe 
will stifle innovation. Price fixing al-
ways results in scarcity, meaning con-
sumers—particularly 
seniors—will 
have less access to choice. It would 
also extend ObamaCare subsidies for 
insurance companies and prop up the 
struggling healthcare marketplace. 
It is clear that I oppose those provi-
sions and the perennial effort to legis-
late on a partisan basis, but the truth 
is, if the Democrats have 50 votes plus 
the Vice President, they can pass it 
notwithstanding 
Republican 
opposi-
tion. We all understand that. But given 
the fact that these horrific tax in-
creases are off the table as a result of 
the announcement from the senior Sen-
ator from West Virginia, I believe we 
are in a posture where we can go for-
ward with the chips funding and other 
related provisions, and I hope we will 
be able to take action on that in the 
coming days. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Madam President, on another mat-
ter, last week, Senator CRUZ, my junior 
Senator and friend, and I took five 
Members of our Republican conference 
to McAllen, TX, which is in the Rio 
Grande Valley, which is the epicenter 
of a massive humanitarian and immi-
gration crisis that has been going on 
for at least the last year and a half. 
McAllen is in the Border Patrol’s Rio 
Grande Valley Sector, it is called, and 
one of the busiest portions of the U.S.- 
Mexico border when it comes to illegal 
migration. For example, between Octo-
ber and May, Rio Grande Valley Sector 
agents logged more than 333,000 border 
crossings—more than any of the other 
20 Border Patrol sectors. 
During the visit, our colleagues were 
able to see and learn what, frankly, as 
Texas Senators, Senator CRUZ and I 
learned long ago about the traumatic, 
heart-wrenching consequences of this 
unabated crisis: groups of migrants 
with toddlers, who were lying asleep on 
the dirt road, practically ill from the 
heat and exhaustion. 
By the way, the temperature is rou-
tinely in excess of 100 degrees at this 
time of year. 
One mother and her 7-year-old child, 
the mom in tears and heartbroken, 
having left another 10-year-old child 
behind in Guatemala, were encoun-
tered. Unaccompanied children of 7 
years of age, with nothing more than 
the clothes on their back, a birth cer-
tificate, and family contact informa-
tion on a piece of paper—these were the 
sorts of things that my Senate col-
leagues had a chance to experience, 
which, unfortunately, I have seen all 
too many times before. These aren’t 
heart-wrenching scenes from a war- 
torn country halfway around the world. 
This is happening on our front door-
step. This is happening in Texas every 
day. 
My colleagues and I also spoke with 
some of the folks whose homes and 
properties sit along the U.S.-Texas bor-
der with Mexico. They shared with us 
stories about what it is like to live 
along one of the hot spots for illegal 
border crossings. 
One resident told us last year the 
Brooks County Sheriff’s Department

believe the coast is clear, put them in 
a truck and transport them north. 
They will have to go through a border 
checkpoint—or an interior checkpoint 
in Falfurrias, for example, which is 
where Brooks County is located, but 
what happens is, the smugglers will 
tell the migrants: Get out of the vehi-
cle and walk around the checkpoint, 
and we will pick you up on the north 
side. 
The problem is, this is very tough 
terrain and over 100-degree-plus tem-
perature. Frankly, when some of the 
migrants become ill or injured, they 
are simply left behind to die, and that 
is why so many bodies have been recov-
ered, for example, in Brooks County on 
a regular basis. 
It is tough to imagine the toll this 
sort of discovery takes on a farmer or 
rancher, and then multiply that shock 
by more than 100. 
Then we heard about the losses to 
property suffered because of this cri-
sis—stolen 
vehicles, 
broken 
fences, 
damaged crops, vandalism, people who 
are afraid to let their own family mem-
bers live and work on their own prop-
erty because they are worried about 
the drugs, and they are worried about 
the potential violence. They talked 
about the safety concerns for their 
families and employees because drug 
traffickers and human smugglers go 
right through their backyards. 
These men and women are under-
standably angry. They said to us: This 
is the United States of America, and I 
can’t let my daughter or wife or chil-
dren live and play or work on our own 
property? They are frustrated beyond 
belief because their families and em-
ployees, their homes and livelihoods 
are in jeopardy due to the Biden ad-
ministration’s failed border policies. 
In case there are any doubts, I want 
to emphasize that what is happening 
on the border right now does not ben-
efit anyone. 
Border Patrol agents are stretched 
thin. They are frustrated. They are 
overwhelmed by everything they are 
expected to shoulder. They have been 
told they cannot do the job that they 
took an oath to perform under policies 
by the Department of Homeland Secu-
rity, which can only be described as 
nonenforcement policies. 
Landowners are saddled with safety 
concerns and financial losses. 
Nongovernmental 
organizations, 
which are doing their best to help peo-
ple in need, are carrying the weight of 
this humanitarian crisis with no end in 
sight. Brave Texas Department of Pub-
lic 
Safety 
officers 
and 
National 
Guardsmen are making serious sac-
rifices as a result of the administra-
tion’s failure to secure the border. 
These guardsmen and the Department 
of Homeland Security should not have 
to do a job that is the responsibility of 
the Federal Government, but when the 
Federal Government won’t do its job, 
the State of Texas has no choice. One 
guardsman actually drowned while try-
ing to save two migrants struggling to 
swim across the Rio Grande River. And 
the migrants themselves are routinely 
abused, 
exploited, 
even 
raped 
and 
sometimes left for dead in the middle 
of unforgiving terrain. 
The only people really winning in 
this crisis are the criminal organiza-
tions and the human smugglers that 
are getting richer by the day. These 
cartels are transnational criminal or-
ganizations. They will traffic in any-
thing that makes them a buck. They 
are what one person has called com-
modity agnostic. They don’t care what 
that commodity is; their goal is simply 
to maximize their profit by whatever 
means necessary. And there is no ques-
tion that the Biden administration’s 
policies have helped enrich the cartels 
and resulted in too many migrants 
having lost their lives. 
Throughout my time in the Senate, I 
have had the privilege of working with 
countless men and women who live and 
work along the southern border. Their 
experiences and input have shed light 
on the scope and scale of this crisis, 
and I am glad to be able to welcome 
some of our Senate colleagues to join 
us for an informative trip to the Rio 
Grande Valley. And I appreciate our 
colleagues taking the time to come 
visit the US-Mexico border for an up-
date on the border crisis. Of course, 
most of them don’t come from border 
States, but in the memorable words of 
one of our colleagues now, every State 
is a border State because the con-
sequences of this huge migration and 
humanitarian crisis—not to mention 
the drugs that are smuggled across the 
border—affect every community and 
every State in our Nation. 
I also want to thank my constitu-
ents, my fellow Texans, who took the 
time out of their busy schedules to 
educate our colleagues: the officers, 
the agents, the landowners, the Na-
tional Guardsmen, the Texas Depart-
ment of Public Safety officials, the 
local sheriffs, and others. 
What is so shocking to me is, despite 
the complete security breakdown and, 
really, the lack of any dispute about 
what exactly is happening on the bor-
der, we just can’t seem to get the Biden 
administration’s 
attention. 
Land-
owners can tell them what it was like 
to discover the dead bodies of migrants 
who were abandoned by human smug-
glers, and those who do the Lord’s 
work at nongovernmental organiza-
tions can tell the tale of migrants who 
were violently assaulted and raped on 
the way to our country, some of whom 
arrived pregnant. If President Biden 
would take a moment to sit down with 
these folks who live and work along 
the border, he may begin to learn more 
and view this situation for what it 
really is: a humanitarian and security 
crisis precipitated by his administra-
tion’s unwillingness to secure our bor-
der. 
President Biden has an open invita-
tion to visit the Texas border, and I 
hope he will take us up on that. If he 
would, we might finally be able to get 
something done on a bipartisan basis 
to abate this crisis and to secure our 
open borders. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
THE ECONOMY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, when we look back at the many 
failures of the Biden administration, 
what I believe is going to stand out is 
really their commitment to doing 
things that sound good to other Wash-
ington Democrats but really are not 
serving we the people well. In fact, 
after spending another weekend work-
ing with local leaders back in Ten-
nessee, I will take it one step further 
and say that all Joe Biden and the 
Democrats have managed to do is find 
new ways to frighten we, the people. 
Yes, indeed, they are afraid of what 
this administration is going to do next 
because everything the White House 
has done over the past 18 months seems 
to make their lives worse each and 
every day. And the thing that is so in-
teresting, as I talk to Tennesseans, 
this is something where there is bipar-
tisan agreement, whether it is crime in 
the streets or the drug situation— 
much of that caused by this open bor-
der that is out of control—inflation, 
the price at the pump, the price at the 
grocery store. It is quite a stunning 
record on how to make the lives of the 
American people worse. 
Joe Biden and the Democrats have 
spent us into 9.1 percent inflation, and 
now, they want to tax us into a reces-
sion. The latest scheme is terrifying. 
Democrats are proposing a trillion dol-
lars in new tax increases. This includes 
a crippling new tax on small businesses 
as well as a tax increase on low- and 
middle-income Americans, which, if 
you recall, is something that President 
Biden said he would never do. 
The Democrats are prepared to push 
the economy off a cliff on behalf of a 
radical and radically unpopular agenda 
that the American people have repeat-
edly said they did not vote for and they 
do not want. According to recent poll-
ing by the New York Times, 77 percent 
of Americans believe that the country 
is heading in the wrong direction, and 
only 33 percent of Americans approve 
of the way Joe Biden is doing his job. 
If that is not an indictment of this lat-
est inflationary spending spree, I do 
not know what is. 
The 
American 
people 
understand 
that one man and one party are in full 
control of the Federal Government and 
that Joe Biden and the Democrats are 
responsible for the uncertainty and 
fear that is now driving their decisions. 
Thank 
God 
Tennessee 
has 
strong, 
smart local and State leaders who take 
their jobs seriously, who work hard 
every day to represent the people of 
our great State. 
I am about to wrap up my annual 95- 
county tour, and I can tell you that 
none of the county mayors and city 
managers that I have spoken to are 
worried about methane or proper pro-
noun usage. They just want to know

July 18, 2022 
what we plan to do about inflation, en-
ergy costs, supply chains, crime, drugs, 
and the open border. 
Jackson Mayor Scott Conger re-
cently described for me the nightmare 
that is planning for the future of a 
midsize city in Joe Biden’s America. 
Healthcare costs for police and fire-
fighters are up half a million dollars. 
Between public works and public safe-
ty, fuel costs alone are projected to 
beat last year’s total by $450,000. And 
utility and sanitation costs are already 
10 percent over budget. 
Now, Jackson and other cities in 
Tennessee don’t operate like Wash-
ington. They are very conservative 
with how they spend the taxpayers’ 
money, and they budget for the worst- 
case scenario. But even when they do 
have money to spend, Joe Biden’s sup-
ply chain crisis gets in the way. 
In Jackson, delays on new orders of 
police cars, trucks, construction sup-
plies have put growth on hold. They 
even have had to delay and scale back 
plans for a new homeless shelter. City 
officials in Dayton told me that the 
cost of a foot of pipe has gone up $10 in 
a year, from $4 to $14 a foot. I would 
ask my Democratic colleagues how 
they expect local government to handle 
a 200-percent increase in something as 
basic as pipe. We know that is a trick 
question because there is no planning 
for instances like that. Covington 
Mayor Justin Hanson also had a mes-
sage he wanted me to pass on for the 
record. Here is what he said: 
The rising cost of goods and services is 
really hitting municipal pocketbooks, espe-
cially at the gas pump. The rapid inflation 
combined with supply chain issues are really 
hurting cities like Covington. Parts, chemi-
cals, fleet vehicles . . . the list goes on. 
Some items ordered over a year ago still 
aren’t in our inventory. 
But I think the most shocking exam-
ple of how localities have suffered 
under these reckless policies is hap-
pening right now in McNairy County. 
Now, McNairy County is a rural coun-
ty, and it has fewer than 30,000 people. 
But the county still had to pad their 
budget by $700,000 to cover fuel for the 
sheriff and other county-owned vehi-
cles. That is almost a million dollars 
just to keep the police on patrol and 
the potholes filled. 
We used to have such bright pros-
pects. When Joe Biden and the Demo-
crats took power, the economy was re-
covering. We were energy independent. 
And there was a plan to protect our 
supply chains. Now, instead of planning 
for the future, local leaders are work-
ing overtime just to keep their budgets 
from imploding. 
Just a few short years ago, these 
same Tennessee leaders were focused 
on innovation and growth. Now, they 
are focused on survival. They know 
that the only way we will pull this 
country back on track is to halt infla-
tionary 
spending, 
prioritize 
supply 
chains, and ramp up an Operation Warp 
Speed for energy independence. 
But Joe Biden has taken us back-
wards. So, yes, the people are fearful of 
what this administration will do next. 
But they continue to say they will not 
be frightened into submission. 
I would urge my Democratic col-
leagues to remember that. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF NINA NIN-YUEN WANG 
Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I 
wanted to share a few words about 
Nina Wang, President Biden’s nominee 
for the U.S. District Court for the Dis-
trict of Colorado. 
Judge Wang comes to this floor with 
a commitment to the law rooted in her 
earliest moments as a child, her ear-
liest memories as a child. Nina’s fam-
ily emigrated from Taiwan to Kansas 
City when she was just 2 years old. 
Like my grandparents who emigrated 
from Poland, Nina’s parents had very 
strong accents. They knew English, but 
people in their Kansas suburb couldn’t 
always understand what they were say-
ing. Some of Nina’s first memories 
were ordering pizza for the family or 
speaking to store clerks on behalf of 
her parents. 
Her family applied to become perma-
nent residents, but the INS lost their 
application. Then, once they resolved 
that issue, the law had changed, and 
their pathway to legalization was gone. 
Their family spent years in legal 
limbo, ricocheting from one court to 
another. And if not for an intervention 
by late Senator Robert Dole, Nina’s 
family would have fallen through the 
cracks. 
At the time, Nina made a promise: If 
I can stay in America, I am going to 
give back to America. This experience 
gave Nina firsthand knowledge of the 
legal system’s power to change lives 
because it changed her own. It made 
her cherish America’s legal system, 
where even noncitizens have their day 
in court, and it inspired her to pursue 
a career in law. 
She graduated from Washington Uni-
versity summa cum laude and Phi Beta 
Kappa. She earned a J.D. from Harvard 
Law School and served as editor-in- 
chief of the Civil Rights-Civil Liberties 
Law Review. After graduating, Nina 
worked as an associate at an inter-
national law firm and clerked in the 
U.S. District Court for the District of 
Maryland. 
The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Colo-
rado recognized Nina’s talents and 
hired her as an AUSA in the Civil Divi-
sion, where she managed Federal cases 
ranging from employment discrimina-
tion to bankruptcy, to civil rights. 
Nina then went into the private sec-
tor, where, over the next decade, she 
rose from associate to partner at 
Faegre Drinker, a top firm in Denver. 
In 2015, Nina began serving as a mag-
istrate judge for the U.S. district court 
in Colorado. 
Judge Wang now comes to the com-
mittee and this floor with 25 years of 
legal experience and exposure to vir-
tually every issue that might come be-
fore the court. She also comes with a 
reputation for fairness and impar-
tiality. Her colleagues tell me she 
doesn’t grandstand. She takes the time 
to listen to every litigant, whether 
they have representation or not. 
She has remained committed to the 
American ideal that everyone deserves 
their day in court, just like her par-
ents. And I, for one, am deeply grateful 
that she has devoted her talent to real-
izing that ideal in our legal system. 
Judge Wang is an exceptional nomi-
nee, with unimpeachable character, in-
tellect, and experience. Our colleagues 
on the Judiciary Committee appre-
ciated that about her. That is why they 
sent her to this floor with a strong bi-
partisan vote of 14 to 8. 
I enthusiastically endorse her nomi-
nation and urge my colleagues on both 
sides of the aisle to confirm this out-
standing Colorado nominee for our dis-
trict court. 
I yield the floor.

The motion is agreed to. 
The Senator from Florida. 
CUBA 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
on July 11, 2021, in an act of incredible 
bravery, thousands of freedom-loving 
people in Cuba collectively stood to-
gether to demand freedom from the op-
pressive Cuban dictatorship. 
They stood outside the headquarters 
of the Cuban Communist Party de-
manding liberty. They shouted ‘‘Patria 
y Vida,’’ which means homeland and 
life. 
In cities across the island, Cubans 
young and old showed they are not 
afraid of the regime. It was a sign that 
freedom, liberty, and human rights are 
not merely American ideals but uni-
versal rights given to all by God, not 
any government. 
In response to the peaceful protest, 
the Cuban Communist Party, an ille-
gitimate and brutally oppressive re-
gime 
deployed 
a 
wave 
of 
terror 
throughout Cuba by unleashing its se-
cret police and military forces on 
peaceful 
protesters 
and 
democracy 
leaders. 
The regime’s thugs and security 
forces unlawfully detained more than 
1,400 demonstrators, including leaders 
from Cuban civil society groups such as 
UNPACU, the San Isidro Movement, 
the Ladies in White, and targeted reli-
gious and Afro-Cuban leaders. 
In the aftermath of the demonstra-
tions and the government crackdown, 
crowds of Cubans and supporters of the 
Cuban people gathered here in Wash-
ington urging Joe Biden to act. 
They gathered in front of the White 
House. They protested in front of the 
Cuban Embassy. I heard their cries 
asking the American Government to 
show its support. I joined them in front 
of the White House and in front of the 
Capitol. 
We know Joe Biden has the power to 
join the Cuban people to call for the 
Cuban Communist Party to change. 
But aside from a couple statements he 
made last year, Joe Biden has not 
taken one action to support the Cuban 
people and their fight for freedom. 
He has done nothing to provide them 
with internet connections or to support 
the democracy movement on the is-
land. 
I want to be clear: The President of 
the United States is known both here 
and around the globe as the leader of 
the free world. Our President, regard-
less of who it is, has immense power to 
rally our democratic allies and the 
freedom-loving people of the world to 
put pressure on oppressive regimes like 
the one occupying Havana and throw 
the full support of the global commu-
nity behind the Cuban people’s move-
ment for freedom. 
Anyone who denies this is ignoring 
history. But Joe Biden hasn’t done any 
of that. He hasn’t even tried. Instead, 
he and his administration have bowed 
to the demands of Cuba’s murderous 
Castro and Diaz-Canel regimes and cho-
sen not to stand for democracy and 
human rights. 
And just weeks ago, he chose to prop 
up the oppressive regime with pathetic 
appeasement policies and sanctions re-
lief. These actions bring shame to the 
United States. They do nothing to help 
the people only help line the pockets of 
the regime, its thugs, and its evil part-
ners in Russia, Iran, and communist 
China. 
This failed President has done more 
to unite America’s enemies than bring-
ing together the world’s democracies 
for a common cause. Biden’s appease-
ment is horrible for U.S. national secu-
rity, a threat to stability in Latin 
America, and a danger to the power of 
democracy across the world. 
Six months after the demonstrations 
started, 
the 
Senate 
unanimously 
passed my resolution that supported 
Cuban democracy activists like Jose 
Daniel Ferrer, and condemned the bru-
tal torture, unjust imprisonment, and 
severe oppression that the illegitimate 
communist Cuban regime is subjecting 
innocent Cubans to every day. 
Last week, we honored the 1-year an-
niversary of the action of the brave 
Cuban people, and we remembered the 
horrific images of violence and oppres-
sion we saw as the illegitimate com-
munist Cuban regime, terrified of the 
freedom movement, viciously cracked 
down on the people with mass jailings, 
beatings, and even murder. 
Well, most of us remember. Joe Biden 
could not be bothered to even make a 
statement. His silence on this issue 
shows he doesn’t care about the con-
sequences of his actions. He doesn’t 
care that he is playing into the plans of 
Castro and Diaz-Canel. 
Meanwhile, the Cuban people get 
nothing in return, and the security sit-
uation in the region worsens. When 
Biden doesn’t stand up to Castro and 
Diaz-Canel, we are left with a desta-
bilized hemisphere that is less peaceful 
and puts our homeland security at 
greater risk. 
They are murderous, illegitimate dic-
tators. Appeasement is the worst move 
imaginable. And you better believe 
that Iran, Russia, and communist 
China love it when Biden is nice to 
their friends in Latin America. 
So in the midst of this 1-year anni-
versary of the July 11 historic and 
peaceful demonstrations, I am asking 
Joe Biden to call for the immediate re-
lease of the hundreds of pro-democracy 
activists, including children whom the 
regime is unjustly detaining and sub-
jecting to physical and psychological 
torture. 
I hope someone in the White House is 
paying attention. Unfortunately, we 
know Joe Biden isn’t. Children are 
locked away in jail, kept away from 
their families. These are kids. Some 
are just 14 years old. What is it going 
to take for Joe Biden to grow a back-
bone and do something? 
Now, I am sure the administration 
will say that they have spoken out. 
Sure, we have seen statements and 
tweets, but that is not enough. Where 
is Joe Biden? 
The White House can try to hide be-
hind the words of the State Depart-
ment and claim false leadership, but 
statements 
from 
bureaucrats 
and 
tweets from an embassy that shouldn’t 
even exist will never be enough. 
Sadly, that is all we can expect from 
this weak and incompetent President. 
It is essential to the national security 
of the United States as well as our ef-
forts to support freedom, democracy, 
and human rights that Joe Biden re-

not wrongfully lifted. 
It would also require the President to 
establish a task force to develop long-

Cuban regime. 
As the Cuban people’s fight for free-
dom from the oppressive and illegit-

tinues, the United States must stand

We can never bow to dictators— 
never. It is time for Biden to lead and

TRIBUTE TO KEITH LAWRENCE 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
after more than 50 years as a pillar of 
Owensboro, KY, news media, Keith 
Lawrence is retiring. As the Mes-
senger-Inquirer’s longest tenured re-
porter, Keith was his community’s 
ever-present voice, covering stories 
that ranged from local businesses to 
U.S. Presidents. As the city’s mayor 
put so well, Keith ‘‘will be hard to re-
place.’’ Today, I ask my colleagues to 
join me in honoring Keith in his retire-
ment. 
Keith has written for one newspaper 
or another since September 1963, when 
he first discovered his passion for jour-
nalism in high school. He cut his teeth 
during his undergraduate years at Mur-
ray State University writing for the 
Murray State News. After graduating, 
Keith entered the military, stationing 
in Fort Hood, TX. Loathe to give up 
any opportunity to write, he helped 
publish newsletters on base and worked 
at the post’s newspaper. 
Following his military service and 
some short stints at a series of 
weeklies, Keith and his wife Sandy 
made their way to Owensboro, where 
he began his extensive career at the 
Messenger-Inquirer in 1972. Though he 
has covered local, State, and national 
stories, community journalism always 
remained his top priority. Keith felt he 
needed to be the ‘‘eyes and ears’’ of his 
readers. 
Keith’s journalistic gifts have earned 
him fans both in Owensboro and across 
the wider Commonwealth. He recently 
received the Mayor’s Award for Excel-
lence for his commitment to commu-
nity coverage and joined the Kentucky 
Journalism Hall of Fame. 
Throughout my time in office, Keith 
has been a constant at any of the 
events I held in Owensboro. He asked 
insightful questions, squarely focused 
on how my work in the Senate affected 
his city. 
Though he is taking a step back from 
his position at the Messenger-Inquirer, 
Keith plans to continue his column and 
write news stories as a freelancer. Any-
one who knows Keith shouldn’t be sur-
prised. He will always live and breathe 
community journalism. For Keith, his 
work with the Messenger-Inquirer was 
more than just a job; it gave him a 
home in which his family flourished 
and provided a deep bond to his city. 
In honor of Keith’s retirement, I 
would like to thank him for his service 
to the Commonwealth and persistent 
loyalty to strong local journalism. He 
has delivered an invaluable service to 
Owensboro residents for more than 50 
years. 
The Messenger-Inquirer paid tribute 
to Keith’s career in a recent article. I 
ask unanimous consent that the article 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Messenger-Inquirer, July 8, 2022] 
‘‘LAWRENCE RETIRING AFTER 50 YEARS’’ 
Keith Lawrence, the Messenger-Inquirer’s 
longest-tenured reporter, is retiring after 
more than 50 years with the newspaper. 
Lawrence, 75, is a Ballard County native 
who found a journalism career and home in 
Owensboro. 
He joined the staff in January 1972. Since 
then, he’s covered everything from mom- 
and-pop businesses to U.S. presidents. 
According to Lawrence, being a journalist 
is all he ever wanted to do since discovering 
it in high school. 
‘‘When I was a freshman, my English 
teacher asked us to write poetry . . . and 
whatever I wrote she took across the hall to 
the journalism teacher and asked her to run 
it in the (school) newspaper—and they did,’’ 
Lawrence said. ‘‘She told me I should take 
journalism next year. I didn’t think I could 
do any of that stuff, but I did it and fell in 
love with it. 
‘‘I’ve been writing for some kind of news-
paper since September 1963.’’ 
While in that journalism class, he met his 
wife, Sandy, whom he married a year after 
graduating from high school. 
Sandy Lawrence said it was journalism 
that brought her husband out of his shell. 
‘‘Keith is really a shy person,’’ she said. 
‘‘But it was being a reporter that allowed 
him to talk to anyone.’’ 
Lawrence pursued his newfound passion at 
Murray State University, where he would 
write for the Murray State News and eventu-
ally earn his bachelor’s degree in journalism 
and master’s degree in communications. 
In February 1970, Lawrence received his 
draft notice for the Vietnam War, but he was 
allowed to graduate from college before en-
tering the military. 
Lawrence was sent to Fort Hood, Texas, 
where he furthered his journalism talents by 
working on the post’s newspaper. 
Although he did spend time writing news-
letters, Lawrence said he took on heavier 
stories that would help him later in civilian 
life. 
‘‘We did a lot of things that weren’t fluff 
pieces,’’ he said. ‘‘We investigated off-post 
housing. People would buy up an old army 
barracks and turn it into eight apartments. 
These were World War II army barracks, and 
people 
were 
being 
charged 
outrageous 
rents.’’ 
Lawrence was honorably discharged after 
less than two years and began looking for a 
journalism job. 
His first attempt was working for a start- 
up 
shopper—a 
free 
weekly 
community 
paper—in Erin, Tennessee. 
‘‘It lasted about two months and we quit,’’ 
Lawrence said. ‘‘We were working about 80 
hours a week. We were salary and didn’t get 
any overtime.’’ 
That’s when Lawrence reached out to Mur-
ray to see if anyone there was aware of any 
newspaper openings. 
Lawrence said there was a weekly in Ben-
ton and a daily in Owensboro that were hir-
ing. 
‘‘I had enough of weekly newspapers so I 
applied up here,’’ he said. 
Prior to his starting at the Messenger-In-
quirer on Jan. 24, 1972, Lawrence had only 
made two brief visits to Owensboro—once in 
high school and during a plane layover from 
basic training. 
And when he and his wife, Sandy, moved to 
the city, Lawrence said he didn’t think it 
would be permanent. 
‘‘I thought two years and I’d go look for 
something else,’’ he said. 
Five decades later, Lawrence has written 
countless 
stories 
and 
planted 
roots 
in 
Owensboro. The Lawrences have one son— 
Christopher—who’s a writer for the Las 
Vegas Review-Journal. 
In his time with the Messenger-Inquirer, 
Lawrence not only covered local and state 
stories but also national ones. 
Among them were the 1988 Republican and 
Democratic conventions and the first inau-
guration of U.S. President Bill Clinton in 
1993. He also spent a week with U.S. Sen. 
Wendell Ford in Washington, D.C., before he 
retired. 
But for Lawrence, it has been community 
journalism that mattered most; knowing he 
was supposed to be the ‘‘eyes and ears’’ of 
the readers was something he took seriously. 
‘‘I always wanted to know why somebody 
was the way they were,’’ he said. 
On Thursday, Mayor Tom Watson pre-
sented the Mayor’s Award for Excellence to 
Lawrence in appreciation for his coverage of 
community issues. 
‘‘He always treated the city and all of us 
fair,’’ Watson said. ‘‘. . . Keith will be hard 
to replace. The stories he tells are accurate, 
and you don’t have to worry about him edi-
torializing your comments.’’ 
It was last year that Lawrence’s dedication 
to his craft was recognized by his being in-
ducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of 
Fame. 
For Lawrence, it was an accolade that 
capped off his career. 
‘‘It’s definitely the pinnacle,’’ he said. 
As a journalist, Lawrence has a unique 
writing style that is concise but still man-
ages to convey all the pertinent information, 
said Matt Francis, Messenger-Inquirer exec-
utive editor. 
He also has a work ethic that is un-
matched, having never taken a sick day in 
50-plus years at the paper, and the ability to 
cover multiple areas from business to gov-
ernment to entertainment, Francis said. 
‘‘But what truly sets Keith apart is his 
ability to keenly understand this community 
and the readers of this newspaper,’’ Francis 
said. ‘‘They feel a connection with him, as he 
does with them, and I think he always under-
stood what a privilege it is to be a part of in-
forming 
and 
entertaining 
a 
community

through journalism. He never took that for 
granted, and I think readers recognize and 
appreciate that. I know I certainly do.’’ 
Mike 
Weafer, 
Messenger-Inquirer 
pub-
lisher, said Lawrence will be missed by both 
the newspaper and its readers. 
‘‘It’s not very often that you get to use 
words like ‘hall of fame’ and ‘icon’ when you 
are describing someone, but you would not 
describe Keith’s work at the Messenger-In-
quirer without using them,’’ Weafer said. 
‘‘Keith has meant so much to us and to this 
community.’’ 
Although Lawrence is retiring from his 
full-time position at the newspaper, he will 
continue his column and write news stories 
as a freelancer. 
And along with being proud of being affili-
ated with the newspaper, Lawrence said it’s 
been 
special 
watching 
Owensboro 
and 
Daviess County blossom as a community. 
When he first moved here, Lawrence said 
the Frederica Street sassafras tree, known as 
the largest in the world, was the biggest at-
traction. 
But with the riverfront revitalization, the 
growth on Kentucky 54 and destinations such 
as the Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame & Mu-
seum, Lawrence said there’s no place else 
he’d rather be. 
‘‘Owensboro has come a long way; people 
who can’t find something to do in Owensboro 
aren’t looking very hard,’’ he said. ‘‘But 
through the years, I’ve found out that 
Owensboro is whatever you want it to be.’’

Rocket 
(LCRRPR) pods; ruggedized laptops; training 
equipment; publications for HIMARS and 
munitions/missiles; and other related ele-
ments of program and logistic support. The 
total estimated cost is $500 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security of the United 
States by improving the security of a NATO 
ally that continues to be an important force 
for political stability and economic progress 
in Europe. This sale is consistent with U.S. 
initiatives to provide key allies in the region 
with modern systems that will enhance 
interoperability with U.S. forces and in-
crease security. 
The proposed sale will contribute to Esto-
nia’s military goals of updating capability 
while 
further 
enhancing 
interoperability 
with the United States and other allies. Es-
tonia intends to use these defense articles 
and services to modernize its armed forces 
and expand its capability to strengthen its 
homeland defense and deter regional threats. 
Estonia will have no difficulty absorbing this 
equipment into its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be Lockheed 
Martin, Grand Prairie, TX. There are no 
known offset agreements proposed in connec-
tion with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale may 
require the assignment of approximately fif-
teen (15) U.S. Government representatives 
and up to fifteen (15) contractor representa-
tives to Estonia at any given time, during 
the delivery, training, integration, and test-
ing of the HIMARS capability. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale. 
TRANSMITTAL NO. 22–35 
Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of 
Offer Pursuant to Section 36(b)(1) of the 
Arms Export Control Act, as amended 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology 
1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket 
System (HIMARS) is a C–130 transportable 
wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton Family 
of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. 
HIMARS is the modern Army-fielded version 
of the M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System 
(MLRS) launcher, and can fire all of the 
MLRS Family of Munitions/Missiles (FOM) 
that includes Guided Multiple Launch Rock-
et 
System 
(GMLRS), 
Extended 
Range 
GMLRS, and the Army Tactical Missile Sys-
tem (ATACMS). Utilizing the FOM, the 
HIMARS can engage targets between 15 and 
300 kilometers with Global Positioning Sys-
tem/Precise Positioning Service (GPS/PPS)- 
aided precision accuracy. 
2. The GMLRS M31A2 Unitary is the 
Army’s primary munition for units fielding 
the 
M142 
HIMARS 
and 
M270Al 
MLRS 
Launchers. The M31A2 Unitary is a solid pro-
pellant artillery rocket that uses GPS/PPS- 
aided inertial guidance to accurately and 
quickly deliver a single high-explosive blast 
fragmentation warhead to targets at ranges 
from 15–70 kilometers. The rockets are fired 
from a launch pod container that also serves 
as the storage and transportation container 
for the rockets. Each rocket pod holds six (6) 
total rockets. 
3. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead 
(AW) shares a greater than 90% commonality 
with the M31A1/A2 Unitary. The primary dif-
ference between the GMLRS Unitary and 
GMLRS AW is the replacement of the Uni-
tary high explosive warhead with a 200– 
pound fragmentation warhead of pre-formed 
tungsten penetrators which is optimized for 
effectiveness against a large area and impre-
cisely located targets. The munitions other-
wise share a common motor, GPS/PPS-aided 
inertial guidance and control system, a

multi-option fuzing height of burst capa-
bility, and effective range of 15–70 km. 
4. The M57 ATACMS Unitary is a conven-
tional, semi-ballistic missile that utilizes a 
500-pound high explosive warhead. It has an 
effective range of between 70 and 300 kilo-
meters, and has increased lethality and accu-
racy over previous versions of the ATACMS 
due to a GPS/ PPS aided navigation system. 
5. The ER GMLRS missiles provide a per-
sistent, responsive, all-weather, rapidly de-
ployed, long range, surface-to-surface, area- 
and point-precision strike capability. The 
XM403 AW, like GMLRS M30A1/A2, carries a 
200-pound 
fragmentation 
assembly 
filled 
with high explosives which, upon detonation, 
accelerates 
two 
layers 
of 
preformed 
penetrators 
optimized 
for 
effectiveness 
against large area and imprecisely located 
targets. The XM404 Unitary, like GMLRS 
M31A1/A2, has a 200-pound class unitary with 
a steel blast-fragmentation case, designed 
for low collateral damage against point tar-
gets. Both variants of the ER GMLRS mis-
siles maintain the accuracy and effective-
ness demonstrated by the baseline GMLRS 
out to a maximum range of 150 km (double 
that of the GMLRS capability) while also in-
cluding a new HOB capability referred to as 
the Side Mounted Proximity Sensor (SMPS) 
HOB capability. 
6. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
7. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
8. A determination has been made that Es-
tonia can provide substantially the same de-
gree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This sale is necessary in furtherance 
of the U.S. foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives outlined in the Policy Jus-
tification. 
9. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Government of Esto-
nia.

(ii) Sec. 36(b)(1), AECA Transmittal No.: 
19–48; Date: July 29, 2019; Military Depart-
ment: Air Force. 
(iii) Description: On July 29, 2019, Congress 
was notified by Congressional certification 
transmittal number 19–48, of the possible 
sale, under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Ex-
port Control Act, of items and services for 
follow-on support to the RQ–4 Block 30 Re-
motely Piloted Aircraft (RPA) program. In-
cluded were Contractor Logistics Support 
(CLS); program management; training for

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
Korea—MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes 
The Republic of Korea (ROK) requests to 
buy thirty-one (31) MK 54 All Up Round 
Lightweight Torpedoes. Also included is Re-
coverable 
Exercise 
Torpedo 
(REXTORP); 
Storage and Issue (S&I) facility; air launch 
accessories for rotary wing; classified and 
unclassified torpedo spare parts; torpedo 
containers; torpedo support equipment to in-
clude test equipment and tools; torpedo sup-
port services; classified and unclassified 
books and other publications; other tech-
nical assistance to include technical support, 
technical program management, infrastruc-
ture support, test equipment sustainment, 
exercise firing assistance, contract manage-
ment, and initial Follow-on-Technical Sup-
port (FOTS); return and repair support; tor-
pedo training; and other related elements of 
logistical and program support. The esti-
mated total program cost is $130 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy goals and national security objectives 
of the United States by improving the secu-
rity of a major ally that is a force for polit-
ical stability and economic progress in the 
Indo-Pacific region. 
The proposed sale will improve the ROK’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by defending its homeland and U.S. 
personnel stationed there. The ROK will 
have no difficulty absorbing this equipment 
into its armed forces. Korea intends to uti-
lize the MK 54 Lightweight Torpedoes on 
their MH–60R aircraft. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be deter-
mined upon contract award. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to the Republic of Korea; however, U.S. 
Government 
Engineering 
and 
Technical 
Services may be required on an interim basis 
for training and technical assistance. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

Annex Item No. vii 
(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The MK 54 Torpedo is a conventional 
torpedo that can be launched from surface 
ships, rotary and fixed wing aircrafts. The 
MK 54 is an upgrade to the MK 46 Torpedo. 
The upgrade to the MK 54 entails replace-
ment of the torpedo’s sonar and guidance 
and control systems with modem tech-
nology. The new guidance and control sys-
tem uses a mixture of commercial-off-the- 
shelf and custom-built electronics. The war-
head, fuel tank and propulsion system from 
the MK 46 torpedo are re-used in the MK 54 
configuration with minor modifications. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the hardware 
and software elements, the information 
could be used to develop countermeasures or 
equivalent systems which might reduce sys-
tem effectiveness or be used in the develop-
ment of a system with similar or advanced 
capabilities. 
4. A determination has been made that the 
Republic of Korea can provide substantially 
the same degree of protection for the sen-
sitive technology being released as the U.S. 
Government. This sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification. 
5. All defense articles and services listed in 
this transmittal have been authorized for re-
lease and export to the Republic of Korea.

(vii) Sensitivity of Technology: 
1. The AIM–120C–8 and D-series Advanced 
Medium 
Range 
Air-to-Air 
Missiles 
(AMRAAM) are supersonic, air-launched, 
aerial intercept, guided missiles featuring 
digital 
technology 
and 
micro-miniature 
solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabili-
ties include look-down/shoot-down, multiple 
launches against multiple targets, resistance 
to electronic countermeasures, and intercep-
tion of high- and low-flying and maneuvering 
targets. State-of-the-art technology is used 
in the missile to provide it with beyond-vis-
ual-range capability. 
a. The increase in capability from the 
AIM–120C–8 to AIM–120D consists of a two- 
way data link, a more accurate navigation 
unit with Global Positioning System (GPS) 
updates, improved high-off boresight (HOBS) 
capability, and enhanced aircraft-to-missile 
position handoff. 
b. The AIM–120D features a quadrangle tar-
get detection device and an electronics unit 
within the guidance section that performs 
all radar signal processing, mid-course and 
terminal guidance, flight control, target de-
tection, and warhead detonation. The AIM– 
120D–3 is a form, fit, function refresh of the 
AIM–120D and is the next generation to be 
produced. 
c. The potential sale will include Captive 
Air 
Training 
Missiles 
(CATMs) 
and 
AMRAAM Guidance Section spares. It is the 
AMRAAM’s advanced guidance section and 
mature seeker design that allow it to find 
targets quickly in the most challenging en-
vironments. 
2. The highest level of classification of de-
fense articles, components, and services in-
cluded in this potential sale is SECRET. 
3. If a technologically advanced adversary 
were to obtain knowledge of the specific 
hardware and software elements, the infor-
mation could be used to develop counter-
measures that might reduce weapon system 
effectiveness or be used in the development 
of a system with similar or advanced capa-
bilities. 
4. A determination has been made that 
Norway can provide substantially the same 
degree of protection for the sensitive tech-
nology being released as the U.S. Govern-
ment. This proposed sale is necessary in fur-
therance of the U.S. foreign policy and na-
tional security objectives outlined in the 
Policy Justification.

AFGHANISTAN 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, fol-
lowing my submission yesterday, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD the next part of an inves-
tigation directed by the U.S. Central 
Command concerning the Abbey Gate 
bombing in Afghanistan in August 2021. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
ACTS–SCK–DO 
SUBJECT: Findings and Recommendation— 
Attack Against U.S. Forces Conducting 
NEO at Hamid Karzai International Air-
port on 26 August 2021 
(e) Abbey Gate was structured from North 
to South, with the inner Abbey Gate at the 
north end opening to the actual airfield. 
There was a 265-meter corridor between the 
inner gate and the outer gate, to the south, 
known as the inner corridor. This area 
served as a sally port for searching and proc-
essing vehicles. Two lanes divided by jersey 
barriers were beyond the outer gate. The 
egress lane from the Barron Hotel, which 
joined the gate road from the southeast, was 
approximately 120 meters south of the outer 
gate. The Chevron obstacle was approxi-
mately 155 meters south of the outer gate. 
The area between the outer gate and the 
Chevron was known as the outer corridor. A 
sewage canal ran generally east to west par-
allel to the inner and outer corridors, on the 
east side of the perimeter wall and fence. 
During operations of Abbey Gate, 2/1 estab-
lished a holding area in the outer corridor 
lanes, a search and DoS processing location 
in the inner corridor, and security/crowd 
control positions at the canal and Chevron. 
Additionally, the sniper section established

an overwatch position in the tower at the 
outer 
gate. 
Marines 
escorted 
evacuees 
through a break in the canal fence or around 
the Chevron, and ushered them into the 
outer corridor holding area for an initial 
search. Outside the Chevron, the Taliban 
conducted crowd control and initial screen-
ing. U.K. Forces processed their evacuees at 
the Barron Hotel and drove them through 
the outer corridor lanes, through the Abbey 
Gate, to the airfield (see all exhibits from 
2/1 Marines, Echo Company, Golf Company, 
and enclosure 11–13). Companies rotated re-
sponsibility for gate operations, with Golf 
Company initially taking the canal security 
positions, Fox Company taking the Chevron 
area, and dividing the inner gate search and 
escort duties (exhibits 53, 76, 77, 79, 81, 89). 
Echo Company rotated into gate operations 
later in the NEO to enable a rest cycle for all 
companies (exhibits 53, 56, 76). 
(f) Between 20 and 25 August, gate oper-
ations took on a structured and predictable 
battle rhythm. Crowds were desperate but 
manageable, able to be kept calm at Abbey 
Gate because Marines interacted with the 
people continuously and used the PSYOP ca-
pability to communicate (exhibits 57, 79, 80, 
83, 85, 88). Early in the NEO, crowds at Abbey 
Gate numbered around 1500 between the 
canal and the Chevron entrance, and another 
500–1000 in the outer gate holding area. There 
was a concern throughout 2/1 that the crowds 
could riot and force the gate open at any 
time {exhibits 57, 83). The JTF–CR J2 de-
scribed the crowd as the greatest threat to 
mission, because at any time they could 
have forced their way past Marines and onto 
the airfield, stopping air operations, and ul-
timately the evacuation (exhibit 15). Several 
factors undermined the Marines’ and U.K. 
Forces’ efforts to keep the crowds calm. 
(i) The Taliban used excessive force outside 
the Chevron, which created the incentive for 
civilians to avoid the main road entrance 
and move to Abbey Gate via the canal (ex-
hibits 53, 77, 79, 80). Over time, the canal be-
came extremely crowded and people were 
being crushed and injured (exhibits 53, 77, 79, 
80, 214, 220). 
(ii) DoS Consular officers provided incon-
sistent support at Abbey Gate, and the re-
quired 
documentation 
for 
evacuation 
changed hourly (exhibits 53, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 
85, 88). Marines often had to halt gate proc-
essing and flow, because the Consular offi-
cers were not present to screen and approve 
evacuees for movement to the PAX Terminal 
(exhibits 53, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 85, 88). It is pos-
sible Consular officers were absent from the 
gate because of threat reporting and to bet-
ter meter the flow of evacuees and not 
overcrowd the airfield (exhibit 146). However, 
the crowd would eventually notice the halt 
in processing and become highly agitated 
(exhibits 53, 77, 79, 80, 81, 83, 85, 88). 
(iii) Partner nation representatives/forces 
consistently conducted uncoordinated evac-
uee extractions at Abbey Gate. Partner na-
tion forces frequently left potential evacuees 
unsecured within 2/1 Marines’ perimeter, or 
relied upon Marines to escort their rejected 
evacuees back to the canal (exhibits 53, 77, 
83, 88). Partner nation representatives/forces 
often pulled out large groups of people, usu-
ally families (exhibits 53, 77, 83, 88). The 
crowd would see the disparate treatment of 
select personnel and become agitated (exhib-
its 53, 77, 83, 88). 
(g) Threat reporting during the NEO was 
continuous and generally non-specific. The 
USFOR–A FWD and JTF–CR staffs estimated 
the threat streams to be credible reports 
during the 10-day NEO (exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21). 
The threats varied from VBIED attacks and 
Suicide Vest Improvised Explosive Devices 
(SVIEDs) against gates, to bags in the 
crowds or aircraft hijackings with evacuees 
concealing bombs and weapons on flights 
(exhibits 13, 15, 18, 21, 102, 115). 2/1 Marines 
believed their only means to counter these 
threats, without degrading the mission, was 
to increase overwatch and actively search 
for civilians meeting the descriptions pro-
vided (exhibits 15, 53, 56, 57, 77, 80). 2/1 Ma-
rines attempted to balance the need to con-
tinue to interact with the crowd to pull po-
tential evacuees into the outer gate and in-
crease force protection (exhibits 53, 56, 77). 
On several occasions, both prior to and 
throughout 26 August, 2/1 Marines providing 
security along the canal pulled back from 
the crowd, took a knee behind jersey bar-
riers, and stopped the flow of processing 
based on reports indicating specific times of 
attack (exhibits 53, 77, 89). 
(h) By 25 August, Abbey Gate was the Main 
Effort for Gate Operations at HKIA. The ter-
rain and infrastructure at East and North 
Gates, coupled with threats to force and 
large, unruly crowds, made these gates un-
tenable for evacuation operations (exhibits 
15, 18, 100, 102, 104). Both gates were effec-
tively closed between 20–25 August (exhibits 
15, 18, 100, 102, 104). The West and South 
Gates were still operational, but both were 
used for coordinated arrivals and openings 
(exhibits 125, 126). The decreased access to 
evacuation processing points at HKIA forced 
DoS and partner nations to direct most 
small groups and individual evacuees to 
Abbey Gate (exhibit 15, 125, 126, 127, 146). The 
canal at Abbey Gate facilitated crowd con-
trol and provided some standoff, and the 
Chevron minimized the VBIED threat (exhib-
its 53, 56, 76, 77, 83, 84). There were effective 
overwatch 
positions, 
and 
the 
Taliban 
screened the main approach (exhibits 53, 56, 
76, 77, 83, 84). Over time, crowds bypassed 
Taliban checkpoints to get to the canal and 
seek access to HKIA (exhibits 77–88). 
(i) On 25 August, the crowd in the canal 
outside Abbey Gate was noticeably larger 
than the days prior, numbering around 2000– 
3000 (exhibits 53, 55, 77, 80). In addition to the 
Taliban activity at the Chevron, Marines at-
tributed this swell in civilians at the canal 
to the closure of many of the other gates at 
HKIA and the impending withdrawal date of 
31 August (exhibits 53, 55, 77, 80). The 2 PARA 
Commander observed the efficiency and ac-
cessibility of Abbey Gate had become pub-
licly known, drawing more people (exhibit 
127). The crowd was also noticeably more 
desperate (exhibits 53, 55, 77, 80). Echo Com-
pany operated the gate during the day on 25 
August, and conducted a RIP at 1600 with 
Golf Company (exhibits 56, 77). During Echo 
Company’s time on the gate, they pushed the 
crowd back from the sniper tower and jersey 
barriers on the nearside of the canal to cre-
ate standoff (exhibit 56). With the assistance 
of U.K. Forces, Echo Company pushed the 
crowds 150-meters down the nearside of the 
canal, and Marines maintained control of the 
terrain between the jersey barriers and 
newly established perimeter (exhibits 56, 59, 
60, 61). After conducting his RIP, (TEXT RE-
DACTED) 
Golf 
Company 
(TEXT 
RE-
DACTED) was concerned the Marines and 
U.K. Forces were overextended based on re-
cent threat reporting, and decided to col-
lapse the position back to the base of the 
sniper tower at the outer gate (exhibit 77). 
(j) During the evening of 25 August and 
into the morning of 26 August, the crowds in 
the canal continued to grow and became in-
creasingly desperate (exhibits 53, 77, 80, 89). 
Threat reporting on 25 and 26 August indi-
cated Islamic State of Iraq and Syria- 
Khorasan (ISIS–K) would execute an attack 
at a gate using a SVIED (exhibits 13, 15, 76, 
77). Nearly every Marine interviewed in 2/1 
was aware of the reported threat, but did not 
find the information to be out of the ordi-
nary compared to other earlier threats (ex-
hibits 57, 59, 60, 61, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 83, 84, 85, 
86, 86, 89). Many noted the information was 
more specific, but changed regularly (dif-
ferent bags and descriptions of the bomber) 
(exhibit 88). At approximately 2330 on 25 Au-
gust, after collapsing the nearside canal se-
curity down to the sniper tower, (TEXT RE-
DACTED) had all Marines take a knee and 
reduce their posture behind the canal wall 
and jersey barriers. This lasted until day-
light on 26 August (exhibits 77, 88). (TEXT 
REDACTED) had the unit take the same 
force posture at approximately 1400 for 30 
minutes, based on additional threat report-
ing (exhibits 77, 88, 89). After the brief stand- 
down, 2/1 Marines continued to process evac-
uees, having what some considered to be 
their most productive day on 26 August (ex-
hibit 80). 
(k) Throughout the evening of 25 August, 
into the morning of 26 August, units pre-
pared for the planned closure of Abbey Gate 
to enable the JTE of Marine forces (exhibits 
15, 18, 53, 56, 57, 76, 77). The U.K. Forces were 
unable to meet the planned closure time of 
1800 on 25 August, and subsequently were un-
able to meet the new time of 0700 on 26 Au-
gust (exhibits 15, 18, 53, 56, 76, 77). During the 
afternoon of 25 August, the U.K. PARA units 
operating from the Barron Hotel had near1y 
1000 evacuees to process (exhibit 127). The 2 
PARA Commander on the ground received 
two timelines for completion of evacuation 
operations, with the initial completion date 
of 25 August and the adjusted timeline of pe-
riod of darkness 27 August (exhibit 127). The 
U.K. met this second completion time (ex-
hibits 124, 127). A higher authority within the 
U.K. Forces, not present at HKIA, was re-
sponsible for the change in the timeline, not 
the 2 PARA Commander (exhibit 127). 
(l) On 26 August, at approximately 1600, 
Golf Company rotated the platoons on the 
line an hour early due to 4th Platoon grow-
ing fatigued, and 1st Platoon took over canal 
security (exhibits 77, 89). Most of Golf Com-
pany worked the outer gate because the 
crowds were growing desperate (exhibit 77). 
People were being crushed and injured at the 
jersey barriers at the base of the sniper 
tower (exhibits 77, 83, 88, 89). Echo Company 
was working the inner gate, as of 1200–1300, 
to provide additional manpower at the gate 
area and prepare for the closing of Abbey 
Gate that night (exhibits 56, 77). (TEXT RE-
DACTED) was concerned with the threat re-
porting and ordered all 1stSgts and Corps-
men to remain in the inner corridor area for 
force protection (exhibit 77). However, some 
corpsmen were called forward because of 
heat and trauma injuries suffered by civil-
ians in the crowd (exhibits 77, 92). At ap-
proximately 1600, (TEXT REDACTED) at-
tended a meeting with (TEXT REDACTED) 2/ 
501 PIR (TEXT REDACTED) the 2 PARA 
(TEXT REDACTED) and the Taliban to dis-
cuss U.K. passage of lines from Barron Hotel, 
handover of security of the outer gate to the 
Taliban, and responsibility of the inner gate 
transitioning to 2/501 PIR (exhibits 53, 77). At 
approximately 1700, BGen Sullivan visited 
Abbey 
Gate 
and 
discussed 
the 
closure 
timeline with (TEXT REDACTED) exhibits 
15, 17, 18, 53, 77). BGen Sullivan departed at 
approximately 1715 (exhibits 15, 17, 18). At 
approximately 1725, (TEXT REDACTED) 24th 
MEU (TEXT REDACTED) convinced an Af-
ghan civilian to speak to the crowd through 
a non-standard loud speaker for 10 minutes 
(exhibit 105). The messaging pleaded with the 
crowed to stop pushing, and stated that 
women and children were being crushed to 
death (exhibit 105). Three snipers from the 
2/1 Marines Sniper section, attached to Echo 
Company, but in direct support of units at 
Abbey Gate, were in the tower at the outer 
gate (exhibit 62). The snipers in the tower 
were (TEXT REDACTED) was at the base of

the tower near the fence (exhibits 62, 63). 
They were well aware of the reported threats 
and scanned the large and unruly crowd in 
the canal for individuals ‘‘out of baseline’’ or 
demonstrating hostile intent (exhibit 62). 
(m) At approximately 1730 on 26 August, 
the crowds at Abbey Gate were desperate and 
growing agitated (exhibits 76, 77, 80, 84, 89). 
First Platoon, Golf Company, led by (TEXT 
REDACTED) were consolidated at the jersey 
barriers beneath the tower at the outer gate 
(exhibits 77, 88, 89, 91, 92). The platoon was 
forced to move nearly all personnel into the 
corner to hold back the massive and largely 
recalcitrant crowd from coming over the 
barriers and breaching the gate (exhibits 89, 
91). Three members of the FST, Sgt Nicole 
Gee, Sgt Johanny Rosario Pichardo, and 
(TEXT REDACTED) were operating slightly 
behind the platoon (exhibits 89, 91, 92, 106, 
107). (TEXT REDACTED) 2/1’s (TEXT RE-
DACTED) were standing to the North of the 
PSYOP vehicle in the outer corridor (exhib-
its 53, 76). (TEXT REDACTED) was near the 
canal, approximately 30–40 meters from the 
sniper tower (exhibits 77, 89, 92). Several 
members of Echo Company were in the outer 
corridor area, escorting civilians or looking 
for specific potential evacuees (exhibits 61, 
62, 63). SSgt Darin Hoover was near the fence 
at the base of the outer gate tower (exhibit 
63). (TEXT REDACTED) was escorting an in-
terpreter to the canal to look for his father 
in the crowd (exhibit 63). Two corpsmen were 
also in the outer corridor. HM3 Maxton 
Soviak was called forward to treat a civilian 
heat causality and was rendering aid near 
the canal, but up against the fence (exhibit 
92). (TEXT REDACTED) came forward from 
the inner gate to bring water to the 1st Pla-
toon Marines on the canal wall (exhibit 92). 
At approximately 1736 local time, 26 August 
2021, a single explosion occurred at Abbey 
Gate (exhibits 66, 98, 72, 121, 236). Overhead 
persistent infrared systems captured the 
time of the explosion at precisely 13:06:52Z, 
or 17:36:52 local (exhibit 236). The STP OIC 
received notification of the attack from 2/1 
Marines by radio at 1738, and used the Signal 
Application to warn the North HKIA Role II– 
E of potential casualties at 1739 (exhibit 66, 
98). 
(n) The blast at Abbey Gate killed thirteen 
Service Members total, to include eleven Ma-
rines, one Sailor, and one Soldier: 
(i) SSgt Darin Hoover, USMC, Echo Com-
pany 2/1 Marines 
(ii) Sgt Nicole Gee, USMC, CLB–24, 24th 
MEU 
(iii) Sgt Johanny Rosario Pichardo, USMC,

pany, 2/1 Marines 
(v) Cpl Daegan Page, USMC, Golf Com-
pany, 2/1 Marines

(ix) LCpl Dylan Merola, USMC, Golf Com-
pany, 2/1 Marines 
(x) LCpl Kareem Nikoui, USMC, Golf Com-
pany, 2/1 Marines 
(xi) LCpl Jared Schmitz, USMC, Golf Com-
pany, 2/1 Marines 
(xii) HM3 Maxton Soviak, USN, Golf Com-
pany, 2/1 Marines 
(xiii) SSG Ryan Knauss, USA, Bravo Com-
pany, 9th Psychological Operations Bat-
talion (A) 
(o) Those killed in action were all located 
in vicinity of the tower at the outer gate 
standing a security position at the edge of 
the canal or jersey barriers, with the excep-
tion of SSG Knauss and SSgt Hoover (exhib-
its 63, 91, 92, 105, 129). Three of the 1st Pla-
toon Marines who were killed in the blast 
were elevated on the canal wall, helping pull 
potential evacuees into the outer gate: LCpl 
Rylee McCollum, LCpl Dylan Merola, and 
LCpl Kareem Nikoui. SSgt Hoover was in the 
outer corridor area, on the inside of the 
fence, near the tower (exhibits 63, 91, 92). 
SSG Knauss was in the outer corridor area 
with the PSYOP vehicle, on the passenger’s 
side, to the rear of the vehicle (exhibits 105, 
129). The vehicle front was pointed at the jer-
sey barrier and canal intersection below the 
tower where 1st Platoon was providing crowd 
control and security. Autopsy summaries 
provided by the Armed Forces Medical Ex-
aminer’s Office confirmed all Service Mem-
bers who were KIA died of blast and ballistic 
injuries (exhibit 145). There were no gunshot 
wounds on any of the KIA, but significant 
penetrating ball bearing injuries (exhibit 
145). Injuries sustained to those KIA were 
primarily lacerations, ruptures, and bruising 
to the head, torso, and pelvis (exhibits 138, 
145). Of the protective gear examined by 
Joint Trauma Analysis and Prevention of In-
jury in Combat (JTAPIC), small arms protec-
tive insert (SAPI) plates and helmets were 
effective at stopping fragmentation and ball 
bearings (exhibit 138). 
(p) Those interviewed during the investiga-
tion could not provide a number of civilian 
casualties caused by the attack. Most were 
only aware of open source reporting and con-
curred the number would be substantial. 
Open source reporting estimates casualties 
at 160–170 (exhibits 251, 252). 
(q) Numerous Marines were wounded be-
cause of the attack, with most being part of 
1st Platoon, Golf Company or members of 
2/1 Marines positioned in the canal or in the 
outer corridor area, near the physical gate 
and PSYOP vehicle (exhibits 63, 91, 92, 105, 
129, 224). The initial list of wounded is best 
captured by the 2/1 S2 blast and injury anal-
ysis, sketches from Echo and Golf Company 
NCOs, and Aeromedical Evacuation Critical

flight data (exhibits 92, 137, 236). There ap-
pear to be 27 service members reported as 
initially wounded during the attack, but 
eight were not medically evacuated and in-
stead redeployed with the unit (exhibits 68, 
92, 93, 95, 131). The remaining nineteen were 
redeployed due to their wounds (exhibit 68). 
However, since redeploying, units have re-
ported additional TBI and concussion related 
wounds for 12 more Marines, for a total of 39 
Service Members wounded in the attack (ex-
hibits 68, 92, 93, 95, 164). This new number 
does not include members of the 82nd Air-
borne who were conducting a leader’s recon 
at Abbey Gate for the RIP, and 24th MEU 
personnel, who were also in the outer cor-
ridor area (exhibits 107, 124, 129). The number 
of wounded from the attack at Abbey Gate 
will almost certainly continue to grow.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING ENTERTAINMENT 
FORT SMITH 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. President, I rise 
today to recognize and thank the cre-
ators and staff at Entertainment Fort 
Smith magazine for 22 years of cham-
pioning arts, entertainment, and the 
people of western Arkansas. 
Lynn Wasson and Linda Seubold 
launched Entertainment Fort Smith, 
more commonly referred to as E-Fort 
Smith, in 2000 to showcase the area’s 
vibrant arts and entertainment scene 
and keep local residents informed 
about upcoming events. Within its 
pages, they covered everything from 
international mural art found through 
the Unexpected Project and the annual 
Peacemaker Music Festival, to the 
Fort Smith Little Theatre’s latest pro-
ductions and story-time schedules for 
the local library. 
The magazine printed 30,000 issues 
every month that were distributed at 
over 200 locations in Fort Smith, Van 
Buren, 
Greenwood, 
Alma, 
Barling, 
Charleston, and throughout the region. 
Not only was E-Fort Smith a cal-
endar of events, but the magazine’s fea-
tures also spotlighted the lives of local 
people that make western Arkansas 
unique. 
In 
addition, 
Wasson 
and 
Seubold used their platform to show 
their great love for the State of Arkan-
sas. 
Brandon Chase Goldsmith, executive 
director of the Fort Smith Inter-
national Film Festival, praised E-Fort 
Smith for its support and for being a 
driving force behind the region’s cre-
ative economy over the years. Like-
wise, the magazine has been recognized 
as a critical partner in helping secure 
Fort Smith as the site for the U.S. 
Marshals Museum, which will honor 
the over 230-year history of the Mar-
shals Service and is expected to open in 
2023. 
E-Fort Smith published its final edi-
tion in July 2022 after more than two 
decades of promoting local businesses 
and artists. 
I would like to thank the founders 
and all the staff of E-Fort Smith who 
inspired the community and high-
lighted Arkansas’s rich culture. Their 
efforts made a difference and the maga-
zine’s legacy will live beyond its final 
printing.∑

TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER VIDRINE 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
today to pay tribute to one of our 
strongest and valued leaders in munic-
ipal government from my home State 
of Louisiana, Mayor Jennifer Vidrine. 
On July 30, Mayor Vidrine will be be-
come 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman to lead the Louisiana Municipal 
Association—LMA. She will also be the 
third woman to serve in this pres-
tigious position in the LMA’s 96 years 
of service to municipal government in 
Louisiana. 
While Mayor Vidrine will undoubt-
edly lead this fine organization for the 
next year with great loyalty and en-
thusiasm, she will also continue to 
serve her most beloved residents of 
Ville Platte. Since her election in 2011, 
Mayor Vidrine has not stopped working 
to bring improvements and invest-
ments to her city. She remains at the 
forefront of local government officials 
developing new approaches to solving 
complicated problems. 
Mayor Vidrine is a woman of great 
faith who believes in serving her com-
munity wholeheartedly. She is a life-
long member of her hometown con-
gregation of the Ninth Missionary Bap-
tist Church, where she serves and as-
sists in a number of leadership roles.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

July 18, 2022 
Her commitment to the elderly and 
youth are quite noteworthy and deeply 
rooted in her beliefs. Among her many 
accomplishments, she is the founder of 
the Ville Platte Girls and Boys Place 
where afterschool and summer pro-
grams teach children culinary skills, 
music appreciation, improved commu-
nications, and writing techniques. Dur-
ing the summer, Mayor Vidrine is a 
regular presence at the Girls and Boys 
Place offering encouragement to the 
children to expand their thinking, ex-
plore their passions and to be a good 
citizen. She works tirelessly to provide 
unique opportunities for these young 
minds, many of which come from very 
low-income homes. This, in turn, al-
lows parents to feel more hopeful that 
their children will have a better life. 
When it comes to technology, Mayor 
Vidrine has practically taken her com-
munity from ‘‘worst to first’’ as she 
likes to say, by developing critical 
partnerships with public and private 
broadband providers. In the very near 
future, the city of Ville Platte will 
begin enjoying internet speeds like 
they have never seen before, thanks in 
large part to the mayor’s efforts. She 
knows the importance of technology 
and how it has an immediate impact on 
the lives of every resident. 
I consider Mayor Jennifer Vidrine as 
a most accomplished stateswoman, and 
I am extremely proud to call her a 
friend. 
I ask all of Louisiana to join me in 
congratulating 
Mayor 
Vidrine 
for 
reaching this important milestone in 
her career.∑

RECOGNIZING WHAS RADIO 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I rise 
today to honor WHAS Radio on enter-
ing its 100th year of service to the city 
of Louisville and Commonwealth of 
Kentucky. WHAS started broadcasting 
on July 18, 1992, and has covered nu-
merous historical moments, including 
the first live broadcast of the Ken-
tucky Derby, Pearl Harbor, and Presi-
dential interviews. As one of the long-
est running radio stations in the coun-
try, WHAS has won countless awards, 
including the Associated Press and 
Peabody Awards. 
During these past 100 years, WHAS 
has solidified its reputation as a leader 
in crisis coverage, specifically severe 
weather. When an F4 tornado hit Lou-
isville in 1974, WHAS traffic reporter 
Dick Gilbert followed the tornado in 
his helicopter, giving listeners live up-
dates of the storm’s location and re-
sulting damage. During the Ohio River 
flood of 1937, WHAS aired 115,000 mes-
sages, despite the electrical power 
shutdown. 
Since 1954, WHAS has served as the 
flagship station in the Crusade for 
Children, which raises millions of dol-
lars for children’s charities throughout 
Kentucky every year. In the 2022 tele-
thon, WHAS helped raise $5,133,684.69, 
making the Crusade one of America’s 
most successful local telethons. 
A dedication to informing and en-
lightening the city of Louisville has 
defined the first 100 years of broad-
casting for WHAS. As we look toward 
the future, I have no doubt that WHAS 
will continue to play an integral role 
in keeping listeners all around the 
Commonwealth informed.∑

RECOGNIZING DENNISON’S 
ROADSIDE MARKET 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize Dennison’s Roadside Market of 
Horse Cave, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
Sometimes, a great idea will just 
present itself, as it did for Kathy 
Dennison in her garden over 30 years 
ago. A tomato stand, she suggested, 
right there on their front lawn. Though 
her husband was skeptical at first, the 
first few years of their little tomato 
stand business proved successful, so 
much so that the grass in their front 
lawn was worn away from all the foot 
traffic. As the years went past, their 
popularity continued to grow, and 
eventually, the Dennisons realized they 
needed to expand their operation. The 
Dennisons, ever resourceful, looked to 
their own land when considering expan-
sion. Thus, the couple renovated the 
old tobacco barn on their property to 
facilitate their ever-growing business. 
Fast forward 20-some years later, and 
the couple now owns and operates a 
full-fledged country store, featuring in- 
season produce, jams, salsas, salad 
dressings, baskets, mums, and other 
home decorations. 
The Dennisons take special care to 
only sell local produce; so local that 
much of it is grown on their own prop-
erty. The store offers a full bounty of 
goods, and if the produce is not grown 
on their own property, it is grown on 
one of their neighbor’s farms, making 
this market not only a community at-
traction but a communal effort to 
serve Kentuckians the finest produce 
available in Horse Cave. The selection 
of produce offered at Dennison’s Road-
side Market changes throughout the 
year depending on what is in season, so 
customers know that all the food in 
the store is sold at their optimal condi-
tion. 
Dennison’s 
Roadside 
Market 
prides itself on selling fruits and vege-
tables within a week or so of being 
picked from the farm. Their inventory 
is not confined to food; they also sell 
pottery, candy, baskets, and other 
products made locally, always adhering 
to the Dennison’s philosophy of home- 
grown and high-quality. 
In the years between their little to-
mato stand and the large country store 
it has grown into, the public response 
to Paul and Kathy’s business has been 
overwhelmingly positive. Dennison’s 
Roadside Market has been a great suc-
cess, serving as the go-to store for 
locals in need of groceries and acting 
as a prominent destination for tourists 
visiting Kentucky. Tourists from as far 
as Australia have come to Dennison’s 
seeking authentic local produce. 
As if operating their own store were 
not 
already 
enough 
work, 
the 
Dennisons also run their own farm. 
When February rolls around each year, 
Paul and Kathy begin their cultivation 
process, starting in the greenhouse 
where they first sow their seeds. Some 
days, the couple work as late as 8 or 9 
p.m., maintaining their crops in order 
to maximize the amount of fruit and 
vegetables available at harvest. More-
over, the couple strives to make 
Dennison’s a welcoming environment 
not for only its customers, but for its 
employees as well. Those who work at 
Dennison’s Roadside Market describe it 
as ‘‘an amazing place to work’’ and 
‘‘something new all the time.’’ 
Selling locally sourced goods is not 
the only way Dennison’s supports their 
local community. Dennison’s often wel-
comes other small businesses to utilize 
the open space on its property. Local 
food trucks will drive from all around 
to offer their fare to the many cus-
tomers shopping at Dennison’s Market. 
Their reach expands beyond the com-
munity of Horse Cave, with Bucky 
Bee’s BBQ of Cave City, KY, and Ha-
waiian Shave Ice of Glasgow, KY, com-
ing over to Dennison’s to set up shop 
alongside the market. Collaborating 
with other Kentucky small businesses 
not only provides a fun and friendly at-
mosphere to their market, it also al-
lows Paul and Kathy Dennison to share 
in the bounty of their wonderful Horse 
Cave community. 
When a small business is as beloved 
as Dennison’s Roadside Market, it is 
hard for critics to ignore. Paul and 
Kathy’s business has received wide-
spread acclaim, earning Best Farm 
Produce by the News-Herald, second 
place in Best Farm Tourist Attraction 
by Kentucky Living, and is currently a 
finalist for Best in Kentucky by Ken-
tucky Living. Paul and Kathy’s reso-
lute dedication and immense passion 
for their business is the reason why 
Dennison’s is able to offer the highest 
quality goods each consecutive year. I 
want to commend this hard-working 
couple for their dedication and re-
sourcefulness, as they took what was a 
fertile garden and grew it into an es-
teemed venture treasured by the entire 
community. Congratulations to Paul 
and Kathy Dennison and to the entire 
team at Dennison’s Roadside Market. I 
look forward to watching your contin-
ued growth and success in Kentucky.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE: 
S.J. Res. 57. A joint resolution redesig-
nating the Robert E. Lee Memorial in Ar-
lington National Cemetery as the ‘‘Arlington 
House National Historic Site’’; to the Com-
mittee on Energy and Natural Resources. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, today, I 
am introducing legislation to remove 
‘‘Robert E. Lee Memorial’’ from the of-
ficial name of Arlington House. 
This legislation is partially inspired 
by requests from descendants of Gen-
eral Robert E. Lee and people who were 
enslaved at Arlington House. This is 
also an effort to promote a society that 
is more just and equitable for all, re-
gardless of race, by moving on from a 
public symbol that honors a figure that 
fought to protect slavery. 
Arlington House is the first name of 
the historic mansion, which sits on 
Federal land within Arlington National 
Cemetery. The property is adminis-
tered by the National Park Service and 
overlooks the Potomac River and the 
Nation’s Capital. The house was built 
by Martha Custis Washington’s grand-
son, George Washington Parke Custis, 
as the Nation’s first memorial to 
George Washington. Later, his daugh-
ter married Robert E. Lee, and the cou-
ple lived in the home until the Civil 
War. During that period, the site was 
chosen to serve as a national military 
cemetery in part to prevent Lee from 
returning. Congress passed legislation 
in 1955 designating the house the 
‘‘Custis-Lee Mansion’’ to memorialize 
Lee and subsequently amended the offi-
cial title to ‘‘Arlington House, The 
Robert E. Lee Memorial.’’ The legisla-
tion would remove the latter part of 
that name and return the house to its 
original name, ‘‘Arlington House.’’ 
Today, the National Park Service is 
dedicated to telling the story of those 
who were enslaved at the Arlington 
House. I am hopeful that this name 
change will help to do just a little bit 
more to encapsulate the full history of 
the site, which included the presence of 
many 
families 
and 
generations 
throughout 
history, 
such 
as 
the 
Syphax, Burke, Parks, and Gray fami-
lies. 
I am pleased that companion legisla-
tion is also being introduced in the 
U.S. House of Representatives by my 
colleague, Representative DON BEYER, 
who has led this effort for years.

SPEECH OF 
HON. HENRY C. ‘‘HANK’’ JOHNSON, JR. 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam Speaker, 
The DBE Gross Receipts amendment re-
moves the transportation-specific average an-
nual gross receipts limit in favor of the Small 
Business 
Administration’s 
governmentwide 
small business size standards under the North 
American Industry Classification System. The 
Small Business Administration’s government-
wide small business size standards are a 
more accurate and consistent measure of 
small business size, and better achieve the 
objectives of the disadvantaged business en-
terprise program. This change also conforms 
the size standards applicable to disadvan-
taged business enterprises that compete for 
business in federally assisted surface trans-
portation markets across the United States to 
those currently applicable to disadvantaged 
business enterprises that compete for Federal 
Aviation Administration-assisted work, which 
have been subject only to the Small Business 
Administration’s governmentwide size stand-
ards since a similar change was enacted in 
the Federal Aviation Administration Authoriza-
tion Act of 2018.

HONORING CORPORAL NATHAN 
CARLSON 
HON. CHERI BUSTOS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 18, 2022 
Mrs. BUSTOS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Corporal Nathan Carlson, who 
tragically passed away during an Osprey 
crash on June 8, 2022, along with four other 
Marines. 
Corporal Nathan Carlson was born in Rock-
ford, Illinois and graduated from Harlem High 
School in 2019, where he was captain of the 
swim team. Upon graduation, he followed his 
dream and enlisted in the Marine Corps, like 
his father before him, and attended boot camp 
at Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego. He 
graduated in August of 2019 and officially 
earned the title of marine. After a year of addi-
tional training, he reported to Marine Air Group 
39, 
specifically 
Marine 
Medium 
Tiltrotor 
Squadron 364, in September of 2020. It was 
here that he was promoted to the rank of Cor-
poral and served as a leader in the Flight Line 
Division, both as a Basic Instructor Crew Chief 
and Plane Captain. In April 2021, he deployed 
to Al-Jaber Air Base in Kuwait, followed by 
Prince Sultan Air Base in Saudi Arabia. Upon 
his return, he married the love of his life, 
Emily. He continued to train to become a Low 
Altitude Tactics Instructor, Night Systems In-
structor, Tail Gunnery Instructor, as well as a 
Collateral Duty Inspector. Corporal Carlson 
amassed over 500 total flight-hours and over 
70 combat-hours while at Squadron 364. Cor-
poral Carlson was described as someone who 
always wanted to help others. My condolences 
go out to his wife Emily, his parents Karry and 
Eric, his sisters Casey and Mylee and the rest 
of the Carlson family. 
It is because of the selfless character dis-
played by Corporal Carlson that I am espe-
cially proud to serve Illinois’ 17th Congres-
sional District. Madam Speaker, I would like to 
again, formally recognize Corporal Nathan 
Carlson for his honorable service to our coun-
try.

CELEBRATING CITY OF HOPE AND 
THE GRAND OPENING OF THE

FOUNDATION 
CANCER 
CENTER 
HON. KATIE PORTER 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 18, 2022 
Ms. PORTER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
with my Orange County colleagues Congress-
man J. LUIS CORREA, Congresswoman YOUNG 
KIM, Congressman MIKE LEVIN, Congressman 
ALAN
LOWENTHAL, 
and 
Congresswoman 
MICHELLE STEEL to recognize City of Hope and 
celebrate the grand opening of their Lennar 
Foundation Cancer Center in Irvine, California. 
We are proud that City of Hope, one of the 
largest cancer research and treatment organi-
zations in the United States, has chosen Or-
ange County for this advanced comprehensive 
cancer center. City of Hope’s innovative re-
search and world-class care will now be avail-
able to Orange County’s 3.2 million residents. 
This will save lives. 
Nearly twenty percent of people with cancer 
in Orange County have left the area for ad-
vanced cancer care, with many spending 
hours commuting to the City of Hope facility in 
Los Angeles. Now, City of Hope’s Lennar 
Foundation Cancer Center will offer Orange 
County patients a fully integrated experience— 
from prevention through survivorship—in a 
convenient location close to home. This Cen-
ter will be home to some of the nation’s most 
acclaimed physicians and scientists with ex-
pertise in lung, breast, gastrointestinal, gyne-
cological, genitourinary, blood, and other can-
cers. 
On behalf of the residents of Orange Coun-
ty, we thank City of Hope for their unwavering 
commitment to cancer care and join in cele-
brating the grand opening of their Orange 
County Lennar Foundation Cancer Center. 
LT. RIDGE ALKONIS 
HON. MIKE LEVIN 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 18, 2022 
Mr. LEVIN of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to express deep concern about the 
Japanese government’s handling of the case 
of Lt. Ridge Alkonis, a U.S. Navy officer sta-
tioned at Yokosuka Naval Base. 
Last Wednesday, the Tokyo High Court de-
nied Lt. Alkonis’ appeal to suspend a three- 
year prison sentence. I am deeply troubled 
with the treatment of Lt. Alkonis throughout 
the case. 
Lt. Alkonis has served three tours of duty in 
Japan. Before he was in the Navy, he volun-
teered in Japan for two years. He has a deep 
appreciation for the country and its people. 
In May 2021, Lt. Alkonis and his family were 
on their way home from hiking on Mount Fuji. 
Tragically, Lt. Alkonis lost control of his vehi-
cle. We would later learn from a U.S. Navy 
physician that the unfortunate event was due 
to Acute Mountain Sickness causing Lt. 
Alkonis to lose consciousness, impacting his 
ability to drive. However, as a result, two by-
standers heartbreakingly had their lives taken. 
Lt. Alkonis is remorseful for the medical inci-
dent that caused the events of that day. He 
has offered $1.65 million in extrajudicial res-
titution to the victims’ families, a gesture ex-
pected in Japan. This is beyond the family’s 
means, but those who care about them have 
rallied together to make it possible. 
I’ve been extremely upset to learn that the 
case was not conducted in a way that was fair 
to Lt. Alkonis. 
The treatment of our servicemembers in 
Japan is governed by the Status of Forces 
Agreement between our government and the 
Japanese government. This agreement re-
quires our servicemembers to be released to 
the U.S. military during trial unless they are a 
flight risk. Lt. Alkonis clearly was not. Instead 
of being released as he was supposed to be, 
he was held for the maximum time period al-
lowed, 26 days, over the objections of our 
government. 
During those 26 days, Lt. Alkonis was not 
treated properly, and Japanese investigators’ 
actions had an impact on the outcome of the 
trial. According to Lt. Alkonis’s family, he was 
kept under bright lights in his cell for the pur-
pose of sleep deprivation, withheld adequate 
translation services, and denied a lawyer dur-
ing key questioning. Critically, the Japanese 
police refused Lt. Alkonis medical care and a 
timely medical evaluation. By refusing to con-
duct this test, investigators ensured they 
would not have evidence that would explain 
Lt. Alkonis’s sudden loss of consciousness. 
I understand that our Embassy in Tokyo has 
been monitoring this case. I strongly urge 
them to do more to support a servicemember 
in need. 
My office has been working with the Depart-
ment of the Navy and the Office of the Sec-
retary of Defense to support Lt. Alkonis and

his parents, Suzanne and Derek, throughout 
his case. We supported Lt. Alkonis’s case with 
the Department of Defense and also helped 
his family get visas so they could be with him 
in Japan for the trial. As I do, the Navy be-
lieves that this is the wrong sentence for Lt. 
Alkonis. I will not be giving up on Lt. Alkonis 
and the Department of Defense must not ei-
ther.

RECOGNIZING 
HOBSON 
CITY’S 
123RD FOUNDER’S DAY CELEBRA-
TION 
HON. MIKE ROGERS 
OF ALABAMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, July 18, 2022 
Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to recognize Hobson City’s 123rd 
Founder’s Day Celebration. 
The town of Hobson City was first known as 
Mooree Quarters, a Black settlement dating 
back to 1868 in a section of Oxford, Alabama. 
In 1890, a Black man ran for Justice of the 
Peace in Oxford and the white mayoral can-
didate vowed if the Black man won, he would 
go to the State Capitol and have the boundary 
lines redrawn excluding Mooree Quarters. The 
Black man won the election and in 1896 
Mooree Quarters Settlement was removed 
from the Oxford Town Limits. 
According to the 1899 Alabama Constitu-
tion, to be eligible to vote, a resident had to 
have lived in the county of his residence for 
12 months, be a male at least 21 years old, 
able to read and understand the Constitution, 
have a steady job for 12 months, own at least 
40 acres of land and pay taxes among other 
requirements. Some Black property owners 
were allowed to vote in city and county elec-
tions. Twenty men responsible for the incorpo-
ration of the town qualified to vote under those 
terms. 
For almost three years, Mooree Quarters 
settlement sat alone in the county. Taking 
matters into their own hands, a committee of 
citizens took their concerns to attorney Ross 
Black in Anniston, Alabama. Black attorneys 
were not allowed to practice law in Alabama 
during this time. The attorney advised them to 
incorporate the territory into their own munici-
pality. On July 20, 1899, approximately 125 
Blacks living in Mooree Quarters filed a peti-
tion with Calhoun County Probate Judge E. F. 
Cook to become a separate and distinct mu-
nicipality. After proper legal proceedings, the 
town became incorporated on August 16, 
1899, making it the first city in Alabama estab-
lished exclusively for and by Black people. S. 
L. Davis was elected the first Mayor of Hob-
son City. Hobson City was named for Richard 
P. Hobson, a white Naval hero in the Spanish 
American War and a representative of the Ala-
bama Legislature. Today, Hobson City is 
under 
the 
leadership 
of 
Mayor 
Alberta 
McCrory. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Hobson City’s 123rd Founder’s Day 
Celebration August 14–20, 2022.

NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZA-
TION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2023 
SPEECH OF 
HON. RO KHANNA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, July 13, 2022 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I’d like to thank 
Chairman SMITH as well as Ranking Member 
ROGERS for their leadership to include various 
measures in the underlying bill that will aid the 
Department of Defense’s effort to prevent and 
mitigate civilian harm. That includes my 
amendment that passed the House Armed 
Services Committee unanimously during the 
NDAA markup which would permanently ex-
tend a global ex-gratia authority that allows 
the Department of Defense to make condo-
lence payments to civilians inadvertently 
harmed in U.S. military operations, alongside 
provisions in the underlying bill to establish a 
Center for Excellence in Civilian Harm Mitiga-
tion and Commission on Civilian Harm. 
I want to thank Kate Gould on my staff, and 
to thank the HASC staff, including Katy Quinn, 
Phil MacNaughton, Robert Ikoku, and Jona-
than Lord for all their work on this. And I want 
to 
thank 
Reps. 
JASON
CROW, 
TOM 
MALINOWSKI, and SARA JACOBS for co-leading 
this amendment and my bill that the amend-
ment is drawn from, H.R. 7625, the Protection 
of Civilians in Military Operations Act. 
It should not be a partisan issue to mitigate 
civilian harm. 
My amendment would simply authorize the 
resources for the Department of Defense to 
implement these policies of reducing civilian 
casualties, which Congress already required 
the Department of Defense to do nearly 4 
years ago. 
My amendment would allow the Department 
of Defense to spend $5 million per year to im-
plement the requirements of section 936 of the 
John McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019. 
Section 936, passed by this body 4 years 
ago, requires the Department of Defense to 
establish uniform processes and standards 
across combatant commands for improving 
tracking, reporting, analysis, and response to 
civilian casualties from U.S. military oper-
ations. 
It is appropriately named after the late Sen-
ator John McCain, who believed deeply that 
the United States military should minimize ci-
vilian casualties. This is something that every-
one in our military believes. 
Now, the Department of Defense has made 
extraordinary progress in recent years in pre-
venting civilian harm. Secretary Austin has 
shown 
leadership 
in 
accelerating 
that 
progress. As he says, ‘‘Our efforts to mitigate 
and respond to civilian harm . . . are a direct 
reflection of U.S. values.’’ 
Some of my colleagues want to prevent 
harm because of their own personal experi-
ence in combat or witnessing war zones 
where civilians have been killed, and some 
are motivated because they want to prevent 
terrorists from exploiting civilian casualties as 
a recruiting tool. 
But to do this, we need resources. I don’t 
think $5 million a year is very much. It is less 
than not just 1 percent, it is less than not just 
0.1 percent, it is less than 0.001 percent of the 
entire budget to help make sure we have the 
resources to track and report and minimize ci-
vilian casualties. 
I am hopeful that we can get bipartisan sup-
port for this amendment. I recognize that this 
NDAA does a lot on minimizing civilian harm, 
including the establishment of the Center for 
Excellence. I thank again Chairman SMITH for 
his leadership on that. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the amend-
ment, and I just point out that a lot of these 
requirements already have passed. They are 
in the FY 2019 NDAA. The amount of money 
we are talking about here is less than 0.001 
percent, so it will not have a negative impact 
on the total budget. 
I thank again our chairman, Chairman 
SMITH, for all of these civilian harm mitigation 
initiatives in the NDAA. This NDAA, more than 
any in my 6 years in Congress, has tackled ci-
vilian casualties, and I hope that there will 
continue to be a bipartisan commitment in the 
House to reduce them to the extent possible.

SENATE COMMITTEE MEETINGS 
Title IV of Senate Resolution 4, 
agreed to by the Senate of February 4, 
1977, calls for establishment of a sys-
tem for a computerized schedule of all 
meetings and hearings of Senate com-
mittees, subcommittees, joint commit-
tees, and committees of conference. 
This title requires all such committees 
to notify the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest—designated by the Rules Com-
mittee—of the time, place and purpose 
of the meetings, when scheduled and 
any cancellations or changes in the 
meetings as they occur. 
As an additional procedure along 
with the computerization of this infor-
mation, the Office of the Senate Daily 
Digest will prepare this information for 
printing in the Extensions of Remarks 
section of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD 
on Monday and Wednesday of each 
week.
