PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, order our week, even as 
You order our ways, and delight in the 
steps that we take. 
As we plan out this next year and all 
the obligations that fall within our 
professional and personal lives, deter-
mine the path our lives should go that 
we would remain in Your own gracious 
plan. 
When we think that our thoughts are 
pure in our own eyes, measure our spir-
its, that if they should be found want-
ing, Your righteous hand would keep 
our pride in balance. 
Establish our plans, that in every-
thing we do, we would reflect and effect 
Your purpose. 
In Your steadfast love and faithful-
ness, atone our shortcomings, and re-
ceive our righteous intent. 
This evening, we commit the work of 
our hands and our minds to You. We 
ask for Your guidance and strength for 
Your people. And it is in Your sov-
ereign name we pray. 
Amen.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Ms. 
HIRONO). The Senator from Vermont. 
JOHN LEWIS VOTING RIGHTS ADVANCEMENT ACT 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last 
week I spoke on the floor, and I re-
flected on the unthinkable events of 
January 6, 2021. We all remember when 
a violent mob attempted to snuff out 
one of our democracy’s most sacred 
traditions: the peaceful transition of 
power. That mob’s attack on our Na-
tion’s Capitol was fueled by our former 
President’s Big Lie, the utterly false 
alternate reality that Joe Biden stole 
the 2020 election through widespread 
fraud. 
But the January 6 insurrection, as 
nightmarish as it was, was not the only 
thing that was spawned by the Big Lie. 
Inspired by the former President’s 
baseless conspiracy theory, dozens of 
States have passed new laws sup-
pressing voters and making it easier 
for partisan officials to overturn the 
will of their constituents. These have 
been billed as ‘‘election integrity’’ or 
‘‘election security’’ laws. Even George 
Orwell would be impressed by these 
brazen euphemisms. 
Disenfranchising tens of thousands of 
minority voters does nothing to im-
prove the integrity of our elections, 
and empowering partisan actors to dis-
qualify ballots and ignore the popular 
will actually makes our elections more 
insecure. 
A record number of these voter sup-
pression laws are being considered and 
enacted as we head toward a major 
midterm election that will shape the 
direction of our country. Many of these 
laws would not see the light of day if 
the Department of Justice still pos-
sessed its preclearance powers under 
the 1965 Voting Rights Act. However, 
the Supreme Court unwisely decided to 
gut 
the 
Justice 
Department’s 
preclearance powers in the Shelby 
County v. Holder decision in 2013. And 
then, adding insult to injury, the Su-
preme Court toppled another critical 
pillar of the Voting Rights Act in the 
2021 Brnovich decision, even further 
limiting 
the 
Federal 
Government’s 
tools to combat voter suppression. 
So with a green light from our Na-
tion’s highest Court and constant prod-
ding from a man who refuses to accept 
reality, partisan State actors have 
breathed new life into the Big Lie—not 
by breaking laws as the January 6 mob 
did but by making them. 
Now, I happen to have a bipartisan 
bill to restore the Justice Depart-
ment’s powers to oversee and prevent 
States from enacting discriminatory 
voting laws: the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. I worked 
very hard to craft a compromise bill 
that has garnered Republican support 
here in the Senate, so it was truly a 
low point when Republicans recently 
refused to even allow debate on my bi-
partisan 
legislation—wouldn’t 
even 
allow debate. Isn’t that the whole point 
of being a Senator—to debate and vote 
on bills? 
How can you justify telling your con-
stituents that you refuse to even allow 
debate on a voting rights bill with a 56- 
year record of bipartisanship? Are we 
that afraid to simply do our jobs? 
It bears repeating, but the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act 
would simply restore and update provi-
sions of the Voting Rights Act that 
have been overwhelmingly supported 
by both parties throughout the law’s 
history. The Voting Rights Act has 
been reauthorized by large bipartisan 
majorities in Congress five times and 
proudly signed into law by Presidents 
Nixon, Reagan, and George W. Bush. 
That is not what you might call a lib-
eral trio of Presidents. 
The most recent Voting Rights Act 
reauthorization in 2006 was a 98-to-0

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S104 
January 10, 2022 
vote here in the Senate. In fact, a num-
ber of Senators still serving today, 
both Republican and Democrat, voted 
to support that legislation, as did I. 
Now, the compromise bill I crafted 
with Senator MURKOWSKI follows the 
very same blueprint of these other bi-
partisan efforts to restore the Voting 
Rights Act. Probably I am old-fash-
ioned, but it would be a tragedy if Sen-
ators have completely sacrificed our 
sense of common purpose at the altar 
of partisanship. 
We used to believe that protecting 
our right to vote—the very right that 
gives democracy its name—is bigger 
than party or politics. We used to be-
lieve that a system of self-govern-
ment—a government of, by, and for the 
people—is one that is worth preserving 
for generations to come. 
And we used to believe, regardless of 
party, that government exists to serve 
the will of the people, not the other 
way around. I would sincerely hope we 
still believe these things. The only way 
to prove it, though, is through our ac-
tions. 
I don’t know what the next few weeks 
is going to have in store, but if we have 
an opportunity to consider the bipar-
tisan John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act, I hope that all of us— 
my Republican friends and Demo-
crats—will at least have the courage of 
their convictions and allow a vote on 
it. 
And if you oppose a bipartisan bill to 
restore a landmark voting rights law 
that has had nearly six decades of un-
wavering bipartisan support, then have 
the courage to stand up on the Senate 
floor and vote against it. I, for one, will 
proudly vote yes. All the tweeting and 
partisan posturing that seems to con-
sume most of our energy these days 
will quickly be forgotten. What will be 
remembered for decades is what the 
Senate did in our democracy’s hour of 
peril. I hope—indeed, I pray—that the 
answer is not nothing. 
Too many hide behind parliamentary 
procedures not to have to vote on any-
thing. What is wrong with us? We get 6- 
year terms. Don’t be afraid to vote. 
Vote yes or vote no, but stand up and 
let the people know where you stand 
and vote. This ‘‘Well, we are going to 
block this coming to a vote’’ means, ‘‘I 
don’t have the courage to stand up and 
vote.’’ That is all it means. 
If you want to stop these things from 
coming to a vote, it means you don’t 
have the courage to vote; you are not 
willing to go on record and vote or you 
are afraid somebody might look at 
your vote someday and say: Hmm, why 
did he or she vote that way? 
I have voted more than 17,000 times 
on this floor. I have been proud to vote 
the way I have. I am sure I could look 
back over decades of voting and find a 
vote here and a vote there and say: You 
know, maybe I should have voted dif-
ferently, but these issues always come 
back up again, and I will correct my 
vote—but not if we are not allowed to 
vote. 
I had one Senator say that the reason 
we want this kind of open voting is so 
that we can elect just Democrats. That 
is balderdash. My State of Vermont has 
probably the most open voting, the 
most accessible voting, of any State in 
the Union. We also have one of the 
highest turnouts of any State in the 
Union. Anybody can request an absen-
tee ballot. Anybody can vote right up 
to the last minute. 
And is this for partisanship? I look at 
the last election a little over a year 
ago. We elect our Governor and our 
Lieutenant Governor separately. Vot-
ers all came to the polls in a record 
turnout. They elected a Republican as 
Governor and a Democrat as Lieuten-
ant Governor. I think the Republican 
who was elected is proud of the way we 
vote, and I know the Lieutenant Gov-
ernor who was elected, she is proud of 
the way we vote because it reflected 
that the voters actually vote for who 
they want, not in some partisan way. 
And we hurt this country and we 
hurt this Senate that I love if we are 
afraid to vote. I am proud to be the 
dean of the Senate. I am proud to be 
the President pro tempore. But I am 
not proud when we don’t vote. I am not 
proud when we hide behind mecha-
nisms and we don’t vote. 
I am not proud to see partisan voting 
on 
nominees, 
something 
that 
has 
blocked—something where there has 
been far more votes against women in 
our Senate Judiciary Committee than I 
have seen in the decades I have served 
on that committee. 
We can’t do this. Stand up and vote. 
Let people know where you stand. If it 
is your automatic thing to vote against 
women for nominations, I disagree 
with that, but have the courage to 
stand up and vote and show people 
where you are. That is what we have to 
do. 
If people are afraid to vote and have 
their votes heard, their votes recorded, 
then they don’t belong in the U.S. Sen-
ate—not in a body that should be the 
conscience of the Nation. 
I hope that we will come together 
and vote these voting rights bills up or 
down. In this country, we have seen too 
many times in the past where people 
were not allowed to vote or were 
blocked from voting—from whatever 
way it was done. And think of every 
time that happened. Our country suf-
fered. Our country suffered. 
What we are saying is, let everybody 
vote—whether 
Republicans, 
Demo-
crats, or Independents—stand up and 
vote, have the ability to vote. Don’t 
use artificial ways to block people 
from voting just because you think 
they may vote differently than you do, 
just as I have fought all my career to 
make sure that, in my own State of 
Vermont, everybody has a chance to 
vote. 
Marcelle and I have even done ads on 
our television saying: We want every-
body to vote, whether you are voting 
for a Republican or voting for a Demo-
crat. Get out and vote. 
Of course, I was hoping they would 
vote for me, and I am sure my Repub-
lican opponents hoped they would vote 
for them. But the point I was trying to 
make is, it is important that every-
body votes, whether they are voting for 
me or against me. And that is why in 
Vermont we have one of the highest 
percentage of voters. 
And if we want to keep having these 
‘‘suppression of vote’’ bills, we all suf-
fer. The country suffers. Our image 
around the world suffers. Don’t be 
afraid to vote. We are not going to get 
perfect people every time, but we can 
have a perfect way of voting. In the 
long run, the country is better off. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER 
The majority leader is recognized. 
TWIN PARKS NORTH WEST TOWER FIRE 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
today my thoughts, my prayers, and 
condolences are with everyone whose 
lives were ripped apart because of the 
awful fire in the apartments that ig-
nited yesterday at the Twin Parks 
North West tower in the Bronx. Seven-
teen people lost their lives in yester-
day’s fire, including eight innocent 
children. Dozens of others were injured, 
many critically so. We pray for their 
recovery. Many are still in the ICU. 
It was the deadliest fire in New York 
City in the last 30 years, an unspeak-
able tragedy made a thousand times 
worse because it happened within the 
confines of people’s own homes—places 
that should be safe, should be secure, 
should be shielded from moments of 
terror like the ones we saw yesterday. 
I grieve for all the families, friends, 
and neighbors whose lives were sud-
denly cut short in the fire. Many were 
from immigrant families, people who 
came to our city to start climbing up 
the ladders of prosperity and a decent 
life for themselves and their children 
in this beautiful country, and now they 
are lost. 
I commend the brave firefighters who 
stepped up to beat back the fire, save 
lives, and keep the surrounding com-
munities safe. They did not think 
about their own safety. They just an-
swered the call and did their jobs. That 
is what firefighters do. We respect 
them. We love them. I am profoundly 
grateful for them and all the workers 
who are rebuilding from the damage, as 
well as the health workers tending to 
the injured. 
Last night, I joined with the Gov-
ernor, Mayor Adams, and with other 
members of the city and local govern-
ment. It was a broad group because 
New York always pulls together in 
times of tragedy, and we had people

from all parts of this city and all dif-
ferent backgrounds coming together to 
support those families impacted by the 
fire. At the Federal level, we will do 
whatever we can—housing assistance, 
disaster assistance, and help for all im-
migrant families. 
Many of those affected by the fire 
came from Gambia and other West Af-
rican countries on a program called Di-
versity Visa, which I was proud to au-
thor. I say to these immigrant fami-
lies: Do not hesitate to reach out to 
local and Federal authorities. You will 
find nothing but a helping hand. 
When tragedy strikes our city, New 
Yorkers come together. We embrace 
one another. We help however we can. 
And we always find ways to come back 
stronger than before. That has been 
true throughout our city’s history, and 
it shall remain true as we get through 
this latest, awful tragedy. 
DEMOCRACY 
Madam President, now on defending 
democracy, last week, the Nation ob-
served the 1-year anniversary of the 
greatest violent assault against our de-
mocracy since the time of the Amer-
ican Civil War. Though the Capitol at-
tack of January 6, 2021, was confined to 
a single day, the attacks on our democ-
racy have not ceased. The Big Lie—the 
terrible fantasy that our elections are 
rife with voter fraud and that Donald 
Trump won the 2020 election—lives on 
to this day and is spreading throughout 
our country, used to undermine our de-
mocracy. 
Donald Trump has such an infantile 
ego that he cannot accept that he lost. 
So he spreads the Big Lie. But just as 
bad—or almost as bad—are all those in 
politics, in the media, and elsewhere 
who know it is a lie but continue to 
spread it, to the grave detriment of the 
fundamental roots of this country, its 
democracy. 
Tomorrow, President Biden will trav-
el to Georgia and make the moral case 
to the Nation that the time has come 
to act to defend democracy and protect 
voting rights, even if it means chang-
ing Senate rules to restore the Senate. 
Every single lover of democracy 
across America, especially those of us 
in this Chamber, should take heart of 
the President’s message and ask our-
selves: What can we do to protect free 
and fair elections in this country? 
The Senate, I believe, stands ready to 
follow through on the President’s call. 
Later this week, we will hold a vote 
yet again on legislation to protect our 
democracy and protect the sacred right 
to vote. Everyone in this Chamber will 
have a chance to go on record. Will Re-
publicans join Democrats in a bipar-
tisan manner to move forward on de-
fending democracy or will they once 
again mount a filibuster and offer their 
implicit endorsement of the Big Lie? 
I hope they join us, but to date, un-
fortunately, I have seen precious little 
suggesting they will do so. 
On the contrary, our Republican col-
leagues have gone to great lengths re-
cently to distract from the dangers of 
Donald Trump’s Big Lie. Senate Repub-
licans are so stung by our arguments 
about voter fraud and the Big Lie that 
the Republican leader has actually 
tried to argue that it is actually Demo-
crats pushing a big lie when we warn 
about voter suppression. 
The threats of voter suppression are 
not false; they are dangerous. The Re-
publican leader’s line of argument is 
gas-lighting, pure and simple. The Re-
publican leader has pointed repeatedly 
to the experience of the 2020 election as 
proof, somehow, that there exists no ef-
fort to suppress the vote. But he ig-
nores that the problem today is not 
just about what happened during the 
2020 election. It is about what happened 
after, and it is happening today. 
If Leader MCCONNELL doesn’t want to 
get into specifics about the laws passed 
by Republican legislators across this 
country to limit the right to vote, then 
we Democrats will. Despite the fact 
that the 2020 election was free, fair, 
and accurate, in the year that followed 
at least 19 States suddenly decided to 
rewrite the rules that govern the way 
people voted in their respective States. 
At least 33—33—new laws have passed 
across the country that will make it 
harder to vote, harder to register to 
vote, and, worst of all, potentially em-
power partisans to arbitrate outcomes 
of future elections instead of non-
partisan election workers. And that 
may be just the beginning because leg-
islatures in various States are pre-
paring new laws as they enter the 2022 
sessions of their legislatures. 
I ask my Republican colleagues: 
Take a look at what has happened in 
many of the Republican-led State leg-
islatures. When Republicans in States 
like Texas reduce polling hours and 
polling locations, how does that not 
make it harder for people to vote? 
When Republicans in States like Flor-
ida, Kansas, Iowa, and Texas make it 
harder for people to even register to 
vote—even to register to vote—how is 
that not suppressing their fundamental 
right to vote at all? What does that 
have to do with election security? 
When Republicans in States like 
Georgia, Indiana, and Florida cut back 
on the number and availability of loca-
tions where people can drop off their 
absentee ballots, how can Republicans 
say that voting hasn’t been made hard-
er? And when Republicans in States 
like Georgia make it a crime to give 
food and water to people waiting in 
line at the polls, how is that not mak-
ing it harder for them to cast a ballot? 
Some of the examples are especially 
egregious. According to one recent re-
port, Lincoln County in Georgia is 
looking to eliminate all but one polling 
location in the entire county before the 
next election—one location in a whole 
big county. That is disgusting. 
Some voters who live in the county 
would have to drive 23 miles just to 
drop off a ballot. This in no way makes 
voting more convenient. It makes it an 
enormous burden. 
Let’s be abundantly clear. These new 
anti-voter laws are on the books today 
because their authors cited the Big Lie, 
cited the fictitious bugaboo of voter 
fraud, and are trying to succeed where 
the insurrection failed. It is a slow-mo-
tion insurrection but a very, very per-
nicious one. 
We have yet to hear, on substance, 
any serious attempt from Senate Re-
publicans defending these terrible new 
laws. They don’t mention them. The 
truth is our Republican colleagues can-
not defend them because the goal of 
these laws is very clear: They are delib-
erately targeting all the ways that 
younger, poorer, and non-White Ameri-
cans typically access the ballot. 
And by blocking this Chamber from 
taking any action, Senate Republicans 
are implicitly offering their own en-
dorsement of the Big Lie. 
Senate Democrats have been clear of 
our intentions from the start: The Sen-
ate must pass legislation that will safe-
guard our democracy and protect peo-
ple’s right to vote. It is why we have 
pushed the Freedom to Vote Act and 
the John Lewis Voting Rights Ad-
vancement Act numerous times here 
on the floor, only for Republicans to 
filibuster them and prevent the Cham-
ber from having so much as a debate. 
By hijacking the rules of the Senate 
and preventing any movement, Repub-
licans are saying they oppose policies 
that guarantee same-day voter reg-
istration, 
policies 
that 
safeguard 
against election subversion, policies 
that protect poll workers, and policies 
that prevent faulty and dangerous 
voter roll purges. 
By blocking action in the Senate, Re-
publicans are saying they oppose ef-
forts to fight the power of dark money 
and efforts to end partisan gerry-
mandering. Senate Republicans are 
saying they are perfectly fine with 
laws that limit voter registration, 
limit early voting, and limit the num-
ber of polling places and drop boxes. 
They are even fine with policies that 
criminalize giving food and drink to 
voters at the polls. 
These laws are anathema to the very 
spirit of our democracy. They are Jim 
Crow 2, and it is the Republican Party, 
by and large in this Senate, supporting 
the reenactment of those Jim Crow 
laws. 
If Republicans refuse to join us in a 
bipartisan spirit, if they continue to 
hijack the rules of the Senate to turn 
this Chamber into a deep freezer, we 
are going to consider the appropriate 
steps necessary to restore the Senate 
so we can pass these proposals and send 
them to the President’s desk. 
On this month—the same month we 
mark the 1-year anniversary of an 
armed insurrection at the U.S. Cap-
itol—the question before the Senate is 
a simple one: How will we find a path 
forward on protecting our freedoms in 
the 21st century? 
Members of this body must now face 
a choice: They can follow in the foot-
steps of our patriotic predecessors in 
this Chamber or they can sit by as the 
fabric of our democracy unravels be-
fore their very eyes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S106 
January 10, 2022 
I yield the floor. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
VOTING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
this week on this floor, we are poised 
to witness something that has never 
happened before in living memory: an 
attempt to attack the core identity of 
the Senate by a sitting majority lead-
er. 
The senior Senator from New York 
once said nuking the filibuster would 
‘‘turn what the Founding Fathers 
called the cooling saucer of democracy 
into the rubber stamp of dictatorship.’’ 
He said it would ‘‘make the country 
into a banana republic . . . a doomsday 
for democracy,’’ he said. Now, he wants 
to trigger that doomsday himself. 
When I was majority leader, some of 
my own party urged me to break the 
Senate for our own party’s short-term 
gain. My answer was a simple word: 
‘‘no.’’ 
Less than 4 years ago, the senior Sen-
ator from Illinois said nuking the leg-
islative filibuster ‘‘would be the end of 
the Senate as it was originally devised 
and created going back to our Found-
ing Fathers.’’ Now, he wants the Sen-
ate to end on his watch. 
The last time Senate Democrats were 
in the minority, 32 of them signed a 
letter demanding the legislative fili-
buster stay in place. Now, many of 
them say they want to break this insti-
tution. The excuses put forward for 
this behavior are entirely fake. The 
supposed 
justifications 
are 
simply 
false. The Senate Democratic leaders 
are trying to use a big lie to bully and 
berate their own Members into break-
ing their word, breaking the rules, and 
breaking the Senate. 
We are going to spend all week 
sounding the alarm on the radical 
takeovers that some Democrats want 
to pull off. They want to silence mil-
lions of Americans and take over the 
Senate so they can take over elections 
so they can take over America. 
Leading Democrats say they want to 
break the Senate because of the sin-
ister anti-voting plot that is sweeping 
America. Of course, this is totally fake. 
It does not exist. The current control 
of Congress and the White House were 
decided in 2020 by the highest turnout 
in 120 years. Ninety-four percent of 
voters said voting was easy. More 
Americans say current voting laws are 
too lax than say they are too restric-
tive. 
Confronted by the facts, the Demo-
cratic leader says they are, of course, 
irrelevant. He says the entire nuclear 
push is occasioned by what a few 
States did in 2021. This is utter non-
sense. The Senator from New York has 
been publicly laying groundwork to 
nuke the Senate rules since back in 
2019, before the 2020 election. More 
than a year before the 2020 election, 
the Democratic leader was openly flirt-
ing with nuking the Senate rules if he 
got the power so he would be able to 
ram through bigger changes. Now, none 
of this was occasioned by what State 
legislatures did in 2021. This is actually 
a yearslong quest for power in search 
of a pretext. 
Their hysterical attack on State laws 
are fake as well. The State of Georgia 
passed a voting law providing for more 
in-person early voting than New York 
provides. It allows for no-excuse absen-
tee voting, which New York prohibits. 
If there was not a voting crisis in Dem-
ocrat-run New York 6 months ago, 
there is no crisis in Georgia now. If 
Georgia is a banana republic today, 
then New York has been and still is a 
banana republic. There is zero logic 
here, zero consistency. 
In the State of Texas, Democrats are 
hysterical because the State rolled 
back some unusual COVID-specific ex-
ceptions to their prior procedures, such 
as universal drive-through voting and 
24-hour voting. So if the bar for voting 
rights now requires the possibility of 
voting in person at 3 a.m., how many 
blue States in America meet that bar? 
Neither of these things existed in 
Texas before 2020, and neither widely 
exists in blue States. 
Every hysterical claim that our de-
mocracy is in crisis rings hollow. More 
Americans today say that President 
Biden’s election was legitimate—now 
listen to this—than said the same 
thing about the prior President in late 
2017. More Americans today say that 
President Biden’s election was legiti-
mate than said the same about the 
prior President in late 2017. Yet Demo-
crats are trying to use their fake 
hysteria to justify breaking Senate 
rules so they can seize control of elec-
tions in all 50 States. That is what they 
are up to. 
Historically, the Senate has taken up 
elections legislation on a careful, bi-
partisan basis. We have made sure not 
to trample on the rights of voters and 
the proper roles of local officials. 
In 2002, we passed the Help America 
Vote Act by a vote of 92 to 2—92 to 2. 
Chris Dodd and I authored that bill. In-
terestingly enough, the only dissenting 
votes came from then-Senator Hillary 
Clinton and the current Democratic 
leader, CHUCK SCHUMER. Ninety-two to 
two. 
Well, that is how you pass election 
reform if there are actual issues that 
need tackling. You do it carefully; you 
do it thoughtfully; bipartisan com-
mittee work; regular order. Our col-
leagues aren’t doing anything like 
that. They are trying to ram through a 
sweeping, 
partisan 
legislation 
that 
they first drafted and introduced in its 
first iteration back in 2019. 
Democrats say they are concerned 
about efforts to disempower the appro-
priate local elections officials. Well, it 
is actually their bills that would 
disempower local officials, by Wash-
ington Democrats appointing them-
selves the entire country’s board of 
elections on steroids. 
Democrats say they are concerned 
about 
overturning 
election 
results. 
Well, it is their bills that would over-
turn election results, overruling the 
commonsense voting laws that citizens 
across the country pick for their own 
States. 
A case in point: The Democrats’ lat-
est bill would force the entire country 
to adopt two practices—same-day reg-
istration and no-excuse absentee vot-
ing—that the citizens of New York 
State had as ballot measures last No-
vember. Deep-blue New York rejected 
them both. So you have to ask your-
self, why are Washington Democrats 
refusing to accept the decision of New 
York voters? Why are they trying to 
set aside these election results and 
overturn the people’s will? 
Our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
also 
talked about a so-called voting rights 
bill. This is a bill to turn the partisan 
Attorney General into a national elec-
tions czar. The Attorney General would 
no longer have to sue States to win in 
court; he could end up doing an end run 
around the legal system and push 
States around without having to per-
suade a judge first. I am sure our 
Democratic colleagues would have re-
acted well if Republicans had tried to 
break Senate rules so that Bill Barr 
could micromanage elections in blue 
States. I am sure that would have gone 
swimmingly on their side of the aisle. 
But, ultimately, the issues at stake 
this week run even deeper than this 
fake hysteria, even deeper than voting 
laws. Breaking the Senate itself and 
nuking the filibuster would cause a 
massive political power outage for 
many millions of American citizens, 
for entire States. 
So the filibuster is not just about 
what bills are blocked; it is also the 
sole feature that gives millions of 
Americans any voice at all in the legis-
lation that does pass whenever there is 
one-party control. Annual appropria-
tions, government funding bills, the 
NDAA, 
rescue 
packages 
like 
the 
CARES Act—all of them could be done 
on a one-party basis, thereby elimi-
nating the influence of every State in 
America represented by a Member of 
the minority. 
For decades, both Senators and citi-
zens have been able to take for granted 
that everybody gets a voice, even when 
they don’t have divided government. If 
this unique feature of the Senate is 
blown up, millions and millions of 
Americans’ voices will cease to be 
heard in this Chamber—a radical Sen-
ate takeover, for a radical elections 
takeover, for a radical takeover of our 
Nation’s future. 
What the Democratic leader wants to 
do would not protect our democracy or 
our system of government. It would de-
stroy a key feature of American Gov-
ernment forever, and the Senators on 
both sides know it.

ator from Illinois.

S107 
January 10, 2022 
Senate, the rules of the Senate, the 
precedents of the Senate, and why we 
are dutybound to follow them, but I 
couldn’t get this image out of my mind 
as he spoke: the image of that news 
that came to us one day that Supreme 
Court Justice Antonin Scalia had trag-
ically passed away. 
And we all remember what happened 
next. It was the same Republican lead-
er who sent the word out to his Repub-
lican Members: Don’t even entertain 
the possibility that President Obama is 
going to fill this vacancy on the Su-
preme Court. We are going to keep this 
vacancy open in the hopes that we can 
elect a Republican President to fill it. 
Now, that was 8 months at least, 
maybe 10 months, before the election. 
And it was the first time in the history 
of the United States that a Republican 
leader of the Senate used his power to 
browbeat his members not even to 
meet with Merrick Garland, the Presi-
dent’s 
nominee, 
President 
Obama’s 
nominee. They wouldn’t even entertain 
an office meeting with him to discuss 
it. It was out of the question. The Su-
preme Court was going to have 8 mem-
bers, period, and not one more because 
there was an election coming and a Re-
publican opportunity in that election. 
And so that is what happened. You re-
member it well, and I do too. 
So when I hear about preserving the 
sanctity of traditions in the Senate, I 
can’t help but remember that vacant 
seat on the Supreme Court for almost a 
year. I cannot help but remember that 
in the last year of Obama’s Presidency 
that he was denied the opportunity 
which other Presidents routinely were 
given to fill a vacancy on the Supreme 
Court. That was the reality. 
And now there is a question of the fu-
ture of the filibuster, and I will con-
cede that the filibuster has been part of 
the profile in the Senate for a long, 
long time—for many decades. But what 
the Senate Republican leader fails to 
note is that the use of the filibuster is 
out of control. 
We now have filibusters threatened 
on everything in sight. It was by de-
sign, not by accident. And it was by de-
sign to slow down the business of the 
Senate and stop the production of the 
Senate, and that is why day after 
weary day this Chamber is empty. 
Nothing is happening because a fili-
buster is usually looming over the 
body. 
And for those who want to restore 
the Senate to an actual legislative 
body with actual debate and amend-
ments on the floor, we are being told 
by the Republican leader that we are 
somehow denying the basic birthright 
of the Senate, and we know that is 
wrong. We know that the Senate, as 
many of us remember, has changed dra-
matically. 
It was 25 years ago that I came to the 
Senate. We voted a lot. We actually 
had 12 appropriations bills come to the 
floor of the Senate every year—every 
year—under an open process where any 
amendment could be offered and de-
bated and voted on, and ultimately 
that appropriations bill would go into 
conference with the House and end up 
doing what it was supposed to do, fund-
ing our government. 
I can’t remember the last time that 
happened. I think it has been 10 years 
now since the subcommittees for ap-
propriations did their normal business 
with the budget resolution and pre-
pared these bills. It is gone. Why? Why 
is it gone? Wasn’t it the tradition of 
the Senate that you consider those 
bills? It is gone because of abuse of the 
filibuster. 
Any amendment that is offered is 
threatened with a 60-vote requirement 
and things grind to a halt. And you 
know the net result of it? We have 
something called an omnibus. All the 
spending bills are merged into one 
massive piece of legislation. Let the 
staff write it. Let the Members look 
over their shoulder and see if there is 
anything in there of interest, and we 
pass it year after year after year. 
Is that another fine tradition of the 
Senate that we want to protect? I hope 
not. 
Let me say a word about voting, if I 
can. For as long as we have had this 
Nation, there has always been a basic 
question as to who will choose the 
leaders. 
Our Founding Fathers showed a lot 
of wisdom, but they missed it when it 
came to voting—at least by this cen-
tury’s standards because they denied 
the vote to African Americans who, by 
and large, were slaves in that culture, 
and they denied the vote to women. 
And they said that basically propertied 
individuals were the ones who would 
choose the leaders of our country. 
We have a different view of America’s 
democracy today, and many of us be-
lieve that every eligible person in this 
country should be given an opportunity 
to vote that is not a hardship. 
So in the 2020 election, we had a 
record turnout. There were many of us 
who felt we should build on that to 
have an even larger turnout in the next 
election—let the people speak, let the 
people vote. 
And in about 20 different State legis-
latures controlled by the Republicans, 
exactly the opposite was decided. They 
decided that they would restrict oppor-
tunities to vote. Too many darn people 
voted in that 2020 election, and the re-
sults weren’t what some of the Repub-
lican legislatures and Governors ex-
pected. So they decided they wanted to 
change it—reduce the opportunity for 
early voting, reduce the opportunities 
for registration, reduce the oppor-
tunity for same-day registration. 
They argued that some States have 
them and some don’t. Well, the bottom 
line, as we see it on the Democratic 
side, is if we are going to open oppor-
tunity for people across the country 
who are eligible to vote without hard-
ship, then we ought to do it across the 
board, and that is why we support leg-
islation—Federal legislation ordained 
and envisioned by our Constitution to 
establish standards that will make it 
easier to vote. 
The Senator from Kentucky likes to 
come to the floor and say, well, New 
York doesn’t have all those good 
things. He may be right. But why 
shouldn’t they? As far as I am con-
cerned, Illinois, New York, Hawaii, all 
States should be governed by standards 
and give people an additional oppor-
tunity to vote. 
I would rather come down on the side 
of a larger turnout of the electorate 
and let democracy speak than the al-
ternative, which is being suggested by 
the Republican leader. They want to 
selectively make it difficult for some 
people to come and vote. I don’t. I 
think they are wrong. 
Time and again, the Senate Repub-
lican leader came to the floor and 
called things fake. I guess we are now 
into that characterization and can 
thank President Trump for leading us 
down that path. What is not fake is 
this. Throughout the history of the 
United States, the opportunity to vote 
has been denied, primarily to people of 
color and the poor, year after year, in 
an effort to try to ensure that election 
results turned out a certain way. 
For the longest time, my Democratic 
Party was guilty of that sin. I readily 
confess it because history makes it 
clear, but now that mantle has been 
passed to the party of Abraham Lin-
coln, the Republican Party, which is 
now trying to restrict the right to vote 
across the Nation. 
When you heard that in Georgia you 
couldn’t provide water or food to peo-
ple waiting in line, it probably struck 
most Americans as odd. Why would 
they say that? 
Well, visualize, if you will, the lines 
of voters, and you will find, if your 
memory is the same as mine, that 
largely they were minority voters who 
were standing in line for hours to 
vote—hours to vote. 
And so the Georgia State Legislature 
and others have said, if you give them 
water or food, you have violated the 
law. Let them stand in line without 
any support. 
Really? Is that what it has come 
down to? The fear that if you give a 
cup of water to someone waiting in line 
to vote, you are buying their vote? I 
just can’t believe the thinking that 
leads to that. But we know behind it 
were a lot of situations where machin-
ery and voting places were limited to 
minority populations. 
UKRAINE 
Madam President, nearly 32 years 
ago, Lithuania, a tiny nation on the 
Baltic Sea, dared to reclaim its free-
dom from the Soviet Union. At that 
time, the Soviet Union was one of the 
world’s superpowers. The reaction from 
Moscow took 11 months, and it was 
brutal. 
On January 11, 1991, 31 years ago this 
week, Soviet tanks rolled in to crush 
Lithuanian freedom. It would become 
known as Lithuania’s Bloody Sunday. 
In the capital city of Vilnius, crowds

gathered in TV Tower and Parliament 
Square to protest and resist the Rus-
sians and to defend their new inde-
pendent national legislature. 
I was lucky. I was there to see the ef-
forts by the people of Lithuania of this 
tiny nation to protect what they were 
starting with a new Parliament and 
free elections for the first time in al-
most 50 years. 
Thirteen martyrs died in the Soviet 
Union’s brutal attempt to crush the 
restoration of Lithuanian independ-
ence. But to the astonishment of the 
entire world, after 2 days of bloodshed 
and killing, the Soviet tanks turned 
around and left. Against all odds, that 
tiny nation of Lithuania threw off 50 
years of Soviet tyranny and occupa-
tion. They soon were joined by Latvia 
and Estonia, where similar courage was 
shown, and then by other Eastern Eu-
ropean nations held captive by the So-
viet bloc. 
Today, I am proud to say Lithuania 
remains a free and independent democ-
racy. Soviet President Mikhail Gorba-
chev, at the time he ordered the tanks 
to withdraw from Lithuania, 31 years 
ago, came to realize that you can bru-
talize a people who are determined to 
be free, but you can’t defeat them. Ul-
timately, freedom will prevail. 
It is a tragedy that Russian Presi-
dent Putin—Vladimir Putin—cannot or 
will not learn that lesson of history. 
Instead, today, he is intimidating 
Ukraine with the same discredited tac-
tics that failed in the Baltics three dec-
ades ago. 
I was fortunate to be invited on a 
trip in the year 2014 with the late Sen-
ator John McCain of Arizona. He never 
missed visiting the hot spots of the 
world, and we went to Kiev in Ukraine, 
and we walked down to the Maidan 
Square, which had been the place 
where 
the 
people 
of 
Ukraine—the 
Ukrainians—stepped forward to de-
mand their freedom. 
Senator McCain invited me to be part 
of a delegation during an extraordinary 
moment when the Ukrainian people 
were preparing to risk their lives for 
freedom. We were joined on the trip to 
Kiev by Senators Barrasso, Johnson, 
Murphy, and others. And we walked 
solemnly 
through 
the 
makeshift 
shrines set up in the Maidan memori-
alizing those who lost their lives in 
Ukraine’s peaceful protest for a better 
future. 
They stopped us at one point and 
pointed to a place and said: One of the 
protesters was standing here when the 
government sniper killed him. That is 
why there are flowers and candles at 
that site. 
We were planning to travel to the 
eastern part of the country as well, but 
we were too late. Russians and Vladi-
mir Putin had already invaded with 
their little green men and had seized 
the territory of Crimea. Yet in the en-
suing years, despite Russia’s military 
invasion and occupation of Eastern 
Ukraine, the Ukrainian people have 
thrived and built on their democratic 
aspirations. 
As with any democracy, there are al-
ways areas for improvement, but the 
Ukrainian people have clearly decided 
their future is with the community of 
democracies and not with Moscow. And 
yet that basic human desire to be free 
and democratically choose one’s lead-
ers is apparently too much for Russian 
leader Vladimir Putin who is now 
threatening a further massive military 
invasion of Ukraine. 
He has amassed some 100,000 troops 
on their border, preparing for that in-
vasion. It is not enough that Putin de-
nies the Russian people their basic 
freedom; he is determined to eradicate 
similar aspirations on Russia’s border 
to protect his undemocratic regime. 
President Biden and Members of both 
parties in this Chamber have been swift 
to condemn Putin’s threatened further 
invasion of Ukraine. President Biden 
has made it clear that any such move 
by Russia would be met with rapid and 
severe economic sanctions. The chair 
of the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, BOB MENENDEZ of New Jersey, 
has drafted legislation that would im-
pose historic sanctions if Russia fur-
ther invades Ukraine. The bill’s ap-
proach is sweeping and clear, and I sup-
port it. I agree with our President and 
the chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee. This is the right message 
for us to send from the President and 
the U.S. Senate to Vladimir Putin. 
Chairman MENENDEZ’s solution also 
provides assistance to the Baltic States 
in standing up to both Putin and 
China—a timely measure I want to 
thank my colleague for including in 
this bill. 
It is a bill we should actually be de-
bating on the Senate floor. Instead, we 
will be forced to vote this week or soon 
on a different and weaker response to 
the crisis on the Ukraine’s border. 
The junior Senator from Texas is the 
author of this weaker approach. He has 
managed to force a vote on it by hold-
ing hostage dozens of President Biden’s 
nominations. His approach includes a 
provision to remove the waiver for 
sanctions against a new gas pipeline 
between Russia and Germany. 
Let me be clear. This Nord Stream 2 
Pipeline is a proposal I have been crit-
ical of for a long time. I have urged our 
European allies to diversify their nat-
ural gas supply away from Russia. 
President Biden’s position on Nord 
Stream 2 is the same—that the pipeline 
could effectively undermine European 
security by increasing reliance on Mos-
cow. 
But the truth is, construction on 
that pipeline did not begin in the last 
year; 
it 
started 
under 
President 
Trump. I don’t think you will be hear-
ing that present in the speeches of the 
junior Senator from Texas. Despite 
congressional sanctions and restric-
tions, by the time Biden entered office, 
that pipeline was nearly 95 percent 
complete. Where was the Republican 
outrage when the lion’s share of the 
pipeline was built under the Trump ad-
ministration? Were dozens of critical 
nominations brazenly and dangerously 
held then? No. 
Given the pipeline’s near completion 
this spring, President Biden waived 
some but not all sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2 in an effort to mend relations 
with Germany and its new government. 
They are one of our closest allies and 
partners. We need to continue such 
close cooperation with our European 
partners so long as they stand with us 
to effectively deter further Russian 
provocation. 
President Biden announced an agree-
ment with Germany that involves se-
curing Ukraine and Europe’s energy 
sector, as well as imposing sanctions 
on Russia. This is important. The 
President still has the authority to im-
pose additional sanctions on Nord 
Stream 2. In fact, just this November, 
the administration sanctioned a Rus-
sian-linked ship in connection with it. 
The bill offered by my colleague from 
Texas does not provide any new au-
thority to the President; it only takes 
away his waiver authority to force 
sanctions, setting a dangerous prece-
dent and jeopardizing the administra-
tion’s flexibility to respond to esca-
lation by the Russians. 
This Cruz bill will hardly deter the 
potential Russian invasion of Ukraine 
and only serve to complicate the ef-
forts to repair relations with our Euro-
pean ally Germany, which has critical 
energy needs. 
I believe we should leave the flexi-
bility of how and when to further sanc-
tion this pipeline to the President as 
part of a larger approach in dealing 
with Putin. For this reason, I urge my 
colleagues to support the wiser ap-
proach by the senior Senator from New 
Jersey to send a serious, credible re-
sponse to Russia if it further invades 
Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
ADOPTIONS FROM CHINA 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
for over 25 years in the Senate, I have 
been an advocate for adoption. 
Adoption is a way for families to be 
created out of tragedy. It is a pathway 
to the joy of raising children and guar-
anteeing security of a place that now 
they can call home. 
One family, Cate and Ben Bryan from 
Iowa, made the choice to open their 
hearts and their home to a child from 
China and were matched with a little 
girl named Rosie. 
Hundreds of families across the coun-
try, including the Bryans and others in 
Iowa, 
have 
chosen 
adoption 
from 
China. They have been matched with 
specific children and made arrange-
ments to welcome those children into 
their homes. 
Many of these kids being adopted 
from China have disabilities or other 
special needs and require specialized 
health and care services. 
These kids are in desperate need of 
families to take care of them but are 
being denied the opportunity to come

to their home in America with those 
parents all due to China’s refusal to let 
Americans into the country to com-
plete adoptions. 
In February of 2020, China closed its 
border due to the spread of COVID. 
This meant that parents who had al-
ready been matched with a child in 
China could not proceed with their 
adoption. Of course, parents must 
physically be present in China to con-
tinue the adoption process and bring it 
to finality in order to get their child 
home. 
What was said to be a temporary 
emergency 
precaution 
because 
of 
COVID has now stretched into years 
despite the availability of vaccines. 
Due to China’s unwillingness to open 
its borders to these parents, adoptions 
have been stalled for now 2 years. 
Some parents have been prohibited 
from even communicating with their 
children during this time. The Bryans 
from Iowa are unable to receive up-
dated health information about their 
daughter and are unable to send letters 
or care packages. She might not even 
know that they have been trying for 
years to bring Rosie into their family. 
Now, other countries that participate 
in international adoptions have found 
ways to continue the process, even in 
light of COVID. Even countries with 
travel restrictions on other groups 
have made exceptions for adoptive fam-
ilies. Parents want to cooperate. Par-
ents are willing to quarantine. Parents 
are willing to be tested. Parents will 
take every precaution asked of them 
by China. 
Now, what is so odd about all the par-
ents who want to adopt not being al-
lowed into China—we know that China 
has opened the country to athletes par-
ticipating in the Olympics, those wish-
ing to do business there, and to Amer-
ican journalists, but why not to adopt-
ing parents? Tourist visas are still not 
being issued, and adoptive parents are 
being classified as tourists despite spe-
cific reasons for their visit. 
It is imperative that the Biden ad-
ministration work to get adoptions 
from China moving again. These fami-
lies have been waiting long enough. 
The kids whom they are working to 
adopt have been waiting even longer. 
I get a chance to hear from kids in 
foster 
care 
in 
the 
United 
States 
through my role as chairman of the 
Senate Caucus on Foster Youth. I al-
ways hear the same message from 
these young people: They want a mom 
and dad. They want a loving place to 
call home. Kids in China are no dif-
ferent. They deserve a family and safe-
ty and the security of loving parents. 
I pray that the hearts of Chinese 
leaders are softened enough to allow 
these families into the country and 
allow these kids to come home to 
America. 
FILIBUSTER 
Now on another subject, the subject 
of this week in the U.S. Senate about 
whether the 60-vote requirement to 
move legislation ahead should be done 
away with—that is the purpose of com-
ing to the Senate for these remarks. 
Senate procedure is complex enough 
that talking about it often trips up 
even Senators who have been around 
here for several years. Reporters writ-
ing about the so-called filibuster often 
look to past reporting to get their 
bearings. In doing so, they perpetuate a 
conventional wisdom that is false or 
even misleading. 
It is common around here to refer to 
the cloture motion as the Senate fili-
buster. Now, I want all my colleagues 
to know that I am guilty of doing this 
sort of shorthand all the time, and I 
tell myself I ought to not be making 
the same mistake. 
According to the nonpartisan Con-
gressional Research Service: 
Filibustering includes any use of dilatory 
or obstructive tactics to block a measure by 
preventing it from coming to a vote. 
The cloture motion is not the same 
thing as a filibuster, as the Congres-
sional Research Service will also con-
firm. The cloture motion requires 60 
votes to bring consideration of legisla-
tion to finality. That means not just 
debate but, crucially, the amendment 
process. 
Of course, I want to repeat that. The 
effect of invoking cloture is to say that 
the Senate has considered the bill 
enough, meaning a sufficient number of 
amendments have been considered that 
the Senate has a chance to work its 
collective will. 
The Senate was designed by the con-
stitutional Framers to be a delibera-
tive body. In the House, a narrow ma-
jority can pass hastily drafted, poorly 
conceived legislation. 
As political parties have become 
more ideologically polarized, power to 
shape legislation has accrued to the 
House leadership. Individual Members 
of the House of Representatives have 
essentially no opportunity to get a 
vote on bills or amendments unless 
blessed by the Speaker of the House, 
Republican or Democrat. 
The House Rules Committee, filled 
with partisans loyal to the Speaker, 
will draft a very special rule for consid-
ering a specific bill, and that is pos-
sible to detail the number of amend-
ments, if any, allowed to be offered. 
Members of the majority party in the 
House are expected to vote for their 
party’s rule, no matter what. 
The Senate is supposed to be dif-
ferent. It is kind of like what we call 
the cooling saucer, making sure each 
provision in legislation is thought 
through and done as well as we can, 
particularly to overcome some in the 
House of Representatives who act so 
quickly. We also make sure that bills 
work for most States, not just the 
most populous States on the east or 
west coast that tend to dominate the 
House of Representatives. 
So the Senate is different. Each and 
every 
Senator 
represents 
a 
whole 
State, and each Senator has equal 
right to participate in the legislative 
process on behalf of their State. Sen-
ators who would abdicate that right 
are doing a disservice to their State 
and the people they represent. 
In 
the 
2008 
election, 
Democrats 
gained a 60-vote supermajority in the 
Senate, with a Democrat House and 
President Obama. As such, the Senate, 
during those 2 years, tended to act 
kind of like the House does on process. 
The usual deliberative process, with bi-
partisan negotiations and careful refin-
ing and tweaking by committees, all 
went out the window. Major legislation 
was drafted in the Senate Democrat 
leader’s office, often bypassing Senate 
committees. Democrats would then du-
tifully invoke cloture, often with no 
Senate floor amendment process at all. 
So, naturally, those of us who have 
served around the Senate a while were 
astounded at the time that Democrat 
Senators would routinely vote to cut 
off the amendment process before it 
had begun. Surely, they had amend-
ments important to their States that 
they would have liked to have offered, 
but voting for cloture was expected of 
Democrats. They had 60 votes, after 
all. They could do almost anything 
they wanted to. And it turned out just 
like the rule that comes out of the 
Rules Committee, affecting how debate 
happens in the House of Representa-
tives. Now, Democrats did this even if 
it meant giving up their right to offer 
amendments, thus abdicating their re-
sponsibility to represent their home 
States. 
That situation became the norm, 
even when the Democrats lost their 
short-lived 60-vote supermajority. 
Most Senators now serving only 
know the Senate since this break with 
Senate tradition. Despite some im-
provements in recent years, the culture 
of the Senate has not recovered. When 
people say the Senate is broken, the 
problem is not the one Senate rule 
keeping it from becoming just like the 
House of Representatives. In other 
words, it is not the 60-vote requirement 
that has broken the Senate. The prob-
lem is that people expect the Senate to 
act just like the House of Representa-
tives when the Senate is actually in-
tended to be a check on the House. 
Since the most significant effect of 
blowing up the 60-vote cloture rule 
would be denying the right of all Sen-
ators to offer amendments on the Sen-
ate floor, why do people still talk 
about some return to the mythical 
talking filibuster? 
That comes out of confusion over the 
word ‘‘filibuster’’ that I mentioned at 
the start of my remarks today. The 
Senate rules state that in most cases 
during debate on a bill, a Senator may 
speak for as long as that Senator holds 
the floor. That is the rule Jimmy Stew-
art’s character took advantage of to 
delay consideration of a corrupt bill in 
the classic movie ‘‘Mr. Smith Goes to 
Washington.’’ That meets the defini-
tion of a filibuster, but it has nothing 
to do with the cloture rule. Those who 
would argue that Senators ought to 
have to speak nonstop on the Senate

floor until they collapse just to pre-
serve their right to offer an amend-
ment on behalf of their State are either 
confused or being dishonest. 
During the Trump administration, 
reporters routinely sprinkled the word 
falsely in the descriptions of things 
that President Trump said as sort of a 
running fact-check. Reporters ought to 
revise the practice of using the word 
falsely when President Biden and other 
Democrats make demonstrably false 
statements. 
This 
issue, 
of 
course, 
would be a good place to start—and do 
it this week. 
Any reference to some nonexistent, 
totally mythical age of the talking fili-
buster ought to have a disclaimer that 
no such requirement ever existed for a 
60-vote cloture rule. As I mentioned, 
conventional wisdom about the fili-
buster has been distorted by confusion 
and perhaps intentional shell games. 
For Senators or reporters to truly 
understand this issue, I urge you to 
consult the nonpartisan Congressional 
Research Service as your main source. 
RUSSIA 
Madam President, on my last topic, 
Russian dictator Vladimir Putin once 
famously called the collapse of the So-
viet Union ‘‘the greatest geopolitical 
catastrophe of the century.’’ That 
ought to tell you very much. He re-
grets the collapse of the evil empire 
that killed, that tortured, and that re-
pressed millions of Russians, and he is 
in the process of trying to reconstitute 
that empire by threatening Russia’s 
neighbors, regardless of the wishes of 
the people he seeks to rule over. 
Putin is on the precipice of greatly 
escalating his war on Ukraine, upset 
that Ukrainians, as is their right, in-
creasingly seek to leave the Soviet 
past behind them and reclaim their Eu-
ropean heritage. Ukraine wants to 
renew historic ties with their western 
neighbor while building democracy and 
the rule of law. 
Now, we saw over the week, particu-
larly this weekend, Putin sending 
troops into Kazakhstan at the invita-
tion of that country’s allied dictator to 
repress an unexpected popular uprising. 
All this empire building rests on con-
vincing the Russian people that despite 
their misery and his misrule, Putin is 
restoring Russia’s past glory, just like 
they could have a good economic fu-
ture based on that past glory. 
Now, this work of Putin requires a 
war on history. Putin recently gave a 
speech absurdly claiming Ukraine is 
not a real country, based on ignoring— 
or, 
rather, 
Russia’s 
co-opting—the 
much older history of civilization in 
Ukraine. 
He has also rehabilitated the memory 
of the sadistic mass murderer Joseph 
Stalin. There is a book about how 
Putin’s Russia views the Stalinist past. 
Its title says it all. The title of the 
book is ‘‘It Was a Long Time Ago, and 
It Never Happened Anyway.’’ Now they 
have taken action in recent weeks to 
make sure that history of Russia’s 
past, particularly the abuse of its popu-
lation, never is known. And I will cover 
that in just a minute. 
Stalin’s horrific crimes against the 
Russian people are a big obstacle to 
Putin’s narrative about the Soviet 
Union, as part of some sort of a proud 
Russian imperial tradition. So it comes 
as no surprise that Putin’s regime has 
forced the closure of a respected Rus-
sian human rights organization dedi-
cated to the truth—the truth—about 
the victims of Soviet communism. 
The independent human rights orga-
nization known as Memorial was co-
founded by Nobel Peace Prize winner 
Andrei Sakharov in the waning days of 
the Soviet Union. Sakharov was a 
brave dissident who risked everything 
to call attention to the evils of the So-
viet system. As some of my colleagues 
may recall, I led the effort in this U.S. 
Senate to name the street in front of 
the old Soviet Embassy in his Honor— 
Sakharov Plaza. 
When the Soviet Union collapsed, 
Sakharov embodied the hope of a 
brighter, more democratic future for 
all of Russia, built on understanding 
and reckoning with its past. 
The forced closure of Memorial after 
decades of noble work to bring aware-
ness and to bring healing around the 
victims of Soviet communism is em-
blematic of the state of Putin’s Russia, 
but not the state of the Russian people. 
Moreover, the next day, he moved even 
further in this direction of trying to re-
write history or stop the truth from 
coming out. Putin shut down the sepa-
rate but related Memorial Human 
Rights Center, which focused on polit-
ical prisoners this very day who are 
being abused under Putin’s regime. 
This is a major setback for what is left 
of Russia’s civil society that started to 
emerge out of the wreckage of com-
munism. 
A robust civil society will be essen-
tial if Russia is ever to become a free, 
prosperous modern nation. Today, only 
President Putin stands in the way of 
that accomplishment.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.

proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BIDEN ADMINISTRATION 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, in 
recent 
years, 
our 
Democratic 
col-
leagues have taken their Washington- 
knows-best approach to governing to 
new and, frankly, frightening levels. 
Our colleagues have tried to give the 
IRS unprecedented authority and man-
power to snoop into the finances of vir-
tually every American, not just what 
you make but how you spend your 
money. 
They have attempted to control what 
type of childcare families can access, 
saying that if it is faith-based, that it 
is not going to qualify for the extrava-
gant subsidies they have proposed, and 
are driving up the costs for average, 
hard-working Texas families. 
When it comes to our Democratic 
colleagues 
and 
their 
Washington- 
knows-best attitude, they have tried to 
force every person in this country into 
a one-size-fits-all healthcare system 
that, yes, government controls. They 
have argued that the President of the 
United States has the power to force 
all Americans, including those in the 
private sector, to get a vaccine regard-
less of whether they have naturally oc-
curring antibodies as a result of having 
gotten COVID–19. 
Now, they are mounting a Federal 
takeover of America’s State-run elec-
tions. That is what we will be talking 
about a lot this week. 
As I said, this is consistent with this 
attitude that Washington knows best, 
not parents, not teachers, not business 
owners, not the workers, not even Gov-
ernors, mayors, sheriffs, city councils, 
or local election officials. No. Wash-
ington knows best, is their attitude. 
To state the obvious, that is not how 
the United States of America was de-
signed under our Constitution. During 
the time of the founding, there was a 
lot of discussion of whether to have a 
national government or whether to 
have a Federal Government with the 
States as sovereign entities, subject 
only to national laws when the Federal 
Government 
preempted 
them 
with 
things like the Voting Rights Act, sec-
tion 5. In fact, our very form of govern-
ment was designed with checks and 
balances and dispersed authority pri-
marily to protect the individual free-
dom of ‘‘we the people.’’ 
Our Founders had the wisdom to de-
vise a system of government comprised 
of three separate branches—coequal— 
to ensure that no single person or sin-
gle institution became too powerful be-
cause, again, they viewed it as, the 
more powerful that single entity or 
single institution became, the less ac-
countable they would be to the people 
and the less freedom we would have to 
conduct our own lives as we see fit. 
But, as we know, it is not just dis-
tributed laterally among the various 
branches; it is distributed vertically as 
well. The Constitution makes clear 
that the States retain all authority not 
delegated to the Federal Government. 
That is the Tenth Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution. 
Of course, the power given to the 
States is sometimes set forth explic-
itly. For example, the Constitution 
gives the States the authority to set 
the time, place, and manner of elec-
tions. That is in the Constitution 
itself. Others are reserved under the 
Tenth Amendment. 
Now, make no mistake, the Federal 
Government has very, very important 
responsibilities. When it comes to our 
national defense, when it comes to reg-
ulating interstate commerce, inter-
national 
diplomacy, 
setting 
taxes,

January 10, 2022 
managing our national debt and defi-
cits, the Federal Government should 
and must take the lead. But this is 
simply not a monarchy. It is not an au-
thoritarian form of government that 
we see in other parts of the world. Our 
government is not top-down; it is bot-
tom-up when it comes to the distribu-
tion of powers. The Federal Govern-
ment was not designed to authorize 
anyone, including the President of the 
United States, the authority to hand 
down sweeping mandates for the people 
of this country. 
Thomas 
Jefferson 
famously 
said, 
‘‘The government closest to the people 
serves the people best,’’ and that is 
how he described the benefits of this 
bottom-up form of government rather 
than top-down, Washington-knows-best 
form of government that our Demo-
cratic colleagues seem to embrace al-
most across the board. For everything 
from healthcare to elections, our col-
leagues across the aisle have attempted 
to make prescriptive decisions against 
every State, city, and community 
across the country. By ‘‘prescriptive 
decisions,’’ I mean to tie the hands or 
to say ‘‘jump’’ and expect the States 
and local governments to ask ‘‘how 
high?’’ 
But we are already beginning to see 
cracks in this strategy. When it has be-
come clear that Washington doesn’t 
really know best, the Democrats have 
another idea: Blame somebody else. 
Just look at the Federal Government’s 
response to the pandemic of COVID–19. 
President Biden ran on a promise of a 
strong pandemic response by the Fed-
eral Government. He promised to make 
free 
testing 
widely 
available. 
He 
pledged to stop the misinformation 
that has led to widespread confusion 
about the virus, and he has vowed that 
public health decisions would be made 
by public health professionals and 
would not be based on political consid-
erations. 
Looking back, it is clear the Amer-
ican people were sold snake oil. As 
folks across the country can attest, 
free testing may exist, but you can’t 
find an appointment to get one of those 
tests. Rapid tests are in short supply, 
and even then, the cost is too high for 
many families. 
The information coming from the 
Centers for Disease Control is pro-
viding the American people with more 
questions than answers. In the words of 
one New York Times columnist, ‘‘The 
highest-ranking public health officials 
are making statements that seem more 
aimed at covering up or making ex-
cuses for ongoing failures rather than 
leveling with the public.’’ 
The administration has sided with 
political allies instead of the science. 
Last February, the CDC released a re-
port that said schools are not breeding 
grounds for COVID–19, and as long as 
precautions are taken, schools can re-
open safely. That was last February. 
But the science was at odds with the 
demands of teachers unions, so the ad-
ministration 
refused 
to 
encourage 
State and local leaders to reopen their 
schools. 
So how is the President reacting in 
light of these broken promises and a 
failed pandemic response? 
In a debate in October 2020, then-Can-
didate Biden talked about the previous 
administration’s 
pandemic 
response 
and the fact that more than 220,000 
Americans had died. That was in Octo-
ber of 2020. He said anyone who is re-
sponsible for that many deaths should 
not remain President of the United 
States. 
Well, today, we have lost more than 
830,000 of our fellow Americans to this 
virus. That is nearly three times as 
many deaths as there were under the 
previous President’s watch, but Presi-
dent Biden isn’t stepping down. In fact, 
now he claims the Federal Government 
isn’t even responsible. Just a couple of 
weeks ago, President Biden pushed re-
sponsibility on to the States, saying 
there is no Federal solution; this gets 
solved at the State level. This is 
enough to give you whiplash—the radi-
cally changing, diametrically opposed 
positions of this administration and 
the President of the United States. 
As it turns out, our colleagues only 
want Big Government when Big Gov-
ernment is consistent with their polit-
ical objectives. If the promise of a 
strong Federal response to a deadly 
pandemic can help them win an elec-
tion, well, they are all for it, but when 
they fail to plan and execute a strong 
response, they are quick to pass the re-
sponsibility and the blame on to some-
one else. 
Well, our Federal form of govern-
ment isn’t a system that can be gamed 
to benefit politicians when it is con-
venient and skirt responsibility when 
things go awry, but, unfortunately, 
that looks like where we are today, and 
the Democrats clearly view the cal-
culus as leaning in their favor when it 
comes to their election takeover bills 
that we will be voting on this week. 
Our colleagues have made repeated 
attempts to overhaul our Nation’s elec-
tions and give the Federal Government 
unprecedented power to manage Amer-
ica’s elections. 
There was a Pew poll taken on No-
vember 20, 2020, asking people whether 
they found, in the election, it was easy 
or hard to vote, and 94 percent of the 
respondents said they found it either 
extremely easy or easy to vote—94 per-
cent in the last election of November 
2020. 
In Texas, we had 11.3 million people 
vote—66 percent of registered voters— 
which was a consistent percentage 
across the country. There were historic 
turnouts in the election. Yet our 
Democratic colleagues want to fix a 
system that is not broken because it 
allows everyone, of every political 
stripe, of every race, of every eth-
nicity, and of every background, an 
equal opportunity to cast a ballot. 
In Texas, you can vote for up to 2 
weeks before election day itself, in per-
son—2 weeks. The Justice Department 
has sued Texas, saying that it somehow 
discriminates against people getting 
access to the ballot. That is a lawsuit 
that the Justice Department will lose 
because the facts simply do not dem-
onstrate it. 
Again, 94 percent of the people in this 
Pew poll of November 20, 2020, after the 
last election, said they found it either 
extremely easy or easy to cast their 
ballot. So our Democratic colleagues 
are simply flying into a headwind when 
it comes to their argument that, some-
how, it is not easy to cast your ballot. 
But there are some places where it is 
easier to vote than in others. For ex-
ample, it is easier to vote in Georgia 
and in Texas under current law than it 
has been in the President’s State of 
Delaware, which, until this year, did 
not allow any early voting in person. 
You don’t hear the majority leader and 
you don’t hear Democratic colleagues 
talking about States like Delaware, 
which offered, until this year, zero op-
portunity for early voting in person; 
whereas Texas and Georgia, even after 
the election reforms they passed, still 
offer 2 weeks of early in-person voting. 
So our Democratic colleagues’ expla-
nation has changed over time. They 
argue that Washington knows best and 
that all of the State-run elections 
should be subsumed into a Federal sys-
tem of elections. At one point, they 
said it was a matter of election secu-
rity. Then they said: Well, no; it is 
really about voter confidence. Then 
they said, which is, I think, their cur-
rent position, that only a national sys-
tem can remove obstacles that prevent 
people from voting. 
Well, when I said this was a solution 
in search of a problem, I was referring 
to that November 20, 2020, poll wherein 
94 percent of the respondents said they 
found it easy to vote or very easy to 
vote. Clearly, again, our Democratic 
colleagues are looking for a problem or 
have offered a solution in search of a 
problem. 
Among 
the 
proposals 
they 
have 
made, this is not about just making it 
easier to vote and harder to cheat; they 
are saying that this is somehow in re-
sponse to the horrific attacks that oc-
curred on the Capitol on January 6 of 
last year. They just keep throwing the 
spaghetti on the wall to see what 
sticks. For example, among the many 
proposed changes that they have of-
fered, they say they want to turn the 
bipartisan Federal Election Commis-
sion into a Democratic-controlled, par-
tisan commission, and then they want 
to seize the authority given under the 
Constitution for the States to draw 
their own congressional lines, instead 
handing all power to an unelected and 
unaccountable redistricting commis-
sion. 
They have also tried to mandate bal-
lot harvesting on the States—a prac-
tice that allows paid campaign staff 
and political operatives to collect 
mail-in ballots, to perhaps go by the 
local nursing home and collect ballots 
from folks in the nursing home and to

turn them in. This has been shown to 
be a recipe for mischief and election 
fraud. 
Yet 
they 
want 
to 
institu-
tionalize it, and they want to say that 
the States cannot prohibit it. 
These proposals would do more to 
protect our Democratic colleagues’ 
jobs than to safeguard American voting 
rights. 
What really concerns me and, I imag-
ine, the American people as they learn 
more and more about what is in these 
bills is how much damage the Demo-
cratic Party is willing to do in order to 
secure a partisan victory. Not only are 
our colleagues trying to seize the au-
thority given under the Constitution to 
the States to manage their own elec-
tions, they are willing to take a wreck-
ing ball to the U.S. Senate itself and 
particularly the Senate rules. Some-
how, protecting the foundation of our 
democracy has turned into ignoring 
the Constitution and blowing up this 
institution. 
I need to clarify that not all 50 Sen-
ate Democrats are on board with this 
plan. Thank goodness, two of our col-
leagues have been clear in their out-
right opposition to eliminating or 
weakening the filibuster—the require-
ment that legislation, before it passes, 
must have bipartisan support rather 
than purely partisan bills like our 
Democratic colleagues want to pass 
without any support on the Republican 
side. 
While there are two of our Senate 
colleagues from West Virginia and Ari-
zona who have been public about their 
opposition to blowing up the Senate 
and to breaking Senate rules in order 
to accomplish a partisan objective, I 
imagine there are others unnamed who 
share the same concerns privately. 
I hope our friends on the other side of 
the aisle will remain steadfast in their 
commitment to our Constitution and 
the norms and rules of this institution. 
If our colleagues are willing to go this 
far in the pursuit of raw political 
power, I would hate to think about how 
they would use it if they were to suc-
ceed. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ELECTIONS 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, when Tennesseans go to the polls 
and cast their vote, they do so with the 
hope that the person whose name ap-
pears on their ballot will do what is 
best for their community. They expect 
that person to show respect for the 
Constitution and the rule of law and to 
protect the integrity of our most im-
portant institutions. 
The people place a great deal of trust 
in us, and I don’t think it is too much 
to ask that we return the favor by rec-
ognizing that there are limits to how 
far the Federal Government can expand 
its reach. Many of my Democratic col-
leagues, however, would disagree with 
me on that premise. They returned to 
Washington this week ready to squan-
der the people’s trust on yet another 
power grab. 
The election bill they are prepared to 
break the Senate rules to pass has 
failed multiple times, under multiple 
titles, and in different packaging. This 
has gone on for the last 20 years. But 
this latest round has one thing in com-
mon with all the other drafts that 
found their rightful place in the trash 
can: It has nothing to do with pro-
tecting the ballot box. 
This is not a voting rights bill; it is 
a sweeping takeover of our democracy 
and a shocking attack on the constitu-
tional authority of the States to deter-
mine the time, place, and manner of 
elections. That is right. This is not in 
statute; it is article I, section 4 of the 
Constitution. 
I have said it before. I will say it 
again. These proposals read like some-
thing concocted by someone who has 
never stepped foot behind the scenes of 
their local polling place. It is con-
cocted by people who probably have 
never spent 10 minutes as a poll worker 
carrying out and implementing an 
election, and they absolutely have 
never served a term on a local election 
commission. 
It seems that our friends across the 
aisle are looking at all of these local 
elected and appointed officials who 
work elections and are saying: We 
think that you just are incapable and 
inept to carry out an election. 
How disrespectful can you be? 
The Federal Government has got to 
come in and save the day and take 
away the ability of your local elections 
registrar to carry forward an election. 
I hope my colleagues will think 
about the message that they are send-
ing because there is nothing in these 
proposals that would help your State 
and local leaders secure elections, and, 
in fact, many provisions would actu-
ally weaken the checks already in 
place against voter fraud. 
This is the opposite of how it should 
be. It should be easy to vote and hard 
to cheat, not the other way around. 
And the people of this country and 
elected leaders have been saying no to 
the Federal takeover of elections for 
the past 20 years. But here we are again 
having to once again stand up against 
this desperate attempt to undermine 
voters and empower cheats and crimi-
nals by mandating ballot harvesting 
while rejecting voter ID requirements. 
That is in their bill—got to do it, got 
to allow ballot harvesting. That is 
where shenanigans happen. 
We can’t have voter ID require-
ments—no, no, no. We don’t want any-
body at the ballot box having to prove 
who they are. But be ready to show 
that ID if you want to get on a plane, 
if you want to get in a government 
building, if you want to go buy a bottle 
of wine. Be ready to show that ID, 
prove your age, and prove who you are. 
Their bill would also centralize power 
over elections in the hands of faceless, 
unaccountable 
bureaucrats—that 
is 
right—not your friends and neighbors 
working the polls and making decisions 
and serving on local election commis-
sions. You will never know the people 
who say, ‘‘Hey, you are too stupid to 
figure out how to run these elections,’’ 
because the Democrats are going to 
take all the power and authority away 
from your local friends and neighbors 
and send it to bureaucrats here in DC. 
And they would embrace a one-size- 
fits-all rule book that any seasoned 
election worker knows will throw poll-
ing places into chaos. 
In my home county in Tennessee, we 
have people who have worked these 
polls for years. They are dedicated. 
They are good people. I don’t know 
their political party. I just know that 
they show up to make certain that our 
elections are free and fair, and I appre-
ciate them. 
Since the first iteration of this bill 
reared its head, the American people 
have seen it for what it is: an activist- 
driven, 
power-hungry 
solution 
in 
search of problems that do not exist. 
That is right; the problems don’t exist. 
The Democrats want you to believe 
that America as we know it will end if 
they don’t pass this bill. They are act-
ing like elections are in crisis. But do 
you know what? I think maybe it is the 
Democratic Party that is in crisis. 
They are staring at decades-high infla-
tion, crime spikes, cascading public 
health failures, a southern border on 
the verge of collapse, embarrassing ap-
proval ratings, infighting so intense 
that watching the nightly news feels 
like you are watching a soap opera. 
They can’t get their arms around 
COVID. They can’t figure it out. I just 
heard coming over here that the CDC is 
now going to mandate that insurance 
companies have to supply home testing 
kits for all of their enrollees. I mean, 
yeah, I think it is a party in crisis. And 
do you know what? The Democrats 
right now, they are desperate for a dis-
traction. Oh, just give them something 
to change the narrative. And the ben-
efit of this one, if they could pull this 
off, is that they won’t have to worry 
about the American people holding 
them accountable for the fallout be-
cause they now will control the ballot 
process; they will control the election 
commissions. 
And do you know what they are say-
ing to the American public? Your vote 
doesn’t count. 
We have treasured one person, one 
vote. We have treasured fair, free, hon-
est elections. And the Democrats are 
ready to throw it away for a power 
grab that is unprecedented and is in-
credibly disrespectful of the men and 
women in each of our counties who 
give of their time and work to hold 
these elections. 
This is more than just another exam-
ple of partisanship holding the Senate

hostage. And it is partisanship. It is 
‘‘We have to do this, take away power 
from the people.’’ 
Oh, isn’t it supposed to be a govern-
ment of the people, by the people, and 
for the people? But, oh, I think my col-
leagues across the aisle have forgotten 
that. They think it is government for 
the powerful, government that is in 
control of one party and one party’s 
agenda. That is what they are think-
ing. 
This attack on the integrity of our 
elections is a complete betrayal of the 
trust that the people have given elect-
ed officials because we have colleagues 
across the aisle who are basically look-
ing at their constituents in their var-
ious States and saying: Your opinion 
does not count. 
Think about that. 
You are not good enough. You are 
not smart enough. You can’t handle it. 
So, hey—Federal Government—we are 
going to come and save you from your-
selves. That is what they think. 
It is their constitutional prerogative 
to determine the time, place, and man-
ner of their own elections. That is what 
is given to the State legislatures. It is 
their prerogative, and it is not the job 
of Congress or the President or a bat-
talion of unelected, faceless, nameless, 
unaccountable 
bureaucrats 
to 
burn 
down the goalposts when things at the 
ballot box don’t go their way. But that 
is exactly what the Democratic Party 
is trying to do this week. 
So you never will be able to complain 
to them. They want to hold all the 
cards. The purpose of this latest power 
grab isn’t to make the people feel se-
cure. Its purpose is to inject hysteria 
into what should be a very serious con-
versation about actually protecting the 
vote. 
Everything the people hear from the 
Democrats this week will have been 
scripted to minimize truth and maxi-
mize chaos. Remember, they want you 
to believe that elections are in crisis. 
‘‘We have to fix it.’’ 
But, fortunately, Tennesseans and 
the American people know better than 
to believe what they are hearing on the 
nightly news and to believe what is 
coming from the Democratic Party. 
They also know there is only one rea-
son a political party would work this 
hard to make elections easier for them 
to manipulate.

TRIBUTE TO JACK BRAMMER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
when Jack Brammer interviewed me in 
1984 for one of the first profile pieces of 
my political career, I quickly saw the 
high quality of his reporting. He was 
even-handed, fair, and honest—and has 
remained so throughout his 43 year ca-
reer as the Lexington Herald-Leader’s 
statehouse reporter. Jack has always 
been among the best journalists in the 
Commonwealth. Today, in honor of his 
retirement, I recognize him for stand-
ing at the pinnacle of Kentucky jour-
nalism for over four decades. 
Jack Brammer is a lifelong Ken-
tuckian. A native of Maysville, he 
joined the Lexington Herald-Leader in 
1978 and has covered State politics ever 
since. We met in 1984 during my initial 
race for the U.S. Senate. Though many 
considered me an underdog, facing off 
against an entrenched incumbent, Jack 
took extensive time to interview me 
for his Herald-Leader profile. He even 
visited my parents in Shelbyville, sit-
ting with them for hours to discuss my 
background and upbringing. 
In today’s era of journalism, when so 
much reporting takes place via text, 
tweet, 
and 
email, 
Jack’s 
methods 
might seem startlingly old-fashioned. 
But he kept up his same dogged style, 
always going above and beyond to de-
liver the complete, unabridged truth to 
Kentuckians. He is a journalist in the 
best mold of the profession: unafraid to 
report the facts, presented without edi-
torializing, and allowing his readers to 
come to their own conclusions. I will 
miss Jack’s steadfast commitment to 
the truth, which can often seem sorely 
lacking in today’s fast-paced, cut-
throat media industry. 
In his 43 years on the statehouse 
beat, Jack covered nearly every major

January 10, 2022 
moment in Kentucky politics. Like me, 
he has a deep passion for our Common-
wealth’s history and has made critical 
contributions to the historical record 
through his reporting. He had a front- 
row seat to 10 gubernatorial adminis-
trations, dozens of legislative sessions, 
and 
countless 
significant 
political 
events. 
His 
deep, hard-won under-
standing of Kentucky politics sets him 
apart from nearly every other jour-
nalist in our State. I know everyone in 
the statehouse, from other journalists 
to legislators, to the general public, 
will miss him. 
During Jack’s retirement, I feel con-
fident he will continue to share the 
wealth of wisdom he acquired over his 
legendary career. Jack has always been 
an enthusiastic mentor for younger 
journalists, taking generations of re-
porters under his wing to teach them 
the ropes of Kentucky State politics. 
As a graduate of the University of Ken-
tucky and a member of their Jour-
nalism Hall of Fame, he has also spent 
time imparting his knowledge to the 
Commonwealth’s future communica-
tions professionals. Even in retirement, 
he will continue to make a mark on 
our State. 
I will miss Jack’s reporting dearly. 
He represents the best of the journal-
istic profession, and Kentuckians have 
been fortunate to read his writing for 
more than four decades. I wish him 
well in his upcoming endeavors and 
look forward to learning what his fu-
ture holds. I would like to express my 
personal gratitude for Jack Brammer’s 
many years of service to the Common-
wealth and encourage my Senate col-
leagues to join me in congratulating 
him on his well-earned retirement. 
Madam President, Jack Brammer re-
cently wrote an article in the Lex-
ington Herald-Leader reflecting on his 
career. I ask unanimous consent the 
article be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Jan. 2, 
2022] 
‘THEY SAY HE LOVED THAT PLACE.’ MEMORIES 
OF WORKING 43+ YEARS IN KENTUCKY’S CAP-
ITOL 
My mamaw, Bessie Price, often told me as 
a kid growing up in Mason County about 
once visiting a relative who had worked in 
the Kentucky Capitol. 
Mamaw, a tenant farmer’s wife who was 
rarely seen without an apron tied around her 
except when she was in church, didn’t travel 
far from home in her life but the journey to 
the Capitol made a lasting impression on 
her. 
‘‘Oh, my, it’s a grand building,’’ she would 
say with a sparkle in her eyes. ‘‘I’m not sure 
if he was a janitor or a repair man. I once 
visited him there and I thought how mar-
velous it would be to work there. How 
blessed that would be.’’ 
How marvelous has it been for me to work 
more than 43 years in Kentucky’s Capitol as 
a newspaperman for the Lexington Herald- 
Leader. 
I have enough memories of the place to 
last—and comfort—me the rest of my days. 
SPECTACLES IN THE CAPITOL 
The Capitol often is the scene of news spec-
tacles with hundreds, sometimes thousands, 
of people. Remember all the teachers at the 
Capitol in 2018 and 2019 to advocate for edu-
cation funding and protest teacher pensions? 
The most spectacular events at the Capitol 
are the inaugurations of governors. I have 
covered 10 Kentucky governors—from Julian 
Carroll to Andy Beshear. 
Inauguration Day is filled with pomp and 
pageantry. The morning parades with high 
school bands marching down Capital Avenue. 
The dignified swearing-in ceremonies in the 
afternoon, and the elegant inaugural balls in 
the evening. 
When you see the new governor and first 
lady (or first husband, as was the case with 
Dr. Bill Collins when his wife, Martha Layne 
Collins, became Kentucky’s first and only fe-
male governor in 1983) swirl in an embrace 
about the Rotunda floor to the melodies of a 
fine orchestra on inauguration night, it’s 
like seeing a fairy tale come alive. 
Each Inauguration Day has its own person-
ality. 
Certainly no inauguration was like that of 
Gov. John Y. Brown Jr. in 1979. Brown and 
his famous wife, Phyllis George, invited a 
host of celebrities to their celebration. Who 
could ever forget the Dallas Cowboy cheer-
leaders in their certainly warm-weather out-
fits in the middle of December in Kentucky? 
FAMOUS PERSONALITIES IN THE CAPITOL 
Famous people sometimes visit the Capitol 
as guests of governors or the legislature. 
Heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali 
came calling. He once held court over a 
group of reporters outside the governor’s of-
fice. Soon the conversation turned to former 
Gov. A.B. ‘‘Happy’’ Chandler, who, in a meet-
ing of the University of Kentucky’s board of 
trustees on April 5, 1988 to discuss UK’s deci-
sion to dispose of its investments in South 
Africa, said, ‘‘You know Zimbabwe’s all n—— 
now. There aren’t any whites.’’ 
Chandler’s remark created a national 
firestorm. Ali questioned the reporters in the 
Capitol on whether any of them had ever ut-
tered—or even thought—that controversial 
word. 
Other special guests at the Capitol over 
the years included singer Billy Ray Cyrus 
leading the Kentucky House in a rousing 
rendition of ‘‘Achy Breaky Heart,’’ Sally 
Ride as the first American woman in space, 
songwriter Tom T. Hall entertaining a group 
of lawmakers in the Speaker’s office with 
‘‘(Old 
Dogs, 
Children 
and) 
Watermelon 
Wine,’’ Andy Williams launching into ‘‘Moon 
River,’’ and actress Jennifer Garner speaking 
on the Senate floor about a charity for chil-
dren. 
And then there was Victoria Principal, an 
actress on the TV series ‘‘Dallas’’ that cap-
tivated audiences in 1986 when she saw in a 
scene dubbed ‘‘In Her Dreams’’ her sup-
posedly dead husband in a shower. 
During a news conference at the Capitol, 
Principal was asked by a Kentucky reporter 
if she were going to continue acting. 
‘‘In your dreams,’’ she purred as the re-
porter (with the initials JB) turned as red as 
a Kentucky cardinal. 
Once, an animal was a guest at the Capitol 
who became semi-famous. The Newport 
Aquarium brought to the Senate in October 
2013 a penguin that got excited and used the 
bathroom on the floor next to the desk of 
then-Senate President David Williams. 
My first paragraph of the story summed it 
up: ‘‘A penguin pooped Tuesday on the Sen-
ate floor near the desk of Senate President 
David Williams.’’ 
POWERFUL SPEECHES IN THE CAPITOL 
Speeches are plentiful in the Capitol—from 
State of the Commonwealth addresses by 
governors to pleas from lawmakers seeking 
support for their legislation. 
Two powerful speeches over the years come 
to mind. Both were in the legislature. Both 
changed votes. 
Bobby Richardson, a Glasgow attorney, 
was House majority leader from 1976 to 1982 
and House Speaker from 1982 to 1985. 
One of his finest moments came when he 
gave a floor speech on a bill to prohibit in 
vitro fertilization in Kentucky. It is a com-
plex series of procedures used to help with 
fertility and the influential Kentucky Right 
to Life opposed it because of the possibility 
that some fertilized eggs might be destroyed. 
Richardson took the lead on opposing the 
bill. He gave a powerful speech, saying the 
technology was a wonderful way for a child-
less couple to become parents. He was suc-
cessful. 
In the late 1980s, many legislators thought 
AIDS was an affliction of homosexuals. 
Belinda Mason changed minds about the 
disease when she informed House members 
that she had contracted it from a January 
1987 blood transfusion during the birth of her 
second child. 
The daughter of Democratic state Rep. 
Paul Mason of Whitesburg, who was a strong 
advocate for the poor, died in 1991 from 
AIDS. 
SAD TIMES IN THE CAPITOL 
The most solemn events in the Capitol 
have been the lying in state of famous Ken-
tuckians in the Rotunda. 
In my time, they have included Col. 
Harland Sanders in 1980, Gov. A.B. ‘‘Happy’’ 
Chandler in 1991, Gov. Bert T. Combs in 1991, 
Gov. Lawrence W. Wetherby in 1994, Legisla-
tive Research Commission executive director 
Vic Hellard in 1996, Chief Justice Robert Ste-
phens 
in 
2002, 
Gov. 
Edward T. ‘‘Ned’’ 
Breathitt in 2003, Gov. Louie B. Nunn in 2004, 
Supreme Court Justice William McAnulty 
Jr. in 2008, Gov. and U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford 
in 2015 and state Sen. Georgia Davis Powers 
in 2016. 
One of the saddest was in 2012, when Gov. 
Steve Beshear’s chief of staff, Mike Haydon, 
unexpectedly died of a heart attack at age 
62. 
The saddest death I know of in the Capitol 
was in October 1983. Sy Ramsey, Frankfort 
correspondent for the Associated Press since 
1962, was found dead in his second-floor of-
fice. 
Ramsey, 59, was a mentor. We had roomed 
together in New York City to cover the 1980 
Democratic presidential convention. 
PEOPLE IN THE CAPITOL 
Oh, the people I’ve met along the way— 
from governors, other constitutional offi-
cers, legislators, judges, state employees 
from agency heads to janitors, lobbyists and 
my media colleagues. 
Mike Moloney of Lexington was a tough 
state senator who had little sympathy for 
state officials who appeared before his budg-
et committee unable to answer questions 
about their offices’ spending. 
One reporter dubbed him but never told 
him to his face that his media nickname was 
‘‘the Bobby Knight of the Kentucky General 
Assembly.’’ 
But that reporter—also with the initials 
JB—will always be indebted to the senator 
for being willing to meet with him on Friday 
mornings in the Annex cafeteria during leg-
islative sessions to talk off the record about 
politics and government. Those conversa-
tions provided good information about the 
workings of the legislature. 
Another favored legislator was House 
Speaker William Kenton. He was nicknamed 
‘‘Boom Boom’’ for his booming voice. He 
wanted to be governor. He also regularly 
broke wooden gavels when he pounded them 
at his desk to get order in the House. Splin-
ters flew everywhere. Maybe our affinity had 
something to do with both of us hailing from 
Maysville. 
A source of joy has been witnessing so 
many of my work colleagues in the Frank-
fort bureau going on to stellar careers. Diana

LIFE WITHOUT THE CAPITOL 
I will miss the Capitol, even the late nights 
in the frenetic final hours of a legislative 
session. I started working there in my 20s. I 
leave it in my 70s. 
Perhaps a future relative of mine some day 
will say something nice about his or her next 
of kin who once reported, pondered, wrote, 
laughed and cried in the Kentucky Capitol. 
I hope that person says of me and the place 
I worked, ‘‘They say he called it a grand 
building, filled with spectacles and news and, 
most importantly, interesting people. 
‘‘They say he loved that place.’’

POLICY JUSTIFICATION 
France—MQ–9 Follow-on Contractor 
Logistics Support 
The Government of France has requested 
to buy follow-on Contractor Logistics Sup-
port to include contractor provided MQ–9 
aircraft components, spares and accessories; 
repair and return; software and software sup-
port services; simulator software; personnel 
training and training equipment; publica-
tions and technical documentation; U.S. 
Government and contractor provided engi-
neering, technical and logistical support 
services; and other related elements of 
logistical and program support. The esti-
mated total cost is $300 million. 
This proposed sale will support the foreign 
policy and national security objectives of 
the United States by helping to improve the 
security of a NATO ally that is an important 
force for political stability and economic 
progress in Europe. 
The proposed sale will improve France’s 
capability 
to 
meet 
current 
and 
future 
threats by ensuring the operational readi-
ness of the French Air Force. France’s MQ– 
9 aircraft fleet provides Intelligence, Surveil-
lance, and Reconnaissance support that di-
rectly supports U.S. and coalition operations 
around the world. France will have no dif-
ficulty absorbing these support services into 
its armed forces. 
The proposed sale of this equipment and 
support will not alter the basic military bal-
ance in the region. 
The principal contractor will be General 
Atomics, Poway, CA. There are no known 
offset agreements proposed in connection 
with this potential sale. 
Implementation of this proposed sale will 
not require the assignment of any additional 
U.S. Government or contractor representa-
tives to France. 
There will be no adverse impact on U.S. de-
fense readiness as a result of this proposed 
sale.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
TRIBUTE TO SPRINGDALE POLICE 
CHIEF MIKE PETERS 
∑ Mr. BOOZMAN. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize Springdale Po-
lice Chief Mike Peters, who spent his 
career serving his community with un-
wavering commitment. His retirement 
as chief of the Springdale Police De-
partment will surely leave big shoes to 
fill. 
Chief Peters’ dedication to his job is 
a testament to his character and cour-
age, beginning with his pledge to serve 
his country in the U.S. Army. Being in 
uniform for more than 5 years taught 
him countless lessons about the impor-
tance of leading by example and serv-
ing others. That service helped shape 
him into the leader he is today and 
gave him the tools to build a 30-year 
career in the Springdale Police Depart-
ment. 
Peters’ Arkansas roots also helped 
inspire him to stay in the Natural 
State and serve his community. He 
graduated from the University of Ar-
kansas and demonstrated his abilities 
in service and in the classroom, which 
helped his career advancement. 
After his time in the Army and the 
Arkansas 
National 
Guard, 
Peters 
worked in investigations and drug en-
forcement. He thrived in this role and 
was promoted to sergeant in 1998. After 
working as a shift supervisor for 4 
years, he was promoted to Lieutenant 
in 2001 and then captain in 2004. His 
clear devotion to the force and record 
of time and time again sacrificing for 
his community allowed him to advance 
quickly. Peters’ served rotations in ad-
ministration, patrol, and investiga-
tions before being promoted to Spring-
dale chief of police on September 11, 
2015. 
His accomplishments and accolades 
have been plentiful and essential, in-
cluding the design and construction of 
the Criminal Justice Complex, which 
houses the new police department and 
district court and its offices; grad-
uating from the FBI National Acad-
emy; and memberships within the 
International Association of Chiefs of 
Police, the Arkansas Association of 
Chiefs of Police, and the FBI National 
Academy Association.

January 10, 2022 
Chief Peters is known for being a 
strong leader who truly cared for those 
under him. ‘‘It’s his leadership and how 
he brings up others beneath him to 
build on what the department has done 
and advance the department,’’ Spring-
dale Mayor Doug Sprouse said about 
his service. 
Peters’ long and extremely successful 
career is representative of so much of 
our law enforcement across the State 
and the Nation. I am so thankful and 
proud of the men and women in blue 
who serve their communities everyday 
by keeping citizens safe and providing 
them vital support and assistance. I 
congratulate Chief Peters on the in-
credible impact he has left on Spring-
dale and his fellow members of the 
Springdale Police Department. I wish 
him luck in his next endeavor.∑

TRIBUTE TO CAITLIN-MCGRATH 
LEVESQUE OF PORTSMOUTH 
∑
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
am 
honored 
to 
recognize 
Caitlin 
McGrath-Levesque of Portsmouth as 
December’s 
Granite 
Stater 
of 
the 
Month. Following the death of her 
youngest brother, Caitlin and her two 
siblings turned their grief into action 
by creating a nonprofit in his honor to 
provide free, hot meals to those in 
need. 
Caitlin’s late brother—who went by 
‘‘Red’’—was an avid volunteer in the 
Seacoast area. After he died, Caitlin 
and her siblings decided that the best 
way to honor their brother was by giv-
ing back to their community. 
Following a $100 donation from each 
of the siblings, Red’s Good Vibes was 
officially born. 
Red’s Good Vibes consists of one food 
truck—with a second one on the way— 
that travels around the Seacoast to 
communities with the most need. The 
nonprofit collects monetary donations, 
as well as utilizes relationships with 
the NH Food Bank, local restaurants, 
and grocery stores, which allows them 
to service communities 3 days a week 
with the help of dedicated volunteers. 
For Caitlin and her siblings, one of 
the most important goals of Red’s 
Good Vibes is to make sure that all cli-
ents are treated with the utmost re-
spect and dignity. 
In that vein, Red’s Good Vibes always 
works to ensure that clients have mul-
tiple meal options, which helps make 
the experience feel more like a normal 
food truck than a charity. The non-
profit also never asks for suggested do-
nations when volunteers are actively 
serving food to avoid making anyone 
feel compelled to donate in the mo-
ment. 
Red’s Good Vibes is a labor of love 
for Caitlin and her siblings, who found 
a way to honor their brother in the 
most authentic way that they could. 
Thanks to their dedication, and the 
hard work of their volunteers, Red’s 
Good Vibes distributes 1,500 hot meals 
a week to Granite Staters facing food 
insecurity. Soon, the nonprofit hopes 
to double that number using a second 
food truck that they are leasing from 
the city of Dover for $1 a year. 
Caitlin turned a tragedy into an op-
portunity to give back to her commu-
nity, which exemplifies the Granite 
State’s ingenuity and all-hands-on- 
deck spirit. I am proud to honor Caitlin 
as December’s Granite Stater of the 
Month, and I wish Red’s Good Vibes 
continued success serving their com-
munity.∑

pany, Inc., in Kamiah as the Idaho 
Small Business of the Month for Janu-
ary 2022. 
Jacobs Lumber Company is a full- 
service lumber and hardware store that 
provides 
housing 
and 
construction 
services in a one-stop shop. Founder 
and owner Keith Jacobs has long had a 
hand in Kamiah’s lumber industry. At 
14 years old, Keith began his career at 
Kamiah’s Bi-Rite Lumber Company, 
where he worked until it was sold in 
1993. After a few years working out of 
State, Keith returned home to Kamiah 
and founded Jacobs Lumber Co. in 1997. 
Jacobs Lumber Company is renowned 
for a deep commitment to its cus-
tomers and community. The business 
sources products from local loggers and 
fellow small businesses throughout the 
region, ensuring its customers have the 
best quality products. Keith attributes 
much of his company’s success to the 
relationships they have cultivated with 
their customers. This hometown-driven 
approach to business has helped build 
communities and welcome newcomers 
to our great State. 
The Jacobs family is also committed 
to giving back to its patrons. In March 
2021, the company was honored as the 
first recipient of the Kamiah School 
District’s Community Business Award. 
Jacobs Lumber Company maintains a 
strong tradition of supporting Kamiah 
schools, athletic programs, and camps. 
Jacobs has passed along his commit-
ment to service and community, hard 
work, and charity to his own children. 
Today, Keith co-owns the company 
with his son, Slade, promising to serve 
the people of Kamiah for generations 
to come. 
Congratulations to Keith, his family, 
and all of the employees of Jacobs 
Lumber Company, Inc. on being se-
lected as the Idaho Small Business of 
the Month for January 2022. You make 
our great state proud, and I look for-
ward to your continued growth and 
success.∑

LETIC 
ADMINISTRATORS’ 
DAY 
ON DECEMBER 14, 2021 
Mr. BRAUN (for himself, Mr. MUR-
PHY, Mr. YOUNG, Mr. RUBIO, and Mrs.

tion; which was considered and agreed 
to: 
Whereas, each December, the Senate recog-
nizes the positive contributions of inter-
scholastic athletic administrators; 
Whereas the position of school athletic ad-
ministrator is recognized as a profession, 
which, like other academic professions, bene-
fits greatly from continued education and 
certification; 
Whereas school athletic programs develop 
young people physically, mentally, socially, 
and emotionally by the life lessons learned 
through participation and competition; 
Whereas interscholastic athletic participa-
tion is an integral part of a student’s edu-
cational experience and enhances the learn-
ing and maturation process; 
Whereas athletic administrators are com-
mitted to developing and maintaining com-
prehensive 
education-based 
athletic 
pro-
grams which seek the highest development 
of all student athletes; 
Whereas 
athletic 
administrators 
fulfill 
professional responsibilities with integrity, 
commitment to equality, industriousness to 
long hours, and fairness; 
Whereas athletic administrators preserve, 
enhance, and promote the educational values 
of athletics in our schools through profes-
sional growth in the areas of education, lead-
ership, and service; 
Whereas athletic administrators embody 
high standards of ethics, sportsmanship, and 
personal conduct and encourage coaching 
staffs, student athletes, and community 
members to commit to these high standards 
as well; and 
Whereas the athletic programs run by 
these administrators have impacts that ex-
tend well beyond the playing field, athletic 
venues, and even the school: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) supports the annual recognition of 
Interscholastic Athletic Administrators’ Day 
on December 14, 2021; 
(2) commends athletic administrators for 
their commitment and leadership provided

compassion, and preparation within the pro-
fession.

SA 4897. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. BURR) pro-

TEXT OF AMENDMENTS 
SA 4897. Mr. SCHUMER (for Mr. 
BURR) proposed an amendment to the 
bill S. 450, to award posthumously the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Emmett 
Till and Mamie Till-Mobley; as follows: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Emmett Till 
and Mamie Till-Mobley Congressional Gold 
Medal Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The brutal lynching of Emmett Till and 
the subsequent bravery and boldness of his 
mother, Mamie Till-Mobley, became a cata-
lyst for the civil rights movement. 
(2) On August 28, 1955, 14-year-old Emmett 
Till was kidnapped, beaten, and shot in 
Money, Mississippi, where he had traveled 
from Chicago to stay with his great uncle, 
Moses Wright. 
(3) The corpse of Emmett Till was discov-
ered 3 days later in the Tallahatchie River 
and his murderers were acquitted despite 
Moses Wright providing an eyewitness testi-
mony that the men on trial kidnapped Em-
mett Till. 
(4) Mamie Till-Mobley, the mother of Em-
mett Till, demonstrated her love for her son 
and her courage and strength in suffering in 
the days that followed as she brought the 
body of Emmett Till back to Chicago for bur-
ial and demanded an open casket funeral, 
which drew more than 50,000 attendees. 
(5) Mamie Till-Mobley further allowed a 
photograph to be taken of Emmett Till in his 
casket, which was shown throughout the 
world. 
(6) The original casket of Emmett Till 
stands on display at the National Museum of 
African American History and Culture as an 
enduring reminder of the racial violence that 
is a part of the history of the United States 
that the people of the United States must 
confront. 
(7) The heroic actions of Mamie Till- 
Mobley in the midst of evil, injustice, and 
grief became a catalyst for the civil rights 
movement and continued in the years to 
come as she worked for justice and honored 
the legacy of Emmett Till. 
(8) Mamie Till-Mobley went on to create 
the Emmett Till Players, which was a sig-
nificant national cultural contribution as 
teenagers traveled throughout the country 
presenting Martin Luther King Jr. speeches 
in the name of Emmett Till. 
(9) Mamie Till-Mobley also served as chair 
and co-founder of the Emmett Till Justice 
Campaign, which had the dual mission of re-
opening the murder of Emmett Till for a re-
investigation and a passage into law of Fed-
eral legislation to ensure that other racially 
motivated murders during the civil rights 
era were investigated and, when possible, 
prosecuted. 
(10) The efforts of the Emmett Till Justice 
Campaign led to the successful joint inves-
tigation by the State of Mississippi, the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation, and the Depart-
ment of Justice in 2004, the passage of the 
Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime 
Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–344; 122 Stat. 
3934), signed into law by President George W. 
Bush, and the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil 
Rights Crimes Reauthorization Act of 2016 
(Public Law 114–325; 130 Stat. 1965), signed 
into law by President Barack Obama. 
(11) The people of the United States honor 
the legacy of Emmett Till and the incredible 
suffering and equally incredible courage, re-
silience, and efforts of Mamie Till-Mobley 
that led to the civil rights movement that 
began in the 1950s.

Mr. SCHUMER. I now ask for a sec-
ond reading, and I object to my own re-
quest, all en bloc. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion having been heard, the bills will 
receive their second reading on the 
next legislative day. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST 
Mr. SCHUMER. A few moments ago, 
I went through the typical rule XIV 
process, which the majority leader al-
ways does to place legislation from 
both minority and majority on the leg-
islative calendar. It is merely tech-
nical. 
Now, the Republican leader seems to 
want to place a bunch of ‘‘gotcha’’ bills 
on the legislative calendar that he 
thinks would be tough votes for Demo-
crats to take as some kind of payback 
for pursuing legislation to protect the 
sacred right to vote. 
Well, we Democrats aren’t afraid of 
these votes, so what I propose to the 
Republican leader is that the Senate 
hold up-or-down votes at a majority 
threshold on each of the Republican 
bills he has outlined tonight, as well as 
the Freedom to Vote Act and the John 
Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. 
Let me say again. In a few moments, 
I will ask unanimous consent to have 
the Senate vote on the Freedom to 
Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act, and all the 
so-called tough bills the Republican 
leader is proposing tonight at a major-
ity threshold. 
We believe the right to vote, to pro-
tect our democracy, to get rid of dark 
money from elections, to end gerry-
mandering to ensure the American peo-
ple pick their elected leaders, not poli-
ticians, is so important, I would hope 
the Republican leader would go along 
with this proposal. 
Our caucus strongly disagrees with 
the Republican bills on this list, but 
for the sake of our democracy and get-
ting to a majority vote on voting 
rights, we are willing to vote. 
So, Madam President, I ask unani-
mous consent that at a time to be de-
termined by the majority leader, in 
consultation with the Republican lead-
er, that the Senate vote on passage of 
the following bills in the order listed; 
that there be no motions or amend-
ments in order to the bills; and that 
the passage be at a majority threshold, 
all without intervening action or de-
bate: S. 2747, the Freedom to Vote Act; 
H.R. 4, the John Lewis Voting Rights 
Advancement Act; S. 3452; S. 3453; S. 
3454; S. 3455; S. 3456; S. 3457; S. 3458; S. 
3459; S. 3460; S. 3461; S. 3462; S. 3463; S. 
3464; S. 3465; S. 3466; S. 3467; S. 3468; and 
S. 3469. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
f 
EMMETT TILL AND MAMIE TILL- 
MOBLEY CONGRESSSIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL ACT OF 2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Com-
mittee 
on 
Banking, 
Housing, 
and 
Urban Affairs be discharged from fur-
ther consideration of S. 450 and the 
Senate proceed to its immediate con-
sideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 450) to award posthumously the 
Congressional Gold Medal to Emmett Till 
and Mamie Till-Mobley. 
There being no objection, the com-
mittee was discharged, and the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Burr 
substitute amendment at the desk be 
considered and agreed to; the bill, as 
amended, be considered read a third 
time and passed; and that the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The amendment (No. 4897) in the na-
ture of a substitute was agreed to as 
follows: 
(Purpose: In the nature of a substitute) 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following:

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF JERRY DESMOND 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to mourn the passing of dedicated pub-
lic 
servant, 
Captain 
Jerry 
Desmond, 
of 
Stonington, Connecticut. Mr. Desmond trag-
ically passed at the all too young age of 63 on 
Friday, December 24, 2021 after a coura-
geous battle with cancer. 
Born in 1958 to James and Phillis Desmond 
in Weymouth, Massachusetts, Jerry attributed 
his strong work ethic to the model of his par-
ents. From an early age, Jerry was instilled 
with the value of giving whatever task or chal-
lenge laid before him a full ‘‘100 percent.’’ This 
principle guided him through life to the very 
end, even during his arduous battle with can-
cer which he did so with an infectious sense 
of optimism and the can-do attitude that de-
fined his life. 
At the age of 5, Jerry moved with his family 
to Stonington, putting him on a destined path 
to become an integral part of the local com-
munity. The Stonington Public Schools had 
such an immense impact on him that upon 
graduating he went on to serve as a substitute 
teacher and tutor beginning in 1976. This role 
existed as a further point of inspiration for 
Jerry, who attended Southern Connecticut 
State University and earned a Bachelor of Arts 
of Education. 
Though upon graduating he was unable to 
immediately bridge to a career in teaching, 
Jerry remained undeterred in his ultimate mis-
sion to give back to the community that helped 
raise him. As someone who was able to ap-
preciate the larger picture, Jerry used the ath-
letic prowess he formed in high school and 
joined the local police force while simulta-
neously taking up the role of assistant coach 
for Stonington High School’s football and track 
and field teams. In addition to football and 
track and field, Jerry coached the local wom-
an’s gymnastics team through to his final mo-
ments. A fierce optimist who believed in the 
value of hard work, Jerry was a perfect fit for 
the Stonington Public School’s athletic pro-
grams. He appreciated working with the town’s 
youth—passing onto them the same values 
taught by Jerry’s parents before him—and 
viewed that work as one of the most reward-
ing parts of his career—especially enjoying his 
time as Stonington Police Department’s Youth 
Officer. 
Jerry would eventually return back to school 
and advance his background in education, 
graduating from the FBI Training Academy in 
Quantico. He also received a Masters in 
Homeland Security Leadership from the Uni-
versity of Connecticut. Aimed with a revitalized 
education, Jerry went on to teach as an ad-
junct professor at the nearby Mitchell College, 
in New London, Connecticut. 
Of course, the pinnacle of Jerry’s career 
was his remarkable 35 years of service to the 
Stonington Police Department, 17 of those 
years as Captain of the Department. During 
that time, he helped oversee the department’s 
marine unit and was involved with the dive 
team and acted as a boating instructor. He 
was instrumental in the awarding of a 
$375,000 federal grant to the Department for 
a new police boat which went into service in 
2014. That same year, Jerry retired from the 
department. Not content to accept a sedentary 
retirement, however, Jerry used his spare time 
to begin a new career with the Department of 
Energy and Environmental Protection as its 
Boating Safety and Education Representative, 
maintaining the role of teacher to the very 
end. 
Madam Speaker, it is an incredible honor to 
represent constituents as loyal to the future of 
their community as Jerry. I had the privilege to 
interact with him as congressman and can at-
test to his diligent professionalism and down 
to earth personality which was so engaging. 
Jerry’s life was defined by his love for teach-
ing and giving to his community. His actions 
touched thousands of people, and he served 
as an excellent role model for Stonington’s 
next generation. Though the gap left by his 
generous and caring nature could not hope to 
be filled in the Stonington community, we can 
find relief in the reality that those whose lives 
were enriched by Jerry’s presence will not 
soon forget his example. To that end, I ask 
that my colleagues and this chamber join me 
in observing the loss of Jerry Desmond.

RECOGNIZING 
COMMAND 
SER-
GEANT MAJOR CHRISTOPHER L. 
YOUNG 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
l rise today to celebrate the service of Com-
mand Sergeant Major Christopher L. Young. 
He has served in every leadership role within 
the non-commissioned officers ranks of the 
Mississippi Army National Guard, and it has 
been an honor to serve in this capacity with 
him. I am grateful to his dedication and many 
years of service to this nation and the state of 
Mississippi. 
CSM Young enlisted into the Mississippi 
Army National Guard on May 23, 1988. He 
joined the 1–155th Infantry Regiment ‘‘Mis-
sissippi Rifles’’ in McComb, Mississippi. He 
was mobilized in 1990 in support of Operation 
Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. 
When he returned, CSM Young served in var-
ious leadership roles in the 155 Armored Bri-
gade Combat Team. In 2001, he mobilized 
again in preparation for deployment to Bosnia- 
Herzegovina in support of Stabilization Forces- 
10 rotation. There he served as the task 
force’s Chief Protective Services Officer and 
the Scout Platoon Sergeant. He returned in 
April 2002 and was promoted to E–8. He also 
became the Chief Paralegal NCO in the 155. 
In 2004, CSM Young was mobilized in sup-
port of Operation Iraqi Freedom III and the 
War on Terror. There he led a company of 
134 Infantry soldiers who were responsible for 
counter-insurgency and combat operations 
against hostile insurgents in the Babil provi-
dence. In 2010, he was promoted to Sergeant 
Major and would go on to become the Com-
mand Sergeant Major in 2012. In this role, he 
became the senior enlisted advisor to the Bat-
talion Commander and was responsible for the 
well-being of the soldiers in his unit. 
In 2019, CSM Young was promoted to the 
Mississippi Army National Guard State Com-
mand Sergeant Major position. In this role, he 
serves as both my Senior Enlisted Advisor 
and as the Command Sergeant Major over all 
Mississippi Army National Guard Soldiers 
where he enacted positive reforms that will im-
pact the MSARNG for years to come. I am 
grateful for CSM leadership, advisement, and 
friendship. CSM Young has set a precedent 
for future readers in the MSARNG and will 
leave a legacy of compassionate, selfless 
leadership.

IN REMEMBRANCE OF DAVID 
GONZALES 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise in remembrance of longtime Yuba Sutter 
native, David ‘‘Speedy’’ Gonzales, who left us 
on January 14, 2021. As a pillar in the com-
munity, he owned and helped operate the El 
Zarape Restaurant with his wife Ana for over 
75 years. 
Born in Los Angeles, David moved to 
Wheatland, California at 7 years old. In 1952, 
his parents moved into a studio apartment 
above a Mexican restaurant on Garden High-
way in Yuba City known as the El Zarape Inn. 
Together as a family, he and his four siblings 
helped their parents start the El Zarape that 
has now become one of the oldest family- 
owned restaurants in the region. 
David loved and strived to support his grow-
ing community his entire life. He was a proud 
member of the Yuba City Rotary Club, Alli-
ance for Hispanic Advancement, Yuba Sutter 
Chamber of Commerce, and various other 
community events. Throughout the years, 
David grew friendships with everyone he 
interacted with, whether it was his fellow Ro-
tarians or all the friends that met at the Colusa 
Casino. David was preceded in death by his 
parents Tony and Eleanor Gonzales, Mary 
Cartago, Gloria Laswell, and Irene James. He 
is survived by his wife Ana and sons Robert 
and David (spouse Shannon), 6 grandchildren, 
and 1 great-grandchild.

CELEBRATING THE 100TH BIRTH-
DAY OF VETERAN ROBERT TIF-
FANY 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the service of Mr. Robert E. Tiffany of 
Angola. 
On Saturday, January 29, Robert will cele-
brate his 100th birthday. On behalf of the 
United States Congress, I want to congratulate 
him on this wonderful occasion. We hope his 
heart is filled with joy knowing he has experi-
enced our country’s greatest blessings, includ-
ing the affection of family and friends over a 
long, well-lived life. 
Our Nation owes Robert a debt of gratitude 
for his dedicated service to our country while 
serving in the United States Army Air during 
World War II. Like many of the Greatest Gen-
eration, he enlisted following the Japanese at-
tack on Pearl Harbor. In piloting B-17s over 
Europe, Robert took part in the Allied strategic 
bombing campaigns against the German war 
machine. By the time he left the Army in 1944, 
he flew a total of 23 missions. 
Following his departure from service, he re-
turned home, where he established a career, 
raised a family and lived out the American 
Dream. This record is a testament to his serv-
ice and an appeal to future generations of 
Americans, that they too may answer the call 
to help keep lit the torch of American liberty, 
just as Robert did. 
May God Bless him, and may God Bless 
the United States of America.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND 
CAREER OF DR. KEN HARVEY 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and career of 
Dr. Ken Harvey who is retiring from medical 
practice after 37 years of serving the Tupelo 
community. I am so grateful for his dedication 
to keeping our State healthy and thank him for 
his lifetime of service. 
Dr. Harvey is a native of Picayune, Mis-
sissippi where he graduated from Picayune 
High School in 1967. He went on to attend 
Mississippi College where he studied chem-
istry. He returned home to work in research at 
Crosby Chemicals. While there, he experi-
enced an accident that introduced him to a 
doctor who inquired why he never considered 
medical school. He was skeptical at first, but 
eventually went on to attend the University of 
Mississippi School of Medicine and graduated 
in 1977. He stayed there for his residency in 
internal medicine. He attended on scholarship 
from the U.S. Air Force and was assigned to 
Columbus Air Force Base. 
Upon completing his assignment, Dr. Har-
vey joined a practice in Tupelo founded by 
Drs. Tannehill, Lummus, Murphey and Wood. 
They were remarkably busy both in their clinic 
and at North Mississippi Medical Center. ln 
1993, these doctors formed the IMA Founda-
tion and worked with North Mississippi Health 
Services. Dr. Harvey is known for continuing 
to see patients long after their standard term 
of care. He still sees patients from his early 
days of practicing as well as patients from Co-
lumbus Air Force Base. He is truly dedicated 
to all he has worked with. 
While Dr. Harvey has missed practicing 
medicine, he enjoys spending time with his 
wife of 46 years, Patricia, and their son Jeff. 
In his free time, he hopes to travel and enjoy 
Ole Miss sports. 
I am grateful for the outstanding care Dr. 
Harvey has provided to North Mississippians 
for nearly four decades and wish him well in 
this new chapter of life.

HONORING CARROLL EDWIN SWAIN 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Carroll Edwin Swain of Salem, Vir-
ginia, who passed away on December 31, 
2021 at the age of 94. Often referred to as 
‘‘The Colonel,’’ he was a retired Lieutenant 
Colonel from the United States Army, veteran 
of World War II and the Korean and Vietnam 
Wars, and public official in the City of Roa-
noke. 
Colonel Swain was born on August 6, 1927 
to Robert Swain Sr. and Mahala Woods 
Swain. He was a native of Roanoke, Virginia 
and graduated from Lucy Addison High School 
in 1945. He served as a military policeman in 
Italy from 1946 to 1947 before returning to Vir-
ginia to work for the railroad. 
He graduated from Hampton Institute, now 
Hampton University, in 1953 with a bachelor’s 
degree. His academic success allowed him to 
receive the honor of an appointment as Sec-
ond Lieutenant in the United States Army as 
an Artillery Officer. When he completed his 
service, he held the esteemed rank of Lieuten-
ant Colonel. 
Over the years, Colonel Swain executed 
staff and command assignments in a number 
of different units. He performed duties that 
were related to nuclear weaponry and helped 
in devising direction and instructional pro-
grams to advance race relations in the U.S. 
Army. His service earned awards including the 
Soldier’s Good Conduct Medal, the Army 
Commendation Medal, the Bronze Star, and 
the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster. 
In 1971, Colonel Swain returned to Roanoke 
and took on a career in education in the Roa-
noke City Public Schools before retiring in 
1992. 
In addition to his accomplishments in the 
U.S. Army and education system, Colonel 
Swain went on to serve on the Roanoke City 
Council. He worked to improve crime rates, 
employee welfare, educational resources, eco-
nomic development, fiscal efficiency in govern-
ment spending, as well as a variety of other 
issues to better the City. Colonel Swain lived 
a selfless life of leadership and service to oth-
ers, and he will be greatly missed. 
He is survived by his wife of 67 years, 
Welthea Kasey Swain; his sons, Carroll 
‘‘Edwin’’ (Faith) Swain Jr. and Michael (Jac-
queline) Swain; daughter, Pastors Stephanie 
S. (Lewis) Tucker Jr.; four grandchildren, Rae 
Swain Page, Justin Swain, Kyah and Kourtney

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
SENATOR DENNIS KRUSE 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Senator Dennis Kruse of Auburn, Indi-
ana, as he prepares to retire after a long and 
distinguished career in public service. Dennis 
is a model statesman in the Indiana State-
house, where he has served for 32 years; first 
as a state representative from 1989 to 2004, 
and then as a state senator. 
During his tenure in the senate, he served 
as Senate Education Committee chairman, 
where I had the opportunity to work with him. 
In this role, Dennis introduced and helped 
pass numerous pieces of legislation to im-
prove education in the state, including bills to 
establish the state’s formal teacher evaluation 
system, to improve school discipline, to en-
hance before- and after-school programs and 
teacher preparation, and more. 
Senator Kruse was also a culture warrior 
long before most of us were. He introduced 
bills in the statehouse to codify the Christian 
view of marriage; to bring back prayer to pub-
lic schools; to prohibit sex changes for minors; 
and more. More recently, he announced that 
he will be introducing bills this next session to 
protect medical freedom and to allow public 
displays of religious historical documents. Also 
notable is his longtime commitment to con-
stituent services, which remains a model for 
officials state- and nation-wide. 
Senator Kruse is not only an exemplary 
public servant; he is also a great man whose 
devotion to his community and family is pal-
pable. I am proud to call him a mentor and a 
friend and I am honored to have worked 
alongside him. I wish him and his wife, Kay, 
the best as they prepare to enter a new chap-
ter of their lives. Let this document serve as 
a testament to Dennis’ commitment to the bet-
terment of those whom he served and to the 
legacy that will endure long after he is gone.

RECOGNIZING RANI YADAV- 
RANJAN 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
rise to recognize Rani Yadav-Ranjan, the 
Head of Artificial Intelligence at Ericsson’s 
Global AI Accelerator, and a member of the 
Ericsson CTO’s Technology Leadership team. 
Rani’s contribution to technology and soci-
ety shapes the way we live, enables how we 
work, and underscores the path forward for a 
more secure, inclusive future. 
While coming from modest means, Rani has 
achieved considerable success as a success-
ful entrepreneur and Executive Technology 
leader. Her work has pioneered industry lead-
ing solutions for Big Data Artificial Intelligence, 
E-commerce, and Blockchain technologies. 
People refer to her as a visionary and expert 
in data science, as evidenced in her 10+ pat-
ents in innovative new industries. Many com-
panies make use of her patent for fully 
encrypted mobile payments and text commu-
nication. 
At Ericsson, Rani has innovated solutions 
for Blockchain-based data monetization, and 
Cyberthreat detection for encrypted flow. 
Rani’s formidable talents have also been 
used to create stronger social fabrics between 
people at her places of work and in her com-
munity. These actions often create access to 
resources and opportunities which provide oth-
ers a higher quality of life. 
Her influence on Diversity & Inclusion efforts 
at Ericsson has created safe spaces for em-
ployees of all backgrounds to bring their com-
plete selves to work, a precondition for the 
creativity and innovation that drives Ericsson’s 
market offerings. 
Rani is the founder of the University of Cali-
fornia, Merced CITRIS Innovation & Entrepre-
neurship Challenge, which is now held at the 
University of California, Berkeley and has in-
spired the start-up ecosystems in both Merced 
and Berkeley. Rani is also the founder of the 
University of California, Berkeley CITRIS Inno-
vation & Entrepreneurship Challenge. She 
also serves as a Recurring Guest Lecturer at 
the University of California, Berkeley, and 
Merced, as well as an Adjunct Professor at 
Southwest Law School, where she most re-
cently served. 
Rani is a member of the Committee of 200, 
a powerful network of the most accomplished 
female C-suite executives in industry, who col-
lectively employ more than 2.5 million people 
and are committed to developing women’s 
leadership in business. 
Rani is deeply committed to the Sikh com-
munity in San Jose and is widely regarded as 
a pillar of the community. As a long-time vol-
unteer and board member, Rani has a strong 
personal commitment to making neighbor-

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF PFC 
JIMMY ROWLAND 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Private First 
Class Jimmy Rowland of Baldwyn Mississippi 
who was reported missing in action during the 
Korean War. In 1956, his remains were de-
clared nonrecoverable. In November of 2021, 
Rowland’s family was informed his remains 
were accounted for and will be brought back 
to Baldwyn for burial and a full military funeral. 
In July of 1950 Jimmy Rowland, at 19 years 
old, came under heavy fire fighting North Ko-
rean forces at the Kum River north of Taejon, 
South Korea. He was a member of the Heavy 
Mortar Company, 19th Infantry Regiment, 24th 
Infantry Division. He was reported wounded 
and then missing in action on July 16 and was 
dropped from his unit’s rolls on August 16, 
1950. In February of the next year, four sets 
of remains were found at the foot of a bridge 
west of the Seoul-Taejon main supply route. 
Three individuals were identified as members 
of the 19th infantry regiment but the fourth 
was not identified. These remains were des-
ignated as Unknown X–418 Tanggok, His re-
mains, along with all other unidentified soldiers 
killed in the Korean War, were transported to 
the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific 
in Honolulu. 
In July of 2018, anthropologists and histo-
rians from the Defense POW/MIA Accounting 
Agency planned to identify the 652 Korean 
War casualties that remained unknown. On 
March 4, 2019, Rowland’s remains were 
disinterred and transferred to the DPAA Lab-
oratory at Joint Basse Pearl Harbor-Hickam, 
Hawaii. Using dental and anthropological anal-
ysis as well as circumstantial evidence, sci-
entists identified Jimmy Rowland. 
Though many have passed on, it is ex-
pected 20 to 30 of Jimmy’s family members 
will be in attendance at his funeral on Satur-
day. The Baldwyn community is grateful to 
honor Jimmy nearly 70 years after he was de-
clared missing in action. Though thousands of 
casualties from the Korean War remain un-
identified, I am thankful that one Mississippi 
soldier will return home to be honored by his 
family and community. I am grateful for the 
work of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting 
Agency and express my most sincere condo-
lences to Jimmy’s family, friends, and loved 
ones.

HONORING THE CAREER OF 
CATHIE HUMBARGER 
HON. JIM BANKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. BANKS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Cathie Humbarger of Fort Wayne, as 
she retired recently from her position with the 
Right to Life of Northeast Indiana. 
Cathie’s decades-long leadership in the pro- 
life movement has been extraordinary. For-
merly the communications director for the Na-
tional Right to Life and Vice President of the 
Indiana Right to Life, Cathie has defended life 
at every level and before every audience pos-
sible. As just one example, she was a very 
public proponent of a bill signed into law by 
Governor Eric Holcomb last spring to codify 
new restrictions on the ability for minors to get 
abortions and for clinics to prescribe abortion- 
inducing pills. 
As another, for years, Cathie helped orga-
nize the annual summer ‘‘Pro-Life Boot Camp’’

at the University of St. Francis to equip high 
school and college students with the tools 
necessary to defend life in the public space. 
Cathie was also essential in helping mobilize 
Northeast Indiana’s contingent to attend the 
annual National March for Life in Washington, 
D.C. One of the highlights of my time in Con-
gress was being joined on stage by Cathie at 
the 2017 March as Vice President Mike Pence 
gave one of the most forceful defenses for life 
ever. 
Beyond her professional accolades and 
achievements, of which there are many, Cath-
ie is one of the kindest, most genuine, and du-
tiful people I have ever known. I am proud to 
call her a friend of many years and wish her 
Godspeed as she enters a new chapter of her 
life. This document serves as a testament to 
Cathie’s career and character, and an appeal 
to future generations—that they be inspired by 
Cathie to carry on the fight for life in the years 
and decades to come.

HONORING FORMER JUSTICE OF 
THE PEACE TERESA VERA PEREZ 
HON. VICENTE GONZALEZ 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. VICENTE GONZALEZ of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Mrs. 
Teresa Vera Perez of Concepcion, Texas, 
who dedicated her life to serving the people of 
Duval County. 
Mrs. Perez was born on November 25, 
1933, to Saturnino Vera and Francisca Saenz 
Vera. At the age of 18, she married Mr. Asildo 
Lopez Perez with whom she shared a life for 
57 years. During this time, they raised five 
children together: Elena, Ester, Eloy, and 
twins Eduardo and Ernesto. 
Mrs. Perez first ran for Justice of the Peace, 
Precinct 2 in 1977 and won, making her the 
first female Justice of the Peace in Duval 
County history. She served a total of three 
terms, becoming a lifelong member of the 
Texas Justices of the Peace and Constables 
Association and Chaplain for the South Texas 
Association of Justices of the Peace and Con-
stables. In addition to her time serving as Jus-
tice of the Peace, Mrs. Perez also worked as 
a Nurse’s Aide at the P&S Hospital, previously 
located in Alice, Texas. Following her 12 years 
as Justice of the Peace, she continued to 
serve as an Honorable Judge by joining cou-
ples in matrimony. 
Mrs. Perez was an active member of the 
Duval County and the Concepcion commu-
nities throughout her lifetime. She proudly 
served as a Eucharistic Minister and member 
of 
the 
Immaculate 
Concepcion 
Catholic 
Church Altar and Rosary Society as well as 
the Guadalupana and the Fiesta Del Rancho 
Committee. She was also crowned Queen of 
the Elderly Nutrition program Twice. In 1993, 
at the age of 60 years old, she obtained her 
GED diploma in Alice, Texas. Mrs. Perez 
passed away on January 23, 2014. Although 
she is no longer with us, her memory remains 
eternal. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today to ac-
knowledge the countless achievements and 
charitable acts of Mrs. Teresa Vera Perez. 
She devoted her life to the betterment of her 
community and her legacy will be no doubt be 
remembered by all who knew her. Her general 
love for life, her family, the Lord, and commit-
ment to her neighbors is admirable. May she 
rest in peace.

HONORING DR. THEODORE 
JACKSON VIARS 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Dr. Theodore Jackson (Ted) Viars, 
who passed away on December 13, 2021 at 
the age of 87. Dr. Viars was a longtime edu-
cator in western Virginia who positively im-
pacted generations of students. 
Theodore Viars was born on December 26, 
1933 in Radford, Virginia. His parents were 
Robert and Louise Viars. He was a student 
athlete throughout his time at Radford High 
School, from which he graduated in 1952, and 
the University of Virginia. At UVA, he earned 
a football scholarship and played varsity base-
ball while earning a place on the Dean’s List, 
serving on the Student Council, and belonging 
to the Varsity Club and the SAE fraternity. He 
later earned a master’s degree and a doc-
torate from Virginia Tech. 
Education became Dr. Viars’ mission. He 
began his career as a teacher and assistant 
principal at Pulaksi High School from 1956 to 
1960. Subsequently, he worked as principal at 
Clifton Forge from 1960 to 1963 before mov-
ing to Salem to become Glenvar High 
School’s first principal. After Glenvar, he held 
a variety of roles with the Roanoke County 
Schools, including Director of Instruction, As-
sistant Superintendent, and Deputy Super-
intendent for Instruction. He retired from the 
school system in 1990 and taught as an Asso-
ciate Professor of Education at Hollins College 
from 1991 to 1994. 
Dr. Viars was a member of Central United 
Methodist Church in Salem for over 57 years 
and served in the United States Marine Corps 
Reserve. 
Dr. Viars was preceded in death by his 
daughter, Kim Viars. He is survived by his 
wife, Johnsey; children, Kelly Viars Coudriet 
(Greg), Ted Viars II (Tracey), and Martin Viars 
(Sherry); 
grandchildren, 
Jackson 
Bradley, 
Kelsey Legra, Kayleigh Cox, Teddy III, Max, 
and Brock Viars; and great-grandchildren, 
Cayden and Roman Legra. I offer them my 
condolences on the loss of this committed life-
long educator.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE AND 
SERVICE OF OLIN R. PICKENS 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life and service of 
Mr. Olin R. Pickens who will celebrate his 
100th birthday this month. I join his family, 
friends, and loved ones in celebrating his life-
long dedication to this country. 
Olin Pickens was an infantryman assigned 
to the Army 805th Tank Destroyer Unit during 
WWII before he was captured as a Prisoner of 
War. He was executing a mission to capture 
German field marshal Erwin Rommel in North 
Africa in 1943 when his unit was attacked by 
the Germans. His unit, along with three others, 
attempted to breech a German Blockade to 
reach Rommel. The soldiers understood this 
to be a suicide mission. On February 16, 
1943, PFC Pickens was captured in Tunisia 
and spent 26 months as a POW. He escaped 
once, but was recaptured. In April of 1945, 
Pickens was finally released. 
Pickens looks back on his time in the army 
with astounding bravery and resolve. I admire 
his tenacity and dedication to this country. It is 
because of men like Mr. Pickens that we cele-
brate the freedoms we enjoy every day, and 
for his service, I am grateful. It is a joy to wish 
him a happy 100th birthday.

INTRODUCTION 
OF 
A 
BILL 
TO 
AMEND THE DISTRICT OF CO-
LUMBIA 
HOME 
RULE 
ACT 
TO 
PERMIT THE CHAIRMAN OF THE 
COUNCIL OF THE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA TO TRANSMIT ACTS 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
TO 
CONGRESS 
IN 
ELECTRONIC 
FORM 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I in-
troduce a bill that would amend the District of 
Columbia Home Rule Act (HRA) to permit the 
Chairman of the Council of the District of Co-
lumbia to transmit legislation to Congress in 
the form of the Chairman’s choosing, including 
in electronic form. This bill seeks to modernize 
the method D.C. legislation is transmitted to 
Congress for the congressional review period. 
The HRA requires that D.C. legislation be 
transmitted to Congress for a congressional 
review period before the legislation can take 
effect. The legislation takes effect after a re-
view period, unless a resolution of disapproval 
is enacted into law during the review period. 
While the HRA is silent on the method that the 
Chairman must use to transmit the legislation, 
House and Senate precedent require that the 
legislation be physically transmitted to the 
Speaker of the House and the President of the 
Senate. Physical transmittal imposes costs in 
terms of time on the Council, the House and 
Senate Parliamentarians, the Speaker, the 
President of the Senate, the House Clerk, the 
Senate Secretary, the House Committee on 
Oversight and Reform and the Senate Home-
land Security and Governmental Affairs Com-
mittee. When the HRA was enacted in 1973, 
email did not exist. 
The Council engages in a 12-step process 
to comply with the physical transmittal require-
ment: 
Step 1: Write individualized cover letters. 
Step 2: The Chairman physically signs the 
cover letters. 
Step 3: Arrange a pick-up time of the legis-
lation and cover letters from the Chairman. 
Step 4: Print two copies of the bill and two 
copies of the committee report to deliver to the 
Speaker and to the President of the Senate. 
Step 5: Arrange a time for delivery to the 
Speaker’s office.

Step 6: Arrange a time for delivery to the 
President of the Senate’s office. 
Step 7: Arrange for two D.C. employees to 
drive to the Capitol. (Two staffers are required 
because parking restrictions require a driver 
and a delivery person.) 
Step 8: Drive to the Capitol. 
Step 9: Deliver the legislation to the Speak-
er’s office and get a signed receipt. 
Step 10: Deliver the legislation to the Presi-
dent of the Senate’s office and get a signed 
receipt. 
Step 11: Assign the congressional review 
period based on the receipts. 
Step 12: File the signed receipts. 
The aftermath of the January 6, 2021 attack 
on the Capitol highlighted the burdens of 
physical transmittal. After temporary fencing 
was installed around the Capitol, staff from the 
D.C. Council could not enter the Capitol, de-
laying the transmittal of legislation until Coun-
cil staff and congressional staff developed a 
workaround. Council staff and congressional 
staff met outside the fencing so the Council 
staff could physically transmit the legislation. 
Today, when we live in the era of e-mail, 
there is no reason to continue to require an in-
creasingly ancient process, when these docu-
ments could be transmitted electronically in-
stead, saving a tremendous amount of time 
and effort. I urge my colleagues to support this 
commonsense bill.

BERRYESSA SNOW MOUNTAIN NA-
TIONAL MONUMENT EXPANSION 
ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Berryessa Snow Mountain Na-
tional Monument Expansion Act,’’ with Con-
gressman MIKE THOMPSON (D–CA05) as the 
original cosponsor. Our legislation would ex-
pand the National Monument to include ap-
proximately 3,925 acres of federal land in 
Lake County, California; create new co-man-
agement opportunities with federally recog-
nized tribes; and rename Walker Ridge to 
‘‘Molok Luyuk,’’ meaning Condor Ridge in the 
Patwin language of Native Americans indige-
nous to the area. It is endorsed by the Lake 
County Board of Supervisors and the Tribal 
Council of the Yocha Dehe Wintun Nation. 
In the 114th Congress, I championed bi-
cameral legislation (H.R. 761/S. 393) to estab-
lish the Berryessa Snow Mountain National 
Monument, with then-Senator Barbara Boxer 
(D–CA) and Congressman THOMPSON. Our 
legislation would have included the Walker 
Ridge tract in Lake and Colusa Counties, Cali-
fornia, administered by the federal Bureau of 
Land Management (BLM) within the National 
Monument’s boundary. 
In December 2014, Congressman THOMP-
SON and I hosted then-Secretary of the Interior 
Sally Jewell at the Lake Berryessa reservoir, 
so she could view the landscape and hear 
from local community and tribal leaders about 
the need to permanently conserve this special 
place. Said Secretary Jewell at the time: ‘‘This 
is a beautiful area with cultural history and 
great opportunities for outdoor recreation and 
wildlife viewing so it’s no surprise that the 
community wants to make sure that it is pro-
tected and passed on to the next generation.’’ 
In July 2015, President Obama issued Presi-
dential Proclamation 9298, designating the 
federal land surrounding Lake Berryessa ad-
ministered by the BLM and U.S. Forest Serv-
ice as the Berryessa Snow Mountain National 
Monument. 
The ‘‘Berryessa Snow Mountain National 
Monument Expansion Act’’ would expand the 
existing National Monument boundary to in-
clude the Lake County portion of Walker 
Ridge, which the legislation renames to Con-
dor Ridge (Molok Luyuk). This ridgeline is an 
extinct volcanic mountain range with an un-
usual ‘‘serpentine’’ soil composition supporting 
a trove of rare and beautiful plant species like 
the adobe lily (Fritillaria pluriflora) found only 
in this part of northern California. Other at-risk 
and protected animal species such as the bald 
eagle, golden eagle, and tule elk also make 
their home there. 
Our legislation would not affect privately 
owned, state, tribal, or non-federal land. The 
federal land parcel proposed for inclusion with-
in the National Monument does not include 
acreage of the BLM’s Walker Ridge tract in 
Colusa County. Our legislation would also en-
sure that federally recognized tribes—whose 
ancestors called the National Monument home 
for millennia—have a meaningful role in the 
land stewardship of the National Monument. 
Finally, our legislation would direct the BLM 
and the Forest Service to complete the man-
agement plan for the National Monument, 
which has remained unfinished since 2015. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage all Members 
of the California delegation to join us in co-
sponsoring this legislation to permanently con-
serve this special place in Lake County. We 
must protect this unique landscape for future 
generations to enjoy and honor the Native 
American peoples who walked this land well 
before our country was even founded.

Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker,

Jimmy Simmons of Houston, Mississippi who 
passed away on November 19, 2021 at the 
age of 75. I join his family, friends, and loved 
ones in mourning his loss. 
Jimmy Simmons was born on March 18, 
1946 to James Travis and Venita Buchanan 
Simmons. He was a member of the National 
Guard. He was known as a horse trader, also 
owning rodeo bulls, mules, tracking hounds, 
cow dogs and coon dogs. He was a law en-
forcement officer for 30 years and spent 24 as 
a sheriff of Chickasaw County. He was a dedi-
cated member of Houlka First Baptist Church. 
He wished to be remembered for his humor 
and humility. 
Left to cherish his memory are Liz Sim-
mons, Annette Simmons, Chad Simmons, and 
many grandchildren and great grandchildren. I 
offer my most sincere condolences to the 
Chickasaw County community. 
TRIBUTE TO BETTY WHITE 
HON. ADAM B. SCHIFF 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the life of Betty Marion White, re-
nowned award-winning actress and animal 
welfare champion, of Los Angeles, California, 
who passed away on December 31, 2021, at 
the age of 99. 
Betty was born on January 17, 1922 in Oak 
Park, Illinois. In 1923, she and her parents 
moved to Alhambra, California and later to Los 
Angeles, where she graduated from Beverly 
Hills High School, and made her professional 
acting debut at the Bliss Hayden Little Theatre 
in Beverly Hills. 
Ms. White served in the American Women’s 
Voluntary Services during World War II, and 
made her movie debut in Time to Kill, a film 
for servicemen about military educational pro-
grams. A dynamic radio personality, she ap-
peared in shows such as the The Great 
Gildersleeve and Blondie, and had her own 
variety radio show, The Betty White Show. 
Moving into television, she co-hosted Holly-
wood on Television, a live television variety 
show, and later became co-producer and star 
of the show, Life With Elizabeth, which won 
her the first of many Emmy awards. Over her 
seventy-plus year career, she starred and ap-
peared in numerous television shows—sit-
coms, game shows, talk shows and soap op-
eras, including the Betty White Show, What’s 
My line, Password, The Love Boat, Maybe 
This Time, Boston Legal, Hot in Cleveland, 
The Bold and the Beautiful, and Saturday 
Night Live, in addition to films such as Lake 
Placid, The Proposal and the 2018 documen-
tary about her career, First Lady of Television. 
Ms. White was best known for her two signa-
ture roles as the conniving Sue Ann Nivens in 
the popular Mary Tyler Moore Show and the 
naive Rose Nylund in the enormously suc-
cessful The Golden Girls television series. 
I came to know Betty through her love of 
animals, and she was a tireless animal welfare 
advocate, author, donor, and spokeswoman. 
She worked with and supported many organi-
zations such as the African Wildlife Founda-
tion, Actors and Others for Animals and the 
Morris Animal Foundation, serving as presi-
dent and trustee, and she produced as well as 
hosted the syndicated series, The Pet Set. 
which highlighted celebrities and their pets. It 
was her involvement with the Greater Los An-
geles Zoo Association (GLAZA), the support 
group for the Los Angeles Zoo, that was near 
and dear to her heart, and spanned more than 
fifty years, beginning at the zoo’s opening in 
1966. One of her major projects was to 
produce, write and star in Backstage at the 
Zoo, a television special that aired in 1974, 
with famous friends Mary Tyler Moore, Jimmy 
Stewart, L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley and others 
making appearances. This was significant, as 
the special raised awareness of the zoo, 
brought the zoo into the homes of many 
Angelenos, emphasized the zoo’s outstanding 
animal care team and showcased the behind- 
the-scenes work. Since 1974, Ms. White has 
continuously served on the Board of Trustees 
for GLAZA, stepping away for several years to 
become an inaugural member of the Board of 
Zoo Commissioners, where she served for

eight years, before returning to GLAZA’s 
board and serving as chair. For her lifelong 
work for animal welfare, Betty was honored by 
L.A. Mayor Yillaraigosa as the City of Los An-
geles’ ‘‘Ambassador to the Animals,’’ and 
made an honorary zoo keeper by the Los An-
geles Chapter of The American Association of 
Zoo Keepers. 
I would like to convey my deepest sym-
pathies to Betty’s family, friends, and fans. as 
well as extend my heartfelt thanks for her dec-
ades of contributions to animal welfare, the 
L.A. Zoo in particular, and untold hours of en-
tertainment she provided to the world. The en-

White.

States, work with HSI field offices to inves-
tigate, prosecute and remove them from the 
United States. 
As the HRVWCU Chief, Mark oversees 
ICE’s Human Rights Violators and War Crimes 
Center, an HSI-led multi-agency effort to en-
sure those individuals and organizations re-
sponsible for the commission of human rights 
violations and war crimes are held account-
able. 
Prior to joining the Human Rights Violators

Chief of HSI’s Worksite Enforcement Unit and 
as a Domestic Operations Chief at HSI Head-
quarters in Washington, D.C. Prior to his serv-
ice at HSI Headquarters, Mark served as the 
ICE Attache´ in Mexico City and as the ICE 
Deputy Attache´ in Bogota, Colombia. 
As a field Special Agent and Supervisor, 
Mark conducted a wide variety of criminal in-
vestigations in the areas of terrorism, gangs, 
fraud, narcotics, financial and worksite inves-
tigations. Mark began his federal career as a 
staffer for a California U.S. Senator and then 
as an agent with the Immigration and Natu-
ralization Service in 1993. Over the last 30 
years, he has served the agency in various

sissippi on December 8, 2021. I join his family, 
friends, and loved ones in mourning his loss. 
Dennis was born to Leland and Roberta 
Grisham in Ripley, Mississippi on November 
28, 1944. He attended Northwest Mississippi 
Community College and the University of 
Southern Mississippi. He served in the Marine 
Corps until 1969. 
After his service, Dennis moved to Mem-
phis, Tennessee where he met his wife Lynda 
McAiister. They raised three children, Billy, 
Tommy and Jill. In 1974, the family moved 
back to Ripley. He started his own company, 
Grisham Asphalt and Paving. In 1984 he was 
elected supervisor for the 4th district of Tippah 
county. His tenure lasted 36 years and won 
nine consecutive elections. He served as the 
President of the Tippah County Board of Su-
pervisors and the President of the Mississippi 
Association of Supervisors. He was an active 
member of the Dumas Baptist church. 
Dennis leaves behind countless family 
members, friends, colleagues, and loved ones. 
I am grateful for his lifetime of service to the 
state of Mississippi.

IN HONOR OF THE TOWN OF NOR-
WOOD, MASSACHUSETTS, AND IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
ITS 
150TH 
‘‘BIRTHDAY’’ CELEBRATION 
HON. STEPHEN F. LYNCH 
OF MASSACHUSETTS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Monday, January 10, 2022 
Mr. LYNCH. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of the Town of Norwood, Massachu-
setts, and in recognition of its 150th ‘‘birthday’’ 
celebration. 
What is now the Town of Norwood began 
as a cluster of small mills and farms in the 
southernmost district of the Town of Dedham, 
Massachusetts, which was founded in 1636. 
The district quickly evolved into a self-con-
tained village, and, as early as 1717, its resi-
dents sought to create their own place of wor-
ship. They established a parish—known as the 
‘‘Second Parish’’ or ‘‘South Parish’’—in 1728, 
with Reverend Thomas Balch becoming its 
first resident pastor in 1736. 
Although the village was a distinct commu-
nity, it remained part of Dedham for more than 
a century. It finally separated from its mother 
town amid heated education and taxation dis-
putes, and it was incorporated by the Com-
monwealth of Massachusetts as the Town of 
Norwood in 1872. 
At the turn of the twentieth century, the ef-
forts of George Willett—a magnate and Pro-
gressive Reformer—led to a new town charter, 
which was approved by voters in 1914. With 
this new charter, Norwood became the first 
town in New England and only the twelfth in 
the nation to adopt the ‘‘Town Manager’’ form 
of government, placing the day-to-day busi-
ness of the community in the hands of a man-
agement professional. 
Much has happened since then, but the 
core of Norwood’s community remains un-
changed. Religious institutions, civic commit-
tees, recreational facilities, and volunteer as-
sociations provide the means for all Norwood 
residents to thrive in the twenty-first century. 
So, Madam Speaker, it is my distinct honor to 
take the floor of the House today to recognize 
the Town of Norwood, Massachusetts, as it 
prepares to celebrate its 150th ‘‘birthday’’—the 
anniversary of its incorporation as the Town of 
Norwood in the Commonwealth of Massachu-
setts.
