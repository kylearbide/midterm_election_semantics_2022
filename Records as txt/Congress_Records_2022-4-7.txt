PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret

prayer: 
On this morning, Lord, hear our 
voices as we lift up our prayers to You 
from the depths of our hearts. We lay 
our requests before You, appeals that 
are both simple and serious, of both 
concern and calamity, known and un-
known to the people around us. 
And we wait expectantly for Your re-
sponse—not knowing how or when that 
will come—but in faith we anticipate 
Your answer, and with faith we pray we 
are ready to receive it. 
And as You have listened to us, make 
us attentive to Your wisdom. With ears 
to hear, may we take note of Your 
whispers and open ourselves to hear 
Your divine voice breaking into our 
lives. 
We incline our hearts toward You 
this day, that You would grant us un-
derstanding in all that confounds us. 
Help us to receive Your guidance as 
You lead us in the way we should go. 
And may we thrive on the depth of 
Your compassion in all that we do and 
say. 
In the strength of Your name we 
pray. 
Amen.

BRANDEN 
SISCA 
AND 
MARTIN 
MACK, III PROVIDED EXTRAOR-
DINARY SERVICE TO THEIR COM-
MUNITIES 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. 
DEAN. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Mont-
gomery County, Philadelphia, and all 
of Pennsylvania mourn the tragic loss 
of two State troopers: Branden Sisca 
and Martin Mack, III; and a pedestrian, 
Mr. Reyes Rivera Oliveras, of Allen-
town. All three were killed by an al-
leged drunk driver on I–95 near Lincoln 
Financial Field on March 21. 
I want to take a moment to remem-
ber State Troopers Branden Sisca and 
Martin Mack, and their extraordinary 
lives of service. 
From an early age, they both had an 
incredible drive to serve and were ex-
amples of leadership. Branden Sisca, 
just 29, volunteered for the Trappe Fire 
Company from the age of 16 and rose to 
chief. He is survived by his wife, Brit-
tany. They are expecting a baby girl in 
July. 
Martin Mack, just 33, first served as 
a member of the National Guard. He 
was a devoted husband to his wife, 
Stephanie, and father to two daugh-
ters, Olivia and Rowan. 
It is heartbreaking to lose such ex-
traordinary 
men 
so 
tragically 
so 
young. I pray for their families. God 
bless them. May their memories be a 
blessing. 
f 
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS 
BURDENED BY INFLATION 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Mr. Speaker, thanks to 
President Biden’s disastrous tax-and- 
spend policies, the American people are 
now facing the highest levels of infla-
tion in more than 40 years. Americans 
have seen the effects of inflation in 
their paychecks, at the gas pumps, and 
in the grocery stores ever since Joe 
Biden took office. 
The latest Bloomberg report con-
cludes that the average U.S. household 
will have to earn an extra $5,000 this 
year just to keep up with inflation. 
Instead of scaling back wasteful gov-
ernment 
spending, 
the 
President’s 
budget calls for the highest sustained 
spending and taxes in American his-
tory. Fanning the flames of inflation 
with 
more 
reckless 
spending 
only 
makes it harder for American families 
to afford essentials. 
Instead, 
Congress 
must 
work 
to 
eliminate waste and enable Americans 
to reclaim control of their money and 
their lives.

April 7, 2022 
PASTOR DAVID SMITH AND LADY 
LINDA 
SMITH 
SELFLESSLY 
SERVE THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD 
(Ms. GARCIA of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize two Houston- 
area leaders, Pastor David Smith and 
his wife, Lady Linda Smith. 
Many strong community leaders go 
unnoticed. They serve silently every 
day and draw very little attention to 
themselves, quietly doing their work. 
Yet through their service, they enrich 
and improve the lives of everyone 
around them. 
Pastor Smith and Lady Smith are 
both quiet, everyday heroes who put 
smiles on faces across the district and 
particularly in the Eastex/Jensen Free-
way community. Through their faith- 
based work, they spread positivity and 
hope to countless Houstonians. 
They are also very active in commu-
nity activities and are the lead orga-
nizers of the Houston area’s annual 
Jensen Jubilee Fall Festival. Pastor 
Smith is more like the mayor of the 
Eastex/Jensen Freeway area. 
Pastor Smith and Lady Linda Smith 
embody the Houston spirit of service, 
compassion, and volunteerism. I am 
proud they are my constituents, and I 
thank them for their selfless commu-
nity service.

CONGRATULATING 
HUNTINGTON 
HIGH 
SCHOOL 
GIRLS 
BASKET-
BALL TEAM 
(Mrs. 
MILLER 
of 
West 
Virginia 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER of West Virginia. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the Huntington High School girls bas-
ketball team. The team won the cham-
pionship title, and they finished their 
season with a 24–1 record. They are the 
only team to win in the newly devel-
oped AAAA division. 
While there is no ‘‘I’’ in team, they 
were led by Dionna Gray and coached 
by the legendary Lonnie Lucas, who 
has devoted 54 years of his life to 
coaching. 
Congratulations for this outstanding 
accomplishment. 
f 
HAPPY 104TH BIRTHDAY TO DAISY 
MURRAY 
(Ms. LEE of California asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. LEE of California. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today to honor one of my incred-
ible constituents, Mrs. Daisy Murray, 
who will be celebrating her 104th birth-
day on Monday, April 11. Mrs. Murray 
has been a resident of San Leandro for 
more than 30 years and has made many 
wonderful contributions to our East 
Bay community. 
Mrs. Daisy Murray was born in 1919 
to a family that was only a few genera-
tions removed from slavery, as her 
grandmother was the daughter of an 
enslaved person. Mrs. Murray’s parents 
faced racism and violence living in the 
South, and when they got married, 
they relocated to Ohio, where Ms. 
Daisy was born and raised. 
I think it was in the mid-1970s, Mrs. 
Murray founded the Sojourner Truth 
Manor, the first affordable residency 
for adults and seniors in the country 
created by an African-American busi-
nesswoman. 
I worked very hard on this when I 
was a student at Mills College, and I 
remember a woman we called Ms. 
Dorothy, worked with Mrs. Murray on 
this. It is still a thriving community, 
the affordable housing community. It 
is located in Oakland on Martin Luther 
King Jr. Way. It still exists to this day, 
and it has housed generations of adults 
and seniors in need. 
On behalf of the 13th Congressional 
District of California, I want to thank 
Mrs. Daisy Murray for her many good 
works and everything that she has 
done to enrich our East Bay commu-
nity. I wish her a happy 104th birthday. 
Happy birthday, Mrs. Daisy Murray. 
f 
WORST INFLATION CRISIS IN 40 
YEARS 
(Mr. SMITH of Missouri asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, 
Americans are facing the worst infla-
tion crisis in 40 years because of the 
Democrats’ reckless spending agenda, 
including President Biden’s $2 trillion 
bailout bill. 
President Biden’s new budget delib-
erately doubles down on that agenda. 
It spends $73 trillion over the next 10 
years, a 66 percent increase. The Presi-
dent’s budget assumes inflation will 
average 4.7 percent this year. Right 
now, inflation is 7.9 percent. To hit 
their target, inflation would have to be 
2 percent, starting today, every month 
for the next 10 years. 
Despite ample warning that the 
President’s agenda would fuel the infla-
tion fire, inflation has now risen 8.9 
percent since President Biden took of-
fice. Hardworking families have al-
ready paid a $3,500 inflation tax last 
year and are expected to pay a $5,200 
inflation tax this year. The American 
people can’t afford that. 
f 
VIRGINIA IS GRATEFUL FOR 
MARCUS TUCK’S SERVICE 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I 
stand here to recognize the service of 
Marcus Tuck of Crewe, Virginia. 
During the Korean war, Mr. Tuck 
served in the United States Army. He 
was part of E Company, 223rd Infantry 
Regiment, 40th Division. He served 
honorably and dutifully, but for dec-
ades, Mr. Tuck never received the med-
als he was owed, the medals he earned. 
This year, my office worked with Mr. 
Tuck and fought to get Mr. Tuck the 
medals he rightfully earned nearly 70 
years ago. For his brave service to our 
country, Mr. Tuck earned the Good 
Conduct Medal. He earned the National 
Defense Service Medal. He earned the 
Korean Service Medal with two bronze 
service stars. He earned the Combat In-
fantryman Badge 1st Award, and he 
earned the United Nations Service 
Medal. 
On behalf of a grateful Seventh Dis-
trict, the Commonwealth of Virginia, 
and our country, I thank Marcus Tuck 
for his commitment to our beloved Na-
tion. I am humbled to call him a con-
stituent, and I am honored to be able 
to deliver these physical reminders of 
his service to him and his family. 
I also want to recognize the Crewe 
Gold Star Memorial VFW Post 7189 for 
getting Mr. Tuck in touch with our of-
fice and for making sure he received 
the medals and the recognition that 
had long been deferred. 
As an American people, we are 
stronger when we honor our veterans, 
remember their stories, and carry on-
ward the torch of their legacy. Thank 
you for your service, Mr. Tuck.

REMEMBERING ROY NUNNALLY 
ROBERTS, SR. 
(Mr. HICE of Georgia asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I 
rise today in memory of a great Geor-
gian, a staunch conservative, a lifelong 
patriot, and a dear friend, Roy Roberts, 
Sr., from Walton County, Georgia. He 
was born in Atlanta, December 13, 1940. 
He was an incredible athlete, playing 
basketball for the University of Ken-
tucky, where he was credited as being 
one of their all-time best defensive 
players. While at Kentucky, he met Su-
zanne Polk, and they married in 1963 
before putting their roots in Monroe, 
Georgia. 
Roy was very active in his commu-
nity. He was one of the biggest leaders 
in the Republican Party, which was his 
passion. In fact, in 2001, he became the 
chairman of Walton County Republican 
Party, which he proudly held that posi-
tion for 20 years, leading Walton Coun-
ty’s GOP to become one of the leading 
counties in our State. 
He was famous for hosting an incred-
ible barbecue every year that drew 
hundreds of people, and every can-
didate in the Republican Party really 
had to be a part of that incredible 
event. 
Georgia lost a giant last week. I and 
Walton County lost a dear friend. We 
will miss Roy Roberts tremendously. 
To his family, we extend our heartfelt 
prayers and love.

REMEMBERING GLORIA TANNER’S 
LIFE OF SERVICE 
(Mr. NEGUSE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and remember the life 
and legacy of my dear friend and a 
proud Coloradan, Gloria Tanner, who 
we lost earlier this week. 
In 1985, Gloria became the second 
ever African-American representative 
elected to the Colorado House of Rep-
resentatives, and in 1994 she became 
the 
first 
African-American 
woman 
State senator in Colorado history. 
Long before her passing, she was in-
ducted into Colorado Women’s Hall of 
Fame. She was an incredibly accom-
plished leader. We have lost an extraor-
dinary public servant, a remarkable 
human being, and a loving and devoted 
friend. Her commitment to advocacy 
benefited 
countless 
communities 
throughout the country, and she had a 
profound impact on my own life. I have 
no doubt that her leadership and dedi-
cation will continue to inspire genera-
tions for years to come. 
Mr. Speaker, we all stand on the 
shoulders of giants, and Gloria Tanner 
was one of those giants. We will miss 
her deeply. My thoughts and prayers go 
out to her family.

KEEP TITLE 42 IN PLACE 
(Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. MILLER-MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to address the ongoing cri-
sis on our border with Mexico. 
Last week, the CDC announced they 
would officially rescind their title 42 
order on May 23. Title 42 is an impor-
tant tool for DHS to help mitigate the 
potential spread of COVID–19 and other 
infectious diseases. 
Title 42 health restrictions should be 
in place until we have border security. 
Given the number of crossings we are 
seeing, we are far from having a secure 
border. 
CBP is encountering more than 5,500 
migrants daily. Some reports indicate 
that there could be upward of 18,000 mi-
grants per day encountered when title 
42 is lifted next month. To put this in 
perspective, President Obama’s Sec-
retary of Homeland Security, Jeh 
Johnson, stated in his tenure that 1,000 
apprehensions a day would be consid-
ered a bad day. 
Over a year ago, I introduced my 
first piece of legislation, the REACT 
Act, which would require DHS to test 
all migrants illegally crossing our bor-
der for COVID–19. 
It is time to work in a bipartisan 
manner to secure our border; halt ille-
gal drugs and human trafficking; sup-
port law enforcement; and ensure the 
safety of all of our communities. 
REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 3807 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Mr. Speaker, I hereby 
remove my name as cosponsor of H.R.

GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 3807. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 3807, the Relief for Restaurants 
and other Hard Hit Small Businesses 
Act of 2022. 
This bill will provide $42 billion to re-
plenish the Restaurant Revitalization 
Fund and allocate $13 billion to launch 
a new industry-neutral relief program 
for the small businesses most impacted 
by the pandemic. 
Last year, Congress created the RRF 
under the American Rescue Plan to 
provide targeted relief to struggling 
small restaurants. The program deliv-
ered emergency aid to over 100,000 em-
ployers in communities across the 
country. This grant was a critical life-
line and allowed businesses to keep 
their lights on and continue to pay 
their employees. 
Despite the program’s success, ap-
proximately 177,000 small businesses 
are still awaiting relief. While these 
companies are dispersed throughout 
the country, they are united by a com-
mon message: Small firms are still 
hurting, and they are counting on Con-
gress for more support. 
That is why we must act to replenish 
the RRF and deliver long-awaited aid 
to 
hundreds 
of 
thousands 
of 
res-
taurants across the country. 
H.R. 3807 also takes the crucial step 
of creating a new $13 billion hard-hit 
industries award program, which will 
extend aid to businesses with the 
greatest revenue losses that were ineli-
gible or unable to access relief through 
other means. Rather than picking win-
ners and losers, this industry-neutral 
program makes hard-hit companies the 
priority. 
These programs are offset by uti-
lizing recovered money from fraud 
cases in the pandemic relief programs. 
Congress will take the money that was 
fraudulently obtained and put it in the 
hands of small businesses that need it 
the most.

sponse Accountability Committee, and

H4405 
April 7, 2022 
the Department of Justice are all 
working aggressively to investigate 
and prosecute instances of fraud and 
abuse, and this bill provides them with 
much-needed support. By allocating $30 
million to oversight funding, today’s 
legislation ensures these offices have 
the resources needed to pursue bad ac-
tors and reclaim money Congress in-
tended to help small businesses. 
Small employers and entrepreneurs 
are the backbone of our communities 
and economies, and they cannot be ig-
nored. Without today’s legislation, our 
local communities risk losing these 
critical job creators. We simply cannot 
ignore them in their time of need. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
have come together numerous times 
throughout the pandemic to pass legis-
lation to support small firms. Today 
gives us the opportunity to do that 
once more. 
I urge my colleagues to meet this 
moment and pass this bill so that these 
businesses can stop treading water and 
start looking to the future. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to 
H.R. 3807, as amended. Here we are 
today to discuss yet another spending 
bill that will add to our Nation’s debt 
and deficit and continue to spike infla-
tion; another bill that creates a new 
government program without regard to 
the effectiveness or management of ex-
isting programs; another bill that has 
been rushed to the floor without a com-
mittee markup or a CBO score. 
In fact, the latest draft of this legis-
lation was sent out last Friday night 
and has been amended since. This is 
not how we should legislate, Mr. 
Speaker. We must do a better job for 
our Nation’s small businesses that cre-
ate two out of every three new jobs in 
America. 
I am sure I am not the only one who 
has experienced de´ja`
vu by my col-
leagues’ agenda to spend now and think 
later. 
This agenda is not working for Main 
Street America. The Small Business 
and 
Entrepreneurship 
Council 
con-
ducted a recent poll of small business 
owners and found that only 5 percent of 
small business owners report that 
‘‘Congress’ policies are helping the 
economy and small businesses like 
mine.’’ Just 5 percent, so that means 95 
percent, Mr. Speaker, don’t like what 
is going on. 
While we are sitting here in Wash-
ington, D.C., deciding whether to spend 
more money for certain industries, 
Main 
Street 
is 
experiencing 
price 
shocks that have not been felt in over 
40 years. 
Inflation is burning through our Na-
tion at a rapid pace. From food and 
shelter to gas and energy, prices in 
every category of life are increasing 
exponentially with no end in sight. 
The Consumer Price Index stands at 
7.9 percent annually, and the producer 
price index, which is the wholesale 
price index, is now at 10 percent. That 
makes short-term inflation look pretty 
bleak from the standpoint that if the 
wholesale price index is 10 and the CPI 
7.9, we are going to have some more in-
flation, some high prices. There is no 
doubt about it. 
American families are feeling the 
pain, Mr. Speaker. Businesses feel this 
pain. The Nation’s smallest firms are 
suffering. In fact, small business own-
ers are reporting that their number one 
problem is inflation. 
The second most pressing issue for 
small business is the price of gas. 
These price shocks hit them every sin-
gle day. 
Today, we are considering injecting 
more money into the system, which 
will simply fuel the fire of inflation. 
There is no doubt that small busi-
nesses suffered from the COVID–19 pan-
demic and the lockdowns that shut 
down Main Street. It has been just over 
2 years since the CARES Act was 
signed into law. Since that time, we 
have spent approximately $6 trillion as 
a Nation to fight COVID–19. 
Small businesses alone have received 
$1.2 trillion in forgivable loans and 
other grants. I am proud of the bipar-
tisan relief that Congress provided 
small businesses throughout this pan-
demic, including the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, which supported many 
small 
businesses, 
including 
res-
taurants, in keeping their businesses 
afloat and employees on the payroll. 
The goal then was to quickly get dol-
lars out the door to support our Na-
tion’s job creators during this time of 
crisis. But now, our Nation as a whole 
has learned much more about this pan-
demic. We have learned how to safely 
go about our lives. 
This bill is a disingenuous attempt to 
posture to small businesses by my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle. If 
Democrats were serious about helping 
restaurants and small businesses, they 
would have called for an end to the 
ever-changing mandates and lockdowns 
that forced so many businesses to close 
their doors. They would have accepted 
my amendment during committee to 
adequately fund this program from the 
start. They would have considered my 
bill when it was introduced in July, the 
ENTREE Act, which responsibly refills 
the Restaurant Revitalization Program 
and is fully paid for, which this bill we 
are here for today is not. 
When the government attempts to 
solve problems without the input of 
small businesses, they create more 
problems, Mr. Speaker. 
Have my Democrat counterparts on 
the other side ever asked a small busi-
ness owner if they are now capable of 
opening and operating safely? 
Have they ever asked them whether 
they can now unlock their doors, turn 
on their lights, and protect their work-
ers? 
Have they ever asked them if they 
are able to now welcome customers and 
community members back into their 
storefronts carefully? 
I have, and the answer from small 
businesses is a resounding yes. 
Small businesses are some of the 
most innovative and nimble enterprises 
in America. They can pivot quickly, 
and most importantly, they can adapt 
to any situation with speed. 
They are the entrepreneurs of our 
country that drive our country. They 
can figure out how to slice the bread 
thinner. They know how to do this. We 
saw this over the last 2 years. 
At this time, small businesses need 
the freedom to operate independently 
without 
Washington 
watching 
over 
them. We must end the COVID econ-
omy of government handouts. 
Furthermore, this bill creates an-
other new grant program at the SBA. 
The SBA, in my judgment, is incapable 
of operating grant programs. 
Let’s briefly examine how they have 
performed over the last 2 years, Mr. 
Speaker. The Economic Injury Disaster 
Loan program, known as EIDL, is filled 
with fraud and identity theft issues. 
This is per the IG, the inspector gen-
eral, in his report. 
The SBA is a black hole when it 
comes to answering questions for con-
stituent businesses. We have all had 
businesses in our district struggle with 
getting information for the grant ap-
plication. 
Frankly, this direct lending and di-
rect grant program in the SBA has 
been a disaster with a 30 percent fraud 
rate. That is the IG report number. 
Yet, the SBA continues to defer EIDL 
payments. 
The second program was the Shut-
tered Venue Operators Grant program. 
The SVOG was signed into law in De-
cember 2020. Disappointingly, and after 
long delays, the SBA attempted to 
launch this program in April, 4 months 
later. 
My colleagues and I sent multiple 
letters to the SBA regarding this 
delay. The night before it went live, 
SBA’s inspector general sent out a 
warning signal. He said: SBA, you are 
not ready to do this. You are not up 
and running yet. 
But did they listen? Of course not. 
They went ahead anyway, and within 
hours, the whole program crashed. The 
program then took 2 more months to 
launch. 
This is unacceptable, Mr. Speaker. 
We have to do a better job than this. 
They have to do a better job than this. 
The last program was the Restaurant 
Revitalization Fund. I would like to re-
mind everyone that this program was 
woefully underfunded by my Democrat 
colleagues. 
However, more shocking was the fact 
that 
congressional 
Democrats, 
the 
Biden administration, and the SBA 
prioritized certain businesses over oth-
ers. The RRF program was fundamen-
tally unfair. They picked winners and 
losers with American taxpayer dollars.

It was so bad, the Sixth Circuit Court 
of Appeals declared this program un-
constitutional, Mr. Speaker. They de-
clared the whole program unconstitu-
tional. 
The Court’s majority opinion stated 
that the SBA injected explicit racial 
and ethnic preferences into the prior-
ities. 
Enough is enough. If you judge the 
future by the past, as my dad once 
said, it is clear the SBA is unable to 
properly and prudently manage grant 
programs and safeguard American tax-
payer dollars. 
Not only does the SBA have a disas-
trous past of administering grant pro-
grams, but any new dollars flowing will 
add fuel to the inflation fire. 
I want to be clear; this bill is sup-
posedly paid for by recovered funds. At 
best, this is an IOU, Mr. Speaker. It is 
not a real or immediate offset. I agree 
that we need to track down and hold 
fraudsters accountable, and I applaud 
that process. I support it entirely. But 
this process takes time, and it is not 
going to get all those dollars back. 
For example, according to testimony 
provided by SBA’s inspector general at 
a hearing in January, the total recov-
eries by his office in fiscal year 2021 
was $4.2 billion. In the same testimony, 
and in collaboration with Secret Serv-
ice, the inspector general reports that 
they have seized another $1 billion in 
the EIDL program. And lastly, and, 
again, according to the IG, financial in-
stitutions returned approximately $3.1 
billion in fraudulent funding. That is 
not near enough to cover the $55 billion 
that this program wants to spend. 
Now more than ever, small busi-
nesses need to escape the overbearing 
reach of the Federal Government. 
If we want to help small businesses, 
then we need to stop this out-of-con-
trol spending. We should prioritize low-
ering taxes so small business owners 
and their workers can keep more of 
their hard-earned money. We must re-
duce regulations that bog small busi-
nesses down with paperwork and com-
pliance costs. 
I would argue that the 2017 Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act is the reason we have the 
good economy we have today because 
we continue to allow the business indi-
viduals to keep their hard-earned dol-
lars and invest them as they see fit, 
whereas, if we tax them to death, those 
dollars come out of the system, and we 
limit their ability to drive our econ-
omy. 
We simply need to move on from this 
COVID economy. 
In my judgment, this is an irrespon-
sible bill. I urge my colleagues to op-
pose it. This is about economic inde-
pendence. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished House majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding. 
And I would respond, this bill is 
about economic resilience. You can’t 
be independent if you go bankrupt. You 
can’t be independent if you can’t oper-
ate your business. I have gone into res-
taurant after restaurant in my district, 
and the owners of those restaurants 
have had thanks for me, for the Con-
gress, and, yes, for the administration, 
including Donald Trump, who signed 
many of these bills, that at a time of 
extraordinary stress—through no fault 
of their own, but a pandemic that at-
tacked all of us—they were able to 
keep their heads above water, pay their 
employees, even if they couldn’t be 
open, transfer to carry out, and do so 
many things that they were able to do 
to remain viable, which is, by the way, 
why almost every State has a surplus. 
Why? Because revenues did not fall 
as they were projected to fall. That is 
true in my State. I think it is true in 
almost every State. 
Why didn’t revenues fall? Because we 
kept people above water. 
Now, in this particular program that 
passed—in many respects with bipar-
tisan support in 2020, December of 2020, 
as well—there were some 250,000-plus 
who were eligible under the rules that 
we drafted and passed but only about 
100,000 of them got relief, which means 
that we left behind 150,000 people who 
were eligible under the rules that we 
set. 
And now some would say to those 
that were left behind, You are on your 
own. That is not what we are going to 
do today. We are not going to tell them 
you are on your own. We are going to 
tell them we understand how impor-
tant you are to the life of our country, 
to the economy of our country, to the 
people of our country. 
When we enacted the American Res-
cue Plan—which I want to make clear 
did not get any Republican votes—we 
set aside $28.6 billion in emergency 
grants to help restaurants and bars 
that have experienced significant rev-
enue losses due to COVID–19 restric-
tions. 
Those restrictions were necessary, 
which is why, hopefully, we are coming 
out of not only the initial assault but 
the variants’ assault. 
The aim was to help them stay open 
to keep their employees on the payroll. 
I suggest if we had not done that, it 
wouldn’t be independence that they 
would have experienced, they would 
have experienced recession and perhaps 
depression. 
That funding quickly ran out, how-
ever, with only a third of restaurants 
that applied for assistance ultimately 
receiving it. 
The legislation before us today would 
replenish the Small Business Adminis-
tration’s 
Restaurant 
Revitalization 
Fund with an additional $42 billion so 
that the more than 150,000 restaurants 
still waiting in the cue can finally get 
the help they need. 
Those applicants have been waiting 
since funding ran out last year. And ac-
cording to the Independent Restaurant 
Coalition, Mr. Speaker, 86 percent of 
owners indicated that they may close 
down if they aren’t able to access these 
grants. 
More than 90,000 restaurants and bars 
already have shut down in this pan-
demic. Think about the impact of that 
on neighborhoods, communities, and 
local economies. 
Congress should act and act quickly. 
I share the view of the gentleman 
who spoke before me that we need to 
make sure that we eliminate fraud, we 
eliminate abuse, and that we claw back 
money 
that 
was 
received 
through 
fraud. All that does is hurt those who 
really need it. And what this legisla-
tion says is we are going to get back 
that money that was fraudulently re-
ceived by individuals and give it to 
people who legitimately need it and 
qualify, such as restaurants, gyms, 
health clubs, salons, music venues, and 
other places where people hope to con-
gregate but couldn’t because of nec-
essary pandemic restrictions. 
They will get a lifeline as we all hope 
to get ‘‘back to normal.’’ We all want 
to be back to normal. But we want to 
be back to normal with businesses that 
are still alive, still able to serve the 
public. 
Importantly, that lifeline to keep le-
gitimate small businesses afloat is paid 
for, as I said, by recapturing funds that 
were earlier disbursed to fraudulent ap-
plicants. 
We are going after bad actors and re-
warding good actors. 
While this is an issue important to so 
many members of our caucus, I thank 
Representative BLUMENAUER for spon-
soring this legislation, as well as Rep-
resentative PHILLIPS
for his cham-
pioning this cause over the past several 
months. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this legislation and the small 
businesses that it will help and the 
millions of employees that it will help. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the majority leader’s re-
marks. I also support trying to help 
restaurants. That is the reason we are 
here this morning. 
But I do have a bill that is paid for 
that this one does not do. And I think 
that the preferences that were allowed 
that were shown to be unconstitutional 
is the reason we are here this morning, 
so we can find a way to fund the rest of 
those folks, which I think is important 
for our communities. And I agree, and 
I appreciate those remarks by the lead-
er. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he 
may consume to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. WILLIAMS), the 
vice ranking member of the Committee 
on Small Business and a small business 
champion in his own right. 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Mr. Speak-
er, it has been more than 2 years since 
COVID–19 shut down the world and 
forced businesses to close for months. 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, 
Congress has spent—we have already 
talked about it—$6.6 trillion to help

H4407 
April 7, 2022 
American businesses get back on track 
to financial recovery after enduring 
months of forced government closures. 
At that time, aid was critical for 
businesses to survive the pandemic, but 
we must now let the free market work 
and stop frivolously spending billions 
more in the name of COVID–19. 
This attempt by Democrats to spend 
billions of taxpayer dollars is irrespon-
sible and will only add fuel to the 
growing inflation crisis that we have. 
Americans are currently experiencing 
tough times right now trying to find 
out how to beat, frankly, the Federal 
Government. 
Inflation and energy prices are the 
primary concerns for small businesses. 
And I am a small business owner for 51 
years; I still employ hundreds of peo-
ple. So those are the concerns they 
have. And more Federal spending is 
only going to strain businesses further. 
It is simple: to lower costs for hard-
working families and businessowners, 
we need to cut spending. We need to 
cut it, not spend more money that we 
don’t have. When you spend money you 
print and you spend money you don’t 
have, it is called inflation. 
We should be focusing on getting con-
trol of the crisis at the southern bor-
der, lowering gas prices, managing sup-
ply chain disruptions—I am in the car 
business, so I can talk about that—that 
are 
leaving 
shelves 
empty 
and 
incentivizing people to get back to 
work, not not work. 
In order to get back to the thriving 
economy we had prepandemic under 
the Trump administration, Democrats 
must end this emergency COVID spend-
ing charade. Hey, it is over. We are 
done with it. Let’s move on. 
And I always get a kick out of people 
that say they want to protect Main 
Street. Well, it is funny because a lot 
of those people wanting to protect 
Main Street are bureaucrats that never 
signed the front of a check. They never 
met a payroll. They have been up here 
all their lives. But they want to help 
Main Street. And the fact of the mat-
ter is we need to cut taxes. We need to 
cut regulations. 
So if it is so important to help Main 
Street, why do Democrats and liberals 
want to raise taxes all the time? That 
doesn’t help Main Street. I want to 
help Main Street, but I want to raise 
taxes. That is the wrong way to go 
about it. 
So the bottom line is this: We have a 
better bill. I urge all of my colleagues 
to oppose H.R. 3807 and reject Demo-
crats’ false claims that this bill is fully 
paid for. It is fully paid for on the 
backs of Main Street America. In God 
we trust. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. BLUMENAUER), the long- 
time champion of the Restaurant Revi-
talization Fund. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I 
appreciate the gentlewoman’s cour-
tesy, as I appreciate her tireless leader-
ship on this issue. Her committee has 
performed admirably. I am excited 
about the wide range of areas that you 
have enacted to be able to help the re-
covery that we have seen around the 
country, one of the reasons that we 
have had the largest increase in em-
ployment this last year in American 
history. I think what we have today is 
another chapter in that story. 
Over 2 years ago, I received countless 
late-night texts and phone calls from 
the independent restaurants in my 
community. Portland, Oregon is known 
for its restaurant scene. We set to work 
listening to them to come up with an 
approach that would meet their needs. 
The 
so-called 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program was not adequate. They didn’t 
even know if they were going to be in 
business, let alone paying back a loan. 
We developed this grant program 
after consulting with independent res-
taurants all across the country. The 
neighborhood 
bars 
and 
restaurants 
were the hardest hit since the begin-
ning of the pandemic. They were the 
first to shut down in March of 2020, and 
they accounted for a quarter of the job 
losses; 51⁄2 million workers in April 2020 
alone. And they have been the slowest 
to reopen. 
Yes, they can pivot and adapt, but 
frankly, the unemployment in the in-
dustry remains stubbornly slow to re-
cover. 
Approximately 
90,000 
res-
taurants have already closed perma-
nently since the start of the pandemic, 
and there are a number of others that 
are just hanging on by their fingertips, 
encouraged, in part, by the hope of the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund being 
replenished. 
b 0945 
Restaurants are the cornerstone of a 
livable community. They have em-
ployed nearly 60 percent of Americans 
at some point in their career, myself 
included, and I know a number of peo-
ple in this Chamber identify with that. 
They are a major source of employ-
ment for people of color. And they sup-
port a trillion-dollar supply chain all 
across America. 
The Federal Government has pro-
vided some help to them through the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund, based 
on my RESTAURANTS Act that I first 
introduced in June of 2020. 
But the program fell short. It did not 
have enough money to meet all the ap-
plicants. There were 100,000 grants that 
were life-changing for a number of 
them, but 177,000 hanging in the bal-
ance. 
The Relief for Restaurants and other 
Hard Hit Small Businesses Act finishes 
the job and completes the promise. 
This legislation is simple: It funds 
restaurants that did not receive awards 
that they were otherwise entitled to; it 
helps other battered industries, like 
live events, travel, hospitality, and fit-
ness; and supports shuttered venues. 
And it will be paid for with the fraudu-
lent pandemic relief funds yet to be re-
covered. 
Now, while the COVID case numbers 
are low and the American public is 
ready to move beyond the pandemic, 
our small, independent restaurants and 
other businesses have not fully recov-
ered. This is why the legislation is crit-
ical. 
It is a response to very real chal-
lenges, thinking about what they faced 
in terms of that brittle supply chain; 
what they faced in terms of changing 
regulations; the public being deeply 
concerned in terms of health. It is time 
for us to finish the job that we started. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 30 
seconds. 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. It is time to fin-
ish the job that we started. We don’t 
want any ruthless, free-market ide-
ology getting in the way of these hard-
working, innovative people who have 
put their lives and careers on the line 
investing everything, hoping that they 
could have the promise of the Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund fulfilled. 
This 
legislation 
does 
that, 
and 
I 
strongly urge its adoption. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
am not sure what ruthless, idiotic ide-
ology the gentleman was just talking 
about, but I think capitalism is a pret-
ty good ideology with which to gen-
erate the kind of activity it takes to 
make an economy go. I think we saw 
the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 has 
done that job. 
Whenever they talk about the largest 
increase in employment history, it is 
pretty easy to have a low bar when you 
start talking about where we were in 
the pandemic. The bar you should be 
talking about is where we were prior to 
the pandemic, and we are still below 
that number. 
Mr. Speaker, it is exciting for me 
this morning to be able to yield such 
time as he may consume to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
MEUSER), who is the ranking member 
of the Small Business Subcommittee 
on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital 
Access. 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Ranking Member LUETKEMEYER for the 
great work that he does for small busi-
nesses. 
Mr. Speaker, when I speak to small 
businesses 
throughout 
my 
district, 
they tell me that they are fraught by 
skyrocketing inflation, rising energy 
costs, workforce shortages, burden-
some regulations, just regular hassles 
coming from the type of regulations 
that have been imposed and the type of 
tax burdens and such. 
The Biden administration continues, 
however, to push a policy agenda that 
is absolutely detrimental to small 
business—there is no question about 
it—creating additional headwinds such 
as inflation. Let’s talk about inflation. 
The excessive and unnecessary spend-
ing enacted by Democrats in the last 14 
months, exceeding $2 trillion, well over 
$2 trillion just in the rescue plan, al-
most $9 trillion over the course of the 
last couple of years, has obviously con-
tributed to the record levels of infla-
tion; up nearly 8 percent since last

April 7, 2022 
year, just last year alone, the highest 
level since 1981. 
We look back on that as the most 
historic inflation ever. Well, it is hap-
pening now, and yet, we are talking 
about exacerbating it with higher lev-
els of spending. 
Let’s talk about energy prices. The 
Biden administration’s blatant and de-
liberate detrimental policies on domes-
tic energy production has caused prices 
at the pump to nearly double since last 
year, making it clearly more difficult 
for small businesses to get their goods 
to market; making it more difficult for 
customers to get to the small busi-
nesses. 
We must support our domestic en-
ergy production and make energy af-
fordable again. It is almost that sim-
ple. 
Let’s talk about the workforce short-
ages. Disincentives to work, extended 
by the American Rescue Plan, have 
made it very difficult for small busi-
nesses to recruit and retain workers. 
We should all know that. Go visit any 
small business and they will tell you 
just that. 
Sure, it is starting to come back, as 
it would once those incentives not to 
work were minimized or eliminated. 
That is what we need to do, create in-
centives to work, not discourage work. 
Let’s talk about tax increases. The 
persistent threat of increased taxes 
from Democrats in Congress and the 
Biden 
administration 
send 
shivers 
down the spine of small businesses, cre-
ates enormous uncertainty, while it 
makes it difficult for them to plan and 
invest in their businesses. 
Let’s talk about regulations. Since 
taking office 14 months ago, the Biden 
administration has instituted hundreds 
of new regulations costing over $200 
billion in real terms, and burdening 
businesses with what has been esti-
mated as 130 million hours of addi-
tional paperwork. 
Instead of saddling our small busi-
nesses with burdensome and costly reg-
ulations, we should be trying to actu-
ally create an environment that breeds 
growth and success and allows owners 
to invest in their business and employ-
ees. 
The solution to the difficulties that 
America’s small businesses are facing 
is not to pump $55 billion of new, un-
paid spending into the economy. This 
will exacerbate much of what I just 
went through. 
Mr. Speaker, there is no reason just 
to criticize legislation without a solu-
tion. We have a solution, the ENTREE 
Act, introduced by Ranking Member 
LUETKEMEYER, is fully paid for and de-
livers $60 billion in aid to America’s 
restaurants who were excluded by the 
previous Democrats’ unconstitutional 
and discriminatory RRF rollout which 
was proven illegal. 
Unlike the bill we are considering 
today, the ENTREE Act would replen-
ish the Restaurant Revitalization Fund 
by repurposing unused American Res-
cue Plan dollars and would not further 
contribute to the hyperinflation that 
all American small businesses—and our 
deficit—that all businesses are bur-
dened by today and, again, the highest 
since nearly 50 years. 
So, the real solution is a smart, re-
sponsible approach that provides tar-
geted relief without exacerbating the 
many crises small business owners are 
facing today. 
Every idea, Mr. Speaker, in this Con-
gress cannot be solved by spending bil-
lions of dollars more of taxpayer 
money, as stated earlier, over $10 tril-
lion in excess over the last 2 years. It 
has got to stop somewhere, sometime. 
We need to stop this out-of-control 
spending, reduce inflation, stop the as-
sault on domestic energy production, 
lower energy costs, and create a busi-
ness environment that is friendly to 
growth, not friendly to a tax, spend, 
and over-regulatory Big Government. 
The solution, again, is not difficult. 
But it must be definitely not adding 
another $55 billion of spending. Amer-
ican job creators need to be the most 
competitive in the world. We need to 
do what we can do to create an envi-
ronment for that. 
The policies of the Biden administra-
tion and far too many Democrats in 
this House have made life more dif-
ficult for small businesses. This must 
change. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. CAR-
TER), a member of the Small Business 
Committee. 
Mr. 
CARTER 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I am proud to represent 
southeast Louisiana in Congress, a re-
gion that is rightfully famous for its 
community, its culture, and its incred-
ible food. 
Around 9,000 restaurants in Louisiana 
applied for the Restaurant Revitaliza-
tion Act in the American Rescue Plan. 
Less than 3,000 received funding. It is 
clear, the need to replenish this legis-
lation is great and must happen. 
Today, we will continue to fight for 
the help of small businesses and fami-
lies during the pandemic as we pass the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund Re-
plenishment Act, providing an addi-
tional $60 million for the Restaurant 
Revitalization Fund. 
Louisiana thrives on tourism and 
hospitality, and the restaurant sector 
is critical in the State’s economy. I am 
so grateful that this bill now includes 
provisions that I proposed in the bipar-
tisan MUSIC Act, which would include 
members of the entertainment indus-
try, like live event companies who 
have yet to have access to industry- 
specific economic relief funding. 
I am proud to vote ‘‘yes’’ today and 
stand 
with 
small 
businesses 
that 
strengthen and enrich our local econo-
mies. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining on each side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Missouri has 11 minutes 
remaining. The gentlewoman from New 
York has 20 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield such time as he may consume to 
the distinguished gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. DONALDS), one of our newest 
members on the committee. 
Mr. DONALDS. Mr. Speaker, I want 
to thank the gentleman from Missouri 
for giving me such latitude. 
$55 billion that we don’t have, folks. 
42 billion, goes into this new—the reau-
thorization of the Restaurant Revital-
ization Fund. Another $13 billion going 
to target business owners who have 
less than 200 employees. 
I know that there are restaurant 
owners and small business owners in 
the United States who are looking for 
relief every single day. They are trying 
to find a way to make ends meet. 
How do I know this? Because in the 
beginning of my career, a lot of what I 
did was analyze the very business own-
ers who are struggling in today’s econ-
omy. And in today’s economy, they are 
struggling for a myriad of reasons. 
Number one, our energy prices. When 
the price of oil shoots up so drastically, 
it impacts transportation; it impacts 
how they get the material that they 
sell in their stores every single day. 
Wage inflation, which is completely 
out of control in the United States. 
When wages go up, the costs of doing 
business goes up, no matter what any 
politician on Capitol Hill says. 
So throwing more money at this situ-
ation, especially money that has never 
been appropriated; money that is going 
to come out of thin air, is not going to 
make matters better for small business 
owners; it is going to make them 
worse. 
The ranking member on the Small 
Business Committee, the gentleman 
from Missouri (Mr. LUETKEMEYER), has 
a bill, the ENTREE Act, that reauthor-
izes funds that have already been ap-
propriated to be used to help small 
business owners who were caught in 
this lurch; money that they could use. 
It is paid for. 
It will not put more dollars in cir-
culation, which is one of the key issues 
we are having in our economy with re-
spect to the inflation that is stifling 
small business. It is stifling working 
families. It is stifling seniors who are 
on fixed incomes. 
But it is more than just money com-
ing from Capitol Hill. It is the eco-
nomic policy coming from 1600 Penn-
sylvania Avenue. 
When you have massive amounts of 
regulations that small business owners 
must comply with, two things occur: 
They spend more time devoted to com-
pliance, or they go out of business. Or, 
I am sorry, there is a third; or they sell 
to a larger business. 
We want small business owners to 
thrive in the United States. We need 
them to thrive in the United States. 
But it is not just money, folks. It is the 
rules that we force them to comply 
with. 
And the last part—I started with en-
ergy; I am going to end with energy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4409 
April 7, 2022 
When energy costs go up in the 
United States, when they go up reck-
lessly and willfully because of terrible 
economic and energy policy from the 
President of the United States, the life-
blood of our economy, which is small 
business, are the ones who feel it the 
most. They are the ones who are af-
fected. They are the ones who struggle 
with it. They are the ones that can’t 
get the materials they need. They are 
the ones whose workers are struggling 
to figure out how to get to work be-
cause gas is now $4.20 a gallon versus 
$2.20 a gallon. 
We have to take a serious look about 
what we are doing from a complete eco-
nomic perspective here on Capitol Hill. 
And it is not just about new money. 
New money sounds good. Everybody 
likes getting new money. But new 
money rarely is the thing that fixes 
the problem. What really fixes the 
problem are sound policies that address 
our entire business economy, so that 
everybody can thrive. 
What really makes sense is having a 
sound and sensible energy policy— 
where you have cheap and affordable, 
whether it is renewable, or whether it 
is fossil fuels—that people can rely on. 
That is the lifeblood of every economy. 
And if we could ever get that stuff 
right, we might have enough sense on 
Capitol Hill to actually handle our 
spending problems. 
b 1000 
If we can’t get basic economics right, 
it is no wonder that Capitol Hill always 
spends far more than it possibly takes 
in. 
We have a measure to actually help 
small business owners right now. It is 
called the ENTREE Act. Small busi-
ness owners will get the help that they 
need. It will work. It will actually help 
us stop being reckless with money we 
don’t have, which we, frankly, are bor-
rowing from the revenues that small 
business owners have to pay in the fu-
ture that they haven’t even earned yet. 
Don’t pass this bill. It is not nec-
essary. It is only more of the same. It 
is more of the problem. It is more in-
flation. It is the destruction of more 
purchasing power of the American peo-
ple. 
We must say ‘‘no’’ today. We need to 
reverse course in the United States. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU), a senior 
member of the Small Business Com-
mittee. 
Ms. CHU. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this legislation to 
fulfill our commitment to the small 
businesses hardest hit by the pan-
demic, like the many in my Los Ange-
les-area district. 
The Restaurant Revitalization Fund 
and the Shuttered Venue Operators 
Grant program have been crucial inter-
ventions to protect the industries most 
reliant on in-person, indoor crowds. 
These were some of the first businesses 
to close and among the last to return 
to full capacity. 
That is why we must pass this legis-
lation to fund $42 billion in pending 
restaurant 
applications, 
give 
live 
venues and theaters more time and 
flexibility to use their funds, and cre-
ate a new program for the hardest hit 
small businesses that still need help to 
keep their doors open. 
This bill would be paid for by going 
after funds stolen by fraudsters, show-
ing the American public that the U.S. 
will not tolerate those who use the 
pandemic to take advantage of small 
businesses in their most dire time of 
need. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield such time as she may con-
sume to the gentlewoman from Texas 
(Ms. VAN DUYNE), who is the ranking 
member on the Small Business Sub-
committee on Oversight, Investiga-
tions, and Regulations. In that posi-
tion, she has been leading the way in 
protecting small businesses. 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I 
have a motion to recommit, and my 
amendment affirms this Chamber’s 
commitment to being a proper steward 
of taxpayer dollars and ensuring the in-
tegrity of SBA’s programs. 
Over 2 years ago, Congress enacted 
and activated numerous relief pro-
grams to rescue the American economy 
from the COVID–19 State and local 
shutdown orders that devastated small 
businesses across the country. Speed 
was of the essence, and Congress fo-
cused on getting dollars out quickly 
before parts of the economy collapsed. 
However, 
criminal 
behavior 
took 
hold as many illegal applicants entered 
programs and scammed others to take 
advantage of this relief. According to 
the SBA inspector general’s estimates, 
over $80 billion of the Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan program payments and 
$4.6 billion of the Paycheck Protection 
Program are potentially fraudulent. 
These are American taxpayer dollars 
that are on the line, and they are being 
misused and stolen. 
We must do everything in Congress’ 
power to stop this illegal behavior and 
ensure that the fraudsters are brought 
to justice. Our oversight capabilities 
must be reinforced and strengthened. 
As the ranking member of the Over-
sight, Investigations, and Regulations 
Subcommittee of the Committee on 
Small Business, I stand ready to ensure 
that these programs are adequately 
built to deter this fraudulent behavior. 
However, we must also ensure that 
law enforcement has the tools at their 
disposal and enough time to complete 
the job. We must lengthen the statute 
of limitations for the loans and grants 
made during this emergency period and 
give the SBA’s inspector general, the 
Secret Service, and the Department of 
Justice the necessary time to launch 
investigations and complete their proc-
ess. 
Five years is simply not enough, es-
pecially when the SBA continues to 
defer payments on EIDL loans. There-
fore, my amendment moves the statute 
of limitations from 5 years to 10 years 
to capture, recover, and seize fraudu-
lent dollars within these COVID–19 
small business relief programs. 
Criminals moved quickly, and they 
did so at a time when those folks who 
needed it the most were unable to get 
these dollars. They took advantage of 
an unprecedented worldwide epidemic. 
In due time, our authorities will find 
them and recover the money that was 
meant to assist Main Street America 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
Our economy is driven by America’s 
small businesses, entrepreneurs, and 
startups, and protecting those relief 
dollars dedicated to them should be a 
top priority for all Members of Con-
gress. 
This amendment is a simple, com-
monsense, and necessary fix. I urge my 
colleagues to support it. It will give 
the time necessary for law enforcement 
to recover our American taxpayer dol-
lars. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEAN). Is there objection to the request 
of the gentlewoman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. EVANS), a member 
of the Small Business Committee. 
Mr. EVANS. Madam Speaker, I am 
proud to cosponsor this bill, which is 
led by my Ways and Means Committee 
colleague from Oregon. 
The Restaurant Revitalization Fund 
has been a lifeline for small businesses 
in Philadelphia and across the country. 
We provided $28 billion to help more 
than 
100,000 
restaurants. 
Unfortu-
nately, the need has been far greater 
than the initial funding. 
This bill would extend the lifeline 
with another $42 billion to help our 
neighborhood restaurants and the peo-
ple they employ as the pandemic con-
tinues. 
Restaurants are part of our small 
business backbone that help to keep 
our communities together and our 
neighbors employed. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, may I inquire how much time I have 
remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has 3 minutes remaining. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-

Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire how much time is re-
maining on our side.

tlewoman has 18 minutes remaining. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I

from Connecticut (Ms. DELAURO), the 
chairwoman of the House Appropria-
tions Committee. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, res-
taurants and small businesses are the 
heart and soul of our communities, but

April 7, 2022 
the pandemic has cost them over $280 
billion in sales, and approximately 
90,000 were forced to close. 
That is why we created the Res-
taurant Revitalization Fund, a historic 
investment to increase aid to res-
taurants and bars hit hardest by the 
pandemic. The funding has run out, 
and restaurants are still struggling. 
In Connecticut, the restaurants have 
been one of the hardest hit sectors by 
the pandemic. Due to high demand, I 
heard from far too many of my con-
stituents who applied on the very first 
day the RRF funds were available and 
were still unable to receive them. We 
must do more to ensure that small 
businesses receive the funding they 
need to survive and continue to serve 
our communities. 
The bill before us does just that by 
providing $42 billion to replenish the 
fund and putting $13 billion toward 
other businesses impacted by the pan-
demic. This bill is the center of our ef-
forts to help these small businesses 
survive and thrive. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
voting in favor of this bill, and I urge 
my colleagues to do the same. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I also 
rise in strong support of this measure. 
This is about economic survival on 
Main Street. This is about helping our 
friends and neighbors that have plowed 
their lifesavings into a small business. 
Just a couple of days ago, I got a 
phone call from Mr. Antonio Cagnolo, 
who has had a restaurant in my neigh-
borhood for dozens of years. He said: 
Lou, for 2 years, I have taken every 
penny that I have to stay in business. 
I am at the end of my rope. If I don’t 
get help, I am out of business, and I am 
going to lay off dozens and dozens of 
workers. Lou, I don’t want a handout; 
I want a hand. I have paid my taxpayer 
dollars for years and years, and now I 
want you, the Federal Government, to 
help me stay alive. 
I said: Mr. Cagnolo, we are going to 
be there for you. We will get you that 
support. 
Folks, today, I ask you to please sup-
port this measure. Please help our 
small businesses on Main Street stay 
alive. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. DINGELL). 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
3807, the Relief for Restaurants and 
other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act. 
As you are hearing from my col-
leagues, the food service industry has 
been one of the hardest hit throughout 
this pandemic, with many restaurants 
temporarily closing their doors or dra-
matically limiting their capacity dur-
ing the worst surges but still feeding 
their community. Far too many are 
never opening again. 
Right now, many more are looking to 
close their doors permanently if we 
don’t give them help and live up to our 
commitment to support them through 
this unprecedented time. We have all 
heard stories from our districts of 
small businesses seeking assistance, 
many of which have been eligible but 
just can’t get the funds. 
Like my colleagues, the Coney Island 
that I have gone to for 35 years is look-
ing at closing. The waitress who 
worked there for 35 years was in total 
tears last week because she doesn’t 
know what she is going to do. There 
are other restaurants throughout my 
district just needing help. 
This 
legislation 
provides 
critical 
funding that we need to grant to these 
restaurants in our communities. I 
strongly urge my colleagues to support 
this important bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, and still I rise. And still I rise to be 
grateful 
to 
the 
Honorable 
NYDIA 
VELA´ ZQUEZ and EARL BLUMENAUER for 
what they have done to bring this bill 
to the floor. 
And still I rise for this job protec-
tions bill. This bill will not only pro-
tect jobs for restaurants; it also pro-
tects jobs in the $1 trillion supply 
chain. It will protect jobs for those dis-
tributors to restaurants. It will protect 
the jobs for those who transport to the 
distributors. It protects jobs for the 
farmers who produce the produce that 
we have in the restaurants. 
There is a right time for all things. 
This is the right time. This is the right 
place. We are the right people to do the 
right thing and protect small busi-
nesses and, more importantly, protect 
the jobs that fuel America, the engines 
of opportunity. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, I am glad to be able to speak 
on behalf of H.R. 3807, which will de-
liver more funding to restaurants and 
small businesses, which really deserve 
their Representatives to speak up, 
stand up, and work for them because 
they desperately need our help. We 
must deliver on their behalf. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Speaker 
PELOSI, Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ, and 
Congressman BLUMENAUER
for their 
tremendous leadership in working so 
diligently in bringing this bill to the 
floor. 
H.R. 3807 continues Democrats’ effort 
to help our small businesses and res-
taurants recover from the economic 
costs of COVID–19. These small busi-
nesses are the economic and cultural 
lifeblood of our communities, so we es-
tablished the Restaurant Revitaliza-
tion Fund, and other support programs, 
in the American Rescue Plan. 
The ARP delivered billions of dollars 
to help people in businesses make it 
through this crisis. Almost 600 res-
taurants and bars in my district alone 
received more than $212 million to keep 
their doors open and to support their 
employees and families. 
b 1015 
However, we know that this crisis is 
still not over, and we must deliver 
more assistance. We must pass this bill 
today, and I strongly urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘aye.’’ 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Mrs. TRAHAN). 
Mrs. 
TRAHAN. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
every Member of this Chamber has had 
the privilege of meeting with hard-
working small business owners in their 
districts who overcame incredible chal-
lenges to stay open during the pan-
demic. 
The stories that stick with me the 
most are the ones from family-owned 
establishments—community 
staples 
like Simply Khmer in Lowell and Terra 
Luna in Lawrence. These businesses 
accessed relief through the Restaurant 
Revitalization Fund, and it helped 
them keep their doors open and their 
employees on staff. 
But for every Simply Khmer and 
Terra Luna, there are three or four 
other restaurants who applied but 
didn’t get the relief they needed be-
cause the fund ran out of money. And 
that has left many businesses hanging 
on by a thread pleading for help. Pass-
ing the Relief for Restaurants and 
other Hard Hit Small Businesses Act 
will answer those calls for aid. 
Madam Speaker, we owe these res-
taurants and small businesses this leg-
islation. There is simply no reason 
anyone in Congress should oppose it. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to join us in passing this bill. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. THOMPSON). 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
California. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the COVID–19 pan-
demic has hammered every section of 
our economy. Small businesses have 
been hit the hardest; and among small 
businesses, 
restaurants 
have 
been 
crushed. 
An 
estimated 
90,000 
res-
taurants have permanently closed. 
These are cornerstones of our com-
munities and the linchpin of our econ-
omy. If more restaurants close, then 
more workers will be out of work, and 
transitioning to a new job will be a 
challenge for many of those workers. 
Now is not the time to abandon small 
businesses.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4411 
April 7, 2022 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. LAWRENCE). 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in strong support of H.R. 
3807. 
Last month I held a roundtable in my 
district of small businesses, and their 
message was loud and clear: the res-
taurant industry is in a crisis. Small 
businesses need us to understand and 
send relief. 
We know that this pandemic has dis-
proportionately affected small busi-
nesses owned by women and people of 
color. Our small businesses are the 
backbone of our communities and local 
economy. If we are going to come back 
as a country, we must pass this much- 
needed legislation. Now is the time to 
take action. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I continue to reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
have no further requests for time, and 
I would inquire through the Chair if 
my colleague has any remaining speak-
ers on his side. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I am prepared to close. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. I reserve the balance 
of my time, Madam Speaker. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Madam Speak-
er, I yield myself the balance of my 
time. 
Madam Speaker, we discussed this 
bill thoroughly this morning, and I 
think everybody understands that we 
have a $42 billion section of it that is 
wanting to help restaurants. I thor-
oughly support trying to get res-
taurants back on their feet. 
In fact, it has been mentioned a num-
ber of times, we have an alternative 
bill called the ENTREE Act that actu-
ally fixed the constitutional problem 
that existed because the bill as origi-
nally structured, the Restaurant Revi-
talization Fund, was incorrectly struc-
tured. It prioritized groups over some-
thing else and was quite unconstitu-
tional. 
It was underfunded. I told everybody 
at the time that the bill came through 
committee that was the case. I offered 
an amendment to try to fix it, and it 
was defeated. Today, here we are try-
ing to fix a bill that I said wasn’t 
structured right, it was underfunded, 
and we tried to fix it. 
I have a bill to do that. It is paid for. 
This bill suddenly has no chance be-
cause it has never even been in com-
mittee yet. We can’t get a hearing on 
it. 
Why? Who knows? 
We have known for a long time we 
had this problem. Suddenly, last Fri-
day this particular bill shows up, and 
now, all of a sudden, we recognize we 
have a problem. We have said this for a 
long, long time, 6 months or more al-
ready. 
Number two, we have a second part 
of this which hasn’t been discussed 
very much this morning, which are the 
hardest-hit industries. We have $13 bil-
lion there. I can guarantee you, Madam 
Speaker, this isn’t going to come close 
to fixing that problem. If you open this 
up to every single business that has 
been hard hit, we are going to wind up 
being back here—which is fine—but I 
am just telling you right now this is 
not going to fix it. 
I think one of the comments made 
earlier was that this bill is about eco-
nomic resilience. I think our businesses 
are resilient. That is why our economy 
has continued to bounce back. But it is 
not going to be resilient if we strangle 
it with higher inflation, pouring more 
money into this, higher energy prices, 
and more regulation. 
This is about freeing up the entrepre-
neurial spirit of our people and our 
small businesses that drive this coun-
try, taking those burdens off, lowering 
inflation, quit spending money we 
don’t have, and give them the support 
they need instead of choking them off 
with all these other sorts of things. 
We have a bill before us that can fix 
this if we allow it to come up. But we 
are not doing it this morning. Instead, 
we have a bill that is poorly structured 
again. I guarantee you, Madam Speak-
er, it is not funded correctly either. We 
are trying to find a way to claw back 
money which we don’t even know for 
sure if we can. We have got some so far, 
but we don’t have enough. 
So where is the rest of it going to 
come from? 
It is going to be printed. That is not 
how we should operate as a Congress. 
That is not what the American people 
expect of us. They deserve better than 
this. 
Madam Speaker, let me just close by 
saying that enough is enough. 
Whenever we don’t let alternatives be 
heard, to be able to hear the voice of 
the minority and to be able to be 
heard, then we don’t have a bipartisan 
atmosphere that this body should be 
operating under. 
When you have one-party rule and 
you throw bills on the floor without 
going through proper order, this is 
what you get—another bill that is 
poorly structured, that is not going to 
have a chance in the Senate because 
nobody has worked together to find a 
way to solve a problem which we all 
recognize exists. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
By the way, to my friend across the 
aisle, I concur. I am eager for a return 
to regular order, and I hope we work 
towards that. 
I 
want 
to 
thank 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, the extraordinary staff of 
the Small Business Committee, my 
staff, and so many in the Capitol com-
plex who have brought us to this day; 
Representatives 
BLUMENAUER
and 
QUIGLEY; 
my 
good 
friend, 
BRIAN 
FITZPATRICK, from across the aisle, and 
so many others. In fact, 300 Democrats 
and Republicans are on bills right now 
to replenish the RRF, and I want to 
thank them all for getting us here 
today. 
I am a small business owner myself. 
I have been listening to this debate 
with open ears and open eyes, a long 
business career, now I own a couple 
coffee shops. I used to have three, but 
we had to close one during the pan-
demic. 
I know how hard it is, how hard it 
has been, and how hard it will be. But 
we didn’t take PPP. We didn’t take an 
IDA loan. We didn’t take any of the 
government support programs. That is 
why I am here to advocate for the 
177,000—177,000—small restaurants and 
cafes and millions of owners, operators, 
and employees all around the country 
in my district and yours who were ap-
proved for RRF funds and have been 
waiting for almost a full year for us to 
make good on a very simple promise. 
I want to thank the thousands of 
other small entrepreneurs and enter-
prises in the fitness, live events, hospi-
tality, and other hard-hit sectors who 
have been waiting so patiently—but 
desperately—for support. 
A singular principle has guided me in 
this 8-month journey to get to today to 
see this bill become law, and it is the 
universal and core American principle 
of fairness. 
We promised American entrepreneurs 
during the worst of COVID that we 
would be there for them. We promised 
that those who required financial sup-
port to survive that we would dis-
tribute it on a level playing field. We 
promised that there would be no pro-
gram just for the wealthy or the well- 
connected, and we promised them that 
their government, the United States of 
America, would not pick winners and 
losers. It is a theme I hear constantly 
from my friends across the aisle, and I 
agree with it. 
But lo and behold, what did we do? 
We did just that. We picked winners 
and losers by woefully underfunding 
the RRF and all but ignoring other 
small businesses dependent on public 
gathering that were ravaged by the 
pandemic. Most of the 100,000 res-
taurants and cafes that received sup-
port weathered the storm because of 
that support. They kept their lights on 
and their people paid, and they are now 
returning to viability. I think we can 
all agree on that. But 177,000 res-
taurants and cafes, often next door to 
or across the street from those who re-
ceived RRF support, got nothing. One 
restaurant on one side of the street got 
full support, and the other one applied, 
was approved, and got nothing. This is 
patently and grossly unfair. 
Actually, let me correct myself. I 
shouldn’t say they got nothing. 
Do you know what they got? 
They got nonforgivable bank loans. 
They took on credit card debt. They 
mortgaged their homes. Many lost

hope and closed their doors. And, yes, a 
number took their own lives. They lost 
hope and took their own lives. I have 
sat around tables with tears hearing 
those stories about how their debts 
mounted and their dreams slipped 
away. 
So to my friends across the aisle who 
plan to vote against this measure, par-
ticularly those whose own businesses 
were recipients of COVID aid that was 
passed in this Chamber, I ask a very 
simple question: How would you feel if 
you and your business were among the 
177,000 that got nothing? 
How would you feel? 
And was it not wasteful spending or 
inflationary spending when you took 
the money? 
My goodness. Today, we have got one 
last opportunity. I do believe it is the 
last opportunity to make good on a 
very simple promise that we made at 
the outset of this pandemic. Best of all, 
we are going to convert the moneys re-
covered from the prosecution of fraud 
into fairness. That is right, from fraud 
to fairness. The money that was fraud-
ulently obtained is rightfully supposed 
to go to those whom we hope to benefit 
if we pass this bill today. 
Now, we may not always agree on 
policy. But, my goodness, I would like 
to think that Democrats and Repub-
licans in the United States Congress 
can agree on the basic principle of fair-
ness. 
That is why I will not urge; rather, I 
will ask, that my colleagues vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on H.R. 3807, to vote ‘‘yes’’ for Amer-
ican small businesses, and to vote 
‘‘yes’’ for fairness. 
I yield back the balance of my time, 
Madam Speaker. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, in my home-
town of San Francisco, and in so many places 
across the country, small businesses are the 
heart of our communities. 
They are the engines of our economy: cre-
ating good-paying jobs, delivering crucial 
goods and services, and helping power our 
historic economic recovery from the pandemic. 
But tragically, when the virus struck two 
years ago, our small businesses—and espe-
cially our restaurants—were among the hard-
est hit. 
Many were forced to scale back hours. Oth-
ers had to lay off workers. And some even 
closed their doors for good. 
That is why Democrats fought for and won 
billions in economic relief for our small busi-
nesses in COVID relief bills. In our historic 
American Rescue Plan, we established the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund: a vital lifeline 
helping more than 100,000 restaurants reopen 
and rehire. 
And today, the Democratic Congress will 
take another strong step to help our small 
businesses not only survive—but thrive. 
With our Relief for Restaurants and Other 
Hard Hit Small Businesses Act, we deliver ur-
gently needed relief to tens of thousands of 
businesses struggling in the wake of the latest 
COVID wave. 
We salute Chairwoman NYDIA VELA´ZQUEZ of 
the House Small Business Committee for her 
leadership and legislative mastery for the ben-
efit of small businesses. 
And let us thank Congressmen EARL BLU-
MENAUER and DEAN PHILLIPS for their tireless, 
committed leadership on behalf of our nations’ 
restaurants and small businesses. 
While small businesses have been on the 
path to recovery from the COVID crisis, the 
omicron 
variant 
sadly 
interrupted 
this 
progress. Now, many hard-hit businesses are 
in need of additional support. 
Our bill delivers $42 billion to replenish the 
Restaurant Revitalization Fund: offering a bea-
con of hope for the more than 170,000 eligible 
restaurants that applied for RRF funding last 
year but could not access this relief due to 
oversubscription. 
We will also secure $13 billion to support 
many of our nation’s smallest businesses who 
saw major revenue losses due to the pan-
demic. 
And we will continue to support the live en-
tertainment venues that bring rich vibrancy, 
culture and diversity to our communities: en-
suring they have more flexibility to best make 
use of their relief funding. 
Delivering desperately needed relief for 
America’s small businesses—the heart and 
soul of our nation—is an urgent economic im-
perative. 
In doing so, we: 
protect good-paying American jobs; 
secure the livelihoods of hard-working small 
business owners; and 
ensure families get goods they need, with-
out added costs of delays. 
I urge a strong, bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ vote for this 
relief package—so that our small businesses 
can continue to flourish and to serve our com-
munities for generations to come. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of H.R. 3807, the ‘‘Relief for 
Restaurants and Other Hard Hit Small Busi-
nesses Act of 2022,’’ which provides $70.6 bil-
lion in FY2022 for the Restaurant Revitaliza-
tion Fund. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased that this 
Congress is reconsidering this critical piece of 
legislation for America’s restaurant owners. 
The American Rescue Plan made great 
progress in providing the funding in an equi-
table manner, prioritizing women, veteran, and 
economically and socially disadvantaged res-
taurant owners. In addition, the majority of 
funds were reserved for restaurants whose 
gross receipts were no more than $1,500,000 
dollars. 
It is essential to promote equity through the 
Restaurant 
Revitalization 
Fund, 
Madam 
Speaker, considering that only 8 percent of 
restaurants are owned by blacks and 23.8 per-
cent Asian owned businesses are restaurants. 
As legislators we must do everything we can 
to ensure their survival. 
Unfortunately, the funds appropriated from 
last year’s lifeline did not reach enough of 
those 
businesses 
the 
Administration 
prioritized. Due to the efforts of Republican 
motivated court challenges, the prioritization 
program was ended just three weeks after it 
was enacted. 
Records reviewed by The New York Times 
show that hundreds of the 24,000 grants 
made after the rule change went to applicants 
who were supposed to have been bumped to 
the end of the line. During that same period, 
the agency canceled at least 3,000 already- 
approved awards. 
Additionally, more than 1,000 successful ap-
plicants filed their claims on or after May 19, 
the day after the agency said the fund had ef-
fectively run dry. 
Countless black owned, veteran owned, and 
women owned restaurants were shuttered be-
cause of this heartless rule change, so it is es-
sential we approve this new appropriation. 
To further underscore the personal impor-
tance this funding holds to me, I would like to 
mention a widely loved black owned, and his-
toric Third Ward restaurant: Cream Burger. 
Cream Burger sits on the corner of Elgin 
and Scott and has been in operation for 60 
years. It is a cash only restaurant that has 
only had two additions to the menu across the 
entirety of its existence: chili cheese fries and 
bacon. 
The Greenwood family has been serving the 
residents of the Third Ward their delicious 
burgers and homemade ice cream for dec-
ades and has no plans of closing any time 
soon. 
The original owners of the restaurant, Verna 
and Willie Greenwood, opened the restaurant 
to generate their own income and create 
generational wealth, which they certainly have 
done. Ever since their tragic passing, the busi-
ness is now owned and operated by their 
daughters, Beverly and Sandra. 
Beverly and Sandra hope to pass the busi-
ness onto the next generation of children so 
they can, ‘‘see it through. Maybe 100 years,’’ 
Beverly said. 
The restaurant sees a range of Third Ward 
customers every day, from the students at the 
University of Houston to the cashiers working 
at the historic Houston Food Mart just down 
the street. 
Cream Burger is iconic in the city of Hous-
ton, and I hold it in the highest reverence. It, 
and so many restaurants like it, is one of 
those restaurants that would receive funds 
from this legislation. 
It is for that reason Madam Speaker, I 
strongly support H.R. 3807, the ‘‘Relief for 
Restaurants and other Hard Hit Small Busi-
nesses Act of 2022.’’ It will help save so many 
businesses like the beloved Cream Burger, so 
I urge my colleagues to support this critical 
piece of legislation as well. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 1033, 
the previous question is ordered on the 
bill, as amended. 
The question is on the engrossment 
and third reading of the bill. 
The bill was ordered to be engrossed 
and read a third time, and was read the 
third time.

LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the Senate 
has passed, and we have just had read, 
the passage of H.R. 7108, which is the 
Suspending Normal Trading Relations 
with Russia and Belarus Act. That 
passed 100 to zero in the United States 
Senate. 
We expect at the end of this series of 
votes for that bill to be on the floor on 
suspension. So there will be no break. 
We will continue to that. 
Thereafter, we expect the Suspending 
Energy Imports From Russia Act, 
which we voted on overwhelmingly, to 
be sent to us. That is currently 79 to 
zero in the United States Senate. 
We are going to pass both of those 
bills in this House as soon as we get 
them, and it is my expectation that 
will complete the business for this 
week. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
TONKO). The question is on the passage 
of the bill. 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, 
on that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
This is a 5-minute vote. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 223, nays 
203, not voting 4, as follows:

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair

SUSPENDING NORMAL TRADE RE-
LATIONS 
WITH 
RUSSIA 
AND 
BELARUS ACT 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and concur in the 
Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 
7108) to suspend normal trade relations 
treatment for the Russian Federation 
and the Republic of Belarus, and for 
other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the Senate amendment is 
as follows: 
Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Suspending 
Normal Trade Relations with Russia and 
Belarus Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The United States is a founding member of 
the World Trade Organization (WTO) and is 
committed to ensuring that the WTO remains an 
effective forum for peaceful economic engage-
ment. 
(2) Ukraine is a sovereign nation-state that is 
entitled to enter into agreements with other sov-
ereign states and to full respect of its territorial 
integrity. 
(3) The United States will be unwavering in 
its support for a secure, democratic, and sov-
ereign Ukraine, free to choose its own leaders 
and future. 
(4) Ukraine acceded to the Marrakesh Agree-
ment Establishing the World Trade Organiza-
tion (WTO Agreement) and has been a WTO 
member since 2008. 
(5) Ukraine’s participation in the WTO Agree-
ment creates both rights and obligations vis-a`- 
vis other WTO members. 
(6) The Russian Federation acceded to the 
WTO on August 22, 2012, becoming the 156th 
WTO member, and the Republic of Belarus has 
applied to accede to the WTO. 
(7) From the date of its accession, the Russian 
Federation committed to apply fully all provi-
sions of the WTO. 
(8) The United States Congress authorized 
permanent normal trade relations for the Rus-
sian 
Federation 
through 
the 
Russia 
and 
Moldova Jackson-Vanik Repeal and Sergei 
Magnitsky Rule of Law Accountability Act of 
2012 (Public Law 112–208). 
(9) Ukraine communicated to the WTO Gen-
eral Council on March 2, 2022, urging that all 
WTO members take action against the Russian 
Federation and ‘‘consider further steps with the 
view to suspending the Russian Federation’s 
participation in the WTO for its violation of the 
purpose and principles of this Organization’’. 
(10) Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dictator, has 
led the Russian Federation into a war of aggres-
sion against Ukraine, which— 
(A) denies Ukraine and its people their collec-
tive rights to independence, sovereignty, and 
territorial integrity; 
(B) constitutes an emergency in international 
relations, because it is a situation of armed con-
flict that threatens the peace and security of all 
countries, including the United States; and 
(C) denies Ukraine its rightful ability to par-
ticipate in international organizations, includ-
ing the WTO. 
(11) The Republic of Belarus, also led by a 
ruthless dictator, Aleksander Lukashenka, is 
providing important material support to the 
Russian Federation’s aggression. 
(12) The Russian Federation’s exportation of 
goods in the energy sector is central to its ability 
to wage its war of aggression on Ukraine. 
(13) The United States, along with its allies 
and partners, has responded to recent aggres-
sion by the Russian Federation in Ukraine by 
imposing sweeping financial sanctions and 
stringent export controls. 
(14) The United States cannot allow the con-
sequences of the Russian Federation’s actions to 
go unaddressed, and must lead fellow countries, 
in all fora, including the WTO, to impose appro-
priate consequences for the Russian Federa-
tion’s aggression. 
SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF NORMAL TRADE RELA-
TIONS WITH THE RUSSIAN FEDERA-
TION 
AND 
THE

in those sections, and supersede other rules only 
to the extent that they are inconsistent with 
such rules; and 
(B) with full recognition of the constitutional

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4417 
April 7, 2022 
us after the House initially advanced 
the legislation a month ago. We are 
now considering this important legisla-
tion to suspend normal trade relations 
with Russia. 
The facts, the atrocities, and the 
emotions are all packaged in the Amer-
ican and Congressional response in the 
coming moments. We will shortly con-
sider this amendment to H.R. 6968 
which will suspend Russian oil imports 
so that both measures may go directly 
to the President’s desk. 
We have no time to waste and must 
immediately further punish Vladimir 
Putin. 
What we have witnessed in Bucha 
over the course of the last 72 hours 
alone more than justifies the positions 
we have taken in the past and to be 
even more assertive and aggressive 
going to the future. Innocent people 
are being slaughtered on the streets of 
Ukraine even as we meet, and the de-
nial that has taken place from the Rus-
sian President is outrageous. 
These atrocities that are taking 
place in Ukraine are unthinkable. The 
disinformation and the misinformation 
that has been generated from Russia 
defies modern logic. But in this modern 
era, the world can see the devastation 
in near real time. 
President Zelenskyy is an inspiration 
to the world. People have been bombed 
out of residential neighborhoods, and 
refugees have been streaming across 
the borders to safety. There has oc-
curred indiscriminate killings of civil-
ians and of innocent children. Congress 
must do whatever we can to end this 
brutality and support the Ukrainian 
people. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. 
BRADY for his partnership in advancing 
this legislation to suspend normal 
trade relations with Russia and its en-
abler, Belarus. 
The legislation to ban the import of 
Russian energy makes enormous sense 
today. These actions will further iso-
late Putin and inflict greater pressure 
on the Kremlin to end its campaign of 
terror on Ukraine—and that is exactly 
what it is: a campaign of terror. 
We stand with NATO committed to 
democracy and to peace on the Euro-
pean continent. 
Mr. Speaker, this legislation I know 
will receive broad support from our 
colleagues, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, the Senate has finally 
taken action, and now we move for-
ward on our bill to answer President 
Zelenskyy’s passionate plea to the 
United States and all free nations to 
stand with the brave people of Ukraine 
against Putin’s deadly ambitions and 
heartbreaking genocide. 
Putin’s onslaught has been relent-
less. Beautiful town squares have been 
leveled, children have been killed, and 
families have been abused. The bill we 
sent to the President today will stop 
American dollars from funding Russia’s 
bloodletting. 
Today, Mr. Speaker, we are leading, 
and I thank Chairman NEAL for his 
great leadership and his work on this 
bipartisan provision to suspend Rus-
sia’s special trade status. 
I was proud to have helped lead this 
bipartisan effort of the House Ways and 
Means and Senate Finance Commit-
tees. Both parties in Congress came to-
gether and worked in good faith on a 
bipartisan, bicameral agreement to im-
mediately ban purchases of Russian en-
ergy and suspend our trading relation-
ship with Russia and Belarus. 
We don’t take these steps lightly, but 
Russia’s aggression requires this ap-
proach. Russia will no longer enjoy the 
same special trade status with America 
as the country it is invading so that it 
will no longer be able to sell made-in- 
Russia products into the United States 
at lower tariffs. 
Combined with the energy import 
ban which targets 60 percent of what 
Russia sells us, this provision targets 
the remaining 40 percent, hurting Rus-
sia’s economy and cutting off funding 
for its war effort. Said another way, 
American dollars will no longer fund 
Russia’s war machine. This is another 
step in the right direction and includes 
further incentives for Russia to end its 
aggression. 
This bill, by the way, includes tough 
but clear conditions to be met for re-
storing Russia’s trade status—the same 
conditions as we are requiring to re-
verse the import ban on Russian en-
ergy products. 
Going forward, we must continue to 
work closely with our allies to increase 
pressure on Russia and ensure this is 
an effective, global effort. 
Neighboring Canada has also taken 
serious action to do both of these, and 
other nations have announced their in-
tentions to do the same. 
Finally, I am glad this bill no longer 
includes controversial changes to the 
Global Magnitsky Act sanctions au-
thority. Instead, this bill merely in-
cludes a straight extension of the cur-
rent Global Magnitsky authority. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thankful that the 
Senate shared our concerns and re-
moved that provision, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
both of the gentlemen for their bipar-
tisan effort on this bill. 
Six weeks ago today Putin began his 
bloody aggression in Ukraine. The next 
morning Representative BLUMENAUER 
and I introduced legislation to revoke 
normal trade relations with Russia and 
expel it from the World Trade Organi-
zation. 
On March 9, this House overwhelm-
ingly approved action on the World 
Trade Organization but deferred the 
PNTR provision and added the impor-
tant Magnitsky provisions—which the 
Senate has weakened today in this leg-
islation—and a ban on Russian energy. 
Thereafter, on March 17, the House ap-
proved 
overwhelmingly 
again 
the 
PNTR provisions. 
It has taken 6 long weeks to approve 
this first economic sanctions legisla-
tion, but today it is finally done. We 
know that it will not immediately end 
the funding of the Putin war machine, 
but it is a step in the right direction. 
Let us hope that the administration 
will move forward more expeditiously 
on getting Ukrainians every weapon 
they need to defend themselves and 
that it will move faster than this bill 
did. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Ne-
braska (Mr. SMITH), who is the Repub-
lican 
leader 
of 
the 
Trade 
Sub-
committee. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today in support of H.R. 6968. 
I think it has been well-laid out here 
that we could have done this some 
weeks ago on March 9 when the bill 
originally passed. It is regrettable that 
Speaker PELOSI chose to try to add 
some controversial provisions that ac-
tually slowed it down. 
It is high time that we come together 
in an action like this. 
Mr. Speaker, I am glad to say that as 
the lead Republican on the Ways and 
Means Trade Subcommittee, I support 
this, and I urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
This bill has overwhelming support. 
It is time to act now. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, the gentle-
man’s position was well-stated. I think 
this legislation is powerful in terms of 
the message it sends to the world. It 
reinforces what we have done here over 
the course of the last 6 weeks. 
The House has been consistent on all 
of these measures from day one. I 
would ask that there be a very strong 
and assertive vote today to send a mes-
sage to a dictator in Russia who is kill-
ing innocent women and children in 
the streets of Ukraine, and at the mo-
ment he appears to be still unre-
strained. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) that the House suspend the 
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the bill, H.R. 7108. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings are postponed.

spectively, and as such is deemed a part of the 
rules of each House, respectively, but applicable 
only with respect to the procedure to be followed 
in that House in the case of a joint resolution of 
disapproval, and supersedes other rules only to 
the extent that it is inconsistent with such rules; 
and 
(B) with full recognition of the constitutional 
right of either House to change the rules (so far 
as relating to the procedure of that House) at 
any time, in the same manner, and to the same 
extent as in the case of any other rule of that 
House.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4419 
April 7, 2022 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
Massachusetts (Mr. NEAL) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BRADY) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Massachusetts. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unani-
mous consent that all Members may 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the bill 
under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I think that what we 
are doing here is to certainly reassert 
ourselves on what the Senate has done, 
which the House did originally. I 
strongly support the House taking 
swift action to concur in the Senate 
amendment before us so that the legis-
lation to suspend energy imports from 
Russia that we passed a month ago now 
can move to the President’s desk. 
We have no time to waste, as Mr. 
BRADY and I have both indicated. We 
must immediately move to further 
punish Vladimir Putin, a ruthless dic-
tator hell-bent on destroying an inde-
pendent nation that he purports to sug-
gest doesn’t really exist. That will 
come as a vast surprise to the civilized 
nations of the world. 
Congress must do what we can to end 
this brutality and continue to support 
the Ukrainian people. 
I thank KEVIN BRADY for his partner-
ship in advancing this legislation to 
ban the import of Russian energy, as 
well as our intent here to suspend nor-
mal trade relations with Russia and its 
enabler, Belarus. 
These actions will further isolate 
Putin and his regime, and inflict great-
er pressure on the Kremlin, to end this 
campaign of terror. 
I know this legislation will receive 
broad support from our colleagues. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I join with Chairman 
NEAL in urging the House to take the 
final legislative step to ending the flow 
of American dollars toward Russian oil 
that acts as a treasury for Russia’s war 
machine. 
Soon, President Biden will have on 
his desk a bill that demonstrates we 
stand with the people of Ukraine. 
As Chairman NEAL pointed out, the 
Ukrainian people have been waiting. 
The action we take today is long over-
due but just as necessary. 
Since we first debated this bill, the 
horrors of Putin’s war in Ukraine have 
been on display for the world to see. 
Today, we will make sure American 
dollars will no longer fund Russia’s war 
machine by blocking all Russian en-
ergy imports. 
The bill also strengthens the sanc-
tions by ensuring that before the ban 
can be lifted, Russia must meet three 
clear criteria: withdraws its forces 
from Ukraine; poses no immediate 
military threat of aggression to NATO; 
and recognizes the right of the people 
of Ukraine to independently and freely 
choose their own government. 
This is an important, bipartisan vic-
tory. There is still more we can do and 
should do. 
We should turn toward unleashing 
America’s own ability to be energy 
independent, replace Russian oil with 
American sources, and use our energy 
strengths to wean the world from Rus-
sian energy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. SMITH), 
the Republican leader of the Sub-
committee on Trade. 
Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speak-
er, I appreciate this opportunity that 
we can work together. I appreciate the 
comments of the chairman and our 
ranking member. 
It is only appropriate that we move 
to use the key trade tools at our dis-
posal to hold Vladimir Putin account-
able for these atrocities that he has 
committed against Ukraine because we 
know it is being felt around the world, 
in addition to what the people of 
Ukraine are feeling. 
I am glad that we can act in this 
manner. I wish we would have done it 
sooner, but I am glad we can act today. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, I strongly 
support this great bipartisan work 
from the House. I thank Chairman 
NEAL and the Ways and Means Demo-
crats for working together with us and 
the Senate Finance Committee. I urge 
strong passage in the House. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I acknowl-
edge Mr. BRADY and the Republican 
Members of the House who have stood 
with Democrats in an unyielding posi-
tion of support for the Ukrainian peo-
ple. On this occasion, we send another 
message that civilized people of the 
world are all Ukrainians at this mo-
ment. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Massachusetts 
(Mr. NEAL) that the House suspend the 
rules and concur in the Senate amend-
ment to the bill, H.R. 6968. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. BRADY. Mr. Speaker, on that I 
demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pro-
ceedings will resume on questions pre-
viously postponed. Votes will be taken 
in the following order: 
Motions to suspend the rules with re-
spect to the following: 
Concurring in the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 7108; and 
Concurring in the Senate amendment 
to H.R. 6968. 
The first electronic vote will be con-
ducted as a 15-minute vote. Pursuant 
to clause 9 of rule XX, remaining elec-
tronic votes will be conducted as 
5-minute votes.

REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER 
AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 1297 
Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I 
ask to have my name removed as a co-
sponsor of H.R. 1297, the Air America 
Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman’s request is accepted.

b 1315 
THE FUTURE OF AMERICAN 
DIPLOMACY 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
this is an important week for the fu-
ture of American diplomacy, especially 
as it relates to cybersecurity. An open, 
interoperable, 
reliable, 
and 
secure 
internet is foundational to U.S. foreign 
policy and national security in the 21st 
century, but this vision for the global 
digital ecosystem faces greater chal-
lenges than ever before. 
Cybersecurity absolutely must be-
come a core foreign policy priority of 
the United States and, this week, we 
have taken a major step forward in 
that regard. 
On Monday, the Department of State 
formally launched the Bureau of Cyber-
space and Digital Policy. On the inter-
national stage, this bureau will lead 
U.S. efforts to uphold standards of re-
sponsible state behavior in cyberspace, 
shape digital standards that govern 
new technologies, and protect digital 
freedoms around the world. I congratu-
late Secretary Blinken and Deputy 
Secretary Sherman on this significant 
accomplishment. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to ensure that this new bu-
reau receives the funding it needs to 
accomplish its critical mission. And 
beyond that, I also look forward to en-
shrining this new bureau in statute 
through the Cyber Diplomacy Act, a bi-
partisan bill, which will ensure its 
long-term viability and the preserva-
tion of cybersecurity as a key foreign 
policy priority for the coming decades. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND 
SERVICE OF BILL RAMSAUR 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to remember the 
life and service of a true patriot, Bill 
Ramsaur. 
A native of Atlanta, Bill attended 
Baylor University in 1959 and grad-
uated with majors in history and reli-
gion. 
Upon graduation, Bill proceeded to 
Naval Officer Candidate School and 
was assigned to an aircraft carrier, the 
USS Shangri-la. Bill served as the 
Radio Officer in the communications 
department during his time aboard the 
ship. His ship was home-ported in 
Mayport, Florida, where Bill met his 
future wife, Gloria, a native of Bruns-
wick, Georgia. 
He obtained his master’s degree in 
1966 from Georgia State University and 
joined Arthur Andersen & Co., where he 
became a certified public accountant. 
Bill worked as an accountant with Ar-
thur Andersen & Co. for 30 years before 
he and Gloria relocated to St. Simons 
Island. 
Bill loved this great United States 
with a fiery passion, and was a member 
of the Sons of the American Revolu-
tion, Marshes of Glynn Chapter. He 
also performed as George Washington 
for thousands of local students and par-
ticipated in the Veterans Council of 
the Golden Isles. 
His love for his family, friends, and 
this country will forever be remem-
bered. 
f 
REMEMBERING THE VICTIMS AND 
FAMILIES 
IN 
BUCHA 
AND 
ACROSS UKRAINE 
(Mr. COSTA asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, we 
have all seen the horrific images com-
ing out of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha 
and the surrounding areas, where hun-
dreds of civilians have been killed, left 
lying in the street by Russian forces. 
Bucha 
residents 
have 
recounted 
watching their family members being 
raped or shot right in front of them by 
the Russian forces, but we know this 
horrific brutality is occurring through-
out Ukraine in every region where the 
Russian Army is positioned. 
It is difficult to find words to express 
the unacceptable brutality that the 
photos and videos from Bucha have laid 
evidence of. Russian President Vladi-
mir Putin has cemented himself in his-
tory as an evil war criminal. 
I would like to use the remainder of 
my time for a brief moment of silence

families in Bucha and across Ukraine,

century, this is the test of our time, 
and the world is watching. 
f 
RUSSIA SANCTIONS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to support Congress’ bipartisan 
approval of harsher sanctions on Vladi-
mir Putin and his vicious Russian 
enablers. We all support suspending 
normal trade relations and support de-
stabilizing the Russian economy as the 
price of their savageness. 
The nations of the free world and all 
freedom-loving people have an obliga-
tion to stand up resolutely against the 
tyranny and murder being unleashed 
against Ukraine. 
Let liberty lovers continue arming 
Ukraine’s brave defenders. Let free na-
tions send them the lethal and defen-
sive equipment they need. And let civil 
nations continue to isolate this rogue 
and criminal state from all that it 
needs to function. 
The 
murder 
of 
innocent, 
men, 
women, and children simply cannot be 
tolerated. 
f 
WHAT DEMOCRATS AND REPUB-
LICANS 
IN 
CONGRESS 
ARE 
DOING 
(Mr. LIEU asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. LIEU. Madam Speaker, today, we 
found out that weekly jobless claims 
are the lowest since 1968 and, in fact, if 
you look at this month, their unem-
ployment claims are the lowest in re-
corded history. 
President Joe Biden and Congres-
sional Democrats have done an amaz-
ing job on job creation. For the last 14 
months, 7.4 million jobs were created, 
the most in U.S. history; jobs are up, 
wages are up, growth is up, and unem-
ployment is down. 
What are Republicans doing? I don’t 
know. But last month, two Republicans 
spoke at a white nationalist con-
ference. And today, we learned that Re-
publican Congressman PAUL GOSAR is 
going to attend a white nationalist 
bash to celebrate Hitler’s birthday, and 
he is listed as a guest speaker on April 
20 at this bash. 
f 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S FAILURE TO 
ASSIST UKRAINE IN A TIMELY 
MANNER 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, it 
has been 41 days since Putin’s invasion 
of Ukraine in February. That means 
2,685 civilian casualties, and more than 
4 million fleeing Ukrainian refugees 
scrambling to the aid of the EU. 
Twenty-five 
days 
after 
watching 
bloodshed, riots, and tears, the Biden 
administration finally came to their 
senses and released a statement to aid 
$1 billion in funding humanitarian as-
sistance for the Ukrainian people, al-
lowing the U.S. to accept 100,000 fleeing 
refugees; 25 days of watching; 25 days 
of letting other countries handle it; 25 
days of fear. This is 1,081 Ukrainian 
citizens no longer breathing, lost in 
those 25 days. 
Silence speaks louder than action. 
The Biden administration is respon-
sible for this delayed deterrence. 
After striking down a deal with Po-
land to aid the relocation of MiG–29 
planes for Ukrainian use, the President 
also hesitated to provide military as-
sistance to President Zelenskyy of 
Ukraine. 
Two weeks of waiting into the inva-
sion, President Biden delayed sanctions 
on Russian oil after much pressure 
from the House. Therefore, it ruined 
any chances of deterrence against 
Putin’s aggression. 
These actions have been shown on 
the world stage, and the U.S. now ap-
pears weaker than ever as a result of 
this hesitancy. 
We need to bring aid hastily to the 
Ukrainian people; the help they de-
serve. 
f 
AMERICANS DESERVE BETTER 
(Mr. CASTEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. CASTEN. Madam Speaker, I 
want you to imagine a world where the 
Republican Party praised the President 
of the United States for raising the 
price of oil by 24 percent. That sounds 
crazy, right? 
Well, that is exactly what happened 2 
years ago this month when Trump 
threatened to remove U.S. troops from 
Saudi Arabia unless they cut oil pro-
duction. 
Oil prices, of course, are not set by 
the President, but they are a function 
of global supply and demand. And when 
the President pressures another coun-
try to slash supply, the price at the 
pump and oil industry profits surge ac-
cordingly. That is exactly what hap-
pened in April of 2020. 
The GOP praised Trump’s approach. 
What’s more, nearly 50 of my Repub-
lican House colleagues wrote a letter 
directly to the Saudi Crown Prince de-
manding that he cut crude output. 
They wanted higher oil company prof-
its, so they forced a reduction in sup-
ply to make that happen. 
Fast forward to today. Those same 
Republicans who pressured Saudi to 
cut oil supply and increase prices 2 
years ago are now berating President 
Biden for using the Strategic Petro-
leum Reserve to boost supply, and 
blocking every effort to invest in en-
ergy efficiency and renewables that 
would cut our fossil fuel demand. 
Why would a party that fought to 
raise oil prices 2 years ago fight to 
raise them again? Because given a 
choice between your wallet and the fos-
sil fuel industry, they will always take 
from you and subsidize them. 
Americans deserve better. 
f 
WE CANNOT LEAVE WORKERS 
BEHIND 
(Ms. TLAIB asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of the Restaurant Revitaliza-
tion Fund Act which included an 
amendment that I worked on with my 
team and many of the folks that led 
this effort to prohibit the funds from 
going to businesses who have com-
mitted wage theft against their em-
ployees. 
This simple change will make sure 
that our valuable Federal dollars are 
being used to support businesses who 
do right by their workers, not those 
who rip off their workers and steal 
their labor. 
There is no doubt that a thriving res-
taurant industry is good for everyone, 
but it is the workers who really make 
the restaurants and businesses who 
they are today. And workers are the 
reason that so many of them made it 
through this awful and continued pan-
demic. 
We cannot leave those workers be-
hind, as I said, and with this bill and 
my amendment, we are making clear 
that if you cheat or exploit your em-
ployees, the Federal Government will 
not do business with you. 
As I continue to work in Congress to 
end wage theft and expand the powers 
of our workers, I want to thank my 
colleagues, again, Chairwoman NYDIA 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, as well as Congressman 
DEAN PHILLIPS, for their work in im-
proving this bill and moving it forward. 
I urge the Senate to take this bill up as 
soon as possible. 
f 
RELIEF FOR RESTAURANTS AND 
OTHER HARD HIT SMALL BUSI-
NESSES 
(Mrs. 
CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. CHERFILUS-MCCORMICK. Madam 
Speaker, restaurants are a driving 
force in South Florida’s hospitality 
and tourism industry, but when the 
pandemic hit, their sales plummeted. 
The $28.6 billion Restaurant Revital-
ization Fund helped over 100,000 res-
taurants, bars, and other small busi-
nesses in the food and beverage serv-
ices sector keep their doors open and 
their staff employed. 
Unfortunately, this program’s lim-
ited funding failed to support roughly 
two-thirds of the eligible businesses 
that applied. Nearly 200,000 small busi-
nesses have been left behind, and now 
four out of five of these restaurants 
and bars are in danger of closing per-
manently.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair would inform the House that, 
pursuant to House Resolution 1037, the 
Speaker has certified to the United 
States Attorney for the District of Co-
lumbia the refusal of Peter K. Navarro 
and Daniel Scavino, Jr., to produce 
documents to or appear for a deposi-
tion before the Select Committee to In-
vestigate the January 6th Attack on 
the United States Capitol as directed 
by subpoena.

SOUTHERN BORDER ISSUES 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. GROTHMAN) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Tennessee 
(Mr. FLEISCHMANN). 
Mr. FLEISCHMANN. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Wis-
consin for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor the Chattanooga Bar Association 
on reaching the milestone of its 125th 
anniversary. 
Since 1897, the Chattanooga Bar As-
sociation has made it its mission to 
work for the betterment of the legal 
profession and the administration of 
justice; to take an active interest in 
governmental affairs; to stimulate a 
feeling of respect, esteem, and good-fel-
lowship among members of the Chat-
tanooga Bar Association; and to pro-
vide and promote legal education of 
the legal community and the public at 
large. 
During its 125 years, the Chattanooga 
Bar Association has produced many 
outstanding members who have shaped 
the history of Tennessee and our Na-
tion. 
J.B. Frazier was a member of the 
board of directors during the first 5 
years of CBA’s existence and is the 
only Chattanoogan elected Governor of 
the State of Tennessee. He later served 
in the United States Senate. 
Estes Kefauver served as the sec-
retary-treasurer and vice president of 
the association before being elected to 
serve as Tennessee’s Third District 
Congressman. Incidentally, that is the 
seat which I presently hold. 
He then went on to the United States 
Senate and made two bids for the 
Democratic Presidential nomination 
before 
being 
selected 
as 
Adlai 
Stevenson’s Vice Presidential nominee 
during the 1956 Presidential election. 
I am extremely proud, myself, to 
have been a member of the Chat-
tanooga Bar Association since I began 
my law practice as a young man in 
1986. In 1996, I became the youngest 
person to serve as president of the 
Chattanooga Bar Association, the 99th 
president, an honor that is still near 
and dear to my heart.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4424 
April 7, 2022 
Throughout its 125 years, the Chat-
tanooga Bar Association has shown our 
community, State, and the Nation the 
best of what it means to be a lawyer, to 
practice law, and to pursue equal jus-
tice for all. 
I am proud to recognize and honor 
the Chattanooga Bar Association as 
they celebrate their 125th anniversary. 
I congratulate the CBA and wish them 
much continued success in the future. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Wisconsin for 
yielding. We will continue to engage in 
that. 
With the permission of the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin, I ask that he 
also yield to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. GOOD) to engage in a col-
loquy. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Wisconsin controls the 
time. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY) and the gentleman from Virginia 
(Mr. GOOD) for the purpose of a col-
loquy. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I appre-
ciate the time from the gentleman 
from Wisconsin and his commitment to 
fighting to change this town, which, 
unfortunately, too many of our col-
leagues are unwilling to do. I am glad 
to have my friend from Virginia here 
as well. 
Yesterday, we had an interesting ex-
change in the House Judiciary Com-
mittee. We had a number of different 
conversations about the issue of the 
ongoing threat at our border. I know 
that my friend from Virginia was also 
here on the floor of the House last 
night, where we had a continued con-
versation about the ongoing threat at 
the southern border of the United 
States. 
I would imagine that the people who 
I represent, and the people of the State 
of Texas, would be horrified if they all 
got to see what I see every day and the 
exchange with my colleagues here in 
this body about what is actually hap-
pening at our border. What do I mean 
by that? 
Yesterday, I had an exchange with 
the chairman of the House Judiciary 
Committee because I was acknowl-
edging, in the context of a debate we 
were having about opening up visa 
waivers for the United States Virgin Is-
lands, that those kinds of waivers had 
been abused in Guam and other terri-
tories of the United States. We were 
questioning why we are going to open 
up these waivers while our border is 
wide open. 
I pointed out the abuses that are hap-
pening at our border and the abuses 
that are happening in Texas. I specifi-
cally talked about the sexual abuses, 
the rapes, and the tragedy of what is 
occurring to little girls and to people 
on the journey, in particular in Texas 
when they cross the southern border 
because they are at the hands of the 
dangerous cartels. 
I said this at the time, that the com-
mittee chairman kind of scoffed. It 
wasn’t the first time I had seen some of 
our colleagues scoff with respect to the 
perspectives that we are offering about 
what we see every day and the con-
versations we have with people on the 
ground. 
Why I think it merits conversation 
here on the floor of the House is—and I 
want to get the gentleman from Vir-
ginia’s perspective on this—on behalf 
of the American people who we rep-
resent, the people of the Common-
wealth of Virginia, the people of the 
State of Texas, the many people we 
represent, we are trying to articulate, 
for a body of representatives of those 
people, that their lives are being im-
pacted and harmed by virtue of the re-
fusal of this administration and, frank-
ly, many of the people of this Chamber 
to secure the border of the United 
States. 
In very short outline form, it comes 
in the form of empowered cartels, dan-
gerous individuals crossing our border, 
be they criminals, be they terrorist 
members, or be they folks from state- 
sponsors of terror. 
It comes in the form of dangerous 
fentanyl and narcotics coming into our 
communities, poisoning our families, 
poisoning our young, killing people in 
schools. 
It comes in the form of physical prop-
erty damage to ranchers, business own-
ers, and people dealing with the dan-
gerous flow coming across the border. 
It comes in the form of economic im-
pacts and devastation. 
It comes in the form of, for example, 
the town of Uvalde, Texas, where you 
have 100 a day being dropped off. They 
have to deal with: What do we do? Do 
we ship them to San Antonio? What do 
we do with our schools? What do we do 
with our hospitals? 
It comes in the form of danger be-
cause Border Patrol can’t monitor the 
border, and people come in, known got- 
aways. 
It comes in the form of having crimi-
nals that exist in the United States 
that aren’t being prosecuted because, 
allegedly, we don’t have bed space, but 
really, we are not allowing ICE to do 
its job. You had, for example, 25,000 
prosecutions last year as opposed to 
something like 250,000 at the peak of 
the Trump administration. 
Madam Speaker, I could go on and on 
and on. My point is, there is a direct 
consequence and direct harm to the 
American people: dead Americans, dead 
migrants, fentanyl pouring in, in-
creased substance abuse, empowerment 
of cartels, empowerment of China. This 
is happening on a daily basis and get-
ting worse. 
Finally, now we are being told, even 
as the Speaker of the House has 
COVID—if you look at the top stories 
in Politico, oh, my gosh, everybody is 
running around. There are COVID-posi-
tive people in D.C. 
Even as all of that is occurring, even 
as the extension of the proxy voting 
fraud that is occurring in the House of 
Representatives—by ‘‘fraud,’’ I mean 
that half of this body, or more, is sign-
ing up and standing up at this podium 
every day, saying, ‘‘I am not voting be-
cause of COVID,’’ signing documenta-
tion, and we know the vast majority 
has nothing to do with COVID. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, 
in addition to not showing up here to 
do the job that their constituents sent 
them here to do, they are literally 
lying about the reason they are not 
here. 
Mr. ROY. Well, I never have proxy- 
voted. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Same here. 
Mr. ROY. There is some sort of form, 
and you sign the form. In that lan-
guage, you say, ‘‘due to the COVID 
emergency,’’ or something to that ef-
fect. I don’t want to misrepresent the 
exact legal language. ‘‘Due to the 
COVID emergency, I cannot be here to 
vote, so I am allowing so-and-so col-
league to vote for me.’’ 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. I have been 
tempted to interrupt during the proxy 
voting to ask the Speaker to allow me 
to offer a prayer for the healing and re-
covery of the dozens of Members of 
Congress who are not at work and who 
are apparently too sick from COVID to 
show up and do their job. 
b 1345 
Mr. ROY. Given that we have lines 
and lines of people voting by proxy, 
given that we have the Speaker of the 
House having COVID, given that Polit-
ico is writing stories about how COVID 
is impacting the swamp, given that you 
have to wear a mask on airplanes, 
given that we are continuing to require 
members of our military to get a nee-
dle stuck in their arm or potentially 
lose their job, given that we are con-
tinuing 
to 
require 
among 
Federal 
workers like Border Patrol that they 
get a needle in their arm or lose their 
job, then comes along the infinite wis-
dom of the CDC director and the head 
of DHS, Secretary Mayorkas, oh, let’s 
get rid of title 42, literally the only 
thing that is actually being used to en-
force the border and stop half the flow 
of people coming across our border. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Of course. 
That is why they are getting rid of it 
because it has been used to turn back 
some illegal immigrants at the border. 
Mr. ROY. Is the gentleman aware of 
this? 
Did we take a trip together to Del 
Rio, Texas, a month ago? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. We did. Where 
just a couple months ago you had 
‘‘Bidentown’’ with some 20,000 illegal 
Haitian immigrants gathered under the 
bridge. We learned a lot while we were 
there, and I thank the gentleman for 
leading that trip. 
I also want to say thank you to my 
friend, the Congressman from Wis-
consin, for allowing us to do this, and 
Congressman ROY for allowing me to 
join him.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4425 
April 7, 2022 
But we had the 20,000 illegal Haitian 
immigrants gathered in ‘‘Bidentown’’ 
under the bridge which they quickly— 
they weren’t concerned that the immi-
grants were coming in the country ille-
gally. They were concerned about the 
image and the embarrassment of 20,000 
of them in ‘‘Biden’s village’’ there 
under the bridge, so they wanted to 
distribute them into the interior of the 
country as quickly as they could to 
hide it from the American people. 
The gentleman will remember at 
first they tried to keep the media from 
covering it. And then what they did 
was bus them into the country to wher-
ever they wanted to go. They flew a 
few back to Haiti, but most of them 
they distributed into the country. 
But we learned when we were in Del 
Rio—and my friend may have already 
known this—I learned it that day when 
we were there that there were 1,000 a 
day coming just through that corridor. 
Sadly, that is just a fraction of the 
7,000 a day who are coming across the 
southern border along Arizona, New 
Mexico, Arizona, and, of course, Texas. 
But to this President’s policies now, 
what is the response? 
We want to try to double or even tri-
ple that by rescinding title 42. 
Mr. ROY. Does the gentleman re-
member that we stood at the river in 
Del Rio, and we were there at the spot 
where many thousands of Haitians had 
crossed last September? Does the gen-
tleman remember that? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right. 
Mr. ROY. Is the gentleman aware of 
whether or not the Secretary of Home-
land Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, or, 
for example, the White House Press 
Secretary, Jen Psaki—quickly en route 
to a deal with MSNBC—President 
Biden, or any other member of the ad-
ministration who went to the micro-
phone 
and 
accused 
Border 
Patrol 
agents—lifetime public servants serv-
ing on our border—of whipping human 
beings in the river; is the gentleman 
aware of any of those individuals 
apologizing to them and ensuring that 
they have been reposted in their jobs 
on horseback in Del Rio? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. I’m not aware 
that they have apologized. 
As a matter of fact, at least the 
President and the Vice President, to 
my knowledge, have never been to the 
border to see what is happening. 
Again, my friend led one of the trips 
I was on. I have been to the border four 
times in my first 15 months here in 
Congress so that I could see better and 
experience in person the crisis at the 
border, to see the human toll, to see 
the environmental toll, and then to see 
exactly where that was happening. 
These are Border Patrol officers who 
were trying to stand in the gap, to be 
on the front line, and trying to do their 
job despite the efforts of this adminis-
tration to prevent them from doing 
their job, and putting their lives, lit-
erally, at risk. 
The previous time I was at the bor-
der—not the Del Rio trip—but the pre-
vious time I was in Arizona, there was 
actually a shooting of a Border Patrol 
officer while I was there. And yet here 
we have—as my friend has said—the 
Department of Homeland Security Sec-
retary besmirching, smearing, and de-
meaning his own employees knowing 
full well that is a lie, knowing full they 
are just leading those horses as they do 
and trying to protect us American citi-
zens from what is happening at the bor-
der. 
Mr. ROY. To make sure the RECORD 
is clear, I think the gentleman from 
Virginia is correct that neither the 
President nor the Vice President have 
been to the border in what I would call 
the spots where it matters. 
I believe the Vice President of the 
United States did take a trip where she 
hopped through El Paso, met with a 
number of folks away from the border, 
went to the border for a quick photo, 
went back to El Paso, and hopped on a 
plane en route to California. I believe 
that transpired some time last year. 
But never to Del Rio, never meeting 
with people right down on the river, 
never down to McAllen, never to La-
redo, never talked to any of the people 
being affected directly by what is oc-
curring at the border. Neither the so- 
called border czar—the Vice Presi-
dent—nor the President of the United 
States have been to the border. 
To be clear, the Secretary of Home-
land Security has only been there, I 
think, a couple of times. And when at-
tending I do not believe he was re-
ceived particularly well by the line 
Border Patrol. 
Does the gentleman agree? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right. 
They say they want to identify the 
root causes. I can tell my friend what 
the root causes are. The root causes of 
the massive surge across our border, if 
you will, the invasion at our border: is 
the cessation of the Trump policies 
that were working. It is the enhance-
ment of the catch-and-release practice. 
It is ending MPP. It is stopping build-
ing the wall. And it is promising am-
nesty and an open border during the 
2020 election for illegals to come. That 
is why they were coming with their 
Biden T-shirts on. It is not mandating 
E-Verify. It is allowing the economic 
incentive to come. It is allowing indi-
viduals to come and be apprehended 
and provided free social services, free 
healthcare services, free education, and 
to be flown or distributed wherever 
they want to go around the country at 
taxpayer expense with no specific court 
date to even appear to have their case 
heard. 
I want to compliment the gentle-
man’s Governor from yesterday. I hope 
that he will follow through on this. I 
hope this will actually happen. Perhaps 
the gentleman from Texas has some 
thoughts on that. He announced yester-
day that he is going to bus these illegal 
aliens right here to Washington, D.C., 
so our Democratic majority and our 
Democratic administration who are 
willfully and purposely facilitating 
this invasion at our southern border 
through their policies can accommo-
date these illegal aliens when they are 
brought here. 
I call on my Governor from Virginia 
and Governors throughout the country 
to do the same thing. 
Mr. ROY. I appreciate the observa-
tion by my friend from Virginia about 
what the Governor of Texas is having 
to do to stand in the breach and to 
stand up in order to protect Texans in 
the complete and total absence of the 
Federal Government to do its constitu-
tional duties: to defend the sovereign 
Nation and to deal with immigration 
which he refuses to do. 
I would note that the Governor and 
the legislature has appropriated $3 bil-
lion in Texas. I don’t know when we 
are going to get that paid back by this 
august institution when Texas is doing 
the job of the Federal Government, 
but, okay, we are a border State. Texas 
funded $3 billion, and we have used 
that to take our DPS agents and DPS 
troopers and move them down to the 
border to be able to back up Border Pa-
trol. As the gentleman knows from our 
experience down there in meeting with 
DPS, he has been engaging in policy 
and building fences and other stuff, and 
now he is engaging in a policy shift 
where there is going to be some action 
with respect to vehicle inspections at 
ports of entry. I applaud that. 
I would note that I would go so far as 
to say, I would support the Governor 
shutting down I–35. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Absolutely. 
Mr. ROY. I would just shut down the 
port of entry. I would look at the rest 
of America and my colleagues around 
this Chamber and say, Do you like 
your cheap goods from Mexico right 
now when we have got high inflation 
and we want to go attack China? 
Guess what? 
I–35 is shut down—shut down—until 
you secure the border of the United 
States. 
But I appreciate that the Governor’s 
step is a step in that direction to say, 
We are going to have vehicle inspec-
tions. 
I hope they are long, slow vehicle in-
spections. I hope they cover every car 
from beginning to end and take plenty 
of time doing it. 
Secondly, using boats and having 
some sort of ability to deter crossing, 
there was some plan to do that, I 
haven’t read the details of it. I hope it 
is sincere and robust. 
And then the third part is what the 
gentleman from Virginia mentioned, 
taking some of these who are dumped 
off by Border Patrol in Texas, putting 
them on a bus, and shipping them to 
the front door of this building. I sup-
port that. 
There are a couple of caveats. There 
is one metric, and one metric alone, 
that I will hold everybody in this 
Chamber accountable to, the Governor 
of Texas accountable to, and the Presi-
dent of the United States accountable 
to: Stop the flow now. That is your job.

That is your duty under the Constitu-
tion. That is what the law requires you 
to do. 
That is why we have the Secure 
Fence Act. That is why we have laws 
on the books requiring you to follow 
the legal processes. 
Do not allow the false name of asy-
lum and compassion to be used as a 
rule to swallow the constitutional duty 
to secure the border. 
I would give the same speech to the 
Governor and to my colleagues in the 
legislature in Texas: You have a duty 
to the people of Texas to secure the 
border under Article 4. There is an in-
vasion, and the Federal Government is 
not doing its job. You have a duty to 
hold that line. 
So that is the metric by which we 
should grade the actions of the Gov-
ernor, the actions of this body, or the 
actions of the President. 
I will see if the gentleman would 
agree. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Absolutely. 
And the four times that I have been to 
the border in the last 15 months, I have 
never seen a Democrat there. I have 
had Border Patrol, Texas State Police, 
sheriffs, and law enforcement who are 
working there at the border—not just 
Texas, but Arizona as well—where they 
tell me they never see Democrats at 
the border. 
We only need seven Democrats to 
join our discharge petition to get a 
vote on maintaining title 42, but we 
can’t get one Democrat, one majority 
Member, to do this. One would hope 
that just in the States of Texas, Ari-
zona, New Mexico, and California—the 
border States—that we could get, just 
in the State of Texas, in particular, 
that we could get Democrats to say, 
Hey, don’t mess with Texas. 
We are going to join our fellow Re-
publicans, and we are going to support 
Texas’ efforts to stand in the gap and 
do what the Federal Government will 
not do in violation of the Constitution 
and protecting the State from inva-
sion. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I really 
appreciate my friend from Virginia 
pointing this out. 
Let me note that we are sitting here 
on April, I believe, 7—actually, it is a 
couple of good friends of mine birth-
day. I am just glad I said that out loud. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Happy birth-
day to my brother Steve who is 55 
today, April 7. 
Mr. ROY. I will not mention that 
these two guys happen to be known 
publicly. They are a couple of twins 
who are good buddies of mine and their 
birthday is today. 
But I sit here, and I say on April 7, it 
was a year ago almost to the day—I 
would have to go look at the date of 
the filing of our discharge petition 
down at the desk here in the Cham-
ber—that I filed on behalf of us who 
wanted to do it. 
Our friend YVETTE HERRELL had leg-
islation to require the enforcement of 
title 42, the health provision that al-
lows you to turn people away because 
of communicable diseases which, of 
course, we are dealing with during 
COVID. She had a bill that she filed 
last February. Now, keep in mind, that 
was only a month into the administra-
tion. But we knew full well what was 
happening because immigrants were 
showing up to the border with Joe 
Biden T-shirts and with ‘‘thank you to 
President Joe Biden’’ shirts. So we 
knew what was coming. We knew that 
the Members of this Chamber and Dem-
ocrat friends in the administration 
would say: Oh, well, I don’t know if we 
need to use title 42 enforcement. I 
don’t know if we need to use migrant 
protection protocols and return to 
Mexico, because, frankly, we knew 
they would be fine with a flood across 
our border. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right. 
Mr. ROY. So we filed a discharge pe-
tition of that bill. 
Now, I want a little history here for 
1 minute. We introduced that discharge 
petition, and we got our normal group 
of Members who like to fight for free-
dom. We had 30 or 40 of us get on that 
discharge right away. And then it was 
a slog. It was a slog for the better part 
of a year. We tried in the summer, we 
got it to 75. We went on Tucker Carl-
son. We said: Hey, here are the people 
who have signed it, and here are the 
ones who haven’t. 
Mr. 
GOOD 
of 
Virginia. 
Naming 
names. 
Mr. ROY. Suddenly, that list grew to 
125. 
Then what? 
We went back on Tucker. We went 
back: Hey, here is what the list number 
is. 
Suddenly, that number grew to about 
160. We got it up to 195, and then it 
stalled. Then 2 weeks ago, when all of 
the title 42 news started breaking that 
the CDC director in all her infinite wis-
dom—I’m not going to go down that 
rabbit trail at the moment—and the 
Department of Homeland Security Sec-
retary said, Oh, yeah, we are not going 
to do title 42 anymore. 
All of a sudden, people around here 
said, Whoa, well, that will be a thing. 
I knew it was a thing a year ago, and 
my friend from Virginia knew it was a 
thing a year ago. The gentleman has 
been to the border four times in his 
brief tenure. I live 100 miles from the 
border. Well, my District is 100 miles 
from the border. 
So we get this discharge petition. 
Now, we have got it. We have got 210, I 
think—give or take one—signatures on 
that, all Republicans. Not one Demo-
cratic colleague has yet to sign it. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Not one. 
Mr. ROY. Yet there are four Demo-
cratic 
Senators—Senator 
MANCHIN, 
Senator 
MARK
KELLY, 
Senator 
KYRSTEN
SINEMA, and Senator JON 
TESTER—who have all said, Hey, we 
shouldn’t be getting rid of title 42. 
Can my friend from Virginia explain 
why not one Member, even from a bor-
der State, of our Democratic col-
leagues will sign that discharge peti-
tion? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. There is no ex-
cuse for it. 
If this President was doing every-
thing else right—just use your imagi-
nation and just allow for a moment—if 
he was doing everything else right and 
some of his other policies were work-
ing—let’s pretend some were working— 
what he has allowed to happen at the 
border as the head of the Democratic 
Party, never in the history of the coun-
try has our own President done more to 
intentionally harm the United States 
in what he has done in his first year. 
So it is no wonder that not one Demo-
crat will join us in standing up for bor-
der security. 
How did that become a partisan 
issue? 
As you know, we were in an off-the- 
record 
meeting 
with 
Secretary 
Mayorkas so I can’t share what he said. 
I can share what I said. 
I asked him: What is the end game? 
Here we are going to take it from 
some 7,000 a day—it is estimated 18,000 
a day—that means every 3 days you 
will have the equivalent population of 
my home county, Campbell County, 
Virginia, 56,000 people, in 3 days we will 
have that many illegal border cross-
ings. 
By the way, in my hometown of 
Lynchburg, 
Virginia, 
right 
outside 
Campbell County there, we just had a 
murder conviction of an MS–13 gang 
member who came across illegally. 
Again, demonstrating that every town 
is a border town under this President. 
Every State is a border State under 
this President. 
b 1400 
I appreciate you leading on this 
issue, Mr. ROY, so passionately and so 
consistently and so faithfully. Specifi-
cally, you helped lead that letter that 
we sent to leadership of both the House 
and the Senate on the Republican side, 
just 2 or 3 weeks ago, saying no Repub-
lican should support any government 
funding that does not secure the bor-
der. 
So what did we do with the potential 
leverage that we had that was before 
us, if all Republicans would refuse to 
fund a government that doesn’t secure 
the border? 
Mr. ROY. Well, like any good Repub-
lican Conference, we did nothing. We 
did nothing. We let the moments of le-
verage just pass right on by and did 
nothing. 
Yet, I sat here on the floor, while I 
had some of my Republican leadership 
colleagues saying: We got all this great 
stuff. Can you believe what we got? We 
got the Hyde amendment. 
You are supposed to get the Hyde 
amendment. It has been law for 35 
years. Just because Democrats say 
they are not going to use it, you say: 
Don’t worry, we got the Hyde amend-
ment, and then you pat yourself on the 
back.

Ukraine support. Some justified their 
vote for that because it was supporting 
Ukraine. So 99 percent of the bill had 
nothing to do with Ukraine. Yet, 54 Re-
publicans, one-fourth of our body, 
voted against that $1.6 trillion spend-
ing, with no leverage, no concessions, 
nothing really gained. We didn’t secure 
the border; we didn’t end the vaccine 
mandates; we didn’t unleash American 
energy independence. 
Mr. ROY. $1.6 trillion, $1 billion of 
plussed-up spending, $14 billion for 
Ukraine, without a single debate here 
on the floor of the House about how 
much money we should spend and what 
we should get out of it. 
No change to the mandate of vac-
cines being stuck in the arms of our 
men and women in uniform, Border Pa-
trol, 
or 
the 
requirements 
for 
healthcare workers. No change on bor-
der security, none; no requirements 
whatsoever on border security. That is 
not getting a win. 
Now, here we sit. The gentleman 
raised an important question. 
We have got about 5 minutes, to be 
respectful of our friend from Wiscon-
sin’s time. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Who also 
didn’t vote for that bad bill, by the 
way. 
Mr. ROY. Correct, and he under-
stands what the swamp is all about. 
The gentleman brought up the im-
pact—I think that this is one of most 
important things we can say here in 
closing. The gentleman brought up the 
impact in Lynchburg, Virginia. People 
think this is just a border issue, and I 
come down here because it is Texas. 
Yeah, we are taking it on the chin. I 
have ranchers who are crying. I have 
people who are victims of crime. I have 
migrants 
in 
my 
district 
who 
are 
abused, all under the false name of 
compassion, about open borders. 
We have got to sit back and find dead 
bodies of migrants on ranches, get a 
morgue brought down to put 115 dead 
bodies in, in one county. My Demo-
cratic colleagues are like: Whatever. 
Who cares? It is just some problem we 
have just got to deal with. 
That is the reality. But it stretches 
throughout the country. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right. 
Mr. ROY. If the gentleman will 
oblige, if he agrees with these numbers, 
we are looking at about a million ille-
gal encounters in just 6 months of this 
year. We have seen more than six times 
as many daily apprehensions since 
Mayorkas took office. In March alone, 
there were 97,000 southern border en-
counters, through half of the month. Of 
those, 51 percent were removed under 
title 42. 
So it tells you half are being removed 
for title 42, and they are about to end 
it. Mayorkas has used title 42 as the 
basis for almost every one of those re-
moved. So what would it look like, this 
past year, without title 42? Title 42 has 
been used, I think the gentleman would 
agree, more than 1.7 million times dur-
ing this pandemic. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. That is right, 
for 2 years. 
Mr. ROY. In fact, under Secretary 
Mayorkas at DHS, we have seen more 
than 2.2 million encounters, and every-
one who wasn’t turned away under title 
42 was released. 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Into the inte-
rior of the country. 
Mr. ROY. That is 700,000 releases last 
year. 
Now, what about this: In fiscal year 
2021, the Border Patrol encountered 
10,700 criminal noncitizens. 3,662 have 
been arrested thus far in 2022. The com-
bined timeframes include roughly 85 
convictions of manslaughter or homi-
cide; 604 sexual offenses; almost 3,000 
convictions of illegal drug possession; 
and based on reports, at least 14 who 
are on the terrorist watch list. 
In just the first 5 months of fiscal 
year 2022, Border Patrol encountered 
525,000 people, other than Mexicans. In 
just the first 5 months of fiscal year 
2022, Border Patrol encountered 421 
Chinese nationals. In just the first 5 
months of fiscal year 2022, Border Pa-
trol encountered 7,191 Russians out on 
the southwest border. 
I say all of that to say this: When we 
don’t secure our border, when we turn 
Border Patrol into a processing organi-
zation, we leave our borders wide open 
for got-aways. Then we have dangerous 
narcotics and fentanyl pouring into our 
communities, we have people dying, 
and we have gangs. 
Can the gentleman speak to the 
deaths and the gangs and the crime and 
the impact in Virginia, 1,500-miles 
away from where we are even talking 
about? 
Mr. GOOD of Virginia. Yes. The ille-
gal drugs that are pouring in across the 
country, fentanyl and other dangerous 
drugs, at record levels, is the reason 
why we had 100,000 overdose deaths last 
year in this country. In 2021, the num-
ber one cause of death for individuals 
between 18 and 45 was not COVID; it 
was overdose. 
On the border trips that I have been 
on—again, a couple of those with you— 
when you meet with the folks who live 
there, who live on the front lines, and 
they talk about these illegals, they 
will find the carpet shoes. We saw 
them. You see the carpet shoes and the 
camos. Once they get picked up by 
their crime cartel contact and picked 
up to go wherever they want to go in 
the interior of the country, you find 
the carpet shoes and you find the 
camos left behind. 
You will have those folks who live 
there tell you they are coming onto 
their property, they are knocking on 
their doors, they are threatening them 
and making demands of them. These 
folks who live on the border are finding 
dead bodies. The previous trip I was on 
in Arizona, they said they apprehended 
30 Chinese nationals on their property. 
They are from 160 different countries, 
not just Central and South America, as 
if that wasn’t enough. But to your 
point, 160 different countries are mak-
ing every town a border town and every 
State a border State. 
It is a dereliction of duty on behalf of 
this President’s administration. It is a 
threat to the national security of our 
country, to the sovereignty of our 
country, to the health and security of 
our country, and to the financial secu-
rity of our country. I appreciate your 
leadership on this issue. 
Mr. ROY. I thank the gentleman 
from Virginia. I am at just over 29 min-
utes, so I would tell the gentleman 
from Wisconsin that I am going to 
wind down here in the next minute. I 
appreciate his time, his leadership, and 
his indulgence. 
I also want to thank the Speaker and 
the staff for being here while we are 
continuing to talk about this impor-
tant topic. 
I will just close by saying, this is a 
massive national security issue. This is 
a massive issue of the most important 
relevance to the safety and well-being 
of the people that we represent. 
Why this body is not engaged in just 
a complete, full, and robust review, 
hearings, oversight, and legislation to 
ensure that we protect the sovereignty 
of the United States and enforce the 
laws of the United States, is beyond 
me. 
The people’s House has an obligation. 
Article I has an obligation to check Ar-
ticle II and to demand that those exe-
cuting the laws actually do so. 
I respectfully submit to the Speaker 
and to my colleagues on the other of 
the aisle: 
When are we going to do our job? 
How many dead migrants found on 
ranches is enough? 
How many dead Americans from 
fentanyl 
overdoses—fentanyl 
poisonings, to be more accurate—is 
enough? 
How much money flowing into the 
hands of dangerous cartel organiza-
tions, 
transnational 
organizations, 
turning Mexico into a narco-terror 
state, is enough? 
How much do we have to suffer, as a 
people in this country, as a State in 
Texas? 
Again, the migrants who seek to 
come here are getting sold into the sex 
trafficking trade, getting abused and 
dying in the heat along the southern 
border, how much of that do we have to 
tolerate before my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle wake up? 
Madam Speaker, I appreciate gen-
tleman from Wisconsin for all that he 
does in representing his constituents 
and for his indulgence. 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, I 
would now like to address several 
issues today and maybe give it a little 
bit of a different spin or a little bit of 
different observations than people are 
getting from some of the other con-
gressmen. 
I was glad today to vote to suspend 
normal trade relations with Russia 
and, hopefully, reduce the number of 
oil imports we are getting from that 
country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4428 
April 7, 2022 
Every day, you cannot help but be 
touched by the reports from Ukraine 
and what is happening to the civilians 
there. 
Nevertheless, I am a little bit con-
cerned about the public statements 
coming out of Washington. I believe we 
should all be working to end this war 
and wind up with a free Ukraine. 
Nevertheless, to end this war, we will 
eventually have to get to the bar-
gaining table, and I am afraid that 
statements being made by both sides 
will make it more difficult to reach an 
end result. The sooner the war ends, 
the more lives of Ukrainian troops will 
be saved, the more lives of Ukrainian 
civilians will be saved, and, quite 
frankly, the more lives of Russian 
troops will be saved. 
To negotiate a final deal, both sides 
must realize and respect that deal, and 
both sides must feel that they came 
out of the negotiation with something. 
I sure hope we are not in the current 
position we are right now 3 or 4 months 
from now. I would encourage all of my 
colleagues, and also the President of 
the United States, when they make 
public statements, to ask themselves: 
Are we getting closer to ending this 
war by my statements, or are we not 
getting closer to ending this war? 
I suppose politicians always think 
about politics. But I sometimes think 
statements are made for political ef-
fect rather than reaching the serious 
goal of ending this conflict. 
I would also like to follow up on what 
is going on on the border and the dan-
ger that we may soon end title 42. I 
think for the future of the United 
States, the most important thing going 
on—what is going on in Ukraine is im-
portant. The most important thing is 
what goes on at the border. 
We all know that around the time 
President Biden took office, about 
20,000 people a month, and sometimes 
well under 20,000 people a month, were 
crossing the border, for a variety of 
reasons. The major one is, I think the 
current 
administration 
isn’t 
really 
thrilled about enforcing our laws. We 
have gone from having under 20,000 to 
80,000 or 100,000 people a month cross 
our southern border, people who are 
not vetted, people who we, in many 
cases, would not want here under any 
circumstances. 
There is a danger that in May, that 
80,000 to 100,000 figure is going to jump 
to 400,000 or 500,000 people a month. 
People are not being vetted, and people 
are coming from all around the globe. 
I will be there next week. When you 
get down there and you talk to the 
Border Patrol, you will find people not 
only coming from Mexico but more 
people from Central America, people 
from the Caribbean, people from South 
America, people from sub-Saharan Af-
rica, people from eastern Europe, peo-
ple from countries that are currently 
hostile to us are being waved through 
after they get a minimal amount of pa-
perwork. We do not need to increase 
that to 300,000 or 400,000 or 500,000 peo-
ple a month. 
The last time I was down there, I no-
ticed that there were a lot of photo IDs 
of people from Central America and 
South America being thrown away be-
fore they checked in. What does that 
tell you? It means people don’t want us 
to know about their past. They are 
running away from their past as they 
enter our country. 
I remember the statement of John 
Adams: ‘‘Our Constitution is only fit 
for a moral and religious people.’’ We 
have to make sure we are getting a 
moral group of people crossing our 
southern border, not to mention we 
have to make sure we are getting peo-
ple who respect our laws. 
We, right now, swear in over 800,000 
people from around the world every 
year. That is fine. They are appro-
priately vetted. I encourage all citizens 
to watch as people come here legally 
and are sworn in. 
Our economy cannot accept another 
400,000, and we know a given number of 
these people, perhaps, have a criminal 
background and are not going to help 
our country. 
b 1415 
Not to mention, no country as suc-
cessful as ours, can accept an unlim-
ited number of people. We are not pre-
pared for them. They have not been 
adequately trained in the way of the 
American ideals, the importance of our 
Constitution, why we have our Con-
stitution. 
Furthermore, 
having 
been 
down 
there, the more people you let in, the 
more it strengthens the Mexican drug 
gangs, and those gangs make $3,000 or 
$5,000 or $9,000 or $20,000 per person who 
comes across here. We are strength-
ening their power. We are making them 
wealthy. Why would we want to expand 
the current fiasco south of the border? 
Last time I was down there, the Bor-
der Patrol told me about fights be-
tween Mexican and Chinese gangs on 
our side of the border. How do these 
people from these gangs get here? They 
cross the border illegally. Is it helpful 
for the United States to have open war-
fare between Chinese and Mexican 
gangs? That is what we are getting 
more and more. 
Our poor, underappreciated Border 
Patrol, more shots directly at them. 
And what does the administration do? 
Rather than strengthen the border, we 
propose legislation giving them free 
college, college that American citizens 
have to go $30,000 or $40,000 or $50,000 in 
debt to get. 
Rather than hire more Border Patrol 
to enforce the border, we hire more 
people to investigate the Border Pa-
trol. I am not sure what psychological 
problem we have going on here. It is 
the same psychological problem that 
looks at, say, a city like Milwaukee 
that is approaching 200 homicides a 
year, and saying we have to investigate 
the police, or we have to make it easier 
to sue the police. 
That same mindset at the southern 
border says we have 100,000 people here 
who shouldn’t come here every month? 
I know what we will do, we will hire 
more people to investigate the Border 
Patrol and make sure they are not 
doing anything wrong. They think the 
Border Patrol are the bad people. 
Another problem, and I don’t know 
whether this has occurred to President 
Biden’s advisers, I don’t know whether 
you wanted a war in Ukraine, but I 
don’t believe that war would have 
started if we wouldn’t have had an 
open borders policy. What do you think 
countries like Iran or China, or Russia 
make of us having an open border and 
not enforcing our border laws? Normal 
countries don’t do that. They think it 
is because we have such a weak Presi-
dent who will never do anything. It in-
vites trouble. 
I have felt for a year-and-a-half or 2 
years that the open borders policy was 
inviting mischief; and that is what we 
have now, mischief that I don’t believe 
would have happened had we tried to 
enforce our border laws. 
Please, Mr. President, keep title 42. 
Fire the Vice President from her posi-
tion as border czar. That is another 
problem we have. 
As mentioned, next week I will go 
and tour part of the border in San 
Diego and Yuma. I have been in many 
other parts in the past. But I go down 
there to learn more directly from the 
Border Patrol. As is common from all 
agencies, you learn a lot more from the 
people doing the work than the bureau-
crats at the top, and I look forward to 
coming back and reporting whatever 
grim statistics I gather from talking 
about the Border Patrol and their sug-
gestions to save our country. 
I hope all Americans listening and 
paying attention are contacting their 
Representatives and Senators about 
what is going on on the border. I per-
sonally believe one of the reasons that 
President Biden is threatening to re-
move title 42 is because the news is 
dominated with what is going on in 
Ukraine, and now is the time you could 
get away with really opening the flood-
gates. But if we are going to save our 
country, we have to enforce the borders 
like we would in any normal country. 
By the way, an excuse for removing 
title 42 is saying that they feel that 
COVID is no longer a threat. If you 
look, over 500 people a day on most 
days are dying of COVID. It is still a 
problem. Right now, or at least the last 
time I was down there, they didn’t even 
feel they had the legal ability to test 
people as to whether or not they had 
COVID. As long as that situation is out 
there, I beg you to keep title 42 in 
place. It is bad enough having 80,000 to 
100,000 
people 
crossing 
here 
every 
month who we have not vetted. 
The next crisis that I would like to 
address today is an ongoing crisis. It 
has been a problem in this country for 
50 years, but I think things keep get-
ting worse. And that is the decline in 
which Black Lives Matter would refer 
to as the Western traditional family. 
Again and again, bills are introduced

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H4429 
April 7, 2022 
around here to provide benefits, and 
the traditional nuclear family is left 
out of those benefits; be it an increase 
in the earned income tax credit or 
flooding more money into low-income 
housing, increases in food share, in-
creases in Pell grants, increases in 
childcare. 
All of these programs an average 
married couple are not eligible for be-
cause in the traditional family, usually 
at least one parent and sometimes two 
are working. In order to be eligible for 
these programs, you have to put your-
self in a position in which you are con-
sidered in poverty, and if you are in 
poverty, you are eligible for govern-
mental assistance. 
I had a woman in my district who 
had two children who were both $30,000, 
$40,000 in debt from going to college 
complain why did her sister’s kids get 
free college while her own kids are 
stuck paying off their debt? She was 
proud of her children; she was proud 
they were current on their student 
loans, but it didn’t seem right to her 
that her niece, who was raised in a 
nontraditional family, or what Black 
Lives Matter would consider a tradi-
tional family, her niece got free college 
paid for by the government, whereas 
her kids had to work to pay off the stu-
dent loans. 
I hope in the future, as we dole more 
money out of this place, we stop dis-
criminating against and showing ha-
tred for the traditional family. I will 
point out, that I think over time more 
and more Americans are catching on to 
the idea that materially they can get 
benefits that they wouldn’t get if they 
didn’t get married. 
I will point out some statistics on 
SNAP benefits. Between 1996 and 2016, a 
20-year gap—and these are both years 
in which the economy is doing well, so 
I am comparing apples to apples—the 
number of people on SNAP jumped up 
from about 25,000 to 44,000. Taking 
those two years, about a 50 to 60 per-
cent increase in the number of people 
on SNAP. 
Now, we have to make sure people 
can eat. I realize all people can go 
through a tough time in their lives, 
where there are some people who may 
have mental problems or such, that 
makes it very difficult to hold a job, 
but when you have a 50 to 60 percent 
increase in 20 years on the number of 
people who have arranged their life 
that they are eligible for SNAP, people 
better wake up because we are destroy-
ing the traditional family in America. 
I hope in the future the majority 
party, as they put together more budg-
ets, or if the Republicans ever get the 
majority, when they get the majority, 
that they would begin to look at this 
problem. It is not a new problem that 
gets press like a surge at the border 
will get press or a disaster in Kyiv will 
get press, but it is an ongoing problem 
as we eat away at the traditional nu-
clear family of this country, and it is 
being eaten away by the programs that 
are passed by this Congress. I hope if 
the Republicans take control, even 
though it is not a sexy issue because it 
is an ongoing issue, I hope they do 
something about this hatred or dis-
crimination against the traditional 
family. 
Now, I will make one more point, I 
make it as much as I can, before I leave 
this podium today. One more time I am 
going to talk about vitamin D. In part 
I am going to talk about it because 
there was an expert in vitamin D who 
I ran into last night from Maryland 
who, again, brought up that he felt he 
had a cocktail which was about 100 per-
cent successful in curing people from 
COVID if they get it. 
If any of the Speaker’s office is pay-
ing attention, I would be happy to give 
them the name of this individual. 
Maybe it is something that should be 
given to the Speaker. 
But the new cocktail, in part, is 
based on substantial amounts of vita-
min D. A week and a half ago I talked 
to Dr. Dror of Israel who commented 
on the importance of being vitamin D 
sufficient. In his Israeli study, with a 
small number of people, he found that 
people who were vitamin D deficient 
were 11 times as likely to die of COVID 
if they were hospitalized as people who 
were not vitamin D deficient. He was 
using 
a 
very 
low 
threshold, 
20 
nanograms per milliliter. Eleven times 
more likely to die if you were vitamin 
D deficient. 
I don’t know what is wrong with our 
Department of Health and Human 
Services on this. I talked to Secretary 
Becerra. It is something that the 
American public should have been edu-
cated on 18 months ago. I personally 
have known nine people who have died 
of COVID. I always wonder how many 
of those would still be alive today if 
they had done half as much to push vi-
tamin D as they did with all the other 
advertising, pushing masks, pushing 
social distancing, what have you. 
But with 500 people dying a day, it is 
still something that should be pub-
licized. I have written a letter to Sec-
retary Becerra; and 14 times less likely 
to wind up with serious COVID once 
hospitalized. Among people hospital-
ized, of the people who didn’t have 
enough 
vitamin 
D—under 
20 
nanograms—25 percent died. If they 
had over 20 nanograms, 2.3 percent died 
who wound up hospitalized in Israel. 
Kind of dramatic numbers. News you 
can use. 
Those are some of the comments or 
issues of the day that I think the press 
should be paying attention to. I thank 
the indulgence of staff for giving us the 
hour. Madam Speaker, I yield back the 
balance of my time.

Vol. 168 
WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, APRIL 7, 2022 
No. 62 
Senate 
The Senate met at 9:30 a.m. and was

f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Almighty God, we thank You for the 
throb of eternity within us, reminding 
us that life is not measured by mere 
heartbeats. Lord, we are grateful also 
that You continue to guide our Nation 
and world. As You guide the migration 
of birds, so Your hand guides us. Help 
us on our journey to be warned from 
our past mistakes, as we continue to 
believe that the price for freedom re-
mains eternal vigilance. Lead us away 
from the illusion that we are standing 
strong and cannot repeat past failures. 
Lord, keep our lawmakers faithful to 
You and this land we love. May they 
strive to have a clear conscience before 
You and the people. 
And, Lord, we continue to pray for 
Ukraine. 
We pray in Your strong Name. Amen. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Presiding Officer led the Pledge 
of Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
APPOINTMENT OF ACTING 
PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE 
The

To the Senate:

Mr. PETERS thereupon assumed the 
Chair as Acting President pro tempore. 
f

f

f 
MEASURE PLACED ON THE 
CALENDAR—S. 4022 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I un-
derstand there is a bill at the desk due 
for a second reading. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will read the title of 
the bill for a second time. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 4022) to codify in statute the CDC 
title 42 expulsion order, which suspends the 
right for certain aliens to enter the United 
States land borders, until February 1, 2025. 
Mr. SCHUMER. In order to place the 
bill on the calendar under the provi-
sions of rule XIV, I would object to fur-
ther proceedings. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection having been heard, the 
bill will be placed on the calendar. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, 
the Senate gavels in this morning for a 
joyous, 
momentous, 
groundbreaking 
day. This morning, we will vote to end 
debate on the nomination of Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to be a Justice 
on the U.S. Supreme Court, and, later 
this afternoon, the Senate will fulfill 
its constitutional duty to finally con-
firm 
this 
remarkable 
and 
groundbreaking jurist. 
The cloture vote is scheduled to take 
place at approximately 11 a.m., and we 
will aim to vote on final confirmation 
in the afternoon, the time depending 
on how many Members wish to speak. 
Today is a culmination—a culmina-
tion for more than 6 weeks where this 
Chamber has examined and debated 
and questioned Judge Jackson on her 
record and her qualifications. Every 
step of the way the judge has proved 
herself 
exceptionally 
qualified, 
thoughtful, and prepared to serve on 
the Court. As I said, she encapsulates 
the three b’s: brilliant, beloved, and be-
longs. She belongs on the Supreme 
Court. It is now up to us to finish the 
work that the President entrusted us 
to do. 
So today is also a joyous celebration 
in another way. In the 233-year history 
of the Supreme Court, never, never has 
a Black woman held the title of Jus-
tice. Ketanji Brown Jackson will be the 
first, and I believe the first of more to 
come. 
This milestone should have happened 
generations ago—generations ago—but 
we are always trodding on a path to-
ward a more perfect Union. Neverthe-
less, America today is taking a giant 
step toward making our Union more 
perfect. 
People sometimes talk about stand-
ing on the shoulder of giants. Well, 
Judge Jackson will go down in history 
as an American giant upon whose 
shoulders others will stand tall, and 
our democracy will be better off for it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2058 
April 7, 2022 
I will have more to say later this 
afternoon, prior to the final vote on 
the confirmation, but for now I want to 
thank Chairman DURBIN of the Senate 
Judiciary Committee for beautifully 
executing the nomination, all the 
members of the Judiciary Committee 
for their thoughtful and respectful—all 
my Democratic colleagues on the Judi-
ciary Committee for their thoughtful 
and insightful examination of the 
judge’s record, and I want to thank 
those Republican Senators who chose 
to take this process seriously. 
So it is truly a joyous day; joyous for 
the Senate, joyous for the Court, joy-
ous for America. 
Let us finish the work today of con-
firming Judge Jackson, finally, to the 
Supreme Court of the United States. 
f 
PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE 
RELATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
on the final day of the work period, the 
Senate is going to pass a much sought 
after piece of legislation: revoking 
Russia of permanent normal trade rela-
tions with the United States. 
The legislation will go a long way to 
landing a painful, severe blow on 
Putin’s economy. It will hinder his 
ability to keep funding his war ma-
chine, and adds Russia, as well as 
Belarus, to a list of nations, including 
North Korea, that are ineligible for 
free trade with the United States. 
I want to thank my colleague from 
Idaho Senator CRAPO for working so 
closely with me on into the night last 
night to make sure that this got done. 
We will also vote separately on legis-
lation regarding an oil ban, and I 
thank my colleagues who worked to-
gether to reach a compromise on this 
measure. We are moving forward today. 
Putin must absolutely be held ac-
countable for the detestable and des-
picable war crimes he is committing 
against Ukraine. 
The images we have seen coming out 
of that country, most recently out of 
the town of Bucha, are pure, pure evil— 
hundreds of civilians murdered in cold 
blood; dozens of bodies of men, women, 
children, the elderly, the defenseless; 
people with hands tied behind their 
backs and left dead in the streets. 
Some of the bodies showed signs of tor-
ture. 
According to a new report by Der 
Spiegel, German intelligence now be-
lieves that some of these murders were 
discussed by Russian troops over radio 
intercepts. And why were these people 
killed? 
Simply 
because 
they 
were 
Ukrainians. So many were children, ci-
vilians, young people, women. No na-
tion whose military is committing war 
crimes deserves free-trade status with 
the United States. 
Let me say that again. No nation 
whose military is committing war 
crimes deserves free-trade status with 
the United States. 
No vile thug like Putin deserves to 
stand as an equal with the leaders of 
the free world. He is a menace and a 
pariah who has ensured that his place 
in history will be one of everlasting 
shame. 
So today’s votes approving PNTR 
revocation are significant. It is very 
important that the Senate pass this 
bill, and I want to thank Senator 
CRAPO as well as Senators MANCHIN and 
CARDIN and WYDEN and MURKOWSKI and 
MENENDEZ and all others who worked 
in good faith with us together on these 
measures. We wouldn’t have reached 
this outcome without their diligence 
and good faith. 
f 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, fi-
nally, I want to close with a few 
thoughts on what the Senate has ac-
complished over the past 6 weeks. 
There are two words that I believe 
perfectly summarize the work period 
we are about to conclude: productive 
and bipartisan. 
In this work period alone, we passed 
a major postal reform bill over a dec-
ade in the making; we passed a bold 
and robust government funding pack-
age, which will help millions of Ameri-
cans in thousands of different ways; we 
passed critical emergency aid for the 
people of Ukraine; we passed the Em-
mett Till anti-lynching bill after a cen-
tury of waiting; and topping it all off, 
we will confirm the 116th Justice of the 
U.S. Supreme Court. 
Meanwhile, before I yield, I also want 
to applaud the administration’s action 
in extending the pause on payments 
and interest of Federal student loans. 
The pandemic continues to impact 
families economically, and that is why 
extension is critical for so many bor-
rowers. 
And while the extension provides re-
lief, I continue to urge the President to 
use his existing authority and cancel 
up to $50,000 in debt in order to provide 
immediate relief to millions of bor-
rowers, boost our economic recovery, 
and help narrow the racial wealth gap 
in our country. 
So it has been a very busy April; it 
has been a very busy March work pe-
riod, and when we come back in May, it 
is going to be very busy again. We have 
a whole lot to do. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Morning business is closed. 
f 
EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion and resume consideration of the 
follow nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The legislative clerk read the nomi-
nation of Ketanji Brown Jackson, of 
the District of Columbia, to be an As-
sociate Justice of the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Oregon. 
PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am 
going to be very brief, and I want to 
echo what the majority leader said, 
particularly with respect to revoking 
permanent normal trade relations with 
Russia. 
The Senate, and those who are fol-
lowing this, should understand that in 
just a few minutes, the Senate is going 
to take another crucial step in bring-
ing every tool of economic pressure to 
bear on Vladimir Putin and his oli-
garch allies. Ending normal trade rela-
tions hammers home that Putin has 
made Russia into a full-fledged pariah 
state. 
As the leader noted, Americans have 
been watching these atrocities—these 
brutal acts perpetrated by Vladimir 
Putin—day after day—on TV, phones, 
and the like—and now the Senate is 
saying ‘‘there is going to be clear, 
clear, clear evidence that what he has 
done has forfeited the right to normal 
trade relations.’’ 
And I will just wrap up by way of 
saying that when we get done, on the 
Senate Finance Committee, we are 
going to continue to work in a bipar-
tisan way to send Putin additional 
messages that are going to rein in his 
economic power. 
In particular, I think it is high time 
to take away the subsidies he gets from 
American taxpayers for his war ma-
chine. That happens when you have 
American companies doing business in 
Russia. They pay taxes to the Russian 
Government, and they get foreign tax 
credits. I don’t believe the people of 
Michigan or Oregon or anywhere else 
believe that their tax dollars—their 
hard-earned tax dollars—should be used 
to subsidize Putin’s war machine. 
So this is a very important step 
today towards making sure, as I indi-
cated, we are putting in place every 
single economic tool to hammer Putin 
and his oligarchs. 
I urge my colleagues, as Senator 
SCHUMER has just done, to vote yes, 
and I also want to thank the ranking 
member of the Finance Committee. I 
talked to him a few minutes ago. He 
continues to do everything he can,

consent that the order for the quorum

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER 
The Republican leader is recognized. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
here is a quote from Candidate Biden’s 
campaign website in 2020: 
The U.S. has a right and a duty to secure 
our borders and protect our people against 
threats. 
Well, that was then; this is now. 
The 
Biden 
administration’s 
weak 
border policies set a new record in 2021. 
Customs and Border Protection had to 
make—listen to this—2 million—2 mil-
lion—arrests, and it doesn’t appear 
that that new record will last long; 2022 
is already trending even worse. 
CBP is currently seeing about 7,000 
encounters every single day, and they 
fear they could see as many as 18,000 
per day—a truly staggering figure. 
To put this in perspective, President 
Obama’s former DHS Secretary Jeh 
Johnson has reflected that a daily 
count above 1,000—above 1,000—was ‘‘a 
relatively bad number, and I was gonna 
be in a bad mood the whole day,’’ re-
flecting back on his experience. 
Now we are at seven times that fig-
ure and still climbing. It is a Presi-
dent’s responsibility to fix this crisis, 
but this President is taking major 
steps to make it even worse. 
The Biden administration has an-
nounced they will cancel legal authori-
ties that have helped CBP contend with 
these massive surges. A group of States 
led by Arizona have explained in court 
that title 42 is ‘‘the only safety valve 
preventing this Administration’s disas-
trous border policies from devolving 
into an unmitigated catastrophe.’’ 
The administration’s attempts to ex-
plain why they are caving to the far 
left and throwing our borders open 
make no sense whatsoever. The White 
House keeps claiming this is a public 
health decision; they cannot keep title 
42—leading you to ask, why? 
Democrats don’t act like they think 
COVID is finished. They give speeches 
daily about the need for more funding. 
They say we should be sending health 
assistance around the rest of the world. 
The only place on the planet where 
Democrats say COVID is over appar-
ently is at our southern border. 
A growing number of House and Sen-
ate Democrats have expressed concern 
and anger over President Biden’s awful 
decision. But press releases are one 
thing. What matters is how people 
vote. 
Senate Democrats have taken every 
meaningful opportunity to back the ad-
ministration’s border policies and vote 
down Republican efforts to improve se-
curity. Their votes have helped create 
this mess. We will see if they finally 
change course and begin voting to help 
Republicans end the crisis instead. 
BUDGET 
Madam President, now on another 
matter, last week, President Biden re-
leased his budget request for next year. 
The President got to take a blank can-
vas and sketch his policy vision for the 
country. But in the critical area of de-
fending our Nation, the President’s vi-
sion came up way, way short. 
Even amidst a hot war in Europe, bi-
partisan recognition of threats from 
China, North Korean nuclear and mis-
sile proliferation, and Iran’s nuclear, 
missile, and terrorism trifecta, Presi-
dent Biden proposes to underfund our 
Armed Forces. 
Even if Democrats manage to magi-
cally get their runaway inflation under 
control faster than anyone predicts, 
their proposal would only flat-fund de-
fense. While China keeps ramping their 
military spending way up, the Biden 
budget would have America treading 
water, at best. More likely, if Demo-
crats’ high inflation sticks around, the 
President’s proposal would actually cut 
the military’s purchasing power. 
As we speak, Secretary Austin, Gen-
eral Milley, and DOD Comptroller Mi-
chael McCord are testifying before the 
Armed Services Committee to provide 
some answers about their boss’s baf-
fling budget request. These senior lead-
ers have a responsibility to be strong 
advocates within the administration 
for the resources that our servicemem-
bers actually need. 
When the far-left wanted President 
Obama to slash military spending, Sec-
retary Leon Panetta waged an impas-
sioned public and private campaign to 
stick up for our national defense. But if 
Secretary Austin is advocating for the 
military’s bottom line, he is not doing 
it very effectively. The administra-
tion’s proposed defense increase of 4 
percent before inflation doesn’t come 
anywhere near meeting our military’s 
requirements to compete with China 
and preserve peace well into the future. 
Yet the same budget lavishes a gi-
gantic—gigantic—14-percent 
increase 
on domestic discretionary spending. If 
our colleague Chairman SANDERS wrote 
a budget and gave the Pentagon zero 
input or influence, it might not look 
much different than the administra-
tion’s actual product. 
So, the world is a dangerous place. 
China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and 
other adversaries remind us of this 
basic fact every single day. Our Com-
mander in Chief needs to get with the 
program. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Madam President, now, on one final 
matter. The last few weeks have con-
firmed a pattern that has played out 
repeatedly in recent decades. When Re-
publican Presidents make Supreme 
Court nominations, the far-left and the 
media melt down. Absurd allegations, 
conspiracy theories, cheap gimmicks, 
and apocalyptic rhetoric are all guar-
anteed. But when Democratic Presi-
dents make nominations, Senate Re-
publicans inquire about past rulings 
and judicial philosophies, and the coun-
try gets the serious process it deserves. 
On Tuesday, I explained how 30 years 
of escalation by Democrats ushered in 
this assertive period for the Senate re-
garding judicial nominations. Now and 
for the foreseeable future, the Senate 
views itself as a co-partner in the proc-
ess. 
On Wednesday, I walked through 
Judge Jackson’s long and disturbing 
record of using judicial activism to go 
soft on crime. Today, I need to discuss 
how these disagreements affect the 
very bedrock of our Republic. 
For multiple years now, the Demo-
cratic Party has waged an aggressive 
campaign to bully our independent jus-
tice system and attack the legitimacy 
of their institution. When the plain 
text of our laws and Constitution dis-
appoint liberals’ policy preferences, 
they 
mount 
radical 
campaigns 
to 
wreck the Court itself. This civic can-
cer began on the fringe, but it has 
quickly metastasized throughout their 
party. 
Three 
years 
ago, 
sitting 
Senate 
Democrats sent the Court an absurd 
amicus brief, threatening retribution 
for a certain ruling. Two years ago, the 
Democratic leader rallied with radicals 
on the Court’s steps and threatened 
multiple Justices by name if they 
didn’t produce the policy result he pre-
ferred. 
Last year, when fringe activists 
wanted to dig up the discredited con-
cept of partisan court packing, Presi-
dent Biden lent it legitimacy with a 
Presidential commission. Now, just re-
cently, the Senate Democratic whip 
said that his side’s court-packing pro-
posals don’t matter because they lack 
60 votes to pass the Senate. Well, that 
was cold comfort considering the Sen-
ator just voted to destroy the 60-vote 
threshold a few months back. 
So this nomination has occurred 
against a strange, strange backdrop. 
The Senate Democrats, who spent 
weeks—weeks—fulsomely 
praising 
Judge Jackson, have spent years at-
tacking her soon-to-be workplace. 
This is why I needed to hear Judge 
Jackson denounce court packing. Jus-
tices Ginsburg and Breyer had no trou-
ble—none—condemning these schemes 
loudly 
as 
sitting 
Justices. 
Surely 
President Biden could find himself an 
institutionalist in their mold. 
But, alas, Judge Jackson was the 
court packers’ favorite pick for the va-
cancy, and she refused to follow the 
Ginsburg-Breyer model. She signaled 
the opposite. She said she would be 
‘‘thrilled to be one of however many’’— 
‘‘one of however many.’’ 
The left’s escalating war against the 
judiciary is a symptom of a profound 
misunderstanding. Judicial 
activism 
sees the Court as a third legislature. 
The left wants one policymaking body 
with 435 Members, one with 100, and 
one that consists of nine lawyers. 
Let me say that again. 
The left wants one policymaking 
body with 435 Members, one with 100, 
and one that consists of nine lawyers. 
That isn’t what the Founders created, 
and it is not what the American people 
signed up for.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2060 
April 7, 2022 
We have seen over and over that 
when judicial activism triumphs over 
fidelity to the rule of law, our courts 
mutate—mutate—into 
clumsy 
proxy 
battlefields for arguments that belong 
in this Chamber and out in 50 State 
legislatures. This is unfair to the 
American people, and it damages our 
institutions, not the least the courts 
themselves. 
So there is only one way to lower the 
temperature, depoliticize the courts, 
and protect the rule of law: confirming 
only judges who will honor the Con-
stitution and not supplant it. 
The road to a healthy Court and a 
healthy country is not striking some 
balance where some Justices stick to 
the text and some Justices try to make 
policy. The solution is for all the Jus-
tices to stay in their lane. 
There is one right number of Justices 
who seek to follow the law. The num-
ber is nine. Ginsburg said it. Breyer 
said it. There is one right number of 
Justices who seek to make policy: zero. 
There are jurists and scholars with 
personal views across the political 
spectrum who understand that all 
judges should be textualists and con-
stitutionalists in their day jobs. And 
that must be the Senate’s standard. 
I see hallmarks of judicial activism 
in Judge Jackson’s record; and, there-
fore, I will vote no. Nevertheless, our 
Democratic colleagues are on track to 
confirm our next Supreme Court Jus-
tice. 
And do you know what won’t happen? 
Top Republicans will not imply she is 
illegitimate. We will not call for court 
packing. I won’t be joining any mobs 
outside her new workplace and threat-
ening her by name. 
Democrats must stop their political 
siege of the institution that Judge 
Jackson is about to join. They must 
stop their assault on judicial independ-
ence. 
We are about to have a new Justice 
whose fan club has openly attacked the 
rule of law. So Judge Jackson will 
quickly face a fork in the road. One ap-
proach to her new job would delight 
the far left. A different approach would 
honor the separation of powers and the 
Constitution. The soon-to-be Justice 
can either satisfy her radical fan club 
or help preserve the judiciary that 
Americans need—but not both. 
I am afraid the nominee’s record tells 
us which is likely. But I hope Judge 
Jackson proves me wrong.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this

The senior Senator from Vermont. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today is a 
historic day. Today, each Member of 
the Senate will have the opportunity 
to cast a vote on the nomination of 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an 
Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
I 
say 
‘‘historic’’ 
because 
throughout our Nation’s history, only 
115 people have served on the Supreme 
Court. Until now, only five of the Su-
preme 
Court 
Justices 
have 
been 
women. Only two of the Justices have 
been Black. And none has been a Black 
woman. So history, indeed, and long 
overdue. 
But I am not going to cast my vote in 
support of Judge Jackson’s confirma-
tion because she is a woman or because 
she is Black; I will cast that vote be-
cause she is eminently qualified to 
serve in the position to which she has 
been nominated. 
Her nomination shouldn’t just be 
welcomed; it should be celebrated. It is 
a major step forward for our democ-
racy. It is further widening the lens to 
help make our Nation more inclusive 
and more representative with each 
passing generation. 
She is one of the most qualified 
nominees to the Supreme Court that I 
have ever considered in my 48 years 
here: a graduate of Harvard and Har-
vard Law School; a judicial clerk at 
the district, circuit, and Supreme 
Court levels; a Federal appellate judge; 
a Federal district court judge; a mem-
ber of the U.S. Sentencing Commission; 
an attorney in private practice. And 
she will be the first ever Justice who 
has served as a public defender, bring-
ing that much needed perspective to 
the Court. No one—no one—can argue 
that Judge Jackson is not objectively 
qualified to be confirmed. 
The manufactured accusations that 
were thrown at her by some of our 
committee during our hearings not 
only fell flat, but they have been re-
futed and debunked by serious voices 
across the political spectrum. They 
hold no water. They serve only to 
showcase the vitriol and the contempt 
with which some Members of this body 
approach their sacred constitutional 
role of advice and consent. 
I said it during the hearings, and I 
will say it again: It is distressing, it is 
disheartening, and as the dean of the 
Senate, it is saddening. Yet I find hope 
in the fact that Judge Jackson’s con-
firmation to our highest Court will 
have the bipartisan support it deserves 
and it commands. I commend the Re-
publican Senators who have lauded her 
qualifications and staked their support 
of her nomination. Judge Jackson has 
earned the President’s nomination, and 
she has earned confirmation from the 
Senate. 
Each and every day, millions of 
American families are living their 
lives, and how they live those lives— 
from the salaries they make to the 
education their children receive and 
scores of issues in between—is directly 
impacted by the decisions made at the 
Supreme Court. 
The Supreme Court—in fact, all of 
our courts can’t be ivory towers, acces-
sible only to and bending to the will of 
a select few in our society. They have 
to be accountable to all—all—all Amer-
icans. To do so, they must reflect the 
diversity of our Nation, the diversity 
that is at the foundation of our democ-
racy—diversity of gender, of race, of 
creed, of education and history—but 
also diversity of thought and life expe-
riences. Judge Jackson brings that and 
more to the Bench. 
Mr. President, I am proud to be the 
President pro tempore of the Senate, 
and I was proud to chair the Senate Ju-
diciary Committee in the past. In that 
regard, I voted for the first woman to 
ever serve on the Supreme Court. I 
voted for the first Latina to serve on 
the Supreme Court. I voted on thou-
sands of judicial nominations, nomi-
nees of both Republican and Demo-
cratic Presidents. I voted for nomina-
tions to the Supreme Court who were 
put forward by Republican Presidents. 
I have long lamented the increasing 
political gamesmanship that has in-
fected our current confirmation proc-
ess, and many times on this floor, I 
have 
warned 
about 
the 
dire 
con-
sequences for our courts and for our de-
mocracy of converting our confirma-
tion process into a zero-sum game 
where one party wins and one party 
loses. But to change that gamesman-
ship requires that we have some adults 
in the room, that we all come here to 
the floor of the U.S. Senate not to 
score a headline or a trending tweet 
but simply to do our jobs. There are 
only 100 of us to represent this whole 
country. So who is going to do that 
today, simply do their job? 
I have taken a clear look at Judge 
Jackson’s record. I heard her testi-
mony 2 weeks ago. I met with her. I 
read opinions that she has written. I 
spent hours listening to her. I saw her 
intellect, her humility, and her tem-
perament on full display. 
Mr. President, she is the Justice we 
need now. For America today, for the 
generations to come, for our children 
and our grandchildren, for all of us, I 
will cast my vote to confirm Judge 
Jackson, and I will do it proudly. 
I hope the Senate can rise to this mo-
ment. I hope it can be the deliberative 
body the Founders envisioned when 
they conceived of this great experi-
ment. Our independent judiciary—in 
fact, our democracy—demands it of us. 
Mr. President, history will remember 
the votes cast here today. I will proud-
ly vote aye. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). The Senator from Georgia. 
Mr. WARNOCK. Mr. President, I rise 
today to express my joy in voting to 
confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
What a great day it is for the United 
States of America, for our system of 
government and the grand march to-
ward the fulfillment of the sacred cov-
enant we have with one another as an 
American people—‘‘e pluribus unum″: 
out of many, one. 
Ketanji Brown Jackson’s improbable 
journey to the Nation’s highest Court 
is a reflection of our own journey, 
through fits and starts, toward the Na-
tion’s highest ideals. She embodies the 
arc of our history. The very fine prod-
uct of public schools, both her parents 
attended segregated primary schools 
before graduating from historically 
Black colleges and universities. 
She is a two-time graduate of Har-
vard; a former clerk to Supreme Court 
Justice Breyer, to whom the Nation 
owes enormous thanks for his decades 
of public service; a former Federal pub-
lic defender who would be the first of 
her kind to serve on the Supreme 
Court; a jurist who has gone before the 
Senate on three separate occasions and 
each time has garnered strong bipar-
tisan support; a judge who has heard 
cases both in the U.S. district court 
and our Federal court of appeals; a 
judge who has the strong endorsement

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2062 
April 7, 2022 
of critical stakeholders from across our 
justice system. From the American Bar 
Association to those who advocate for 
civil 
rights, 
to 
organizations 
rep-
resenting our Nation’s brave law en-
forcement officers, all of them respect 
Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
She is a wife and a working mom. 
She is America at its best. That, I be-
lieve in my heart after meeting with 
her in my office, talking to folks whom 
I trust who know her, and hearing her 
testimony before the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
Under intense questioning before the 
committee—much of it appropriate and 
necessary; some of it outrageous and 
beyond the pale—she demonstrated her 
legal acumen, sharp intellect, and the 
kind of temperament we need on the 
Bench, especially at a time like this. If 
there were any doubts about her char-
acter, she more than proved her poise, 
her skill, composure, and the depth of 
her patriotism through the process— 
amazing grace under pressure. 
As a voice for Georgians in the Sen-
ate, I have said from the beginning 
that people in my State want someone 
on the Court who is fair, eminently 
qualified, and has a record of pro-
tecting the constitutional rights and 
freedoms of Georgians and Americans. 
That is why my office has received 
thousands of emails and phone calls 
from Georgians in every corner of our 
State voicing their support for Judge 
Jackson’s confirmation. 
After hearing from Georgians and 
thoroughly evaluating her nomination, 
I am ecstatic to say that Judge Jack-
son is an excellent jurist who has the 
temperament and discernment to sit on 
our Nation’s highest Court. 
The people of Georgia made this ap-
pointment possible by making history 
last year. So in addition to thanking 
Georgia for this moment, I want to ac-
knowledge that the historic nature of 
her appointment isn’t lost on me. Like 
my brother Senator BOOKER, I know 
what it has taken for Judge Jackson to 
get to this moment, and nobody is 
going to steal my joy. 
Yes, I am a Senator; I am a pastor, 
but beyond all of that, I am the father 
of a young Black girl. I know how 
much it means for Judge Jackson to 
have navigated the double jeopardy of 
racism and sexism to now stand in the 
glory of this moment in all of her ex-
cellence. For my 5-year-old daughter 
and for so many young women in our 
country—but, really, if we are thinking 
about it right, for all of us—seeing 
Judge Jackson ascend to the Supreme 
Court reflects the promise of progress 
on which our democracy rests. 
So what a great day it is in America. 
Today, the word of justice and equal 
protection under the law becomes flesh 
and lives among us in new ways. 
Today, at the highest levels of our gov-
ernment, the administration of our 
Constitution looks a little bit more 
like what it says. And it fills me with 
great pride for our country, how far we 
have come and what we can achieve to-
gether. 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson is be-
yond 
qualified, 
and 
I 
am 
beyond 
thrilled to speak for Georgia in voting 
to confirm her to the U.S. Supreme 
Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 3609 
Ms. HASSAN. Mr. President, while 
we all gather to acknowledge this his-
toric day and prepare to vote to—in my 
case, at least—confirm Judge Jackson, 
I rise to bring up another issue. I rise 
today to urge my colleagues to pass 
into law commonsense legislation to 
bring down oil and gas costs for Ameri-
cans. 
As many of my colleagues have dis-
cussed on this floor, Americans across 
the country, including in my State of 
New Hampshire, are facing higher costs 
from the grocery store to the gas 
pump. As we work together to build a 
stronger, more resilient economy that 
strengthens our supply chains and in-
vests in American manufacturing, we 
must also bring relief to American 
families right now, an issue that has 
become even more urgent in the wake 
of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, which 
has sent gas prices soaring. 
As we continue to counter Putin’s 
aggression and inflationary challenges 
facing our economy, we have an obliga-
tion to work together to bring down 
costs. 
That is why I am working to hold Big 
Oil accountable for profiting off of the 
pain that Americans are experiencing 
at the pump. That is why I pushed the 
administration to release oil from the 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, an action 
I was glad to see the administration 
take, again, just last week. As we look 
at all options to bring down costs, one 
clear way to provide immediate relief 
is by suspending the gas tax for the re-
mainder of this year. 
Earlier this year, my colleagues and 
I introduced a bill to do exactly that. 
The Gas Prices Relief Act will tempo-
rarily suspend the Federal gas tax 
through the end of the year, helping 
bring economic relief to families. 
As in legislative session, I ask unani-
mous consent that the Finance Com-
mittee be discharged and the Senate 
proceed to the immediate consider-
ation of S. 3609; that the bill be consid-
ered read a third time and passed and 
that the motions to reconsider be con-
sidered made and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
The Senator from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Reserving my right to 
object, let me begin by saying my 
friends and colleagues across the aisle 
are right about one thing: Gas prices 
are incredibly higher right now in this 
country. 
The effort to blame this on what has 
happened in Ukraine, however, over-
looks the real cause of the phenomenal 
rise in gas prices that we have seen for 
a year before Putin even invaded. Defi-
nitely, the invasion did increase pres-
sure on gas prices, but the problem is 
that this administration’s policies have 
dramatically reduced the supply in the 
United States and Americans across 
this country know how supply and de-
mand impacts price. 
The gas tax holiday that is now being 
proposed is not a solution; it is a polit-
ical gimmick that would not stop sky-
rocketing gas prices or inflation. In 
fact, Larry Summers said in a Wall 
Street Journal podcast: 
I think a gas tax idea is saved only by its 
triviality from being one of the worst public 
policy ideas of the decade. It will have little 
effect over any reasonable horizon on gas 
prices. It will be counterproductive from an 
environmental point of view. It is the ulti-
mate policy gimmick. 
Rather than accept responsibility for 
14 months of reckless spending or the 
more than 40-percent increase in gas 
prices that had already occurred before 
the Russian invasion, Democrats want 
to blame higher gas prices on the Rus-
sian invasion or corporate greed. They 
also want to ignore the consequences of 
their relentless attacks on the Amer-
ican oil and gas industry, the adminis-
tration’s overly bureaucratic permit 
and regulatory process for domestic en-
ergy production, and the misguided 
policy decisions like canceling the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. 
The solution to rising gas prices is 
not a tax holiday, which would offer 
little relief but threaten infrastructure 
investments and worsen our national 
debt situation; nor is the solution a tax 
on American companies who increase 
their production of oil and gas to try to 
help us become more energy inde-
pendent; nor is it stimulus checks, 
which have the potential, as the past 
ones have, to increase gas prices even 
further and push inflation even higher; 
nor is it to encourage other hostile re-
gimes to produce more oil. 
The only lasting solution to our cur-
rent problems is to bolster American 
oil and gas production to replace not 
only Russian imports but to facilitate 
exports to support our allies and end 
their dependence on Russia. Indeed, I, 
along with a number of my Republican 
colleagues, have sponsored proposals to 
enhance energy independence and undo 
many of President Biden’s misguided 
energy policies. 
Republicans 
believe 
we 
can 
and 
should be doing more to unleash Amer-
ica’s domestic energy potential, reduce 
reliance on volatile foreign actors like 
Russia, and deliver cost savings to mid-
dle-class families across the country. 
Hard-working American families need 
real relief, not political gimmicks, and 
that is why I oppose this gas tax holi-
day. 
I urge my Democratic colleagues to 
abandon the reckless spending-and-tax 
policies that have already failed but 
which seem to be contemplated in the 
President’s newly reintroduced budget 
and support proposals that will actu-
ally lower prices for everyday Ameri-
cans. For those reasons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2063 
April 7, 2022 
Ms. HASSAN. Before I wrap up, I just 
want to point out what you just 
heard—what the American people have 
just heard—is talking points straight 
out of Big Oil’s playbook. 
A gas tax holiday is a commonsense 
solution that would provide immediate 
relief for Granite Staters and Ameri-
cans all over the country. Big Oil holds 
thousands of unused permits at their 
fingertips that they could use right 
now to increase supply. Instead, what 
is happening is Big Oil is padding its 
pockets at the expense of Americans. 
Let’s be clear. This would not take a 
dime out of the highway trust fund be-
cause this bill instructs Treasury to re-
plenish the trust fund, something it 
has done half a dozen times in about 
the last decade. This is something that 
has bipartisan support across the coun-
try—Democratic and Republican Gov-
ernors, Democratic and Republican leg-
islators are moving to suspend their 
gas taxes. This is something we could 
do right now to help American families 
balance their budgets and make ends 
meet. 
While I am disappointed to see my 
colleague block this critical legisla-
tion, I will keep working to bring down 
costs for American families and get 
this bill passed.

jority leader. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that all postcloture 
time on the Jackson nomination expire 
at 1:45 p.m. today. 
For the information of the Senate, 
there will be a rollcall vote at 1:45 p.m. 
today on confirmation of the nomina-
tion of Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an 
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court 
of the United States. Senators are en-
couraged to be seated prior to the start 
of the vote and are encouraged to cast 
their vote from their desks. 
I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). The Senator from Louisiana. 
CHARTER SCHOOLS 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak about saving school choice or, 
perhaps, parental choice. 
Some students learn differently than 
others do. I am the parent of a child 
with dyslexia. I can tell you that any 
such parent knows one-size-fits-all edu-
cation does not work. 
Parents and students should have the 
ability to choose the learning environ-
ment that is best for that child, and I 
think the parent can make the choice 
better than the school board and cer-
tainly better than bureaucrats in the 
Department of Education here in Wash-
ington, DC. 
The charter school program was cre-
ated by Congress for that exact pur-
pose: To ensure that parents could 
choose what is best for their child. 
Power to the parent. Giving parents 
the power is crucial to allowing every 
student to succeed. 
Unfortunately, 
there 
are 
groups 
working to undermine the power the 
parent should have to choose their 
child’s school. 
The U.S. Department of Education 
has decided to disregard what is in the 
best interest of the student with a new 
proposed rule that adds new require-
ments for applicants completely unre-
lated to student outcomes. Applicants 
would have to demonstrate an unmet 
need for a charter school, provide evi-
dence of overenrollment at existing 
public schools in order to establish a 
charter school. 
It seems as if the Department of Edu-
cation is putting up arbitrary barriers 
to opening a charter school simply out 
of prejudice. They don’t want the par-
ent to have the power. 
Our country’s charter schools are 
under threat from the far left and from 
teachers unions who seek to shut them 
down because charter school staffs are 
difficult to unionize. 
Now, these unions know it is much 
harder to spread their influence in 
charter schools; and in some cases, it 
is, frankly, impossible for a charter 
school to unionize. And the giant 
unions see this as a simple problem. 
They know the more charter schools 
there are, the less revenue they get. So 
their solution is equally as simple, 
take power away from parents with 
layers of new bureaucracy and govern-
ment regulation. We should not let 
that happen. 
And let’s just put this in perspective. 
Since the pandemic began, it has been 
public charter schools that have seen a 
substantial increase in demand. They 
opened up sooner, and they stayed open 
in larger numbers than traditional pub-
lic schools. And we know that open 
schools are better for children. Parents 
should have the power to send their 
child to a school where they feel like 
they, the parent, have a voice, and 
where they know their child is more 
likely to succeed. 
Now, let’s be clear who this rule is 
written for—not for the parent and not 
for the child. It is not written to help 
the student. It is written to help 
unions exercise more control over a 
student’s life. This rule makes no men-
tion of how many of these new restric-
tions improve student achievement or 
actually help students. And at a time 
when students are falling behind in 
record numbers, we need new and inno-
vative approaches to our education sys-
tem, not just hand the keys over to a 
special interest group. The truth is, 
these rules give less choice to families, 
will hold students back, and do more 
harm than good. 
Now, the charter school program has 
enjoyed bipartisan support for nearly 
30 years. Any substantial change to the 
program should go through Congress 
and receive thoughtful consideration. 
And parent choice for the school their 
child attends should not be gutted by 
an informal committee of union em-
ployees and education department offi-
cials. 
Those of us who care about the stu-
dent, those of us who see the role of 
charter schools, we have one message 
to Secretary of Education Cardona: 
Back off of our charter schools. 
TRIBUTE TO ROBERT J. WRIGHT 
Mr. President, I want to take a mo-
ment to recognize the career of a be-
loved and trusted Louisiana journalist, 
radio host, and friend to all, Robert J. 
Wright of Shreveport, LA. After 50 
years of radio, Robert announced he re-
tires later this month. His last day is 
Friday, April 29, 1 day after his 70th 
birthday—a 
well-earned 
retirement. 
Robert is a masterful storyteller and a 
critical thinker, always finding the 
other side of a story. He has been a 
voice of reason and always looking for 
the truth. He took his first job in radio 
while attending LSU Shreveport. As he 
says: ‘‘It was indoors, and you didn’t 
have to carry stuff’’—about as good a 
summary of a good job as you could 
ever ask. 
He went on to host morning shows in 
Philadelphia, Cleveland, and Orlando 
before 
eventually 
moving 
back 
to 
Shreveport in 1996. That is when he 
first teamed up with his long-term 
cohost, Erin McCarty, to start their 
morning show that has been a part of 
Northwest Louisiana’s morning com-
mute for over 25 years. 
He and McCarty moved their show 
and has been the ‘‘Townsquare’’ of 
Shreveport on KEEL ever since. To say 
that he will be missed is an understate-
ment. Their show has been as much a 
part of many in Northwest Louisiana’s 
daily routine as a morning cup of cof-
fee. When you interview with Robert, it 
is clear you are speaking with someone 
who cares about the issues facing his 
community, just as much as usual. He 
has earned the time and trust of his lis-
teners. 
So congratulations to Robert J. 
Wright on an impressive and meaning-
ful career. Robert, I can tell you there 
are many who are pretty upset about 
this news, and that is a testament to 
the positive impact you have had on 
our community. 
Robert, we of Louisiana wish you a 
happy and well-earned retirement. 
I yield the floor.

ator for Iowa. 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Soon, we will be 
voting on Judge Jackson’s nomination, 
and I would like to explain why I am 
voting against her appointment to the 
Supreme Court. 
Since the White House announced 
Judge Jackson’s nomination, I have 
emphasized the need for a thorough 
and fair process. Unfortunately, the 
majority 
party 
weren’t 
concerned 
about the rigorous examination of her 
record. The White House and the ma-
jority party have shielded important 
information. We don’t have any non-
public document from her time at the 
Sentencing 
Commission, 
and 
the 
Obama White House held back more 
than 48,000 pages. 
Judge Jackson also gave the White 
House confidential, nonpublic proba-
tion recommendations for some of her

S2064 
April 7, 2022 
cases, but when we asked about a pro-
bation document filed on the Hawkins 
case, Judge Jackson claimed that she 
was not able to access records for her 
old cases because that was allegedly 
because she was no longer on the dis-
trict court. And we now know that she 
sits on the DC Circuit Court of Ap-
peals. 
Now, if that is true, there are many 
unanswered questions about how infor-
mation the White House thought was 
helpful was so easily obtained. So we 
should take into account that all the 
helpful information has already been 
leaked. 
That brings me to the merits of 
Judge Jackson’s nomination. For judi-
cial nominees, their philosophy ought 
to decide—how to decide cases ought to 
be a primary consideration. 
Part of having a judicial philosophy 
is having an understanding of the fun-
damental principles of our Constitu-
tion. Natural rights are a part of that 
system. Judge Jackson explained to us 
that she does not ‘‘hold a position on 
whether individuals possess natural 
rights.’’ 
Now, that ought to be very shocking. 
Natural rights are basic to our con-
stitutional system and principles of 
limited government. Because we all 
know our country was founded on the 
belief that is expressed in the Declara-
tion of Independence: 
All men are created equal [and] they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights that among these are the 
Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. 
And that was further nailed down in 
the Constitution of the United States. 
Our Constitution vests the three 
branches of government with very lim-
ited power. All other powers not given 
to the Federal Government are re-
served for the States and to the people 
thereof. 
The principle of limited government 
is what makes America an exceptional 
nation and sets our Constitution apart. 
Judges must have a proper under-
standing of those basic principles; and 
the way Judge Jackson answered those 
questions, particularly the answers she 
gave to Senator CRUZ, shows that she 
lacks that very necessary foundation. 
Now, I want to go on to a few other 
examples. At the hearing, Judge Jack-
son testified about one of her decisions 
involving the First Step Act. In that 
case, prosecutors had rock-solid evi-
dence against a dangerous drug king-
pin, but Judge Jackson was displeased 
the government pursued a mandatory 
minimum sentence. 
So she misused a motion for compas-
sionate release to resentence that per-
son to a sentence she thought he de-
served. 
As the lead author of the First Step 
Act, I know that is not what we wrote 
the statute to do. The act was supposed 
to allow elderly inmates and those suf-
fering from terminal illness to petition 
the court for a sentence reduction. The 
statute also allows for a reduction if 
the court finds an ‘‘extraordinary and 
compelling reason.’’ 
Judges should use great discretion. 
Judges 
should 
weigh 
against 
the 
charge, the dangers to society, and the 
risk of recidivism. 
At her hearing, Judge Jackson said 
that she based her ‘‘extraordinary and 
compelling’’ finding on the nonretro-
active changes to the law. This radical 
interpretation is terrible and dan-
gerous. 
Congress chose which provisions the 
First Step Act would apply retro-
actively. The Senate is currently con-
sidering legislation that I cosponsored 
with Chairman DURBIN
that makes 
some of the First Step Act provisions 
retroactive, but that is Congress’s role, 
not Judge Jackson’s role. 
Senator DURBIN and I wouldn’t have 
been able to broker a compromise on 
that legislation if Senators thought 
the judges would rewrite the law and 
insert their own views from the bench. 
Decisions like this will make bipar-
tisan work, particularly on criminal 
justice reform, harder to do. 
A case by the name of Young is just 
one example of Judge Jackson’s lenient 
approach to criminal law and sen-
tencing. She also declined to apply a 
number of sentencing enhancements 
that Congress put into the sentencing 
guidelines. 
A case by the name of Make the Road 
New York v. McAleenan is another case 
that shows how Judge Jackson used 
her methodology to reach a result that 
contradicts the plain text of the law. 
Congress gave the Secretary of Home-
land Security—and these are the words 
from the law—‘‘sole and unreviewable 
discretion’’ to decide whether illegal 
immigrants should be subject to expe-
dited removal within 2 years. Judge 
Jackson reviewed the Agency’s deci-
sion anyway, and it seems clear why. 
She went out of her lane to comment 
on the policy as, in her words, ‘‘a ter-
rible proposal.’’ And she claimed that 
the government attorneys made an ar-
gument that ‘‘reeks of bad faith.’’ 
‘‘Reeks of bad faith’’ are her words. 
In fact, her decision and her rhetoric 
are unfounded. So that is why her deci-
sion earned a strong rebuke from the 
panel of liberal and conservative judges 
when she was reversed by the DC Cir-
cuit. 
Judge Millett, an Obama appointee, 
explained it this way in the opinion: 
[T]here could hardly be a more definitive 
expression of congressional intent [than] . . . 
‘‘sole and unreviewable discretion.’’ 
These are just a few examples of 
Judge Jackson’s judicial activism. Be-
cause her record clearly shows she does 
not believe in or act within the limited 
and proper role of a judge, I will vote 
against her confirmation. 
I yield the floor. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
today in support of the nomination of 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to be an Asso-
ciate Justice on the U.S. Supreme 
Court. Based on my careful review of 
her record and experience, as well as 
my assessment of her character and ju-
dicial philosophy, I believe that she 
warrants confirmation to the High 
Court. 
The Constitution delineates the roles 
of the President and the Senate in 
nominating and confirming members of 
the Federal judiciary. Article II grants 
the President the power to nominate 
judges, and it gives the Senate the 
power of advice and consent for such 
nominations. 
Evaluating a nominee to serve a life-
time appointment on the Supreme 
Court is one of the most consequential 
responsibilities of any Senator. Accord-
ingly, I closely examine each nomi-
nee’s 
qualifications, 
experience, 
writings, judicial philosophy, and per-
sonal integrity. One factor I do not 
consider is the political party of the 
nominating president. 
I have spent the last several weeks 
reviewing Judge Jackson’s record, both 
before and after she became a Federal 
judge. Prior to and after her hearings 
before 
the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Com-
mittee, Judge Jackson and I spent 
more than 2 and a half hours discussing 
her jurisprudence and approach to de-
ciding cases. I explored her views on 
precedent and her understanding of the 
role that the judicial branch plays 
within our constitutional design. 
I also watched Judge Jackson’s con-
firmation hearing and, on numerous 
occasions, requested additional infor-
mation from the White House and Sen-
ate Judiciary Committee. 
There is no question that Judge 
Jackson is qualified to be a Supreme 
Court Justice. She has sterling aca-
demic and extensive professional cre-
dentials. She has been a Supreme Court 
clerk, an attorney in private practice, 
a Federal public defender, a member of 
the U.S. Sentencing Commission, and a 
Federal district court judge for more 
than 8 years. She now serves on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals for the District 
of Columbia Circuit. Her qualifications 
have been confirmed by the American 
Bar Association’s Standing Committee 
on the Federal Judiciary, which has 
unanimously rated Judge Jackson as 
‘‘Well Qualified’’—its highest rating. 
Having determined that Judge Jack-
son possesses the requisite qualifica-
tions and experience, my consideration 
of her nomination then turned to 
whether she has the judgment and ap-
proach to deciding cases that are nec-
essary to serve on the Supreme Court. 
Words that I spoke—years ago—when 
announcing my decision to vote to con-
firm Justice Elena Kagan to the Su-
preme 
Court 
remain 
my 
standard 
today: ‘‘I believe it is . . . critical for 
nominees to have a judicial philosophy 
that is devoid of prejudgment, par-
tisanship, and preference. Only then 
will the decisions handed down from 
the bench be impartial and consistent 
with legal precedents and the constitu-
tional foundations of our democratic 
system.’’ 
Federal judges at all levels who are 
entrusted with lifetime appointments 
must avoid the temptation to exceed 
their constitutional role. That is par-
ticularly important for Supreme Court

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2065 
April 7, 2022 
Justices, who issue rulings from which 
there is no further opportunity for ap-
peal. 
Judge Jackson testified that, as a 
judge, she seeks to ‘‘decide cases from 
a neutral posture’’ and rules ‘‘without 
fear or favor, consistent with [her] ju-
dicial oath.’’ She also correctly ac-
knowledged that the role of a judge ‘‘is 
a limited one’’ and that she is only em-
powered to ‘‘decide cases and con-
troversies 
that 
are 
properly 
pre-
sented.’’ She added that her ‘‘judicial 
role is further constrained by careful 
adherence to precedent.’’ 
During her hearing, Judge Jackson 
was asked whether she believes that 
the Constitution is a living document 
with a meaning that evolves over time. 
In response, she discussed the impor-
tance of ‘‘adherence to the text’’ and 
how her judicial powers are con-
strained by the meaning of the text at 
the ‘‘time of the founding.’’ She also 
explained that she does not believe in a 
‘‘living Constitution,’’ rejecting the 
theory that it is a changing document 
‘‘infused with [her] own policy perspec-
tive or the policy perspective of the 
day.’’ 
In these responses, she demonstrated 
an understanding of the limited role of 
the judiciary. As Chief Justice John 
Marshall wrote in the 1803 decision 
Marbury v. Madison, the Court must 
‘‘say what the law is.’’ For any judge to 
do more would undermine the separa-
tion of powers enshrined in the Con-
stitution. 
I also valued the testimony of Judge 
Thomas Griffith, who was appointed to 
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Dis-
trict of Columbia Circuit by President 
George W. Bush. He explained that, on 
several occasions, he reviewed Judge 
Jackson’s decisions on appeal. Al-
though they did not always agree on 
the outcome, he ‘‘respected her diligent 
and careful approach, her deep under-
standing, and collegial manner.’’ He 
added that, in his view, Judge Jackson 
‘‘is an independent jurist who adju-
dicates based on the facts and law and 
not as a partisan.’’ 
To be sure, I do not agree with some 
of the decisions that Judge Jackson 
has rendered as a Federal judge. For in-
stance, in Make the Road New York v. 
McAleenan, I believe that Judge Jack-
son was wrong to review a decision 
that Congress—through Federal law— 
left to the ‘‘sole and unreviewable dis-
cretion’’ of the Secretary of Homeland 
Security. The Court of Appeals rightly 
reversed her ruling in that case. When 
I asked Judge Jackson about her deci-
sion, however, I respected the fact that 
she was able to articulate the thought-
ful—albeit ultimately mistaken—anal-
ysis that she employed. 
Similarly, I disagree with the sen-
tences that she has imposed in some of 
the criminal cases that have come be-
fore her. As a general matter, I believe 
that judges should have some discre-
tion in sentencing. This allows them to 
take into account the unique cir-
cumstances of each case—whether ag-
gravating or mitigating—to determine 
an appropriate punishment for the 
crimes committed. 
Other Federal judges—appointed by 
Presidents of both parties—have devi-
ated from the U.S. Sentencing Guide-
lines in some of the same types of cases 
handled by Judge Jackson. For in-
stance, a 2021 report by the U.S. Sen-
tencing Commission explained that 
‘‘[l]ess than one-third (30.0%) of non- 
production child pornography offenders 
received a sentence within the guide-
line range in fiscal year 2019.’’ 
The recent surge in crime, exacer-
bated by the vilification of law enforce-
ment, is causing tremendous harm in 
cities across America. Thus, in evalu-
ating Judge Jackson’s approach to 
criminal cases, I appreciate the input 
from the Fraternal Order of Police, 
which concluded that she ‘‘has consid-
ered the facts and applied the law con-
sistently and fairly on a range of 
issues.’’ That organization explained 
that it is ‘‘reassured that, should she 
be confirmed, she would approach her 
future cases with an open mind and 
treat issues related to law enforcement 
fairly and justly.’’ 
Just as I have disagreed with some of 
her decisions to date, I have no doubt 
that, if Judge Jackson is confirmed, I 
will not agree with every vote that she 
casts as a Justice. That alone, how-
ever, is not disqualifying. Indeed, that 
statement applies to all six Justices, 
nominated by both Republican and 
Democratic Presidents, whom I have 
voted to confirm. 
I have concluded that Judge Jackson 
possesses the experience, judicial phi-
losophy, and character to serve our 
country honorably as an Associate Jus-
tice of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
I would be remiss if I did not take 
this opportunity to speak on the pro-
foundly disturbing trend of politicizing 
the courts and the judicial nomination 
process. This trend dates back decades 
and, sadly, continues to damage the 
reputation of this body and the inde-
pendence of our courts. Today, calls to 
‘‘pack’’ the Supreme Court in an appar-
ent effort to dictate the outcome of 
cases are dangerous and undermine the 
public’s confidence in our judiciary. 
Part 
of 
the 
reason 
for 
this 
politicization is that, in recent years, 
the process has increasingly moved 
away from what I believe to be appro-
priate for evaluating a Supreme Court 
nominee. In my view, the role the Con-
stitution assigns to the Senate is to ex-
amine the experience, qualifications, 
philosophy, and integrity of the nomi-
nee. It is not to assess whether a nomi-
nee reflects the ideology of an indi-
vidual Senator or would rule exactly as 
an individual Senator would want. 
It used to be common for Senators to 
give the President, regardless of polit-
ical party, considerable deference in 
the choice of a nominee as long as the 
President’s choice possessed the req-
uisite credentials, experience, integ-
rity, and respect for the Constitution. 
One need look no further than the 98–0 
vote that conservative Justice Scalia 
received in 1986 and the 96–3 vote that 
liberal Justice Ginsburg received in 
1993. 
This approach served the Senate, the 
Court, and the country well. It in-
stilled confidence in the independence 
and the integrity of the judiciary and 
helped keep the Court above the polit-
ical fray. And this is the approach that 
I plan to continue to use for Supreme 
Court nominations because it runs 
counter to the disturbing trend of po-
liticizing the judicial nomination proc-
ess. 
I urge my colleagues to denounce 
partisan attacks on our courts and to 
join me in working to reverse this 
harmful trend. 
Similarly, I urge the Court itself to 
strive to forge consensus. A defining 
characteristic of a democracy, one that 
differentiates it from an autocracy, is 
that we are all, from the humblest to 
the most powerful, governed by the 
rule of law. That protection is inevi-
tably weakened when those charged 
with upholding the primacy of the rule 
of law cannot agree on what the law 
provides. The perception held by some, 
whether fair or not, that Supreme 
Court Justices are guided by their per-
sonal views undermines respect for the 
law, posing a threat to the principle 
that holds us together as Americans. 
This danger will only grow if the 
Court continues to exhibit recurring 
and predictable differences on the most 
significant legal issues of our time. 
Thus, I think it is essential that the 
Justices endeavor to reach consensus, 
especially on matters with the greatest 
potential to cause conflict. 
To state this point in simpler terms, 
at times when our country is deeply di-
vided along political and ideological 
lines, the Supreme Court is uniquely 
positioned to ensure that we adhere to 
the ties that bind us. Its ability to per-
form that function is diminished, how-
ever, when its members appear no less 
divided than the rest of the country. 
I will cast my vote to confirm Judge 
Ketanji Brown Jackson to the U.S. Su-
preme Court. 
Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it 
gives me tremendous honor and pride 
to offer remarks in recognition of this 
truly historic moment. I was first 
elected to the Senate in 2008 and came 
to Washington alongside our Nation’s 
first African-American President. I re-
member the aura of historical signifi-
cance that permeated the whole coun-
try during those early days of the 
Obama administration. In particular, I 
remember the awe and joy surrounding 
the inauguration, with Americans lin-
ing our streets, packed on the National 
Mall and glued to television screens in 
New Hampshire and across our coun-
try. I have thought a lot about this re-
cently because I see that same excite-
ment, anticipation, and recognition of 
history unfolding before our eyes as we 
as a nation are on the cusp of elevating 
our first female African-American Jus-
tice to the highest Court in our land.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2066 
April 7, 2022 
Our Constitution has served as a 
model for modern democracies around 
the world. Important pillars of our so-
ciety like equality under the law, free-
dom of speech, press, and religion and 
the separation of powers are all innova-
tions that have made America a beacon 
of democracy around the world. What 
makes our Constitution particularly 
exceptional is its ability to be adjusted 
and adapted to more faithfully reflect 
the interests and values of our diverse 
citizenry which it serves. Important 
amendments have expanded rights for 
women and communities of color, mak-
ing our society more inclusive and 
pushing the needle toward justice. The 
Constitution guards our basic rights 
and freedoms, and the Justices of the 
Supreme Court serve as the guardians 
of that Constitution. 
It is precisely because of the impor-
tance of this Court and each of its nine 
precious seats that the seating of a new 
Justice is such a momentous occasion. 
And in this instance, the significance 
of the moment has been met by a sin-
gular nominee whose achievements, ex-
perience and integrity are fully worthy 
of the history books. In addition, for 
the first time in history, a former pub-
lic defender will soon serve on the 
highest Court in the land. Judge Jack-
son has already—truly—rendered out-
standing service to her country. 
Judge Jackson’s lived experiences as 
a Black woman and a mother will bring 
essential 
insights 
to 
the 
Supreme 
Court which, for the first time in 232 
years, will approach gender parity. 
While I fully believe Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg would have loved see-
ing Justice Jackson ascend to her be-
loved Court, we still have a long way to 
go before we get to Justice Ginsburg’s 
vision of nine female Justices. But one 
step at a time, we are building a better, 
more inclusive country. More suc-
cinctly put: We are building demo-
cratic institutions that represent the 
public they serve. Justice Jackson will 
make history and bring the full bounty 
of her rich and diverse personal history 
to the Court, just as Louis Brandeis, 
Thurgood Marshall, Sandra Day O’Con-
nor, and Sonia Sotomayor did before 
her. 
I will end with one last reflection: 
Judge Jackson’s historic nomination 
offers hope and optimism at a time 
when partisanship and division threat-
en to unravel our very democracy. Dur-
ing my conversation with her, I was 
struck by her genuine candor in dis-
cussing how she would approach work-
ing with other Justices from different 
ideological backgrounds. She seeks to 
appeal to shared experiences and values 
with Justices whose ideological back-
grounds differ from her own. This rec-
ognition that we all have more that 
unites than divides us gives me faith 
not only in Judge Jackson’s ability to 
forge consensus, but also that we as a 
nation have a brighter future ahead of 
us than behind us, and that we can, and 
must, work together to bridge our di-
vides—ideological and otherwise. 
If I can paraphrase a fellow Granite 
Stater, the great Senator Daniel Web-
ster whose desk I occupy today: ‘‘Jus-
tice is what binds civilized nations to-
gether.’’ And I believe that Judge 
Jackson will faithfully use her seat on 
the Supreme Court to deliver just that 
kind of justice. Judge Jackson is the 
very best of America, and I am honored 
and excited to cast my vote to confirm 
her to the Supreme Court of the United 
States. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this 
Capitol Building has served as the 
backdrop for some of the most notable 
moments in America’s history. In this 
building, wars have been declared, 
peace treaties have been signed, and 
the march toward progress has either 
moved forward or has been stopped in 
its tracks. 
Today, the Members of this Senate 
have the opportunity to take a monu-
mental step forward. We will vote to 
confirm a once-in-a-generation legal 
talent, a jurist with outstanding cre-
dentials and a lifetime of experience, 
and the first-ever African-American 
woman to serve as Justice of the Su-
preme Court—Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson. 
Judge Jackson’s confirmation will be 
a 
glass-shattering 
achievement 
for 
America. 
Consider this moment in history. 
When the Supreme Court first met in 
this building in 1801, there were 1 mil-
lion slaves in this Nation—a Nation of 
5 million people. This very building 
was built with the labor of enslaved 
people. 
And at the time the Court met, nei-
ther 
Black 
Americans 
nor 
White 
women had a constitutionally guaran-
teed right to vote. Women had no place 
in that first Supreme Court chamber, 
and Black women would only enter to 
clean it in the dark of the night. 
We know what followed. America’s 
battle to end slavery saw a bloody civil 
war and decades of efforts to break 
down racial barriers, and the efforts 
continue to this day. 
Our struggle to enfranchise and em-
power women did not end with the 19th 
Amendment, 102 years ago. It con-
tinues to this day, as well, as we strive 
to give our daughters the same oppor-
tunities we give our sons. 
This confirmation of the first Black 
woman to the Supreme Court honors 
the history that has come before it. It 
honors the struggles of the past and 
the men and women who waged them. 
And this confirmation draws America 
one step closer—one step—to healing 
our Nation, one step closer to a more 
perfect Union. 
Nearly a century after our founding, 
we guaranteed the rights of citizenship, 
finally, to every American, including, 
for the first time, those who were born 
into bondage, with the ratification of 
the 14th Amendment. 
It took a long century later for us to 
expand the bounds of liberty again. We 
ensured the Federal Government could 
vigorously protect the right to vote, 
the most fundamental of rights, with 
the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 
1965. 
One victory for progress begat the 
next. 
Two years after the Voting Rights 
Act, we confirmed the first Black 
American to ever serve on the Supreme 
Court—Justice Thurgood Marshall. But 
I would like to remind you: That was 50 
years ago. 
Now, with the passage of that time, 
we are beginning to write another 
chapter in our Nation’s quest for equal 
justice under the law, and that chapter 
begins with three letters: K-B-J. 
With Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson’s 
confirmation to the highest Court in 
the land, we are not only making his-
tory; we are carrying on a great Amer-
ican tradition: elevating one of our Na-
tion’s best and brightest legal minds to 
an honored position of service. 
There is no one more deserving of 
this high honor. As we have learned 
over the past month, she is the best of 
us. She has devoted her life to serving 
our country. She has done so at every 
level of the Federal judiciary, and at 
every turn, she has distinguished her-
self. 
But I hear the critics say she is soft 
on crime. I wonder how they explain 
that she was endorsed by the largest 
law enforcement organization in Amer-
ica, the Fraternal Order of Police, as 
well as the International Association 
of Chiefs of Police, as well as an army 
of Federal prosecutors who have ap-
peared in her courts. 
She is dedicated to protecting judi-
cial independence, to advancing free-
dom and liberty, and deciding every 
case, as she says, from a neutral pos-
ture. That is exactly what you will find 
in evaluating nearly 10 years of service 
on the bench. 
I hear Senators come to the floor and 
say: Well, there is one opinion I dis-
agree with. 
For goodness’ sake, she has issued al-
most 600 written opinions in 10 years 
on the bench in the district court. She 
has been reversed a small percentage of 
the time. Her work speaks for itself, 
and when you evaluate it, you will find 
out she is thoughtful and evenhanded. 
As the American people saw during 
last month’s hearing in the Judiciary 
Committee, Judge Jackson has the 
right judicial temperament. Calm, col-
lected, she answered every question, 
even when the questions were hostile 
and 
confrontational. 
She 
answered 
them with dignity and grace and stood 
by for more than 24 hours of ques-
tioning. 
She is a proven consensus builder. 
She has been confirmed by the Senate 
on a bipartisan basis more than three 
times—three times, I should say—and 
soon, we hope, she will be confirmed 
again by a bipartisan majority. 
She has earned the support from 
leaders across the political and ideo-
logical spectrum. Civil rights leaders,

leaders in law enforcement, former 
Federal judges appointed by Democrats 
and Republicans—all of them have 
lined up proudly to endorse her. 
Perhaps most importantly, Judge 
Jackson will help ensure that the law 
works for the people and that the peo-
ple understand the workings of the 
courts. 
For many Americans, what happens 
in a courtroom can be cold and imper-
sonal. Judge Jackson has made a habit 
of making it real. She looks people in 
the eye, walks them through her deci-
sion making with patience and empa-
thy, and she reaches every one of her 
decisions by following the facts and the 
law, wherever they lead. 
She said that her opinions can run 
long. That is by design, because she 
wants America to rest assured—wheth-
er she writes in the majority, the con-
currence, or dissent—they will know 
exactly where she stands on the most 
important issues. 
Serving as chair of the Senate Judici-
ary Committee during Judge Jackson’s 
confirmation has been one of the high-
est honors of my Senate experience. 
I want to give a special thanks to the 
man who spoke before me, Republican 
Senator CHUCK GRASSLEY of Iowa. His 
friendship and fairness have really 
guided our relationship throughout 
this historic process. 
In the weeks since President Biden 
announced 
her 
nomination, 
Judge 
Jackson has already lifted the spirit of 
countless Americans, inspiring a new 
generation of aspiring jurists and pub-
lic servants. Millions of Americans see 
themselves in Judge Jackson—Black 
Americans, members of law enforce-
ment families, working moms, public 
high school graduates like her fellow 
Palmetto Panthers in Florida. 
Everywhere I have gone for the last 
few weeks when I go home—visiting 
law schools, going to the grocery 
store—I have been approached by peo-
ple who have been following this nomi-
nation closely. They tell me how deep-
ly impressed they are with Judge Jack-
son, even under fire from her critics. 
Hannah Amundsen is one of those 
people. She is a law student in Wau-
kegan, IL, a city on the shores of Lake 
Michigan. In a letter to my office, Han-
nah wrote: 
If you can see it, you can be it. [And] I’m 
very excited to see . . . [America’s] first 
black female justice. 
Reverend Krista Alston is a Baptist 
minister in the city of Chicago. She 
comes from a long line of Baptist min-
isters. She calls herself ‘‘a civil rights 
baby,’’ born in 1964, the year LBJ 
signed the Civil Rights Act. 
Rikki Jones is also from Chicago. 
She has been working for civil rights 
for nearly 60 years—since she was a 
teenager. 
Well, late last month, Reverend Al-
ston and Ms. Jones, with four other 
people, drove 11 hours from Chicago to 
attend an hour of Judge Jackson’s 
hearing. 
Rev. Alston said she was moved by 
the judge’s courage, grace, integrity, 
and wisdom. She imagined what it will 
be like years from now to tell her fu-
ture grandchildren what it was like to 
be in that room for that historic mo-
ment. 
And Rikki Jones said she had never 
even expected to hear about a Black 
woman being nominated to the Su-
preme Court, let alone to be in the 
room for her hearing. She said that as 
she watched Judge Jackson, ‘‘it felt 
like the fulfillment of everything I’ve 
worked for my whole life.’’ 
She thought of all the strong Black 
women who came before her and helped 
make 
the 
movement 
possible: 
So-
journer Truth, Harriet Tubman, Ida B. 
Wells, and my personal late friend, the 
Reverend 
Willie 
Barrow, 
a 
Black 
woman minister from Chicago who 
worked alongside Dr. Martin Luther 
King. This moment was about them 
too, she said. 
And this moment is possible because 
of Judge Jackson and who she is—her 
qualifications, her integrity, her record 
of excellence. She has earned her seat 
on the Supreme Court. 
That is why it is so unfortunate that 
several Republicans on the Judiciary 
Committee did not approach Judge 
Jackson’s hearing with that same level 
of fairness and respect as their col-
leagues. 
Thankfully—thankfully—there 
are 
Members of the Senate who are willing 
to rise above the partisan fray. 
I want to particularly commend Sen-
ator SUSAN COLLINS of Maine, Senator 
LISA MURKOWSKI of Alaska, and Sen-
ator MITT ROMNEY of Utah for their po-
litical courage and their willingness to 
support a singularly qualified and his-
toric nominee to the Supreme Court. 
You know, when Senator ROMNEY an-
nounced his support for Judge Jack-
son’s confirmation, I couldn’t help but 
remember his father, the late George 
Romney, who served as Governor of 
Michigan in the 1960s, during the 
height of the civil rights movement. 
Governor George Romney knew a thing 
or two about political courage. As a 
proud Republican Governor, in 1963, he 
marched alongside the NAACP Detroit 
President Edward Turner in support of 
civil rights. That same year when Dr. 
Martin Luther King organized a march 
in Detroit, Governor George Romney 
declared the occasion ‘‘Freedom Day’’ 
in Michigan. 
To my colleague, Senator MITT ROM-
NEY, you are your father’s son. 
This week marks 54 years since the 
shot rang out in Memphis, TN, claim-
ing the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, 
an American who spoke with greater 
moral clarity than nearly any other in 
our history. The night before he died, 
Dr. King spoke at a rally in support of 
the city’s striking sanitation workers. 
There was tension in the air. From the 
moment he set foot in Memphis, he had 
received a barrage of death threats. 
As Dr. King spoke to the crowd at the 
Mason Temple, death was on his mind. 
He said: 
Like anybody, I would like to live a long 
life. Longevity has its place. But I’m not 
concerned about that now. I just want to do 
God’s will. And He’s allowed me to go up to 
the mountain. 
His next words proved prophetic. Dr. 
King said: 
I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the Prom-
ised Land. I may not get there with you. But 
I want you to know tonight, that we, as a 
people, will get to the Promised Land. 
Rikki Jones said that she thought 
about Dr. King’s prophecy when she re-
alized the Judiciary Committee was 
voting on Judge Jackson’s nomination 
on the anniversary of Dr. King’s death. 
It felt like the prophecy had come to 
pass. 
Dr. King didn’t make it to the Prom-
ised Land, but Judge Jackson’s ascen-
sion to the Supreme Court brings us 
closer to that longed-for place. 
I would like to close with one last 
personal plea to my Senate colleagues. 
I hope you will think about this. In the 
years to come, long after we have left 
the Senate, one of our grandchildren 
may ask where we were on this historic 
day, April 7, 2022, when America broke 
down what seemed like an impossible 
racial barrier and voted to send the 
first African-American woman to serve 
on our highest Court. I will be proud to 
say I was on the Senate floor, standing 
at my desk, and casting my vote with 
pride for the next Associate Justice to 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. 
I hope my colleagues will join me in 
sharing this historic moment. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I ask unanimous 
consent that the order for the quorum 
call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. 
MCCONNELL. 
Mr. 
President, 
President Biden was elected on the 
promise that he would govern as a 
moderate and unite the country. He in-
sisted the radical left would not be 
calling the shots on his watch. But 
when it came to one of the most con-
sequential decisions a President can 
make—a lifetime appointment to our 
highest Court—the Biden administra-
tion let the radicals run the show. 
With 
Washington 
Democrats 
in 
power, the far left got the reckless in-
flationary spending they wanted; the 
far left has gotten the insecure border 
they wanted; and today, the far left 
will get the Supreme Court Justice 
they wanted. 
The fringe activists who demand par-
tisan Court packing, attack the Jus-
tices, and describe our Constitution as 
‘‘trash’’ made up their minds from the 
start of this administration that if a 
Supreme Court vacancy should arise, 
they wanted one nominee and one 
nominee only: Judge Jackson. They 
spent dark money to promote this per-
son specifically. They pushed her for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2068 
April 7, 2022 
Justice Breyer to quit. In February, 
one of these groups announced Judge 
Jackson would be the nominee before 
President Biden actually did make the 
announcement. So think about that for 
a moment. 
The Senate has examined Judge 
Jackson’s qualifications with the seri-
ousness and vigor that a lifetime ap-
pointment deserves. Unlike when the 
parties’ positions are reversed, the 
country 
was 
not 
subjected 
to 
uncorroborated smear campaigns, com-
mittee boycotts, stunts with cardboard 
cutouts, or mobs chasing Senators 
around the Capitol. 
Now a few of our Democratic col-
leagues seem to have decided in ad-
vance they would claim that Judge 
Jackson was treated shabbily. I have 
heard that script recited, even though 
it didn’t happen. It didn’t happen. 
Let’s be clear. No nominee before the 
Senate for any position deserves a 
cakewalk or a coronation. Tough ques-
tions about a Federal judge’s own rul-
ings and statements are the definition 
of ‘‘fair game.’’ My Republican col-
leagues’ vigorous inquiry shed impor-
tant new light on a frequently dis-
turbing judicial record. So I applaud 
my colleagues for focusing on sub-
stance and not following the Demo-
crats’ recent precedents into the gut-
ter. 
Unfortunately, what the Senate’s 
process turned up was disturbing. 
First, the nominee would not follow 
the Ginsburg-Breyer precedent and de-
nounce the insane concept of partisan 
Court packing. 
Second, her judicial record is full of 
cases where Judge Jackson ruled like a 
policymaker implementing personal bi-
ases instead of a judge following the 
text wherever it led. 
Third, her aggressive judicial activ-
ism frequently focused on treating con-
victed criminals as gently as possible. 
In literally case after case, from deadly 
fentanyl to open borders, to child ex-
ploitation, Judge Jackson tilted the 
scales of justice away from public safe-
ty and innocent victims in favor of her 
career-long passion for softening up 
criminal sentencing. In Judge Jack-
son’s courtroom, plain legal text and 
clear congressional intent were no 
match for what the judge admits are 
her personal ‘‘policy disagreements.’’ 
Even as a violent crimewave sweeps 
America, Democrats are pursuing a na-
tionwide campaign to make the justice 
system softer on crime. They are 
stacking the deck with far-left pros-
ecutors, woke warriors at the Depart-
ment of Justice, and Federal judges 
who believe criminals deserve lighter 
treatment. This project is terrible for 
innocent American families. And every 
piece of evidence suggests Democrats’ 
view Judge Jackson as its crown jewel. 
I will close with this: These debates 
about judicial philosophy are not just 
academic. The charged political atmos-
phere around confirmations, the out-
sized role that unelected judges play in 
our national life—these are direct con-
sequences of liberal judicial activism. 
They are direct results of the effort to 
misuse Federal courts as a progressive 
legislature that voters can’t kick out. 
A republic of self-serving citizens 
should not spend every June watching 
with bated breath to see if five or six 
lawyers will hand down sweeping pol-
icy changes with zero basis in the writ-
ten Constitution. 
The solution is not to make the 
Court even more of a superlegislature, 
like liberals want—a delegitimizing 
death spiral that would destroy the 
rule of law. There is only one solution. 
The Senate should only confirm Jus-
tices who will follow the text of our 
laws and our Constitution wherever it 
leads, who will leave subjective policy 
judgments on this side of the street, 
where they belong. That is how we 
lower the temperature. That is how we 
shore up the courts. That is how we 
protect the rule of law. Staff the judici-
ary with brilliant men and women who 
understand and embrace this limited 
role. No other road leads anywhere 
good for our great Nation. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this is 
a wonderful day, a joyous day, an in-
spiring day for the Senate, for the Su-
preme Court, and for the United States 
of America. 
Today, we are here to vote to confirm 
Ketanji Brown Jackson as the 116th 
Justice of the United States Supreme 
Court. 
Now, a few days ago, I spoke with a 
group 
of 
eighth 
graders 
from 
Cheektowaga, NY. Many of them were 
students of color. It was amazing. 
When I mentioned that this week we 
were confirming the judge, you could 
see them light up, the unmistakable 
look in their eyes. ‘‘One day,’’ each 
young lady thought to herself, ‘‘I can 
do it too.’’ 
You know, it has been a dark 2 years 
with COVID—people getting sick and 
dying, many of whom we knew, stores 
closing, and schools shutting their 
doors. But even in the darkest times, 
there are bright lights. Today is one of 
the brightest lights, and let us hope it 
is a metaphor, an indication of many 
more bright lights to come. 
As I have said over and over again, 
there are three words that I think best 
fit Judge Jackson: brilliant, beloved, 
belongs. 
Judge Jackson is, in every sense and 
by all measures, a brilliant jurist. She 
is, indeed, a brilliant person. By the 
judge’s own telling, she first discovered 
her calling to the law not in a class-
room or by reading a book or by talk-
ing to lawyers but by sitting at the 
kitchen table, next to her dad, filling 
out her coloring book while her dad 
pored through case law. 
Years from now, other parents and 
other daughters will do the same, and 
it will be Justice Jackson’s opinions 
that will lay open on the table. The 
judge’s parents and her entire family 
should beam with pride that this day 
has come. At every step of her upbring-
ing and career, Ketanji Brown Jackson 
ranked among the highest of achievers. 
And, look, we should take a moment 
to note that Judge Jackson will be the 
first and only Justice with experience 
as a public defender. We are proud of 
that, and America is proud of that. It 
will enhance the Court’s ability to pre-
serve a basic truth in our country— 
that all deserve equal justice under the 
law, from the privileged to the impov-
erished. In an imperfect world, the 
judge conquered so many hurdles and 
today stands as one of the most experi-
enced individuals ever nominated to 
the Supreme Court. 
For this reason, the judge is also be-
loved by individuals and organizations 
across the political spectrum. I went 
through her record carefully, and never 
did I find one instance of a peer or a 
colleague or an associate saying one 
negative word about her. It was incred-
ible. 
When 
we 
go 
through 
these 
records, you often find someone here or 
there who will bad-mouth the indi-
vidual who knew them but not with 
Judge Jackson. 
And, lest we forget, the judge is pop-
ular in the minds of the American peo-
ple. A Gallup poll released after her 
hearings showed nearly 60 percent of 
the public supports her confirmation— 
10 points above the historical norm. 
There is no question here the country, 
by and large, wants the Senate to con-
firm Judge Jackson. Police chiefs want 
to confirm Judge Jackson. Conserv-
ative and moderate and liberal judges 
all want us to confirm Judge Jackson. 
And I thank my colleagues in this 
Chamber who worked in good faith to 
make sure the Senate can finish its 
work today. 
Finally, as I have said many times, 
the judge belongs on the Supreme 
Court. By that, I mean something very 
specific. In our Nation’s history, 115 in-
dividuals have been confirmed by this 
body to serve on the Supreme Court of 
the United States. Of those, 108 have 
been White men; only 5 have been 
women; only 2 have been African Amer-
ican. But Ketanji Brown Jackson will 
be the first African-American woman 
ever to hold the title of ‘‘Justice.’’ 
Think about the impact that will 
have on our democracy. Untold mil-
lions of kids will open textbooks and 
see pictures of Justice Jackson among 
the highest ranks of our public figures. 
How many millions of kids in genera-
tions past could have benefited from 
such a role model? How many would-be 
Justices, lawyers, doctors, generals, 
businesspeople have been lost to his-
tory precisely because their history 
books had few, if any, role models that 
they could relate to? 
We certainly have a long way to go 
on the road to true justice, but by con-
firming Judge Jackson today, we are 
taking a bold step forward toward 
reaching the full realization of our 
country’s promise. We will make it far 
more likely that girls across America 
will feel precisely what Judge Jackson

April 7, 2022 
felt herself when she was a kid: Nobody 
can stop me. I can do this too. I am 
brilliant too. I belong too. 
For all of these reasons, increasing 
the diversity of the Court has been one 
of my highest priorities and one of the 
highest priorities of our Senate Demo-
cratic majority of whom I am so proud. 
Justice Jackson is the most impor-
tant example, but we have been work-
ing on this for over a year. Of the 58 
Senate-confirmed Federal judges since 
we took the majority, three-quarters 
have been women, and two-thirds have 
been people of color. It is not just ra-
cial and gender diversity that matters. 
We have strived to lift up judges who 
bring diversity through their experi-
ence: more public defenders in our 
courts, more civil rights lawyers, more 
election lawyers. 
When Americans of all walks of life 
come before the court, they should 
have confidence that those who don the 
robes have the ability to walk in their 
own shoes, to see and understand their 
side of the story, and then apply the 
law properly according to the facts. 
One judge at a time—one judge at a 
time—this majority is expanding the 
possibility of who merits consideration 
to the Bench; and I would be remiss if 
I didn’t acknowledge my Republican 
colleagues who joined us on this occa-
sion and over the year to achieve this 
goal. 
In closing, I want to thank Chairman 
DURBIN for beautifully executing this 
nomination process. It was equal parts 
fair, thorough, and expeditious—no 
easy feat in this modern Senate. 
I want to thank all of my Democratic 
colleagues 
on 
the 
Judiciary 
Com-
mittee. You were just fabulous—every 
one of you—in your respectful and in-
sightful examination of the judge’s 
record. 
And I want to thank my Republican 
colleagues who chose to take this proc-
ess seriously no matter which side you 
voted on. 
The President sent us an impressive 
nominee. 
She 
merited 
robust 
and 
thoughtful and lively examination. I 
thank the Members who did precisely 
that. 
In short, this is one of the great mo-
ments of American history. At the 
time of our Constitution’s ratification, 
in most States, you had to be a White 
male, Protestant landowner to be con-
sidered part of American society. So, 
from the get-go, generations of Ameri-
cans have sought to establish the 
United States as a full democracy. We 
fought a bloody civil war to end slav-
ery. Women organized and reached for 
the ballot. The civil rights movement 
brought an end to the vicious segrega-
tion of the mid-20th century. And, 
today, we are taking a giant, bold, and 
important step on the well-trodden 
path to fulfilling our country’s found-
ing promise. 
This is a great moment for Judge 
Jackson, but it is an even greater mo-
ment for America as we rise to a more 
perfect Union. 
I thank my colleagues for their work. 
I yield the floor.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. President, I am 
here today to speak in support of the 
nomination and confirmation of Chris-
topher Lowman to be the Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Sustainment. 
We are in a fight for the free world and 
that requires maintaining a robust 
military presence of our allies, includ-
ing and especially NATO countries. 
Any U.S. mission also needs a strong 
logistics chain. That means being able 
to move troops, medical supplies, fuel, 
tents, anything else throughout the 
world at any given time. And this is no 
longer an abstraction. We have seen 
what happens when it isn’t in place. We 
are seeing it in real time with Russia’s 
equipment and training problems in 
Ukraine. 
And that is why we have an Assistant 
Secretary of Defense for Sustainment 
to lead on logistics. As we are watching 
the Ukrainians bravely push back this 
unprovoked Russian war, part of the 
reason that they are having success is 
that the Russian logistics chain is ab-
solutely broken. We, in the United 
States, and our Armed Forces take lo-
gistics extraordinarily seriously. But 
we don’t have the person in charge of 
that confirmed to lead the Department 
on logistics. 
This position is left unfilled because 
JOSH
HAWLEY
is 
blocking 
Mr. 
Lowman’s 
nomination. 
Senator 
HAWLEY apparently disagrees with the 
Biden administration policy on Af-
ghanistan, and so he is punishing our 
servicemembers and our NATO allies 
while a war in Europe is raging. It is 
worth repeating. Senator HAWLEY
is 
mad about what happened 6 months 
ago in a different part of the world, and 
in response, he is harming the Depart-
ment of Defense and our national secu-
rity. 
Mr. 
HAWLEY. 
Will 
the 
Senator 
yield? 
Mr. SCHATZ. I will not yield. 
Mr. Lowman is well-qualified for this 
job, and no one is disputing that. He is 
a Marine Corps veteran who spent 
nearly four decades working for the 
Army. He has the exact expertise nec-
essary to help support our logistics 
chain and help to make sure that our 
military remains the best fighting 
force on the planet. It is time for Sen-
ator HAWLEY to release this hold and 
move the nomination forward. 
This is preposterous. You can do a 
hold. Members do a hold. The Presiding 
Officer has done a hold. I have done a 
hold. I voted no on nominees. I retali-
ated against Democratic and Repub-
lican administrations when I disagreed 
with policy. But a blanket hold on the 
Department of Defense and holding the 
person in charge of our logistics chain 
is absolutely inexcusable. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate consider the fol-
lowing nomination, Calendar No. 777, 
Christopher Joseph Lowman, of Vir-
ginia, to be an Assistant Secretary of 
Defense, and that the Senate vote on 
the nomination without intervening 
action or debate; that the motion to re-
consider be considered made and laid 
upon the table, and statements related 
to the nomination be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2070 
April 7, 2022 
The Senator from Missouri is recog-
nized. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Reserving the right to 
object, now that I have the floor, will 
the Senator from Hawaii answer a 
question? 
Do you agree with this administra-
tion’s policy to denying MiGs to the 
Ukrainians? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator may not interrogate the other 
Senator. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Well, the Senator 
doesn’t want to answer any questions. I 
see. He denied my request to ask a 
question a moment ago. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Is there an objection? 
Does he object or not? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular 
order has been called. 
Is there objection? 
Mr. HAWLEY. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. The Senator from Mis-
souri is recognized. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, thank 
you for finally giving me an option to 
speak. It is interesting, the Senator 
will come to the floor but doesn’t want 
to engage in a colloquy or answer ques-
tions. 
Let’s talk a little bit about the pol-
icy—disastrous policy—that he is sup-
porting. This is the White House’s lat-
est talking points that their failure in 
Ukraine is now due to some logistics 
problem and the Department of De-
fense—they, of course, can’t be respon-
sible for what they are doing, just like 
they are not responsible for anything. 
They are not responsible for what hap-
pened in Afghanistan—their policy. 
They are not responsible for what has 
happened in Ukraine—their policy. 
Let’s talk about their policy in 
Ukraine. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Will the Senator yield 
to a question? 
Mr. HAWLEY. So what has President 
Zelenskyy been asking for for weeks, 
indeed, months on end? He said: ‘‘Send 
us planes.’’ 
What has this administration done? 
No. Actually, first they said yes, then 
they said maybe, then they said no. 
Today, the Secretary of Defense tes-
tified before the Armed Services Com-
mittee, under oath, that even though 
this Congress has appropriated $3 bil-
lion in military lethal aid to the people 
of Ukraine, the Defense Department 
has so far given them less than one- 
third of it. Why, because of logistics? 
No. He was asked that. No, because of 
policy. His comment was: We are giv-
ing them what we think they need. 
I would just point out that that is 
not what the Ukrainians think. If you 
listen to President Zelenskyy, if you 
listen to the Ukrainian parliamentar-
ians who have been here, if you talked 
to them, what they will say is they 
need more military aid; they need 
more help. 
This administration won’t give it to 
them, not because of logistics but be-
cause of policy. We don’t have a logis-
tics problem; we have a Joe Biden prob-
lem, and we have had that problem in 
Ukraine from day one. 
This administration’s policy was to 
deter a Russian invasion of Ukraine. It 
failed. Why did it fail? It is not hard to 
see. President Biden came to office, 
what did he do? 
Mr. SCHATZ. Will the Senator yield? 
Mr. HAWLEY. When Ukraine asked 
for military assistance, he denied it. 
Can we have order? 
Mr. SCHATZ. I am asking, will the 
Senator yield. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri has the floor. 
Mr. HAWLEY. When Joe Biden came 
to office, the people of Ukraine asked 
for military assistance a year ago—a 
year ago. Did he give it to them? No. 
He denied them military stance. He de-
nied them lethal aid. What did he do, 
though, for Vladimir Putin? When he 
came to office, he green-lighted Vladi-
mir Putin’s pipeline. He turned their 
pipelines on. He turned our pipelines 
off. What did he do with American en-
ergy production? He throttled it down. 
He turned it off. 
His first actions in office were to, 
among other things, cancel the Key-
stone Pipeline, halt the leasing pro-
gram in ANWR, issue a halt to new oil 
and gas leases and drilling permits on 
Federal lands, impose tougher regula-
tions on oil and gas and methane emis-
sions, and a host of new regulations on 
other energy production. 
And that had the desired effect. Rus-
sian energy production—up. Russian 
revenues—up. What has happened since 
then, since the invasion of Ukraine? It 
has been one gaffe after another. He 
won’t send them planes. 
Today, the Secretary of Defense also 
confirmed that this administration 
has, in fact, not been sharing intel-
ligence with the Ukrainians. In fact, 
today the Secretary of Defense had to 
admit that the administration was 
going to be forced to change policy— 
his words—change policy in Ukraine 
because of the fact we had not been 
sharing all the intelligence we might 
have with Ukrainian soldiers and the 
Ukrainian military despite their re-
quest for that. Whose decision was 
that? Joe Biden’s. It is his policy. 
The President hasn’t been entirely si-
lent. He did have this to say: 
For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in 
power. 
Now Joe Biden doesn’t appear to 
know whether we are fighting or strug-
gling to help the Ukrainians defend 
themselves or whether we are launch-
ing a war of regime change in Russia, 
itself. 
You know, the bottom line is this: On 
one issue after another, when it comes 
to Ukraine, this President has been 
wrong. On every aspect of policy that 
has mattered, he has been wrong. Is it 
any wonder the Ukrainians are saying: 
Change 
policies, 
share 
your 
intel-
ligence, send us the aid that we have 
requested. 
I say again, we don’t have a logistics 
problem. The White House shouldn’t 
point fingers and shift the blame. We 
have a Joe Biden problem. That is the 
nub of the issue here. 
There was Joe Biden’s comment 
sounding like we are going to send 
ground troops: 
You’re going to see when you go there— 
He said to servicemembers. 
And you . . . some of you have been there. 
You’re going to see—you’re going to see 
women, young people standing . . . in front 
of a damn tank, just saying, ‘‘I’m not leav-
ing. I’m holding my ground.’’ 
The President—it is one gaffe after 
another. It is one switch in policy after 
another. It is disaster from beginning 
to end. And let’s not forget where these 
foreign policy disasters really kicked 
off in a big way. Yeah, I was in Afghan-
istan. Am I concerned about Afghani-
stan? You are darn right I am. Thirteen 
servicemembers were killed at Abbey 
Gate, including one from my home 
State. I will never forget talking to his 
father as soon as we learned of the at-
tack—before, in fact, the official notice 
of his son’s death had been released. 
His father asked me to do everything 
in my power to hold this administra-
tion accountable, and that is exactly 
what I am going to do. 
Has anyone been held accountable 
yet for Afghanistan? Has somebody 
been fired? Has somebody been relieved 
of command? No. Has somebody been 
shown the door? No. Has there been a 
change in policy at the Department of 
Defense? No. 
We just stumble from one crisis to 
another. Why? Because we have a Joe 
Biden problem. This administration is 
doing exactly what their Commander 
in Chief wants them to do and it is 
wrong, again and again and again and 
again. 
Until we see some change in policy 
from this administration, until this 
Senate gets serious about its oversight 
responsibilities at the Department of 
Defense, I am going to ask that for sen-
ior defense leaders, we at least observe 
regular order. I can’t block a nomina-
tion. I can’t halt it, but I can ask that 
regular order be followed. That is ex-
actly what I am going to ask with re-
gard to this nomination and other sen-
ior leaders until there is account-
ability, until we have a change in pol-
icy, and until this administration ad-
mits that on issue after issue, in vir-
tually every aspect of its foreign pol-
icy, it is just dead wrong. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. What Senator HAWLEY 
wants is an excuse to go through his 
litany of criticisms of the Biden ad-
ministration. And the truth is that 
every Senator has that right without 
blocking the logistics guy from the De-
partment of Defense. 
He could have brought his floor 
charts out here and given a withering 
speech about all of the things that he 
thought went wrong. But he is doing a 
very specific thing: He is damaging the 
Department of Defense. We have senior

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2071 
April 7, 2022 
DOD leaders, we have the Armed Serv-
ices Committee coming to us and say-
ing: I don’t know what to tell him. I 
don’t know how to satisfy him, but he 
is blocking the staffing of the senior 
leadership at the Department of De-
fense. 
This comes from a guy who raised his 
fist in solidarity with the insurrection-
ists. This comes from a guy who, before 
the Russian invasion, suggested that 
maybe it would be wise for Zelenskyy 
to make a few concessions about 
Ukraine and their willingness to join 
NATO. This comes from a guy who, 
just about a month ago, voted against 
Ukraine aid. He is saying it is going 
too slow. He voted no. He voted no on 
Ukraine aid, and now, he has the gall 
to say it is going too slow. 
And this final insult is that until— 
what—Secretary Austin resigns? That 
is not a serious request. People used to 
come to me during the Trump adminis-
tration all the time: Do you think 
Trump should resign? Do you think 
Tillerson should resign? That is stupid. 
Of course, I think all the people I dis-
agree with should quit their jobs and 
be replaced with people I love; of 
course, I think they should all resign. 
That is not how this world works. That 
is not a reasonable request from a U.S. 
Senator: Until the Secretary of Defense 
quits his job, I am going to block all 
his nominees. That is preposterous— 
and coming from a person who exoner-
ated 
Donald 
Trump 
for 
extorting 
Zelenskyy for withholding lethal aid. 
They withheld lethal aid until—un-
less—Zelenskyy would release false 
smears against Joe Biden’s son, and 
then he voted to exonerate President 
Trump for this. So spare me the new 
solidarity with the Ukrainians and 
with the free world, because this man’s 
record is exactly the opposite. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I just 
want to make some comments regard-
ing what the junior Senator from Mis-
souri was just talking about on the 
floor, and I know that my colleague 
from 
Hawaii 
was 
providing 
com-
mentary as well. 
It is hard to comprehend how any 
Member of Congress, House or Senate, 
could come to the floor and make the 
criticism of the Biden administration 
regarding its Ukraine policy, especially 
with regard to the military assistance 
provided by this administration, and 
that same Senator, along with a long 
list of Republican Senators, voted 
against all the money for Ukraine just 
a couple weeks ago, $13.6 billion. 
But, unfortunately, it is entirely con-
sistent with what those same 31 Sen-
ators have been doing for the last cou-
ple of weeks. They voted against all 
the money in March, and then they 
criticize President Biden. In fact, the 
day of President Zelenskyy’s speech to 
the Congress—that inspiring speech— 
that so many of us were moved by, peo-
ple in both parties, both Houses, all 
across the country, in fact, across the 
world were moved by what he said and, 
frankly, challenged by what he said. 
We have to do more, even in my judg-
ment, than the $13.6 billion. But as the 
junior Senator from Missouri should 
know—I hope he knows this—since the 
beginning of this administration, just 
on the military assistance, we have 
provided $2.6 billion. So more than $2.5 
billion dollars just in military assist-
ance, but the bulk of that is in that 
spending bill that we passed a couple of 
weeks ago that has the $13.6 billion. 
Here is what the Washington Post 
says, and I will read the headline and 
the date, and then ask consent to enter 
it into the RECORD. Here is the head-
line: 
More than two dozen Senate Republicans 
demand Biden do more for Ukraine after vot-
ing against $13.6 billion for Ukraine. 
Mr. President, dated March 17, 2022, a 
story by Mariana Alfaro and Eugene 
Scott, I ask unanimous consent that 
this article be printed in the RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[March 17, 2022] 
MORE THAN TWO DOZEN SENATE REPUBLICANS 
DEMAND
BIDEN
DO
MORE
FOR
UKRAINE 
AFTER VOTING AGAINST $13.6 BILLION FOR 
UKRAINE 
(By Mariana Alfaro and Eugene Scott) 
THIRTY-ONE SENATE REPUBLICANS VOTED LAST 
WEEK AGAINST THE $1.5 TRILLION SPENDING 
BILL
TO
FUND
THE
GOVERNMENT, INCREASE 
U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING AND PROVIDE HUMAN-
ITARIAN
AND
MILITARY
ASSISTANCE
TO 
UKRAINE. IN RECENT DAYS, MANY OF THEM 
HAVE
CLAMORED
FOR
MORE
WEAPONS
AND 
AID. 
More than two dozen Senate Republicans 
are demanding that President Biden do more 
to aid war-torn Ukraine and arm its forces 
against Russia’s brutal assault, after voting 
last week against $13.6 billion in military 
and humanitarian assistance for Ukraine. 
Consider Sen. Rick Scott (R–Fla.), who heard 
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky’s 
emotional plea in a virtual address to Con-
gress on Wednesday for more weapons and a 
no-fly zone over Ukraine. 
‘‘President Biden needs to make a decision 
TODAY: either give Ukraine access to the 
planes and antiaircraft defense systems it 
needs to defend itself, or enforce a no-fly 
zone to close Ukrainian skies to Russian at-
tacks,’’ Scott said in a statement. ‘‘If Presi-
dent Biden does not do this NOW, President 
Biden will show himself to be absolutely 
heartless and ignorant of the deaths of inno-
cent Ukrainian children and families.’’ 
Last week, Scott was one of 31 Republicans 
to vote against a sweeping, $1.5 trillion 
spending bill to fund government agencies 
and departments through the remainder of 
the fiscal year, a bill that also included $13.6 
billion in assistance for Ukraine. Biden 
signed the bill into law Tuesday, saying the 
United States was ‘‘moving urgently to fur-
ther augment the support to the brave peo-
ple of Ukraine as they defend their country.’’ 
After casting a ‘‘no’’ vote, Scott assailed 
the overall spending bill as wasteful, arguing 
that it was filled with lawmakers’ pet 
projects. ‘‘It makes my blood boil,’’ Scott 
said last week. 
Democrats quickly condemned what they 
saw as glaring hypocrisy among the Repub-
licans who voted against the aid but were 
quick to criticize Biden as a commander in 
chief leading from behind in addressing 
Ukraine’s needs. ‘‘We should send more le-
thal aid to Ukraine which I voted against 
last week’ is making my brain melt,’’ 
tweeted Sen. Brian Schatz (D–Hawaii). 
The Russian invasion of Ukraine has high-
lighted divisions in the Republican Party on 
U.S. involvement overseas and the standing 
of the NATO alliance. For decades, during 
the presidencies of Ronald Reagan, George 
H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, the GOP em-
braced a hawkish view, with robust military 
spending and certainty about coming to the 
aid of allies. 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s 
‘‘America 
First’’ outlook and efforts to undermine 
NATO, including questioning why the mili-
tary alliance even existed, secured a foothold 
in the GOP, reflected in the response of Rep. 
Marjorie Taylor Greene (R–Ga.) to Ukraine. 
In a video Wednesday, Greene blamed both 
Russia and Ukraine, and warned against U.S. 
intervention. Biden has said repeatedly that 
he would not send U.S. troops to fight. 
Potential 2024 presidential candidates such 
as Scott have been highly critical of Biden, 
who also announced Wednesday that the 
Pentagon was sending nearly $1 billion in 
military equipment to Ukraine, including 800 
Stinger antiaircraft systems, 100 drones, 
25,000 helmets and more than 20 million 
rounds of small-arms ammunition and gre-
nade launcher and mortar rounds. 
In early February, Sen. Josh Hawley (R– 
Mo.), another possible White House can-
didate, sent a letter to Secretary of State 
Antony Blinken suggesting that the United 
States would be worse off if Ukraine were ad-
mitted to NATO, the military alliance of 30 
mainly Western countries—including the 
United States—bound by a mutual defense 
treaty, and argued that the United States 
should instead focus on countering China. 
Hawley, who voted against the spending 
bill with billions for Ukraine, said Wednes-
day that Biden needs to ‘‘step up’’ and send 
MiG jet fighters and other weapons to 
Ukraine, accusing the administration of 
‘‘dragging its feet.’’ 
The Pentagon has rebuffed Poland’s offer 
to send MiG fighter jets to Ukraine amid 
fears of further escalation involving a NATO 
country. 
In a statement Thursday, Hawley said, 
‘‘Aid for Ukraine should not be held hostage 
to the Democrats’ pet projects and I did not 
support the massive $1.5 trillion omnibus 
spending bill stuffed with billions in ear-
marks.’’ 
Sen. Ben Sasse (R–Neb.), a member of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee who also 
voted against the spending bill, told MSNBC 
on Thursday that the United States ‘‘can do 
more’’ for Ukraine. 
‘‘There were all sorts of particular ways 
where the administration yesterday said a 
lot of the right things, but just because the 
pen was in President Biden’s hand yesterday 
doesn’t mean that weapons are in Zelensky’s 
hands today. And at every point we’re too 
slow, and it feels like a huge part of the ad-
ministration’s audience is internal lawyers, 
and they do these offensive and defensive 
legal-hairsplitting arguments,’’ Sasse said. 
On the Senate floor Thursday, Sasse ar-
gued that the spending bill wasn’t ‘‘really 
about Ukrainian aid,’’ but a ‘‘whole bunch of 
schlock.’’ 
‘‘Ukrainian aid was a little bit of sugar on 
the larger medicine of a $1.5 trillion bill that 
nobody would actually want to go home and 
to defend to the voters, and to the taxpayers 
of America, as well thought out,’’ he said. 
Sen. Chris Murphy (D–Conn.) countered 
that the only way to deliver aid to Ukraine

April 7, 2022 
and massive legislation is through com-
promise. 
‘‘Inside every piece of legislation are ele-
ments that many of us disagree with,’’ Mur-
phy said. ‘‘Inside that budget that you voted 
against are all sorts of things that I disagree 
with. But in the end, in order to govern the 
country, you have to be able to find a path 
to compromise.’’ 
Schatz, in an interview with The Wash-
ington Post after the exchange between 
Sasse and Murphy, said the vote in favor of 
the aid was an ‘‘easy’’ one. 
‘‘It’s very simple: If you don’t vote for the 
thing, you’re not for the thing,’’ Schatz said. 
‘‘That is literally our job, to decide whether 
we are for or against things as a binary ques-
tion.’’ 
‘‘So you don’t get to say: ‘Even though I 
voted against Ukraine aid, that I’m actually 
for it, and here’s my explanation,’ ’’ Schatz 
added, arguing that Republicans were trying 
to have it both ways by maintaining their fi-
delity to Trump—who has praised Russian 
President 
Vladimir 
Putin—and 
become 
‘‘Zelensky fans’’ at the same time. 
‘‘They voted to exonerate Trump for this 
specific reason, which was to withhold aid 
from Zelensky, and here they are again, op-
posing aid to Zelensky,’’ Schatz said. ‘‘So 
now they’re doing it twice. They’re still act-
ing as if they’re defenders of Western-style 
democracy.’’ 
The day before voting against the bill, Sen. 
Tom Cotton (R–Ark.), another possible presi-
dential candidate, posted on Twitter about 
the need to come to Ukraine’s aid. ‘‘Helping 
Ukraine defend itself against a ruthless dic-
tator is in our best interest,’’ he tweeted. 
Sen. Kevin Cramer (R–N.D.) tweeted a clip 
declaring 
the 
importance 
of 
assisting 
Ukraine. ‘‘It’s not much of a deterrent when 
the assistance you provide comes after the 
invasion,’’ he wrote. ‘‘We need to have Presi-
dent Zelensky’s back and expedite aid to 
Ukraine.’’ 
Hours later, Cramer voted against the 
spending bill. Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R– 
La.) tweeted a clip the day he voted against 
the bill of him speaking to the need to give 
Ukraine more aircraft. 
‘‘The 
Ukrainian 
people 
and 
President 
Zelensky are fighting well above their 
weight, but they need planes,’’ he said on 
Fox News. ‘‘He made that very clear to us on 
the phone Saturday.’’ 
‘‘Give the man his planes,’’ Kennedy added. 
Sen. Mitt Romney (R–Utah), the GOP’s 
2012 
presidential 
nominee, 
was 
widely 
mocked when he called Russia the ‘‘number 
one geopolitical foe’’ during a debate with 
President Barack Obama, a remark that in 
hindsight seems prescient. 
Romney, 
like 
other 
Republicans, 
has 
pressed Biden to send more aid to Ukraine. 
He also voted against the spending bill with 
billions for the country. Romney said that 
while he ‘‘strongly’’ supports providing aid 
to Ukrainians, he ‘‘ultimately could not sup-
port the rest of this bloated spending bill for 
the aforementioned reasons.’’ 
‘‘Forcing us to swallow the bad to get the 
good is concerning, unsustainable, and no 
way to govern over the long term,’’ he said. 
In a statement to The Post Thursday, 
Romney added that he has ‘‘and will strong-
ly support aid for Ukraine’’ and that he 
‘‘called for a stand-alone bill to get a vote on 
Monday, four days sooner than the omnibus 
did.’’ 
Romney and Sen. Joni Ernst (R–Iowa) are 
separately leading an effort with 40 of their 
Senate GOP colleagues to urge Biden to 
work with Poland and other NATO allies to 
expedite the transfer of aircraft and air-de-
fense systems to Ukraine. Of those 40 Repub-
licans, 25 voted against the aid package. 
While increasing domestic spending and 
keeping the government open, the sweeping 
spending bill also increased spending for the 
U.S. military by 5.6 percent, totaling $762 
billion. The bill includes a 2.7 percent pay in-
crease for all active-duty troops. Several Re-
publicans were critical of Ukraine in 2017, 
when Trump began spreading a conspiracy 
theory that it was Ukraine—and not Rus-
sia—that interfered with the 2016 election. 
Two years later, Democrats accused Trump 
of leveraging military assistance and an Oval 
Office meeting with Zelensky in exchange 
for investigations of Biden and his son Hun-
ter Biden, and the debunked theory alleging 
Ukrainian interference in the election. 
The House impeached Trump; the Senate 
acquitted him on charges that he abused the 
powers of his office and obstructed Congress. 
All the Senate Republicans except Romney 
voted for acquittal. 
Sen. Mazie Hirono (D–Hawaii) told The 
Post on Thursday that Republican law-
makers arguing for more aid for Ukraine 
days after voting against a bill to provide as-
sistance is ‘‘the height of hypocrisy.’’ 
‘‘Some of them will find every way they 
can to criticize Joe Biden,’’ Hirono said. 
‘‘And I think it’s more than ironic that the 
president that they continue to support 
withheld aid to Ukraine for political pur-
poses.’’ 
As several of these Republicans who voted 
against the bill criticized Biden, one Repub-
lican pointed to the disconnect. 
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R–S.C.), who 
voted for the bill, advised his party to stop 
sending ‘‘mixed messages’’ and lamented 
that the spending bill with nearly $14 billion 
for Ukraine didn’t pass the Senate 100–0, ac-
cording to Politico. 
And on Thursday, Zelensky’s chief of staff, 
Andriy Yermak, tweeted that the was 
‘‘grateful’’ to the United States, which he de-
scribed as Ukraine’s ‘‘reliable partner.’’ 
‘‘[Biden] does more for [Ukraine] than any of 
his predecessors,’’ Yermak tweeted. 
Mr. CASEY. Here is the subheadline: 
Thirty-one Senate Republicans voted last 
week against the $1.5 trillion spending bill to 
fund the government, increase U.S. defense 
spending and provide humanitarian and mili-
tary assistance to Ukraine. In recent days, 
many of them have clamored for more weap-
ons and aid. 
And it goes on from there, and I am 
not going to read all of it, obviously, 
but it chronicles the hypocrisy that we 
just heard here today and that we have 
heard for days now and weeks now, 
criticizing the President when they 
voted against all the money—so all the 
money from the $13.6 billion that will 
go to pay for the Javelin missiles that 
are taking out Russian tanks every day 
and have for weeks—every penny of 
that out of the $13.6. You could prob-
ably cut it in half in terms of what the 
military assistance will be. 
So let’s say, for sake of argument, 
probably half of that, $6 or $7 billion, 
but whatever the exact number is, that 
money is going to help pay for a lot 
more Javelin missiles that have been 
so effective. The Stinger systems that 
they have used, the antiaircraft sys-
tems, they are all going to be paid for. 
The ammunition and the body armor 
and all of the other assistance that we 
are providing is going to be made pos-
sible because most of the Senate—50 
Democrats and just 19 Republicans, but 
we are grateful for their support— 
voted for the money. 
So if you have a criticism about the 
administration’s policy, you are cer-
tainly entitled to criticize the adminis-
tration, but I think you lose your right 
to criticize the administration on mili-
tary assistance and what we are doing 
or not doing on military assistance 
when you just voted against all the 
money—all the money. And yet they do 
it over and over again, as if no one is 
watching. 
Well, I think the American people get 
it, and I think they know the dif-
ference between someone who can jus-
tifiably criticize any administration on 
foreign policy or defense policy or any-
thing else. But I think you should 
admit on the record that you didn’t 
vote for the money. Don’t throw sand 
in the eyes of the people. Admit on the 
record that you didn’t vote for the 
money, and then lodge your criticism. 
But, of course, he didn’t do that and so 
many who voted the wrong way. 
Now, the Washington Post also notes 
in this article that, obviously, it was a 
spending bill that will allow us to fund 
the government. We could talk about 
that, whether you support funding the 
government. But here is a point that 
was made in the article that I think a 
lot of people may have missed: It is 
that this funding bill also paid for a 
pay increase for our troops. 
U.S. servicemembers got a pay in-
crease in this bill, and yet you would 
never know that by listening to some 
of the folks who voted the wrong way 
on the bill. You would think that that 
wasn’t part of this legislation. 
So I think a lot of Americans prob-
ably expect that when you are making 
an argument against an administra-
tion, you have the right to do that, but 
I think it would be a lot more truthful 
if you were clear about where you 
voted on the biggest Ukraine spending 
measure in recent history, likely not 
just the biggest ever for Ukraine but 
the biggest ever for a lot of countries 
that we help. 
So I hope that people across this 
Chamber and across the country will 
make note of that contradiction, be-
cause when you voted against those 
dollars for Ukraine, you were voting 
against not only the people of Ukraine 
and their ability to fight this war and 
obviously the soldiers in the field, but 
you were voting against that humani-
tarian support, as well, that will pro-
vide food and medical care and so much 
else. 
Now, I am in no way satisfied that we 
have done enough. We have got to do a 
lot more. We have got to provide, in 
my judgment, a river, an ever-rushing 
stream of weapons—as many weapons 
as it takes to defeat Vladimir Putin. 
So we are going to have more de-
bates, and Senators will have more op-
portunities to vote the right way when 
it comes to supporting the people of 
Ukraine. But I think it would be better 
for the debate if folks would mention 
how they voted, that 
they 
voted 
against the Ukraine money, that they 
voted against the pay raise for the 
troops, and they voted against a lot of 
other provisions.

But to come on to the Senate floor 
and to criticize the President on mili-
tary assistance, that is the height of 
hypocrisy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa is recognized. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. The majority leader 
is going to come to the floor, and I will 
yield the floor for him when he comes 
here, but I would like to yield the floor 
without losing the right to the floor. 
JUDICIARY COMMITTEE STAFF 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
would like to thank my staff who 
worked on this nomination. 
First, I would like to recognize the 
contributions of Kolan Davis, my chief 
counsel and staff director. Kolan was 
assisted by Brendan Chestnut, my chief 
counsel for nominations. 
The staff in the nominations unit 
also worked incredibly hard on this 
nomination. 
They 
include 
Lauren 
Mehler, Gabi Kenny, Vetan Kapoor, 
and Raija Munk. 
The permanent nominations team re-
ceived some reinforcements for this 
Supreme 
Court 
nomination. 
Annie 
Croslow joined my staff to lead the 
team of special counsels assisting on 
this nomination. That team includes 
Annika Boone, Kyle Cole, Isaac Fong, 
Jenna Lorence, Daniel Morales, and 
Luke Zaro. This team scoured Judge 
Jackson’s record. They spent countless 
hours 
reviewing 
her 
opinions, 
her 
speeches, and pulling filings and tran-
scripts for her cases. Their exhaustive 
review helped the Republicans on the 
committee prepare for her confirma-
tion process. 
I also want to thank the communica-
tions director, Taylor Foy, as well as 
the deputy communications director, 
George Hartmann, Aaron Britt, Annie 
Richardson, Jennifer Heins, and Megan 
Behrends also contributed to the com-
munications effort. 
Other staff also helped review and 
prepare for the nomination, including 
Dave Lewen, Lauren Stimpert, Rachel 
Wright, Erin Creegan, Tianna Torrejon, 
and Chesney Mallory, as well as law 
clerks Carly Hviding, Luke Bunting, 
and Noelle Daniel. 
Finally, I want to thank the rest of 
my Judiciary Committee staff for their 
continued work during this process and 
also thank my deputy staff director, 
Rita Lari, for her advice and leader-
ship.

UKRAINE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
lots of pundits are trying to get into 
President Putin’s head and looking for 
some so-called off-ramp. Now, I am not 
a pundit, and I do not pretend to be 
able to read Putin’s mind. However, I 
do listen carefully to those closest to 
Russia who have better insights than 
the American pundits, academics, and 
foreign policy theorists. 
I happen to be cochair of the Senate 
Baltic Freedom Caucus, so I interact 
regularly with Estonians, Latvians, 
and Lithuanians—three countries that 
in 1940 the Soviet Union absorbed into 
it, and then since about 1990, they have 
been independent of Russia. So you can 
see these countries are historically 
Western in every sense except geog-
raphy, but they have had a long and 
often painful exposure to the Russian- 
Soviet-KGB way of thinking. 
Our Baltic friends can help others in 
the West who cannot seem to fathom 
what is going through Putin’s mind. 
The fact that we cannot understand 
Putin’s mindset is because he doesn’t 
think like modern Western leaders. 
Now, this is important insight from 
my Baltic contacts. Putin is stuck in 
the 17th and 18th centuries. Now, you 
know I like history, so this is some-
thing that I can understand. Putin 
thinks like a czar expanding his em-
pire. He regrets the collapse of the So-
viet Union—not because of communist 
ideology but because it reconstituted 
the Russian empire. 
In foreign policy, it is easy to assume 
other countries are just like us. Ex-
perts don’t know what to make of an 
18th-century imperialist. 
Some observers have speculated that 
Putin has gone crazy because he does 
not seem to be acting rationally, but 
from the standpoint of someone who 
thinks Ukraine is not a real country, 
as Putin has said for decades, and who 
regrets the collapse of the ‘‘evil em-
pire,’’ he is acting rationally. 
Our Baltic allies have been warning 
the West that Putin is an aggressor 
since well before the current invasion 
of Ukraine, before the 2014 invasion of 
neutral Ukraine, before the disastrous 
Obama administration ‘‘reset’’ of rela-
tions with Russia, and before the 2008 
invasion of Georgia. 
The Baltics have often been dis-
missed as hysterical or Russophobic or 
at least exaggerating when they warn 
about Russia. Well, the world has 
awakened to the fact that the Baltics 
were right all along. 
We should have armed Ukraine to the 
teeth years ago. Putin only under-
stands strength. 
What 
lessons 
should 
have 
been 
learned from Putin’s pattern of aggres-
sion over the years? Putin only under-
stands strength, and weakness is pro-
vocative. 
During the Hungarian uprising of 
1956, when the Hungarian people were 
protesting to break free of Soviet con-
trol, the Eisenhower administration in 
this country paid lipservice to the aspi-
rations for freedom but was secretly 
obsessed with not provoking the Sovi-
ets. 
Eisenhower’s Secretary of State, Dul-
les, made his speech in Dallas, TX, 
where he said this: 
The [United States] has no ulterior pur-
pose in desiring the independence of the sat-
ellite countries. . . . We do not look upon 
these nations as potential military allies. So 
you can see the expansion of NATO 
today proves how wrong Dulles was at 
that time. 
However, after the Dulles speech, he 
then cabled the U.S. Embassy in Mos-
cow, instructing that this be brought 
to the attention of the highest Soviet 
authorities. Any wonder why Hungary 
wasn’t freed at that time? 
The Estonian historian and also its 
former Prime Minister, Mart Laar, 
maintains that this message from Dul-
les was interpreted by Moscow as a 
carte blanche to intervene and the 
Americans would not stand in the way. 
That is why he titled the relevant 
chapter in his book on the rise and fall 
of communism in the region ‘‘The lost 
opportunity: 1956.’’ 
So what do our Baltic friends advise 
right now in the face of Putin’s threats 
to escalate if we supply Ukraine with 
fighter jets or other advanced weapons? 
Believe it or not, their advice is to 
relax. In other words, don’t overreact 
to Putin’s threats. 
We have a nuclear deterrent and 
Putin knows that. The more we show 
we are scared by his threats, the harder 
he will push. And we absolutely need to 
stop declaring what we will not do in 
regard to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. 
That just seems to embolden Putin to 
push harder. 
The failure to push back the previous 
Russian aggressions—and that is not 
just a Biden problem. That is a prob-
lem of both Republican and Demo-
cratic Presidents before. Also the fail-
ure to enforce previous redlines in 
Syria and the perception of weakness 
from the Afghanistan pullout debacle— 
those three things are at least part of 
the reason for what is going on in 
Ukraine. 
I hope President Biden has picked up 
on this as well. 
Now is the time to redouble our ef-
forts to reinforce Ukraine. Putin ap-
pears to have accepted that he cannot 
conquer all of Ukraine, but he is very 
definitely repositioning his forces to 
take as big of a chunk of the country 
as he can. 
Ukraine must win this war—on to 
victory. Anything short of a Ukraine 
victory is an invitation for further 
Russian aggression elsewhere and, who 
knows, maybe even encouraging China. 
We have got to stop the finger-point-
ing. We have got to stop the excuses, 
and we have got to get Ukraine air de-
fenses, drones, and anything else to 
shift the balance. 
To date, the United States and our 
allies have supplied the heroic Ukrain-
ian military with the kinds of weapons 
that have allowed them to hang on 
while their cities are shelled and civil-
ians are massacred. 
The battle for Kyiv may have been 
won, but the battle for the east is only 
going to intensify. Unless we tip the 
balance, this could go on for a long, 
long time. 
We have seen how brutal the Russian 
occupation has been in just 1 month. 
Imagine months and months of this in 
eastern Ukraine. 
I have a bill with my friend Senator 
DURBIN to guarantee that the United 
States will backfill certain critical 
weapons transferred to Ukraine by our 
eastern flank of NATO allies. Many 
NATO countries have been very gen-
erous in handing over their weapons to 
Ukraine. This is leaving a security gap 
in those very countries. But they know 
that if Putin isn’t stopped in Ukraine, 
then those countries are at greater 
risk. As Estonian Prime Minister Kaja 
Kallas says, Putin cannot even think 
he has won or his appetite will only 
grow. 
Some of our NATO allies also have 
air defense systems and drones that 
could make a big difference in Ukraine. 
There are rumors of negotiations to 
supply items needed in Ukraine, pro-
vided there is agreement to acquire 
American replacements. My bill with 
Durbin would provide that assurance 
up front without the redtape that 
seems to be involved in almost every-
thing we do to help Ukraine. 
Putin has talked constantly about 
what he calls ‘‘demilitarization and 
denazification’’ as his justification for 
launching 
this 
brutal 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine. That phrase does not make 
much sense on its face, but, again, we 
have to keep in mind that Putin has an 
imperial mindset. 
No 
military 
analyst 
looking 
at 
Ukraine and Russia could possibly 
think that Ukraine posed any military 
threat to Russia. The Russian military 
dwarfs the Ukrainian one in manpower 
as well as equipment. In fact, it is clear 
that Putin and his military leaders un-
derestimated the fighting ability of the 
Ukrainians. 
The same is frankly true of NATO’s 
military power along Russia’s borders. 
What Putin means by ‘‘demilitarizing’’ 
is to shrink Ukraine’s military to the 
point that that country is indefensible. 
He wants Ukraine totally susceptible 
to Russian threats, meaning back with-
in Russia’s sphere of influence. 
Now, 
what 
about 
the 
term 
‘‘denazification’’? Ever since World 
War II, Soviet leaders routinely labeled 
those in the Soviet Republics who ex-
pressed a desire for independence that 
they were fascist or Nazi. It is pretty 
clear that Putin’s initial goal was to

eliminate Ukraine’s current govern-
ment, 
starting 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy. So despite being descended 
from 
Holocaust 
survivors, 
denazification 
starts, 
from 
Putin’s 
point of view, by eliminating a Jewish 
President, Zelenskyy. 
A recent article in a Russian state- 
run publication, RIA Novosti, con-
firmed that denazification means that 
the elected government must be elimi-
nated as well as the Ukrainian mili-
tary. But this article goes on to say: 
However, in addition to the top, a signifi-
cant part of the masses who are passive 
Nazis, accomplices of Nazism, are also 
guilty. They supported and indulged Nazi 
power. . . . Denazification will inevitably be 
de-Ukrainianization. 
This ought to be very chilling to all 
of us, especially in light of the mas-
sacre at Bucha that we saw on tele-
vision this week and other Ukrainian 
cities. 
That statement reminds me of this 
quote from Catherine the Great after 
she completed her takeover of an inde-
pendent Ukrainian state just 10 years 
before our own Declaration of Inde-
pendence: 
Every effort should be made to eradicate 
them and their age from memory. 
‘‘Them’’ meaning the Ukrainians. 
Stalin killed millions of Ukrainians 
by intentionally starving them to 
death with the same goal in the early 
1930s. 
Now, you know that Putin has 
praised Stalin and is now imitating 
Stalin. 
The U.N. Genocide Convention de-
fines genocide to mean ‘‘any of the fol-
lowing acts committed with intent to 
destroy, in whole or in part, a national, 
ethnical, racial, or religious group, as 
such: (a) Killing members of the group; 
(b) Causing serious bodily or mental 
harm to members of the group; (c) De-
liberately inflicting on the group con-
ditions of life calculated to bring about 
its physical destruction in whole or in 
part; (d) Imposing measures intended 
to prevent births within the group; (e) 
Forcibly transferring children of the 
group to another group.’’ 
That sure seems to fit with what we 
know about Putin and his occupation 
of Ukraine. 
There is one last lesson that we can 
learn from our Baltic friends. Despite 
the murder and deportation to Siberia 
of masses of Estonians, Latvians, and 
Lithuanians to suppress their national 
identity, there were 10 years of active 
guerilla warfare by bands of what they 
called Forest Brothers. In fact, resist-
ance never really ended until the Bal-
tic countries threw off Soviet rule. 
I will leave you with the first few 
lines of the Ukrainian national an-
them: 
The glory and freedom of Ukraine has not 
yet perished. 
Luck will still smile on us, brother-Ukrain-
ians. 
Our enemies will die, as the dew does in the 
sunshine, 
And we, too, brothers, we’ll live happily in 
our land. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING

The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to

CONFIRMATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. PADILLA. Madam President, I 
rise today to celebrate the confirma-
tion of now Justice Ketanji Brown 
Jackson as a Justice on the Supreme 
Court of the United States of America. 
It is an important moment for our 
country but also a special moment for 
me because Angela, my wife, and two 
of our sons are here visiting the Cap-
itol this week. They witnessed history 
in the making when we voted to con-
firm, just a few minutes ago, Justice 
Jackson. Angela and I take great joy in 
knowing that not just our three sons 
but young people across the country 
will see Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson 
as an example of the great heights that 
they, too, can achieve. 
For the very first time in our Na-
tion’s history, the Senate has con-
firmed a Black woman to the Supreme 
Court of the United States. For only 
the sixth time, we have confirmed a 
woman to the Supreme Court, and for 
the fourth time, we have confirmed a 
working mother. It is also the first 
time in 50 years that the Senate has 
confirmed a Justice with public defense 
experience. 
This nomination represents progress, 
and I am heartened that it was a bipar-
tisan majority of Senators who came 
together to make history today. I also 
know that this progress would not have 
been possible without someone who 
was brave enough to step ahead on her 
own; without someone willing to work 
twice as hard in order to be the first; 
without someone able to persevere no 
matter how challenging, how difficult, 
or how full of doubt her path ahead 
may sometimes be. 
It shouldn’t have been this hard. As 
you know, I am a member of the Judi-
ciary Committee, so I can attest that, 
when then-Judge Jackson came before 
the committee with an outstanding ju-
dicial record, with bipartisan acclaim, 
and historic qualifications, she came 
prepared. She did answer a whole range 
of important questions, and she was 
forthcoming. She was clear and gra-
cious. 
Many Senators took the opportunity 
to engage deeply on issues that will 
shape the future of our Nation—issues 
like the role of technology and innova-
tion, voting rights, Tribal sovereignty, 
and much, much more; but, sadly, as 
has been referenced, some of our col-
leagues chose to fill their time with 
hostility, bad faith, and misleading 
smears. 
They chose to hold Judge Jackson to 
a different standard than other Su-
preme Court nominees whom they 
themselves had previously supported. 
In the same breath as they tried to 
praise Judge Jackson’s character and 
qualifications, they denigrated her mo-
tives; they questioned her impartiality 
and made up excuse after excuse for 
why they couldn’t support her nomina-
tion. It was painful to watch, not just 
for me but for people across the coun-
try. 
Judge Jackson was in the spotlight 
for days, but she continually met dis-
respect with calm composure. It is an 
experience that is all too common for 
those with the audacity to break new 
ground. Judge Jackson was unfairly 
tested, but she persevered. 
I believe that Judge Jackson de-
served better than the treatment she 
received during the confirmation proc-
ess. When you see Senators cast aside 
their good faith in questioning nomi-
nees, the threat to the integrity of our 
justice system is very real, and the 
cynicism it breeds for our institutions 
is real. These are the issues that this 
Senate and that each Senator must 
confront. 
But, today, I want to—and I choose 
to—celebrate the historic achievement 
of this confirmation. 
Over the last few weeks, I have re-
ceived thousands of letters and emails 
and other messages, including on social 
media, from Californians who support 
Justice Jackson’s confirmation. The 
messages have come from people of all 
backgrounds and from every corner of 
my home State. I have heard from Cali-
fornians who admire the tenacity, the 
grace, and the integrity that Justice 
Jackson showed in committee. I have 
also gotten messages from so many 
Californians, young Californians, who 
see themselves in Justice Jackson’s 
story and from Californians who say 
that the Court and our country will be 
better because of her service. 
So, as we cast our historic votes, I 
celebrate the better America that we 
are building, wherein our courts better 
reflect and understand the diverse 
country that they serve. I celebrate the 
joy that Justice Jackson has brought 
to people across not just California but 
across the Nation. I celebrate the com-
mitment to equal rights and equal jus-
tice that she will bring to the Supreme 
Court; and I celebrate the inspiration 
that she provides to young people, es-
pecially young people of color, who will 
write the next chapter of our American 
story. 
When Judge Jackson introduced her-
self to the American people in the 
course of the confirmation hearing in 
the Judiciary Committee, she said that 
she stood on the shoulders of the civil 
rights icon and her personal hero, 
Judge Constance Baker Motley. For 
many in the next generation, their 
hero will be Justice Ketanji Brown 
Jackson. 
I have shared with others and want 
to share again today that this con-
firmation represents one more step to-
ward making our institutions and our 
courts more inclusive for all Ameri-
cans.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2076 
April 7, 2022 
So it is in that spirit that I ask unan-
imous consent to make a few addi-
tional remarks in Spanish. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. PADILLA. 
(English translation of the statement 
made in Spanish is as follows:) 
Today, we are celebrating a historic mo-
ment. We are celebrating the progress that 
we made to ensure that the Supreme Court 
better reflects our country. 
Judge Jackson is more than qualified and 
is going to bring important and necessary 
perspectives to the Supreme Court. Unfortu-
nately, she was attacked by Republicans dur-
ing her confirmation process; but to every 
attack, Judge Jackson responded with grace 
and patience. She showed the country that 
she will be an exceptional Supreme Court 
Justice, and she will keep being an inspira-
tion for the next generation. 
Madam President, Judge—now Jus-
tice—Jackson has earned her place on 
the Supreme Court. 
I will end by acknowledging that, 
while one person alone, sitting on a 
Court of nine equals, can’t single- 
handedly create faith in the institu-
tion, I have every confidence that Jus-
tice Jackson will strengthen the Su-
preme Court and help our country 
progress forward. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
CONFIRMATION OF KETANJI BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, an 
hour or so ago on the floor of the Sen-
ate was an amazing sight. It has been a 
long, long time since I have seen the 
Galleries full. COVID–19 kept us apart. 
I missed it. I didn’t realize how much 
until those full Galleries were here to 
witness the vote on the nomination of 
Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson to the 
Supreme Court. 
It was a time of great celebration for 
most Members of the Senate and I 
think for the Nation because we have 
achieved something which many doubt-
ed would occur. 
It has been 50 years since the first Af-
rican American—Thurgood Marshall— 
was appointed to be a member of the 
U.S. Supreme Court. It was another 50 
years for us to wait for the opportunity 
to put a person, a woman of color, on 
the Court. And we did it today. 
Soon, in the coming future, the 
President will be swearing in Judge, 
now-Justice Jackson. I am certain that 
she will be a credit to our Nation. She 
has already proven that in her lifetime 
of service. 
Many Members of the Senate, of 
course, were excited and happy about 
it. I was one of them. I want to thank 
my colleagues for their kind words, but 
I also want to acknowledge the obvi-
ous. 
All of the hard work that led up to 
this successful vote happened a lot be-
hind the scenes. There were members 
of our staff who worked long hours—20- 
hour days—to prepare for this and to be 
ready to handle the important Judici-
ary Committee hearings. I would like 
to acknowledge the staff members on 
both sides of the aisle who worked tire-
lessly on Judge Jackson’s nomination. 
I have got quite a team on my side, 
and I am very proud of them. I want to 
recognize the following individuals who 
played an important part in this his-
toric process: Pat Souders, my chief of 
staff; Joe Zogby, my Senate Judiciary 
Committee staff director; Dan Swan-
son, 
general 
counsel; 
Stephanie 
Trifone, deputy general counsel; Sally 
Brown-Shaklee, my deputy chief of 
staff; Maalik Simmons and Miriam 
Wheatley, my floor staff who are often 
sitting right in the back of this Cham-
ber; Claire Reuschel and Riley Foti, my 
schedulers; my press staff, including 
Emily Hampsten, my communications 
director; Jenna Valle-Riestra; Maddie 
Carlos; Theresa Bordenave; and Laura 
Keller, and many others on my Judici-
ary team, including Phil Brest, who 
was my chief nominations counsel—he 
worked so hard on this, and he is so 
good—Sarah Bauer, who was right by 
his side working every minute; and 
Gabe Kader, as well; Ziya Smallens, 
speechwriter; Joe Charlet; Vaishalee 
Yeldandi; 
Maggie 
Hopkins; 
Anna 
Shepard; David Adeleye; Eric Chung; 
Eliza Lehner; Samir Sheth; David 
McCallum; Mady Reno; Katya Kazmin; 
Rachel Martinez, Yashi Gunawardena; 
Doug Miller; Chastidy Burns; Nicole 
Walton; Lane Giardina; and many, 
many others. 
I also would like to recognize some 
members of Senator GRASSLEY’s staff. 
Now, 
he—for 
those 
who 
wouldn’t 
know—is my Republican counterpart. I 
chair a committee evenly divided—11 
to 11—and Senator GRASSLEY
is in 
charge of the Republican side. We have 
developed a strong friendship and trust 
over the years that really meant a lot 
during this process. 
I want to recognize Senator GRASS-
LEY’s staff members, in particular: 
Kolan Davis, his staff director of many 
years; Brendan Chestnut, his chief 
nominations 
counsel; 
and 
Lauren 
Mehler, his senior counsel for nomina-
tions. 
Our two staffs worked very well to-
gether in this process, and I really ap-
preciate that. I want to thank Senator 
GRASSLEY, again, for it. 
I want to thank the committee’s non-
designated staff, including Heather 
Vachon, Michelle Heller, Bryan Palm-
er, Kara Dubbs, Shannon Bartley, 
Chuck Papirmeister, and others. 
I want to also express my gratitude 
to the larger Senate community who 
played a part in Judge Jackson’s nomi-
nation process: the staff of the Archi-
tect of the Capitol, the Sergeant at 
Arms, and of course the men and 
women of the U.S. Capitol Police Force 
who were critical to the success of the 
hearing and markups for Judge Jack-
son’s nomination. More than 1,000 peo-
ple occupied the chairs in the back of 
the committee room in the 4 days of 
hearings. It was the largest gathering, 
largest crowd, short of the State of the 
Union Address, in modern memory on 
the Senate. And today’s Gallery at-
tendance, again, was something, a wel-
come change from the forlorn empty 
Chamber’s Galleries that we have come 
to be used to. 
I also want to thank and add the 
names of the Senate staff who were so 
instrumental in supporting the com-
mittee’s proceedings. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD a 
list of Senate staff who were instru-
mental in supporting the committee’s 
proceedings. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

TRANSGENDER RIGHTS 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I am 
one of the few parents of young chil-
dren in the Senate. But almost every 
one of us here is a parent, so you know 
that one of the most spectacular things 
your kid can do is to write you a letter. 
Sometimes—frankly, 
most 
of 
the 
time—when I have gotten those letters,

it is because my kid wants to protest 
something that I have done. I have got-
ten a few of those where my kids are so 
upset about a rule or a decision that we 
have made as parents, they sit down 
and they catalog their grievances on 
paper. 
Maybe if you are lucky, you get a 
nice letter. My in-laws have one still 
plastered up on their wall from their 
youngest daughter who wrote them a 
nice list when she was young about the 
things 
she 
appreciated. 
But 
those 
‘‘Dear Mommy’’ or ‘‘Dear Daddy’’ let-
ters, that is one of the rare joys of par-
enthood. 
On March 6, 2018, Patricia Verbeeck 
awoke to find one of those letters for 
her left by her child Eric. It was laying 
on the pillow of his bed. She picked it 
up, and she read it to herself. ‘‘Dear 
Mommy,’’ her child wrote. Maybe her 
eyes twinkled thinking of what sweet 
or funny thoughts might come next. 
But this is what the letter said: 
Dear Mommy, I am sorry to do this to you, 
but I have killed myself by jumping off the 
top floor, the 12th floor, of your building . . . 
at the nearest stair exit to the elevators on 
that floor. 
I felt I could no longer live my life as a lie, 
living as a boy, instead of the girl I knew I 
could become. I am sorry I lied to you. I was 
losing hope in the world and could not see 
my way out of the wrong body and I decided 
it was time for my life to end . . . 
As 
you 
might 
imagine, 
Patricia 
didn’t get beyond that first line. Upon 
reading it, she dropped the letter, and 
she ran straight to her balcony and 
below, she saw the vague outline of a 
body and police officers surrounding it. 
I follow President Trump’s family 
members on social media. I do it be-
cause I know how influential they are. 
I know how many Americans—good, 
decent Americans—admire them and 
listen to what they say. 
Lately, the posts from Trump’s fam-
ily members have just been of one 
theme: 
America 
should 
fear 
transgender children. The Trump fam-
ily and their network of supporters and 
sycophants have decided that Eric 
Verbeeck and other kids like them are 
the No. 1 problem facing America 
today. And over the past year, this 
crowd has orchestrated a relentless and 
unceasing campaign to marginalize, de-
monize, and bully kids whose gender 
identity is different from their biologi-
cal sex. 
This year alone, Republican State 
legislatures across the country have in-
troduced 150 bills to deny rights to 
transgender Americans. 
Today, the Alabama legislature in-
troduced 
legislation 
that 
is 
fast- 
tracked, from what I understand, to be-
come law that makes it a felony—a fel-
ony—for a doctor to provide healthcare 
to a transgender child. In Texas, the 
Governor directed his child welfare 
agency to investigate parents like Pa-
tricia who are simply determined to 
support their children if they help 
them 
secure 
the 
gender-affirming 
treatment they need. Criminalizing 
parents of transgender children is just 
around the corner in some States. 
In Congress, Trump’s allies spent 
more time talking about transgender 
kids than they spent talking about 
healthcare or taxes or education. Con-
gresswoman 
MARJORIE
TAYLOR 
GREENE—perhaps Trump’s best ally in 
the House—had a sign outside her of-
fice 
calling 
the 
experience 
of 
transpeople a ‘‘fiction’’ just to bully 
her hallway neighbor, Representative 
MARIE NEWMAN, who has a transgender 
daughter. 
And in the Supreme Court hearings 
here last month, at least one Senator 
used their time on the national stage 
to suggest that the entire idea of being 
transgender is a leftwing hoax. 
All across America, Republicans—not 
all Republicans but the Trump wing of 
the Republican Party has declared war 
against transgender kids, and these 
children have noticed. A recent survey 
of transgender youth showed that half 
of them—52 percent—had contemplated 
suicide over the last year. 
Just think about that for a second, 
my colleagues, half of all the kids who 
are transgender come to the conclusion 
at some point in their young lives that 
they would be better off dead than live 
in a world that believes they are 
threats to be marginalized or ex-
punged. That is a national crisis, and 
we need to talk, honestly and candidly, 
about what has led us to this moment. 
We need to start by acknowledging 
that this conversation is long overdue. 
This dialogue about transgender chil-
dren, it may feel new, but transgender 
kids aren’t, transgender adults aren’t. 
The only difference between today and, 
say, 50 years ago, is that today there is 
space for kids and adults to be open 
about who they truly are. 
We are all born with a biological sex. 
And centuries of tightly controlled 
constructs about what a man should be 
and what a man should act like and 
what a woman should be and what a 
woman should act like, they have sort-
ed human beings into personality and 
professional profiles based on that gen-
der. 
But there are many of us—this has 
been the case for human history—who 
don’t associate with the gender that bi-
ological chance ascribed to us. There 
are people who are assigned male at 
birth who feel, in their bones, that 
they are female. That is what Eric felt. 
That is what Eric knew. And there are 
people who are assigned female at 
birth, but know, they just know, that 
they are male. 
And there is nothing wrong with 
that. That process of figuring out 
which gender you identify with, it 
poses no threat to anyone. But we do 
have to acknowledge how hard it is, 
given those centuries of gender iden-
tity and stereotypes, for some Ameri-
cans to understand what a kid like Eric 
was going through. 
For Americans, for instance, who 
were born a male and feel like a male 
and who are surrounded by family and 
friends who associate with a gender 
that matches the sex they were born 
into, the whole notion of a boy becom-
ing a girl or a girl becoming a boy—I 
get it—that can be disconcerting. It 
can be difficult to understand. But I 
also know that this discomfort will 
pass as more Americans learn what I 
have learned. Transgender and non-
binary children aren’t any different 
than any other kids. 
You might not know a transgender or 
nonbinary kid, but, trust, me, you do. 
You know what these kids are like be-
cause they are no different than any 
other children. My son has transgender 
and 
nonbinary 
friends. 
He 
has 
nontransgender friends, but when they 
are all sitting around our kitchen after 
school, there is no difference between 
them in terms of how they act and how 
they talk, what they are like, what 
they like, what they don’t like. They 
are kids. They are just kids. 
And so here is my message to the 
adults with power who have decided to 
spend their days bullying these kids: 
Stop it. Grow up. So you are not ready 
to accept transgender people, fine. I 
hope you come around someday. But 
these kids threaten no one. They are 
hurting no one. 
And, well, there are important con-
versations we need to have about how 
we include transgender kids fully in 
sports. I could walk into a room of a 
thousand people in my State and ask 
how many of them have had a child 
lose a sporting event to a transgender 
girl and not a single hand would raise. 
Saving girls sports is not the reason 
why Donald Trump and MARJORIE TAY-
LOR GREENE and their whole political 
movement 
has 
made 
bullying 
transgender kids their top priority. No, 
it is their top priority because they 
know hate and fear of what some peo-
ple don’t understand has a habit of sell-
ing in this country. I wish that weren’t 
true, but it has always been true. 
There is always going to be a con-
stituency in America that will listen to 
an argument for why Black people or 
Mexicans or Muslims or gay people or 
transgender people are ruining Amer-
ica, why we should fear them. 
It is not true. It has never been true. 
But demagogues and their movements, 
they tend not to have actual ideas, 
things they are for. Demagogues nor-
mally just focus on what they hate. 
Let me say it again. Half of all 
transgender children in this country 
have thought to themselves, at some 
point, that they would be better off 
dead than live in a world where so 
many people fear them. That is heart-
breaking to know that we are doing 
that to these kids. 
Being a teenager today—I know; I 
have one—with social media and the 
pandemic, it is hard enough, but imag-
ine being a teenager who wakes up 
every day knowing that they aren’t the 
gender they were assigned by biology 
at birth. Imagine keeping your feelings 
about that secret for years, worried— 
worried—about what your parents or 
your friends might say. 
Imagine the anguish of a scared 12- 
year-old or 14-year-old sitting in bed

awake for hours each night trying to 
process all of that alone with no help. 
Imagine the courage it then takes for 
that kid to have the first conversation 
with a parent or a friend. And then 
layer on top of that some of the most 
powerful people in the world deciding 
to use their power not to cure disease 
or end poverty or hunger but instead to 
use their power to target those very 
scared, desperate kids and to use their 
powers to harass and bully and shame 
them. 
Imagine how small, how insecure, 
how weak a person must be to have all 
that power and to use it to bully chil-
dren. 
Seth Walsh was gay, not transgender, 
but his experience was not much dif-
ferent than Eric’s. Students at his 
school were systematic in their tar-
geting of him because of his sexual ori-
entation. They pushed him down the 
stairs. They kicked him until he was 
badly bruised. They screamed at him. 
They called him names. No doubt these 
bullies took direction and inspiration 
from adults who paved the way, who 
endorsed this kind of hateful behavior. 
One day, after one of these incidents, 
a frightened Seth called his mom and 
he said: ‘‘Mom, you have to come get 
me right now.’’ His mom could feel— 
hear the fear in his voice, and so she 
grabbed Seth’s little brother and they 
got in the car and they rushed to pick 
him up. His mom was so supportive. 
That afternoon they sat and they 
talked. 
Seth took a shower to calm himself 
down, and afterward he asked his mom 
for a pen and told her that he was 
going to go outside and play with the 
dogs. About 10 minutes later, his mom 
went outside to continue this conversa-
tion with her son, but it was too late. 
Seth had hung himself from a tree. The 
pen that he asked for was for his sui-
cide note. 
I tell you these stories because they 
are consequences of adults’ behavior. 
Donald Trump and MARJORIE TAYLOR 
GREENE and their ilk, they aren’t mur-
derers, but make no mistake, there is a 
direct through line from the hateful 
words and the policies of leaders and 
the misery that too many transgender, 
nonbinary, and gay kids are going 
through today. 
But I am also here to tell you that 
Trump and TAYLOR GREENE, others like 
them, they are not the majority. And I 
want to make sure that I finish by 
sending a message to transgender chil-
dren and adults that these hateful peo-
ple, this movement that is growing out 
there to try to target you, it is not 
going to win. We are going to build a 
community of love and protection for 
you. No matter how bad things may 
seem right now, they are going to get 
better. The world is going to get 
kinder. Adults are going to learn their 
lessons. And if you don’t have it now, 
as you are struggling with your iden-
tity, you will find a support structure 
that will nurture and support you. It is 
out there for you. You should be who 
you are. Don’t feel like you need to 
hide your true self just because of 
these idiot adults who feel big by bul-
lying people who are different from 
them. 
Be who you are and know that there 
are a whole lot of us who are going to 
work our tails off to support you, to 
love you, and to make sure that you 
get a chance to thrive—because in the 
long run, the bullies never win. They 
never do.

The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

lowing individual to serve as a member 
of the Afghanistan War Commission: 
Seth Jones of Virginia.

REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SE-
CRECY—TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 
117–2 
Mr. MURPHY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the injunction of secrecy be 
removed from the following treaty 
transmitted to the Senate on April 7, 
2022, by the President of the United 
States: the extradition treaty with the 
Republic of Albania, Treaty Document 
No. 117–2. I further ask that the treaty 
be considered as having been read the 
first time; that it be referred with ac-
companying papers to the Committee 
on Foreign Relations and ordered to be 
printed; and that the President’s mes-
sage be printed in the RECORD. 
THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The message of the President is as 
follows: 
To the Senate of the United States: 
With a view to receiving the advice 
and consent of the Senate to ratifica-
tion, I transmit herewith the Extra-
dition Treaty between the Government 
of the United States of America and 
the Government of the Republic of Al-
bania (the ‘‘Treaty’’), signed at Tirana 
on December 22, 2020. I also transmit, 
for the information of the Senate, the 
report of the Department of State with 
respect to the Treaty. 
The Treaty would replace the extra-
dition 
treaty 
between 
the 
United 
States and Albania, signed at Tirana 
on March 1, 1933. The Treaty follows 
generally the form and content of 
other extradition treaties recently con-
cluded by the United States. It would 
replace an outmoded list of extra-
ditable offenses with a modern ‘‘dual 
criminality’’ approach, which would 
enable extradition for such offenses as 
money 
laundering, 
cyber-related 
crimes, and other newer offenses not 
appearing on the list. The Treaty also 
contains a modernized ‘‘political of-
fense’’ clause and provides that extra-
dition shall not be refused based on the 
nationality of the person sought. Fi-
nally, the Treaty incorporates a series 
of procedural improvements to stream-
line and expedite the extradition proc-
ess. 
I recommend that the Senate give 
early and favorable consideration to 
the Treaty, and give its advice and con-
sent to ratification.

EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE 
SENATE 
THAT 
THE 
GOVERN-
MENT OF THE PEOPLE’S REPUB-
LIC OF CHINA SHOULD IMME-
DIATELY 
GUARANTEE 
THE 
SAFETY AND FREEDOM OF TEN-
NIS STAR PENG SHUAI 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the Senate 
proceed to the consideration of Cal-
endar No. 323, S. Res. 503. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the resolution by 
title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A resolution (S. Res. 503) expressing the 
sense of the Senate that the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China should imme-
diately guarantee the safety and freedom of 
tennis star Peng Shuai. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the resolution, 
which had been reported from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, with an 
amendment to strike all after the re-
solving clause and insert the part 
printed in italic, and with an amend-
ment to strike the preamble and insert 
the part printed in italic, as follows: 
Whereas, on November 2, 2021, 3-time Olym-
pian Peng Shuai went missing after she said in 
a since-deleted post on Chinese social media site 
Weibo that she had been sexually assaulted and 
forced into a sexual relationship with Zhang 
Gaoli, who was the senior Vice Premier of the 
State Council of the People’s Republic of China 
from 2013 to 2018; 
Whereas authorities of the People’s Republic 
of China imposed a media and internet blackout 
of discussions of Peng’s case; 
Whereas, on November 14, 2021, after Peng 
had not been seen or heard from for 12 days, 
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the 
Women’s Tennis Association Steve Simon re-
quested a ‘‘full, fair, and transparent’’ inves-
tigation into Peng’s allegations; 
Whereas the hashtag ‘‘#WhereIsPengShuai’’ 
trended across social media worldwide, with the 
exception of the People’s Republic of China 
where it was censored; 
Whereas, on November 17, 2021, the Women’s 
Tennis Association received a statement pur-
porting to be from Peng, recanting her abuse 
claim and saying ‘‘everything is fine’’; 
Whereas, in response, Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer of the Women’s Tennis Asso-
ciation Steve Simon said the statement ‘‘released 
today by Chinese state media concerning Peng 
Shuai only raises my concerns as to her safety 
and whereabouts’’; 
Whereas the International Olympic Committee 
said in a statement that it was ‘‘encouraged by 
assurances that she is safe’’; 
Whereas, on November 19 and 20, 2021, photos 
and videos of Peng appearing in her home, in a 
restaurant, and at a youth tennis event in Bei-
jing emerged on Twitter accounts affiliated with 
government-run media; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2021, White House 
Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the White House 
is ‘‘deeply concerned’’ over Peng’s disappear-
ance and seeks ‘‘independent and verifiable 
proof’’ of her location and condition; 
Whereas, on November 19, 2021, Liz Throssell, 
the spokesperson for the United Nations High 
Commissioner for Human Rights, told reporters 
‘‘. . . it would be important to have proof of her 
whereabouts and wellbeing, and we would urge 
that there be an investigation with full trans-
parency into her allegations of sexual assault’’; 
Whereas, on November 21, 2021, the Inter-
national Olympic Committee said in a statement 
that its President, Thomas Bach, had a 30- 
minute video call with Peng, joined by a Chi-
nese sports official and an official of the Inter-
national Olympic Committee; 
Whereas the statement said that, during the 
call, Peng appeared to be ‘‘doing fine’’ and ap-
peared ‘‘relaxed’’, and said she ‘‘would like to 
have her privacy respected’’; 
Whereas the International Olympic Committee 
did not explain how the video call with Peng 
had been organized, given the difficulties other 
concerned parties have had reaching her; 
Whereas, on November 30, 2021, in an inter-
view with CNN, International Olympic Com-
mittee official Dick Pound defended the han-
dling of the situation by the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China and said the ‘‘unan-
imous conclusion’’ by International Olympic 
Committee officials on the call is that Peng 
Shuai is ‘‘fine’’; 
Whereas the annual report of the Congres-
sional-Executive Commission on China for 2020 
finds that gender-based violence in China re-
mains a serious issue, and highly publicized 
cases of sexual assault continue to surface; 
Whereas, on December 1, 2021, the Women’s 
Tennis Association suspended all Women’s Ten-
nis Association tournaments in China and Hong 
Kong; 
Whereas Chairman and Chief Executive Offi-
cer of the Women’s Tennis Association Steve 
Simon stated, ‘‘In good conscience, I don’t see 
how I can ask our athletes to compete there 
when Peng Shuai is not allowed to communicate 
freely and has seemingly been pressured to con-
tradict her allegation of sexual assault. Given 
the current state of affairs, I am also greatly 
concerned about the risks that all of our players 
and staff could face if we were to hold events in 
China in 2022.’’; and 
Whereas the Government of the People’s Re-
public 
of 
China 
has 
repeatedly 
detained 
‘‘#MeToo’’ activists in China and censored on-
line and public discussion around sexual assault 
and harassment: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate 
that— 
(1) the case of Peng Shuai is directly related 
to broader international concerns around the 
freedom of speech and safety of athletes partici-
pating in the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Bei-
jing; 
(2) the failure of the International Olympic 
Committee to clearly and forcefully challenge 
the claims of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China concerning Peng’s safety raise 
questions about the ability and willingness of 
the International Olympic Committee to stand 
up for the human rights of athletes partici-
pating in the 2022 Olympic and Paralympic 
games in Beijing; 
(3) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China would help reduce concerns about athlete 
safety at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Bei-
jing by assuring Peng’s freedom and safety and 
investigating her allegations in a fair and trans-
parent manner; 
(4) the Government of the People’s Republic of 
China should immediately take steps to— 
(A) provide independent and verifiable proof 
of Peng’s whereabouts and that she is safe; 
(B) allow Peng to engage directly with the 
Women’s Tennis Association and the United Na-
tions to independently verify her safety and ex-
plain her absence from public life since making 
her allegation; 
(C) open an independent and transparent in-
vestigation into Peng’s allegations against 
former senior Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli; 
(D) publicly commit to hold sexual violence 
abusers accountable; 
(E) cease all censorship of reporting and dis-
cussions of Peng’s case; and 
(F) allow Peng to leave China if she so desires 
and prevent any retaliation against family mem-
bers remaining there; 
(5) by failing to clearly and forcefully chal-
lenge the Chinese Communist Party’s narrative, 
the International Olympic Committee has failed 
to uphold its own stated commitments with re-
gard to ‘‘[r]espect for international conventions 
on protecting human rights’’, as outlined in the 
Code of Ethics of the International Olympic 
Committee; 
(6) the conduct of the International Olympic 
Committee runs counter to efforts by the United 
States Government, human rights organizations, 
the Women’s Tennis Association, and other 
international bodies and individuals to secure 
Peng’s safety; and 
(7) in an effort to regain lost public con-
fidence, the International Olympic Committee 
should publicly call on the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China to undertake the ac-
tions called for in paragraph (4). 
That it is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) the case of Peng Shuai is directly related 
to broader international concerns around the 
freedom of speech and safety in China; 
(2) the failure of the International Olympic 
Committee to clearly and forcefully challenge 
the claims of the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China concerning Peng’s safety raises

until the Government of the People’s Republic of

in paragraph (3).

The 
preamble, 
as

The resolution, as amended, with its 
preamble, as amended, reads as follows: 
S. RES. 533 
Whereas 100 years ago, on March 20, 1922, 
following a 2-year conversion at Norfolk 
Naval Shipyard, the former USS Jupiter 
(Collier #3) was recommissioned as USS 
Langley (CV–1), the first aircraft carrier of 
the Navy; 
Whereas USS Langley began as an experi-
mental platform, laying the foundation for 
the future shipboard operations of aircraft; 
Whereas, in fleet exercises beginning in 
1924, the USS Langley, appropriately nick-
named the ‘‘Covered Wagon’’, demonstrated 
the potential of the aircraft carrier as an in-
valuable weapons system that would trans-
form how the Navy fought at sea; 
Whereas, for the past 100 years, aircraft 
carriers have furthered United States inter-
est in times of war and peace; 
Whereas, from the great naval battles in 
the Pacific Ocean during World War II to 
strike and close air support missions in the 
battlegrounds of the Korean Peninsula and 
Vietnam, the execution of joint force oper-
ations over the sands of the Middle East, and 
present-day deterrence in numerous loca-
tions around the world, aircraft carriers 
have proven time and again that they in-
valuable in supporting the strategic goals of 
the United States; 
Whereas, with an unequaled ability to pro-
vide warfighting capabilities across the full 
spectrum of conflict and to adapt in the face 
of ever-changing threats, aircraft carriers 
and their embarked air wings and associated 
strike groups are the foundation of United 
States maritime strategy; 
Whereas aircraft carriers enable the Armed 
Forces to carry out operations from inter-
national waters, often obviating the need to 
obtain flyover and land-based rights from 
other countries; 
Whereas Nimitz and Gerald R. Ford-class 
aircraft carriers are modern, mobile military 
bases each complete with an airfield, a hos-
pital, and a hardened communications sys-
tem from which the United States can strike 
at enemies, wherever and whenever it choos-
es; 
Whereas there are more than 2,450 compa-
nies in 48 States and more than 364 congres-
sional districts and more than 13,100 individ-
uals, who proudly contribute to the con-
struction and maintenance of these complex 
and technologically advanced ships; and 
Whereas countless members of the Armed 
Forces have served the United States aboard 
aircraft carriers in war, peace, and times of 
crisis: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes that aircraft carriers con-
tinue to be a cornerstone of the Navy and 
play a vital role in the defense of the United 
States; 
(2) acknowledges that, in a time of great 
power competition that the world has not 
seen for over 30 years, aircraft carriers will 
continue to be an absolutely vital strategic 
platform that the United States can wield to 
ensure security and stability throughout the 
world, now and well into the future; 
(3) in this 100th year since USS Langley 
(CV–1) was commissioned at Norfolk Naval 
Shipyard, recognizes the role aircraft car-
riers have played in securing peace for the 
United States and the continuing role air-
craft carriers will play in maintaining peace 
and security for the United States; and 
(4) celebrates the centennial of Navy air-
craft carriers.

MORNING BUSINESS 
RUSSIAN LANDMINES 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, among 
the many barbaric atrocities com-
mitted by Russian soldiers in Ukraine 
where civilian infrastructure including 
hospitals, 
schools, 
and 
apartment 
buildings have been repeatedly bombed 
and shelled and countless civilians 
have been summarily executed in the 
streets, the New York Times reports 
today that the Russians are using a 
new kind of landmine. 
This mine, called the POM–3, is in-
herently 
indiscriminate 
like 
other 
mines in that it cannot distinguish be-
tween a civilian and a combatant, and 
it is apparently equipped with a sensor 
that triggers the explosive when a per-
son approaches. With a kill radius of 50 
feet, it is even more deadly than a typ-
ical anti-personnel mine. And, unlike 
typical landmines, it cannot be dis-
armed by a human deminer because 
anyone who approaches it is likely to 
become a victim before reaching it. So 
it will be necessary to use robots to 
clear these mines, at great additional 
time and expense. As in other countries 
affected by armed conflict, it will be 
many years and almost certainly dec-
ades after the fighting ends, before the 
people of Ukraine can walk safely 
without 
fear 
of 
mines 
and 
other 
unexploded ordnance. 
Human beings seem to have an un-
limited capacity to devise new ways of 
destroying the lives of others. Land-
mines are especially insidious because 
they maim or kill whoever comes into 
contact with them, or, in the case of 
the POM–3, whosever’s footsteps it de-
tects. It could be anyone, including a 
young child. 
No matter how ‘‘sophisticated’’ the 
technology, mines are an exceedingly 
primitive weapon because they are de-
signed to be indiscriminate in an age of 
so-called precision munitions. 
Mines are the opposite. While land-
mines are so easy to make that it will 
never be possible to completely elimi-
nate them, in 1997, the international 
community took an historic step, 
thanks in large part to the leadership 
of former Canadian Foreign Minister 
Lloyd Axworthy and the tireless advo-
cacy of the International Campaign to 
Ban landmines. 
In December of that year, countries 
came together to sign the Convention 
on the Prohibition of the Use, Stock-
piling, Production, and Transfer of 
Anti-Personnel Mines and on their De-
struction, known informally as the Ot-
tawa Treaty or the Mine Ban Treaty. 
Today, the treaty has 164 states par-
ties. But one of the reasons anti-per-
sonnel mines have yet to be universally 
stigmatized is because key countries 
including Russia, China, India, Paki-
stan, and the United States have not 
joined the treaty. 
Of course, when one country joins a 
treaty, it does not guarantee that oth-
ers will. But the more countries that 
do, the harder it is for others to fail to 
do so, as they become the outliers, the 
pariahs. So if the United States, which 
has not used anti-personnel mines 
since 1991, were to join the treaty it 
would 
not 
guarantee 
that 
Russia 
would. But it would greatly enhance 
our credibility to call out their use of 
mines, their devastating effects on in-
nocent civilians, and the need to 
universalize the treaty. 
In 1994, President Clinton, at the 
United Nations, called for ridding the 
world of anti-personnel mines. He also 
directed the Pentagon to develop alter-
natives. They never did. While we can 
drive a robot on Mars 100 million miles 
away, our own military continues to 
stockpile landmines that are triggered 
by the victim. Whether a U.S. soldier 
or a child, our landmines, like Russian 
landmines, cannot tell the difference. 
If anything good can come of this 
catastrophic 
and 
senseless 
war 
in 
Ukraine, it would be for the inter-
national community to bring to justice 
those responsible for war crimes and 
for the United States to once and for 
all renounce the use of anti-personnel 
landmines. These are not weapons that 
belong in the arsenals of civilized na-
tions and certainly not in the arsenal 
of the most powerful, modern military 
on Earth. Let us be the country that 
not 
only 
denounces 
their 
use 
in 
Ukraine, but denounces and renounces 
their use everywhere. What a gift to 
the world that would be. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
New York Times article entitled ‘‘New 
Russian Land Mine Poses Special Risk 
in Ukraine’’ be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From The New York Times, April 6, 2022] 
NEW RUSSIAN LAND MINE POSES SPECIAL RISK 
IN UKRAINE 
(By John Ismay) 
WASHINGTON—Russian forces in Ukraine 
appear to be using a new type of weapon as 
they step up attacks on civilian targets: an 
advanced land mine equipped with sensors 
that can detect when people walk nearby. 
Ukrainian bomb technicians discovered the 
device, called the POM–3, last week near the 
eastern city of Kharkiv, according to Human 
Rights Watch, a leading human rights group, 
which has reviewed photos provided by 
Ukraine’s military. 
Older types of land mines typically explode 
when victims accidentally step on them or 
disturb attached tripwires. But the POM–3’s 
seismic sensor picks up on approaching foot-
steps and can effectively distinguish between 
humans and animals. 
Humanitarian deminers and groups that 
campaign against the use of land mines said 
the POM–3 would make future efforts to lo-
cate and destroy unexploded munitions in 
Ukraine vastly more complicated and dead-
lier. 
‘‘These create a threat that we don’t have 
a response for,’’ said James Cowan, who 
leads the HALO Trust, a British American 
charity that clears land mines and other ex-
plosive remnants of war to help countries re-
cover after conflicts. The group began re-
moving unexploded munitions from the 
Donbas region of eastern Ukraine in 2016, 
after 
Russian-backed 
separatists 
started 
fighting the Ukrainian government. 
‘‘We’ll need to find some donors to procure 
robotics that can allow us to deal with these 
threats at some distance,’’ Mr. Cowan added. 
The POM–3 is typically launched by a 
rocket and falls back to earth by parachute 
before sticking into the ground—where it 
waits, according to CAT–UXO, an online re-
source for military and civilian bomb techni-
cians. When the mine senses a person, it 
launches a small explosive warhead that det-
onates midair, producing fragments that are 
lethal up to about 50 feet away. 
Mr. Cowan, a retired British Army major 
general, said his staff of 430 Ukrainians 
clearing unexploded munitions in Donbas 
had been unable to continue working since 
Russia launched a full invasion of the coun-
try in late February, with many staff mem-
bers temporarily relocating in Ukraine. He 
anticipates that in the future, HALO’s oper-
ation across the country will require about 
2,500 workers, given that many areas outside 
Donbas 
are 
now 
contaminated 
with 
unexploded munitions as well. 
U.S. government officials have said Russia 
appears to be moving troops to consolidate 
its hold on Donetsk and Luhansk, which 
could mean that even more weapons like the 
POM–3 will be used in the war. 
‘‘The war is entering a static phase— 
trenches are being dug,’’ Mr. Cowan said. 
‘‘This is the time when I would expect the 
Russians to start using land mines on a mas-
sive basis.’’ 
HALO, which stands for Hazardous Area 
Life-Support Organization, has about 10,000 
employees around the world and is among 
the few international nonprofits that have 
remained in Afghanistan since the Taliban 
took control of Kabul, the capital, in Au-
gust. Mr. Cowan said the future cleanup in 
Ukraine would require roughly the same 
number of workers as HALO’s current oper-
ation in Afghanistan, which is recovering 
from decades of armed conflict. 
The POM–3 is just one new hazard among 
many that his organization expects to en-
counter, in addition to an untold number of 
rockets, bombs and artillery shells that 
failed to detonate on impact. Russia has also 
attacked Ukrainian arms depots, causing 
fires and explosions that typically fling hun-
dreds or even thousands of damaged muni-
tions into surrounding areas. 
Once widely used around the world, anti-
personnel land mines often kill and maim ci-
vilians long after hostilities have ceased. 
Ukraine is one of the 164 nations that have 
signed a 1997 treaty banning the use of anti-
personnel land mines and pledged to purge

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2085 
April 7, 2022 
The treaty does not prohibit the use of 
antitank land mines—which typically have a 
much larger explosive charge and are de-
signed to detonate only when a vehicle 
drives over or near them—nor does it address 
improvised explosive devices built to destroy 
vehicles. Videos posted on social media pur-
port to show both antitank mines and impro-
vised bomb attacks on Russian vehicles in 
Ukraine. 
Russia’s use of land mines was among the 
discussions at an event on Tuesday on Cap-
itol Hill for the United Nations’ inter-
national mine awareness day, which brought 
together groups that focus on the issue and 
lawmakers from Congress’s Unexploded Ord-
nance/Demining Caucus. 
‘‘Wars end, they stay,’’ Senator Patrick J. 
Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, said of land 
mines and unexploded munitions. ‘‘The tar-
gets are invariably civilians, and they are in 
places where you have a limited ability to 
provide lifesaving medical care.’’ 
‘‘Look at what’s happening in Ukraine— 
Russia is placing land mines in people’s 
homes, as well as children’s playgrounds and 
places where people go,’’ Mr. Leahy said. 
‘‘That’s using it as a weapon of terror.’’ 
f 
CONFIRMATION OF KETANJI 
BROWN JACKSON 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor because today has 
been a good day for our country. Ear-
lier today, the U.S. Senate voted to 
confirm Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Not only did this Chamber make his-
tory, we also bore witness—in a small 
but powerful way—to the bending of 
the moral arc towards justice. We real-
ized the promise of America: the prom-
ise that every child—regardless of their 
skin color, their ethnicity, or the ZIP 
code they are born into—can rise to 
their highest station in life. We ce-
mented our fundamental belief that, 
here in America, if you reach further 
and aim higher, anything is possible. 
I submit to my colleagues that the 
story of Judge Jackson is the story of 
our great Nation. Together with her 
impeccable credentials and evenhanded 
record, there was simply no reason to 
oppose the confirmation of such a tal-
ented, well-qualified, and fair-minded 
jurist. It is why I could not have been 
prouder to cast my vote, a vote on be-
half of New Jerseyans everywhere, to 
elevate her to the highest Court in the 
land. 
Judge Jackson has lived a life in the 
mold of the great strivers in our his-
tory. Her nomination alone was a tes-
tament to the progress—often deferred 
or denied—but nonetheless the progress 
we have achieved on our 246-year strug-
gle for a more perfect union. 
I could not be prouder that we etched 
it into stone and confirmed her to the 
Court, proving to women and girls ev-
erywhere that, if they work hard and 
reach for the stars, they too can be one 
of the nine guardians entrusted by the 
Constitution to ensure equal justice 
under law for all people. As we cele-
brate this historic moment, consider 
the senior quote ascribed to Judge 
Jackson in her high school yearbook: 
‘‘I want to go into law and eventually 
have a judicial appointment.’’ 
As we stand here, after extending her 
the judicial appointment of all judicial 
appointments, 
it 
may 
seem 
pre-
destined. It may have seemed like this 
day is the culmination of her destiny. 
But to hear Judge Jackson tell it her-
self, one realizes that, in fact, none of 
it was predetermined. None of it was 
fate. Simply put, it was the brilliance 
and grit of a young woman from South 
Florida—and the love of her family 
who surrounded her—that made this 
vote possible. As a student at Miami 
Palmetto Senior High School, Ms. 
Ketanji Brown was class president, 
chess club president, and a star on the 
powerhouse speech and debate team. 
Her 
parents, 
Ellery 
and 
Johnny 
Brown, were teachers who taught her 
the value of education as they rose to 
lead their peers as a principal and chief 
counsel 
for 
Miami-Dade 
County 
schools. In addition to public edu-
cation, her family is steeped in a law 
enforcement background. Her younger 
brother worked in undercover drug 
stings for the Baltimore Police Depart-
ment. One of her uncles was a detective 
attached to a sex crimes unit, while an-
other uncle was Miami’s chief of police. 
And yet it is the experience of seeing 
a third uncle, her Uncle Thomas, sen-
tenced to life in prison for a nonviolent 
cocaine offense, that rounds out her 
early understanding of our criminal 
justice system. In 2005, Judge Jackson 
would eventually set in motion a chain 
of events that ended with President 
Obama commuting her uncle’s sen-
tence. But before that could happen, 
before she joined major law firms and 
the Federal public defender’s office— 
before she served as Vice Chair of the 
U.S. Sentencing Commission and as a 
judge on the Federal bench—she was 
first a daughter, a sister, and a niece. 
And it is there, in the pages of Judge 
Jackson’s story, as a product of public 
schools who saw our country’s justice 
system up close, where we can find her 
judgment. It is there where we can find 
the reasons for my colleague, Senator 
BOOKER, to declare to her on national 
television: ‘‘You have earned this spot. 
You are worthy. You are a great Amer-
ican.’’ 
So much ink has been spilled about 
the historic nature of Judge Jackson’s 
nomination and now confirmation. She 
stood before the Senate as a nominee 
descendant from slaves who grew up 
listening to her parents’ stories of at-
tending segregated schools, a nominee 
who was once told by a guidance coun-
selor that she shouldn’t set her sights 
so high when applying to Harvard; a 
nominee who not only graduated as the 
second generation in her family to earn 
a college degree but who silenced 
naysayers and doubters alike by grad-
uating, with honors, from both Harvard 
College and Harvard Law School. 
Simply put, soon-to-be Justice Jack-
son belongs on the highest Court in the 
land. Her confirmation is a milestone 
in the grand tapestry of our country— 
not only because she has broken bar-
riers as the first African-American 
woman and the first to have served as 
a public defender, but rather, it is be-
cause she is supremely qualified to in-
terpret our Constitution and hear cases 
on their merit. When she is sworn in, 
Justice Jackson will have more experi-
ence as a trial court judge than any of 
her colleagues on the Court. In fact, 
she will be the second Justice ever to 
have experience at all three levels of 
our Federal judiciary. The first, a legal 
trailblazer in her own right, is Justice 
Sonia Sotomayor. 
It is therefore only fitting that, as I 
have thought about what this day 
means for our country, I am reminded 
of the parallels between this historic 
nomination and the historic nomina-
tion for Justice Sotomayor. Back then, 
in 2009, I said, ‘‘when she takes her seat 
on the United States Supreme Court, 
we will only need to look at the por-
trait of the justices to see how far 
we’ve come as a nation, who we really 
are as a people, and what our founders 
intended us to be.’’ 
Those words have never rung more 
true. A woman who, when the Constitu-
tion was written, would have counted 
in the eyes of the law as three-fifths of 
her fellow Americans, will now carry 
out justice for every single citizen who 
calls this Nation home. In the midst of 
disgusting attacks, racial dog whistles 
turned 
into 
foghorns, 
and 
gross 
mischaracterizations of her record, 
Judge Jackson maintained a calm de-
meanor throughout her nomination 
with almost superhuman poise. 
For my colleagues who opposed her 
nomination today, yet voted to con-
firm her to the Sentencing Commis-
sion, the district court, and to the ap-
peals court just last year, I leave them 
to iron out their double standards. But 
to all who rejoice in what is to come, 
when Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson 
will soon place her hand on the Bible 
and takes her solemn oath of office, I 
submit the following: 
More than ever before, the newest portrait 
of our nine Supreme Court justices will more 
clearly reflect who we are as a nation and 
what we stand for as a fair, just, and hopeful 
people. 
Unlike other nations, those united by 
a singular history, language, and cul-
ture, 
this 
nation—our 
Nation—is 
united by our diversity. It is evident in 
our national motto—the one stamped 
on every coin in our pocket and etched 
on the ceiling of our Capitol dome, E 
pluribus Unum: out of many one. And 
it is despite these differences that our 
country comes together as a vast melt-
ing pot, one forged in common values 
and an ideal of freedom that stands as 
a beacon to the world. 
As Judge Jackson takes her rightful 
place on the Supreme Court, the full 
realization of that ideal is closer than 
it has ever been. I know this for I have 
lived it—as Judge Jackson has lived 
it—and I feel it, as so many others in 
this country have felt it. I stand here, 
the son of Cuban refugees, the first in 
my family to attend college, and now, 
in a nation of 330 million, as one of 
only 100 Members of the U.S. Senate.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2086 
April 7, 2022 
It is indeed possible, my colleagues, 
to make our ancestors’ wildest dreams 
come true. 
And so, in closing, as I reflect on our 
vote earlier today, I can’t help but feel 
joy 
for 
my 
three 
granddaughters: 
Evangelina, Ofelia, and Olivia. Grant-
ed, they are still young; my oldest is 
barely out of pre-K. But each one of 
them will grow up knowing that, 
thanks to Justices like Sandra Day 
O’Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia 
Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and now 
Ketanji Brown Jackson, there isn’t a 
single thing they can’t accomplish. Let 
their dreams be our dreams today. Let 
every child in America look at their 
parents the way that Judge Jackson’s 
daughter looked at her during her con-
firmation hearing. 
Let there be no barriers to what is 
possible now that Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson has been confirmed to the Su-
preme Court.

BUDGETARY REVISIONS 
Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, S. 
Con. Res. 14, the fiscal year 2022 con-
gressional budget resolution, included 
authority in section 4004 to allow the 
chairman of the Committee on the 
Budget to adjust budget aggregates and 
committee allocations related to pro-
gram integrity, disaster relief, wildfire 
suppression, and veterans medical care 
funding. 
H.R. 2471, the Consolidated Appro-
priations Act, 2022, was enacted on 
March 15, 2022, and designates funding 
eligible for several of these adjust-
ments. Specifically, the bill provides 
$18.9 billion in budget authority for dis-
aster relief, $2.1 billion in budget au-
thority for program integrity activities 
to combat waste, fraud, and abuse, and 
$2.5 billion in budget authority to fight 
wildfires. Accordingly, I am adjusting 
the allocation to the Committee on Ap-
propriations and the spending aggre-
gates upward by these amounts and by 
the amount of outlays flowing there-
from. 
I ask unanimous consent that the ac-
companying tables, which provide de-
tails about the adjustment, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the

RECOGNIZING THE UNIVERSITY OF 
KANSAS 
MEN’S 
BASKETBALL 
TEAM 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. President, I am 
here today to talk about the extraor-
dinary accomplishments of the Univer-
sity of Kansas’s men’s basketball team. 
As the Nation saw on Monday night, 
KU beat the University of North Caro-
lina in the NCAA championship game, 
doing so in a historic fashion. 
The game started strong for the 
Jayhawks, taking an early 7–0 lead, but 
after some back and forth, North Caro-
lina seemingly broke the game open, 
ending the first half on an 18–3 run to 
go up 15. This deficit proved to be the 
largest ever overcome in an NCAA 
championship game. Going into the 
locker room, one could only imagine 
the sense of determination running 
through their minds. To win this game, 
they literally needed to pull off the 
biggest comeback in championship his-
tory in front of thousands of Kansas 
schoolchildren who look up to these 
young men as role models and student- 
athletes. How would they respond to 
this adversity? 
This question was answered as the 
referee handed the ball to a Tar Heel 
player and he looked up to see a Jay-
hawk in his face. The Jayhawks had a 
look of champions in their eyes. This 
game meant too much to everyone 
back home to give up. They stormed 
out of the locker room after inspira-
tional words from power forward David

S2087 
April 7, 2022 
McCormack, who started the half by 
giving Jayhawk fans back home some-
thing to cheer about with an electri-
fying, signature Jayhawk alley-oop. 
That play ignited a 20–6 run that 
brought the Jayhawks within 1 point. 
In true Kansas fashion, the Jayhawks 
ramped up their defense and began exe-
cuting the fundamentals of basketball 
Kansans learn in the front driveway 
and haymounds across the state. The 
game became a slugfest at that point 
with KU and North Carolina trading 
body blows back and forth until McCor-
mack sank one last shot to take the 
lead with just over a minute left. That 
shot ultimately sealed this KU team’s 
spot in the history books, brought KU 
its fourth NCAA national champion-
ship, and added to their lead as the 
winningest 
basketball 
program 
in 
NCAA history. 
For all of us who saw the game, it 
was clear that this championship lived 
up to the March Madness hype. Every 
Kansas basketball fan will remember 
this team for their ability to share the 
ball—or as Coach Self says, ‘‘to not let 
the ball stick.’’ Each game during this 
tournament seemed to have a different 
hero, but in this historic championship 
game, every player was a hero, and ev-
eryone’s contributions were necessary 
to win. This Jayhawk team made us all 
proud to be Kansans and delivered the 
greatest final game comeback ever. 
This group should relish in that fact, 
and I hope they also understand the 
enormity of the impact they have made 
with this title on so many fans, young 
and old alike. This team gave us hope 
and entertainment to distract us from 
a challenging past couple of years. 
They showed up every day and did 
their job. With this title, current KU 
students now have the experience of a 
lifetime, alumni and fans everywhere 
are connected forever through this one 
game, and every little girl and boy 
across Kansas has learned what hard 
work, teamwork, and a never-give-up 
attitude can accomplish. 
To the players graduating or heading 
to the draft,I wish you the best of suc-
cess and happiness in your future en-
deavors. To Coach Self and everyone 
else returning, I look forward to cur-
rent and future generations of Kansans 
cheering you on and celebrating the 
tradition of Kansas Basketball. ‘‘Rock 
Chalk!’’

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING RALPH BENNIE 
‘‘BEN’’ GRAHAM 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Mr. President, 
today I pay tribute to a distinguished 
lawyer, educator, and loving husband, 
father, and grandfather, Ralph Bennie 
‘‘Ben’’ Graham, Jr. Ben passed away on 
February 3, 2022. He leaves behind a 
powerful legacy of public service and 
dedication to Nevada’s criminal justice 
system and legal community. 
A Washington State native, Ben 
moved to Las Vegas in 1977 and worked 
as a prosecutor at the Clark County 
District Attorney’s Office. After 31 
years, Ben retired as chief deputy dis-
trict attorney. Throughout this time, 
Ben also represented the Nevada Dis-
trict Attorneys’ Association, the Ne-
vada Supreme Court, and the Adminis-
trative Office of the Courts in the Ne-
vada Legislature. In these roles, he lob-
bied to improve Nevada’s criminal laws 
and the State’s judicial system. Out-
side the courtroom, Ben taught courses 
on criminal justice at UNLV’s William 
S. Boyd School of Law and the Commu-
nity College of Southern Nevada, pro-
viding invaluable lessons for our Na-
tion’s next generation of lawyers. 
Throughout his career, Ben placed a 
great focus on the well-being of mem-
bers of Nevada’s legal community. In 
1986, he cofounded Lawyers Concerned 
for Lawyers, LCL, a confidential pro-
gram dedicated to helping members of 
the Nevada bar recover from substance 
abuse issues. In large part due to Ben’s 
mentorship, countless attorneys were 
able to obtain the assistance they 
needed to heal and move forward in 
their legal careers. Ben received nu-
merous awards in recognition of his 
service with the program. 
Nevada 
has 
benefited 
immensely 
from Ben’s commitment to the legal 
profession and community. Earlier this 
year, Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak 
recognized Ben’s contributions to the 
State by proclaiming February 17, 2022, 
as ‘‘a day in honor of Ben Graham.’’ 
Many in the Nevada Legislature re-
member Ben for his kindness and gen-
erosity, as exemplified through his fa-
mous chocolate chip cookies, which he 
annually 
gifted 
to 
colleagues 
and 
friends. Whether it was through his 
baking skills or charitable efforts, Ben 
improved the lives of those who knew 
him in the Silver State. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in re-
membering Ben for his significant im-
pact in Nevada. I celebrate Ben’s leg-
acy, and I extend my deepest condo-
lences to his wife, Elana; his children; 
grandchildren; and his family and 
friends during this difficult time.∑

TRIBUTE TO IDAHO PARALYMPIC 
ATHLETES 
∑ Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, along 
with my colleagues Senator Jim Risch 
and Representative MIKE SIMPSON, we 
congratulate Idaho-connected athletes 
Jake Adicoff, Dani Aravich, Jesse 
Keefe, and Josh Sweeney for their hard 
work and dedication in representing 
the United States at the 2022 Winter 
Paralympic Games. We also congratu-
late Sam Wood, Jake Adicoff’s friend 
and guide, on his important role in 
helping to earn three medals. 
Jake Adicoff, of Sun Valley, with 
Sam Wood, earned three medals in Nor-
dic skiing. They were instrumental in 
earning a gold medal in cross-country 
skiing for the U.S. 4x2.5-kilometer 
mixed relay team. They also earned 
two silver medals: one in long-distance 
cross-country skiing and one in sprint 
cross-country skiing. These were the 
third 
Paralympic 
games 
for 
Jake 
Adicoff, who also won a silver medal in 
the 2018 Winter Paralympic Games. 
Jake, now a four-time Paralympic 
medalist, graduated from Wood River 
High School before Bowdoin College 
and earned three medals in cross-coun-
try skiing in the 2021 World Champion-
ships: gold in middle-distance, silver in 
sprint, and bronze in long-distance. 
Boise native Dani Aravich competed 
in

second 
Paralympics. She finished eighth in the 
sprint cross-country, ninth in the mid-
dle-distance cross-country, 11th in the 
middle-distance biathlon, and 13th in 
the sprint biathlon. Dani graduated 
from Bishop Kelly High School in 
Boise, where she competed in cross- 
country running and track and field, 
and later she competed in these events 
at Butler University. 
In 
his 
Paralympics 
debut, 
Jesse 
Keefe, of Bellevue, competed in mul-
tiple Alpine skiing events. He placed 
ninth in the slalom, 15th in the super 
combined and giant slalom, and 22nd in 
downhill. Jesse, an avid outdoorsman 
who started skiing at age 2 and won his 
first race at age 3, placed first in the 
2021 U.S. National Championships in 
the giant slalom and slalom and placed 
third in the super-g. 
Retired U.S. Marine Corps Sgt. Josh 
Sweeney, who received a Purple Heart 
for his service in Afghanistan, com-
peted in Nordic skiing in his second 
Paralympics. He earned 16th in the 
long-distance cross-country, 19th in the 
sprint cross-country, and 24th in the 
middle-distance

Josh 
Sweeney is originally from Arizona and 
currently a Boise resident. He also 
earned a gold medal in the Paralympic 
Winter Games Sochi 2014 on the U.S. 
sled hockey team. From 2010–2013, he 
played on the San Antonio Rampage, a 
club sled hockey team made up en-
tirely of injured military athletes, and 
he played on the Dallas Stars club 
team in 2012, helping the Stars earn the 
2012 USA Hockey Sled Classic title. 
These athletes have pushed them-
selves remarkably far to compete in 
their respective events. Their examples 
of strength and triumph serve to in-
spire fellow Americans and people 
around the world. As we share in con-
gratulating them on their achieve-
ments, we are reminded of the remark-
able work it has taken each of them to 
reach their goals.∑

REMEMBERING BRETT THOMAS 
BOSS 
∑ Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, 
today I rise to recognize Albert Lea 
Fire Lieutenant Brett Thomas Boss, 
who passed away on February 5, 2022, 
at the age of 38 after a decade-long bat-
tle with stage 4 Ewing’s Sarcoma. 
Brett was born to Karen Boss on No-
vember 30, 1983, in Fargo, ND, and was 
later adopted by Todd Boss in 1992. 
From a young age, he demonstrated a 
clear drive to help others. In high

school, he participated in the local 
Fire Explorers program, which gave 
him both the skills to save lives in his 
community and a dedication to public 
service that guided his entire life. 
Brett’s 17-year firefighting career 
was nothing short of extraordinary. As 
an EMT, a hazmat technician, a fire in-
vestigator, and a firefighter instructor, 
he worked every day to keep the people 
of Albert Lea safe. Deputy Fire Chief 
Jeff Laskowske put it best: Brett was a 
true hero. 
Brett’s heroism only became clearer 
following his diagnosis. In the words of 
his loving family, he ‘‘fought cancer 
like a boss.’’ But Brett didn’t just fight 
for himself; following an alarming 
string of cancer cases among fire-
fighters in Albert Lea and Austin, he 
became a fierce advocate for his broth-
ers and sisters in the field. He played a 
key role in passing State legislation 
that secured funding for equipment to 
keep firefighters safe from carcinogens 
as well as a grant program for fire-
fighters living with cancer or heart dis-
ease. In 2018, we held an event together 
in support of legislation to create a na-
tional firefighter cancer registry, and 
days later, the President signed it into 
law. Brett also collaborated with the 
Firefighter Cancer Support Network, a 
group of firefighters that worked to 
provide resources, support, and edu-
cation to first responders in need. 
While Brett had a lot to be proud of 
in his career, he was even prouder of 
his 
family. 
He 
married 
his 
wife 
Danielle in 2006, and they went on to 
have two great kids, Jaelyn and Aiden. 
Brett could often be found cheering 
them on from the sidelines of sporting 
events or sharing with them his love of 
camping and fishing. 
While it is hard not to feel like 
Brett’s life was cut short, his legacy as 
an incredible firefighter, advocate, son, 
husband, and dad will last forever. He 
changed lives; he saved lives; and he 
made the world a better place.∑

WEST KENTUCKY VETERAN AND 
PATRIOT MUSUEM 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, stories of 
the past and the memorabilia and 
photos that often accompany them 
serve many important purposes in our 
culture. They can entertain us and pro-
voke laughter and joy. They can rein-
force the values that were important to 
our parents and grandparents. And 
they can teach difficult or even painful 
lessons from our history. The West 
Kentucky Veteran and Patriot Mu-
seum, now celebrating its 10th year, is 
a place where such stories can be dis-
covered. 
Founded by Sandy Hart, whose hus-
band, Ray, served in the U.S. Marine 
Corps and then went on to serve others 
as a pastor and foreign missionary, the 
museum houses an eclectic collection 
of personal objects, records, photo-
graphs, and narrative stories curated 
by Sandy and displayed in a red brick 
building in tiny Wickliffe, KY, which is 
located on the Mississippi River in far 
west Kentucky. While most of the do-
nated materials are from servicemem-
bers and their families in the Purchase 
Region of the Commonwealth, the visi-
tors—the men and women you are like-
ly to encounter when you stop by—are 
from all 50 States and beyond. Sandy 
loves to sit and talk to them and hear 
their stories, memories that are often 
stirred up as they wander through the 
displays in the museum. 
The vision for the West Kentucky 
Veteran and Patriot Museum was born 
when Sandy and others in the commu-
nity helped organize a convoy of over a 
dozen buses and 800 people to visit the 
World War II Memorial here in our Na-
tion’s Capital. This outpouring of in-
terest compelled Sandy to create a 
place that honored our veterans year- 
round—and not just those who served 
in the Second World War. 
I have visited with Sandy at the mu-
seum and watched her at work. She is 
tireless in her devotion to our veterans 
and in capturing and memorializing 
their stories so that we can learn from, 
laugh with, and be thankful for our 
men and women in uniform throughout 
our history.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING TOTAL EQUINE 
SERVICES 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, as ranking 
member of the Senate Committee on 
Small Business and Entrepreneurship, 
each week I recognize an outstanding 
Kentucky small business that exempli-
fies the American entrepreneurial spir-
it. This week, it is my privilege to rec-
ognize the small business, Total Equine 
Services of Falmouth, KY, as the Sen-
ate Small Business of the Week. 
The breeding, training, and of course 
racing of horses is an integral compo-
nent in the history and culture of our 
beautiful State. Many refer to Lex-
ington, KY, as the Horse Capital of the 
World, with their 1,200-acre Kentucky 
Horse Park in addition to the hundreds 
of horse farms operating in the area. 
Moreover, as of 2019, the Kentucky 
equine industry had an economic im-
pact of $3.4 billion and supplied 80,000 
direct and indirect jobs. Needless to 
say it is a leading industry in our 
state. For that reason I am delighted 
to honor a business so involved in that 
iconic industry, Total Equine Services, 
founded by Steve Thomas and his wife 
Patti Thomas. 
When it comes to raising Quarter 
Horses, Steve Thomas is a seasoned 
veteran. He and his wife founded Total 
Equine Services 15 years ago, but he 
has over 20 years’ experience caring for 
this breed under his belt. Together, 
they opened the business which ini-
tially offered only an arena where one 
could come and ride horses. They 
quickly expanded to provide a variety 
of services ranging from boarding, 
breeding, and training horses. In addi-
tion to that same arena, the Thomas’ 
constructed a Foaling Barn and 16 en-
closed stalls where owners can board 
their horses. The Thomas’ also offer 
nutrition and feed balancing services 
as well as a full tack shop where one 
can satisfy all their riding equipment 
needs. When it comes to the care and 
maintenance of horses, Total Equine 
Services offers a full package. 
With parents like Steve and Patti, it 
is no wonder that their son Jason 
Thomas grew up with a love for horses. 
He and his wife Nikki Thomas have 
joined the team at Total Equine Serv-
ices. Nikki was a natural addition to 
the team since, just like her in-laws, 
she has an extensive background in 
raising 
Quarter 
Horses. 
Moreover, 
Nikki is seasoned in training horses in 
the art of barrel racing and pole bend-
ing. Pole bending is a timed event 
where a rider must direct their horse in 
a speedy serpentine path around six 
poles arranged in a line. Meanwhile, 
barrel racing is an event where the 
horse and rider must attempt to run a 
cloverleaf pattern around preset bar-
rels in the fastest time possible. Need-
less to say, training of this sort re-
quires meticulous repetition and a 
keen eye for detail, which Nikki gladly 
brings to the arena. And with all the 
exercise and activity that their stock 
see, the Thomas’ make sure to keep 
their horses properly shod, with Jason 
being a certified farrier, a blacksmith 
that creates horseshoes, who keeps 
their fleet equipped with the proper 
horseshoes they need. 
The Thomas’ have developed a rep-
utation for covering every need a horse 
owner or rider might have, but they 
are also highly regarded for their 
breeding services. Their current stud 
horse, Redneck Jettin Down, has not 
only won several local shows, he has 
placed at national competitions held 
through the American Quarter Horse 
Association. In 2014, Redneck Jettin 
Down placed fourth at the All Amer-
ican Quarter Horse Congress, placed 
6th at the AQHA World show in Jr Pole 
Bending, and placed fifth at the North 
American Live Stock Show. It goes 
without saying that Redneck Jettin 
Down is an asset to Total Equine Serv-
ices. 
Whether they grew up in the heart of 
our big cities or in our smallest of 
towns, every Kentucky citizen has 
heard about the glamour of Keeneland 
and Churchill Downs. The equine in-
dustry plays an active part of the Ken-
tucky identity, and it is businesses like 
Total Equine Services that retain the 
respect and renown of that industry by 
taking special care of their breeds. 
Moreover, the Thomas’ and families 
like them play a vital role in our 
State’s economy, as they support com-
merce within our more rural commu-
nities. 
Congratulations 
to 
Steve, 
Patti, 
Jason, and Nikki Thomas and the rest 
of the team at Total Equine Services. I 
wish them the best of luck and look 
forward to watching their continued 
growth and success in Kentucky.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. BOOKER): 
S. 4025. A bill to require additional 
disclosures with respect to nominees to 
serve as chiefs of missions, and for 
other purposes; to the Committee on 
Foreign Relations. 
Mr. 
KAINE. 
Mr. 
President, 
the 
United States places special trust and 
confidence in the integrity, judgement, 
and abilities of those men and women 
chosen to represent the United States 
abroad as an Ambassador. The Con-
stitution balances the President’s need 
to have officials overseas able to exe-
cute U.S. foreign policy as directed by 
the President, with Congress’ interest 
in ensuring that these officials will 
serve honorably and ably in the posi-
tions for which they are nominated. 
Apart from the Foreign Service Act of 
1980, the Ambassador nomination proc-
ess has changed very little since our 
Nation was founded. However, it is fair 
to say that Presidents of all parties 
have on occasion appointed individuals 
Ambassadors whose profiles indicate 
political closeness with the President 
more than deep substantive experience 
in a particular foreign country. 
Historically, the majority of Ambas-
sadors are selected from the career 
ranks of the State Department. Rough-
ly 30 percent of Ambassadors are typi-
cally selected outside of those ranks, 
including from among political sup-
porters of the President. This is not 
categorically 
problematic—Ambas-
sadors who are not professional dip-
lomats have long served our country 
admirably, from Benjamin Franklin in 
France to former Senate Majority 
Leader Mike Mansfield in Japan. A for-
eign country may benefit from having 
a U.S. Ambassador who has a close re-
lationship with the President and the

ability to elevate issues to the highest 
levels or the independent gravitas to 
bring substantial public attention to 
that country’s needs. That said, I do 
believe it is appropriate to ask Presi-
dents and their Secretaries of State to 
explain their rationale for choosing 
Ambassador nominees outside of the 
Foreign and Civil Services so that the 
public can understand the rationale for 
these appointments. This would give 
both the U.S. public and foreign publics 
the assurance that the White House is 
not merely doling out political sine-
cures 
but 
is 
devoting 
meaningful 
thought to these selections. 
The legislation I am introducing 
today with Senator BOOKER would not 
constrain the President’s discretion to 
choose appointees but would require 
him or her to justify these selections 
and explain to Congress why someone 
from outside the State Department is 
the optimal choice to represent Amer-
ica’s interests abroad. I am proud to in-
troduce this bill to ensure that U.S. 
foreign policy and our national secu-
rity interests are advanced by the most 
qualified Americans, and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to 
ensure that this legislation is swiftly 
considered by the Senate. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. 
BROWN, and Mr. CARDIN): 
S. 4039. A bill to require the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
to provide guidance to States regarding 
Federal reimbursement for furnishing 
behavioral health services and treat-
ment under Medicaid and the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program using 
telehealth services, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 4039 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Medicaid 
Ensuring Necessary Telehealth is Available 
Long-term Health for Kids and Underserved 
Act’’ or the ‘‘MENTAL Health for Kids and 
Underserved Act’’. 
SEC. 2. GUIDANCE TO STATES ON FURNISHING 
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES VIA 
TELEHEALTH UNDER MEDICAID AND 
CHIP. 
Not later than 1 year after the date of en-
actment of this Act, the Secretary of Health 
and Human Services, acting through the Ad-
ministrator of the Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services, shall issue guidance to 
States on the following: 
(1) State options for Federal reimburse-
ment of expenditures under Medicaid and the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program for fur-
nishing clinically appropriate services and 
treatment for behavioral health needs, in-
cluding assessment, counseling, and medica-
tion management, using telehealth services. 
Such options shall include, to the extent ap-
propriate, options for States to receive Fed-
eral reimbursement for such expenditures 
without the need for approval of a State plan 
amendment or waiver. Such guidance shall 
also include guidance on furnishing services 
and treatments that address the needs of 
high-risk individuals, including racial and 
ethnic minorities, such as American Indians 
and Alaska Natives. 
(2) State options for Federal reimburse-
ment of expenditures under Medicaid and the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program for fur-
nishing clinically appropriate behavioral 
health services and treatment to school-aged 
youth and teens enrolled in Medicaid or the 
Children’s Health Insurance Program using 
telehealth services. Such options shall in-
clude, to the extent appropriate, options for 
States to receive Federal reimbursement for 
such expenditures without the need for ap-
proval of a State plan amendment or waiver. 
(3) Best practices for integrating clinically 
appropriate behavioral health provided via 
telehealth services covered by a State plan 
for medical assistance under title XIX of the 
Social Security Act (or a waiver of such a 
plan) or a State plan for child health assist-
ance under title XXI of such Act (or a waiver 
of such a plan) into school-based settings, in-
cluding 
full-service 
community 
schools. 
Such best practices shall include resources 
and information specifically for educators 
and other school-based staff on how to recog-
nize signs of distress in high-risk students 
and make appropriate referrals for school- 
based behavioral health services. 
(4) Best practices for evaluating how uti-
lizing clinically appropriate telehealth serv-
ices for behavioral health services and treat-
ment affects outcomes, as well as costs. 
(5) Best practices for monitoring fraud, 
waste, and abuse that may occur during be-
havioral health services furnished through 
telehealth services covered under Medicaid 
and the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram. 
SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS ON BEHAVIORAL 
HEALTH

actment of this Act, the Secretary of Health

pact of telehealth on access, cost, and qual-
ity of behavioral health services offered to 
beneficiaries under the Medicaid program 
and the Children’s Health Insurance Pro-
gram, including specific information on the 
impact of telehealth on access to and the 
quality of behavioral health services in 
schools.

Act along with my colleague Senator 
WHITEHOUSE. This legislation seeks to 
improve supply chain efficiencies and 
port safety and security by creating a 
Federal standard and licensure for 
independent ship agent companies, just 
as we already do for transportation 
intermediaries like Freight Forwarders 
and Non-Vessel Operating Common 
Carriers, NVOCCs. 
Ship agents are one of the most im-
portant yet least understood stake-
holders in the international marine 
trade supply chain, but in the United 
States, there is no Federal licensing for 
these essential players. 
A ship agent can best be understood 
as the general contractor of the port 
call, 
tasked 
by 
ship 
owners 
and 
charterers with managing thousands of 
vendors to ensure a safe, secure, and 
cost efficient port call. This includes 
coordinating critical Federal Govern-
ment clearances and inspections for 
Agencies that include the Coast Guard, 
Customs and Border Protection, the 
EPA, USDA, and others. Government 
officials rely on ship agents to fulfill 
their critical role of facilitating com-
merce, and protecting life, property, 
and the environment. More than any 
other stakeholder, the ship agent fa-
cilitates efficiencies at the Nation’s 
ports of entry, the frontline of the sup-
ply chain. 
While the United Nations Conference 
on Trade and Development has estab-
lished minimum international stand-
ards for ship agent competency, qual-
ity, and fiduciary responsibility, there 
is no requirement for independent ship 
agent companies to abide by these, or 
any set of standards in the United 
States. Many domestic independent 
ship agent companies voluntarily cer-
tify through third-party accreditation 
associations in accordance with these 
international standards, but not all do. 
When ship agents are not properly 
trained and do not carry the appro-
priate bond and insurance, it creates 
delays and inefficiencies during vessel 
calls, jeopardizes port entry and clear-
ance, and increases risk for Federal 
Agencies. 
That is why it is critical to require 
Federal licensing for independent ship 
agent companies. Indeed, such a licens-
ing requirement represents a unique 
opportunity for the United States to 
adopt its own uniform nationwide 
standards, consistent with the existing 
international standards, to ensure that 
ship agents have the knowledge, expe-
rience, and skills needed to manage 
these high stakes vessel calls and help 
our government agencies fulfill their 
responsibilities. 
I urge our colleagues to join us in 
supporting this commonsense legisla-
tion. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Ms. 
COLLINS, and Mr. MERKLEY): 
S. 4041. A bill to promote environ-
mental literacy; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today, I 
am introducing bipartisan, bicameral 
legislation with Senator COLLINS and 
Senator MERKLEY
and Congressman 
SARBANES
that 
targets 
the 
funda-
mental goal of public education, which 
is to equip the next generation with 
the knowledge, skills, and experiences 
to understand the world around them 
and their ability to shape it. In the 
face of a global climate crisis, it is es-
sential that all students graduate with 
environmental literacy skills to secure 
and sustain their future. The No Child 
Left Inside Act will ensure that our 
students will have the opportunity to 
develop environmental literacy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2096 
April 7, 2022 
Environmental 
education 
provides 
broad benefits. It has been shown to en-
hance student achievement in science 
and other core subjects and to increase 
student engagement and critical think-
ing 
skills. 
Moreover, 
it 
promotes 
healthy lifestyles by encouraging kids 
to get outside. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has shown 
us just how vital understanding the en-
vironment is to our own health, well- 
being, and ability to carry out our 
daily activities. As the pandemic took 
hold, Rhode Island’s environmental 
educators sprung into action, creating 
outdoor learning support opportunities 
and virtual programs for students as 
they did school from home. We need 
this to work on a national level for all 
students. 
The No Child Left Inside Act author-
izes $150 million annually to supports 
States in the development and imple-
mentation of environmental literacy 
plans to integrate environmental edu-
cation and field experiences into the 
core 
academic 
program 
in 
public 
schools, with an emphasis on profes-
sional development in environmental 
education for teachers. With this fund-
ing, States will provide grants for part-
nerships between school districts and 
parks, natural resource management 
agencies, educator preparation pro-
grams, museums or other organizations 
with expertise in engaging young peo-
ple with real world examples of envi-
ronmental and scientific concepts. The 
legislation also establishes a pilot pro-
gram for outdoor school education pro-
grams that offer intensive, hands-on 
learning experiences, such as residen-
tial programs and summer camps. 
The No Child Left Inside Act will 
also help coordinate the Federal efforts 
on environmental education. It re-
quires the Secretary of Education to 
establish environmental literacy advi-
sory panel to coordinate and report on 
environmental 
literacy 
activities 
across Federal Agencies. It also will 
prove easy access to environmental 
education resources through the De-
partment of Education’s website. 
The No Child Left Inside Act has the 
support of nearly 100 organizations, 
representing educators, parks, muse-
ums, environmental organizations, and 
community-based organizations at the 
national, State, and local levels. They 
stand ready and willing to partner with 
schools across the Nation. The Federal 
Government should be a partner too. 
That is why I urge my colleagues to 
join me in cosponsoring the No Child 
Left Inside Act. 
By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. 
WHITEHOUSE, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, 
and Mr. MERKLEY): 
S. 4060. A bill to amend the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for in-
flation rebates, and for other purposes; 
to the Committee on Finance. 
Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am 
introducing the Food and Fuel Family 
Savings Act, FFFSA, along with Sen-
ator WHITEHOUSE, Senator FEINSTEIN, 
and Senator MERKLEY. Price increases, 
particularly for basic necessities like 
food and gas, are weakening household 
buying power and cutting family budg-
ets across the country. Americans are 
struggling, and it is critically impor-
tant that we both address the long- 
term factors driving inflation and sup-
port the millions of families facing 
higher prices right now. That is why we 
are introducing this legislation, which 
would provide eligible individuals and 
families with debit cards to cover high-
er food and fuel prices in the short 
term and help tame inflation in the 
medium and long term. 
A number of factors are driving our 
current bout of inflation. Pandemic- 
driven supply chain snarls, a surge and 
shift in demand towards goods, and 
corporate consolidation have created 
an imbalance between supply and de-
mand. Energy prices have risen par-
ticularly quickly, as OPEC limits out-
put and oil companies refuse to invest 
in domestic production to meet grow-
ing 
demand. 
Russia’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine has also decreased global oil, 
fertilizer, and wheat supplies, moving 
prices higher for food and energy. 
These wide-ranging pressures pushed 
the Consumer Price Index up 7.9 per-
cent in February—its fastest increase 
in 40 years. 
Hard-working Americans are not at 
fault for these global price pressures. 
Yet, these households, which often put 
a large share of their income towards 
basic necessities, are being forced to 
bear the burden of higher costs. Indeed, 
U.S. grocery prices rose 8.6 percent in 
February, the largest annual increase 
in over 40 years, and U.S. gas prices 
were up a whopping 38 percent. While 
the wealthiest Americans can afford 
more expensive everyday goods, higher 
prices erode working families’ buying 
power and can force them to delay or 
reduce critically needed purchases. We 
need to help them. 
Our bill would take the burden off 
the shoulders of working Americans by 
providing targeted relief to low- and 
moderate-income individuals and fami-
lies. It would provide eligible house-
holds with debit cards loaded with $600 
per family member that work exclu-
sively at grocery stores and gas pumps. 
The average American household would 
receive $1,500. Using estimates from 
Bloomberg economists, this payment 
should cover the additional $183 the av-
erage family will spend each month on 
food and fuel for the rest of 2022. In 
other words, our legislation would en-
sure households can put food on the 
table and gas in the car this year. 
Importantly, this fiscally responsible 
legislation is fully paid for. In fact, off-
sets would pay for the cost of the debit 
cards and slash the deficit by hundreds 
of billions of dollars. More than that, it 
would tamp down inflation in the me-
dium and long term. Indeed, this bill 
would help families weather today’s in-
flation while cooling price increases in 
the years ahead. 
Congress must continue working on 
other measures to foster a stronger, 
more resilient postpandemic economy. 
Our legislation would aid these long- 
term efforts while providing Americans 
the financial help they need right now. 
I urge our colleagues to join us in 
supporting this important legislation. 
By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, 
Mr. 
MENENDEZ, 
Ms. 
CORTEZ

Mr. 
HEINRICH, 
Mrs. 
FEINSTEIN, 
Mr. 
DURBIN, 
Mr. 
MURPHY, and Ms. ROSEN): 
S. 4068. A bill to promote and support 
collaboration between Hispanic-serving 
institutions 
and 
local 
educational 
agencies with high enrollments of His-
panic or Latino students, and for other 
purposes; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. PADILLA. Mr. President, I rise 
to speak in support of the Hispanic 
Educational Resources and Empower-
ment Act of 2022, which I introduced 
today. 
Hispanic-serving institutions provide 
incredible opportunities for millions of 
low-income and first-generation stu-
dents. I am proud that my State of 
California is home to 174 HSls and 51 
emerging HSls, the most in the coun-
try. That is why I launched the first- 
ever Senate HSI Caucus with my col-
league, Senator Menendez—to spotlight 
and advocate for the 559 HSIs across 
our country. These critical institutions 
educate our future leaders and help to 
build a more diverse and inclusive 
workforce. 
Over the last 2 years, the number of 
HSls in our country declined for the 
first time in two decades. A decrease in 
higher education enrollment among 
Latino students during the COVID–19 
pandemic has led to the decrease in the 
number of HSls, illustrating the need 
to invest in Latino youth. That is why 
I am introducing the HERE Act. 
If enacted, this bill would support 
Latino students throughout secondary 
and postsecondary education. Specifi-
cally, the HERE Act would provide $150 
million for grants to create partner-
ships between HSls and K–12 school dis-
tricts that serve large populations of 
Latino students. 
Schools could use this funding to pro-
vide academic support that better pre-
pares students for postsecondary edu-
cation. They could create new pro-
grams to foster a college-going culture 
by exposing students and their families 
to postsecondary opportunities. And 
they could better support students 
through the college application and 
transition 
process. 
Additionally, 
schools could use grants to address 
non-academic needs that serve as bar-
riers to college enrollment and comple-
tion—such as childcare, food insecu-
rity, financial hardship, and more. 
Latinos are the largest, youngest, 
and second fastest growing minority 
population in the United States. While 
making up 18 percent of our country’s 
population, Latinos comprise 26 per-
cent of prekindergarten through grade 
12 enrollment. Latino students are 
going to college more than ever before,

but they still face lower educational 
outcomes, 
including 
lower 
grades, 
lower scores on standardized tests, and 
higher dropout rates. 
As a Senator representing one of the 
most diverse States in the country, I 
am proud to work with my leagues to 
ensure the American dream is a reality 
for every student. 
I want to thank Congressman JOA-

S. RES. 588 
Whereas, according to the 2020 report enti-
tled ‘‘Economic Well-Being of U.S. House-
holds’’ by the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System, economic distress from 
the COVID–19 pandemic was evident when 
analyzing the self-assessments of individuals 
with respect to their financial trajectories 
over the past year; 
Whereas, according to the 2019 report enti-
tled ‘‘How America Banks: Household Use of 
Banking and Financial Services’’ by the Fed-
eral Deposit Insurance Corporation, approxi-
mately 5.4 percent of households in the 
United States are unbanked and, therefore, 
have limited or no access to savings, lending, 
and other basic financial services; 
Whereas, according to the 2021 Consumer 
Financial Literacy and Preparedness Survey 
of the National Foundation for Credit Coun-
seling and Wells Fargo— 
(1) 47 percent of the general population in 
the United States report having credit card 
debt; 
(2) 38 percent of adults in the United States 
report carrying credit card balances from 
month-to-month; and 
(3) 44 percent of the general population in 
the United States have a budget and keep 
close track of expenses, such as food, hous-
ing, and entertainment; 
Whereas, according to a report entitled 
‘‘Financial Capability of Adults with Dis-
abilities’’ by the National Disability Insti-

more likely to struggle with the key compo-
nents of financial capability, which are mak-
ing ends meet, planning ahead, managing fi-
nancial products, and financial knowledge 
and decision making, and could benefit from 
targeted financial education; 
Whereas, according to the statistical re-
lease of the Board of Governors of the Fed-
eral Reserve System for the fourth quarter 
of 2021 entitled ‘‘Household Debt and Cred-
it’’— 
(1) outstanding household debt in the 
United States has been increasing steadily 
since 2013 and was $414,000,000,000 higher than 
at the end of 2019; and 
(2) outstanding student loan balances have 
more than doubled in the last decade to ap-
proximately $1,560,000,000,000; 
Whereas, according to the 2022 report enti-
tled ‘‘Survey of the States: Economic and 
Personal Finance Education in Our Nation’s 
Schools’’, by the Council for Economic Edu-
cation— 
(1) only 25 States require students to take 
an economics course as a high school gradua-
tion requirement; and 
(2) only 23 States require students to take 
a personal finance course as a high school 
graduation requirement, either independ-
ently or as part of an economics course; 
Whereas expanding access to the safe, 
mainstream financial system will provide in-
dividuals with less expensive and more se-
cure options for managing finances and 
building wealth; 
Whereas quality personal financial edu-
cation is essential to ensure that individuals 
are prepared— 
(1) to make sound money management de-
cisions about credit, debt, insurance, finan-
cial transactions, and planning for the fu-
ture; 
(2) to become responsible workers, heads of 
household, investors, entrepreneurs, business 
leaders, and citizens; 
Whereas financial education in schools in 
the United States is critical to a long-term 
financial inclusion strategy to reach stu-
dents who are not able to get sufficient per-
sonal finance guidance at home; 
Whereas, according to the 2021 report enti-
tled ‘‘Game Changer: The Evaluation of the 
Jump$tart Financial Foundations for Edu-
cators Professional Development Program’’ 
by the Financial Literacy Group, teacher 
training regarding financial education im-
proves student outcomes significantly, espe-
cially among historically underserved stu-
dents; 
Whereas increased financial literacy— 
(1) empowers individuals to make wise fi-
nancial decisions; and 
(2) reduces the confusion caused by an in-
creasingly complex economy; 
Whereas a greater understanding of, and 
familiarity with, financial markets and in-
stitutions will lead to increased economic 
activity and growth; and 
Whereas, in 2003, Congress— 
(1) determined that coordinating Federal 
financial literacy efforts and formulating a 
national strategy is important; and 
(2) in light of that determination, passed 
the Financial Literacy and Education Im-
provement Act (20 U.S.C. 9701 et seq.), estab-
lishing the Financial Literacy and Education 
Commission: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 2022 as ‘‘Financial Lit-
eracy Month’’ to raise public awareness 
about— 
(A) the importance of personal financial 
education in the United States; and 
(B) the serious consequences that may re-
sult from a lack of understanding about per-
sonal finances; and 
(2) calls on the Federal Government, 
States, localities, schools, nonprofit organi-
zations, businesses, and the people of the 
United States to observe Financial Literacy 
Month with appropriate programs and activi-
ties.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2099 
April 7, 2022 
Whereas, in the first 6 weeks of fighting in 
Ukraine, more than 4,300,000 Ukrainians, of 
which the majority are women and children, 
fled the country in response to Putin’s war; 
Whereas women play a critical role in fa-
cilitating the transit of children to safety, 
including by escorting the children of par-
ents 
and 
guardians 
who 
cannot 
leave 
Ukraine so that such children are able to 
find safety in neighboring countries; 
Whereas 
the 
women 
who 
remain 
in 
Ukraine 
contribute 
to 
all 
aspects 
of 
warfighting, including by fighting on the 
front lines and as part of the territorial de-
fense, delivering supplies and weapons, and 
preparing cities for assaults by the Russian 
Federation; 
Whereas 17 percent of the armed forces of 
Ukraine are women; 
Whereas the women of Ukraine have a long 
history of defending Ukraine and standing up 
for their rights and freedoms; 
Whereas, following the 2014 invasion of the 
sovereign and independent state of Ukraine 
by the Russian Federation, the women of 
Ukraine joined the fight to preserve their 
independence; 
Whereas, despite significant contributions 
to the war effort, outdated legislation in 
Ukraine classifies women as cooks, tailors, 
and administrative assistants, even while 
women were fighting and dying on the front 
lines beside their male counterparts; 
Whereas women are an integral part of the 
armed forces of Ukraine and continue to de-
fend their homes and their country; 
Whereas, on March 9, the armed forces of 
the Russian Federation deliberately at-
tacked civilian targets in Mariupol, Ukraine, 
which destroyed a hospital that served as 
both a maternity ward and a children’s hos-
pital, killing two women and a baby; 
Whereas, following the devastating attack 
on the well-known and established hospital, 
the world watched in horror as pregnant 
women, mothers carrying newborn babies, 
and young children fled the rubble of what 
should have been a safe place; 
Whereas the women at the hospital should 
have been celebrating new life and looking 
toward raising their children in peace and 
safety, instead, those women are seeking 
shelter in subways, giving birth in bunkers, 
and worrying for the safety of their children 
and the future of Ukraine; 
Whereas the attack on the maternity ward 
and children’s hospital in Mariupol was the 
third such attack on a maternity ward in 
Ukraine by the Russian Federation since the 
beginning of the invasion on February 24; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations, 
more than 4,300 women have given birth 
since the start of the war, and 80,000 Ukrain-
ian women are expected to give birth in be-
tween April and June of 2022; 
Whereas all women, in every situation, 
have the right to a safe birth and access to 
crucial supplies necessary for the manage-
ment of pregnancy complications, including 
oxygen and medical supplies, which are run-
ning dangerously low in Ukraine because of 
the ongoing violence and refusal on the part 
of the Russian Federation to allow for safe 
passage for humanitarian purposes; 
Whereas the unprovoked attack on a civil-
ian building constitutes a war crime under 
the Geneva Convention relative to the Pro-
tection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 
done at Geneva August 12, 1949, (commonly 
referred to as the ‘‘Fourth Geneva Conven-
tion’’) and should be investigated as such a 
crime; 
Whereas the Russian Federation has delib-
erately attacked civilian infrastructure in 
Ukraine, including schools, hospitals, busi-
nesses, apartment buildings, and utility 
services; 
Whereas the initial days of the invasion of 
Ukraine by the Russian Federation have re-
sulted in a disproportionate number of 
women and children seeking safety outside 
of Ukraine; 
Whereas Ukrainian women and girls, like 
women and girls in all humanitarian emer-
gencies, including women and girls forced to 
leave their homes in conflict settings, face 
increased and exacerbated vulnerabilities 
to— 
(1) gender-based violence, including rape, 
child marriage, domestic violence, and sex-
ual exploitation and assault; 
(2) all forms of human trafficking; 
(3) disruptions in education and livelihood; 
(4) lack of access to health care; and 
(5) food insecurity and malnutrition; 
Whereas the world has a responsibility to 
respond with care to the humanitarian crisis 
in Ukraine and in neighboring countries to 
address the specific needs of women and 
girls; 
Whereas 
the 
United 
Nations 
Security 
Council adopted United Nations Security 
Council Resolution 1325 on October 31, 2000, 
acknowledging the impact of conflict and se-
curity decisions on women and calling on all 
member states to include ‘‘women at all de-
cision-making levels in national, regional 
and international institutions and mecha-
nisms for the prevention, management, and 
resolution of conflict’’; 
Whereas, according to the United Nations 
Entity for Gender Equality and the Em-
powerment of Women (commonly referred to 
as ‘‘UN Women’’), peace negotiations are 
more likely to end in a peace agreement 
when women and women’s groups play a 
meaningful role in the negotiation process, 
and according to the International Peace In-
stitute, a peace agreement is 35 percent more 
likely to last at least 15 years if women par-
ticipate in the development of the peace 
agreement; 
Whereas, in 2016, Ukraine adopted its first 
National Action Plan for the implementa-
tion of United Nations Security Council Res-
olution 1325, and, on October 28, 2020, 
Ukraine approved a new National Action 
Plan for 2021 through 2025 in order to address 
the impact on women of the aggression of 
the Russian Federation against Ukraine and 
to ensure gender equality in the security and 
defense sectors of Ukraine; 
Whereas representation of women in poli-
tics in Ukraine has increased steadily since 
the first parliament of an independent 
Ukraine met in 1990; 
Whereas more than 20 percent of seats in 
the ninth and current Verkhovna Rada are 
held by women, the most in Ukrainian his-
tory; 
Whereas women across Ukraine have made 
political gains in recent years, including in 
local elections on October 25, 2020, where 38 
percent of deputies elected were women; and 
Whereas women in Ukraine should be in-
volved at all levels and in all aspects of lead-
ership, negotiation, conflict resolution, and 
peacekeeping in order to ensure the most en-
during peace for Ukraine and the region: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes, honors, and commends the 
women of Ukraine who have contributed to 
the fight for freedom and the defense of 
Ukraine, including women who— 
(A) are members of the Armed Forces Ter-
ritorial Defense Forces of Ukraine; 
(B) are volunteers, organizing and oper-
ating humanitarian organizations; 
(C) are doctors, nurses, paramedics, and 
support personnel, providing life-saving serv-
ices across Ukraine; 
(D) have mobilized to assist the safe trans-
fer of the children and other vulnerable indi-
viduals from Ukraine; and 
(E) are public leaders, politicians, and dip-
lomats; 
(2) stands with the people of Ukraine in 
support of their fight for freedom against the 
Russian Federation; 
(3) acknowledges the women who have 
risked their lives to travel through territory 
controlled by the Russian Federation, break 
siege tactics surrounding cities, and to en-
sure the safety of children and the elderly; 
(4) commends— 
(A) the bordering countries of Ukraine, in-
cluding Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hun-
gary, and Moldova, who are accommodating 
more than 4,300,000 refugees; and 
(B) the broader European Union for com-
mitting to provide support during the grow-
ing humanitarian crisis; 
(5) calls on all countries to ensure that aid 
provided in support of refugees of and inter-
nally displaced persons within Ukraine takes 
into account the needs of women and the 
gender-specific risks that women face in 
seeking safety; 
(6) 
acknowledges 
the 
important 
role 
women must play in resolving the conflict 
between Ukraine and the Russian Federation 
as outlined in United Nations Security Coun-
cil Resolution 1325 (2016) and required by the 
laws of the United States and regulations of 
Ukraine; 
(7) further calls on all countries to pro-
mote the meaningful inclusion of women in 
negotiations and decision-making at all lev-
els, including security decisions; and 
(8) commits to supporting the women of 
Ukraine wherever they are as they fight 
back against tyranny and work for the free 
and democratic future of Ukraine.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2100 
April 7, 2022 
Whereas the United States has the highest 
maternal mortality rate among affluent 
countries, in part because of the dispropor-
tionate mortality rate of Black women; 
Whereas Black women are 49 percent more 
likely than all other women to deliver pre-
maturely; 
Whereas the high rates of maternal mor-
tality among Black women span across— 
(1) income levels; 
(2) education levels; and 
(3) socioeconomic status; 
Whereas structural racism, gender oppres-
sion, and the social determinants of health 
inequities experienced by Black women and 
birthing persons in the United States signifi-
cantly contribute to the disproportionately 
high rates of maternal mortality and mor-
bidity among Black women and birthing per-
sons; 
Whereas racism and discrimination play a 
consequential role in maternal health care 
experiences and outcomes of Black birthing 
persons; 
Whereas a fair and wide distribution of re-
sources and birth options, especially with re-
gard to reproductive health care services and 
maternal health programming, is critical to 
closing the racial gap in maternal health 
outcomes; 
Whereas Black midwives, doulas, perinatal 
health workers, and community-based orga-
nizations provide holistic maternal care but 
face structural and legal barriers to licen-
sure, reimbursement, and provision of care; 
Whereas COVID–19, which has dispropor-
tionately harmed Black Americans, is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of adverse preg-
nancy outcomes and maternal and neonatal 
complications; 
Whereas the COVID–19 pandemic has fur-
ther highlighted issues within the broken 
health care system in the United States and 
the harm of that system to Black women and 
birthing persons; 
Whereas new data from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention has indi-
cated that since the COVID–19 pandemic 
began, the maternal mortality rate for Black 
women has increased by 26 percent; 
Whereas, even as there is growing concern 
about improving access to mental health 
services, Black women are least likely to 
have access to mental health screenings, 
treatment, and support before, during, and 
after pregnancy; 
Whereas Black pregnant and postpartum 
workers are disproportionately denied rea-
sonable accommodations in the workplace, 
leading to adverse pregnancy outcomes; 
Whereas Black pregnant people dispropor-
tionately experience surveillance and pun-
ishment, including shackling incarcerated 
people in labor, drug testing mothers and in-
fants without informed consent, separating 
mothers from their newborns, and criminal-
izing pregnancy outcomes; 
Whereas justice-informed, culturally con-
gruent models of care are beneficial to Black 
women; and 
Whereas an investment must be made in— 
(1) maternity care for Black women and 
birthing persons, including support of care 
led by the communities most affected by the 
maternal health crisis in the United States; 
(2) continuous health insurance coverage 
to support Black women and birthing per-
sons for the full postpartum period up to at 
least 1 year after giving birth; and 
(3) policies that support and promote af-
fordable, comprehensive, and holistic mater-
nal health care that is free from gender and 
racial discrimination, regardless of incarcer-
ation: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes that— 
(1) Black women are experiencing high, 
disproportionate rates of maternal mortality 
and morbidity in the United States; 
(2) the alarmingly high rates of maternal 
mortality among Black women are unaccept-
able; 
(3) in order to better mitigate the effects of 
systemic and structural racism, Congress 
must work toward ensuring that the Black 
community has— 
(A) safe and affordable housing; 
(B) transportation equity; 
(C) nutritious food; 
(D) clean air and water; 
(E) environments free from toxins; 
(F) fair treatment within the criminal jus-
tice system; 
(G) safety and freedom from violence; 
(H) a living wage; 
(I) equal economic opportunity; 
(J) a sustained workforce pipeline for di-
verse perinatal professionals; and 
(K) comprehensive, high-quality, and af-
fordable health care with access to the full 
spectrum of reproductive care; 
(4) in order to improve maternal health 
outcomes, Congress must fully support and 
encourage policies grounded in the human 
rights, reproductive justice, and birth justice 
frameworks that address Black maternal 
health inequity; 
(5) Black women and birthing persons must 
be active participants in the policy decisions 
that impact their lives; 
(6) in order to ensure access to safe and re-
spectful maternal health care for Black 
birthing persons, Congress must pass the 
Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 
(S. 346; H.R. 959); and 
(7) ‘‘Black Maternal Health Week’’ is an 
opportunity to— 
(A) deepen the national conversation about 
Black maternal health in the United States; 
(B) amplify community-driven policy, re-
search, and care solutions; 
(C) center the voices of Black mothers, 
women, families, and stakeholders; 
(D) provide a national platform for Black- 
led entities and efforts on maternal health, 
birth, and reproductive justice; and 
(E) enhance community organizing on 
Black maternal health.

591—EX-
PRESSING 
SUPPORT 
FOR 
THE 
DESIGNATION OF APRIL 10, 2022 
AS ‘‘VENTURE SMITH FREEDOM 
DAY’’ 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL submitted the 
following resolution; which was re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judici-
ary: 
S. RES. 591 
Whereas, in about 1729, Venture Smith was 
born free in West Africa and, in 1739, was 
seized from his home and enslaved in New 
England; 
Whereas 257 years ago, in the year 1765, 
Venture Smith, at the age of 36, purchased 
his freedom; 
Whereas Venture Smith went on to free his 
family from the bondage of slavery; 
Whereas Venture Smith became a success-
ful landowner, businessman, and author in 
the United States, generations before Black 
Americans began to obtain constitutional, 
legal, social, and economic rights; 
Whereas, in November 1798, Venture Smith 
was the first African American to write and 
publish his own autobiography; 
Whereas Venture Smith was the first per-
son to write and publish the phrase, ‘‘My 
freedom is a privilege which nothing else can 
equal’’; 
Whereas Venture Smith died a free man on 
September 19, 1805 in Connecticut; and 
Whereas April 10 would be an appropriate 
date to designate as ‘‘Venture Smith Free-
dom Day’’: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate supports the des-
ignation of ‘‘Venture Smith Freedom Day’’ 
on April 10, which would recognize the 257th 
anniversary of Venture Smith purchasing his 
freedom and going on to become a land-
owner, 
businessman, 
and 
author 
in 
Connecticut.

SENATE RESOLUTION 592—DESIG-
NATING APRIL 6, 2022, AS ‘‘NA-
TIONAL ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY 
AWARENESS DAY’’ 
Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. 
CRAMER) submitted the following reso-
lution; 
which 
was 
considered 
and 
agreed to: 
S. RES. 592 
Whereas assistive technology is any item, 
piece of equipment, or product system that 
is used to increase, maintain, or improve the 
functional capabilities of an individual with 
a disability or an older adult; 
Whereas an assistive technology service is 
any service that directly assists an indi-
vidual with a disability or an older adult in 
the selection, acquisition, or use of an assist-
ive technology device; 
Whereas, in 2018, the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention reported that 1 in 4 
individuals in the United States, or almost 
61,000,000 individuals, has a disability; 
Whereas, in the 2019–2020 school year, the 
Department of Education reported that there 
were more than 7,300,000 children with dis-
abilities; 
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention reported that, among adults 
65 years of age and older, 2 in 5 have a dis-
ability; 
Whereas assistive technology enables indi-
viduals with disabilities and older adults to 
be included in their communities and in in-
clusive classrooms and workplaces; 
Whereas assistive technology devices and 
services are necessities, not luxury items, for 
millions of individuals with disabilities and 
older adults, without which they would be 
unable to live in their communities, access 
education, or obtain, retain, and advance 
gainful, competitive, and integrated employ-
ment; 
Whereas the availability of assistive tech-
nology in the workplace promotes economic 
self-sufficiency, enhances work participa-
tion, and is critical to the employment of in-
dividuals with disabilities and older adults; 
and 
Whereas State assistive technology pro-
grams support a continuum of services that 
include— 
(1) the exchange, repair, recycling, and 
other reutilization of assistive technology 
devices; 
(2) device loan programs that provide 
short-term loans of assistive technology de-
vices to individuals, employers, public agen-
cies, and others; 
(3) the demonstration of devices to inform 
decision making; and 
(4) State financing to help individuals pur-
chase or obtain assistive technology through 
a variety of initiatives, such as financial 
loan programs, leasing programs, and other 
financing alternatives, that give individuals 
affordable, flexible options to purchase or 
obtain assistive technology: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates April 6, 2022, as ‘‘National 
Assistive Technology Awareness Day’’; and 
(2) commends— 
(A) assistive technology specialists and 
program coordinators for their hard work

ORDER FOR ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, if there 
is no further business to come before 
the Senate, I ask that it stand ad-
journed under the provisions of S. Res. 
593, following the remarks of Senator 
CORNYN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The Senator from Texas.

Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, watch-
ing the wrapup by our friend from Con-
necticut and the Presiding Officer, I 
don’t know anybody who could argue 
that the Senate is incapable of getting 
a lot done in a short period of time, 
given the will. That was pretty re-
markable. 
Mr. President, nearly 10 months after 
the Senate passed bipartisan legisla-
tion to fund the CHIPS Act, we are fi-
nally inching closer to the finish line. 
The House and the Senate are moving 
forward to a formal conference process 
to supply the CHIPS Program with $52 
billion and make other investments in 
our competitiveness. 
Yesterday afternoon, Members of the 
Senate and the House heard from ad-
ministration officials about how im-
portant this legislation is. Commerce 
Secretary Gina Raimondo spoke about 
the economic risks of a weak semicon-
ductor supply chain. 
I might just pause here for a minute 
in case people are wondering why semi-
conductors are so important. Well, the 
fact of the matter is that semiconduc-
tors are essential to run everything 
from your cell phone to the most ad-
vanced stealth fighters made by the 
U.S. Government, the F–35, and every-
thing in between. And during the pan-
demic and the mitigation efforts that 
we undertook, with kids studying re-
motely on their laptops, that would 
not be possible, nor would the Wi-Fi 
connections be possible without access 
to semiconductors. So these microcir-
cuits have become absolutely essential 
to our way of life. 
Over the last couple of years, manu-
facturers have had to halt production 
of the various products that they 
make, shift their offerings, or even lay 
off workers because of a shortage of 
these semiconductors, these micro-
circuit chips. Now, at the micro level, 
this disruption is having a big impact 
on 
consumers: 
empty 
car 
lots, 
backordered electronics, higher prices 
on home appliances. But at the 30,000- 
foot level, the macro level, this is ter-
ribly damaging to our national econ-
omy. 
The 
semiconductor 
shortage 
has 
shaved an estimated $240 billion off of 
our gross domestic product last year—

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S2104 
April 7, 2022 
$240 billion lost because of an inad-
equate access to these semiconductors, 
these microcircuits. Based on the way 
that things are trending, the strain is 
only going to get greater. Global de-
mand for these semiconductor chips is 
expected to increase by 56 percent over 
the next decade. 
If you think about it, our dependency 
on technology is going to do nothing 
but get greater and greater and great-
er; hence, the demand and the need for 
these semiconductors and the demand 
that will go up by 56 percent, it is esti-
mated, in the next decade. 
It is absolutely critical that we start 
investing in domestic, made-in-Amer-
ica semiconductors now to insure that 
we have the capacity to meet that need 
in the future. And it is not just our 
economy. This has a very clear connec-
tion with our national security. 
Not only will the CHIPS Program, as 
it is called—introduced originally by 
the senior Senator from Virginia, Sen-
ator WARNER, and myself—this pro-
gram will help us pave the way for new 
jobs and big investments in cities all 
across our country. 
If you want an idea, a glimpse, of just 
what those benefits would look like, 
my State is an example of one place 
that will change dramatically as a re-
sult of this demand for these microcir-
cuits. 
Last fall, I joined leaders from 
Samsung, a South Korean company 
that has a large presence in Austin, 
TX, and they announced a $17 billion 
investment in a new chip fab—that is 
what the manufacturing facilities are 
called, a fab, fabrication unit—in Tay-
lor, TX, which is just outside of Austin. 
This facility is expected to directly 
create 2,000 high-tech jobs, as well as 
thousands of related jobs, once it is 
operational. And each of these fabrica-
tion manufacturing facilities will cre-
ate a whole ecosystem of suppliers that 
will grow up around it. So the $17 bil-
lion spent by Samsung for just this one 
fabrication facility will be multiplied 
by many times in terms of the eco-
nomic benefits and the jobs created. 
This is great news not just for my 
State, for Texas, but also for the na-
tional economy and for our global com-
petitiveness. Our friends and allies are 
going to need a reliable chip supply, 
too, and I hope that we can soon send 
advanced 
semiconductors, 
made 
in 
America, 
to 
countries 
around 
the 
world. 
Once this CHIPS Program is funded, 
I expect more announcements like the 
one I mentioned from Samsung to fol-
low, both in Texas and other States 
across the country. We have already 
seen Taiwan Semiconductor in the 
process of building a new fab, or manu-
facturing facility, in Arizona. You have 
seen new investments announced by 
Intel in Ohio, along with the one by 
Samsung in Texas, and I believe there 
are more to come. 
This legislation would open up about 
$3 billion for each new or expanded 
semiconductor 
fabrication 
facility, 
providing a huge incentive for compa-
nies to make this level of investment 
right here in America. 
The 
potential 
economic 
benefits 
speak for themselves, but the biggest 
reason to pass this legislation is to pro-
tect our national security. Chips are 
critical components of far more than 
just the cell phones and washing ma-
chines that I mentioned. Advanced 
fighters, quantum computers, missile 
defense systems—you name it—5G, all 
of those rely on semiconductors. A sin-
gle rocket interceptor like we have 
seen used in Iron Dome in Israel, 
knocking down rockets coming from 
Gaza, each of those interceptors alone 
uses 750 of these microcircuits. 
An overreliance on other countries to 
produce these key components of our 
most vital defenses is a huge, huge 
risk. Yesterday, in addition to Sec-
retary Raimondo, we heard from Dep-
uty Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, 
who talked about the immense na-
tional security risk that the failure to 
produce these most advanced semi-
conductors in America has opened up. 
Just to be clear, we produce zero of 
these most advanced semiconductors 
that we depend upon for the most com-
plex technology, including our national 
security. 
Our 
military 
superiority 
really 
hinges on state-of-the-art technology. 
That is the one thing that we do better 
than any other country in the world. If 
we can’t produce these products be-
cause of a lack of chips, well, the risk 
is obvious. And when you look at who 
is producing the lion’s share of the 
world’s chips, you can see the danger 
to which we are very clearly exposed. 
Now, I blame COVID for exposing 
these vulnerable supply chains, wheth-
er it is PPE or it is chips, but now, it 
is as plain as the nose on your face, and 
we need to do something about it. 
So here are the facts. The vast ma-
jority of semiconductors are made in 
Asia, with 63 percent of the most ad-
vanced semiconductors in the world 
made in one place, and that is Taiwan. 
Even more concerning is the 92 per-
cent of the world’s most advanced 
semiconductors that come, as I said, 
from Asia. But if that supply chain, 
both from Asia and Taiwan in par-
ticular, were cut off, it would lead to 
disastrous 
consequences. 
Unfortu-
nately, this prospect is not some far-
fetched conspiracy theory or doomsday 
scenario. 
Xi Jinping has made no secret of his 
desire to invade and unify Taiwan with 
the People’s Republic of China, even 
saying he wants to be ready to do so by 
the year 2027, just 5 years from now. 
But we can’t depend on his stated time-
table because he could do it any time 
he wanted to start that invasion and 
jeopardize our access to these chips. 
We don’t want to be in a position—we 
can’t be in a position—where the bel-
ligerence of one nation impacts our 
most critical supply chains. The war in 
Ukraine has made that clear. Put sim-
ply, we need to bolster domestic semi-
conductor manufacturing, and we have 
not a moment to waste. Chip making is 
a very big endeavor. 
A number of our colleagues and I 
traveled to Taiwan a few months back 
to Taiwan Semiconductor’s facility 
there, where they, as I said, make the 
world’s leading-edge semiconductors. It 
is a big operation, and it is highly 
automated and very complex and ex-
pensive. In order to build one chip, you 
need very expensive, highly advanced 
equipment; you need skilled workers; 
and you need a lot of time. It can take 
literally months to build a single chip, 
and that is assuming you have the fa-
cility and the equipment ready to go. 
So it is clear, in light of this vulnera-
bility that we have in this essential 
supply chain, that we have squandered 
enough time already. After the Senate 
passed our version of this legislation, it 
took 8 months to get it back from the 
House of Representatives. Even then, 
their bill fell short in nearly every re-
gard. Rather than mirror the bipar-
tisan process here in the Senate, the 
Democrats in the House negotiated a 
bill just among their fellow Democrats. 
In other words, it was a partisan bill. 
That type of legislating does not lead 
to good and sustainable results here in 
Congress. 
The House-passed bill sends a whop-
ping $8 billion to a U.N. climate slush 
fund which has provided more than $100 
million to China. The entire purpose of 
this effort is to counter threats from 
China, not to bolster China’s economy 
with taxpayer dollars. So it defies all 
logic to send billions of dollars to an 
unaccountable fund that could end up 
helping our chief competitor, the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China. 
The House COMPETES Act also 
added provisions relating to immigra-
tion, from creating new types of visas 
to removing green card caps. I am fine 
with having a discussion and debate 
and votes on immigration issues, but 
they do not belong in this legislation, 
certainly not in a partisan fashion. 
In true fashion, our colleagues in the 
House who are the majority party 
added a range of handouts to their po-
litical base, especially organized labor. 
From massive slush funds to burden-
some new labor requirements, the 
unions would have won big in this bill. 
And, as I said, unfortunately, the 
House decided to undertake this effort 
in a purely partisan fashion, which 
leaves us with very little common 
ground to work with. I am frustrated, 
and I know that I am not the only one. 
There are Democratic Senators who 
have joined me in expressing their frus-
tration over how slow it is to get this 
process moving. But it is more impor-
tant to get it done right away so we 
can get the job done as thoroughly as 
necessary. 
Well, there is broad bipartisan sup-
port for this effort. I have a hard time 
explaining to my friends and constitu-
ents that when the White House is in 
favor of something, when Democrats 
are in favor of something, Republicans

are in favor of something, the House is 
in favor of it, and the Senate is in favor 
of it, we still can’t seem to get it done. 
But I hope that we will take advantage 
of this opportunity—now that con-
ferees have been appointed by the 
House and the White House—to get the 
conference committee to work, to do 
our job, and to get this bill on the 
President’s desk as soon as we can. I 
fully expect the final version to look 
very much like the bipartisan bill that 
passed the Senate rather than the par-
tisan bill that came from the House. 
I expressed to the Senator from 
Washington, Ms. CANTWELL, that I hope 
we can work efficiently and reach a 
final agreement as soon as possible. It 
is critical that we get a strong bill to 
the President’s desk and finally back 
this CHIPS Program with funding and 
protect ourselves from this, really, al-
most existential economic threat and 
threat to our national security. 
The bill has undergone a number of 
name changes over the years. It started 
out as the Endless Frontier Act. Then 
it became the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition 
Act. 
Then 
the 
House 
called it the America COMPETES Act. 
Then we gave it a new name: the Made 
in America Act. But now, we have a 
new name—and hopefully the final 
name—called the Bipartisan Innova-
tion Act. 
I hope we can work together to craft 
a truly good bill that lives up to that 
title, the Bipartisan Innovation Act, 
and delivers economic and national se-
curity benefits for all of the American 
people. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE INVASION WAR CRIMES 
DETERRENCE 
AND 
ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. NANCY PELOSI 
OF 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, as we 
speak, the battle for liberty and democracy 
rages on in Ukraine. Congress and the Coun-
try are in awe of the heroism and determina-
tion of the Ukrainian people—as they defend 
democracy in their homeland and in the world. 
Tragically, the Russian response to their 
courage and resilience has been nothing short 
of monstrous. Since Russia’s unlawful and 
unprovoked invasion, we have heard deeply 
disturbing reports out of Ukraine: demolishing 
a maternity hospital; bombing civilians fleeing 
the fighting; and killing innocent children. 
As the State Department concluded on 
March 23rd, based on the information avail-
able, these barbaric attacks amount to war 
crimes. 
Just this week, the world saw shocking and 
horrifying images of mass executions in 
Bucha—with the bodies of hundreds of slain 
civilians strewn throughout the city. Sadly, as 
President Zelenskyy reported to the United 
Nations Security Council yesterday, we have 
reason to believe this is happening elsewhere, 
too. 
Sadly, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey 
Lavrov said that the massacre the world saw 
wasn’t real—but a performance by actors play-
ing dead. 
This reality is sickening and heart-wrench-
ing—and we cannot stay silent in the face of 
these outrageous and unthinkable atrocities. 
Today, the House takes another important 
step to hold Putin and the Russian govern-
ment accountable for this cruel brutality. 
With the Ukraine War Crimes Act, we will 
ensure that the United States is collecting, 
analyzing and preserving evidence of Russian 
war crimes: an essential step so that the per-
petrators can be prosecuted. 
In doing so, we can help deter future war 
crimes—making it clear to Russian forces that 
the free world is closely watching. 
This action follows the leadership of Presi-
dent Joe Biden, who has: capably orches-
trated the West’s strong, unified response; and 
demonstrated 
extraordinary 
moral 
clarity, 
among the first to call these heinous attacks 
what they are: war crimes. 
Let us salute Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chairman GREGORY
MEEKS
and Ranking 
Member MICHAEL MCCAUL, for their relentless 
leadership in introducing this strong legislation. 
And I thank them for their commitment to bi-
partisanship: demonstrating our Nation’s unity 
and resolve as we respond to Russia’s ag-
gression. 
This legislation builds on ongoing, esca-
lating efforts by the Congress, the Administra-
tion and our Allies to punish Putin for his 
crimes. 
With historic speed and coordination with 
our allies abroad, America has led the world in 
isolating Russia and devastating its economy. 
We have: cut off Russian banks and deci-
mated its markets; choked off its access to 
technology; cracked down on the oligarchs 
funding this war—and much more. 
The House has passed bold legislation to 
revoke normal trade relations from Russia and 
ban the import of Russian energy: two major 
steps that will further cripple Putin’s war effort 
and the Russian economy. 
At the same time, we have secured $13.6 
billion in new humanitarian, security and eco-
nomic assistance for Ukraine—which is al-
ready reaching people on the ground—as well 
as bolstered our support for NATO. 
Our actions have left Russia weaker in 
every way. And now, we are taking further ac-
tion to make sure Russia is held to account for 
its crimes. 
This week, on Monday evening—54 years 
after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther 
King, Jr.—many of us gathered with the King 
family at the MLK Memorial. 
At the foot of this spectacular monument to 
peace, the King family placed a sunflower 
wreath: a symbol of our unity with the people 
of Ukraine. 
In his book Stride Toward Freedom, Dr. 
King wrote: ‘‘He who passively accepts evil is 
as much involved in it as he who helps to per-
petrate it.’’ 
The legislation that the House will pass 
today will make clear that we stand firmly 
against the evil being perpetrated against 
Ukraine—and on the side of democracy, free-
dom and peace. 
In memory of the victims of these horrific 
Russian war crimes—and in solidarity with 
those who remain in danger—I urge a strong, 
bipartisan ‘‘aye’’ vote on this legislation.

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF FREDERICK LAW OLMSTED 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of renowned archi-
tect Frederick Law Olmsted. This marks the 
200th year since his birth. 
Prior to beginning his career as a landscape 
architect, Mr. Olmsted worked as an author, 
farmer, journalist, and public servant. As the 
superintendent of New York’s Central Park, he 
was awarded the opportunity to design the 
park. This prestigious task marked only the 
beginning of his accomplished career in archi-
tecture. In 1873, Congress selected Mr. 
Olmsted to design the expansion of the U.S. 
Capitol. He also designed the Biltmore Estate 
in Asheville where he fell in love with the nat-
ural beauty of North Carolina. He later accept-
ed the opportunity to serve as the chief archi-
tect for the Village of Pinehurst. Today, the 
Village of Pinehurst is part of the Pinehurst 
National Historic Landmark District on the Na-
tional Register of Historic Places. This impres-
sive distinction serves in large part to recog-
nize the cultural and architectural significance 
of Mr. Olmsted’s exemplary work. 
After he passed in 1903, Mr. Olmsted’s 
sons and business colleagues worked to carry 
out his architectural mission which continues 
to shape the direction of American architecture 
and design. His extraordinary legacy provides 
a guiding model for all practicing architecture. 
I would like to extend my most sincere ap-
preciation to Mr. Olmsted for his committed 
and impactful leadership and achievements in 
the fields of architecture and landscaping. His 
work has greatly benefitted North Carolina and 
the U.S., and I join our entire community in 
honoring his extraordinary life. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Mr. Frederick 
Law Olmsted.

OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Marvin Randle, former 
mayor of Irving. Randle is a native and lifelong 
resident of Irving and served two consecutive 
two-year terms from May 1977 to April 1981. 
Marvin has also had a great impact on our

ness has continued to grow along with the 
DFW Metroplex. 
Marvin is a longtime friend and mentor. It is 
an honor to help celebrate such a full and 
impactful career and legacy, as Marvin retires 
this month. I thank Marvin for his great con-
tributions to our local government and the im-
pact he has made on our community.

The Blue Devils’ win was earned through 
hard work on and off the court, with their indi-
vidual talents combining through outstanding 
teamwork. Coming off a semifinal win with the 
score of 84–68, the Blue Devils put on an out-
standing performance in the Championship, 
with a final score of 61–35. I am certain that 
their legacy of championship achievement will 
inspire future Blue Devils to follow in their foot-

Darin Thompson, Coach Kenneth Randolph, 
and the Varina High School Blue Devils Boys

BENTON REA’S 85TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. DAN NEWHOUSE 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Benton Rural Electric Asso-
ciation’s 85th birthday and to sincerely thank 
them for all of their contributions to Central 
Washington. 
This electric company has changed the way 
farmers work. Benton REA was established on 
April 19, 1937, to serve those in Benton and 
the surrounding counties. One year later, Ben-
ton REA helped Benton and Yakima farmers 
move into the modern era of electricity by flip-
ping the switch to light more than 89 rural 
farms. 
As the oldest operating consumer-owned 
business serving Benton and Yakima counties, 
they understand the needs and concerns of 
the rural community when it comes to elec-
tricity needs. I thank them for their many faith-
ful years of serving the 11,000 members 
across Benton, Yakima, and Lewis counties, 
many of whom are in my district, and for pro-
viding the electricity they need. 
Congratulations on reaching this milestone 
and I wish them many more years of success.

ACCOUNT-
ABILITY ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, April 6, 2022 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to applaud Rep. MCCAUL’S Ukraine Invasion 
War Crimes Deterrence and Accountability 
Act. 
History has taught us that evidence must be 
safeguarded in order to hold tyrants to ac-
count. 
Putin and his enablers will gaslight the world 
until Kingdom Come—but the world and our 
progeny must know the truth. 
As Ukraine’s civilians and defenders con-
tinue their valiant fight against the beast—we 
must be ready to prosecute those who mur-
dered innocents and pillaged a sovereign land. 
Putin’s war is not an act of defense. It is a 
calculated and brutal slaughter of ordinary 
people who sought only to build up their pre-
cious democracy. 
Putin has shed any semblance of humanity. 
He is a monster with the blood of freedom-lov-
ing people on his hands. 
When justice comes, let us be prepared with 
all that we need to sentence these evildoers to 
the punishments they deserve.

CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF 
KAROLE WHITE 
HON. TIM WALBERG 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. WALBERG. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor and celebrate the career of Ms. 
Karole White, who served as president and 
CEO of the Michigan Association of Broad-
casters for over 36 incredible years. 
Karole has dedicated her career to organi-
zations that have bettered Michigan commu-
nities and businesses. Under her leadership, 
MAB grew from a group with minimal re-
sources, to one of the most respected and ro-
bust trade associations in the state. 
Karole’s leadership helped the MAB inte-
grate into all areas of the broadcasting indus-
try. Her advocacy extended from the smallest 
high school newsroom to the largest radio sta-
tions in the state. Currently, nearly 90 percent 
of individuals, companies, and organizations 
affiliated with broadcasting in Michigan have 
joined the MAB. 
Karole’s expertise has made her an essen-
tial part of the broadcasting industry, and she 
has built strong relationships across the field, 
not just in our state but around the country. 
When she announced her retirement in Janu-
ary, we knew that the industry was losing one 
of its greatest advocates. I ask my colleagues 
to join me in congratulating her and wishing 
her well in her retirement. After decades of 
service, she surely deserves it, and I will al-
ways count it a privilege to call her my friend.

HIGHLAND

HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to celebrate the 
Highland Springs Springers Boys Basketball 
Team for winning the Class 5 State Cham-
pionship title. 
This title run was a tremendous achieve-
ment, as it resulted in the team’s fourth state 
championship and first since 2007. The 
Springers won in the last seconds of the game 
with the final score being 63–62. 
The Springers’ win was earned through 
months of hard work. After a season of hard- 
fought wins and a remarkable record of 23–4, 
these young men closed out the championship 
game in style, securing the win in the final 
seconds of the game with stifling defense. I 
am certain that these young men and their 
championship achievement will be remem-
bered in the Henrico community for years to 
come. 
On behalf of Virginia’s Fourth Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate Principal 
Kenneth White, Coach Reggie Tennyson, and 
the Highland Springs Springers Boys Basket-
ball Team for their remarkable championship 
season.

TRIBUTE 
TO 
THE 
NATIONAL 
CHAMPION USC WOMEN’S BAS-
KETBALL TEAM 
HON. JAMES E. CLYBURN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. CLYBURN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to pay tribute to the NCAA Women’s 
National Basketball Champions for 2022. The 
University of South Carolina Gamecocks have 
played with tremendous heart 
and 
skill 
throughout this season, earning the team its 
second national title. 
The Gamecocks have been ranked number 
one the entire season and lost just two games 
by slim margins. During the NCAA tour-
nament, they beat No. 8 seed Miami, No. 5 
seed University of North Carolina, No. 10 seed 
Creighton and No. 1 seed Louisville, before 
taking on No. 2 seed and perennial power-
house University of Connecticut (UConn). 
UConn had been in the Final Four for 14 
consecutive years. USC made the Sweet 16 
every year since 2014. In 2017, USC claimed 
their first national championship. The next 
year, UConn eliminated USC when they met 
the last time in the tournament. The Game-
cocks were in a prime position to win the tour-
nament in 2020, but it was cancelled due to 
the COVID–19 pandemic. Last year, USC was 
eliminated in the Final Four. 
Head Coach Dawn Staley and the USC 
players were determined that 2022 was going 
to be their year. They delivered with a 64–49 
victory on April 3 in Minneapolis, delivering 
UConn their first ever loss in the champion-
ship game. 
I can’t say enough about the leadership of 
Coach Staley. The Philadelphia native, and 
former college, WNBA, and Olympic basket-
ball stand-out, has led USC’s team since 
2008. She built the program from scratch, and 
by the 2013–2014 season, the team won the 
SEC Conference and was the top ranked 
team nationally. Under her leadership, the 
Gamecocks have won six SEC regular season 
and SEC tournament championships, made it 
to eight Sweet Sixteens and four Final Fours, 
and now, won two national championships. 
Coach Staley achieved all of this while serv-
ing as the U.S. Women’s National Olympic 
Team head coach from 2017 to 2021, leading 
that team to a perfect 45–0 record and win-
ning a gold medal. This year she received the 
Naismith Award as the best coach in the Na-
tion for the second time and has earned the 
distinction of being the first Black coach in 
men’s or women’s Division I basketball history 
to win more than one national championship. 
Coach Staley led a remarkable team with 
the starting line-up of No. 1 Zia Cooke, a jun-
ior guard from Toledo, Ohio; No. 3 Destanni 
Henderson, a senior guard from Fort Myers, 
Florida; No. 4 Aliyah Boston, a junior forward 
from St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands; No. 5

Georgia; and, No. 12 Brea Beal, a junior

A special congratulations to Aliyah Boston, 
who achieved her 30th double-double with 11 
points and 16 rebounds in the championship 
game, earning her the Final Four Most Out-
standing Player. This honor completes her 
sweep of the top national awards. She is also 
the recipient of the 2022 John R. Wooden 
Award and the Player of the Year awards from 
Naismith, The Associated Press, the Women’s 
Basketball Coaches Association, and the U.S. 
Basketball Writers Association. She was also 
the SEC Player of the Year and the Lisa Les-
lie Award winner. 
Other accolades include Aliyah Boston, Zia 
Cooke, and Destanni Henderson all making 
the Final Four All-Tournament Team. Hender-
son scored a career-high 26 points, the most 
of any player in the championship game, and 
Cooke also provided 11 points and 5 re-
bounds. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you and my col-
leagues to join me in celebrating this remark-
able University of South Carolina Women’s 
Basketball team. I have had the pleasure of 
following their season and seeing them play 
many times in person. Their extraordinary tal-
ent and leadership made it exciting to see 
their hard work rewarded with the national 
title. Go Gamecocks.

Program, providing his hard work and dedica-
tion to the 6,500 veterans and dependents 
within his assigned region of the state, which 
includes Camden, Laclede, Phelps, Pulaski, 
and Texas counties. He is being recognized 
for his outstanding work assisting a Missouri 
veteran win an appeal after the Department of 
Veterans Affairs rejected his medical claim re-
lated to her herbicide exposure during the 
Vietnam War. Harold diligently assisted in fil-
ing several appeals. Seven years after the ini-
tial claim was filed, the Board of Veterans Ap-
peals awarded the veteran approximately 
$223,000 in backpay. 
Prior to the Missouri Veterans Commission, 
Harold King served his country for 24 years, 
working in Armor and Psychological Oper-
ations and deploying three times, including in 
Operations Desert Shield, Desert Storm with 
the 1st Infantry Division, and Operation Iraqi 
Freedom. Harold King retired as a Major in the 
United States Army. 
It is a great honor to recognize Veteran 
Service Officer and Retired Major Harold King 
for his steadfast leadership and continuous 
devotion to his community. Please join me in 
thanking him for his service to our Nation and 
the Great State of Missouri.

PAYING TRIBUTE TO DR. THOMAS 
HILDEBRAND 
HON. JAMES R. BAIRD 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. BAIRD. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
pay tribute to an incredible man and member 
of our community, Dr. Thomas Hildebrand. 
Tom was a dedicated member of his com-
munity who joined the U.S. Army Special 
Forces after graduating Seymour High School 
in 1977 where he served as a medic, weap-
ons expert, and Army Ranger. 
The Bible tells us that the greatest among 
us is a servant, and I can think of no better 
way to describe Tom. 
During medical school, Tom spent his free 
time volunteering for the local hospice, com-
mitted to comforting the patients and their 
families during those final precious moments. 
After nearly 20 years of military service, 
Tom’s commitment and sense of duty was 
repurposed, and he threw himself into tire-
lessly advocating for Hoosier veterans, arrang-
ing appointments and transportation, and con-
necting veterans with support groups. 
His dedication to serving White County vet-
erans knew no bounds, and it was not out of 
the ordinary to see Tom working into the late 
hours of the night or weekends to help his fel-
low veterans. 
In the military, our credo is ‘‘no man left be-
hind,’’ and Tom fulfilled that mission both in 
his service to this country and in his decade 
of service to Hoosier veterans. 
Our country and our community are better 
for having had Tom in them, and I appreciate 
the opportunity to remember this outstanding 
Hoosier.

HONORING TOM GOODKIND 
HON. JERROLD NADLER 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of Tom Goodkind, 
a true renaissance man and a beloved mem-
ber of the Lower Manhattan community. 
Mr. Goodkind, who passed away from a 
chronic degenerative illness in February 2019 
at the age of 65, will be honored by the 
Church Street School for Music and Art for his 
contributions to the school and community on 
April 8, 2022. 
An accountant by training, he moved to the 
Financial District in the late ’80s and quickly 
became active in the Battery Park City com-
munity, Manhattan Community Board 1 (on 
which he served for decades) and local polit-
ical clubs. Mr. Goodkind was a fierce advocate 
for expanding and retaining affordable housing 
in Lower Manhattan and produced com-
prehensive reports on rent stabilization and 
the neighborhood’s affordable housing supply 
as the chair of Manhattan Community Board 
1’s Housing Task Force. He also advocated 
for the 5 World Trade Center site to include a 
fair number of affordable units, with set-asides 
for creative artists and September 11th sur-
vivors and responders. 
In addition to his dedication for community 
activism, his passion for music was a guiding 
force throughout his life. Mr. Goodkind had 
stints as a punk rocker and a music venue 
promoter before co-founding the acclaimed 
band The Washington Squares, a neo-folk trio 
that received a Grammy nomination. After the 
September 
11th 
terrorist 
attacks, 
Mr. 
Goodkind looked to the healing power of 
music to help rebuild Lower Manhattan. He 
founded and conducted the TriBattery Pops, 
the first NYC downtown all-volunteer commu-
nity band in a century, that became an ever- 
present, animated staple at local community 
events. Mr. Goodkind remained an ardent sup-
porter of local institutions that celebrated musi-
cal arts and strived to share the joy of music 
with New Yorkers and beyond. 
Mr. Goodkind’s chronic degenerative illness 
was linked to the exposure to toxic dust that 
hung over Manhattan in the aftermath of the 
September 11th attacks. The toll of the toxins 
and the subsequent illnesses they wrought to 
not only those who worked on the pile but also 
residents in my district like Mr. Goodkind who 
returned to their homes, cleaned up and revi-
talized this neighborhood laid bare the need 
for the federal government to provide survivors 
with quality health care and financial support. 
I was proud that after over a decade of fight-
ing we passed the James Zadruga 9/11 
Health and Compensation Act of 2010 and its 
reauthorization in 2015, and we created and 
fully funded the September 11th Victim Com-
pensation Fund for survivors and responders. 
Mr. Goodkind is survived by his wife Jill, 
and daughters Olivia and Nicole who continue 
to further his legacy through their advocacy 
work for affordable housing, September llth 
survivor issues and support for the arts. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to honor Tom 
Goodkind and his significant impacts on music 
and the lives of residents in Lower Manhattan 
that will be felt for years to come.

CELEBRATING THE WORK OF 
LILLIAN TAMAYO 
HON. DEBBIE WASSERMAN SCHULTZ 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Ms. 
WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ. 
Madam 
Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I rise to 
recognize the tremendous career and mean-
ingful work of Lillian Tamayo, President and 
CEO of Planned Parenthood of South, East, 
and North Florida. 
Planned Parenthood health centers provide 
millions of people in the U.S. with contracep-
tion, testing and treatment for sexually trans-
mitted infections, lifesaving cancer screenings, 
and safe, legal abortion. Many Planned Par-
enthood patients are low-income, people of 
color, LGBTQ+ people, undocumented immi-
grants, or those who live in rural areas and 
underserved communities. They empower 
people to make informed decisions about their 
healthcare and lead healthier lives. 
Lillian Tamayo served more than two dec-
ades in her position at Planned Parenthood, 
working to protect the vital right to bodily au-
tonomy and self-determination. During Ms. 
Tamayo’s tenure, the organization saw a more 
than fivefold increase in patients getting the 
care they need. When she took the helm, 
Planned Parenthood had four health centers in 
Florida and now there are 11. Under her stew-
ardship as the first Latina CEO in the federa-
tion, Planned Parenthood has greatly ex-
panded access to reproductive care for all Flo-
ridians and especially among marginalized 
communities and populations. 
Never has the work done by compassionate 
individuals like Ms. Tamayo been more impor-
tant. As a woman’s reproductive freedom is in-
creasingly threatened in states like Florida, 
Planned Parenthood continues to be a beacon 
of advocacy and a stalwart defender of wom-
en’s healthcare. 
Lillian Tamayo is a selfless and devoted 
public servant whose commitment to ensuring 
access to women’s healthcare is admirable. I 
wish her a heartfelt congratulations on her ex-
emplary work at Planned Parenthood, and I 
am immensely grateful for her invaluable work 
to improve the lives of those in Florida’s 23rd 
Congressional District, the state of Florida as 
a whole, and beyond.

RECOGNIZING THE ANNUAL CHAI 
DINNER AND DANCE 
HON. BRIAN HIGGINS 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, today I rise in honor of the Council of Herit-
age and Arts of India (CHAI). CHAI is a local 
nonprofit organization that promotes Indian 
culture, arts, and heritage here in Western 
New York. Their annual dinner and dance 
brings together friends and family to celebrate 
the organization’s cultural and community rela-
tions. 
Formed in 2018, CHAI serves the Western 
New York Community by building bridges 
among Indian and non-Indian communities. 
Their work recognizes the important role that 
culture plays in nation-building and represents 
a set of shared values, goals, and practices. 
CHAI helps the Western New York Indian 
American Community better understand its 
needs and provides access to critical govern-
ment 
resources. 
Additionally, 
they 
have 
worked with Western New York’s international 
community, in partnership with government of-
ficials, to assist with and resolve immigration 
issues. 
CHAI puts an emphasis on their charity 
work. During the pandemic, they raised more 
than $7,000 toward PPE for hospitals and 
frontline workers in the Buffalo area. The prac-
tice of ‘‘anna danna’’, or ‘‘offering of food’’, is 
common within Indian society and continues to 
be an important aspect of their culture. In ad-
dition to PPE, CHAI also provided groceries 
for international students at the University of 
Buffalo who lost their jobs due to the pan-
demic. 
CHAI operates under the guidance of Exec-
utive Director Sibu Nair and a dedicated exec-
utive committee. The organization has tremen-
dous community and government support, 
which allows them to complete major commu-
nity projects in addition to their distinguished 
charitable work and community relations ef-
forts. 
CHAI recently installed a monument for Ma-
hatma Gandhi in the Town of Amherst. The 
memorial is a gift to the town that symbolizes 
peace and friendship. It serves as a landmark 
for the Western New York Indian-American 
community and further connects the United 
States and Indian democracies. In 2022, CHAI 
will initiate the development of an Indian Herit-
age Center here in Western New York. 
This year, CHAI is gathering to celebrate 
the Indian American community here in West-
ern New York at their annual dinner and 
dance. Family and friends of CHAI will come 
together to showcase the organization’s suc-
cess in serving the community and helping to 
provide resources to those in need. 
CHAI’s mission to celebrate the diverse her-
itage of India has helped many people across 
the Western New York Community, because 
of their commitment to cultural beliefs and val-
ues. I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing CHAI’s work serving the community, 
connecting our cultures, and celebrating our 
democracies.

MAR-

STATE CHAMPIONSHIP BASKET-
BALL TEAM 
HON. A. DONALD McEACHIN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. MCEACHIN. Madam Speaker, I would 
like to take this opportunity to celebrate the 
John Marshall Justices Boys Basketball Team 
for winning the Class 2 State Championship 
title. 
This title run was an outstanding achieve-
ment, resulting in the team’s third state bas-
ketball championship since 2014. In their 
semifinal contest the Justices won by a score 
of 92–53, and in the championship game won 
82–43. The players’ work ethic and winning 
mentality truly shined. 
The Justices’ win was not earned just on 
the day of the game but was built on months 
of hard work. After a season of spectacular 
victories and a 22–4 record going into the title 
game, these young men closed out the cham-
pionship game in style. I am certain that these 
young men and their state title achievement 
will be remembered in the Richmond commu-
nity for years to come. 
On behalf of Virginia’s Fourth Congressional 
District, I would like to congratulate Principal 
Monica Murray, Coach Ty White, and the John 
Marshall Justices Boys Basketball Team for 
their remarkable championship season.

HONORING WBT RADIO 
HON. DAN BISHOP 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to WBT 
Radio on the 100th anniversary of its found-
ing. For over a century, WBT has helped in-
form and entertain residents of the City of 
Charlotte—my hometown. Charles Kuralt, Billy 
Graham, Rush Limbaugh, and Charlotte’s 
John Hancock are just some of the voices that 
have come through WBT’s airwaves in the 
past, and that tradition continues in the broad-
casts of names like Bo Thompson, Vince 
Coakley, and Pete Kaliner. 
WBT traces its origins from early broadcasts 
by radio amateurs who set up a transmitter in 
an abandoned chicken coop. These sporadic 
transmissions later expanded into playing pho-
nograph records over the air, and then into the 
broadcasts we know and love today. The U.S. 
Department of Commerce officially granted 
WBT a broadcast license on April 10, 1922. At 
the time, it was only the third licensed radio 
station in the United States and the first in the 
entire Southeast. 
I am proud to honor WBT Radio on their 
100th anniversary. Here’s to 100 more years 
of radio excellence from the station heard 
‘‘from Maine to Miami.’’

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF DONALD ROSS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life and legacy of renowned golf 
course architect Donald Ross. This marks the 
125th year since his birth. 
Although the total number is not known, Mr. 
Ross designed around 400 courses over his 
lifetime which have been home to more than 
100 U.S. national championships. In 1900, he 
was hired by James Walker Tufts to oversee 
the construction of four of the nine courses at 
the Pinehurst resort. Mr. Ross is most well- 
known for crafting the legendary Pinehurst No. 
2. This course is held by many to be one of 
the 
most 
well-designed 
and 
challenging 
courses in the U.S. and the world. Mr. Ross’ 
designs led Pinehurst to become the center of 
golf’s rise to popularity in the early twentieth 
century and established a tradition of excel-
lence that continues to serve as a source of 
pride for all in our community. 
I would like to extend my most heartfelt ap-
preciation to Mr. Ross for his committed and 
impactful leadership and achievements as a 
golf course architect. His work has greatly 
benefitted those in North Carolina and across 
the U.S., and I join our entire community in 
honoring his extraordinary life 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the life and legacy of Mr. Donald 
Ross.

HON. G. K. BUTTERFIELD

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to commemorate the 125th anniversary of 
Voorhees College in Denmark, South Caro-
lina. 
On April 14, 1897, Voorhees College was 
founded by 23-year-old Elizabeth Evelyn 
Wright as Denmark Industrial School. A native 
of Georgia, Ms. Wright went on to study at 
Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee Institute in 
Alabama. Knowing the importance of edu-
cation, Ms. Wright moved to South Carolina 
and started the first of several schools for 
Blacks in the rural area of southeastern South 
Carolina.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E374 
April 7, 2022 
On May 14, 1902, the Denmark Industrial 
School was renamed to Voorhees Industrial 
School after Ralph Voorhees, a New Jersey 
philanthropist, gave Ms. Wright $5,000 for the 
purchase of 280 acres of land on the outskirts 
of Denmark The generous donation allowed 
the school to expand. 
In 1924, the American Church Institute for 
Negroes, which was a part of the Episcopal 
Church, agreed to support the school begin-
ning a long relationship that continues to this 
day. In 1947, Voorhees Industrial School be-
came a junior college and was renamed Voor-
hees School and Junior College after the in-
dustrial department was discontinued. The jun-
ior college was accredited in 1946 by the 
Southern Association of Colleges and Schools 
and in 1949 it became the first Black college 
in South Carolina to be recognized by the re-
gional body. 
In 1962, the school became Voorhees Col-
lege and five years later it became a senior 
degree granting institution. Shortly thereafter, 
it received full accreditation as a liberal arts 
college from the Southern Association of Col-
leges and Schools 
For the last 125 years, Voorhees College 
has educated thousands of students. Its edu-
cational scope has expanded from the days of 
teaching vocational skills to becoming a liberal 
arts college to now having a presence in 
Ghana, Liberia and other countries in West Af-
rica. 
Today, 125 years after Denmark Industrial 
School was founded, it will be renamed once 
again to Voorhees University with the start of 
a Masters programs. 
Madam Speaker, today, I ask that my col-
leagues join me in celebrating the 125th anni-
versary of Voorhees University, its history, and 
its founder, Elizabeth Evelyn Wright. 
HONORING 
THE 
LIFE 
OF 
U.S. 
ARMY STAFF SERGEANT GRADY 
H. CANUP 
HON. JEFF DUNCAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mr. DUNCAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of U.S. Army Staff Sergeant 
Grady H. Canup, who was killed in action dur-
ing World War II and whose remains have fi-
nally been identified. 
Sergeant Canup of Greenwood, South 
Carolina, was assigned to Company C, 12th 
Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division at the 
age of thirty. His unit served as part of the 
Hu¨rtgen Forest offensive where, on November 
14, 1944, he was killed by enemy artillery fire. 
Sgt. Canup’s remains were declared non-re-
coverable in December of 1951, despite great 
efforts by the American Graves Registration 
Command to account for missing American 
soldiers. 
In 2019, Sgt. Canup’s identification tag was 
found in the area where a set of unidentified 
remains had been found decades earlier. 
Those unidentified remains were disinterred 
from a cemetery in Europe for further inves-
tigation in 2019. The Defense POW/MIA Ac-
counting Agency and the Armed Forces Med-
ical Examiner System were able to confirm 
that the remains belonged to Sgt. Canup ear-
lier this year. Sgt. Canup will be laid to rest at 
Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Anderson 
County on April 10, 2022. On the Walls of the 
Missing at Netherlands American Cemetery, a 
rosette will be placed by Sgt. Canup’s name 
since he has now been accounted for. 
It brings me comfort knowing that after sev-
enty-eight years, Sgt. Canup’s remains will be 
reunited with his family. I am grateful for the 
work of the Defense POW/MIA Accounting 
Agency in making this possible. This identifica-
tion of remains allows for another opportunity 
to reflect on the many heroes who lost their 
lives defending freedom across the world dur-
ing World War II. I am reminded of the verse 
John 15:13: ‘‘Greater love has no one than 
this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends.’’ 
We are blessed to live in a country where so 
many heroes, like Sgt. Canup, are willing to 
wear the uniform to defend our freedoms. 
Madam Speaker, it is a privilege to be able 
to serve the Third District of South Carolina 
and to honor the lives of those lost in conflict, 
like Sergeant Canup. My thoughts and prayers 
are with his family and friends during this time.

HONORING THE LIFE OF DR. 
ROBERT HAGEN 
HON. VICTORIA SPARTZ 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 7, 2022 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the memory of the late Dr. Robert 
Hagen. 
Dr. Hagen moved to Lafayette, IN in 1987 to 
pursue an opportunity with the Lafayette Or-
thopedic Clinic, where he worked as an ortho-
pedic surgeon for 34 years until his retirement 
in 2019. 
Dr. Hagen was committed to his neighbors 
and community. In 1985, Dr. Hagen started 
Unity Health Care in Northern Indiana. Addi-
tionally, he worked with the Purdue campus of 
the IU School of Medicine, and was a team 
physician for two local high schools for over 
25 years. He was state president of the Indi-
ana Orthopedic Society in 2000, a member of 
the Board of Councilors of the Academy of Or-
thopedic Surgeons from 2011 to 2017, and 
United Way campaign chairman in 2017. 
Dr. Hagen dedicated a big part of his life 
fighting for health care reforms to improve 
health care value and make it more affordable 
for all Hoosiers and all Americans. His efforts 
will not be forgotten.
