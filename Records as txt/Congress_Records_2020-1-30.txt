No. 20 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
We give You thanks, O God, for giv-
ing us another day. 
As the Congress enters a long week-
end following a contentious period of 
time on the Hill, give them rest. As 
they encounter the voices of constitu-
ents back home, may all their ex-
changes be fruitful and promise encour-
agement toward productive work here 
in the people’s House when they re-
turn. 
May the power of Your truth and our 
faith in Your providence give them all 
the confidence they must have to do 
the good work required for service to 
our Nation. 
May all that is done be for Your 
greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. The Chair has exam-
ined the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings and announces to the House 
her approval thereof. 
Pursuant to clause 1, rule I, the Jour-
nal stands approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Michigan (Mrs. LAW-
RENCE) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. LAWRENCE led the Pledge of 
Allegiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to five requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
47TH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V. 
WADE 
(Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the 47th anni-
versary of the landmark Supreme 
Court decision, Roe v. Wade, that ulti-
mately gave women the right to con-
trol their own reproductive health. 
Today, that choice is under attack as 
the current administration and several 
States have enacted bans to restrict a 
woman’s right to control her own body. 
This year proves to be a pivotal year 
for access to abortion. Next month, the 
Supreme Court will hear arguments in 
the case of June Medical Services v. 
Gee. 
As co-chair of the Democratic Wom-
en’s Caucus, I firmly believe that every 
woman has the right to decide when, 
how, if, and with whom to begin or ex-
pand her family. That is why we must 
push back against those who wish to 
take away this legal right. 
The public is overwhelmingly in 
favor of protecting Row v. Wade—near-
ly 8 in 10 Americans. 
In the face of increased attacks on 
women’s right to choose, I continue to 
fight for the reproductive healthcare 
that all women deserve. 
f 
ROOTING FOR THE KANSAS CITY 
CHIEFS IN SUPER BOWL LIV 
(Mr. MARSHALL asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. MARSHALL. Mr. Speaker, it 
seems like just yesterday, but it was 50 
years ago that my dad and I sat down 
to watch Super Bowl IV. We watched 
on a black-and-white television, and we 
watched the Chiefs beat the Vikings 23– 
7. 
We saw Lenny Dawson making long 
passes to Otis Taylor, one of the great-
est linebacking corps in history domi-
nate the game, and we saw Jan 
Stenerud kick three field goals. 
This weekend at Super Bowl LIV, the 
Chiefs Nation will be coming to Miami, 
Florida, and I am here on behalf of the 
Kansas delegation to wish Coach Andy 
Reid and our MVP quarterback, Pat-
rick Mahomes, the very best and that 
they have the best game of their life. 
And as the Chiefs Nation joins the 
folks in Miami, I want everyone to 
stand and join us in rooting the Chiefs 
Nation on and remember that we are 
the land of the free and the home of the 
Chiefs. 
f 
UNITED STATES-MEXICO-CANADA 
AGREEMENT 
(Mr. CARTWRIGHT asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, we 
have cause for bipartisan celebration. 
The USMCA trade deal was signed into 
law yesterday. 
I want to congratulate the Demo-
cratic House negotiating team and 
thank them for their hard work for the 
better part of a year to make this a 
better deal. 
Heading the push to lower drug 
prices and strip out a massive give-
away to Big Pharma were Representa-
tives EARL BLUMENAUER and JAN SCHA-
KOWSKY. 
Representatives JIMMY
GOMEZ
and 
MIKE THOMPSON handled the negotia-
tion to strengthen labor rights in the 
deal, and they got it to where they 
earned an AFL–CIO endorsement. 
Representatives SUSAN BONAMICI and 
JOHN LARSON improved protections for 
clean air and clean water in the deal.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H716 
January 30, 2020 
And Representatives TERRI SEWELL 
and ROSA DELAURO strengthened the 
all-important enforcement provisions 
in this deal. 
While we can’t fix NAFTA overnight, 
this is a good start, and it will help our 
farmers and manufacturers create jobs. 
So I am glad we came together and 
passed this deal. 
f 
HONORING TIMOTHY SWEEZEY 
(Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speak-
er, I rise today to remember the life of 
Mr. Timothy Sweezey, who passed 
away on January 11 at the age of 50. 
At the time of his passing, he was 
serving as the city manager of Darien, 
in the First Congressional District of 
Georgia. In his own words, that posi-
tion was the dream job he always want-
ed. And, as city manager, Mr. Sweezey 
did an exceptional job managing the 
unique challenges in Darien, including 
multiple hurricanes, preserving histor-
ical buildings, and new developments 
in the downtown area. 
But nobody reaches their dream job 
without hard work. Prior to his time 
with the City of Darien, he worked as a 
substitute teacher, led city recreation 
departments, and headed a marine in-
stitute, all of which prepared him for 
his excellent public service in coastal 
Georgia. 
Mr. Sweezey is certainly leaving 
Darien a better place than he found it, 
and his work in the city will be missed. 
His family and friends will be in my 
thoughts and prayers during this most 
difficult time. 
f 
HONORING THE JEWISH FAMILY 
SERVICE 
MIGRANT 
FAMILY 
SHELTER 
(Mr. VARGAS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. VARGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today on behalf of the migrants and 
asylum-seekers who have been shel-
tered by Jewish Family Service of San 
Diego. 
On October 1, 2018, Jewish Family 
Service, along with other members of 
the San Diego Rapid Response Net-
work, heeded an important call. These 
organizations were alerted that, due to 
a drastic change in policy, women and 
children were being left on the side of 
the road. They were released with no-
where to go and no resources to get to 
their final destination. 
These nonprofits decided that they 
would not stand idly by and would as-
sist these deserted families. Despite all 
the obstacles the organizations faced, 
they dedicated themselves to wel-
coming the stranger. 
Jewish Family Service Shelter is now 
in its seventh location, where it has 
served 21,000 individuals. The shelters 
have provided a safe and welcoming 
place to sleep, fresh new clothes, warm 
meals, and travel assistance. 
I have had the opportunity to tour 
some of the facilities and believe they 
follow the teaching of Leviticus 19: 
‘‘You shall treat the alien who resides 
with you no differently than the na-
tives born among you. . . .’’ 
I thank Jewish Family Service and 
the organizations of the San Diego 
Rapid Response Network for their ef-
forts. 
f 
HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF BRIAN WINTER 
(Mr. NEWHOUSE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to remember and honor the life 
and service of retired Yakima County 
Sheriff Brian Winter. Sheriff Winter 
spent his life dedicated to serving his 
community and his country. 
After graduating from Central Wash-
ington University, he joined the United 
States Marine Corps, where he served 
honorably in Operations Desert Shield 
and Iraqi Freedom. 
As Brian returned to central Wash-
ington and worked his way up in the 
police force, he became known for 
prioritizing safety and security in 
schools throughout the county, his 
ability to build lasting community re-
lationships, and creating meaningful 
connections with the Yakama Nation. 
Soon after being elected as sheriff, he 
was diagnosed with ALS. Despite his 
condition, he was determined to serve 
his full 4-year term, which he did. 
Up until the day he passed away on 
January 
25, 
2020, 
Sheriff 
Winter 
prioritized others before himself. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in 
keeping his wife and children in our 
prayers. 
His legacy throughout the Yakima 
Valley will not be forgotten. 
f 
HONORING ANN ELIZABETH 
CHRISTIAN ABRAMSON 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, the 
Virgin 
Islands 
is 
known 
for 
its 
queens—powerful, dynamic, passionate 
women who lead. We had Queen Coziah, 
who led the coal strikes; Queen Mary 
and ‘‘Bottom Belly,’’ who led the labor 
strikes. 
We lost one of our queens last week, 
Ann Elizabeth Christian Abramson, 
who was a loyal, fearless, compas-
sionate leader, an entrepreneur, and a 
stateswoman. 
She was born in 1924, the last of 15 
children. Ever industrious, even as a 
child, she left school for several years 
to help her family when they were in 
need and then went back. 
She 
was 
a 
businesswoman 
extraordinaire—taxicab business, con-
struction company, bus company, ag-
gregate owner, and the list goes on. 
She was appointed to our municipal 
council, where she was the only woman 
to serve during her time, as well as to 
our legislature. 
She gave tremendously to our com-
munity, but I know she also gave to 
me. When I went to this fearless leader 
to ask her for support, she not only 
gave me her support, but she gave me 
her time. 
I saw how she cared for her islands 
and her people. She was chair of the 
state Republican Party and helped the 
Girl Scouts, hospitals, and chamber of 
commerce. She did it all. 
Mr. Speaker, we will remember her 
legacy and hope she rests well. 
f 
NATIONAL BLOOD DONOR MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, President 
Richard Nixon designated January as 
National Blood Donor Month. 
The decision to choose January for 
this 
occasion 
was 
no 
coincidence. 
There is often a shortage of blood in 
January. In the winter months, eligible 
donors don’t give blood as frequently 
because both the holidays as well as 
the cold and flu season are quickly ap-
proaching. 
No matter the time of year, donating 
blood can help save a life, and there is 
always a demand. According to the 
American Red Cross, someone in the 
United States needs blood every 2 sec-
onds, and approximately 36,000 units of 
red blood cells are needed each and 
every day. 
However, less than 38 percent of the 
U.S. population is eligible to give 
blood, and only 3 percent of those indi-
viduals donate annually. 
There are often opportunities to do-
nate blood right here on Capitol Hill, 
and the Red Cross is hosting its next 
blood drive on Wednesday, February 5, 
in the Ford Building. I would like to 
encourage those eligible to take some 
time out of their day to make a dif-
ference in the lives of others by donat-
ing blood. 
f 
CLEAN ENERGY AGENDA 
(Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend her remarks.) 
Ms. KUSTER of New Hampshire. Mr. 
Speaker, climate change poses a seri-
ous threat to virtually every aspect of 
our lives, particularly in my State of 
New Hampshire, where our economy is 
deeply tied to nature. 
That is why, earlier this week, I was 
proud to unveil my Clean Energy Agen-
da with climate experts from across my 
district to outline policies and bills 
that Congress can pass this year to 
move the United States toward a clean 
energy economy.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H717 
January 30, 2020 
I have prioritized 25 bills, most of 
them bipartisan, that identify areas 
where Republicans and Democrats can 
work together to protect our planet 
and create good jobs. 
From investing in energy efficiency 
to dramatically ramping up the deploy-
ment 
of 
renewable 
energy 
and 
decarbonizing our transportation sec-
tor, my agenda includes a wide range of 
bills that can be passed if we find the 
political will to act. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues on the Energy and Com-
merce Committee to advance policies 
that pave a pathway toward a clean en-
ergy future. 
f 
HONORING EARL AND DORIS 
SORRELLS 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today to honor Earl and 
Doris Sorrells, a remarkable couple 
who dedicated their lives to bettering 
their community. 
Earl passed away on January 2 and 
was preceded in death by his wife, 
Doris, last year, leaving a hole in the 
hearts of many. Since then, their be-
loved town of Raymond, Illinois, has 
shown a little less bright. 
Almost everyone in town knew Earl. 
He ran a radio show that aired at 5:30 
every morning, dedicated to the latest 
in Illinois agriculture. Off the air, Earl 
and Doris and their entire family 
worked hard running their small busi-
ness in Raymond. 
I knew Earl and Doris for over 25 
years. They were some of the most gen-
erous people I have ever met, giving 
back in every way to their community, 
not only with their financial contribu-
tions, but with their time and talents 
as well. There is nothing that made 
them happier than their hometown of 
Raymond, Illinois—except, maybe, the 
St. Louis Cardinals. 
Earl and Doris were very well loved 
by me and by everyone in central Illi-
nois. They are missed immensely.

MERCHANT MARINERS OF WORLD 
WAR II CONGRESSIONAL GOLD 
MEDAL ACT OF 2019 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, pursuant 
to House Resolution 811, I call up the 
bill (H.R. 550) to award a Congressional 
Gold Medal, collectively, to the United 
States Merchant Mariners of World 
War II, in recognition of their dedi-
cated and vital service during World 
War II, with the Senate amendment 
thereto, and ask for its immediate con-
sideration. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
CUELLAR). The Clerk will designate the 
Senate amendment. 
Senate amendment: 
Strike all after the enacting clause and in-
sert the following: 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Merchant Mari-
ners of World War II Congressional Gold Medal 
Act of 2019’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) 2019 marked the 74th anniversary of Allied 
victory in World War II. 
(2) The United States Merchant Marine (in 
this section referred to as the ‘‘Merchant Ma-
rine’’) was integral in providing the link be-
tween domestic production and the fighting 
forces overseas, providing combat equipment, 
fuel, food, commodities, and raw materials to 
troops stationed abroad. 
(3) Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King acknowl-
edged the indispensability of the Merchant Ma-
rine to the victory in a 1945 letter stating that, 
without the support of the Merchant Marine, 
‘‘the Navy could not have accomplished its mis-
sion’’. 
(4) President, and former Supreme Commander 
of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower acknowledged that ‘‘through the 
prompt delivery of supplies and equipment to 
our armed forces overseas, and of cargoes rep-
resenting economic and military aid to friendly 
nations, the American Merchant Marine has ef-
fectively helped to strengthen the forces of free-
dom throughout the world’’. 
(5) Military missions and war planning were 
contingent upon the availability of resources 
and the Merchant Marine played a vital role in 
this regard, ensuring the efficient and reliable 
transoceanic transport of military equipment 
and both military and civilian personnel. 
(6) The Merchant Marine provided for the 
successful transport of resources and personnel 
despite consistent and ongoing exposure to 
enemy combatants from both the air and the 
sea, including from enemy bomber squadrons, 
submarines, and naval mines. 
(7) The efforts of the Merchant Marine were 
not without sacrifices as the Merchant Marine 
likely bore a higher per-capita casualty rate 
than any of the military branches during the 
war. 
(8) The Merchant Marine proved to be an in-
strumental asset on an untold number of occa-
sions, participating in every landing operation 
by the United States Marine Corps, from Gua-
dalcanal to Okinawa. 
(9) The Merchant Marine provided the bulk 
tonnage of material necessary for the invasion 
of Normandy, an invasion which, according to a 
1944 New York Times article, ‘‘would not have 
been possible without the Merchant Marine’’. 
(10) In assessing the performance of the Mer-
chant Marine, General Eisenhower stated, 
‘‘every man in this Allied command is quick to 
express his admiration for the loyalty, courage, 
and fortitude of the officers and men of the 
Merchant Marine. We count upon their effi-
ciency and their utter devotion to duty as we do 
our own; they have never failed us’’. 
(11) During a September 1944 speech, Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt stated that the Mer-
chant Marine had ‘‘delivered the goods when 
and where needed in every theater of operations 
and across every ocean in the biggest, the most 
difficult, and dangerous transportation job ever 
undertaken. As time goes on, there will be great-
er public understanding of our merchant fleet’s 
record during this war’’. 
(12) The feats and accomplishments of the 
Merchant Marine are deserving of broader pub-
lic recognition. 
(13) The United States will be forever grateful 
and indebted to these merchant mariners for 
their effective, reliable, and courageous trans-
port of goods and resources in enemy territory 
throughout theaters of every variety in World 
War II. 
(14) The goods and resources transported by 
the Merchant Marine saved thousands of lives 
and enabled the Allied Powers to claim victory 
in World War II. 
(15) The Congressional Gold Medal would be 
an appropriate way to shed further light on the 
service of the merchant mariners in World War 
II and the instrumental role they played in win-
ning that war. 
(16) Many students of the Merchant Marine 
Academy lost their lives as they sailed through 
enemy-controlled waters or unloaded cargo in 
overseas combat areas, and, as a result, the 
United States Merchant Marine Academy is the 
only institution among the 5 Federal academies 
to be authorized to carry a battle standard as 
part of its color guard. 
SEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL. 
(a) AWARD AUTHORIZED.—The Speaker of the 
House of Representatives and the President pro 
tempore of the Senate shall make appropriate 
arrangements for the award, on behalf of Con-
gress, of a single gold medal of appropriate de-
sign to the United States merchant mariners of 
World War II, in recognition of their dedicated 
and vital service during World War II. 
(b) DESIGN AND STRIKING.—For the purposes 
of the award described in subsection (a), the 
Secretary of the Treasury (in this Act referred to 
as the ‘‘Secretary’’) shall strike the gold medal 
with suitable emblems, devices, and inscriptions, 
to be determined by the Secretary. 
(c) AMERICAN MERCHANT MARINE MUSEUM.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—Following the award of the 
gold medal under subsection (a), the gold medal 
shall be given to the American Merchant Marine 
Museum, where it will be available for display 
as appropriate and available for research. 
(2) SENSE
OF
CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that the American Merchant Marine 
Museum should make the gold medal given to 
the Museum under paragraph (1) available for 
display elsewhere, particularly at appropriate 
locations associated with the United States Mer-
chant Marine and that preference should be 
given to locations affiliated with the United 
States Merchant Marine. 
SEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS. 
Under such regulations as the Secretary may 
prescribe, the Secretary may strike and sell du-
plicates in bronze of the gold medal struck 
under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the 
costs of the medals, including labor, materials, 
dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses. 
SEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS. 
(a) NATIONAL MEDALS.—Medals struck under 
this Act are national medals for purposes of 
chapter 51 of title 31, United States Code. 
(b) NUMISMATIC ITEMS.—For purposes of sec-
tion 5134 of title 31, United States Code, all med-
als struck under this Act shall be considered to 
be numismatic items. 
MOTION TO CONCUR 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will designate the motion. 
The text of the motion is as follows: 
Mr. ENGEL moves that the House concur 
in the Senate amendment to H.R. 550 with 
the amendments specified in section 4 of 
House Resolution 811. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to House Resolution 811, the ques-
tion shall be divided among two House 
amendments. Pursuant to section 3(a) 
of House Resolution 811, the portion of 
the divided question comprising the 
amendment specified in section 4(a) of 
House Resolution 811 shall be consid-
ered first. 
The text of House amendment to 
Senate amendment specified in section 
4(a) of House Resolution 811 is as fol-
lows:

H718 
January 30, 2020 
In the matter proposed to be inserted by 
the amendment of the Senate, strike sec-
tions 1, 2, and 3 and insert the following: 
TITLE I—NO WAR AGAINST IRAN ACT 
SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE. 
This title may be cited as the ‘‘No War 
Against Iran Act’’. 
SEC. 102. PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED MILI-
TARY FORCE IN OR AGAINST IRAN. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) The acquisition by the Government of 
Iran of a nuclear weapon would pose a grave 
threat to international peace and stability 
and the national security of the United 
States and United States allies, including 
Israel. 
(2) The Government of Iran is a leading 
state sponsor of terrorism, continues to ma-
terially support the regime of Bashar al- 
Assad, and is responsible for ongoing gross 
violations of the human rights of the people 
of Iran. 
(3) Article I of the United States Constitu-
tion requires the President to obtain author-
ization from Congress before engaging in war 
with Iran. 
(b) CLARIFICATION OF CURRENT LAW.—Noth-
ing in the Authorization for Use of Military 
Force (Public Law 107–40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 
note), the Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public 
Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), or any other 
provision of law enacted before the date of 
the enactment of this Act may be construed 
to provide authorization for the use of mili-
tary force against Iran. 
(c) PROHIBITION OF UNAUTHORIZED MILITARY 
FORCE IN OR AGAINST IRAN.— 
(1) IN
GENERAL.—Except as provided in 
paragraph (2), no Federal funds may be obli-
gated or expended for any use of military 
force in or against Iran unless Congress 
has— 
(A) declared war; or 
(B) enacted specific statutory authoriza-
tion for such use of military force after the 
date of the enactment of this Act that meets 
the requirements of the War Powers Resolu-
tion (50 U.S.C. 1541 et seq.). 
(2) 
EXCEPTION.—The 
prohibition 
under 
paragraph (1) shall not apply to a use of mili-
tary force that is consistent with section 
(2)(c) of the War Powers Resolution. 
(d) RULES
OF CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this title may be construed— 
(1) to prevent the President from using 
necessary and appropriate force to defend 
United States allies and partners if Congress 
enacts specific statutory authorization for 
such use of force consistent with the require-
ments of the War Powers Resolution (50 
U.S.C. 1541 et seq.); 
(2) to relieve the executive branch of re-
strictions on the use of force, reporting, or 
consultation requirements set forth in the 
War Powers Resolution (50 U.S.C. 1541 et 
seq.); or 
(3) to authorize the use of military force. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. This 
portion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the

utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman

GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I ask unan-
imous consent that all Members have 5 
legislative days in which to revise and 
extend their remarks and include ex-
traneous material on the motion to

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me start by thank-
ing Mr. KHANNA for his hard work on 
this measure. No one has worked hard-
er to reassert Congress’ constitutional 
authority over war powers, and I have 
been glad to partner with him and co-
sponsor this bill. 
Mr. Speaker, this measure passed the 
House with bipartisan support last 
year as part of the National Defense 
Authorization Act, but the Senate 
stripped it out before that legislation 
made it across the finish line. 
For all my colleagues who supported 
that amendment, the events of the past 
few weeks only underscore the impor-
tance of your vote. For anyone who 
was not convinced this measure was 
needed last summer, the present crisis 
shows exactly why we must adopt it 
today. 
Now, there is no question that Iran is 
dangerous. There is no question that 
Qasem Soleimani was a hardened ter-
rorist with American blood on his 
hands; the world is better off without 
him. 
I am the first to speak out about the 
grave threats the Iranian regime poses 
to our allies and our interests and our 
way of life, but we need to address 
these threats in a way that protects 
Americans, not exacerbate the threat. 
No one expects Iran to behave re-
sponsibly. American leadership means 
that we need to keep pressure on Iran 
while working to avoid an unnecessary 
conflict. Instead, the administration 
seems to be holding a match to kin-
dling. 
Let’s be clear: The American people 
don’t want war with Iran, and Congress 
has not authorized war with Iran. So 
the question is whether escalating ten-
sions with Iran by killing Qasem 
Soleimani and, according to media re-
ports, undertaking a strike against an-
other Iranian official in Yemen were in 
America’s interests and were con-
sistent with the law. 
The past few weeks have shown pret-
ty clearly that this action did not ad-
vance America’s interests. American 
citizens want to drop everything and 
leave Iraq; thousands more troops are 
headed to the Middle East, alienating 
the Iraqi Government, a valued partner 
in the fight against ISIS; Iranian mis-
siles injuring American personnel, even 
though at first the administration said 
there were no injuries, none of this is 
in America’s interests. 
The administration claimed that the 
goal of the strike against Soleimani, 
that the goal of their whole Iran plan, 
is to restore deterrence. I see exactly 
the opposite. I see an emboldened Iran 
seeking to kick America out of the re-
gion, getting exactly what they want. 
And as we have learned more, it does 
not appear that the President followed 
the law here. The President ignored the 
requirements of the War Powers Reso-
lution. He chose not to consult with 
Congress, as required by the law. He 
acted without authorization from Con-
gress. And I have seen no evidence that 
there was any imminent threat against 
Americans or our Embassies, as the ad-
ministration has claimed. 
The Constitution gives Congress, not 
the President, the power to declare 
war. I feel very strongly about that. We 
have all marched down the primrose 
path for the last two decades, with 
Congress sitting there. There has been 
no declaration of war since World War 
II, December 7, 1941, and so it means 
that we have let the executive of both 
parties really run roughshod and do 
whatever the President wanted. Con-
gress just sat there and did not reassert 
its constitutional role. Well, we are re-
asserting that role now. 
Again, the Constitution gives Con-
gress, not the President, the power to 
declare war. With President Trump 
taking steps toward conflict with Iran 
without any consultation with Con-
gress, we need to reassert the responsi-
bility given to us in Article I, Section 
8. 
It is simple. If the President wants to 
go to war, he needs to come to Con-
gress first. This measure simply en-
forces the text of current law as writ-
ten in the War Powers Resolution. It 
preserves 
the 
President’s 
constitu-
tional right to act in self-defense, ex-
plicitly exempting defensive action al-
lowed under the War Powers Resolu-
tion. But it makes clear that the Presi-
dent cannot just skip the critical step 
of coming to Congress. 
I hope my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle can agree on this matter, as 
we did last year. Again, this has been 
done by both Republican and Demo-
cratic Presidents. We should all be 
united here. 
This is about upholding the Constitu-
tion. This is about checks and bal-
ances. This is about all the things we 
learned about the genius of our Con-
stitution with checks and balances. We 
have really abrogated our responsi-
bility, and the time to stop that is 
now. Now is the time for Congress to 
step up and assert our constitutional 
authority. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my col-
leagues to support this amendment. I 
thank Mr. KHANNA for raising this, and 
I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposi-
tion to this dangerous amendment. I 
would like to refresh the memory of 
my colleagues on the other side of the 
aisle. 
The Iranian regime orchestrated over 
a dozen attacks against Americans in 
Iraq over the last 3 months, killing a 
U.S. citizen and wounding four U.S. 
servicemembers. They also hit the Em-
bassy of the United States, ordering a

fiery attack on the U.S. Embassy and 
launched a ballistic missile attack on 
the United States Forces. 
Honestly, Mr. Speaker, I don’t know 
what more the President needs in 
terms of authorization to respond in 
self-defense given these events. The 
President has made it abundantly clear 
that he is not starting a war with Iran. 
He has repeatedly shown restraint 
after Iran’s provocations and deesca-
lated when others would not. 
When forced by Iran’s dangerous es-
calations, the President has targeted 
limited 
military 
action 
to 
defend 
Americans overseas, using his Article 
II constitutional authority. This in-
cluded the strike in Baghdad against 
Soleimani, Iran’s mastermind of terror, 
who was responsible for killing more 
than 600 Americans and wounding 
thousands more. He has blood on his 
hands. 
But my colleagues cannot accept the 
fact that the President acted time and 
again with restraint in these matters. 
They are so blinded by their contempt 
for this President that they are seek-
ing to tie his hands. They would rather 
risk putting Americans in the Middle 
East in harm’s way by an Iranian re-
gime with a 40-year history of deadly 
aggression against us. 
This amendment takes legitimate op-
tions off the table for the executive 
branch. In doing so, it shows America 
divided in the face of mounting Iranian 
threats, making our Nation less safe. 
Make no mistake, Iran and others are 
watching as the Democrats needlessly 
divide us. 
We all agree that, under Article I of 
the Constitution, only Congress pos-
sesses the authority to declare war, but 
this amendment goes much further 
than prohibiting an unauthorized war. 
This amendment uses Congress’ power 
of the purse to preclude any use of 
force whatsoever against Iran unless it 
is previously authorized by Congress or 
provoked by an attack on the territory 
or the Armed Forces of the United 
States. 
Think about what that means. What 
can our military do if Iran attacks 
American civilians or diplomats or 
commercial shipping overseas? Under 
this reckless amendment, the answer is 
absolutely nothing. The United States 
military cannot fire a single shot until 
after the successful completion of a bi-
cameral legislative process that enacts 
law authorizing the use of force. How 
many Americans would be dead by 
then? 
We need Iran and its terrorist proxies 
to think twice about attacking Ameri-
cans, our friends, and our own inter-
ests, not enabling them like this 
amendment does. 
Further, this is an unprecedented at-
tempt to limit the powers claimed by 
every Commander in Chief, both Demo-
crat and Republican, since the War 
Powers Resolution was enacted over 
President Nixon’s veto in 1973. 
This misguided amendment is actu-
ally far more restrictive than the War 
Powers Resolution itself, which recog-
nizes the use of our Armed Forces for 
up to 60 days without legislative au-
thorization in situations of war. 
This is absolutely not the time to 
play politics with our national secu-
rity. Iran’s aggression is not going to 
go away anytime soon. 
I would like to quote from a July 8 
letter from the Department of Defense 
when this same proposal was consid-
ered as an amendment to the Defense 
Authorization bill. ‘‘The Department 
strongly opposes this amendment. . . . 
If U.S. citizens, diplomatic facilities in 
the region, or other important national 
interests are threatened or attacked, 
we must be able to respond promptly 
and in an appropriate fashion.’’ 
That letter was sent 5 months before 
the attack on the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad. The concerns expressed in the 
letter are even more urgent today, 
given the many attacks on Americans 
in Iraq in recent days. 
Bottom line, this measure emboldens 
our adversary by tying the President’s 
hands on Iran. 
Mr. Speaker, therefore, I oppose this 
legislation, which I believe is politics 
at its worst. It is dangerous. It ties our 
Commander 
in 
Chief’s 
hands. 
It 
emboldens our enemy, the largest state 
sponsor of terror, the Islamic Republic 
of Iran. And I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. KHANNA), the author of this 
important amendment who has worked 
very hard on these issues for many 
years. 
Mr. KHANNA. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairman ENGEL for his moral leader-
ship in preventing a war in Iran and his 
moral leadership in stopping the war in 
Yemen. 
This amendment is very simple. It 
would stop another regime change war 
in the Middle East. 
The gentleman from Texas says that 
it is dangerous, that it is reckless, that 
it emboldens our enemies. Does he real-
ly believe that 27 Republicans, includ-
ing Representative GAETZ, Representa-
tive MEADOWS, and Representative JOR-
DAN are emboldening our enemies? 
b 0930 
Does he really believe that they are 
divisive against the President? I mean, 
they are some of the President’s 
staunchest supporters. 
It is time, in this body, that we get 
past 
the 
rhetoric, 
past 
the 
sloganeering, and consider why 27 Re-
publicans actually voted for this. Per-
haps it has to do with our national se-
curity. Perhaps it has to do with re-
versing blunder after blunder that has 
cost this country trillions of dollars 
and lives. 
Let’s consider the facts. The Presi-
dent says we want to have a pivot to 
Asia because China is our leading com-
petitor in the 21st century. I agree. 
China’s GDP, 15 percent of global GDP; 
the United States, at 21 percent. They 
are putting their money into building 
rail, building universities. 
You know how much Iran’s GDP is of 
global GDP? .44 percent. Future histo-
rians will wonder what were we think-
ing? What were we thinking? 
They say, well, we have got to keep 
the Strait of Hormuz open. Well, the 
Strait of Hormuz has been open since 
1981. And by the way, China, Japan, 
South Korea, they need 65 percent of 
that oil. You think they would allow 
the Strait of Hormuz to close? 
Why is America bearing the cost for 
these wars when China hasn’t been in a 
war since 1979? 
This amendment does nothing, noth-
ing, to restrict the Commander in Chief 
to protect American interests or pro-
tect American allies. It gives him all of 
the powers of the War Powers Resolu-
tion. If we are hit, he has every author-
ity to act and not come to Congress for 
authorization. 
All the amendment says is, before we 
get into another Middle East war, be-
fore we waste trillions of dollars again, 
that we need to come to Congress to 
authorize that. I hope that this body 
will vote for this in a bipartisan way. I 
hope this time even more than 27 Re-
publicans will join. 
And I believe actually voting for this 
amendment is vindicating what Presi-
dent Trump ran on in 2016, which was a 
promise to the American people to get 
out of these endless wars in the Middle 
East. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. THORNBERRY), the lead Republican 
on the House Armed Services Com-
mittee. 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, 
here is a summary of the situation. On 
an issue of serious interest and concern 
to Members on both sides of the aisle, 
the 
current 
House 
leadership 
has 
brought to the floor the most extreme 
proposals, with limited debate, and ab-
solutely no opportunity for any other 
idea to be considered. 
They are so afraid of losing a motion 
to recommit that they have overturned 
100 years of precedent and practice in 
this House by even denying a motion to 
recommit. And thus, they have taken a 
serious, complex subject and turned it 
into a messaging bill that will do noth-
ing except encourage our adversaries. I 
would suggest it is a sad day for the 
House and for the country. 
Now, specifically on this amendment, 
if this amendment were seriously im-
plemented—and by the way, I think no 
administration of either party would 
seriously implement this language— 
but if it were, it is far more restrictive 
than the War Powers Act. It says Con-
gress has to approve anything ahead of 
time, or we have to already wait for 
the attack to have occurred, and then 
the President to designate a national 
emergency. No other time could a 
President use force against Iran. 
So, for example, we could not have 
carried 
out 
the 
attack 
against

Soleimani. Even if we had perfect in-
telligence that he was about to kill 
large numbers of Americans, we would 
have to wait until they died first. 
Anyone who says, oh, this doesn’t re-
strict his ability; we can always defend 
ourselves, either you haven’t read the 
language, or you really are trying not 
to understand the effect that the lit-
eral interpretation of this language 
would mean. 
We could not, under this language, 
enforce sanctions against Iran to try to 
keep them from getting a nuclear 
weapon. We could not work with our 
allies to try to keep international ship-
ping open in the Persian Gulf. We could 
not engage in cyber operations, even to 
protect ourselves, until after the at-
tack had already occurred. 
Attorneys at DOD believe that at 
least it would call into serious question 
our ability to defend Israel if it were 
attacked by Iran or its proxies. 
This language is extreme. It is irre-
sponsible on subject, on substance, 
tying the President’s hands from de-
fending the country. 
Now, as I said, there are lots of peo-
ple who are concerned about this issue, 
but I do not believe that they have un-
derstood or thought through the effects 
of this language. 
One other point. You cannot ignore 
what is happening in the world. Things 
are still a little tense between us and 
Iran, so why bring it up this week, with 
those 
tensions 
still 
fresh 
on 
everybody’s mind? I believe the only 
effect will be to encourage Iran. 
So bringing this measure to the floor, 
in this way, at this time, is irrespon-
sible for our Nation’s security and for 
the integrity of the House. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Let me say, with respect to the gen-
tleman’s 
statement 
about 
process, 
when our colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle were in charge, they struck 
and replaced language in a Senate- 
passed bill 15 times in the last two Con-
gresses, and this is doing the same 
thing, which is exactly what they did. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
GARAMENDI). 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I 
have enormous respect for my col-
leagues on the Armed Services Com-
mittee. This particular piece of legisla-
tion that was brought, it was amended 
into my bill, H.R. 550, and was debated 
for more than an hour and a half in the 
Armed Services Committee and on the 
floor when the National Defense Au-
thorization Act was enacted. It has 
been thoroughly reviewed. 
And, with all due respect, it is not 
the end of the world. But it is the reas-
sertion of Congress for our constitu-
tional responsibilities. 
Since I first came to Congress in 2009, 
I have authored legislation and voted 
consistently to repeal the 2002 AUMF, 
which is really a very open-ended au-
thorization for the President to do vir-
tually anything he wants. 
Yesterday, in a hearing we heard, in 
an unclassified portion of that hearing, 
from the Pentagon’s lawyers that es-
sentially said the 2002 AUMF allows 
the President to do anything with any 
threat that emanates from Iraq. We 
should consider that seriously; that if, 
in fact, that is their justification and, 
in fact, that is also written into the 
President’s, or the White House’s view 
of this legislation; any threat ema-
nating from Iraq, at any time, into the 
future. Consider that. 
There could be no more powerful rea-
son for us than to terminate the 2002 
AUMF with regard to Iraq and come to 
our senses. When there is an issue, 
bring it to the floor, and allow us to de-
bate how we should deal with Iraq or 
Iran or any other threat in that area. 
Just going into some detail here. The 
War Powers Act is not eliminated by 
any of this legislation. It remains in ef-
fect. And the President has the author-
ity under the War Powers Act and 
under Article II of the Constitution to 
protect America from imminent at-
tack. That doesn’t change. None of 
that changes. 
But what does change is that we are 
bringing back unto ourselves the power 
that the Constitution gives to us for 
very good reason; that is, war is a seri-
ous business; between Iraq and Afghan-
istan, probably several trillion dollars, 
depending upon the estimate and the 
cost of maintaining our veterans into 
the future; $2 trillion, maybe more. 
Lives lost on every side of the war. And 
it goes on and on and on. 
Indeed, Trump came to office saying 
he is going to end endless wars. This is 
our opportunity to reassert our con-
stitutional authority and, most impor-
tantly, our responsibility. We should 
do that. 
We can talk process forever, and we 
seem to want to talk process more 
than the reality. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the 
gentleman from California an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, bot-
tom line, for too long we have failed 
our responsibility. We really must act 
to repeal the 2002 Authorization for the 
Use of Military Force in Iraq, and to 
set clear parameters about further ac-
tion against Iran. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK). 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, this 
amendment forbids the President from 
taking action that he can’t take any-
way. With or without this amendment, 
the President cannot attack Iran, or 
any country, without Congressional 
authorization unless it attacks us. And 
even then, his powers are limited to or-
dering defensive actions unless Con-
gress acts. 
The attack on Soleimani in Iraq was 
against an enemy combatant in a war 
zone that was authorized by Congress. 
It was not an attack on Iran. 
The only practical effect of this 
amendment is to send a message of ir-
resolution to our enemies, and to take 
a cheap shot at the President by imply-
ing he would do something he cannot 
do. 
Now, the Lee amendment, coming 
next, repeals the AUMF that Congress 
adopted when it foolishly authorized 
the Iraq war in 2002. 
Under our Constitution, only Con-
gress can start a war. But after that, 
only the President can wage it or con-
duct the negotiations to end it. You 
cannot unring a bell, and you cannot 
unstart a war. Once unleashed, the 
war-making authority continues until 
it is terminated by treaty or agree-
ment. 
So here are the lessons of this whole 
sorry saga in Iraq. Congress should de-
clare war only when our country is at-
tacked. When we declare war, we must 
put the full resources, resolve, atten-
tion, fury, and might of this Nation be-
hind it, and see it through as quickly 
and decisively as possible. 
And most of all, having handed the 
President that power, and having sent 
our troops into battle, Congress must 
stand behind its decision, no matter 
how long or hard that road may be. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. CASTRO), the vice chair of the For-
eign Affairs Committee, the chair of 
the Subcommittee on Oversight and In-
vestigation. 
Mr. 
CASTRO. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
this 
month, the American people were 
unwillingly taken to the brink of war 
at the reckless direction of this admin-
istration. As a coequal branch of gov-
ernment, we must ensure that no 
President can take any military action 
without coming to Congress first. 
Repealing the 2002 AUMF and passing 
the No War Against Iran Act will pre-
vent any future escalation or military 
action without the full consideration 
and consent of this body. At the same 
time, they preserve the military’s abil-
ity to take actions in self-defense to 
protect our forces. 
The American people are tired of un-
necessary wars that leave our country 
less safe. It is our responsibility as 
elected Representatives to prevent our 
Nation from entering an unnecessary 
war with Iran. These measures are crit-
ical in that respect. 
We cannot allow recklessness to lead 
us into a protracted conflict that is not 
in our interests and will lead to suf-
fering. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. LAMBORN). 
Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
You know, I have seen thousands of 
amendments during my time here in 
Congress, but this is the most dan-
gerous I have ever seen. It is far more 
restrictive than the War Powers Reso-
lution, and it is historic in that it 
handcuffs the President in advance by

undermining his ability to protect 
American citizens whom Iran con-
tinues to try to harm. 
No Member of Congress wants to be 
at war with Iran, if given the chance, 
but deterrence is achieved through 
credible strength, not by publicly tying 
the hands of the Commander in Chief 
in advance. 
While no American wants to be at 
war with Iran, Iran believes it is cer-
tainly at war with America. 
b 0945 
Now this amendment gives Iran’s ter-
rorist forces freedom of movement 
throughout the region, allowing them 
to plan and prepare attacks on the U.S. 
Forces with impunity. 
The rulers of Iran are an evil regime 
and have been for a long time. They 
were designated a state sponsor of ter-
rorism since 1984, after killing 241 ma-
rines in Beirut. Today, it is the source 
of chaos in the Middle East, fostering 
conflict throughout the region and 
fueling wars in Yemen and Syria which 
have caused death and suffering on an 
apocalyptic scale, and yet this amend-
ment would require the President to 
wait until after our troops have been 
attacked to use force against the ter-
rorist forces of Iran. 
And that is not all. Then he has to 
wait until Congress gets its act to-
gether to authorize a response. He 
could only use force to defend our 
troops, under the language of this 
amendment, ‘‘if Congress enacts spe-
cific statutory authorization for such 
use of force.’’ 
Our troops conducting counter-ISIS 
missions in Iraq and Syria will be 
proactively prevented from taking ac-
tion against Iranian forces or proxy 
forces to stop an imminent attack. 
So passage of this amendment re-
wards the Iranian regime’s growing ag-
gression and it emboldens the IRGC, a 
designated terrorist organization, and 
their proxy forces in Iraq and Syria, 
granting legitimacy and freedom of 
movement to the world’s number one 
state sponsor of terrorism. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘no’’ on 
this historically ill-advised and dan-
gerous amendment. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Mr. Chair-
man, I want to thank Congressman 
KHANNA
for his hard work on this 
amendment. 
All we have heard from our friends 
across the aisle this morning is a pa-
rade of horribles unsubstantiated in 
fact or law. In fact, we brought to-
gether a bipartisan coalition to re-
assert in this body our constitutional 
duty in matters of war and peace. 
After nearly two decades in the Mid-
dle East, Americans have tired of end-
less wars. We have lost far too many 
lives and spent far too much money 
with little progress. 
President 
Trump’s 
reckless 
esca-
lations with Iran and his abandonment 
of our allies have made America and 
the world less safe. He has no strategy 
to counter Iran’s nuclear ambitions or 
deter Iranian aggression and malign in-
fluence. His rhetoric has put our troops 
in harm’s way and isolated the United 
States on the world stage. 
With this amendment, we assert on 
behalf of the American people that war 
with Iran is not in the best interests of 
our country; we assert that the Presi-
dent does not have a blank check to 
commit more American lives to yet an-
other war in the Middle East; and we 
recommit ourselves to robust diplo-
macy and the need for an open dialogue 
with even our fiercest adversaries. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. RIGGLEMAN), a veteran of the 
United States Air Force, who served in 
Operation Allied Force, Operation En-
during Freedom, and multiple counter-
terrorism activities over the past two 
decades. 
We thank him for his service. 
Mr. RIGGLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I stand in strong opposition to this 
amendment. 
Since I mission-planned the first 
bombing runs in Afghanistan in early 
2001, warfare has evolved. It is fas-
cinating to think that my military ca-
reer started with dropping bombs. 
One of my jobs was to flush out, 
bury, or kill insurgents who used caves 
as places for cover. Technology was 
certainly in use when utilizing GPS- 
guided weapons, electro-optical and 
laser-guided missiles. We mensurated 
coordinates by using systems like rain-
drop and tracked our aircrews with 
systems like combat track. 
For us older warfighters and folks 
here, it was incredible then, but today 
it would be like playing tank war on an 
original Atari. 
Terrorists still use caves, but those 
caves could be in cyberspace. By 2018, I 
was 
working 
on 
tracking 
targets 
through a myriad of activities, finding 
gaps in vertically integrated network 
infrastructures, linking proxy groups 
to IED resupply, perfecting telephony 
analysis, computer network attack and 
identifying 
network 
critical 
touchpoints in command and control 
architectures. I wasn’t just dropping 
bombs anymore. 
Instead of executing war, our group 
worked to determine as many asym-
metric terrorist attack modalities as 
we could and then used research and 
development to advance new concepts, 
such as algorithmic warfare or instan-
taneous information sharing. 
My job, in two decades, took me from 
bombs to algorithms. 
This amendment is ill-timed and ir-
responsible and seems do coincide with 
impeachment. This act is political, 
without any forethought to what a pos-
sible AUMF would look like in this new 
era of asymmetric warfare. 
We have Iran on the ropes, have 
killed their number one terrorist and 
struck their command and control hi-
erarchy in a devastating way. 
This amendment, at the bottom of 
page 2, states: 
No Federal funds may be obligated or ex-
pended for any use of military force in or 
against Iran, unless Congress has declared 
war, enacted specific statutory authorization 
for such use of military force after the date 
of the enactment of this act that meets the 
requirement of the War Powers Resolution. 
Let’s ensure we enact specific statu-
tory authorization or reason way be-
fore we remove statutory authority al-
ready in place. 
Does this amendment restrict use of 
resources already in place if Iran em-
ploys cyberattack, critical infrastruc-
ture attack, electronic warfare, chem-
ical attack, biological attack, or any 
other attack modalities that terrorists 
like to employ? 
And what if terrorist-specific modali-
ties can be used where Iran supports 
terror operations in places such as 
Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Algeria, 
Yemen, Bahrain; is the United States 
then limited to new resource allocation 
to defend forces? 
The speed of warfare is intense. And 
let’s make no mistake: Congress can-
not always move at the speed of war-
fare in a time of asymmetric kinetic— 
think airplanes—or nonkinetic—think 
electric power infrastructure and mili-
tary communications network—attack. 
That is why we have a Commander in 
Chief. That is why we have Article II of 
the Constitution. That is why our 
Founders made it this way. Sometimes 
military force is not war. 
Of course we must preserve Article I 
powers. Let’s approach this fix in a 
way that preserves our Constitution 
and considers the nongeographic threat 
posture we live in today. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, let me just 
say that the President always has a 
legal right to defend America, U.S. 
forces and embassies, and this resolu-
tion explicitly exempts the defensive 
actions described in the War Powers 
Resolution. 
The War Powers Resolution has been 
around since 1973, and it has never pre-
vented the President from defending 
America. 
Again, this amendment just enforces 
the text of the War Powers Resolution. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Massachusetts (Mr. MOULTON), 
not only a Member of this body, but a 
combat veteran. 
I thank him for his service. 
Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
When I led marines in Iraq, they 
asked me a lot of questions. Some were 
simple, like: How do I send a letter 
home to my parents? Some were more 
difficult, like: What kind of rocket do I 
need to use against this building? 
But the single hardest question I got 
was: Sir, why are we here? It came 
from marines of all backgrounds, all 
political stripes. And it was rooted in 
the fact that we got to Iraq care of a 
President who used false intelligence 
and a Congress that failed to do its job. 
Too many Americans died in Iraq be-
cause we did not fulfill our constitu-
tional responsibility.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H722 
January 30, 2020 
Now, nothing in this amendment 
takes away the Commander in Chief’s 
ability to defend ourselves; in fact, it 
cites the War Powers Resolution. But 
it does make it very clear that Con-
gress has not authorized the President 
to go to war with Iran. That is a mes-
sage that we need to send today. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from New 
Mexico (Ms. HAALAND). 
Ms. HAALAND. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
The President’s reckless behavior un-
necessarily escalated an already sim-
mering conflict with Iran. The assas-
sination of General Qasem Soleimani, 
without consulting Congress, led us to 
the brink of war. 
While we have taken a step back 
from the ledge, the President’s actions 
had severe and fatal consequences. 
Fifty of our brave servicemembers suf-
fered traumatic brain injuries, and 176 
innocent civilians on a commercial air-
line were tragically killed by retalia-
tory missile strikes. 
Now is the time to reduce tensions 
and engage in good faith diplomacy. 
The American people have made it 
clear that we do not want a war with 
Iran. 
It is long past time for Congress to 
reclaim its constitutional authority 
over the power to wage war. I urge my 
colleagues to do this by passing the No 
War Against Iran Act. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Wy-
oming (Ms. CHENEY), the distinguished 
chair of the Republican Conference. 
Ms. CHENEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. MCCAUL for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the measures that we 
are voting on and debating today are 
unconstitutional, they are partisan, 
and they are dangerous for America’s 
national security. 
The House already debated and voted 
on both of these bills during the NDAA 
process last year. Both were rejected, 
rightly, and stripped from the final 
NDAA for a reason. 
Now Speaker PELOSI is choosing to 
put this legislation on the floor once 
again in order to weaken the President 
just as the Democrats did with their 
unconstitutional War Powers Resolu-
tion earlier this month. 
Speaker PELOSI and the House Demo-
crats are so unsure of their own sub-
stantive case that they are hiding be-
hind House rules to make sure that Re-
publicans can’t even bring any amend-
ment to this legislation. 
I wish this were a surprise, but it is, 
unfortunately, more of the same abuse 
of power we have become accustomed 
to under the Democratic majority in 
this House. Speaker PELOSI and the 
Democrats continue to demonstrate 
they hate the President so much that 
they will not even stand with him 
when he kills the world’s deadliest ter-
rorist. Representative KHANNA’s meas-
ure today would tie the President’s 
hands at a time when he needs flexi-
bility most. 
Earlier this month, Mr. Speaker, the 
President took action to protect Amer-
ican troops, to defend our national se-
curity, when he killed the terrorist 
Qasem Soleimani. His decisive strike 
against Soleimani made the world a 
safer place. 
In carrying out this action, President 
Trump relied on several authorities, in-
cluding his Article II powers and the 
2002 AUMF, the measure my colleagues 
on the other side of the aisle are at-
tempting to repeal today. 
The bills before us will undermine 
the deterrence established by President 
Trump. They will embolden Iran. They 
will make conflict more, not less, like-
ly. 
Weakness, Mr. Speaker, is provoca-
tive, and both of these measures con-
vey weakness. 
Representative KHANNA’s bill is a se-
rious constitutional transgression: 
It would call into question whether 
the President could defend our closest 
ally in the Middle East, Israel, without 
first getting approval from 535 Mem-
bers of the House and the Senate; 
It would call into question whether 
he could protect our diplomats in Iraq, 
who have just, in recent months, faced 
attacks from Iranian-backed militias; 
It would call into question whether 
he could uphold the basic principle of 
freedom 
of 
navigation 
and 
defend 
against Iran’s attacks on international 
shipping. 
Our troops are fighting today, Mr. 
Speaker, to protect the freedom of 
every person in this Chamber and every 
person 
across 
this 
country. 
They 
should never have to question whether 
they can defend themselves against 
America’s enemies, but Representative 
KHANNA’s measure would sow exactly 
this kind of doubt. 
This bill ignores a key historical re-
ality: Iran has been at war with the 
United States for four decades. The re-
gime has been designated the world’s 
leading state sponsor of terrorism for 
years on end. Hundreds of troops have 
died at the hands of Iranian-backed mi-
litias. 
As the U.S. faces these adversaries, it 
is absolutely critical that the Presi-
dent retain the flexibility to act swift-
ly and decisively when our interests or 
forces are threatened. 
It is time for my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to stop playing 
politics with the security of our Na-
tion. I urge my colleagues to vote 
against these measures today. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, let me say 
that America’s Constitution laws don’t 
really 
convey 
weakness. 
Enforcing 
those laws is what keeps America 
strong. And when any President does 
not follow the law, this Congress must 
act, and that is what we are trying to 
do now. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO). 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Well, 
hating 
all 
things 
Obama, 
Trump impulsively tore up the nuclear 
deal with Iran, even though all of his 
intelligence agencies, all of the other 
signatories, the inspectors, agreed they 
were in compliance. 
b 1000 
He said he would get a better deal as 
a master negotiator, through a unilat-
eral campaign of maximum pressure, 
and bring stability to the region. 
Instead, he has triggered steadily es-
calating tensions, culminating in the 
January 3 assassination of Soleimani, 
bringing the U.S. to the brink of war 
with Iran. 
The Bush invasion of Iraq under 
phony intelligence provided by Vice 
President Cheney was the worst foreign 
policy mistake in the history of the 
United States of America, and we are 
still seeing the repercussions, but a 
war with Iran would be worse. 
Trump says he doesn’t need to con-
sult with Congress for a war in Iran. 
We hear from the other side that Con-
gress asserting its constitutional au-
thority regarding declaration of war is 
dangerous. 
I tell you what is dangerous: an im-
pulsive Commander in Chief embroiling 
the United States in yet another end-
less war in the Middle East. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Trump 
has no plan, no strategy in the Middle 
East, but this self-described ‘‘stable ge-
nius,’’ who tells us he is smarter than 
our generals, smarter than our mili-
tary and intelligence leaders, he wants 
sole control over whether our Nation is 
plunged into a war with Iran. 
Today, we say: No, Mr. President. 
You are not yet the tyrant that you 
wish to become. You defied military 
judgment by rejecting the Iran nuclear 
agreement. You abruptly abandoned 
our Kurdish allies, so vital to the fight 
against ISIS and terrorism, and you 
have taken us to the brink of war with 
an assassination of a foreign leader 
without any imminent threat dem-
onstrated, only double-talk to explain 
that assassination. 
It is time to put the brakes on his 
dangerous pursuits. 
We reject this reckless and impulsive 
escalation, the endless bloodshed, and 
the lack of vision beyond promoting 
his own selfish interests. 
It is Congress that our Constitution 
vests with responsibility to declare 
war. 
If 1776 stood for anything, it was that 
America would not be ruled by a king 
or one who today aspires to be an au-
thoritarian. 
This legislation will cut off funds for 
future war with Iran unless Congress 
authorizes war, has a specific author-
ization, or we face a true, genuine im-
minent threat. 
Before young Americans are again 
placed in harm’s way, let’s be sure it is 
the only choice to ensure our security 
and have a strategy for victory.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H723 
January 30, 2020 
Today, let’s set the groundwork for 
peace, not more architecture for end-
less war. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Members are further reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair and 
not to a perceived viewing audience. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Kansas 
(Mr. WATKINS), a veteran of the United 
States Army with 8 years of combat 
service in the Middle East. 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the 
gentleman 
from 
Texas 
(Mr. 
MCCAUL) for yielding. 
With respect to my friend from Mas-
sachusetts, Representative MOULTON, I 
was asked tough questions in the Mid-
dle East as well by my soldiers. I was 
asked: ‘‘How do we kill our enemy?’’ 
And I was asked, perhaps more jarring: 
‘‘How do we live and go home?’’ 
We need two things on the front 
lines. We need speed, and we need 
lethality. This body has proven itself 
incapable of empowering our troops to 
act with speed and lethality. 
Operations are dangerous. When I 
went out doing combat and rebuilding 
operations on the front lines in two 
conflict environments, I was very no-
ticeable, Mr. Speaker. I am a White 
guy. I am pretty upfront about that. 
But you better believe that they know 
I was a soft target. It is important for 
my own survivability that, should any-
thing happen to me, they know that a 
Reaper drone is going to rain a Hellfire 
missile down on them. 
That is deterrence. That works far 
better than appeasement. 
I would also like to add that we 
talked a lot about the process. Sup-
posedly, we are attacking the process 
and not reality. Well, the reality is 
that I have had friends of mine tor-
tured to death, friends of mine I knew 
very well in conflict environments. 
It is in their spirit that I say this. 
This is awful, what we are doing. We 
need to empower our Commander in 
Chief. Despite your hatred of his pol-
icy, we need to empower him to act 
with decisiveness. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-
fornia (Ms. JUDY CHU). 
Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of Congress Member KHANNA’s resolu-
tion to prevent any funds from being 
used for an unauthorized war with Iran. 
Just a few weeks ago, America and 
Iran were on the brink of a terrible and 
destructive conflict. Fortunately, both 
sides stepped back, but the tensions 
and volatility remain. 
Make no mistake, Iran continues to 
be a challenge and continues to threat-
en U.S. interests in the region. How-
ever, as the Iran nuclear deal dem-
onstrated, conflict is not inevitable. 
But with a President committed to a 
campaign of maximum pressure, we 
cannot simply wait for the next crisis 
and hope for the best. That is why we 
must reclaim Congress’ constitutional 
authority to declare war and prevent 
the President from leading us into a 
war of choice. 
Already, the House passed a bipar-
tisan War Powers Resolution to force 
the President to seek congressional au-
thorization for any war with Iran. To-
day’s resolution would help enforce 
that by prohibiting the use of funds for 
an unauthorized war. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentlewoman from Flor-
ida (Ms. FRANKEL). 
Ms. FRANKEL. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. ENGEL for yielding. 
We can agree Iran is the world’s lead-
ing state sponsor of terrorism and 
must not be allowed to obtain a nu-
clear weapon, but let’s also agree that 
diplomacy 
is 
preferred, 
instead 
of 
armed conflict. 
But the question today is not wheth-
er to go to war but who has the power 
to make that decision. 
Mr. Speaker, our family was blessed 
when my son, a United States marine 
war veteran, came home safely from 
tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, but too 
many loved ones were not that lucky. 
So when I came to Congress, I made a 
promise never to send someone else’s 
child to a war that could be avoided. 
The constitutional law gives Con-
gress, not the President, the sole power 
to declare and authorize war, and it is 
time that Congress owns up to that 
grave responsibility. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
have the courage to repeal the war au-
thorization against Iraq and tell the 
President no war against Iran without 
our consent. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Florida 
(Mr. WALTZ), a U.S. Army veteran and 
decorated Special Forces officer with 
23 years of service, including combat 
tours in Afghanistan and the Middle 
East. 
Mr. WALTZ. Mr. Speaker, today, and 
as the underlying premise for this leg-
islation, we are hearing a lot of things. 
Number one, we are hearing that the 
President recklessly escalated our rela-
tionship with Iran. Wrong. The Presi-
dent responded to a series of esca-
lations from Iran, and he responded re-
sponsibly. 
Our issues with Iran, this relation-
ship, didn’t start just in the last few 
months. It started in 1979. It started 
with Iranians taking our diplomats 
hostage. It continued with them spon-
soring the suicide attack on our Em-
bassy in Beirut, with killing hundreds 
of marines in Beirut, with bombing the 
Khobar Towers, with killing hundreds 
of Americans in Iraq at the hands of its 
militias, and on and on. 
Most recently, after the Iranians at-
tacked 
international 
shipping, 
at-
tacked global oil supplies in Saudi Ara-
bia, stormed our Embassy and killed 
yet another American, finally, the 
President responded by taking down 
the mastermind of many of these at-
tacks over the years in a way that was 
limited, that was precise, and that had 
zero collateral damage. 
The other thing you are going to 
hear is that this attack on Soleimani, 
the killing of Soleimani, the head of 
the Quds Force, was disproportional. I 
have to tell you, the families of the 
tens of thousands of people across the 
Middle East that Soleimani and his mi-
litias have killed, they didn’t think it 
was proportional. They thought it was 
long overdue. The Gold Star families, 
the American Gold Star families who 
no longer have their loved ones with 
them holiday after holiday, they didn’t 
think it was disproportional. They too 
thought it was long overdue. 
Soleimani should have been killed 
years ago. I am grateful the President 
finally took action. 
Mr. Speaker, I would ask my col-
leagues how many more Americans, 
how many more families, should go 
without their loved ones at the hands 
of this serial human rights abuser be-
fore the President should take action? 
In fact, I, as a Member of Congress, 
would have been pounding the table 
had he not taken action, given action-
able intelligence and the opportunity 
to do so. 
You are hearing that the President 
assassinated a foreign leader. Also 
wrong. A terrorist is a terrorist, and 
this individual was designated a ter-
rorist by the Obama administration. 
The Quds Force is a terrorist organiza-
tion, as decided by the Obama adminis-
tration. 
Whether it is al-Qaida and Osama bin 
Laden, 
whether 
it 
is 
ISIS 
and 
Baghdadi, or whether it is the Quds 
Force and Soleimani, we have an obli-
gation to strike back at terrorism and 
to stop terrorism in its tracks. The 
President had a duty and a responsi-
bility as Commander in Chief to take 
this action. 
Finally, you are hearing that the ad-
ministration has no strategy. Also 
wrong. The administration withdrew 
from the Iran deal. It was a bad deal, 
narrowly focused on one aspect of its 
program. 
Its maximum pressure campaign is in 
place. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield an 
additional 30 seconds to the gentleman. 
Mr. WALTZ. The Iranian economy is 
tanking. They came to the table in the 
first place in 2012 to enter into negotia-
tions because the sanctions were work-
ing, and they will come to the table 
again. But this time, this administra-
tion will strike a better deal that en-
compasses terrorism, its missile pro-
gram, and the fact that Iran is still 
taking American hostages to this day.

January 30, 2020 
Then, we will get the entirety of its nu-
clear program in a much better deal. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
step away from this partisan bill, to 
vote against these bills coming to the 
table, and to support the administra-
tion in taking on the world’s leading 
sponsor of terrorism. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self as much time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say that if kill-
ing Soleimani was about retaliating for 
past bad acts by Iran, that is exactly 
when the law requires the President to 
work with the Congress for a response, 
not do a response on his own. 
The President didn’t work with us. 
Instead, he told the American people 
there was an imminent threat, with no 
evidence to support that claim. 
Now, I don’t like the Iranian regime. 
There are lots of things I don’t like 
about them. But it doesn’t mean that 
we just give any President a blank 
check to do whatever he wants to start 
a war. 
We have been through that in the 
past decades of endless war, with this 
body, as far as I am concerned, abro-
gating its responsibility and essen-
tially giving the administrations of 
both parties blank checks. 
This is about Congress reasserting 
what it is supposed to do. This is about 
Congress saying only we have the 
power to declare war; the President 
does not have that power to declare 
war. 
b 1015 
Now, the Khanna measure is about 
enforcing current law as it is written 
in the War Powers Resolution. We 
should not create special loopholes in 
current law for any one country, no 
matter how close our alliance or part-
nership is. This is not a question of 
whether we will defend our allies and 
partners. It is a question of which 
branch of government is responsible for 
making that decision. 
The War Powers Resolution could not 
be more clear. It is Congress who is re-
sponsible for authorizing the use of 
military force. We went through the 
entire Cold War without ever creating 
an exception to the War Powers Reso-
lution or the Constitution when it 
comes to Article 5 of the NATO treaty. 
We do not need to create a loophole 
now. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, let me say something 
that I have been saying a lot recently. 
Nobody denies the fact that Iran is a 
bad actor. No one denies the fact that 
Iran is the leading state sponsor of ter-
rorism in the world. No one is saying 
that the Iranian regime is a good re-
gime or a regime that doesn’t threaten 
our interests. They do threaten our in-
terests. 
I am not a naive person. I don’t like 
the regime, and I know what they do. 
But we have a way of responding, and 
it is not to give any President a blank 
check to do whatever he or she may 
want to do. 
Congress declares war according to 
the Constitution; not the President. 
Congress declares war. And today we 
are attempting to take back the au-
thorization that is given to us in the 
United States Constitution and say to 
this President and to every President 
that comes in the future: No blank 
checks for war. 
We gave blank checks for the past 20 
years, and we have been involved in 
one mistake after another. This is sim-
ply saying for Congress to reassert its 
authority. I am not saying that in the 
future there may not be a different de-
cision, but the decision that should al-
ways remain the same is that Congress 
has the power to declare war; not the 
President. Congress. 
I think my friends on the other side 
of the aisle somehow forget that. They 
make some good points. But, again, I 
say, it comes back to this Congress to 
declare a war, and we are today taking 
that responsibility, grabbing the bull 
by the horns and saying: Enough is 
enough, where Congress just sits idly 
by 
and 
has 
no 
say 
except 
to 
rubberstamp whatever administration 
wants to go to war. 
That should stop today, and that is 
why we are moving ahead with this res-
olution. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I con-
tinue to reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of both 
the amendments to H.R. 550 under con-
sideration today. I thank the Speaker 
for her courage in bringing these bills 
to the floor, and I thank the sponsors, 
my friends, BARBARA
LEE
and RO 
KHANNA for their leadership. 
It is long past time for the 2002 
AUMF to be repealed. This vaguely 
worded authorization of force against 
Iraq, which was obtained under false 
pretenses by the George W. Bush ad-
ministration, has long posed a problem 
for 
proper 
congressional 
oversight, 
though at various points in time, both 
parties have shied away from taking 
action to rectify this. 
But now we have no choice but to 
act, as the Trump administration ar-
gues that the 2002 AUMF which justi-
fies war against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq 
apparently applies to members of the 
Iranian Government, even though the 
word ‘‘Iran’’ appears nowhere in the 
text. 
As Congress, we must assert our con-
stitutional oversight authority in mat-
ters of war. Permitting this and future 
administrations to rely on an open- 
ended authorization of force without 
proper oversight, is nothing less than 
an abrogation of our duty. 
I urge each of my colleagues to sup-
port this amendment and final passage 
of the bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON LEE). The time of the gen-
tleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Rhode Island an 
additional 30 seconds. 
Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, if I 
may just respond to some arguments 
that this will undermine our rights to 
self-defense. The President always has 
a legal right to defend America and de-
fend U.S. forces and embassies. This 
resolution explicitly exempts the de-
fensive actions described in the War 
Powers Resolution. 
The War Powers Resolution has been 
around since 1973 and has never pre-
vented the President from defending 
America. So that argument simply is 
baseless, and I urge all of my col-
leagues to support both of these excel-
lent amendments. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, may I 
ask how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 31⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Texas 
has 6 minutes remaining. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, we 
have no more speakers, and I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is 
now my honor to yield 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
PELOSI), the Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. I 
thank him for his courageous leader-
ship in bringing this important legisla-
tion to the floor. 
I commend the two makers of the 
resolutions, Congresswoman BARBARA 
LEE and Congressman RO KHANNA for 
their exceptional leadership, and I urge 
a positive vote on this important legis-
lation. 
Just to put it in some perspective, as 
Members of Congress, our first respon-
sibility is to keep the American people 
safe, and that includes both our serv-
icemembers abroad and our families at 
home. Three weeks ago, this House 
honored that duty by passing the War 
Powers Resolution to limit the Presi-
dent’s military actions regarding Iran. 
We 
all 
salute 
Congresswoman 
SLOTKIN for her leadership in putting 
that forth. Now we are taking addi-
tional steps to protect American lives 
and values by passing two strong pieces 
of legislation: Congresswoman BAR-
BARA LEE’s legislation to repeal the 
2002 Iraq Authorization for the Use of 
Military Force, AUMF, and Congress-
man RO KHANNA’s legislation to pro-
hibit 
funding 
for 
military 
action 
against Iran not authorized by Con-
gress. 
We 
thank 
them 
for 
their 
long-
standing leadership to protect Amer-
ican lives, and we thank all Members 
who have worked tirelessly on this pri-
ority, including Congresswoman ESHOO

January 30, 2020 
who had similar legislation in this re-
gard. 
Members of Congress continue to 
have serious, urgent concerns about 
the President’s decision to engage in 
hostilities against Iran and about its 
lack of strategy moving forward. Let 
us just stipulate that we all agree that 
Iran is a bad actor; that they treat 
their people terribly; that they are a 
menace to the region; and that we have 
sanctions 
against 
them 
for 
their 
spreading of technologies and other re-
sources to terrorists in the region. 
We don’t want them to have a nu-
clear weapon, and I think that the 
President’s decision to withdraw from 
the nuclear agreement was wrong, but 
that is not on the floor today. What is 
on the floor today is for us to, again, 
honor our constitutional responsibility 
to protect and defend—we take that 
oath—but also to honor our respon-
sibilities, the power to declare war that 
is written into the Constitution for the 
Congress. 
Over time, that has been, shall we 
say, usurped by administrations, both 
Democratic and Republican, and now, 
to an extent that practically abrogates 
whatever is in the Constitution. 
This morning a YouGov poll said 
that 60 percent of the American people 
oppose war with Iran and 68 percent 
want to remove all troops from Iraq. 
There is no appetite for war in our 
country. I was stunned recently to be 
with a delegation in observance of the 
75th anniversary of the end of the vic-
tory at the Battle of the Bulge, a very 
decisive battle in World War II. There 
were 19,000 Americans who died in that 
war. 
There were all of the heads of state 
present, but the VIPs for us were the 
veterans who were there; some of them 
now, 75 years later, in their 90s, but 
still vigorous. One of them who spoke 
for the veterans talked about the band 
of brothers and the allies, that there 
was multilateralism, and the horrors of 
war, and the glory of that victory. But 
at the end of his speech he said: 
‘‘Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but I will. 
I urge all of you to pray for peace.’’ 
I 
spoke 
to 
him 
afterward 
and 
thanked him for that and he said: ‘‘It is 
so important.’’ 
Even our President Kennedy who said 
that we will fight any foe, pay any 
price—what he said in his inaugural ad-
dress—he has said that unless men end 
war, war will end men. 
So we have to be very careful about 
how we engage in protecting the Amer-
ican people and remove all doubt in 
anybody’s mind that we will. Think of 
me as a lioness. If you come near our 
cubs, you are dead. 
So this is not about not under-
standing our responsibility and our 
strength. But as warriors, that gives us 
even more power to be peacekeepers. 
All we are saying is: Let’s do this care-
fully and not in a way that escalates. 
I remember after that weekend I got 
the call from the administration con-
firming that we had made the attack 
on Soleimani—who was a terrible per-
son, no doubt about that—and I said: 
‘‘Well, why did you not inform the 
Gang of Eight as you were required to 
do?’’ 
That Gang of Eight are the four lead-
ers, House and Senate, Democrats and 
Republicans; and the four leaders of 
the Intelligence Committee, House and 
Senate, Democrats and Republicans. 
‘‘Why did you not inform the Gang of 
Eight?’’ 
And their response was: ‘‘We really 
had to keep this close.’’ 
You wanted to keep it ‘‘close’’ from 
not honoring your responsibility of no-
tifying or consulting with the Congress 
of the United States? 
I didn’t expect to hear that from the 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs. I did 
probably expect to hear it from the 
Secretary of Defense. But that cannot 
be the way we proceed. Congress has 
the constitutional responsibility. 
The administration has a responsi-
bility, too, and we respect that. And 
that is why when we redid the War 
Powers Act it was respectful of the 
power of the President, but also the 
power of the Congress of the United 
States. 
They failed to appropriately notify 
the 
Congress. 
Then 
the 
President 
issued an insufficient War Powers Act 
notification that raised more questions 
than it answered, and it was classified 
in its entirety, leaving the public in 
the dark about our national security. 
When the President finally briefed 
Congress, their own party Members de-
scribed the briefing as ‘‘insulting and 
demeaning’’ with one GOP Senator 
saying it was the ‘‘worst briefing I 
have ever seen.’’ 
When the President asked me if I 
agreed with that characterization, I 
said: ‘‘There is stiff competition for the 
worst classified briefing we have ever 
seen from this administration.’’ 
And now it appears that the Presi-
dent may have even misled Congress 
and the public about the threats facing 
our troops related to this conflict. For 
2 weeks, the President insisted there 
were zero injuries or casualties from 
Iran’s attack on our military bases, 
contradicting multiple news reports. 
But over the past week, the adminis-
tration has admitted that there were 
injuries, first reporting 11 servicemem-
bers who were diagnosed with trau-
matic brain injury, TBI, and then 34 
and now 50 of our troops. TBI, as de-
fined by the National Institutes of 
Health is: ‘‘ . . . damage to the brain, 
whether from impact, penetrating ob-
jects, blast waves or rapid movement of 
the brain within the skull’’ and is a 
leading cause of death and disability 
for Americans. 
This serious injury is understood in 
both the military and medical commu-
nities to be the ‘‘signature wound’’ and 
the ‘‘silent epidemic’’ of the wars in Af-
ghanistan and Iraq. 
b 1030 
Yet the President minimizes our sol-
diers’ wounds saying: 
I heard they had headaches and a 
couple of other things, but I can say 
and I can report it, not very serious. 
Not very serious? That is not what 
the Veterans of Foreign Wars says. 
The Veterans of Foreign Wars put 
out a statement saying they expect an 
apology from POTUS. TBI is a serious 
injury and not one that can be taken 
lightly. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
include 
their 
statement for the RECORD. 
VFW EXPECTS APOLOGY FROM POTUS 
[January 24, 2020] 
KANSAS CITY, MO.—‘‘In light of today’s an-
nouncement from the defense department 
that 34 U.S. service members suffered trau-
matic brain injuries as a result of Iran’s re-
taliatory strike and President Trump’s re-
marks which minimized these troops’ inju-
ries, the Veterans of Foreign Wars cannot 
stand idle on this matter. 
TBI is a serious injury and one that cannot 
be taken lightly. TBI is known to cause de-
pression, memory loss, severe headaches, diz-
ziness and fatigue—all injuries that come 
with both short- and long-term effects. 
The VFW expects an apology from the 
president to our service men and women for 
his misguided remarks. And, we ask that he 
and the White House join with us in our ef-
forts to educate Americans of the dangers 
TBI has on these heroes as they protect our 
great nation in these trying times. Our war-
riors require our full support more than ever 
in this challenging environment.’’—William 
‘‘Doc’’ Schmitz, VFW National Commander 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, Ameri-
cans have a choice: to keep the Amer-
ican people safe or to enable the ad-
ministration’s 
dangerous 
escalation 
which is happening again without the 
consent of Congress or the knowledge 
of the public. 
We want to see a strategy. What is 
the purpose? What is the mission? 
What is the strategy involved in this? 
Madam Speaker, I urge the President 
to work with Congress to advance an 
immediate and effective deescalatory 
strategy that prevents further vio-
lence. 
Our brave servicemen and -women, 
their families, and all Americans de-
serve smart, strong, and strategic ac-
tion, not the administration’s reckless 
and rash policies. Therefore, again, I 
urge our colleagues to support the 
Khanna amendment and the Barbara 
Lee amendment. 
I thank them for their leadership. I 
thank Chairman ENGEL for the modera-
tion that he has brought to this, the 
experience that he has in terms of war, 
in terms of peace, and in terms of Con-
gress’ role in our foreign affairs. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time to 
close. 
Madam Speaker, as I have said re-
peatedly, I am strongly in favor of ex-
ercising our solemn Article I authority 
for matters of war and peace; but we 
are not at war with Iran, we are not en-
gaged in hostilities, and the President 
is not trying to start a war with Iran. 
I have been in the White House, and 
I have heard him say this personally. 
In fact, he has shown incredible re-
straint against Iran after they shot

down our drone, after they hit 50 per-
cent of the Saudi oil fields, after they 
killed an American, and after they 
wounded four soldiers. 
My Democratic colleagues know very 
well there are many situations short of 
war which require military action. In 
fact, they supported President Obama’s 
thousands of unauthorized strikes in 
Libya which were not even related to 
the protection of Americans overseas. 
I believe it is hypocritical and dan-
gerous for the majority to tie this 
President’s hands in responding to the 
very real and growing threats that Iran 
and its proxies pose to Americans in 
the Middle East. As I said, they killed 
an 
American 
contractor 
and 
they 
launched a massive attack against our 
Embassy in Baghdad. 
For those Members who think it was 
a minor brush against the Embassy, 
look at these photos. Look at the dam-
age that was done to our United States 
Embassy. It is absolutely disgraceful. 
Soleimani had an imminent plot 
when he went to Damascus, Lebanon, 
and Baghdad to meet with his number 
two guy to go to the Ayatollah to get 
the green light to get out further oper-
ations to kill diplomats and American 
soldiers. The idea that that strike on 
Soleimani was not justified, I don’t 
know what more evidence was required 
than this. 
Then, after this, they launched anti-
ballistic missiles against United States 
military bases. They launched dozens 
of ballistic missiles at U.S. Forces, 
causing, as the Speaker said, traumatic 
brain injury in at least 50 U.S. service-
men. 
Again, what more do we need? 
It is unconscionable at this point in 
time, with this happening at this time 
in history, to limit the President’s 
ability to respond as needed to protect 
American lives from this vicious re-
gime. This time I think the Democrats 
have gone too far. 
Like President Reagan said, I believe 
in peace through strength, and it is my 
sincere hope that we will not need to 
launch another strike like the Presi-
dent did against Qasem Soleimani, but 
it did make the world a safer place. 
Unfortunately, the enemy also gets a 
vote. If Iran doubts our resolve to re-
spond forcefully, then it will surely af-
fect their calculus moving forward 
about 
whether 
to 
attack 
America 
again. 
In opposing this amendment, I am 
standing with the Iranian people. It is 
important that they hear this. I know 
they are hearing this because I have so 
many Iranian friends who tell me that 
what we say here in this Chamber 
means something. The people of Iran 
are listening, and when they see a di-
vided Congress, that sends the worst 
message at the absolute worst time. 
I want to let the American citizens 
there in the Middle East know that 
they deserve to be covered by the um-
brella of our great men and women in 
uniform. They deserve the protection 
of our government. If their lives are 
threatened, I do not view them as a hy-
pothetical. They are real people rep-
resenting our country abroad, and I 
will not let them be vulnerable. 
So, Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this amendment for 
the second time this Congress because 
it divides the Nation and sends a wrong 
message at the wrong time to the peo-
ple of Iran. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, for too many years, 
Congress has allowed administration 
after administration after administra-
tion to sideline us in critical foreign 
policy matters. It is time we said 
enough is enough, particularly when it 
comes to when and where the United 
States military is engaged around the 
world. 
As I have said before, if killing 
Soleimani was about retaliating for 
past bad acts by Iran, then that is ex-
actly when the law requires the Presi-
dent to work with Congress. The Presi-
dent didn’t work with us. Instead, he 
told the American people there was an 
imminent threat with no evidence to 
support that claim, once again moving 
ahead and making Congress irrelevant. 
We have seen that done with Chief 
Executives of both parties, and it is 
time we stood up and said: No, enough 
is enough; only Congress can declare 
war. 
I know I sound like a broken record, 
but I think that is the crucial spot of 
what we are talking about here. Con-
gress cannot just be swept along for 
the ride. Congress has the power to de-
clare war. 
The American people are sick of per-
petual war. If we don’t do everything in 
our power to make sure this adminis-
tration cannot plunge us into another 
war that we don’t want, then we will 
have let the American people down. 
Again, for too many years, Congress 
has allowed administration after ad-
ministration after administration to 
sideline us on critical foreign policy 
matters; and, again, it is time to say 
enough is enough. That is what we are 
attempting to do today, and that is 
why I urge my colleagues to support 
this very important bill. 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CROW. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the bills offered by Representatives 
LEE and KHANNA to reassert Congress’s con-
stitutional role in authorizing the use of military 
force. 
It was an honor to serve my country in Iraq 
and Afghanistan, but I also witnessed the con-
sequences of sending Americans into harm’s 
way without defined goals and a clear exit 
strategy. 
For the past 17 years, that authorization has 
sent hundreds of thousands of American men 
and women to war in Iraq. We are now faced 
with the prospect of another confrontation in 
the Middle East, this time with Iran, that risks 
repeating some of the mistakes of the past. 
The most solemn responsibility of Congress 
is the decision to send our men and women 
into harm’s way. Authorizations granted by 
Congress should be revoked once the original 
purpose has ended. But Congress has al-
lowed authorizations to live far past their in-
tended life and abdicated its Constitutional au-
thority in matters of war and diplomacy. Until 
now. 
The bills offered by my colleagues reclaim 
Congress’s constitutional role in determining 
when we send our sons, daughters, mothers, 
and fathers to fight on our behalf. They ensure 
that the American people have a voice in mak-
ing such significant decisions. Through the 
leadership of my colleagues, this chamber is 
ensuring that any future use of military force 
must be subject to the rigorous debate the 
American people expect. 
I applaud the leadership of Representatives 
LEE and KHANNA on this important issue and 
I urge my colleagues to join me in reasserting 
Congress’s role in deciding when to use mili-
tary force by voting yes on these bills. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 2456, a resolu-
tion to repeal the Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. 
Madam Speaker, the President’s interpreta-
tion of the 2002 AUMF as a blank check for 
military intervention in the Middle East is cer-
tainly troublesome. It is because of this abuse 
that the United States has been involved in a 
seemingly endless conflict in the region, as 
demonstrated in the Administration’s justifica-
tion for the recent strikes in Iran. 
A repeal of the 2002 AUMF is a step in the 
right direction towards ending the cycle of mili-
tary interventionism in the Middle East. Our 
foreign policy must instead be guided by diplo-
macy and collective dialogue; only with military 
action as a last resort can we build peace in 
the region. 
This bill will send a clear message to the 
President that the power to declare war begins 
and ends in Congress. I plan to vote in favor 
of it and would urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 811, 
the previous question is ordered on this 
portion of the divided question. 
The question is: Will the House con-
cur in the Senate amendment with the 
House amendment specified in section 
4(a) of House Resolution 811? 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, on that

The yeas and nays were ordered.

ceedings on this question will be post-

TITLE II—REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION 
FOR USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST 
IRAQ RESOLUTION OF 2002 
SEC. 201. REPEAL OF AUTHORIZATION FOR USE 
OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ 
RESOLUTION OF 2002. 
The Authorization for Use of Military 
Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public 
Law 107–243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) is hereby re-
pealed. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. This 
portion shall be debatable for 1 hour 
equally divided and controlled by the 
chair and ranking minority member of 
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ENGEL) and the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. MCCAUL) each will control 30 min-
utes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, let me start by 
thanking my friend, Representative 
LEE from California, for her hard work 
on this amendment. As you know, she 
is the newest newlywed in the House of 
Representatives, so we congratulate 
her on a great new marriage and wish 
her and her husband a long life to-
gether. 
She is a principled, passionate leader 
when it comes to standing up for Con-
gress’ role and responsibility in foreign 
affairs, particularly war powers. I am 
proud to be a cosponsor of her legisla-
tion. I am glad we are able to partner 
on such an important issue. 
Madam Speaker, it has been nearly 
two decades since the House voted to 
authorize the war in Iraq. I wish we 
could have that vote to do over again 
knowing what we know now. We were 
led into war on phony intelligence and 
found 
our 
brave 
servicemembers 
bogged down there for years at such 
tragic costs. 
The war is over, and it is long past 
time 
that 
the 
authority 
Congress 
granted to fight that war should be re-
moved from the books—because we see 
how it is being misused. 
Earlier this month we heard the ar-
gument that the Iraq war authoriza-
tion would justify military action 
against Iran. Here is how the argument 
goes: 
The executive branch says that this 
authorization can be used to deal with 
any threat emanating—I stress the 
word, ‘‘emanating’’—from Iraq. Yes, 
you heard it right, emanating from 
Iraq. 
That is just wrong. It is not what the 
authorization says. It is not what Con-
gress intended when it passed that res-
olution. I was here. I remember it. It 
dealt with threats coming from Sad-
dam Hussein’s Iraq. Saddam Hussein is 
dead. His government and regime are 
long gone. 
This war authorization has no rel-
evance to present-day Iraq, and it 
should be repealed. It should not be 
used to launch more military action. 
Now, we will likely hear an argument 
that repealing the Iraq war resolution 
would undermine our ability to combat 
terrorism around the world. But let’s 
be clear about something: the Iraq war 
resolution—what we are seeking to re-
peal today—was never intended to au-
thorize our fight against ISIS or other 
associated terrorist groups, and it is 
not needed as authorization for any of 
these operations. 
There is another existing authoriza-
tion for the use of military force, the 
measure that Congress passed after 9/11 
to deal with al-Qaida. I don’t agree 
with the administration’s overly ex-
pansive 
interpretation 
of 
the 
9/11 
AUMF. I think they have stretched it 
well beyond what Congress ever in-
tended. But even this administration 
has said clearly that they can continue 
current 
counterterrorism 
operation 
using the post-9/11 authorization even 
if we repeal the 2002 Iraq war author-
ization. 
The only time this administration 
has pointed to the 2002 Iraq war author-
ization as its only source of congres-
sional authority is the strike against 
Soleimani, something Congress never 
intended. We cannot allow this Presi-
dent or any President to claim Con-
gress has already authorized him to at-
tack Iranian officials. 
If the President wants to use mili-
tary force against Iran, then he has to 
come to Congress, plain and simple. An 
administration certainly shouldn’t be 
twisting a decades-old authorization to 
justify plunging us into a war the 
American people don’t want and that 
Congress has not authorized. 
I get back to what I said before: Only 
Congress can declare war, not the 
President, and we have had violation 
after violation after violation about 
this important matter. It is time that 
Congress reassert its constitutional 
role in declaring war or not declaring 
war, so it is long past time that we re-
peal this outdated war authorization. 
The House has already voted to do so 
with bipartisan support. 
I hope all of my colleagues will join 
me in supporting this measure and tak-
ing these important steps in reclaiming 
Congress’ authority over war powers. 
I thank Ms. LEE, who has the fore-
sight to be courageous and stand all 
alone because she believes something is 
right. That is what we are trying to do 
now. We are trying to do what is right, 
what is right for our country. 
Again, what is right for our country 
is that Congress needs to grab the bull 
by the horns. Congress has the author-
ity to declare war, not the President, 
not any President—Congress. We are 
reclaiming Congress’ authority over 
war powers the way it was intended. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
b 1045 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly oppose 
repealing the Authorization for Use of 
Military Force to ‘‘defend the national 
security of the United States against 
the continuing threat posed by Iraq.’’ 
We should not be repealing current 
counterterrorism 
authorities 
unless 
and until we have replaced them with 
an updated AUMF that clearly allows 
us to confront the enemies that con-
tinue to threaten our Nation, our peo-
ple, and our allies. 
As I have stated before, I would pre-
fer a new, updated AUMF. But in the 13 
months 
our 
Democratic 
colleagues 
have been in charge, we have seen no 
such proposal from the majority. In 
fact, they haven’t even started that 
conversation. 
None of us want to see the extension 
of any conflict beyond what is nec-
essary, but we also have learned that 
premature disengagement can have 
huge costs, such as when the Obama 
administration’s rush to withdraw U.S. 
troops out of Iraq contributed to the 
deadly rise of ISIS in Iraq and Syria 
and the formation of the caliphate. 
The 2002 Iraq AUMF was not only 
used against Saddam Hussein; it also 
identified al-Qaida and ‘‘other inter-
national terrorist organizations, in-
cluding organizations that threaten 
the lives and safety of United States 
citizens.’’ 
So those on the other side who say 
this only applies to Saddam Hussein, 
that is absolutely incorrect. It applies 
to international terrorist organizations 
like al-Qaida. 
Members will recall that al-Qaida in 
Iraq 
later 
became 
ISIS, 
a 
brutal 
transnational 
terrorist 
organization 
that continues to threaten American 
lives and interests in our homeland. 
And for that reason, President Obama 
used the 2002 AUMF as legal authority 
for his military operations against 
ISIS in Iraq. 
The current administration opposes 
repealing the 2002 AUMF because it 
‘‘remains an important source of addi-
tional authority for military oper-
ations against ISIS in Iraq and to de-
fend the national security of the 
United States against threats ema-
nating from Iraq.’’ 
As my colleagues know, these vital 
counter-ISIS operations continue. Re-
pealing that authorization without a 
replacement endangers not only the 
United States’ national security, but 
our coalition partners, most notably, 
Iraq. 
The 2002 AUMF was most recently in-
voked for our January 2 strike on 
Qasem Soleimani, Iran’s mastermind of 
terror, who killed more than 600 Amer-
icans, wounded thousands more, and 
orchestrated the fiery New Year’s at-
tack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
It was a targeted, defensive strike in 
Iraq against a designated terrorist by 
the Obama administration who threat-
ened U.S. Forces inside Iraq. 
In 
the 
2 
months 
beforehand, 
Soleimani and his proxies launched a 
dozen attacks against U.S. personnel in 
Iraq, killing one American and wound-
ing four U.S. servicemen near Kirkuk 
on December 27. And then, further-
more, as we saw in the photographs

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE

January 30, 2020 
from the previous argument, the Em-
bassy was attacked in a very strong 
way. 
I don’t know what more evidence the 
President needed to respond under Ar-
ticle 
II 
in 
self-defense than this, 
Madam Speaker. And if he did not do 
so, he would be derelict in his responsi-
bility. 
And if he didn’t stop the plot that we 
know Soleimani was getting ready to 
move forward after he went to Damas-
cus and Lebanon and Baghdad to go to 
the Ayatollah to get the green light to 
kill more Americans and diplomats, 
then what would the American people 
say? 
What if we had a storm on the Em-
bassy like in 1979, then what? 
I think the President was restrained. 
I think he did the right thing at the 
right time. It was an appropriate use of 
this AUMF, which states that Iraq 
‘‘poses a continuing threat to the na-
tional security of the United States 
. . . by, among other things . . . har-
boring terrorist organizations.’’ 
Contrary to some of the rhetoric we 
heard 3 weeks ago, the administration 
does not claim that the 2002 AUMF 
gives them a blank check—as we have 
heard quite a bit on the other side—to 
attack Iran. 
To the contrary—this is very impor-
tant—the 
administration, 
and 
the 
President has told me personally, they 
have stated publicly that it has never 
interpreted the 2002 Iraq AUMF to pro-
vide authority for strikes inside of Iran 
or for war with Iran. Soleimani was in 
Baghdad, designated by Obama as a 
terrorist. 
The President is also not seeking war 
with Iran. He has said this time and 
time again, and he gets misquoted on 
this time and time again. 
The President has shown great re-
straint time and again after Iran’s in-
creasing provocations. I was actually 
quite surprised, after our U.S. military 
drones were struck down, there wasn’t 
a response. And as he told the Nation 
and the world, he wants a deal that al-
lows Iran to thrive and prosper. 
Repealing this AUMF does not retro-
actively remove the President’s ability 
to order his justified and limited strike 
on Soleimani. A repeal standing alone 
will only send the wrong message to 
our troops, our partners, our enemies, 
and our terrorist adversaries in Iraq. 
To be sure, the 2002 AUMF should be 
replaced with new authorities—after 
all, it is almost 20 years old—that re-
flect current circumstances and pro-
vide our men and women in uniform 
with clear support for their critical 
missions that protect us. And it also 
gives the American people a voice in 
that. 
I deeply regret that my colleagues 
are not serious enough about exer-
cising our Article I authority to put 
forward a real, updated alternative to 
counter the persistent terrorist threats 
that we see in Iraq, Syria, and else-
where. 
Therefore, I see today’s effort as 
nothing more than a political message 
that does nothing to that end. It ties 
the hands of the President at a time 
when he is responsibly facing down a 
very dangerous Iranian regime, the Is-
lamic Republic of Iran, the largest 
state sponsor of terrorism, that lives 
by the motto, ‘‘Death to America.’’ 
These critical constitutional issues 
of war and peace deserve better than 
that. I think if we are serious, we will 
work on both sides of the aisle. I know 
my Conference has great interest in 
working on a modernized 2002 AUMF, 
and I hope the other side can join us in 
that effort in the following year. 
But, with respect to this, with no re-
placement, it would be very dangerous. 
It would tie our hands’ ability to at-
tack ISIS in Iraq. I think it is ill-ad-
vised, and, for that reason, I oppose it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
California (Ms. LEE), the newlywed and 
author of this important amendment. 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, first let me thank the chair-
man of our Foreign Affairs Committee, 
Mr. ENGEL, for his kind words of con-
gratulations and also for his persistent 
and steady leadership on this issue and 
so many issues. 
I also want to take a moment to 
thank Speaker PELOSI; Majority Lead-
er HOYER; our whip, Mr. CLYBURN; and 
also Congresswoman JAYAPAL and Con-
gressman POCAN. And I have to give a 
shout-out to my staff; our legislative 
director, Emma Mehrabi; my chief of 
staff, Julie Nickson; all of Team LEE; 
Mr. ENGEL’s staff; all of our staffs who 
have come together, who have exhib-
ited such an unwavering dedication and 
patriotism on this issue. 
My bipartisan amendment before us 
today, Madam Speaker, would repeal 
the 2002 Iraq Authorization for Use of 
Military Force, AUMF. 
It is important to note that nearly 75 
percent of current Members were not 
serving when this AUMF was passed in 
2002. I have long fought to repeal this. 
And what we knew then is that the 2003 
invasion of Iraq was based on lies told 
by our own executive branch. 
Let me remind you now that, in 2002, 
I stood here and urged us not to rush 
into war. I offered an amendment to 
the AUMF that was presented that 
would have prevented the war by re-
quiring 
the 
inspectors 
to 
allow 
verifiable information with regard to 
the alleged weapons of mass destruc-
tion before we took military action. 
That amendment received 72 votes. 
But had it passed, it would have ex-
posed the false intelligence that the 
war was based on. There were no weap-
ons of mass destruction in Iraq. That is 
what the 2002 authorization authorized 
and was about. 
So I stand here once again urging 
Congress to do its job, this time by re-
pealing the long-outdated and unneces-
sary 2002 AUMF. Not only is it not 
needed for any current counterterror-
ism operations, but repealing it would 
have absolutely no impact on the ad-
ministration’s ongoing military oper-
ations. 
Let me be clear: Congress passed the 
2002 AUMF to address the perceived 
threat posed by the regime of Saddam 
Hussein. U.S. military deployments 
and operations carried out under this 
AUMF, dubbed Operation Iraqi Free-
dom, officially ended in 2011. Almost 18 
years after the resolution’s passage, 
the United States recognizes the sov-
ereignty of Iraq and considers the Iraqi 
Government a key ally. 
Madam Speaker, leaving this author-
ization on the books is both dangerous 
and irresponsible. Doing so would allow 
any administration to use it for mili-
tary action that Congress never in-
tended to authorize. It will continue to 
allow these wars without end. 
Congress must make clear that any 
President must seek specific authoriza-
tion for the use of force against Iran or 
any country. The 2002 AUMF was spe-
cifically authorized to rid Iraq of weap-
ons of mass destruction which did not 
exist. That is why this is so important 
and something that we have already 
voted on, as our chairman indicated. 
Make no mistake: We are here today 
to rein in this President and any Presi-
dent, rein in their abuse of executive 
power, and to make clear that Congress 
has the sole constitutional duty to de-
clare war and authorize the use of 
force. 
This should not be a partisan issue. 
Part of that responsibility is in ensur-
ing that authorizations do not remain 
indefinitely, leaving them subject to 
use far outside those which Congress 
intended. 
For example, the Trump administra-
tion has said that the 2002 AUMF has 
been used to justify attacks on Iran. 
These arguments have absolutely no 
basis in reality, underscoring the need 
for immediate action by Congress. 
That is why the outdated AUMF must 
be repealed, to prevent further abuse 
by this administration. We can’t allow 
any irrational decisionmaking to drag 
us into an unnecessary and cata-
strophic war of choice in the Middle 
East. 
And, Madam Speaker, let me just re-
mind you of this. As the daughter of a 
veteran who served valiantly in two 
wars, I know personally the cost and 
consequences of war. I know that they 
are grave. 
Several thousands of our brave serv-
icemen were killed, thousands more 
have permanent injuries, seen and un-
seen. We have witnessed the horrific 
rise of suicide and deep strains placed 
on our military families, and we must 
always remember the tens of thousands 
of Iraqis killed as well and trillions of 
taxpayer dollars spent. 
Of course, the unnecessary U.S. inva-
sion of Iraq also sparked, yes, the rise 
of ISIS and allowed Iran to establish a 
presence in Iraq. 
Madam Speaker, we all know that 
our top priority is to protect our na-
tional security, our brave troops, our

allies, and the American people. It is 
past time to finally exercise our con-
stitutional duty and muster the cour-
age to vote on matters of war and 
peace. 
Madam Speaker, I again thank Mr. 
ENGEL and my colleagues, and I urge 
them to vote ‘‘yes’’ on this amend-
ment. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. PERRY), whose four 
decades of uniformed service to our Na-
tion included 40 combat missions in 
Iraq before his retirement last year as 
a general in the United States Army. 
b 1100 
Mr. 
PERRY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman from Texas. 
Madam Speaker, it wasn’t part of my 
remarks, but from my standpoint, 
when I was in Iraq, we found weapons 
of mass destruction, so let’s just make 
that part of the RECORD. 
None of us want to be in a war with 
Iran, with Iraq, with anybody, for that 
matter—and that includes the Presi-
dent. None of us want that. And many 
of us on this side agree with our col-
leagues that this needs to be updated 
to reflect current circumstances, cur-
rent enemy capabilities, and different 
tactics, 
techniques, and procedures 
used by our enemy. But I wonder where 
my colleagues in this Congress have 
been. They would have you believe that 
they were impotent, that they were 
helpless, unable to do anything about 
this. 
I listened to the Speaker’s remarks, 
and she said the President didn’t in-
form 
her 
of 
the 
strike 
against 
Soleimani. For 8 years, Madam Speak-
er, nearly 4,000 people were taken off 
the planet by the previous administra-
tion. Do the math; that is over one a 
day. I wonder if the Speaker got a call 
every single day that said: ‘‘We are 
going to take this terrorist off the bat-
tlefield.’’ I highly doubt that. 
The question is about how we are 
going to change the policy, because 
like I said, many of us agree the policy 
needs to be updated. I would hope that 
this Congress, that any Congress, has 
the courage to understand that when 
we sent our finest into battle in Iraq, 
that they are fighting two enemies, but 
we are only allowed to engage one. 
Right now, as we speak, we have 
servicemembers in Iraq that are de-
pending on us to have their backs. But 
what are we going to do? We are going 
to rip the rug right out from under-
neath their feet because suddenly, 
under this administration, Congress 
suddenly has the courage. 
I offered an AUMF 7 years ago and 
talked to my friends on the other side 
of the aisle. They didn’t want to talk 
about it at all, nothing. 
Our servicemembers expect us to 
have their backs. We welcome the de-
bate, but there is no debate. This 
should be in the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs, where we can discuss these 
very weighty issues. We are looking 
forward to that; we want that. But, no, 
this is a coin bill taken from the Sen-
ate and sent back over here with this 
put into it so we would have no debate. 
They don’t want debate. 
Our enemies are watching, and they 
are waiting. They are waiting for Iraq 
to become a free-fire zone, which is 
what it is going to become. 
The last time, after the 4,500 un-
timely deaths of your American citi-
zens, the executive decision was just to 
walk away—no ramp down, no policy, 
no strategy. Just walk away and leave 
the family members of those who had 
lost their loved ones wondering: What 
was that for? 
You know what we have learned from 
that, 
Madam 
Speaker? 
Apparently 
nothing. 
We want to do this, and we want to 
do this correctly, but this isn’t the cor-
rect way to do it, and we should not 
abandon our servicemembers in com-
bat. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), a valued member 
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of my good friend BAR-
BARA LEE’s longstanding amendment, 
which would repeal the 2002 Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force against 
Iraq. 
More than 17 years ago, Congress 
passed a resolution authorizing the 
equivalent of war with Iraq, a war I op-
posed then. It stretches credulity to 
claim that same resolution now ex-
tends authorization to the President’s 
order to assassinate a foreign leader 
from Iran. Yet, that is precisely what 
the White House would have you be-
lieve. 
This AUMF is obsolete, and it is far 
past time that Congress make crystal 
clear to the administration, our allies, 
and our adversaries, as well as our con-
stituents, 
the 
circumstances 
under 
which we would authorize engagement 
by our men and women in uniform. 
The Lee amendment repeals a mis-
guided AUMF that has had disastrous 
consequences, and it reasserts Con-
gress’ Article I authorities as provided 
and mandated by the Constitution of 
the United States. 
Let’s live up to our constitutional re-
sponsibility. Madam Speaker, let’s sup-
port this amendment and get back to 
constitutional 
responsibilities 
and 
powers. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Nebraska (Mr. BACON), who was de-
ployed to the Middle East four times 
during his 30-year career with the 
United States Air Force before his re-
tirement as a brigadier general. 
Mr. BACON. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong opposition to this 
amendment and to the disrespectful 
manner in which it was brought to the 
people’s House. 
It is strategically reckless and naive, 
and both amendments politicize our 
most serious constitutional obligation 
and willfully bypass regular order just 
to score political points against our 
President. 
Like many of my colleagues and my 
fellow veterans in the House, I agree it 
is long past due to update the two Au-
thorizations for Use of Military Force 
now in effect. We owe our citizens and 
servicemembers an honest debate on 
the use of military force. Madam 
Speaker, 18 years is too long for this 
AUMF. We are not living up to our con-
stitutional duties. 
But let’s be clear: This is not what 
this amendment does. Rather than con-
front reality that American security at 
home requires the principled use of 
force abroad, repealing the 2002 AUMF 
without a replacement will trigger our 
immediate withdrawal from Iraq. 
Our military leaders have been clear. 
Without the 2002 AUMF or a suitable 
replacement, 
they 
cannot 
continue 
their missions in Iraq and defend them-
selves against Iranian-backed militias, 
the same militias that killed another 
American last month and attacked us 
again just 3 days ago. 
Ask yourselves: Who benefits from 
this vote? It is Iran. Who loses from 
this vote? It is Iraq, the Kurds, and 
every U.S. partner in the Middle East. 
Our security will be compromised. 
To our Democratic colleagues, you 
may think this is a free vote, that the 
Senate may not support or a veto will 
give you cover, but you would be 
wrong. A vote to repeal the 2002 AUMF 
without a replacement will embolden 
Iran and ISIS and sends an unmistak-
able message to every U.S. partner 
around the world that Congress has 
lost its resolve and that partisanship 
trumps America’s national security 
and reason. 
For the record, attaching these two 
provisions to a Congressional Gold 
Medal vote for the purpose of avoiding 
a motion to recommit is beneath the 
dignity of this Chamber and shameful 
by the majority, and it is disrespectful 
to the World War II veterans it recog-
nizes. 
Madam Speaker, I oppose this feck-
less amendment. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, let me 
say that no one on this side needs to be 
lectured to about preserving America’s 
role in the world. I just think that we 
don’t think there should be a blank 
check for war. 
I will mention a couple of things that 
are relevant here. The 2001 AUMF 
passed after 9/11 authorizes counterter-
rorism operations. The 2002 AUMF has 
nothing to do with counterterrorism 
operations, al-Qaida, or ISIS. It specifi-
cally says the threat posed by Iraq, not 
al-Qaida. The reference to al-Qaida is 
in the findings, not in the authoriza-
tion. 
It does not need to be replaced be-
cause the 2001 AUMF is still in the 
books. The administration has been 
clear with Congress that counterterror-
ism operations would not stop if the 
2002 AUMF is repealed. 
I would note that it is the President’s 
recent actions in the Middle East that

have posed challenges to our efforts to 
defeat ISIS. The United States has had 
to cease operations against ISIS be-
cause our military is needed for force 
protection after the Soleimani strike. 
So if there is anything that has posed 
an obstacle to our fight against ter-
rorism, it is the recent actions of the 
administration. I think a little thing 
should be put into perspective here. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
ESPAILLAT), a valued member of the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs. 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, 
for far too long, Congress has allowed 
the executive branch to usurp its con-
stitutional responsibility of the power 
to go to war. Now, we have seen how a 
President can misuse one of his most 
solemn responsibilities as Commander 
in Chief. 
The 2002 AUMF, which was built on a 
lie, on a lie of weapons of mass destruc-
tion, is long irrelevant and must be re-
pealed. 
The American people do not want 
war. The American people do not want 
war. Yet, the President has escalated 
the prospects of war in the Middle East 
in a way that has not only severely en-
dangered U.S. interests and diplomacy 
to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear 
weapon but has also resulted in the in-
jury of at least 50 American service-
members. 
We must repeal the 2002 AUMF be-
cause the President has not been given 
the authority to go to war. And we 
must exercise the power of the purse 
and ensure that no funds are used for 
an unwanted, unauthorized war. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend, also from Texas. He 
has made wonderful points. 
For those of us who have studied his-
tory—especially in my case, spending 
my life studying history—you know 
one thing if you really understand his-
tory: Weakness is provocative. 
There was no better display than in 
1979, November 4, actually. I was at 
Fort Benning, in the Army there. We 
took notice when our Embassy was at-
tacked, and we had a very weak Presi-
dent who went about begging Iran to 
let our people go without any threat. 
We just wanted diplomacy. Iran then 
and now does not understand the weak-
ness they perceive from diplomacy un-
less there is a hammer behind it. 
We are here today to vote on two 
amendments. One, of course, has al-
ready been discussed, titled ‘‘No War 
with Iran Act.’’ The other is titled 
‘‘Repeal of Authorization for Use of 
Military Force Against Iraq Resolution 
of 2002.’’ 
Some of us have been wanting a new 
AUMF since we got here. During the 
Obama administration, it was clear we 
weren’t going to get that. I appreciated 
Chairman McKeon allowing me to 
come up with language to try to make 
it a little better, but he made me stay 
in a back room to write the language 
so the Democrats in the Senate didn’t 
know it was me who was doing the lan-
guage. That might have created a prob-
lem. We made some amendments, but 
we needed a new AUMF. 
Where were my friends across the 
aisle when, out of no vital interest, as 
our own Secretary of Defense said on 
television, our President decided to at-
tack Libya, the President of Libya who 
had blood on his hands from the 1980s 
and 1990s, but he had opened his doors 
and let us tell him what weapons they 
could have and not have? He was not a 
threat. 
Look, we need a new AUMF, but the 
message that this will send to Iran is: 
Not only is this group trying to throw 
this President out and weaken him 
every which way they can, but now 
they are going to take away any power 
to kill somebody like Soleimani, which 
he just did. 
If he was still alive, it appears clear 
there would be Americans dying. 
Look, let’s vote this down. Let’s 
work together on a new AUMF that 
doesn’t send word to our enemies that 
‘‘President Trump is too weak to do 
anything,’’ because he is not. Quit 
sending that message. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Ms. SPANBERGER), a valued mem-
ber of the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs, one of our newer members. 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of repealing the 
2002 AUMF. The repeal of this author-
ization, which in 2002 authorized our 
use of military force in Saddam Hus-
sein’s Iraq, would have no effect— 
none—on current U.S. military oper-
ations. 
To be clear, as a former CIA officer 
who worked counterterrorism issues, 
our own Nation’s security is always my 
priority. 
Today’s vote is about that, our na-
tional security and the responsibility 
of Congress to exercise its constitu-
tional authority over decisions of war 
and peace. It is not about one par-
ticular President, party, or administra-
tion. It is about Congress’ constitu-
tional responsibility, our duty to de-
bate and vote on sending our Nation’s 
servicemembers off to war. 
But Congress has long evaded this 
duty, allowing President after Presi-
dent to use the 2001 AUMF—not this 
one, the one we are discussing today— 
to authorize varied military operations 
without 
Congress 
taking 
responsi-
bility. 
And after nearly two decades, the 
American people have waited to see 
principled leadership on ending the 
cycle of endless war. We must update 
the 2001 AUMF. But today’s vote is on 
the now-defunct 2002 AUMF. Repealing 
this AUMF is a good first step towards 
Congress taking responsibility on be-
half of the servicemembers we rep-
resent.

Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCARTHY), the Repub-
lican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in opposition to the House 
amendments to H.R. 550. 
Before I explain why, I need to ad-
dress what has become an all-too-fre-
quent occurrence in this esteemed 
body, the abuse of power by the Demo-
crat majority. We saw it during im-
peachment, and we are seeing it again 
now. 
Today, Democrats are denying basic 
and essential floor rights to the Repub-
licans as we consider these two flawed 
Iran measures. Specifically, by consid-
ering these measures as amendments 
to an unrelated, Gold Medal bill, the 
majority is intentionally using a par-
tisan procedural gimmick to silence 
dissenting opinions. Even RO KHANNA 
recently admitted as much. He didn’t 
want a vote on an amendment that 
could ‘‘divide the caucus.’’ 
Leader HOYER did not respond to my 
letter that I recently sent him; the 
idea of eliminating a motion to recom-
mit. We appealed to address these con-
cerns and were rejected on the floor 
over and over again; 25 times, to be 
exact. 
And no Republican amendments were 
ruled in order, including my amend-
ment with Ranking Member COLE that 
would have allowed the President to 
use force if there was an imminent 
threat against the United States or our 
ally, Israel. Democrats were too afraid 
to debate that. 
We can all agree that the decision to 
go to war is the most significant choice 
Congress can make, followed only by 
impeachment. 
And we could also agree, as Leader 
HOYER recently said, that ‘‘more Mem-
bers from across the ideological spec-
trum need to have input into the work 
we do’’ in the House. 
These measures should be withdrawn 
until the Republicans’ rights are fully 
restored. This tactic purposely elimi-
nates Republicans’ last opportunity to 
amend legislation, the motion to re-
commit. 
Now, for 100 years, in this body, the 
motion to recommit has given the mi-
nority the right to—and let’s quote— 
‘‘have a vote upon its position upon 
great public questions.’’ That is the 
definition of a motion to recommit. 
‘‘Have a vote upon its position upon 
great public questions.’’ 
In other words, MTRs allow constitu-
ents whose Members are in the minor-
ity to have their voices heard. Cer-
tainly, I would think this issue before 
us would meet the standard of a great 
public question. 
As referred to earlier, I sent that let-
ter to Leader HOYER earlier this week, 
the procedural gimmick is not only 
wrong, it is in bad faith. The House has 
never debated matters of war and peace 
in such an irregular and restrictive 
manner. 
What’s more, Speaker PELOSI gave 
her word that her majority would not

govern like this. Just last May, she 
claimed to be ‘‘a big respecter’’ of mi-
nority rights. 
You know what is so ironic about all 
of this? The use of this is very rare 
throughout the history of this entire 
body, a body we all respect. 
What is most depressing is people 
talk a bigger game than they show in 
their actions. 
Let me show you a little research on 
how often this tactic has ever been 
used. It wasn’t used ever on war, prob-
ably the most significant thing we 
would debate on this floor. But we are 
using a Gold Medal bill we already 
voted for, just for a gimmick. 
In fact, in the 110th Congress, 16 
times House bills with a Senate amend-
ment were considered, and there was 
not one MTR given to the minority. If 
I have to refresh your memory, in the 
110th Congress, Democrats were in the 
majority. 
Compare that to in the Republican- 
led 109th Congress, which only debated 
one message, one time, under a rule 
like this. You know what the majority 
Republican-led 
Congress 
did 
then? 
They provided the minority with an 
amendment to compensate for the loss 
of a motion to recommit; something 
this majority has failed to do, again. 
There is a difference between our two 
parties, and there is no bigger example 
than the tactic used today. 
If Democrats will not withdraw these 
amendments, the House should vote 
them down immediately. This is a ter-
rible time to be considering a repeal of 
the 2002 AUMF, a key authority to pro-
tect ourselves from the Iranian-backed 
militias in Iraq. 
The Soleimani strike delivered a 
clear message to Iran: If you kill a U.S. 
citizen, 
you 
will 
suffer 
the 
con-
sequences. For the first time in years, 
deterrence has been reestablished. 
Yet, the threat of Iran and Iraq still 
remains and cannot be ignored. For the 
last 6 months, Iran has moved more 
and more military assets into Iraq. 
That is a fact. 
And though deterrence has changed 
Iran’s calculus, it has not eliminated 
the timeless goals: One, to kick the 
United States out of the region by 
fraud or force; two, turn Iraq into a 
puppet state; and, three, take away the 
freedom of the Iraqi people, just as 
they stole the freedom from their own 
people. 
Let’s not forget that Iran will seize 
every opportunity to undermine our in-
terests in the region. 
The Lee amendment would have us 
repeat the same strategic failures of 
the Obama administration, whose rush 
to withdraw from Iraq on a political 
timeline led to the direct rise of ISIS. 
If passed, it would send a message of 
weakness and division to the regime in 
Iran. 
The RO KHANNA amendment is even 
more foolish and poorly-timed. The 
claim that it just prohibits an unau-
thorized war against Iran is totally 
false. 
The Members on their phones should 
take a moment and actually realize 
what they are going to vote on because 
there are consequences to this judg-
ment. They may make it easier, where 
they do not have to have an amend-
ment where they actually have facts 
before their eyes and be judged upon a 
vote that is so serious as war. 
Plainly, it abuses the power of the 
purse by proactively banning the use of 
force far short of war and makes ex-
emptions only for direct attacks on 
U.S. territory or troops. Its effects are 
more constraining than the War Pow-
ers Resolution, which forces cutoffs in 
just 60 days. 
Consider a few scenarios that would 
be illegal under RO KHANNA’s proposal. 
This is what you are voting for. 
Think, for a moment, if Iran plans 
catastrophic attacks against New York 
and Jerusalem. The intelligence is 
clear and undeniable. Under KHANNA’s 
bill, we couldn’t use the military to 
protect ourselves or our allies. That is 
what you will vote for and have to an-
swer to. 
U.S. citizens are kidnapped, and our 
government knows the location and 
how to save them. Under KHANNA’s bill, 
we could not use our Navy SEALs or 
any other part of our military to res-
cue those Americans. 
A U.S. merchant ship is in inter-
national waters and is being hijacked 
by the IRGC. Under the RO KHANNA 
bill, we couldn’t come to their rescue. 
Any way you look at it, these amend-
ments do not make Americans or our 
allies safer. But this is becoming a re-
curring, bad pattern for House Demo-
crats. 
It is interesting, the more I listen on 
the floor from the other side, Madam 
Speaker, I hear blame America first, 
instead of protect America first. 
First, they had to be shamed by the 
Republicans into passing a resolution 
this week in support of the Iranian pro-
testers. They rejected a Republican-led 
resolution just 2 weeks ago that would 
have given our total support. 
Now, Democrats refuse to stand for 
our troops or our allies against our en-
emies. 
Madam Speaker, the future of our 
policy in the Middle East will play a 
crucial role in determining the secu-
rity of our citizens and the character of 
our Nation. 
Iran is watching what we are doing 
today. Its regime is looking for signs of 
hesitation and disagreement, just like 
the denying of standing with those col-
lege students who would not walk on 
an American flag. But Congress would 
not say a word that week. 
Its citizens—who are protesting in 
the streets for a free and accountable 
government—are looking for signs of 
assurance, poise, and support. They did 
not find that a few weeks ago. And 
today, they are going to hear a whole 
different message, once again. 
But they aren’t the only ones watch-
ing. China and Russia are also closely 
studying our actions for signs. Our 
long-term competition with China, in 
particular, directly involves Middle 
East energy resources which are still 
essential for our allies in the Pacific, 
even though, we, ourselves, are energy- 
independent. 
Everyone is looking for signs about 
the future. Will it be a future we can be 
proud of or a future that we are going 
to be ashamed of? 
Well, the future is never clear, but 
this much is: If we abandon our com-
mitments now, we will be saying that 
we lack confidence in our values and 
resolve in our mission. The world will 
say, and history will record that we 
lost faith in the American cause in the 
moment that it was needed the most. 
This is not the America I know and 
love. This is not the America you know 
and love. America is better than this. 
Americans are stronger than this. 
I see an unbreakable spirit in my fel-
low Americans, and I know that, what-
ever the challenges ahead, together, we 
are up to the task; which is why I am 
ashamed of the actions of many of my 
colleagues today which divide us in-
stead of uniting us. 
If you truly believe in your position, 
debate it. If you truly believe in your 
position, stick with the 100-year tradi-
tion of allowing constituents to have a 
voice. You denied any ability to offer 
one amendment—one amendment. 
You are so sure in your position that, 
yes, when the American is kidnapped, 
they won’t need the Navy SEAL to res-
cue them. You are so sure in your posi-
tion that when we know the facts of 
the attack coming, you are so much 
smarter that you will tell Americans 
who die that we should not have 
stopped it. 
You are so sure in your position that 
you would change a century of history 
just so you wouldn’t have to debate. 
Madam Speaker, that is not what the 
Founders devised this floor to be about; 
that the sheer, raw power of a majority 
would be used in a manner to deny a 
voice because they could not win a 
vote; because they wanted to drive a 
policy that made us weaker. 
Madam Speaker, the idea that we 
would blame America first, instead of 
stand with it, is not one I could sup-
port. 
Madam Speaker, it has been very 
clear from the administration, from 
the intel community, from our men 
and women in service, this is not what 
they expect of us. 
If you are proud enough, and you be-
lieve your policy brings people more 
freedom, why would you change 100 
years of precedent? Why would you 
change, just to be able to think you 
can win in a corrupt manner? 
Madam Speaker, I hope all those ex-
amples I showed never come to fru-
ition, because we could not look at 
Americans in the eye and say we had 
an honest debate; it was played by the 
rules; and everybody had an oppor-
tunity to make sure it was the best 
resolution passed. 
No. History will say there was a Gold 
Medal bill that everybody voted for,

then we gutted it and amended it, so 
we denied people a voice. Because of 
sheer, raw power of being in the major-
ity, we were willing to break a 100-year 
tradition. 
It doesn’t matter what the language 
said or how open it would be. It doesn’t 
matter that we were afraid to be chal-
lenged that our bill is wrong. We think 
we are so right that we will do any-
thing to make America weaker. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair reminds Members to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
b 1130 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Ohio (Ms. KAPTUR). 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of both the repeal of the Au-
thorization for Use of Military Force 
against Iraq in 2002 and the No War 
Against Iran Act, and I thank Con-
gressman RO
KHANNA
and Congress-
woman BARBARA
LEE
for their true 
leadership. 
Sending our servicemembers into war 
is one of Congress’ most solemn con-
stitutional 
responsibilities. 
History 
will show this administration’s reck-
less go-it-alone strategy against Iran 
with no allied support has left America 
less safe. 
Indeed, having dodged the draft him-
self, the President does not appreciate 
the true costs of war. Just look at the 
President’s initial report that no U.S. 
troops were harmed following Iran’s re-
taliatory strike on U.S. bases in Iraq. 
It has since been reported that at least 
50 U.S. servicemembers were wounded 
and suffered traumatic brain injuries, a 
stark contrast from President Trump’s 
tweet on January 8 stating all is well. 
The cavalier approach this President 
has taken in escalatory action against 
Iran is haphazard. Our servicemembers’ 
safety and America’s security have 
been hard won. 
This Congress fully understands the 
cost of liberty. It is why, today, we re-
assert our Article I power and clearly 
demand a clear request if the adminis-
tration wishes to engage in war with 
Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
an additional 15 seconds to the gentle-
woman from Ohio. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, this 
Congress will ensure the wise, stra-
tegic, and prudent use of force to win 
the future by defending the American 
people and not carelessly tripping into 
war with Iran. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to refrain from en-
gaging in personalities toward the 
President. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. PALAZZO), a Marine 
combat veteran of the Gulf war and a 
current member of the Mississippi Na-
tional Guard. 
Mr. PALAZZO. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank my friend, Mr. MCCAUL, 
for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the amendment be-
fore us today is another example of the 
Democrats’ most recent campaign to 
undermine our military, our national 
security, and, as always, President 
Trump. 
Repealing the AUMF of 2002 without 
a replacement is dangerous, and the 
House majority must understand that. 
If the Democrats choose to adopt this 
amendment, it shows our military men 
and women stationed in the Middle 
East that the United States Congress 
does not have their backs. 
By adopting this amendment, it tells 
our enemies that they can continue at-
tacking the United States completely 
unchecked. It projects uncertainty and 
weakness to those who are actively 
working against us. 
The United States must maintain the 
ability to counter terrorist attacks, 
and an active AUMF accomplishes 
that. This amendment, if adopted, will 
only weaken America’s defense strat-
egy in the Middle East. 
The AUMF is important and helped 
lead our military to the defeat of al- 
Qaida in Iraq. It continues helping us 
identify other international terrorist 
organizations that want to harm Amer-
icans and spread terror throughout the 
world. 
No one wants endless wars in the 
Middle East, but we must have the 
tools necessary to react in this highly 
volatile region. We should not prevent 
the President from defending Ameri-
cans from imminent threats. To do this 
is reckless and dangerous. Not only 
will it put our military at risk, but it 
will also endanger American civilians. 
Keep in mind, we need to fight the 
global war on terrorism over there; 
otherwise, it will end up in our back-
yards. I urge my colleagues to vote 
‘‘no’’ on this dangerous resolution. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, let me 
just say I would like to briefly respond 
to the Republican leader’s remarks 
about the Iranian protest movement, 
because I feel very strongly about the 
Iranian protest movement and in sup-
porting them. 
The leader accused the Democrats of 
being shamed into passing the resolu-
tion in support of the protestors in 
Iran. I want to correct the record be-
cause Mr. DEUTCH, who is a Democrat, 
introduced this resolution nearly a 
month 
before 
Mr. 
MCCARTHY; 
the 
House 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
marked the resolution a couple of 
weeks later. 
So there was no shame, except accus-
ing Democrats of any nefarious mo-
tives. That is shameful. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Mrs. CAROLYN
B. 
MALONEY), the chairwoman of the Com-
mittee on Oversight and Reform. 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Madam Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for yielding. 
I rise in strong support of the Lee 
amendment to repeal the Authoriza-
tion for Use of Military Force against 
Iraq. 
In 2002, this Chamber voted to invade 
Iraq on what would later prove to be 
false and misleading intelligence pro-
vided by the Bush administration. We 
removed Saddam Hussein, established a 
democratic government in Iraq, and de-
clared a formal end to the mission in 
2011. 
However, that 18-year-old authoriza-
tion is now being used by the President 
to escalate a conflict with Iran, a con-
flict that the American people strongly 
oppose and one that Congress never au-
thorized. 
The Constitution states plainly that 
Congress shall have the power to de-
clare war and peace. This amendment 
exercises that constitutional author-
ity, reflects the will of the American 
people, and is the first step to finally 
ending our endless wars and bringing 
them to an end. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
the Lee amendment. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the Repub-
lican whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding and 
for his leadership on our ability to 
make sure that any administration, 
Republican or Democrat, has the abil-
ity for the President to carry out their 
duties as Commander in Chief. And 
that is what is at stake here, this 
amendment that we are debating right 
now that would completely repeal the 
2002 AUMF and not have an honest con-
versation, a sincere debate about if 
there should be any changes to it, mod-
ernize, work with the administration. 
Again, any Commander in Chief should 
have the ability to defend America, to 
respond to attacks on Americans both 
here in America or abroad. 
Madam Speaker, as you look at this 
debate as well as the vote we are going 
to be taking shortly on the Iranian lan-
guage, which would limit the ability of 
the President to respond to attacks 
coming from Iran, it is another major 
concern about whether or not we are 
going to have a Commander in Chief 
who can actually defend America. 
There are things that are going on 
right now that we all know are an un-
derlying part of this debate. Let’s start 
with the taking out of one of the blood-
iest terrorists in the history of this 
country, 
Soleimani, 
who 
was 
just 
taken out primarily using the author-
ity of the 2002 AUMF, which would be 
gutted if this were to pass. 
So I don’t think most people in this 
country think it is a debatable ques-
tion of a bloody terrorist who killed 
hundreds of American troops. This guy 
had the blood of over 600 U.S. service-
men and -women on his hands. He was 
in Iraq plotting to take out more 
Americans, to kill more Americans, 
and he was taken out. 
Is it really a question of whether or 
not that was the right thing to do? I 
think most Americans would agree he 
was a brutal terrorist. And whether it 
was Osama bin Laden or al-Baghdadi or

other terrorists who want to kill Amer-
icans, our Commander in Chief ought 
to have the ability to protect Ameri-
cans and stop terrorists who want to 
kill more Americans. To take away 
that ability is reckless. It is destruc-
tive to the country. 
Again, if you wanted to have an hon-
est debate, Madam Speaker, you would 
have seen the committees of jurisdic-
tion have true hearings on this, bring 
in people in the administration, talk 
about what the right way to approach 
this is. 
That is not what happened. They lit-
erally took a coin bill—a coin bill—and 
brought it forward with these two 
amendments so that there can’t be 
that honest debate on both sides, shut-
ting out the minority’s ability to bring 
amendments, to have an honest discus-
sion about what the process should be. 
In terms of Iran, just think about 
what they are doing there. It is not 
only Iran. It is Iranian proxies that 
carry out attacks against servicemem-
bers of the United States and our al-
lies, and they take that away, too. 
Don’t tie the hands of any President 
of the United States, Republican or 
Democrat, from being able to defend 
this country both here and abroad. I 
oppose both amendments and would 
hope we reject it. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, let me 
quickly say that I agree with Mr. SCA-
LISE
that the Foreign Affairs Com-
mittee should be having hearings on 
this. We have tried to get the Sec-
retary of State to come. I am still 
hopeful he is coming, but it is a little 
hard to hold hearings if you don’t get 
the administration witness to come to 
the hearings. We are trying. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I rise today in support of my good 
friend and colleague’s commonsense 
measure, and I want to thank Rep-
resentative LEE for her leadership and 
her moral courage. 
I also would just say we have heard a 
lot with respect to objections around 
the process. Long before I got here, 
Representative LEE, as I understand it, 
secured a similar amendment in an ap-
propriations bill just a few years ago. 
In the dead of night, the prior Speaker 
of the House struck that amendment 
out of the bill, and I didn’t hear many 
process objections at that time from so 
many of my colleagues on the other 
side of the aisle. If folks want to have 
an honest debate, let’s have that hon-
est debate. 
For my part, I support this measure 
and what it represents. I believe it is 
ultimately about the need to under-
score to this administration the con-
stitutional limitations placed on its 
authority, a reminder that is necessary 
because of this President’s reckless for-
eign policy and his refusal to engage 
Congress in the authorities placed with 
us by the Founders. 
This Chamber is often referred to as 
the ‘‘people’s House,’’ elected by the 
people, charged to represent the people 
and to govern for the people. The 
Founders, the Framers, in their infi-
nite wisdom, decided to rest the solemn 
power to declare war with the Congress 
as the people’s House, and yet, for the 
better part of the last 18 years, this 
Chamber has abdicated its traditional 
role. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Colorado an addi-
tional 15 seconds. 
Mr. NEGUSE. Administration after 
administration has used this authority 
to engage our Armed Forces in various 
conflicts around the world. 
It is time for Congress to return to 
its traditional role under our constitu-
tional structure. I support this meas-
ure. I encourage my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon 
(Mr. BLUMENAUER). 
Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the gentleman for yielding. 
My service in the House has been 
marked by a loss of Congress’ power to 
deal with war and peace. I am proud to 
stand with my friend, Congresswoman 
LEE, as I did with her in her 2002 
amendment. Republicans empowered 
President Bush for the worst foreign 
policy blunder in our history, and we 
are still paying the price for the war in 
Iraq. 
It is time to end this bipartisan fail-
ure, time to end it, stand up for Con-
gress. This is especially critical today 
with the reckless current occupant who 
cozies up to dictators like Putin and 
some of the worst people on the planet, 
and who attacks our allies with trade 
wars. He committed colossal blunders 
like 
breaking 
the 
Iranian 
nuclear 
agreement, which the Iranians had 
abided by, and by killing the second 
most powerful person in Iran, which 
made us less safe. 
It is time to vote for the Lee amend-
ment, repeal the AUMF, a key tool to 
rein in a reckless President and re-
claim the rightful powers of Congress 
over war and peace. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. KILDEE). 
Mr. KILDEE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
I stand in strong support of Rep-
resentative LEE’s resolution to repeal 
the 2002 Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force against Iraq. 
The Constitution is unambiguous; it 
is clear: Congress has the power to au-
thorize war. 
In 2002, Congress passed an Author-
ization for Use of Military Force to ad-
dress the ongoing threat from Saddam 
Hussein’s regime in Iraq to this coun-
try. 
With the overthrow of Saddam Hus-
sein by U.S. military forces and the es-
tablishment of a new Iraqi Govern-
ment, this AUMF became obsolete; but 
we continued, Democratic Presidents 
and Republican Presidents, to use the 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force ongoing, as if the same condi-
tions existed then. 
If there is a need for the authoriza-
tion for the use of military force 
against any threat, we should bring it 
up and have a full and fair and open de-
bate on what that threat is constituted 
of and, as a Congress, exercise that 
constitutional authority to declare 
war. 
This language does not prevent a 
President 
from 
defending 
America. 
Don’t let anyone tell you that. 
It is important that we exercise our 
constitutional role.

Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time remains on 
each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 81⁄2 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Texas 
has 81⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Washington (Ms. JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support Representative LEE’s 
amendment to say no to unauthorized 
wars. 
The Trump administration claims 
that this outdated authorization justi-
fies future strikes against Iran. That is 
outrageous. And as a result of the as-
sassination of General Soleimani and 
Iran’s retaliation, we now have 50 
American soldiers tragically injured. 
Representative LEE, during debate in 
2002 on this very authorization, said: 
‘‘It does not take leadership to go drop 
bombs and go to war. It takes real 
leadership to negotiate and to develop 
peaceful resolutions to our security 
needs.’’ 
Seventeen years ago, Madam Speak-
er, I spoke at a rally of 50,000 people in 
Seattle who believed the evidence was 
not there to go to war in Iraq. Today, 
we know we were right. We must learn 
from that. 
Let’s repeal this outdated authoriza-
tion and ensure that Congress has real 
oversight and debate before we go into 
any war. Let’s show leadership and 
stop these endless, unauthorized wars. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Wis-
consin (Mr. POCAN). 
Mr. POCAN. Madam Speaker, today, 
I rise in strong support of Representa-
tive BARBARA LEE’s amendment to re-
peal the 2002 Authorization for Use of 
Military Force in Iraq. 
We cannot allow this President or 
any President to use an outdated 
AUMF intended to address Saddam 
Hussein to wage unauthorized wars 
against whatever leader they are upset 
with on any given day. 
Because of congressional inaction, 
the U.S. military is operating in at

least 76 countries across the world, and 
we have spent trillions of dollars on 
military activities since 9/11, largely on 
unauthorized wars abroad, when we 
could be helping people at home, ex-
panding 
Social 
Security, 
ensuring 
healthcare is a human right, and in-
vesting in green jobs and renewable en-
ergy. 
Recently, the President threatened 
this bill with a veto. It only made the 
case more clear: Congress must re-
assert its constitutional authority per 
Article I, Section 8, to declare war. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support both Representative 
RO KHANNA’s bill to prohibit funding 
for war with Iran and Representative 
LEE’s efforts to repeal the 2002 AUMF. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. BROWN). 
Mr. BROWN of Maryland. Madam 
Speaker, I was deployed to Iraq in 2004 
and served with the most patriotic 
Americans and committed Iraqi part-
ners in Baghdad, Fallujah, Kirkuk, and 
Mosul. 
While the justification for that war 
was fundamentally flawed, our author-
ized mission was to defend the national 
security of the United States from the 
continuing threat posed by the Govern-
ment of Iraq. 
Yes, we continue to counter ISIS in 
Iraq, but the Government of Iraq no 
longer poses a threat to our national 
security, and that is why I advocate for 
the repeal of the 2002 AUMF. 
We have a responsibility to the men 
and women who wear the uniform to 
ensure that the authorized missions 
they execute are targeted, defined, and 
achievable. We cannot accomplish that 
goal with a nearly two-decade-old au-
thorization that doesn’t recognize the 
current landscape. 
With this amendment, we officially 
end America’s 2002 mission in Iraq. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Michigan (Ms. TLAIB). 
Ms. TLAIB. Madam Speaker, this ad-
ministration’s rogue attempt to start a 
war with Iran endangers countless lives 
around the world and was a wake-up 
call for Congress that we must reclaim 
our constitutional role as a check on 
executive power to wage endless wars. 
Repealing the AUMF of 2002 is an im-
portant step toward reasserting that 
Congress alone has the authority to de-
clare war. The 2002 AUMF was passed 
to wage a war ultimately deemed to be 
based on lies, and the United States 
military operations pursuant to the 
2002 AUMF ended in 2011. 
Iraq is a sovereign nation, and pass-
ing today’s amendment is an important 
measure of respect for our key ally. 
The 2002 AUMF is an outdated relic 
whose only function is to provide this 
administration with cover to claim 
that Congress has authorized attacks 
on Iran or whichever country draws its 
attention. Leaving it in place makes us 
less safe in our country. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Representa-
tive LEE, my mentor, for her leadership 
on repealing the 2002 AUMF and ending 
our forever wars so that we can better 
serve our constituents at home. 
Madam Speaker, I know Ms. LEE was 
alone at one point. She is not alone 
anymore. We stand with her in pushing 
back against this very much unconsti-
tutional measure by the President of 
the United States. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Flor-
ida (Mr. GAETZ), our Republican col-
league. 
Mr. GAETZ. Madam Speaker, I come 
to vote my heart. 
Saddam died more than a decade ago, 
and even the faintest echoes of his re-
gime have long dissolved. 
So if we are unable to declare victory 
and bring our troops home at this time 
after Saddam is dead, after his regime 
has evaporated, after ISIS has col-
lapsed, then no war is ever truly win-
nable and every authorization is an au-
thorization for a forever war. 
Let’s not hand the 21st century off to 
China as we toil in the Middle East. In-
stead of sending America’s bravest pa-
triots to the bloodstained sands of the 
Middle East, let’s care for our veterans 
here at home. 
Instead of wasting American treasure 
bombing and rebuilding Iraq, let’s re-
build our own great Nation. Let’s se-
cure the U.S. border with Mexico be-
fore we send the next soldier, sailor, 
dollar, or marine to secure Iraq’s bor-
der with Iran. 
Instead of ill-fated adventurism, let’s 
put America first. 
Keeping U.S. Forces in Iraq is not 
what President Trump wants. It is not 
what the American people want. It is 
not what the Iraq parliament wants. 
The best time to vote against the 
Iraq war would have been in 2002. The 
second best time is today. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
my first opportunity in speaking today 
is to make sure that we honor all the 
men and women who are wearing uni-
forms in the United States military, as 
Congresswoman LEE has said, her fam-
ily members and many family members 
who served. 
What we do know is we found no 
weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. 
We supported Congresswoman LEE in 
the rational position to have the in-
spection go forth, to know what was 
going on. The only thing we secured 
was an endless war. 
In the question of Iran, Mr. RO 
KHANNA’s position is right. If there is 
any need to defend us in Iran, the War 
Powers Resolution allows a President 
to do that if we are defending ourselves 
against attacks or if there are hos-
tilities. 
We need to address this in a constitu-
tional way. Article I says that Con-
gress declares war. 
The endless war that has carried on, 
for those of us who have been to Iraq 
and then Afghanistan realize that our 
soldiers deserve the dignity of a debate 
when they should go to war. 
Let me say to those who were injured 
by Iran: It is not just a side hit, if you 
will. These soldiers have been hit. We 
honor them. 
We should have a Congress to stand 
up if we go to war, not use this resolu-
tion. It should be repealed. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
This is not a resolution to go to war. 
My friend, the minority leader, wrote 
me a letter and implied that it was. 
These two bills are about the Con-
stitution and about the awesome re-
sponsibility placed upon the Congress 
of the United States to determine 
whether or not we do go to war. It is 
not in Article II. It is in Section 8 of 
Article I of the Constitution of the 
United States. 
With Democrats as President of the 
United 
States 
and 
Republicans 
as 
President of the United States, this 
Congress has too often ceded its con-
stitutional responsibility to the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
The Founders would find that very 
dangerous. They wanted a cumulative 
voice of the American people to make 
this extraordinary decision to go to 
war. 
It has been said that the Congress-
woman from California, BARBARA LEE, 
stood as a lone and courageous voice in 
voting ‘‘no’’ when America was at-
tacked, not because she did not want to 
defend America, but because she want-
ed to ensure that we did so in a 
thoughtful way and in a correct way. 
It has been said before that nothing 
in this resolution prevents America or 
members of our Armed Forces from de-
fending themselves. 
This vote is about the Constitution 
of the United States. Both votes are 
about the Constitution of the United 
States. 
Americans have experienced a gen-
eration of war abroad to prevent terror 
at home. 
Madam Speaker, I was preceded by 
just a little bit by Mr. GAETZ from 
Florida. He and I don’t agree on much. 
We have different perspectives on pol-
icy. But he and I agree on these two 
bills. 
In Afghanistan and Iraq, our troops 
have fought courageously. Their fami-
lies have sacrificed. Their friends and 
neighbors have waited anxiously for 
news of their safe return home. Many, 
tragically, did not return. We hold

January 30, 2020 
them in our hearts today as we engage 
in this critical debate about the nature 
of Congress’ role in making consequen-
tial decisions of war and peace. 
The Founders wanted those of us, 
particularly in this House, to every 2 
years have to go back to our constitu-
ents to renew our contract to represent 
them. The Founders did that because 
they wanted us to be in close touch 
with the American people, and they 
wanted the people’s views reflected be-
fore any one person took us to war. 
Now, the House has already voted on 
both of these propositions, on Ms. 
LEE’s bill and on Mr. KHANNA’s bill. 
Now, they have presented us with two 
amendments. 
Last year, during the debate on the 
National Defense Authorization Act, 
they were included and passed by this 
House. 
b 1200 
These are not new propositions. They 
were approved with bipartisan support. 
I don’t mean one Republican or two Re-
publicans, or three Republicans—as my 
Republican colleagues talk about, well, 
the impeachment opposition was bipar-
tisan with one or two; one of whom, of 
course, is now a Republican. 
But the vote was 27 in one vote and 14 
in the other. Fourteen Republicans 
voted for Congresswoman LEE’s propo-
sition, and they did so largely on the 
basis of what Mr. GAETZ from Florida 
had to say. 
In Representative KHANNA’s amend-
ment, the tally was 251–170. Fourteen 
Republicans 
voted 
for 
Ms. 
LEE’s 
amendment and 27 for Mr. KHANNA’s 
amendment. 
Now, Mr. KHANNA’s resolution is di-
rectly related to the Constitution and 
Ms. LEE’s is directly related to what 
Mr. GAETZ said. Whether you agreed or 
not with what is happening in Iraq, it 
is over. The bipartisan votes are a tes-
tament to the very strong public senti-
ment that sending America’s young 
men and women to war must not be the 
decision of the Commander in Chief. 
And from my perspective, frankly, cer-
tainly not this Commander in Chief 
who is so impulsive and so inclined to 
avoid and deny the advice of his Sec-
retary of Defense and other intel-
ligence-related personnel. 
That is why, as I said earlier, our 
Founders enshrined in the Constitution 
that only Congress can declare war. 
That is why we have the War Powers 
Act that we adopted in 1973. That is 
why we are having this debate on the 
floor today. 
I strongly support both the Lee 
amendment and the Khanna amend-
ment. The former would repeal the 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force in Iraq which was meant to en-
able, as Mr. GAETZ so powerfully said, 
the removal of Saddam Hussein. He is 
gone. We are not at war with Iraq. 
Sadly, that resolution is being used 
some 18 years later as rationale for 
doing something not against Iraq, not 
against Saddam Hussein—who we all 
know is dead—but for something else. 
The something else needs to be ap-
proved by this Congress unless it is a 
defensive action, again, which is pro-
vided for. 
The latter would prohibit the Trump 
administration 
from 
using 
Federal 
funds without congressional authoriza-
tion to strike Iran in the absence of an 
imminent threat. ‘‘In the absence of an 
imminent threat’’ is the key language. 
This is not about retreat. This is not 
about exposing us to danger. It is car-
rying out the strictures of the Con-
stitution of the United States. Let me 
make this point clear: Nowhere in this 
bill do we take funding away from the 
military or say that our forces cannot 
defend themselves. We include clear 
language to ensure that if an imminent 
threat presents itself, our forces can 
strike and respond to that threat. 
I am proud that so many Democratic 
Members of the House are veterans who 
know what it means to serve at the 
point of the spear. Mr. BROWN, my col-
league from Maryland, just spoke. He 
was one of those. Many of our freshmen 
served in the military during the Iraq 
and Afghanistan conflicts and are 
working hard to make sure that our 
Democratic House majority always 
keeps faith with those in uniform and 
our veterans. 
They have been instrumental in help-
ing to shape our policies in a way that 
is smart, strategic and strengthens our 
national security. 
Let me also say that Iran remains a 
dangerous enemy. I doubt that there is 
a person on this floor who disagrees 
with that. No one is suggesting taking 
our eye off Iran and its malevolent be-
havior, and no one is mourning the loss 
of Soleimani. That is not the issue. 
The issue is, as I said at the begin-
ning, the Constitution. That is why 
Congress needs to take action now to 
make it clear that the President does 
not have the unilateral authority to 
take America into another costly war 
in the Middle East or anywhere else. 
We passed the War Powers Resolu-
tion on a bipartisan basis earlier this 
month. This is not a partisan issue. 
This is an issue of standing up for the 
Article I branch of government, the 
Congress of the United States, who rep-
resent the people. We call this the peo-
ple’s House, and the Founders wanted 
the people to make this decision. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative LEE and Representative 
KHANNA, as well as all of those who 
have been involved in this effort, for 
bringing these two propositions to the 
floor of the House. 
I urge each and every one of my col-
leagues to vote for these bills. I also 
hope that those who voted with the 
Khanna amendment, 27 Republicans, 
stick with their principles; stick with 
their commitment to the Constitution; 
stick with the separation of powers; 
stick with the awesome responsibility 
of this House, representing the people, 
to be the ones that make that terribly 
hard decision to send our people to 
war. 
I hope that the 14 who voted for the 
Lee amendment stick with their prin-
ciples to rationally say: Iraq is over. It 
is gone. The resolution of authoriza-
tion is 18 years old. It is time for us to 
look anew, think anew, and act anew 
as the circumstances require. 
I thank Ms. LEE and Mr. KHANNA. Let 
us pass these two amendments. That is 
what our Founders would want us to 
do. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. REED). 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in response to my good friend 
from Maryland who just spoke. As one 
of those 27 who voted with the Demo-
crats on that previous resolution, I 
stand in opposition today because this 
is a sham. 
You are using a commemorative coin 
bill on the floor of the House so we can-
not debate the merits of this constitu-
tional question. That is a shame. And 
just on that basis alone, I vote ‘‘no.’’ 
You are damn right we should, as 
Members of Congress, exercise our con-
stitutional authority, and we need to 
come back to this question and debate 
honestly and openly. When we put our 
men and women in harm’s way, we 
should set aside our Democrat and Re-
publican colors and say: Let’s stand as 
Americans. 
So if you want to use this sham proc-
ess to shame me, I will accept that be-
cause I will do the right thing each and 
every day. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on these amendments. 
Vote ‘‘no’’ on this sham, and let’s have 
a real debate as Members of Congress 
do in our constitutional responsibility. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
JACKSON
LEE). 
The 
Chair 
reminds 
Members to address their remarks to 
the Chair and to maintain the appro-
priate decorum on the floor. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from Mary-
land (Mr. HOYER), the majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, there 
is no sham here. We have debated this 
proposition. This is the second time we 
have debated it, and it has passed 
twice. There is no sham here. 
I will talk about the MTR sham that 
you are arguing about at a later time. 
But this is on the merits of whether or 
not you believe the Congress of the 
United States ought to be making 
these decisions. Don’t hide behind some 
sham argument about MTRs. We will 
get to that. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair reminds all Members to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I think back to my 
dad’s war. Churchill warned Neville 
Chamberlain about the dark clouds of 
the Nazi regime on the horizon. He 
talked about how weakness invites ag-
gression, and then we saw Hitler take 
the world stage. 
Reagan talked about peace through 
strength. These are the ideals I believe

January 30, 2020 
in, and these bills do not project that. 
They project weakness; weakness with 
ISIS; weakness with Iran; and weak-
ness with our enemies. 
I would like to close by stating the 
obvious, and I think we all can agree 
here to some extent, that the 2002 
AUMF is outdated. It is almost 20 
years old. I believe it is time to replace 
it with a new authority that is tailored 
to the specific threats that we face 
today. 
But 
one 
thing 
that 
has 
been 
mischaracterized is that this only ap-
plied to Saddam Hussein, when, in fact, 
the AUMF says: ‘‘Iraq poses a con-
tinuing threat to the national security 
of the United States.’’ And Iraq does, 
among other things, ‘‘harbor other 
international terrorist organizations, 
including organizations that threaten 
the lives and safety of American citi-
zens.’’ 
That, my friend, is ISIS. It is not just 
Saddam Hussein. It is ISIS. And we 
have seen ISIS too much. We owe an 
updated AUMF to our soldiers, I think, 
who are in Iraq risking their lives for 
our security. We owe a debt to our 
partners and to the American people. 
But the problem, Madam Speaker, and 
the reason I oppose this amendment, is 
because passing it, does not make any 
progress toward that goal. 
A standalone repeal does not recog-
nize the reality on the ground that our 
counterterrorism mission in Iraq is on-
going as we debate here on the floor 
right now, today. 
The 
inspector 
general 
for 
the 
counter-ISIS mission just reported last 
quarter that: ‘‘In Iraq . . . ISIS contin-
ued this quarter to solidify and expand 
its command and control structures.’’ 
On the other hand, they said: ‘‘. . . it 
had not increased its capabilities in 
areas where the coalition was actively 
conducting operations against ISIS.’’ 
Madam Speaker, repealing the AUMF 
without a replacement shows our sol-
diers, our partners, our adversaries, 
that we are undermining our important 
mission there to protect the homeland; 
that we are not committed to com-
pleting the mission; and that we are 
not committed to a free and demo-
cratic Iraq. 
The last time the United States 
abandoned 
Iraq 
under 
President 
Obama, ISIS reared its ugly head and 
formed the caliphate. 
Just a few short years later, they de-
clared it a caliphate and killed and 
savaged thousands of people. We all 
saw the videos. It surged all across the 
world. At that time, I was chairman of 
the Homeland Security Committee, 
and in 2016, the threat briefings were 
absolutely terrifying; one external op-
eration after another to kill Americans 
in the United States out of Iraq and 
Syria. 
None of us want to see the next ISIS 
rise. None of us in this Chamber should 
allow that to ever happen again. So 
let’s have a serious conversation about 
what an Authorization for Use of Mili-
tary Force to defeat today’s threats 
would look like instead of playing par-
tisan politics. 
b 1215 
What else are the Democrats’ par-
tisan maneuvers costing us today? 
They are exploiting the Greatest Gen-
eration, our World War II merchant 
mariners whose brothers died at the 
hands of the Nazis on the high seas. 
World War II veterans are dying 
every day, yet this majority is hijack-
ing a bipartisan bill to honor their 
bravery in World War II as the vehicle 
for these two political measures. 
Rather than sending the President a 
Senate-passed version of this bill to 
grant this long-overdue recognition, 
they are setting that effort back to 
square one where it will require pas-
sage again by the Senate that is tied 
up with impeachment. 
Let me just say this: As the son of a 
World War II veteran, I am saddened 
and ashamed that the majority would 
allow playing procedural games that 
set back this bipartisan bill that was 
on its way to the President’s desk. 
They are forcing these elderly mer-
chant mariners, World War II veterans, 
to wait even longer for the thanks of a 
grateful nation. 
In closing, we owe it to our constitu-
ents to take action to replace this 2002 
Authorization 
for 
Use 
of 
Military 
Force, but this, Madam Speaker, does 
nothing to meet that goal. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose this empty and reck-
less gesture and vote ‘‘no’’ on the 
amendment, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, in 2002, the House 
authorized the Bush administration to 
go to war the Saddam Hussein’s regime 
in Iraq. It makes no sense that this au-
thorization is still on the books when 
the original purpose of it has long 
passed. 
It is dangerous when we see an ad-
ministration trying to claim that this 
decades-old vote gives them a green 
light 
to 
conduct 
military 
actions 
against Iran. 
With this measure today, there is no 
blank check for war. The President 
must come to the Congress. 
We want to fill our constitutional 
role. Only Congress can declare war, 
not the President. With this measure 
today, we can finally reclaim Congress’ 
constitutional role in war powers and 
repeal this outdated authorization that 
has been misused time and time and 
time again. 
As my friend from Texas knows, the 
2001 9/11 AUMF is cited as the author-
ity for every operation against terror-
ists in Iraq. This AUMF needs to be up-
dated and limited. The 2002 Iraq war 
AUMF does not need to be updated; it 
just needs to be repealed. 
What we are saying here is that there 
should be no automatic blank check for 
war. If this President or future Presi-
dents want to go to war, they must 
come to Congress. Only Congress can 
declare war. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle to 
support this, no blank check for war. If 
war is necessary, it will happen, but it 
shouldn’t be a blank check for Presi-
dents to go to war. We want peace; we 
don’t want war; and now is the time to 
show it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCHIFF. Madam Speaker, I rise in sup-
port of House Amendments to the Senate 
Amendment to H.R. 550, to repeal the 2002 
Authorization for Use of Military Force Against 
Iraq, and to prohibit the use of force in or 
against Iran without Congressional authoriza-
tion. I urge my colleagues to join me in sup-
porting these two bills which would begin to 
reclaim Congress’s Constitutional authority 
over the use of force. 
First, the repeal of the 2002 AUMF is long 
overdue. Passed in the lead up to the Iraq 
War, the objectives embodied in the authoriza-
tion are obsolete. Leaving it in effect only in-
vites abuse by this or any other administration, 
undermining Congress’s Article I authority. 
This 18-year-old authorization should not re-
main as a blank check for the United States 
to engage in military action in Iraq in per-
petuity. By passing this repeal, Congress will 
reclaim the important decision-making author-
ity the Founders specifically afforded to the 
legislature, and not the executive branch. 
I also strongly support the No War Against 
Iran Act. The Administration’s reckless policies 
towards Iran have repeatedly brought us near 
the brink of a war with Iran, one which would 
be contrary to our interests, which the Amer-
ican people do not want, and which the Con-
gress has never authorized. This bill would 
make clear that the President does not have 
the unilateral authority to drag us into war, 
while leaving in place authorities needed to 
counter Iran’s malicious influence in the re-
gion. 
Finally, while not the subject of the vote 
today, I hope that the renewed Congressional 
interest in reclaiming our war powers authori-
ties will be followed by an effort to sunset the 
2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force 
against those who planned and conducted the 
9/11 attacks. This authorization has been 
stretched beyond recognition to authorize 
force against terrorist groups around the 
world, many of which didn’t exist in 2001. 
Should the Executive Branch need additional 
authorities beyond those granted in Article II, 
they should come to Congress and make the 
case for what those authorities should be so 
that we can determine if a replacement au-
thorization is needed. But the Congressional 
inertia that has kept the 2001 AUMF in place 
has gone on too long, and I hope that we will 
see renewed bipartisan energy to replace it. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Homeland Security 
Committee and a cosponsor, I rise in strong 
support of RCP 116–49, the House Amend-
ment to the Senate Amendment to H.R. 550, 
the No War With Iran Act, introduced by the 
gentlewoman from California, Congresswoman 
BARBARA LEE. 
I thank my Out of Iraq colleague, Congress-
woman BARBARA LEE, for sponsoring this leg-
islation which repeals P.L. 107–43, the broad,

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H737 
January 30, 2020 
unrestrained, and outdated 2002 Authorization 
for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) against 
Iraq, which was passed and signed into law 
on October 16, 2002, nearly twenty years ago. 
Congress never intended for the 2002 
AUMF to have such broad and extended 
reach. 
Over the last 18 years, we have seen 3 
Presidents use this legislation as a blank 
check to engage in serious military action. 
The 2002 AUMF is an outdated piece of 
legislation and repealing it will not affect any 
current military operations. 
The 2002 AUMF’s only function is to provide 
the President with cover to claim Congress 
has already authorized him to attack Iranian 
officials, which is false. 
Moreover, the 2002 AUMF is unnecessary 
because in the administration’s own view, ev-
erything the 2002 AUMF covers is already 
fully covered under the 2001 9/11 AUMF, ex-
cept for attacks against Iran. 
Congress passed the 2002 AUMF to ad-
dress the perceived threat posed by the re-
gime of Saddam Hussein and the AUMF per-
mitted the President to use the Armed Forces 
as ‘‘necessary and appropriate’’ to ‘‘defend 
U.S. national security against the continuing 
threat posed by Iraq’’ and to ‘‘enforce all rel-
evant Security Council resolutions regarding 
Iraq.’’ 
U.S. military deployments and operations 
carried out pursuant to the 2002 AUMF— 
dubbed Operation Iraqi Freedom—officially 
concluded in 2011. 
Almost 18 years after the resolution’s pas-
sage, the United States recognizes the sov-
ereignty of Iraq and considers Iraq a key ally. 
Under the Constitution, Congress has the 
sole duty to declare war. Repealing obsolete 
Authorizations for Use of Military Force 
(AUMFs) is essential to Congress living up to 
its constitutional responsibilities. 
Leaving the 2002 AUMF in place increases 
the likelihood that future Presidents will use it 
as a basis to start a new war, or expand a 
current one, without Congress’s explicit au-
thorization. 
In July 2019, the House adopted a Lee 
amendment to NDAA virtually identical to H.R. 
2456, To Repeal the AUMF Against Iraq Res-
olution of 2002, by a bipartisan vote of 242 to 
180. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership 
stripped it out. 
The overly broad 2002 AUMF represents a 
critical deterioration of congressional over-
sight. 
As our brave servicemembers are deployed 
around the world in combat zones, Congress 
is missing in action. 
Congress must repeal the 2002 AUMF im-
mediately to fulfill its constitutional obligation 
to provide oversight and consent on matters of 
war and peace. 
As provided under the War Powers Resolu-
tion of 1973, absent a congressional declara-
tion of war or authorization for the use of mili-
tary force, the President as Commander-in- 
Chief has constitutional power to engage the 
U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities only in the 
case of a national emergency created by an 
attack upon the United States, its territories or 
possessions, or its Armed Forces. 
Madam Speaker, since the objectives which 
led Congress to pass the 2002 Authorization 
to Use Military Force (AUMF) have been 
achieved, I believe the authorization to use 
that military force expired automatically. 
Madam Speaker, where a congressional au-
thorization to use military force has expired, 
the President must obtain a new authorization 
to continue the use of force. 
Given 
the 
material 
changes 
in 
cir-
cumstances, introducing additional U.S. com-
bat troops into the region would be both un-
wise and beyond the scope of authority con-
ferred by the 2002 AUMF. 
As a co-equal branch of government, it is 
Congress’s right and responsibility to be fully 
consulted regarding any potential plans to ex-
pand military operations in the region, to as-
sess whether such action is in the national se-
curity interest of the United States and our al-
lies, and to withhold or grant authorization for 
the use of military force based on this assess-
ment. 
As we have learned from the painful and bit-
ter experience of the past 18 years, at the ini-
tiation of hostilities, the costs in terms of blood 
and treasure of U.S. military interventions 
abroad are often underestimated and the ben-
efits overstated. 
More than 6,800 American servicemembers 
gave the last full measure of devotion to their 
country on battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq, 
with hundreds of thousands more returning 
with physical, emotional, or psychological 
wounds that may never heal. 
The direct economic cost of the war in the 
Persian Gulf exceeds $1.07 trillion, including 
$773 billion in Overseas Contingency Oper-
ations funds, an increase of $243 billion to the 
Department of Defense base budget, and an 
increase of $54.2 billion to the Veterans Ad-
ministration budget to address the human 
costs of the military involvement in Iraq. 
We should not repeat the mistakes of the 
past and my position on this issue is directly 
aligned with the will of the American people. 
I commend my colleague, Representative 
BARBARA LEE, for her introduction and advo-
cacy of this legislation that will repeal the out-
dated 2002 AUMF. 
Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I am a proud cosponsor of 
both of these bills on the floor today—H.R. 
2456 to repeal the 2002 AUMF and H.R. 
5543, No War Against Iran to prevent any 
funds from being used for military force 
against Iran. Having previously voted in sup-
port of these bills as amendments to the Fis-
cal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization 
Act, I believe bringing these bills to the floor 
today is important in order to reassert Con-
gress’ 
constitutional 
authority. 
The 
2002 
AUMF is an outdated piece of legislation. U.S. 
military deployments and operations carried 
out pursuant to the 2002 AUMF—dubbed Op-
eration Iraqi Freedom—officially concluded in 
2011. Almost 18 years after the resolution’s 
passage, the United States recognizes the 
sovereignty of Iraq and considers Iraq a key 
ally. Under the constitution, Congress has the 
sole authority to declare war. Repealing obso-
lete AUMFs is essential to Congress living up 
to its constitutional responsibilities. Leaving 
the 2002 AUMF in place increases the likeli-
hood that future Presidents will use it as a 
basis to start a new war, or expand a current 
one, without Congress’s explicit authorization. 
Following our January 9 vote on, H. Con. Res. 
83, a War Powers Resolution to make clear 
the President could not constitutionally esca-
late the conflict with Iran without congressional 
approval, the Trump Administration has only 
continued to thumb its nose at the Constitution 
and has ignored Congress’ authority as a co-
equal branch of government. I, again, urge the 
Trump Administration to refocus its efforts on 
creating a coherent and constructive strategy 
towards the Middle East. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time 
for debate has expired. 
Pursuant to House Resolution 811, 
the previous question is ordered on this

COMMEMORATING 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE LIBERATION OF 
AUSCHWITZ 
(Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, 
this week we commemorate the 75th 
anniversary of the liberation of Ausch-
witz and honor Holocaust survivors and 
those who lost their lives during this 
terrible period of history. Horrible 
atrocities were visited upon millions of 
innocent souls, driven by fear, hatred 
and oppression. 
Seventy-five years later, as anti- 
Semitism, racism, and other forms of 
bigotry continue to plague our society, 
we are reminded that we cannot be si-
lent in the face of intolerance or dis-
crimination. 
Earlier this week, I was proud to sup-
port the Never Again Education Act, 
which will help educate the next gen-
eration about the genocide that oc-
curred during the Holocaust and the 
dangers of allowing hatred to go un-
challenged. 
As we reflect on this moment in his-
tory, let us set an example by con-
demning senseless acts of aggression 
and intolerance and, instead, encour-
aging equality and inclusion and hon-
oring our enduring pledge: ‘‘Never 
Again.’’

CONGRESSIONAL 
APP 
CHAL-
LENGE WINNER 
(Mr. PERRY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. PERRY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today 
to 
recognize 
Shubhankar 
Baliyan as the winner of the 2019 Con-
gressional App Challenge for the 10th 
District of Pennsylvania. 
Shubhankar is a student at Cum-
berland Valley High School in Mechan-
icsburg, Pennsylvania, and submitted 
the winning app called ExciteMath. It 
is an application designed to help ele-
mentary-aged students practice basic, 
mental math skills in a fun and engag-
ing way. 
In each level of the app, students are 
given a target range or sum, that their 
final number must fall within and a 
specific number of hits they must use 
during that round. The student must 
then maneuver around falling numbers 
and select which to add or subtract 
from their sum for that round. 
A 
panel 
of 
experts 
selected 
ExciteMath as the winner for its cre-
ativity, 
coding 
proficiency, 
and 
functionality. 
Through 
this 
app, 
Shubhankar also demonstrated a desire 
to give back to our community by 
helping children struggling with math-
ematics. 
I congratulate Shubhankar on a job 
well done and look forward to seeing 
his app displayed right here in the Cap-
itol.

further, when the House adjourns on

Tuesday, February 4, 2020 for morning- 
hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative

tleman from New Jersey? 
There was no objection.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
KEITH LAMONT STITH 
(Mr. PAYNE asked and was given

Mr. PAYNE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to congratulate Keith Lamont 
Stith for becoming the first African 
American Chief of Detectives of the 
Criminal Investigation Division of the 
Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office.

law enforcement to the position. For 
the last 3 years, he was the deputy 
chief for the prosecutor’s office; and in 
that role, he managed the daily inves-
tigation operations of the Criminal In-
vestigation Division. 
In the past, he has worked as a nar-
cotics detective and for the U.S. Cus-
toms Service in their Financial Crimes 
Task Force. 
He has done groundbreaking work to 
reduce gang and gun violence, as well 
as rehabilitate convicted criminals in 
Hudson County. 
Also, he is a graduate of the pres-
tigious FBI National Academy. 
With these extraordinary credentials, 
I think Mr. Stith will be an exceptional 
chief of detectives in Hudson County. 
f 
POSTHUMOUS RECOGNITION OF 
THE SERVICE OF CARLTON HAND 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Madam Speaker, I 
would like to posthumously recognize 
the heroic efforts of Carlton Hand, of 
Rio Grande in south Jersey. 
Carlton Hand was a Technical Ser-
geant, 
Infantry, 
Cannon 
Company, 
349th Infantry. Hand was recognized for 
his gallantry in combat. He stormed an 
entrenched German position in the face 
of heavy enemy sniper fire, grenades 
and mortar shells blasting all around 
them. 
With 
snipers 
shooting 
at 
them, 
Carlton Hand abandoned his radio, se-
cured grenades from one of his com-
rades, and killed two attacking Ger-
mans. He then seized a rifle in the face 
of continuing mortar and sniper fire, 
and killed two, and wounded one more 
German. 
Germans then dropped grenades on 
his position, which he then proceeded 
to hurl back at the enemy. He then 
captured 20 prisoners in the seizure of 
the enemy position. 
Carlton Hand was awarded the Silver 
Star Medal for Valor for his heroic ef-
forts. Carlton Hand is the definition of 
an American hero, and we owe our fu-
ture to the brave actions of Carlton 
Hand and the men and women like him 
who have shaped this great United 
States of America. 
Our country was forged by the blood, 
sweat, and tears of brave men and 
women like Carlton Hand. 
May God bless them as they look 
down upon us. 
f 
RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
MICHAEL LECIK 
(Ms. SPANBERGER asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. SPANBERGER. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in recognition of the self-
lessness, courage, and resilience of my 
constituent, Mike Lecik. 
Mike served in the United States Air 
Force and deployed twice to the Middle 
East as a military firefighter. After re-
turning home to Powhatan County, he 
was diagnosed with multiple myeloma, 
a blood cancer linked to the carcino-
genic conditions of his work. 
The VA does not currently recognize 
the service connection between fire-
fighting and diseases such as myeloma, 
leaving many veterans like Mike un-
able to get the care they need. 
Since his diagnosis, Mike, and his 
wife, Tiffany, and their family have 
demonstrated incredible strength, and 
I am deeply inspired by his commit-
ment to ensuring that no other mili-
tary firefighters face these same chal-
lenges. 
In his service overseas and through 
his advocacy at home, Mike represents 
the best of Virginia’s Seventh District. 
Driven by his story and in coordination 
with Mike, I recently introduced the 
Michael Lecik Military Firefighters 
Protection Act. This bill would recog-
nize cancer, lung disease, and other se-
rious illnesses as presumptive service- 
connected disabilities for our Nation’s 
veteran military firefighters. 
I thank Mike for his tireless work on 
this issue, and I thank my colleague, 
Congressman BACON, for joining me in 
this effort to do right by the thousands 
of veterans and their families, people 
like my constituent, Mike Lecik. 
f 
THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC DOES NOT 
DISCRIMINATE 
(Mr. CLINE asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLINE. Madam Speaker, the 
opioid epidemic does not discriminate 
based on age, race, sex or socio-
economic status. It is a plague that af-
fects Americans in all regions of the 
country, including Virginia’s Sixth 
Congressional District. 
In 2016, the United States experi-
enced an astonishing 60,000 deaths re-
lated to drug overdose; nearly two- 
thirds of which involved opioids. That 
means that more than 91 Americans die 
from an opioid overdose every day, 
making it the leading cause of death 
for people under the age of 50. 
This crisis is being fueled in part by 
a synthetic opioid known as fentanyl, a 
drug 80 to 100 times more powerful 
than morphine. In 2018 alone, more 
than 800 people died from fentanyl 
overdoses in Virginia. 
I applaud my colleagues for voting to 
save lives this week by renewing the 
classification of fentanyl as a Schedule 
I narcotic. 
Through commonsense solutions like 
this and support for first responders 
and treatment programs, I am con-
fident we can help our fellow Ameri-
cans struggling with opioid abuse and 
end this insidious epidemic. 
REMEMBERING 
75TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE LIBERATION OF 
AUSCHWITZ 
(Mrs. MILLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. MILLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in remembrance of the 75th anni-
versary of the liberation of Auschwitz 
Concentration Camp. 
I grew up in a Jewish community, 
alongside children of Holocaust sur-
vivors. It was something that was so 
real and so close. Following the libera-
tion of Auschwitz and the devastation 
of the Holocaust, we must never forget 
the tragedy that happens when reli-
gious persecution goes unchecked. 
We need to remember the six million 
heartbreaking deaths of our Jewish 
brothers and sisters around the world 
to ensure that they are never forgot-
ten. We must teach our next genera-
tion about the horrors of the Holocaust 
to ensure that it will never happen 
again. 
We must speak out, now and forever, 
against religious oppression, against 
anti-Semitism, and against radical ex-
tremism. 
We have all been taught the Golden 
Rule and we all should live by it. 
f 
WAR IS VIOLENT AND 
CATASTROPHIC 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
war is a violent and catastrophic act, 
and its impact on the people of any na-
tion is one that is long-lasting. 
Between the wars of Iraq and Afghan-
istan, close to 7,000 Americans lost 
their lives; families were broken. But 
yet, we honor them for their service, as 
we honor those who are now serving 
and who have put on the uniform un-
selfishly, just like the young men and 
women who were called immediately 
after the killing of General Soleimani. 
Today, we made an important state-
ment on this floor; that is that the 
Constitution prevails; the rule of law 
prevails, as we hope it will prevail in 
the other body in this proceeding. 
We know that Congress declares war. 
If there is danger, the President can 
use the War Powers Resolution. But as 
we did not find weapons of mass de-
struction in Iraq, we have an endless 
war. 
We do not need to engage in a war 
with Iran. If we are attacked or there 
are hostilities, we can defend ourselves. 
Let us deliberate on behalf of the 
American people and do it the right 
way. 
To our military, we thank you for 
your service.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H741 
January 30, 2020 
Mr. EMMER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Liberian com-
munity in Minnesota and throughout 
the United States, as they celebrate 
passage of the Liberian Refugee Immi-
gration Fairness Act. This act provides 
a lifeline to certainty for Liberians 
around the country, bringing relief and 
clarity to so many families and com-
munities throughout my district and 
home State. 
Adoption of this important legisla-
tion is credited to the hard work of the 
many advocates who lived in a con-
stant state of limbo and under the 
threat of the unknown for many years. 
Thank you to all our community mem-
bers who banded together to advocate 
for our Liberian American friends and 
neighbors. 
I am pleased that Congress, the ad-
ministration, and President Trump 
have finally provided our Liberian 
Americans, our neighbors, and our 
friends, the clarity and protection they 
deserve.

ATROCITIES IN IDLIB, SYRIA 
(Mr. RASKIN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RASKIN. Madam Speaker, there 
is another unfolding humanitarian cri-
sis in Syria, this time in Idlib province. 
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has 
launched an all-out assault on the 
province, aided by Vladimir Putin’s 
Russian forces. 
More than a quarter of a million peo-
ple, 80 percent of them women and chil-
dren, have fled their homes to the 
northern part of Idlib into freezing 
desert and refugee camps, without ade-
quate food, shelter, or medical care. 
With the current death toll of the 
Syrian civil war estimated to exceed 
500,000, along with six million people 
internally 
displaced, 
humanitarian 
groups are concerned that the siege of 
Idlib will result in the largest humani-
tarian disaster yet seen in the country. 
This assault is a replay of the siege 
of Aleppo as the government again 
bombs civilian targets like hospitals, 
schools, markets and people’s homes. 
This disaster will only be com-
pounded as a result of Russia vetoing a 
U.N. Security Council resolution allow-
ing cross-border aid to Syrian refugees. 
Although a modified resolution was 
adopted, cross-border aid has been re-
stricted and may come to an end this 
summer if Russia and Syria continue 
to push for its elimination. 
As U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly 
Craft said: ‘‘Syrians will suffer need-
lessly as a result of this resolution.’’

SUPPORTING NATIONAL SCHOOL 
CHOICE WEEK 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to express my support for 
National School Choice Week. 
Every American enjoys choices, and, 
indeed, it is the American way; yet, 
when it comes to educating our chil-
dren, one size fits all seems to be the 
norm—and is even forced upon fami-
lies. 
Every family, regardless of their 
background, should be able to choose 
an educational option that is right for 
the needs of their children, whether 
that is traditional public schools, char-
ter schools, magnet schools, private 
schools, or other alternatives. 
There is plenty of evidence to suggest 
that, when a family can choose a 
school based on their own children’s 
needs, there is an increase in college 
readiness and success in life after grad-
uation. 
If we expect today’s students to be-
come tomorrow’s world leaders, we 
should give them every opportunity to 
learn and grow and thrive, to have 
choices that work for them, not for the 
government and not for special inter-
ests. 
Expanding school choice is the most 
viable option to prepare students for 
success.

COMMEMORATING 75TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE END OF DEATH 
CAMPS 
(Mr. ENGEL asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, last 
week, I went with Speaker PELOSI and 
some other Members of Congress to Je-
rusalem, where we had the commemo-
ration of the 75th anniversary of the 
end of the death camps. Many of our 
colleagues went to Auschwitz-Birkenau 
to look at the concentration camps. 
Some of my colleagues have said 
this, but I think it is important that 
each one of us says it: We have to raise 
our voices loudly and clearly and mon-
itor the situation so these types of 
things don’t happen again to any peo-
ple. 
First of all, anti-Semitism is rearing 
its ugly head, and certainly we need to 
do everything we can to stop the 
scourge of anti-Semitism. We cannot 
treat people the way the Jewish popu-
lation was treated during the Second 
World War, and America must always 
be in the forefront of equal rights and 
standing up against injustice. 
I wanted to take the time to say that 
participating in that conference was 
really emotional for me, and I think 
that we should always say: Never again 
will we stand idly by and allow anti- 
Semitism to rear its ugly head. Never 
again will we stand idly by and allow 
any group of people to be killed and 
slaughtered. 
So, never again.

DISCUSSING ECONOMIC DATA 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 3, 2019, the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. SCHWEIKERT) is recognized 
for 60 minutes as the designee of the 
minority leader. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I yield to the gentleman from Indiana 
(Mr. HOLLINGSWORTH). 
HONORING THE LIFE OF LORILEE WARD 
Mr. 
HOLLINGSWORTH. 
Madam 
Speaker, over the last few weeks, we 
have lost two Americans about whom I 
want to, here, speak. 
Earlier this month, we lost a valued 
member of our southern Indiana com-
munity. Lorilee Ward from Clarksville 
died of cancer. All of us, her friends, 
her family, are devastated by her loss, 
and the outpouring of support from fel-
low Hoosiers shows just how large a 
legacy Lorilee leaves behind in her 
wake created by that strong dedication 
she always had to her community and 
the values she so fervently believed in. 
Lorilee’s warmth and enthusiasm 
was a staple of our Clark County com-
munity. Lorilee served on the board of 
southern Indiana’s Clark-Floyd Coun-
ties Convention Tourism Bureau, a 
group dedicated to bettering our neigh-
bors. She furiously believed in the 
prosperity and future of our towns all 
the way across southern Indiana, and 
she gave liberally of her time and of 
her energy to make sure that we are all 
the best we can be. 
For Lorilee, the future of our com-
munities of Indiana and of our country 
rests in preserving and promoting our 
conservative values in principles like 
the value of all life; supporting our 
troops and veterans, which she did so 
passionately through her involvement 
in Wreaths Across America; economic 
opportunity and job creation; and put-
ting America and Americans first. 
Lorilee always fought to make sure 
our voices and values were heard. She 
served adamantly as the president of 
the Clark County Republican Women, a 
reliable and relentless volunteer for 
her President, and a member of our In-
diana GOP. She did it all on behalf of 
others, knowing that she was fighting 
for bettering the lives of future genera-
tions. 
Southern Indiana will not be the 
same, both because of her work and be-
cause of our loss. 
Lorilee’s 
mighty 
spirit 
shown 
through in all she did. Lorilee has al-
ways been a fighter. At the age of 18, 
Lorilee was diagnosed with stage 4 non- 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and she was told 
by her doctors that the end was near, 
that she should expect the worst. But 
Lorilee did not expect the worst. She 
fought for the best. She fought for her 
future and lived another 37 years. 
Despite the challenges she faced, 
Lorilee had a smile on her face every 
day and went through life with a posi-
tive energy that inspired everyone 
around her. Lorilee was truly a force of 
nature, and her death is a great loss.

and spend time with you. This was es-
pecially true for Lorilee. 
Lorilee, survived by her incredible 
family, was loved dearly by them. 
Lorilee put her family above every-
thing else, and I know her husband of 
25 years, Donald; her two daughters, 
Chantelle and Darci; her father; her 
siblings; and her 14 grandchildren will 
miss her dearly. That, to me, sounds 
like a crowded table. That, to me, 
sounds like a great legacy. 
Madam Speaker, may Lorilee rest in 
peace. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF THOMAS LAVELL 
SECREST 
Mr. 
HOLLINGSWORTH. 
Madam 
Speaker, Thomas Lavell Secrest passed 
away this week after a life full of serv-
ice to his country. 
Tom was born in Corpus Christi, 
Texas, and attended the U.S. Military 
Academy at West Point from 1966 to 
1970. After graduation, Tom served in 
Germany and Fort Knox, achieving the 
rank of captain, as a tanker. Tom is re-
membered by his West Point class-
mates as a smart and kind guy. 
After his service in the Army, Tom 
returned to Texas to attend law school 
at the University of Texas and then 
went on to a very successful legal ca-
reer in New York City. Over his career, 
Tom 
represented 
Polaroid, 
AT&T, 
Lucent, and Hunter Douglas in defend-
ing their intellectual property. Tom’s 
demand for uncompromised perform-
ance was evident in every pursuit of his 
life: academic, military, professional, 
and personal. 
Tom spent the last few years of his 
life in South Carolina with his beloved 
wife, Liz, where they enjoyed their mu-
tual passion for golf. Throughout their 
marriage, they also ensured that their 
friends, their family could participate 
in their love for golf, including Golf 
Magazine’s 
editor-in-chief, 
George 
Peper. 
In 2002, George highlighted his friend 
Tom’s spirit both on and off the golf 
course in an article that tells you ex-
actly who he was: an ardent believer in 
hard work, a fiercely loyal friend, hus-
band, and father. He was someone who 
never missed an opportunity to hit the 
links. And while always staying hum-
ble, Tom’s golf game was legendary. 
A golfer once said that many golfers 
argue very frequently, very vigorously 
about where they played or which 
course was the best; but, at the end of 
their lives, what they will remember is 
with whom they played. Tom truly em-
bodied this by always remembering it 
was 
with 
whom 
you 
played 
that 
mattered most. He played with his fa-
vorite friends, his family. 
He is survived by his wife, his son, 
his daughter-in-law, his brothers, his 
nieces, his nephews, and his grand-
children. I know each of them will miss 
him dearly but will carry on the legacy 
of earnestness and humor that he in-
stilled in each of them. 
Tom is someone whom those around 
him could always rely on, but he was 
taken from us far too son. Our country 
and his family are better off because of 
his life, because of his service, and be-
cause of his spirit. 
Madam Speaker, may Tom rest in 
peace. 
Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Madam Speaker, 
I am going to come down to the lower 
microphone because we are going to be 
using a number of slides, and I want to 
apologize right now, this one is going 
to be a little thick. We are actually 
going to do some information in regard 
to what CBO put out this week and 
some other economic data and try to 
put it in perspective. So let me come 
on down. 
I get teased all the time about the 
charts and the fact that I can’t even 
get my wife to now watch me do these 
because she says I am boring, but it is 
important. 
Madam Speaker, what I am going to 
try to do today—and let’s see if I can 
do it as well as possible. I want to walk 
through what is a little bit of sort of 
the political folklore that we engage in 
here about the math when we talk 
about the deficits and the debt and the 
economic future and when you hear 
people say things like the debt as com-
pared to the size of the economy and 
what is driving it, because, if we don’t 
actually sort of get our act together 
here and start to become honest about 
just the math and what is driving it, 
we can’t put together policy. 
I am incredibly optimistic that there 
is a path where we can digest the reali-
ties of these costs that happen from 
our demographics, because we are a so-
ciety that is getting old really fast, but 
we do politics now. 
The other day, I am home and I am 
watching a little bit of one of the Pres-
idential forums. It is a candidate on 
the Democrat side running for Presi-
dent from the Midwest, and his first 
comment was: These deficits, this tril-
lion-dollar deficit we are going to have 
next year, that is because of tax re-
form. 
It just breaks your heart because you 
know these individuals are smart, and 
have we hit this world where, as Re-
publicans—and please understand, I 
beat up both sides—as Republicans, we 
had this history of saying: Well, the 
debt and deficit comes from waste and 
fraud. 
The left often said: We don’t tax rich 
people enough. 
All that is lunacy, and the invest-
ment in a calculator here would really 
go a long way. 
First, I brought a number of boards 
because, heaven knows, I am incapable 
of speaking without my charts. 
This, right here, is the change in re-
ceipts to the Federal Government. Rev-
enues are up, and they are up fairly 
substantially since tax reform. 
Do you understand last fiscal year 
revenues were up over 4 percent? With 
the size of our economy, that is actu-
ally a big deal. Our problem is we in-
creased spending just shy of 8 percent. 
Does anyone see a small math prob-
lem there? 
Our projection is we will take in over 
$3.6 trillion in the fiscal year we are in 
right now. Last year, revenues were 
about $3.462 trillion. That is a fairly 
substantial increase in these revenues, 
but how can we keep running these 
massive deficits? 
Well, it turns out it is spending, but 
it is spending on what we call the man-
datory side, the formulas that we don’t 
get to vote on and we are terrified as 
elected officials to talk about. 
I am going to walk us through part of 
this math. First, let’s do some of the 
positive stuff, and then let’s get to the 
really difficult policy issues. 
So, revenues are up, and they are 
going up fairly substantially. A lot of 
this economic growth and receipts is 
payroll taxes. It is because we are hav-
ing a remarkable period here of em-
ployment. 
When you look at what we call the 
U–6 data put out by the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, the number of our 
brothers and sisters who weren’t even 
looking for work that are moving into 
the labor force and all the sudden now 
are paying payroll taxes, Social Secu-
rity, Medicare, these things, is remark-
able. 
We should actually, as a society, be 
joyful, both those on the left and those 
on the right. We should be joyful be-
cause, if I had come into this room 3 
years ago and said we are living in a 
time where we have more jobs than 
people, we are going to live in a time 
where it actually turns out to be our 
brothers and sisters who are function-
ally defined as the working poor have 
the fastest growing wages, double what 
the mean is—this has been our goal 
around here for years, and it is not a 
Democratic goal or a Republican goal. 
It just should be a goal of lifting people 
up, and it is happening. So let’s take 
some joy in that. And it turns out it is 
also helping the receipts here to the 
Federal Government. 
There are other things that we 
should be joyful about. 
When you actually look at this en-
hanced period of economic stability, 
what happens when what we call the 
real net worth—the value of your 
homes, the value of your savings, the 
value of your investments, the value of 
things you hold—well, it turns out the 
bottom 50 percent, their real net worth 
has gone up fairly substantially, over 
15 percent in these last 3 years. That is 
a big deal. 
But then I will get folks who will just 
make up stuff. Well, the rich are the 
ones. Well, it turns out that is not 
true. 
b 1330 
The top 1 percent aren’t having most 
of 
that 
growth 
in 
their 
personal 
wealth. It is the bottom 50 percent is 
where most of the growth is. 
Can we take some joy in that? This is 
one of the most unique economic cy-
cles because it has been so stable for so 
long. You also have the GDP numbers 
that came out today basically saying:

Hey, looks like we are just going to be 
in a steady, healthy environment. 
We really need this because you get 
really positive math when you hit this 
type of economic stability. 
All right, last one on this. When you 
look at what we call real wage growth, 
who are seeing their incomes go up? I 
know this is thick, but the politics— 
and I accept that we are in an election 
year, but we have to stop—what do you 
call that? Oh, yeah—lying. 
The fact of the matter is it isn’t the 
top income earners who are seeing the 
most actual movement in their wages. 
Take a look at this red line. That is 
what is really going on right now. The 
blue is what we thought was going to 
happen. You see that inflection point. 
I have been on the Joint Economic 
Committee for years now, and it was 
only about 3 years ago we were having 
some of the smartest economists, the 
experts, coming in and saying: Well, 
you have to understand, Joint Eco-
nomic Committee, those who don’t 
have a high school education, those 
who have moderate skill sets, you need 
to prepare, because they will be part of 
the permanently poor, the permanent 
underclass of your country forever. 
Then, all of a sudden, something has 
happened the last couple of years 
where their labor now has some of the 
most value in this economy. Look at 
the wage growth for our brothers and 
sisters 
who 
didn’t 
graduate 
high 
school, who have moderate skill sets. 
That is where the substantial, almost 
double the growth of the mean is. 
We should be joyful about this be-
cause all of those fancy economists 
who were in front of us just a couple of 
years ago said that it couldn’t happen, 
that we should be planning for this to 
be a population that will have to live 
in a subsidized world for the rest of 
their lives. It turns out they were 
wrong. 
We have sort of a family saying: Fig-
ure out what you do right and do more 
of it; figure out what you have done 
wrong and do less of it. 
Maybe we should stop inviting those 
particular economists to come to tes-
tify in front of us. 
Where is the trillion-dollar deficit 
coming from? Well, it is a combination 
of a bunch of things. This is one of the 
things that will frustrate you, particu-
larly about Congress. We seem incapa-
ble of dealing with complexity because 
the solution to this is also really com-
plex. We will sort of close on that. 
This chart, it is almost impossible to 
read this chart, so I stole some notes 
from myself. 
The point I am trying to make here 
is this is 2017, before tax reform, and 
where we are at today. The top one is 
net interest. It looks like our projec-
tion of what we are going to spend in 
interest costs has gone down and gone 
down fairly substantially. 
The argument here is one of the 
things that happened in tax reform 
that we didn’t expect is that savings 
rates are much better than we expected 
and what they call repatriation, cash 
that has been coming in from over-
seas—remember, we had that cycle for 
almost 20 years where businesses would 
move their headquarters out of the 
country and then keep their profits 
there because if they brought them in, 
they were substantially taxed in the 
United States. We made a deal with 
sort of the world and those businesses 
saying: Here will be the new tax rates. 
Bring your money in. 
That money, I think, in our reports 
we had last summer, we were seeing 
about $400 billion more than we had 
modeled for. I have not seen a more re-
cent number, but there is an argument 
that we are afloat with cash in North 
America, in the United States, and 
that drives interest rates down. 
Is that a first- or second-degree ef-
fect? Let’s not geek out too much on 
that. 
But take a look here. Let’s use, like, 
72 percent of the budget, of our spend-
ing here. It is what we call mandatory. 
It is on autopilot. 
The other portion is what we call dis-
cretionary. About half of that is de-
fense, and about half of that is every-
thing else you think of as government, 
from the Park Service to the FDA to 
this and that. That is the other, let’s 
call it 14, 15 percent of government. 
That is what we vote on, the discre-
tionary side. 
Take a look at this. Where you see 
that little orange bar, you see that big 
piece of growth. Those are things we 
have voted on in just the last 2 years, 
and it is up substantially. 
We have some other charts I am 
going to show you that if you look at 
the growth in deficit—not debt, the 
deficits from this year, even the next 
couple of years—a big driver of it is our 
own votes. It is the discretionary side. 
This here is the growth in manda-
tory, and there is something wonderful 
about this. Do you notice that it is get-
ting smaller? I know these look like 
tiny, little increments, but when you 
are talking about a trillion dollars, 
that is a lot of money. 
It turns out, because of the economic 
expansion, we are seeing a reduction in 
some of the demands for entitlements. 
We always have to be careful when 
we talk about this because this is sort 
of the—what is the term?—third rail 
for a lot of us who are elected officials 
to explain this. 
There are earned entitlements. You 
earned 
your 
Social 
Security; 
you 
earned your Medicare; you earned your 
military pension. Those are earned en-
titlements. You paid for those. You 
earned them with your service and 
your contributions. 
There are other types of entitlements 
that are part of this mandatory for-
mula. It is a treaty obligation. You are 
part of a certain Native American pop-
ulation, other things. They are obliga-
tions we took on. Or you fell under a 
certain income. You know, you are 
having really rough times in your life, 
so there is certain income support or 
access to certain healthcare or housing 
allowances and those things. 
We haven’t done all the analysis yet, 
but we think that is where part of this 
drop all of a sudden in mandatory 
spending has come from. As the econ-
omy is growing and we are seeing our 
brothers and sisters who were—the 
term is often marginally detached or 
detached from the workforce—are com-
ing back in, all of a sudden, they are 
leaving certain programs. So that is 
another benefit we are seeing mathe-
matically 
and 
budgetarily 
in 
the 
growth of the economy. 
Is that a first-degree effect or second- 
degree effect from tax reform? Okay, 
fine. 
Other spending, these are other types 
of programs that may have their own 
individual trust funds or those things, 
and you will take a look and notice 
that their spending is up just a little 
bit. 
Here is where, when we talk about 
the tax reform, we see lower corporate 
taxes; we see substantially higher pay-
roll taxes because people are working; 
and we see lower individual taxes. 
When you have someone walk up be-
hind one of these microphones and say, 
‘‘Well, it was the tax reform. That is 
why we are’’—no, it is not. Tax reform 
is part of it. I mean, we always mod-
eled that tax reform was going to cost 
about $1.4 trillion over 10 years. 
If we could get the economic expan-
sion and employment statistics, that 
number would come down. You all saw 
now—because I know everyone imme-
diately grabbed their CBO update re-
port—that from August to the report 
this week, there is a $705 billion reduc-
tion in the deficit projection over the 
10 years. 
A lot of that, I think, are these first- 
and second-degree effects. Some of that 
was interest rates are lower, like you 
see up here in this top line, because 
people are saving more, and payroll 
taxes, which you see down over here, 
because more people are working. 
I don’t want to sound whiny up here 
and frustrated, but these numbers are 
complex. I will go through this three or 
four times with a highlighter to get my 
head around the numbers, and then I 
will turn to the freaky smart staff of 
the Joint Economic Committee and 
others to make sure we are under-
standing it correctly. 
But I beg of my brothers and sisters 
who are elected or policymakers, stop 
spouting off in political terms, because 
if we can start to get an honest under-
standing of the math, maybe we can 
come up with some honest approaches 
on how to deal with the crushing level 
of debt that is coming at us. 
Let’s start walking through what is 
driving the deficits and the debt. One 
of the comments I heard the other day 
from an economist on I think it was 
CNBC—now, it was ideological. It was a 
politically liberal economist from a 
university: Well, if we could have some 
substantial cuts in defense, we would 
see all these changes in these deficits.

That is lunacy. Look, the model on 
defense is pretty flat and stable. 
Here is a number I am going to give 
you two or three times, and I beg of 
you, I know a number of people don’t 
want to hear this, but it is math: Just 
the growth of Social Security, Medi-
care, and healthcare entitlements over 
the next 5 years equals the entire De-
fense Department. 
Is that Republican or Democrat? It is 
neither. It is demographics. 
There are—what?—74 million of us 
who are baby boomers. We are about 
halfway moving into our retirement 
cycle, turning 65, qualifying for certain 
benefits. It is like Congress only just 
recently discovered there were baby 
boomers. But when you hear someone 
start to say something like, ‘‘Well, if 
we would just cut defense, all of a sud-
den the numbers are better,’’ it is lu-
nacy. 
You could get rid of all of defense to-
morrow, and it only gives you 5 years 
of the growth in Social Security, Medi-
care, healthcare entitlements. Why is 
it so hard to tell the truth? 
Here is another one. This is sort of 
building a chart right out of CBO, Con-
gressional Budget Office. CBO projects 
budget deficit rise is entirely—this is 
CBO—driven by soaring Social Secu-
rity and Medicare shortfalls. 
I know it is the third rail. I know we 
are not supposed to talk about it. But 
if you believe like I do, I believe it is a 
moral obligation to protect Social Se-
curity and Medicare. How can you step 
up to that ethical obligation and then 
not tell the truth about the math? You 
know, you can’t fix a problem unless 
you are willing to accept it. 
Look, the chart is the chart is the 
chart. This is from the nonpartisan ar-
biters of what is going on. It is demo-
graphics. And the sizes of these num-
bers are just devastatingly large. 
Let’s take a look at another one. 
There is a bunch of the tax reform that 
expires in the next couple of years, and 
we go back to other sort of tax rates 
and those things, but this one, we just 
pretend everything is permanent, that 
those revenue gains that are coming in 
a couple of years don’t happen, assum-
ing they would create multipliers in 
the economy, which they won’t. They 
probably won’t pay for themselves, but 
that is a completely different chart and 
models. This also misses a bunch of the 
expanded spending that happened late 
last year when we lifted some of the 
budgetary restriction caps. 
But once again, 90 percent of the 
budgetary shortfall is Social Security, 
Medicare, healthcare entitlements, but 
mostly Medicare, yet this body is terri-
fied to talk about that. It is the math. 
One more on this, just to sort of get 
our head around it because I am frus-
trated, because for those of us who do 
believe there is a policy set, and I have 
been behind this microphone—and the 
poor folks who have to try to keep up 
with me. Tell me if I am starting to 
speak too quickly. I have had a lot of 
coffee today. 
There is a way to get there. Now, 
when I say ‘‘get there,’’ that means to 
sort of stay about 95 percent of debt to 
GDP and hold it as we wait for those of 
us who are baby boomers to meet our 
reward and go back to more normal 
population demographic numbers. This 
is hard, but it is the reality. Then we 
put this together. 
And, I am sorry, we don’t typically 
try to do something that is this bla-
tant, but it is. This is one of the things 
that comes into our office, saying: 
‘‘Well, if you would tax rich people 
more, you would be fine.’’ It is lunacy. 
It only covers about 4.7 percent of—8.3 
percent of GDP. It doesn’t even cover 
close to half of the total shortfall when 
you put everything together. 
b 1345 
The entire defense budget, if you get 
rid of that, we have already talked 
about that, it only covers 5 years of the 
growth in spending. 
We actually have an entire chart list 
if anyone ever wants it. You are wel-
come to call our office where we actu-
ally have been laying out all of these 
proposals. 
If we tax this bunch more, or Repub-
licans, if we do this in waste and fraud, 
or this and that, and you start to see, 
we are talking about slivers that func-
tionally have almost no impact. Be-
cause if you do them solo and not tie it 
in with lots of other economic growth 
dynamics, you don’t get anywhere. 
The last column is just things that 
are being proposed in the Presidential 
race. So we are talking about trillion- 
dollar deficits, and then you look at 
that last bar on this chart and those 
trillion-dollar deficits don’t even have 
these things in it. That is about an-
other 25.6 percent of GDP going to 
debt. 
You can’t get there. The fact of the 
matter is, the economy blows up a long 
time before that. 
So, can we move back a little bit 
from the lunacy and actually sort of 
say: Okay, how do you get there? 
SCHWEIKERT, you keep coming to the 
microphone. You keep begging your 
Democrat colleagues and Republican 
colleagues to open up their minds and 
think more creatively—think with a 
calculator—actually, in some way opti-
mistically. We joke in my office that I 
am 57 with a 4-year old. I am opti-
mistic. 
But first off, you have to grow. We 
have to grow like crazy. You do tax 
policy 
that 
maximizes 
economic 
growth. And we saw that in some of the 
earlier boards here when you see what 
is happening in the labor force partici-
pation and payroll taxes. 
You will have to fix the immigration 
system. The economic modelers keep 
coming to us saying: A talent-based 
immigration system will give you 
much more economic lift. 
We are going to have to also come up 
with policies that encourage family 
formation. Birth rates are collapsing in 
our country. And it turns out that that 
has a really devastating effect over the 
coming decades in what happens in eco-
nomic growth and we just need to be 
honest about that. But there are other 
things. So that is population stability. 
There are other things you can do in 
economic growth. I am not happy with 
the term ‘‘deregulating.’’ I argue that 
you need to move to a type of smart 
regulation. We all walk around with 
these super computers in our pocket, 
and we don’t stop for a second to think 
what would happen if we actually 
started to use technology as part of our 
regulations. 
There are arguments, like in finan-
cial markets, the ability to use tech-
nology to find bad actors, instead of 
the lunacy of the model used today, 
which is almost like a 1938 model where 
people fill out pieces of paper. They 
may email them in, but they are still 
filling out pieces of paper instead of 
using technology to watch the mar-
kets. 
It turns out you could crowdsource 
data for water, for air, and so many of 
these things, and have instantaneous 
information if there is a bad actor in 
your environment. And it turns out it 
is dramatically less expensive because 
you don’t have to be crushing each lit-
tle business with regulations. If one of 
them screws up, you catch them imme-
diately because you are using tech-
nology. 
There are lots of ideas like this. They 
are not Republican. They are not Dem-
ocrat. They are technology. But, yet, 
you have to be willing to take on the 
bureaucracy. And as a lot of us are 
learning around here, it is the bureauc-
racy now that basically runs Wash-
ington, D.C. 
Technology disruptions. We need to 
have an honest discussion. You saw in 
the charts; Medicare is the primary 
driver of our debt. You have to be hon-
est with it. How do you have a disrup-
tion in healthcare prices? And there 
are lots and lots of ideas that you are 
going to have to put together. 
We had a meeting in our office ear-
lier today. We were walking through 
the math on pharmaceuticals. Did you 
know the misuse or lack of use—which 
is misuse—of pharmaceuticals is over 
half a trillion dollars a year? Sixteen 
percent of all healthcare spending is 
because of the fact that people didn’t 
take, or took too much, or screwed up 
taking their hypertension medicine, or 
other things. 
But there is a simple technology so-
lution. It turns out it is not in the 
pharmaceutical pricing. It is actually 
in the cap of the pharmaceutical bottle

did not take your hypertension medi-

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H745 
January 30, 2020 
platform is 16 percent of all U.S. 
healthcare spending? We have to be 
willing to think creatively and disrup-
tively. 
There is the thing you can blow into. 
It looks like a large kazoo and in-
stantly tells you you have the flu; in-
stantly can bang off your medical 
records; 
and 
instantly 
order 
your 
antivirals. 
Would that make us healthier, more 
productive, less time getting sick? Of 
course, it would. Is that Republican or 
Democrat? It is just technology, except 
it is illegal. That type of technology 
today, the way our laws are set up, is 
illegal. 
How do we actually drag in the will-
ingness to engage in those disruptions? 
It is one of my running arguments. 
Should we have protected Blockbuster 
Video from Netflix? We love it when it 
comes into our home and makes our 
lives easier. But what happens when it 
makes many of our constituencies that 
are filling up the halls here lobbying us 
really nervous? 
There are technology disruptions out 
there that could crash the price of 
healthcare and raise productivity and 
raise GDP. We know what they are. 
But the arrogance of this place often 
thinks we know what the future is, and 
we keep getting it wrong. So we need 
to legalize technology. 
Employment. We still have a problem 
with millennial men. We have lots and 
lots of people who have gotten older 
who want to stay in the workforce. 
What do you do in programs to 
incentivize as many people as possible 
to be in the labor force? 
It turns out to be simple ideas that I 
can’t believe we can’t come to an 
agreement on and we have been work-
ing on it for years; things like Social 
Security disability. Should someone 
say: ‘‘Oh, I got a job,’’ boom, they hit 
the cliff and their benefits, and that 
sort of safety net goes away. 
How do you actually smooth the off- 
ramp 
on 
these 
programs 
so 
it 
incentivizes people getting attached 
into the labor force? Because labor 
force attachment is one of the most 
powerful things you can ever do for 
someone’s future and for the economy. 
That is true for lots of programs, even 
the earned entitlement. 
Should we give you a spiff on Social 
Security and Medicare if you will stay 
in the labor force? Because as it turns 
out, you lower our costs. You lower so-
ciety’s costs. 
So we really, really need to think 
about that. And that ties into the 
earned and unearned benefits of how do 
you build incentives in there to be part 
of the labor force to actually use the 
technologies 
that 
make 
your 
healthcare much less expensive but 
keep you healthier. How do we do those 
things? We know the policy, but this 
place seems to think about them in 
silos of: ‘‘Well, I have this piece of leg-
islation that does this,’’ instead of un-
derstanding it will be dozens of pieces 
of legislation that are complex. They 
are politically difficult and have to be 
put together. 
And the reason those are so impor-
tant—I have been working on this 
model now for years saying, if we do 
everything here and do it right, the fu-
ture is actually really bright. If we 
don’t do it, we are crushing my little 
girl. We are crushing our country to 
just a time of anemic growth and 
crushing debt. At some point, Members 
of Congress and the armies of lobbyists 
in these hallways will have to step up 
and admit that we squandered the op-
portunity when we were in this time of 
just almost a miracle Goldilocks econ-
omy where things are stable. 
If we are going to do this, this is the 
time to step up and make it work. But, 
yet, this has been a couple of years 
that I have come behind this micro-
phone, and I will get one or two offices 
that will reach out and want some of 
the slides and some of the backup in-
formation. 
I will have—probably next week—cer-
tain 
associations, 
lobbyists 
come 
marching into my office and saying: 
‘‘David, you can’t talk about tech-
nology that way. Don’t you under-
stand, you are going to screw up our 
business model?’’ 
We have got to get honest. We know 
the math. We know how devastating it 
gets. And just to make a point, before 
tax reform, CBO was still predicting in 
these next couple of years we are going 
to have trillion-dollar deficits. We have 
known this is coming. The game here is 
to find someone or something to blame. 
How about actually starting to ex-
pect us to start offering solutions? 
That is why I am behind this micro-
phone. There is a path. It will be hard. 
It will be complex, but there is a path 
where it works. 
Let’s try it. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time.

83. The SPEAKER presented a petition of 
Mr. Gregory Watson, a citizen of Austin, TX, 
relative to respectfully requesting that Con-
gress offer for ratification by special conven-
tion conducted within the individual states, 
pursuant to Article V, an amendment to the 
United States Constitution which would dis-
qualify any member of the US House of Rep-
resentatives, who is, at the time a declared 
candidate for the office of President of the 
US, from casting a vote upon the impeach-
ment of an incumbent President and which 
would likewise disqualify any member of the 
US Senate, who is, at the time, a declared 
candidate for the office of President, from 
casting a vote in a trial taking place in the 
US Senate relative to the removal from of-
fice of an incumbent President; which was 
referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.

WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, JANUARY 30, 2020 
No. 20 
Senate 
The Senate met at 1:05 p.m. and was 
called to order by the Chief Justice of 
the United States. 
f 
TRIAL 
OF 
DONALD 
J. 
TRUMP, 
PRESIDENT 
OF 
THE 
UNITED 
STATES 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will convene as a Court of Impeach-
ment. 
The Chaplain will lead us in prayer. 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal Lord God, send Your Holy 
Spirit into this Chamber. Permit our 
Senators to feel Your presence during 
this impeachment trial. Illuminate 
their minds with the light of Your wis-
dom, exposing truth and resolving un-
certainties. May they understand that 
You created them with cognitive capa-
bilities and moral discernment to be 
used for Your glory. Grant that they 
will comprehend what really matters, 
separating the relevant from the irrele-
vant. Lord, keep them from fear, as 
they believe that Your truth will tri-
umph through them. Eliminate dis-
cordant static with the music of Your 
wisdom. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen. 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The Chief Justice led the Pledge of 
Allegiance, as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
THE JOURNAL 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senators 
will please be seated. 
If there is no objection, the Journal 
of proceedings of the trial is approved 
to date. 
The Deputy Sergeant at Arms will 
make the proclamation. 
The Deputy Sergeant at Arms, Jen-
nifer Hemingway, made the proclama-
tion as follows: 
Hear ye! Hear ye! Hear ye! All persons are 
commanded to keep silence, on pain of im-
prisonment, while the Senate of the United 
States is sitting for the trial of the articles 
of impeachment exhibited by the House of 
Representatives against Donald John Trump, 
President of the United States. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The majority 
leader is recognized. 
ORDER OF PROCEDURE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
the Senate will conduct another ques-
tion and answer period today. We were 
able to get through nearly 100 ques-
tions yesterday. Senators posed con-
structive questions, and the parties 
were succinct and responsive. I would 
like to compliment all who partici-
pated yesterday. 
We will again break every 2 to 3 
hours and look to take a break for din-
ner around 6:30. 
We have been respectful of the Chief 
Justice’s unique position in reading 
our questions. I want to be able to con-
tinue to assure him that that level of 
consideration for him will continue. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator MURRAY
asks the House 
managers: 
Yesterday, when asked about why the 
House did not amend or reissue subpoenas 
after it passed its resolution authorizing its 
impeachment inquiry, the House Managers 
touched upon the House having the sole 
Power of Impeachment as specified by Arti-
cle I of the Constitution. Could you further 
elaborate as to why that authority controls 
despite any arguments brought forth by 
members of the defense team contesting the 
validity of those subpoenas? 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, that is a good 
question. 
The answer is that these were validly 
issued subpoenas under the House 
rules. The White House argument to 
the contrary is wrong, and it would 
have profound negative implications 
for how Congress and our democracy 
function. 
On January 9, 2019, the House adopt-
ed its rules, like we do every Congress, 
and these rules gave the committee the 
power to issue subpoenas. They are not 
ambiguous rules. Here is the relevant 
portion of rule XI on slide 55: The 
House’s standing rules give each com-
mittee subpoena power ‘‘for the pur-
pose of carrying out any of its func-
tions and duties’’ as it considers nec-
essary. This investigation began on 
September 9, before the Speaker’s an-
nouncement on September 24 that it 
would become part of the impeachment 
inquiry umbrella. 
The President doesn’t dispute that 
the subpoenas issued by these commit-
tees were fully within their respective 
jurisdiction. The argument is that 
somehow, by declaring that this inves-
tigation also falls under an inquiry to 
consider 
Articles 
of 
Impeachment, 
which gives Congress actually greater 
authority, somehow it nullifies the tra-
ditional oversight authority. And this 
just doesn’t make any sense. 
The President counters that we have 
to take a full vote on impeachment 
first because that is what has been 
done in the past. In the Nixon inquiry, 
however, 
the 
Judiciary 
Committee 
needed a House resolution to delegate 
subpoena power, and that is different 
than the Committee’s standing rules 
today. 
The President actually compels the 
opposite conclusion. Several Federal 
judges have been investigated and im-
peached and convicted in the Senate 
without the House having ever taken 
an official vote to authorize the in-
quiry, and a Federal court recently 
confirmed there was no need for a for-
mal vote of the full House to com-
mence impeachment proceedings. 
Even assuming a House vote was nec-
essary, there was a vote. The text of H.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S694 
January 30, 2020 
Res. 660 declared that the six investiga-
tive committees of the House were di-
rected to continue their ongoing inves-
tigations as part of the existing House 
of Representatives inquiry into wheth-
er there was sufficient grounds for the 
House of Representatives to exercise 
its constitutional power to impeach. 
And the committee report, which ac-
companies the resolution, specifically 
described the subpoenas that had been 
issued by the investigating committees 
and said ‘‘all subpoenas to the execu-
tive branch remain in full force.’’ 
So why didn’t the House committee 
just reissue these subpoenas after the 
resolution? The short answer is they 
didn’t need to. The subpoenas were al-
ready fully authorized. 
In any event, even after the resolu-
tion passed, the committees issued sub-
poenas to Mick Mulvaney, Robert 
Blair, and four other witnesses, and the 
President continued to block those 
subpoenas. The argument about a full 
House vote really is just an excuse 
about President Trump’s obstruction. 
The President refused to comply with 
the House subpoenas before the House 
vote and after the House vote. The only 
logical explanation is the one that 
President Trump gave us all along: He 
was determined to fight all the sub-
poenas because, in President Trump’s 
view, according to what he said, he can 
do what he wants. 
That is not what the constitutional 
Republic entrusted to us by the Found-
ers had in mind. This argument doesn’t 
just apply to impeachment. It would 
apply to ordinary oversight investiga-
tions. And it doesn’t just apply to the 
House. It would also apply to the Sen-
ate. 
By sanctioning the President’s blan-
ket obstruction, the Senate would be 
curtailing its own subpoena power in 
the future, as well as the House’s, and 
the oversight obligation that we have, 
as we now know it, would be perma-
nently altered. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Ms. Manager. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Kentucky. 
Mr. PAUL. I have a question to 
present to the desk for the House Man-
ager SCHIFF
and for the President’s 
counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Presiding Officer declines to read 
the question as submitted. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator BALDWIN 
is addressed to the House managers: 
Given that the White House Counsel 
couldn’t answer Senator ROMNEY’s question 
that asked for the exact date the President 
first ordered the hold on security assistance 
to Ukraine, what witness or witnesses could 
answer Senator ROMNEY’s question? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. Thank you, Senator, for 
the question. 
You are right. They were not able to 
directly answer that question, and we 
believe that there is a tremendous 
amount of material out there in the 
form of emails, text messages, con-
versation, and witness testimony that 
can shed additional light on that, in-
cluding an email from last summer be-
tween Mr. Bolton and Mr. Blair, where 
we know from witness testimony this 
issue was discussed. 
What we do know is from multiple 
witnesses. Ukrainian officials knew 
that President Trump had placed a 
hold on security assistance soon after 
it was ordered in July of 2019. So we 
know that not only did U.S. officials 
know about it and OMB communicated 
about it, Ukrainians knew about it as 
well. 
We know from former Deputy For-
eign 
Minister 
of 
Ukraine, 
Olena 
Zerkal—she stated publicly, in fact, 
that the Ukrainian officials knew 
about it and had found out about it in 
July. We also know from the testimony 
of Laura Cooper that her staff received 
two emails from the State Department 
on July 25 revealing that the Ukrain-
ian Embassy was ‘‘asking about secu-
rity assistance’’ and that ‘‘the Hill 
knows about the FMS situation to an 
extent and so does the Ukrainian em-
bassy.’’ That was on July 25, the same 
day as President Trump’s call with 
President Zelensky. 
What we also know is that career dip-
lomat, Catherine Croft, stated that she 
was ‘‘very surprised at the effective-
ness of my Ukrainian counterparts’ 
diplomatic tradecraft, as in to say they 
found out very early on or much earlier 
than I expected them to.’’ 
We also know that LTC Alexander 
Vindman testified that by mid-August 
he was getting questions from Ukrain-
ians about the status of security assist-
ance. So there is a lot of evidence sur-
rounding it. 
The administration continues to ob-
struct wholly our efforts to get the 
emails and correspondence that we 
have asked for. That obviously can be 
remedied by this body with the appro-
priate subpoenas; namely, a subpoena 
to Ambassador Bolton to testify and a 
subpoena to the State Department— 
the Department of State, the Depart-
ment of Defense, and others to actually 
provide that material. 
The last thing I would like to say is, 
last evening, counsel for the President 
was asked the question about why did 
the hold for Ukraine differ from holds 
in the Northern Triangle and other 
holds like Afghanistan. He provided an 
explanation that I am still trying to 
wrap my brain around because he 
seems to be the only person in the ad-
ministration that actually has an ex-
planation. As far as I could tell, the ex-
planation was somewhere along the 
lines of one was public, trying to put 
public pressure on the countries in 
question, and one was not. It was a pri-
vate conversation, a private effort to 
put pressure. 
If that were true, then, of course, 
there would be plenty of evidence, 
plenty of emails, text messages, and 
other correspondence within the entire 
interagency process that we know is 
robust that would illustrate that to be 
the case, but they have failed to pro-
vide any evidence to corroborate that. 
Let me finish with this. I happen to 
know that a lot of people in this Cham-
ber, a lot of people in the Chamber on 
the other side of the Capitol, including 
me, have often described much con-
sternation about redtape and bureauc-
racy and layers of government that run 
too slow. And I sometimes share that 
concern, right, that sometimes it takes 
a long time. There are memos for ev-
erything, emails for everything. There 
are paper trails for everything in this 
town. I think that is true with respect 
to this issue, and it is time that we ac-
tually see that information so we can 
get to the bottom of what actually 
happened. This body could get that in-
formation. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senators SASSE, MCSALLY, 
CRAPO, THUNE, YOUNG, ERNST, and 
BRAUN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator TOOMEY and others is for 
counsel for the President: 
Given that the election of the president is 
one of the most significant political acts in 
which we as citizens engage in our demo-
cratic system, how much weight should the 
Senate give to the fact that removing the 
president from office and disqualifying him 
from ever holding future federal office would 
undo that democratic decision and kick the 
President off the ballot in this year’s elec-
tion? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate. 
One of the concerns that we have 
raised throughout this process over the 
last several months, going back to the 
time when the House was dealing with 
this in their various committees, is we 
are in an election year. There are some 
in this room that are days away from 
the Iowa caucuses taking place. So we 
are discussing the possible impeach-
ment and removal of the President of 
the United States not only during elec-
tion season, in the heart of the election 
season. And I think that this does a 
disservice to the American people. 
Again, we think the basis upon which 
this has moved forward is irregular, to 
say the least. But I do think it com-
plicates the matter for the American 
people that we are literally at the 
dawn of a new season of elections. I 
mean, we are at that season now, and 
yet we are talking about impeaching a 
President. 
And I want to tie this into the ur-
gency that was so prevalent in Decem-
ber with my colleagues, the managers. 
It was so urgent to move this forward 
that they had to do it by mid-Decem-
ber, before Christmas, because national 
security was at stake, and then they 
waited 33 days to bring it here. And 
now they are asking you to do all the

investigation, although they say they 
proved their case but still need more to 
prove it. 
Whereas, we believe—and I want to 
be clear here—that their entire process 
was corrupt from the beginning, and 
they are just putting it on this body. 
But to do it while the American people 
are selecting candidates for nomina-
tion to be the head of their party, to 
run as President of the United States— 
some of you in this very room—and to 
talk about the removal of a President 
of the United States, I think that is all 
part and parcel of the same pattern and 
practice of irregularities that have 
taken place with this impeachment 
proceeding since the beginning. The 
Speaker allowed the articles to linger. 
It was such a nationally urgent matter 
that they could linger for a month. 
So we think that this points to the 
exact problem of what is taking place 
here and that is, as my colleague Mr. 
Cipollone said, this is really taking the 
vote away from the American people. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator TESTER asks the House man-
agers: 
Yesterday Mr. Dershowitz stated, ‘‘If a 
President does something which he believes 
will help him get elected in the public inter-
est that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo 
that results in impeachment.’’ Do you be-
lieve there is any limit to the type or scope 
of quid pro quo a sitting President could en-
gage in with a foreign entity, as long as the 
intent of the sitting President is to get re-
elected in what he or she believes is in the 
public’s best interest? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator. 
There is no limiting principle to the 
argument that we heard last night 
from the President’s team; that is, if 
there is a quid pro quo that the Presi-
dent believes will help him get re-
elected and he believes his reelection is 
in the national interest, then it doesn’t 
matter how corrupt that quid pro quo 
is. It is astonishing that on the floor of 
this body someone would make that ar-
gument. 
Now, it didn’t begin that way, in the 
beginning of the President’s defense, 
but what we have seen over the last 
couple days is a descent into constitu-
tional madness because that way mad-
ness lies. If we are to accept the 
premise that a President, essentially, 
can do whatever he wants, engage in 
whatever quid pro quo he wants—I will 
give you this if you will give me that 
to help me get elected. I will give you 
military dollars if you will give me 
help in my reelection, if you will give 
me illicit foreign interference in our 
election. 
Now, the only reason you made that 
argument is because you know your 
client is guilty and dead to rights. 
That is an argument made of despera-
tion. 
Now, what is so striking to me is al-
most half a century ago we had a Presi-
dent who said: ‘‘Well, when the Presi-
dent does it, that means it is not ille-
gal.’’ That, of course, was Richard 
Nixon. Watergate is now 40 to 50 years 
behind us. Have we learned nothing in 
the last half century? Have we learned 
nothing at all? It seems like we are 
back to where we were: The President 
says it is not illegal or Donald Trump’s 
version under article II, ‘‘I can do 
whatever 
I 
want,’’ 
or 
Professor 
Dershowitz’ point, if the President be-
lieves it helps his reelection, it is, 
therefore, in the national interest; he 
can do whatever he wants. 
In fact, much as we thought that we 
progressed post-Watergate: We enacted 
Watergate reforms; and we tried to in-
sulate the Justice Department from in-
terference by the Presidency; we are 
trying to put an end to the political 
abuses of that Department—as much as 
we thought we enacted campaign fi-
nance reforms, we are right back to 
where we were a half century ago. And 
I would argue, we may be in a worse 
place because this time—this time that 
argument may succeed. 
That argument—if the President says 
it, it can’t be illegal—failed, and Rich-
ard Nixon was forced to resign. But 
that argument may succeed here now. 
That means we are not back to where 
we were; we are worse off than where 
we are. That is the normalization of 
lawlessness. 
I would hope that every American 
would recognize that it is wrong to 
seek foreign help in an American elec-
tion; that Americans should decide 
American elections. I would hope—and 
I believe that every American under-
stands that, and every American un-
derstands that is true for Democratic 
Presidents and Republican ones. I 
would hope that we would understand 
it. I would hope that this trial would be 
one conducive of the truth. 
The Senator asked what witnesses 
could shed light on when the President 
ordered the hold and why. Well, we 
know Mick Mulvaney would. That in-
struction came from OMB. You remem-
ber the testimony of Ambassador Tay-
lor, the shock that went through the 
National Security Council and the 
shock he experienced in that video con-
ference when it was first announced, 
and the instruction was, this comes 
through the President’s Chief of Staff, 
OMB, but it is a direct order from the 
President. 
Well, Mick Mulvaney knows when 
that order went into place and he 
knows why that order went into place 
and he made that statement publicly, 
which he now wishes to recant. I am 
sure he got an earful from the Presi-
dent after he did, but, apparently, it 
doesn’t matter. None of that matters 
because if the President believes it is 
in his interest, it is OK. 
Now, there was an argument also, 
what if it was a credible reason? Of 
course, there is no evidence that this 
was a credible reason to investigate the 
President’s political rival, but let’s say 
it was a credible reason; does that 
make it right? 
What President is not going to think 
he has a credible reason to investigate 
his opponent? What President is going 
to think he doesn’t have a credible rea-
son or wouldn’t be able to articulate 
one or come up with some fig leaf? 
They compounded the dangerous ar-
gument that they made that no quid 
pro quo is too corrupt if you think it 
will help your reelection. They com-
pounded it by saying, if what you want 
is to target your rival, it is even more 
legitimate. That way, madness lies. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from North Dakota. 
Mr. CRAMER. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself and Sen-
ator YOUNG. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators CRAMER 
and YOUNG is for the counsel for the 
President: 
Manager SCHIFF regularly states that if 
the President is innocent he would agree to 
all of the witnesses and documents that the 
Managers want. Is the President the first in-
nocent defendant not to waive his rights? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question because the answer is, obvi-
ously, no. The President is not the first 
innocent defendant who decided not to 
waive his rights, and I think it is strik-
ing and shocking that it is one of the 
arguments that has been repeatedly de-
ployed 
by 
the 
House 
managers 
throughout these proceedings. 
You heard Manager NADLER say only 
the guilty hide evidence, only the 
guilty don’t respond to subpoenas, and 
Manager SCHIFF say that this is not 
the way innocent people act. Well, of 
course, that is contrary to the very 
spirit of our American justice system, 
where people have rights, and asserting 
those rights cannot be interpreted as 
an indication of guilt. That is expressly 
forbidden by the laws and by the Con-
stitution. 
The Supreme Court explained in 
Bordenkircher v. Hayes—a case that is 
cited in our trial memorandum—that 
the very idea of punishing someone, 
which is what the House managers are 
attempting to do here with their ob-
struction of Congress charge—they said 
that if the President insists on the con-
stitutional prerogatives of his office; if 
the President insists that, like vir-
tually every President—at least since 
Nixon and some going further back 
than that—he is going to assert the im-
munity of his senior advisers to compel 
congressional testimony; if he is going 
to assert those rights grounded in the 
separation of powers and essential for 
protecting constitutionally based exec-
utive branch confidentiality interests, 
we are going to call that obstruction of 
Congress and impeach him. 
It is this fundamental theme running 
throughout 
both 
their 
obstruction 
charge and their arguments generally 
here that if the President stands on his 
constitutional rights—if he tries to

protect the institutional prerogatives 
of his office, which he is duty-bound to 
do for future occupants of that office— 
that it is somehow an indication of 
guilt and shows that he ought to be im-
peached. 
That is fundamentally antithetical 
to the American system of justice and 
to our principles of due process, to our 
principles of acknowledging that rights 
can be defended, that rights exist to be 
defended, and that asserting those 
rights cannot be treated either as 
something punishable or as evidence of 
guilt. 
There would be a long line of past 
Presidents—as 
Professor 
Dershowitz 
pointed out, there are a lot of Presi-
dents who have been accused of abuse 
of power. There would also be a long 
line of Presidents who could have been 
impeached for ‘‘obstruction of Con-
gress’’ if every time a President in-
sisted upon the prerogatives of the of-
fice of the Presidency and insisted on 
defending the separation of powers, it 
could be treated as something im-
peachable and as evidence of guilt. 
President Obama himself refused to 
turn over a lot of documents to the 
House in the Fast and Furious inves-
tigation, and his Attorney General was 
held in contempt, but no one thought 
that it was an impeachable offense. 
So the concept of saying that when 
the President asserts the constitu-
tionally grounded prerogatives of his 
office, that it is evidence of guilt is a 
completely bogus assertion. It is con-
trary to all of the principles of our 
American justice system and to the 
fundamental principles of fairness, and 
it ought to be rejected by this body. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. I send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator JONES’ question is for the 
House managers: 
Aside from the House’s Constitutional im-
peachment authority, please identify specifi-
cally which provision or provisions, if any, in 
the House rules or a House Resolution au-
thorized the subpoenas issued by the House 
Committees prior to the passage of House 
Resolution 660. 
In addition, please list the subpoenas that 
were issued after House Resolution 660. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, we 
will compile the list. We don’t have it 
accessible at the moment. Oh, we do 
have it. 
Specifically, the subpoenas that went 
out after the passage of the House reso-
lution were the subpoena to John 
Eisenberg and the subpoenas to Brian 
McCormack, 
Robert 
Blair, 
Michael 
Ellis, Preston Wells Griffith, and Mick 
Mulvaney. 
Let me underscore something that 
my colleague Manager LOFGREN had to 
say, and let me break this down, if I 
can, in very practical terms. 
What is the practical import of what 
counsel for the President would argue? 
It is this: Let’s say that a Democrat is 
elected in November, and let’s say that 
any one of you who chairs a committee 
in the Senate determines that you 
think that the next President is en-
gaged 
in 
something 
questionable, 
maybe even in some wrongdoing, and 
you begin an investigation. I would 
imagine that in your Senate rules, like 
in our House rules—and it is House rule 
X, Senator, that has the specific lan-
guage authorizing the issuance of sub-
poenas as a part of our normal over-
sight responsibility. That power didn’t 
exist at the time of Watergate, so they 
had to have a separate resolution. But 
that House rule, passed each session, 
empowers us to issue subpoenas, as 
committee chairs, as part of our over-
sight jurisdiction. 
So there you are with a Democratic 
President. You are a chair, and you 
start to do oversight. You issue sub-
poenas. You start to learn more, and 
what you learn becomes more and more 
concerning, and you issue more sub-
poenas. 
The administration’s effort to cover 
up its misconduct says: We are not 
going to comply with any of your sub-
poenas. We are going to fight all sub-
poenas. 
And they come up with one bad-faith 
excuse after another as to why they 
don’t have to comply. 
As you investigate further and you 
are able to overcome the wall of ob-
struction, then you begin an impeach-
ment inquiry, and that leads to the 
passage of yet another resolution. 
They would argue to you that all of 
the work you did before you deter-
mined that it merited potential im-
peachment must be thrown out, that 
they were perfectly empowered to ob-
struct you in your oversight responsi-
bility, that you must begin with your 
conclusion and you must begin with 
the conclusion that you were prepared 
to impeach the President before you 
issued a single subpoena; otherwise, 
they can say whatever you did before 
you got to that place should be thrown 
out. 
Now, we did not have the Justice De-
partment do the initial investigation 
here. Why? Because Bill Barr turned it 
down. The same Attorney General that 
mentioned that July 25 call said there 
was nothing to see here. So there was 
no DOJ investigation. There was no 
special counsel investigation. It was 
not as if someone like Ken Starr hand-
ed us a package and said: Here is the 
evidence. Now you can take up an im-
peachment resolution because we have 
done the investigative work. No. We 
had to do that work ourselves. 
They would have you believe that 
any subpoena you issue as a part of 
your 
oversight 
responsibility 
that, 
down the road, reveals evidence that 
leads you to embark on an impeach-
ment inquiry must be disregarded. 
That cannot and is not the law. It 
would render the oversight function 
meaningless. 
Court after court has looked at the 
Congress’s power to issue subpoenas, 
and they have all reached the same 
conclusions. That is, if you have the 
power to legislate, you have the power 
to oversee. Here, we have a violation of 
the Impoundment Control Act. That is, 
Congress passes military spending. The 
President doesn’t spend it, and he gives 
no reason. He keeps it a secret. We are 
investigating that. That can’t be more 
squarely within the oversight power of 
Congress—to find out why aid we ap-
propriated was not going out the door. 
They would say: You can’t look into 
that unless you are prepared to im-
peach the President and announce it 
firsthand. That is the import of that 
argument. It would cripple your over-
sight capacity, and without your over-
sight capacity, your legislative capac-
ity is crippled. That is the real-world 
import of this legal window dressing. 
They would strip you of your ability to 
do meaningful oversight. 
Particularly here, where we are talk-
ing about the misconduct of an im-
peachable kind and character, it would 
mean that a President could obstruct 
his own investigation. 
If you need any evidence of his bad 
faith, which is abundant—of the shift-
ing and springing rationalizations and 
explanations—when 
we 
had 
Corey 
Lewandowski in the Intelligence Com-
mittee, they said, under instructions of 
the White House, he wouldn’t answer 
questions because they might claim ex-
ecutive privilege. Now, this was some-
one who had never worked for the exec-
utive, but they made the claim he 
might use executive privilege. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Time is ex-

Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk on behalf of my-
self and Senators HAWLEY and GRAHAM. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator CRUZ, 
along with Senators HAWLEY and GRA-
HAM, is for both sides—the counsel for 
the President and the House managers: 
Yesterday, Manager DEMINGS
refused to 
answer whether Joe Biden sought any legal 
advice concerning his conflict of interest on 
Burisma, the corrupt Ukrainian company 
that was paying his son Hunter $1 million 
per year. 
USA Today reported that, when asked 
about it, Vice President Biden said, ‘‘He 
hadn’t spoken to his son Hunter Biden about 
his overseas business.’’ 
That account was contradicted by Hunter 
Biden, who told the New Yorker that he told 
his father about Burisma, and ‘‘Dad said, ‘I 
hope you know what you’re doing,’ and I 
said, ‘I do.’ ’’ 
Why do Joe and Hunter Bidens’ stories 
conflict? Did the House ask either one that 
question? 
The White House Counsel goes first. 
Ms. Counsel BONDI. Chief Justice, 
Senators, you heard our answer regard-
ing that yesterday, but it is very inter-
esting that he said he never spoke to 
his son about overseas dealings and 
that his son said different things.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S697 
January 30, 2020 
Joe Biden was the point man for 
Ukraine. The Ukrainians were inves-
tigating at that time a corrupt com-
pany, Burisma, and Zlochevsky, its 
owner—an oligarch—who, by all media 
accounts, as we have discussed, was ex-
tremely corrupt. 
Hunter Biden was paid $83,000 a 
month—a month—to sit on that board 
with having no experience in energy, 
no experience in the Ukraine, and 
didn’t speak the language. We clearly 
know that he had a very fancy job de-
scription, and he did none of those 
things. He attended one or two board 
meetings—one in Monaco. Then he 
went on a fishing trip with Joe Biden’s 
family in Norway. 
The entire time, Joe Biden knows 
that this oligarch is corrupt. Everyone 
knows that. There are news reports ev-
erywhere. No one will dispute that. In 
fact, it raised eyebrows worldwide. Yet 
the Vice President, by his account, 
never once asked his son to leave the 
board. We wouldn’t be sitting here if he 
did. He never asked his son to leave the 
board. Instead, he started investigating 
the prosecutor who was going after 
Burisma and this corrupt oligarch, who 
they say was corrupt even by oligarch 
standards, who had fled the country— 
fled the country—and was living in 
Monaco. 
He does not ask him to leave the 
board. He does the opposite. 
In 2015, what does he do? We know by 
reports he has close contact with Presi-
dent 
Poroshenko. 
He 
travels 
to 
Ukraine twice. He links it to the—he 
links their aid to the firing. 
Same thing in 2016 at a White House 
meeting—links the aid to the firing of 
the prosecutor; calls him four times in 
the 8 days up—leading to the pros-
ecutor—the prosecutor investigating 
Hunter Biden. Yet he never says that. 
All cases closed. 
Days before Biden leaves office, he 
jokes to Poroshenko that he may have 
to call him every couple weeks to 
check in. Hunter Biden stays on that 
board for 3 years—3 years. 
Then we hear the video of Joe Biden 
bragging about firing the prosecutor, 
linking it to aid. Then we have a 6- 
minute phone call. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sorry. 
The House managers have 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice and to our Senators, Senators, 
thank you so much for that question. I 
know you have asked about a conversa-
tion between a father and his son, and 
what I can tell you, probably like just 
about everybody in this Chamber, 
there are probably some conversations 
that I can’t repeat to you about my 
conversations with my son. So I don’t 
know the answer to your question, Sen-
ator, what that exact conversation 
was. 
But what I can tell you is this: If we 
are serious about why we are here—and 
I have no reason to doubt that we are— 
we are serious about seeking the truth 
because the truth matters, not just for 
those who have paid the price in our 
history to form a more perfect union 
and protect our democracy, but it is 
important for our future. And in this 
case, if we are serious about that, then 
I can tell you this: that we are serious, 
then, about hearing from fact wit-
nesses. 
Looking at the Bidens, no matter 
how many times we call their name, we 
have no evidence to point to the fact 
that either Biden has anything at all 
to tell us about the President shaking 
down a foreign power to help him cheat 
in the next election—the President’s 
election trying to steal each individual 
in this country’s vote. 
I don’t believe either Biden has any 
information about that, but let me tell 
you who I think does. Maybe we should 
call Ambassador Bolton. If we are seri-
ous about the truth, maybe we should 
call him because we have a good idea 
about what he might say. Or what 
about Mr. Mulvaney, who had day-to- 
day contact with the principal in our 
investigation—the President of the 
United States. 
That is not good enough? Well, what 
about—the question was asked about 
when did we know—or when did the 
President first put the hold on. Well, 
we do have reports that say on June 19 
of 2019, Mr. Blair personally instructed 
the Director of OMB to hold up secu-
rity assistance from Ukraine—over a 
month before the infamous July 25 call. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator ROSEN is 
addressed to the House managers: 
Over the course of your arguments, you 
have tried to make a case that the President 
put his personal interests over those of the 
Nation, risking our national security in the 
process. What precedent do you believe the 
President’s actions set for future Presidents? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for that ques-
tion. It is one that I have wanted to an-
swer for some time now. 
You have heard me speak before 
about some of my personal experience 
in service to the country, and one 
thing that experience has taught me is 
that we are strong not just because of 
the service and the sacrifice of our men 
and women in uniform, which is ex-
treme and pure in all of its sense and 
something that I think everybody in 
this Chamber actually appreciates and 
respects, but we are also strong be-
cause we have friends. We are strong 
because America doesn’t go it alone. 
You know, when I was in Iraq and Af-
ghanistan, I worked frequently with 
Afghan Army partners, Iraqi Army 
partners and others, not because it was 
important but because it was essential. 
We couldn’t accomplish the mission 
without it. But if those partners feel 
like our policies—what we say pub-
licly—don’t matter; if they feel like we 
are not a reliable and predictable part-
ner; if they feel like the American 
handshake isn’t worth anything, then 
they will not stand by us. They will not 
stand by us. 
For over 70 years, since the end of 
World War II, the partnerships, the al-
liances that we have built, that we 
have strived to create, that have ush-
ered in an unprecedented period of 
peace and prosperity throughout the 
world, will start to fray because the 
American handshake will not matter. 
Ukraine has started to learn that. 
Our 68,000 troops throughout Europe 
deserve better because every day, they 
get up and they do their job—the job 
we have asked them to do—and they 
rely on our consistency, our predict-
ability. They rely on the interest being 
in the national interest, not the whims 
and the personal interest of the Presi-
dent, whether that be President Trump 
or any other President. 
It will continue to call into question 
our broader alliances, and it will send a 
message that the American handshake 
doesn’t matter. 
We have a slide that shows the evo-
lution of some of the different argu-
ments that we have seen on the other 
side that I think is important to see. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
President TRUMP. Russia, if you are lis-
tening, I hope you are able to find the 30,000 
emails that are missing. I think you will 
probably be rewarded mightily by our press. 
Let’s see if that happens. 
Mr. STEPHANOPOULOS. The campaign 
this time around, if foreigners, if Russia and 
China, if someone else offers information on 
an opponent, should they accept it or should 
they call the FBI? 
President TRUMP. I think maybe they do 
both. I think you might want to listen. 
There is nothing wrong with listening. If 
somebody called from a country—Norway: 
We have information on your opponent—I 
think I would want to hear it. 
Mr. STEPHANOPOULOS. You want that 
kind of interference in our elections? 
President TRUMP. It’s not an interference. 
They have information. I think I would take 
it. 
Unidentified SPEAKER. Let’s move to the 
third excerpt there related to Vice President 
Biden, and it says, ‘‘The other thing, there’s 
a lot of talk about Biden’s son—’’ this is 
President 
Trump 
speaking—‘‘that 
Biden 
stopped the prosecution and a lot of people 
want to find out about that so that whatever 
you can do with the Attorney General would 
be great. Biden went around bragging that 
he stopped the prosecution so if you can look 
into it . . . It sounds horrible to me.’’ 
President TRUMP. Well, I would think 
that if they were honest about it, they’d 
start a major investigation into the Bidens. 
It’s a very simple answer. 
President TRUMP. If we feel there is cor-
ruption, like I feel there was in the 2016 cam-
paign, there was tremendous corruption 
against me—if we feel there’s corruption, we 
have a right to go to a foreign country. 
President TRUMP. And by the way, like-
wise, China should start an investigation 
into the Bidens because what happened in 
China is just about as bad as what happened 
with—with Ukraine. 
Mr. Manager CROW. The American 
people deserve to know what happened.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S698 
January 30, 2020 
The American people deserve to know 
when they go to bed tonight that there 
is a President that has their interests 
in mind, that will put the national se-
curity of the country above his own po-
litical self-interest. The American peo-
ple deserve answers. And, yes, it is still 
a good time to call Ambassador Bolton 
to testify. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. PORTMAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself, 
Senators 
TOOMEY, 
CORNYN, 
CRAPO, ERNST, and MORAN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator PORTMAN 
and the other Senators is for the coun-
sel for the President: 
I have been surprised to hear the House 
managers repeatedly invoke constitutional 
law Professor Jonathan Turley to support 
their position, including playing a part of a 
video of him. Isn’t it true that Professor 
Turley opposed this impeachment in the 
House and has also said that abuse of power 
is exceedingly difficult to prove alone with-
out an accompanying criminal allegation, 
abuse of power has never been the sole basis 
for a presidential impeachment and was not 
proven in this case? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
And that is exactly correct. Professor 
Turley was very critical of the entire 
process in the House and of the charges 
that the House—House Democrats were 
considering here, both the abuse of 
power 
charge 
and 
the 
obstruction 
charge. He explained that this was a 
rushed process; they did not adequately 
pursue an investigation; that, as the 
Senators point out in the question, 
abuse of power is an exceedingly dif-
ficult theory to use to impeach a Presi-
dent, and it has never been used with-
out alleging violations of the law. I 
think that in the discussions we have 
had over the past week and a half, we 
have pointed that out multiple times. 
Every Presidential impeachment in 
our history, including even the Nixon 
impeachment proceedings, which didn’t 
actually lead to impeachment, have 
used charges that include specific vio-
lations of the law and the criminal law. 
Andrew Johnson was charged mostly 
in counts that involved violation of the 
Tenure of Office Act, which Congress 
had specifically made punishable by 
fine and imprisonment and even wrote 
into the statute that violation would 
constitute either a high crime or a 
high 
misdemeanor—one 
of 
those 
terms—to make it clear that it was 
going to be used to trigger an impeach-
ment. 
In the proceedings in the Nixon im-
peachment inquiry, each of the Arti-
cles of Impeachment there—except for 
the obstruction of Congress charge is 
sort of treated separately on the ob-
struction theory—included specific vio-
lations of law. There were specific vio-
lations alleged in the second Article of 
Impeachment, which is often sort of re-
ferred to loosely as the abuse of power 
article. It wasn’t actually entitled 
‘‘abuse of power.’’ It didn’t charge 
abuse of power. The specifications 
there were violations of the law—vio-
lating the constitutional rights of the 
citizens, violating the laws governing 
executive branch agencies, unlawful 
electronic surveillance, using the CIA 
and others. Specific violations of law. 
Clearly, in the Clinton impeachment, 
President Clinton was impeached for 
perjury and obstruction of justice. 
Those are crimes. 
While Professor Turley does not take 
the view that a crime is necessarily re-
quired, he pointed out here that there 
was not nearly a sufficient basis and 
not nearly a sufficient record compiled 
in the House of Representatives to jus-
tify an abuse of power charge. 
He also was very critical of the ob-
struction of Congress theory, and he 
pointed out that it would be an abuse 
of power by Congress under these cir-
cumstances where Congress has simply 
demanded information, gotten a re-
fusal from the executive branch based 
on constitutionally based prerogatives 
of the executive or refusal to provide 
that information, then to simply go 
straight to impeachment without going 
through the accommodations process, 
without considering contempt, without 
going to the courts. That is Professor 
Turley’s view on how incrementally 
the House of Representatives would 
have to proceed if they were going to 
try to reach ultimately some theory of 
obstruction of Congress. 
So to cite Professor Turley, it is 
true, in his academic writing and in his 
testimony, he did not adopt the view 
that you must have a crime and only a 
crime as the charge for an Article of 
Impeachment. He still thought that 
neither of the Articles of Impeachment 
here could be justified or sufficient or 
could be used to impeach the Presi-
dent—both the abuse of power article 
and the obstruction article. So taking 
snippets out of what he said really does 
an injustice to the totality of his testi-
mony, because the totality of his testi-
mony was entirely against what the 
House ended up doing. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Chief Justice, on 
behalf of Senator WYDEN and myself, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senators BROWN and WYDEN ask the 
following question to the House man-
agers: 
During yesterday’s proceedings, the Presi-
dent’s counsel failed to give an adequate re-
sponse to a question related to whether ac-
ceptance of information provided by a for-
eign country to a political campaign or can-
didate would constitute a violation of the 
law and whether offers of such information 
should be reported to the FBI. FBI Director 
Christopher Wray, who was appointed by 
President Trump, has said ‘‘if any public of-
ficial or member of any campaign is con-
tacted by any nation-state about influencing 
or interfering with our election, then that 
[is] something that the FBI would want to 
know about,’’ and ‘‘we’d like to make sure 
people tell us information promptly so that 
we can take appropriate steps to protect the 
American people.’’ If President Trump re-
mains in office, what signal does that send to 
other countries intent on interfering in our 
elections in the future, and what might we 
expect from those countries and the Presi-
dent? 
Mr. Counsel JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, thank you for that question. 
I will take the last part first. It 
would send a terrible message to auto-
crats and dictators and enemies of de-
mocracy and the free world for the 
President and his team to essentially 
put out there for all to consume that it 
is acceptable in the United States to 
solicit foreign interference in our free 
and fair elections or accept political 
dirt simply to try to cheat in the next 
election. 
I was certainly shocked by the com-
ments from the President’s Deputy 
White House Counsel yesterday, right 
here on the floor, when he said: ‘‘I 
think that the idea that any informa-
tion that happens to come from over-
seas is necessarily campaign inter-
ference is a mistake.’’ 
No. It is wrong. It is wrong in the 
United States of America. 
He also added ‘‘Information that is 
credible, that potentially shows wrong-
doing by someone that happens to be 
running for office, if it’s credible infor-
mation, is relevant information for the 
voters to know . . . to be able to decide 
on who is the best candidate. . . . ’’ 
This is not a banana republic. It is 
the democratic Republic of the United 
States of America. It is wrong. 
The single most important lesson 
that we learned from 2016 was that no-
body should seek or welcome foreign 
interference in our elections. But now 
we have this President and his counsel 
essentially saying it is OK. 
It is not OK. It strikes at the very 
heart of what the Framers of the Con-
stitution were concerned about—abuse 
of power, betrayal by the President of 
his oath of office, corrupting the integ-
rity of our democracy and our free and 
fair elections by entangling oneself 
with foreign powers. That is at the 
heart of what the Framers of the Con-
stitution were concerned about. 
Don’t just trust me. We have several 
folks who have made this observation. 
The FBI Director—the Trump FBI Di-
rector—said that the FBI would want 
to know about any attempt at foreign 
election interference. 
The Chair of the Federal Elections 
Commission also issued a statement re-
iterating the view of U.S. law enforce-
ment. She said in part: 
Let me make something 100 percent clear 
to the American public and anyone running 
for [public] office: It is illegal for any person 
to solicit, accept, or receive anything of 
value from a foreign national in connection 
with a U.S. election. 
This is not a novel concept. Election 
intervention from foreign governments

has been considered unacceptable since 
the beginning of our Nation. It is 
wrong, it is corrupt, it is lawless, it is 
an abuse of power, it is impeachable, 
and it should lead to the removal of 
President Donald John Trump. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself and on be-
half of Senator LEE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators HAWLEY 
and LEE is for counsel to the President: 
The U.S. Federal Courts have held, most 
prominently in the Blagojevich case, that it 
is not unlawful for a public official to condi-
tion his official acts on official acts per-
formed by another public officer. Is there 
any application to the allegations against 
President Trump? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
I think an important threshold point 
to make here is that we are not even in 
the realm of exchanging official acts, 
because there has been no proof of a 
quid pro quo here. We are not in the 
realm of a situation where there is one 
official act being traded for another. 
I think that we have gone through 
the evidence that makes it quite clear 
that both, with respect to a meeting 
with the President—a bilateral meet-
ing—and with respect to the temporary 
pause of security assistance, the evi-
dence just doesn’t stack up to show 
that President Trump linked either of 
those. Both took place—the meeting 
and the release of the aid—without 
Ukrainians doing anything, announc-
ing or beginning any investigations. 
There is nothing in the transcript link-
ing them to a quid pro quo. The 
Ukrainians didn’t even know that 
there had been a temporary pause on 
the aid, and I could go on with a list of 
points on that. 
I think if there were any application 
hypothetically, it would come in the 
realm of the fact that in foreign policy 
there are situations where there can be 
situations 
where 
one 
government 
wants some action from another and 
wants that action from another in a 
way that would condition other poli-
cies of one country. 
You can say: We would like you—and 
this happens. For example, with the 
Northern Triangle countries: We want 
you to do more to stop the flow of ille-
gal immigration. We are going to be 
conditioning some of our policies to-
ward you, unless and until you do a 
better job stopping the flow of illegal 
immigration. It is a real problem on 
our southern border. 
That happens all the time, and when 
there is something legitimate to look 
into, there could be a situation where 
the United States would say: You’ve 
got to do better on corruption. You’ve 
got to do better on these specific areas 
of corruption, or we are not going to be 
able to keep the same relationship with 
you. 
One example like that, I believe it 
was pointed out that aid was held up to 
Afghanistan. President Trump held up 
aid to Afghanistan specifically because 
of concerns about corruption. In situa-
tions like that, there would be nothing 
wrong whatsoever with conditioning 
one policy approach on a foreign coun-
try modifying their policy to be more 
in line, to attune more directly to U.S. 
foreign interests. That is what foreign 
policy is all about. That could arise in 
situations of even calling for investiga-
tions. 
I think it is interesting to point out 
that in May of 2018, three Democratic 
Senators sent a letter to the then-pros-
ecutor in Ukraine suggesting that we 
have heard some things that you might 
not be cooperating with the Mueller in-
vestigation. And there was sort of an 
implicit indication behind the letter 
that there is not going to be as much 
support for Ukraine. This is something 
that is important. You have got to be 
helping with that investigation. 
There is nothing wrong with encour-
aging the prosecutor general to assist 
with 
something 
important 
to 
the 
United States. That is part of foreign 
policy. It happens all the time. So to 
the extent that the Blagojevich case is 
relevant, it is in the general concept 
that were there some linkage between 
‘‘we want your country to pursue these 
policies; it is going to affect our poli-
cies towards you,’’ that is entirely le-
gitimate. That is not something that is 
a violation of any law or is improper. 
Again, coming back to the point here, 
there is no proof of that linkage. There 
no proof of what we have come to call 
‘‘quid pro quo’’ in this case. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator CANTWELL’s question is for 
the House managers: 
In his opening remarks, Chairman SCHIFF 
said the Ukraine scheme was expansive and 
involved many people. Is there any evidence 
that Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick 
Mulvaney, Secretary of State Pompeo, At-
torney General Barr or anyone on the out-
side were involved in this scheme to with-
hold military aid or obstruction of Congress? 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senator, thank you so 
much for that question. 
If 
we 
remember 
Ambassador 
Sondland’s testimony, where he said, 
‘‘everyone was in the loop,’’ we don’t 
just have to take his word for it. Dur-
ing his hearing, Mr. Sondland discussed 
a July 19 email he sent to the Presi-
dent’s top aides, including Secretary 
Mike Pompeo, Acting Chief of Staff 
Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Mulvaney’s senior 
adviser, Robert Blair, Secretary Rick 
Perry, and Brian McCormick, Sec-
retary Perry’s Chief of Staff. 
We should at least start with, if we 
are serious about getting to the truth, 
issuing a subpoena for State Depart-
ment emails. If you pay attention to 
the slide, in the email, Sondland stat-
ed: 
I talked to Zelensky just now. 
He is prepared to receive POTUS’s call. 
Will assure him that he intends to run a 
fully transparent investigation and will 
‘‘turn over every stone’’. He would greatly 
appreciate a call prior to Sunday so that he 
can put out some media about a ‘‘friendly 
and productive call’’ (no details). . . . 
Mr. Mulvaney, in the email, acknowl-
edges receipt and responds shortly: I 
asked the NSC to set up the call for to-
morrow—6 
days 
before 
President 
Trump’s now infamous July 25th call in 
which he told President Zelensky to 
conduct investigations into the Bidens 
and the 2016 election. Mr. Sondland 
sent an email to the President’s top 
aides updating them on the status of 
the scheme. 
Again, ‘‘everyone was in the loop.’’ 
On August 11, Ambassador Sondland 
emailed Mr. Brechbuhl to ask him to 
brief Secretary Pompeo on the state-
ment he was negotiating with Presi-
dent Zelensky with the aim of ‘‘making 
the boss happy’’—the boss being the 
President—enough to authorize the in-
vestigation. 
Ambassador Sondland wrote to Mr. 
Brechbuhl: 
Kurt and I negotiated a statement from 
Z— 
Mr. Zelensky. 
to be delivered for our review in a day or 
two. The content will hopefully make the 
boss happy enough to authorize an invita-
tion. 
And he is talking about the invita-
tion for a White House Oval Office 
meeting, which we know was much 
more critical and important than a 
sideline meeting at the U.N. 
Yet, further evidence that ‘‘everyone 
was in the loop,’’ Attorney General 
Barr reportedly responded at some 
point—there was a New York Times ar-
ticle that was done, and Attorney Gen-
eral Barr responded to that article by 
stating that he was aware of DOJ in-
vestigations into some countries, and 
that 
he 
was 
concerned 
President 
Trump was giving world leaders the 
impression he had undue influence over 
what would ordinarily be independent 
investigations. He cited conversations 
the President had with leaders of Tur-
key and China, further demonstrating 
that there was concern about the 
President abusing the power of his of-
fice for personal, political reasons. 
Again, it proves that everybody was in 
the loop, and we should want to sub-
poena and review those emails involv-
ing the State Department and others.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S700 
January 30, 2020 
On March 6, 2019, Speaker NANCY PELOSI 
said, ‘‘impeachment is so divisive to the 
country that unless there’s something so 
compelling and overwhelming and bipar-
tisan, I don’t think we should go down that 
path because it divides the country.’’ Alex-
ander Hamilton also warned in Federalist 65 
against the ‘‘persecution of an intemperate 
or designing majority in the House of Rep-
resentatives’’ with respect to impeachment. 
In evaluating the case against the President, 
should the Senate take into account the par-
tisan nature of the impeachment proceedings 
in the House? 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of 
the Senate. 
Absolutely you should take that into 
account. That is dispositive. That 
should end it. Based on the statements 
that we heard the last time from our 
friends on the Democratic side, that is 
a reason why you shouldn’t have an im-
peachment. Speaker PELOSI was right 
when she said that. Unfortunately, she 
didn’t follow her own advice. 
We have never been in a situation 
where we have the impeachment of a 
President in an election year with the 
goal of removing the President from 
the ballot. As I have said before, that is 
the most massive election interference 
we have ever witnessed. It is domestic 
election interference; it is political 
election interference; and it is wrong. 
They don’t talk about the horrible 
consequences to our country of doing 
that, but they would be terrible. They 
would tear us apart for generations, 
and the American people wouldn’t ac-
cept it. 
Let me address, in that context, the 
importance of the vote for their in-
quiry, which also had bipartisan oppo-
sition. Now they said: Well, we were 
fine when Speaker PELOSI announced 
it. We didn’t need a vote. The sub-
poenas were authorized. 
Then why did they have a vote? They 
had a vote because they understood 
they had a big problem that they need-
ed to fix. But what is more important 
about the vote than the procedural 
issue? The important thing about the 
vote is that if you are going to start an 
impeachment investigation, particu-
larly in an election year, there needs to 
be 
political 
accountability 
to 
the 
American people. You can’t just go 
have a press conference. If you are 
going to say that the votes of the 
American people need to be disallowed 
and that all of the ballots need to be 
torn up, then at the very least you 
need to be accountable to your home 
district for that decision, and now they 
are—and now they are. 
If the American people decide—if 
they are allowed to vote—if the Amer-
ican people decide that they don’t like 
what has happened here; that they 
don’t like the constitutional violations 
that have happened; that they don’t 
like the attack on a successful Presi-
dent for purely partisan political pur-
poses, then they can do something 
about it, and they can throw them out. 
That is why a vote is important. 
We should never even consider re-
moving the name of a President from a 
ballot on a purely partisan basis in an 
election year. Important? I will say it 
is important. For that reason alone 
and for the interest of uniting our 
country, it must be rejected. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. REED. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk on behalf of Sen-
ators DUCKWORTH and HARRIS and my-
self for the House managers and for the 
President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator REED and 
the other Senators is for both parties, 
beginning with the House managers: 
It has been reported that President Trump 
has not paid Rudy Giuliani, his personal at-
torney, for his services. Can you explain who 
has paid for Rudy Giuliani’s legal fees, inter-
national travel, and other expenses in his ca-
pacity as President Trump’s attorney and 
representative? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. A short answer 
to the question is, I don’t know who is 
paying Rudy Giuliani’s fees, and if he 
is not being paid by the President to 
conduct this domestic political errand 
for which he has devoted so much time, 
if other clients are paying and sub-
sidizing his work in that respect, it 
raises profound questions—questions 
that we can’t answer at this point. 
There are some answers that we do 
know. As he has acknowledged, he is 
not there to inform policy. So when 
counsel for the President says this is a 
policy dispute and you can’t impeach a 
President 
over 
policy, 
what 
Rudy 
Giuliani was engaged in, by his own ad-
mission, has nothing to do with pol-
icy—has nothing to do with policy. 
And let me mention one other thing 
about this scheme that Giuliani was 
orchestrating and the consequence of 
the argument that they would make 
that quid pro quos are just fine. Let’s 
say Rudy Giuliani does another errand 
for the President—this time an errand 
in China—and he says to the Chinese: 
We will give you a favorable deal with 
respect to Chinese farmers as opposed 
to American farmers. We will betray 
the American farmer in the trade deal, 
but here is what we want. The quid pro 
quo is we want you to do an investiga-
tion of the Bidens. You know the one, 
the one the President has been calling 
for. They would say that is OK. They 
would say that is a quid pro quo to help 
his reelection. He can betray the Amer-
ican farmer; that is OK. That is their 
argument. Where does that argument 
lead us? That is exactly the kind of do-
mestic, corrupt, political errand that 
Rudy Giuliani was doing gratis, with-
out payment—at least not payment, 
apparently, from the President. 
So who is paying the freight for it? I 
don’t know who is directly paying the 
freight for it, but I can tell you the 
whole country is paying the freight for 
it because there are leaders around the 
world who are watching this, and they 
are saying the American Presidency is 
open for business. This President wants 
our help, and if we help him, he will be 
grateful. 
He will be grateful. Is that the kind 
of message we want to send to the rest 
of the world? That is the result of nor-
malizing lawlessness of the kind that 
Rudy Giuliani was engaged in. 
One other thing, if I have—my time 
is not expired. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sorry; 
your time is expired. Counsel. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Members of the Senate, it 
is hard for me to believe the words that 
just came out of the manager’s mouth: 
‘‘open for business.’’ I will tell you who 
was open for business. You know who 
was open for business? The Vice Presi-
dent of the United States was charged 
by the then-President of the United 
States with developing policies to 
avoid and assist in removing corrup-
tion from Ukraine, and his son was on 
the board of a company that was under 
investigation for Ukraine, and you are 
concerned about what Rudy Giuliani, 
the President’s lawyer, was doing when 
he was over trying to determine what 
was going on in Ukraine? 
And by the way, it is a little bit in-
teresting to me—and my colleague, the 
Deputy White House Counsel referred 
to this. It is a little bit ironic to me 
that you are going to be questioning 
conversations 
with 
foreign 
govern-
ments about investigations when three 
of you—three Members of the Senate— 
Senator MENENDEZ, Senator LEAHY, 
and Senator DURBIN sent a letter that 
read 
something—quickly—like 
this. 
They wrote the letter to the prosecutor 
general of Ukraine. They said they are 
advocates—talking about the Congress-
men—they are ‘‘strong advocates for a 
robust and close relationship with 
Ukraine [and] we believe that our co-
operation . . . extend to such legal 
matters, regardless of politics.’’ And 
their concern was ongoing investiga-
tions and whether the Mueller team 
was getting appropriate—appropriate— 
responses from Ukraine regarding in-
vestigations of what? The President of 
the United States. And you are asking 
about whether foreign investigations 
are appropriate? I think it answers 
itself. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Oklahoma. 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself, Senator ERNST, and Senator 
CRAPO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator LANKFORD 
and the other Senators is for the coun-
sel for the President: 
House managers have described any delay 
in military aid and State Department funds 
to Ukraine in 2019 as a cause to believe there 
was a secret scheme or quid pro quo by the 
President. In 2019, 86% of the DOD funds were

obligated to Ukraine in September, but in 
2018, 67% of the funds were obligated in Sep-
tember and in 2017, 73% of the funds were ob-
ligated in September. In the State Depart-
ment, the funds were obligated September 30 
in 2019, but they were obligated September 28 
in 2018. Each year, the vast majority of the 
funds were obligated in the final month or 
days of the fiscal year. Was there a national 
security risk to Ukraine or the United 
States from the funds going out at the end of 
September in the 2 previous years? Did it 
weaken our relationship with Ukraine be-
cause the vast majority of our aid was re-
leased in September each of the last 3 years? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senators, thank you for that 
question. And the short, straight-
forward answer is there was no jeop-
ardy to the national security interest 
of the United States from the timing of 
the release of this money. As the ques-
tion indicated, the vast bulk of the 
funds in each of the prior 2 fiscal years 
were also obligated in September. So 
the fact that the funds were released 
here on September 11 and obligated by 
the end of the fiscal year was con-
sistent with the timing in past years. 
There was—and it is also the case 
that at the end of every fiscal year, 
there is some funding in this Ukrainian 
military assistance that doesn’t actu-
ally make it out the door. It isn’t obli-
gated by the end of the fiscal year. We 
heard the House managers point to the 
fact that Congress had to put some-
thing in the continuing resolution, a 
special provision, to get $35 million of 
the aid extended so it can be used in 
the next fiscal year. My understanding 
is that every fiscal year there is some 
amount of money. It is not always that 
same 
amount, 
but 
there 
is 
some 
amount of money that that has to be 
done for every year because it doesn’t 
get out the door by the end of the year. 
Now, it is not just from the raw data 
that we can see that the funds went out 
roughly the same timing toward the 
end of the year that, therefore, it 
doesn’t suggest any great risk to 
Ukraine or risk to the national secu-
rity of the United States. We know 
that from testimony as well. 
Ambassador Volker testified that the 
brief pause on the aid was not signifi-
cant, and the Under Secretary of State 
for Political Affairs, David Hale, ex-
plained that this is future assistance, 
and I mentioned this the other day. It 
is not like this money is being spent 
month by month to supply current 
needs in Ukraine. It is 5-year money. 
Once it is obligated, it can go to U.S. 
firms for providing materiel to the 
Ukrainians, and it doesn’t get spent 
down finally and materiel shipped to 
Ukraine for a long time. So a delay of 
48 or 55 days—depending on how you 
count it—and the money being released 
before the end of the fiscal year ends 
up having no real effect. It is not cur-
rent money. It is supplying immediate 
needs. 
Despite what we have heard about 
the idea that on the frontlines in the 
Donbas, Ukrainian soldiers are being 
put at risk, that is just not accurate. 
And we know that also from Oleg 
Shevchuk, the Ukrainian Deputy Min-
ister of Defense, who gave an interview 
to the New York Times and explained 
that the hold came and went so quickly 
that he didn’t even notice any change. 
And, 
remember, 
the 
Ukrainians 
didn’t even know. President Zelensky 
and his advisers—Yermak and others— 
have made it abundantly clear. There 
was another interview just the other 
day with Danylyuk, who—I might get 
his title wrong. I think he was the For-
eign Minister at the time. But there 
was an interview just the other day 
that was published. And he explained, 
again, that they didn’t know the aid 
had been held up until the POLITICO 
article on August 28. And then he said 
there was a panic in Kyiv because they 
were just trying to figure out what to 
do. Well, within 2 weeks, it had been 
released. 
And so we have also heard the idea 
that, well, it was just the fact of the 
delay that gave the Russians a signal, 
and it gave the Ukrainians a signal, 
and that was what the damage to the 
national security was. But the whole 
point is, leaders of the Government in 
Ukraine didn’t know. It wasn’t made 
public. So they weren’t being given a 
signal by that, and the Russians 
weren’t being given a signal by that. 
So that theory for damage to the na-
tional security also doesn’t work. 
There was a pause temporarily so 
that there could be some assessment to 
address concerns the President had 
raised. The money was released by the 
end of the fiscal year. There was no 
damage to the national security either 
in terms of materiel not being avail-
able to the Ukrainians or in terms of 
any signal sent to any foreign power. 
The money got out the door roughly 
the same time as in prior years. A lit-
tle bit more left over at the end that 
had to be fixed, but there is some left 
over at the end every year that has to 
be fixed with a rider on the next appro-
priations bill or continuing resolution. 
So no damage whatsoever to the na-
tional security of the United States. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. ‘‘Aloha.’’ I send a ques-
tion to the desk for the House man-
agers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator HIRONO 
for the House managers reads as fol-
lows: 
In contrast to arguments by the Presi-
dent’s counsel, acting White House Chief of 
Staff Mick Mulvaney stated that President 
Trump held up aid to Ukraine to get his po-
litically-motivated 
investigations. 
He 
claimed: ‘‘We do that all the time with for-
eign policy’’ and ‘‘Get over it.’’ What was dif-
ferent about President Trump’s withholding 
of aid to Ukraine from prior aid freezes? Are 
you aware of any other Presidents who have 
withheld foreign aid as a bribe to extract 
personal benefits? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, 
Senator. 
I will respond to the question, but let 
me begin with something in the cat-
egory of: You can’t make this stuff up. 
Today, while we have been debating 
whether a President can be impeached 
for essentially bogus claims of privi-
lege for attempting to use the courts to 
cover up misconduct, the Justice De-
partment, 
in 
resisting 
House 
sub-
poenas, is in court today and was 
asked: Well, if the Congress can’t come 
to the court to enforce subpoenas be-
cause, as we know, they are in here ar-
guing, Congress must go to court to en-
force its subpoenas, but they are in the 
court saying: Congress, thou shall not 
do that, so the judge says: If the Con-
gress can’t enforce its subpoenas in 
court, then what remedy is there? And 
the Justice Department lawyers’ re-
sponse is impeachment—impeachment. 
You can’t make this up. I mean, what 
more evidence do we need of the bad 
faith of this effort to cover up? 
I said the other day they are in this 
court making this argument; they are 
down the street making the other argu-
ment. I didn’t think they would make 
it on the same day, but that is exactly 
what is going on. 
Now, in response to the question 
about how is this aid different, this 
hold different from other holds, it is 
certainly appropriate to ask that ques-
tion. 
The laws Congress passed authorizing 
this appropriation did not allow for the 
hold by this President. And as the 
GAO—the Government Accountability 
Office—found, it violated the law to 
hold the aid the way it did. 
Once the Department of Defense, in 
consultation with the Department of 
State, certified that Ukraine had met 
the anti-corruption benchmarks re-
quired under the law, there was noth-
ing that would allow for a hold. The 
money had to flow. 
And that was intentional. Military 
assistance to Ukraine is critical to our 
national security. It has overwhelming 
bipartisan support. 
And recall that in the spring of 2019, 
the 
Defense 
Department 
certified 
Ukraine had met all of the anti-corrup-
tion benchmarks. The Department of 
State sent the Senate a letter saying 
that the benchmarks had been met. It 
issued a press release saying that the 
aid was moving forward. It began to 
spend the funds to help Ukraine, but 
then the President stepped in. Without 
legal authority, he secretly had placed 
a hold on the aid. 
Now, the President’s counsel, in their 
presentation, gives specific examples of 
past holds, as if we cannot distinguish 
one for a corrupt reason and one that is 
for a policy reason. 
In many of their examples, the law 
explicitly 
provided 
the 
executive 
branch the authority to pause, reevalu-
ate, or cancel foreign aid programs as 
the situation in a recipient country 
evolved. 
For example, with regard to foreign 
assistance to El Salvador, Honduras, or 
Guatemala, the law explicitly allows

the Secretary of State to ‘‘suspend, in 
whole or in part’’ that ‘‘assistance’’ if 
at any time the Secretary deems ‘‘that 
sufficient progress has not been made 
by a central government.’’ 
On a host of priorities, from respect-
ing human rights to upholding the law, 
those are the priorities that you, the 
Senate, agreed to, and the President 
was required to implement them; simi-
larly, aid to Afghanistan, the subject of 
periodic reevaluations by law. And the 
law explicitly directs the Secretary of 
State should ‘‘suspend assistance for 
the 
Government 
of 
Afghanistan’’ 
should be it assessed that the Afghan 
Government is ‘‘failing to make meas-
urable progress’’ in meeting certain 
anti-corruption, 
human 
rights, 
and 
counterterrorism benchmarks. 
The overthrow of the democratically 
elected Government in Egypt, we have 
had that brought up as another exam-
ple. Members of this body, including 
Senators McCain, LEAHY, and GRAHAM, 
pressed the Obama administration to 
suspend military aid. It wasn’t hidden 
from the Senate. It was urged on the 
administration by the Senate. Senators 
pressed for that aid to be withheld be-
cause the law was clear, in instances of 
a military coup, aid must be suspended. 
Senators McCain and GRAHAM wrote an 
op-ed in the Washington Post: 
Not all coups are created equal, but a coup 
is still a coup. Morsi— 
That is the deposed leader of Egypt. 
was elected by a majority of voters, and U.S. 
law requires the suspension of foreign assist-
ance. 
I could go on and on with examples. 
No one has suggested you can’t condi-
tion aid, but I would hope that we 
would all agree that you can’t condi-
tion aid for a corrupt purpose, to try to 
get a foreign power to cheat in your 
election. 
Now, counsel says that if you decide 
the prosecution has proved that he en-
gaged in this corrupt scheme, if you de-
cide, as impartial jurors, that the Con-
stitution requires his removal from of-
fice, that the public will not accept 
your judgment. I have more confidence 
in the American people. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Arkansas. 
Mr. BOOZMAN. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself, Senators 
COTTON, ERNST, YOUNG, HAWLEY, RISCH, 
FISCHER, and HOEVEN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator BOOZMAN and the other Sen-
ators pose a question to both sides: 
In the House Managers’ opening statement, 
they argue that it is necessary to pursue im-
peachment because ‘‘The President’s mis-
conduct cannot be decided at the ballot box. 
For we cannot be assured that the vote 
would be fairly won.’’ How would acquitting 
the President prevent voters from making an 
informed decision in the 2020 presidential 
election? 
The President’s counsel goes first. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate. 
That is exactly who should decide 
who should be President, the voters. 
All power comes from the people in 
this country. That is why you are here; 
that is why people are elected in the 
House; and that is why the President is 
elected. It is exactly who should decide 
the question, particularly in a case like 
this, where it is purely partisan. 
Here is the other thing, when we are 
talking about impeachment as a polit-
ical weapon, they didn’t tell you what 
they told the court over the holidays 
when they were waiting to deliver the 
Impeachment Articles. They went and 
told the court: They are actually still 
impeaching over there in the House; 
did you know that? They are actually 
still impeaching. 
They are coming here, and they are 
telling you: Please do the work that we 
didn’t do, where we had 2 days in the 
House Judiciary Committee; we had to 
rush delivery for Christmas; and then 
we waited and waited and waited. But 
now we want you to call witnesses that 
we never called; that we didn’t sub-
poena. They want to turn you into an 
investigative body. In the meantime, 
they are saying: By the way, we are 
still doing it over there. We are still 
impeaching. And they want to slow 
down now. They don’t want to speed 
up. They want to slow it down and take 
up the election year and continue this 
political charade. It is all so wrong. It 
is all so wrong. 
Let’s leave it to the people of the 
United States. Let’s trust them. They 
are asking you not to trust them. 
Maybe they don’t trust them. Maybe 
they won’t like the result. We should 
trust them. That is who should decide 
who the President of this country 
should be. It will be a few months from 
now, and they should decide. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, I appreciate the ques-
tion. 
President Trump must be removed 
from office because of his ongoing 
abuse of power. It threatens the integ-
rity of the next election. 
As we saw from the video montage, 
the President has made no bones about 
the fact that he is willing to seek for-
eign intervention to help him cheat in 
the next election. 
Now, counsel for the President says 
the next election is the remedy. It is 
not the remedy when the President is 
trying to seek to cheat in that very 
election. This is why the Founders did 
not put a requirement that a President 
can only be impeached in their first 
term. Indeed, at that time, of course, 
there weren’t term limits on the Presi-
dency. 
If it were the intent of the Framers 
to say that a President can’t be im-
peached in an election year, they would 
have said so. Now, they didn’t for a 
reason, because they were concerned 
about a President who might try to 
cheat in that very election. 
Now, counsel—as I was getting to a 
moment ago—made the argument: If 
you make the decision as impartial ju-
rors that the President has violated 
the Constitution, he has abused his 
power, he should be convicted and re-
moved from office, that the country 
will not accept it. I have more con-
fidence in the American people than 
that. But I will assure you of this: If 
you make the decision that a fair trial 
can be conducted without hearing from 
witnesses, the American people will 
not accept that judgment because the 
American people understand what goes 
into a fair trial, and they understand 
that a fair trial requires both sides to 
have the opportunity to present their 
case. 
We would like to present our case. 
We would like to call our witnesses. We 
would like to rely on more than our ar-
gumentation. 
There are few things about this trial 
that Americans agree on, but one thing 
they are squarely in agreement on— 
well, two. They believe a trial should 
have witness testimony, and they want 
to hear from John Bolton. That is the 
overwhelming consensus of the Amer-
ican people, and it is consistent with 
common sense. 
Let’s give the country a trial they 
can be proud of. Let’s show that at 
least the process worked and that we 
followed the Founders’ intent that a 
trial have witnesses. I don’t think any-
one can quarrel with the fact, when 
you look at the history of this body 
and evidence of impeachment— 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk for the House 
managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator KAINE to 
the House managers: 
If the Senate acquits the President on arti-
cle II, after he violated both the Impound-
ment Control Act and the Whistleblower Act 
to hide the Ukraine scheme from Congress, 
what is to stop President Trump from com-
plete refusal to cooperate with Congress on 
any matter? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, in short, the consequence is there 
is no constraint on this President or 
any other. This gets to a point—you 
have heard counsel for the President 
repeat over and over: Can you be im-
peached for asserting privileges—and, I 
would add, no matter how bogus or in 
bad faith those assertions may be, no 
matter whether they are in court today 
arguing the opposite of what they are 
arguing before you today? 
And the answer is, yes, the President 
can be impeached for using the asser-
tion of baseless claims to cover up his 
misconduct. 
The House did not impeach the Presi-
dent over a single assertion of privi-
lege. We impeached him for a far more 
fundamental reason: because he issued 
an order categorically directing the ex-
ecutive branch to defy every single

January 30, 2020 
part of every single subpoena served by 
the House. 
A President who issues orders like 
this is a President who can place him-
self above the law and a system of 
checks and balances. He can do what-
ever he wants and get away with it by 
using his powers to orchestrate a mas-
sive coverup. The President’s lawyers 
haven’t disputed that point. They 
can’t. It is obvious that a President 
who ignores and can ignore all over-
sight is a threat to the American peo-
ple. 
Instead, they have argued assertion 
of a grab bag of legal privileges war-
ranting 
this 
categorical 
defiance. 
These arguments are unprecedented 
and wrong. 
The first thing to note is the Presi-
dent’s arguments conveniently ignore 
the October 8 letter sent at the Presi-
dent’s behest declaring that the Presi-
dent will not ‘‘participate’’ in the im-
peachment investigation. 
I will not participate. This blanket 
defiance preceded all of the other let-
ters and creative OLC opinions the 
President relied upon. It made clear 
that the rationale for blanket defiance 
was the President’s belief that he can 
declare his own innocence and make it 
illegitimate to investigate him. This 
was not about privileges or legal argu-
ments. Those came later, as his law-
yers rushed to justify that Congress 
has no power whatsoever to enforce 
subpoenas against anyone. 
Let’s be clear. They may claim that 
their October 8 letter where they said 
they will not participate was somehow 
an offer to accommodate, but what the 
real condition was, was that the House 
simply drop the impeachment inves-
tigation or place the President in 
charge of its direction. That wasn’t a 
real offer. That was a poison pill. 
Now, what about the remaining argu-
ments? The first point is that none of 
them justify his order to defy all the 
subpoenas. He never asserted executive 
privilege over any documents, and his 
remaining arguments that absolute im-
munity or agency counsel not being al-
lowed to attend depositions have noth-
ing to do with documents—nothing. So 
none of his legal arguments even ap-
plies to his direction that every single 
office and agency defy every single sub-
poena for documents. 
And what about the total obstruction 
of the witnesses? Here, too, he never 
invoked executive privilege. Absolute 
immunity obviously couldn’t apply to 
many of the lower level officials we 
subpoenaed. 
The only remaining legal ground for 
defiance was the argument it is uncon-
stitutional for Congress to prevent 
agency counsel from going to deposi-
tions—the 
fallback 
of 
fallback 
of 
fallbacks—except this rule was origi-
nally passed by a Republican Congress 
and has been used repeatedly by both 
Republican- and Democratic-led ma-
jorities and committees. It can’t pos-
sibly justify obstruction of witness 
subpoenas. It is nothing more than a 
phony cover for an obstruction that 
President Trump decided upon at the 
outset. 
These arguments are, thus, incorrect 
on their own terms and fail to explain 
this categorical order. 
One final irony, even before the argu-
ment in court today: At a recent oral 
argument in the DC Circuit, they made 
the same claim they made today. Let’s 
pull up slide 56. In litigation, again, to 
enforce subpoenas, the judge said they 
can make it grounds for impeachment 
for obstruction of Congress. And the 
President’s own lawyers said impeach-
ment is certainly one of the tools that 
Congress has. We agree; it is one of the 
tools that you have for when a Presi-
dent would use a categorical obstruc-
tion of investigation into his own 
wrongdoing. 
It is a tool that should be applied 
here. There cannot be a better case for 
impeachment on obstructing a coequal 
branch of Congress than the one before 
you where the obstruction is so com-
plete and so categorical. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, I send a question to the desk on 
behalf of myself and Senator BRAUN, 
and it is to the President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators SCOTT of 
Florida and BRAUN for counsel for the 
President: 
If 
Speaker 
PELOSI, 
Chairman 
SCHIFF, 
Chairman NADLER, and House Democrats 
were so confident in the gravity of the Presi-
dent’s conduct and the ‘‘overwhelming evi-
dence’’ of an impeachable offense that 
prompted the inquiry, why were the House 
Republicans denied the procedural accom-
modations and substantive rights afforded to 
the minority party in the Clinton impeach-
ment? Additionally, why were the Presi-
dent’s counsel and agency attorneys denied 
access to cross-examine witnesses during 
committee testimony and present the testi-
mony of witnesses in defense of the issues 
under review? 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate. I don’t know why they would 
do that. I don’t know. They violated 
every past precedent. They violated all 
forms of due process. 
Now, they say that is a process argu-
ment, and it is, but it is more than 
that. It is more than that. If you feel 
confident in your facts, then why do 
you design a process that completely 
shuts out the President? Why do you 
cook up the facts in a basement SCIF 
instead of in the light of day? Why do 
you do that? 
Why don’t you allow the minority to 
call witnesses, as they have had the 
right to do in all past impeachments? 
And then they come here and say: By 
the way, we were fully in charge, so 
completely in charge that we locked 
out the President’s counsel, denied all 
rights, denied the minority any wit-
nesses at all. But when we come here, 
they don’t—they still don’t get wit-
nesses. They want you not only to do 
their job but to make the same mis-
take, the same violation of due process, 
that they did. They said: Well, let’s 
just pick the witnesses that we want. 
The other ones are irrelevant—not rel-
evant. 
In listening to Mr. SCHIFF over these 
months, I have come to a determina-
tion about what he means by ‘‘irrele-
vant.’’ He means bad for them, OK. He 
means witnesses that the President 
wants to call. So I don’t know why 
they did that. 
I will say something else. I will say 
something else. I have respect for you, 
and I have respect for the House. And 
when I first got this job, I went—one of 
the first things I did is I went to visit 
Mr. SCHIFF, Chairman SCHIFF. I went to 
visit Chairman NADLER. I went to visit 
Chairman Cummings at that time. And 
I said: We are here to work with you, to 
cooperate where we can, but in the in-
stitutional interest, obviously. We will 
participate in oversight, but if we have 
constitutional points to make, we will 
make them and we will make them di-
rectly. 
And the administration has partici-
pated in oversight. Many, many wit-
nesses have testified in oversight hear-
ings. A large number of documents 
have been produced in oversight hear-
ings. 
And in fact, in the letter that I sent 
on October 8, I made the same offer. I 
said: Look, this is not really a valid 
impeachment proceeding, for all of the 
reasons that we have stated, but if the 
committees wish to return to the reg-
ular order of oversight requests, we 
stand ready to engage in that process. 
But that never happened. 
So I respect Congress. The adminis-
tration respects Congress, but we re-
spect the Constitution. We respect the 
Constitution, too, and we have an obli-
gation to the executive branch and to 
the future Presidency—future Presi-
dents—to vindicate the Constitution 
and vindicate those rights. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House floor managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator WYDEN for 
the House managers: 
The Intelligence Community is prohibited 
from requesting that a foreign entity target 
an American citizen when the Intelligence 
Community is itself prohibited from doing 
so. In 2017, during [Director] Mike Pompeo’s 
confirmation hearing to be the Director of 
the Central Intelligence Agency, he testified 
that ‘‘it is not lawful to outsource that 
which we cannot do.’’ So when President 
Trump asked a foreign country to inves-
tigate an American when the U.S. govern-
ment had not established a legal predicate to 
do so, how is that not an abuse of power? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. It is abso-
lutely an abuse of power. And what is 
more, if you believe that a President 
can essentially engage in any corrupt 
activity as long as he believes that it 
will assist his reelection campaign and

January 30, 2020 
that campaign is in the public interest, 
then what is to stop a President from 
tasking his intelligence agencies to do 
political investigations? What is to 
stop him from tasking the Justice De-
partment? If it can come up with some 
credible or incredible claim that his 
opponent deserves to be investigated, 
their argument would lead you to the 
conclusion that he has every right to 
do that, to use the intelligence agen-
cies or the Justice Department to in-
vestigate a rival. And when they be-
come a rival, it is even more justified. 
But you are absolutely right. If Sec-
retary Pompeo was correct and you 
can’t use your own intelligence agen-
cies, you sure shouldn’t be able to use 
the Russian ones or the Ukrainian 
ones. 
And here we have the President on 
that phone call pushing out this Rus-
sian propaganda, this Russian intel-
ligence 
service 
propaganda— 
CrowdStrike, the server, as if there was 
just one server and it was whisked 
away 
to 
Ukraine; 
the 
Ukrainians 
hacked the server and not the Rus-
sians. A made-for-you-in-the-Kremlin 
conspiracy theory that undermines our 
own intelligence agencies but suits the 
political interests of the President. 
And his legal agent, Rudy Giuliani, is 
out there peddling this fiction. The 
President himself is out there pro-
moting this fiction, standing side by 
side with Vladimir Putin. 
But you are absolutely right. It 
would be a monumental abuse of 
power, and it is a monumental abuse of 
power. And if you don’t think abuse of 
power is impeachable, well, don’t take 
my word for it. Don’t take, earlier, 
Professor Dershowitz’ word for it or 
Jonathan Turley’s word for it. Let’s 
look to our Attorney General. This is 
what he said: ‘‘Under the Framers’ 
plan, the determination whether the 
President is making decisions based on 
improper 
motives’’—something 
that 
Professor Dershowitz says we are not 
allowed to consider—‘‘based on ‘im-
proper’ motives or whether he is ‘faith-
fully’ discharging his responsibilities is 
left to the People, through the election 
process, and the Congress, through the 
Impeachment process. . . . The fact 
that [the] President is answerable for 
any abuses of discretion and is ulti-
mately subject to the judgment of Con-
gress through the impeachment process 
means that the President is not the 
judge in his own cause.’’ 
Their own Attorney General doesn’t 
agree with their theory of the case. But 
again, we don’t have to rely on Bill 
Barr’s opinion or Alan Dershowitz’ 
opinion or my opinion or the consensus 
of constitutional scholars everywhere; 
we can rely on our common sense. The 
conclusion that a President can abuse 
his power by corruptly entering into a 
quid pro quo to get a foreign intel-
ligence service or a foreign government 
or foreign leader to do their political 
dirty work and help them cheat in the 
election—our common sense tells us 
that cannot be compatible with the Of-
fice of the Presidency. 
If we say it is, if we say it is beyond 
the reach of the impeachment power, 
or we engage in this sophistry and we 
say: Because you put it under the ru-
bric of abuse of power—even though 
that was the Framers’ core offense— 
and you didn’t put it under some other 
rubric, well, we won’t even consider 
it—if we are going to engage in that 
kind of legal sophistry, it leaves the 
country completely unprotected from a 
President who would abuse his power 
in this way. That cannot be what the 
Framers had in mind. 
The Constitution is not a suicide 
pact. It does not require us to sur-
render our common sense. Our common 
sense, as well as our morality, tells us 
what the President did was wrong. 
When a President sacrifices the na-
tional security interests of the coun-
try, it is not only wrong, but it is dan-
gerous. When a President says, as we 
saw just a moment ago, over and over 
again, he will continue to do it if left 
in office, it is dangerous. The Framers 
provided a remedy, and we urge you to 
use it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. I ask to send a question 
to the desk on my behalf and Senator 
BARRASSO’s for the President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators BRAUN 
and BARRASSO for counsel for the Presi-
dent: 
The House Managers have said the country 
must be saved from this President, and he 
does not have the best interests of the Amer-
ican people and their families in mind. Do 
you wish to respond to that claim? 
Mr. 
Counsel 
HERSCHMANN. 
Mr. 
Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, 
while the House managers are coming 
before you and accusing the President 
of doing things, in their words, solely 
for personal and political gain and 
claiming that he is not doing things in 
the best interests of the American peo-
ple, the American people are telling 
you just the opposite. 
The President’s approval ratings, 
while we are sitting here in the middle 
of 
these 
impeachment 
proceedings, 
have hit an alltime high. A recent poll 
shows that the American people are 
the happiest they have been with the 
direction of the country in 15 years. 
Whether it is the economy, security, 
military preparedness, safer streets, or 
safer neighborhoods, they are all way 
up. We, the American people, are 
happier. Yet the House managers tell 
you that the President needs to be re-
moved because he is an immediate 
threat to our country. 
Listen to the words that they just 
said: We—we, the American people— 
cannot decide who should be our Presi-
dent because, as they tell us—and these 
are their words—‘‘we cannot be assured 
that the vote will be fairly won.’’ Do 
you really, really believe that? Do you 
really think so little of the American 
people? We don’t. We trust the Amer-
ican people to decide who should be our 
President. Candidly, it is crazy to 
think otherwise. 
What is really going on? What is real-
ly going on is that he is a threat to 
them, and he is an immediate, legiti-
mate threat to them, and he is an im-
mediate, legitimate threat to their 
candidates because the election is only 
8 months away. 
Let’s talk about some of the things 
the President has done. We have re-
placed NAFTA with the historic MCA. 
We have killed a terrorist—al-Baghdadi 
and Soleimani. We secured $738 billion 
to rebuild the military. There have 
been more than 7 million jobs created 
since the election. Illegal border cross-
ings are down 78 percent since May, 
and 100 miles of the wall have been 
built. The unemployment rate is the 
lowest in 50 years. More Americans— 
nearly 160 million—are employed than 
ever before. The African-American un-
employment, the Hispanic-American 
unemployment, 
the 
Asian-American 
unemployment has the lowest rate ever 
recorded. Women’s unemployment re-
cently hit the lowest rate in more than 
65 years. Every U.S. metropolitan area 
saw per capita growth in 2018. Real 
wages have gone up by 8 percent for the 
low-income 
workers. 
Real 
median 
household income is now the highest 
level ever recorded. Forty million 
fewer people live in households receiv-
ing government assistance. We signed 
the biggest package of tax cuts and re-
forms in history. Since then, over $1 
trillion has poured back into the 
United States. Six hundred and fifty 
thousand single mothers have been lift-
ed out of poverty. We secured the larg-
est ever increase for childcare funding, 
helping more than 800,000 low-income 
families access high-quality, affordable 
care. We passed, as Manager JEFFRIES 
will recall, bipartisan criminal justice 
reform. Prescription drugs have re-
ceived the largest price decrease in 
over half a century. Drug overdose 
deaths fell nationwide in 2018 for the 
first time in nearly 30 years. 
The Gallup poll from just 3 days ago 
says that President Trump’s upbeat 
view of the Nation’s economy, military 
strength, economic opportunity, and 
overall quality of life will likely reso-
nate with Americans when he delivers 
the State of the Union Address to Con-
gress next week. 
If all that is solely—solely, in their 
words—for his personal and political 
gain and not in the best interests of 
the American people, then I say: God 
bless him. Keep doing it. Keep doing it. 
Keep doing it. 
Maybe if the House managers stop 
opposing him and harassing him and 
harassing everyone associated with 
him, with the constant letters and the 
constant investigations, maybe we can 
even get more done. 
Let’s try something different now. 
Join us. Join us. One Nation. One Na-
tion. One people. Enough is enough. 
Stop all of this.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S705 
January 30, 2020 
Thank you. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Thank you. I send a 
question to the desk from myself and 
Senator SCHATZ and Senator MENEN-
DEZ. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators BENNET, 
MENENDEZ, and SCHATZ is to the House 
managers: 
If the Senate accepts the President’s blan-
ket assertion of privilege in the House im-
peachment 
inquiry, 
what 
are 
the 
con-
sequences to the American people? How will 
the Senate ensure that the current president 
or a future president will remain transparent 
and accountable? How will this affect the 
separation of powers? And, in this context, 
could you address the President’s counsel’s 
claim that the President’s advisers are enti-
tled to the same protections as a whistle-
blower? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, privi-
leges are limited. We have voted to im-
peach the President for, among other 
things—article II of the impeachment 
is total defiance of House subpoenas. 
And the President announced it in 
advance: I will defy all the subpoenas. 
What does this mean? It means that 
there is no information to Congress. It 
means the claim of monarchical, dic-
tatorial power. If Congress has no in-
formation, it cannot act. If the Presi-
dent can define—now, he can dispute 
certain specific claims. You can claim 
privilege, et cetera. But to defy cat-
egorically all subpoenas, to announce 
in advance you are going to do that 
and to do it, is to say that Congress has 
no power at all, that only the executive 
has power. 
That is why article II is impeaching 
him for abuse of Congress. That is why, 
for a much lesser degree of offense, 
Richard Nixon was impeached for abuse 
of Congress—for the same defiance of 
any attempt by the Congress to inves-
tigate. 
What are the consequences? The con-
sequences, if this is to be—if he is to 
get away with it, is that any subpoena 
you vote in the future, any information 
you want in the future from any future 
President may be denied you, with no 
excuses, announced in advance—I will 
defy all the subpoenas. It eviscerates 
Congress and establishes the executive 
department as a total dictatorship. 
That is the consequence. 
I want to also talk about—and the 
motives are clearly dictatorial. 
I want to also take a point, since I 
have the floor, to answer a question— 
to comment on a question that Senator 
COLLINS and Senator MURKOWSKI asked 
yesterday. They asked about the ques-
tion of mixed motives. How do you de-
fine—how do you deal with a deed— 
with a President who may have a cor-
rupt motive and a fine motive? How do 
you deal with it? 
Professor Dershowitz said: Well, you 
have to look at the—you have to mix. 
You have to weigh the balances. 
Nonsense. Nonsense. We never, in 
American law, look at decent motives 
if you can prove a corrupt motive. If I 
am offered a bribe and I accept the 
bribe for corrupt motive, I will not be 
heard in defense to say: Oh, I would 
have voted for the bill anyway; it was 
a good bill. You don’t inquire into 
other motives. Maybe you had good 
motives, but once the corrupt motive 
and the corrupt act was established, 
there is no comparison. 
All of this is just nonsense to point 
away from the fact that the President 
has been proven beyond a shadow of a 
doubt—and the defenders don’t even 
bother, really, to defend; they just 
come out with distractions—has been 
proven beyond a reasonable doubt to 
have abused his power by violating the 
law to withhold military aid from a 
foreign country to extort that country 
into helping his reelection campaign 
by slandering his opponent. Corrupt— 
no question. Violation of the law—no 
question. Factually—no question. They 
don’t even make a real attempt to deny 
it. Everything is a distraction. 
And the one chief distraction is, once 
you prove a corrupt act, that is it. You 
never measure the degree of, maybe he 
had decent motives too. Professor 
Dershowitz, in talking about that and 
in talking about the absolute power of 
the Presidency, was just absent from 
American law or any kind of Western 
law. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. PERDUE. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Georgia. 
Mr. PERDUE. I send a question to 
the desk for the President’s counsel on 
behalf of myself, Senator ERNST, and 
Senator BARRASSO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators PERDUE, 
ERNST, and BARRASSO for counsel for 
the President is as follows: 
Please summarize the House of Represent-
atives’ three-stage investigation and how the 
President was denied due process in each 
stage. Combined with Manager SCHIFF’s re-
peated leaks during the House’s investiga-
tion, do these due-process violations make 
this impeachment the fruit of the poisonous 
tree? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. The short answer, as I think 
I have indicated a couple of the times 
I have been up here, is, yes, this entire 
proceeding here is now the fruit of the 
poisonous tree. It is the fruit of a pro-
ceeding that was fatally deficient in 
due process from the start to the begin-
ning. As a result of that, it produced a 
record that is totally unreliable, can’t 
be relied on here for any conclusion 
other than acquitting the President. 
Let me detail the three phases. 
The first error was the House began 
the proceeding in a totally unconstitu-
tional, unlawful, and illegitimate man-
ner that started with an impeachment 
inquiry without any vote of the House 
to authorize that inquiry. I want to 
spend a second on this because the 
House managers have spent a lot of 
time today trying to go back and argue 
about why their proceeding was all 
right, but they are not actually engag-
ing the real issues. 
In order for the House to exercise the 
power of impeachment, there has to be 
a delegation of that authority to a 
committee. That is just a fundamental 
principle that the Constitution gives 
power to the House itself, not to indi-
vidual Members of the House, not to 
the Speaker. Just as here in the Senate 
you wouldn’t think that the majority 
leader could say—if an impeachment 
arrived, the majority leader could say: 
Guess what. We are not going to do a 
trial with the whole Senate. I, the ma-
jority leader, will decide I will have 
one committee hear the evidence, pro-
vide a summary, and then you all can 
vote. 
The majority leader doesn’t have the 
authority on his own to do that. The 
Speaker doesn’t have the authority in 
the House to give the power of im-
peachment to any committee to start 
pursuing an inquiry, and this is the 
key. There is no rule giving any com-
mittee in the House the authority to 
use the power of impeachment. Rule X 
speaks of legislative authority, not 
power of impeachment, and all the sub-
poenas that were issued came with let-
ters saying on them: Pursuant to the 
House’s impeachment inquiry. They 
purported to be using a power that 
hadn’t actually been delegated to the 
committee. That is the first flaw—ille-
gitimate, unlawful proceeding from the 
start. 
Then there are the due process laws. 
Three stages of the hearings: One, se-
cret hearings in the basement bunker; 
the President is locked out. No oppor-
tunity to cross-examine witnesses, to 
see the evidence, to present evidence. 
And then, they go from that to the 
public hearings, what was really just a 
public show trial, because the Presi-
dent is still cut out, totally unprece-
dented in any Presidential impeach-
ment—that there would be that second 
phase of public hearings where the 
President is still cut out, can’t present 
evidence. The minority Members don’t 
have equal subpoena authority. 
In the third phase in front of the 
House Judiciary Committee, they pur-
port to have offered rights, but I have 
explained that. It was illusory because 
they had already decided. Before the 
President was even supposed to respond 
to what rights he would like to exer-
cise, the Speaker had announced the 
result that there were going to be Arti-
cles of Impeachment. The Judiciary 
Committee decided they weren’t going 
to hear from any fact witnesses. They 
had no plans for hearings. It was all a 
foregone conclusion because they had 
to get it done by Christmas. 
And the third error: Chairman SCHIFF 
was in charge of all the fact-finding 
and he had an interest, because of the 
interactions of his office with the whis-
tleblower that we still don’t know 
about, to shut down questioning about

the motives, the bias, the reasons that 
the whistleblower—how this all came 
about. 
All three of those errors affected this 
process from the very beginning. They 
resulted in a one-sided, slanted fact- 
finding that was rushed by a person 
controlling the fact-finding who had a 
motive to limit what facts would be al-
lowed to get into the proceedings and 
produced a record that cannot possibly 
be relied on here. We said many times 
that the Supreme Court has made clear 
that cross-examination is the greatest 
legal engine ever invented for the dis-
covery of truth. And they didn’t permit 
the President the opportunity to cross- 
examine anyone. And that is an indica-
tion that the goal was not a search for 
the truth. It was a partisan charade in-
tended to justify a preordained result 
and to get it done by Christmas, and it 
is not a record that can be relied on 
here. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Ms. DUCKWORTH. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The 
question 
from 
Senator 
DUCKWORTH for the House managers: 
If the hold on aid to Ukraine was meant to 
be kept secret until the President could 
gather internal U.S. government information 
on Ukraine corruption and European cost 
sharing, then is there any documentary evi-
dence of this? For example, is there any evi-
dence that the President was briefed on 
those issues by the NSC, DOD or State De-
partment during the period of the hold in the 
summer of 2019, or any evidence that he re-
quested specific information on anti-corrup-
tion reform measures in Ukraine? Prior to 
releasing the aid on September 11, 2019, did 
the President order any changes to Adminis-
tration policy to address corruption in 
Ukraine or burden sharing with our Euro-
pean allies? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. Thank you, Senator, for that 
question. 
Let’s just take a moment and address 
what the process should have looked 
like, because, as we have already estab-
lished and as President’s counsel has 
conceded and we have conceded, this 
does happen. Right? There is a legiti-
mate policy process for review and for 
determination on hold because there is, 
indeed, legitimate policy reasons to 
hold aid. And we have never said that 
corruption is not one of those or bur-
den-sharing wouldn’t be one of those. 
What we are saying is that there is no 
evidence that what we are talking 
about today—- that the President was 
concerned or engaged in that process. 
So what would normally happen is 
Congress would come together as we 
did. We passed appropriations bills, and 
we made the determination that fund-
ing was appropriate for the aid, which 
87 Members of the Senate did this past 
year. The President would then rely on 
the advice of government experts from 
the National Security Council, the De-
partment of Defense, State Depart-
ment, and the Office of Management 
and Budget regarding that aid. That is 
the interagency process that we have 
talked so much about—the interagency 
process that we went through earlier 
last year. And at the conclusion of that 
interagency process, it was determined 
that it had met all the conditions for 
the aid and all the agencies determined 
that it should go forward. The Presi-
dent would then seek permission from 
Congress that he intended—normally, 
if there was a reason, the President 
would go back and seek permission 
from Congress—to hold the aid. So let 
me repeat that. If there were a reason 
to hold it, the President—and Presi-
dent Trump has done this in the past 
under legitimate processes, as has 
President 
Obama 
and 
prior 
Presi-
dents—would go back to Congress 
under predescribed processes and make 
sure that they are not violating the 
Impoundment Control Act and seek 
permission to hold it. That did not hap-
pen. 
Congress would then weigh in on the 
request by approving or denying the 
President’s request. Unless Congress 
specifically approves the President’s 
request, the aid must be made avail-
able. Of course, none of that happened. 
In this instance, a hold was put in 
place. We don’t know exactly when be-
cause the President and his agencies 
have prevented us, and his counsel pre-
vented us, from getting that informa-
tion. But a hold was put in place. No 
reason was given. The only one in the 
United States Government who appar-
ently knows why that hold was put in 
place is President’s counsel, who tried 
to tell us last night why he thinks the 
hold was put in place, but nobody else 
knows. 
So yes, the answer is if there was a 
legitimate policy process put in place, 
there will be a lot of information about 
burden-sharing, 
about 
corruption, 
about any of the other concerns to 
which we have no evidence. 
And if burden-sharing—to the last 
point of the question—was a concern, 
then the person who should have been 
asked to discuss those concerns with 
the EU and our European partners 
would have been Ambassador Sondland, 
because he is the United States Ambas-
sador to the European Union. And not 
once did President Trump go to Ambas-
sador Sondland and say: Discuss these 
issues with the EU and the Europeans, 
saying they need to provide more 
money. Not once did that happen, and 
it didn’t happen because it wasn’t the 
real concern. 
All the evidence shows the President 
withheld taxpayer money, foreign aid 
to our partner at war to coerce them to 
start a political investigation to ben-
efit his 2020 election campaign. That is 
what the evidence shows, and that is 
why we are still here. And there is one 
person that can provide additional in-
formation on that, and that is Ambas-
sador Bolton. And, yes, it is still a good 
time to subpoena Ambassador Bolton. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senators CRAPO, BLUNT, and 
RUBIO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator COLLINS 
and the other Senators for both par-
ties: 
Are there legitimate circumstances under 
which a President could request a foreign 
country to investigate a U.S. citizen, includ-
ing a political rival, who is not under inves-
tigation by the U.S. government? If so, what 
are they and how do they apply to the 
present case? 
The House goes first. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator. 
It would be hard for me to con-
template circumstances where that 
would be appropriate, where it would 
be appropriate for the President of the 
United States to seek a political inves-
tigation of an opponent. 
One of the, I think, most important 
post-Watergate reforms was to divorce 
decisions about specific cases, specific 
prosecutions from the White House to 
the Justice Department, to build a 
wall. One of the many norms that has 
broken down in this Presidency is that 
wall has been obliterated, where the 
President has affirmatively and aggres-
sively sought to investigate his rivals. 
I cannot conceive of circumstances 
where that is appropriate. 
It may be appropriate for the Justice 
Department, acting independently and 
in good faith, to initiate an investiga-
tion. There is a process for doing that. 
We heard testimony about doing that. 
You can make a request under the mu-
tual legal assistance treaty, MLAT, 
process when a foreign country has evi-
dence involving a criminal case involv-
ing a U.S. person. There is a legitimate 
way to do that. 
That didn’t happen here. In fact, 
when Bill Barr’s name was first re-
vealed, 
when 
that 
transcript 
was 
brought to light, the Justice Depart-
ment immediately said: We have noth-
ing to do with this—nothing to do with 
this. Here, this particular domestic po-
litical error was being done by the 
President’s personal lawyer. 
I want to just follow up also while I 
can, Senator, on my colleague’s com-
ments in terms of mixed-motives. If 
you conclude the President acted with 
mixed-motives—some corrupt and for-
bidden, some legitimate—you should 
vote to commit. That principle is deep-
ly rooted in our legal tradition. It is 
commonplace in civil and criminal law 
going back centuries. 
For example, in describing the stand-
ard for corrupt motive for obstruction, 
the 7th Circuit rejected any require-
ment that a defendant’s only or main 
purpose was to obstruct the due admin-
istration of justice and, instead, the 
court explained a defendant is guilty if 
his motives included any corrupt, for-
bidden goals. That case, United States

v. Cueto, which I cited earlier, is not 
only relevant here, but that case was 
argued by Professor Dershowitz and he 
lost. He made the argument he has 
made and the President’s lawyer have 
made today. They lost that case and 
for a good reason. It is contrary to the 
history of our legal traditions. If some-
one, and this is—the Founders were 
concerned, for example, that a Presi-
dent might be charged with bribing 
managers of the electoral college. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Presi-
dent’s counsel. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
I would like to start by pointing out 
that the question sort of assumes that 
there is a request for an investigation 
in a foreign country of a United States 
person. 
I would just like to bring it back, 
though, here, to the transcript of the 
July 25 call, where President Trump 
didn’t ask President Zelensky, specifi-
cally, for an investigation or investiga-
tion into Vice President Biden or his 
son Hunter. There is a lot of loose talk 
in sort of shorthand reference to it 
that way. 
What he refers to is the incident in 
which the prosecutor was fired. The 
first thing that he says in that whole 
exchange is talking about the pros-
ecutor being fired—and he says it 
sounds horrible to him—and the situa-
tion with Burisma. And all the Presi-
dent says is: ‘‘So if you can look into 
it. . . . It sounds horrible.’’ It sounds 
like a bad situation. 
That is not calling for an investiga-
tion, necessarily, into Vice President 
Biden or his son, but the situation in 
which the prosecutor had been fired 
which affected anti-corruption efforts 
in the Ukraine. 
President Zelensky responded by say-
ing the issue of the investigation of the 
case is actually the issue of making 
sure to restore the honesty. So we will 
take care of that. He is explaining that 
he understands that it is an issue that 
has to do with, was an investigation 
over there, which their prosecutor was 
handling, derailed in a way that af-
fected their anti-corruption efforts, 
and was it something worth looking 
into? 
It is the President’s making clear 
that we are not saying that it is off- 
limits. It sounds bad to the U.S. as 
well. 
Let me get more specifically to the 
question of, Is there any situation 
where it might be legitimate to ask for 
an investigation overseas? 
Yes. If there were conduct by a U.S. 
person overseas that potentially vio-
lated the law of that country but didn’t 
violate the law of this country but 
there were a national interest in hav-
ing some information about that and 
understanding what went on, then it 
would be perfectly legitimate to sug-
gest that this was something worth 
looking into. 
We have an interest in knowing 
about this, even if it is not something 
that would mean a criminal investiga-
tion here in the United States. So that 
could arise in various circumstances 
where a person had done something 
overseas, but there was a national in-
terest in knowing what they had done. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Democratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for Presi-
dent’s counsel and the House man-
agers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Democratic leader’s question is 
this: 
Yesterday I asked the President’s Counsel 
about the President’s claim of absolute im-
munity. Specifically, I asked the President’s 
lawyers to name a single document or wit-
ness that the President turned over to the 
House impeachment inquiry in response to 
their request or subpoena. Mr. Philbin spoke 
for 5 minutes and talked about the various 
types of immunities and privileges the Presi-
dent could invoke, but did not answer my 
question. So I ask once again, can you name 
a single witness or document that the Presi-
dent turned over to the House impeachment 
inquiry? 
It is directed to both parties, and the 
President’s counsel goes first. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Minority Leader SCHUMER, thank 
you for that question. I apologize if I 
was not direct at getting to the nub of 
the question yesterday. 
I was intending to explain the ration-
ales that the administration had pro-
vided for its actions and to explain, 
contrary to the question, that there 
was not simply absolute defiance and 
not simply a blanket assertion that we 
won’t do anything. That is the way the 
House managers have tried to charac-
terize it. 
So let me be clear. There were docu-
ment subpoenas issued prior to the 
adoption of H. Res. 660. The President 
explained—the 
administration 
ex-
plained—in various letters that all of 
those were invalid, and there were no 
documents produced in response. There 
were no documents produced in re-
sponse because all of those subpoenas 
were invalid. There was no attempt to 
reissue those subpoenas or to retro-
actively attempt to authorize them. 
There were then subpoenas for wit-
nesses who were senior advisers to the 
President. The President advised the 
head of the committees that had issued 
those that those senior advisers had 
absolute immunity, and they were not 
produced for testimony. Those three 
senior advisers were not produced. 
There were then subpoenas for wit-
nesses to others whom the House 
Democrats insisted would be required 
to testify without the benefit of agency 
counsel, and I have explained that prin-
ciple. The Office of Legal Counsel ad-
vised that those subpoenas attempting 
to require executive branch officials to 
testify without the benefit of agency 
counsel were unconstitutional, and so 
those witnesses were not produced. 
Still, there were 17 witnesses who testi-
fied, not including the 18th witness, the 
ICIG, whose testimony is still secret. 
So there was quite a bit of testi-
mony, and there have been, subse-
quently, some documents relevant to 
this, produced under FOIA. I just want 
to raise that because it makes clear 
that, if you follow the law and you fol-
low the rules and you make a docu-
ment request that is valid, documents 
get produced. If you don’t follow the 
law, the administration resists. That is 
why the documents were not pro-
duced—because the subpoenas were in-
valid. We made that very clear. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The quick an-
swer, Senator, is that not a single doc-
ument was turned over and not a single 
witness was produced. The witnesses 
who did come came in defiance of the 
orders of the President. 
Counsel has, obviously, made all of 
these claims that we think are com-
pletely spurious, but what they don’t 
answer is, what was the motivation to 
fight all of these subpoenas? 
They argue this interpretation which 
the courts have rejected—that the 
courts have looked at it and that some-
how these subpoenas were invalid. But 
why didn’t they produce the docu-
ments? Why did they insist on this 
‘‘now discredited by the courts’’ legal 
theory? Because they were covering up 
the President’s misconduct. 
I want to return briefly to finish the 
comments I was making earlier about 
the Senator’s question earlier on mixed 
motives. 
There is a good reason mixed motives 
are no defense. Otherwise, officials who 
commit misconduct could always claim 
that, even if they did it and even if it 
were corrupt, they must be acquitted 
because they were able to invent some 
phony motivation and insist it played 
some minor role in their scheme. 
Imagine how that principle would 
apply to a President charged with 
bribing members of the electoral col-
lege. Multiple Framers cited this spe-
cific threat while discussing impeach-
ment at the Constitutional Conven-
tion. Could a President defend himself 
on the ground that he was motivated, 
in part, by a noble desire to reward 
members of the electoral college for 
their public service? Could he defend it 
on the ground that, even as he handed 
over the bribes, he wasn’t just acting 
corruptly but was also seeking to ad-
vance the public interest by keeping 
himself in power? According to the 
President’s lawyers, yes, he could. 
Indeed, for all of the reasons we pro-
vided, there is no doubt that the Presi-
dent’s quid pro quo, the solicitation of 
foreign interference, and his use of offi-
cial acts to compel that interference 
were a fundamentally corrupt scheme, 
by which I mean the motive and intent 
was to benefit himself—to obtain per-
sonal political gain while ignoring and 
injuring core national interests in our 
democracy and our security.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S708 
January 30, 2020 
We have demonstrated, we believe, 
that the scheme was entirely corrupt, 
but if you have any question about 
that, ask John Bolton. If there is any 
question about whether the motive was 
mixed or not mixed, ask John Bolton. 
He has relevant testimony. You can 
ask, also, Mick Mulvaney. 
You can subpoena the documents and 
answer the earlier questions as to what 
the documents say about when the 
President withheld the aid and whether 
there was any interagency discussion 
of reforms in the errata. I mean, the 
President’s counsel literally made the 
argument that the circumstance that 
changed was a change in the errata, 
but there is no evidence to support 
that idea. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The manager’s 
time has expired. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate stand in recess until 4 p.m. 
There being no objection, at 3:37 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 4:03 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Idaho. 
Mr. CRAPO. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk on behalf of my-
self 
and 
Senators 
RISCH, 
GRAHAM, 
ERNST, FISCHER, CRUZ, and PERDUE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator CRAPO 
and the other Senators for counsel for 
the President: 
How many witnesses have been presented 
to the Senate at this point in this trial, how 
many pages of documentary evidence have 
been put in the record before the Senate in 
this trial, and how many other clips and 
transcripts of evidence have been presented 
to the Senate in this trial? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
I think it is important to recognize 
that—because 
the 
House 
managers 
keep talking about the need for wit-
nesses, you can’t have a trial without 
witnesses—you have seen a lot of wit-
nesses. There were 17 witnesses who 
were deposed and testified—12 in pub-
lic, 17 who were in closed hearings 
below. 
So far you have seen in these presen-
tations 192 video clips from 13 different 
witnesses. So testimony was shown 
here to you. Just as you would in a 
trial in an ordinary court sometimes 
play the video of a deposition instead 
of having the witness take the stand, 
you have seen video clips from 13 dif-
ferent witnesses. 
The House managers dramatically 
wheeled into the Senate a record—I 
think it was reported as being 29,000 
pages. I think the more official number 
is 28,578 pages. So you have got over 
28,000 pages of documents submitted 
into the record provisionally in evi-
dence in this trial, subject later to po-
tential objections for hearsay and 
other evidentiary objections. 
You have also heard here the argu-
ments that have been presented, along 
with presentation of both the documen-
tary and testimonial evidence by video 
clip and by slides that were put up. 
You have heard arguments for up to 24 
hours from each side. We didn’t take 
all of our time. The House managers 
argued for over 21 hours, putting on, 
with their video clips and their ex-
cerpts from documents in the record, 
their case. 
So at this point there has been a lot 
put on here in terms of a trial. You 
have seen the witnesses in the clips— 
all the most relevant parts. You have 
seen the documents put up in excerpts 
on screens. 
And as a result of this, the House 
managers have consistently said over 
and over again—before they came here, 
they said they had an overwhelming 
case. It was already buttoned down. 
They didn’t need anything else. 
They said when they got here that it 
was proven—every single allegation, 
every line in each Article of Impeach-
ment. They said: Proven, proven, prov-
en. 
We don’t think that that is true, but 
those are their words. That is what 
they are telling you—that they have 
had sufficient evidence to make their 
case. They said ‘‘proven,’’ ‘‘sufficient,’’ 
‘‘uncontested,’’ and ‘‘overwhelming’’ at 
least 68 times in the proceedings on the 
floor here. 
Manager NADLER told us just today 
that they think they have not only 
proved it beyond a reasonable doubt 
but beyond any doubt because of the 
evidence that they have already put on 
in front of you. 
We don’t think that is true. We think 
we have demonstrated it is not. 
But the point is that the House man-
agers have already put on a substantial 
amount of testimony from witnesses 
through their clips of prior deposition 
and hearing testimony. They have al-
ready presented to you a large portion 
of the most relevant documents from 
those 28,000. You have heard from the 
witnesses; you have seen where their 
testimony conflicts. You can see which 
is the better, more persuasive version 
of the facts. 
You have been able to see what it is 
that they have in the record that they 
say was overwhelming—already ready 
to go to trial—and this proceeding, 
therefore, has already had a lot of the 
earmarks of a trial. 
So don’t be taken in by the idea that 
we can’t have a trial here, you can’t 
have a valid proceeding unless they 
bring someone in here to testify live, 
because it wouldn’t be just one person. 
If we start to go down that route, it is 
not presenting the case that was pre-
pared in the hearings below; it is open-
ing up discovery for an entirely new 
case, and there would have to be depo-
sitions and witnesses on both sides, and 
there is no need to do that if they real-
ly believe what they are telling you— 
that it is already overwhelming. It is 
already proven. 
There is no need to go on to anything 
else when you have already seen so 
much and House managers had their 
chance to prepare their case. 
And, again, I would also just make 
the point to bear in mind what is the 
set—what precedent would be set if 
this Chamber has to become the inves-
tigatory body for impeachments that 
were not prepared properly in the 
House. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Arizona. 
Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
submit a question to the desk for the 
President’s counsel on behalf of myself, 
Senator MANCHIN, Senator MURKOWSKI, 
and Senator COLLINS. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator SINEMA 
and the other Senators for counsel for 
the President: 
The Logan Act prohibits any U.S. citizen 
without the authority of the United States 
from communicating with any foreign gov-
ernment with the intent to influence that 
government’s conduct in relation to any con-
troversy with the United States. Will the 
President assure the American public that 
private citizens will not be directed to con-
duct American foreign policy or national se-
curity policy, unless they have been specifi-
cally and formally designated by the Presi-
dent and the State Department to do so? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
Let me preface—let me answer in 
several parts. 
The first is, I just want to make clear 
that there was no conduct of foreign 
policy being carried on here by a pri-
vate person. 
The testimony was clear from Am-
bassador Volker—and I assume that 
the reference would be to Mr. Giuliani, 
the President’s private counsel. Am-
bassador Volker was clear that he un-
derstood Mr. Giuliani just to be a 
source of information for the President 
and someone who knew about Ukraine 
and someone who spoke to the Presi-
dent. 
And, in fact, it was the testimony 
that it was the Ukrainians, Andriy 
Yermak, who asked to be connected to 
Mr. Giuliani simply because he was 
someone who could provide informa-
tion to the President. 
And 
Ambassador 
Volker 
testified 
that it was not his understanding, he 
did not believe, that Mr. Giuliani was 
carrying out policy directives of the 
President but, rather, indicating his 
views of what he thought would be 
something useful for the Ukrainians to 
convince the President of their anti- 
corruption bona fides. So I just wanted 
to make that point. 
It is, of course, the President’s policy 
always to abide by the laws, and I am 
not in a position to make pledges for 
the President here, but the President’s 
policy is always to abide by the laws, 
and we continue to do so.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S709 
January 30, 2020 
I think it is worth pointing out that 
many Presidents, starting with Presi-
dent Washington, have relied on per-
sons who are their trusted confidants 
but who are not actually employees of 
the government to assist in the con-
duct of foreign diplomacy. 
President 
Washington 
relied 
on 
Gouverneur Morris to carry messages 
in certain circumstances, I believe, to 
the French. FDR had his confidants 
whom he relied on in certain cir-
cumstances to be a go-between with 
foreign powers, and there is a list of 
others. They were mentioned in some 
of the testimony during the House pro-
ceedings. 
So I don’t think that there is any-
thing—again, as I said, it was not here, 
but there would not be anything im-
proper for a President in some cir-
cumstances to rely on a personal con-
fidant to be able to convey messages or 
receive messages back and forth from a 
foreign government that would relate 
to the President’s conduct in foreign 
affairs. That is not prohibited but 
within his authority under the Con-
stitution under article II. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Your Honor. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you, Your 
Honor. On behalf of myself and Senator 
ERNST, I send a question to the desk for 
Mr. NADLER and Mr. Philbin. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator KENNEDY
and Senator 
ERNST to both parties, and the House 
managers will be first: 
If the president asks for an investigation of 
possible corruption by a political rival under 
circumstances that objectively are in the na-
tional interest, should the president be im-
peached if a majority of the House believes 
the president is in it for the wrong reason? 
Mr. Manager NADLER. The Presi-
dent, of course, is entitled to conduct 
foreign policy; he is entitled to look 
into corruption in the United States or 
elsewhere; he is entitled to use the De-
partment of State or any other Depart-
ments in that effort. He is not entitled 
to target an American citizen specifi-
cally, nor did he do so innocently here. 
It was only after Mr. Biden became an 
announced candidate for President that 
he 
suddenly 
decided 
that 
Ukraine 
ought to look into the Bidens. 
And he made it very clear—he made 
it very clear—that he wasn’t interested 
in an investigation; he was interested 
in an announcement of an investiga-
tion just so the Bidens could be 
smeared. 
So it is probably never suitable for a 
President to order an investigation of 
an American citizen. If he thinks there 
is general corruption and there is an 
investigation ongoing, the Justice De-
partment certainly can ask the foreign 
government to assist in an investiga-
tion. But that wasn’t done here. The 
President specifically targeted an indi-
vidual with an obvious political mo-
tive, and I would simply say that that 
is so clear that there is no question 
that it was a political motive against a 
specific individual. 
There are about 1.8 million compa-
nies in Ukraine. The estimates were 
that about half of them were corrupt. 
The President chose one—the one with 
Mr. Biden. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I think the short answer is no; the 
President should not be impeached. 
And I think what the focus of the ques-
tion is getting at is to the situation of 
mixed motives, which has come up a 
couple of times here. 
If the President, as chief law enforce-
ment officer, head of the executive 
branch, is in a situation where there is 
a legitimate investigation being pur-
sued and he indicates that it should be 
pursued, is it possible that he should be 
impeached for that if there is some dis-
pute about his motives, whether there 
is a legitimate basis for that conduct? 
The answer is no, and the House man-
agers themselves, in the way they 
framed their case, recognized this. 
In the House Judiciary Committee 
report, they repeatedly say that the 
standard they are going to have to 
meet—they are going to have to show 
that these are sham investigations; 
these are baseless investigations that 
they are alleging that the President 
wanted to initiate; and they had no le-
gitimate—there was not any legitimate 
basis for pursuing the investigation. I 
am pretty sure that is page 5 of the 
House Judiciary report. 
They use that standard and they talk 
about there not being a scintilla of evi-
dence about anything that anyone 
could reasonably want to ask about re-
lated to the Bidens and Burisma be-
cause they know they can’t get into a 
mixed-motive scenario, because if you 
have a legitimate basis for asking a 
question about something, if there is a 
legitimate national interest there, it is 
totally unacceptable to start getting 
into the field of saying: Well, we are 
going to impeach the President and re-
move him from office by putting him 
on the psychiatrist’s couch to try to 
get inside his head and find out was it 
48 percent in this motive and 52 in the 
other—or did he have some other ra-
tionale? No. If it is a legitimate in-
quiry in the national interest, that is 
the end of it, and you can’t say that we 
are going to impeach the President, re-
move him from office, decapitate the 
executive branch of the government, 
disrupt the functioning of the govern-
ment of the country in an election year 
by trying to parse out subjective mo-
tives and which percentage of the mo-
tive was a good motive or some other 
motive—something like that. If it is a 
legitimate inquiry in the national in-
terest, if that possibility is there, if the 
national interest is there, that is the 
end of it. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
I haven’t specified this before, but I 
think it would be best if Senators di-
rected their questions to one of the 
parties or both and leave it up to them 
to figure out who they want to go up to 
bat, rather than particular counsel. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, now 
I send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator DURBIN
to the House 
managers: 
Would you please respond to the answer 
that was given by President’s counsel to 
Senator SINEMA’s question? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, Mr. 
Chief Justice, in answer to that ques-
tion, we heard a rather breathtaking 
admission by the President’s lawyer, 
and it was said in an understated way, 
so you might have missed it. But what 
the President’s counsel said was that 
no foreign policy was being conducted 
by a private party here; that is, Rudy 
Giuliani was not conducting U.S. for-
eign policy. Rudy Giuliani was not con-
ducting policy. 
That is a remarkable admission be-
cause, to the degree that they have at-
tempted to suggest or claim or insinu-
ate that this is a policy difference, that 
a concern over burden-sharing or some 
big corruption was a policy issue, they 
have now acknowledged that the per-
son in charge of this was not con-
ducting policy. That is a startling ad-
mission. 
So the investigations that Giuliani 
was charged with trying to get Ukraine 
to announce into Joe Biden, into this 
Russia propaganda theory, they have 
just admitted were not part of policy. 
They were not policy conducted by Mr. 
Giuliani. 
So what were they? They were, in the 
words of Dr. Hill, ‘‘a domestic political 
errand,’’ not to be confused with pol-
icy. They have just undermined their 
entire argument—even as to mixed mo-
tives—because the man in charge of it 
was undergoing a domestic errand. 
You heard a suggestion that he was 
only doing this because he was asked 
by Andriy Yermak. That is laughable. 
Giuliani tried to get the meeting with 
Zelensky, remember? And he couldn’t 
get in the door, and then he announced 
that there were enemies around Presi-
dent Zelensky. And then they go into 
the phone call on July 25, and the 
Ukrainians try to persuade the Presi-
dent: 
You 
don’t 
have 
enemies 
in 
Ukraine; we are only friends. And what 
was the President’s response? I want 
you to ‘‘talk to Rudy.’’ That is not pol-
icy being conducted; that is a personal, 
political errand. They just undermined 
their entire argument. 
Now the President’s counsel also es-
sentially argues, in terms of witnesses, 
if their case is as strong as Mr. SCHIFF 
and Mr. NADLER and others say, then 
why do they need witnesses? You know, 
you can imagine a scene in any court-
room in America where, before the 
trial begins, defense counsel for the de-
fendant stands up and says: Your

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S710 
January 30, 2020 
Honor, if the prosecution’s case is so 
strong, let them prove it without wit-
nesses. That is essentially what is 
being argued here. 
Well, I will make an offer to opposing 
counsel, who have said that this will 
stretch on indefinitely if you decide to 
have a single witness: Let’s cabin the 
depositions to 1 week. 
In the Clinton trial, it was 1 week of 
depositions, and do you know what the 
Senate did during that week? They did 
the business of the Senate. The Senate 
went back to its ordinary legislative 
business while the depositions were 
being conducted. If you want the Clin-
ton model, let’s use the Clinton model. 
Let’s take a week. 
Let’s take a week to have a fair trial. 
You can continue your business. We 
can get the business of the country 
done. Is that too much to ask in the 
name of fairness, that we follow the 
Clinton model, that we take 1 week? 
I mean, are we really driven by the 
timing of the State of the Union? 
Should that be our guiding principle? 
Can’t we take 1 week to hear from 
these witnesses? I think we can. I 
think we should. I think we must. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I send to the desk a question submitted 
on 
behalf 
of 
myself 
and 
Senator 
SCHATZ, directed to both White House 
counsel and the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators MUR-
KOWSKI and SCHATZ directed to both 
parties: 
Would you agree that almost any action a 
President takes, or indeed any action the 
vast majority of politicians take, is, to one 
degree or another, inherently political? 
Where is the line between permissible polit-
ical actions and impeachable political ac-
tions? 
The President’s counsel will go first. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question, and I think that the question 
really hits the nail on the head. 
As I mentioned the other day, in a 
representative democracy, elected offi-
cials almost always have at least one 
eye looking on to the next election and 
how their actions—their policy deci-
sions, their actions in office—will be 
received by the electorate, and there is 
nothing wrong with that. That is good. 
It is part of the way representative de-
mocracy works. So having part of your 
motives being looking toward the next 
election, looking toward how that will 
affect electoral chances—that is part of 
the nature of elected office. And to 
start getting into motives about ‘‘Will 
this affect my prospects in the next 
election?’’ and calling that corrupt, 
and, if you have got that as part of 
your motive, looking into whether you 
were doing something for electoral ad-
vantage and saying ‘‘That is going to 
be a corrupt motive; we will say that 
you can be charged for wrongdoing 
with that or impeached’’ is very dan-
gerous because there is almost no way 
to get inside someone’s head and parcel 
out which percentage was one motive 
and which percentage was another mo-
tive. 
If you start down that path, it is to-
tally amorphous. This is part of the 
point that Professor Dershowitz was 
making and that was made here a cou-
ple of times. This idea of impeaching a 
President on a theory of abuse of power 
depends entirely on analyzing subjec-
tive motives because that is what the 
House managers have suggested—that 
we are assuming there is an act, on its 
face, that is legitimate and is within 
the President’s authority and is not, on 
its face, in any way unlawful or uncon-
stitutional, but solely based on motive, 
we are going to impeach him. And by 
saying ‘‘Well, if it was really directed 
at the next election, that is the corrupt 
motive,’’ that is a very dangerous path 
because there is always some eye on 
the next election. 
It ends up becoming a standard so 
malleable that it really is a substitute 
for a policy difference: If we don’t like 
your policy, we attribute it to bad mo-
tives. That is something that Justice 
Iredell warned about in the North 
Carolina ratifying convention, that if 
you base something just on motive be-
cause of what he called ‘‘malignity of 
party,’’ the other party will always at-
tribute bad motives. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I 
think the answer is yes. 
I think the answer is yes, that public 
officials are inherently political ani-
mals. I don’t mean that in the deroga-
tory term. They run for office; they 
hold office; they conduct acts as polit-
ical figures. But if we look at what 
Hamilton had to say about the core of 
offenses that warrant the impeachment 
power, he talked about the crimes 
being political in character and the 
remedies being political in character 
because we are not talking about im-
prisonment here. We are not talking 
about taking away someone’s liberty. 
So we are talking about a political 
punishment for a political crime. Now, 
what is a political crime? Yes, every-
one in office has a political motivation. 
But certainly that doesn’t mean that 
we can’t draw a line between corrupt 
activity that is undertaken, yes, for a 
political reason and noncorrupt activ-
ity. Indeed, we have to draw that line. 
Let’s 
show 
what 
Professor 
Dershowitz had to say about where we 
should draw the line. 
(Text of Videotape presentation:) 
Mr. DERSHOWITZ. If a President does 
something which he believes will help him 
get elected—in the public interest—that can-
not be the kind of quid pro quo that results 
in impeachment. The fact that he has an-
nounced his candidacy is a very good reason 
for upping the interest in this son. If he 
wasn’t running for President, he’s a has- 
been. He is the former Vice President of the 
United States. OK, big deal. But if he is run-
ning for President, that is an enormous big 
deal. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. So it is cer-
tainly true that when public officials 
take actions, they may have in mind, 
when they make a policy judgment, 
what is the impact on my political ca-
reer going to be, or, what is the impact 
going to be on my reelection prospects, 
but that is a very different question 
than whether they can engage in a cor-
rupt act to help their election—in this 
case, to get foreign help to cheat in an 
election. 
I think we can distinguish between 
the fact that political actors have po-
litical interests and what the Presi-
dent’s defense would argue, and that is, 
if he believes it is in his reelection in-
terest, then no quid pro quo is too cor-
rupt. If we go down that road, there is 
no limit to what this or any other 
President can do. There is no limit to 
what foreign powers will feel they can 
offer a corrupt President to help their 
reelection if that is the precedent we 
intend to establish. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. Thank you, Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a question, which I send to the 
desk and ask the House managers to 
respond to it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question for the House managers 
from Senator MENENDEZ: 
The President was seeking investigations 
from a foreign power based partly on what 
Fiona Hill called ‘‘a fictional narrative per-
petrated and propagated by the Russian se-
curity services.’’ The US Intelligence Com-
munity has warned that the Russian govern-
ment is already preparing to attack our elec-
tion in 2020, and the President has said pub-
licly he would welcome foreign interference 
in our elections. Why should Americans be 
concerned about foreign interference and 
why does it matter that the President con-
tinues to solicit foreign interference in our 
elections? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senator, thank you for the 
question. 
Let’s outline the facts that we do 
know about today. None of the 17 wit-
nesses who testified as part of the 
House’s 
impeachment 
inquiry 
were 
aware of any factual basis to support 
the allegations that it was Ukraine and 
not Russia that interfered in the 2016 
election. 
FBI 
Director 
Christopher 
Wray, who was nominated by President 
Trump and confirmed by this body, 
stated as recently as this past Decem-
ber that we have no reason to believe 
that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. 
election. He said: ‘‘We have no informa-
tion that indicates that Ukraine inter-
fered with the 2016 Presidential elec-
tion.’’ 
President Trump’s own Homeland Se-
curity advisor, Tom Bossert, said about 
this allegation: ‘‘It’s not only a con-
spiracy theory, it is completely de-
bunked.’’ He added: ‘‘Let me just re-
peat here again, it has no validity.’’ 
And, of course, Ms. Hill, as the ques-
tion indicated, said ‘‘fictional nar-
rative that is being perpetrated and 
propagated by the Russian security 
services themselves.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S711 
January 30, 2020 
The U.S. intelligence community has 
unanimously determined that there is 
no validity to this—our own intel-
ligence and law enforcement. Special 
Counsel Mueller found that Russia’s in-
terference was ‘‘sweeping and system-
atic.’’ 
But don’t take our own law enforce-
ment and intelligence community’s 
word for it; let’s hear what Vladimir 
Putin himself said recently about this. 
In November of 2019, Mr. Putin was 
overheard saying: ‘‘Thank God no one 
is accusing us of interfering in the U.S. 
elections anymore. Now they are ac-
cusing Ukraine.’’ 
Let me end with that one because 
that one demonstrates to me why this 
matters. That one demonstrates to me 
why anyone in the United States 
should matter. Vladimir Putin could 
care less about delivering healthcare 
for the people of Russia and building 
infrastructure 
in 
Russia. 
Vladimir 
Putin, as many people in this Chamber 
know well—because I have worked with 
some of you on this—wakes up every 
morning and goes to bed every night 
trying to figure out how to destroy 
American democracy, and he has orga-
nized the infrastructure of his govern-
ment around that effort. 
This is a battle over resolve. It is the 
battle over the hearts and minds of our 
people. It is the battle over informa-
tion and disinformation. And if a mes-
sage from the very top of our govern-
ment, from the very top of our lead-
ers—if the message from some folks 
over the last couple of weeks is that 
facts don’t matter, that our law en-
forcement doesn’t matter, that our in-
telligence 
communities’ 
unanimous 
consensus doesn’t matter, that is dan-
gerous. That is what Vladimir Putin 
and Russia are looking for, and that 
makes us less safe. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senators HAWLEY, CRUZ, 
CRAMER, BRAUN, PERDUE, BARRASSO, 
RUBIO, RISCH, SULLIVAN, ERNST, SCOTT 
of Florida, DAINES, and FISCHER
for 
both the House managers, with re-
sponse from the counsel for the Presi-
dent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator JOHNSON 
and the other Senators for both par-
ties: 
Recent reporting described two NSC staff 
holdovers from the Obama Administration 
attending an ‘‘all hands’’ meeting of NSC 
staff held about two weeks into the Trump 
Administration and talking loudly enough to 
be overheard saying ‘‘we need to do every-
thing we can to take out the President.’’ On 
July 26, 2019, the House Intelligence Com-
mittee hired one of those individuals, Sean 
Misko. The report further describes relation-
ships between Misko, Lt Col Vindman, and 
the alleged whistleblower. Why did your 
committee hire Sean Misko the day after the 
phone call between President Trump and 
Zelensky, and what role has he played 
throughout your committee’s investigation? 
The House will begin. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. First of all, 
there have been a lot of attacks upon 
my staff, and, as I said when this issue 
came up earlier, I am appalled at some 
of the spearing of the professional peo-
ple that work for the Intelligence Com-
mittee. 
Now, this question refers to allega-
tions in a newspaper article which are 
circulating smears on my staff and 
asks me to respond to those smears, 
and I will not dignify those smears on 
my staff by giving them any credence 
whatsoever; nor will I share any infor-
mation that I believe could or could 
not lead to the identification of the 
whistleblower. 
I want to be very clear about some-
thing. Members of this body used to 
care about the protection of whistle-
blower identities. They didn’t used to 
gratuitously attack members of com-
mittee staff, but now they do. Now 
they do. Now they will take an unsub-
stantiated, repressed article and use it 
to smear my staff. I think that is dis-
graceful. I think it is disgraceful. 
You 
know, 
whistleblowers 
are 
a 
unique and vital resource for the intel-
ligence community. And why? Because, 
unlike other whistleblowers who can go 
public with their information, whistle-
blowers in the intelligence community 
cannot because it deals with classified 
information. They must come to a 
committee. They must talk to the staff 
of that committee or to the inspector 
general. That is what they are sup-
posed to do. Our system relies upon it. 
And when you jeopardize a whistle-
blower by trying to out them this way, 
then you are threatening not just this 
whistleblower but the entire system. 
Now, the President would like to 
have nothing better than that, and I 
am sure the President is applauding 
this question because he wants his 
pound of flesh and he wants to punish 
anyone that has the courage to stand 
up to him. Well, I can’t tell you who 
the whistleblower is because I don’t 
know, but I can tell you who the whis-
tleblower should be. It should be every 
one of us. Every one of us should be 
willing to blow the whistle on Presi-
dential misconduct. If it weren’t for 
this whistleblower, we wouldn’t know 
about this misconduct, and that might 
be just as well for this President, but it 
would not be good for the country. 
And I worry that future people that 
see what I am doing are going to watch 
how this person has been treated, the 
threats against this person’s life, and 
they are going to say: Why stick my 
neck out? Is my name going to be 
dragged through the mud? 
Will people join our staff if they 
know that their names are going to be 
dragged through the mud? 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Members of the Senate, 
there are two responses that I would 
like to get to, one with regard to the 
issue of witnesses and, in this case, the 
whistleblower. 
Mr. SCHIFF
put the whistleblower 
issue front and center with his own 
words during the course of their inves-
tigation. He talked about the whistle-
blower testifying. 
Retribution is what is prohibited 
under the statute, against a whistle-
blower. That is what the whistleblower 
statute protects, that there is no ret-
ribution. In other words, you are not 
being fired from blowing the whistle. 
But this idea that there is complete 
anonymity—and I am not saying that 
we should disclose the individual’s 
name. I would be happy to handle that 
in executive session or any way you 
want. But we can’t just say it is not a 
relevant inquiry to know who on the 
staff that conducted the primary inves-
tigation here was in communication 
with that whistleblower, especially 
after Mr. SCHIFF denied that he or his 
staff initially had even had any con-
versations with the whistleblower. 
It goes back to the whole witness 
issue. I want to go to that for just 30 
seconds here. It seems to me that the 
discussion on witnesses—I heard what 
Mr. SCHIFF said about the 30—we will 
do depositions in a week. The Demo-
cratic leader said I can have any wit-
nesses I want yesterday. I got it from 
the transcript. And you couldn’t get all 
the witnesses you want in a week. You 
couldn’t get the discovery done in a 
week. 
But if, in fact—if, in fact, they be-
lieve they have presented this over-
whelming case that they have, all— 
they 
talked 
about 
subterfuge 
and 
smokescreens. The smokescreen here is 
that they used 13 of their 17 witnesses 
to try to prove their case, and we were 
able to use those very witnesses to un-
dercut that case. So I think we just 
have to keep that in perspective. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. I send a question to the desk 
for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question for the House managers 
from Senator MURRAY: 
If there are no consequences to openly 
defying a valid congressional subpoena, how 
will Congress be able to perform its constitu-
tional oversight responsibility to make sure 
any administration is following the law and 
acting in the best interests of American fam-
ilies? 
Ms. Manager GARCIA of Texas. Well, 
they could have very serious, dev-
astating, and dire consequences. If the 
Senate ignores President Trump’s on-
going obstruction of Congress, it would 
lead to the end of congressional over-
sight as we know it today. 
President Trump’s attorneys argued 
that our congressional subpoenas are 
constitutionally invalid until a court 
determines otherwise. Their argument 
is false, and it is an attack on congres-
sional oversight powers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S712 
January 30, 2020 
A vote against article II is a vote to 
condone President Trump’s corrupted 
view of America’s constitutional bal-
ance. Voting against article II would 
grant 
President 
Trump—and 
every 
other President from now until for-
ever—the power to simply ignore all 
congressional subpoenas unless and 
until we seek a court to enforce it. 
Under President Trump’s view, even 
if all of you Senators were to vote to 
favor to issue a subpoena for docu-
ments or witnesses, the administration 
could still ignore them until a court 
ruled on it. 
I think Mr. SCHIFF addressed some of 
that earlier in another question. You 
could go to court to enforce it. Then, it 
would get appealed, then, go back to 
court. We could go on and on because, 
quite frankly, that is what their posi-
tion is. 
So, again, as Mr. SCHIFF said earlier, 
imagine yourselves having jurisdiction 
over an item that you care deeply 
about, and you needed information. 
You heard of some wrongdoing. You 
heard there was a whistleblower com-
plaint on something, and you decided 
that you wanted to do a hearing. It is 
very possible that the President would 
just flatly refuse your subpoena, be-
cause, if we ignore article II, that 
would be the precedent—to ignore all 
subpoenas. 
But we need you to issue a subpoena 
for us today not only to get Mr. Bolton 
here but Mr. Duffey, Mr. Mulvaney, 
and everyone else with relevant evi-
dence on this case. 
Now, when the administration exerts 
executive privilege, there might be 
some privilege, one, that is available to 
them on any of these documents, but 
those have to be asserted with every 
document as we send a subpoena. 
So don’t buy the White House argu-
ment that our subpoenas are invalid 
because we don’t have any authority to 
issue them. We know we do. You know 
we do. So let’s make sure that this 
body will make sure that no future 
President will just simply defy, dis-
respect, and ignore subpoenas because 
some day you may be in our shoes 
wanting to get information, wanting to 
get to the bottom line to ensure that 
no President is above the law. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Ms. Manager. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself, Senators RISCH, BLUNT, KEN-
NEDY, JOHNSON, and CAPITO
for the 
President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator SULLIVAN 
and the other Senators for counsel for 
the President: 
Given that the Senate is now considering 
the very evidentiary record assembled and 
voted on by the House, which Chairman NAD-
LER has repeatedly claimed constitutes over-
whelming evidence for impeachment, how 
can the Senate be accused of engaging in, 
what Mr. NADLER described as ‘‘a coverup,’’ 
if the Senate makes its decision based on the 
exact same evidentiary record the House did? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
I think that is exactly right. I think 
it is rather preposterous to suggest 
that this Senate would be engaging in 
a coverup to rely on the same record 
that the House managers have said is 
overwhelming. 
They have said it dozens of times. 
They have said that, in their view, 
they have had enough evidence pre-
sented already to establish their case 
beyond any doubt, not just beyond a 
reasonable doubt. And it is totally in-
coherent to claim at the same time 
that it would be improper for the Sen-
ate to rely on that record. 
Your judgment may be and should be, 
we submit, different from the House 
managers’ assessment of that evidence 
because it hasn’t established their case 
at all. But if they are willing to tell 
you that it is complete and it has ev-
erything they need—it has everything 
they need to establish everything they 
want—I think you should be able to 
take them at their word that that is all 
that is there. 
And to switch now to say, ‘‘Well, no, 
we need more; we need more wit-
nesses,’’ I think just demonstrates that 
they haven’t proved their case. They 
don’t have the evidence to make their 
case. 
As I went through a minute ago, they 
have already presented a record with 
over 28,000 pages of documents that is 
here. They have already presented 
video clips of 13 witnesses. You have 
heard all of the key evidence that they 
gathered. It was their process. They 
were the ones who said what the proc-
ess was going to be, how it had to be 
run, who ought to testify, when to 
close it, when to decide they had 
enough, and you heard all the key 
highlights from that, and that is suffi-
cient for this body to make a decision. 
In the time I have remaining, I just 
want to turn to one point in response 
to something that was said a couple of 
minutes ago. We keep hearing repeat-
edly today the refrain of the idea that 
President Trump was somehow trying 
to peddle Vladimir Putin’s conspiracy 
theory that it was Ukraine and not 
Russia that interfered in the 2016 elec-
tion. And the House Democrats tried to 
present this binary view of the world 
that only one country, and one country 
alone, could have done something to 
interfere in the election, and it was 
Russia. And if you mention any other 
country doing something related to 
election interference, you are just a 
pawn of Vladimir Putin, trying to ped-
dle his conspiracy theories. 
That is obviously not true. More than 
one country and foreign nationals from 
more than one country could be doing 
different things for different reasons in 
different ways to try to interfere in the 
election, and that is exactly what 
President Trump was interested in. 
In the telephone call, the July 25 
transcript, he mentions CrowdStrike. 
He mentions the server. But he talks 
about—he says: 
There are a lot of things that went on, the 
whole situation. I think you’re surrounding 
yourself with some of the same people. 
So he is talking about much more 
than just the DNC server. And he closes 
it again, saying—he refers to Robert 
Mueller’s 
testimony, 
and 
he 
says: 
‘‘They say a lot of it started in 
Ukraine.’’ There are just a lot of stuff 
going on. Twice in that exchange he 
says there is a lot of stuff—the whole 
situation. 
And what is that referring to, sur-
rounding yourself with the same peo-
ple? President Zelensky refers imme-
diately to changing out the Ambas-
sador because the previous Ambas-
sador, who had been there under 
Poroshenko, had written an op-ed criti-
cizing President Trump during the 
election. 
We also know that there was a PO-
LITICO article in January 2017 cata-
loging multiple Ukrainian officials who 
did things either to criticize President 
Trump or to assist a DNC operative, 
Alexandra Chalupa, in gathering infor-
mation against the Trump campaign. 
And they said: There was no evidence 
in the record; no one said that there 
was anything done by Ukraine. 
That is not true. One of their star 
witnesses, Fiona Hill, specifically tes-
tified in her public hearing, because 
she said she went back and checked be-
cause she hadn’t recalled the POLIT-
ICO article. And then she said that she 
acknowledged that some Ukrainian of-
ficials ‘‘bet on Hillary Clinton winning 
the election.’’ And so it was quite evi-
dent, in her words, that they were try-
ing to favor the Clinton campaign, in-
cluding trying to collect information 
on people working in the Trump cam-
paign. That was Fiona Hill. She ac-
knowledged the Ukrainian officials 
were doing that. 
So this idea that it is a binary 
world—it is either Russia or Ukraine; if 
you mention Ukraine, you are just 
doing Vladimir Putin’s bidding—is to-
tally false, and you shouldn’t be fooled 
by that. 
Ukrainians—various 
Ukrainians— 
were doing things to interfere in the 
election campaign, and that is what 
President Trump was referring to. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel.

Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chief Justice, I ask

The question for the House managers 
from 
Senator 
LEAHY
and 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL: 
The President’s counsel claimed, ‘‘If a 
president does something which he believes 
will help him get elected in the public inter-
est that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo 
that results in impeachment.’’ He added a

S713 
January 30, 2020 
hypothetical, ‘‘’I think I’m the greatest 
president there ever was and if I’m not elect-
ed, the national interest will suffer greatly.’ 
That cannot be an impeachable offense.’’ 
Under this view, there is no remedy to pre-
vent a president from conditioning foreign 
security assistance, in violation of the Im-
poundment Control Act, on the recipient’s 
willingness to do the president a political 
favor. If the Senate fails to reject this the-
ory, what would stop a president from with-
holding disaster aid funding from a U.S. city 
until that mayor endorses him? What would 
stop the president from withholding nearly 
any part of the $4.7 trillion annual federal 
budget subject to his personal political ben-
efit? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Mr. Chief 
Justice, distinguished Members of the 
Senate, I thank the Senators for that 
very important question. 
Certainly, what we have alleged in 
this case is that the President solicited 
a personal political benefit in exchange 
for an official act, solicited dirt on a 
political opponent in exchange for the 
release of $391 million in military aid, 
and solicited dirt in exchange for a 
White House meeting. And if this Sen-
ate were to say that is acceptable, 
then, precisely as was outlined in that 
question could take place all across 
America in the context of the next 
election and any election—grants allo-
cated to cities or towns or municipali-
ties across the country, where the 
President could say: You are not going 
to get that money, Mr. Mayor, Mrs. 
County Executive, Mrs. Town Super-
visor, unless you endorse me for reelec-
tion. The President could say that to 
any Governor of our 50 States. 
That is unacceptable. That cannot be 
allowed to happen in our democratic 
Republic. 
Now, by my count, as of this after-
noon, the Framers of the Constitution 
and the Founders of our great Republic 
had been quoted either directly or men-
tioned by name 123 times: Alexander 
Hamilton, 48 times; James Madison, 35 
times; George Washington, 24 times; 
John Adams, 8 times; Thomas Jeffer-
son and Ben Franklin, pulling up the 
rear, 4 times. 
It seems to me that Ben Franklin 
and Thomas Jefferson need a little bit 
more love, and so let me try to do my 
part. 
Thomas Jefferson once observed that 
‘‘tyranny is defined as that which is 
legal for the government but illegal for 
the citizenry.’’ ‘‘Legal for the govern-
ment but illegal for the citizenry’’— 
that is what we confront right now. 
President Trump corruptly abused 
his power. He targeted an American 
citizen, pressured a foreign government 
to try to cheat in the upcoming elec-
tion, and the President’s counsel would 
have you believe that is OK because he 
is the President of the United States. 
But our fellow citizens cannot cheat 
the Workers’ Compensation Board by 
claiming a fake injury and escape ac-
countability. Our fellow citizens can-
not cheat the stock market by engag-
ing in insider trading and then escape 
accountability. Our fellow citizens can-
not cheat the college admissions proc-
ess in order to get their child into an 
elite university and then escape ac-
countability. 
Why should the President of the 
United States be allowed to cheat in 
the upcoming election and escape ac-
countability? 
Tyranny is defined as that which is 
legal for the government and illegal for 
the citizenry. 
The President’s counsel has sug-
gested that President Trump can do 
anything—anything that he wants— 
and escape accountability. President 
Trump can solicit foreign interference 
in the upcoming election and escape 
accountability. He can cheat and es-
cape accountability. He can engage in a 
coverup and escape accountability. He 
can corruptly abuse his power, escape 
accountability; elevate his personal po-
litical interest, subordinate America’s 
national security interest, and escape 
accountability. 
That is the Fifth Avenue standard of 
Presidential accountability: I can do 
anything I want. I can shoot someone 
on Fifth Avenue, and it doesn’t matter. 
No. Lawlessness matters. Abuse of 
power matters. Corruption matters. 
The Constitution matters. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senator RISCH to both the 
House managers and the White House 
counsel. And although I cannot pick, 
ideally, it would be Manager LOFGREN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senators CASSIDY and RISCH for 
both parties is as follows: 
In the Clinton proceedings, we saw a video 
of Manager LOFGREN saying, ‘‘This is unfair 
to the American people. By these actions 
you would undo the free election that ex-
pressed the will of the American people in 
1996. In so doing, you will damage the faith 
the American people have in this institution 
and in the American democracy. You will set 
the dangerous precedent that the certainty 
of Presidential terms, which has so benefited 
our wonderful America, will be replaced by 
the partisan use of impeachment. Future 
Presidents will face election, then litigation, 
then impeachment. The power of the Presi-
dent will diminish in the face of the Con-
gress, a phenomena much feared by the 
Founding Fathers.’’ 
What is different now? If the response is 
that the country cannot risk the President 
interfering in the next election, isn’t im-
peachment the ultimate interference? How 
does this not cheat those who did and/or 
would vote for President Trump from their 
participation in the democratic process? I 
ask Manager LOFGREN to address the ques-
tion directly and to not avoid, as Manager 
JEFFRIES did with a related question last 
night. 
The 
President’s 
counsel 
answers 
first. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate. 
Well, as I have said before, I agree 100 
percent with Manager LOFGREN’s com-
ments from the past, and I think they 
should guide the Senate. There is real-
ly no better way to say it. 
What they are doing here—they keep 
falsely accusing the President of want-
ing to cheat, when they are coming 
here and telling you ‘‘take him off the 
ballot’’ in a political impeachment. 
Talk about cheating. You don’t even 
want to face him. 
And let me say one more thing while 
I am up here. I listened to Manager 
SCHIFF come up here and say he won’t 
even dignify a legitimate question 
about his staff with a response because 
he won’t stand here and listen to peo-
ple on his staff be besmirched—who 
will join his staff. 
Since the beginning of this Congress, 
Manager SCHIFF, the other House man-
agers, and others in the House have 
falsely 
accused 
the 
President—and 
they have come here and done it—the 
Vice President, the Secretary of State, 
the Attorney General, the Chief of 
Staff, lawyers on my staff—false accu-
sations, calumny after calumny, in dul-
cet tones. And that is wrong. 
And when you turn that around and 
say he will not respond to a legitimate 
question that I ask—it is a legitimate 
question: Who communicated with the 
whistleblower? Why were you demand-
ing something that you already knew 
about? 
I asked him, in another part of my 
October 8 letter that doesn’t get a lot 
of attention from Mr. SCHIFF—I said: 
You have the full ability to release 
these documents on your own. No re-
sponse. 
So I think—I think you deserve an 
answer to that question, and I think it 
is time in this country that we start— 
that we stop assuming that everybody 
has horrible motives, in the puritanical 
rage of just everybody is doing some-
thing wrong except for you—you can-
not be questioned. That is part of the 
problem here. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, I was a member 
of the House Judiciary Committee dur-
ing the Clinton impeachment, and I 
was a member of the staff of a member 
of the Judiciary Committee during the 
Nixon impeachment. And during the 
Clinton impeachment, I found myself 
comparing what we were doing in Clin-
ton to what we were doing or had done 
with Nixon, and here is what I saw and 
I still see today: a special prosecutor 
started with Whitewater, spent several 
years, until they found DNA on a blue 
dress. And they had a lie. The Presi-
dent lied about a sexual affair under 
oath, and that was wrong. It was a 
crime, but it was not a misuse of Presi-
dential power. 
Any husband caught would have lied 
about it. It was wrong, but it was not 
a misuse of Presidential power. And so, 
throughout the Clinton matters, I kept 
raising the issue that it was a misuse— 
and it turned out to be a partisan mis-
use—of impeachment to equate a lie 
about a sexual affair to a high crime 
and misdemeanor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S714 
January 30, 2020 
Mr. MARKEY said they rubbed out the 
word ‘‘high’’ and made it ‘‘any crime 
and misdemeanors.’’ That was what 
was wrong in the Clinton impeach-
ment, compared to the Nixon impeach-
ment where Richard Nixon engaged in 
a broad scope, upending the constitu-
tional order, corrupting the govern-
ment for his own personal benefit in 
the election. 
I would add, unfortunately, that I 
never thought I would be in a third im-
peachment. 
Unfortunately, 
that 
is 
what we see in this case with President 
Trump. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Ms. Manager. 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself, Senator GILLIBRAND, and Sen-
ator SCHATZ to the President’s counsel 
and the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators MANCHIN, 
GILLIBRAND, and SCHATZ for both par-
ties: 
Have you ever been involved in any trial— 
civil, criminal, or other—in which you were 
unable to call witnesses or submit relevant 
evidence? 
I believe the House is first. 
Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice, and thank you to the 
Senator for the question. 
I want us to imagine for just a mo-
ment someone broke into your house; 
stole your property; police caught 
them; they returned the property. Now, 
the fact that they returned the prop-
erty changes nothing. They would still 
be held accountable. 
But imagine if they had the power to 
obstruct every witness, prevent wit-
nesses from appearing. Imagine if they 
had the power to destroy or obstruct 
any evidence in the case against them 
from being presented to the court. 
I have had the opportunity to appear 
in a lot of hearings and be a part of 
building a lot of cases. We all know. I 
know everybody here knows that wit-
ness testimony and evidence or docu-
mentation in a case is everything. It is 
the life and breath of any case. It is the 
prosecutor’s dream or the police offi-
cer’s or detective’s dream to have in-
formation and evidence. 
It truly baffles me, really, as a 27- 
year law enforcement officer, that we 
would not accept or welcome or be de-
lighted about the opportunity to hear 
from direct witnesses, people who have 
firsthand knowledge. 
We know that the President cannot 
be charged with a crime. We know 
that. The Department of Justice has 
already ruled on that. But the remedy 
for that is impeachment. That is the 
tool that, as we know, has solely been 
given—that 
power, 
solely—to 
the 
House of Representatives, solely tried 
before the Senate. 
So, to answer your question, it is ex-
tremely—let me say it this way: Only 
in a case where there are no available 
witnesses or no available evidence have 
I ever seen that occur. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mrs. Manager. 
Counsel. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate. 
I would respond to that question in 
this way. Thank you for the question. 
The House managers controlled the 
process in the House. I think we can all 
agree to that. They were in charge, and 
they ran it. And they chose not to 
allow the President’s counsel to have 
any witnesses. And they chose not to 
call the witnesses that they are now 
asking you to call, demanding you to 
call, accusing you of a coverup if you 
don’t call. 
I have never been in any proceeding, 
trial or otherwise, where you show up 
on the first day, and the judge says: 
Let’s go. And you say: Well, I’m not 
ready yet. Let’s stop everything. Let’s 
take a bunch of depositions. 
Well, did you subpoena the witnesses 
you are now seeking? 
Well, some but not others. 
Well, when you did subpoena them, 
did you try to enforce that subpoena in 
court? 
No. 
The other witnesses that you did sub-
poena, did they go to court? 
Yes. 
What did you do? I withdrew the sub-
poena and mooted out the case. And 
now I want them. I want them. Other-
wise, you are doing the coverup. 
Let me make another point because 
they keep making this point: What will 
we do? The President is not producing 
documents. 
I would like to refresh your recollec-
tion about the Mueller investigation, 
OK. The Mueller investigation had 2,800 
subpoenas, 500 search warrants, 500 wit-
nesses. The President’s Counsel, the 
Chief of Staff, and many, many others 
from the administration testified. Doc-
uments—voluminous documents—were 
produced. And what happened? Bob 
Mueller came back with a conclusion. 
He announced it. There was no collu-
sion. 
What did the House do? They didn’t 
like it. Didn’t like the outcome. So 
what did they do? They wanted a do- 
over. They wanted to do it all again 
themselves, despite the $34 million or 
more that was spent. 
So I don’t think anybody really be-
lieves that the Trump administration 
hasn’t fully cooperated with the inves-
tigations. The problem is, when they 
don’t like the outcome, they just keep 
investigating. They keep wasting the 
public’s money because they don’t real-
ly care about truth; they care about a 
political outcome. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. Chief Justice, I send a 
question to the desk on behalf of my-
self and Senators HAWLEY, ERNST, and 
BRAUN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
for counsel for the President from Sen-
ator LEE and other Senators: 
Under the standard embraced by the House 
Managers, would President Obama have been 
subject to impeachment charges based on his 
handling 
of 
the 
Benghazi 
attack, 
the 
Bergdahl swap, or DACA? Would President 
Bush have been subject to impeachment 
charges based on his handling of NSA sur-
veillance, detention of combatants, or use of 
waterboarding? 
Mr. Counsel HERSCHMANN. Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate. Under the standard, which is 
no standard that they bring their im-
peachment to the Senate, any Presi-
dent would be subject to impeachment 
for anything. Presidents would be sub-
ject to impeachment for exercising 
longstanding 
constitutional 
rights, 
even when the House chose not to en-
force their subpoenas under their vague 
theory of abuse of power. 
I guess any President—as Professor 
Dershowitz, he had a long list of Presi-
dents who might have been subject to 
impeachment. So I am not going to go 
through the particular incidents be-
cause I don’t want to besmirch past 
Presidents. 
I don’t think the standard that they 
announced is helpful. I think it is very 
dangerous. I mean, you might want to 
get a lock on that door because they 
are going to be back a lot if that is the 
standard. 
The truth of the matter is, you don’t 
have to look at anything. They are 
talking about witnesses. You don’t 
have to look at anything, except the 
Articles of Impeachment. 
I tried to seek areas of agreement. I 
think we all agree that they don’t al-
lege a crime. That is why they spend 
all their time saying you don’t need 
one. I remember one of the clips I 
showed where someone was saying, 
with a lot of passion, they are trying to 
cross out ‘‘high crime’’ and make it 
‘‘any crime.’’ Now they are trying to 
cross out ‘‘crime,’’ any crime. No crime 
is necessary. 
That is not what impeachment is 
about. This is dangerous. And it is 
more dangerous because it is an elec-
tion 
year. 
So, 
yes, 
under 
the 
standardless impeachment, any Presi-
dent can be impeached for anything. 
And that is wrong. By the way, they 
should be held to their Articles of Im-
peachment. A lot of what they are try-
ing to sell here, their own House col-
leagues weren’t buying. They didn’t 
make it into the Articles of Impeach-
ment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S715 
January 30, 2020 
I send a question to the desk on be-
half of myself, Senator CORTEZ MASTO, 
and Senator ROSEN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
for the House managers from Senators 
STABENOW, CORTEZ MASTO, and ROSEN 
to both parties: 
In June 2019, Ellen Weintraub, then-chair 
of the Federal Election Commission, wrote 
in a statement that ‘‘It is illegal for any per-
son to solicit, accept, or receive anything of 
value from a foreign national in connection 
with a U.S. election. This is not a novel con-
cept. Electoral intervention from foreign 
governments has been considered unaccept-
able since the beginnings of our nation.’’ In 
a 2007 advisory opinion, the FEC found that 
campaign contributions from foreign nation-
als are prohibited in federal elections, even if 
‘‘the value of these materials may be nomi-
nal or difficult to ascertain.’’ How valuable 
would a public announcement of an inves-
tigation into the Bidens be for President 
Trump’s reelection campaign? 
Begin with the White House Counsel. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senators, thank you for the 
question. 
The idea that these investigations 
were a thing of value—something that 
was specifically examined by the De-
partment of Justice—as I explained the 
other day, the inspector general for the 
intelligence community wrote a cover 
letter on the whistleblower complaint, 
in which he had actually exaggerated 
in the complaint—the idea that there 
was a demand for some assistance with 
the President’s reelection campaign. 
That was forwarded to the Department 
of Justice. They examined it, and they 
announced back in September that 
there was no election law violation be-
cause it did not qualify as a thing of 
value. I think that that issue has been 
thoroughly examined by the Depart-
ment of Justice here. 
I just want to clarify one thing. The 
other day there was—yesterday there 
was a question about information com-
ing from overseas, and I was asked a 
question about that. And I want to be 
very precise; that I understood the 
question to be about was there a viola-
tion of a campaign finance law, would 
there be one if someone simply got in-
formation from overseas? And the an-
swer is no, as a matter of law. 
Think about this. If pure informa-
tion—if information that came to 
someone in a campaign could be called 
a thing of value, if it comes from over-
seas, a thing of value is a prohibited 
campaign contribution; it is not al-
lowed. If it comes from within the 
country, it has to be reported. 
So that would mean that anytime a 
campaign got information from within 
the country about an opponent or 
about 
something 
else 
that 
maybe 
would be useful in the campaign, they 
would have to report the receipt of in-
formation as a thing of value under the 
campaign finance laws. 
That is not how the laws work, and 
there 
would 
be 
tremendous 
First 
Amendment implications if someone 
attempted to enforce the laws that 
way. So that is simply the point that I 
wanted to make. 
Pure information that is credible in-
formation is not something that is pro-
hibited from being received under the 
campaign finance laws. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Yes, Mr. Man-
ager. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. How valuable 
would it be for the President to get 
Ukraine to announce his investiga-
tions? And the answer is immensely 
valuable. And if it wasn’t going to be 
immensely valuable, why would the 
President go to such lengths to make it 
happen? Why would he be willing to 
violate the law, the Impoundment Con-
trol Act; why would he be willing to ig-
nore the advice of all of his national se-
curity professionals; why would he be 
willing to withhold hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars from an ally at war if 
he didn’t think it was going to really 
benefit his campaign? You have only to 
look at the President’s actions to de-
termine just how valuable he believed 
it would be to him. 
Now, how would he make use of this? 
Well, if we look in the past, we get a 
perfect illustration of how Donald 
Trump would have made use of this po-
litical help from Ukraine. 
Let’s look at 2016, when the Russians 
hacked the DCCC and the DNC, and 
they started dripping out these docu-
ments through WikiLeaks and other 
Russian platforms. 
What did the President do? Did he 
make use of it? Did he condemn it? Oh, 
he made beautiful use of it. Over 100 
times in the last 3 months of the cam-
paign, the President brought up time 
after time after time, rally after rally 
after rally, the Clinton Russian stolen 
documents. 
We have had a debate since then. 
What was the impact of the Russian in-
terference in 2016? In an election that 
close, was it decisive? No one will ever 
know. Was it valuable? You only have 
to look at Donald Trump’s actions to 
know just how valuable he thought it 
was. He thought it was immensely val-
uable. 
And you can darn well expect that if 
he had gotten this help from Ukraine, 
he would be out there every day talk-
ing about how Ukraine was inves-
tigating Joe Biden, and Ukraine is con-
ducting 
an 
investigation 
into 
Joe 
Biden. It would be proof of his argu-
ment against his feared opponent. 
You are darn right it would be valu-
able. What is more, it is illegal. And do 
we have to go through all the turmoil 
of the Russian interference perhaps to 
have the President do it all over again? 
One of the things I found so signifi-
cant was the day after Bob Mueller 
reached his conclusion that this Presi-
dent was back on the phone asking yet 
another country to help cheat in an-
other election. You are darn right that 
would have been valuable. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself, Senators 
CRUZ and CORNYN, for both parties. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators GRAHAM, 
CORNYN, and CRUZ is for both parties: 
When DOJ Inspector General Horowitz tes-
tified before the Judiciary Committee, he 
said their DOJ had a ‘‘low threshold’’ to in-
vestigate the Trump campaign. At the hear-
ing, Sen. FEINSTEIN said, ‘‘your report con-
cluded that the FBI had an adequate predi-
cate, reason, to open the investigation on 
the Trump campaign ties to Russia. Could 
you define the predicate?’’ Horowitz replied, 
‘‘yeah, so the predicate here was the infor-
mation that the FBI got at the end of July 
from the friendly foreign government.’’ Why 
is the legal standard for investigating Trump 
so much lower than the standard for inves-
tigating Biden? And why was it ok to get the 
information from a ‘‘friendly foreign govern-
ment?’’ 
The House managers are first. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The inspector 
general’s report found that the inves-
tigation was properly predicated. That 
was the bottom-line conclusion that 
this was not a politically motivated in-
vestigation. 
The inspector general also found, 
though, there were serious flaws with 
the FISA Court process. There were se-
rious flaws on how the FISA applica-
tions were written in the information 
that was used and prescribed a whole 
series of remedies, which the FBI Di-
rector has now said should be imple-
mented. But they found it was properly 
predicated. They found they did not 
have to ignore the evidence that had 
come to their attention that the cam-
paign for the President was having il-
licit contacts, potentially; that it may 
be colluding or conspiring with a for-
eign power. Indeed, it would have been 
derelict for them to ignore it. 
But the argument—the implicit argu-
ment here is, because there were prob-
lems, albeit serious problems, on the 
FISA Court application involving a sin-
gle person, that somehow we should ig-
nore the President’s conduct here; that 
somehow that justifies the President’s 
embrace of the Russian propaganda; 
that somehow that justifies the Presi-
dent’s distrust of the entire intel-
ligence community; that somehow that 
justifies his ignoring what his own Di-
rector of the FBI said, which his law-
yers ignore today, which is there is no 
evidence that Ukraine interfered in the 
2016 election. Because of a single FISA 
application against a single person and 
the flaws in it, you should ignore the 
evidence of the President’s wrongdoing. 
Turn away from that. Let’s not look at 
whether 
the 
President 
conditioned 
military aid and a White House meet-
ing on help with an investigation. Let’s 
look at flaws in how the FBI conducted 
a FISA application. The one does not 
follow from the other. 
The reality is that what you must 
judge here is: Did the President com-
mit the conduct he is charged with?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S716 
January 30, 2020 
Did the President withhold military 
aid and a coveted meeting to secure 
foreign interference in the election? 
And if he did, as we believe we have 
shown, does that warrant his removal 
from office? That is the issue before 
you, whether the FBI made one mis-
take or five mistakes with the FISA 
application. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, let me 
actually answer the question. 
The inspector general said, in a re-
sponse actually from Senator GRAHAM, 
when James Comey said he was vindi-
cated by the inspector general’s report, 
the inspector general said: No one who 
touched this was vindicated. 
With regard to the FISA—you make 
so light, Manager SCHIFF, of what the 
FBI did. It wasn’t a FISA warrant. 
There was an order unsealed just days 
ago saying the process was so tainted 
by the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion—so tainted—that not only was the 
NSD misled, but so was the FISA 
Court. 
For those that don’t know that are 
watching, the FISA Court—you can’t 
blame the court on this, by the way. 
You have to blame the Federal Bureau 
of Investigations for allowing this to 
happen. That is the court that issues 
warrants on people that are alleged to 
be spies. There are no lawyers in those 
proceedings. There is no cross-exam-
ination. The court itself in its order 
said: We rely on the good faith of the 
officers presenting the affidavits. 
Are there two standards for inves-
tigations? That is an understatement. 
But to belittle what took place in the 
FISA proceedings—frankly, Manager 
SCHIFF, you know better than that. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senator DURBIN is to both parties. 
Emails between DOD and OMB officials re-
veal that by August 12 the Pentagon could 
no longer guarantee that all of the $250 mil-
lion in DOD aid to Ukraine could be spent 
before it expired. Deputy Secretary of De-
fense Norquist drafted a letter and stated 
that the Pentagon had ‘‘repeatedly advised 
OMB officials that pauses beyond August 19 
jeopardize the Department’s ability to obli-
gate USAI funding prudently and fully.’’ 
Why did the President persist in withholding 
the funds when DOD officials were sounding 
the alarm that the hold would violate the 
law and short-change our ally of needed mili-
tary aid? 
It is the turn of the White House 
counsel to go first. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senator, thank you for that 
question. 
I think the thing to understand is, 
there was a series of communications 
reflected, I believe, in the letter that 
OMB has sent to the JAO and in some 
of the testimony in the proceeding 
below that the Office of Management 
and Budget was encouraging DOD to 
take what steps it could to get every-
thing lined up, have everything ready 
to obligate the funds so everything 
would be able to move quickly when 
the pause was lifted. 
The email you mentioned suggests— 
was saying: We are running out of 
time. We are running out of time. We 
are going to have difficulty doing it. 
But the fact was that the deadline for 
obligating the funds was not going to 
be until the end of the fiscal year. And 
as it turned out, as I explained earlier 
in response to Senator LANKFORD’s 
question, the funds were released on 
September 11, and the vast majority of 
them were obligated by the end of the 
fiscal year, so that the procedures that 
had been used to try to get everything 
preplanned were mostly successful. 
Yes, there were some funds—I believe 
it was $35 million—that did not get out 
of the door by the end of the fiscal 
year—slightly more than in past years. 
But in every year—in fiscal year 2017, 
fiscal year 2018—there were funds in 
the security assistance program that 
didn’t make it out of the door by the 
end of the year. Each of those years, 
there was also a little fix in either the 
appropriations bill or CR to allow 
those funds to carry over. 
So the planning had been to try to 
ensure that when the decision was 
made to release the funds, it would be 
done by the end of the fiscal year. Not 
quite all of that got out of the door, 
that is true, but there is always some 
that doesn’t get out of the door by the 
end of the fiscal year. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Members of the Senate, thank you 
for that question. 
As we go further and further down 
this rabbit hole, I think we need to 
make it very clear that, you know, of 
the 17 witnesses that the House inter-
viewed, nobody had an explanation. 
Yet again, like last night, Mr. Philbin 
seems to know more than anybody else 
in the government, more than anyone 
in the Department of Defense, more 
than anybody in the Department of 
State, more than anybody in OMB who 
had come forward with information 
about how exactly this happened. 
But, again, here are the facts. OMB 
interviewed about an interagency proc-
ess that they supposedly said was going 
on long after the interagency process 
had already ended. In fact, as OMB was 
doing those footnotes that we talked 
about last week—those footnotes that 
had never been done before, that Mr. 
Sandy said he had never seen in his 12 
years of time working this process—as 
that was going on, DOD was asking the 
question about why we are doing this. 
They had no idea. 
Then when the release was finally 
getting ready to be finally lifted—the 
hold, rather—OMB emailed DOD, say-
ing: Listen, as we have been saying all 
along, under the Impoundment Control 
Act, there are no problems here, and if 
there is a problem, it is your fault. To 
which DOD replied back, as you may 
recall: You have got to be kidding me. 
‘‘I’m speechless.’’ Because they did not 
know. Nobody had told them anything. 
None of the other 17 witnesses knew 
about it. 
So I do want to address, before I fin-
ish one other point, this idea that the 
delay didn’t matter. Listen, it doesn’t 
matter if it was a 4-day delay, a 40-day 
delay, or a 400-day delay; every delay 
in combat matters. Every delay in 
combat matters. 
And I will say—they talked about 
delays in the past. Well, in past years, 
there was about 3 to 6 percent of the 
funds unobligated because of unfore-
seen and legitimate reasons following 
the policy process. In 2019, 14 percent of 
the funds went unobligated for foresee-
able and avoidable reasons—because 
the President could have held them. 
And to this day, $16 million is unspent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. Your time has expired. 
The Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senators RISCH, YOUNG, 
FISCHER, BLUNT, and CAPITO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator BARRASSO 
and the other Senators is for the coun-
sel to the President: 
Is it within a U.S. President’s authority to 
personally address the issue of corruption 
with a head of a foreign government when he 
believes the established U.S. process has 
been unsuccessful in the past? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
The short answer is yes. The Presi-
dent is, under article II, vested with 
the entirety of the executive power, 
and it has been made clear since the 
founding, since the early part of the 
1800s, in decisions by the Supreme 
Court, that the President is the sole 
organ of the Nation in foreign affairs. 
He is vested with the authority to 
speak on behalf of the Nation. As the 
Supreme Court has described it, he is 
to be the sole voice of the Nation in 
foreign affairs. And that is why that 
authority was assigned in the Constitu-
tion to the Executive. 
Alexander Hamilton explained in the 
Federalist Papers that the Executive is 
characterized by unity and dispatch, 
the ability to have one view, to act 
quickly, and also the ability to main-
tain secrecy, and therefore it is the Ex-
ecutive that is uniquely suited and 
uniquely has the ability to carry out 
the responsibilities of engaging with 
foreign nations and carrying out diplo-
macy. 
So when the President believes that 
there is an issue of interest to the 
United States, including corruption in 
another country, and there hasn’t been 
the sort of progress that he would want 
to see in dealing with that issue in the 
foreign country—perhaps interactions

with prior administrations, prior offi-
cials of prior administrations that 
don’t look great from an anti-corrup-
tion perspective—it is entirely within 
the President’s prerogative and his 
province to raise those issues with a 
foreign leader, to point out where he 
believes there needs to be something 
done in the interest of the United 
States. If there is an issue related to 
corruption or whether it is something 
else—an issue related to economic mat-
ters, trade matters, antitrust matters, 
cross-border trade—those are all things 
the President can raise with a foreign 
leader. 
Corruption is not taken off the table. 
And it is also not taken off the table if 
it is an issue that happens to involve 
an official from a prior administration, 
whether that official is not or may 
have recently decided to run for an-
other office. If it relates to the na-
tional interest of the United States, he 
has legitimate reason for raising it, 
and it is within his authority as the 
Chief Executive. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Ms. WARREN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator WARREN 
is for the House managers: 
At a time when large majorities of Ameri-
cans have lost faith in government, does the 
fact that the Chief Justice is presiding over 
an impeachment trial in which Republican 
senators have thus far refused to allow wit-
nesses or evidence contribute to the loss of 
legitimacy of the Chief Justice, the Supreme 
Court, and the Constitution? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, I 
would not say it contributes to a loss 
of confidence in the Chief Justice. I 
think the Chief Justice has presided 
admirably. 
But I will say this: I was having a 
conversation the other day on the 
House floor with one of my colleagues, 
TOM MALINOWSKI, from Jersey—a bril-
liant colleague—and I was harkening 
back to what I thought was a key ex-
change during the course of this saga. 
This is when Ambassador Volker, in 
September, is talking with Andriy 
Yermak. Volker is making the case 
that the new President of Ukraine 
should not do a political investigation 
and prosecution of the former Presi-
dent of Ukraine, Poroshenko. He is 
making the case we often make when 
we travel around the country and meet 
with other Parliamentarians about not 
engaging in political investigations. 
And when he makes that remark, 
Yermak throws it right back in his 
face and says: Oh, you mean like the 
investigation you want us to do with 
the Clintons and the Bidens? 
I was lamenting this to my colleague. 
What is our answer to that? What is 
the answer to that from a country that 
prides itself on adherence to the rule of 
law? How do we answer that? And his 
response, I thought, was very inter-
esting. He said: This proceeding is our 
answer. This proceeding is our answer. 
Yes, we are a more than fallible de-
mocracy and we don’t always live up to 
our ideals, but when we have a Presi-
dent who demonstrates corruption of 
his office, who sacrifices the national 
interest for his personal interests, un-
like other countries, there is a remedy. 
So, yes, we don’t always live up to our 
ideals, but this trial is part of our con-
stitutional heritage, that we were 
given the power to impeach the Presi-
dent. 
I don’t think a trial without wit-
nesses reflects adversely on the Chief 
Justice. I do think it reflects adversely 
on us. I do think it diminishes the 
power of this example to the rest of the 
world if we cannot have a fair trial in 
the face of this kind of Presidential 
misconduct. This is the remedy. This is 
the remedy for Presidential abuse. But 
it does not reflect well on any of us if 
we are afraid of what the evidence 
holds. 
This will be the first trial in America 
where the defendant says at the begin-
ning of the trial: If the prosecution 
case is so good, why don’t they prove it 
without any witnesses? That is not a 
model we can hold up in pride to the 
rest of the world. 
Yes, Senator, I think that will feed 
cynicism about this institution, that 
we may disagree on the President’s 
conduct or not, but we can’t even get a 
fair trial. We can’t even get a fair 
shake for the American people. Oh my 
God, we can’t hear what John Bolton 
has to say. 
God forbid we should hear what a rel-
evant witness has to say. Hear no evil. 
That cannot reflect well on any of us. 
It is certainly no cause for celebration 
or vindication or anything like it. 
My colleague says that I am a Puri-
tan who speaks in dulcitones. I think 
that is the nicest thing he has ever said 
about me. I wouldn’t describe myself as 
a Puritan, but, yes, I do believe in 
right and wrong, and I think right mat-
ters. I think a fair trial matters, and I 
think that the country deserves a fair 
trial. 
Yes, Senator, if they don’t get that 
fair trial, it will just further a cyni-
cism that is corrosive to this institu-
tion and to our democracy. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator SHELBY is 
for the counsel for the President: 
Though not charged in the Articles of Im-
peachment, House Managers and others have 
stated the President’s actions constituted 
criminal bribery. Can this claim be rec-
onciled with the Supreme Court’s unanimous 
decision in McDonnell v. United States? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for that ques-
tion. 
I think the answer is, no, it can’t be 
reconciled with the McDonnell case. 
Let me make a couple of points in my 
answer. 
The first is, of course, because there 
is no bribery or extortion charge in the 
Articles of Impeachment, the managers 
can’t rely on that now to try to estab-
lish their case. 
I pointed out yesterday, I believe, 
that that is a due process violation of 
the most fundamental sort to have a 
charging document and leave out cer-
tain charges in the charging document, 
then come to trial and say: Well, it is 
not in the indictment, and it is not in 
the charge, but, actually, what we have 
shown you is he did something else 
wrong. It was ‘‘this crime.’’ As the 
House managers well know, that would 
result in an automatic mistrial in any 
actual trial in a court in this country. 
So that is the initial problem with try-
ing to go there on bribery or something 
else. 
Then, 
as 
the 
Senator’s 
question 
raises, the McDonnell case made clear, 
that simply arranging a meeting for 
someone—simply setting up a meeting 
with 
other 
government 
officials— 
couldn’t be treated as a thing of value 
in an exchange under the bribery stat-
ute. It pointed out, particularly in 
terms of government officials who all 
the time are asked by their constitu-
ents to introduce them to someone else 
in the government, to arrange a meet-
ing, that that is not an official act. It 
is not an official policy decision, an ac-
tion that is determining some govern-
ment policy. It is simply allowing 
someone to have a meeting and then 
talk about something. If that is the na-
ture of the meeting, that can’t be the 
thing of value that is being exchanged 
and can’t support a charge of bribery. 
So they can’t raise it because it is 
not in the Articles of Impeachment. If 
they had wanted to charge that, they 
had to charge it in the Articles of Im-
peachment. They can’t come here now 
and try to try a different case from the 
one they framed in the charging docu-
ment that they had complete control 
over drafting. Even if they did, they 
can’t make out the claim with respect 
to the White House meeting because 
the McDonnell case prohibits that. 
I would like to make one other point 
because the House managers today 
have brought up a lot. There have been 
a lot of questions again and again 
about the subpoena power and were 
their subpoenas actually valid and how 
it is going to destroy oversight if the 
President’s arguments are accepted. I 
just want to point something out. 
The subpoenas that were issued—that 
were purported to have been issued— 
were not under oversight authority but 
pursuant to—every letter that came

be exercising the authority of impeach-

the authority to acquire the informa-
tion for legislative purposes—has to ac-
tually relate to something that legisla-
tion could be passed on. There are cer-
tain constraints on what information 
can be sought. It is slightly different if 
you are going under the impeachment 
power because then you can investigate 
into specific past facts more readily be-
cause that is relevant to an impeach-
ment inquiry that might not be for leg-
islative purposes. They purported to be 
using 
the 
impeachment 
authority. 
They didn’t have that authorization 
because the Speaker’s press conference 
did not validly give them that author-
ization. We pointed out that the sub-
poenas were invalid. They did nothing 
to try to cure that deficiency. They 
didn’t reissue the subpoenas. They 
didn’t have the votes to reissue them 
or anything. 
To say now that all oversight will be 
destroyed forever if you accept the 
President’s arguments is totally false. 
It is totally misleading because they 
were not purporting to do just regular 
oversight. As we pointed out several 
times in the October 8 letter that the 
White House Counsel sent to Chairman 
SCHIFF and others, it said, specifically, 
if you want to return to regular over-
sight, we are happy to do that. As we 
have in the past, subject to constitu-
tional constraints, we will participate 
in the accommodation process. It was 
the House Democrats who didn’t want 
to take that route. They insist on 
using the impeachment authority. We 
pointed out that they didn’t have it, 
and they didn’t seek to cure that prob-
lem. 
Accepting the President’s position 
here has nothing to do with destroying 
oversight by Congress for all time and 
all circumstances. It has to do with the 
mistake that they made in trying to 
assert a particular authority that they 
didn’t have in this case. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Virginia. 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. Chief Justice, on 
behalf of myself, Senator BENNET, Sen-
ator BLUMENTHAL, and Senator HEIN-
RICH, I have a question to send to the 
desk for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators WARNER, 
BENNET, BLUMENTHAL, and HEINRICH is 
for the House managers: 
Our intelligence community and law en-
forcement leadership unanimously concluded 
Russia interfered in the 2016 election and 
that Russia continues those efforts toward 
the 2020 election. The Mueller report and the 
Senate Intelligence Committee reached the 
same conclusion. Yesterday the President’s 
counsel said that foreign election inter-
ference could be legal if it’s related to ‘‘cred-
ible’’ information. Does this mean it is prop-
er for the President to accept or encourage 
Russia, China, or other foreign countries to 
produce damaging intelligence or informa-
tion targeting his domestic political oppo-
nents as long as he deems it to be from 
‘‘credible information’’? 
This is for the House managers. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators and 
the Mr. Chief Justice, that is the nat-
ural conclusion of what the President’s 
lawyers are arguing. 
Essentially, if the President believes 
that it would serve his reelection inter-
est to seek the help of a foreign intel-
ligence service to provide dirt on his 
opponent or in other ways assist his 
campaign, as long as he thinks his win-
ning is in the national interest, then 
that is OK. 
It is not OK, but no restraint can be 
placed upon him. Even if he were to go 
so far as to proclaim a quid pro quo— 
hey, Russia, you have got among the 
best intelligence services on the plan-
et. If you will engage those intelligence 
services on my behalf, I will refuse to 
enforce sanctions on you over your in-
vasion of Ukraine. That may injure the 
security of our country, but, look, I 
think my reelection is more impor-
tant—that is where this bastardization 
of the Constitution leads us—to the 
idea that no abuse of power is within 
reach of the Congress. 
Now I want to take this opportunity 
to respond to a couple of other quick 
points if I can. 
First, counsel neglects the fact that, 
when we issued those subpoenas, we 
stated in the letters accompanying 
their issuances that they were being 
issued consistent with both the im-
peachment inquiry and our oversight 
authority. They neglected to tell you 
the latter part—that we explicitly 
made reference to our oversight capac-
ity as legislators. 
Finally, on the issue of bribery, in 
the Nixon impeachment, there was an 
umbrella Article of Impeachment that 
listed a series of specific acts. Some of 
those acts involved criminal activity, 
and some involved just unethical activ-
ity. If you were to accept counsel’s ar-
gument, you would have said that the 
articles that passed out of the House 
Judiciary Committee in Nixon were 
likewise infirm because, if they were 
going to charge the President with en-
gaging in a criminal act, they needed 
to make a separate article of it. Other-
wise, how dare they? It would be a vio-
lation of due process, and it would be 
thrown out of any court—prosecutorial 
misconduct and the like. 
OK. That is nonsense. On the one 
hand, they want to argue there is no 
conduct here that is even akin to a 
crime, when, under McDonnell, in fact, 
this would constitute bribery. With-
holding a White House meeting and 
withholding the provision of hundreds 
of millions of dollars in aid under the 
precedent of McDonnell would be brib-
ery, but there is no doubt it is akin to 
bribery. They would say, unless you 
charge that—in the Nixon case, they 
had 15 articles on each particular act, 
criminal and noncriminal—then you 
could not make out a viable charge. 
That has never been a constitutional 
principle. Just as they would have had 
the House organize its impeachment 
investigation along the terms they dic-
tate, they now want to dictate how we 
can charge an offense. 
At the end of the day, the task is to 
determine whether the conduct that is 
charged 
has 
been 
committed 
and 
whether that abuse of power rises to 
the level warranting impeachment. 
This is a technical legal argument 
that, no, you have to charge it as we 
would like you to charge it, and you 
can’t make reference to the fact that, 
yes, these acts also constitute bribery 
and that that is somehow offensive to 
legal or constitutional principles. It is 
not. Yes, we could have charged brib-
ery. We could have had two separate 
counts. That is not a constitutional re-
quirement. Had we done that, as I said 
last night, they would have attacked 
that, saying you are taking one offense 
and making it into two. 
That does not detract from the fact 
that the President’s conduct violated 
our bribery laws, particularly as they 
were understood by the Framers, not as 
they were understood 200 years later. 
They violated what the Framers under-
stood from British common law to con-
stitute extortion. They violated the 
modern-day Impoundment Control Act. 
They violated the Whistleblower Pro-
tection Act. They violated multiple 
laws, but that is not even necessary. 
What is necessary is that they abused 
their power. Counsel says: Well, claims 
are made of abuse of power all the 
time. Yes, that is true in political rhet-
oric, but these circumstances war-
ranted impeachment. The President 
was 
not 
impeached 
over 
climate 
change or any of the other enumerable 
examples they gave of people rhetori-
cally saying the President is abusing 
his office. That is not what brought us 
here. What brought us here was the 
President decided that he could with-
hold military aid to an ally at war to 
get help in his reelection. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a question for the President’s 
counsel, and I am being joined by Sen-
ators ROUNDS and YOUNG. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator INHOFE, 
joined by Senators ROUNDS and YOUNG, 
is for counsel to the President: 
Even if additional witnesses are called, do 
you ever envision the House Managers agree-
ing there has been a fair Senate trial if it 
ends in the President’s acquittal? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, the 
answer is no. 
Now, they will not agree that it is 
fair because what will happen is, if 
there is a discussion of witnesses and if 
we go to witnesses, Mr. SCHUMER has 
laid out the four he wants, and he tells 
me we could have anybody we want. 
The reality is that also includes docu-
ments, and that includes other wit-
nesses that it may lead to. So, at some 
point, this body will say—because this 
cannot go on forever, and we will be at 
the election—this has to come to an 
end, and they will say: Aha, it has been 
brought to an end as we were about to 
get the key evidence.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S719 
January 30, 2020 
But what is so interesting here is 
they had 17 witnesses—that they had. 
When the hearing took place before the 
Judiciary Committee, if I am not mis-
taken, Manager NADLER, you had four 
witnesses at one point, when you had 
the law professors, and there were 
three law professors from the Demo-
cratic side and there was one from the 
Republican side. So if we are going to 
take that same four-to-one analysis, 
for every one of their witnesses, we 
should get four. 
But there was a question earlier 
asked about the truth of the poisonous 
tree. The taint of the poison does not 
age well. The longer it goes does not 
make that poison go away. It gets 
deeper and deeper into the soil, and 
here, the soil we are talking about is a 
trial that would be not only ongoing, 
but they put up 17 witnesses. You have 
heard them. They are acting like there 
have been no witnesses presented here. 
They presented the testimony of 17. 
They may not have liked that we were 
able to respond to those 17 by playing 
those witnesses’ words. By the way, 
those 
witnesses—the 
testimony 
of 
those witnesses—were never done with 
cross-examination by the counsel for 
the President. 
So does this end? Will it ever be 
enough? No, it will only be enough if 
they got a conviction because that is 
what it is about, because let’s not for-
get for a moment that this has been 
going on, in one stage or another, for 
31⁄2, 3 years now. 
My concern is there is not a—where 
is the end point in that? So their end 
point is: Well, just give us John Bolton, 
and then, you know, you don’t get any-
body or then, you know, you get one 
and we get one, and then that one may 
lead to somebody else. It is not the way 
it works. 
So they have said ‘‘overwhelming,’’ 
‘‘proved,’’ 63 times—63 times. And as 
we are 3 hours away from answering 
the end of the question section, we are 
about to go into—I mean, it sounds 
like we have been arguing about wit-
nesses for the last couple hours, but 
that starts tomorrow. 
But do I think that there will be—is 
it our position that there will be—a 
recognition that there is due process 
that has been reached and we have 
reached a happy accord? No, I do not 
believe that. 
I also don’t believe that what can be 
cured here. I don’t think what they did 
can be cured here by anything you 
were to do as far as witnesses or any-
thing else. That process was so tainted, 
and I thought Mr. Philbin did a very ef-
fective job of explaining—painstak-
ingly, now, and multiple times, I 
know—the issue of those subpoenas. 
And I thought the perfect analysis was 
when one of the managers said: Well, 
when people file freedom of informa-
tion requests, they get answers. And 
Mr. Philbin said: That is because they 
followed the law; they followed the 
rules. That is not what happened here. 
Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Delaware. 
Mr. CARPER. Mr. Chief Justice, on 
behalf of our colleagues Senators BOOK-
ER, CARDIN, KAINE, MARKEY, MENENDEZ, 
MERKLEY, MURPHY, and SHAHEEN, I 
send a question to the desk for the 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator CARPER 
and the other Senators addressed to 
the House managers: 
The President’s aides and defenders have 
claimed that it is ‘‘normal’’ or ‘‘usual’’ to 
use U.S. foreign assistance as the President 
did to achieve a desired outcome. How was 
the President’s act in withholding U.S. secu-
rity assistance to Ukraine different from 
how the U.S. uses foreign assistance to 
achieve foreign policy goals and national se-
curity objectives, and how should we evalu-
ate the defense argument that this is what is 
‘‘done all the time’’? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
So to understand the answer to this, 
you don’t have to look inside the Presi-
dent’s mind. You just have to look at 
recent history and then what was done 
last year. 
As I talked about earlier, and even 
yesterday, other Presidents have held 
holds in aid for legitimate reasons, 
even this President. We concede that. 
But there are a variety of legitimate 
policy reasons for holding aid, whether 
it be corruption or burden-sharing. 
See, even in the President’s other 
holds—like Afghanistan, because of 
concerns about terrorism, or Central 
America, because of immigration con-
cerns—even though some might dis-
agree with that, that is a legitimate 
policy debate. 
The difference here is that every wit-
ness testified—these 17 witnesses that 
you hear about testified—that there 
was no reason provided for the imple-
mentation of this hold. Right? 
I talked about earlier how there is a 
process for doing this. Right? There is 
a well-prescribed process for allocating 
the funds, like we all did here in this 
Chamber and 87 of you agreed on it, 
and then an interagency process to re-
view it to make sure that it meets the 
standards and criteria outlined by this 
body, anticorruption reforms. And that 
was done in this case. That interagency 
process was followed. That certifi-
cation was made. The notification to 
Congress was conducted. The train had 
left the station, just like the train had 
left the station in 2018, in 2017, in 2016. 
And every element of the agencies and 
the bureaucracy involved in that proc-
ess in prior years had been engaged and 
had signed off, except this year. 
In 2019, rather, that all changed. A 
hold was implemented for no known 
reason. There was no notification given 
to Congress, which violated the Im-
poundment Control Act. DOD, Depart-
ment of State, Secretary Esper, Sec-
retary Pompeo, even Vice President 
PENCE, and the entire National Secu-
rity Council implored the President to 
release the aid because it not only had 
met all of the certifications but it was 
in the U.S. national interest and con-
sistent with U.S. policy. 
And yet, nobody knew why it hap-
pened, and, to this day, the individual 
who could shed light on this, Mr. 
Bolton, is being prohibited from com-
ing forward to explain why the Presi-
dent told him it happened. 
So, yes, it is still a good time to sub-
poena Ambassador Bolton and get that 
information. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. Chief Justice, I have 
a question for both sets of counsel, 
sponsored by myself, Senator CRUZ, 
Senator 
SCOTT
of 
South 
Carolina, 
HAWLEY, SASSE, and RUBIO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator BURR and 
the other Senators is for both parties. 
The House will answer first: 
Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Demo-
cratic National Committee hired a retired 
foreign spy to work with Russian contacts to 
build a dossier of opposition research against 
her political opponent, Donald Trump. Under 
the House Manager’s standard, would the 
Steele dossier be considered as foreign inter-
ference in a US election, a violation of the 
law, and/or an impeachable offense? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice and distinguished 
Senators. I thank you for the question. 
The analogy is not applicable to the 
present situation because, first, to the 
extent that opposition research was ob-
tained, it was opposition research that 
was purchased. 
But this speaks to the underlying 
issue of the avoidance of facts—the 
avoidance of the reality of what Presi-
dent Trump did in this particular cir-
cumstance. 
Now, I have tremendous respect for 
the President’s counsel, but one of the 
arguments that we consistently hear 
on the floor of this Senate, this great 
institution in America’s democracy, is 
conspiracy theory after conspiracy the-
ory after conspiracy theory. 
We have heard about the deep-state 
conspiracy theory. We have heard 
about the ‘‘Adam Schiff is the root of 
all evil’’ conspiracy theory. We have 
heard about the Burisma conspiracy 
theory. We have heard about the 
CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. We 
have heard about the whistleblower 
conspiracy theory. It is hard to keep 
count. 
This is the Senate. This is America’s 
most exclusive political club. This is 
the world’s greatest deliberative body, 
and all you offer us is conspiracy theo-
ries because you can’t address the facts 
in this case, that the President cor-
ruptly abused his power to target an 
American citizen for political and per-
sonal gain. He tried to cheat in the 
election by soliciting foreign inter-
ference. That is an impeachable of-
fense. That is a crime against the Con-
stitution. That is the reason that we 
are here. That is what is before this 
great body of distinguished Senators.

S720 
January 30, 2020 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, 
Members of the Senate, so, I guess you 
can buy—that is what it sounds like; 
you can buy a foreign interference. If 
you purchase it, if you purchase their 
opposition research, I guess that is OK. 
So let me try to debunk the con-
spiracy, Manager JEFFRIES; and that is, 
it is not conspiracy that Christopher 
Steele was engaged to obtain and pre-
pare a dossier on the Presidential can-
didate for the Republican Party, Don-
ald Trump. It is not a conspiracy that 
Christopher Steele utilized his network 
of assets—including assets, apparently, 
in Russia—to draft the dossier. It is not 
a conspiracy that the dossier was 
shared with the Department of Justice 
through Bruce Ohr, who was the No. 4 
ranking member of the Department of 
Justice at that time, because his wife, 
Nellie Ohr, happened to be working for 
the organization, Fusion GPS, that was 
putting the dossier together. This is 
also not a conspiracy. It sounds like 
one, except it is real. And it is also not 
a conspiracy that that dossier—pur-
chased dossier—was taken by the FBI, 
submitted to the Foreign Intelligence 
Surveillance Court to obtain a foreign 
intelligence surveillance order on an 
American citizen. It is also not a con-
spiracy that that court issued an 
order—two of them now—condemning 
the FBI’s practice and acknowledging 
that many of those orders were not 
properly issued. None of that is a con-
spiracy theory. That is just the facts. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Wisconsin. 
Ms. BALDWIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for both 
President’s counsel and House man-
agers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator BALDWIN 
is for both parties, and counsel for the 
President will answer first: 
Can you assure us that the Jennifer Wil-
liams document submitted to the House was 
not classified SECRET for any reasons pro-
hibited by Executive Order 13526, such as pre-
venting embarrassment to a person? If yes, 
please describe or identify the serious dam-
age to national security that would be 
caused by declassifying this document, pur-
suant to the same Executive Order. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senator, in response to your 
question, the Trump administration’s 
policy is always to abide by the re-
quirements for classification of mate-
rial, and the classification—my under-
standing is that that document is de-
rivatively classified because it refers to 
another document, a transcript that 
was originally classified. I can’t rep-
resent to you a specific reason that the 
classification officer classified that 
document, but I can tell you that it 
was originally classified according to 
proper procedures. It is a properly clas-
sified document, and that is the policy 
of the administration, to follow the 
classification procedures. 
The memorandum that she submitted 
is derivatively classified because of 
that transcript. Now, that transcript 
relates to a conversation with a foreign 
head of state. Almost all conversations 
with foreign heads of state are classi-
fied. They are classified because the 
confidentiality relates to those com-
munications. It is important for ensur-
ing that there can be candid conversa-
tions with foreign heads of state. 
The President took an extraordinary 
action in declassifying two of his con-
versations with foreign heads of state— 
unprecedented—because he carefully 
weighed the balance of what was at 
stake in this case and the need for 
transparency to the American public in 
those two conversations. But that was 
an exception to the usual rule that 
such conversations are properly classi-
fied. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I 
would encourage you, if you haven’t al-
ready had the opportunity, to read that 
document for yourself and ask whether 
you think there is any legitimate basis 
to classify that supplemental testi-
mony. 
Now, the Vice President has said that 
he had no knowledge of this scheme. He 
has denied any knowledge, involvement 
in any way, shape, or form. 
We heard the testimony of Ambas-
sador 
Sondland 
that 
Ambassador 
Sondland raised to the Vice President 
that the aid was being held up and was 
tied to these investigations, and the 
Vice President didn’t say: What are 
you talking about? That could never 
be. The President would never allow 
such a thing. 
There was nothing but a silent nod of 
acknowledgment of what he was being 
told. But, nonetheless, the Vice Presi-
dent says that he knew nothing, and 
the Vice President points to the open 
testimony of Jennifer Williams to sup-
port that contention. But the classified 
submission goes to that phone call be-
tween the Vice President and President 
Zelensky. You should read that and 
ask yourself whether that submission 
is being classified because it would ei-
ther embarrass or undermine what the 
President and the Vice President are 
saying or there is some legitimate rea-
son. 
Now, the Vice President at one point 
said that he wanted to release the 
record of his call. He certainly talked 
all about this issue, as has the Presi-
dent. If it was so classified, then why 
are they all talking about it? But we 
are to be assured that this classifica-
tion decision was made absolutely 
above board. I am sure that John 
Bolton’s manuscript will be treated 
with the same rigid, objective scrutiny. 
You read that. Don’t take my word 
for it. You read that, and you ask your-
selves, is there anything that—other 
than avoiding evidence that the admin-
istration doesn’t want you to see—that 
the public shouldn’t see in Jennifer 
Williams’ supplemental testimony? I 
don’t think you can conclude that it is, 
except that it would be inconsistent 
with what you are being told and what 
the American people are being told. 
Well, they deserve the whole truth, and 
that is part of the truth. So let the 
public see it. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. I send a question to the 
desk on behalf of myself, Senator 
DAINES, and Senator CRUZ. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators ALEX-
ANDER, DAINES, and CRUZ is for the 
House managers: 
Compare the bipartisanship in the Nixon, 
Clinton, 
and 
Trump 
impeachment 
pro-
ceedings. Specifically, how bipartisan was 
the vote in the House of Representatives to 
authorize and direct the House committees 
to begin formal impeachment inquiries for 
each of the three Presidents? 
Ms. Manager LOFGREN. Mr. Chief 
Justice and Senators, in the Nixon im-
peachment, you look back and think 
about the vote in the House Judiciary 
Committee. It ended up bipartisan, but 
it didn’t start that way. The parties 
were dug in, as parties are today. The 
Republicans and Democrats saw it dif-
ferently. But as the evidence emerged, 
a bipartisan consensus emerged on the 
committee, and a number of Repub-
licans—Tom 
Railsback, 
who 
just 
passed away, and Caldwell Butler, who 
loved Richard Nixon—he was a huge 
fan of Richard Nixon’s. But they 
couldn’t turn away from the evidence 
that their President had committed 
abuse of power, cheated the election, 
and they had to vote to impeach him. 
When it came to the Clinton im-
peachment, that was—again, it started 
out along very partisan lines, and it 
ended along partisan lines. I believe 
the reason why, as I said a short while 
earlier, was that we never had a high 
crime and misdemeanor. That was the 
problem. 
With Nixon, we had clear abuse of 
Presidential authority to upend the 
Constitution, scheme to cheat in an 
election, and Members of both parties 
voted to impeach. With Clinton, we had 
private misconduct. Yes, I would call it 
a crime because he lied about that 
under oath, but it wasn’t misuse of 
Presidential authority. As I said, any 
husband caught in an affair could have 
lied about it. And it didn’t involve the 
use of Presidential authority. So we 
never got beyond our partisan divisions 
on that. And many of us—and I will in-
clude myself—believed that it was 
being done for a partisan purpose, be-
cause it didn’t reach a high crime and 
misdemeanor. 
In the Trump case—and I will say I 
have been disappointed, because I serve 
with a number of Republicans in the 
House whom I like, whom I respect, 
whom I work with on legislation, and I

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S721 
January 30, 2020 
together. But it didn’t happen, much to 
my disappointment. 
I think you have a new opportunity 
here in the Senate. For one thing, this 
is a smaller body. You are, as has been 
mentioned, the greatest deliberative 
body on the planet. You have an oppor-
tunity to do something that we didn’t 
have a chance to do, which is to call 
firsthand witnesses and hear from 
them. 
A lot of things have happened since 
the impeachment articles were adopt-
ed. One of them was emails that have 
been released that we didn’t know 
about. 
It has been said by counsel that the 
Freedom of Information Act informa-
tion shows that if you follow the proc-
ess, you get information. No, they had 
to sue, and they are still in a lockdown 
fight over the Freedom of Information 
Act and redactions that were not prop-
er. So that is a big fight that is still 
going on, but we got information. 
But most tellingly, Mr. Bolton has 
now stepped forward and said he is 
willing to testify. He is willing to come 
here and testify under oath. And I 
think we can all learn something. As 
Mr. SCHIFF has mentioned, I think we 
can structure this in such a way that it 
would respect the Senate’s need to do 
other business, which we also do in the 
House. 
Let’s get that done, and let’s see if 
that kind of information can help the 
Senators come together, as happened 
in the House Judiciary Committee so 
many years ago when we dealt with the 
serious problem of Presidential mis-
conduct—abuse of power to cheat an 
election—when Richard Nixon shocked 
the Nation and ultimately had to re-
sign. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Ms. Manager. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Demo-
cratic leader is recognized. 
Mr. SCHUMER. I send a question to 
the desk for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator SCHUMER 
for the House managers: 
Many of our colleagues are worried that if 
we were able to bring witnesses and docu-
ments in the trial it would take too long. 
Mr. SCHIFF mentioned we could do deposi-
tions in one week. Please elaborate. What 
can you say that will reassure us that having 
witnesses and documents can be done in a 
short time, minimally impeding the business 
of the Senate? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I thank the 
Senator for the question. 
First of all, with respect to the docu-
ments that we subpoenaed and sought 
to get in the House, those documents 
have been collected. So that work has 
been done. We have been informed, for 
example, that the State Department 
documents have been collected. Those 
can readily be provided to the Senate 
for its consideration. 
With respect to witnesses, if we agree 
to a 1-week period to do depositions 
while you continue to conduct the 
business of the Senate, it doesn’t mean 
that we would have unlimited wit-
nesses during that week. We would 
have to decide on witnesses who are 
relevant and probative of the issues. 
Neither side would have an unlimited 
capacity to call endless witnesses. We 
would have a limited period of time, 
just as we had a limited period of time 
for our opening presentations and for 
this question and answer period. 
If there is any dispute over whether a 
witness is truly material or probative, 
that decision can be made by the Chief 
Justice in very short order. If there is 
a dispute as to whether a passage in a 
document is covered by an applicable 
privilege and if, for the first time, the 
White House would actually invoke a 
privilege, the Chief Justice can decide, 
is that properly made or is that merely 
an attempt to conceal crime or fraud? 
So this can be done very quickly. 
This can be done, I think, effectively. 
We have never sought to depose every 
witness under the face of the Sun. We 
have specified four in particular, who 
we think are particularly appropriate 
and relevant here. But we should be 
able to reach an agreement on con-
cluding that process within a week. So 
that is how we would contemplate it 
being done. 
We would make that proposal to our 
opposing counsel. It would be respect-
ful of your time. It would, I think, be a 
reasonable accommodation. And coun-
sel says that the Constitution man-
dates a reasonable accommodation. 
Well, let’s have a reasonable accommo-
dation here, and the reasonable accom-
modation could be to take 1 week to 
continue with the business of the Sen-
ate. We will do the depositions, and 
then we will come back, and we will 
present to you what the witnesses had 
to say in those depositions. That is how 
we contemplate the process would 
work. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I am about to send a question to the 
desk, but I am going to suggest that 
following the response to my question 
and one more Democratic question, we 
take a 45-minute break for dinner. 
So I send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sure there 
is no objection. 
The question from the majority lead-
er is for the counsel to the President: 
Would you please respond to the question 
on bipartisanship by Senator ALEXANDER and 
any assertions the House managers made in 
response to any of the previous questions? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, majority leader, thank you for 
that question. 
In response to Senator ALEXANDER, 
your question, in the Nixon case, the 
authorizing resolution—this is in the 
House to authorize the inquiry—was 
passed by a vote of 410 to 4. Four hun-
dred and ten voted in favor of the in-
quiry; only four voted against. Two 
hundred and thirty-two Democrats, 177 
Republicans, and 1 Independent voted 
in favor. 
In the Clinton authorizing resolu-
tion—this was H. Res. 581—they au-
thorized just the beginning of the in-
quiry. It passed by a vote of 258 to 176 
Now, 31 Democrats joined 227 Repub-
licans voting in favor of authorizing 
that inquiry. That was substantial bi-
partisan support to authorize the in-
quiry. 
In this case, H. Res. 660, which was 
passed on October 31, had bipartisan 
opposition. The votes in favor of the 
resolution were 231 Democrats and 1 
Independent. The opposition was all 
Republicans, 194, plus 2 Democrats vot-
ing against. 
In terms of other assertions that 
have been made, there are just a couple 
of points I wanted to touch on. There 
has been a lot said about—House man-
agers have suggested that counsel for 
the President have argued that the 
President could do anything he wants 
now—solicit any foreign interference in 
any election. If he thinks it will help 
him get elected, that is OK, and that is 
the theory of the case. That is abso-
lutely false. That is a gross distortion 
of what has been presented, and let me 
make a couple of points about that. 
There have been questions about the 
campaign finance laws, and one narrow 
point that we have made in response to 
specific questions about the campaign 
finance laws is simply that informa-
tion—limited information—being pre-
sented to a party is not a contribution, 
a thing of value under the campaign fi-
nance laws. And that is not just my 
conclusion; that is what the Mueller 
report said. When the Mueller report 
looked into this, it said: ‘‘No judicial 
decision has treated the voluntary pro-
vision of uncompensated opposition re-
search or similar information as a 
thing of value that could amount to a 
contribution under campaign-finance 
law.’’ That is volume I, page 187. So 
that is a limited point. 
The bigger point: The suggestion has 
been 
made, 
because 
of 
Professor 
Dershowitz’s comments, that the the-
ory that the President’s counsel is ad-
vancing is the President can do any-
thing he wants. If he thinks it will ad-
vance his reelection, any quid pro quo, 
anything he wants, anything goes. 
That is not true. Professor Dershowitz 
today issued a statement to show that 
that was an exaggeration of what he 
was saying. 
But let me make an even more nar-
row point. Aside from what Professor 
Dershowitz was saying the other night 
and explaining in abstract and hypo-
thetical terms and academic terms, we 
have a specific case here. And the spe-
cific case here is the one that has been 
framed by the House managers. And 
the defects in that case and their the-
ory of the case are, there is abuse of 
power that involves no allegation of a 
crime whatsoever and no allegation of 
a violation of established law. Instead, 
the theory that you can take action 
that, on its face, is objectively permis-
sible under the powers of the President 
and determine that it is going to be

treated as impeachable and impermis-
sible solely on an inquiry into subjec-
tive motives—that is what the House 
Judiciary Committee report says. That 
is a theory that is infinitely malleable. 
It provides no standard—no real stand-
ard at all. And that was one core point 
Professor Dershowitz was making, that 
it is tantamount to impeachment for 
maladministration. 
The other point I will make is they 
set the standard for themselves with 
respect to investigations. They have to 
establish, in order to establish their 
bad motive, that there is not a scintilla 
of evidence—there is nothing that you 
can look at that would suggest any 
possible legitimate national interest in 
inquiring 
into 
2016 
election 
inter-
ference or the Biden and Burisma af-
fair. They can’t possibly meet that 
standard. It is overdetermined that 
there is a legitimate policy interest in 
at least raising a question about those 
things. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. COONS. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Delaware. 
Mr. COONS. On behalf of myself and 
Senator KLOBUCHAR, I send a question 
to the desk, addressed to the Presi-
dent’s counsel and the House man-
agers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The House will go first in answering 
the question from Senators COONS and 
KLOBUCHAR: 
Mr. Sekulow said earlier that the Presi-
dent’s Counsel would expect to call their own 
witnesses in this trial if Mr. Bolton or others 
are called by the House managers. Can you 
tell the Senate if any of those witnesses 
would have first-hand knowledge of the 
charges against the President and his ac-
tions? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Justice 
and Senators, there certainly are wit-
nesses that the President could call 
with firsthand information. I don’t 
know that they are—the witnesses that 
they have described so far, their posi-
tion is, apparently, if you are the 
chairman of a committee doing an in-
vestigation, that makes you a relevant 
witness. It doesn’t—or you all become 
witnesses in your own investigations. 
They want to call Joe Biden as a wit-
ness. Joe Biden can’t tell us why mili-
tary aid was withheld from Ukraine 
while it was fighting a war. Joe Biden 
can’t tell us why President Zelensky 
couldn’t get in the door of the White 
House while the Russian Foreign Min-
ister could. He is not in a position to 
answer those questions. He can’t tell us 
whether this rises to an impeachable 
abuse of power, although he probably 
has opinions on the subject. 
But are there witnesses they could 
call? Absolutely. They have said Mick 
Mulvaney issued a statement saying: 
The President never said what I had 
said he had said earlier. Well, if that is 
the case, then why don’t they call Mick 
Mulvaney? He should be on their wit-
ness list. If Secretary Pompeo has evi-
dence that there was a policy basis to 
withhold the aid and it was discussed, 
well, then, why don’t they call him? 
That is a relevant fact witness. 
They don’t want to allow the Chief 
Justice to decide issues of materiality 
because they know what they are try-
ing to do involves witnesses that don’t 
shed light on the charges against the 
President. They do satisfy the appetite 
of their client, but they don’t have pro-
bative value to the issues here. 
So, yes, there are witnesses. Now, the 
reason they are not on the President’s 
witness list is because if they were 
truthful under oath, they would in-
criminate the President. Otherwise, 
they would be begging to have Mick 
Mulvaney come testify; otherwise, they 
would be begging to have the head of 
OMB, who helped administer the freeze 
on behalf of the President: Let’s bring 
him in. He will tell you it was com-
pletely innocent. It was all about bur-
den-sharing. 
So why don’t they want the head of 
OMB in? Why don’t they want their 
own people in? Because their own peo-
ple will incriminate the President. 
But there is no shortage of relevant, 
probative witnesses. They just don’t 
want you to hear what they have to 
say. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, so besides the fact that Mr. 
SCHUMER said—and it is on page 675 of 
the transcript—that we can call any 
witnesses we want, Mr. SCHIFF just said 
we don’t really get—we can call their 
witnesses. That is what he said. We can 
call their witnesses because, under 
their theory, if we wanted to talk to 
the whistleblower, even in a secure set-
ting to find out if he, in fact, may have 
worked for the Vice President or may 
have worked on Ukraine or may have 
been in communication with the staff, 
that is irrelevant. 
We can’t talk to Joe Biden or Hunter 
Biden because that is irrelevant—ex-
cept the conversation that is the sub-
ject matter of this inquiry, the phone 
call transcript that you selectively uti-
lized, has a reference to Hunter Biden. 
The conversation with Burisma, they 
raised it for about a half a day, saying 
there was nothing there. Well, let me 
find out through cross-examination. 
But I just think of the irony of this— 
before we go to dinner—that we could 
call anyone we want, except for wit-
nesses we want, but we can call their 
witnesses that they want. 
Remember we said ‘‘the fruit of the 
poisonous tree’’? It is still the fruit of 
the poisonous tree. It doesn’t get bet-
ter with age, as I said. 
This idea that this is going to be a 
fair process—call the witnesses they 
want; don’t call the witnesses you want 
because they are irrelevant. They may 
be irrelevant to them. They are not ir-
relevant to the President, and they are 
not irrelevant to our case. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
RECESS 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Majority 
Leader, I understand we have 45 min-
utes? 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
we do indeed. 
There being no objection, at 6:39 
p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of 
Impeachment, recessed until 7:37 p.m.; 
whereupon 
the 
Senate 
reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE. 
Senators, 
please be seated. 
The Senate will come to order. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself, Senators 
MCCONNELL, HOEVEN, and WICKER. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator GRASSLEY 
and the other Senators is addressed to 
counsel for the President: 
During President Clinton’s impeachment 
trial, he argued that ‘‘no civil officer—no 
President, no judge, no cabinet member—has 
ever been impeached by so narrow a margin 
. . . [and] that the closeness and partisan di-
vision of the vote reflected the constitu-
tionally dubious nature of the charges 
against him.’’ President Trump has raised 
similar concerns during these proceedings 
and argues that the lack of bipartisan con-
sensus highlights the partisan nature of the 
charges. Are the President’s concerns well- 
founded? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
I think the concerns are very well- 
founded. I think that they are concerns 
that echo back to our founding, when 
Alexander Hamilton warned in Fed-
eralist No. 65 precisely against partisan 
impeachments. A partisan impeach-
ment is one of the greatest dangers 
that the Framers saw in the impeach-
ment power. And in Federalist No. 65, 
Hamilton specifically said that im-
peachments could become ‘‘persecution 
of an intemperate or designing major-
ity in the House of Representatives,’’ 
and that is what we have in this case. 
In fact, there was bipartisan opposi-
tion to the Articles of Impeachment 
here in the House. So this is one of 
the—it is the most divisive sort of im-
peachment that could be brought here, 
and it reflects very poorly on the proc-
ess that was run in the House, which 
had not had bipartisan support, and the 
charges that were ultimately adopted 
in the House, because it is a purely par-
tisan impeachment. 
And I think that that is important to 
bear in mind also, that the House man-
agers themselves and some of the Mem-
bers of this Chamber, at the time of the 
Clinton impeachment, warned very elo-
quently 
against 
partisan 
impeach-
ments. They recognized that a partisan 
impeachment would not be valid, that 
it would do grave damage to our polit-
ical community, to our polity, to the 
country. It would create deep divisions

January 30, 2020 
that would last for years. And in the 
Clinton impeachment, they made those 
warnings when it was not even arising 
in the context of an election year. 
Now we have a partisan impeach-
ment—as we have pointed out—when 
there is an election only 9 months 
away, and it will be perceived, and is 
perceived by many in the country, as 
simply an attempt to interfere with 
the election and to prevent the voters 
from having their choice of who they 
want to be President for the next 4 
years. 
And the House managers have said: 
We can’t allow the voters to decide be-
cause we can’t be sure it will be a fair 
election. That can’t be the way we ap-
proach 
democracy 
in 
the 
United 
States. We have to respect the ability 
of the voters to take in information, 
because all the information is out now. 
They have had plenty of opportunity, 
with the process that they ran in the 
House, to make all the information 
public that they want and to be able to 
make their accusations against the 
President. We think they have been 
disapproved, and the voters should be 
able to decide. 
And the most important thing, the 
greatest danger from this partisan im-
peachment, I believe, is the one that 
Minority 
Leader 
SCHUMER
warned 
about back in 1998, which is that, once 
we start down the road of purely par-
tisan impeachments, once we start to 
normalize that process and make it all 
right to have a purely partisan im-
peachment, especially in an election 
year, then we have just turned im-
peachment into a partisan political 
tool, and it will be used again and 
again and again and more frequently 
and more frequently. And that is not a 
process—that is not a future—for the 
country that this Chamber should ac-
cept. 
Instead, this Chamber should put an 
end to the growing pattern towards 
partisan impeachments in this coun-
try, put an end to that practice and de-
finitively make clear that a purely par-
tisan impeachment not based on ade-
quate charges, not based on charges 
that meet the constitutional standard 
will not get any consideration in this 
Chamber and will be rejected. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Maryland. 
Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chief Justice, 
on behalf of myself and Senator KLO-
BUCHAR, I send a question to the desk 
directed to both parties. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator VAN HOL-
LEN is to both parties. The President’s 
counsel will go first: 
In his response to an earlier question this 
evening, Mr. Sekulow cited individuals like 
the Bidens as being ‘‘not irrelevant to our 
case.’’ Are you opposed to having the Chief 
Justice make the initial determinations re-
garding the relevance of documents and wit-
nesses, particularly as the Senate could dis-
agree with the Chief Justice’s ruling by a 
majority vote? 
The President’s counsel is first. 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, again, to make our position 
clear, we think, constitutionally, that 
would not be the appropriate way to 
go. 
Again, no disrespect to the Chief Jus-
tice at all, who is presiding here as the 
Presiding Officer, but our view is that, 
if there are issues that have to be re-
solved on constitutional matters, that 
it should be done in the appropriate 
way. 
You have Senate rules that govern 
that, as to what you would do, and 
then there is—you know, if litigation 
were to be necessary for a particular 
issue, that would have to be looked at. 
But this idea that we can short circuit 
the system, which is what they have 
been doing for 3 months, is not some-
thing we are willing to go with. 
I have said that. I said it all day yes-
terday. And, again, no disrespect to the 
Senator’s question, but we are just— 
that is not a position that we will ac-
cept as far as moving these proceedings 
forward. 
Thank you. 
Mr. 
Manager 
SCHIFF. 
Senators, 
counsel for the President says that 
would not be constitutionally appro-
priate. Why not? Where is it prohibited 
in the Constitution that in an impeach-
ment trial, upon the agreement of the 
parties, the Chief Justice cannot re-
solve issues of materiality of the wit-
nesses? Of course that is permitted by 
the Constitution. 
Now, counsel earlier said that the 
House managers want to decide on 
which witnesses the President should 
be able to call; we want them to call 
our witnesses. Well, you would think 
that Mick Mulvaney, the White House 
Chief of Staff, would be their witness. 
If indeed he supports what the Presi-
dent is claiming, if indeed he is willing 
to say under oath what he is willing to 
say in a press statement, you would 
think he would be their witness. 
But I am not saying that we get to 
decide. That is not the proposal here. 
The proposal is we take a week; the 
Senate goes about its business; we do 
depositions. The witnesses are not wit-
nesses on the President’s behalf that 
we get a decision on as House man-
agers; but, rather, that we entrust the 
Chief Justice of the United States to 
make a fair and impartial decision as 
to whether a witness is material or 
not, whether a witness has relevant 
facts or not, or whether a witness is 
simply being brought before this body 
for the purposes of retribution—in the 
case of the whistleblower—or to smear 
the Bidens without material purpose 
relevant to these proceedings. 
We are not asking that you accept 
our judgment on that. We are pro-
posing that the Chief Justice make 
that decision. And I think the reason, 
of course, that they don’t want the 
Chief Justice to make that decision, as 
I indicated the other night, is not be-
cause they don’t trust the Chief Jus-
tice to be fair. It is because they fear 
the Chief Justice will be fair. And I 
think that tells you everything you 
need to know about the lack of good 
faith when it comes to the arguments 
they make about why they went to 
court, why they refused to comply with 
any subpoenas, why they refused to 
provide any documents, why they are 
here before you saying that the House 
managers must sue to get witnesses 
and they are in court on the same day 
saying you can’t sue to get witnesses. 
This is why they don’t want the Chief 
Justice to make that decision, because 
they know the witnesses they are re-
questing are for purposes of retribution 
or distraction. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk on behalf of my-
self and Senator CRUZ. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators TILLIS and 
CRUZ is for the House managers: 
You have based your case on the propo-
sition that it was utterly ‘‘baseless’’ and a 
‘‘sham’’ to ask for an investigation into pos-
sible corruption of Burisma and the Bidens. 
Chris Heinz, the step-son of then-Secretary 
of State John Kerry, emailed Kerry’s Chief 
of Staff that ‘‘Apparently, Devon and Hunter 
both joined the board of Burisma and a press 
release went out today. I can’t speak to why 
they decided to, but there was no investment 
by our firm in their company.’’ Heinz subse-
quently terminated his business relationship 
with Devon Archer and Hunter Biden be-
cause ‘‘working with Burisma is unaccept-
able,’’ and showed a ‘‘lack of judgment.’’ 
Do you agree with Chris Heinz that work-
ing with Burisma was ‘‘unacceptable’’? Did 
John Kerry or Joe Biden agree with Chris 
Heinz? If not, why not? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The reason 
why Joe Biden is not material to these 
proceedings, the reason why this is a 
baseless smear is that the issue is not 
whether Hunter Biden should have sat 
on that board or not sat on that board. 
The issue is not whether Hunter Biden 
was properly compensated or improp-
erly compensated or whether he speaks 
Ukrainian or he doesn’t speak Ukrain-
ian. 
What the President asked for was an 
investigation of Joe Biden, and the 
smear against Joe Biden is that he 
sought to fire a prosecutor because he 
was trying to protect his son. I guess 
that is the nature of the allegation. 
And that is a baseless smear. 
As we demonstrated—as the un-
equivocal testimony in the House dem-
onstrated, when the Vice President 
sought the dismissal of a corrupt and 
incompetent prosecutor, it had nothing 
to do with Hunter Biden’s position on 
the board. It had everything to do with 
the fact that the State Department, 
our allies, the International Monetary 
Fund were in unanimous agreement 
that this prosecutor was corrupt. And 
the uncontradicted testimony was also

corruption prosecutions going forward, 
not that it would decrease them. 
So the sham is this: The sham is that 
Joe Biden did something wrong when 
he followed United States policy, when 
he did what he was asked to do by our 
European allies, when he did what he 
was asked to do by international finan-
cial institutions. 
And the other sham is the Russian 
propaganda 
sham 
that 
this 
CrowdStrike—kooky conspiracy theory 
that the Ukrainians, not the Russians, 
hacked the DNC and that someone 
whisked the server away to Ukraine to 
hide it. That is Russian intelligence 
propaganda, and yes, it is a sham. And 
it is worse than a sham. It is a Russian 
propaganda coup is what it is. Thank 
God, Putin says, that they are not 
talking 
about 
Russian 
interference 
anymore; they are talking about the 
Ukrainian interference. 
Now, counsel says: Well, isn’t it pos-
sible that two countries interfered? 
But you heard what our own Director 
of the FBI, Christopher Wray, said: 
There is no evidence of Ukrainian in-
terference in our election. There is no 
evidence. So, yes, I think we can cite 
the FBI Director for the proposition 
that that is a sham. And that is why— 
that is why—we refer to it as such. 
But at the end of the day, what this 
is all about is the President using the 
power of his office, abusing the power 
of that office to engage in soliciting in-
vestigations—and actually just the an-
nouncement of them. If the President 
thought there was so much merit 
there, then why was it that he just 
needed their announcement? 
And what is more, as counsel just 
conceded 
before 
the 
break, 
Rudy 
Giuliani was not pursuing the policy of 
the United States. OK. If it wasn’t the 
policy of the United States, then what 
was it? If it wasn’t the policy to pursue 
an investigation of the Bidens, then 
what was it? 
It was a ‘‘domestic political errand’’ 
is what it was. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. Chief Justice, on 
behalf of Senator MENENDEZ, Senator 
BROWN, and myself, I send a question to 
the desk for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senators 
WYDEN, 
MENENDEZ, 
and 
BROWN ask the House managers: 
The President’s counsel has argued that 
the President’s actions are based on his de-
sire to root out corruption. However, new re-
porting indicates that Attorney General 
Barr and former National Security Advisor 
Bolton shared concerns that the President 
was granting personal favors to autocratic 
foreign leaders like President Erdogan of 
Turkey. The President has also acknowl-
edged his private business interests in the 
country like Trump Towers Istanbul. The 
Treasury Department has not denied that 
the President directed Treasury and the De-
partment of Justice to intervene in the 
criminal investigation of Halkbank, the 
Turkish state-owned bank, which has been 
accused of a scheme to evade Iranian sanc-
tions. Has the President engaged in a pattern 
of conduct in which he places his personal 
and political interests above the national se-
curity interests of the United States? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. I also want to thank 
the Senators, again, for your hospi-
tality and for listening to both sides as 
we have endeavored to answer your 
questions. Thank you for that ques-
tion. 
I think, first and foremost, there has 
been a troubling pattern of possible 
conflicts of interest that we have seen 
from the beginning of this administra-
tion through this moment, but the al-
legation here related to the abuse of 
power charge is that, in this specific 
instance, the President tried to cheat 
by soliciting foreign interference in an 
American election by trying to gin up 
phony investigations against a polit-
ical opponent. 
Now, what counsel for the President 
has said is that what the President was 
really interested in is corruption, that 
he is an anti-corruption crusader. For 
you to believe the President’s nar-
rative, you have to conclude that he is 
an anti-corruption crusader. Perhaps 
his domestic record is part of what 
Senators can reasonably consider, but 
let’s look at the facts of the central 
charge here. 
The President had two calls with 
President Zelensky, on April 21 and on 
July 25. In both instances, he did not 
mention the word ‘‘corruption’’ once. 
Released the transcripts. The word 
‘‘corruption’’ was not mentioned by 
Donald Trump once. 
We also know that in May of last 
year President Trump’s own Depart-
ment of Defense indicated that the new 
Ukrainian Government had met all 
necessary preconditions for the receipt 
of the military aid, including the im-
plementation of anti-corruption re-
forms. That is President Trump’s De-
partment of Defense saying there is no 
corruption concern as it relates to the 
release of the aid. 
Now, I think we can all acknowledge, 
as the President’s counsel indicated, 
that there was a general corruption 
challenge with Ukraine. I think the 
exact quote from Mr. Purpura was: 
‘‘Since the fall of the Soviet Union, 
Ukraine has suffered from one of the 
worst environments for corruption in 
the world.’’ 
Certainly I believe that that is the 
case, but here is the key question: Why 
did President Trump wait until 2019 to 
pretend as if he wanted to do some-
thing about corruption? Let’s explore. 
Did Ukraine have a corruption prob-
lem in 2017, generally? The answer is 
yes. Did President Trump dislike for-
eign aid in 2017? The answer is yes. 
What did President Trump do about 
these alleged concerns in 2017? The an-
swer is nothing. 
Under the same exact conditions that 
the President now claims motivated 
him to seek a phony political inves-
tigation against the Bidens and place a 
hold on the money, the President did 
nothing. He did not seek an investiga-
tion into the Bidens in 2017. He did not 
put a hold on the aid in 2017. But the 
Trump administration oversaw $560 
million in military and security aid to 
Ukraine in 2017. 
In 2018, the same conditions existed. 
If President Trump is truly an anti- 
corruption crusader—but what hap-
pened in 2018? He didn’t seek an inves-
tigation into the Bidens. He didn’t put 
a hold on the aid. Rather, the Trump 
administration oversaw $620 million in 
military and security aid to Ukraine, 
which brings us to this moment. 
Why the sudden interest in Burisma, 
in the Bidens, in alleged corruption 
concerns about Ukraine? What changed 
in 2019? What changed is that Joe 
Biden announced his candidacy. The 
President was concerned with that can-
didacy. Polls had him losing to the 
former Vice President, and he was de-
termined to stop Joe Biden by trying 
to cheat in the election, smear him, so-
licit foreign interference in 2020. 
That is an abuse of power. That is 
corrupt. That is wrong. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Maine. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself, Senator RUBIO, and Senator 
RISCH. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators COLLINS, 
RUBIO, and RISCH is addressed to the 
House managers: 
The House of Representatives withdrew its 
subpoena to compel Charles Kupperman’s 
testimony. Why did the House withdraw the 
Kupperman subpoena? Why didn’t the House 
pursue its legal remedies to enforce its sub-
poenas? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, I 
thank you for the question. 
When we—our practice in the House 
was to invite witnesses to come volun-
tarily; if they refused, to give them a 
subpoena. 
In 
the 
case 
of 
Dr. 
Kupperman, he refused to come in vol-
untarily, and we subpoenaed him. 
Almost instantly upon receipt of the 
subpoena, a lengthy complaint was 
filed in court where he sought to chal-
lenge that subpoena. Interestingly, and 
contrary to, I think, what you are 
hearing from the President’s counsel 
here today, the House took the posi-
tion that a witness cannot challenge— 
does not have standing to challenge a 
congressional subpoena. 
We were joined, by the way, in that 
position by the Justice Department, 
which also said that Dr. Kupperman 
didn’t have jurisdiction to challenge or 
get a declaratory judgment as to the 
validity of the subpoena. 
So, in that litigation, we were often 
on the same page as the Justice De-
partment. But more meaningful to us, 
we were simply not going to engage in 
a yearslong process of delay to get the 
answers that we needed. 
We proposed to Dr. Kupperman’s 
counsel that if, as you claim, this is 
really about just wanting to get a 
court blessing, there is a willingness to

January 30, 2020 
come forward, but we just want to 
make sure that it is appropriate that 
we do so, if you are sincere about that, 
there is already a case that has been 
filed, the McGahn case, that is about to 
be decided. Let’s agree to be bound by 
what 
conclusion 
Judge 
Jackson 
reaches in that case. And their answer 
was no. 
And, indeed, that opinion would come 
out shortly thereafter. That opinion 
said, this claim of absolute immunity 
is absolute nonsense, and there is no 
precedent for it in the 250 years of ju-
risprudence on this subject. 
So we went back to Dr. Kupperman, 
and, of course, Dr. Kupperman said: No, 
we would like to get our own judicial 
opinion. 
Now, had we gone to fruition, even 
though we don’t believe—and it would 
have created a bad precedent that they 
have standing to challenge subpoenas 
that way. Had they lost, they would 
have gone to the court of appeals and 
the Supreme Court. They would have 
come back to the district court. And 
now no longer arguing absolute immu-
nity because that would have been, we 
believe, defeated, they would make 
claims of executive privilege, and they 
would litigate those up through the 
court of appeals and the Supreme 
Court. 
We knew that course because we are 
in it with Don McGahn. Nine months 
after he was subpoenaed, we are still 
litigating it. And they are in Court 
saying Congress shouldn’t do what they 
are saying that we should do before 
this body. 
So that is why we withdrew the sub-
poena. We were not going to go 
through that exercise. 
You have to ask the question, I 
think, why did Fiona Hill feel that she 
could come and testify? She worked for 
Dr. Kupperman. Why was she willing to 
show the courage to come and testify 
when her boss wasn’t? 
There is not a good answer to that 
question, but I am awfully glad that 
she did because, without her, we would 
be that much less knowledgeable about 
this President’s scheme. 
So that was the history of the 
Kupperman subpoena. Likewise, John 
Bolton, who has the same counsel, told 
us if we subpoenaed him, he would sue. 
Now, why is it that he is willing to 
testify now, and he wasn’t willing to 
testify before the House? You should 
ask him that question. But that was 
the predicament we faced. And in our 
view, a President should not be able to 
defeat an investigation into his wrong-
doing by endlessly litigating the mat-
ter in court, particularly when they 
are in court saying you can’t use the 
court to enforce your subpoenas. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. I send a question to the 
desk for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator HIRONO is 
for the House managers: 
Can you talk about what has happened to 
whistleblowers when they have been outed 
against their will? What are the con-
sequences of revealing their identity, par-
ticularly when we have a President who has 
tried to bully and threaten impeachment 
witnesses? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, I 
don’t know that we can give you exam-
ples of whistleblowers who were the 
subject of retaliation, although I have 
no doubt that there are many. We can 
seek by the latter part of this evening 
to get a list of some of the whistle-
blowers that have confronted retalia-
tion. 
But I—this does give me an oppor-
tunity to speak a little more—in a 
more fulsome way about a point I made 
earlier about the unique importance of 
whistleblowers in the intelligence com-
munity. 
Our area of intelligence is unique in 
this respect. If you are a whistleblower 
who wants to blow the whistle on a 
fraudulent contract in a transportation 
project, you can go public. If you are 
blowing the whistle on misconduct in 
the area of housing, you can go public. 
You can have a press conference, and 
you can declare the wrongdoing that 
you have seen. 
If you are a whistleblower in the in-
telligence community, however, you 
cannot go public. You have no recourse 
to bring to the public’s attention 
wrongdoing, except one of really two 
vehicles. You can go to an Intelligence 
Committee or you can go to the inspec-
tor general. 
And in this area, where our hearings 
are in closed session, where you don’t 
have outside stakeholders that can 
point out the flaws in what an agency 
is representing, if you are on the 
Transportation Committee and some-
one comes in and they say: This high- 
speed rail project is on time and under 
budget, you have outside validators 
and stakeholders that can say that is 
just not true. 
In the intel world where our hearings 
are in closed session, there are not out-
side stakeholders that are listening, 
that can hold those agencies to ac-
count. And so we are uniquely depend-
ent when there is wrongdoing on two 
things: self-reporting by the agencies 
and the willingness of people of good 
faith to come forward and blow the 
whistle. 
And we do injury to that when we ex-
pose those whistleblowers to retalia-
tion. I don’t think any of us would have 
imagined a circumstance in which a 
President of the United States before 
now would have called a whistleblower 
a traitor or a spy or suggested that 
people that blow the whistle on his 
wrongdoing are traitors and spies, and 
we should treat them as we used to 
treat traitors and spies. 
I don’t think we could have imagined 
a circumstance where a President of 
the United States would have told a 
foreign leader that the U.S. Ambas-
sador—our anti-corruption champion 
in Ukraine—was ‘‘going to go through 
some things.’’ I don’t think we could 
have imagined that happening before 
this Presidency. And sometimes you 
just have to step back and realize just 
how striking and abhorrent this is and 
what a risk it is to civility, to decency, 
to our institutions. 
We have become inured to it through 
endless repetition of attacks on anyone 
who will stand up to this President. 
And, of course, the risk is—the very 
reason we have a whistleblower protec-
tion, the very reason why whistle-
blowers should enjoy a right of ano-
nymity, is that in the absence of that, 
misconduct and wrongdoing will pro-
liferate. If there is not a mechanism for 
people lawfully to expose wrongdoing, 
you can bet that wrongdoing is going 
to increase. And that is why there have 
been great champions, like Senator 
GRASSLEY, of whistleblower protec-
tions, Senator BURR and Senator WAR-
NER, and many others, because we all 
understand—at 
least 
we 
did 
here-
tofore—the vital importance and con-
tributions that are made by American 
citizens who bring wrongdoing to our 
attention. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Missouri. 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk on behalf of my-
self, Senators HAWLEY, WICKER, and 
CAPITO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators BLUNT, 
HAWLEY, WICKER, and CAPITO
is ad-
dressed to counsel for the President: 
What responsibility does the president 
have to safeguard the use of taxpayer dollars 
for foreign aid and work to root out corrup-
tion? 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice and Members of 
the Senate. 
The President has an important re-
sponsibility to safeguard taxpayer dol-
lars that are used in foreign aid or used 
anywhere, frankly, and to root out cor-
ruption. Now, it is no secret that Presi-
dent Trump, from the beginning, from 
the time he came down the escalator, 
has been committed to ensuring that 
American taxpayer dollars are used ap-
propriately—are 
used 
appropriately. 
And if they are going to foreign coun-
tries, he wants to make sure that they 
are used wisely. And there is ample evi-
dence of that—ample evidence of that. 
I don’t think that is even disputed or 
disputable. And he is fulfilling that ob-
ligation. 
The other point that he makes re-
peatedly is that if we are helping coun-
tries around the world, other countries 
should help us help them. We use the 
word ‘‘burden-sharing.’’ What does that 
mean? ‘‘Burden-sharing’’ means that if 
American taxpayers are going to help 
with a problem in a country around the 
world—and we do, and we do a lot. We 
do it to the tune of billions and billions

of dollars. When here in our country, 
we need to fix our roads; we need to fix 
our bridges. So if we are going to take 
money away from those important 
projects here in America that come 
from the hard-earned dollars of tax-
payers, why can’t other countries help 
us? That is called burden-sharing. It is 
also called fairness. So he has that ob-
ligation, and every day he fulfills that 
obligation. 
Let me make another point in re-
sponse to Senator WARREN’s question. 
The most important thing, in terms of 
the fairness of this proceeding—and 
that is why I have quoted repeatedly. I 
haven’t played the videos over and over 
again, but you remember them—the 
wise words, the true words of the 
Democrats in the Clinton impeachment 
years. And the only point the Amer-
ican people understand—they under-
stand it, and I think everyone in this 
body understands it; that there can’t 
be one standard for one political party 
and another for the other political 
party. That is important. Those words 
should be applied here. We can’t have a 
standard that changes depending on 
what somebody thinks about political 
issues. 
In order to be fair, the same standard 
has to be applied, regardless of your 
party. So that is the critical issue here. 
And that is the bedrock principle, not 
a double standard for justice in the 
Senate but one standard—the true 
standard, the standard that has been 
articulated eloquently by Democrats 
over and over again in the Clinton pro-
ceedings. That is the standard that is 
right. That is the standard that we ask 
for, regardless of political party. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. KING. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Maine. 
Mr. KING. I am sending a question to 
the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator KING 
asks the President’s counsel: 
Would it be permissible for a President to 
inform the Prime Minister of Israel that he 
was holding congressional appropriated mili-
tary aid unless the Prime Minister promised 
to come to the United States and publicly 
charge his opponent with antisemitism in 
the midst of an election campaign? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senator, thank you for the 
question, but the question really has 
nothing do with this case. I mean, it 
seems to be trying to get at the most 
extreme hypothetical related to a mis-
interpretation 
of 
what 
Professor 
Dershowitz was saying the other night. 
It is totally irrelevant here. 
The charges that have been brought 
here, articulated in the Articles of Im-
peachment, are based on a theory of 
abuse of power; that the House Demo-
crats, the House managers have made 
clear depends for them to make their 
case to establish that when the Presi-
dent raised two issues on the call with 
President Zelensky of Ukraine, he 
raised the 2016 election interference, 
and he mentioned the Biden and 
Burisma incident; that there was not 
any legitimate public policy or foreign 
policy interest in mentioning those 
things to the President of Ukraine. 
That is the standard they have set for 
themselves. It is on page 5 of the House 
Judiciary Committee report, and it is 
on page 4. They say they have to show 
it is a sham investigation, and I think 
it is on page 6 they say it is a bogus in-
vestigation. That is their standard be-
cause they know they have to establish 
that there is no legitimate public pol-
icy interest at all in mentioning those 
in order to come anywhere close to 
being able to assert something that 
could be a wrongful conduct by the 
President, because if there is a legiti-
mate interest, if there is something 
there that is worth asking, they don’t 
have a case. And that is why they have 
tried to tell you again and again there 
is not a scintilla of evidence. 
This is really pretty preposterous, for 
the House managers to come and say, 
particularly with respect to the Biden- 
Burisma incident, there can’t be any 
legitimate interest in raising that 
question because it has all been de-
bunked. And the question has been 
asked: Where was it was debunked? By 
whom was it debunked? Who conducted 
that investigation? Where is the report 
from that investigation? Who estab-
lished that there is nothing there? 
There is no such report. They have 
been asked; they haven’t been able to 
cite it. There has been no such inves-
tigation. 
But what do we know? We do know 
that every witness who was asked 
about it said, at a minimum, there was 
an appearance of a conflict of interest. 
We do know that these two members of 
the 
Obama 
administration—Amos 
Hochstein and Deputy Assistant Sec-
retary of State Kent—raised the issue 
of the conflict of interest with Vice 
President Biden’s Office. We know that 
Chris Heinz, the stepson of Secretary of 
State Kerry, who had been a business 
partner with Hunter Biden, broke off 
his business ties with him because 
Hunter Biden took a seat on the board 
of Burisma. 
So to say that there is nothing that 
could possibly merit asking a question 
about that is utterly disingenuous. It 
can’t be said with a straight face. 
Every witness that was asked about it 
said that there was something, at 
least, that gave the appearance of a 
conflict of interest. There hasn’t been 
any investigation to debunk this the-
ory. There hasn’t been any inquiry to 
find out if there is ‘‘there’’ there or 
not. 
It doesn’t have to do, as Manager 
SCHIFF was suggesting, just with, well, 
why was Hunter Biden on the board, or 
were they paying him? It is the whole 
situation—the whole situation of, all of 
a sudden, he is put on the board at the 
time when his father was put in charge 
of Ukraine policy. And there are peo-
ple—there were witnesses who testified 
in the House proceedings that it ap-
peared like Burisma was trying to 
whitewash their reputation by putting 
people with connections on their board. 
And then there is the prosecutor being 
fired. 
It is just not reasonable to say that 
no one could possibly say: That looks 
fishy. There is something maybe that 
somebody should look into there. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Alaska. 
Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator MURKOWSKI asks counsel for 
the President: 
You explain that Ambassador Sondland 
and Senator JOHNSON both said the President 
explicitly denied that he was looking for a 
quid pro quo with Ukraine. The reporting on 
Ambassador Bolton’s book suggests the 
President told Bolton directly that the aid 
would not be released until Ukraine an-
nounced the investigations the President de-
sired. This dispute about material facts 
weighs in favor of calling additional wit-
nesses with direct knowledge. Why should 
this body not call Ambassador Bolton? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I think the primary consideration 
here is to understand that the House 
could 
have 
pursued 
Ambassador 
Bolton. The House considered whether 
or not they would try to have him 
come testify. They chose not to sub-
poena him. 
This all goes back to the most impor-
tant consideration, I think, that this 
Chamber has before it in some ways, 
especially on this threshold issue of 
whether there should be witnesses or 
not. It has to do with the precedent 
that is established here for what kind 
of impeachment proceeding this body 
will accept from now going forward, be-
cause whatever is accepted in this case 
becomes the new normal for every im-
peachment proceeding in the future. 
And it will do grave damage to this 
body as an institution to say that the 
proceedings in the House don’t have to 
really be complete. You don’t have to 
subpoena the witnesses that you think 
are necessary to prove your case. You 
don’t really have to put it all together 
before you bring the package here. 
When you are impeaching the Presi-
dent of the United States—the gravest 
impeachment that they could possibly 
consider—you don’t have to do all of 
that work before you get to this insti-
tution. 
Instead, when you come to this 
Chamber, it can be kind of half-baked, 
not finished—we need other witnesses, 
and we want this Chamber to do the in-
vestigation that wasn’t done in the 
House of Representatives. And then 
this Chamber will have to be issuing 
the subpoenas and dealing with that. 
And that is not the way this Chamber 
should allow impeachments to be pre-
sented to it. 
We have heard—there was some ex-
change the other day about, well, there

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S727 
January 30, 2020 
were a lot of witnesses in the Judge 
Porteous impeachment, and this Cham-
ber was able to handle that. It is very 
different in the impeachment of a 
judge, which is being handled by a com-
mittee. My understanding is that, 
under rule XI of the Senate procedures, 
there was a committee receiving that 
evidence. But in a Presidential im-
peachment, there is not going to be 
just a committee; it is the entire 
Chamber that is going to have to be 
sitting as Court of Impeachment, and 
that will affect the business of the 
Chamber. 
So I think the idea that something 
comes out and somebody makes an as-
sertion in a book, allegedly—it is only 
an alleged; it is simply alleged now 
that the manuscript says that; Ambas-
sador Bolton hasn’t come out to verify 
that, to my knowledge—that then we 
should start having this Chamber call-
ing new witnesses and establish the 
new normal for impeachment pro-
ceedings as being that there doesn’t 
have to be a complete investigation in 
the House, I think that is very dam-
aging for the future of this institution. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a question on behalf of myself and 
Senators WHITEHOUSE
and HEINRICH, 
and this is for the counsel for the 
President and the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Question 
from 
Senators 
SCHATZ, 
WHITEHOUSE, and HEINRICH
for both 
parties: 
Can the White House really not admit that 
Senator KING’s hypothetical would be wrong? 
We begin with the House managers. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, we 
have no trouble recognizing just how 
wrong that would be, but more than 
that, it is the natural extension of Pro-
fessor Dershowitz’ argument that if the 
President believed that kind of quid 
pro quo would help his reelection, then 
it is perfectly fine and nonimpeach-
able. There was a reason, of course, 
why they didn’t want to address that 
hypothetical. 
Let me go back also to the question 
that was asked about the other written 
reports that Ambassador Bolton and 
Attorney General Barr were concerned 
that the President was intervening in 
cases in which he had business invest-
ments, like Turkey. Under the theory 
of the President’s lawyers, that is per-
fectly OK, too. If the President thinks 
somehow that that is in the United 
States’ interest because it is in his in-
terest, that is perfectly fine. It is un-
impeachable. 
Now, is it a crime to give preference 
to autocrats, to give special consider-
ation to autocrats where your business 
investments are? That may not be 
criminal, but it is impeachable. It cer-
tainly should be impeachable if we are 
going to sacrifice the national security 
of the country, if we are going to with-
hold military aid, if we are going to be-
stow favors in U.S. resources to coun-
tries where the President has invest-
ments. Is that what we want driving 
U.S. policy? But that is the implication 
of what they have to say. 
I agree with counsel about one thing 
they said: If we have a trial with no 
witnesses, that will be a new precedent. 
We should be very concerned about the 
precedent we set here because it will 
mean heretofore—that when a Presi-
dent is impeached, that one party can 
deny the other witnesses, and that will 
be the new normal, that we have trials 
without witnesses, and I don’t think 
that is the precedent we should be set-
ting here. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
Let me just begin by noting I think 
it is a little bit rich for Manager 
SCHIFF to say that one party—i.e., the 
President—is going to deny them wit-
nesses. It was the President who was 
denied any witnesses throughout this 
process up until now. 
But to get back to the question on 
Senator KING’s hypothetical, if the 
President insisted that a foreign leader 
come here and lie about someone else 
and he was holding up military aid or 
a package of congressional aid and say-
ing ‘‘You have to go out and lie about 
this,’’ that would be wrong. But that is 
not this case, and it has nothing to do 
with this case. 
But I would like to address some-
thing that Manager SCHIFF said be-
cause he immediately pivoted now to 
the next thing. What is in the news-
papers? What else can we bring in from 
the newspapers? There is an allegation 
that the manuscript says something 
about conversations that Ambassador 
Bolton had with Attorney General 
Barr. Well, Attorney General Barr has 
issued a statement saying that allega-
tion, that assertion, is not accurate, 
that that is false. And there are other 
allegations that are made about what 
might be in this manuscript. Mick 
Mulvaney has issued a statement say-
ing that is not true. 
So to sort of play the game of, there 
is going to be another leak; somebody 
might write a book; there is something 
else—and that is, again, turning this 
body into the one doing the investiga-
tion because the House didn’t pursue 
the investigation. That is not pruden-
tially a wise move for this Chamber to 
take on that task. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Your Honor, I send a 
question to the desk for counsel for the 
President. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator KENNEDY 
is for counsel for the President: 
Has the House of Representatives, in its 
impeachment proceedings or otherwise, in-
vestigated the veracity of the statement by 
former Ukrainian Prosecutor General Victor 
Shokin that Mr. Shokin ‘‘believes his ouster 
was because of his interest in [Burisma Hold-
ings], and his claim that had he remained in 
his post, Shokin said he would have ques-
tioned Hunter Biden,’’ as reported on July 22, 
2019 in an article in The Washington Post en-
titled 
‘‘As 
Vice 
President, 
Biden 
said 
Ukraine Should Increase Gas Production. 
Then His Son got a job with a Ukrainian Gas 
Company,’’ by Michael Kranish and David L. 
Stern. 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for that ques-
tion. 
The answer, to the best of my knowl-
edge, is no, the House of Representa-
tives did not investigate the veracity 
of the truth of that reporting about 
Prosecutor General Shokin. In fact, 
that was part of the point. 
As Manager SCHIFF was saying here, 
again, the House Democrats’ position 
is that everything related to the entire 
incident of the Bidens and Burisma and 
what was going on with the pros-
ecutor—it is all debunked. There is 
nothing to see there. Move along. Don’t 
ask about it. But they didn’t inves-
tigate it, and they can’t point to any-
one who has investigated it. They can’t 
point to anyone who has really looked 
at it. 
As I said a minute ago—and I will not 
belabor the point—every witness who 
was asked said that they thought, yes, 
there was at least the appearance of a 
conflict of interest there. At least one 
witness—and there is a public report-
ing of another person, whose name is 
Hochstein, in the Obama administra-
tion—raised the issue with Vice Presi-
dent Biden’s Office, but nothing was 
done about it. 
There have been questions about 
whether Vice President Biden sought 
or received an ethics opinion. We don’t 
know—not that I have heard of, not 
that I have seen anywhere. It is just 
something that no one has actually in-
quired into. 
There have been questions raised 
about ‘‘Why now?’’ ‘‘Why are they 
being raised now?’’ The implication the 
House managers have tried to make is 
it is just because Joe Biden decided in 
April he was going to run for the Presi-
dency. 
As I explained the other day, Rudy 
Giuliani, as the President’s private 
counsel, was exploring matters in 
Ukraine starting in the fall of 2018. He 
had tips because he was interested in 
finding out—remember, the Mueller in-
vestigation was still ongoing at that 
point. It wasn’t clear what the out-
come of the Mueller investigation was 
going to be. He was trying to find out 
what were the origins of Russian inter-
ference, of the Steele dossier, of allega-
tions of collusion by the Trump cam-
paign. That led, in part, to Ukraine, 
and he got information that led him to 
various strands to pursue. One of them 
became the issue of the Biden and 
Burisma incident. 
He prepared a little package on that 
based on interview notes on January 23 
and January 25 of 2019. Months before

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S728 
January 30, 2020 
Joe Biden announced that he was going 
to 
run 
for 
the 
Presidency, 
Rudy 
Giuliani was interviewing Shokin and 
Lutsenko and wrote down in the inter-
view notes stuff about the Biden and 
Burisma incident and the firing of 
Shokin. He put it all in a package, and 
he delivered it to the State Depart-
ment in March—still before Joe Biden 
said he was going to be running for 
President. That didn’t happen until 
April 25. It was all done—all put in a 
package, all delivered. 
That is public now because that little 
package that he sent to the State De-
partment was released, I think it was, 
under the FOIA litigation, but it has 
been released publicly, and the notes 
that he took, his interview notes, were 
released publicly. 
So the timing dates back to when 
Rudy Giuliani was pursuing that, start-
ing back in the fall of 2018 with his tak-
ing time to pursue leads. He was trying 
to get Shokin to come to this country 
to interview him. He couldn’t get him 
a visa and had to interview him by 
phone. Lutsenko was in New York, and 
he prepared this package. That is why 
there is that timing. 
Then there were public articles pub-
lished about the Biden-Burisma affair. 
One of them was just mentioned in the 
question—a Washington Post article, 
July 22, 2019, specifically about it— 
about the firing of Shokin 3 days before 
the July 25 telephone call. It was in the 
news. It was topical. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Chief Justice, on behalf 
of myself and Senator CORNYN, I send a 
question to the desk for both House 
managers and the President’s counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators PETERS 
and CORNYN for both parties reads: 
How would the verdict in this trial alter 
the balance of power between the executive 
and legislative branches in the future? 
The President’s counsel goes first. 
Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. A verdict— 
a final judgment—of acquittal would be 
the best thing for our country and 
would send a great message that will 
actually help in our separation of pow-
ers. Here is why. 
As I have said repeatedly—and ac-
cording to the standard articulated so 
well during the Clinton impeachment— 
what are we dealing with here? We are 
dealing with a purely partisan im-
peachment with bipartisan opposition, 
no crime, and no violation of law in an 
election year. It has never happened 
before—no investigation, no due proc-
ess, nothing. 
What they are telling you—I mean, 
we can talk all we want, and we will, 
but what are we talking about at the 
end of the day? We are talking about 
removing the President of the United 
States from the ballot in an election 
that is occurring in months. Who 
thinks that is a good idea, particularly 
when you are dealing with a purely 
partisan impeachment that was warned 
about from the Framers? 
The only appropriate result that will 
not damage our country horribly— 
maybe forever but certainly for genera-
tions—is a verdict of acquittal. 
Here is the other point. In getting 
back to the question of witnesses, Mr. 
SCHIFF is up here: Let’s make a deal. 
How about we have the Chief Justice— 
and we have the greatest respect for 
the Chief Justice. Here is the problem. 
We are talking about critical constitu-
tional rights that have been protected 
by the Supreme Court over our history. 
So what is he really saying? Think 
about these questions. 
The Senate can decide about execu-
tive privilege by a vote—by a majority 
vote. With the greatest respect—with 
the greatest respect—if the Senate can 
just decide there is no executive privi-
lege, guess what? You are destroying 
executive privilege. Can the Senate de-
cide the House’s speech or debate pro-
tection? I mean, when we ask for docu-
ments from Mr. SCHIFF and his staff 
and he says ‘‘speech or debate,’’ are 
you going to decide that? Is that how 
we are going to do this? Are we going 
to flip a coin? Is that going to be your 
next suggestion? 
We are talking about an election of 
the President. There are critical con-
stitutional issues that will alter our 
balance of power for generations if we 
go down that road. 
Down this road is the path provided 
by the Democrats so wisely during the 
Clinton administration. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, it may be different in the court 
than it is in this Chamber and in the 
House, but when anybody begins a sen-
tence with the phrase ‘‘I have the 
greatest respect for,’’ you have to look 
out for what follows. 
We trust the Justice will make the 
right decision. The Justice has, I 
think, conducted these proceedings in 
an eminently fair way. 
There is nothing in the Constitution 
that would preclude us from taking a 
week to hear from witnesses and allow-
ing the Chief Justice to make those 
calls. 
I would say also, with respect to an 
argument counsel made about the 
Porteous impeachment trial, where, 
yes, the Senate designated 12 Senators 
to hear the witness testimony, the im-
plication is, you can’t do that in an im-
peachment of the President. That is 
only half correct. The other half is, you 
can do depositions in which only a cou-
ple of Members of the body need par-
ticipate. So it is a false argument to 
say or to suggest that the whole body 
would need to conduct the whole of the 
depositions. So much as we would like 
live testimony, we have offered a com-
promise. 
With respect to the question about 
what this will do to the balance of 
power, I would say this: As I mentioned 
earlier, our relationship with Ukraine 
will survive this debacle. But if we hold 
that a President can defy all sub-
poenas, can tie up the Congress end-
lessly with bad-faith claims of privi-
lege—claiming here one thing and 
claiming in court something else—it 
will eviscerate our oversight power. If 
the President is allowed to decide 
which subpoenas they will deign to 
consider valid and which they will 
deign to consider invalid, your over-
sight power and our oversight power is 
gone. That is an irrevocable change to 
the balance of power. 
What is more, if we adopt their the-
ory of the case that a President can 
abuse his power and do so by holding 
another 
country 
hostage 
by 
with-
holding congressionally appropriated 
funds and can violate the law in doing 
so as long as they think it is in their 
interest, imagine what that will do to 
the balance of power. Article II will 
really mean what the President says it 
means, which is he can do whatever he 
wants. 
So, yes, the stakes are big here. Arti-
cle II goes to whether our oversight 
power—particularly in a case of inves-
tigating the President’s own wrong-
doing—continues to have any weight or 
whether the impeachment power itself 
is now a nullity. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. RUBIO. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk on behalf of my-
self and Senators CAPITO and SCOTT of 
South Carolina—with all due respect. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
from Senators RUBIO, CAPITO, and 
SCOTT of South Carolina is directed to 
both parties, and we will begin with 
counsel for the House managers. 
The question reads: 
If I understand the Managers’ Case: The 
President abused his power because he acted 
contrary to the advice of his advisors, but he 
is guilty of obstruction of Congress because 
he acted in accordance to the advice of his 
advisors. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. That is not 
our argument at all. The President is 
impeached on article I not because he 
acted contrary to the advice of his ad-
visers. That is a red herring offered by 
the President’s legal team. We are not 
saying that the President is not free to 
disregard the advice of his counsel. He 
is. He is entitled to disregard even real-
ly good advice. What he is not free to 
do is to engage in corruption. What he 
is not free to do is to withhold military 
aid—not for a valid policy disagree-
ment. 
They 
have 
conceded 
Rudy 
Giuliani was not doing policy. What is 
not permitted is for a President to 
withhold congressionally appropriated 
money for a corrupt purpose—to secure 
help, to illicit foreign help, and cheat 
in an election. That is no policy dis-
agreement. 
Now, are we arguing in article II that 
he should be impeached for following 
his lawyers’ advice? No. They were fol-
lowing his advice. His advice was to 
fight all subpoenas. They were giving

the legal window dressing to that. 
They were going to court and arguing 
one thing and coming before you and 
arguing another. He was not following 
their advice; they were following his. 
You can say a lot about Donald Trump, 
but he is not led around by the nose by 
his legal counsel. Ask Don McGahn 
about that. Don McGahn stood up to 
the President. 
Bob Mueller—if we are going to talk 
about the Mueller report—found sev-
eral instances—and this goes to the 
pattern 
of 
the 
President’s 
mis-
conduct—in which he sought to ob-
struct that investigation, including 
telling the President’s lawyer that he 
should fire the special counsel and then 
that he should lie about that instruc-
tion. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. 
Counsel 
CIPOLLONE. 
Thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the 
Senate. 
You are right. That is yet another 
way in which the House managers’ 
theories of impeachment are incoher-
ent and dangerous. 
With respect to article II—and again, 
I won’t respond to the ad hominem at-
tacks that keep coming. I will say, just 
for the record, you are right—I haven’t 
been elected to anything, but when I 
say ‘‘with the greatest respect,’’ I 
mean it. 
Article II: The President has been 
impeached for exercising longstanding 
constitutional rights. He is looking out 
for constitutional rights in the face of 
a House process that violated all of 
them against all precedent, and he is 
looking out for future Presidents and 
for the executive branch. How? If he 
had said, ‘‘OK. Fine. No rights. No 
counsel. No witnesses. No right to 
cross-examine. Here is everything you 
asked for,’’ what sort of precedent 
would that set? That would irreparably 
damage the separation of powers. 
Again, all you need to look at are the 
Articles of Impeachment. The Articles 
of Impeachment do not allege a crime. 
They do not even allege a violation of 
law. They are purely partisan. They 
were opposed by Democrats in the 
House. 
It is an election year, and they are 
here, saying: Instead of an election, 
let’s confront very consequential, con-
stitutional issues that have never real-
ly been confronted, and let’s do it in a 
week. Let’s destroy executive privi-
lege. Maybe let’s destroy speech and 
debate privilege. 
Let me point out one other thing. It 
is not right to accuse somebody falsely 
of something and then say: Unless you 
waive your constitutional rights, you 
are guilty. That is not right. We 
shouldn’t accept that in this country. 
These are the longstanding privileges. 
They have been respected for hundreds 
of years, and we should continue to re-
spect them. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from West Virginia. 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself for the President’s counsel and 
House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The 
question 
is 
from 
Senator 
MANCHIN for both parties. We will begin 
with the President’s counsel. 
Over the past two weeks, the White House 
counsel had detailed all the problems associ-
ated with the House’s decision to move 
quickly through their impeachment pro-
ceedings. Why shouldn’t this body heed their 
advice and slow down and at least allow the 
judge to rule in the McGahn case to give the 
members of this body an official opinion 
from the Judiciary on Article II? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senator, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I think the key point here is the 
McGahn case is not going to directly 
resolve something related to the ob-
struction charges here. It is going to 
address a legal issue with respect to an 
assertion of absolute immunity for Don 
McGahn. 
There should be a decision from the 
DC Circuit sometime soon, but that 
will almost certainly go to the Su-
preme Court. I mean, that immunity is 
being challenged, and it has been relied 
upon by the executive for over 40 years. 
That is an issue destined for the Su-
preme Court. 
So the idea—it is not going to be just 
to slow down here a little bit. This 
trial can’t be held open pending a final 
resolution of that litigation, and that 
is an important point, because this is 
something that Alexander Hamilton 
pointed out in Federalist No. 65, when 
he was discussing who should be the 
body to try impeachments. One consid-
eration was potentially drawing in 
judges from various States to create a 
new body to try impeachments, and the 
rationale that Hamilton gave that that 
would be a bad idea is that there has to 
be swift progression from an impeach-
ment to the trial, to a verdict, to hav-
ing it finished, precisely because this is 
where he talked about ‘‘the persecution 
of an intemperate or designing major-
ity in the House of Representatives.’’ 
He recognized there could be partisan 
impeachments, and that accusation, 
that 
impeachment, 
shouldn’t 
been 
hanging out there. There should be a 
swift trial to determine things finally, 
and that is why all of the preparation 
ought to be done in the House of Rep-
resentatives to ensure that there is an 
investigation, there is a case put to-
gether. And, if they are ready to im-
peach the President of the United 
States, they had better be finished, 
have everything buttoned down, and 
have their case ready because they 
can’t have a trial of the President— 
Hamilton warned against that specifi-
cally—hanging over the country for 
months on end. 
And so to push off this trial to say: 
Well, we will wait for litigation and at 
that point—that is a very dangerous 
idea, and that is not the way that the 
trial here should operate. It ought to 
be finished on the basis of the case that 
the House managers came ready to 
present. If they weren’t ready to 
present a case that can win, there 
should be an acquittal. 
Thank you, Counsel. 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. We have an-
other half of the presentation. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. If we could— 
Senator, if we could pull up slide 37, 
this is what the district court had to 
say in the McGahn litigation, now on 
appeal: 
Executive branch officials are not abso-
lutely immune from compulsory congres-
sional process no matter how many times 
the executive branch has asserted as much 
over the years. 
That is consistent with the decision 
in the Miers case, where the court said: 
Clear precedent and persuasive policy rea-
sons confirm that the Executive cannot be 
the judge of its own privilege and hence Ms. 
Miers is not entitled to absolute immunity. 
Let’s look at what the court said on 
slide 38, where Judge Jackson said: 
Stated simply, the primary takeaway from 
the past 250 years of recorded American his-
tory is that Presidents are not kings . . . 
compulsory appearance by dint of a subpoena 
is a legal constrict not a political one, and 
per the Constitution no one is above the law. 
This is the district court saying: 
Thou shalt appear and this claim of ab-
solute immunity is absolute nonsense. 
In the court, now, this is what the 
Justice Department is arguing in that 
case, if we can see slide 39. 
The committee lacks article III standing 
to sue to enforce a congressional subpoena 
demanding testimony from an individual on 
matters related to his duties as an executive 
branch official. 
And so here we are. We are now in a 
court of appeals, the Justice Depart-
ment is saying that you cannot force 
congressional subpoenas, and they are 
saying: Well, let’s continue to litigate 
the matter. Let this play out further. 
To what end? To what end? Yes, I 
suppose we could wait for a court of ap-
peals decision, but, of course, they 
would say they are not satisfied with 
that court throwing out this idea ei-
ther. 
Well, look, we have got a perfectly 
good Justice right here that can make 
these decisions. Let’s let him make the 
call. Let’s let him make the call. Let’s 
trust that he would be fair and impar-
tial. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from South Carolina 
Mr. SCOTT of South Carolina. Thank 
you, sir. 
I send a question to the desk on be-

of 
myself,

port on Benghazi flatly says ‘‘The adminis-
tration did not cooperate with the investiga-
tion.’’ That committee fought for two years 
to access information, and often had infor-
mation requests ignored or denied. Yet this 
House investigation, after just 3 months, al-
ready 
supposedly 
justifies 
impeachment. 
Does President Trump owe more compliance 
than other Presidents did? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Thank you, 
Mr. Chief Justice. 
Part of what we are seeing, I believe, 
is kind of a two-fold attack or ap-
proach. We just saw a citation to two 
district court opinions, as if the final 
arbiter of an issue of this magnitude is 
going to be the district court—or, for 
that matter, the court of appeals. 
You are right. It is going to be the 
Supreme Court of the United States, if 
it goes in that direction. 
Now, with regard to the question 
about the statement in the Benghazi 
report that the administration did not 
cooperate, the same was also true with 
Fast and Furious and the investigation 
there. And in that particular investiga-
tion, it reached such a significant point 
that Members of the House determined 
that the then-Attorney General of the 
United States should be held in con-
tempt. 
Now, President Obama exercised ex-
ecutive privilege over documents and 
testimony related to Fast and Furious. 
The constitutional process was fol-
lowed. 
Now, I am not the one that makes 
the decision whether that was privi-
leged or not privileged. If there was 
going to be a challenge, it would have 
been adjudicated. But the fact of the 
matter is, at least 10 times tonight 
Manager SCHIFF
has said: We have 
complete confidence in the Chief Jus-
tice, ignoring the fact that it is not his 
call. And I mean that with all sin-
cerity, since you are making fun of 
people who are saying ‘‘with due re-
spect.’’ It is not—that is not the way it 
is set up. 
Now, you could agree to anything. 
Sure, you can negotiate. You can nego-
tiate that all the witnesses that will be 
called will be the witnesses they re-
quested, or you could negotiate that 
since they had 17 and we had none, we 
get 17 and they get 4. All kinds of 
things can be negotiated under their 
view. 
But this is brought to you by the 
managers who have an overwhelming 
case that they proved over and over 
again. That is what they say. They 
have proved it. It is overwhelming. It is 
incredible. We were able to put it to-
gether in a record amount of time. And 
now we want you, the U.S. Senate, to 
start calling witnesses for our over-
whelmingly proved case. 
I would just lay this down: If we are 
negotiating, why don’t we just go to 
closing arguments, and see what this 
body decides? 
But I respect the process. The process 
is we have 2 days of questioning. To-
morrow there will be an argument on 
the motion. There will be a decision on 
the motion, and we have to—that is the 
system that is in place. That is the sys-
tem we should follow. 
But this idea that two district court 
judges have decided an issue of this 
magnitude and that is now the deter-
mination—they wouldn’t accept it if 
they were in our position. They would 
say: Well, the district court decided; so 
that is going to be it. 
So I think we need to look at what is 
really at stake. These are really sig-
nificant issues. These are serious. I 
mean, the idea that executive privilege 
should just be waived or doesn’t exist, 
that, in your view, absolute immunity 
can’t possibly exist—it has only been 
utilized for administrations for 50 
years or more. 
Professor Dershowitz gave you the 
list of Presidents that have put forward 
executive privilege, and in a lot of his 
writings, he talks about it. 
But to say tonight that we are just 
going to—you know, we will just cut a 
deal. We will do it in a week. We will 
get some depositions, and that will 
make everyone happy. 
It doesn’t make the Constitution 
happy. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk on behalf of Sen-
ators CASEY, KLOBUCHAR, WARREN, and 
WYDEN for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question for the House managers 
from Senator BROWN
and the other 
Senators is as follows: 
Yesterday, you referenced how President 
Trump’s perpetuating and propagating Rus-
sian conspiracy theories undercut our na-
tional security objectives. If acquitted in the 
Senate, what would prevent the President 
from continuing to side with Putin and other 
adversaries, instead of our intelligence com-
munity and career diplomats, and what are 
the implications on our national security 
agenda if such behavior continues, un-
checked? 
Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
You know, I have talked a lot to-
night and throughout the last week 
about what is at stake here, because, 
you know, it is getting late into the 
night, and we have been having this de-
bate for several days now. There is a 
lot of discussion in the legal aspects of 
this. So I don’t want to get into, again, 
you know, the issues of our troops in 
Europe, the hot war that continues to 
happen right now as we are speaking in 
Ukraine, but I will reiterate the prece-
dent that we set with regard to Russia 
and foreign adversaries—you know, 
this idea that it is OK to continue to 
pedal in Russian propaganda and de-
bunked conspiracy theories—because 
counsel for the President would have 
you believe that, you know, this is a 
policy discussion, that, you know, we 
have not resolved this, that there is a 
lot of debate about this issue. And if 
that is indeed the case, if we concede 
that, then, there are some witnesses 
that we can call on, including Ambas-
sador Bolton, that could shed addi-
tional light on it. 
But the fact pattern that we are sit-
ting at right now—what we are talking 
about right now—is 17 witnesses that 
were called in the House, none of whom 
had any indicia or had any data to pro-
vide that any of these theories were ac-
curate. 
We have the entire intelligence and 
law enforcement community of the 
United States unanimously saying that 
there is no indication that Ukraine was 
involved in the 2016 election, that it 
was Russia. 
And don’t buy the red herring, by the 
way, that counsel for the President has 
brought forth—this idea that, oh, it 
can only be Russia. You know, they 
said earlier that we are claiming that 
it can only be Russia. That is not what 
we are saying. Nobody on this team has 
ever said it can only be Russia, be-
cause, indeed, we know, as many of 
these people in the Chamber know well, 
that there are a lot of mal actors out 
there, that there are a lot of countries 
out there that have the capability and 
the will and that regularly try to at-
tack us in a variety of ways. 
What we are saying is, with respect 
to this issue that is before the body 
right now, that, unanimously, the law 
enforcement agencies of the United 
States and the intelligence commu-
nities of the United States have said 
that it was Russia that interfered in 
the 2016 elections and that there is no 
data to suggest Ukraine was involved. 
That is the issue. 
So the precedent—bringing it all 
around to the beginning of the ques-
tion, the precedent is that all of our 
adversaries, including Vladimir Putin, 
will understand that they can play to 
the whims of one person, whether that 
be President Trump or some future 
President, Democrat or Republican. 
They can play to the whims and the in-
terests and the personal political ambi-
tions of one person and get that indi-
vidual to propagate their propaganda, 
get them to undermine our own intel-
ligence and law enforcement commu-
nities. That is a precedent that I don’t 
think anybody here is willing and in-
terested in sending, and that is truly 
what is at stake. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from North Dakota. 
Mr. HOEVEN. Mr. Chief Justice, I am 
sending a question to the desk for my-
self, 
Senator 
BOOZMAN, 
Senator 
WICKER, and Senator CAPITO. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question 
for counsel for the President from Sen-
ators HOEVEN, BOOZMAN, WICKER, and 
CAPITO: 
House managers contend that they have an 
overwhelming case and that they have made 
their case in clear and convincing fashion. 
Doesn’t that assertion directly contradict 
their request for more witnesses? 
Mr. PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Sen-
ators, thank you for the question. 
I think it does directly contradict 
their claim now that they need more

witnesses. They said for weeks that it 
was an overwhelming case. They came 
here and they have said 63 times that it 
is overwhelming or proved beyond a 
reasonable doubt. Manager NADLER 
said twice today that based on what 
they have already shown you, it has 
been proved beyond any doubt. 
All right, if that is their position, 
why do they need more witnesses or 
evidence? It is completely self-con-
tradictory. 
I would like to address a couple of 
other points while I am here and I have 
the time, and we have gone back and 
forth on this, and I don’t know why I 
have to say it again, but the House 
managers keep coming up here and 
saying and acting as if, if you mention 
Ukraine in connection with election in-
terference, if you even mention it, you 
are a pawn of Vladimir Putin because 
only the Russians interfered in the 
election and there is not any evidence 
in the record—they say—the Ukrain-
ians did anything. 
I read it before; I will read it again. 
One of their star witnesses, Fiona Hill, 
said that some Ukrainian officials ‘‘bet 
on Hillary Clinton winning the elec-
tion,’’ so it was ‘‘quite evident’’ that 
‘‘they were trying to curry favor with 
the Clinton campaign,’’ including by 
‘‘trying to collect information . . . on 
Mr. Manafort and on other people as 
well.’’ That was Fiona Hill. 
There was also evidence in the record 
from a POLITICO article in 2017. There 
was a whole bunch of Ukrainian offi-
cials who had done things to try to 
help the Clinton campaign and the 
DNC and to harm the Trump campaign. 
In addition, two news organizations, 
both POLITICO and the Financial 
Times did their own investigative re-
porting, and the Financial Times con-
cluded that the opposition to President 
Trump led ‘‘Kiev’s wider political lead-
ership to do something they would 
never have attempted before: [to] in-
tervene, however indirectly, in a US 
election’’—the Financial Times. 
So the idea that there is no evidence 
whatsoever of Ukrainians doing any-
thing to interfere in any way is just 
not true. They come up here and say it 
again and again, and it is just not true. 
The other thing I would like to point 
out, Manager SCHIFF is suggesting that 
somehow we are coming here and say-
ing one thing and the Department of 
Justice is saying something else in 
court about litigation. That is also not 
true. 
We have been very clear every time. 
The position of the Trump administra-
tion, like the Obama administration, is 
that when Congress sues in an article 
III court to try to enforce a subpoena 
against an executive branch official, 
that is not a justiciable controversy, 
and there is not jurisdiction over it. 
The House managers in the House, 
though, take the position that they 
have that avenue open to them. 
So our position is when we go to 
court, we will resist jurisdiction in the 
court, but if the House managers want 
to proceed to impeachment, where they 
claim that they have an alternative 
mechanism available to them, our posi-
tion 
is, 
the 
Constitution 
requires 
incrementalism in conflicts between 
the branches, and that means that first 
there should be an accommodation 
process, and then Congress can con-
sider other mechanisms at its disposal, 
such as contempt or such as squeezing 
the President’s policies by withholding 
appropriations or other mechanisms to 
deal with that interbranch conflict or, 
if they claim they can sue in court, to 
sue in court. But an impeachment is a 
measure of last resort. 
Now, earlier, Manager SCHIFF sug-
gested that today in court, the Depart-
ment of Justice went in and said: There 
is no jurisdiction. And when the judge 
said: Well, if there is no jurisdiction to 
sue, then what can Congress do? And 
the DOJ, the key representative, sim-
ply said: Well, if they can’t sue, then 
they can impeach—as if that was the 
direct answer to just go from if you 
can’t sue, the next step is impeach-
ment. 
Now that didn’t seem right to me, be-
cause I didn’t think that was what DOJ 
would be saying, and DOJ put out a 
statement. I don’t have a transcript of 
the hearing. They don’t have the tran-
script ready yet, as far as I know, but 
DOJ said, and this is a quote from the 
statement: 
The point we made in court is simply that 
Congress has numerous political tools it can 
use in battles with the executive branch—ap-
propriations, legislation, nominations, and 
potentially in some circumstances even im-
peachment. For example, it can hold up 
funding for the President’s preferred pro-
grams, pass legislation he opposes, or refuse 
to confirm his nominees. 
This is continuing their statement: 
But it is absurd for Chairman SCHIFF to 
portray our mere description of the Con-
stitution as somehow endorsing his rush to 
an impeachment trial. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Connecticut. 
Mr. BLUMENTHAL. Thank you, Mr. 
Chief Justice. I send a question to the 
desk for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The 
question 
from 
Senator 
BLUMENTHAL to the House managers: 
On April 24, 2019—one day after the media 
reported that former Vice President Biden 
would formally enter the 2020 U.S. Presi-
dential race—the State Department executed 
President Trump’s order to recall Ambas-
sador Marie Yovanovitch, a well-regarded ca-
reer diplomat and anti-corruption crusader. 
Why did President Trump want, in his words, 
to ‘‘take her out’’? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Mr. Giuliani 
has provided the answer to that ques-
tion. He stated publicly that the reason 
they 
needed 
to 
get 
Ambassador 
Yovanovitch out of the way was that 
she was going to get in the way of 
these investigations that they wanted. 
This is the President’s own lawyer’s ex-
planation for why they had to push 
out—why they had to smear—Ambas-
sador Yovanovitch. 
So the President’s own lawyer gives 
us the answer, and that ought to tell us 
something in a couple of respects: one, 
that the President’s own agents have 
said that she was an impediment to 
getting these investigations. She was 
this anti-corruption champion, this 
anti-corruption champion who is at an 
awards ceremony or recognition cere-
mony for a Ukrainian anti-corruption 
fighter, a woman who had acid thrown 
in her face and died a painful death 
after months. She is at the very cere-
mony acknowledging this other cham-
pion fighting corruption when she gets 
the word: You need to come back on 
the next plane. 
One of the reasons the Ukrainians 
knew they had to deal with Rudy 
Giuliani is that Rudy Giuliani was try-
ing to get this Ambassador replaced. 
And, you know, he succeeded. He suc-
ceeded, and that sent a message to the 
Ukrainians that if Rudy Giuliani had 
the juice with the President of the 
United States, the power with the 
President of the United States to recall 
an Ambassador from her post, this is 
not only somebody who had the ear of 
the President but could make things 
happen. 
So the short answer is that Rudy 
Giuliani tells us why she had to go. 
Now why they had to smear her, why 
the President couldn’t simply recall 
her—that is harder to explain. But the 
reason they wanted her out of the way 
is they wanted to make these inves-
tigations go forward, and they knew 
someone there fighting corruption was 
getting in the way of that. 
Now I wanted to say, with respect to 
some of the arguments against having 
the testimony of John Bolton, these 
are some of the former National Secu-
rity Advisors who have been called to 
hearings 
and 
depositions: 
Zbigniew 
Brzezinski, National Security Advisor 
for President Carter, provided 8 hours 
of public hearing testimony and addi-
tional deposition testimony before the 
Senate 
Judiciary 
Committee 
Sub-
committee to Investigate Individuals 
Regarding the Interests of Foreign 
Governments; Admiral Poindexter tes-
tified, providing 25 hours of public 
hearing testimony and 20 hours of dep-
osition testimony before the House Se-
lect Committee to Investigate Covert 
Arms Transactions with Iran; Robert 
McFarland, former National Security 
Advisor for President Ronald Reagan, 
provided over 20 hours of hearing testi-
mony and 3 additional hours of deposi-
tion testimony; Samuel Berger, Na-
tional Security Advisor to President 
Clinton, provided 2 hours of public 
hearing testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs, 
its inquiry into campaign finance prac-
tices; Condoleezza Rice, National Secu-
rity Advisor to President George W. 
Bush, 3 hours of public testimony, ad-
ditional 
closed 
session 
testimony; 
Susan Rice provided closed session tes-
timony to the House Select Committee 
on how the Obama administration han-
dled identification of U.S. citizens in 
U.S. intelligence reports.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S732 
January 30, 2020 
There is ample precedent where it is 
necessary to have testimony of Na-
tional Security Advisors. 
Now you saw, I think, President’s 
counsel dancing on the head of a pin to 
try and explain why they are before 
you arguing ‘‘We can’t have these peo-
ple come here; the House should sue in 
court’’ and why they are in court say-
ing ‘‘The court can’t hear it.’’ 
I have to say I have a great under-
standing of the difficulty of that posi-
tion. I wouldn’t want to be in a posi-
tion of having to advocate that argu-
ment. But it goes to the demonstration 
of bad faith here. How can you be be-
fore this body saying ‘‘You have got to 
go to court; the House was derelict be-
cause it didn’t go to court,’’ and go to 
the same court and say ‘‘The House 
shouldn’t be here’’? How do you do 
that? 
Now, they say: Well, the House is in 
court, so the House must think it is 
OK, even though we don’t think so, and 
we will argue that and take it all the 
way up to the Supreme Court if we 
have to. 
We don’t think that is an adequate 
remedy. That is the whole problem. 
When you have bad faith indication of 
privilege, when you have, in fact, non-
assertion of privilege, when you have a 
President who wants to continue to 
cover up his wrongdoing indefinitely— 
a President who is trying to get foreign 
help on the very next election—that 
process of going endlessly up and down 
the courts with a duplicitous counsel 
to the President arguing ‘‘In one place 
you can do it and the other place you 
can’t’’ shows the flaw with a precedent 
that Congress must exhaust all rem-
edies before it can insist on answers 
with the ultimate remedy of impeach-
ment. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The majority leader is recognized. 
RECESS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. Chief Justice, 
I suggest we take a 5-minute break. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objec-
tion, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the Senate, 
at 9:13 p.m., sitting as a Court of Im-
peachment, recessed until 9:25 p.m., 
whereupon, the Senate reassembled 
when called to order by the CHIEF JUS-
TICE. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate 
will come to order. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Mr. Chief Justice, I send 
a question to the desk for myself and 
Senator LANKFORD. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators ERNST and 
LANKFORD is for the counsel for the 
President: 
Members of the House Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, of which Man-
ager SCHIFF sits as Chairman, conducted a 
number of depositions related to this im-
peachment inquiry. One of the individuals 
deposed was Intelligence Community Inspec-
tor General Michael Atkinson. Has the White 
House been provided a copy of this deposi-
tion transcript? Do you believe this tran-
script would be helpful? If so, why? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice and Senator, thank you for that 
question. 
We have not been provided that tran-
script. My understanding is that the 
inspector general for the intelligence 
community, Mr. Atkinson, testified in 
executive session, and HPSCI has re-
tained that transcript in executive ses-
sion and was not transmitted to the 
House 
Judiciary 
Committee, 
and, 
therefore, under the terms of H. Res. 
660, was not turned over to the White 
House counsel, so we have not seen it. 
I just want to clarify: We don’t think 
there is any need to start getting into 
more evidence or witnesses, but if one 
were to start going down that road, I 
think that that transcript could be rel-
evant because it is my understanding, 
from public reports, that there were 
questions asked of the inspector gen-
eral about his interactions with the 
whistleblower, and there is some ques-
tion in public reports about whether 
the whistleblower was entirely truthful 
with the inspector general on the forms 
that were filled out and whether or 
not, you know, there were certain rep-
resentations made about whether or 
not there had been any contact with 
Congress, and that then ties into the 
contact that the whistleblower appar-
ently had with the staff and com-
mittee, which we also don’t know 
about. 
So if we were to go down the road, we 
don’t think it necessary. We think that 
this—these Articles of Impeachment 
should be rejected. But if one were to 
go down the road with any more evi-
dence or witnesses, it would certainly 
be relevant to find out what the inspec-
tor general of the intelligence commu-
nity had to say about the whistle-
blower, along with the other issues 
that we mentioned about the whistle-
blower’s bias, motivation: What were 
his connections with the whole situa-
tion of the Bidens? And, apparently, if 
he worked with Vice President Biden, 
did he work—he worked on Ukraine 
issues, according to public reports— 
how does that all tie in? All of those 
things would become relevant in that 
instance. Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Mr. JONES. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Alabama. 
Mr. JONES. Thank you, Mr. Chief 
Justice. I send a question to the desk 
on behalf of myself, Senator MANCHIN, 
and Senator SINEMA. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators JONES, 
MANCHIN, and SINEMA is directed to the 
House managers: 
So much of the questions and answers, as 
well as the presentations, have focused on 
the completeness of the House record. 
Should the House have initiated the formal 
accommodations process with the Adminis-
tration to negotiate for documents and wit-
nesses after the passage of H. Res. 660? And 
regardless of whether the House record is 
sufficient or insufficient to find the Presi-
dent guilty or not guilty, what duty, if any, 
does the Senate owe to the American public 
to ensure that all relevant facts are made 
known in this trial and not at some point in 
the future? 
Mr. 
Manager 
SCHIFF. 
Senators, 
thank you for the question. 
It was apparent from the very begin-
ning, when the President announced 
that they would fight all subpoenas, 
when the White House Counsel issued 
its October 8 diatribe saying they 
would not participate in the inquiry, 
that they were not interested in any 
accommodation. 
We tried to get Don McGahn to tes-
tify. We tried that route. We have been 
trying that route for 9 months now. We 
tried for quite some time before we 
took that matter to court, with abso-
lutely no success. 
And I think what we have seen is, 
there was no desire on the part of the 
President to reach any accommoda-
tion. Quite the contrary, the President 
was adamant that they were going to 
fight in every single way. 
Now, if they had an interest in 
accomodation, we wouldn’t be before 
you without a single document. There 
would have been hundreds and hun-
dreds of documents provided. We would 
have entered an accommodation proc-
ess over claims of—narrow claims of 
privilege as to this sentence or that 
sentence. They would have had to 
make a particularized claim that we 
could have negotiated over. But, of 
course, they did none of that. 
They said: Your subpoenas are in-
valid. You have to depart from the bi-
partisan rules of how you conduct your 
depositions. Essentially, our idea of ac-
commodation is you have to do it our 
way or the highway. And the Presi-
dent’s instructions, the President’s 
marching orders were: Go pound sand. 
Now, what is the Senate’s responsi-
bility in the context of a House im-
peachment for which there was such 
blanket obstruction? And bear in mind, 
if you compare this to the Nixon im-
peachment, Richard Nixon told his peo-
ple to cooperate, provided documents 
to the Congress. Yes, there were some 
that were withheld, and that led to liti-
gation, and the President lost that liti-
gation. But the circumstances here are 
very different. 
Frankly, the President could have 
made this difficult case but didn’t be-
cause of the wholesale nature of the ob-
struction. 
Now, in terms of the Senate’s respon-
sibility, the Constitution says: 
The Senate shall have the sole Power to 
try all Impeachments. When sitting for that 
Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirma-
tion. 
And so you have the sole power. 
That expression is used, I believe, 
only twice in the Constitution: One, 
when it tells the House that we have 
the sole power to conduct an impeach-
ment proceeding; and, again, the proc-
ess we used—and they can repeat this

same process used in the Clinton and 
Nixon impeachments. And I am sure 
Clinton and Nixon thought that was 
unfair, but, nonetheless, we used the 
same process. 
But, here, you have the sole power to 
try the case. And if you decide that 1 
week is not too long, in the interest of 
a fair trial, to have depositions of key 
witnesses, that is for you to decide. 
You get to decide how to try the case. 
And so if you decide that you have 
confidence in the Chief Justice of the 
Supreme Court to make decisions 
about materiality and relevance and 
privilege and make those line-by-line 
redactions, if they are warranted, if 
you decide you trust the Chief Justice 
to decide whether privilege is being ap-
plied properly or improperly to conceal 
crime or fraud or for legitimate na-
tional security purpose, you have the 
sole power to make that happen. That 
is within—every bit within your right, 
and we would urge you to do so. 
Now, counsel for the President says 
the Constitution doesn’t require that. 
The Constitution doesn’t prohibit that. 
It gives you the sole power to try this 
case. And under your sole power, you 
can say: We have made a decision. We 
are going to give the parties 1 week. 
We are going to let the Chief Justice 
make a fair determination of who is 
pertinent and who is not. We are not 
going to let the House decide who the 
President’s witnesses are; we are not 
going to let the President decide who 
the House witnesses are. We are going 
to let them both submit their top pri-
orities, and we are going to let the 
Chief Justice decide who is material 
and who is not. That is fully within 
your power. 
And so, in sum and substance, there 
is no evidence of an intention or will-
ingness in any way, shape, or form to 
accommodate in the House. If there 
was, we wouldn’t be here. Instead, 
there was: We will fight all subpoenas, 
and under article II, I can do whatever 
I want. And now we are here. 
And they make the astounding claim: 
If their case is so good, let them try it 
without witnesses. That wouldn’t fly 
before any judge in America, and it 
shouldn’t fly here either. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. I send to the desk 
a question on behalf of myself and Sen-
ators LEE and JOHNSON. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator BLACK-
BURN and Senators LEE and JOHNSON is 
for counsel for the President: 
What was the date of first contact between 
any member of the House Intelligence com-
mittee staff and the whistleblower regarding 
the information that resulted in the com-
plaint? How many times have House Intel-
ligence committee members or staff commu-
nicated in any form with the whistleblower 
since that first date of contact? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for that 
question. 
The answer is, we don’t know. No-
body knows. We don’t know when the 
first contact was. We don’t know how 
many contacts there were. We don’t 
know what the substance of the con-
tact was. That all remains shrouded in 
some secrecy. 
And as I said a moment ago, we think 
that the way this case has been pre-
sented, this body should simply acquit. 
There is no need to get more evidence 
to probe into that. 
But if we were to go down the road of 
any evidence or witnesses, then those 
are certainly relevant questions and 
relevant things to know about, to un-
derstand what those contacts were, 
what the whistleblower’s motivation 
was, what is the connection between 
the whistleblower and any staffers, and 
how that played any role in the formu-
lation of the complaint. That would all 
be relevant to understand how this 
whole process began. 
Now, I do want to mention something 
else, while I have the moment, in re-
sponse to some things that Manager 
SCHIFF said. 
Again, the House managers come 
up—it seems like they keep saying the 
same thing, and we keep pointing to 
actual evidence and letters that dis-
prove what they are saying. They come 
up and say that the President said: It is 
my way or the highway—blanket defi-
ance—there is nothing you can do. And 
they say that, well, they would have 
accommodated if we were willing to 
participate 
in 
the 
accommodation 
process. 
The October 8 letter that Counsel for 
the President, who Mr. SCHIFF
says 
acts in bad faith and called duplicitous 
here on the floor of the Senate, sent a 
letter on October 8 to Mr. SCHIFF and 
others explaining: ‘‘If the Committees 
wish to return to the regular order of 
oversight requests, we stand ready to 
engage in that process as we have in 
the past, in a manner consistent with 
well-established bipartisan constitu-
tional protections and a respect for the 
separation of powers enshrined in our 
Constitution.’’ 
That was followed up in an October 
18 letter that I mentioned before, a let-
ter that specified the defects in the 
subpoenas that had been issued—not 
blanket defiance, not simply ‘‘we don’t 
cooperate’’—specifying the legal errors 
in the subpoenas. 
And it concluded: ‘‘As I stated in my 
letter of October 8th, if the Commit-
tees wish to return to the regular order 
of oversight requests, we stand ready 
to engage in that process as we have in 
the past, in a manner consistent with 
well-established constitutional protec-
tions and a respect for the separation 
of powers enshrined in our Constitu-
tion.’’ 
The President stood ready to engage 
in the accommodations process. If any-
one said: ‘‘My way or the highway’’ 
here, it was the House because the 
House was determined that they want-
ed just to get their impeachment proc-
ess done on the fastest track they 
could. They didn’t want to do any ac-
commodation. They didn’t want to do 
any litigation. They didn’t want any-
thing to slow them down. They wanted 
to get it done as fast as they could so 
it was finished by Christmas. 
It was a partisan charade from the 
beginning. It resulted in a partisan im-
peachment, with bipartisan opposition, 
and it is not something this Chamber 
should condone. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
Ms. ROSEN. Mr. Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Nevada. 
Ms. ROSEN. I have a question I send 
to the desk for the House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator ROSEN is 
for the House managers: 
During the President’s phone call with 
Ambassador Sondland he insisted there was 
no ‘‘quid pro quo’’ involving the exchange of 
aid and a White House meeting for an inves-
tigation, but he also said, according to 
Sondland, that the stalemate over aid will 
continue until President Zelensky announces 
the investigations. Isn’t that the definition 
of the exact quid pro quo that the President 
claimed didn’t exist? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The short an-
swer is yes; that is exactly what a quid 
pro quo is. 
When someone says: ‘‘I am not going 
to ask you to do this,’’ but then says: 
‘‘I am going to ask you to do this,’’ 
that is exactly what happened here. 
Sondland calls the President, and the 
first words out of his mouth are ‘‘no 
quid pro quo.’’ Now, that is suspicious 
enough 
when 
someone 
blurts 
out 
there—what we would find out is a 
false exculpatory, but then the Presi-
dent goes on, nonetheless, to say: ‘‘No 
quid pro quo.’’ 
At the same time, Zelensky has got 
to go to the mic to announce these in-
vestigations—that is the implication— 
and he should want to do it. So no quid 
pro quo over the money, but Zelensky 
has got to go to the mic. 
And if you have any question about 
the accuracy of that, you should de-
mand to see Ambassador 
Taylor’s 
notes, Tim Morrison’s notes. And, of 
course, 
Sondland 
goes 
and 
tells 
Ukraine about this coupling of the 
money in order to get the investiga-
tions. 
Let me just, if I can, go through a lit-
tle of the history of that. You have 
Rudy Giuliani and others trying to 
make sure the Ukrainians make these 
statements in the runup to that July 
phone call. This is the quid pro quo 
over the meeting. So they are trying to 
get the statement that they want. 
They are trying to get the announce-
ment of the investigations. And around 
this time, prior to the call, the Presi-
dent puts a freeze on the military aid. 
And then you have that call, and the 
minute that Zelensky brings up the de-
fense support and the desire to buy

more Javelins, that is when the Presi-
dent immediately goes to the favor he 
wants. 
So the Ukrainians, at this point, 
know that the White House meeting is 
conditioned on getting these investiga-
tions announced, but in that call, the 
minute military aid is brought up, the 
President pivots to the favor he wants 
of these investigations they already 
know about. 
Now, after that call, the Ukrainians 
quickly find out about the freeze in 
aid. According to the former Deputy 
Foreign Minister, they found out with-
in days. July 25 is the call. By the end 
of July, Ukraine finds out the aid is 
frozen. The Deputy Foreign Minister is 
told by Andriy Yermak: Keep this se-
cret. We don’t want this getting out. 
She had planned to come to Wash-
ington. They canceled her trip to 
Washington because they don’t want 
this made public. 
And so, in August, there is this effort 
to get the investigations announced. 
That is the only priority for the Presi-
dent and his men. So the Ukrainians 
know the aid is withheld. They know 
they can’t get the meeting. They know 
what the President wants, these inves-
tigations. And the Ukrainians, like the 
Americans, can add up two plus two 
equals four. But if they had any ques-
tion about that, Sondland removes all 
doubt on September 1 in Warsaw, when 
Sondland goes over—after the Pence- 
Zelensky meeting, he goes over to 
Yermak, and he says that ‘‘until you 
announce these investigations, you are 
not getting this aid.’’ 
He makes explicit what they already 
knew—that not just the meeting but 
the aid itself was tied. And on Sep-
tember 7, Sondland tells Zelensky di-
rectly: The aid is tied to your doing in-
vestigations. And it is at that point, on 
September 7, when Zelensky is told by 
Sondland directly of the quid pro quo, 
that Zelensky finally capitulates and 
says: All right; I will make the an-
nouncement on CNN. 
And then the President is caught. 
The scheme is exposed. The President 
is forced to release the aid. And what 
does Zelensky do? He cancels the CNN 
interview 
because 
the 
money 
was 
forced to be released when the Presi-
dent got caught. 
But that is the chronology here. 
Let’s make no mistake. The Ukrain-
ians are sophisticated actors. As one of 
the witnesses said, they found out very 
shortly after the hold. The Ukrainians 
have good tradecraft. They understood 
very quickly about this hold. 
And what would you expect when you 
are fighting a war and your ally is 
withholding military aid without ex-
planation and the only thing they tell 
you that they want from you are the 
announcement of these investigations? 
And if it wasn’t clear enough, they 
hammered them over the head with it 
and told Yermak on September 1: You 
are not getting the money without an-
nouncing these investigations. They 
tell Zelensky himself on September 7: 
You are not getting the money without 
these investigations. And finally the 
resistance of this anti-corruption re-
former, Zelensky, is broken down. He 
desperately needs the aid. Finally, the 
resistance is broken down: All right; I 
will do it. He is going to go on CNN. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Kansas. 
Mr. MORAN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
have a message to be sent to the desk, 
a question. It is on my behalf and on 
behalf 
of 
Senator 
RUBIO, 
Senator 
CRAPO, and Senator RISCH. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators MORAN, 
CRAPO, RUBIO, and RISCH for the coun-
sel for the President reads as follows: 
Impeachment and removal are dramatic 
and consequential responses to Presidential 
conduct, especially in an election year with 
a highly divided citizenry. Yet checks and 
balances is an important constitutional prin-
ciple. Does the Congress have other means— 
such as appropriations, confirmations, and 
oversight hearings—less damaging to our na-
tion? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. And yes, Congress has a lot of in-
cremental steps, a lot of means short of 
impeachment to address friction or 
conflicts with the executive branch. 
That was the point that I was making 
a moment ago with respect to what the 
Department of Justice has said in liti-
gation today where the absolute immu-
nity for senior advisers—actually, I 
think it was a different issue in that 
case. I beg your pardon. 
But anyway, there is a dispute in 
that case about information requests, 
and the point the DOJ was making 
there is the Constitution requires in-
cremental steps where there is friction 
between the branches. 
As I mentioned the other day, fric-
tion between the branches—between 
Congress and the executive—on infor-
mation requests in particular is part of 
the constitutional design. It has been 
with us since the first administration. 
George Washington denied requests 
from Congress for information about 
the negotiation of the Jay Treaty. So 
from the very beginning, there has 
been this friction leading to jockeying 
for position and accommodations and 
confrontation and leading to ways of 
working things out when Congress de-
mands information from the executive 
and the executive asserts to protect 
the institutional authorities of the ex-
ecutive branch, the sphere where the 
executive can be able to keep informa-
tion confidential. 
But the first step in response to that 
should be the accommodations process. 
And the courts have described that as 
constitutionally mandated, something 
that actually furthers the constitu-
tional scheme, to have the branches ne-
gotiate and try to come to an arrange-
ment that addresses the legitimate 
needs of both branches of the govern-
ment. 
Part of that accommodations process 
is—or as it gets—as the confrontation 
continues can involve Congress exer-
cising the levers of authority that it 
has under article I to try to put pres-
sure on the executive. So, for example, 
appropriations, not funding the policy 
priorities of a particular administra-
tion or cutting funding on some policy 
priorities; or legislation, not passing 
legislation that the President favors or 
passing 
other 
legislation 
that 
the 
President doesn’t favor. Or the Senate 
has the power not to approve nominees. 
As I am sure many of you well know, 
holding up nominees in committee can 
be effective in some points, putting 
pressure on an administration to get 
particular policies picked loose, things 
accomplished in a particular depart-
ment or agency. 
All of these elements of the interplay 
of the branches of government—that is 
part of the constitutional design. But 
impeachment is the very last resort for 
the very most serious conflict where 
there is no other way to resolve it. 
So there are all of these multiple in-
termediate steps, and they all should 
be used. They all should be exercised in 
an incremental fashion. That is exactly 
what didn’t happen in this case. There 
was no attempt at the accommoda-
tions. There was no attempt even to re-
spond to the legal issues, the legal de-
fects that counsel for the President and 
the departments and agencies pointed 
out in each of the subpoenas that were 
issued by the House committees. 
And even the issue of agency coun-
sel—there was no attempt to try to ne-
gotiate on that. And that is really 
something that, in the past—even last 
April, with the House Committee on 
Oversight 
and 
Government 
Reform 
with Chairman Cummings, there was a 
dispute about that. We wouldn’t allow 
a witness to go without agency coun-
sel, and then we had a meeting with 
Chairman 
Cummings, 
and 
it 
got 
worked out. And it was turned into a 
transcribed interview, I think, and 
the—but agency counsel was permitted 
to be there. But the committee got the 
interview. They got to talk to the per-
son. They got the information they 
wanted. But the executive branch got 
to have agency counsel there to protect 
executive branch interests. That is the 
way it is supposed to work, but there 
was no attempt at anything like that 
from the House in this case. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Massachusetts. 
Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chief Justice, I

House managers. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
Senator MARKEY’s question for the 
House managers reads as follows: 
It has recently been reported that the Rus-
sians have hacked the Ukrainian natural gas 
company Burisma, presumably looking for 
information on Hunter Biden. Our intel-
ligence community has warned us that the 
Russians will be interfering in the 2020 elec-
tion. If Donald Trump is acquitted of these 
pending charges but is later found to have 
invited Russian or other foreign interference

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S735 
January 30, 2020 
in our 2020 election, what recourse will there 
be for Congress under the Dershowitz stand-
ard for impeachment, which requires a presi-
dent to have committed a statutory crime? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, abso-
lutely no recourse. No recourse whatso-
ever. If, in fact, it were later to be 
shown that not only did the Russians 
hack Burisma to try to get dirt on the 
Bidens and drip, drip, drip it out as 
they did in the 2016 election—let’s say 
it were found that they did so at the re-
quest of the President of the United 
States; that in one of these meetings 
that the President had with Vladimir 
Putin, whose contents is unknown, 
that the President of the United States 
asked the President of Russia to hack 
Burisma because he couldn’t get the 
Ukrainians to do what he wanted, so 
now he was turning to the Russians to 
do it. Under the Dershowitz theory of 
the case, under the President’s theory 
of the case, that is perfectly fine. 
But that is not—that is not how bad 
it is because it goes further than that. 
If the President went further and said 
to Putin in that secret meeting: I want 
you to hack Burisma. I couldn’t get the 
Ukrainians to do it, and I will tell you 
what, if you hack Burisma and you get 
me some good stuff, then I am going to 
stop sending money to Ukraine. And I 
will go a step further. I am going to 
stop sending money to Ukraine so that 
they can’t fight you in Donbass. And 
what is more, those sanctions that we 
imposed on you for your intervention 
on my behalf in the last election, I am 
going to make those go away. I am 
going to simply refuse to enforce them. 
I am going to call it a policy dif-
ference. 
That is perfectly fine under their 
standard. That is not an abuse of 
power. You can’t say that is criminal. 
Yet it is akin to crime—or maybe it is 
not, but that is what an acquittal here 
means. It means that the President is 
free to engage in all the rest of that 
conduct, and it is perfectly fine. 
And what is the remedy that my col-
leagues representing the President say 
that you have to that abuse? Well, you 
can hold up a nominee. That seems 
wholly out of scale with the magnitude 
of the problem. That process of the ap-
propriations or nominations is not suf-
ficient for a Chief Executive Officer of 
the United States who will betray the 
national security for his own personal 
interests. 
He got on the phone with Zelensky 
asking for this favor the day after Bob 
Mueller testifies. What do you think he 
will be capable of doing the day after 
he is acquitted here, the day after he 
feels: I have dodged another bullet. I 
really am beyond the reach of the law. 
My Attorney General says I can’t be 
indicted; I can’t even be investigated. 
He closed the investigation into this 
matter before he even opened it. And I 
can’t be impeached either. I have got 
the best of both worlds. I have got Bill 
Barr saying I can’t be investigated. I 
can’t be prosecuted. I can be im-
peached, however. That is what Bill 
Barr says. But I have got other lawyers 
who say I can’t be impeached. 
That is a recipe for a President who 
is above the law. Not only is it not re-
quired by the Constitution—quite the 
contrary. The Founders knew, coming 
from a monarchy, that if they were 
going to give extraordinary powers to 
their new Executive, they needed an 
extraordinary constraint. They needed 
a constraint commensurate with the 
evil which they sought to contain. 
That remedy is not holding up a nomi-
nation. The remedy they gave for an 
Executive 
that 
would 
abuse 
their 
power and endanger the country, that 
would endanger the integrity of our 
elections, was the power of impeach-
ment. 
As one of the experts said in the 
House, if this conduct isn’t an im-
peachable offense, then nothing is. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from South Carolina. 
Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk on behalf of 
myself and Senators ALEXANDER, CRUZ, 
PORTMAN, TOOMEY, SULLIVAN, and MUR-
KOWSKI to the counsel for the Presi-
dent. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator GRAHAM 
and the other Senators is for the coun-
sel for the President: 
Assuming for argument’s sake that Bolton 
were to testify in the light most favorable to 
the allegations contained in the Articles of 
Impeachment, isn’t it true that the allega-
tions still would not rise to the level of an 
impeachable offense and that, therefore, for 
this and other reasons, his testimony would 
add nothing to this case? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
Let me start by just making very 
clear that there was no quid pro quo. 
There was no—and there is no evidence 
to show that. There was not that sort 
of linkage that the House managers 
have suggested. 
But let me answer the question di-
rectly, which I understand to be assum-
ing for the sake of argument that Am-
bassador Bolton would come and tes-
tify the way the New York Times arti-
cle alleges, the way his book describes 
the conversation. Then it is correct 
that, even if that happened, even if he 
gave that testimony, the Articles of 
Impeachment still wouldn’t rise to an 
impeachable offense. That is for at 
least two reasons. Let me explain that. 
The first is, on their face, the Arti-
cles of Impeachment, as they have been 
laid out by the House managers, even if 
you take everything that is alleged in 
them, they don’t, as a matter of law, 
rise to the level of an impeachable of-
fense because even the House managers 
haven’t characterized them as involv-
ing a crime. So that is one level of the 
answer, that an impeachable offense 
would require a crime. 
Even going beyond that, a second 
level, the theory of abuse of power that 
they have alleged—put aside whether 
or not it is a crime, the thory of abuse 
of power that they have asserted is not 
something that conforms with the con-
stitutional standard of high crimes and 
misdemeanors. It depends entirely on 
subjective intent, and it is subjective 
intent alone. 
As Professor Dershowitz explained, 
and as I have explained—and I don’t 
mean in the more radical portion of his 
explanation of his theory, I mean just 
in terms of what is high crimes and 
misdemeanors. 
He 
explained 
that 
something that is based entirely on 
subjective intent is equivalent to mal-
administration. It is equivalent to ex-
actly the standard that the Framers 
rejected because it is completely mal-
leable. It doesn’t define any real stand-
ard for an offense. It allows you to take 
any conduct that on its face is per-
fectly permissible, and on the basis of 
your projection of a disagreement with 
that conduct, a disagreement with the 
reasons for it to attribute a bad mo-
tive, to try to say there is a bad subjec-
tive motive for doing that and will 
make it impeachable, that doesn’t con-
form to the constitutional standard. 
At the common law, they would call 
the reaction to a charge like this a de-
murrer. You demur and simply say, 
even if everything you say is true, that 
is not an impeachable offense under the 
law. And that is an appropriate re-
sponse here. Even if everything you al-
lege is true, even if John Bolton would 
say it is true, that is not an impeach-
able offense under the constitutional 
standard because the way you have 
tried 
to 
define 
the 
constitutional 
standard, this theory of abuse of power 
is far too malleable. It goes purely to 
subjective intent. It can’t be relied 
upon. 
The third level of my answer is this. 
We have demonstrated that there is a 
legitimate public policy interest in 
both of the matters that were raised on 
that telephone call: the 2016 election 
interference and the Biden Burisma af-
fair. Because there is a legitimate pub-
lic policy interest in both of those 
issues, even if it were true that there 
was some connection, even if it were 
true that the President had suggested 
or thought that, well, maybe I should 
hold up this aid until they do some-
thing, that is perfectly permissible 
where there is that legitimate public 
policy interest. 
It is just the same as if there is an in-
vestigation going on. The President 
wants a foreign country to provide 
some assistance. It is a legitimate for-
eign policy interest to get that assist-
ance. It is legitimate to use the levers 
of foreign policy to secure that assist-
ance. So because there is a legitimate 
public policy interest in both of those 
issues—and I think we have dem-
onstrated that clearly—it would be per-
missible for there to be that linkage. 
But again, I will close where I began, 
which is there was no such linkage 
here. I just want to make that clear. 
But taking for the sake of argument 
the question as phrased, even if Ambas-
sador Bolton would testify to that,

even if you assumed it were true, there 
is no impeachable offense stated in the 
Articles of Impeachment. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The Senator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator DURBIN 
for the House managers: 
Would you please respond to the answer 
that was just given by the President’s coun-
sel? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, it 
has been a long couple of days, so let 
me be blunt about where I think we 
are. I think we all know what happened 
here. I think we all understand what 
the President did here. I don’t think 
there is really much question at this 
point about why the military aid was 
withheld or why President Zelensky 
couldn’t get in the door of the Oval Of-
fice. I don’t think there is any confu-
sion about why he wanted Joe Biden 
investigated or why he was pushing the 
CrowdStrike conspiracy theory. I don’t 
think there is really much question 
about that. I don’t think there is any 
question about what we could expect if 
and when John Bolton testifies, al-
though the details of which we cer-
tainly don’t know. I don’t think there 
is really much question about that. 
But what is extraordinary is, although 
they can claim that this was a radical 
mistake 
or 
notion 
of 
Professor 
Dershowitz that they seem to be 
distancing themselves from right now, 
I guess they think they are accusing 
Dershowitz now of some maladmin-
istration in his argument of the de-
fense—they are still embracing that 
idea. 
What they just told you admittedly 
in outline of A, B, and C, what they 
just told you is: accept everything the 
House said, accept the President with-
held the military aid to coerce Ukraine 
into helping him cheat in the election, 
accept that these investigations are a 
sham, accept that he obstructed all 
subpoenas and witnesses, accept all of 
that. Too bad. There is nothing you can 
do. That is not impeachable. 
A President of the United States— 
this is now where we have come to in 
this moment of our history, the Presi-
dent of the United States can withhold 
hundreds of millions of dollars in aid 
that we appropriated, can do so in vio-
lation of the law, can do so to coerce 
an ally, in order to help him cheat in 
an election, and you can’t do anything 
about it, except hold up a nomination. 
That is not impeachable. 
They can abuse their power all they 
want—the President, this President, 
the next President can abuse their 
power all they want in the furtherance 
of their reelection as long as—here is 
the limiting principle—as long as they 
think their reelection is in the na-
tional interest. Well, that is quite a 
constraint. That is where we have 
come now after 21⁄2 centuries of our his-
tory. 
I think our Founders would be aghast 
that anyone would make that argu-
ment on the floor of the Senate. I 
think they would be aghast, having 
come out of a monarchy, having lit-
erally risked their lives, having taken 
this great gamble that people could be 
entrusted to run their own government 
and choose their own leaders, recog-
nizing that we are not angels, setting 
up a system that would have ambition, 
counterambition, that we would so 
willingly abdicate that responsibility 
and say that a Chief Executive now has 
the full power to coerce our ally—a for-
eign power to intervene in our elec-
tion—because they think it is in the 
national interest that they get re-
elected. 
Is that really what we think the 
Founders would have condoned or do 
we think that this is precisely the kind 
of character of conduct that they pro-
vided a remedy for? I think we know 
the answer to that. 
They wrote a beautiful Constitution. 
They understood a lot about human na-
ture. They understood, as we do, that 
absolute power corrupts absolutely. 
And they provided a constraint, but it 
will only be as good and as strong as 
the men and women of this institu-
tion’s willingness to uphold it, to not 
look away from the truth. 
The truth is staring us in the eyes. 
We know why they don’t want John 
Bolton to testify. It is not because we 
don’t really know what happened here. 
They just don’t want the American 
people to hear it in all of its ugly, 
graphic detail. They don’t want the 
President’s National Security Advisor 
on live TV or even a nonlive deposition 
to say: I talked with the President, and 
he told me in no uncertain terms: 
John— 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. To be contin-
ued. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Georgia. 
Mrs. LOEFFLER. I send a question to 
the desk on behalf of myself and Sen-
ators HAWLEY, CRUZ, PERDUE, GARD-
NER, 
LANKFORD, 
HOEVEN, 
TOOMEY, 
SCOTT of Florida, PORTMAN, and FISCH-
ER. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator LOEFFLER 
and the other Senators is for the coun-
sel of the President: 
As reported by Politico, ‘‘in January 1999, 
then-Sen Joe Biden argued strongly against 
deposing additional witnesses or seeking new 
evidence in a memo sent to fellow Democrats 
ahead of Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial.’’ 
Politico reports that Sen SCHUMER agreed 
with Biden. Why should the Biden rule not 
apply here? 
Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Members of the Senate, in a 
memorandum dated January 5, 1999, 
that is captioned ‘‘Arguments in Sup-
port of Summary Impeachment Trial,’’ 
Senator Biden discussed some history 
first regarding two Senate impeach-
ment proceedings that were put for-
ward in the Senate that were sum-
marily decided. This is what he said: 
These two cases demonstrate that the Sen-
ate may dismiss articles of impeachment 
without holding a full trial or taking any 
evidence. Put another way, the Constitution 
does not impose on the Senate the duty to 
hold a trial. In fact, the Senate need not hold 
a trial even though the House wishes to 
present evidence and hold a full trial 
(Blount) and the elements of jurisdiction are 
present (English). 
He went on to say: 
In a number of previous impeachment 
trials, the Senate has reached the judgment 
in its constitutional role as sole trier of im-
peachments does not require it to take new 
evidence or hear live witness testimony. 
This follows from the Senate’s consider-
ation of motions for summary disposition in 
at least three trials [and it listed the three 
trials of Judges Ritter, Claiborne, and 
Nixon]. In each, the Senate considered a mo-
tion for summary disposition on the merits 
and in no case did the Senate decline to con-
sider a motion for summary disposition as 
beyond the Senate’s authority or as forbid-
den by the Constitution. 
The Framers did not mean that this 
political process was to be a partisan 
process. Instead, they meant it to be 
political in the higher sense. The proc-
ess was to be conducted in the way that 
would best secure the public interest 
or, in their phrase, the ‘‘general wel-
fare.’’ That was the Biden doctrine of 
impeachment proceedings. 
Now, some Members in this Chamber 
agreed with that. Some Members that 
serve on the—as managers also agreed 
with that. But now the rules are dif-
ferent. The rules are different because 
Manager SCHIFF just moments ago did 
what he is now famous for and created 
a conversation, purportedly from the 
President of the United States, regard-
ing Russia hacking of Burisma. And it 
is the same thing he did when he start-
ed his hearings. 
So this is a common practice. But if 
we want to look at common practice 
and common procedures, the Biden rule 
is one. I would like to address some-
thing else because we have heard it 
time and time again about two judges 
have decided this issue of executive 
privilege. I want to address two things 
very quickly. 
My very first case at the Supreme 
Court of the United States—and it was 
a long time ago, over 30—over 30 years 
ago, 33 years ago. My client lost in the 
district court. They said: Well, we will 
appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of 
Appeals. We went to the Ninth Circuit 
Court of Appeals, was not so successful 
and did not win there either. My client 
said: Well, what do we do? 
I said: We have one option. We can 
file a petition for certiorari to the Su-
preme Court of the United States. 
Chances are they are not going to take 
the case. But at this point, it is an im-
portant issue to you, so why don’t we 
proceed. My client agreed to proceed. 
A petition for certiorari was granted, 
and the Court reversed 9 to 0. And that 
is why you continue to utilize courts 
when appropriate. That is why you do 
it. And you don’t rely on what a dis-
trict court judge says.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S737 
January 30, 2020 
The last thing I want to say, they are 
asking you, as a Senate body, to waive 
executive privilege on the President of 
the United States. Think about that 
for a moment. They are asking you to 
vote to determine or have the Chief 
Justice in his individual capacity as 
Presiding Judge vote to waive execu-
tive privilege as it relates to the Presi-
dent of the United States. And that is 
what they think is the appropriate role 
for this proceeding to continue. I think 
you should adopt the Biden rule. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Colorado. 
Mr. BENNET. Mr. Chief Justice, 
thank you. I would like to send a ques-
tion to the desk on behalf of myself 
and Senator WARNER. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators BENNET 
and WARNER is to the House managers: 
Mr. Sekulow said that if the Senate votes 
for witnesses, he will call a long chain of wit-
nesses that will greatly lengthen the trial. 
Isn’t it true that the Senate will establish by 
majority vote which, and how many wit-
nesses there will be? Isn’t it also true that 
prior impeachment trials in the Senate com-
monly have heard witnesses who did not tes-
tify in the House? 
Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. I thank 
you, Mr. Chief Justice. I thank the dis-
tinguished Senators for their ques-
tions. 
It certainly is the case that all we 
are asking the Senate to do is to hold 
a full and fair trial consistent with the 
Senate’s responsibility—article I, sec-
tion 3 of this Constitution: ‘‘The Sen-
ate shall have the sole Power’’ with re-
spect to an impeachment trial. And 
this great institution has interpreted 
that, during the 15 different impeach-
ment trials that have taken place dur-
ing our Nation’s history, that a full 
and fair trial means witnesses, because 
this institution, every time it has held 
a trial, has heard witnesses all 15 
times, including in several instances 
where there were witnesses who did not 
testify in the House who testified in 
the Senate. 
Now, the point was raised earlier 
about Benghazi. And Trey Gowdy—he 
is a good man. I served with him. He is 
a very talented lawyer. I am sure he is 
pleased—the distinguished gentleman 
from the Palmetto State—that his 
name has been brought into this pro-
ceeding. But Trey Gowdy, according to 
one of the questions, said that the ad-
ministration 
didn’t 
cooperate. 
The 
White House, in that instance, and the 
State Department turned over tens of 
thousands of documents pursuant to a 
House subpoena. That is cooperation. 
Several witnesses appeared voluntarily 
in Benghazi, including GEN David 
Petraeus, former CIA Director; Susan 
Rice, who at the time was the National 
Security Advisor; Ben Rhodes, the Dep-
uty National Security Advisor; ADM 
Mike Mullen, former Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff; GEN Carter Ham, 
former commander of AFRICOM; De-
fense Secretary Leon Panetta, he also 
showed up; GEN Michael Flynn, former 
DIA Director. Who else showed up? The 
former Secretary of State, Hillary 
Clinton. She testified publicly under 
oath for 11 hours. That is cooperation. 
What happened in this particular in-
stance in the House? No documents, no 
witnesses, no information, no coopera-
tion, no negotiation, no reasonable ac-
commodation—blanket defiance. That 
is what resulted in the obstruction of 
Congress article. 
So all we are asking for is the Senate 
to hold a fair trial consistent with past 
practice. At every single trial this Sen-
ate has held, the average number of 
witnesses was 33. We cannot normalize 
lawlessness. We cannot normalize cor-
ruption. We cannot normalize abuse of 
power—a fair trial. 
Lastly, of the witnesses that did tes-
tify, voluntarily showed up, what did 
they have to say? These were Trump 
administration witnesses. 
Ambassador Sondland, how did he 
characterize the shakedown scheme, 
the geopolitical shakedown at the 
heart of these allegations? Ambassador 
Sondland, ‘‘quid pro quo’’; Ambassador 
Taylor, ‘‘crazy’’; Dr. Fiona Hill, ‘‘a do-
mestic political errand’’; Lieutenant 
Colonel Vindman, ‘‘improper’’; John 
Bolton, ‘‘drug deal.’’ 
What would the Framers have said? 
The highest of high crimes against the 
Constitution. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. ROMNEY. I have a question to 
send to the desk. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senator ROMNEY 
is for both parties, and I believe the 
House manager will go first: 
Do you have any evidence that anyone was 
directed by President Trump to tell the 
Ukrainians that security assistance was 
being held upon the condition of an inves-
tigation into the Bidens? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senator, the 
evidence that is currently in the 
record—there are two people who had 
direct conversations with the President 
about the conditioning of aid on the 
performance of the investigations. The 
first was Gordon Sondland, who on 
September 7 had a conversation with 
the President that thereafter he re-
layed to Tim Morrison as well as Am-
bassador Taylor. And in the conversa-
tion that Ambassador Sondland de-
scribed at the time, he said the Presi-
dent on the one hand said no quid pro 
quo but then went on to say that 
Zelensky has to announce these inves-
tigations and he should want to. 
So the President made the direct link 
to Ambassador Sondland. Ambassador 
Sondland then made a direct link—or 
had already made the direct link to 
Andriy Yermak. But the conversation 
with—the President had a conversation 
with Zelensky himself and conveyed 
what he had been informed by the 
President, that Zelensky was going to 
have to conduct these investigations. 
And that is when Zelensky made the 
commitment to go on CNN. 
So Ambassador Sondland has ac-
knowledged the tie between the two. 
So did Mick Mulvaney. And I think 
that video is now etched in our minds 
for all of history. Trying to walk that 
back as he may, he was quite adamant 
when he was asked about that, and the 
reporter even followed up when he said 
that part of the reason why they held 
up the aid was the desire for this inves-
tigation into 2016. And the reporter 
said: Well, what you are saying is a 
quid pro quo. You don’t get the money 
unless you do the investigation of the 
Democrats. And the Chief of Staff’s an-
swer was: ‘‘We do that all the time; get 
over it.’’ 
So you have it from the President’s 
own Chief of Staff. You have it from 
one of the three amigos, the Presi-
dent’s point people. And bear in mind, 
Ambassador Sondland—of course, not a 
Never Trumper; a million-dollar donor 
to the Trump inaugural; someone the 
President deputized to have a signifi-
cant part of the Ukraine portfolio; 
someone who, given he is an EU Am-
bassador, if this was about burden- 
sharing, would have said this was 
about burden-sharing, but he didn’t, of 
course. He said it was about the inves-
tigations. 
The third direct witness would be 
John Bolton if we are allowed to bring 
him before you. 
But there already are witnesses and 
evidence in the record of people who 
spoke directly to the President about 
this and to which the conditionality 
was made clear. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Mr. Chief 
Justice, Senator, thank you for your 
question. 
I believe the question was, is there 
any evidence that anyone told—that 
President Trump had anyone tell the 
Ukrainians directly that the aid was 
linked? I believe that was the question, 
and the answer in the House record is 
no. I described this on Saturday when I 
walked through it at length, and so I 
refer back to that presentation. 
Ambassador Sondland and Senator 
JOHNSON. Ambassador Sondland indi-
cated in approximately the September 
9 timeframe—as we all heard his state-
ment, he asked the President. The 
President said: ‘‘I want nothing. I want 
nothing. I want no quid pro quo.’’ 
And you heard a lot from the House 
managers about, go out to the micro-
phones or make this—do the right 
thing. But I believe the statement was, 
he needs to do the right thing. He 
needs to do what he campaigned on. 
Even early, Senator JOHNSON—again, 
because 
Ambassador 
Sondland 
told 
Senator JOHNSON that there was a link-
age. So Senator JOHNSON
asked the 
President directly, and we know the 
answer to that. The President said: 
Was there any connection—when Sen-
ator JOHNSON asked if there was any 
connection between security assistance 
and investigations, the President an-
swered: ‘‘No way. I would never do

that. Who told you that?’’ And the an-
swer was Sondland. And Ambassador 
Sondland had come to that presump-
tion prior to speaking to the President. 
And we saw the montage from Ambas-
sador Sondland about presumptions 
and assumptions and guessing and 
speculating and belief. So we also re-
member the montage in which Ambas-
sador Sondland was asked: Did anyone 
on the planet tell you that the aid was 
linked to the investigations? And his 
answer was no. 
So in the House record before us, 
there is no evidence that the President 
told anyone to tell the Ukrainians that 
the aid was linked. And, in fact, the ar-
ticle from the Daily Beast yesterday— 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Counsel. 
Mr. Counsel PURPURA. Thank you, 
Chief Justice. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator 
from Oregon. 
Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. Chief Justice, I 
send a question to the desk for Senator 
SCHATZ, for Senator CARPER, and for 
myself. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question is for the House man-
agers from Senators MERKLEY, SCHATZ, 
and CARPER: 
Yesterday, Alan Dershowitz stated that a 
President cannot be impeached for soliciting 
foreign interference in his re-election cam-
paign if he thinks it’s in the public interest. 
The President’s Counsel stated the President 
cannot be prosecuted for committing a 
crime. And the President himself has said ‘‘I 
have the right to do whatever I want as 
President.’’ Aren’t these views exactly what 
our Framers warned about: an imperial 
President escaping accountability? If these 
arguments prevail, won’t future Presidents 
have the unchecked ability to use their of-
fice to manipulate future elections like cor-
rupt foreign leaders in Russia and Ven-
ezuela? 
Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you for 
the question, Senators. Before I ad-
dress it, I just want to complete my an-
swer to the last question. 
On September 7, the President has a 
conversation with Gordon Sondland, 
and the President says: No quid pro 
quo, but Zelensky has got to go to the 
mic, and he should want to do so. 
This is in the context of whether the 
aid is being withheld in order to secure 
the investigations. After that call on 
the same day, Sondland calls Zelensky, 
the President of Ukraine, and says: 
You are not going to get the money un-
less you do the investigations. 
So you have got the communication 
between the President and Sondland 
and Sondland conveying the message 
to the Ukrainians in short succession. 
And so I think you see that the mes-
sage the President gave to Sondland 
was, in fact, communicated imme-
diately to the Ukrainians. 
Of course, Sondland went on to ex-
plain to Ambassador Taylor and to Tim 
Morrison that the President wanted 
Zelensky in a public box. What was 
meant by that is he wanted him to 
have to go out and announce publicly 
these investigations if he were going to 
get the money. Remember, Sondland 
explained that the President is a busi-
nessman, and before he gives away 
something, he wants to—before he 
signs the check, he wants to get the de-
liverable. 
Ambassador 
Taylor 
says: 
That doesn’t make any sense. Ukraine 
doesn’t owe him anything. 
So it was clear to everyone, including 
the Ukrainians, that they were not 
going to get the money unless they did 
the investigations that the President 
wanted. That is the connection on Sep-
tember 7 that makes it crystal clear. 
In terms of the Dershowitz argument, 
when coupled with a President who be-
lieves that, under article II, he can do 
whatever he wants, yes. I mean, this is 
the description of a President, not just 
of an imperial President but of an abso-
lute President with absolute power be-
cause, if a President can take this ac-
tion and extort one country, he can ex-
tort any country. If he can make a deal 
with the President of Venezuela or 
take an action that is antagonistic to 
what Congress has legislated with re-
spect to that country and can violate 
the law in doing it to get help in his re-
election—and I think that example 
that Senator KING asked about is di-
rectly on point—then there is no lim-
iting principle here, as long as the 
President thinks it is in the interest of 
his reelection. 
So, yes, he can ask the Israeli Prime 
Minister to come to the United States 
and call his opponent an anti-Semite if 
he wants to get U.S. military aid. That 
principle can be applied anywhere to 
anything, to the grave danger of the 
country. 
That is the logical extension not just 
to what Professor Dershowitz said yes-
terday but to what the President’s 
counsel said today. You can accept 
every fact of the articles, and we still 
think it is fine and beyond the reach of 
the Constitution. The President can ex-
tort an ally by withholding military 
aid and withholding meetings. He can 
ask them to do sham investigations, 
even if you acknowledge the fact that 
they are a sham. In fact, they don’t 
even have to be done; they just have to 
be announced, and there is nothing 
Congress can do about it. That is a pre-
scription for a President with no con-
straint. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
Mr. Manager. 
The Senator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. Chief Justice, I, 
along with Senator LEE, send to the 
desk a question for the President’s 
counsel. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. 
The question from Senators BRAUN 
and LEE
is for the counsel for the 
President: 
Under Professor Dershowitz’s theory, is 
what Joe Biden is alleged to have done po-
tentially impeachable, in contrast to what 
has been alleged against President Trump? 
Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Jus-
tice, Senators, thank you for the ques-
tion. 
I 
believe 
that, 
under 
Professor 
Dershowitz’ theory, remember, he tried 
to categorize things into three buckets. 
One was of purely good motives. One 
was, well, you might have some motive 
for your personal political gain, as well 
as public interest motives for doing 
something or intent. Then there was 
the third bucket of purely private pe-
cuniary gain. He said that is the one, if 
you are doing it for purely private pe-
cuniary gain, that has the problem. 
I think that would be the distin-
guishing factor in what is potentially a 
presence in the facts known about the 
Biden and Burisma incident because 
the conflict of interest that would be 
apparent on the face of the facts that 
are known is that there would be a per-
sonal, family financial interest in that 
situation. 
Vice President Biden is in charge of 
Ukraine policy. His son is sitting on 
the board of a company that is known 
for corruption. The public reports are 
that, apparently, the prosecutor gen-
eral was investigating that company 
and its owner, the oligarch, at the 
time. Then Vice President Biden quite 
openly said that he leveraged $1 billion 
in U.S. loan guarantees to ensure that 
that particular prosecutor was fired at 
that time. 
One could put together fairly easily 
from those known facts the suggestion 
that there was a family financial ben-
efit coming from the end of that inves-
tigation because it protected the posi-
tion of the younger Biden on the board, 
and that would be a purely private pe-
cuniary—financial—gain. That is the 
third bucket that Professor Dershowitz 
was describing and the one that is nec-
essarily problematic when he said that 
that is where there is going to be a 
problem, that that is where you would 
have a crime and a potentially im-
peachable offense. 
So I think that would be the distinc-
tion there. That is one that, if all of 
those facts lined up under Professor 
Dershowitz’ categorization of things, 
would be the problematic category. 
Thank you. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel. 
The Senator from Minnesota. 
Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. Chief Justice, 
on behalf of myself, Senator CARDIN, 
and Senator VAN
HOLLEN, I have a 
question for the House managers that I 
will submit to the desk.

BUCHAR and Senators CARDIN and VAN 
HOLLEN is directed to the House man-

dent’s counsel is the usual nonsense.

have witnesses. We are told we can’t

House says we proved our case, as we 
have. So why should we need wit-
nesses? Well, that is like saying that, 
in a bank robbery, the DA announces 
that he has proved his case. He has had 
all the witnesses. Then an eyewitness 
shows up, and he shouldn’t be allowed 
to testify because, after all, the DA 
was sure he proved his case first. That 
is absurd, and any 10-year-old knows it 
is absurd. 
That is the President’s case against 
witnesses, that we have had enough. 
There is always more. There aren’t too 
many more here. The fact is, when 
there are witnesses to be asked, they 
should be asked. 
Second, there is only one real ques-
tion in this trial. Everything else is a 
distraction—a three-card Monte game 
being played by the President’s coun-
sel—distractions. Don’t look at the 
real question. Look at everything else. 
Everything else is irrelevant. Look at 
the whistleblower—irrelevant. Look at 
the House procedures—irrelevant. Look 
at Hunter Biden—irrelevant. Look at 
whether President Obama’s policy was 
as good as or better than President 
Trump’s 
policy 
with 
respect 
to 
Ukraine—irrelevant. 
Look 
at 
the 
Steele dossier—irrelevant. 
There is only one relevant question: 
Did the President abuse his power by 
violating the law to withhold military 
aid from a foreign country and extort 
that country into helping him—into 
helping his reelection campaign—by 
slandering his opponent? That is the 
only relevant question for the trial. 
The House managers have proved 
that question beyond any doubt. 
The one thing the House managers 
think the President’s counsel got right 
is quoting me as saying ‘‘beyond any 
doubt.’’ It is, indeed, beyond any doubt. 
That is why all of these distractions. 
That is why the President’s people are 
telling you to avoid witnesses—because 
they are afraid of witnesses. They 
know the witnesses—they know Mr. 
Bolton and others will only strengthen 
the case. 
And, yes, we hear: Well, if the House 
managers say their case is so strong, 
why do you need more witnesses? Be-
cause the truth can be bolstered. 
I yield back. 
The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, 
counsel.

IN RECOGNITION OF MR. TERRY 
GEILING UPON HIS RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE 
AMERICAN 
GOLD 
STAR MANOR 
HON. ALAN S. LOWENTHAL 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. LOWENTHAL. Madam Speaker, I want 
to recognize the leadership and accomplish-
ments of Mr. Terry Geiling, who has, after 12 
years serving as President and CEO of the 
American Gold Star Manor, announced his re-
tirement. 
Located in Long Beach, California, the Gold 
Star Manor is a one-of-a-kind 25-acre retire-
ment community providing affordable housing 
for 400 Gold Star Mothers, fathers, veterans, 
and other eligible seniors. 
During Mr. Geiling’s leadership tenure, he 
oversaw a major expansion and renovation of 
the facility, marshalling the resources of state, 
federal, county, and city agencies through his 
tireless efforts. 
He showed unparalleled determination in 
building important partnerships and developing 
the necessary financial plans to ensure the 
completion of the $55 million rehabilitation 
project. By the completion of the work, Mr. 
Geiling had built the Gold Star Manor into a 
nationally recognized housing facility for vet-
erans and their families. 
In the midst of the Gold Star Manor rehabili-
tation project, Mr. Geiling also played a key 
role in the development and construction of a 
Fisher House at the Tibor Rubin Veterans Af-
fairs Medical Center in Long Beach. 
While his leadership at American Gold Star 
Manor will be dearly missed, he will continue 
to support the organization as a consultant for 
another major expansion project that will de-
velop 150 additional housing units at the 
manor. 
Mr. Geiling is a pillar of the Long Beach 
community, a tireless advocate for our vet-
erans and their families, and his name is syn-
onymous with honorable public service. 
I want to offer my deepest appreciation to 
Mr. Geiling for his service to our country, his 
dedication to our veterans and their families, 
and his deep commitment to the Long Beach 
community. 
I wish him the very best of luck in future.

CELEBRATING 
OCCIDENTAL 
COL-
LEGE 
UPWARD 
BOUND’S 
55TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
HON. JIMMY GOMEZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. GOMEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Upward Bound at Occidental Col-
lege as it celebrates its 55th anniversary. As 
one of the country’s oldest and most success-
ful Upward Bound programs, Oxy Upward 
Bound has been assisting low-income, under-
served, and first-generation students from cen-
tral and northeast Los Angeles achieve suc-
cess both in their pre-college achievement and 
their higher education pursuits. 
Through one-on-one academic advisement, 
weekly academic enrichment services, work-
shops, cultural activities, and a summer resi-
dential experience, Oxy Upward Bound’s pro-
grams helps students develop key skill sets 
that positively impact their academic perform-
ances in high school while also exposing and 
guiding them through the rigors of the college 
experience. 
Oxy Upward Bound works to ensure schol-
ars graduate from high school with a solid 
post-secondary plan—both academic and fi-
nancial—and those students can graduate 
from a 4-year college or university in 6 years 
or less. 
Over the past five years, 99 percent of Oxy 
Upward Bound students have advanced a 
grade level or graduated from high school, 
with 90 percent of those graduating from high 
school going on to enroll in college. 
Among college access programs, Oxy Up-
ward Bound stands out in that its chief goal is 
not to produce applicants to Occidental—al-
though some participants have ended up en-
rolling at and graduating from the College— 
but to contribute to higher education nation-
wide and empower students to triumph over 
systematic, institutional barriers to opportunity 
and progress. 
As Oxy Upward Bound celebrates 55 years 
of success, I am confident it will continue to 
inspire and serve students for even more 
years to come. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Upward Bound at Occidental 
College on their anniversary for their excellent 
work on behalf of students in Los Angeles.

TIM HORNE 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Tim Horne who is retiring 
after 27 years of public service. 
Tim began his career with the General Serv-
ices Administration in 1993 in the Rocky 
Mountain Region. He worked his way up and 
is retiring as the Regional Commissioner for 
the Rocky Mountain Region of GSA’s Public 
Buildings Service based out of the Denver 
Federal Center, located in the heart of my dis-
trict. The Denver Federal Center is an impor-
tant asset with the highest concentration of 
federal agencies located outside of Wash-
ington, D.C. comprised of approximately 28 
federal agencies and more than 6,000 federal 
employees. 
Tim also served as the Acting GSA Admin-
istrator in 2017 leading GSA’s staff of 12,000 
nationwide, overseeing more than 375 million 
square feet of property, and approximately 
$50 billion in annual contracts. These posi-
tions reflect his leadership abilities, passion for 
public service, and a true talent for bringing 
people together to get things done and im-
prove local communities. 
In his years of service, he has worked with 
me and my staff on a number of important 
issues and projects that impact federal agen-
cies and federal employees in my district and 
the state. Tim always held the mission of GSA 
and the agencies and employees he served in 
high regard and worked to find innovative so-
lutions on behalf of those he served. 
I want to congratulate Tim Horne on a long 
and distinguished career, and I wish him all 
the best in his future endeavors.

RECOGNIZING MIKE PERSON OF 
GLENDIVE 
HON. GREG GIANFORTE 
OF MONTANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. GIANFORTE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today, ahead of the Super Bowl, to honor Mike 
Person of Glendive for his resiliency and de-
termination and for serving as an example of 
never giving up on your dreams. 
Two weeks ago, Person helped the San 
Francisco 49ers beat the Green Bay Packers 
to earn a spot in Super Bowl LIV. As an offen-
sive lineman, he helped the 49ers rack up 287 
rushing yards and set a new franchise record 
for rushing yards from one running back in a 
game. 
Person’s story starts in Glendive where he 
was born and raised. In high school, he was 
a three-time all-conference selection in Mon-
tana’s Eastern A division. He earned offensive 
lineman of the year honors twice while playing 
for the Red Devils. For his junior and senior 
seasons, he was all-state and selected for 
Montana’s East-West Shrine Game as well as 
the Knights of Columbus Badlands Bowl. 
Person then went to play for Montana State 
University where he became a first-team all- 
conference selection, first-team all-American, 
and a Big Sky Conference champion. 
Person’s story, however, is about more than 
statistics and honors. It’s about Person’s chal-
lenging journey to get to where he is today. 
In 2011, Person was a seventh-round draft 
pick for San Francisco. Nothing is guaranteed 
in the National Football League, especially for 
a seventh-round pick. 
For the first part of his career, Person was 
a journeyman, playing for six different teams. 
He was released midseason from three dif-
ferent teams which eventually made it to the 
Super Bowl. For some players, that much ad-
versity would lead to an early retirement, but 
Person stood strong and kept moving forward 
until he eventually returned to the 49ers. 
In May 2018, Person’s hard work and dedi-
cation paid off, and he signed a contract to

play with the 49ers. Then in March 2019, San 
Francisco gave him a three-year extension, 
and now he’ll play in the Super Bowl on Sun-
day. 
Madam Speaker, for his tenacity and resil-
iency, I recognize Mike Person of Glendive for 
his Spirit of Montana.

ROBERT ERPELDING 
HON. PAUL MITCHELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. MITCHELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Robert 
Franklin Erpelding, a loving father, husband, 
and grandfather of Michigan. Bob moved to 
Detroit as a child and enlisted in the Navy in 
1951 during the Korean War. He served as a 
radarman on the USS Watts, a Navy de-
stroyer. Following his service in the armed 
forces, he worked for over 30 years on com-
puters at the Burroughs Corporation. 
After his long and admirable career, he 
began his next phase of life as a vintner, 
model plane designer, and craft brew enthu-
siast. 
Bob was an upstanding man who led by ex-
ample and encouraged his friends and family 
to appreciate the little things in life. He will be 
missed dearly by his wife, Marguerite, his two 
children Laura Cox and Robert Erpelding, as 
well as his grandchildren and great-grand-
daughters.

IN RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL 
SCHOOL CHOICE WEEK 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize School Choice Week. 
As a father of two, I am well-versed with the 
parental drive to give your child the best op-
portunities possible in life. Each student de-
serves a rich, challenging curriculum to pre-
pare them for success, and I believe parents 
have the right to select the best school that 
will provide them with the best education. 
Millions of American students are trapped in 
schools that do not meet their aptitudes and 
needs, and as a nation, we face a tragically 
high dropout rate. In Arkansas, one in every 
twenty high school students will drop out be-
fore graduation, and this statistic mirrors the 
national rate. School choice most benefits stu-
dents from low-income families, whose par-
ents cannot buy a new home in a zip code 
with a better-performing public school. 
I support school vouchers and other innova-
tive educational options, such as magnet and 
charter schools, because they give parents the 
flexibility to place their child in the school that 
best meets their educational needs. As law-
makers, we owe families the right to access a 
high-quality education, unrestricted by zip 
code or income. 
IN RECOGNITION OF THE VICTIMS 
OF THE BAKU AND SUMGAIT PO-
GROMS 
HON. FRANK PALLONE, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 32nd Anniversary of the 
Sumgait pogrom and the 30th Anniversary of 
the Baku pogrom. 
On February 27, 1988, hundreds of Arme-
nian civilians living in the city of Sumgait in 
Azerbaijan were indiscriminately killed, raped, 
maimed, and even burned alive for no reason 
other than their ethnicity. This senseless vio-
lence was instigated by hostile, anti-Armenian 
rhetoric from Azerbaijani citizens and officials. 
Similarly, on January 12, 1990, a seven-day 
pogrom broke out against the Armenian popu-
lation in Baku during which Armenians were 
beaten, murdered, and expelled from the city. 
Over 90 Armenian civilians were killed, over 
700 were injured, and countless others were 
permanently displaced by the ethnic violence 
that ensued. 
For over three decades, Azerbaijan has 
taken steps to cover up these crimes against 
humanity and dismiss the atrocities at Sumgait 
and Baku. Even more disturbing is that the 
perpetrators of this event and similar violent 
attacks have been lauded as national heroes 
by the Azeri government. 
It is critical for the United States government 
to recognize and denounce violent assaults 
against any civilians. I continue to stand with 
the Armenian people in condemning this hor-
rific massacre. Tragically, the Azerbaijani gov-
ernment’s approach toward the Armenian peo-
ple has changed little since the pogroms were 
initiated. We still hear the same violent rhet-
oric and witness intimidation tactics aimed at 
the people of the Republic of Artsakh. 
If we do not condemn crimes against hu-
manity and allow them to go unpunished and 
unrecognized, we only strengthen the resolve 
of those seeking to perpetrate these crimes in 
the future. It is especially critical to consider 
this as we prepare to commemorate the 105th 
Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide in 
April. 
I will continue to work with my colleagues 
on the Congressional Armenian Issues Cau-
cus to remember the victims of the pogroms at 
Sumgait and Baku and condemn all acts of vi-
olence against people who are targeted simply 
because of their existence. I hope my col-
leagues will join me in rejecting violent rhetoric 
and intimidation. In doing so, we renew our 
commitment to achieving a lasting peace and 
more humane way of living in the Caucasus.

HONORING BUDDY BAKER’S INDUC-
TION 
INTO 
THE 
2020 
NASCAR 
HALL OF FAME 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the legacy of racing legend Buddy 
Baker upon his induction into the eleventh 
class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 
A native of Charlotte, Buddy Baker was a 
towering figure in the world of NASCAR and in 
1980, won the Daytona 500 with an average 
race speed of 177.602 MPH—a track record 
that stands today. During his 33-year career, 
he accumulated 19 premier series wins, back- 
to-back Coca-Cola 600 titles, and a Southern 
500 victory where he lapped the rest of the 
field. 
Buddy 
Baker 
retired 
in 
1992 
and 
transitioned to television and radio, where he 
was a successful commentator for The Nash-
ville Network and CBS and radio co-host on 
Late Shift and Tradin’ Paint for SiriusXM 
NASCAR Radio. He passed away in 2015 and 
left behind a legacy of racing excellence and 
remains one of the sport’s fastest drivers. 
This year’s class was selected by a com-
prehensive voting panel that included track 
owners, competitors, members of the media, 
industry leaders, a nationwide fan vote, and 
the reigning Monster Energy NASCAR Cup 
Series champion. In total, a group of five was 
chosen to join the ranks of other NASCAR 
legends in the Hall of Fame. Buddy Baker is 
especially deserving of this honor and will now 
be enshrined forever for his remarkable con-
tributions to racing. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
honoring the legacy of Buddy Baker on his in-
duction into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

CONGRATULATING 
MAX 
FISHER 
FOR 
BEING 
NAMED 
MOORESTOWN, 
NEW 
JERSEY’S 
CITIZEN OF THE YEAR 
HON. ANDY KIM 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. KIM. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
congratulate one of my constituents, Max 
Fisher of Moorestown, New Jersey, for being 
named as his town’s 2020 Citizen of the Year. 
Each year, the Citizen of the Year Award is 
presented by the Moorestown Service Council 
to a resident who through service activities 
has significantly contributed to improving the 
quality of life of the community and their fellow 
citizens. This year’s recipient has not just 
been contributing to his community in the last 
year, but has been an institution of service 
and volunteerism in Moorestown for decades. 
Max Fisher moved onto Main Street in 
Moorestown when he was just four years old, 
and he and his wife Beth have lived and 
raised their children here since. Max has been 
an active member of the First United Meth-
odist Church of Moorestown, organizing and 
participating in over 25 church mission trips in 
New Jersey and around the nation, helping to 
rebuild in communities devastated by Hurri-
canes Charlie, Katrina and Sandy. He been a 
mainstay on the Moorestown Ecumenical 
Neighborhood 
Development 
Committee 
(MEND) for 20+ years, and has been Chair-
man for the past 12 years. He was an original 
member of the YMCA’s Men’s Service Club, 
and has been a member of the Moorestown 
Volunteer Fire Department since 1971. 
Max has also run the Taylor Rental Center 
in Moorestown for the last 30 years. His gen-
erosity 
has 
been 
legendary 
around 
Moorestown: Max was always quick to lend a 
hand and say ‘‘yes’’ when a service organiza-
tion needed to borrow some of his equipment

It is a privilege to be able to congratulate 
Max Fisher as the Moorestown Service Coun-

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. ELAINE G. LURIA 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mrs. LURIA. Madam Speaker, on January 
30, 2020, I was absent from the House cham-
ber due to my presence at my mother-in-law’s 
funeral. Had I been present and voting, I 
would have opposed both amendments to 
H.R. 550. 
As a 20-year Navy veteran who served in 
the Middle East and is currently serving a dis-
trict in Hampton Roads, where one in five resi-
dents is active duty, a veteran, or an imme-
diate family member, I took this decision very 
seriously and personally. From our district, the 
Harry S. Truman Canier Shike Group, the Ba-
taan Amphibious Readiness group, and ap-
proximately ten thousand sailors and marines 
are deployed to the Middle East defending our 
national security interests. 
The use of military force must be a last re-
sort after all other options are exhausted. 
However, a strong presence in the Middle 
East is necessary to send the message that 
America is committed to ending Iran’s mali-
cious activities and to prevent Iran from ac-
quiring nuclear capabilities. 
Under the Constitution, only Congress has 
the authority and power to declare war. Unfor-
tunately, the pieces of legislation that we are 
debating do not address the underlying prob-
lem: that we are operating under a nearly two 
decade-old Authorization for the Use of Mili-
tary Force (AUMF). 
Issues of life and death or war and peace 
should not be made on party lines using a 
procedural rule to silence the other side. We 
owe it to our troops to define their mission and 
take on the hard task of uniting as a governing 
body to replace the outdated AUMFs. 
Today, I would like to submit my opposition 
into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD because if 
we must send more Americans to war, Con-
gress has the responsibility to debate a new 
AUMF that will shape war and peace for dec-
ades to come.

RECOGNITION OF EDWARD WANG, 
2019 CONGRESSIONAL APP WINNER 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Edward Wang, winner of the Congres-
sional App Challenge for Arizona’s Fifth Dis-
trict. This competition is offered to middle and 
high school students nationwide in search for 
an original app that is programmed to provide 
a service beneficial to society. 
Mr. Wang’s app, ProAssign, embraces the 
App Challenge’s mission: Inspire, Include, In-
novate. ProAssign inspires students to im-
prove their math and problem-solving skills by 
using a modern resource. Mr. Wang’s submis-
sion includes each student’s understanding of 
mathematics by assigning additional practice 
problems to strengthen their skills. His app en-
ables teachers to innovate their teaching 
methods by modernizing the learning environ-
ment to better relate to today’s students. 
I have no doubt that Mr. Wang will continue 
to inspire our nation’s youth to imagine bold 
solutions to the educational challenges of the 
twenty-first century. I am honored to have 
such talent and leadership in my district.

HONORING 2020 NASCAR HALL OF 
FAME INDUCTEE JOE GIBBS 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate my friend and rac-
ing legend Joe Gibbs upon his induction into 
the eleventh class of the NASCAR Hall of 
Fame. 
A titan of NASCAR, Joe Gibbs ranks third 
all-time with over 160 premier series owner 
wins. After starting Joe Gibbs Racing in 1992, 
he saw his organization accumulate three 
Daytona 500 victories, five Brickyard 400 
championships, five Xfinity Series titles, and 
four premier series championships with drivers 
Bobby Lobonte, Tony Stewart, and Kyle 
Busch. 
Referred to by colleagues as ‘‘Coach,’’ Joe 
Gibbs is a three-time Super Bowl champion 
football coach who was enshrined into the Pro 
Football Hall of Fame in 1996. Since then, he 
has become the heart and soul of racing and 
I am proud that he has taken his place among 
the greats in the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 
This year’s class was selected by a com-
prehensive voting panel that included track 
owners, competitors, members of the media, 
industry leaders, a nationwide fan vote, and 
the reigning Monster Energy NASCAR Cup 
Series champion. In total, a group of five was

pecially deserving of this honor and will now

friend, Laura Smith, who is retiring from Yale 
University after thirty-nine years of dedicated 
service. In a career that has spanned four 
decades, Laura has become a fixture at the 
University, earning a respected reputation for 
her dedication as well as her commitment to 
her colleagues. 
Laura’s career at Yale began in the Bursar’s 
Office where she served as a Collection Cor-
respondent in the Student Loan Collection De-
partment. In the decade that she spent there, 
she built lasting memories—many of which in-
clude calls made using a rotary phone as well 
as tracking collections with microfiche and pin- 
fed spreadsheets. Those of us who can re-
member using those technology trends can 
appreciate the humor with which she recalls 
those years. Laura’s second decade with Yale 
began as an Editorial Assistant in the Alumni 
Records Department where she was tasked 
with maintaining the class reunion directories. 
Shortly after beginning this new role, the De-
partment was merged with the Office of Devel-
opment which has been Laura’s professional 
home ever since. Over the course of her ten-
ure in the Office of Development, Laura has 
held a myriad of positions and taken on a vari-
ety of responsibilities—all in support of alumni 
activities and communications. 
In addition to her years of service within De-
velopment, Laura has been involved with the 
Local 34 union as an active member and lead-
er throughout her career. In 1994, Laura was 
elected President of Local 34, a position in 
which she served for sixteen years. It was in 
her role with Local 34 that I had the oppor-
tunity to work closely with Laura. Her leader-
ship, vision, compassion, and commitment not 
only inspired her members, but in all of us 
who support the labor movement. She proudly 
stood shoulder to shoulder with her hard-work-
ing colleagues, fighting to ensure that they 
were receiving a living wage, working in a safe 
environment, and were secure in their health 
and retirement. Laura was and is a passionate 
advocate for workers’ rights and has long 
been a pillar of support for her union col-
leagues. Her tireless advocacy and unwaver-
ing support for her union brothers and sisters 
will most certainly be missed, though I have 
no doubt that she will continue to find ways to 
contribute to the cause. 
Today, as Laura marks the end of her pro-
fessional career, I hope that she knows how 
many lives she has touched and what a dif-
ference she has made. I am proud to stand 
today to extend my heartfelt congratulations to 
Laura Smith as she celebrates her retirement. 
I wish her all the best for many more years of 
health and happiness.

HONORING 2020 NASCAR HALL OF 
FAME INDUCTEE BOBBY LABONTE 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate racing legend 
Bobby Labonte upon his induction into the 
eleventh class of the NASCAR Hall of Fame. 
Bobby Labonte perfectly embodies the 
NASCAR spirit. Before becoming a premier 
series driver in 1993, he was known to race 
any car he could find. His persistence paid off 
when he became the first of four drivers to win 
both the Xfinity Series and a premier series 
championship. 
During 
his 
exceptional 
career, 
Bobby 
Labonte accumulated 21 premier series wins, 
four Brickyard 400 championships, and a 
Southern 500 victory. Along with his brother, 
Terry Labonte, Bobby represents a pair of just 
two racing brothers who each claim a premier 
series championship. 
This year’s class was selected by a com-
prehensive voting panel that included track 
owners, competitors, members of the media, 
industry leaders, a nationwide fan vote, and 
the reigning Monster Energy NASCAR Cup 
Series champion. In total, a group of five was 
chosen to join the ranks of other NASCAR 
legends in the Hall of Fame. Bobby Labonte is 
especially deserving of this honor and will now 
be enshrined forever for his remarkable con-
tributions to racing. 
Madam Speaker, please join me today in 
congratulating Bobby Labonte on his induction 
into the NASCAR Hall of Fame.

STEPHANIE

HON. HARLEY ROUDA

Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. ROUDA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Stephanie Winstead for her ex-
traordinary service as the Chair of the Board 
for the Laguna Niguel Chamber of Commerce. 
A graduate of Chapman University College 
of Law, Ms. Winstead has diligently worked to 
represent her clients’ interests while continuing 
to give back to the Laguna Niguel community. 
Further, her leadership skills have enabled her 
to create and implement new programs that 
have improved the quality of life of our friends 
and neighbors. 
Under Ms. Winstead’s leadership, she em-
powered local business leaders to enhance 
their impact on the community. She also 
played a key role in expediting the Holiday 
Shop Laguna Niguel Program to keep sales 
tax dollars in the city as well as encouraged 
Board members and staff to seek professional 
development through programs offered by the 
California Chamber of Commerce. 
I ask all Members to join me in recognizing 
the outstanding work of Stephanie Winstead.

TEMPORARY 
REAUTHORIZATION 
AND STUDY OF THE EMERGENCY 
SCHEDULING 
OF 
FENTANYL 
ANALOGUES ACT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, January 29, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of S. 3201—the Temporary Reau-
thorization and Study of the Emergency 
Scheduling of Fentanyl Analogues Act, al-
though I have reservations about the impact of 
the bill on African American men. 
I am concerned that provisions in this bill 
will have an unintended impact on African 
Americans being disproportionately charged 
and sentenced to prison. In 2018, 77 percent 
of individuals prosecuted for fentanyl related 
substances were people of color. This is not 
acceptable. The average sentence for fentanyl 
trafficking offenders was 74 months; 97.4 per-
cent were sentenced to prison. 
In 2018, the DEA issued a temporary order 
which placed 17 fentanyl related substances 
on Schedule I of the list of controlled sub-
stances. The order expires on Thursday, Feb-
ruary 6, 2020, and could not be extended 
without congressional action, which extends 
the order until May 6, 2021. 
While I understand the need to combat 
fentanyl abuse, we cannot allow our solutions 
to disproportionately hurt our community. 
Since this is a temporary reauthorization, I will 
continue to work to ensure that the issue of 
mandatory minimums, as it relates to fentanyl, 
does not disproportionately affect African 
American. This temporary extension will give 
us time to work on long term solutions that do 
not have the potential to negatively impact our 
communities of color. 
HONORING 2020 NASCAR HALL OF 
FAME INDUCTEE TONY STEWART 
HON. RICHARD HUDSON 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. HUDSON. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor and congratulate my friend and rac-
ing legend Tony Stewart upon his induction 
into the eleventh class of the NASCAR Hall of 
Fame. 
Known for his grit and blue-collar style of 
competition, Tony Stewart captivated America 
with three victories in his debut season. With 
a nickname like ‘‘Smoke,’’ he understandably 
ran away with the 1999 Winston Cup Rookie 
of the Year award. 
Throughout his 17-year career, Tony Stew-
art won three premier series championships 
and was one of the most versatile drivers in 
NASCAR. He accumulated 49 premier series 
wins, two Brickyard 400 championships in his 
home state, and tallied victories on every style 
of track. After forming Stewart-Haas Racing in 
2009, he saw his organization post 51 wins 
and mount one of the most memorable cham-
pionship pursuits in history. 
This year’s class was selected by a com-
prehensive voting panel that included track 
owners, competitors, members of the media, 
industry leaders, a nationwide fan vote, and 
the reigning Monster Energy NASCAR Cup 
Series champion. In total, a group of five was

As an engine builder and crew chief, 
Waddell 
Wilson

TRIBUTE 
TO 
BRIAN 
WHEELER 
FROM 
THE 
TRANSPORTATION 
SECURITY ADMINISTRATION 
HON. LUCILLE ROYBAL-ALLARD 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Madam Speaker, 
the Transportation Security Administration 
(TSA) will soon bid farewell to its Senior Advi-
sor for Congressional Appropriations, Mr. 
Brian Wheeler. Mr. Wheeler has been the 
TSA’s liaison to the House Homeland Security 
Appropriations Subcommittee for the past 17 
years, and will be retiring from the federal gov-
ernment after nearly 30 years of dedicated 
service. He will be greatly missed by his TSA 
colleagues, as well as by the members and 
professional staff of the Homeland Security 
Appropriations Subcommittee. 
As chairwoman of this subcommittee, and 
as a member of the subcommittee since its 
creation, I am grateful to Mr. Wheeler for his 
diligent and reliable work to relay key financial 
and security matters to our subcommittee. He 
has accurately addressed our requests, and 
consistently met tight timelines. The informa-
tion he has provided to us has been invalu-
able in our subcommittee’s efforts to mitigate 
future threats to our nation’s transportation 
systems, including our work to fund such TSA 
needs as more advanced detection equipment 
and crucial increases in personnel at airport 
checkpoints across the nation. 
Our Homeland Security Appropriations Sub-
committee has greatly benefited from Mr. 
Wheeler’s commitment, dependability, and ex-
perience. He has provided invaluable insights 
into the operations of a complex transportation 
security system managed by a large domestic 
agency sourced with both appropriated funds 
and mandatory fee revenue. He also has a 
keen awareness of the kinds of information 
appropriators need as we make informed judg-
ments and decisions about the TSA. 
Mr. Wheeler’s superb analytical skills, in-
cluding his graphic and chartmaking talents, 
have been essential to our subcommittee’s re-
view of the TSA’s annual budget requests, 
which now exceed $8 billion worth of budget 
authority. He translates several hundred pages 
of budget submissions into concise sum-
maries. He has built detailed spreadsheets 
that have synthesized funding issues into eas-
ily understood programmatic rationales, which 
has put the subcommittee in a position to opti-
mize our use of taxpayer dollars by ensuring 
that only critical requirements are funded. 
Mr. Wheeler has given outstanding service 
to our subcommittee, the House, the TSA, and 
the nation. His professionalism, perception, 
superb analytic focus, and technical skills 
have been invaluable to us. On behalf of all of 
us at the Homeland Security Appropriations 
Subcommittee, I wish him all the best as he 
moves into retirement and the next phase of 
his life’s journey. 
THE RETIREMENT OF U.S. BORDER 
PATROL CHIEF CARLA PROVOST 
HON. ANDY BIGGS 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
honor of U.S. Border Patrol Chief Carla Pro-
vost. After serving our nation for 25 years, she 
is retiring this Friday. 
A native of rural Kansas, Chief Provost first 
joined the U.S. Border Patrol on January 8, 
1995, and was assigned to Douglas, Arizona. 
Despite the significant culture shock, Chief 
Provost remained in southeast Arizona an-
other ten years. In 2006, she was transferred 
to Yuma, where she served for an additional 
five years. As an Arizona resident, I am grate-
ful for the 15 years she spent keeping our bor-
der secure and our communities safe. 
Chief Provost went on to hold several lead-
ership roles throughout her career, serving the 
El Paso and El Centro Sectors, the Office of 
Professional Responsibility, and was ap-
pointed Chief of U.S. Border Patrol in April 
2017. 
Every American should be grateful for the 
men and women who serve in the U.S. Border 
Patrol. Safeguarding our nation’s border can 
be dangerous and grueling work. But I hear 
time and again from border-region residents 
that their work is vital. Chief Provost describes 
her background as ‘‘pride-in-country and serv-
ice-to-country.’’ She is a great example of and 
for the men and women of the U.S. Border 
Patrol. 
I thank Chief Provost for her many years of 
service and leadership of the agency, and I 
wish her well in her retirement.

HONORING WELDON DAVIS 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, January 30, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to honor the life of Arkansan 
Weldon Davis, who passed away on Decem-
ber 17, 2019. 
Weldon, a native of Mount Vernon, Arkan-
sas, graduated from Mount Vernon high 
school in 1944, and attended college at Arkan-
sas State Teachers College in Conway. 
He later attended the University of Arkansas 
Law School, taking classes at night after a full 
day’s work, from which he received his law 
degree in 1964. 
He began his career at Arkansas Farm Bu-
reau Insurance Company in 1954, where he 
helped guide it to its success today. 
The Arkansas Farm Bureau even presents 
an outstanding adjuster award presented in 
his honor at the Farm Bureau’s claims con-
ference. 
During his career with the Farm Bureau he 
continued to maintain his 640-acre cattle farm 
in Mount Vernon. 
According to his family, he will be remem-
bered as a man of character, honesty, direct-
ness, integrity, and fairness. 
Weldon’s life is a testament to the hard 
work embraced by Central Arkansans.
