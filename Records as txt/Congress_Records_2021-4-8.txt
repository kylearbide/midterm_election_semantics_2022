PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Our God, our help in ages past, we 
give You thanks for the life of Rep-
resentative Alcee L. Hastings, friend 
and colleague, judge and leader in serv-
ice to You and to this country, for 
many years. 
For the shelter You provided him, 
that he would, in his lifelong pursuit of 
civil rights, find triumph in the face of 
adversity, hope in the pursuit of equal 
justice, and Your sufficient grace in his 
efforts to advance respect for all hu-
manity, we give You our heartfelt 
thanks. 
Like an ever-rolling stream, time has 
borne this Your son, our brother, away. 
But may we not forget his compas-
sionate, perhaps flamboyant, fighting 
spirit. And in these days and the days 
to come, be our guard in grief in sure 
and certain hope that Alcee Hastings 
now rests from his labors in Your ever-
lasting arms. 
For giving us the gift of such a man 
with whom we have been privileged to 
know, we are grateful to You. 
We pray in the abiding love of Your 
holy name. 
Amen.

IN RECOGNITION OF BRAD 
CRAMER 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to honor the life and memory of Som-
erset County Sheriff Brad Cramer, who 
passed away on April 3, 2021. As a public 
servant, Sheriff Cramer worked tirelessly to 
protect and serve the residents of Somerset 
County. 
Sheriff Cramer spent four decades as a law 
enforcement officer. He served for 30 years 
with the Somerset Borough Police Depart-
ment, including six years as the Borough’s Po-
lice 
Chief. 
He 
went 
on 
to 
serve 
the 
Conemaugh Township Police Department for 
four years and afterwards, he joined the Som-
erset County Sheriffs Department as a deputy 
prior to being elected Sheriff in 2015. 
His presence and leadership will be missed 
by the people he served over his career. I am 
grateful for the service of Sheriff Cramer and 
on behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District I wish his family and friends 
comfort during this difficult time.

HONORING 
COURT 
APPOINTED 
SPECIAL ADVOCATES OF MON-
TEREY COUNTY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the indispensable advocacy of a 
Central Coast organization that gives a voice 
to some of our most vulnerable community 
members. Court Appointed Special Advocates 
(CASA) of Monterey County improves the lives 
of children in the foster care system by pairing 
them with trained volunteers from the commu-
nity who advocate for them and stand by their 
side as stable adults they can count on as 
they go through the chaos of the foster care 
system. 
CASA and its devoted staff and team of vol-
unteers are guided by the needs of children in 
need of someone to stand by them and en-
sure they are not alone as they face instability, 
fear, and unfamiliar surroundings. Since 1994, 
the organization has continued to be the only 
local nonprofit of its kind that recruits, trains, 
and supports community volunteers to serve 
as court appointed advocates for abused and 
neglected foster children throughout Monterey 
County. CASA of Monterey County exists so 
that abused and neglected children in protec-
tive care have the chance to become success-
ful adults. 
Monterey County is home to over 400 chil-
dren and youth in foster care. But thanks to 
the devoted advocates and the CASA team, 
these children have a voice as they navigate 
a tumultuous system. CASA provides these 
children the compassion, clarity, and care they 
so desperately need. And it is because of 
CASA that these children and youth have the 
tools they need to go on to successful 
adulthoods. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize this treasured community organization 
that has protected and advocated for count-
less foster children and youth. I thank all of 
those who have given their time and re-
sources to help these children feel safe and 
succeed. I extend my gratitude to CASA 
Monterey’s Board of Directors, Board Chair 
Jennifer Rosenthal, Executive Director Beth 
Wilbur, and its devoted network of advocates.

FRIEDA MARTINEZ 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Frieda Mar-
tinez for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Frieda Martinez is a student at Jefferson Jr./ 
Sr. H.S. and received this award because her 
determination and hard work have allowed her 
to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Frieda Mar-
tinez is exemplary of the type of achievement 
that can be attained with hard work and perse-
verance. It is essential students at all levels 
strive to make the most of their education and 
develop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Frieda Martinez for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt she will exhibit the same dedi-
cation and character in all of her future ac-
complishments.

IN RECOGNITION OF ELVIS 
‘‘SONNY’’ GIBSON 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I proudly 
rise today to recognize and celebrate a pas-
sionate historian, dedicated public servant, 
and deeply valued member of the Kansas City 
community, Mr. Elvis ‘‘Sonny’’ Gibson. Though 
Mr. Gibson retired from a career with the fed-
eral government in 1989, his work to make our 
world a more equitable and just place has 
never stopped. To this day, Sonny continues 
to give back to his community, contribute to 
the Black cultural history of Kansas City, and 
bend the American historical record as a 
whole towards truth and justice. Because of 
Mr. Gibson’s outstanding work and tireless 
commitment, voices once silenced have been 
heard, people once forgotten have been re-
membered, and stories once lost have been 
told. 
After moving to Kansas City with his family 
in 1947, Sonny attended R. T. Coles High 
School, one of only two high schools for Black 
students in Kansas City at the time. He then 
went on to work as Branch Chief of Fair Hous-
ing within the United States Department of 
Housing of Urban Development. In that role, 
Sonny proved himself to be adept at navi-
gating the bureaucracy to find solutions for 
those who needed it most. After a career that 
lasted over twenty-nine years, Sonny retired, 
but his work was far from over. 
Writing his first book in 1988, Sonny quickly 
began a second career dedicated to telling the 
stories of the previously unrecognized and ac-
knowledging the work of Black Kansas Citians 
throughout history. It was, and continues to 
be, a labor of love for Sonny—one that has 
propelled him to produce six books and spend 
innumerable hours researching and collecting 
reliable historical accounts. The articles and 
announcements Sonny discovered and shared 
with the world had often been left out of tradi-
tional historical sources. Not only was Sonny 
resolved to bringing them to light, he also 
went about the monumental task of arranging 
them in chronological order and having them 
reproduced in the exact way he encountered 
them. His attention to detail and high 
historiographical standards are a reflection of 
the importance of Sonny’s work and his pas-
sion for doing it justice. Front of mind for 
Sonny has always been the impact these his-
torical artifacts will have on his readers. These 
small glimpses of history help us understand 
who we are as a nation as much as, if not 
more than, any broad volume. For example, in 
his most recent book, 1865—A Kansas City 
Negro History, Sonny writes about a place that 
is especially near and dear to my heart: Kan-
sas City’s 18th and Vine district. Through his 
writing, he is able to take readers back in time 
to highlight the entertainers, politicians, and 
business leaders who built the historic area. 
Sonny has an exceptional talent and ability to 
help his readers view history through the eyes 
of those who lived it—people not so different 
than the readers themselves. 
As I think about Sonny’s wisdom and pas-
sion, one specific instance comes to mind. 
Sonny was telling an audience about being 
posed the question ‘‘Why are you always won-
dering about what Black people did way back 
when?’’ Sonny said, ‘‘To understand the strug-
gle, to understand that there are people in this 
country and in this city, who have come 
through an ocean of blood and tears, to get 
where we are today.’’ Fueled by his unwaver-
ing mission to understand the struggles of 
those who have come before him, Sonny has 
not only deepened his own understanding of 
our city’s rich Black history. He has also given 
the gift of that knowledge to his community, to 
his country, and to future generations. 
In addition to his work as an author, Sonny 
also dedicates a great deal of time to giving

back to his community. He has served on nu-
merous boards and societies, including the 
National Board of Directors for the National 
Black United Fund. He has held the position of 
Resident Scholar for the Black Archives of Mid 
America, Inc., and he has worked as the His-
torian in Resident for the Bruce R. Watkins 
Cultural Center. Sonny sets a true example of 
the qualities we should look for in all public 
servants: dedication, perseverance, and a 
deep, generous love for his community. 
Sonny’s unwavering devotion and tireless 
commitment has made a profound impact on 
the Kansas City community, so I am truly privi-
leged to be able to recognize Sonny’s efforts 
today. Madam Speaker, please join me and 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District in cele-
brating Mr. Elvis ‘‘Sonny’’ Gibson. Our history 
is how we understand ourselves, and every 
day, Sonny helps us understand ourselves a 
bit better. Let us all seek to emulate his exam-
ple by dedicating ourselves to service, dis-
mantling injustice in all its forms, and affirming 
that the American story is incomplete so long 
as so many American stories are left off its 
pages. Let us continue to add new pages, so 
that we may be able to make history by writing 
it down.

IN RECOGNITION OF DR. JEFFREY 
BONNER’S 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
THE ST. LOUIS ZOO 
HON. ANN WAGNER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and honor the incredible 
work and service of Dr. Jeffrey Bonner. On 
March 24, 2021, Dr. Bonner announced that 
he planned to retire as the President and CEO 
of the St. Louis Zoo after 19 years of steadfast 
leadership. 
As any St. Louisan will tell you, the Zoo is 
one of our city’s most treasured attractions. 
Home to over 12,000 animals, 500 different 
species, and free admission for all, the St. 
Louis Zoo brings in families from throughout 
the region to witness the amazing beauty of 
wildlife from all over the world. Over the 
course of Dr. Bonner’s tenure, 56 million peo-
ple have had the privilege of visiting the St. 
Louis Zoo and seeing its world-class exhibits. 
Since joining the Zoo in 2002, Dr. Bonner 
coordinated and oversaw multiple campaigns 
to modernize the century-old campus, create 
scholarships and educational programs, and 
pioneer innovative animal conservation initia-
tives. Dr. Bonner’s dedication to the Zoo, the 
animals, and our city played a pivotal role in 
making our Zoo one of the best in the nation 
and a local landmark. 
I want to thank Dr. Bonner for his hard work 
and devotion, and I wish him all the best in 
the next chapter of his life.

ISABELLA RIVERO 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER

Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise

Rivero for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Isabella Rivero is a student at Oberon Mid-
dle School and received this award because 
her determination and hard work have allowed 
her to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Isabella 
Rivero is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all

cation and develop a work ethic which will

cation and character in all of her future ac-

HONORING THE LIFE AND LEGACY 
OF 
FIRST 
LADY 
ROSANNE 
SANTOS ADA 
HON. MICHAEL F.Q. SAN NICOLAS 
OF GUAM 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. SAN NICOLAS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the life and legacy of Rosanne 
Santos Ada. Rosanne was a former first lady 
of Guam and dedicated public servant. The 
people of Guam will fondly remember her as 
a leader whose decades of contributions to 
our underserved communities and whole-
hearted compassion strengthened our island 
community. 
When Rosanne’s husband, Joseph Ada, 
was elected to office as the Governor of 
Guam in 1987, she rose to proudly serve our 
people as its first lady for eight years. In addi-
tion to being a dedicated wife, mother, and 
grandmother, she is widely known as a pas-
sionate advocate for members of our commu-
nity in most need. As a first lady, she advo-
cated for greater support and services for indi-
viduals with disabilities, and her contributions 
to this community further expanded through 
her work as a director at the Department of In-
tegrated Services for Individuals with Disabil-
ities and Executive Director of the Guam De-
velopmental Disabilities Council. Taking on 
these roles of leadership in our community, 
Rosanne further assisted in developing cul-
turally competent programs to promote self- 
determination, independence, and productivity 
for individuals with disabilities. Further, she 
worked for and with individuals with disabilities 
and their families in advocating for systems 
change, public policy, and best practices 
which accounted for the full inclusion and inte-
gration of individuals with disabilities in all fac-
ets of community life. 
Her lifelong mission of selfless service and 
advocacy for the voiceless also poured out 
into other parts of her career as well. Along-
side her colleagues at Guma’ Mami, a com-
munity-based nonprofit organization, Rosanne 
continued her work of inclusion and integration 
while facilitating supportive housing and suc-
cessful case management for adults with dis-
abilities. This profound commitment to others

HON. DARREN SOTO 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, Francisco H. 
De Jesus was born on March 9, 1924 in 
Pen˜uelas, Puerto Rico. In 1950 he was de-
ployed to the Korean War aboard the USNS

ily in San Juan. Francisco was an entre-
preneur. He pursued numerous business ven-
tures before establishing what became a very 
well-known men’s store called Heryck’s Men’s 
Store in Caparra Terrace. In 1976, Francisco 
sold his beloved store and moved his family to 
Orlando, Florida. For 20 years, Francisco 
worked for the Orange County School Board 
as a community liaison in the Immigration De-
partment, playing a key role in registering mi-
grant families and their children to enable at-
tendance at local schools during the year. 
Francisco is a beloved husband, father of 7 
children, a grand-father of 14 and a Great-

IN RECOGNITION OF COOKIES FOR 
CAREGIVERS 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate the Cookies for 
Caregivers on winning the Special Merit 
Award from the Huntingdon County Chamber 
of Commerce. The award is given to an orga-
nization 
that 
demonstrates 
outstanding 
achievement in the community. 
Cookies for Caregivers is a national pro-
gram that was established by Huntingdon resi-
dents in April 2020. The groups founders, 
Scott McKenzie and Jeremy Uhrich, began 
baking cookies for frontline workers during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. What started a local 
community service project has transformed 
into a national movement. With more than 100 
bakers joining the group, Cookies for Care-
givers has made more than 10,000 cookies to 
share with essential workers. 
It is my privilege to recognize Scott and Jer-
emy for their leadership and ingenuity through 
the development of Cookies for Caregivers. 
This is a remarkable service to our community 
and beyond, and I wish them continued suc-
cess in their efforts.

HONORNG LIEUTENANT COLONEL 
ANTHONY HEISLER 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to extend my sincerest gratitude to U.S. Army 
Officer Lieutenant Colonel (LTC) Anthony 
Heisler of U.S. Special Operations Command 
Legislative Affairs office (SOLA). He is truly a 
great American and has been a tremendous 
help to Congress in developing increased 
transparency and understanding into what 
Special Operations Forces brings to the fight 
regarding the National Defense Strategy. 
LTC Heisler earned his commission through 
Georgetown University Army ROTC as a Field 
Artillery Officer in 2004 and was assigned 4th 
Infantry Division (Mechanized) from 2005 to 
2007 before he volunteered to attend Special 
Forces Assessment and Selection. 
After completing the Special Forces Quali-
fication Course in 2009, LTC Heisler was as-
signed to 1st Battalion, 10th Special Forces 
Group (Airborne) in Germany, where he 
served as a Special Forces detachment com-
mander, headquarters and support company 
commander, and the Aide-de-Camp to the 
Commanding General of Special Operations 
Command-Europe. He was later assigned to 
10th Special Forces Group (Airborne), Fort 
Carson, Colorado, where served as a Special 
Forces company commander, battalion execu-
tive officer, and Group operations officer. He 
has been serving at SOLA since May 2018. 
LTC Heisler’s operational deployments in-
clude Operation Iraqi Freedom (2005 to 2006), 
Operation Enduring Freedom (2009, 2010), 
Operation Juniper Shield (Niger, 2015), and 
Operation Atlantic Resolve (Germany, 2017). 
LTC Heisler has been awarded the Bronze 
Star Medal with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters, the Pur-
ple Heart, Defense Meritorious Service Medal, 
and others. 
U.S. 
Special 
Operations 
Command 
(SOCOM) develops and employs fully capable 
Special Operations Forces to conduct global 
special operations and activities as part of the 
joint force to support persistent, networked 
and distributed combatant command oper-
ations and campaigns against state and non- 
state actors to protect and advance U.S. poli-
cies and objectives. SOCOM trains, organizes 
and equips U.S. Special Operations Forces 
and provide those forces to the geographic 
combatant commanders on the Global Cam-
paign Plan for Countering Violent Extremist 
Organizations, Countering Weapons of Mass 
Destruction and Web-Based Military Informa-
tion Support Operations. 
While in the job at SOLA, LTC Heisler guid-
ed a Congressional Delegation to West Africa. 
His personal knowledge and experiences were 
priceless in making the visits to Niger, Nigeria 
and Mali a tremendous success in August 
2019. We are very grateful for him escorting 
us around the continent. 
He departs the SOLA office this spring after 
three years working with Congress and takes 
command of 3rd Battalion, 10th SFG. We wish 
Anthony and his family safe travels as they 
move to Colorado Springs, CO. There is a 
high likelihood that Congress will see LTC 
Heisler again as he progresses through the 
Army ranks. Madam Speaker, I ask my col-
leagues to join me in extending our gratitude 
to LTC Heisler for his service to our country 
and the House of Representatives.

CESSFUL 
BUSINESS 
VENTURES 
IN THE TOWN OF MALONE 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Darren Gough and Michael 
Roesler of MCM Development Malone, LLC 
on the successful revitalization of The River 
Building, a historic landmark in the Town of 
Malone, and on the opening of their new res-
taurant, Hearth of Malone. 
Darren and Michael knew at first sight that 
there was something special about The River 
Building, so they sought to turn their dream of 
renewing a portion of downtown Malone into a 
reality. Through perseverance and teamwork, 
they renovated this historic building into a 
multi-use space where family, friends, visitors, 
and tourists alike can gather and feel wel-
come. In that vein, the new restaurant within 
the building is aptly named Hearth of Malone 
as they hope to foster a sense of community 
in this new space. 
The North Country would be nothing without 
our local businesses and entrepreneurs like 
Darren and Michael, who undertake enormous 
efforts to create positive change in our com-
munities. Darren, and Michael, along with their 
partner and executive chef, Jesse Badger, and 
general manager, Randy Tomblin, have truly 
exemplified the ‘‘neighbor helping neighbor’’ 
mindset. Throughout the renovation process, 
they contracted locally, and at the Hearth of 
Malone, many ingredients will be sourced di-
rectly from local farmers. They are fully invest-
ing in our community and are committed to 
serving their customers to the best of their 
ability. 
On behalf of New York’s 21st District, I 
would like to thank MCM Development Ma-
lone, LLC, and their entire team for their dedi-
cation to revitalizing a historic property in our 
community and congratulate them on their 
hard-earned achievements thus far.

INTRODUCTION OF THE DISTRICT 
OF COLUMBIA JUROR PAY PAR-
ITY ACT 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today I in-
troduce the District of Columbia Juror Pay 
Parity Act, which would require that D.C. Su-
perior Court jurors receive the same pay as 
federal jurors. The importance of jurors to our 
system of law is driven home by the current 
trial of Derek Chauvin for the death of George 
Floyd. 
Currently, Superior Court jurors are paid 
$40 per day, and, under the Home Rule Act, 
only the D.C. courts and Congress have the 
authority to increase Superior Court juror pay. 
In the fiscal year 2018 omnibus appropriations 
bill, Congress increased federal juror pay to 
$50 per day, the first increase to federal juror 
pay in 28 years. My bill would give Superior 
Court jurors the same pay. 
Under the National Capital Revitalization 
and Self-Government Improvement Act of 
1997 (Pub. L. 105–33), Congress took respon-
sibility for paying for the D.C. courts and other 
state-like functions provided by D.C. The D.C. 
courts, however, have always been under the 
control of Congress, even when they were 
funded by the District. The Home Rule Act 
prohibits the District government from enacting 
any law relating to Title 11 of the D.C. Code. 
Title 11 provides that the Board of Judges of 
the Superior Court sets juror pay, but that the 
pay may not exceed the pay of federal jurors. 
Therefore, this bill, or action by the D.C. 
courts, is necessary to increase Superior 
Court juror pay. 
I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to congratulate the leaders and staff 
of Conemaugh Meyersdale Medical Center for 
receiving the Joint Commission’s Gold Seal of 
Approval. 
The Gold Seal of Approval recognizes the 
hard work that the team at Conemaugh 
Meyersdale Medical Center does every day to 
serve the people of southern Somerset Coun-
ty. The center provides outstanding treatment 
and care to all patients. The Joint Commis-
sion’s Gold Seal is a testament to their out-
standing work, and I am grateful for their serv-
ice to our community. 
To receive the accreditation, Conemaugh 
Meyersdale Medical Center was evaluated 
during a spontaneous, unannounced review 
late last year. Surveyors from the Joint Com-
mission evaluated the staff’s performance in a 
variety of areas. 
On behalf of Pennsylvania’s 13th Congres-
sional District, I congratulate the entire team at 
Conemaugh Meyersdale Medical Center on 
this well-deserved award. I am grateful for 
their work and commitment to providing out-
standing medical care to the people of Penn-

IN 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
THE 
LIFE 
AND MEMORY OF EUNICE MAE 
WILKENS 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today with a heavy heart on behalf of Mis-
souri’s Fifth Congressional District to honor 
and celebrate the life of Eunice Mae ‘‘Judy’’ 
‘‘Granny’’ Wilkens. A lifetime resident of 
Concordia, Missouri, Eunice spent her 88 
years on this Earth enriching her community 
through individual acts of service that filled her 
life with purpose and her neighbors’ lives with 
blessings. 
Eunice understood that one need not relo-
cate to a big city to have a big impact, and her 
remarkable story attests to this simple tenet of 
service. In a town tucked between Sweet 
Springs and Odessa in the western half of 
Missouri, Eunice was determined to improve 
her small corner of the world through entrepre-
neurship, activism, and volunteerism. As the 
owner of Ye Olde Lantern Motel, she worked 
tirelessly to demonstrate the beauty and grace 
of her beloved town to those traveling through. 
When her community was in need, she hap-
pily volunteered to pitch in for the greater 
good. For twenty-four years, she was a mem-
ber of the Concordia Fire Protection District, 
serving thousands of people across a 100– 
square-mile area who called her for help when 
they needed it most. After years of seeing vet-
erans return home from distant battlefields still 
bearing the scars of war, she volunteered to 
be a member of the local V.F.W. Ladies Auxil-
iary at Post 5649. Along with other dedicated 
volunteers, Eunice helped foster a community 
where veterans could share their wartime sto-
ries, bond over common experiences, honor 
the sacrifices of those who never made it 
home, and contribute to their community’s fu-
ture through initiatives like their annual Voice 
of Democracy scholarship competition. 
Eunice’s involvement with the V.F.W. and 
the Concordia Fire Protection District spurred 
in her a strong sense of political purpose and 
propelled her to become active in the Lafay-
ette County Democrat Club. When knocking 
on doors or making calls for local candidates, 
she undoubtedly carried with her the stories of 
those who had lost just about everything to an 
unexpected medical emergency, and those 
who had defended our country abroad but 
struggled to find peace back home. Perhaps 
closest to my heart was Eunice’s work at St. 
Paul’s Lutheran Church, where she volun-
teered as a braille worker. She knew that sal-
vation and jubilation is not reserved only for 
the able-bodied. Through her generosity, Eu-
nice helped those without sight envision the 
glory of God through her eyes. 
Today, as I reflect on Eunice’s beautiful 
story—a story complete with family, faith, and 
love—a story in which she and her late hus-
band, Hubie, traveled all over the world and to 
all fifty states—I cannot help but believe that 
Eunice, in her daily voyages of selflessness 
and service, carried with her the lessons from 
the Sermon on the Mount. In a Sermon de-
scribed by some as the most important one 
ever given, Jesus preaches to a mass of fol-
lowers while standing on a hilltop overlooking 
the Sea of Galilee. Jesus describes service to 
God not as strict adherence to rigid principles 
or unforgiving laws, but rather, as a lifetime 
dedicated to loving and serving God’s children 
on Earth. At one point, Jesus exclaims that 
those who are compassionate, forgiving, mer-
ciful, sincere, and humble will serve as ‘‘the 
light that gives light to the world.’’ He then im-
plores his disciples not to hide their light be-
hind closed doors, but to let their light ‘‘shine 
brightly before others, so that the commend-
able things you do will shine as light upon 
them.’’ With every act of kindness to a strang-
er, service to a neighbor, and compassion for 
a fellow Concordian, Eunice shined brightly. 
Just like the oil lamps that lit up the pristine 
hilltop towns of Galilee when Jesus gave his 
Sermon all those centuries ago, the light of 
Eunice’s life illuminated Concordia and will 
continue to shine upon the people who call the 
town home. There is no doubt that Concordia 
was blessed to have Eunice, and our commu-
nity will be forever grateful for her presence in 
our lives. 
Today, my thoughts, and the thoughts of 
Missouri’s Fifth Congressional District, are with 
Eunice’s daughter, Nancy; her grandsons, 
Kyle and Erik; her five great-grandchildren; 
and her several nieces and nephews, as they 
come together to celebrate Eunice’s lifetime of 
illuminating service. We can take comfort 
today in our belief that she joins Hubie in per-
haps the one place they never visited in their 
travels together. Madame Speaker, please join 
me in honoring Eunice’s unique life and the 
everlasting impression that it has left on the 
town she so greatly impacted. Please also join 
me in offering heartfelt condolences to her 
family and dear friends. Madam Speaker, as 
we go forth into an uncertain future, let us 
learn from Eunice’s example and serve as 
shining lights in our own communities so that 
we may deliver to those whom we serve the 
way Eunice served those whom she loved.

ADVOCATES

SAN 
BENITO COUNTY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the indispensable advocacy of a 
Central Coast organization that gives a voice 
to some of our most vulnerable community 
members. Court Appointed Special Advocates 
(CASA) of San Benito County improves the 
lives of children in the foster care system by 
pairing them with trained volunteers from the 
community who advocate for them and stand 
by their side as stable adults they can count 
on as they go through the chaos of the foster 
care system. 
CASA and its devoted staff and team of vol-
unteers are guided by the needs of children in 
need of someone to stand by them and en-
sure they are not alone as they face instability, 
fear, and unfamiliar surroundings. Since 1994, 
the organization has continued to be the only 
local nonprofit of its kind that recruits, trains, 
and supports community volunteers to serve 
as court appointed advocates for abused and 
neglected foster children throughout San Be-
nito County. CASA of San Benito County ex-
ists so that abused and neglected children in 
protective care have the chance to become 
successful adults. 
Thanks to the devoted advocates and the 
San Benito CASA team, these children have a 
voice as they navigate a tumultuous system. 
CASA provides these children the compas-
sion, clarity, and care they so desperately 
need. And it is because of CASA that these 
children and youth have the tools they need to 
go on to successful adulthoods. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize this treasured community organization 
that has protected and advocated for count-
less foster children and youth. I thank all of 
those who have given their time and re-
sources to help these children feel safe and 
succeed. I extend my gratitude to CASA San

IN RECOGNITION OF THE FORD 
MOTOR 
COMPANY’S 
DONATION 
OF 120 MILLION MASKS DURING 
THE COVID–19 PANDEMIC 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the contributions of the 
Ford Motor Company during the COVID–19 
Pandemic. On Wednesday, April 7th they ful-
filled their commitment to providing personal 
protective equipment to those in need, sur-
passing their original goal of donating 100 mil-
lion face masks. To date, they’ve donated 120 
million face masks for children and adults dis-
tributing them to nonprofits, schools, state and 
local officials, first responders, and Ford deal-
ers all across the nation. 
Face masks that are manufactured in Michi-
gan by Ford-UAW employees are protecting 
Americans in all 50 states. UAW workers have 
been coming to work in the middle of the pan-
demic to ensure that their communities are 
safe. From manufacturing ventilators for hos-
pitals and providing masks to the areas hard-
est hit by the pandemic, to donating Michigan- 
made masks for the 59th inaugural cere-
monies, Ford’s dedication to safety has pro-
tected millions during this crisis. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in thanking the Ford Motor Company and 
their workers for their leadership in combating 
the coronavirus pandemic. Workers at the Wil-
low Run Assembly Plant heard the call of their 
nation during World War II, and now 80 years 
after being the arsenal of democracy, Ford’s 
factories became the arsenal of health. Michi-
gan workers met the moment when normal 
production shifted to manufacturing the per-
sonal protective equipment and ventilators that 
this 
country 
sorely 
needed. 
Ford’s 
#FinishStrong and Project Apollo initiatives 
have saved lives and I congratulate them on 
reaching this milestone.

Huntingdon Borough. The multi-span stone 
bridge was once used by the first steam-pow-
ered train in Huntingdon. The club’s preserva-
tion efforts included removing overgrown 
vegetation, adding a sign to memorialize the 
significance of the bridge, and beautifying the 
historic architecture. 
The Huntingdon Rotary Club’s dedication to 
preserving the community and its history is an 
important part of our community. I congratu-
late the club members on receiving this well- 
earned award and wish them continued suc-
cess in their efforts.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
AND 
HONORING 
NIKKI 
FRIED 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
although Women’s History Month recently con-
cluded, it is never too late to honor Florida 
women who have made outstanding contribu-
tions to their community and to our country. 
Today I rise to honor Nikki Fried. 
Nikki was born and raised in Miami. She is 
a proud Gator, having received her bachelor’s 
degree, her master’s degree, and her law de-
gree from the University of Florida. While at-
tending UF, Nikki served as student body 
president and was a member of Florida Blue 
Key, the prestigious student leadership honor 
society. 
Upon her graduation from law school, Nikki 
worked in the Alachua County Public Defend-
er’s Office, in private practice in South Florida, 
and then as a government consultant. In 2017, 
Nikki began her own government consulting 
firm to advocate for children and medical pa-
tients before the Florida Legislature. 
In 2018, Nikki broke an important barrier. 
She was elected as the state’s Commissioner 
of Agriculture and Consumer Services, a cabi-
net position, becoming the first Jewish woman 
ever elected to statewide office in Florida. As

Commissioner, Nikki has been an effective ad-
vocate for conserving Florida’s lands, fighting 
hunger, combating climate change, supporting 
farmers, and reducing gun violence. 
Commissioner Fried is an exceptional public 
servant devoted to the cause of improving 
quality of life for all for Floridians. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring

Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Ella Phillips 
for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge Service 
Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Ella Phillips is a student at Three Creeks K– 
8 and received this award because her deter-
mination and hard work have allowed her to

The dedication demonstrated by Ella Phillips 
is exemplary of the type of achievement that

ance. It is essential students at all levels strive

velop a work ethic which will guide them for 
the rest of their lives.

SANDEE SYTSMA, PLANT CITY 
CITIZEN OF THE YEAR 
HON. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
Sandee Sytsma for being named the 2020 
Plant City, Florida Citizen of the Year. 
In its 62nd year, this award was created to 
highlight civic-minded Plant City-area residents 
who have dedicated their lives toward giving 
back to their community. They must be per-
sons of noble character, a humble spirit and 
steeped in the virtues of Plant City. 
Sandee has supported a myriad of causes 
through the committees she serves on, includ-
ing Relay for Life, Diamonds & Denim, Vet-
erans Memorial Park and the Plant City Mural. 
Sandee was recognized as the Good Egg by 
the Greater Plant City Chamber of Commerce. 
She 
serves 
with 
her 
congregation 
at 
GracePoint Church, was the first woman to 
serve as chair of the Florida Strawberry Fes-
tival and has represented the festival and the 
community in countless talk shows and publi-
cations over the years. 
Our communities are only as strong as the 
people who serve them. Plant City is a won-
derful place to live, work and raise a family, 
thanks, in part, to outstanding citizens like 
Sandee Sytsma. 
On behalf of the 15th District of Florida, 
congratulations to Sandee Sytsma for earning 
this distinguished honor. Plant City thanks 
Sandee for her tireless dedication and service 
to our community.

HONORING THE LIFE OF JOYCE 
RYDER VANDEVERE 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor the life of teacher, activist, and social 
justice advocate, Joyce Ryder Vandevere, 
who recently passed away at the age of 94 on 
February 17, 2021. 
Joyce’s parents met while students at UC 
Berkley and instilled Joyce with the value of 
education and a firm sense that she could ac-
complish anything she set her mind to. Joyce 
graduated from Pomona College in 1948 and 
earned a master’s degree in Psychology and 
Child Development from Stanford in 1950. 
Upon receiving her degrees, Joyce became di-
rector of a preschool in San Francisco where 
she would be introduced to prominent progres-
sive leaders, including labor leader Harry 
Bridges. It was during this period that Joyce 
developed a commitment to social justice and 
equality. 
In 
1956, 
with 
her 
husband 
Judson 
Vandevere, Joyce moved to Monterey, where 
she would reside for the rest of her life and 
dedicate her time to social service and political 
activism on the central coast of California. 
During the Vietnam War, Joyce worked to pro-
vide soldiers at Ft. Ord with counseling and 
other services that would otherwise be un-
available to them. Additionally, she was an ad-
vocate for prison reform and worked with 
Friends Outside to support the families of in-
carcerated individuals. 
Joyce returned to her teaching career in the 
1960s as a volunteer teacher with Head Start 
in Seaside, California. In 1971, she co-found-
ed the Learning Community, an open class-
room, alternative program at Seaside’s Del 
Rey Woods School, and would continue to 
teach until 1988. 
Further, Joyce was a co-founder of the local 
chapter of the Women’s International League 
for Peace and Freedom, the Peace Coalition 
of Monterey County, and the Monterey Peace 
and Justice Center. She remained active in all 
these organizations until her death. Joyce 
even learned to code and designed relational 
databases while in her 70s to produce a 
weekly Peace calendar. 
Joyce’s life is celebrated by her children, 
Keith and Gwyn, her three great-grand-
children, and her numerous nieces and neph-
ews. Joyce’s meaningful legacy of service and 
advocacy will always endure with the people 
living on the central coast of California.

Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to congratulate the Huntingdon

Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Eduardo 
Toledano for receiving the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Eduardo Toledano is a student at Drake 
Middle School and received this award be-
cause his determination and hard work have 
allowed him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Eduardo 
Toledano is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Eduardo Toledano for winning the Arvada 
Wheat Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth 
award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING THE RETIREMENT 
OF JOHN DURHAM 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to commend the distinguished career in 
public service of former U.S. Attorney John 
Durham. As is typical of presidential transi-
tions, John Durham officially retired from his 
role as the leader of the U.S. Attorney’s Office 
for the District of Connecticut on February 28, 
2021. A resident of eastern Connecticut, he in-
vested 40 years of his life to this form of pub-
lic service, and as an attorney in practice for 
27 years prior to coming to Congress and as 
the brother of a former Assistant U.S. Attorney 
who worked with John, I can attest to the ster-
ling reputation and record he amassed on his 
long and eventful journey. 
Born in Boston, John graduated from 
Colgate University with a Bachelor of Arts de-
gree in 1972. From there, he began his legal 
career securing his juris doctor degree from 
the University of Connecticut School of Law in 
1975. Armed with his degree, John had many 
options in the legal profession. Rather than 
pursuing more lucrative areas of practice, he 
began his career instead in the criminal courts 
as a Deputy Assistant State’s Attorney with 
the Office of the Chief State’s Attorney in 
1978. He moved up a year later to New 
Haven State’s Attorney’s Office, where he 
worked until 1982. During these formative 
years, John marked major notches on his belt 
with the successful prosecution of those such 
as the Curcio brothers, notorious Bridgeport 
mobsters whose conviction made it all the way 
to the United States Supreme Court. Ulti-
mately, it was during this formative time period 
that John carved out his unique specialty in 
the field of law: combatting organized crime. 
As successful as he was in the Connecticut 
state courts, the federal courts offered a much 
greater capacity to exercise his skills. It was 
no surprise then that Mr. Durham joined the 
federal government at the U.S. Attorney’s Of-
fice for the District of Connecticut. Also lo-
cated in New Haven, John stayed on with the 
District Office for another 35 years until he be-
came the U.S. Attorney for that very office in 
2018. Throughout these years, John expanded 
his prosecutorial belt even further to continue 
his crusade against organized crime, later ex-
panding his specializations to addressing pub-
lic corruption. Needless to say, as indicated by 
his constant presence in New Haven, John’s 
leadership in the field has always been par-
tially attributed to his fierce and inspiring loy-
alty. 
There are, of course, other attributes that 
have led to his defining success in the New 
England area as a federal prosecutor. Dur-
ham’s major contribution to combating the 
drug violence epidemic was to create a struc-
ture that federalized investigations. In doing 
so, he formed a more effective, broad, and re-
sourceful law enforcement approach by en-
couraging multi-agency task forces to coordi-
nate on unique investigative efforts. His archi-
tectural ability found him leading assignments 
that involved a bigger picture than maintaining 
the law within Connecticut, such as when he 
brought down New England’s most powerful 
criminal outfit, the Patiarca family, in the late 
1980’s. This major win for public safety in the 
region is also due to his federalized efforts, as 
the syndicate collapsed at John’s hand when 
inner circle members were persuaded to co-
operate with federal resources such as the 
FBI’s witness protection program. 
John’s highly ethical commitment to clean-
ing up corruption earned him a bipartisan and 
distinguished reputation as a protector of the 
people. A stalwart of government oversight, he 
led efforts to remove and charge government 
officials—even those at the highest levels 
such as Connecticut’s ex-Governor John Row-
land. With his impeccable reputation for deft 
handling of the tools of federal law enforce-
ment, he was also assigned by Justice De-
partment officials of numerous administrations 
to investigate and prosecute those working for 
organized crime from within law enforcement, 
including those formerly connected to the infa-
mous gangster James ‘‘Whitey’’ Bulger. As a 
signal to his integrity and public trust, John’s 
career over the past couple decades has 
steered toward the investigation of scandalous 
claims of abuse from the highest levels of the 
federal government, including but not limited 
to the CIA’s post-911 interrogation tactics. 
With his reputation as one of the most con-
sequential federal prosecutors in mind, the 
former President nominated John Durham in 
November of 2017 to become the U.S. Attor-
ney for the District of Connecticut which re-
ceived universal, bipartisan support in both 
Connecticut and Washington. 
Madam Speaker, Mr. Durham has led and 
won against some of the most complicated 
criminal and political scandals in Connecticut 
and elsewhere. For nearly 40 years, he has 
built an accomplished record that has kept the 
people safe from violence and government 
abuse. He often attributed his inspiration to 
the dedicated public service of the colleagues 
that surrounded him, which was reflected by 
the fact that nearly 300 judges, prosecutors 
and members of law enforcement came to ac-
knowledge his career on his final day in office. 
While we now find ourselves wondering what 
the future will hold with his departure, we can 
at least find comfort in the competent and ef-
fective U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of 
Connecticut that he leaves behind. To that 
end, I ask my colleagues in the House join me 
in honoring and thanking U.S. Attorney John 
Durham for upholding the highest standards of 
his profession in a lifetime of public service of 
service.

COURT 
APPOINTED 
SPECIAL ADVOCATES OF SANTA 
CRUZ COUNTY 
HON. JIMMY PANETTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the indispensable advocacy of a 
Central Coast organization that gives a voice 
to some of our most vulnerable community 
members. Court Appointed Special Advocates 
(CASA) of Santa Cruz County improves the 
lives of children in the foster care system by 
pairing them with trained volunteers from the 
community who advocate for them and stand 
by their side as stable adults they can count 
on as they go through the chaos of the foster 
care system. 
CASA and its devoted staff and team of vol-
unteers are guided by the needs of children in 
need of someone to stand by them and en-
sure they are not alone as they face instability, 
fear, and unfamiliar surroundings. Since 1994, 
the organization has continued to be the only 
local nonprofit of its kind that recruits, trains, 
and supports community volunteers to serve 
as court appointed advocates for abused and 
neglected foster children throughout Santa 
Cruz County. CASA of Santa Cruz County ex-
ists so that abused and neglected children in 
protective care have the chance to become 
successful adults. 
Thanks to the devoted advocates and the 
Santa Cruz CASA team, these children have 
a voice as they navigate a tumultuous system. 
CASA provides these children the compas-
sion, clarity, and care they so desperately 
need. And it is because of CASA that these 
children and youth have the tools they need to 
go on to successful adulthoods. 
Madam Speaker, it is my pleasure to recog-
nize this treasured community organization 
that has protected and advocated for count-
less foster children and youth. I thank all of 
those who have given their time and re-
sources to help these children feel safe and 
succeed. I extend my gratitude to CASA Santa 
Cruz’s Board of Directors, Board President 
Andrea

Executive 
Director 
Lynne

RECOGNIZING THE PENNSYLVANIA 
COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSI-
CIANS 
HON. MICHAEL F. DOYLE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. MICHAEL F. DOYLE of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate 
the Pennsylvania College of Emergency Phy-
sicians on its 50th Anniversary. The Pennsyl-
vania College of Emergency Physicians was 
founded in 1971 by six physicians and held its 
first meeting on November 27, 1971 in Harris-
burg, Pennsylvania. Today, they represent 
over 1,900 emergency medicine physicians 
who treat over 6,000,000 patients each year in 
emergency departments across the Common-
wealth. 
These dedicated Pennsylvania emergency 
physicians provide medical care 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year to all 
Pennsylvanians with any condition regardless 
of socioeconomic status, and serve as the 
healthcare safety net in the Commonwealth. 
These emergency physicians are also critical 
to the ability of the Commonwealth to respond 
to disasters and mass casualty events, are 
vital frontline healthcare workers in the fight 
against the COVID–19 pandemic, and the 
medical care they provide saves the lives of 
many patients in the Commonwealth every 
day. 
Pennsylvania emergency physicians are 
leaders in defining, evaluating, and improving 
quality emergency care, focusing on individual 
patients while advocating for and advancing 
the public health and the wellness of society 
as a whole. The Pennsylvania College of 
Emergency Physicians is committed to pro-
viding ongoing continuing education for emer-
gency physicians in the Commonwealth and 
serves as the primary voice of Pennsylvania 
emergency physicians and patients seeking 
emergency care in the health care system and 
halls of government. 
In short, Pennsylvania emergency physi-
cians have contributed greatly to the health 
and wellbeing of the entire population of the 
Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. 
For these reasons, I stand here today to 
congratulate the Pennsylvania College of 
Emergency Physicians on its 50th Anniver-
sary; recognize the accomplishments and con-
tributions Pennsylvania emergency physicians 
have made to advance health care in the 
Commonwealth; express my support for Penn-
sylvania emergency physicians in their ongo-
ing fight against the COVID–19 pandemic; and 
reaffirm the value of emergency medicine and 
the vital role that Pennsylvania emergency 
physicians serve in ensuring the health and 
well-being of all Pennsylvanians.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE LIFE 
AND LEGACY OF ALVIN SYKES 
HON. EMANUEL CLEAVER 
OF MISSOURI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. CLEAVER. Madam Speaker, it is with 
sorrow and a heavy heart that I rise today to 
commemorate the life and legacy of the late 
Alvin Sykes, who passed away on March 19th. 
Alvin was a monumental man—one who dedi-
cated his life to seeking truth and justice for 
those who were long denied it because of the 
systemic injustice that was so prevalent in the 
civil rights era. While he was only on this 
Earth for sixty-four years, the reverberations of 
his actions will extend for much longer. 
Born in 1956, Alvin came of age during the 
height of the civil rights movement. Following 
the eighth grade, Alvin left formal education 
and continued his learning in the libraries of 
Kansas City, Missouri. As a young man, he 
was deeply moved by the assassination of Dr. 
Martin Luther King, Jr., solidifying his lifelong 
commitment to carrying on the banner of civil 
rights. While it was the death of Dr. King that 
galvanized Alvin, it was a personal tragedy 
that entrenched his methodology. In 1980, 
Steve Harvey, a young KC jazz musician and 
close friend of Alvin, was murdered. Despite 
the original trial ending in an acquittal, Alvin 
dug deep through legal resources and col-
lected enough information to reopen the case. 
Establishing the Steve Harvey Justice Cam-
paign, Sykes collected thousands of signa-
tures in an effort to demonstrate the public’s 
desire to seek justice. In the end, his hard 
work paid off. Because of his efforts, the man 
responsible for Mr. Harvey’s murder was 
found guilty of his crime and sentenced to life 
in prison. With his first case behind him, Alvin 
turned his eyes to issues of nationwide injus-
tice. Renaming the Steve Harvey Justice 
Campaign, the Justice Campaign of America, 
Alvin and his fellow activists sought to right 
the wrongs of injustice anywhere that they 
could find it.

April 8, 2021 
While his work on Mr. Harvey’s case was 
notable in its own right, Alvin found national 
recognition for the integral role he played in 
the development and passage of the Emmett 
Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Identi-
fying the legal barriers stymying the prosecu-
tion of civil rights era cold cases, he pushed 
for the creation of a bill that would enable the 
federal government to reopen and pursue ra-
cially motivated, pre-1969 cold cases. As a di-
rect result of the bill’s passage, over one hun-
dred cases were reopened and investigated 
under the U.S. Department of Justice’s Cold 
Case Initiative. Consequent to his actions and 
passion for justice, over a hundred families 
across the country have been able to gain 
some sense of closure where none had been 
before. 
Alvin’s work to rectify the shortcomings of 
the civil rights era justice system did not stop 
with the passage of the Emmett Till Unsolved 
Civil Rights Crime Act. In 2010, Alvin was able 
to reopen the murder case of Leon Jordan, a 
former Kansas City policeman and cofounder 
of the city’s local, Black political organization 
known as Freedom, Inc. Equipped with his in-
timate understanding of the legal system and 
with newfound evidence, he sought to bring 
forth justice for Mr. Jordan. While his inves-
tigation and efforts into the case did not lead 
to a prosecution, Alvin did not consider this a 
failed effort. As he once stated, ‘‘My brand is 
that I go for the truth and, if possible, justice. 
That formula hasn’t failed me yet. Find the 
truth. After that, justice may be possible.’’ 
Alvin’s lifelong commitment to finding the 
truth and seeking justice and closure for those 
whom it had been denied is one that deserves 
to be memorialized in the annals of history. 
Without his guiding hand, historic legislation 
within the state of Missouri and in the halls of 
Congress may not have been brought into re-
ality. Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating and honoring the life and accomplish-
ments of Alvin Sykes, a man that was truly 
larger than life. Let his legacy live on in the 
closure and peace that his work may still bring 
to the families that have yet to find answers.

CELEBRATING WOMEN’S HISTORY 
MONTH 
AND 
HONORING 
DANIELLA LEVINE CAVA 
HON. STEPHANIE N. MURPHY 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mrs. MURPHY of Florida. Madam Speaker, 
although Women’s History Month recently con-
cluded, it is never too late to honor Florida 
women who have made outstanding contribu-
tions to their community and to our country. 
Today I rise to honor Daniella Levine Cava. 
Daniella, who is originally from New York 
City, moved to Miami in 1980 after graduating 
from Yale University and Columbia Law 
School. She spent a decade working for the 
Legal Services of Greater Miami and for the 
Guardian Ad Litem program, which gives a 
voice to young children in our legal system. In 
1996, Daniella founded the innovative Catalyst 
Miami. Since its inception, Catalyst has cre-
ated paths to economic prosperity for approxi-
mately 5,000 people each year. 
In 2014, Daniella was elected to the Miami- 
Dade County Commission, and she was re- 
elected in 2018. In November 2020, Daniella 
made history when she was elected as Miami- 
Dade County’s first-ever woman Mayor. As 
Mayor, she has been a fierce advocate for her 
three 
million 
constituents—advocating 
for 
young children, increased affordable housing, 
opportunities for small businesses, and im-
proved public transportation. 
As an attorney, as an activist, and now as 
an elected official, Daniella Levine Cava has 
never stopped fighting for South Florida fami-
lies. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring 
and celebrating Mayor Daniella Levine Cava.

CELEBRATING THE JONES FAMILY 
HON. RALPH NORMAN 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. NORMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize two of Rock Hill’s greatest former 
athletes and loving parents, Tim and Jackie 
Jones. It has been my privilege to learn of the 
successes of Tim and Jackie and their tal-
ented daughters, Jada and Layla. 
Tim was a standout Bearcat at Rock Hill 
High who played in the 1989 Shrine Bowl be-
fore dominating in football as a collegiate level 
linebacker. He was a two-time All-ACC starter 
who led the Clemson Tigers in tackles for 
three consecutive seasons. Only one player 
has accomplished that feat since. Nicknamed 
‘‘The Hitman’’ for his punishing tackles in high 
school, Tim went on to accumulate 338 tack-
les in college. Among a plethora of distin-
guished titles and awards, he was a sopho-
more All-American in 1992, an Honorable 
Mention All-American in both 1993 and 1994, 
and the team’s Most Valuable Player in 1994. 
Tim pursued a banking career in Charlotte be-
fore returning to Rock Hill High as an assistant 
football coach. He will always be remembered 
as Clemson’s best No. 56. 
Before running cross country at the Univer-
sity of South Carolina, Jackie set records in 
track and field at Rock Hill High. She shared 
pointers with her daughter, Jada, who broke 
those records as a freshman in 2019. The 
elite athlete has also persevered through ex-
treme hardship. Jackie was previously diag-
nosed with both stomach cancer and breast 
cancer. Despite undergoing a bilateral mastec-
tomy, her breast cancer returned shortly after. 
She remains optimistic and continues to fight 
this ongoing battle with persistence and grace. 
Currently, Jackie serves her community as 
principal of Mt. Holly Elementary School. She 
is a faithful and inspirational leader to all. 
Tim and Jackie are blessed to have raised 
two high-achieving Bearcats of their own. An 
unmatched high school basketball star, ‘‘eter-
nal optimist’’ Jada has the speed, build, and 
athleticism to carry her teammates through 
any season. As a varsity guard, she led her 
basketball team through the playoffs and plans 
to rejoin the soccer and track teams this 
spring, as well. Her little sister Layla, who 
plays on the Junior Varsity team, seeks advice 
from Jada and hopes to soon follow in her 
footsteps. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in cele-
brating the Jones family’s athletic accomplish-
ments. They are living legends, and I am 
proud to acknowledge their substantial con-
tributions to our community.

FERNANDO BEGAY 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, April 8, 2021 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Fernando 
Begay for receiving the Arvada Wheat Ridge 
Service Ambassadors for Youth award. 
Fernando Begay is a student at Jefferson 
Jr./Sr. H.S. and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Fernando 
Begay is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to Fer-
nando Begay for winning the Arvada Wheat 
Ridge Service Ambassador for Youth award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.
