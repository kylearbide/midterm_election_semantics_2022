Vol. 167 
WASHINGTON, FRIDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 2021 
No. 195 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 8 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Ms. DEGETTE). 
f 
DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
November 5, 2021. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable DIANA 
DEGETTE to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
What a bind we find ourselves in, O 
God. On the one hand, we know, and 
You have told us, that each human 
being is made in Your image. Every 
person we gaze upon, work with, de-
bate, and love, on each one You have 
imprinted Your image so that we would 
be blessed to see Your face in theirs. 
And yet, not one of us has been faith-
ful to this image-bearing reflection of 
Your perfect love. Nor have we ac-
knowledged the presence of You in the 
other. 
With the same tongue that we use to 
praise You, we use to curse. In the 
same prayers we offer time and again 
for Your wisdom, we persist in igno-
rance of Your command to love one an-
other. 
We confess that there are more times 
than we care to admit that we harbor 
ill will, envy, and bitterness. Our own 
ambitions beat strong in our hearts 
and drown out the pleas of those in 
need of our goodwill, compassion, and 
forgiveness. 
Redeem us. 
As You did at creation, bring order 
into our chaos and bestow on us once 
again the desire to praise You with our 
lips and serve Your people with our 
whole selves, that we would be worthy 
of the divine image we bear. 
In Your merciful name we pray. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 11(a) of House Resolu-
tion 188, the Journal of the last day’s 
proceedings is approved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman from New York (Mr. NAD-
LER) come forward and lead the House 
in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. NADLER led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
VACCINE MANDATES ARE UN- 
AMERICAN 
(Mr. KELLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. KELLER. Madam Speaker, I 
have talked with job creators and the 
hardworking Pennsylvanians who go to 
work every day. Do you know what 
they are saying? They are saying: I 
don’t need government telling me what 
is best for me and my family. 
But just yesterday, President Biden 
released details for his vaccine man-
date for businesses with more than 100 
employees. 
President 
Biden’s 
go-it-alone 
ap-
proach of running America has left him 
tone-deaf. 
Vaccine mandates are un-American, 
period. 
That is why I partnered with Senator 
BRAUN to introduce a resolution under 
the Congressional Review Act to strike 
down this unconstitutional overreach 
of government. Every member of the 
Education and Labor Committee is on 
board with this bill, and we have grow-
ing interest throughout the Republican 
Conference. 
Right before the holidays, America is 
facing a supply chain crisis, rising 
costs on everything from gas to gro-
ceries, and President Biden isn’t listen-
ing to the people for whom he works. 
Our resolution sends a message to 
President Biden loudly and clearly: 
Americans are fed up with mandates 
and government control. 
f 
AMERICANS ARE REJECTING 
SOCIALISM 
(Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I have a message to send to 
all Americans: Socialism is not win-
ning in America. 
We saw earlier this week Democrats 
lost their progressive, far-left momen-
tum among voters across the country. 
Turns out, the Democrats’ policies of 
defunding the police, removing parents 
from their children’s education, raising 
taxes, and expanding government con-
trol are not a winning message for 
America. 
Republicans are committed to open-
ing America back up for business, se-
curing the southern border, creating 
strong energy independence, addressing 
our national debt, and supporting Main 
Street America through lower taxes 
and less regulation. 
This week, despite the writing on the 
wall, Democrats and President Biden 
are pushing their massive, far-left, so-
cialist reconciliation package that will

November 5, 2021 
cost trillions of dollars to taxpayers for 
years to come. 
With over 2,000 pages of text, Speaker 
PELOSI is conducting closed-door nego-
tiations, bypassing the Congressional 
Budget Office report and ramming 
through this legislation without full 
transparency on the true cost and eco-
nomic impact this would have for the 
American people. 
Americans are rejecting socialism at 
every corner. The bottom line: It is a 
loser. 
In God We Trust. 
f 
BLACK DAY FOR AMERICA 
(Mr. GROTHMAN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, 
this is a potentially very black day for 
America. I want to emphasize some 
things that I think are very significant 
that haven’t received enough atten-
tion. 
We are paying for the government to 
care for 3- and 4-year-olds. Tradition-
ally, in America, the raising of the 
children is the responsibility of the 
parents. I know there are people— 
Marxists—who believe that the raising 
of children is the responsibility of the 
state, but this is a sad day for America. 
The Federal Government—against the 
Constitution, by the way—is going to 
weigh in and say taking care of 3-year- 
olds is the responsibility of govern-
ment—not mom, not dad, not grandma 
and grandpa, the government. 
The next thing is a big push toward 
encouraging illegal immigration. In 
this bill, we are paying for free college 
for people who are here illegally, some-
thing that the American middle class 
doesn’t 
get. 
American 
middle-class 
kids, they are going 30 or 40 grand in 
debt, and we are giving free college to 
people who come here illegally. What a 
shame. 
I guess it matches the free healthcare 
while the average American is sitting 
there looking at a $10,000 deductible. 
f 
HONORING JAMES P. BURIAK 
(Mr. GRIFFITH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I 
offer these remarks in honor of Naval 
Aircrewman 1st Class James ‘‘Jimmy’’ 
P. Buriak, who died on August 31, 2021, 
at the age of 31. 
Mr. Buriak, of Salem, Virginia, was 
one of five sailors who died when their 
helicopter from the USS Abraham Lin-
coln crashed into the sea off the coast 
of southern California. 
Mr. Buriak was born on May 9, 1990, 
to Jim and Carol Buriak in Salem. 
Jimmy graduated from Salem High 
School and Roanoke College. Jimmy 
joined the Navy in 2017. 
During the last year of his life, 
Jimmy was honored for rescuing a man 
who was caught in a rip current off 
Guam’s Gun Beach. 
Mr. Buriak’s thoughtful character far 
exceeded the parameters of his job. He 
always went out of his way to help 
those in need and to go the extra mile 
that others weren’t willing to do. 
Jimmy was a great young man. 
His wife, Megan, is starting the 
AWS1 James Buriak Foundation to 
continue honoring his legacy. The 
foundation will seek to improve finan-
cial shortcomings for Gold Star fami-
lies with small children. 
Mr. Buriak is survived by his wife, 
Megan; his very young son, Caulder; as 
well as his parents, Jim and Carol 
Buriak; his sister, Laura; and his 
brother-in-law, Erik Zickefoose. 
Madam Speaker, I offer Jimmy’s en-
tire family my condolences on their 
loss. He was a great young man. 
Madam Speaker, as an aside, Jimmy 
used to play water polo with me in the 
summertime. 
f 
TODAY IS A BRIGHT DAY 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I stand to refute with a spirit of joy 
this morning one of my friends on the 
other side who called this day a ‘‘black 
day.’’ 
I wonder what that interpretation 
means, but I see a sense of great future 
for America. And I wonder how many 
of the 3- and 4-year-olds in the future 
will wind up in the Office of the Presi-
dent of the United States because we in 
America and we as Democrats gave 
them an early head start. 
If any of my colleagues have ever vis-
ited childcare and pre-K and seen the 
brightness of our children, they know 
that what Democrats are doing today 
creates not a blackness but a bright-
ness. 
Today is going to be a bright day in 
America as Democrats govern and lead 
and make a difference in this Nation 
and in this world. I am glad to stand 
with the American people and families 
as we create for them a very bright 
day. 
f 
CRISIS AT THE BORDER 
(Mr. BIGGS asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, while 
the border is porous and 200,000 people 
are being apprehended every month, 
another 100,000 are illegally entering 
who we don’t know where they are 
coming from. They are not caught; 
they are gotaways this administration 
is going to offer $450,000. 
What is interesting about that is the 
President himself said he didn’t know 
about it. He has had to walk that back, 
hasn’t he? 
So there will be $450,000 offered to a 
certain segment of illegal migrants. 
Not only that, we will continue to see 
opioids, fentanyl. We will see addi-
tional drugs and human trafficking 
continue across our border until we se-
cure our border. I am hoping this ad-
ministration will make that a priority 
rather than ignoring it and encour-
aging people to come across our border. 
f 
MOTION TO ADJOURN 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, I move 
that the House do now adjourn. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion to adjourn 
offered by the gentleman from Arizona 
(Mr. BIGGS). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the noes appeared to have it. 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, on that 
I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
The vote was taken by electronic de-
vice, and there were—yeas 207, nays

PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRIES 
Mr. BURGESS (during the vote). Mr. 
Speaker, I ask to be recognized for a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
KAHELE). The gentleman will state his 
parliamentary inquiry. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, my un-
derstanding is the longest recorded 
vote in the House in the past has been 
2 hours and 50 minutes. This motion 
has been open a similar amount of 
time. 
May I ask how long you intend to 
keep the House suspended with this 
vote? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will not serve as a historian, but 
the minimum for this vote is 15 min-
utes. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
further parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. BURGESS. With one vacancy in 
the House of Representatives, 217 votes 
represents a clear majority on your 
side. The clear majority means that 
the vote will not change regardless of 
who else shows up. It is time to close 
this vote. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not stated a parliamentary 
inquiry. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I have a 
parliamentary inquiry. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman will state his parliamentary in-
quiry. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, is it 
possible to defeat this motion cur-
rently with 217 votes up on the board? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
threshold for rejecting a motion to ad-
journ is a majority vote with a quorum 
being present. 
Mr. BURGESS. And with the full 
number of the House being 434, this is 
a majority vote. It is anatomically im-
possible to defeat this with more than 
217 votes. They don’t exist. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not stated a parliamentary 
inquiry. 
Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just submit, anyone who is up watching 
C–SPAN at this hour wonders what in 
the heck the House is doing right now. 
All the problems we have to solve, and 
this is the best we can muster. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman has not been recognized for de-
bate.

Messrs.

KEATING, CUELLAR, SCHIFF, Ms.

PROVIDING 
FOR 
CONSIDERATION 
OF H.R. 5376, BUILD BACK BET-
TER ACT; AND FOR OTHER PUR-
POSES 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, by 
direction of the Committee on Rules, I 
call up House Resolution 774 and ask 
for its immediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 774 
Resolved, That upon adoption of this reso-
lution it shall be in order to consider in the 
House the bill (H.R. 5376) to provide for rec-
onciliation pursuant to title II of S. Con. 
Res. 14. All points of order against consider-
ation of the bill are waived. An amendment 
in the nature of a substitute consisting of 
the text of Rules Committee Print 117–18, 
modified by the amendment printed in the 
report of the Committee on Rules accom-
panying this resolution, shall be considered 
as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be 
considered as read. All points of order 
against provisions in the bill, as amended, 
are waived. The previous question shall be 
considered as ordered on the bill, as amend-
ed, and on any further amendment thereto, 
to final passage without intervening motion 
except: (1) two hours of debate equally di-
vided among and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee 
on the Budget or their respective designees 
and the chair and ranking minority member 
of the Committee on Ways and Means or 
their respective designees; and (2) one mo-
tion to recommit. 
SEC. 2. House Resolution 188, agreed to 
March 8, 2021 (as most recently amended by 
House Resolution 716, agreed to October 12, 
2021), is amended by striking ‘‘November 18, 
2021’’ each place it appears and inserting (in 
each instance) ‘‘December 3, 2021’’. 
POINT OF ORDER 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I raise a point of order 
against consideration of the resolution 
because 
the 
resolution 
waives 
all 
points of order against consideration of 
H.R. 5376. 
The resolution is therefore in viola-
tion of section 426 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 prohib-
iting 
the 
consideration 
of 
a 
rule 
waiving the application of section 425 
of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
of 1995. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6214 
November 5, 2021 
The gentleman has met the threshold 
burden under the rule and the gen-
tleman from Missouri and a Member 
opposed each will control 10 minutes of 
debate on the question of consider-
ation. Following debate, the Chair will 
put the question of consideration as 
the statutory means of disposing of the 
point of order. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from Missouri. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, we have seen a circus here for 
the last 7 hours. We saw history: The 
longest vote held in this body in mod-
ern history, a motion to adjourn, just 
so some backroom agreement could be 
made. 
This point of order, the whole pur-
pose of it, is to make sure that this 
budget bill that is before us—before 
there is a vote—that we know the true 
cost of this agreement from the Con-
gressional Budget Office. That is what 
the rules are. 
We know that there are more than 
150 different programs being created in 
this legislation, and we know that 
there are a lot of many—numerous dif-
ferent possibilities of unfunded man-
dates that would go to the States, that 
would go to individuals. And before 
there is a vote on this bill, a vote on 
this rule, we need to make sure that 
there is a Congressional Budget Office 
score. We do not need to violate the 
House rules and Federal statute by 
forcing through this piece of legisla-
tion without knowing exactly the cost. 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD a letter that was sent to the 
Speaker of the House from five dif-
ferent Democrats of this body, fol-
lowing our lead, what we just said here, 
that there should not be a vote on this 
bill until the Congressional Budget Of-
fice does a score. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
Washington, DC, November 2, 2021. 
Hon. NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives, 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: As we work to put 
the COVID–19 crisis behind us and build back 
better than ever before, we applaud your 
focus on infrastructure and on measures that 
help children and working families across 
America. 
We continue to ask that you please sched-
ule a floor vote on the Bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Framework as soon as possible, and we 
are pleased by the progress we are making on 
the Build Back Better (BBB) Act. As we 
enter the home stretch of these negotiations, 
we ask that you please provide additional in-
formation so that we may make more in-
formed decisions that better serve our con-
stituents. 
First, we applaud the commitment from 
both you and the President that the BBB Act 
will be fully paid for. In order to ensure the 
final bill is indeed fiscally responsible, we 
must first have the proper CBO/JCT scoring 
information before any floor consideration. 
Therefore, we cannot lend our support to ad-
vancing the BBB Act until we have had a 
chance to review these scores which provide 
the true cost of the legislation. Moreover, 
the U.S. Senate cannot even consider the 
BBB Act under reconciliation rules until it 
has received an official CBO score. 
Secondly, we appreciate your public state-
ments committing to properly pre-confer-
encing the BBB Act with the U.S. Senate. We 
continue to urge you to only bring a bill to 
the floor for which we have a strong level of 
confidence that the provisions in the bill will 
be ruled in order by the Senate Parliamen-
tarian and earn passage in the U.S. Senate. 
Finally, consistent with House rules and 
considering the magnitude and complexity of 
the BBB Act, we ask that the final text of 
the bill be posted at least 72 hours before its 
consideration so that we—and, more impor-
tantly our constituents—have time to review 
the bill before any vote. 
While we understand the needs of the na-
tion are great, we believe our job as legisla-
tors is to provide the due diligence required 
to properly serve our constituents. It is bet-
ter to get this done right than to needlessly 
rush its consideration only for our constitu-
ents to discover the negative impacts of our 
unintended consequences. 
Sincerely, 
ED CASE. 
JOSH GOTTHEIMER. 
KURT SCHRADER. 
JARED GOLDEN. 
STEPHANIE MURPHY. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I hope that the five Members 
that are on this letter to the Speaker 
will follow through with the same com-
mitment that they allowed on Novem-
ber 2, and to make sure that the Amer-
ican people get a valid, transparent 
score so that they know what exactly 
is in this piece of legislation. 
We know it is the largest spending 
bill in the history of the United States. 
We just don’t know exactly how much. 
It is at least $4.5 trillion, but we don’t 
have the Congressional scorecards of 
doing it. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
claim the time in opposition. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts is recog-
nized. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER). 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend, 
Ranking Member SMITH, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it was just 4 short 
years ago that Speaker PELOSI tweeted, 
‘‘Republicans shouldn’t vote without 
an updated CBO score.’’ Those were the 
Speaker’s own words 4 years ago. 
The Speaker even doubled down later 
in that tweet. She accused Republicans 
of attempting to ‘‘jam this bill through 
without an updated CBO score of its 
impacts.’’ Again, that was the Speaker 
4 years ago. 
Apparently, the Speaker has forgot-
ten those words, because later today, 
Democrats plan to ram through this 
Big Government tax-and-spend pro-
posal with no information from the 
nonpartisan CBO about the true cost 
and the true economic impact their 
spending spree will have on the Amer-
ican people. 
So I guess it is fair to say that the 
Speaker subscribes to that age-old 
adage, ‘‘do as I say, not as I do.’’ 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 21⁄2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. HINSON). 
Mrs. HINSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Missouri for 
yielding today. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
strong opposition to this massive tax- 
and-spend plan that was only posted 
late last night. 
This entire process has been a sham. 
It has been full of nothing but par-
tisanship, disrespect for taxpayers and 
late-night and all-day antics. No won-
der my colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle are in disarray. 
Late last night, the 2,100-page bill 
was finally posted. We certainly have 
not had adequate time to fully read or 
digest what is in it, let alone figure out 
how much it is going to cost my con-
stituents. 
Iowans deserve to know how much of 
their hard-earned paychecks are going 
to be wasted on frivolous, misguided 
priorities, like funding for butterflies 
or desert fish when my constituents 
are busy trying to put food on their ta-
bles, provide for their kids, and keep 
their family farms operating. 
But no, we can’t even get the most 
basic information. We don’t have an of-
ficial cost estimate from the non-
partisan Congressional Budget Office. 
Instead, we have nonsense numbers, to-
tally made-up numbers, handed down 
from the White House in the middle of 
the night. That is not how we govern 
responsibly in this body. 
Madam Speaker, I came to Wash-
ington, D.C., to be an advocate for tax-
payers, to make sure that Iowans’ 
voices are heard and to bring a little 
bit of that Iowa commonsense to the 
Capitol. This place clearly needs it. 
Working families in Iowa sit around 
their kitchen tables, they talk about 
what is important to them, they build 
a budget that fits within their means 
and they stick to it. 
I know what that is like. Moms 
across the country know what that is 
like. It is not easy. We have to make 
hard choices. And frankly, it is dis-
respectful and embarrassing that we 
are even having this debate right now. 
How can we spend taxpayers’ money 
without knowing how much we are 
spending? 
In the Speaker’s own words, we 
shouldn’t vote without a CBO score. I 
agree. Americans deserve to know the 
impact legislation will have on their 
lives. The best estimates that we have, 
which don’t even include all of the pro-
visions that Speaker PELOSI stuffed in 
there last night, ring up in the tril-
lions. 
We are spending approximately tril-
lions of dollars on nonsense priorities 
when Iowans are dealing with real 
challenges, and we can’t even give 
them the respect of waiting for a prop-
er cost estimate. This bill bankrupts 
the economy, it benefits the wealthy, 
and it builds bureaucracy. It is a bust. 
Vote ‘‘no.’’

November 5, 2021 
b 1530 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Oklahoma (Mr. COLE). 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, we have 
heard repeatedly from the President of 
the United States that this bill costs 
nothing. That is obviously not true, it 
costs lots of money. 
Last night, my very good friend, the 
Rules Committee chairman, the distin-
guished Member from Massachusetts 
(Mr. MCGOVERN), said it is fully paid 
for. I know he believes that. Unfortu-
nately, he doesn’t know that. 
We don’t have a Congressional Budg-
et Committee score. We have had five 
Members of the other party say they 
would not vote for this bill unless they 
had a CBO score. I hope they hold true 
to that. 
Madam Speaker, we should simply 
not proceed until we have a CBO score. 
We will have our differences of opinion, 
fair enough. But the American people 
and all of us in this Chamber ought to 
know what this bill costs before any of 
us are asked to cast a vote. 
Madam Speaker, I would urge the 
support of my friend’s point of order. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. 
SMITH 
of 
Missouri. 
Madam 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Madam Speaker, it has been quite a 
groundhog day when you watch what 
has been going on with this legislation 
over and over. It started out with a 
2,400 page bill; last Thursday a new 
1,700 page bill was dropped; this week 
on Wednesday an additional 2,135 page 
bill was dropped, and none of the bills 
have been completely scored. 
What we do know, after 11 p.m. last 
night they made additional changes to 
the 2,135 page bill that was dropped on 
Wednesday. And you know what their 
priorities were in those changes? It was 
to give millionaires larger tax breaks. 
That was their priority, to give already 
millionaires larger tax breaks. 
They try to tell you that this legisla-
tion was about the kids and the babies 
and it is all about the children. That is 
a bunch of hogwash, Madam Speaker. 
This bill is all about giving tax breaks 
to the millionaires. The largest portion 
in this bill, over $300 billion, goes to-
ward their tax breaks for millionaires. 
They don’t want a score because they 
don’t want the American people to see 
the giveaways that they are giving to 
the most wealthy at the expense of the 
working class. That is unacceptable. 
We need to make sure that the only 
thing that is bipartisan in this legisla-
tion is bipartisan opposition. 
There is bipartisan support to make 
sure that this bill is scored before a 
vote, to make sure that the American 
people know what is in this bill. Don’t 
you dare try to sneak this through. 
Don’t you dare. 
The people of the United States de-
serve the huge tax break you are giving 
your millionaires in this legislation. 
Madam Speaker, I hope the five Demo-
crats that sent this letter to the 
Speaker join with us and makes sure 
that we know how much the price tag 
is in this legislation, in this proposal, 
so we can tell everyday working-class 
Americans how much their cost of 
goods are going to be going up because 
of the reckless, irresponsible spending 
of the people on that side of the aisle. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will remind all Members to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, let me first begin by 
suggesting, and I say this seriously, 
that the gentleman from Missouri take 
a chill pill. We ought to be able to dis-
cuss serious matters without getting 
hysterical and yelling and screaming 
all the time. The American people ex-
pect us to debate serious issues seri-
ously. 
First of all, let me just say, this is 
another tactic to try to derail an effort 
to help reduce premiums for more than 
9 million Americans, lower prescrip-
tion drug costs, ensure that seniors 
never pay more than $2,000 a year for 
their drugs under Medicare part D. 
This is an effort by my Republican 
friends to derail a bill that would lower 
insulin prices; it offers access to uni-
versal and free preschool for 3- and 4- 
year-olds, which would save American 
families an average of $8,600 per year 
per child. That is what they are fight-
ing against here. 
This effort by my Republican friends 
is an attempt to derail a bill that 
would support the construction of af-
fordable homes, boost our housing sup-
ply, deliver much-needed rental and 
downpayment assistance to our con-
stituents; it would enhance and expand 
home energy and efficiency tax credits; 
it would bolster our domestic supply 
chains; creates thousands of new good- 
paying jobs right here in the United 
States of America; it would make his-
toric investments in coastal restora-
tion, forest management, and soil con-
servation; provides resources to reduce 
emissions and support our farmers; it 
creates a diverse new workforce for the 
establishment of the Civilian Climate 
Corps, which will conserve our land and 
improve resilience. 
Now, my friends on the other side of 
the aisle were talking about the cost. 
They are worried about the cost. Boy, 
it is nice that they finally worry about 
the cost of things. They rammed 
through a tax cut bill for the wealthy, 
for billionaires, for big corporations, 
and they never paid for it. It added $2 
trillion to our debt. Where were they 
then? 
But here is the good news, Madam 
Speaker. This bill is fully paid for. The 
Joint Committee on Taxation and the 
White House has provided much of the 
detail. I appreciate the fact that my 
friends would rather shout than debate, 
but the American people expect a de-
bate, expect a conversation. 
When people, by the way, come to the 
Rules Committee, they get as much 
time as they want to be able to speak, 
and we welcome the diversity of opin-
ion. 
Madam Speaker, we also know that 
the Build Back Better bill will not be-
come law without a CBO score. It will 
not go through the Senate without a 
CBO score. That will be coming, and 
my friends know that. 
So the bottom line is, this is a red 
herring. They are not concerned about 
a CBO score. They are not concerned 
about cost, they never have been in the 
past on any of their legislative prior-
ities that benefit the well-off and the 
well-connected. The idea that somehow 
they are fighting for the middle class 
or those struggling to get in the middle 
class; give me a break. People know 
the record of my Republican friends, 
they know the priorities of the Repub-
lican Congress, they know the prior-
ities of the previous occupant of the 
White House. 
Nobody buys that this is about pro-
tecting the middle class because most 
of my friends on the other side of the 
aisle never gave a damn about the mid-
dle class or those struggling to get into 
the middle class. 
So this is an effort to try to basically 
derail or stall or obstruct all the things 
that I mentioned. Madam Speaker, 
there is no merit to what my friends 
are complaining about here today, but 
they will complain, and they have a 
right to do so. We will grin and bear it. 
At the end of the day we will deliver 
for the American people. 
We have two major pieces of legisla-
tion that we want to get enacted into 
law: one is the Build Back Better ini-
tiative, which I just talked about all 
the priorities in it; the other is the in-
frastructure bill that was bipartisan 
over in the Senate, and maybe we will 
see if it is bipartisan over here, I hope 
so. It is about investing in our roads 
and our bridges and our water and our 
sewer facilities, and giving America ba-
sically a facelift because we have ne-
glected our infrastructure for too long. 
And here is the difference. When they 
were in charge, when the previous oc-
cupant of the White House was in 
charge, we got infrastructure weeks 
and infrastructure months and infra-
structure press releases, but no money, 
no resources to help build one single 
infrastructure project. That is going to 
change with this majority and this 
President. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to reject what my friends are 
peddling here today and vote ‘‘yes’’ on 
the question of consideration. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is, Will the House now con-
sider the resolution? 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it.

The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms.

chusetts is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, for 
the purpose of debate only, I yield the 
customary 30 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. BURGESS), 
pending which I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. During consider-
ation of this resolution, all time yield-
ed is for the purpose of debate only. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent that all Mem-
bers be given 5 legislative days to re-
vise and extend their remarks. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday the Committee on Rules re-
ported a rule, House Resolution 774. 
The rule provides for the consideration 
of H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, 
under a closed rule. The rule provides 2 
hours of debate equally divided among 
and controlled by the chair and rank-
ing minority member of the Committee 
on Budget and the chair and ranking 
minority member of the Committee on 
Ways and Means. The rule self-executes 
a manager’s amendment from Chair-
man YARMUTH and provides one motion 
to recommit. 
Finally, the rule extends recess in-
structions, suspension authority, and 
same day authority through December 
3. 
Madam Speaker, when Franklin Roo-
sevelt stood before the American peo-
ple in Chicago, Illinois, and accepted 
the Democratic nomination for Presi-
dent nearly 90 years ago, he promised 
them a New Deal, one built on equality

H6217 
November 5, 2021 
and fairness. That work is bigger than 
a single President or a single era, and 
it continues to this day. 
All these years later, this Congress is 
working to fulfill that promise. We will 
be considering a bill that will trans-
form the lives of most people in this 
country for the better. 
The Build Back Better Act will help 
Americans access stronger and more 
affordable healthcare, better family 
care, and will set up a stronger re-
sponse to the climate crisis. It will 
lower prescription drug costs, capping 
the cost of insulin at $35. It will estab-
lish paid family and medical leave and 
provide universal and free pre-K. 
Madam Speaker, I have talked to so 
many of my constituents who are sick 
and tired of working hard but falling 
behind. All they want is a country and 
a Congress that looks out for their in-
terest and puts their needs first. That 
is what the policies contained in this 
bill will do. 
These are the kind of priorities that 
make me proud to be a Democrat. They 
are the kind of advancements that the 
American people have been demanding 
for decades. 
The Build Back Better Act finally 
turns the page on four decades of failed 
trickle-down economics. It invests in 
the people who built this country; in 
our workers, the middle class, and ev-
eryone fighting hard to get there. And 
at a time when the wealth gap between 
the richest and the poorest families in 
this country has more than doubled, 
this bill will stem the rising tide of in-
come inequality by asking those at the 
very top to pay what they owe, to pay 
their fair share. It is bold. It is con-
sequential. And it will transform the 
lives of so many Americans. 
By expanding the child tax credit, 
more than 35 million families with 
children will see their taxes go down. 
Older Americans and those with dis-
abilities will also see expanded access 
to home care as part of this bill. People 
working two or three jobs to make 
ends meet—17 million of them—will 
have hope for a better future with ac-
cess to an education that extends be-
yond high school. 
Parents of three- and four-year-old 
kids can breathe a sigh of relief as they 
gain access to universal pre-K, mean-
ing that they can go to work safe in 
the knowledge that their kids are 
learning while they are earning. 
Nine million Americans will save 
money on their premiums through 
changes to the Affordable Care Act, 
and folks in States that have been cut 
out of healthcare—four million of 
them—will finally get healthcare be-
cause this bill closes the Medicaid cov-
erage gap. 
By making the biggest investment 
ever to combat climate change, the 
Build Back Better Act will advance en-
vironmental justice and give more 
communities a fighting chance to re-
spond to this crisis. There are re-
sources here to cut pollution, grow 
small businesses, improve care for our 
veterans. 
This bill accomplishes all of this 
while being fully paid for. It finally de-
mands that the largest corporations 
and the wealthiest Americans pay their 
fair share. And importantly, it keeps 
the President’s promise not to raise 
taxes on those making under $400,000, 
not even one single penny. 
This is a seismic shift after my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
exploded the deficit to give tax cuts to 
the rich and the well-off. 
And let me just say to all those Re-
publicans who have been urging action 
on the COVID-caused supply chain 
issues, you should join us and support 
this bill because there are provisions 
here to bolster our supply chain and 
prepare for the next pandemic and fu-
ture supply chain issues. 
Madam Speaker, I will put the values 
contained in this bill against the prior-
ities of my colleagues on the other side 
any day of the week. 
It is about damn time that the 
wealthy were asked to pay their fair 
share. It is about damn time that 
workers and small businesses get a tax 
break. And it is about damn time that 
we focus on the middle class for a 
change. 
My Republican friends may stand 
here today and complain about the 
process, but the truth is 13 committees 
of jurisdiction have spent more than 
165 hours marking up this legislation. 
They considered more than 850 amend-
ments. And all that was before the 
Committee on Rules did its work. Be-
fore the Committee on Rules met, not 
once, but twice, and talked about this 
bill—even before it was final. 
The committees have done their 
work. Members in this Congress, in 
this House and all across the Capitol 
have debated this bill over and over 
and over again. 
The American people are demanding 
action. Now is the time. Time for us to 
make real the promises of the New 
Deal. Time for us to put our govern-
ment back on the side of working peo-
ple in this country. And time for us to 
deliver the agenda that the American 
people voted for last November. 
Madam Speaker, I thank Members on 
both sides of the aisle, and especially 
staff. I know that this has been a long 
day and a long week. We have our dif-
ferences, but I thank all of my col-
leagues for their patience. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman, the chairman of 
the House Committee on Rules for 
yielding me the customary 30 minutes, 
and I yield myself such time as I may 
consume. 
Madam Speaker, you have to ask, 
What in the world have people been 
thinking today? 
Congress—which doesn’t enjoy a high 
approval rating in general—the Demo-
cratic leadership and Speaker have 
shown such disrespect and disdain for 
every Member on both sides of the aisle 
that it will be very, very difficult to re-
pair that damage. 
Now, exactly 12 hours late, we are 
considering a rule that provides for the 
consideration of a so-called Build Back 
Better Act. The final text of the bill, of 
course, does not have an opinion from 
the Congressional Budget Office, and 
the final text of the bill has been dif-
ficult to obtain, but now, there for all 
to see but none to read, it certainly 
does not provide for the American peo-
ple. 
So let’s just briefly recap the series 
of events: in an emergency August ses-
sion, the House deemed passed on a 
procedural vote the budget resolution— 
not a real vote, a procedural vote—set-
ting the top line reconciliation levels. 
In September, the 13 committees of ju-
risdiction did markup their portions. 
The Budget Committee held a markup 
on a Saturday night on a zoom call 
without a score from the Congressional 
Budget Office. 
b 2030 
Speaker PELOSI, Democratic Sen-
ators, and the White House then en-
gaged in a new round of negotiations, 
guaranteeing that after over a month 
of work—very partisan work—this bill 
would become wholly new legislation 
before heading to the House floor. 
With only a few hours’ notice, the 
Rules Committee met last week on 
rushed reconciliation text that did not 
include language for every title. In the 
middle of this hearing, Speaker PELOSI 
decided to abruptly end testimony as 
her hastily crafted agreement com-
pletely collapsed. 
We were then called back on Wednes-
day of this week to restart consider-
ation on even newer text with very lit-
tle time to review. I wish I could tell 
you everything that is in this bill, but 
we really haven’t had the time. I guess 
we will have to follow the lead of 
Speaker PELOSI at another time when 
she said we will have to pass the bill to 
find out what is in it. 
This is the most expensive piece of 
legislation in the history of the United 
States House of Representatives. The 
spending in this bill is five times 
America’s annual defense budget, seven 
times the cost of the interstate high-
way system, five times annual Medi-
care spending, and more than the gross 
domestic products of Canada and Mex-
ico combined. If enacted, new spending 
will be more than the total combined 
annual wages of the American people. 
Think about that for a minute. If you 
tax the American people every single 
dollar they earn, you still would not be 
paying for this bill, but Democrats 
seem unconcerned with this discrep-
ancy. 
This bill includes a Methane Emis-
sions Reduction Program. Methane is a 
pollutant if released into the atmos-
phere, but it is also a valuable com-
modity in the form of natural gas; it 
heats homes, it runs our plants that 
generate electricity. Domestic energy 
protection has skyrocketed over the 
past few decades, and yet at the same 
time methane emissions in the United

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6218 
November 5, 2021 
States of America have fallen 15 per-
cent over that timeframe. 
Instead of building on this progress 
and welcoming the innovation, this 
provision would provide millions of 
taxpayer dollars to create a new nat-
ural gas tax, increasing the cost of res-
idential natural gas by up to 34 per-
cent. 
During the Rules Committee meet-
ing, I submitted an amendment that 
would strike this methane language 
and instead provide incentives to build 
the infrastructure necessary to get this 
valuable product to consumers. 
Stranded gas in the Permian basin 
could be shipped to major population 
centers in the eastern part of the the 
country, or shipped overseas, but we 
couldn’t find the necessary money to 
do that in a $5 trillion bill. 
This package also provided billions of 
dollars to roll out electric vehicles and 
electric vehicle infrastructure—basi-
cally toys for rich people. There are 
also subsidies for electric vehicles 
manufactured using union labor. Iron-
ically, these pro-labor provisions could 
put thousands of nonunion auto work-
ers out of a job. The subsidies would 
also breach international trade agree-
ments. I submitted an amendment to 
remove this language, but it too was 
not considered. 
This bill contemplates an expansive 
drug pricing provision. This proposal 
claims to protect research and develop-
ment, yet the Secretary still has the 
ability to set the price of any new drug 
at any level the Secretary wishes, even 
zero. There is no judicial review of ar-
bitrary decisions. 
Additionally, disagreeing with the 
prices set by the Secretary will result 
in a 95 percent excise tax. Under this 
bill, the government will be the decid-
ing factor determining which drugs and 
which cures can come to market and be 
available to the American people. 
I am specifically concerned about 
funding for some of the dispropor-
tionate share hospitals being cut from 
100 percent of what is expected to be 
provided to 87 percent; and it will pro-
hibit nonexpansion States from imple-
menting uncompensated care pools, 
who provide healthcare to the unin-
sured and underinsured. 
When the American Rescue Plan was 
signed into law, it included a vast ex-
pansion of the Affordable Care Act pre-
mium subsidies. While these subsidies 
were intended to be temporary, this 
bill will provide a cliff that people will 
fall off in 2025, and premiums having 
risen during that time, people will be 
left in the lurch. It is bad that this has 
very shortsighted, very punitive policy 
on some of the poorest people in the 
country, and it hurts the very people 
we should be trying to help. 
Additionally, the American Rescue 
Plan eliminated the eligible income 
cap for the Affordable Care Act pre-
mium subsidies, permitting those with 
very high incomes to qualify. Experts 
estimate this will cost $34 billion over 
the next 2 years and incentivize busi-
nesses to stop offering group health in-
surance. So 190 million Americans 
could be in jeopardy of losing their 
healthcare coverage. Remember that 
one, If you like your insurance, you 
can keep it? 
I am also concerned that during last 
night’s Rules Committee meeting not 
one chairman or ranking member could 
tell me when I asked, All of these new 
gifts that are being given by this bill, 
in addition to the ACA credit, the paid 
time off, do any of these new benefits 
require American citizenship? Absolute 
silence from every chairman and rank-
ing member because the answer is no. 
These benefits will be available to peo-
ple who cannot provide proof or show 
that they are citizens of this country. 
The magnitude of the changes con-
templated in this reconciliation pack-
age require the full input of Congress, 
not just a few privileged in a secret 
room somewhere; like we have seen all 
afternoon. 
Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to 
the rule, and I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
MORELLE), a member of the Rules Com-
mittee. 
Mr. MORELLE. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the distinguished chair 
of the Rules Committee and my col-
league for his incredible work and lead-
ership. 
Madam Speaker, today we continue 
to make good on our promise to deliver 
real results for working families by 
moving another step forward with the 
Build Back Better Act. 
The pandemic put significant strains 
on 
my 
constituents, 
including 
in-
creased 
costs 
of 
childcare 
and 
healthcare, amid continued disruptions 
in our labor markets. Today it is clear, 
we have their back. 
This landmark legislation will help 
163,000 people alone in the State of New 
York gain much-needed health cov-
erage, and save Monroe County fami-
lies hundreds of dollars on healthcare 
costs annually. 
By lowering the cost of prescription 
drugs, like insulin, we can ensure no 
one ever has to choose between putting 
food on the table or paying for life-
saving medication. 
We are making long overdue invest-
ments in infrastructure that will result 
in good-paying jobs, upgrades to roads 
and bridges, broadband internet, and 
public transit, all without raising taxes 
on working men and women. 
We are expanding access to high 
quality and affordable childcare for 
over 1 million children, giving parents 
the resources they need to get back to 
work while supporting their families. 
These are real, impactful policies 
that will have a profound effect on my 
district and support middle class Amer-
icans at a time they need it the most. 
Madam Speaker, I look forward to 
voting in favor of the rule, and I re-
main focused on delivering real results 
to insure our families can thrive and 
succeed. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oklahoma (Mr. COLE), the ranking 
member of the House Committee on 
Rules. 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, I want to 
thank my friend for yielding, but most 
of all, I want to thank him for waiting 
here hour after hour after hour, as our 
friends who couldn’t get their show in 
order, broke arms, broke knees, did 
whatever they had to do to bring this 
to the floor. Thank you for being here 
and making sure that things were done 
appropriately in a procedural way. 
Madam Speaker, we have purportedly 
a $3 billion package in two different 
parts in front of us today. We are not 
going to talk a lot about the first part 
of the package, the so-called infra-
structure package, but I want to talk 
about it because it didn’t come through 
the Rules Committee, it didn’t need to, 
and it is not going to be subject to 
much debate here, but we ought to talk 
about it. 
Now, of the two bills that we are pur-
portedly going to deal with, it is the 
better of the two. It is abominable. It 
is unpaid for. The CBO has told us it is 
$400 billion—$398 billion to be precise. 
b 2040 
The Senate process that produced it 
did not go through the committee of 
jurisdiction. Worst of all, it is the most 
egregious surrender of House preroga-
tives I have seen in my time here. It 
has not come through any committee. 
We have not had anything to do with 
it. We are going to simply accept what 
a few Senators negotiated and went 
through and call it a victory and call it 
bipartisan. It is nothing of the sort. 
Worse than that is the bill that this 
rule is to advance, and that is the so- 
called BBB bill. Now, my friends call it 
the Build Back Better bill. I call it the 
bad bad bad bill. It has been cobbled to-
gether in a convoluted process of 
missed deadlines, broken promises, and 
legislative sleight of hand. The defects 
are almost, Madam Speaker, too many 
to mention. 
My friends will say it is paid for. It is 
not. Quite frankly, they have about $1.5 
trillion of revenue as far as we can tell, 
and they have ‘‘$1.75 trillion’’ with ex-
penditures. But they intend to make 
every program here for 1 year or 3 
years or 5 years permanent. So if you 
add them all together, it is a minimum 
of $4 trillion with $1.5 trillion of reve-
nues. So it is an outrageously unbal-
anced bill. 
Some of my friends are going to vote 
for this because it has immigration in 
it. Really? Immigration, frankly, will 
not survive the Senate Parliamen-
tarian, and everybody on your side 
knows it. 
Some of them are going to vote for it 
because it has State and local tax re-
form, which is a nice way of saying, my 
gosh, tax breaks for millionaires and 
billionaires in blue States. That too, by

the way, will probably be changed in 
the United States Senate if you believe 
Senator SANDERS and Senator WARREN 
and look at what they have to say 
about this thing. 
Finally, we have some people who 
say: Well, I am going to vote for it be-
cause it is just the right thing to do. 
It is the wrong thing to do for the 
American people. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. COLE. This bill, by the way, will 
not get better in the Senate. 
Now, when it was sold to your side, 
you were told that we are not going to 
move ahead until we have an agree-
ment the Senate will accept. The Sen-
ate won’t accept this bill. We are going 
to send it over there, and a few Sen-
ators are going to write it and send it 
right back. If you don’t like it now, 
you are going to like it less when it 
gets here. 
Madam Speaker, we should defeat the 
rule; we should defeat the infrastruc-
ture package; and when it comes, we 
should defeat the bad bad bad bill. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are, once again, reminded to ad-
dress their remarks to the Chair. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am not going to spend any time debat-
ing my friend from Oklahoma. We have 
spent 12 hours in the Rules Committee 
debating. But I do want to say that I 
have genuine admiration for him as 
well 
as 
for 
Dr. 
BURGESS, 
Mrs. 
FISCHBACH, and Mr. RESCHENTHALER. 
We have strong disagreements, but I 
respect their service to this Congress 
and to this country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. 
SCOTT), who is the distinguished chair-
man of the Committee on Education 
and Labor. 
Mr. 
SCOTT 
of 
Virginia. 
Madam 
Speaker, every investment in the Build 
Back Better Act addresses an urgent 
challenge facing families, workers, and 
our economy. 
Within the jurisdiction of the Edu-
cation and Labor Committee, this pro-
posal makes childcare more affordable 
and invests in securing free, universal, 
and high-quality preschool for 3- and 4- 
year-olds. These provisions will give 
millions of parents the opportunity to 
reenter the workforce without having 
to worry that their children are safe. 
The Build Back Better Act makes 
nearly 9 million more children eligible 
for free school meals and invests in 
helping more children get healthy nu-
trition over the summer. It lowers the 
cost of higher education by increasing 
the value of Pell grants and making 
another major investment in histori-
cally Black colleges and universities 
and minority-serving institutions. 
The bill invests in high-quality job 
training programs so that workers can 
build their skills and increase their 
paychecks, and it will help employers 
find the skilled workers they need to 
grow their businesses. 
It shields workers from wage theft, 
unsafe workplaces, and violations of 
their right to organize by strength-
ening enforcement and increasing pen-
alties for companies that break the 
law. 
And it funds service opportunities 
and job training programs that will 
help protect our communities from the 
climate crisis. 
The Build Back Better Act strength-
ens programs that provide vital serv-
ices to millions of older Americans and 
Americans with disabilities. 
It lowers the cost of prescription 
drugs, particularly insulin. 
Madam Speaker, any of these provi-
sions individually would meaningfully 
improve the lives of our constituents, 
but taken together, this historic pro-
posal will lower costs for nearly every 
family, create millions of good-paying 
jobs, and set a strong foundation for 
the future of this country. It is fully 
paid for by making corporations and 
the wealthiest pay their fair share. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will join me in supporting the 
Build Back Better Act and taking a 
critical step toward a monumental vic-
tory for the American people. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Minnesota (Mrs. FISCHBACH), who 
is a valuable member of the Rules 
Committee. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the Representative from Texas 
for yielding to me. 
Madam Speaker, this bill has gone 
through 
several 
versions 
just 
this 
week—possibly just today—too many 
for even the bill’s sponsors to keep up 
with. 
During one of the several Rules Com-
mittee 
hearings, 
committee 
chairs 
could not even explain specific provi-
sions of the bill. 
How does the majority think the 
American public can really know what 
is in this bill? 
The majority will stick very closely 
to the talking points, using words like 
‘‘transformational,’’ ‘‘bold vision,’’ and 
‘‘values-based leadership,’’ and they 
will say things about affordable hous-
ing, universal pre-K, and drug pricing. 
But do we know where all that 
money is really going? Our constitu-
ents deserve to understand each of 
these programs but also the ones that 
they don’t include in their talking 
points. 
They have eliminated the bipartisan 
Hyde amendment protections that for 
40 years have been preventing tax dol-
lars from being used to pay for abor-
tion. It is being reported that there is 
approximately $756 billion in a welfare 
spending increase. 
How is that money being used? Where 
is it going? 
The bill also includes at least a few 
budget gimmicks. The bill offers par-
tial funding for some programs, cre-
ating temporary programs that are 
clearly meant to be permanent. This 
means the cost estimates for the bills 
are not accurate into the future. 
The committee chairs even have a 
hard time explaining how those budget 
gimmicks work. One of the biggest 
ticket items is the $320 billion in tax 
subsidies for electric vehicles, solar en-
ergy, wind, and other green energy, and 
an additional $25 million for the Presi-
dent to establish an environmental ini-
tiative. 
The American public might want to 
know that almost $45 billion is going to 
the IRS for increased enforcement and 
digital monitoring, especially since the 
Democrats have proposed spying on 
Americans’ bank accounts. 
This bill pours billions of dollars into 
government agencies to further insert 
government bureaucrats into the daily 
lives of American citizens. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
WATERS), who is the distinguished 
chairwoman from the Committee on 
Financial Services. 
Ms. WATERS. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman MCGOVERN
for cre-
ating this opportunity for me to share 
a few remarks with you this evening. 
For decades, we have failed to make 
the kinds of investments that allow 
families to access equal opportunities 
and communities to thrive, so I rise 
today in strong support of the Build 
Back Better Act to deliver the urgent 
investments 
our 
country 
needs 
to 
thrive. 
I have spent my career fighting for 
the dignity of safe and decent homes 
for all. In 2019, I coined the phrase 
‘‘housing is infrastructure.’’ It hasn’t 
been easy getting to this point, but I 
am incredibly proud to discuss the 
more than $150 billion for housing in-
vestments included in today’s bill that 
will create or preserve over 1 million 
homes. 
These investments include $65 billion 
to repair and rebuild our Nation’s pub-
lic housing; $25 billion for new rental 
assistance to support hundreds of thou-
sands of people struggling to afford 
rent and help people escape homeless-
ness and domestic violence; $26 billion 
to create and preserve hundreds of 
thousands of affordable and accessible 
housing units; and $10 billion in down-
payment assistance to make the dream 
of homeownership possible for the mil-
lions of first-generation home buyers. 
Housing is at the heart of building 
back better. 
Madam Speaker, I urge Members to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ and help make safe, decent, 
and affordable housing a reality for 
every family.

Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY), the designated con-
science of the Conference. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas for yielding.

leagues on the other side of the aisle

who designate themselves as moderates 
running around saying that they need a 
CBO score. Yet, we know this isn’t paid 
for. We all know it is a lie. 
But you know what you don’t need a 
CBO score for? You don’t need a CBO 
score to tell you that there is a 900 per-
cent increase in OSHA fines because 
you are going to cause small businesses 
to go out of business because of man-
dates. 
You don’t need a CBO score to know 
that there is an amnesty provision in 
here right when our border is com-
pletely on fire to provide amnesty for 7 
million. 
You don’t need a CBO score for the 
$500 billion of a unicorn energy strat-
egy that is already crippling the coun-
try, causing gas prices and electric 
bills to go up while President Biden is 
across the Atlantic begging for oil and 
taking cold baths in Glasgow. 
You don’t need a CBO score for that, 
and you don’t need to know what is in 
this garbage bill that is going to hurt 
the American people. Reject it re-
soundingly this evening. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New Jersey (Mr. PAL-
LONE), the distinguished chairman of 
the Energy and Commerce Committee. 
Mr. PALLONE. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in strong support of the Build 
Back Better Act. 
The Build Back Better Act builds on 
our efforts to make healthcare more af-
fordable and accessible for all Ameri-
cans. It extends premium subsidies 
that make healthcare more affordable 
for millions of Americans, and, finally, 
expands access to uninsured Americans 
who are unfairly caught in the Med-
icaid coverage gap. 
The legislation also provides critical 
relief at the pharmacy counter by fi-
nally giving Medicare the ability to ne-
gotiate lower drug prices with the 
pharmaceutical companies. It also caps 
out-of-pocket prescription drug costs 
for seniors at $2,000 a year, lowers insu-
lin prices for Americans with diabetes 
to $35 per month; and penalizes Big 
Pharma companies that unfairly raise 
prices. 
It permanently reauthorizes the Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program, dedi-
cates long overdue resources to provide 
maternal healthcare; and provides, for 
the first time, comprehensive hearing 
benefits under Medicare part B. 
The legislation also includes $150 bil-
lion in funding for home and commu-
nity-based care so seniors and people 
with disabilities can get the care that 
they need in their homes. 
The Build Back Better Act also ag-
gressively tackles the climate crisis 
with historic investments, moving us 
toward a clean energy economy while 
also producing millions of good-paying 
American jobs. The new $29 billion 
Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund will 
accelerate innovation in low- and zero- 
emission 
technologies, 
while 
also 
prioritizing the needs of environmental 
justice communities. 
Rebates for homeowners to electrify 
and make their houses more efficient 
will save them money and reduce emis-
sions. Investments in a 21st century 
electric grid will get more renewable 
energy online. A new Methane Emis-
sions Reduction Program will drive 
down pollution from the oil and gas in-
dustry. 
There is no time, Madam Speaker, to 
delay. Bold climate action is needed 
now, and the Build Back Better Act is 
a once-in-a-generation opportunity to 
invest in the American people and our 
future. 
It 
deserves 
strong 
support 
today. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am 
pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman 
from 
Pennsylvania 
(Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER), a valuable member of 
the Rules Committee. 
Mr. 
RESCHENTHALER. 
Madam 
Speaker, I thank my good friend and 
fellow Rules Committee member, Dr. 
BURGESS, for yielding me the time. 
Madam Speaker, let’s just look at 
the cost of this. This bill comes in at 
$4.1 trillion. That is more than double 
what my friends across the aisle claim 
this comes in at. And how do we pay 
for this? 
I will tell you how, crippling taxes 
and budget gimmicks. This bill would 
levy $420 billion in tax increases on our 
Nation’s small businesses, $800 billion 
in tax hikes on American companies, 
as well. 
So what does this mean for Ameri-
cans? What does this mean for the 
American consumer? Well, it means 
fewer jobs. It means higher prices. It 
means more reliance on China for our 
everyday goods. 
If you thought that today’s sky-high 
inflation, if you thought that our sup-
ply chain crises were bad, just wait 
until this bill goes into effect. H.R. 5376 
includes a new tax even on retirement 
plans. It bans production of domestic 
energy, and it raises taxes on natural 
gas. All of these policies, all of them 
would be disastrous for American job 
creators, 
disastrous 
for 
American 
workers, and disastrous for American 
families. 
But it is not bad news for all Ameri-
cans, Madam Speaker. Millionaires and 
billionaires have it made under this 
bill. This bill restores the SALT deduc-
tion, giving the wealthy up to $72,500 in 
tax breaks each year. These are the in-
dividuals that benefit under this, the 
wealthy, the elite. 
This legislation also includes $550 bil-
lion in green subsidies, ensuring that 
the top 1 percent that already benefits 
under this bill can put another Tesla in 
their garage. 
You can clearly see where the Demo-
crats’ priorities lie. It is not with the 
American worker. It is with the Amer-
ican top 1 percent elite. Americans de-
serve better. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am proud to yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Connecticut 
(Ms. 
DELAURO), 
the 
distinguished 
chair-
woman for the Committee on Appro-
priations. 
Ms. DELAURO. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of the Build Back Bet-
ter Act that is before us today, a pack-
age of legislation that I believe ranks 
alongside the New Deal and the Great 
Society in its impact. 
We must pass this legislation. It de-
livers a once-in-a-generation invest-
ment in children, families, and care-
givers, and, finally, a scale of invest-
ment in combating climate change 
that cannot wait. 
The Build Back Better Act expands 
and improves the child tax credit, the 
biggest cut in taxes for working fami-
lies with children, a groundbreaking 
and transformative policy that I have 
been fighting for nearly 20 years. I am 
proud that families with children under 
6 receive $300 a month, and children 6 
through 17 receive $250 a month. It is a 
lifeline for the middle class, and it lifts 
over 50 percent of children out of pov-
erty. It allows us to emerge from the 
shadows of the pandemic. It is Social 
Security for children. 
The Build Back Better Act adds to 
this with a first-time investment in 
childcare that guarantees that its costs 
will not exceed 7 percent of income. I 
am so proud that this package includes 
paid family and medical leave, which 
finally responds to the needs of work-
ers and their families so that they can 
take time off to care for themselves or 
for a loved one when they are ill. 
We have an opportunity to build the 
architecture for the future for working 
families in this country. Working and 
middle-class families across the United 
States are counting on us to build a 
better and a stronger America. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I am 
very pleased to yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. PFLUGER), 
one of the newest members of the 
Texas delegation from out in west 
Texas, the Permian Basin. 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my colleague from Texas for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, transparency, the 
American people deserve transparency, 
and they resoundingly rejected the bad 
policies proposed by the Democratic 
Party this week. Yet, my colleagues on 
the other side of the aisle are doubling 
down to pass legislation that will radi-
cally change our country for the worse. 
We are talking about transparency. 
We need transparency right now to un-
derstand the tax increases on all Amer-
icans; the outsourcing of energy and 
manufacturing jobs outside this coun-
try; and a half a trillion dollars to mis-
guided, new green policies that will, no 
doubt, bankrupt this country and sad-
dle our children and grandchildren 
with more debt. 
The misprioritized placating of green 
special interests that this administra-
tion has rushed to are unbelievable. It 
is Midland over Moscow; it is Odessa 
over OPEC; it is the Permian Basin 
over Putin, not the opposite. But blue 
State millionaires and journalists and 
those purchasing electric vehicles now, 
apparently—in the 2,000-plus pages— 
are going to get a handout.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6221 
November 5, 2021 
I am voting ‘‘no’’ on this radical leg-
islation, and I urge my colleagues to do 
the same. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, in 
a moment I will ask to amend the rule 
to correct a clerical error in the Rules 
Committee report. The amendment re-
inserts the text of the manager’s 
amendment posted on our website yes-
terday which was inadvertently omit-
ted from the copy of the report filed 
today. This is purely a clerical fix. 
AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR. MCGOVERN 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask unanimous consent to amend the 
pending resolution with an amendment 
that I have placed at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the amendment. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
In the first section of the resolution, strike 
‘‘the amendment printed in the report of the 
Committee on Rules accompanying this res-
olution’’ and insert ‘‘Rules Committee Print 
117–19’’. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts? 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution is amended. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank Dr. BURGESS and Rank-
ing Member COLE for their courtesy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER), the distinguished chairman 
on the Judiciary Committee. 
b 2100 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong support of the rule and the 
Build Back Better Act. There are so 
many important provisions of this leg-
islation, but I want to highlight just a 
few of the Judiciary Committee’s con-
tributions, which invest in our commu-
nities, our economy, and our people. 
We invest in communities by sup-
porting community violence interven-
tion programs, and we invest in our 
economy by providing resources to the 
antitrust 
enforcement 
agencies 
for 
their work to protect competition. 
We also invest in people by improv-
ing our immigration system to provide 
protections and stability to those who 
have made significant contributions to 
our economy. 
This legislation provides an oppor-
tunity for immigrants who have lived 
here since January 1, 2011, to receive 
temporary protection from removal, as 
well as work permits, if they are not 
inadmissible on criminal, national se-
curity, or other grounds. 
While this is not the permanent pro-
tection so many of us wanted, the 
peace of mind that comes along with 
protection from deportation is life 
changing for these people and their 
families. This legislation will provide 
security and stability to millions of 
people, including an estimated 1.6 mil-
lion Dreamers, 1 million farmworkers, 
and 2.6 million other essential workers 
who kept us safe during the pandemic. 
The bill would also restore the avail-
ability of over 400,000 unused immi-
grant visas lost due to COVID–19 or bu-
reaucratic delay and would enhance 
green card processing. 
This historic and transformative leg-
islation makes the investments we 
need to continue growing our economy 
and strengthening our communities for 
many years to come. I urge all of my 
colleagues to support the rule and the 
Build Back Better Act. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Oklahoma (Mrs. BICE). 
Mrs. BICE of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong opposi-
tion to the build back broke act. A 
vote for the underlying bill, along with 
the infrastructure package, is a vote 
for trillions in new taxes and spending 
that will cause inflation to skyrocket 
and make businesses in America less 
competitive. 
Together, 
these 
bills 
would lead to nearly $3 trillion in 
spending before the government is even 
funded for next year. 
Of the many concerning provisions in 
this bill, perhaps the worst are those 
concerning American energy. Ameri-
cans are already paying the most for a 
gallon of gas in 7 years; and now the 
Federal Government is warning Ameri-
cans that their home heating bills 
could cost 54 percent more this winter 
as compared to last year. How is that 
helping middle-income families? 
Many of my constituents have con-
tacted me about a provision in this bill 
to assess a $1,500 tax on each ton of 
methane emissions. This would dev-
astate oil and gas producers in my 
home State of Oklahoma, where this 
industry accounts for nearly 134,200 
jobs and over $57 billion in economic 
output, over a quarter of my State’s 
GDP. Not only would this policy kill 
tens of thousands of American jobs, it 
would also destroy a major source of 
my home State’s tax revenues, totaling 
over $13 billion annually, that fund 
schools, roads, hospitals, and our first 
responders. This is unconscionable. 
Madam Speaker, this rule would en-
able House Democrats to ram through 
a poorly written and ill-conceived bill 
that is not supported by the large ma-
jority of Americans. 
Despite the Biden administration’s 
claims that it is fully paid for, a new 
analysis by the Wharton School of 
Business shows the full costs of this 
measure being nearly $4 trillion, with 
only $1.5 trillion being paid for. The 
Democrats’ 
claims 
that 
this 
bill 
wouldn’t raise taxes on middle-class 
Americans is also false. This bill is full 
of regressive taxes that will hurt 
middle- and low-income Americans, 
while it gives huge tax breaks to the 
wealthiest 1 percent in high-tax States. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Mississippi (Mr. THOMPSON), the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Homeland Security. 
Mr. 
THOMPSON 
of 
Mississippi. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts for yield-
ing. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong sup-
port of the rule and the underlying leg-
islation. 
President Biden has a bold vision for 
getting our country back on track 
after a devastating pandemic and years 
of policies that ignored the struggles of 
so many Americans. 
What we are doing here today is 
about making government work for 
working people. 
The Committee on Homeland Secu-
rity, which I lead, has used this his-
toric opportunity to make significant 
long-term investments in three areas: 
cybersecurity; the protection of houses 
of worship and nonprofits from domes-
tic terrorism and other threats; and re-
ducing the Department of Homeland 
Security’s 
environmental 
footprint. 
These are three critical challenges con-
fronting our Nation and my constitu-
ents in Mississippi today. 
Last week, we marked 3 years since 
the deadliest attack on a Jewish com-
munity in United States history when 
a mass shooting took 11 lives in a 
Pittsburgh synagogue. 
Today, through the homeland secu-
rity title of this act, we will be able to 
give $100 million in new funding to help 
protect our houses of worship. 
This act also includes targeted fund-
ing to bolster the Nation’s cybersecu-
rity posture in significant ways. With 
the $500 million included there, we can 
do just that. 
Finally, we include $900 million in 
strategic investment to help DHS re-
duce its carbon footprint. Such invest-
ments have far-reaching and direct im-
pacts on our national security. 
I thank Budget Committee Chairman 
JOHN YARMUTH and Speaker PELOSI for 
their months of hard work and for 
prioritizing homeland security in this 
transformational legislation. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, after 
elections where the American people 
rebuked the left’s tax, spend, and Big 
Government control agenda, our Demo-
crat colleagues are doubling down on 
failed and unpopular policies that will 
exacerbate inflation, workforce and 
supply shortages that are hurting ev-
eryone, including waste, abuse, and 
fraud. 
Madam Speaker, this reconciliation 
bill has no return on investment for 
the American people. In fact, inde-
pendent analysis shows it decreases 
GDP and it will weaken U.S. economic 
strength worldwide. 
The bill raises $420 billion in taxes on 
small businesses while giving a mas-
sive tax break for high earners in high- 
tax states. 
It gives amnesty and driver’s licenses 
to illegal immigrants while a crisis 
rages at the border. It spends big on en-
titlements that disincentivize work 
and, as stated, are ripe for fraud. As 
well, it misses any mark for pay-for by 
$2 trillion to $3 trillion. 
This irresponsible spending bill, cou-
pled, by the way, with a bipartisan

November 5, 2021 
Transportation and Infrastructure bill, 
has made it very, unfortunately, im-
possible to support both, because the 
net effect of these dependent bills is 
detrimental to our economy, national 
security, and global competitiveness. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Oregon (Mr. DEFAZIO), the chairman of 
the Committee on Transportation and 
Infrastructure. 
Mr. DEFAZIO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in support of H.R. 5376, the Build Back 
Better Act. By passing this landmark 
legislation, House Democrats are mak-
ing lasting investments in the Amer-
ican people, our infrastructure, and are 
lowering taxes for working families 
across this country. 
It fights inflation. It is fully paid for. 
We accomplished this by making sure 
big corporations and the wealthiest 
pay their fair share, all while creating 
hundreds of thousands of good-paying 
jobs that don’t require a college degree. 
It is no wonder why this bill is popular 
with a strong majority of Americans 
and very unpopular with the Repub-
lican minority. 
As chairman of the Committee on 
Transportation and Infrastructure, I 
am particularly proud that the Build 
Back Better Act will provide a vital 
down payment in the fight against cli-
mate change. The transportation sec-
tor is the largest source of carbon pol-
lution. Important investments in my 
committee, and others, included in this 
bill to decarbonize transportation will 
address the climate crisis with the ur-
gency it deserves, something I have 
been pushing for a long time. 
The nearly $40 billion from the Com-
mittee on Transportation and Infra-
structure will support climate invest-
ments by reducing carbon emissions 
from surface transportation, aviation, 
ports, and public buildings; ensure crit-
ical transportation connections to af-
fordable housing and reconnect bi-
sected neighborhoods; robustly fund 
high-speed rail; supply ports as they 
struggle with the supply chain crisis; 
and ensure climate-resilient and af-
fordable investments in our wastewater 
infrastructure. 
For working families, the Build Back 
Better Act will provide universal pre- 
K, childcare, lower healthcare costs, 
and establish a permanent program of 4 
weeks paid family medical leave. It 
makes historic investments in housing 
and includes provisions to ensure af-
fordable pricing for certain prescrip-
tion drugs. This legislation also in-
cludes investments in tax enforcement 
to catch the tax cheats, the wealthiest 
tax cheats in America. Again, the Re-
publicans don’t much like that part of 
the bill. 
It should be clear: The Build Back 
Better Act will lower costs for families, 
put money back in the pockets of hard-
working Americans, create hundreds of 
thousands of family-wage jobs, and 
good benefits. 
By passing this bill, along with the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs 
Act, we are truly catapulting Ameri-
cans into the modern era, making the 
largest investments to combat climate 
change in American history. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation. 
b 2110 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
If we defeat the previous question, I 
will offer an amendment to the rule to 
immediately consider the Illegal Immi-
grant Payoff Prohibition Act, intro-
duced by Mr. MCCLINTOCK. This bill 
will prevent the Attorney General from 
making settlement payments to indi-
viduals and families who have entered 
the country illegally for claims arising 
out of the illegal entry. 
Madam Speaker, we have a crisis 
along our southern border, and this 
will only incentivize further unauthor-
ized immigration, overwhelm our bor-
der officials, and expose additional im-
migrants to danger. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to insert the text of my 
amendment into the RECORD, along 
with extraneous material, immediately 
prior to the vote on the previous ques-
tion. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Texas? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, to 
explain the amendment, I now yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), my good 
friend. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
if the previous question is defeated, we 
will take up the Illegal Immigrant 
Payoff Prohibition Act. 
Last week, our Nation was stunned 
by the revelation that the Biden ad-
ministration is about to use our tax 
dollars to pay thousands of illegal im-
migrants $450,000 apiece and up to a 
million dollars per family. 
Why? Because they were separated 
from their minor child when they were 
arrested for the crime of crossing our 
border illegally. 
Now, remember, any American cit-
izen arrested with a child is imme-
diately separated from that child. The 
adult goes to jail, the minor is taken 
into protective custody. That is what 
happened. 
The penalty for illegal entry is sup-
posed to be a fine and prison. The 
Democrats are literally changing it 
into a million-dollar jackpot. 
This 
administration 
has 
already 
made a mockery of our immigration 
laws by refusing to enforce them. This 
has now produced the greatest illegal 
border incursion in our country’s his-
tory. 
Working- and middle-class Ameri-
cans are the most harmed by this be-
cause it is their wages that are de-
pressed by flooding the market with 
low-wage labor. It is their classrooms 
that are strained with non-English- 
speaking students. It is their emer-
gency rooms that are overwhelmed by 
illegal immigrants demanding basic 
services. It is their communities that 
are made more dangerous as gang ac-
tivity increases and criminal, illegal 
aliens are released back into their 
neighborhoods. 
And now, to add insult to injury, the 
Democrats propose taking their tax 
dollars 
to 
make 
thousands 
of 
lawbreakers fabulously wealthy as an 
apology for President Trump actually 
enforcing our laws and securing our 
border. That is insane. 
The 
American 
people 
understand 
that quite clearly. Republicans will not 
allow this twisted travesty to go un-
challenged. If there are any sane Demo-
crats left in this House, I invite them 
to join us by voting ‘‘no’’ on the pre-
vious question. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
include in the RECORD a November 4 
Vox article titled, ‘‘This May Finally 
Be the Year Congress Lets Medicare 
Negotiate Drug Prices.’’ 
[Nov. 4, 2021] 
VOX: THIS MAY FINALLY BE THE YEAR CON-
GRESS
LETS
MEDICARE
NEGOTIATE
DRUG 
PRICES 
(By Dylan Scott) 
Democrats in Congress have managed to 
revive a prescription drug reform proposal 
that would allow the party to finally deliver 
on a campaign promise they’ve been making 
for 15 years: letting Medicare negotiate drug 
prices and lowering drug costs for patients. 
The breakthrough was the result of nego-
tiations with a few moderate members of the 
Democratic conference who were uneasy 
with an earlier version. That version was 
briefly dropped from the Build Back Better 
Act, Democrats’ wide-ranging social spend-
ing bill. 
Nothing can be considered final until both 
the House and the Senate pass the legisla-
tion, but the new draft of the Medicare drug 
negotiations proposal appears to make some 
concessions to centrists who share the drug 
industry’s concerns about the effect of price 
controls on medical innovation. 
Still, the new plan would also be a rare 
loss for the pharmaceutical industry, which 
fervently opposes every version of such a 
proposal and has lobbied aggressively to stop 
it. 
Under the revised plan, the maximum price 
Medicare would pay would be 75 percent of 
what commercial US insurers pay on average 
for drugs that have been on the market be-
tween 9 and 12 years, with the maximum de-
creasing the longer the drug has been avail-
able. Democrats had originally set a max-
imum price of 120 percent of the average of 
what other wealthy nations pay for the same 
drug. The change should lead to drug makers 
losing less revenue, the goal of moderates, 
though no CBO score is yet available. 
Fewer drugs would also be subject to nego-
tiation. Under the new plan, the government 
would start by negotiating the cost of 10 
drugs in 2025, before gradually ramping up to 
20 after a few years. Under the original plan, 
the government would have negotiated the 
price of 25 drugs immediately and that num-
ber would have eventually increased to 50. 
The plan now also includes a moratorium 
on negotiations for drugs that have been on 
the market for less than 9 years (for small- 
molecule drugs) or 12 years (for biologics). 
Drug companies would be penalized for price 
hikes that are higher than inflation under

the new proposal, a holdover from prior 
versions of the plan. 
Overall, the new plan would save the gov-
ernment about half as much money ($250 bil-
lion, by the White House’s estimates) as the 
original plan ($450 billion). That has forced 
Dems to cut down their health care spending 
plans, for example, by nixing a progressive 
proposal to add dental and vision benefits to 
Medicare. Nevertheless, Democrats can take 
the savings from their new drug pricing plan 
and use it to lower drug costs for seniors. 
The Build Back Better Act would set a 
hard cap on how much seniors who enrolled 
in Medicare’s prescription drug benefit pay 
for prescription drugs: $2,000 out of pocket 
annually. It would also require private Part 
D plans to cover more of the cost of expen-
sive drugs, which experts say may motivate 
those plans to try to extract lower prices 
from drug makers on medications not in-
cluded in the new government-led negotia-
tions. 
The new proposal also adds a provision 
that requires all insurers to cover insulin, so 
patients pay only $35 a month of their own 
money for the medication. 
Democrats have finally built sufficient mo-
mentum to approve Medicare negotiations 
for the first time. They have wanted to do 
this since at least 2003, when Medicare Part 
D was first created. While the party still has 
a long way to go on figuring out what comes 
next in its health care agenda, this was one 
priority they knew they wanted to get done. 
And with the moment of truth upon us, it 
looks like they will. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
With the Build Back Better bill, we 
are on the verge of finally allowing 
Medicare to negotiate drug prices, 
which will bring down the cost sub-
stantially for consumers. 
This has been decades in the making 
and is overwhelmingly supported by 
the American people. There is even a 
provision that caps insulin costs in this 
bill to just $35 a month. This is a big 
deal for so many of our constituents. 
We are making history here today. 
This bill will transform people’s lives 
for the better. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 minutes 
to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. 
JOHNSON), 
the 
distinguished 
chair-
woman of the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in strong support 
of the underlying bill, the Build Back 
Better Act, and in favor of this rule. 
As chairperson of the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology and a 
Member of this body, I am steadfastly 
committed to ensuring that our coun-
try has a bright future. This bill pro-
vides the resources to help accomplish 
just that. 
The underlying bill we will pass, 
hopefully tonight, will make critical 
investments that ensure that we are 
able to address the challenges we face. 
These resources will help us address 
the climate crisis, rebuild after the 
pandemic, and renew and repair our re-
search infrastructure. This bill and 
funding will strengthen our competi-
tiveness and bolster our position as a 
global leader in science and tech-
nology. 
I thank my colleagues for their work 
on this bill. Investments in research 
and development now will pay untold 
dividends for the future health and 
prosperity of our country. 
I am proud to stand in support of the 
Build Back Better plan, and I urge that 
we pass this bill swiftly, as soon as we 
can pass this rule, and thoughtfully for 
the good of the American people today 
as well as future generations who will 
benefit from these investments. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), a member of 
the Republican leadership and a valu-
able member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I rise 
in strong opposition to the rule, but 
specifically 
against 
this 
massive, 
multitrillion dollar tax-and-spend bill. 
Of course, we just got the text last 
night, over 2,300 pages. As we have been 
combing through it, I would like to 
point out a few pieces in this bill. 
Let’s start with a natural gas tax. 
President Biden promised that anyone 
who makes less than $400,000 a year 
will not pay a dime in new taxes. He 
even whispers it into the microphone. 
The only problem is he breaks the 
promise right here in the bill with a 
tax that, according to the American 
Gas Association, will increase house-
hold electricity rates by 30 percent. By 
the way, it is low-income families that 
will be hit the hardest with that in-
crease. Broken promise by President 
Biden right there. 
Then you go down and you look at 
amnesty. It has been talked about. Mil-
lions of additional people will get am-
nesty in this bill, and it comes at a 
time where President Biden is negoti-
ating—initially, he said he wasn’t, and 
then the White House had to go back 
up and say the Justice Department is 
negotiating—half-a-million 
dollar 
checks to people who came across our 
border illegally. And then they are 
going to give amnesty to millions more 
people. Estimates are 7 million more 
people. Can you imagine the flood that 
will come over when they hear that 
you can get half a million dollars per 
person if President Biden gets his way? 
Then you go down the line. There is 
more, unfortunately. We will comb 
through IRS agents. How many of us 
have our phones ringing off the hooks 
with people calling saying: Please add 
87,000 more IRS agents to the rolls? Not 
one of us has probably gotten that call. 
Yet they put it in the bill. 
They call this infrastructure. They 
call this equity. Whatever they want to 
call it, it is an army of IRS agents that 
are going to comb through our bank 
accounts. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman an additional 1 
minute. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, they 
are going to be combing through your 
bank account. 
Why? Because they have to generate 
hundreds of billions of dollars to spend 
on more inflation-inducing spending. 
That is right, according to the Penn 
Wharton Budget Model, you are going 
to have over $4 trillion of spending 
with $1.5 trillion of new taxes. 
By the way, that is $2.5 trillion of ad-
ditional debt, even though the Presi-
dent says there is no cost. No cost, just 
$2.5 trillion of debt. But these IRS 
agents are going to have to account for 
over $200 billion to find money from 
your checking accounts. That is what 
they are trying to do by dark of night. 
We started the morning at 8 a.m. We 
are here after 9 p.m. starting to get 
into the details of this bill. No wonder 
they don’t want a CBO score. No won-
der they want to do this by dark of 
night. This is going to induce more in-
flation that is hurting families all 
across America. 
Listen to what the voters of Virginia 
said. Stop the madness. Defeat this 
bill. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Maryland (Mr. HOYER), the distin-
guished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, by 
adopting this rule, we are now lining 
up at the runway in preparation to 
land the plane on Build Back Better. 
As we wait for the CBO to complete 
its work and produce its analysis, 
which I believe will confirm an esti-
mate from the White House based on 
the Joint Committee on Taxation’s 
analysis of the bill’s revenue impact, 
and the preliminary scoring from CBO 
that this bill is fully paid for. 
Now, I am not saying it doesn’t spend 
money. It does not create debt. When 
the Republicans passed their tax bill, 
of course, they gave themselves a ceil-
ing of $1.5 trillion that they did not pay 
for on the assertion that that tax cut 
would pay for itself. 
The problem is none of their tax cuts 
have ever paid for themselves. None. 
Zero. Zip. This bill is paid for. And 
what it will do for the American people 
will be life changing for working fami-
lies and moms and children in this 
country. 
b 2120 
Today, we are going to pass a rule, 
which will allow for the consideration 
of this bipartisan infrastructure bill to 
invest $1.2 trillion. 
I was talking about Build Back Bet-
ter. I am now talking about the bipar-
tisan infrastructure bill, 69 Senators 
voting for the bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, which will make an extraordinary 
difference in the lives of the people in 
this country and, as importantly, job 
creation in this country, a million jobs 
per year. That is what this rule will do. 
This bill will help our businesses cre-
ate millions of good jobs here in our 
country, and it will make significant 
investments in promoting the deploy-
ment of clean energy technologies and 
making our infrastructure more resil-
ient against climate change. That is 
what this bill will do.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6224 
November 5, 2021 
And again, I am referring to the bi-
partisan infrastructure act passed with 
69 votes in the United States Senate, 
almost half of the Republicans voting 
for it. This legislation will mean that 
our majority has delivered a major vic-
tory for the American people in a bi-
partisan way, and passing this rule will 
mean that next up is the trans-
formational legislation to invest in 
America’s human infrastructure—our 
children, our families, and opportuni-
ties for the most vulnerable in our 
country to access the American Dream. 
Unlike our Republican friends who 
passed their tax bill, which was about 
85 to 90 percent of it going to the 
wealthiest Americans, this bill deals 
with all Americans, particularly those 
who are the most vulnerable, most 
challenged, and having the most dif-
ficult time in our country. 
So let’s get this done today and show 
the American people that their Con-
gress works for them. We ought to vote 
‘‘yes’’ on this. 
Now, let me say what this rule pro-
vides for: a bill which will add 11⁄2 mil-
lion jobs per year. This bill, the Build 
Back Better bill, will add 11⁄2 million 
jobs per year and, on average, across 
the whole decade, increase labor force 
participation and accelerate the return 
to full employment; increase our total 
GDP by $3 trillion throughout the next 
decade; keep prices stable and decrease 
inflationary pressures as we continue 
our recovery from the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
The Nation has long underinvested in 
its infrastructure. 
Now, I am sure as my friends across 
the aisle will remember, in 2016, Presi-
dent Trump was then campaigning for 
office, and he pledged to the American 
people that he would present a trillion- 
dollar infrastructure program for this 
country. 2017, no such infrastructure 
bill. 2018, no such infrastructure bill. 
2019, no such infrastructure bill. But in 
early 2019, the President said $1 trillion 
is not enough; we ought to do $2 tril-
lion. That was President Trump. $2 
trillion was his suggestion. 
And we asked him: Mr. President, we 
will support that. Tell us how you 
think we ought to fund it. Oh, we have 
to fund it? 
The President never came forth with 
either a bill or with funding for a bill. 
So we didn’t pass that. 
This President said, no, we do need 
infrastructure, and the figure that 
Trump used is not, certainly, what this 
country needs, but it is a very good 
start. So he sent down a bill to accom-
plish that objective. That bill was not 
the one we passed because eight Sen-
ators from the Republican side of the 
aisle and eight Senators from the 
Democratic side of the aisle got to-
gether and talked about what we can 
agree upon. 
I hear so much, particularly when I 
have colloquies with the minority whip 
about bipartisanship, that we ought to 
come together, that we ought to work 
together. Well, eight Senators on the 
Republican side and eight Senators on 
the Democratic side did exactly that. 
And what happened? They then went 
down to the White House; they talked 
to the President; and the President 
worked with them, and they agreed. 
So this is a bill that the President, 19 
Republican Senators, and 50 Demo-
cratic Senators agreed was good for 
America. And that is what we are ena-
bling tonight. 
The Nation, unfortunately, has long 
underinvested in its infrastructure and 
social needs and has been slow to re-
spond to the threat posed by climate 
change. Our national security appa-
ratus, including the four-star generals 
who lead our various service arms, has 
said the most existential threat to the 
security of the United States of Amer-
ica is climate change, global warming. 
This bill deals with that existential 
threat. 
The policies being considered would 
direct the benefits of the stronger 
growth to lower income Americans. 
Now, that may be why it is sort of not 
what my Republican friends think 
ought to be done. Although the whip 
talked about that somewhat, that is 
not what their bill did. 
It addresses the long-running skew-
ing of income and wealth distribution 
in America, the richest country on 
Earth, where we have so many people 
in poverty, so many children who don’t 
have a good education, so many chil-
dren who don’t have the healthcare 
they need. This bill addresses those 
issues. 
On November 3, 2021, according to the 
Economic Policy Institute, ‘‘The Build 
Back 
Better 
Act’s 
macroeconomic 
boost looks more valuable by the day.’’ 
They said their analysis shows that the 
U.S. economy is not overheating due to 
too much fiscal relief and recovery pro-
vided earlier this year. Expert after ex-
pert says that. 
Did we have pent-up demand? We did. 
Are we having a supply side problem 
because of the pandemic? That is abso-
lutely accurate. The Build Back Better 
agenda will ease bottlenecks and im-
prove the resiliency of our supply 
chains. 
It also boosts long-term growth and 
economic security through public in-
vestments and deeper social insurance. 
It provides a macroeconomic insurance 
policy against aggregate demand grow-
ing too slowly in coming years. 
An open letter from Nobel laureates 
in support of the economic recovery 
agenda said this: ‘‘Success in the 21st 
century will require building upon the 
bipartisan infrastructure deal that has 
passed the Senate, which prioritizes in-
vestments in our Nation’s ‘hard’ infra-
structure.’’ That is what this rule will 
provide for. 
Furthermore, they say: ‘‘The Presi-
dent’s Build Back Better agenda em-
ploys a broader conception of infra-
structure by making critical invest-
ments in human capital, the care econ-
omy, research and development, public 
education, and more, which will reduce 
families’ costs.’’ 
‘‘Because this agenda invests in long- 
term economic capacity,’’ they went on 
to say, ‘‘and will enhance the ability to 
more Americans to participate produc-
tively in the economy, it will ease 
longer term inflationary pressures.’’ 
That was Nobel laureates talking 
about this economic recovery plan. It 
was signed by 15 of those Nobel laure-
ates. 
Madam Speaker, the last 20 months 
have presented our Nation with chal-
lenges we could neither have foreseen 
nor envisioned. A global pandemic took 
the lives of nearly three-quarters of a 
million Americans. If you went out to 
the lawn surrounding the George Wash-
ington Monument, you saw rows and 
rows and rows of white flags indicating 
those over 700,000, almost now 750,000 
Americans who lost their lives as a re-
sult of this pandemic. 
We responded in a bipartisan way, 
and because of it, we did not go into a 
depression. Because of it, we saved lit-
erally hundreds of thousands of lives, 
maybe millions of lives. 
b 2130 
Because of our investment, we saved 
businesses. Because of our investment, 
we saved jobs for literally millions of 
Americans. 
From February 2020 to February 2021, 
2.3 million women in our country left 
the workforce, in many cases, to care 
for children who had to stay home from 
school or care for a sick loved one. 
Very frankly, this bill, as well as the 
Build Back Better Act, will address the 
critical shortage of childcare in this 
country. 
Thankfully, because of the swift de-
velopment and deployment of life-
saving vaccines, our economy is com-
ing back. I don’t know whether any of 
my Republican friends mentioned that 
we created over 500,000 jobs last month. 
This administration has enjoyed over 5 
million new jobs in America. That is 
twice the number of jobs that Mr. 
Trump had in his best year. And 7 mil-
lion more jobs, because Mr. Trump in 
his last year lost 2 million jobs—now 
that was because of the pandemic, we 
understand that. But to say that 500,000 
new jobs is not an economy that is 
growing and providing sustenance for 
its people. 
The delta variant continues to im-
pact, of course, that recovery, which is 
slower than we would like to see. Our 
economy, however, has brought back 
nearly 5 million jobs since President 
Biden took office: now 5.5 million jobs. 
Americans are getting back to work. 
And what this bill will do is to encour-
age the continuance of the growth of 
our economy, continue to grow the 
ability to educate and raise our chil-
dren, the ability of women and single 
parents—male and female—to be in the 
workplace. We need their expertise, we 
need their talent, we need their energy. 
And providing safe, reliable, affordable 
childcare will make such a difference. 
Madam Speaker, this bill that we 
provide for, being considered as we end

this debate, will help America grow. 
And the bill that the rule provides to 
consider at some time in the near fu-
ture, will provide Americans with a 
better, safer, more secure life. For 
them, for their children, for their 
friends, and their neighbors, let’s pass 
both of these bills. 
Let’s pass the bipartisan infrastruc-
ture framework tonight. And let us in 
the very near future, as this rule pro-
vides, pass the Build Back Better Act. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire as to how much time remains 
on our side? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Texas has 31⁄2 minutes re-
maining. The gentleman from Massa-
chusetts has 43⁄4 minutes remaining. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. KHANNA), my friend. 
Mr. KHANNA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as a progressive, I 
rise today to say that our party must 
unify, and we must vote ‘‘yes’’ today 
on both the rule and the bipartisan in-
frastructure bill. 
Now, I know there is all this jargon 
about rule and BBB and BIF, but real-
ly, to me, this is very simple. The ques-
tion is: Do you trust the President? 
I trust President Biden. I trust that 
President Biden cares about the work-
ing class. And for 40 years, the working 
class has not had any support. On the 
other side, for 4 years under Trump, 
they gave tax cuts to the rich. Presi-
dent Biden wants to give money to 
working families in the child allow-
ance. He wants to give them a tax cut. 
He wants to make sure they can pay 
for childcare. And he understands the 
working class experience. 
We will unify as a party. We will vote 
‘‘yes’’ tonight. We will deliver. And 
this President is going to make history 
by finally looking out for the working 
class and the middle class in this coun-
try. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the chairman for his great lead-
ership in bringing this important legis-
lation to the floor, a rule of the House, 
to expand opportunity for so many peo-
ple in our country, to protect our plan-
et for future generations, to do so with 
great equity in a way that builds back 
better for women. 
Madam Speaker, thanks to the tire-
less work of so many in the House 
Democratic Caucus, all of our Mem-
bers, our chairs of the committees of 
jurisdiction, the members of those 
committees worked so hard bringing 
their years of experience, knowledge, 
and judgment on how we would go for-
ward to fulfill the President’s vision. 
President Biden has a big vision for 
America and for our future, a vision 
that has equity in it so that we are 
building with fairness for all in our 
country to participate in the increased 
prosperity of our Nation. 
We thank the President for his great 
leadership, the vision that he has put 
forth, the knowledge of all of his years 
in the Congress, and as Vice President, 
in terms of legislation, and his respect 
for all of our Members, paying so much 
attention to their concerns and, more 
especially, to how we can work to-
gether to meet the needs of the Amer-
ican people. This is build back better 
with women, build back better for the 
people. 
It will be one of the most significant 
legislative undertakings that any of us 
has ever been part of. And I say that 
with great proprietary attitude toward 
the Affordable Care Act, which was 
transformative and historic. This is 
even bigger than that. In fact, it 
strengthens the Affordable Care Act. 
So if you are talking about how we 
want to have immediate and enduring 
difference for the workers and families, 
creating jobs, securing middle class tax 
cuts, lowering costs for families, and 
making the wealthiest pay their fair 
share, all while contributing to reduc-
ing the national debt—making every-
one pay their fair share. 
Did I hear a laugh over there? Did I 
hear a laugh from those who added $2 
trillion in tax cuts for the richest peo-
ple in America, 83 percent of it going to 
the top 1 percent? 
This is paid for. And more than paid 
for. 
In terms of jobs, together with the 
also historic bipartisan infrastructure 
bill, it will create an estimated 2 mil-
lion jobs each year, 20 million jobs into 
the next decade. And that is just imme-
diately to this legislation, not talking 
about what it will generate as many 
more women are in the workplace. If 
you look at any piece of the bill, it 
would be extraordinary. 
Madam Speaker, if we came to the 
floor and just talked about protecting 
our planet for our children, it is always 
about the children, the green aspects of 
this bill are for the children and their 
future. It is about creating good-paying 
jobs. It is about, again, a generational 
challenge that we have. It is about 
healthcare, 
the 
air 
our 
children 
breathe, the water they drink, an at-
mosphere in which they can thrive. It 
is 
about 
jobs—again, 
good-paying, 
green 
jobs, 
making 
America 
pre-
eminent in the world in the new green 
technologies and sharing that informa-
tion with other nations and under-
developed countries, so that they can 
succeed as well. 
It is also about security. National se-
curity experts come to us and say that 
we must treat this as a security issue. 
Years ago, when I was still on the In-
telligence Committee itself—I am still 
ex-officio—but then in the committee, 
we were even seeing the need for using 
our technology and our knowledge in 
terms of protecting our country, recog-
nizing the assault on our planet that 
the climate crisis would be. 
And why? Because as you know, with 
rising sea levels, encroachment of 
deserts, drying up of rivers, the great 
rivers of Asia, all of the things that are 
happening, the thermal management of 
the planet, the list goes on and on, all 
of this has created, in many ways, 
drought, famine, floods, violent storms 
of record proportion. 
b 2140 
So the experts say that the competi-
tion for habitat and resources that this 
causes can increase conflict. Migra-
tions and the rest can cause conflict. 
We must anticipate that as a security 
concern, as it is already. 
And then when we talk about health 
for the children, jobs for their families, 
security for our country, we also recog-
nize that this is a moral issue for us 
all. If you believe, as do I, that this 
beautiful planet is God’s creation, then 
we have a responsibility to be good 
stewards. 
But even if you don’t share that reli-
gious belief, we all agree that we owe it 
to our children—I would hope we all 
agree—that we owe it to our children 
to pass this planet on to them and fu-
ture generations in a responsible way. 
So even if this bill were just about 
that, it would be historic in its propor-
tion and its transformative nature, and 
worthy of just voting for that. But it 
isn’t about just that. We will make his-
toric progress to universal healthcare 
coverage in America, strengthening the 
ACA to make coverage more affordable 
for those who buy insurance on their 
own. It also contains the Medicare 
hearing benefit, making a major dif-
ference for seniors. 
As 
you 
probably 
know, 
Madam 
Speaker, I know you do, but there are 
some States that would not expand 
Medicaid. This is a great disadvantage 
to children, not only children but sen-
iors who depend on Medicaid for long- 
term healthcare and the rest. In this 
legislation we expand not just Med-
icaid but the Affordable Care Act to 
draw those people into the plan at 
practically no cost to them, except 
their participation in an appropriate 
way. 
Build Back Better contains historic 
Medicare prescription drug negotia-
tion. For the very first time, the Sec-
retary of Health and Human Services 
would have the power to negotiate 
lower prices for some of the most ex-
pensive medicines our seniors use. 
What is in the bill is a compromise. I 
have, for a generation, been fighting 
for this important provision, for the 
Secretary to negotiate for lower prices, 
really since, on this floor, we passed 
Medicare part D, which was a real give-
away to the pharmaceutical industry. 
This now reins that in. 
Under this agreement, when people 
go to the pharmacy, instead of paying 
hundreds and hundreds of dollars for 
their insulin, their bill will be capped 
at just $35 a month. Think of what the 
difference that makes in people’s lives 
and how important insulin is to them.

In total, the most that any senior 
would be allowed to pay for their medi-
cations in Medicare part D per year is 
$2,000 and not one penny more. Big 
Pharma’s outrageous price hikes above 
inflation will be halted, not only for 
seniors, but for all Americans. That is 
remarkable. That was one of the strong 
points of this agreement. There we are 
with healthcare. 
Under 
the 
green 
framework, 
we 
talked 
about 
climate. 
Under 
the 
health, we talked about the Affordable 
Care Act, Medicare, et cetera, and the 
prescription drug benefit. Now we are 
talking about Build Back Better. 
There is a hashtag: Care can’t wait. 
Indeed, it can’t, and help is on the way. 
In terms of family care, Build Back 
Better is the most transformative ini-
tiative in children and caregivers in 
generations. For decades, hardworking 
families have been struggling under a 
system that stacks the deck against 
them. A situation made even worse by 
the COVID pandemic. And that COVID 
pandemic sort of pulled back the veil 
on how hard it was for people to deal 
with many of these challenges. 
Our legislation, the Build Back Bet-
ter, builds back better because it saves 
most families more than half of their 
spending on childcare; delivers free 
pre-K for every 3- and 4-year-old in 
America. Just on those two scores, par-
ents earning, children learning. It is 
possible because of childcare and the 
universal pre-K; giving more than 35 
million families a major tax cut by ex-
tending the expanded Biden child tax 
credit; putting money in the pockets of 
families with children; expand access 
to high-quality home care for older 
Americans and Americans living with 
disabilities. 
Madam Speaker, even some of my 
colleagues in this body on both sides of 
the aisle have frequently told me that 
they spend more time caring for their 
parents when they are sick than they 
did when their children were small and 
they were sick because their parents 
are older and more in need of that at-
tention. 
Well, this not only provides the high- 
quality care for older Americans and 
Americans with disabilities, it also rec-
ognizes the value of those people who 
are providing that care, treating them 
with respect and with proper pay. 
Then we make a significant contribu-
tion to workforce development. If we 
are going to build back better, even in 
this bill, the bipartisan infrastructure 
framework, it is important to have 
people be trained for the jobs; and not 
only in construction, but in home 
healthcare and in other ways. 
In doing so, it was very important to 
President Biden and to all of us, but 
this was a must for him in every aspect 
of the legislation, to advance equity 
and opportunity with investments in 
maternal care, nutrition, housing, and 
more. That equity is part of what is 
happening in the infrastructure bill 
and here. We must have equity. We 
cannot perpetuate disparities in in-
come and living conditions and the 
rest, and to do so with respect for 
work, honoring work, and to do so in a 
way that has equity. 
We have included permanent uni-
versal paid family and medical leave, 
which is a pillar of our work for fami-
lies. I hope that this will stay in the 
bill. 
We must get children learning, par-
ents earning, as I mentioned, in a way 
that assures women can follow a career 
path as they meet their family needs. 
Just think of the liberation that this 
is, that women will be able to go to 
work, follow their career path, help 
provide for their families—maybe they 
are a single parent—provide for their 
families, all the while knowing that 
their children, or if it happens to be a 
parent, are well cared for. I am very ex-
cited about what it does in that regard. 
Again, I talked about the climate, 
and I won’t go back into it, except to 
say that with all that we want to do in 
the climate sector, we have to meet 
our goals. If we are going to be true to 
any promise to our children, grand-
children, or future generations, Build 
Back Better will enable us to do so by 
cutting greenhouse gas pollution by 
over a gigaton, helping meet the Presi-
dent’s vision to cut pollution in half by 
2030, and protecting our children’s 
health. It will drive forward the clean 
energy economy, creating good-paying 
jobs and lowing families’ energy costs. 
It will advance environmental justice, 
back to that equity issue, as it will 
educate a workforce for the future and 
advance housing initiatives that are re-
silient and green. 
The Build Back Better is fully paid 
for and reduces the national debt. Ac-
cording to the nonpartisan Joint Com-
mittee on Taxation, this legislation is 
fully paid for with its tax increase pro-
visions in the bill raising $1.5 trillion 
over 10 years, not including the addi-
tional savings from the prescription 
drug pricing and the IRS tax enforce-
ment. 
Further analyses, based on CBO esti-
mates, show that the legislation re-
duces the deficit by over $36 billion 
over the next 10 years—are you ready 
for this, Madam Speaker—then by at 
least $2 trillion over the second decade. 
b 2150 
As it reduces the debt and grows the 
economy, Build Back Better will not 
increase inflation, according to ex-
perts. As 17 Nobel Prize-winning econo-
mists recently wrote: ‘‘Because this 
agenda invests in long-term economic 
capacity and will enhance the ability 
of more Americans to participate pro-
ductively in the economy, it will ease 
longer term inflationary pressures.’’ 
Inflation is very important. We must 
pay attention to it. That is why it is so 
essential to pay for the legislation. But 
I am a pay-as-you-go person. I always 
want to be able to pay for and offset 
any new investments that we have, so 
this legislation is consistent with that. 
President John F. Kennedy once said 
that to govern is to choose. To craft 
and pass this bill, choices had to be 
made. We see it is big; it is trans-
formative; and it is historic, so it will 
be challenging. Different Members will 
have different views of how we go 
about prioritizing and the rest. 
In this very Chamber, when people 
come here, I love to tell them about 
the history of this Chamber. This is a 
chamber that abolished slavery, a 
chamber that declared war in World 
War II and before. It is a historic cham-
ber, a place that we all must treat with 
great respect. And we will enhance the 
luster of this institution if we pass this 
historic, transformative legislation. 
No piece of legislation contains ev-
erything, and once we pass Build Back 
Better, more work will remain to 
strengthen the financial security of 
America’s working families, to im-
prove families’ healthcare, to protect 
the planet, and more. But we cannot 
and will not miss the opportunity to 
build back better for women, for chil-
dren, and for the people. 
The Build Back Better agenda cre-
ates more jobs, secures more major tax 
cuts for the middle class, and lowers 
costs to families while making the 
wealthiest pay their fair share. It is 
not punitive; it is fair share. 
It is an agenda for workers, for fami-
lies, for children, for the planet, and, as 
I said, for women. The passage of this 
rule will take a strong step in achiev-
ing this goal. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support the rule. I do so 
with, again, special congratulations 
and gratitude to the distinguished 
chair of the Rules Committee, Mr. 
MCGOVERN; the distinguished chair of 
the Budget Committee, Mr. YARMUTH; 
and so many of the chairs that you 
have heard from here this evening: Mr. 
RICHIE NEAL from Ways and Means, so 
important in all of this; FRANK PAL-
LONE
of the Energy and Commerce 
Committee; and BOBBY SCOTT in terms 
of the Education and Labor Com-
mittee—these are three really impor-
tant committees in the legislation— 
and housing, MAXINE WATERS and her 
contribution in that regard; Mr. GRI-
JALVA, in terms of climate issues, from 
the Natural Resources Committee. The 
list goes on and on. 
It is a list that is really a gallery of 
heroes, of people who have brought 
their 
knowledge, 
their 
experience, 
their judgment, and their legislative 
skill to bear to get the job done for the 
people. 
We do all of this in such a way that 
it has equity. 
We thank the President of the United 
States for his extraordinary leadership, 
his encyclopedic knowledge of what is 
in the legislation because he has been 
working on these issues so long, afford-
ing the opportunity it will provide for 
families, children, dads, and moms who 
need to have help at home and to do so 
in a way that treats people with re-
spect, respect for their work, respect 
for their families, and respect for their 
future.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H6227 
November 5, 2021 
Madam Speaker, I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote 
on the legislation. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
am prepared to close. 
Mr. BURGESS. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, a couple of things 
come to mind. We are told that, by 
2050, the United States will no longer 
have carbon emissions and that, over 
that same 30 years, energy require-
ments in this country, energy con-
sumption, are going to increase 50 to 60 
percent. Those two facts do not match 
up. 
It is strange that in this massive bill 
we have in front of us—$4 trillion, $5 
trillion, $6 trillion, who knows—there 
is not one word and not $1 for nuclear 
energy, for advanced nuclear energy, 
for new nuclear technologies and re-
processing of spent fuel. You cannot 
produce 50 to 60 percent more energy 
with windmills and solar panels. China 
can’t produce enough solar panels for 
you to keep up with that kind of en-
ergy demand in a zero-carbon future. 
We have heard a lot this evening. In 
fact, the previous speaker recalled 
President Kennedy. His was the first 
inaugural I remember, back in elemen-
tary school, and he exhorted us, he ex-
horted the people of our generation: 
Ask not what your country can do for 
you. 
Yet, we find ourselves here tonight 
with this behemoth of a bill that is 
going to spend our children’s and chil-
dren’s children’s inheritance as far as 
the eye can see. 
This bill was finalized by just a cou-
ple of you in some secret room some-
place in this Capitol behind closed 
doors with no input from Members, 
Members who represent literally one- 
half of the country. No one seemed to 
pay attention to when the voters spoke 
earlier this week and said: We don’t 
want Big Government, and we don’t 
want this creeping socialism that we 
are seeing. 
Yet, the response of this House was 
to double down on that and jam 
through this massive bill. 
This bill, we are told, is a messaging 
bill for House Democrats. I will say the 
Senate is going to rewrite it. I submit 
you will not like what the Senate re-
writes and sends back to you. But I will 
tell you this: You will not have the op-
portunity to change anything. Once it 
comes back from the Senate, it will be 
a straight up-or-down vote. You will 
not be able to change one syllable of 
your bill, and it will become law with 
whatever the Senate puts in it. 
There is nothing here but a partisan 
social spending scam that is meant to 
bolster Democrat prospects. Unfortu-
nately, your prospects really took a hit 
last Tuesday night. 
This bill will fundamentally change 
life in America for every citizen, and 
not in a good way. The magnitude of 
the changes contemplated in this mas-
sive reconciliation bill should require 
the full input of Congress. 
This should call on us and our var-
ious 
generations 
to 
be 
trans-
formational. Instead, we have watched 
all afternoon while we are mired in the 
transactional. You can’t be trans-
formational if you are mired in the 
transactional. 
Madam Speaker, vote against this 
rule, vote against this bill, and vote 
against the infrastructure bill. Let’s do 
the right thing for the people. 
I yield back the balance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are again reminded to address 
their remarks to the Chair. 
b 2200 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I don’t know what 
my Republican friends find so offensive 
about making historic investments in 
healthcare and family care and com-
bating climate change. Maybe we just 
have different values. Maybe they are 
just angry that we are investing not in 
the wealthy as they did, not in large 
corporations as they did, but in our 
workers, and in the middle-class fami-
lies all across the Nation. 
I am proud that we are finally allow-
ing drug prices to be negotiated, proud 
that we are establishing universal free 
pre-K. I am proud that we are making 
the biggest expansion in healthcare 
coverage in a decade; proud that we are 
making the most transformative in-
vestments in caregiving in American 
history; and I am proud that we are 
making the biggest investments to 
combat climate change ever. 
I didn’t run for office to help the well 
connected or just to hold the title. I 
came here to actually get something 
done for workers, for students, and for 
the next generation so we are not sad-
dling them with a planet whose climate 
is out of control. I ran for office to pass 
big, bold, transformative legislation 
like this. 
This is the agenda the American peo-
ple voted for in November. They de-
manded a clean break from the Repub-
licans. They entrusted a Democratic 
Congress and a Democratic White 
House to use their power to change 
people’s lives for the better. Today, we 
are delivering. 
I know it took a while to get to this 
point, some ups and downs, and I know 
this isn’t everybody’s idea of a great 
and wonderful and fun Friday night, 
but it is testament to this President, 
to the Speaker, and to the Democrats 
on both sides of the Capitol. 
We are on the doorstep of delivering 
once-in-a-generation legislation that 
builds on the New Deal and the promise 
that President Roosevelt made over 80 
years ago. I urge all of my colleagues 
to seize this chance to vote for this 
rule and the underlying legislation so 
that the American people can truly 
have a fair shot in the 21st century. 
The system, as it exists, is still 
rigged against workers, against too 
many families, against too many who 
are struggling in our country. Let us 
change that reality. Let us pass the in-
frastructure bill, the BIF bill, and then 
let us pass the Build Back Better bill 
and let’s transform this country for the 
better. I am proud to be here today to 
advocate for this legislation. 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I ran for Congress to help people. To 
help people in Chicago, in Illinois and across 
the country achieve the American dream. The 
Build Back Better Act represents a trans-
formative investment in children, families, 
workers, businesses, and the planet that will 
improve health and well-being, advance eco-
nomic and environmental justice, meaningfully 
address climate change, and grow our econ-
omy while asking the wealthiest and most se-
cure to pay their fair share. 
The pandemic has harmed tens of millions 
of Americans—disproportionately hurting Afri-
can Americans and other communities of 
color, women, seniors, and children. This leg-
islation directly and profoundly helps individ-
uals, communities, and businesses build back 
better by meeting immediate needs for food, 
shelter, medical care, and child care as well 
as long-term needs for quality education, 
good-paying jobs, safe roads and water, and 
a healthy environment. 
I am deeply proud that many priorities that 
I have championed are included in this historic 
bill. 
It provides 4 weeks of paid family and med-
ical leave for workers so that they do not face 
the inhumane choice of caring for loved ones 
or financial ruin. As Chair of the Subcommittee 
with jurisdiction over paid leave, I have worked 
closely with Ways and Means Chairman Neal 
and advocates to shape this amazing, equity- 
generating, universal benefit. Lower-income 
workers and workers of color are much less 
likely to have any paid leave, yet are more 
likely to need paid leave due to greater health 
challenges and less savings to weather 
caregiving without pay. Paid leave strengthens 
workers, families, and businesses, and I will 
continue to fight to enact this provision into 
law. 
The bill enhances the Earned Income Tax 
Credit to improve the economic well-being and 
increase the labor-force participation of mil-
lions childless workers and noncustodial par-
ents—with special improvements to assist 
younger workers, foster and homeless youth, 
and seniors. This provision is expected to help 
17 adults nationwide and over 600,000 in Illi-
nois. I’ve fought for these improvements since 
the early 2000s as part of my Responsible Fa-
therhood Act. 
It provides $2 billion to train workers with 
barriers to employment—including people with 
records—for careers in the allied health pro-
fessions, simultaneously connecting people to 
the labor force and addressing health profes-
sion shortages. This success will help Chicago 
State which has a stellar Health Profession 
Opportunity Grant program and expand pro-
grams like those offered by the Safer Founda-
tion and Johns Hopkins to help people with 
records become successful healthcare profes-
sionals. 
It helps vulnerable students by making Pell 
non-taxable and removing the lifetime ban on 
the American Opportunity Tax Credit for past 
felony convictions. 
It incents substantial private investment in 
solar energy that will put money in the pockets

of millions of low-income individuals by reduc-
ing electricity costs while making the air they 
breathe safer. 
It contains strong labor provisions so that 
our investments in green energy benefit work-
ers as well as businesses. 
It includes $1 billion for to help justice-in-
volved adults and youth to obtain employment 
and training services via the Reentry Employ-
ment Opportunities Program. It makes sure 
that people leaving prison have Medicaid cov-
erage to improve health and successful re-
entry. 
It includes $2.5 billion for public health ap-
proaches to reduce community violence and 
trauma interventions. I have championed 
these interventions with Senator DURBIN in our 
RISE from Trauma Act. 
It helps restore fairness to the tax code by 
rolling back the Republicans’ punitive limit on 
the State and Local Tax deduction to hurt citi-
zens and public employees in blue states like 
Illinois. 
The Build Back Better Act dramatically re-
duces child poverty via a substantial Child Tax 
Credit for 2022 coupled with making the credit 
refundable permanently, raising a projected 
4.1 million children above the poverty line and 
cutting child poverty by more than 40 percent. 
In October alone, the advanced CTC gave 
caregivers in my Congressional District over 
$30 million to provide food, shelter, and other 
necessities for 121,000 children. 
It makes Americans healthier via substantial 
tax credits to cover health insurance, coverage 
for millions of people excluded from the ACA 
because their states failed to expand Med-
icaid, $1 billion for community health centers, 
Medicaid coverage for women after giving 
birth, tremendous funding to reduce health in-
equities, Medicare hearing coverage, and re-
duced medication costs. African Americans’ 
risk for diabetes is 77 percent higher than that 
for non-Hispanic white Americans. This bill 
limits the co-pay for insulin to $35, which will 
help so many people I know. 
The bill addresses racial and economic in-
equities for communities of color and rural and 
underserved communities. 
It makes the largest investment in child care 
in our nation’s history, saving most families 
more than half of their spending on child care. 
Child care is a fundamental component so that 
our economy and families can recover. Fur-
ther, it makes historic investments to care for 
seniors and individuals with disabilities so that 
they can receive care in their homes and com-
munities, recognizing the need to care for our 
aging population. 
It makes the largest expansion of free edu-
cation since our country established public 
high schools a century ago. It provides uni-
versal and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year- 
olds, promoting racial equity in education. In 
addition, it expands access to affordable high-
er education by increasing the Pell grants by 
$550 for more than 5 million students, creating 
grants to close the college completion gap, 
and investing in Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities and Minority Serving Institu-
tions, including Predominantly Black Institu-
tions like Malcolm X, Olive-Harvey, and Chi-
cago State. 
It makes the largest investment in affordable 
housing and community development in half a 
century. It addresses the housing crisis with 
$25 billion for rental assistance, $65 billion for 
public housing, $15 billion to build or improve 
affordable homes, and another $40 billion for 
critical housing initiatives. The pandemic has 
hit Black renters with children especially hard, 
with 29 percent—or an estimated 1.7 million 
renters—reporting that their household is not 
caught up on rent. 
It feeds the hungry with $10 billion for nutri-
tion, including expanding free school and sum-
mer meals. In 2020, Black and Latino families 
with children were more than twice as likely to 
suffer food insecurity as white households. 
Hunger has no place in the United States. 
This bill invests billions in small businesses, 
including $1.6 billion for minority owned busi-
ness and $105 million for education and finan-
cial assistance for the formerly incarcerated to 
form businesses to create jobs in their com-
munities. It invests over $3 billion in capital ac-
cess for small employers and entrepreneurs. 
The SBA lending programs have been lifelines 
to local businesses during the pandemic and 
these funds will help businesses build back 
better post pandemic. 
This legislation ensures the largest effort 
combat climate change in American history by: 
putting money back in people’s pockets as 
they shift to clean energy; promoting the man-
ufacturing of clean energy technology in the 
US, creating hundreds of thousands of good- 
paying jobs; and advancing environmental jus-
tice to deliver benefits to disadvantaged com-
munities. 
I am honored to vote for this once-in-a-gen-
eration legislation. I came to Congress to 
make this type of momentous change to make 
life better for tens of millions of people. I urge 
my colleagues to pass it. 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
support of this historic legislation and the re-
lated Rule to propel American progress. The 
infrastructure bill along with the Build Back 
Better Act will usher in a transformational 21st 
century for the American people. Rebuilding 
our nation’s infrastructure will create millions 
of living wage jobs for the American people 
coast to coast. It will add value through work 
in every state, hamlet, district and territory of 
our nation. 
This measure rewards work in every sec-
tor—in both hardware and software. The 
motor vehicle industry, new carbon free en-
ergy systems, modern highways, airports, 
bridges, 
ports, 
rail 
grade 
separations, 
broadband, and so much more. These bills 
strengthen America’s families and commu-
nities by relieving economic burdens that have 
held them back. It allows millions of Ameri-
cans to access affordable health insurance 
and medications, child and elder care, and ro-
bust education and workforce training to meet 
new horizons in this new era. 
Major investments in education and health 
care for our children and seniors have been 
long overdue. And, the environmental provi-
sions to heal our earth in an era of climate 
change will restore clean water, clean air, 
healthy forests, and regenerative soils. 
Please let me thank all the Committees and 
Members who have worked so very hard on 
this measure. The cost of the related bills is 
paid for and, as more jobs are created, and 
the overall wealth of our nation increases, not 
only the annual deficit but also the accumu-
lated national debt will begin to be repaid. By 
passing these bills, this Chamber meets its 
obligations to the American people of today 
and tomorrow. Let us pass this transformative 
legislation as a critical step in advancing its 
content to the other body. We acknowledge 
more changes will likely occur as the bill 
moves forward. But tonight, this House em-
braces the future. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary, on Homeland Security, and on the 
Budget, I rise in strong support of the rule 
governing debate, as well as the underlying 
bill, which is the Build Back Better Act (RCP 
117–18, H.R. 5376 ), legislation making vision-
ary and transformative investments to change 
for the better the health, well-being, and finan-
cial security of America’s workers and families. 
Madam Speaker, the federal budget is an 
expression of the nation’s values and the in-
vestments made to Build America Back Better 
are a clear declaration of congressional 
Democrats’ commitment to ensuring that our 
government, our economy, and our systems 
work For The People. 
Madam Speaker, these long-overdue invest-
ments in America’s future will be felt in every 
corner of the country and across every sector 
of American life, building on the success of 
the American Rescue Plan, accommodating 
historic infrastructure investments in the legis-
lative pipeline, and addressing longstanding 
deficits in our communities by ending an era 
of chronic underinvestment so we can emerge 
from our current crises a stronger, more equi-
table nation. 
The Build Back Better Act makes the trans-
formative investments that we need to con-
tinue growing our economy, lower costs for 
working families, and position the United 
States as a global leader in innovation and the 
jobs of the future. 
This $1.75 trillion gross investment will build 
on the successes of the American Rescue 
Plan and set our nation on a path of fiscal re-
sponsibility and broadly shared prosperity for 
generations to come. 
The Build Back Better Act is paid for by en-
suring that the wealthy and big corporations 
are paying their fair share and Americans 
making less than $400,000 a year will not see 
their taxes increase by a penny. 
Let me repeat that: No American making 
less than $400,000 a year will not see their 
taxes increase by a penny. 
In sum, Madam Speaker, the investments 
made by the Build Back Better Act will expand 
opportunity for all and build an economy pow-
ered by shared prosperity and inclusive 
growth. 
During general debate, I will discuss in 
greater detail all of the salutary aspects of the 
Build Back Better Act, but today I will confine 
my remarks to discuss how the legislation 
holds substantial benefits for my home state of 
Texas. 
The Build Back Better Act will bring down 
costs that have held back families in Texas for 
decades by cutting taxes and making child 
care, home care, education, health care, and 
housing more affordable. 
These investments will provide new learning 
opportunities for children, help parents and es-
pecially working parents make ends meet, and 
position the economy for stronger growth for 
years to come. 
The Build Back Better Act will create good- 
paying jobs for residents of Texas, combating 
climate change, giving our kids cleaner air and 
water, and making America the leader in glob-
al innovation and 21st century manufacturing. 
Specifically, Madam Speaker, the Build 
Back Better Act delivers the largest investment

November 5, 2021 
in child care and early education in history by 
providing access to affordable child care. 
Child care is a major strain for families in 
Texas, where the average annual cost of a 
child care center for a toddler is $9,428, 
meaning that a Texas family with two young 
children would on average spend 21 percent 
of their income on child care for one year. 
The lack of affordable options also makes it 
difficult for parents, and especially mothers, to 
remain in their jobs, contributing to the 26.1 
percent gender gap in workforce participation 
between mothers and fathers in Texas. 
The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas 
to provide access to child care for 2,011,503 
young children (ages 0–5) per year from fami-
lies earning under 2.5 times the Texas median 
income (about $205,204 for a family of 4), and 
ensure these families pay no more than 7 per-
cent of their income on high-quality child care. 
The Build Back Better Act will provide uni-
versal, high-quality, free preschool for every 3- 
and 4-year-old in America. 
In contrast, today, only 24 percent of the 
775,102 3- and 4-year-olds in Texas have ac-
cess to publicly-funded preschool, and it costs 
about $8,600 per year for those who cannot 
access a publicly-funded program. 
The Build Back Better Act will enable Texas 
to expand access to free, high-quality pre-
school to more than 588,286 additional 3- and 
4-year-olds per year and increase the quality 
of preschool for children who are already en-
rolled. 
Parents will be able to send their children to 
the preschool setting of their choice—from 
public schools to child care providers to Head 
Start—leading to lifelong educational benefits, 
allowing more parents to go back to work, and 
building a stronger foundation for Texas’s fu-
ture economic competitiveness. 
The Build Back Better Act cuts taxes and 
reduces some of the largest expenses for 
workers and families, like education, health 
care, and housing. 
Madam Speaker, the average cost of a 2- 
year degree in Texas is $2,885 per year, and 
$11,096 per year for a 4-year degree, strain-
ing many student budgets. 
To help unlock the opportunities of an edu-
cation beyond high school, the Build Back Bet-
ter Act will increase maximum Pell Grant 
awards by $550 for students at public and pri-
vate non-profit institutions, supporting the 
486,377 students in Texas who rely on Pell 
grants. 
The Build Back Better Act will also invest in 
Texas’s 112 minority-serving institutions and 
the students they serve, including Historically 
Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), 
Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and 
Hispanic-serving institutions (HSIs). 
Madam Speaker, of the world’s biggest 
economies, the United States is second to last 
in investing in workforce development, and 
funding for federal job training programs has 
dropped by almost half since 2001. 
The Build Back Better Act invests in training 
programs that will prepare Texas’s workers for 
high-quality jobs in fast-growing sectors like 
public health, child care, manufacturing, IT, 
and clean energy. Fifty-nine public community 
colleges in Texas will have the opportunity to 
benefit from grants to develop and deliver in-
novative training programs and expand proven 
ones. 
Madam Speaker, 18 percent of children in 
Texas live in food insecure households, harm-
ing their long-term health and ability to suc-
ceed in school. 
The Build Back Better Act will ensure that 
the nutritional needs of Texas’s children are 
met by expanding access to free school meals 
to an additional 1,642,000 students during the 
school year and providing 3,631,226 students 
with resources to purchase food over the sum-
mer. 
When it comes to housing costs, more than 
1.7 million renters in Texas are rent burdened, 
meaning they spend more than 30 percent of 
their income on rent, while homeownership re-
mains out of reach for many families. 
The Build Back Better Act expands rental 
assistance for Texas renters, while also in-
creasing the supply of high-quality housing 
through the construction and rehabilitation of 
over 1 million affordable housing units nation-
wide. 
The Build Back Better Act addresses the 
capital needs of the entire public housing 
stock in America, and it includes one of the 
largest investments in down payment assist-
ance in history, enabling more first-generation 
homebuyers to purchase their first home. 
Madam Speaker, access to affordable qual-
ity health care should be a right, not a privi-
lege, and residents of Texas facing illness 
should never have to worry about how they 
are going to pay for treatment. 
The Build Back Better Act will close the 
Medicaid coverage gap to help millions of 
Americans gain health insurance, extend 
through 2025 the American Rescue Plan’s 
health insurance premium reductions for those 
who buy coverage on their own, and help 
older Americans access affordable hearing 
care by expanding Medicare. 
In Texas, that means 1,554,000 uninsured 
people will gain coverage, including the 
771,000 who fell into the Medicaid coverage 
gap, and 1,066,400 will on average save hun-
dreds of dollars per year. 
In addition, the Build Back Better Act will 
support maternal health and invest in national 
preparedness for future pandemics. 
Finally, the Build Back Better Act will ex-
pand access to home- and community-based 
care to more of Texas’s senior citizens and 
disabled citizens and improve the quality and 
wages of caregiving jobs. 
Prior to the pandemic, 15 percent of chil-
dren under the age of 18 in Texas lived in 
poverty. 
The Build Back Better Act will bolster finan-
cial security and spur economic growth in 
Texas by reducing taxes on the middle class 
and those striving to break into it. 
Specifically, the Build Back Better Act ex-
tends Child Tax Credit (CTC) increases of 
$300/month per child under 6 or $250/month 
per child ages 6 to 17, which will continue the 
largest one-year reduction in child poverty in 
history. 
And critically, the agreement includes per-
manent refundability for the Child Tax Credit, 
meaning that the neediest families will con-
tinue to receive the full Child Tax Credit over 
the long-run. 
The Build Back Better Act will also provide 
a tax cut of up to $1,500 in tax cuts for more 
than 1.5 million low-wage workers in Texas by 
extending the American Rescue Plan’s Earned 
Income Tax Credit (EITC) expansion. 
From 2010 to 2020, Texas experienced 67 
extreme weather events, costing up to $200 
billion in damages. 
The Build Back Better Act will set the United 
States on course to meet its climate targets— 
a 50–52 percent reduction in greenhouse gas 
emissions below 2005 levels by 2030—in a 
way that creates good-paying union jobs, 
grows domestic industries, and advances envi-
ronmental justice. 
The Build Back Better Act represents the 
largest ever single investment in a clean en-
ergy economy—across buildings, transpor-
tation, industry, electricity, agriculture, and cli-
mate smart practices in our lands and waters. 
And the Build Back Better Act will create a 
new Civilian Climate Corps that will enlist a di-
verse generation of Texans in conserving our 
public lands, bolstering community resilience, 
and addressing the changing climate, all while 
putting good-paying union jobs within reach. 
In clean energy and in other sectors, the 
Build Back Better Act will also strengthen do-
mestic manufacturing and supply chains for 
critical goods, benefiting American businesses, 
workers, consumers, and communities. 
To put it all in perspective, Madam Speaker, 
we have before us a once in a century oppor-
tunity to make gigantic progress in making 
ours a more perfect union, and to do it in a 
single bound with enactment of the Build Back 
Better Act, the most transformative legislation 
passed by this Congress since the Great Soci-
ety and the New Deal. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all Members to join 
me in voting for the rule and voting to pass 
H.R. 5376, the transformative, life-changing 
Build Back Better Act. 
The material previously referred to 
by Mr. BURGESS is as follows:

lowing:

EXPRESSING 
SOLIDARITY 
WITH 
CUBAN 
CITIZENS 
FOR 
FUNDA-
MENTAL FREEDOMS 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ALBIO SIRES 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be 
an original cosponsor and co-author of House 
Resolution 
760, 
which 
demonstrates 
the 
United States’ firm commitment to standing 
with the Cuban people. 
On July eleventh, we witnessed an awak-
ening in Cuba. It began in San Antonio de los 
Ban˜os, just ten miles from Bejucal, the town 
where I was born, and then spread to over 
sixty towns and cities throughout Cuba. The 
Cuban people rose up and spoke with one 
voice to call for freedom. Cubans risked their 
lives by demonstrating against this repressive 
regime. 
As members of the United States Congress, 
we must make clear that we stand with them. 
Many Cubans have paid a steep price for their 
courage. More than seven hundred people 
were detained or forcibly disappeared in the 
wake of the protests. This regime showed its 
true colors, firing live ammunition into crowds 
and using beatings, arbitrary arrests, and tor-
ture to try to stop people from protesting. It 
blocked internet access to prevent Cubans 
from communicating with each other and with 
the world. But I believe that the Cuban people 
can and will prevail. 
These protests, while historic, did not 
emerge from thin air. For more than sixty 
years, the Cuban people have endured un-
speakable suffering. But as the regime has ex-
panded its repression to go after not just dis-
sidents but also artists and academics and 
bloggers, a new generation of Cubans has 
shown its creativity and bravery. The San 
Isidro movement, which came together in re-
sponse to a decree aimed at censoring artistic 
expression, has unlocked something very 
powerful. By bringing together artists, aca-
demics, and Cubans from all walks of life, the 
leaders of the San Isidro movement have 
shown the power of collective action to strip 
away the veneer that the regime tries to 
present to the world. Underneath the propa-
ganda and the myths, we see a fragile and 
failed dictatorship that can only hold onto 
power through repression, corruption, and cro-
nyism. The brutal treatment of the Associated 
Press journalist Ramon Espinosa showed just 
how desperate this regime is to hide the re-
ality in Cuba from the rest of the world. 
That desperation is the reason why the re-
gime is now prohibiting planned protests for 
November 15th. The regime is threatening 
those who plan to demonstrate that they will 
face severe repercussions, even though they 
are merely asking to express themselves 
peacefully, as is their fundamental right. 
The question before the U.S. Congress is 
whether we will answer the call of the Cuban 
people. Will we acknowledge them and say 
‘‘we see you, we hear you, and we are with 
you’’? I hope the answer is yes. 
As many of my colleagues know, I left Cuba 
at the age of eleven. Ever since then, I have 
never given up hope that one day Cuba would 
become a democracy. I will never stop fighting 
to help the Cuban people become free. 
I thank my good friends, Congresswoman 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ and Congressman DIAZ- 
BALART, for their leadership. And I urge my 
colleagues to support this bipartisan resolu-
tion.

RECOGNIZING DR. KENNETH COO-
PER ON THE OCCASION OF HIS 
90TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize Dr. Kenneth H. Cooper, recog-
nized as the ‘‘Father of Aerobics.’’ Born on 
March 4, 1931 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, 
his desire to practice preventative medicine 
was fostered by his father, who specialized in 
preventative dentistry. He would go on to re-
ceive his Bachelor of Science and Doctor of 
Medicine Degree from the University of Okla-
homa and a Master of Public Health from Har-
vard University School of Public Health. 
Prior to dedicating his life’s work to fitness, 
Dr. Cooper served as a member of the U.S. 
Army and U.S. Air Force as a flight surgeon 
and Director of the Aerospace Medical Lab-
oratory in San Antonio. During his 13 years of 
military service, he developed the Aerobic 
Point System as well as the 12-minute and 
1.5-mile fitness tests used by military organi-
zations, law enforcement agencies, and thou-
sands of public schools and universities today. 
In partnership with NASA, he was likewise an 
integral part of creating the conditioning pro-
grams used to prepare astronauts for space. 
After retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel, Dr. 
Cooper devoted his time to researching car-
diovascular fitness and longevity. In 1970, he 
founded the Cooper Athletic Center in Dallas, 
Texas where he merged research with prac-
tice, revolutionizing health and fitness. The 
Cooper Institute has long been recognized as 
a leader in the fight against childhood obesity, 
partnering with several organizations to estab-
lish fitness programs in schools across the 
world. 
A man of many accolades with years of 
knowledge, it is of little surprise his training 
helped lead the 1970 Brazilian Soccer team to 
victory in the World Cup. 
As a pioneer in preventative medicine, Dr. 
Cooper has received more than 70 awards 
and honors. He has authored 19 books and is 
responsible for the addition of the word ‘‘Aero-
bics’’ in the Oxford English Dictionary. 
While Dr. Cooper’s professional and aca-
demic career has been filled with great 
achievements, it is his family that most in-
spires him. Dr. Cooper and his wife, Millie, 
were blessed with a daughter, Berkley, and a 
son, Tyler. Dr. Cooper and his family set an 
example by actively practicing what they 
preach and working to maintain a healthy life-
style. Dr. Cooper himself successfully com-
pleted his first marathon in 1962 and has 
since logged more than 38,000 miles running. 
Now as we recognize Dr. Kenneth Cooper, 
I ask my colleagues in the House of Rep-
resentatives to join me in honoring his rich life 
and legacy.

HONORING SAN ANTONIO 
VETERAN JESSE VIDALES 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of Mr. Jesse Vidales who 
hails from my hometown of San Antonio, 
Texas. Mr. Vidales celebrated his 100th birth-
day this past August. Born and raised in San 
Antonio’s Westside, Mr. Vidales emulates 
what it means to be a proud San Antonian. I 
am truly honored to recognize him this Vet-
erans Day. 
Mr. Jesse Vidales was born on August 9, 
1921 to Mr. Jose Ramos Vidales and Mrs. 
Maria Rios. At the time, Westside San Antonio 
experienced widespread poverty. Through 
their tireless efforts, the Vidales family rose 
above, knowing that education was the surest 
path to success. During the height of World 
War II, Mr. Vidales enlisted in the U.S. Army 
Air Corp where he served with Army Intel-
ligence until the end of the war. After, Mr. 
Vidales married the love of his life, Mrs. Vic-
toria Perez Vidales, and followed in his fa-
ther’s architectural footsteps and became a 
successful contractor for more than 50 years. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in com-
memorating the life of Mr. Jesse Vidales. I 
wish Jesse a happy 100th birthday and Happy 
Veterans Day. He has reached a milestone, 
and I thank him for his service to our country 
and community. May God bless and watch 
over him.

He is from my hometown of Victoria, Texas. I

want to thank him for his service in the United 
States Army Air Corps as a Radio Operator 
and Nose Gunner on the B–24 bomber in the 
451st Bomb Group, 726th Squadron. 
During WWII on July 14, 1944, he and his 
fellow airman traveled to Petfurdo, Hungary for 
their 29th combat mission. They expected it to 
be an easy mission but began receiving anti- 
aircraft fire that took out two of the aircraft’s 
engines. From the nose gunner position, he 
received word that they were dropping ele-
vation very quickly. The pilot made the call, 
urging everyone to jump. Mr. Longenecker 
headed to the flight deck to retrieve his para-
chute. On the flight deck, he saw his ball gun-
ner about to jump and gave him a ‘‘good luck’’ 
salute. Then Mr. Longenecker jumped. 
Everyone who jumped before him was cap-
tured but he landed on top of a hill and began 
taking on heavy fire from Yugoslav soldiers 
that were sympathetic to the Germans. He 
made his way to a nearby forest line, crawled 
under a briar bush, and stayed under the bush 
until nightfall. The first night he slept near a 
lake. The second night he stayed in a pile of 
loose hay, where he could hear a group of 
people playing the guitar and singing. To him, 
this was one of the most beautiful sounds he 
had heard simply because there wasn’t a sign 
of war anywhere. On the third day, he ran out 
of the wood cover and met a young boy. This 
boy took him to a nearby village where he ate, 
bathed, and rested. Later, Mr. Longenecker 
was taken to a house where an American 
Lieutenant was waiting. Upon his safe arrival, 
he was informed that he had walked through 
an active minefield, unscathed. 
It is incredible to think of how a life that 
could have been cut short has lasted 100 
years. After serving in the military, Ed 
Longenecker became an electrical engineer 
and lived a long full life, married to his wife 
Marie for 59 years until she passed away in 
2006. He has 2 daughters, 5 grandchildren, 
and 3 great-grandchildren. 
Edward Longenecker is a true American 
hero, and we are indebted to him for his great 
service to our Nation. I am proud to honor him 
today, and I hope he has a wonderful 100th 
birthday.

HONORING THE LIFE OF EDWARD 
COLSTON NEWTON IV 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, it is with 
deep sadness but great respect that I take this 
time to remember Edward Colston Newton IV 
of Warsaw, Virginia, who passed away on No-
vember 3, 2021. ‘‘Colston’’ to his loved ones, 
he was a man not only known for his love of 
family and their farm, but for the Common-
wealth of Virginia and the United States. 
Colston was born in Louisville, Kentucky to 
Edward 
Colston 
Newton 
III 
and 
Janet 
Daingerfield Van Winkle. He was a graduate 
of Warwick High School, the College of Wil-
liam & Mary, and the Marshall Wythe School 
of Law, joining the Army Judge Advocate 
Corps upon his graduation. Most notably, 
Colston was part of the prosecution of the Mai 
Lai Massacre in Vietnam. Following his re-
lease from the Army, he went on to serve as 
counsel with the Office of Management and 
Budget (OMB) during the Ford and Carter Ad-
ministrations. 
After Colston’s service with the OMB, he 
went on to a private practice, then became a 
private practitioner, and later, a Common-
wealth’s Attorney for Westmoreland County. 
Once he no longer practiced law, Colston be-
came a freelance journalist, winning various 
awards for his distinct and strong writing style. 
Colston had a passion for fly fishing and 
nurtured his children and nephews’ enjoyment 
of the pastime. His love for the scenic beauty 
of Virginia was second to his love for family. 
Colston is survived by his sisters Lawrence 
‘‘Ludie’’ 
Newton 
Stevens, 
Elizabeth 
Daingerfield Newton Beam, and Mary Dillon 
Suiers, his son John Tyler Newton (Shannon), 
his daughter Cynthia Macomber Newton, his 
companion Jayne McQuarde, 7 grandchildren, 
and many nieces and nephews. He is pre-
ceded in death by his son Edward Colston 
Newton V, who served in the U.S. Army with 
the Asymmetric Warfare Group, and lost his 
battle to cancer on July 11, 2018. 
Madam Speaker, I ask you to join me and 
countless others as we recognize the life of 
Edward Colston Newton.

Mr. VARGAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Mrs. Aurora Soriano Cudal-Rivera of 
the National Federation of Filipino American 
Associations (NaFFAA), San Diego and Impe-
rial Region. Mrs. Cudal-Rivera has served this

her long years of service as an inductee to the 
San Diego County Women’s Hall of Fame in 
2013 and California Legislature Woman of the 
Year in both 1999 and 2016. 
During her professional career in the Phil-
ippines, Mrs. Cudal-Rivera served in public 
health education in both government and non- 
government institutions for 40 years. She was 
the first woman from Asia to receive a 
UNESCO Fellowship on ‘‘Problems Related to 
the Use of Drugs,’’ which granted her a four- 
month travel to Denmark, Netherlands, France 
and Switzerland. She has volunteered for the 
United Methodist Church, and was elected as 
the World Secretary of the World Federation 
of Methodist Women at the International As-
sembly of Methodist Women in 1991. 
Mrs. Cudal-Rivera came to retire in Chula 
Vista, California in 1992. Now an octoge-
narian, she is still active with NaFFAA, Council 
of Philippine American Associations of San 
Diego County, San Diego Executive Lions 
Club, Filipino American Women’s Club, Com-
mittee on Social Responsibility of the Commu-
nity Congregational Church of Chula Vista,

sociation, an independent living facility where 
she currently resides. 
Mrs. Cudal-Rivera is to be honored for all 
her service to the community, her church, and 
her mentorship to the younger generation— 
making a positive and long-lasting difference.

CELEBRATING THE 60TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE DELAWARE RIVER 
BASIN COMMISSION 
HON. LISA BLUNT ROCHESTER 
OF DELAWARE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Ms. BLUNT ROCHESTER. Madam Speak-
er, I rise to celebrate the anniversary of the 
Delaware River Basin Commission. Sixty 
years ago this month, President John F. Ken-
nedy gathered with the Governors of New Jer-
sey, New York, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, 
as equal partners to sign the Delaware River 
Basin Compact, which created the Delaware 
River Basin Commission. 
For six decades, the Commission has care-
fully balanced the economic and environ-
mental needs of the public, setting a model for 
the nation and the world on how to manage a 
vital, common resource. As we continue to 
battle the impacts of climate change, it is more 
important than ever to work together to main-
tain the health of the Delaware River Basin 
and the communities it serves. 
I congratulate and thank the Delaware River 
Basin Commission for all that they do.

Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. ISSA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
pay tribute to a community leader who is retir-
ing after four decades of service to the people 
of San Diego County. 
Over the last three decades, Barbara Ryan 
has served as Vice President of Government 
Affairs at Rady Children’s Hospital, a Level 1 
Pediatric Trauma Center that is the largest 
children’s hospital in California serving pa-
tients from San Diego, Riverside, and Imperial 
Counties. Rady is a thriving hub of the re-
gion’s healthcare system that employs more 
than 700 physicians, 1,000 nurses, 3,000 em-
ployees, 450 active volunteers and 1,200 aux-
iliary staff. Barbara has been a powerful and 
successful

the most trusted voices regularly sought out 
by local, state, and federal elected officials. 
Prior to joining the Rady team, she worked as 
a senior staff member to a state senator. 
Barbara’s leadership and advocacy extends 
far beyond the industry where she was em-
ployed. Since 1979 she has served as a Mem-
ber of the Board of Education serving the San-
tee School District, where she has held terms 
as President, Vice President, Clerk, and Legis-
lative Representative over the course of her 
tenure. 
She has also been a leader in statewide 
education groups, serving as a delegate to the 
California School Boards Association and as a 
member of its Masters in Governance Faculty, 
service that helped earn her the San Diego 
County School Boards Association School 
Board Member of the Year in 2011. Barbara 
has been recognized with the YWCA Women 
in Business Award; the Santee Chamber of 
Commerce President’s Award; Santee Kiwanis 
Citizen of the Year; California State Assembly 
Woman of the Year; Citizen of the Year from 
Phi Delta Kappa and the Women in Leader-
ship Award from the San Diego East County 
Chamber of Commerce, among many other 
honors. 
But perhaps her greatest honor is being a 
parent and grandparent—and this experience 
has guided every aspect of her career as a 
children’s health advocate, education leader 
and community leader. I am proud to call her 
my friend and am grateful for her decades of 
service 
to 
the 
children, 
families, 
and 
healthcare professionals in San Diego County. 
Rady Children’s is consistently ranked top in 
the nation across many categories, and that 
exceptional leadership is reflected in its com-
munity engagement, professionalism, and ad-
vocacy, demonstrated by Barbara throughout 
her career. 
I ask my colleagues to please join me in ex-
tending our gratitude for her decades of serv-
ice community leadership, and commitment to 
education and healthcare.

REINFORCING 
NICARAGUA’S 
AD-
HERENCE TO CONDITIONS FOR 
ELECTORAL REFORM ACT OF 2021 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ALBIO SIRES 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, November 3, 2021 
Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I would like to ad-
dress S. 1064, the Reinforcing Nicaragua’s 
Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform 
Act of 2021, or the RENACER Act. I intro-
duced the House version of the RENACER 
Act in April with Congresswoman MARIA 
ELVIRA
SALAZAR, Ranking Member of the 
Western Hemisphere Subcommittee MARK 
GREEN, and Reps. DEUTCH, WASSERMAN 
SCHULTZ, MURPHY, and other bipartisan col-
leagues. This bill builds on the Nicaragua In-
vestment Conditionality Act of 2018, or the 
NICA Act, and expands the United States’ 
toolbox to address the challenges to democ-
racy faced in Nicaragua. Congress passed the 
NICA Act in 2018 in the aftermath of Ortega’s 
brutal crackdown of protesters that year. Since 
2018, the Ortega regime’s criminalization of 
dissent has only continued; and since I intro-
duced RENACER in April, the regime arrested 
almost 40 opposition figures, including eight 
possible presidential candidates. 
Daniel Ortega has made it clear that he will 
go to any lengths to maintain power. The 
United States Government must use every 
diplomatic tool available to ensure free, fair, 
and competitive elections in Nicaragua. We 
should implement a results-oriented diplomatic 
strategy, in coordination with our allies, that 
aligns sanctions with specific outcomes. This 
will be the most effective way to counter the 
Ortega regime’s efforts to use repression, per-
secution, and fear to prevent the Nicaraguan 
people from expressing their will at the ballot 
box. 
This legislation would also expand oversight 
of international financial institutions’ lending to 
Nicaragua, to ensure that any funds are help-
ing the Nicaraguan people and not filling the 
coffers of corrupt actors in government. The 
RENACER Act also strengthens protections 
for humanitarian and human rights needs of 
the Nicaraguan people, so that our policies do 
not inadvertently harm the very people we 
seek to help. Finally, the legislation requires a 
number of reports, including on acts of corrup-
tion committed by the Ortega government and 
his family members and on human rights vio-
lations against communities marginalized by 
the regime. 
By passing the RENACER Act, we will send 
a strong message that we stand with the polit-
ical prisoners, their families, and with all Nica-
raguans in defending their right to choose their 
own leaders. We will show unequivocally our 
firm support for the democratic aspirations of 
the Nicaraguan people. I urge my colleagues 
to support this legislation and stand up for the 
Nicaraguan people.

IN RECOGNITION OF NORTHPORT 
HIGH SCHOOL SOCIAL STUDIES 
TEACHER JANIS SCHACHTER 
HON. THOMAS R. SUOZZI

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize Janis Schachter, a dedicated and 
passionate educator at Northport High School. 
Janis Schachter is a leader and innovator in 
the academic discipline of News and Media 
Literacy. As a journalist and Social Studies 
teacher, Janis uses her talent and professional 
knowledge to engage young people in learning 
about the essential role of journalism in pro-
tecting our freedoms, and their shared civic re-
sponsibility to be active and informed partici-
pants in our democracy with civility and mutual 
respect. 
Through her affiliation with the Center for 
News Literacy at Stony Brook University, the 
Law Youth and Citizenship Program of the 
New York State Bar Association, and Project 
PATCH, the Law and Civic Education Program 
of the Northport—East Northport Union Free 
School District, Ms. Schachter has provided 
training in News and Media Literacy to hun-
dreds of teachers in the United States and 
around the world. 
On September 15, 2021, Janis Schachter 
was recognized with a prestigious international 
teaching award by Global Youth & News 
Media which awarded her their Silver Prize for 
excellence and leadership in the field of News 
and Media Literacy. Her excellence as a 
teacher is also evident in her recognition as 
‘‘Distinguished Social Studies Educator’’ by 
the New York State Council for the Social 
Studies. 
I am proud to recognize Janis Schachter for 
her invaluable contribution toward education 
as she continues to empower young people 
and fellow teachers with the knowledge, skills,

HONORING THOMAS JUNIOR 
ROSEBERRY II 
HON. H. MORGAN GRIFFITH 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of Thomas Junior Roseberry II of Bland, 
Virginia, who passed away on October 27, 
2021, at the age of 74. Mr. Roseberry was a 
former Bland County sheriff and Virginia State 
Police trooper who made a tremendous con-
tribution to the area. 
Mr. Roseberry was born on December 18, 
1946, to Thomas J. and Wanda Deck 
Roseberry in Pulaski, Virginia. His life was 
spent helping and defending those around 
him. He started his career with the Virginia 
State Police in 1968. He also worked as the 
Captain of Investigations for the Montgomery 
County Sheriff’s Office and was elected twice 
as Sheriff of Bland County—once in 1988 and 
later in 2015. When he retired in 2019, he had 
cumulatively served and protected his commu-
nity for a total of 51 years. In addition to his 
police service, Mr. Roseberry also served in 
the Army Reserves for 27 years and was a 
member of the American Legion for Bland 
County. 
A man of integrity, Mr. Roseberry helped 
mentor numerous deputies and troopers not 
only in Bland County but all throughout the 
state of Virginia in both their law enforcement 
careers and in their personal lives. He was a 
man of God that led by example. He remains 
highly esteemed by those that know him and 
will be greatly missed. 
Mr. Roseberry was preceded in death by his 
parents and one of his sisters, Carolyn 
Roseberry Elam, as well as her husband ‘‘T’’. 
His survivors include his wife of 55 years, 
Rita T. Roseberry; daughter, Stina R. Wilburn 
and husband Mark; son, Thomas J. Roseberry 
III; daughter, Staci R. Leewright and husband 
Mike; son Seth E. Roseberry and finance´ Jody

FIREFIGHTER AWARDS 
HON. VERN BUCHANAN

Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize fire, rescue and EMS per-
sonnel who have provided distinguished serv-
ice to the people of Florida’s 16th Congres-
sional District. 
First responders, fire departments and 
emergency medical service teams are sum-
moned on short notice to serve their respec-
tive communities. Oftentimes, they arrive at 
scenes of great adversity and trauma, to 
which 
they 
reliably 
bring 
strength 
and 
composure. These brave men and women 
spend hundreds of hours in training so that 
they are prepared when they get ‘‘the call.’’ 
Nine years ago, I established the 16th Dis-
trict Congressional Fire and Rescue and EMS

units for outstanding achievement. 
On behalf of the people of Florida’s 16th 
District, it is my privilege to congratulate the

CELEBRATING KRISTY 
DUBINSKY’S ACHIEVEMENT 
HON. GUY RESCHENTHALER 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. RESCHENTHALER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to recognize Ms. Kristy Dubinsky, who 
selflessly painted portraits for the families of 
the 13 U.S. service members killed in evacu-
ation efforts at the Hamid Karzai International 
Airport on August 26, 2021. 
After learning of the suicide bombing in 
Kabul, Afghanistan on August 26, 2021, Kristy 
Dubinsky immediately knew she needed to 
honor the 13 U.S. service members killed in 
that senseless act. An accomplished artist her-
self, Ms. Dubinsky was already working on an-
other piece for an art show in Michigan. How-
ever, she dropped what she was working on 
to paint a portrait of each service member who 
gave their life that day. 
Ms. Dubinsky, an art teacher at Elizabeth 
Forward High School specializing in military 
themes, said that ‘‘a voice in my head just 
kept telling me to paint the 13.’’ Kristy docu-
mented the entire process. She posted daily 
on her social media platforms for others to fol-
low along. While recording the progress over 
the 13 days, a disabled former Marine, Shelly 
Frontera, saw what Kristy posted and traveled 
from Michigan to honor the 13 soldiers by ac-
companying each painting with a red, white 
bud vase, and blue rose. 
Ms. Dubinsky’s portraits depict 12 of the 13 
in formal dress: Marine Corps Lance Cpl. 
David Espinoza, Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin 
Hoover, Army Staff Sgt. Ryan Knauss, Marine 
Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez, Marine Corps Lance 
Cpl. Rylee McCollum, Marine Corps Lance 
Cpl. Dylan Merola, Marine Corps Lance Cpl. 
Kareem Nikoui, Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny 
Pichardo, Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto San-
chez, Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared Schmitz, 
Navy Hospital Corpsman Maxton Soviak, and 
Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan Page. Marine 
Corps Sgt. Nicole Gee is the only exception. 
Ms. Dubinsky chose to depict the iconic photo 
of her holding an Afghan baby as evacuation 
efforts continued. 
Kristy’s portraits are now part of the world’s 
largest annual juried international art show, 
with 900 artists and thousands of visitors at-
tending.

WORLD SERIES CHAMPIONS— 
ATLANTA BRAVES 
HON. LUCY McBATH 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mrs. MCBATH. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
honor of an event 26 years in the making. 
This week, Georgia, and the entire nation, 
watched as our Atlanta Braves shut out the 
Houston Astros in Game 6, clinching the 
World Series for Atlanta for the first time in 
decades. 
I am so proud of this team. They fought 
through adversity, carrying a losing record 
until August 6th. They overcame injuries and 
fought hard for their teammates whose season 
ended early. Every part of the Atlanta Braves 
organization deserves credit for this win: from 
the players, to the management, and the front 
office staff that still believed in this team when 
so many others might have given up. I am 
thrilled for every player and every fan who has 
dreamed of this moment for over two decades. 
The odds were against us, but to para-
phrase the words of Joc Pederson, ‘‘We just 
might be those World Series Champs.’’

BIOMASS & BIOGAS FOR ELECTRIC 
VEHICLES ACT 
HON. JOHN GARAMENDI 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, today I 
introduce the ‘‘Biomass and Biogas for Electric 
Vehicles Act.’’ 
In passing the Energy Independence and 
Security Act of 2007 (Public Law 110–140), 
Congress made electricity from renewable bio-
mass—including biogas and waste-to-energy 
from feedstocks such as separated yard or 
food waste—eligible under the Renewable 
Fuel Standard (RFS). Despite years of Con-
gressional urging, the U.S. Environmental Pro-
tection Agency (USEPA) has yet to approve a 
single biomass facility under the program. 
Some applications for biomass electricity— 
known as ‘‘pathway petitions’’ under the RFS 
program—have been pending now for more 
than 7 years. 
I have long supported a utility-scale subsidy 
for biomass electricity to create a market for 
byproducts of proper forest management and 
hazardous fuels reduction in fire-prone states 
like California. This legislation fulfills that ob-
jective by working within the framework of the 
existing Renewable Fuel Standard, which al-
ready includes electricity generated from eligi-
ble feedstocks used as a transportation fuel. 
Under current law and USEPA regulations, 
‘‘renewable biomass’’ is already defined to in-
clude biogas, namely methane captured from 
livestock and agricultural byproducts, food 
waste, or residential yard waste. As such, my 
‘‘Biomass and Biogas for Electric Vehicles 
Act’’ would complement the significant invest-
ments California is making under the State’s 
successful Dairy Digester Research and De-
velopment Program. 
Currently, the USEPA requires facilities to 
prove with near-perfect traceability that the 
electricity generated is used as a transpor-
tation fuel to participate in the RFS program. 
Most renewable biomass facilities are selling 
electricity into the grid and, therefore, cannot

prove definitively that each electron generated 
is used exclusively by electric vehicles. 
The ‘‘Biomass and Biogas for Electric Vehi-
cles Act’’ would enable biomass facilities gen-
erating renewable electricity to finally partici-
pate in the RFS program. Instead of requiring 
that biomass facilities meet the impossible 
task of proving that the electricity generated 
and sold into the grid is used directly as a 
transportation fuel, my legislation directs the 
USEPA to extrapolate the percentage of total 
U.S. electricity generation used for charging 
electric vehicles. The USEPA would then set 
a quarterly quota for each biomass facility reg-
istered under the RFS program, limited by 
each facility’s maximum design capacity and 
the amount of electricity generated. 
I recognize that some biomass and biogas 
facilities, specifically those with on-site electric 
vehicle charging stations, can meet the 
USEPA’s current traceability requirement. That 
is why my legislation would grandfather any 
facilities with a written contract or affidavit ac-
cepted by USEPA demonstrating that the elec-
tricity generated is used as transportation fuel. 
My legislation would also authorize USEPA 
to collect a reasonable fee from industry to 
cover the costs of reviewing any applications 
(pathway petitions or facility registration re-
quests) for renewable electricity submitted 
under the RFS program. In a 2016 ‘‘advance 
notice of proposed rulemaking,’’ the USEPA 
cited inadequate agency resources as a major 
impediment to approval of renewable elec-
tricity under the RFS program. The USEPA 
could waive these application fees for munici-
pally owned biomass or biogas facilities under 
my bill. This fee-for-service model is based on 
the USEPA’s regulatory regime under the Pes-
ticide Registration Improvement Act of 2003 
(title V of Public Law 108–199), which is wide-
ly regarded as successful and enjoys broad- 
based support in Congress. 
Lastly, my legislation would make biomass 
removed from federal forestlands eligible 
under the RFS. Current law only allows bio-
mass collected from non-federal lands, includ-
ing privately owned land, state or locally 
owned public lands, and tribal land held in 
trust by the federal government, to qualify as 
renewable biomass under the RFS. This re-
striction is arbitrary and hampers market-driv-
en incentives to reduce the overload of haz-
ardous fuels for wildfires on our National For-
ests and other federal forestlands. However, I 
want to be clear that my legislation would not 
open federal forestland to timber harvests or 
commercial hazardous fuels removal where 
such activities are prohibited currently. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all members to co-
sponsor the ‘‘Biomass and Biogas for Electric 
Vehicles Act.’’ As California and other western 
states face increasingly severe and year-round 
fire seasons due to global climate change, we 
simply must create a market for forest byprod-
ucts to incentivize much-needed hazardous 
fuels reduction. Renewable electricity from bio-
mass and biogas also helps to reduce our na-
tion’s greenhouse gas emissions and to transi-
tion to a clean energy economy. While these 
measures alone will not solve the climate cri-
sis or prevent all catastrophic wildfires, they 
are undoubtedly part of the solution. 
CONGRATULATING REV. DR. BEN-
JAMIN THOMAS, SR. ON HIS 30TH 
PASTORAL ANNIVERSARY 
HON. RUBEN GALLEGO 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. GALLEGO. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate Reverend Dr. Benjamin N. 
Thomas Sr., who recently celebrated his 30th 
Pastoral Anniversary at the Historic Tanner 
Chapel AME Church, the oldest African Amer-
ican church in Arizona. 
Reverend Thomas first came to Tanner 
Chapel in October 1991 and since then has 
been dedicated to serving not only his church, 
but the whole Phoenix community. He has 
served on the boards of several organizations, 
including as Commissioner of the Arizona 
Commission 
on 
African-American 
Affairs, 
member of the Arizona Department of Eco-
nomic Security Board of Directors, and Presi-
dent of the Arizona Ecumenical Council of 
Churches. In 2001, he founded Tanner Com-
munity Development Corporation to help fami-
lies meet their spiritual, economic, educational, 
health, and housing needs. Prior to coming to 
Phoenix, he served as the pastor of AME 
churches in Los Angeles, California; Seattle, 
Washington; and Joplin, Missouri. A dedicated 
family man, Reverend Thomas is husband to 
Beverly Thomas, father to Rev. Benjamin 
Thomas Jr., and a proud grandfather. 
Reverend Thomas has been a role model to 
so many throughout the years. Although he 
has had opportunities to pastor elsewhere or 
to move up within church leadership, he has 
remained dedicated to Tanner Chapel and the 
Phoenix Community. I would like to congratu-
late Reverend Thomas on 30 years of 
pastoring at Tanner Chapel, thank him for his 
decades of service to the Phoenix community, 
and wish him the best as he continues his 
journey with members of the Historic Tanner 
Chapel AME Church.

HONORING THE LIFE AND SERVICE 
OF WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ MOUSER 
HON. JACK BERGMAN 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. BERGMAN. Madam Speaker, it is my 
honor to recognize the life of William ‘‘Bill’’ 
Mouser, who passed away recently after a life-
time of service to his fellow Michiganders. 
Through his constant dedication, tenacity, and 
leadership, Bill became an essential part of 
the Northern Michigan community. 
William Mouser was born in Hastings, Michi-
gan, on September 10, 1950, and graduated 
from Lake Wood High School in Lake Odessa 
in 1968. He furthered his education at Lansing 
Community College where he met his future 
wife, Shirley Jean Peters, who he married in 
1972. With a drive to serve his local commu-
nity, Bill spent much of his retirement as a 
part-time facilities manager in Garfield Town-
ship and served on numerous local boards in-
cluding the Grand Traverse County Road 
Commission, the Green Lake Township Plan-
ning and Zoning Committee, and the Grand 
Traverse County Parks and Recreation Com-
mission. Bill’s passing is a significant loss to 
our community, and he is missed dearly by his 
family and friends. Mr. Mouser’s tireless devo-
tion to the public good touched the lives of 
many Michiganders, and the impact of his 
work cannot be overstated. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of Michigan’s 
First Congressional District, I ask you to join 
me in honoring the life of William ‘‘Bill’’ Mous-
er. He will be forever remembered for the 
many lives he bettered throughout his life.

ATLANTA BRAVES WORLD SERIES 
WIN 
HON. AUSTIN SCOTT 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to recognize and cele-
brate the Atlanta Braves for winning the 2021 
World Series. 
It’s been 26 years since ‘‘America’s Team’’ 
clinched a World Series. I remember the stars 
of 
that 
1995 
World 
Series 
team—Tom 
Glavine, John Smoltz, Chipper Jones, and 
Greg Maddux, just to name a few. Just like 
that World Series lives in the minds of many, 
the 2021 World Series against the Houston 
Astros will hold a special place in the minds of 
baseball fans across our state—and all 
throughout Braves country—for years to come. 
Despite Atlanta having the All-Star Game 
taken away in July and not having the chance 
to honor the late, great Hank Aaron on a na-
tional stage, the Braves found a way to bring 
the Fall Classic back to Georgia and pay trib-
ute to Hank—and fittingly clinched the series 
in the 44th week of the year. 
This team fought the entire season—despite 
having as low as a 0.3 percent chance to win 
the World Series back in mid-July and not 
having a winning record until August 6th. They 
overcame a tremendous number of obstacles 
to bring the trophy back to the Peach State. 
They have made Georgia very proud, and I 
look forward to them defending their title next 
year. 
Chop On and Go Braves.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — Extensions of Remarks
E1208 
November 5, 2021 
Born in 1920, McKinley would lose his father 
as an infant. Determined to succeed at a 
young age, Dean took a typing and shorthand 
course, which would set the stage for his fu-
ture career. 
Following his graduation from high school in 
1937, Dean would make the decision to sign 
up for the Selected Service. However, due to 
asthma, Dean was unable to pass the physical 
exam, excluding him from the draft. Yet, his 
condition did not deter him from serving his 
country. After undergoing chiropractic treat-
ments, Dean’s asthma was alleviated, allowing 
him to apply for the Marine Corps in Decem-
ber of 1942—the day after the attack on Pearl 
Harbor. 
While stationed in San Diego prior to his 
unit shipping out to Japan, Dean would take 
on the role of court reporter for the Board of 
Inquiry after the tragic suicide of a fellow Ma-
rine Officer. The typing and shorthand course 
taken in his youth unexpectedly proved to be 
useful as Dean was the only one in his unit 
able to write shorthand. When presented with 
Dean’s work, the General promoted him on 
the spot. In as little as two years, Dean would 
earn promotions to the ranks of Senior Tech, 
Master Sergeant, and Aviation West Coast 
which was an unheard of upward-mobility. Im-
pressively, Dean would go on to serve as the 
General’s Stenographer and Secretary. 
After contracting malaria while stationed in 
New Zealand, Dean was discharged from the 
Marines and returned to the States where he 
would many his wife, Marvel. Dean and Mar-
vel have been married for over 77 years and 
can still be found playing bridge together 
every week. 
Following his time in the military, Dean 
would begin his career as a chiropractor, de-
voting 43 years of his life to the very practice 
that provided him the opportunity to serve his 
country. 
Now as we recognize Dean McKinley, I ask 
my colleagues in the House of Representa-
tives to join me in honoring his sacrifice and 
service.

HONORING THE CAREER OF CHIEF 
BRETT MAHONEY 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor the outstanding, distinguished 
career of Police Chief Brett Mahoney of Wa-
terford, Connecticut. After more than 26 years 
of diligent service to the town of Waterford, 
Chief Mahoney ‘‘pulled the pin’’ and retired on 
October 29, 2021. He was sent off at a well- 
attended retirement ceremony where the de-
partment and town officials took the oppor-
tunity in heartfelt remarks to remember Chief 
Mahoney just as he is: a highly talented, 
good-natured community member and a dedi-
cated public servant. 
As a native of nearby Westbrook, Con-
necticut, Brett steered his drive and focus to-
ward bettering Connecticut from an early age. 
He placed high value in obtaining an edu-
cation, graduating with a bachelor’s in English 
Literature from Central Connecticut State Uni-
versity. Upon obtaining his first degree, Brett 
eagerly began his work in Connecticut law en-
forcement with a brief stint at the East Hamp-
ton Police Department before starting his 
nearly three-decade-long journey with Water-
ford Police in 1995. In his first few years as a 
Waterford patrol officer, Brett distinguished 
himself within the department by dutifully serv-
ing on task forces with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation as well as the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, and Firearms. His valuable contribu-
tions to the force were rightfully recognized by 
the department as he rose through the ranks 
to Sergeant in 1999 and then to Lieutenant in 
2005. During his time as Lieutenant, Brett 
committed himself to advancing his law en-
forcement education, graduating from the FBI 
National Academy in 2012 and returning to 
Central Connecticut to earn a master’s degree 
in Criminal Justice. His work with the FBI is 
something I particularly appreciate, since my 
father Robert Courtney who spent his retire-
ment years in Waterford served in the FBI dur-
ing World War II in its Manhattan office. 
In October 2015, Lieutenant Mahoney was 
promoted to Waterford’s Chief of Police. It was 
not just his accomplished background that pro-
duced this promotion, but also his obvious 
leadership qualities. As Chief, Brett led the de-
partment with compassion for his community 
and commitment to ensure the department’s 
success by modernizing and enhancing its 
members’ 
capabilities. 
Chief 
Mahoney 
strengthened community engagement by inte-
grating 21st technology into the town and de-
partment. During his time as Chief, Brett be-
came chairman of the town’s Information 
Technology Committee and oversaw the de-
partment-wide rollout of body cameras for all 
Waterford officers, building upon an already 
existent brand of transparency with the com-
munity. 
Brett’s transformational leadership extended 
far beyond the department. Chief Mahoney uti-
lized the department as a stalwart supporter in 
community outreach efforts like the Waterford 
Youth and Family Services 2020 Turkey Drive 
and breast cancer fundraisers for Waterford- 
led foundations. Chief Mahoney also initiated 
one of the first-of-its-kind programs in Con-
necticut, where Waterford officers were trained 
to connect and interact with community mem-
bers diagnosed with cognitive impairments so 
that they had greater sensitivity and aware-
ness with the town’s more vulnerable popu-
lation. Through this new program, first re-
sponders have honed their emergency re-
sponse tactics and gained a refined under-
standing of the needs of their fellow commu-
nity members. Chief Mahoney’s emphasis on 
positive departmental and community change 
coupled with his genuine compassion for Wa-
terford has undoubtedly left the town and the 
police department in a stronger, better position 
than it was 26 years ago. 
Madam Speaker, as the representative for 
the town of Waterford, Connecticut I can firmly 
state that it is constituents like Brett Mahoney 
whose dedication to their community rep-
resents the best of Eastern Connecticut’s spir-
it. Even though he is stepping away from the 
department, Chief Mahoney has affirmed that 
his heart will always lay with the Town of Wa-
terford and that he will continue to support the 
local department any way he can as a resi-
dent. Now that he has positioned the depart-
ment for greater success along with the help 
of his colleagues, Brett will embark on a new 
chapter with his family—his wife, Michelle, and 
two daughters Marin and Clara—as deputy 
chief of police with the University of New 
Haven. To that end, I ask my colleagues in 
the House to join me in honoring and thanking 
Waterford Police Chief Brett Mahoney for his 
exemplary service and to wish the Mahoney 
family all the best on their new path in life.

OF 
THE 
2021 
DEARBORN, MICHIGAN VETERAN 
OF THE YEAR STEPHEN FLETCH-
ER 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Stephen Fletcher of Dear-
born Heights, Michigan on the occasion of 
being named Veteran of the Year by the Dear-
born Allied War Veterans Council. His con-
tributions to our community and to our nation 
are worthy of commendation. 
Raised in Michigan, Mr. Fletcher’s interest in 
serving his country was sparked by his fam-
ily’s legacy of service. His great-grandfather 
served during World War I, his father served 
in the Army Air Corps during World War II, 
and his older brother served in the Army and 
Marines. In high school, he decided to take 
courses with the Navy Junior Reserve Officers 
Training Corps. 
Following graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. 
Marine Corps, and went to boot camp at Ma-
rine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, then 
military occupational specialty training at Ma-
rine Corps Base Quantico, where he grad-
uated top of his class. He served overseas in 
Okinawa, Japan and at Marine Corps Base 
Camp Lejeune, retiring from the Marines at 
the rank of corporal. He served from 1981 to 
1986. 
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, 
Mr. Fletcher once again felt the call to serve 
his country. Though he couldn’t rejoin the Ma-
rines, in July 2014 he joined the U.S. Coast 
Guard Auxiliary, where he remains today. A 
familiar face in active military and veteran 
groups in Metro Detroit, he served as com-
mander of the Dearborn Allied War Veterans 
Council in 2017. Additionally, Mr. Fletcher is a 
member of the Marine Corps League 152 and 
the American Legion Post 364. 
Despite his numerous commitments, he still 
finds time in his busy schedule to give back. 
Mr. Fletcher is most proud of his work with the 
Missing in America Project that helps give for-
gotten remains of veterans a proper burial. 
Three days a week he volunteers at the Free-
dom Center at Detroit Airport and assists in 
creating online memorial profiles for those 
killed in action on Together We Served. Each 
year, he helps at various local events includ-
ing at the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society’s 
Light Up the Night walk that he attends in 
honor of his father who had leukemia. He is 
someone who knows the true meaning of pub-
lic service. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Stephen Fletcher on this well- 
deserved commendation. He has honorably 
served this country throughout his exemplary 
military career. I join with Stephen’s family, 
friends, and colleagues in thanking him for his 
continued service to our community and our 
Nation.

HONORING WORLD WAR II 
VETERAN HEINZ G. BACHMAN 
HON. JOAQUIN CASTRO 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of Mr. Heinz G. Bachman, 
a 100-year-old World War II veteran who hails 
from my hometown of San Antonio, Texas. Mr. 
Bachman was stationed at Hickam Field, Ha-
waii during Pearl Harbor. Throughout his life 
Mr. Bachman exemplified the best of us and 
I am proud to recognize him on this Veterans 
Day. 
Mr. Heinz Bachman was born on October 
22, 1921 in Mu¨lhausen, Germany. Shortly 
thereafter, his family immigrated to the United 
States, landing on Ellis Island in 1924. By 
1934 his family fully emigrated and became 
U.S. citizens. With the rise of the Axis powers 
and seeing conflicts across the globe, Mr. 
Bachman’s father encouraged him to enter the 
armed forces. By 1939, Mr. Bachman joined 
the United States military beginning at Fort 
Dix, New Jersey. During his time in service, 
Mr. Bachman worked as a translator serving in 
the Army Air Corps, reaching the rank of Staff 
Sergeant. 
In 1941, Mr. Bachman was stationed at 
Hickman Air Force Base when the Imperial 
Japanese Forces bombarded Pearl Harbor 
and surrounding military installations through-
out Hawaii. Mr. Bachman was fortunate to be 
away from the main building on detached 
service where bombardments hit the buildings 
center. Upon completion of service in 1945, 
Mr. Bachman went on to interview German ci-
vilians for the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey. 
Mr. Bachman married the love of his life, Mrs. 
Virginia Bachman and raised a family to-
gether. 
Madam Speaker, please join me in recog-
nizing Mr. Heinz Bachman for service and 
commitment to our great country. I thank Mr. 
Bachman for everything he has done for our 
community and country. It is my hope that he 
will continue to share his story. Happy Vet-
erans Day.

In 2018, Congress passed and the Presi-
dent signed into law S. 1050—The Chinese- 
American World War II Veteran Congressional 
Gold Medal Act, which authorized the Con-
gressional Gold Medal to be awarded to these 
individuals in recognition for both their service 
to our Nation during a time at war and to our 
Nation’s Chinese American community. Not 
only did they help in defeating our Nation’s en-
emies, but they overcame the many chal-
lenges they and their families had due to the 
existence of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 
1882. As a matter of fact, 40% of the Chinese 
who served were not even citizens of the 
United States at the time. It was not that they 
did not want to become citizens, but that they 
were denied that right under the Chinese Ex-
clusion Act of 1882. However, due to their 
service and sacrifices for our Nation during 
WWII, Congress finally repealed this unjust 
law in 1943. This laid the groundwork for 
many of our Veterans to return home after the 
war and to attain the opportunities that they 
rightfully earned in their military service to our 
Nation. 
I would respectfully like our Congress today 
to show our appreciation and gratitude to 
these great Americans. We will always re-
member and treasure their personal sacrifices 
and contributions to our Nation.

TORNEY AND EDUCATOR 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, elev-
en months ago, on December 3, 2020, legisla-
tion introduced by my friend and colleague, 
Congresswoman ALMA ADAMS of North Caro-
lina, was signed into law as P.L. 116–203, 
designating the facility of the United States 
Postal Service located at 2505 Derita Avenue 
in Charlotte, North Carolina, as the ‘‘Julius L. 
Chambers Civil Rights Memorial Post Office’’. 
As a senior member of the Committee on 
the Judiciary and one who benefited from the 
work to which Julius Chambers dedicated his 
life, I rise to briefly discuss for the record why 
this was a fitting and appropriate tribute to one 
of the giants of the Civil Rights Movement and 
the unending quest for equal justice under the 
law and to make our union more perfect. 
Born October 6, 1936 in Mount Gilead, 
North Carolina, Julius LeVonne Chambers 
grew up during the Jim Crow era during which 
he experienced daily the indignity of racial dis-
crimination. 
In order to help end segregation and racial 
discrimination, Julius Chambers decided to 
pursue a career in law. 
After receiving his undergraduate degree 
from North Carolina Central University, Julius 
Chambers attended the University of Michigan 
where he earned a masters degree in history. 
Julius Chambers then returned to his native 
North Carolina to attend law school at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where 
he was the first African American editor-in- 
chief of the school’s law review, and grad-
uated as valedictorian in his class of 100 stu-
dents. 
Julius Chambers became the first African 
American to gain membership in the Order of 
the Golden Fleece, which is the University’s 
highest honorary society. 
In 1964, Julius Chambers earned his LL.M 
from Columbia University Law School. 
Julius Chambers began his law practice in 
Charlotte, North Carolina, becoming the first 
integrated firm in the history of North Carolina. 
Under the leadership of Julius Chambers, 
the firm took and won several important cases 
in the Supreme Court of the United States that 
eradicate discrimination and strengthen Amer-
ica’s civil rights laws. 
In the course of this important work, Julius 
Chambers faced several challenges and ob-
stacles, including threats of harm and actual 
violence when his car, law office, and house 
were bombed by segregationist terrorists. 
In 1984, Julius Chambers left the Charlotte 
firm to accept the position of Director and 
Counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Education Fund, Inc. and under his leadership, 
the LDF took several cases to court regarding 
education, voting rights, employment, capital 
punishment, prisons and housing. 
In 1993, Julius Chambers left the LDF to re-
turn to Durham, North Carolina to become the 
chancellor of his alma mater: North Carolina 
Central University. 
Julius Chambers’ remarkable career in edu-
cation is impressive: he served as lecturer at 
several law schools, including Harvard, the 
University of Virginia, the University of Penn-
sylvania, Columbia, and the University of 
Michigan. 
Julius Chambers also served as distin-
guished professor at North Carolina Central 
University and clinical professor of law and di-
rector of the Center for Civil Rights at the Uni-
versity of North Carolina Law School. 
Madam Speaker, P.L. 116–203 memorial-
izes Julius Chambers, a lion of the struggle for 
civil rights and a great man whose good works 
remind us all what America can and deserves 
to become: a land of equal opportunity and 
equal justice under the law.

RECOGNIZING SCOTTISH RITE FOR 
CHILDREN’S 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
HON. VAN TAYLOR 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. TAYLOR. Madam Speaker, today, I rise 
to recognize and celebrate Texas Scottish Rite 
for Children on 100 years of orthopedic excel-
lence and commitment to improving the lives 
of children around the world. 
Founded by a group of Texas Masons, 
Scottish Rite for Children first opened its doors 
on October 10, 1921. In partnership with Dal-
las’ first Orthopedic Surgeon, Dr. William Bell 
Carrell, the clinic’s mission was to provide free 
medical care to children with polio. Following 
the eradication of polio in America, the hos-
pital grew to specialize in complex pediatric 
orthopedic conditions with a focus on muscles, 
bones, and joints. The scope of care would 
further broaden to include neurodevelopmental 
and musculoskeletal conditions as well as 
specific learning disorders. 
What began as a one-room clinic run by Dr. 
Carrell has today grown into a world-renowned 
hospital whose groundbreaking research has 
paved the way for advanced treatments for 
over 350,000 patients. 
Home to several specialized research cen-
ters, Scottish Rite remains a pioneer in inno-
vative treatments holding over fifty patents. 
Active involvement in hundreds of projects 
range from areas focused on molecular genet-
ics to those in bioengineering and bio-
mechanics. Further, collaboration between re-
searchers from various educational back-
grounds have resulted in the creation of sur-
gical implants, treatment for specific disorders, 
and rehabilitation aids. 
The success of the hospital would not be 
possible without the help of volunteers, staff 
member and donors who have a shared com-
mitment to improving the lives of the children 
they serve locally and across the world. 
Today, Scottish Rite has distinguished itself 
as a healthcare campus instilling hope in pa-
tients and caregivers. Designed with both pa-
tient and family experience in mind, its re-
search centers and facilities are connected to 
playgrounds, parks, and fitness centers, while 
the colorful hallways carry the aroma of the 
over two tons of signature popcorn popped 
annually. 
Consistently recognized as a top-performing 
children’s hospital, it is no surprise they have 
been ranked among the Top 5 Orthopedic 
Programs in the U.S. News & World Report’s 
Best Children’s Hospital’s survey and have 
also been recognized on multiple occasions by 
NRC Health with the Excellence in Patient Ex-
perience Award. 
Now as we recognize Scottish Rite for Chil-
dren on this milestone occasion, I ask my col-
leagues in the House of Representatives to 
join me in honoring 100 years of exemplary 
care and innovation. 
RECOGNIZING THE SHEPHERD’S 
CENTER OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the volunteers of the Shepherd’s 
Center of Northern Virginia and to thank them 
for their many contributions to the Northern 
Virginia community. 
Organized in 1997, the formally named 
Shepherd’s Center of Oakton-Vienna (SCOV) 
is a nonprofit that provides services to help 
older adults continue living independently, and 
it offers programs that supply opportunities for 
enrichment, learning, and socialization. 
Each year, over 250 volunteers support 
older residents who want to both age in place 
in their homes and stay engaged in social ac-
tivities. Services are available free of charge 
to anyone age 50 or older who resides in the 
local community. 
In the past few years, the Shepherd’s Cen-
ter has greatly expanded their geographical 
footprint. After seeing a rising need in Reston 
and Herndon for free transportation services 
for seniors, the original Shepherd’s Center of 
Oakton-Vienna expanded their service area. 
Earlier this year that expansion continued as 
the Shepherd’s Center expanded to include 
the former territory covered by the Shepherd’s 
Center of Great Falls, creating one unified 
Shepherd’s Center of Northern Virginia. 
As the Shepherd’s Center has grown, they 
have been able to share their vision with even 
more older adults in our communities which 
has been more important than ever. The com-
mitment to a world without loneliness has a 
whole new meaning as we have navigated this 
pandemic with social distancing and quaran-
tining. The Shepherd’s Center’s innovation 
and dedication to our community has been in-
valuable, especially during this past year and 
a half. 
The services and programs offered by the 
Shepherd’s Center help to ensure that our 
seniors stay connected to the community 
through the promotion of active lifestyles, on-
going social integration, and availability of re-
sources for older residents to use their experi-
ence, training, and skills in significant roles in 
society. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that my colleagues 
join me in recognizing the Shepherd’s Center 
of Northern Virginia for its work to enable 
older adults in our community to age in place 
and enjoy their golden years with dignity and 
independence. I thank the many volunteers 
who generously dedicate their time and efforts 
to the welfare of our neighbors. The value of 
their contributions cannot be overstated and 
are deserving of our highest praise.

HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Fairfax County 4–H Achieve-
ment Night Ceremony Awardees. 
Each year, the Fairfax County 4–H offers 
fun and hands-on learning experiences to 
youth ages 5 through 18 with the help of dedi-
cated volunteers. These unique opportunities 
to educate on subjects such as animals, lead-
ership, cooking, and the outdoors is contrib-
uting towards developing our future leaders of 
tomorrow. This year’s awardees are integral to 
the success of Fairfax County 4–H, and the 
enrichment opportunities and experiences will 
last a lifetime. It is my honor to include in the 
RECORD the following awardees and commend 
them for their service to the Fairfax County 4–

dedicated countless hours of service to ensure 
that the Fairfax County 4–H is able to provide 
exceptional leadership and learning opportuni-
ties to the youth of Fairfax County, Virginia.

IN 
SUPPORT 
OF 
THE 
SENATE 
AMENDMENT TO H.R. 3684 INFRA-
STRUCTURE 
INVESTMENT 
AND 
JOBS ACT 
HON. SUZANNE BONAMICI 
OF OREGON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Ms. BONAMICI. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the bipartisan Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA). 
The American Society of Civil Engineers 
(ASCE) gives the overall infrastructure in the 
United States a dismal C¥ rating—and many 
of ASCE’s scoring categories, including roads, 
waterways, levees, transit, and wastewater, 
score lower than the nation’s overall average. 
Our national infrastructure is crumbling, out-
dated, and in urgent need of significant up-
grades. Additionally, the largest source of en-
ergy-related carbon dioxide emissions in the 
country comes from the transportation sector, 
which disproportionately affects low-income 
communities 
and 
communities 
of 
color. 
Though this legislation leaves out many of the 
crucial climate provisions in the House-passed 
INVEST in America Act, it still represents a ro-
bust and meaningful investment in a more 
connected and resilient nation. 
The IIJA makes overdue investments in our 
nation’s transportation sector. IIJA provides 
$110 billion for roads, bridges, and major 
projects, and makes some notable invest-
ments in clean transportation by providing 
more than $20 billion for electric vehicle

charging infrastructure—the single largest fed-
eral investment of its kind in history. These in-
vestments are necessary, because 43 percent 
of public roadways are in poor condition, 40 
percent of the 600,000 bridges in the United 
States are at least 50 years old, and more 
than one-third of all bridges need repairs. In 
addition, the IIJA includes over $16 billion for 
waterway and coastal projects, including $2.25 
billion for the Port Infrastructure Development 
Program (PIDP), which supports investments 
in projects to upgrade and modernize ports. 
Coastal communities like mine in Oregon un-
derstand how important these investments are 
to maintain and expand ports as hubs for 
commerce, employment, and transportation. 
Widespread and dependable public transit 
systems are necessary to create more equi-
table communities and reduce carbon emis-
sions. Public transportation provides commu-
nities with affordable commuting options that 
facilitate access to employment, school and 
daycare, vital health care services, and more. 
The Department of Transportation reports that 
nearly half of the total carbon footprint of the 
typical American family with two cars comes 
from car transportation. The IIJA provides 
more than $39 billion to support public transit, 
which will help reduce congestion and carbon 
emissions. This investment is estimated to 
support repairs for more than 24,000 buses, 
5,000 rail cars, and thousands of miles of 
tracks, all of which will help connect commu-
nities and support emissions reductions. The 
bill also includes $5 billion for low- and zero- 
emission buses—including school buses— 
which will help cut emissions that hurt vulner-
able communities and students. 
Climate change is increasing the intensity 
and frequency of severe weather events like 
the fires, heatwaves, and droughts that the 
Pacific Northwest has experienced over the 
last year. We must improve our nation’s infra-
structure to withstand and protect people and 
property from these extreme weather events. 
The IIJA includes $65 billion for power and 
grid infrastructure resilience and expansion. 
This includes funding to support efforts to 
harden the electric grid against disruptive 
weather events, as well as funding to promote 
innovative demonstration projects that will im-
prove grid resilience. The legislation also pro-
vides more than $3 billion for wildfire risk re-
duction efforts, including funding for firefighting 
resources, and $3 billion for the U.S. Forest 
Service to implement ecosystem restoration 
projects that can help minimize the spread of 
wildfires. 
Though broadband access has steadily in-
clined for the overall population, Americans 
who are non-white, less educated, lower in-
come, and residents of rural communities dis-
proportionately have limited broadband ac-
cess. The 19 million Americans that lack ac-
cess to consistent, quality broadband, may 
have greater difficulty realizing certain employ-
ment, educational, and social opportunities. To 
help remedy this disparity, the IIJA invests $65 
billion for broadband investment, including 
funding for state grants, additional support for 
rural communities and Tribes, and support to 
accelerate broadband uptake through digital 
literacy training. 
By making crucial investments in our na-
tion’s infrastructure, this bill will create new, 
good-paying jobs and will help support our na-
tion through the recovery from the COVID–19 
pandemic. It represents a significant commit-
ment toward a more connected and resilient 
nation, and I applaud the House and Senate 
for passage of this historic legislation.

RECOGNIZING THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF CORNERSTONES 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the 50th Anniversary of Corner-
stones. 
Established in 1970 to address the need for 
affordable housing, Cornerstones has grown 
to become a significant human services pro-
vider and advocate for those struggling to 
make ends meet in Northern Virginia. Over the 
years, Cornerstones’ scope of programs and 
number of clients has continued to grow. Cor-
nerstones has expanded to cover most of 
northwestern Fairfax County and has been 
able to help more than 16,000 neighbors each 
year who need housing, childcare, food, or fi-
nancial assistance. 
Cornerstones promotes self-sufficiency by 
providing support and advocacy for those in 
need of food, shelter, affordable housing, qual-
ity childcare, and other human services. The 
wrap-around services- provided by Corner-
stones not only addresses the immediate 
needs of their clients, but also help provide 
the support needed for individuals and families 
to break the cycle of poverty or homelessness 
and begin their journey to independence and 
self-sufficiency. Cornerstones continues to en-
vision a community that values all people and 
shares resources and services to empower 
those in need. 
Throughout the COVID–19 pandemic, Cor-
nerstones has continued to provide vital serv-
ices and programs to the most vulnerable in 
our community that have been hit hard by 
COVID–19. With adjustments to in-person 
services to engage people safely, and a new 
focus on virtual programs, Cornerstones has 
been able to continue making a positive im-
pact. 
There were drastic increases in the number 
of individuals and families seeking assistance 
from the Cornerstones’ Food Pantry, as well 
as their other services such as their youth pro-
grams, community and neighborhood re-
sources, and housing counseling programs. 
Cornerstones was able to rise to the challenge 
and meet the demand with their dedicated 
staff and volunteers. 
Cornerstones emphasizes the importance of 
stability, empowerment, and hope through 
their work in Fairfax County. Their commit-
ment and resilience throughout the past 50 
years, and especially throughout the pan-
demic, serves as a beacon of inspiration for 
our county as we continue to work to address 
the systemic inequities and barriers that exist 
for so many. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating Cornerstones for their 
50th anniversary, and I sincerely thank their 
employees and volunteers who give their time 
and energy on behalf of our community. Their 
efforts provide immeasurable benefits to their 
fellow neighbors and serve as a reminder of 
why Fairfax County remains such a great 
place to live, work, and raise a family. 
IN SUPPORT OF H.R. 3684, THE IN-
FRASTRUCTURE 
INVESTMENT 
AND JOBS ACT 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, today I cast my vote in support of 
this once-in-a-generation bipartisan infrastruc-
ture bill. While the bill does not contain as 
many resources as I feel are needed nor is it 
as robust as initially envisioned, the legislation 
makes a momentous investment in infrastruc-
ture that Chicago and our nation desperately 
need. 
Chicago needs the largest federal invest-
ment in public transit ever. 
Chicago needs the largest investment in 
passenger rail since the creation of Amtrak. 
Chicago needs to improve its bridges, high-
ways, and schools. 
Our neighborhoods need clean drinking 
water, our lead pipes need replacing, and our 
wastewater infrastructure requires substantial 
improvements. Parents should know that the 
water they’re kids are drinking is safe from 
lead leaching out of old pipes or contaminated 
brownfields. 
Chicago needs the good paying jobs—union 
jobs—with an expected 2 million jobs per year 
with critical labor protections, buy America 
provisions to support manufacturing here at 
home, and jobs in the growing clean energy 
industry. 
Chicago needs the historic investment in 
highspeed internet to every American house-
hold to erase the digital divide and improve 
equity in technology access. Students, work-
ers, and seniors on the West Side of Chicago 
shouldn’t be locked out of education, applying 
for jobs, and accessing services by limited 
internet. 
Chicago needs the cleaner environment that 
comes with electric buses and renewable en-
ergy. African American children experience 
higher rates of asthma, and diesel air pollution 
hurt our communities. 
This legislation advances economic and 
public health opportunities for people of color. 
The effects of decades of disinvestment have 
fallen hardest on communities of color. 
Through substantial investments in good-pay-
ing jobs, affordable high-speed internet, public 
transportation, 
safe 
drinking 
water, 
and 
modem bridges and roads, this bill works to 
improve racial and economic equity. 
I wholeheartedly support the Infrastructure 
Investment and Jobs Act because doing so 
guarantees tens of millions of dollars and 
thousands of jobs for Illinois, helping revitalize 
my community and communities across the 
country.

November 5, 2021 
(FBCM) on the occasion of the 150th anniver-
sary of its sanctuary. 
First Baptist Church of Merrifield was started 
in a log cabin between 1871–1872. FBCM had 
then branched out and began worshipping on 
property owned by Mr. Robert Bradley of 
Merrifield. In 1891, the property was pur-
chased from him by church Trustees: John E. 
Coates, Joshua Ball, and Joshua Pearson for 
the sum of five dollars. And quickly, FBCM 
was a church formed from strong community 
family ties. 
First Baptist Church of Merrifield was unable 
to adequately celebrate their 150th ‘‘Sesqui-
centennial’’ Homecoming Anniversary in 2020 
due to the challenges of COVID–19. This 
year’s celebration is significant as the spirit of 
last year is incorporated with the excitement of 
reaching 151 years. First Baptist Church of 
Merrifield remains a vital part of the commu-
nity today partnering with their neighbors both 
before and during COYID–19. They hosted the 
Greater Merrifield Business Association An-
nual Fall Festival in 2018, and virtual Sunday 
Services and Bible Studies continued to be 
held each week. They also organized First 
Baptist Church of Merrifield Community Fes-
tivals held in 2018 and 2019, that included 
free food giveaways, gift card give-away, sem-
inars on anxiety and grief, free tutoring, and 
mentorship sessions with local schools within 
the community (Luther Jackson Middle School, 
Timber Lane Elementary School, Annandale 
High School) as well as other outreach efforts. 
In 151 years, there have been 13 pastors 
and 2 interim pastors. Each one contributing 
to the growth of FBCM in their own way. A 
few of those contributions include: the estab-
lishment of the Golden Ages Senior Saints 
Ministry, the Merrifield Child Development 
Center, the Recovery of the Historic Bell, cre-
ation of a youth mentoring program with Lu-
ther Jackson Middle School, tutoring outreach 
with Luther Jackson Middle School, Timber 
Lane Elementary School, and Annandale High 
School, and much more. FBCM truly leads by 
both faith and example in our community. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending First Baptist Church of 
Merrifield for its efforts to better the Northern 
Virginia region and in congratulating them on 
the occasion of this anniversary. It is a privi-
lege to work alongside this great congregation 
in the community, and I wish them continued 
success through faith, family, and service.

HONORING 
THE 
50TH 
ANNIVER-
SARY 
OF 
MERCED 
COLLEGE’S 
LOS BANOS CAMPUS 
HON. JIM COSTA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Merced College’s Los Banos Campus 
on its 50th anniversary. This phenomenal edu-
cational institution has been providing the stu-
dents of Los Banos and the Central Valley 
with a high-quality educational institution for 
50 years. 
In 1971, Merced College President Lowell 
Barker alongside founding Dean Ted McVey 
decided to begin providing full-time education 
services to student in a rented facility. From 
there, the campus eventually moved to a plot 
of 10 acres of land donated by resident Rich-
ard Menezes in 1982. 
They began the process of setting up their 
new permanent campus after a land donation 
from Larry and Georgeann Anderson in 2002. 
Finally, in 2007, the current Los Banos Cam-
pus opened its doors for its students, and has 
continued to provide a wide range of courses 
to assist students in their path towards a de-
gree or transfer. 
The Los Banos Campus also provides a 
great selection of career technical education 
courses that, in as little as six months, can 
prepare students to enter directly into the 
workforce. In addition to this, the campus con-
tinues to expand its use and implementation of 
various technological resources for its stu-
dents to ensure they are set up for success. 
For the students of Los Banos, this edu-
cational institution serves a vital role in pro-
viding robust opportunities, while ensuring that 
these individuals can have access to these ex-
periences right in their own hometown, thus 
reducing significant barriers to their success. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring Merced College’s Los Banos 
Campus on its 50th anniversary. Its service 
and contributions to the State of California and 
the San Joaquin Valley will always be cele-
brated.

RECOGNIZING THE RECIPIENTS OF 
THE GLOBAL ORGANIZATION OF 
PEOPLE 
OF 
INDIAN 
ORIGIN 
AWARDS OF EXCELLENCE 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Global Organization of People 
of Indian Origin (GOPIO) and to congratulate 
the recipients of its Annual Awards of Excel-
lence. Founded in 1989, the mission of 
GOPIO is battling human rights violations 
committed against persons of Indian origin. 
Today, while that mission continues, GOPIO 
has also broadened its mission to include 
bringing together persons of Indian origin for 
the benefit of not only themselves and their In-
dian homeland, but also the communities in 
which they currently reside. 
Indian-Americans have made countless con-
tributions to the United States in the fields of 
business, education, medicine, science, tech-
nology, and public service while preserving 
and sharing their culture in a manner that pro-
motes tolerance and mutual understanding. 
Many of our awardees have been at the 
forefront of those efforts. It is my honor to in-
clude in the RECORD the names of the fol-
lowing individuals: 
Dr. V.K. Raju—Medicine 
Dr. Vikram Raya—Entrepreneurship 
Dr. Korok Ray—Innovation & Research 
Dr. Ram Gupta—Education 
Professor Indrajit S. Saluja—Journalism 
Nilima Mehra—Media Journalism 
Vinita Tiwari—Arts & Culture Poet, Singer & 
Dancer 
Janetha R. Kancharla—Philanthropy & Ad-
vocacy 
Northern Virginia, which I am proud to rep-
resent in Congress, is blessed by its diversity. 
We are home to more than 40,000 people of 
Indian descent as well as Indian-American 
owned small businesses. This diversity en-
riches our entire community and contributes to 
our region being considered one of the best 
places in the country in which to live, work, 
raise a family, and start a business. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating all of the recipients of the 
GOPIO Awards of Excellence on their accom-
plishments. I commend them for their service 
to their communities and to our Nation, and I 
wish them success in all their future endeav-
ors.

PROTECT VOTING RIGHTS 
HON. BARBARA LEE 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Ms. LEE of California. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Speaker PELOSI, Leader HOYER, Whip 
CLYBURN, Chairman NADLER, and all my distin-
guished colleagues for their work to ensure 
the House passed legislation to protect voting 
rights. It is time for the Senate to do the same. 
We have seen an uptick in voter suppres-
sion efforts across our nation to undercut the 
representation of communities of color, specifi-
cally African Americans. With historic levels of 
voter turnout in recent elections, our Repub-
lican colleagues have interpreted this in-
creased participation in civic life as a threat 
and campaigned to disenfranchise Black vot-
ers under the guise of protecting against 
‘‘voter fraud.’’ 
Sadly, voter suppression efforts are not new 
to African American communities. I remember 
growing up in El Paso, Texas when the poll 
tax was still being collected. We have endured 
decades of abuse by political parties and elec-
tion officials seeking to deny us our constitu-
tional right to vote. Therefore, it is urgent that 
the Senate pass The John Lewis Voting 
Rights Advancement Act. This critical legisla-
tion would restore Section 5 and Section 2 of 
the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits racially 
discriminatory changes to the voting process 
and restrictions to the right to vote. 
Lastly, I’d just like to say that the world is 
watching us. As Chair of the House Appropria-
tions Subcommittee on State, Foreign Oper-
ations and having served as an election ob-
server in other countries, I know the impor-
tance of a free and fair election and how it 
strengthens a democracy. Across the country 
we are witnessing a coordinated assault on 
the integrity of our electoral process. We need 
to live up to our own ideals to stand as an ex-
ample for other countries to follow. 
The Senate must pass the John Lewis Vot-
ing Rights Advancement Act. It will strengthen 
our democracy and give us the tools to fight 
voter suppression.

2021 Arts Awards. These awards recognize 
the extraordinary contributions of artists and 
arts organizations, as well as individuals and 
businesses in Fairfax County, the City of Fair-
fax, and the City of Falls Church that support 
the arts in our community. 
Founded in 1964, the formally named Arts 
Council of Fairfax County, Inc. is a non-profit 
organization designated as Fairfax County’s 
local arts agency. ArtsFairfax operates pro-
grams and initiatives that include grants, arts 
advocacy, education, and professional devel-
opment opportunities for artists and arts orga-
nizations. 
Despite the challenges that the COVID–19 
pandemic presented to the arts community, in 
FY2020, ArtsFairfax awarded over $550,000 in 
County, public, and private funds through 
competitive grants and awards to arts organi-
zations and individual artists. These grants 
helped fund over 23,500 arts programs which 
reached more than 440,700 audience mem-
bers: ArtsFairfax’s resiliency and adaptability 
allowed the organization to continue meeting 
the needs of the arts community even during 
these unprecedented times. 
The Arts Awards honors supporters of the 
arts in four categories: the Jinx Hazel Arts 
Award, the Arts Impact Award, the Arts Edu-
cation Award, and the Arts Philanthropy 
Award. It is my honor to include in the 
RECORD the following names of the 2021 Arts 
Awards Recipients: 
The 2021 Jinx Hazel Arts Award will be pre-
sented to the National Museum of the United 
States Army. 
The 2021 Arts Impact Award will be pre-
sented to 1st Stage. 
The 2021 Arts Education Award will be pre-
sented to the Traveling Players Ensemble and 
artist Kelli Schollard-Sincock. 
The 2021 Arts Philanthropy Award will be 
presented to the Reston Town Center Asso-
ciation. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in congratulating the recipients of the 2021 
Arts Awards and recognizing the visionaries, 
leaders, and supporters who help to make our 
Northern Virginia communities rich with cul-
tural opportunities.

CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF HIS-
TORY 
OF 
TOLEDO 
CHAPTER 
ZONTA INTERNATIONAL 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the Toledo Chapter of Zonta Inter-
national. The members of the chapter are 
gathering on Saturday November 6, 2021 to 
celebrate this milestone event. 
Two years after the formation of Zonta Inter-
national, on November 25, 1921, Toledo 
women joined forces to form the Zonta Club of 
Toledo. Those early founders, leading profes-
sional women of the day, carried forth the or-
ganization’s vision as a women’s service orga-
nization that would advocate for policies en-
suring gender equality, protect the rights of 
women and girls, reduce the incidents of vio-
lence against them, and empower women and 
girls to reach their full potential. 
To that end, in its century of service the 
women of Zonta Club of Toledo have led the 
way in efforts to promote the development of 
women while providing planning, financial and 
volunteer support to numerous initiatives. 
Zonta has assisted the Area Office on Aging 
Kinship Navigator program, Bethany House 
shelter, YMCA Storer Camps and YWCA bat-
tered women’s shelter, purchased HIV/AIDS 
test kits for Plan Parenthood, raised aware-
ness regarding human trafficking and domestic 
violence, provided scholarship opportunities 
and offered volunteer support to a variety of 
services in our community and globally. 
Through one hundred years, the members of 
the Zonta Club of Toledo have continued to 
build the organization into one of excellence 
and inspiration. 
Zonta’s mission is to improve ‘‘the legal, po-
litical, economic, educational, health and pro-
fessional status of women through service and 
advocacy’’ while ‘‘working for the advance-
ment of understanding, goodwill and peace 
through a global fellowship of Zonta mem-
bers.’’ As one of the oldest chapters, the 
Zonta Club of Toledo serves this mission well 
and its members truly reflect Zonta’s efforts to 
promote ‘‘justice and universal respect for 
human rights and fundamental freedoms.’’ 
Malala Yousafzai, the youngest Nobel prize 
laureate and Pakistani activist, said ‘‘When the 
whole world is silent even one voice becomes 
powerful.’’ Throughout a century of service, 
the women of the Zonta Club of Toledo have 
united many and varied voices into one pow-
erful voice and in the process are changing 
the world. Onward Zonta, for the next hundred 
years.

RECOGNIZING THE 2021 LORDS AND 
LADIES OF FAIRFAX 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize a dedicated group of men and 
women in Northern Virginia. Every year, each 
member of the Fairfax County Board of Super-
visors selects two people from his or her dis-
trict who have demonstrated outstanding vol-
unteer service, heroism, or other exceptional 
commitments and contributions to our commu-
nity. Since the program’s inception in 1984, 
approximately 600 individuals have earned the 
honor of being named a Lord or Lady Fairfax 
by his or her representative on the Board of 
Supervisors. 
This year, the Fairfax County Board of Su-
pervisors will recognize those individuals who 
have made tremendous impacts through their 
support of our public schools, parks, youth 
sports leagues, arts community, public safety, 
and human service programs. It is nearly im-
possible to fully describe the diversity of ac-
complishments of the honorees. Their efforts 
contribute greatly to the quality of life for the 
residents of Fairfax County and are worthy of 
our praise and sincere appreciation. 
It is my honor to include in the RECORD the 
names of the 2021 Lords and Ladies Fairfax: 
At-Large: Lady Pamela Montesinos and 
Lord Andres Jimenez 
Braddock District: Lady Leeann Alberts and 
Lord Robert W. Cosgriff 
Dranesville District: Lady Janie Strauss and 
Lord William Canis 
Hunter Mill District: Lady Brenda lrons- 
LeCesne and Lord Alvarez LeCesne Jr. 
Lee District: Lady Renee Grebe and Lord

Lord Keary Kincannon 
Providence District: Lady Mercedes Dash 
and Lord Ken McMillon 
Springfield District: Lady Christy Hudson 
and Lord Evan Draim 
Sully District: Lady Debbie Kilpatrick and 
Lord Carlos Carrero 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in commending and expressing our grati-
tude to these men and women who volunteer 
their time and energy on behalf of our commu-
nity. Their efforts, which are deserving of our 
highest praise, provide immeasurable benefits 
to their fellow residents and serve as a re-
minder of why Fairfax County remains such a 
great place to live, work, and raise a family.

HONORING THE LIFE OF FRANK 
VAJDA 
HON. GERALD E. CONNOLLY 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, November 5, 2021 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
celebrate the life of Frank Vajda, a dedicated 
public servant who passed away on January 
27, 2021, at the age of 84. 
Frank Vajda grew up in New Brunswick, 
New Jersey, and went on to attend Rutgers 
University on a full academic scholarship. He 
graduated with a degree in electrical engineer-
ing which he used throughout his 28 years of 
service in the United States Air Force. His 
military assignments included the Air Force 
Weapons Laboratory, the Los Alamos, NV 
Test Site, the Air Force Institute of Tech-
nology, the Defense Nuclear Agency, two 
tours at the Pentagon and a tour with the For-
eign Technology Division, where he met his 
future wife, Judith. 
After retiring from the Air Force, Frank and 
Judith relocated to Fairfax County where he 
became very active in community activities. 
Frank quickly got involved with his local civic 
association, the Court of Camelot Civic Asso-
ciation, where he went on to serve as presi-
dent. He also founded the Camelot annual 
holiday charity fund drive which raised thou-
sands of dollars for the Children’s Hospital. 
Frank’s years of dedication to the Court of 
Camelot was recognized in 2016, as Frank 
was named a Knight of Camelot by the civic 
association. 
In addition to his work with the Civic Asso-
ciation, Frank served on the Camelot Neigh-
borhood Watch Group, which is the oldest 
continuing Neighborhood Watch in the nation. 
He organized and promoted the first park 
watch group at Pine Ridge, a local neighbor-
hood park, and because of his public safety 
efforts, the Park Authority, the Fairfax County 
Police, and the Rose Purple have established 
the countywide PARKWATCH system. 
Frank dedicated countless hours to the Fair-
fax County Parks, starting with his time as a 
member of the Steering Committee for the 
Friends of Mason District Park. He went on to 
serve as a park volunteer for numerous fes-
tivals and events and was selected as the

Mason District Representative to the Public 
Safety and Park Bond Referendum Committee 
for his dedication to safety during all park 
events and activities. In 2001, Frank was ap-
pointed to the Park Authority Board where he 
dutifully represented Mason District for 16 
years. 
Public service was at the core of who Frank 
was. Although he did not do any of this for the 
recognition, his dedication to his community 
earned him numerous awards, including the 
1998 Elly Doyle Park Service Award and the 
Mason District Council of Civic Associations’ 
Man of the Year award. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me in honoring the life and legacy of Frank 
Vajda. His leadership and commitment to pub-
lic service and safety was inspirational, and he 
will be missed by all who knew him. I also ex-
tend my deepest condolences to his wife, Ju-
dith, and his faithful companion, Jake.
