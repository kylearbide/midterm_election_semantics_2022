GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
last night, the House of Representa-
tives passed the strongest, boldest, and 
most significant government funding 
package we have seen in a very long 
time, bringing us one step closer to 
fully funding the government for the 
2022 fiscal year. 
As we all know, funding the govern-
ment is a basic responsibility of Con-
gress, but rarely does this responsi-
bility arrive at such a critical moment 
for our country and for the world. War 
has erupted in Europe, and Americans 
are looking to relief from rising costs, 
and this package is critical for facing 
these challenges. 
After weeks of hard work, I am 
pleased to report that this bipartisan 
funding package represents a robust 
and unapologetic investment in the 
American people: It will give our 
troops a raise, provide more money for 
schools and Head Start programs and 
Pell Grants, reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act, fund the Presi-
dent’s Cancer Moonshot, and open the 
floodgates for funding the bipartisan 
infrastructure law. This funding bill is 
overflowing with very good things for 
our troops, for American jobs, for our 
families, and for America. 
Once this bill arrives at the Senate, 
Republicans must work with Demo-
crats to pass the bill as soon as pos-
sible—hopefully, 
tonight. 
There 
is 
every reason in the world to believe 
that we can arrive at a path forward 
quickly.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1070 
March 10, 2022 
For one, the people of Ukraine need 
our immediate help, and this omnibus 
is the quickest and most direct way of 
getting them the help fast. At nearly 
$14 billion, Congress will approve more 
than double—more than double—what 
the 
administration 
originally 
re-
quested for Ukraine aid, and that is a 
huge accomplishment. We took the 
President’s original request for Ukrain-
ian aid, examined it and added to it. 
I can confidently say every last 
penny of this aid package will be much 
needed and well spent. It will provide 
food, medicine, shelter, and support for 
over 2 million refugees and resources 
for Ukraine’s ruined economy. It will 
also inject billions into military assist-
ance. It will enable weapons transfers 
like Javelins and Stingers. It will reas-
sure and strengthen NATO and add 
teeth to our defenses against Russia’s 
malicious cyber warfare. 
And to every corrupt Russian oli-
garch who has dined off Putin’s regime 
for years, beware. This package will in-
crease the government’s tools for hunt-
ing you down and holding you account-
able. 
The Ukrainian people are fighting for 
their lives and fighting for the survival 
of their young democracy. Congress 
has a moral obligation to stand behind 
them as they resist the evils of Vladi-
mir Putin and his campaign of carnage. 
The 2022 government funding bill is 
one way we are keeping that promise, 
and for that reason alone, it should 
pass the Senate as quickly as possible. 
But on the homefront, as I already 
mentioned, there are lots of important 
things. This package increases invest-
ments across nearly every single do-
mestic priority, very much needed. 
I am particularly thrilled to say 
that, after a decade of false starts, this 
package will finally reauthorize the Vi-
olence Against Women Act, which I 
originally helped write and pass when I 
was a Congressman back in 1994. Unfor-
tunately, this very needed, important 
bill to protect those who are abused 
has languished in limbo for far too 
long. VAWA is one of the most impor-
tant pieces of legislation of the past 30 
years, and once it is reauthorized, it 
will once again provide lifesaving sup-
port for countless women who face sex-
ual assault and domestic abuse. I 
thank Senators FEINSTEIN, DURBIN, 
ERNST, MURKOWSKI, and all the cospon-
sors—bipartisan—for helping to bring 
this law back to life. 
Now, of course, nobody argues that 
this package is perfect. I am deeply 
disappointed—deeply 
disappointed— 
that the administration’s request for 
more COVID funding failed to make it 
into the House bill, but we are going to 
keep fighting to make sure we get that 
money approved as soon as possible. 
COVID funding right now is all about 
being prepared. It will provide funding 
for vaccines and therapeutics and test-
ing, which means it will be much easier 
to keep schools open, to keep busi-
nesses open, and to keep life closer to 
normal than it was during Delta and 
Omicron. So we will keep working on 
COVID relief. It is very much needed. 
Now, we are not over the finish line 
yet, but I want to thank appropriators 
from both sides of the aisle—bipar-
tisan—for putting this package to-
gether, never an easy task. I especially 
thank Chairman LEAHY for his leader-
ship and his counsel over the course of 
this process, and I thank Ranking 
Member SHELBY as well, and my House 
colleagues, too, for working in good 
faith to make this bill possible. 
It has not been easy to draft this 
truly robust package, but after years of 
needless chaos and uncertainty under 
Donald Trump, this year Congress has 
been able to work together on a bipar-
tisan basis to fund the government in a 
serious way. Now the Senate must fol-
low through in finishing the job by ap-
proving this bill quickly and sending it 
to the President’s desk. 
f 
SENATE ACCOMPLISHMENTS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, so 
we still have some more work to do, 
but it has already been a remarkably 
busy and productive week here in the 
Senate. 
After nearly a decade of work, this 
week the Senate finally passed the 
largest postal reform bill in a very long 
time, with huge bipartisan support, I 
am happy to say. We also sent to the 
President’s desk the first bill in Amer-
ican history that finally, finally—long 
overdue—declares lynching a Federal 
crime after a century of failed at-
tempts. These are both momentous and 
indeed historic accomplishments, and I 
thank my colleagues for working in 
good faith to get them done. 
I have always said that, whenever 
possible, Democrats would be willing to 
work in a bipartisan way to get things 
done, and, once the omnibus is done, in 
this week we will have achieved three 
major bipartisan accomplishments. 
Yesterday, Senate Democrats also 
met for our DPCC retreat over at How-
ard University, where we had a spirited 
and productive conversation about the 
biggest issues facing American fami-
lies: lowering costs. As the world con-
tinues to struggle with COVID, supply 
chain disruptions, and Russia’s war on 
Ukraine, Americans need relief—relief 
on everything from energy costs, pre-
scription drug costs, the cost of gro-
ceries and meat and so much more. 
Democrats will keep working these 
issues with laser-like intensity and un-
flinching focus. 
Moving forward, the Senate will also 
continue the process of considering 
and, ultimately, confirming President 
Biden’s exceptional nominee to the 
U.S. Supreme Court: Judge Ketanji 
Brown Jackson. That Judge Jackson is 
qualified for the High Court is not in 
question. That she merits bipartisan 
support should not be disputed, because 
on three occasions she has already 
come before this Chamber and has been 
embraced by people on both sides of the 
aisle. 
When Judge Jackson’s confirmation 
hearings begin on March 21, the entire 
Nation will get to see what many of us 
in the Senate are learning for our-
selves: Judge Jackson is brilliant, she 
is beloved, and she belongs on the Su-
preme Court. The three b’s: brilliant, 
beloved, belongs. 
We have more work to do before this 
week comes to an end, but, for now, I 
thank my colleagues for a very, very 
productive few days. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

pore. Without objection, it is so or-

RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

f 
COSTS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
Washington Democrats are trying to 
pull off a political spin job for the ages. 
Everyone knows that gas prices and en-
ergy costs have been soaring sharply 
for many, many months. Working fam-
ilies know all too well that gas prices 
and utility costs have been rising 
throughout President Biden’s tenure. 
Just this morning, we learned that 
inflation 
set 
yet 
another 
modern 
record last month. Prices skyrocketed 
another 0.8 percent in February alone. 
That comes out to 7.9 percent inflation 
year on year, the worst inflation in 40 
years. And it keeps getting worse, not 
better. 
This has been a painful pattern 
throughout President Biden’s tenure. 
We have now had 9 straight months of 
inflation higher than 5 percent. And re-
member, 3 weeks ago, before the crisis 
in Europe, Democrats were already in a 
political panic over gas prices and des-
perately talking about a gas tax holi-
day. Three weeks ago, before the crisis 
in Europe, the average price of a gallon 
of gas had already shot up more than a 
dollar from when President Biden was 
sworn in. 
Now, you would think the Democrats 
would have been proud of this. Hos-
tility to fossil fuels and homegrown 
American energy is precisely what 
President Biden campaigned on. Here is 
what our President said on the cam-
paign trail in 2020—a direct quote: 
No more subsidies for the fossil fuel indus-
try. No more drilling on Federal lands. No 
more drilling, including offshore. No ability 
for the oil industry to continue to drill, pe-
riod. [It] ends. 
That was the President in 2020. Here 
is what he told an activist:

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1071 
March 10, 2022 
[L]ook at my eyes. I guarantee you . . . we 
are going to end— 
End— 
fossil fuel. 
Now, President Biden spent 2 years 
campaigning on hostility to American 
energy. Now he has spent 14 months 
putting that hostility right into ac-
tion, and Democrats’ reckless spending 
that has fueled across-the-board infla-
tion has made Americans’ pain at the 
pump even worse. 
But in the last few days, the Biden 
administration has tried to invent 
some laugh-out-loud—laugh-out-loud— 
revisionist history. They are trying to 
rebrand the entire increase in gas 
prices on their watch—listen to this— 
as an effect of Putin’s recent invasion 
of Ukraine. So they want to blame 14 
months of gas price increases on the 
last 2 weeks of turmoil. 
Washington Democrats’ war on do-
mestic energy long, long predates 
Putin’s war on Ukraine. So let me say 
that again. Democrats’ war on domes-
tic energy long predates Putin’s war on 
Ukraine. 
Now, I strongly support America 
stopping our purchases of Putin’s oil, 
but Democrats’ 14-month war on our 
own production will make that nec-
essary action more painful for Amer-
ican families than it had to be. If the 
Biden administration had spent 14 
months promoting American energy in-
stead of attacking our production and 
fueling inflation, we would be better 
positioned to push back on Putin at a 
less painful cost to American families. 
The President’s team wants to pre-
tend this lengthy problem only started 
2 weeks ago, but American families 
have been paying for Democrats’ bad 
policies for a lot longer than that. 
f 
GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on another matter, yesterday, the 
House passed a bipartisan, bicameral 
government funding agreement that 
will enable crucial investments in our 
national 
defense. 
Putin’s 
war 
on 
Ukraine is just one manifestation of 
the major long-term threats to Amer-
ican security and American interests 
posed by major competing powers like 
Russia and China. 
So, absolutely, we must rapidly fund 
the urgent assistance that Ukraine and 
our allies along NATO’s eastern flank 
need right now, but we must also make 
the investments in military moderniza-
tion that will equip America to achieve 
peace through strength for years and 
decades to come. 
Our military commanders have clear-
ly and consistently told us they cannot 
rebuild and modernize our military to 
meet the growing threats if Congress 
lets defense funding sleepwalk from 
one continuing resolution to another. 
The world is a dangerous place. It is 
growing more dangerous every day. 
The road to peace runs through Amer-
ican power. We all know it is true, so 
we have to budget accordingly. 
Our recent negotiations put us Re-
publicans in the surreal position of 
having to push a Commander in Chief’s 
party into giving his own commanders 
the funding they need. But, over many 
Democrats’ 
objections, 
Republicans 
made sure this deal gets the job done 
for our Armed Forces. 
The compromise product provides 
significantly more money than the 
Biden administration had requested for 
defense and significantly less than they 
requested for nondefense. 
Until 24 hours ago, this compromise 
was also going to reprogram money 
away from Democrats’ wasteful spend-
ing spree that neglected COVID needs 
and reallocate it to vaccines and treat-
ment for the American people, but 
House 
Democrats 
mutinied 
against 
Speaker PELOSI. The far left would 
rather preserve State and local bureau-
crats’ giant slush funds than fund vac-
cines and therapeutics for our citizens, 
so the COVID component has fallen 
out. 
Overall, this agreement checks the 
three boxes I laid out months ago. The 
bill maintains parity between defense 
and nondefense spending growth. It 
maintains 
longstanding 
bipartisan 
policies, such as protecting taxpayers 
against funding abortions and being po-
litically targeted by the IRS. And new 
far-left poison pills were cut out. But 
more urgently, amidst this war in Eu-
rope, this agreement delivers aid the 
Ukrainians need right now and a down-
payment on our commitment to keep 
defending America and global peace in 
the years to come. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Madam President, 
on one final matter, over the last few 
days, the Biden administration’s con-
fusing mismanagement and mixed sig-
nals surrounding the Ukraine crisis 
and the West’s response have again 
spilled out into open public view. 
Here is the pattern. Time and time 
again throughout this crisis and in the 
months preceding it, the administra-
tion’s first instinct has been to resist 
strong and decisive steps. The Presi-
dent and his team initially take a pass 
on strong steps when they could have 
been put into place proactively and had 
a real deterrent effect, but then, after 
sustained public pressure, they buckle 
and implement the steps anyway, often 
too late. This ‘‘leading from behind’’ 
leaves us in a lose-lose scenario. 
The pattern has played out yet again 
with this bizarre argument over MiG 
airplanes that President Biden’s team 
has carried out in public with our Pol-
ish allies. 
The mere fact that Biden administra-
tion officials are contradicting not 
only each other but also our NATO al-
lies in public like this evidences a se-
vere lack of the coordination and 
proactive leadership that we should 
be—us, 
Americans—should 
be 
pro-
viding. This isn’t limited to just these 
Polish planes; there are all manner of 
different systems, tools, and arms that 
our eastern flank allies and partners 
could be providing more readily to the 
brave Ukrainians. This would take 
American leadership and coordination 
and an American commitment that we 
will help them replace their Soviet-era 
stocks with American and Western 
military technology. 
The loan guarantees we included in 
the supplemental appropriations bill 
will give the administration a tool to 
do just this—help eastern flank NATO 
partners use their own money to mod-
ernize their defensive capabilities. This 
would be a win for Ukraine, a win for 
us, and a win for NATO. 
These kinds of steps should be no- 
brainers for a confident, assertive, and 
decisive American administration. In-
stead, it repeatedly seems like the ad-
ministration’s 
first 
instinct 
is 
to 
flinch—to 
flinch—wait 
for 
inter-
national and public pressure to over-
whelm them, and then take action only 
after the most opportune moment has 
nearly passed us by. 
Nobody wants an escalation, but if 
the administration keeps repeating 
this pattern of self-deterrence, of con-
vincing itself that any proactive step 
would be irresponsible, they are just 
internalizing Putin’s false premise and 
amplifying Putin’s false equivalence. 
Remember this: Strength is not a 
provocation. The world needs President 
Biden and his team to be leading, tak-
ing the initiative, and shaping cir-
cumstances calmly, soberly, but with 
confidence and decisiveness. They seem 
to be trapped in a cycle of passivity, in-
decision, self-deterrence, and then, fi-
nally, reaction. The world needs the 
Biden administration to be flying this 
plane. Too often, it feels like the plane 
is flying them. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
RUSSIA 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is 
interesting to listen to the reaction to 
the notion that we are going to stop 
our dependence on Russian oil. I to-
tally support that. The notion that I 
would buy gasoline in my hometown 
and put it in my car or truck and 
somehow 
subsidize 
what 
Vladimir 
Putin is doing in the rape of Ukraine is 
just unacceptable. I believe there is not 
only a moral force but a political force 
behind this. Morally, there is no way 
we are going to support Putin. Politi-
cally, we have to come together with 
other nations and make this as painful 
as possible on him, and stopping the 
import of Russian oil is a move in that 
direction.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1072 
March 10, 2022 
It is interesting that that was a bi-
partisan position which I joined over 
the weekend—many of us did—Demo-
crats 
and 
Republicans 
all 
saying: 
Enough with the Russian oil. We will 
find other ways to keep America’s 
economy and cars and trucks moving 
without being dependent on Vladimir 
Putin or subsidizing his war effort. 
It was bipartisan—strong statements. 
In fact, there were as many statements 
in support of this from the other side of 
the aisle as this side of the aisle. Then 
what happened? Well, Dana Milbank, in 
this morning’s Washington Post, tells 
the story of what happened. 
After President Biden made his an-
nouncement Tuesday, he said, accu-
rately: 
‘‘Since Putin began his military buildup on 
Ukrainian borders, just since then, [it is 2 
weeks] the price of gas at the pump in Amer-
ica went up 75 cents. And with this action 
[the Americans will stop buying Russian oil] 
it’s going to go up further.’’ [President 
Biden] dubbed it ‘‘Putin’s price hike’’ and 
said ‘‘Russia is responsible.’’ 
Since this was a bipartisan idea— 
stopping the flow of Russian oil into 
the United 
States and subsidizing 
Putin’s 
invasion 
of 
Ukraine—you 
would think there would be bipartisan 
applause. The exact opposite occurred. 
In a Dana Milbank article, which I 
will ask to be part of the RECORD, here 
is what was said by House Republican 
Leader KEVIN MCCARTHY: 
‘‘These aren’t Putin prices. They’re Presi-
dent Biden’s prices’’. . . . ‘‘Gas prices started 
rising the day President Biden took office— 
when he canceled the Keystone Pipeline and 
halted new drilling on federal lands.’’ 
It turns out that these assertions, by 
not just KEVIN MCCARTHY but other Re-
publican leaders, are just not accurate. 
Nobody goes to the task and assign-
ment of actually backing up some of 
these facts like real history and real 
numbers. 
Here is what he says: Gas prices 
started rising on the day that Biden 
took office. 
Wrong. 
They have been on an upward trend 
since bottoming out in April 2020, at 
the start of the coronavirus pandemic. 
This is because of booming demand 
during the recovery. So this notion 
that these are Biden gas prices that 
just started going up magically after 
he was sworn—not true. 
Then I love this one on the Keystone 
XL Pipeline. How many times have you 
heard on the floor of the Senate— 
maybe even this morning—that can-
celing the Keystone Pipeline is the rea-
son that gasoline prices have gone up? 
It turns out, according to Dana 
Milbank, that pipeline was only 10 per-
cent completed when Biden canceled it. 
Its owners didn’t even expect to open it 
until next year, 2023, at the earliest. 
Well, how about this one? You hear 
this over and over again from so many 
Republicans: Biden halted new drilling 
on Federal lands, they say. According 
to Milbank: 
Wrong. After a temporary halt in new 
leases, Biden has outpaced Trump in new 
drilling permits for public lands. 
That has been reported by the Wash-
ington Post. 
And as for Biden’s shutdown of Amer-
ican energy, listen to this: 
U.S. production has increased under Biden 
from 9.7 million barrels a day to 11.6 million 
barrels. The number of oil rigs operating was 
172 in July of 2020. . . . Now, 519 are in oper-
ation. U.S. production is forecast to set a 
record next year. 
Now, I don’t doubt that stopping the 
Russian export of oil into the United 
States is going to have a negative im-
pact on gasoline prices. It stands to 
reason. But there is an adjustment 
being made. The President spoke to it 
last night, at a meeting we attended, 
where he is working on other sources 
for America to make this hardship as 
little as possible. 
I ask unanimous consent that the 
Milbank article be printed in the 
RECORD. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Washington Post] 
BIDEN HEEDED REPUBLICANS’ PLEAS TO BAN 
RUSSIAN OIL. THEN THEY POUNCED 
(By Dana Milbank) 
A cynic is rarely disappointed by this Re-
publican Party. Yet even by that standard, 
the current attempt to blame President 
Biden—and absolve Vladimir Putin—for the 
spike in gas prices is a special case. 
For days, Republicans called for a ban on 
imports of Russian oil, a move that, while 
the right thing to do to counter Putin’s at-
tack against Ukraine, would cause already 
high gas prices to rise even further. Biden 
did as Republicans wanted—and they re-
sponded by blaming his energy policies for 
spiking gas prices. 
It’s not only that the charge is bogus—the 
current price of gas has virtually nothing to 
do with Biden’s energy policies—but that the 
Republican officials leveling it are sowing di-
vision at home and giving a rhetorical boost 
to the enemy at a perilous moment when na-
tional unity and sacrifice will be needed to 
prevail against Russia. 
Announcing the ban on Tuesday, Biden 
said, accurately: ‘‘Since Putin began his 
military buildup on Ukrainian borders, just 
since then, the price of the gas at the pump 
in America went up 75 cents. And with this 
action, it’s going to go up further.’’ He 
dubbed it ‘‘Putin’s price hike’’ and said 
‘‘Russia is responsible.’’ 
REPUBLICANS LEAPED TO PUTIN’S DEFENSE 
‘‘These aren’t Putin prices. They’re Presi-
dent Biden’s prices,’’ House GOP leader 
Kevin McCarthy said during a news con-
ference 
on 
Wednesday. 
Via 
tweet, 
he 
claimed: ‘‘Gas prices started rising the day 
President Biden took office—when he can-
celed the Keystone Pipeline and halted new 
drilling on federal lands.’’ 
Rep. Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), head of the 
House Republican Conference, added: ‘‘Joe 
Biden blames Russia for skyrocketing gas 
prices. But make no mistake—Biden’s war on 
American energy is to blame.’’ 
Scores of Republicans piled on. The GOP 
side of the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee tweeted: ‘‘Russia isn’t ‘respon-
sible’. Biden’s shutdown of American energy 
is.’’ 
That’s just a gusher of mendacity. 
Gas prices ‘‘started rising the day Presi-
dent Biden took office’’? Wrong. They’ve 
been on an upward trend since bottoming out 
in April 2020 at the start of the coronavirus 
pandemic. This is because of booming de-
mand during the recovery—not because of 
Biden’s 
policies 
(or 
President 
Donald 
Trump’s, for that matter). 
Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline caused 
gas prices to rise? Wrong. It was only 10 per-
cent done when Biden canceled it, and its 
owners didn’t expect to open it until 2023 at 
the earliest. 
Biden ‘‘halted new drilling on federal 
lands’’? Wrong. After a temporary halt in 
new leases, Biden has outpaced Trump in 
new drilling permits for public lands, The 
Post reported. 
As for Biden’s ‘‘shutdown of American en-
ergy,’’ U.S. production has increased under 
Biden from 9.7 million barrels a day to 11.6 
million barrels. The number of oil rigs oper-
ating was at 172 in July 2020, E&E News re-
ports. Now, 519 are in operation. U.S. produc-
tion is forecast to set a record next year. 
What’s holding back oil production isn’t 
government policy. U.S. producers still have 
4,400 wells already approved and drilled that 
are not yet producing. They aren’t drilling 
more because of a shortage of workers and 
equipment 
and, 
particularly, 
investors’ 
greed. As The Post reported, major U.S. oil 
companies say they would rather use their 
profits ‘‘to boost payouts to shareholders’’ 
than ‘‘rush to drill new wells.’’ 
Blaming Biden for the spike in prices 
around Russia’s Ukraine invasion isn’t just 
false—it’s an assist to Putin that damages 
national security. 
Polls show that Americans—Republicans 
and Democrats alike—favor banning Russian 
oil imports, even if that increases energy 
prices. Seventy-nine percent said so in a 
Wall Street Journal poll this week. Ameri-
cans know the stakes, and they are willing 
to sacrifice. 
But what happens if Republican lawmakers 
and their Fox News masters persuade their 
supporters to believe that Biden, not Putin, 
is to blame for their problems? Their willing-
ness to sacrifice dissipates—and so does their 
support for the fight against Putin. 
It’s lucky this hasn’t happened already. 
Fox News’s Tucker Carlson, after parroting 
Kremlin talking points justifying its inva-
sion of Ukraine, has pivoted to blaming the 
United States for provoking Putin. ‘‘Why in 
the world would the United States inten-
tionally seek war with Russia?’’ he asked on 
Monday night. 
Trump himself has praised Putin’s acuity, 
Sen. Josh Hawley (R–Mo.) has called for the 
United States to appease Russia by aban-
doning its support for Ukrainian membership 
in NATO, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene 
(R–Ga.), after proposing to impeach Biden for 
‘‘threatening war’’ with Russia, now asks: 
‘‘How is banning Russian oil (10 percent of 
our imports) helping reduce gas prices hurt-
ing Americans?’’ 
Fighting Russian aggression while avoid-
ing World War III is hard enough. With Re-
publicans acting in bad faith, it’s that much 
harder.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, finally, 
an omnibus spending bill. For months, 
there have been negotiations under-
way. The process has been drawn out. 
As a member of the Appropriations 
Committee, there was a lot of frustra-
tion. But soon we are going to vote on 
an omnibus spending package, and we 
are going to do much more than keep 
the lights on in our government. 
In many ways, this spending package 
is a testament to the progress we have

March 10, 2022 
made during the past year of the 
Democratic majority. We have historic 
funding to reduce the cost of living for 
working families. We get it; American 
families are having a tough time mak-
ing ends meet and are living paycheck 
to paycheck. We take action in this 
omnibus spending bill to start to ad-
dress that challenge, and we create 
good jobs here in America. Isn’t it 
about time we focus on making things 
in America, putting people to work 
with good jobs that supply them? And 
we need to ensure families and children 
can access critical supplies, like nutri-
tious food and clean water that they 
need to survive. 
This bill also provides more than $13 
billion to the Ukrainians fighting 
tooth and nail to defend their freedom. 
The Democratic Senate caucus was for-
tunate last night to have over an hour 
and a half with the President where he 
spoke candidly and informally about 
the challenge we face in Ukraine. We 
have sent millions—maybe billions of 
dollars—in assistance to those who are 
resisting Vladimir Putin’s barbaric at-
tack on that nation, and we know that 
it is the right thing to do. There are 
displays of courage by the Ukrainians 
the likes of which we haven’t seen in 
modern times. President Zelenskyy, 
particularly, has impressed not only 
the United States but the world with 
his singular courage. 
The funds we are putting in this bill 
will help Ukrainians on the frontline to 
continue to hold back Vladimir Putin, 
and on the ground, in the air, through 
cyberspace, as well as helping our 
NATO allies in the region. NATO has 
never been stronger—30 different coun-
tries standing together, shoulder to 
shoulder, to stop Vladimir Putin’s in-
vasion. 
The omnibus spending package, also, 
makes crucial investments in America 
at a time when we need it. It will fund 
research into the technologies and in-
novations. Innovation is an American 
phenomenon. Other countries do it, but 
I think we do it better. And whether we 
are curing a disease, creating a new in-
dustry, or combating the climate cri-
sis, America needs to continue to lead 
the world in innovation. This spending 
bill does that. 
At a moment of great peril and un-
certainty in the world, we are coming 
together to defend our families, our se-
curity, our economy, and our future. 
But we need to move fast. We need to 
send this package to President Biden’s 
desk quickly. 
For the past 2 weeks, Russian mor-
tars and missiles have been raining 
down on innocent people and children 
throughout Ukraine. More than 400 in-
dividuals have been killed, with some 
estimates in the thousands of deaths, 
believing that the current numbers are 
really an undercount. 
Let me say one word while we are on 
the subject of Vladimir Putin and war 
crimes. What more evidence do you 
need than the bombing of a maternity 
hospital and the killing of mothers and 
infants? This man, Putin, and his at-
tack on the Ukrainian people, is not 
following any standards or rules of de-
cent conduct in any way whatsoever. I 
think it is obvious. 
Yesterday, the Russian airstrike that 
devastated the hospital complex in 
Mariupol is an indication that we will 
never forget. A video released shortly 
after the bombing showed a pregnant 
woman 
being 
carried 
away 
on 
a 
stretcher, surrounded by pulverized 
cars in flames and blackened trees cov-
ered in debris. It was a scene from a 
horror movie—a horror created by 
Vladimir Putin. 
Ukraine needs humanitarian, mili-
tary, and economic aid today. That is 
exactly what this omnibus bill will pro-
vide—billions of dollars in military 
equipment and intelligence support and 
even more billions in emergency sup-
plies, food aid, healthcare, migration, 
and refugee assistance. 
This is how America stands by our 
fellow defenders of democracy at their 
darkest hour, and Ukraine needs our 
help. 
Here at home, the spending package 
includes a number of provisions that 
will strengthen America and the 330 
million Americans who live here. We 
are bringing vital investments back to 
our home States. I support the return 
of congressionally directed funding, be-
cause Senators and Representatives 
know their States and know their dis-
tricts better than any Federal Agency 
personnel in Washington. 
I am pleased to report that my col-
league, Senator TAMMY
DUCKWORTH, 
and I worked to include $210 million in 
funding for Illinois projects in this bill; 
and I will be ready to stand up and de-
fend every single one of them piece by 
piece, project by project, as a good in-
vestment in the future of my State and 
our Nation. 
This funding is going to help local-
ities in Illinois launch important infra-
structure, access to healthcare, envi-
ronmental conservation, strengthening 
community violence prevention initia-
tives, supporting nonprofits doing im-
portant work through our State, and 
much more. 
We also do something that I have 
worked on personally for the last sev-
eral months and that I am particularly 
proud of; we are going to reauthorize 
the Violence Against Women Act, 
known as VAWA. For months, I have 
worked on this proposal with some 
amazing people in the U.S. States Sen-
ate. On my side of the aisle, Senator 
DIANNE FEINSTEIN really was one of the 
founders of this effort. On the Repub-
lican side of the aisle, two women Sen-
ators have just been amazing—LISA 
MURKOWSKI of Alaska and JONI ERNST 
of Iowa. We wouldn’t have passed this 
bill and included it in this appropria-
tions measure were it not for their 
good effort; and I thank them very 
much. They have helped to provide a 
lifeline to survivors of sexual and do-
mestic violence. 
With this year’s spending package, 
Congress will finally reauthorize the 
Violence Against Women Act. 
Additionally, the omnibus includes 
funding for a longstanding priority of 
mine: research. These investments in 
research are going to help keep Amer-
ica on the cutting edge of innovation 
when it comes to lifesaving medical 
treatment, therapies, and so much 
more. For example, this bill provides 
the National Institutes of Health with 
a significant funding increase—this 
time, a $2.25 billion increase; that is 
more than 5 percent. Five percent, I 
have kind of established—and, I hope, 
with some of my colleagues—as the 
Holy Grail of increases each year in re-
search, particularly at the NIH. And 
with the good help of Republican Sen-
ator—retiring Senator, unfortunately— 
ROY BLUNT of Missouri, we have man-
aged to keep our promise. Lamar Alex-
ander, now retired from the Senate, 
was one of the leaders on this issue. 
And PATTY MURRAY is always there 
from the State of Washington. Well, we 
are going to keep our word again this 
year. 
Basic medical research, which the 
United States leads the world in, is 
going to be enhanced with this im-
provement of more than 5 percent in-
crease in the budget of the National In-
stitutes of Health. 
I am particularly pleased that this 
omnibus bill includes a dedicated $25 
million for the implementation of the 
ACT for ALS bill, which became law 
late last year. I want to thank Senator 
COONS for his leadership on that issue. 
This funding will ensure that NIH can 
quickly launch new initiatives to ex-
pand access to treatments for those 
suffering from ALS. 
Sadly, I am disappointed to say that 
the package does not include COVID 
relief. We are at a turning point in this 
pandemic. New cases of COVID are at 
their lowest rates in more than 7 
months, praise the Lord; and parents 
and families are just as anxious as can 
be to get their kids back in school and 
life back to normal. These are prom-
ising developments—from vaccines to 
better treatments—but we cannot pre-
tend that this pandemic is over for 
good, nor that it won’t resurface in 
terms of new variants. We need to pre-
pare for whatever the coronavirus 
might have in store for us. We need to 
make sure we have the therapeutics 
and strengthen our capacity to detect 
new variants before they become pan-
demic. 
Given the dire urgency of the situa-
tion in Ukraine, I understand we sim-
ply don’t have time to go back to the 
bargaining table, but many of us still 
believe that a toolkit to deal with fu-
ture infections in COVID or the next 
pandemic is absolutely essential. I can 
only hope the Senate agrees with that 
on a bipartisan basis. 
Two years into this pandemic, we 
know this virus is anything but pre-
dictable. It operates like free-form 
jazz. Just when we think we have found

our rhythm, the tempo gets turned up-
side down with a new variant. This cur-
rent lull in cases is the perfect moment 
to tune up our instruments, keep our 
fingers sharp, and prepare for whatever 
is next. 
Let me close by saying that, aside 
from the omission of additional COVID 
relief, there is much to celebrate in 
this spending package. It is an example 
of what Congress can achieve when it 
works together. 
In the face of Russia’s horrible inva-
sion of Ukraine, an invasion that has 
already created 2 million Ukrainian 
refugees, we are standing together in 
defense of democracy. Russia’s inva-
sion is a tragic illustration of one 
man’s mania and of a conflict that will 
define the 21st century if we don’t stop 
it in its tracks. Right now, Putin is 
waging yesterday’s war with yester-
day’s goal of reestablishing the Soviet 
Union. He is sending ill-equipped teen-
agers in Russian Army uniforms into 
Ukraine to terrorize innocent families 
and bomb children in hospitals, all in 
some delusional effort that he is going 
to create the new Russian Empire, with 
him being installed as the Czar of that 
enterprise. He is not willing to face the 
challenges of the New World. So he is 
trying to revive the Old World. 
Autocrats like Putin live in fear of 
the future. Democracies like America 
welcome it because we know that the 
future represents an opportunity to 
build a better world for everyone. That 
is precisely why President Zelenskyy 
and every Ukrainian is fighting to pro-
tect their country. They are pro-
tecting, as well, the freedom to shape 
their own future, not to have their fu-
ture dictated by a man like Vladimir 
Putin. 
With the spending package before the 
Senate, we can begin building our own 
future as well—a future made in Amer-
ica. 
Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
SCHATZ). The Senator from Iowa. 
f 
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it 
has been a year since we in the Senate 
confirmed Merrick Garland to be At-
torney General. 
During his confirmation hearing, I 
outlined what a successful Department 
of Justice looks like and what I ex-
pected of him as our new Attorney 
General. I gave him the answers to the 
tests. By this rubric, he has failed. For 
instance, I urged him to build off the 
successes from the previous Justice De-
partment to reduce crime, maintain 
the rule of law, and protect our civil 
liberties. But violent crime continues 
to rise, the rule of law is undermined, 
and our civil liberties are in danger. 
Instead of condemning all violent 
crime, Attorney General Garland’s Jus-
tice Department targets lawful gun 
owners and blames those gun owners 
for 
the 
rising 
murder 
rates, 
carjackings, and attacks against law 
enforcement. 
But the explosion of crime in blue 
cities is actually tied to depolicing 
measures, hiring progressive prosecu-
tors, and enacting disastrous bail re-
form policies. Lawful gun owners are 
not to blame for this rise in crime. 
And in the midst of a crime spike, a 
number of Biden appointees and judi-
cial nominees strongly backed by At-
torney General Garland have supported 
radical 
ideas 
in 
the 
past, 
like 
defunding the police or at least reduc-
ing funding for police. And some have 
even advocated not prosecuting certain 
crimes. So how do you expect to effec-
tively fight crime with the lineup that 
I just gave you? 
Instead of tackling the opioid crisis, 
the Garland Justice Department wants 
to make it easier for fentanyl traf-
fickers 
to 
spread 
their 
poison. 
Fentanyl analogs are responsible for 
most overdose deaths and are lethal in 
very tiny amounts, as we all know. But 
the Garland and Biden administration 
support eliminating mandatory mini-
mums for these fentanyl analog deal-
ers. Really? 
In addition, Garland has wielded his 
power to undermine the rule of law and 
cave to political pressures. The Attor-
ney General has summarily reversed a 
number of decisions issued by Attor-
neys General Sessions and Barr that 
helped enhance the integrity of our 
asylum system. 
This 
Attorney 
General 
has 
also 
issued memos, interpretations, and fil-
ings to the Supreme Court that con-
trast with previous Department of Jus-
tice positions. 
Let me give you an example. His De-
partment of Justice reinterpreted the 
law to make sure that inmates released 
to home confinement under COVID re-
lief stay there. His Solicitor General 
also switched positions on a cocaine 
sentencing case that was before the Su-
preme Court. Now, it happens that both 
of these policy outcomes align with my 
positions. I agree with those outcomes. 
But his way of getting there is polit-
ical. Rule of law must be consistent 
and not political. 
So Garland’s flip-flopping also jeop-
ardizes our Nation’s security. Instead 
of protecting the American people from 
the Chinese Communist Party’s espio-
nage, he disbanded the previous admin-
istration’s successful China Initiative. 
This program prioritized investigations 
of national security from China, which 
is still a very serious threat given that 
the FBI opens a new Chinese espionage 
case every 12 hours. So I don’t know 
why this would be disbanded. This 
move is concerning and dangerous to 
our national security and reflective of 
partisan pressures trumping smart law 
enforcement. 
Also, political decisions are getting 
in the way of the consistent applica-
tion of the rule of law. For example, 
Attorney General Garland’s Depart-
ment of Justice is politically selective 
about which cases to pursue and which 
cases to dismiss. Despite the 100-night 
siege against the Portland courthouse 
in 2020 and 96 people being charged as 
violent rioters, almost half of those 
charged have been dismissed. 
Compare this to the Department of 
Justice’s own statement on the 1-year 
anniversary of January 6: 
The Department of Justice’s resolve to 
hold 
accountable 
those 
who 
committed 
crimes on Jan. 6, 2021, has not, and will not, 
wane. 
Now, we all know that those who 
break the law should be held account-
able—no question about that. And as 
our Nation’s top law enforcement offi-
cer, it is incumbent upon him to en-
force the rule of law. He cannot pick 
and choose when the rule of law is po-
litically convenient or easy. 
Under Garland’s leadership, the De-
partment of Justice is also under-
mining valuable civil rights. This is 
something that he and I have had a lot 
of discussions on as he has appeared be-
fore our committee. 
So undermining valuable civil rights, 
instead of prioritizing that, Attorney 
General Garland has killed the speech 
of American parents. He sent a memo 
to the FBI and the U.S. attorneys 
around the country to be on the look-
out for upset parents at school boards. 
He did this after the National School 
Boards 
Association 
suggested 
that 
some people should be branded domes-
tic terrorists. Imagine that charge— 
that you go to a school board meeting, 
you might be a domestic terrorist. 
What is even worse, there seems to be 
some evidence that the Secretary of 
Education may have asked the Na-
tional School Boards Association to 
write that awful letter, which the asso-
ciation later had to apologize for. Gar-
land says his memo was just about vio-
lence and threats of violence; but sure 
enough, whistleblower reports show 
that the FBI’s counterterrorism divi-
sion was looking way beyond only vio-
lence and threats. Parents’ ability to 
voice their concerns, especially now, is 
a precious right, and the Department 
of Justice’s actions cannot kill such 
vital speech constitutionally protected 
by the First Amendment. 
Also, instead of being responsive, the 
Attorney General has been evasive. 
Last year, I sent approximately 50 let-
ters to the Department. That is one- 
third of all letters that they received 
from Members of the U.S. Senate. 
The Attorney General wanted me to 
know that I sent one-third of all the 
letters he got from the other 99 Sen-
ators. So when the Attorney General 
told me that, I don’t think he meant it 
as a compliment. 
I received some letters in response. 
However, when I am told that they 
have responded to me, simple or lots of 
words on a piece of paper don’t, in and 
of themselves, make a letter respon-
sive. 
Furthermore, the Department has 
failed to provide responsive records, 
with the exception of one or two small 
productions. By way of example, I re-
ceived a 30-page production of records 
from the Department. It included im-
proper FOIA redactions and failed to

include the necessary spreadsheets. Ac-
cordingly, that production is a failed 
production because FOIA does not 
apply to documents going to the Con-
gress of the United States, so you 
shouldn’t have that redaction. 
Also, I have repeatedly asked if Nich-
olas McQuaid is recused from the Hun-
ter Biden criminal investigation, and 
that is an important thing because he 
seemed to work in the law firm that 
was representing Hunter Biden. And it 
ought to be a simple question to an-
swer, but Attorney General Garland re-
fuses to tell me whether McQuaid is 
recused from those cases. 
At the Judiciary Committee’s Octo-
ber 27, 2021, Justice Department over-
sight hearing, I said to Attorney Gen-
eral Garland: 
When I placed holds on your nominees for 
the Department’s failure to comply with Re-
publican oversight requests, I said either you 
run the Department or the Department runs 
you. Right now, it looks like the Justice De-
partment is running you. 
That ends my quote of October 27 
last year. 
So that statement still holds true. 
Instead of protecting the American 
people, the Attorney General is sacri-
ficing our Nation’s top law enforce-
ment agency to politics during a vio-
lent crime spike. Instead of being stew-
ards of our Nation’s laws, the Attorney 
General is leading the charge upending 
the rule of law. Instead of fighting for 
civil rights, he is chipping away at 
those civil rights. 
Attorney General Garland, there is 
still time to change. You have 3 years 
left in this administration. I urge you 
to change course. I urge you to bring 
the Justice Department back to a place 
of leadership: leadership in reducing 
violent crime, leadership in maintain-
ing the rule of law, and leadership in 
protecting our civil liberties. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the hu-
manitarian crisis in Ukraine continues 
to escalate. Americans who walked by 
a newsstand on Monday were met with 
the wrenching picture of a Ukrainian 
family killed by Russian shelling, a 
mom and her two children struck down 
as they attempted to flee along a main 
evacuation route from Irpin to Kyiv, 
an 
evacuation 
route 
that 
Russia 
shelled. 
Yesterday, the world saw pictures of 
the devastation after a maternity hos-
pital in Mariupol, Ukraine—maternity 
hospital—fell victim to a Russian air 
strike. 
President Zelenskyy reported that 
there were children buried under the 
rubble—children. 
One newspaper reported: 
The bombing took place during what was 
supposed to be a ceasefire in Mariupol so 
that civilians could evacuate. It marks the 
fourth time a so-called ‘humanitarian cor-
ridor’ out of the city has failed because Rus-
sian forces opened fire. 
‘‘[T]he fourth time a so-called ‘hu-
manitarian corridor’ out of the city 
has 
failed 
because 
Russian 
forces 
opened fire.’’ 
‘‘Opened fire’’ on civilians, on par-
ents trying to save their children, this 
is what Russia is doing. 
The scenes in Ukraine are unreal. 
They are scenes that we thought had 
finally been left behind in the dust of 
European history: devastated cities, 
apartment buildings with their sides 
sheared off, the smoking ruins of 
homes and businesses, a school reduced 
to rubble, mass graves. 
In 2 short weeks, Vladimir Putin has 
wrought an unimaginable amount of 
devastation. The damage he has done 
will take years, if not decades, to re-
build. The scars may last much longer. 
And for what, Mr. President? For 
what? For one man’s vision of a Rus-
sian Empire. Vladimir Putin wants 
Ukraine, and he is apparently willing 
to destroy Ukraine to get it—destroy 
Ukraine and devastate his own nation, 
because Russia is suffering too because 
of Putin’s war of aggression. 
There are no smoking ruins of apart-
ment buildings in Russia, but there is 
the senseless waste of so many young 
Russian lives, soldiers and conscripts 
sent to die in Ukraine for a war that is 
not their own. There is Putin’s brutal 
crackdown on protesters and journal-
ists, and there is the economic devasta-
tion his nation will suffer—is already 
suffering—as a result of sanctions and 
companies’ decisions to pull out of 
Russia to protest its unprovoked at-
tack on Ukraine. Vladimir Putin is 
laying waste to two countries. 
These 
have 
been 
dark 
days 
for 
Ukraine, 
but 
the 
devastation 
in 
Ukraine has been met with determina-
tion. This is Ukrainians’ fight, and 
they are not shrinking from it. The 
Washington 
Post 
recently 
reported 
that more than 66,000 Ukrainians who 
were outside the country have returned 
to answer President Zelenskyy’s call to 
arms. That is 66,000 Ukrainians who 
could 
have 
sat 
in 
safety 
outside 
Ukraine who have returned to help de-
fend their country. 
Outnumbered 
as 
they 
are, 
the 
Ukrainian people are standing fast, and 
they are slowing down and in many 
places holding off the Russians. Sol-
diers and civilians alike have taken up 
arms to defend their nation, and it is 
clear that the spirit of Ukraine, now 
roused, will not be quenched. 
No matter the resolve of the Ukrain-
ian people, Ukraine cannot hold out 
alone. Without military, intelligence, 
and humanitarian support from other 
free nations, Ukraine may fall. We 
can’t sit by and let that happen. 
Congress is currently considering leg-
islation to send additional military and 
humanitarian aid to Ukraine. I hope 
that we will be able to take a vote on 
this and very, very soon. As I have said 
before, the United States was too slow 
to send aid to Ukraine and sanction 
Putin in the lead-up to Russia’s attack. 
We can’t afford to make the same mis-
take again. 
I commend President Biden for doing 
the right thing this week and banning 
American imports of Russian energy. 
Every dollar we send to Russia to pur-
chase energy is a dollar that Russia 
can 
use 
to 
prosecute 
its 
war 
in 
Ukraine. 
Now, we need to focus on developing 
our energy resources here at home, all 
of them—all of them, conventional and 
alternative—to ensure that our Nation 
never again has to depend on countries 
like Russia for essential energy sup-
plies. We should also take this oil ban 
a step further by enacting the bipar-
tisan Crapo-Wyden bill to suspend per-
manent normal trade relations with 
Russia and Belarus. 
The bill would also direct the U.S. 
Trade Representative to seek to sus-
pend Russia from the World Trade Or-
ganization. A nation that flouts the 
rules and makes a mockery of diplo-
macy should not enjoy a seat at the 
table. 
I 
heard 
directly 
from 
President 
Zelenskyy in a Zoom call Saturday, 
and he made a powerful appeal for help 
from the West. Among other things, 
President Zelenskyy requested that we 
help close the skies over Ukraine. 
One solution that has been offered to 
help protect Ukrainian airspace is for 
Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Slo-
vakia to provide their MiG–29 jets to 
Ukraine. We need to do everything that 
we can to help Ukraine in this fight, 
including helping to pave the way for 
Ukraine to get the air defense re-
sources it needs. 
Poland has stepped up and expressed 
a willingness to provide the MiGs, but 
we now find ourselves at a dead end as 
to how to facilitate the transfer to 
Ukraine. We need to find a solution, 
and I encourage the administration to 
find a way to safely navigate the logis-
tics of such a transfer. After all that 
Ukraine has managed to do, it would be 
a tragedy to see the country lose its 
fight because the United States and 
other NATO countries could not agree 
on how to get the Ukrainians the re-
sources they need. 
While we should be cautious about 
what Putin may choose to do as his 
losses grow and his off-ramps dwindle, 
the United States and NATO cannot 
allow Moscow to dictate our actions. 
To do so would not only be to surrender 
Ukraine but to give a green light to 
despotic governments the world over, 
from China to Iran. 
On Saturday, President Zelenskyy 
delivered an address to the Ukrainian 
people. ‘‘Free people of a free country,’’ 
he began. ‘‘Free people of a free coun-
try.’’ That is what Ukrainians are 
fighting for, to be a free people in a 
free country. And I think their fight is 
very close to the hearts of the Amer-
ican people, for after all, for what did 
our forefathers fight but to be a free 
people in a free land, to have the right 
to determine their own destiny and to 
live free of oppression?

S1076 
March 10, 2022 
‘‘Free people of a free country.’’ Long 
may the Ukrainians remain so. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, 
let me thank Senator THUNE for his re-
marks. 
I would simply add that I hope we 
can all keep in our hearts the prospect 
that the Ukrainians might actually 
win this thing, given the success they 
have already seen, as long as they get 
adequate support from us and the 
world community. 
f 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I 
am here for a rather different reason. 
It is to call on this Chamber yet again 
to wake up to the urgent threat of cli-
mate change. 
I wish I was done with these ‘‘Time 
to Wake Up’’ speeches. Frankly, I wish 
I had never had to deliver a single one. 
I wish Congress had dealt with this 
threat—for instance, back when an-
other Senator from Rhode Island, Re-
publican John Chafee, held hearings on 
the looming challenge of carbon diox-
ide pollution. 
I wish we had dealt with it when the 
House, under Speaker PELOSI, passed 
the Waxman-Markey climate change 
bill, only for Majority Leader Harry 
Reid and President Barack Obama to 
kill it in a Democratic Senate with a 
filibuster-proof majority. 
I wish the Citizens United decision 
hadn’t allowed the fossil fuel industry 
to capture the Republican Party and 
kill the bipartisanship on climate that 
existed before that decision in this 
Chamber. 
In my church growing up, there was a 
prayer about things we have left un-
done that we ought to have done. In 
that spirit, here is a graphic on carbon 
emissions we prepared in conjunction 
with the Biden White House that 
charts out where we are on this prob-
lem. 
Green, this line here, is carbon emis-
sions business as usual if we keep kow-
towing to the fossil fuel industry here 
and don’t take serious climate action. 
Orange, this line, with quite signifi-
cant emissions savings, is the Finance 
Committee’s 
climate 
tax 
package. 
That is the effect just of that climate 
tax package if it comes into law. 
Down here is a clean electricity 
standard. If you could put into law a 
national U.S. clean electricity stand-
ard, you could reduce emissions to this 
gray line. 
If you were to combine the two, if 
you were to combine the Finance Com-
mittee tax package and the clean elec-
tricity standard, you push emissions 
down to this yellow line. 
Look at the blue line. This upper 
blue line is the carbon savings from a 
modest price on carbon, one that we 
have discussed and negotiated with the 
White House—$15 per ton in 2023, rising 
to $70 per ton in 2032. Look at how pow-
erful the emissions effect is of that sin-
gle intervention. 
Now, this lowest one that reduces 
emissions the most, this is the safety 
pathway. This dark blue emissions line 
is all of those policies together. That is 
what they add up to. That is what we 
could be doing. We could be creating a 
pathway to safety. 
As these emissions results show, a 
carbon price is the key policy to hit 
the 50-percent emissions reduction tar-
get we have and to get on a pathway to 
safety. Well, that is not happening 
right now. 
So, while fossil fuel-funded Repub-
licans block legislative action on cli-
mate, what could be done through ex-
ecutive action? Regulation. It is not a 
substitute for ambitious legislation, 
but it can make a big difference. 
The EPA has more or less restored 
Obama-era fuel economy and green-
house gas emission standards for cars 
and light trucks. It has a proposal to 
regulate methane leakage from oil and 
gas facilities. It restored an Obama-era 
rule limiting mercury and other toxic 
air pollutants from coal-fired power-
plants. That is all good, but it is a re-
turn to the pre-Trump polluter status 
quo, not progress—not new progress. 
Here is what EPA could still do: 
Start with regulations for big, easily 
identified sources of greenhouse gases, 
not just coal-fired powerplants but 
point sources, including in the indus-
trial sector, which generates more than 
one-fifth of total greenhouse gas emis-
sions. We need a multipronged regu-
latory approach targeting all major 
classes of point sources. 
We need stronger rules for mercury, 
coal ash, soot, and other pollutants. 
Public health demands this, and it is 
even more urgent in light of climate 
change. 
EPA can update the Cross-State Air 
Pollution Rule and tighten National 
Ambient Air Quality Standards. 
We need greenhouse gas emission 
standards for heavy-duty vehicles and 
for aviation. Focusing just on light- 
duty vehicles won’t cut it. 
Over at the Office of Management 
and Budget, they could finish an up-
dated social cost of carbon and issue 
guidance requiring its use through-
out—throughout—Agency 
decision-
making. This is a big one. The social 
cost of carbon calculates the long-term 
damage from carbon pollution, and it 
should figure in permitting, leasing, 
grant-making, 
investments, 
inter-
national development assistance, trade 
agreements, and procurement. 
A Trump judge—likely installed on 
the Federal Bench using fossil fuel 
dark money—just blocked the Obama- 
era social cost of carbon. While that is 
litigated, the administration is cor-
rectly pausing leases, permits, and 
other 
actions 
for 
greenhouse 
gas 
emitters. 
At the Department of Interior, stop 
doling out leases to big polluters. The 
President promised to end new fossil 
fuel leases on public lands and waters, 
so pause them while the social cost of 
carbon is litigated, and review them all 
to make sure that taxpayers are paid 
royalties that reflect the actual cost of 
fossil fuel production and combustion. 
At the Department of Energy, update 
energy efficiency standards for light 
bulbs, washing machines, dryers, dish-
washers, and all the electric appliances 
and products we use every day. There 
is low-hanging fruit there. I hear many 
of these rules are nearly ready but are 
held up in bureaucratic delay. 
Get a move on. 
The Department of Energy should 
also, along with the EPA and the De-
partment of Agriculture, update the re-
newable fuel standards to ensure that 
renewable fuels actually generate con-
siderable emissions reductions. 
Here is another simple one: Federal 
procurement. 
Update Federal acquisition regula-
tions so Agencies price in the cost of 
emissions when they are buying prod-
ucts. Do that, and maybe we wouldn’t 
wind up purchasing Postal Service de-
livery trucks with internal combustion 
engines no more efficient than their 
decades-old 
predecessors. 
Heck, 
we 
might even end up with clean, high- 
performing 
electric 
postal 
trucks. 
There is more to this regulatory list, 
but let me leave it there. 
With 
legislation 
and 
regulation 
ought to come litigation. There are 
States, cities, counties across the 
country 
that 
have 
filed 
lawsuits 
against the fossil fuel industry based 
on local harm suffered as a result of 
climate change, and there is precedent 
for those at the Federal level. 
In 1999, the Justice Department filed 
a civil lawsuit against Big Tobacco and 
its front groups, charging that they 
‘‘engaged in and executed—and con-
tinue to engage in and execute—a mas-
sive 50-year scheme to defraud the pub-
lic.’’ That is the language in the De-
partment of Justice’s complaint. 
Well, it went to trial, and a few years 
later, 
U.S. 
District 
Judge 
Gladys 
Kessler agreed. She found that the to-
bacco industry had ‘‘coordinated sig-
nificant aspects of their public rela-
tions, scientific, legal, and marketing 
activity in furtherance of a shared ob-
jective—to 
. . . 
maximize 
industry 
profits by preserving and expanding the 
market 
for 
cigarettes 
through 
a 
scheme to deceive the public.’’ That is 
the 
language 
in 
the 
decision, 
‘‘a 
scheme to deceive.’’ 
So here is a useful exercise: Pop out 
the word ‘‘cigarettes’’ in that decision, 
and 
drop 
in 
‘‘fossil 
fuel.’’ 
Judge 
Kessler’s finding in the tobacco case 
describes exactly what the fossil fuel 
industry has perpetrated: ‘‘coordinated 
significant aspects of their public rela-
tions, scientific, legal, and marketing 
activity in furtherance of a shared ob-
jective—to 
. . . 
maximize 
industry 
profits by preserving and expanding the 
market for fossil fuels through a 
scheme to deceive the public.’’ 
Nothing—nothing—prevents the De-
partment of Justice from at least in-
vestigating whether to follow its own

successful blueprint; yet nothing has 
been done. 
Progress will be easier on climate if 
we take on the fossil fuel-funded front 
groups that are armed to the teeth 
with dark money political weaponry. 
With proper countermeasures like ex-
posure, we can help achieve victory on 
climate by exposing the rightwing, 
dark money groups fomenting and 
funding climate obstruction very like-
ly as part of a scheme to deceive the 
public. 
I will end with an example from a 
book I read recently about a ship that 
went down. 
In September 1857, the S.S. Central 
America, which was known as the ‘‘Ship 
of Gold,’’ set sail from California to 
New York City with nearly 600 pas-
sengers and crew and 30,000 pounds of 
gold from the California Gold Rush. A 
few hundred miles off the Carolina 
coast, a hurricane hit the S.S. Central 
America. In the teeth of the gales, the 
passengers and crew did everything 
they could. Stewards and waiters and 
other staff were taken off their regular 
duties to fight the storm, to fight the 
flooding. Passengers were put into 
service to save the stricken ship. 
Heavy cargo was thrown overboard. In 
fact, divers are, right now, down, re-
covering the gold that was thrown 
overboard to save the ship. The ship 
itself—its doors and panels—were bro-
ken up to help block the sea out or 
were thrown overboard to lighten the 
stricken ship. At the end—at the end— 
passengers and crew were side by side, 
deep in the hold, shoulder deep in 
water, desperately pumping to save the 
ship. 
The lesson here: The passengers and 
crew did everything they could, but at 
each step, they started too late. They 
ultimately 
took 
all 
the 
necessary 
measures, but each one—each one— 
they took too late, and the ship sank. 
I fear that that is the analogy for our 
present predicament. Indolence in the 
face of known danger is a particularly 
stupid form of cowardice. It is made 
worse here by a fossil fuel industry 
that pays people to block our efforts to 
save the ship. 
For the steamship the S.S. Central 
America, there was another boat that 
stood by in the storm to help rescue 
passengers, and out of the 600 men and 
women on that ship, a few dozen were 
saved. Us? We have no other planet 
standing by. This is our chance for this 
ship of ours, and it is time to wake up. 
It is time to take self-rescue seriously 
by every available means—and fast. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from West Virginia. 
f 
ENERGY POLICIES 
Mrs. CAPITO. Mr. President, I want 
to talk about gas prices. 
The people in West Virginia woke up 
this morning, and according to AAA, 
the average gas price in West Virginia 
is $4.12 per gallon. Some parts of the 
country are paying—probably the part 
that is the Presiding Officer’s coun-
try—more than $5 or even more than $6 
per gallon of regular gas. Just up the 
street here in Washington, DC, at the 
gas station close to the Senate office 
buildings, it is $5.19 per gallon. We have 
surpassed the highest recorded average 
gas prices ever, and that is quite 
alarming. Unfortunately, this has been 
all too predictable given the Biden ad-
ministration’s domestic energy policy 
actions. 
On day one of his Presidency, Presi-
dent Biden managed to immediately 
kill thousands of union jobs and para-
lyze America’s energy industry with 
the Executive orders that killed the 
Keystone XL Pipeline. At peak capac-
ity, this pipeline would have delivered 
830,000 barrels of oil per day to Amer-
ican refineries. It is pretty similar to 
what we are importing from Russia. 
The President put a moratorium on 
all new oil and gas leases on Federal 
lands, moving America from the energy 
superpower that we have been back to 
having an increased reliance on foreign 
adversaries for fuel feedstocks. These 
are countries that have much laxer en-
vironmental rules than we have or that 
we will ever have. 
The administration has also been 
openly anti-pipeline and anti-fossil fuel 
with its rhetoric, through its actions, 
and embodied by the people it has ele-
vated 
to 
unaccountable 
leadership 
roles. Two by name are Gina McCarthy 
and John Kerry. This administration 
has instituted regulatory uncertainty 
at a time of record inflation. 
The administration wants to make a 
new definition of WOTUS, which is a 
rule otherwise known as the waters of 
the United States, to regulate every 
pond and ditch—even on private lands 
all across the country. This will dev-
astate energy production as well as 
hurt sectors like agriculture and home 
building at a time when their products 
are already in high demand and under 
immense inflationary pressures. 
The administration is considering 
new, tighter methane regulations that 
will also raise our energy costs, includ-
ing for home heating and, as we move 
to the next season, for home cooling 
and electricity bills. 
It is revising the NEPA permitting 
process by undoing the streamlining 
that was done during the Trump ad-
ministration. NEPA touches almost 
every single infrastructure project in 
our country. Think about it. We just 
passed 
an 
enormous 
infrastructure 
package, but if you add more and more 
redtape 
onto 
these 
infrastructure 
projects that we have bipartisanly 
passed through here, you are going to 
add more and more costs for producers 
and more and more costs for everyday 
Americans. 
This 
regulatory 
uncer-
tainty is increasing energy prices for 
Americans across the board and is felt 
most acutely at the gas pump because 
we can see it so clearly every time we 
fill up, and we see it posted at the sta-
tions. 
You also have an Energy Department 
that is slow-walking the build-out of 
LNG export terminals, which means we 
can’t export much needed energy to 
our allies as efficiently as we could be. 
Endless regulatory delay and envi-
ronmental lawsuits, including on per-
mits already issued, delay more than 
pipelines and kill more than jobs. We 
have one in West Virginia, the Moun-
tain Valley Pipeline, that is working 
hard to complete the last 5 percent of 
the pipeline to move the product. They 
also crush our economy with inflation 
and leave us and our allies more sus-
ceptible to bad actors like Russia, Ven-
ezuela, and Iran. 
We are seeing the importance of en-
ergy independence play out in realtime 
with the destruction—the horrifying 
destruction—in Ukraine. Because of 
the Biden administration’s policies 
that I just outlined, we are not able to 
immediately provide an energy back-
stop to our European allies that are 
trying to break their Russian oil and 
gas habit. They are begging for our 
coal as we speak. It is the perfect 
storm for a global energy crisis. It al-
most sounds cliche to say, as it has 
been said so often, but energy security 
is our national security. Specifically, 
fossil fuel security will help keep us se-
cure nationally. 
So what is the Biden administration 
doing? 
We have seen reports that the admin-
istration is discussing a possible trip 
soon to Saudi Arabia to convince the 
Kingdom to produce more oil. Well, he 
has tried this—and, oh, by the way, 
they won’t even take the President’s 
phone calls. 
We know the administration is con-
sidering easing sanctions on Venezuela 
so they will produce more oil. 
Once again, President Biden opened 
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even 
though it didn’t work the last time, 
costs the taxpayer, and depletes our 
own stockpile that we created from the 
last oil crisis to be used when the 
United States faces another crisis. But 
incentivizing oil and gas production in 
our own country or letting it move for-
ward? No. 
So, according to the administration 
and its actions, Saudi and Venezuelan 
and OPEC oil is good, but American oil 
is bad. OK. Got it. Rather than encour-
age American oil production, this ad-
ministration would like to line the 
pockets of the Saudis, Nicolas Maduro, 
and, yes, Vladimir Putin. 
You cannot hinder American oil and 
gas production in the name of reducing 
emissions and then nudge countries 
like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to 
produce more. Emissions are emissions, 
no matter where it comes from. Emis-
sions are emissions when it comes to 
global climate change. 
And while I know the climate czar 
John Kerry is disappointed that war in 
Ukraine is distracting people from cli-
mate change—as we see 2 million peo-
ple leaving that beautiful country—I 
don’t see our European friends trying

to secure alternative sources for more 
solar panels. Instead, they are worried 
about access to oil, coal, natural gas, 
and nuclear. That is because wind and 
solar aren’t able to meet their energy 
demands. 
And, sadly, with the energy decisions 
the Biden administration has made, 
American fuel won’t be there to meet 
their needs either. We just don’t have 
the physical infrastructure in place to 
export. We are producing more than we 
ever have—even in this regulatory pur-
gatory—but that just underscores how 
much more we could be doing if the 
Biden administration’s redtape and 
policies were not in place. 
Right now, the world is begging for 
American leadership; Ukraine is beg-
ging for American leadership; Europe is 
begging for American leadership, and 
that includes energy leadership. 
Putin is emboldened every day that 
the Biden administration flails on this 
issue. 
The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine 
is completely heartbreaking. Accord-
ing to the United Nations, as I stated, 
more than 2 million people have been 
forced to leave their homeland. Tens of 
thousands 
of 
Ukrainians 
still 
in 
Ukraine are without food, water, or 
power. We have seen the haunting im-
ages of the bombings of schools, apart-
ments, and hospitals, including, sadly 
and just horrifyingly, a maternity hos-
pital just yesterday. Civilians are being 
targeted. Children are being orphaned. 
It is an absolute atrocity. 
We cannot leave Ukrainian patriots 
and our European allies at the mercy 
of Moscow. We must address the poor 
energy policy decisions of the Biden 
administration in order to unleash full 
American energy production, support 
our allies in Europe, and stop funding 
Putin’s war against Ukrainians. 
We should be acting quickly. The se-
curity of the free world depends on 
this. 
And I thank you for that. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nevada. 
f 
UKRAINE 
Ms. 
ROSEN. 
Mr. 
President, 
for 
weeks, the United States and the world 
have witnessed the horrors that are un-
folding in Ukraine, the result of Rus-
sia’s unprovoked and unjust attacks on 
a sovereign nation and its people. Inno-
cent men, women, and children have 
lost their lives. Homes have been de-
stroyed, neighborhoods and businesses 
obliterated. Families and communities 
have been torn apart, some never to be 
reunited again. 
Let’s be clear: The blame for this 
chaos and devastation falls directly on 
the shoulders of one tyrant—one ty-
rant—Vladimir Putin. And no amount 
of hollow justifications, false equivo-
cations, false flag operations, or out-
right propaganda will change that. 
Putin, you are responsible. Putin, 
you will not prevail. Justice is com-
ing—coming for you and coming for 
your cronies. 
And as appalling as the stories and 
videos of Russia’s brutality have been, 
we have also seen incredible acts of 
heroism, kindness, and patriotism from 
Ukrainian leaders, the military, and, 
well, everyday citizens. The people of 
Ukraine have inspired the entire world 
with their resilience, with their cour-
age, and with their determination to 
live in a free and democratic country. 
This past week, I joined my col-
leagues 
in 
a 
call 
with 
President 
Zelenskyy, and I will say now what we 
said to him then. We are with you. And 
the people from Nevada, we are with 
you too. 
From north to south, Nevadans have 
come together to voice their support 
for the Ukrainian people and their op-
position to Russia’s aggression and 
brutality. Nevadans agree that we 
can’t sit idly by as Putin continues to 
terrorize—terrorize—the 
Ukrainian 
people. The horrific images that the 
world has seen, they require action. 
They require action. We cannot sit idly 
by and do nothing. 
Here in Congress, we are working to 
give Ukraine more security assistance 
and to hold Putin accountable by crip-
pling Russia’s economy. And I call on 
every Senator in this body to vote yes 
on the omnibus package, which in-
cludes 
nearly 
$14 
billion 
to 
aid 
Ukraine’s fight against Putin’s forces 
and to support the Ukrainian people. 
This bipartisan legislation builds on 
the work that Congress and the admin-
istration have been doing over the past 
several weeks to confront Vladimir 
Putin head-on. 
I applaud the Biden administration 
for so forcefully bringing together an 
international coalition of partners, a 
coalition that stands behind Ukraine’s 
cause: the cause for freedom. But we 
must do more. We must do more to 
support Ukraine, to devastate Russia’s 
economy, and to stop Putin’s violent 
attacks. 
President Zelenskyy made it clear in 
our call just this past weekend that 
Ukraine urgently needs fighter jets to 
defend itself. Let’s heed his call and 
work closely together with our Euro-
pean partners that have these jets to 
provide Ukraine with the aircraft they 
desperately need and to find ways to 
compensate or backfill our allies’ sup-
plies. 
We also must continue to strengthen 
the security of our NATO allies and 
demonstrate that the transatlantic 
community remains united. And we 
must do more to bring Putin’s war to 
an end and make Putin himself feel the 
full consequences of his horrible ac-
tions. That means hitting Russia’s 
economy where they will feel it most: 
energy. 
Just this week, I cosponsored bipar-
tisan legislation that would end all 
Russian energy imports to the United 
States. I am glad to see the Biden ad-
ministration responded to this call and 
that the United States is now ending 
all Russian energy imports, which are 
funding Putin’s cruel, cruel, cruel, and 
unprovoked war. I am heartened to see 
the United Kingdom follow suit, and I 
call on all of our allies to do the same. 
Another area where we can put pres-
sure on Russia is through trade. As 
chair of the Commerce subcommittee 
that oversees trade policy, I strongly 
support legislation to strip Russia’s 
most favored nation status at the 
World Trade Organization. And I am 
committed to pursuing additional ac-
tions that would severely weaken Rus-
sia’s economy and drain Putin’s war 
fund. 
And our efforts are not only about 
defending Ukraine and stopping Russia, 
though stop them we must. This is 
about defending democracy and the 
fundamental right of a nation and its 
people to choose their own destiny— 
the fundamental right of a nation and 
its people to choose its own destiny. 
America must make it clear that we 
will not stand idly by when an auto-
cratic bully decides to invade another 
nation without provocation and with-
out justification. The United States 
and our allies must leave no stone 
unturned 
to 
ensure 
that 
Vladimir 
Putin pays a steep price for his aggres-
sion against the people of Ukraine. 
We—we—must continue to serve as a 
shield and a beacon for democracy and 
freedom for those in need. On behalf of 
the Battle Born State of Nevada, I 
stand with Ukraine and will continue 
fighting to make sure the United 
States stands proud and strong as a 
beacon of peace and security. 
I yield the floor.

INFLATION 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
inflation. And one thing is sure, Joe 
Biden is the President of high prices. 
New numbers are out today. This 
morning, we found that inflation re-
mains the worst it has been in 40 
years—40 years. Now, we knew that to-
day’s inflation numbers were going to 
be bad for Americans and bad for the 
administration, but the numbers today 
are worse than people thought. 
Prices rose nearly 8 percent in just 
the last year. That means we are now 
seeing more inflation in the last 13 
months under President Joe Biden 
than we did in the previous 4 years. 
And families are suffering. Prices are 
going up, but wages are not keeping up. 
Last week, we found out that wages, in 
terms of an escalation, had slowed 
down a bit, which means that people 
are falling further and further behind. 
Wages just cannot keep up with the 
prices that continue to go up. Month 
after month after month, the American 
people have found themselves falling 
further and further and further behind. 
I remember when Joe Biden told all 
of us that inflation would be ‘‘transi-
tory.’’ He kind of laughed about it. He

March 10, 2022 
said it over and over again. And then, 
in December, he said inflation had 
‘‘peaked.’’ Mr. President, inflation had 
not peaked. Joe Biden, once again, 
dead wrong. 
Now, the American people are re-
minded about this every time they go 
to the gas station, every time they go 
to the grocery store, every time they 
go out to purchase goods. 
So why is this happening? What has 
happened to America under Joe Biden 
and the mismanagement of this Demo-
cratic administration that has the 
House, the Senate, and the White 
House? 
Well, there are two main things. One 
is 
Democrats’ 
spending, 
excessive 
spending. The other, of course: Demo-
crats’ restrictions on American energy. 
One year ago, Joe Biden signed the 
largest spending bill in American his-
tory. Democrats put $2 trillion on 
America’s credit card. They flooded the 
country with government cash, and 
prices went up. And ever since that 
day, prices have been going up faster 
than wages. There is still no end in 
sight. The painful truth of all of this is 
energy prices, food prices all across the 
country are going to continue to go up 
thanks to the mismanagement of Joe 
Biden and this administration. 
Today, a gallon of gas in the United 
States is the highest it has ever been— 
ever. When Joe Biden took office, the 
average price of gasoline in America 
was $2.38 a gallon; and today, it is 
about $2 a gallon more than it was 
then. Coming from my home State of 
Wyoming, where people drive more 
miles per capita than any other State 
in the country, people in my State are 
really feeling the pain of the mis-
management by Joe Biden and the 
Democrats. 
If we think it is bad in Wyoming, 
let’s go to the liberal paradise of Cali-
fornia. I don’t know what it is in the 
Presiding Officer’s home State of Ha-
waii, but in California, it is $5.60 a gal-
lon. Summer is coming, and people are 
expecting the prices to get even higher. 
So what is Joe Biden’s answer to 
this? He is blaming everything on 
Vladimir Putin—everything. It is a 
convenient excuse. It is just wrong. By 
the time that Vladimir Putin started 
to encircle Ukraine and then actually 
invaded Ukraine, inflation had been 
roaring here at home for over 10 
months. Gas prices were already way 
up, $1.25 a gallon higher than they were 
on the day Joe Biden took office. So 
Biden’s numbers just don’t add up. 
Russian oil amounts to about 3 per-
cent of our energy use in the United 
States. Gas prices haven’t just gone up 
by 3 percent. No, no. They have nearly 
doubled during Joe Biden’s Presidency. 
The real reason that prices are up so 
much for energy is Joe Biden has re-
stricted our use of American energy. If 
you listen to his—go back to the tapes 
on the debate stage when he was run-
ning for President. He said he is going 
to keep it in the ground, no oil and gas 
or exploration or coal on public lands— 
none, zero. The White House Press Sec-
retary the other day said, Oh, we are at 
record high production. 
We are not. Mistake. Absolutely 
wrong. She should be fact-checked. We 
are over a million barrels a day fewer 
U.S. barrels of oil produced today than 
we were during the height of our pro-
duction before the pandemic—actually, 
1.4 million barrels a day fewer barrels 
today than we were at the height of our 
production before the pandemic. 
Well, when supply goes down as a re-
sult of the mismanagement and the de-
cisions made by this Biden administra-
tion and the refusal to allow for per-
mits to explore for energy, prices go 
up; and they have. When the price of 
energy goes up, the prices of every-
thing go up as well. 
What are the Democrats proposing 
about high prices for energy? Well, the 
answer for Democrats seems to be any-
thing except more American energy. 
Democrats have essentially floated 
three proposals: One is defund our 
roads and bridges; the second is buy 
more energy from our enemies, people 
that chant ‘‘Death to America’’; or 
keep prices high. Those are the options 
we hear from the Democrats. 
We see some frightened Democrats 
worried about reelection talking about 
suspending the gas tax and then bring-
ing it back right after election day. 
Well, the gas tax is what pays for the 
roads and the bridges, the highways of 
our Nation, but bring it back right 
after the election. Well, does that 
mean we are going to need less energy 
after election day; so it is OK to raise 
prices after the election? Of course not. 
Even former Clinton and Obama eco-
nomic adviser Larry Summers calls 
this proposal being introduced in this 
body by Members of the Democratic 
side of the aisle—he called it ‘‘short- 
sighted, ineffective, gimmicky, and 
goofy.’’ That is Larry Summers from 
both the Obama as well as the Clinton 
administration. 
If we completely repeal the gas tax, 
gas prices would still be $1.75 more a 
gallon than they were the day Joe 
Biden took office. So another option 
the Democrats are floating is, ‘‘Hey, 
let’s 
buy 
more 
energy 
from 
our 
enemy.’’ Wouldn’t that be a great idea, 
says the President? So officials from 
the Biden administration have gone 
hat in hand to Venezuela last weekend 
as well as to Iran. Venezuela is one of 
the closest allies to Vladimir Putin. I 
understand the current man in power 
in Venezuela actually called to con-
gratulate Vladimir Putin for what he is 
doing in Ukraine—so is Iran, in terms 
of the world’s No. 1 sponsor of ter-
rorism. That is who Joe Biden has cho-
sen to talk to—Iran and Venezuela— 
rather than United States energy pro-
ducers. 
Do we want to pay our worst enemies 
over $100 a barrel for each barrel of oil 
they will sell to us? Do we want to send 
billions and billions of dollars of hard- 
earned taxpayer dollars in this country 
to those who hate us and burn Amer-
ican flags and chant ‘‘Death to Amer-
ica,’’ or do we want to create jobs here 
at home, produce more American en-
ergy? The answer is obvious to most 
American people. It may not be obvi-
ous to the man in the White House or 
his administration or those around 
him, but Joe Biden would rather have 
an enormous transfer of wealth to our 
enemies than tell the climate elitists 
who he dances to the tune of that we 
are going to produce energy at home. 
Finally, some Democrats are just 
proposing: Let’s keep energy prices 
high. The Secretary of Transportation 
says: Just buy an electric vehicle; that 
will solve all our problems. He said, 
You won’t have to worry about gas 
prices no matter how high they go. It 
is OK if they go high as long as you buy 
an electric vehicle. 
Talk about being out of touch. The 
average electric vehicle costs over 
$55,000. Families who are struggling in 
this Biden economy, they can’t afford 
to spend $55,000. We have many, many 
Americans living paycheck to pay-
check, falling further and further be-
hind. 
And the Secretary of Transportation 
says: Hey, just go find $55,000, buy an 
electric vehicle, and you can plug it in. 
Where do you think the electricity 
comes from? It doesn’t come from the 
wall. Talk about an administration 
being out of touch. That is what we are 
dealing with in this country today. 
Two-thirds of Americans say they are 
living paycheck to paycheck. 
This morning, we had a hearing in 
the Energy Committee that said, What 
about everybody trying to buy an elec-
tric vehicle; can we do it? 
What do we hear? You have to buy a 
lot of things from China or Russia just 
to get the rare Earth minerals that are 
needed to build the batteries for the 
electric cars. What does Elon Musk, 
Mr. Tesla, say? He says, Produce more 
American energy. 
It is time for the President of the 
United States to wake up. It is really 
not an option for everybody to get an 
electric vehicle. Even if everybody had 
the money, there are not enough elec-
tric vehicles to be had anywhere in the 
near—not just the near future—the 
foreseeable future and beyond that. 
Another option is not to send billions 
of dollars to our enemies. After all, as 
a State Department official from this 
administration told us in the Foreign 
Relations Committee as Putin was 
building up—before the invasion, but 
building up the army around Ukraine— 
said that Putin’s energy was the cash 
cow that was paying for his military 
aggression. 
The American people deserve better 
solutions, rational solutions, solutions 
that they understand. And they under-
stand American energy. 
Just yesterday, Joe Biden said: I 
can’t do much right now to bring down 
prices. 
It is not true. Last week, the morn-
ing after the State of the Union ad-
dress, I, along with every Republican

March 10, 2022 
on the Senate Energy Committee— 
every Republican signed the letter, 
sent it to Joe Biden, offered 10 points 
he could do and do now to make a dif-
ference for American energy produc-
tion to help the American economy, to 
help with jobs, to help with energy pro-
duction, and to help bring down the 
cost of energy. 
We know what we need to do. To 
bring down inflation, we need to stop 
the reckless spending here in Wash-
ington, DC. Of course, that is gone now. 
The Democrats, on a single party-line 
vote—no Republican voted for it—did 
that last year to spark inflation and 
then all the rules and regulations and 
limitations on Americans’ use of en-
ergy has added to and contributed to, 
today, a 40-year high of inflation. 
Above all, we need to unleash Amer-
ican energy. We need to use American 
energy. More American energy will 
bring down the prices. We have it. 
When the Secretary of the Interior 
makes a statement that she wants us 
to keep all the oil and gas in the 
ground, that is a statement about this 
administration’s lack of commitment 
to use American energy. 
We have the opportunity in America 
to do it right. For more than a year 
now, the American people have been 
paying and paying and paying for the 
Democrats’ anti-American energy poli-
cies, and they are sick and tired of it. 
You turn on the TV, and you see what 
is happening out there in the world. In 
Ukraine, people are getting killed by 
Vladimir Putin—a maternity ward and 
a hospital bombed, people killed. And 
what did former Secretary of State, 
John Kerry, the Democrats’ climate 
envoy say in an interview to the BBC 
as 
the 
Russian 
troops 
encircled 
Ukraine? He said: I hope it doesn’t dis-
tract from our climate agenda. That is 
obscene, and it is absurd. 
The American people realize how ab-
solutely ridiculous the position and 
how untenable the position of this ad-
ministration is when you have the No. 
1 climate spokesman for the adminis-
tration, a former Secretary of State, 
somebody who was a Member of this 
body for years, close colleague and 
friend of the President of the United 
States—it is time for Joe Biden to 
stand up to John Kerry and to stand up 
to the climate elitists who say: Oh, no, 
no American energy because we are so 
pure. 
The American people know what is 
important to them and their lives. We 
all want to make energy as clean as we 
can, as fast as we can, without raising 
costs on American families. The ad-
ministration seems to be happy to see 
the prices go up on American families 
at a time when their wages are not 
keeping up with their expenses. It is 
long past time that we produce Amer-
ican energy and do it right here. We 
have the resources. We have the know- 
how. We have the workers. We are only 
missing one thing, and that is com-
petent leadership in the White House 
and in the Democrats in this body on 
Capitol Hill.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
f 
ENERGY 
Mr. LANKFORD. Mr. President, I was 
at the State of the Union Address, as 
was the Chair and most of the folks in 
this room. 
In the State of the Union Address, 
the President made a very strong 
statement. I was pleased to be able to 
hear him say—he made this statement: 
We will buy American to make sure ev-
erything—everything—from the deck 
of an aircraft carrier to the steel on 
the highway guardrails is made in 
America from beginning to end. All of 
it. All of it. 
Great. What he left out is what we 
have marked as little asterisks here on 
the ‘‘everything,’’ ‘‘all of it,’’ ‘‘all of 
it,’’ it seems to be, except oil and gas. 
Oil and gas is one of those things 
that is essential for us. It is not just 
transportation. It is not just elec-
tricity. The carpet I am standing on 
has petroleum products in it. The fin-
ish on this desk has petroleum prod-
ucts in it. The suit that people are 
wearing often will have some petro-
leum products in it—maybe the but-
tons on the jacket, paint on the walls. 
There are petroleum products all over 
this room, and it is needed for all kinds 
of things. 
Our economy is connected to petro-
leum. That doesn’t mean we can’t do it 
cleaner. That doesn’t mean we can’t do 
it better. But it is interesting to me to 
be able to note that when we talk 
about ‘‘Buy American’’ and ‘‘Doing 
American,’’ now, when there is the con-
versation and now decision finally from 
the Biden administration that we are 
going to cut off Russian oil and gas 
coming into the United States—good— 
that it immediately turns to let’s get 
it from Venezuela or from Iran or find 
some other source. 
We are all saying: Time out. There is 
this country called the United States. 
We also produce oil and gas, and we 
should be focused on what does it take 
to be able to do it more here so that we 
are not dependent on any country, es-
pecially a country that is run by an 
autocratic dictator. 
I wish this was the only statement 
that I would challenge him on, but I 
was 
quite 
shocked 
that 
President 
Biden’s envoy for climate, John Kerry, 
as the Russians were invading Ukraine, 
made this statement: 
I hope [that] President Putin will help us 
to stay on track with respect to what we 
need to do for the climate. 
And then he said that a Russian war 
could cause ‘‘massive emission con-
sequences.’’ 
Wow. The focus seemed to be on 
emissions consequences of a war, rath-
er than the people of Ukraine. And the 
focus seemed to be on, ‘‘I hope Presi-
dent Putin will stay on track with re-
spect to climate change,’’ rather than 
stop. 
Listen, when I just talk to normal 
folks on the street in Oklahoma, they 
are frustrated by the price of gas. No 
matter how small their car is or how 
big their truck is, they are ticked at 
the high price of gasoline. They have 
been upset for a while. It is not just 
based on Ukraine. The price of gasoline 
just in the past 13 months has gone up 
over $1 a gallon. That wasn’t because of 
Russia and Ukraine. That was directly 
because of policies that are of the 
Biden administration. 
And now, it is accelerating even 
more. We need to find a way to be able 
to create greater energy security for 
the United States of America, and that 
does involve actually producing more 
oil and gas. 
I would say that the Biden adminis-
tration and I disagree on this, but the 
little-known fact is we don’t disagree 
on this. I do agree with the Biden ad-
ministration because if you look at the 
Biden administration’s official num-
bers that they actually put out from 
the energy information, when they put 
out their official numbers and they 
have to estimate how much oil and gas 
we will use globally, the official esti-
mate from the Biden administration is, 
between now and 2050, we will continue 
to need progressively more and more 
natural gas and petroleum products— 
by the way, also more coal in their es-
timates as well. Where we are different 
from the Biden administration is they 
do acknowledge, privately, the facts 
and lay the data out and say we are 
going to need more oil and gas and 
more coal, not less, to provide the 
basic energy needs of the world. 
Where I disagree with them is how 
they are trying to be able to push the 
world into other energy solutions by 
raising the price of oil and gas, which 
directly punishes consumers, and to be 
able to meet American climate goals, 
saying, if we are going to meet our 
American climate goals, we need to 
push production out to other countries 
and have them produce the oil and gas 
and send it to us so that we can show 
a good score for our climate while we 
still actually need to be able to pur-
chase that oil from someone else. 
Let’s admit the obvious. We need all 
kinds of energy, and in the next 30 
years, according to even the Biden ad-
ministration, we are going to need more 
gas, natural gas, more petroleum, more 
oil, and more coal worldwide. 
We are also going to need all kinds of 
other forms of energy. Unlike others, I 
am not opposed to every type of en-
ergy. Let’s also make it as clean as we 
possibly can. We need to have all forms 
of energy out there, but we also need to 
admit the basic facts. We need oil and 
gas production. 
And that doesn’t mean we go get it 
from Venezuela. Venezuela is a ruth-
less human rights violator. The leader-
ship of Venezuela tortures his own peo-
ple. We need to not go run to Venezuela 
to be able to get additional oil. 
We certainly don’t need to go run to 
Iran. No, I don’t know that this admin-
istration is running to Iran, but there

March 10, 2022 
are great rumors that are flying 
around currently about the final nego-
tiations of an Iran nuclear deal, and we 
are waiting to see what the actual de-
tails are, whether that is going to in-
clude putting Iranian oil on the world 
market. I hope it does not. I hope also 
that they deal with, in an Iran nuclear 
deal—they actually deal with the weap-
ons that Iran is producing to actually 
deliver a nuclear warhead, as they con-
tinue to be able to test more and more 
missiles, with more and more range, 
with a larger and larger warhead size 
that is specifically designed for a nu-
clear warhead. 
We shouldn’t pay attention to nu-
clear material and ignore the delivery 
system that they are actually experi-
menting with. 
I hope we pay attention to what is 
happening in Yemen. Iran is the largest 
state sponsor of terrorism, and they 
are actually delivering the products of 
war to Yemen that is actually trying 
to 
destabilize 
all 
their 
neighbors 
around them. 
I hope we don’t lift sanctions on 
Hezbollah, on Hamas, on those individ-
uals who were part of actually mur-
dering our marines in 1983 in Beirut. 
Those individuals who took away the 
property of Jewish citizens in Iran in 
1979, I hope all of those sanctions re-
main and that those aren’t up for bid 
and that we are also not talking about 
buying Iranian oil. Solving our need for 
energy should not be running to dic-
tators around the world to go get it 
from them. 
So what is happening now? The ad-
ministration has done a release of 30 
million barrels from the United States 
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which, 
by the way, is a day-and-a-half of our 
oil usage. It does have some effect, but 
it is a day-and-a-half of our oil usage. 
It is not the long-term solution. Long 
term, that is not even a bump in prices. 
Long term, we have to have stable sup-
ply to meet the demands that we have 
in the country. 
This administration is saying that 
there is more oil production now in the 
United States than there was 2 years 
ago. That is factually true. During the 
time of COVID, production of oil plum-
meted in the United States, so there is 
definitely more oil being produced now 
than there was during the peak of the 
time during COVID. 
But they have also taken on multiple 
different items, from the very begin-
ning of the administration, to do what 
they could to be able to attack the pro-
duction of American oil and gas. From 
day 1, with cutting off the Keystone 
Pipeline, which, by the way, I have 
folks who catch me and say what dif-
ference would the Keystone Pipeline 
make? Well, let me give you an exam-
ple. The Keystone Pipeline would de-
liver more oil to Houston, TX, a day 
than what Russia does a day to the 
United States. 
We could literally replace Russian oil 
with what would have come through 
the Keystone Pipeline, but they killed 
it because they had environmental 
goals. And why should we worry about 
where we buy our oil from? Why should 
we buy it from the Canadians when we 
can buy it from the Russians—was the 
theory. 
Well, I think we know why I would 
much rather be buying from the Cana-
dians today than buying from Putin’s 
Russia. That was done right off the bat. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Com-
mission, just 2 weeks ago—not ancient 
history, just 2 weeks ago—announced a 
new restriction on natural gas pipe-
lines and said they will make decisions 
on export facilities of natural gas and 
natural gas pipelines on a case-by-case 
basis based on their mitigation plans 
that they will present—no definition of 
what that would mean. 
It is basically, if you are going to 
sink billions of dollars into doing a 
pipeline, we will make our decision 
when you are in process. What does 
that do? That discourages any com-
pany from actually doing a natural gas 
pipeline or certainly an export facility. 
When right now Europe is screaming at 
us to export more natural gas, FERC, 
literally, during the war, announced 
they are going to make it harder to do 
natural gas exports. 
The Obama-era rule on waters of the 
United States destabilized a lot of in-
vestment because no one knew what 
was going to be the issue and what was 
not going to be the issue. The Biden ad-
ministration is now saying they want 
to be able to reopen all of that and to 
create less certainty on investment. 
There was a pause on oil and gas 
lease sales. They said they were going 
to do a temporary moratorium. They 
started that on January 20, 2021. It 
hasn’t reopened yet, their temporary 
moratorium. 
Every 5 years there is a plan that has 
to be presented for offshore leases and 
how they are actually going to do off-
shore work. That plan is due in June of 
this year. As far as we can tell, the ad-
ministration has taken up nothing on 
it, meaning offshore will have no abil-
ity to be able to continue permitting 
because they are just apparently not 
going to do the plan, which means you 
don’t get access to those leases. 
So whether it is offshore, whether it 
is onshore, they are cutting off future 
supplies. 
If that is not hard enough, the ad-
ministration nominated Sarah Raskin 
to be Vice Chair of Supervision for the 
Federal Reserve, who has made public 
statements that she wants to be able to 
use the Federal Reserve to be able to 
help cut off capital to anyone who han-
dles fossil fuels. 
So, basically, if you can’t get loans 
and you can’t transport from here to 
there through a pipeline and you can’t 
get additional leases offshore or on-
shore on Federal lands, you have se-
verely limited the locations that you 
can actually get energy long term, 
while Biden’s own energy information 
group says we are going to continue to 
need more oil and gas, more coal in the 
days ahead—the facts versus the re-
ality of what they are actually putting 
into place. 
Now, again, electric vehicles don’t of-
fend me. For those folks who can afford 
an expensive electric vehicle, that is 
great. It is 2 percent of the vehicles on 
the road, and they are fine. I don’t 
have a problem with them. But even 
when they talk about, let’s do what we 
can to double the number of electric 
vehicles that are on the road, great, we 
will be at 4 percent of the vehicles on 
the road will be electric. 
The other 96 percent of the people in 
the country want to go to school, want 
to go to work, want to go to the gro-
cery store, want to travel on vacation, 
and right now to do that, they are pay-
ing the price for it. 
Let’s have all forms of energy. Let’s 
have some realism in our conversation. 
Let’s do what we can to be able to open 
up energy production. 
What am I doing? I have a specific 
piece of legislation that deals with the 
permitting processes. It deals with 
some of the Executive actions that 
President Biden has put into place to 
be able to slow down the production of 
American energy. It opens up the proc-
ess so we can actually get back to pro-
ducing more American energy. 
I am also promoting some very key 
things that the administration can do 
right now. For instance, when energy 
companies are looking to do invest-
ment for additional drilling, they are 
asking the question how long is the 
war going to happen? When is all this 
going to fall apart? And no one knows 
that. 
The administration today could an-
nounce we are doing a moratorium on 
buying Russian oil for the next 12 
months, lay out a firm date on it, and 
then say 12 months from now we will 
review it. What difference does that 
make? That tells energy companies, if 
you are going to invest and you are 
planning to come online in the next 
year, we are not going to cut your legs 
out from under you by the United 
States buying Russian oil again in a 
few months; that we actually do Amer-
ican investments to be able to actually 
replace the Russian oil that is coming 
in. 
This administration could also today 
say we are not going to make any 
changes to any of the rules that are out 
there that will affect any of the process 
for developing American oil and gas for 
the next 12 months, just a pause on 
making any changes on that. 
And this administration could actu-
ally open up Federal leasing, which, by 
the way, is not a radical idea. It is the 
law. The law says that the administra-
tion has to do it every quarter, and so 
far four quarters in a row the Biden ad-
ministration has ignored the law of the 
United States and just not done the 
leases, saying: They have plenty. I 
don’t want to do more. 
Four quarters in a row they violated 
the law. 
So what could the Biden administra-
tion do to be able to help American

production? Follow the law; put a 
pause on new restrictions; declare how 
long they are going to actually hold off 
on Russian oil and how long that will 
be to give certainty for people in their 
investment; and pause all these new re-
strictions on capital. 
If the Biden administration did that 
today, we would see an even greater in-
crease in oil. Listen, there is no incen-
tive that needs to be put in place. I 
have had folks say: What incentives do 
we need to put in place to be able to in-
crease American production? Can I just 
say oil is at $120 a barrel. 
There is no incentive that needs to be 
put in place. The problem is not the in-
centive; the problems are the restric-
tions on the other side. With that cer-
tainty in a constantly changing envi-
ronment, very few people want to be 
able to take the risk for it. 
So if Secretary Granholm is serious 
when she is calling out oil companies 
to ramp up production, do the work be-
hind the scenes to open the path for 
them so that they have that kind of 
certainty. 
I yield the floor.

UKRAINE 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, 
conditions are bad in Ukraine, and 
they 
are 
getting 
worse. 
Vladimir 
Putin’s war is escalating in severity 
and scale. 
This past Sunday, we received the 
first public reports that Russia is now 
deploying proxy fighters to Ukraine. 
Putin put out the call to action in 
Syria, Southeast Asia, and Chechnya, 
and now the mercenaries are pouring 
in. On Tuesday, we heard further alle-
gations that as many as 1,000 proxy 
fighters from the Kremlin-backed Wag-
ner Group will deploy to Ukraine and 
attack Kyiv. 
This latest news about proxy devel-
opments makes it even more obvious 
how willfully blind the President has 
been to the disaster unfolding in 
Ukraine. If you look back at footage 
from the past few months, it is clear 
that the Biden administration thought 
they would be able to talk Putin out of 
this. They thought they could send in 
the diplomats, offer a few concessions, 
pat everyone on the back, and head 
home. But while they were lining up 
their talking points, Vladimir Putin 
was lining up bodies to throw at 
Ukrainian defenses. 
When we first started to debate the 
threat that the Chinese Communist 
Party poses to the free world, it took a 
lot of time to convince the skeptics of 
China’s tight hold on the global order. 
Through the Belt and Road Initiative, 
cheap telecom build-outs, and control 
over important supply chains, Beijing 
has created spheres of economic influ-
ence all across the globe. 
The Kremlin has done the same thing 
with its proxies. But it is important to 
remember that this is not new informa-
tion. The existence of Wagner and 
other Russian proxy groups is not a se-
cret, and neither is their brutal his-
tory. 
This won’t be Wagner’s first time in 
Ukraine. If fact, that is where these 
mercenaries actually got started. But 
for the past decade, they have been 
wreaking 
havoc 
all 
across 
Africa. 
Again, this is no secret. We know for a 
fact that they have caused chaos and 
bloodshed in Syria, Libya, Yemen, 
Sudan, Madagascar, Mozambique, and 
the Central African Republic and that 
they have helped turn Mali into yet an-
other ‘‘hermit kingdom.’’ And what 
have the Russians received in return? 
They have gotten access to oilfields, 
diamond mines, silver, gold, and other 
extremely valuable natural resources. 
By using his proxies, Putin gets the 
best of all worlds. He is able to force 
open doors into strategically impor-
tant areas. He will then suck them dry 
of their natural resources and make his 
own name synonymous with violence 
in the face of resistance. 
Furthermore, mercenaries exist out-
side the bounds of laws and norms, 
which means groups like Wagner oper-
ate with impunity and give cover and 
plausible deniability to Moscow. In 
their opinion, it is the perfect legal fic-
tion. 
Meanwhile, these proxy fighters have 
been accused of abductions, torture, 
and rape. They murder journalists and 
conduct summary executions on behalf 
of their Kremlin overlords. They target 
civilian populations with the specific 
purpose of terrorizing innocents and 
eliminating dissent, and when they are 
done, they simply disappear. That is 
what Vladimir Putin is preparing to 
unleash on the brave Ukrainian people. 
I sent, and other Members joined 
me—we have insisted since February 24 
that this is not a special military oper-
ation; this is a war. But by bringing 
proxies into the mix, Putin has sig-
naled that he is prepared to do more 
than inflict violence on key strategic 
targets; he is preparing for a massacre. 
This isn’t a head fake. He knows ex-
actly what he is doing because he has 
done it before. He is following the 
Syria playbook to the letter, from the 
booby-trapped humanitarian corridors 
to his use of cluster bombs, to the pres-
ence of proxies to carry out his dirty 
deeds. 
It is no wonder that Moscow has or-
dered their fighters to travel with mo-
bile crematoriums. It is the only way 
they will be able to even attempt to 
cover up the brutality inflicted by 
Putin’s private army. 
Over the past few months, Putin has 
shown us exactly what he intends to do 
to the brave Ukrainian people. He has 
made no attempt to hide behind diplo-
macy. 
His 
military 
commits 
war 
crimes in broad daylight for the benefit 
of the cameras. The introduction of 
proxies is the natural progression of 
this increasingly savage attack. 
It is time for President Biden to pull 
the blinders off and decide what Amer-
ica’s response ought to be, and he has 
to do that right now. 
We have deprioritized the African 
theater for far too long, and now it is 
a breeding ground for glorified terror 
squads. That absolutely has to change. 
Russia is using proxies this very mo-
ment to destabilize and exploit Mali. 
We know what they did to the people of 
Syria. The pictures were too graphic 
for the nightly news. It is time to re-
mind the world what happened there 
and make it clear that unless we do 
something, Ukraine is next. 
We must also send a strong signal to 
Putin, Wagner, and other thugs around 
the world that there will be no more 
hiding. Collect the evidence now. Docu-
ment the war crimes now. Prepare for 
prosecutions now. We must let Vladi-
mir Putin know that no amount of 
propaganda can cover up the atrocities 
that he and his private army plan to 
commit against the people of Ukraine. 
But we have to do it before it is too 
late to free the world from Moscow’s 
grip. 
I yield the floor.

POSTAL SERVICE REFORM ACT 
Mr. PETERS. Mr. President, on Tues-
day night, the Senate took a signifi-
cant and historic vote to strengthen 
one of our Nation’s oldest and most 
trusted institutions—the U.S. Postal 
Service. 
For the past 15 years, this vital serv-
ice that delivers to every single com-
munity in our country, no matter how 
remote, has faced unfair, burdensome 
requirements that have jeopardized its 
financial stability and its ability to 
provide reliable and timely delivery to 
Americans all across our country. 
With 79 votes for the Postal Service 
Reform Act—one of the strongest bi-
partisan votes the Senate has delivered 
during this Congress—we passed sig-
nificant reforms that will set the Post-
al Service on a more stable financial 
footing, preserve mail delivery for 6 
days a week, and ensure greater trans-
parency of delivery performance for 
the people who are counting on the 
Postal Service to bring them critical 
mail. 
When our Nation’s Founders en-
shrined the Postal Service in our Con-
stitution, they could have never envi-
sioned what a vital role this institu-
tion would play in the daily lives of 
Americans. Whether it is families who 
are receiving critical medications or 
connecting with loved ones, veterans 
and seniors who are relying on the mail 
for 
benefits 
and 
Social 
Security 
checks, or small businesses that are 
sending important financial documents 
and their products to customers, Amer-
icans are counting on the Postal Serv-
ice to deliver. Over the past few years— 
especially during COVID–19—we have 
seen just how essential the Postal 
Service is to keeping our country con-
nected.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1083 
March 10, 2022 
The legislation that we passed earlier 
this week with overwhelming bipar-
tisan support will help ensure that the 
Postal Service can continue its vital 
mission, and I am looking forward to 
seeing President Biden sign it into law. 
I am proud of our bipartisan efforts 
to protect this vital public service, and 
I would like to take just a few mo-
ments to thank the many people who 
made this possible. 
First, I want to recognize my Senate 
colleague on this effort, Senator ROB 
PORTMAN, who is the ranking member 
of the Homeland Security and Govern-
mental Affairs Committee. 
I am also grateful to Chairwoman 
MALONEY and Ranking Member COMER 
on the House Committee on Oversight 
and Reform, who worked with me hand 
in hand, as well as with Senator 
PORTMAN, to write and to build key 
support for this legislation. 
Senator CARPER, who is a former 
chairman of Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs and a stalwart 
advocate for the Postal Service, was an 
absolutely indispensable resource, a 
critical voice, and we worked together 
to advance this bill. 
I would also like to recognize each of 
our 
Senate 
cosponsors: 
Senators 
TILLIS, SINEMA, and BURR, Chairman 
WYDEN of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, 
Senators 
COLLINS, 
HASSAN, 
DAINES, ROSEN, CAPITO, PADILLA, SUL-
LIVAN, 
MANCHIN, 
HAWLEY, 
SCHATZ, 
BLUNT, ROUNDS, SMITH, CRAMER, REED, 
MURKOWSKI, Chairman SANDERS of the 
Budget 
Committee, 
and 
Senators 
HOEVEN, TESTER, MORAN, and KAINE. 
Key stakeholders like the Postal 
Service, our postal employee unions, 
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, and 
the countless members of the public 
who spoke out about what timely serv-
ice meant to them also played an es-
sential role in providing technical as-
sistance and building support in pass-
ing this legislation. 
But none of these vital reforms to 
protect this longstanding public serv-
ice would have been possible without 
the dedicated and tireless work of con-
gressional staff. 
First, I would like to recognize my 
staff on the Homeland Security and 
Governmental Affairs Committee, who 
worked tirelessly to ensure this bill re-
ceived bipartisan and bicameral sup-
port, as well as stakeholder support. 
Thank you to Annika Christensen, 
Lena Chang, and Victoria Pleasant for 
your determined efforts to craft and 
build support for this consensus re-
form. 
I would also like to thank Senator 
PORTMAN’s staff, Pam Theissen, Andy 
Dockham, Amanda Neely, and Renee 
Sheehy, who all played an important 
role in crafting and passing these re-
forms. 
On the House Committee on Over-
sight and Reform, Mark Stephenson 
and Ethan Van Ness on Chairwoman 
MALONEY’s staff, as well as Christian 
Hoehner, 
Jake 
Greenberg, 
Daniel 
Ashworth, and Bill Womack on Rank-
ing Member COMER’s staff, provided 
valuable counsel and expertise on the 
legislation. 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman 
WYDEN’s staff, Eva Dugoff and Sam 
Conchuratt, 
and 
Ranking 
Member 
CRAPO’s staff, Erin Dempsey, offered 
vital assistance to ensure the Medicare 
integration 
proposal 
worked 
effec-
tively. 
House Ways and Means Committee 
staff Kathryn Olson, T.J. Sutcliffe, and 
Elisa Walker all provided critical tech-
nical assistance. 
Leader SCHUMER’s staff provided vital 
expertise and guidance throughout the 
entire process and especially over the 
past few weeks as we prepared to pass 
this bill on the floor. 
Finally, Jackie Maffucci from Sen-
ator CARPER’s office and Erin Bursch 
and 
Erin 
Schulte 
from 
Senator 
SINEMA’s office spent countless hours 
helping to craft and secure robust sup-
port for the bill. 
These folks, along with countless 
others, ensured that the Postal Service 
would be able to keep delivering for the 
American people. 
In recent years, it has been a rare oc-
casion when the Senate comes together 
to pass this kind of bipartisan, con-
sensus legislation with such over-
whelming support to address a very, 
very real problem. I am grateful to 
every person who played a role in rais-
ing awareness—working on this legisla-
tion—and getting it passed by both the 
House and the Senate. 
Once 
signed 
into 
law, 
this 
groundbreaking, bipartisan bill will 
help ensure that the Postal Service can 
continue its nearly 250-year tradition 
of providing delivery to every Amer-
ican. 
I yield the floor.

GOVERNMENT FUNDING 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, govern-
ment funding, as we all know, is set to 
expire tomorrow night at midnight, 
and the Senate has the responsibility 
not just to keep the lights on but also 
to make critical investments in our 
country. 
I could only wish that we had come 
to this point through a more rational 
and more deliberative sort of way; but, 
unfortunately, this seems to be more 
the norm than the exception where 
four people get into a room and they 
write a piece of legislation, then they 
bring it to the floor, and your only op-
tion is to vote yes or no on it. We don’t 
have a practice of making sure that on 
each one of these bills, people get to 
actually offer amendments and shape 
that legislation. I guess that is a 
quaint and old-fashioned notion, but 
that is how I thought the legislative 
process was supposed to work. Maybe 
that is a topic for another day, but it is 
unfortunate that this is where we are. 
Last night at 10 o’clock, the House 
voted on an almost 3,000-page bill, and 
then we are expected to vote on it the 
next day or the next 2 days. This is not 
a way to run a railroad. 
We all know that democracy is under 
attack in the world, and that means we 
need to do everything we can to pro-
vide for our defense and to support our 
friends and allies around the world. 
We know that there has been a tug- 
of-war between our Democratic col-
leagues and this side of the aisle when 
it comes to prioritizing national secu-
rity spending, and that actually is one 
reason why we find ourselves here at 
this late date, voting on this multi-
thousand-page bill, because our col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
wanted to prioritize domestic spending, 
not national security spending. 
Thank goodness that has been now 
negotiated where there is virtual par-
ity. Thanks to the leadership of Rank-
ing Member SHELBY and our colleagues 
on the Appropriations Committee, the 
bipartisan bill includes $42 billion more 
in defense spending. I can’t think of 
any time in our recent history where 
we need those additional resources 
more for our security and the security 
of our friends and allies. 
This $42 billion increase in defense 
spending will provide our military 
commanders with what they need to 
respond to the threats that we are fac-
ing today and to prepare for those 
threats we see on the horizon. 
It is ironic I find myself speaking to 
the Senator from Maine, whom I serve 
with on the Intelligence Committee, 
because he knows a lot of this subject 
matter as well—certainly well, maybe 
better than I do. But we all know that 
Russia’s unprovoked attack on Ukraine 
was what we thought was a relic of the 
past. 
My dad was a B–17 pilot in the Army 
Air Corps in World War II. He was shot 
down on his 26th bombing mission over 
Nazi Germany and captured as a pris-
oner of war, where he served for the 
last 
4 
months 
of 
that 
war. 
We 
thought—Europe thought, the world 
thought—that perhaps we had gotten 
beyond that sort existential threat to 
our way of life and that the autocrats 
of the world—people like Vladimir 
Putin, President Xi, the Ayatollah in 
Iran, Kim Jong Un in North Korea— 
that these individuals would be de-
terred from provoking a war like Vladi-
mir Putin has provoked in Ukraine. 
One thing Winston Churchill liked to 
say: If there is one thing for sure, it is 
that humankind is unteachable. We 
keep making the same mistakes over 
and over again. We keep thinking, well, 
we can cash the peace dividend because 
that is in the past, only to find our-
selves, as Secretary Bob Gates said—he 
said, of all the military conflicts we 
found ourselves involved in, in the last 
several 
generations, 
we 
haven’t 
planned for a single one of them. But 
we had to be ready, and we had to be 
able to defend our way of life and our 
values and our allies. 
So Russia’s unprovoked attack on 
Ukraine is a reminder of the threats

that remain to our freedom and the 
freedom of other democracies around 
the world. So there could not be a more 
appropriate time to plus-up our na-
tional defense spending, while at the 
same time providing additional re-
sources, humanitarian and otherwise, 
to our friends in Ukraine who are fight-
ing for their very existence. 
We know that Ukraine is not a mem-
ber of the North Atlantic Treaty Orga-
nization, so we have no legal obligation 
to come to Ukraine’s defense, but I do 
believe we have a moral obligation to 
provide that assistance, both military 
and humanitarian. 
Russia has waged an unmistakable 
war on that democracy, violated the 
sovereignty of the Ukrainian people. It 
has even targeted civilians and brought 
immeasurable destruction to Ukraine. 
The only question is, After Putin has 
miscalculated the will of the Ukrainian 
people to defend themselves and the 
commitment of America and our NATO 
allies and other freedom-loving coun-
tries around the world to support 
Ukraine—now that they are bogged 
down, 
Russia 
is 
bogged 
down 
in 
Ukraine, the question is, Well, is Putin 
going to give up? Is he going to try to 
come up with a face-saving device, or is 
he going to double down? I am afraid 
Putin is going to double down, which 
means we are going to see more at-
tacks on innocent civilians. We are 
going to see more Ukrainian cities lev-
eled to the ground, indiscriminate kill-
ing of men, women, and children. This 
is all that Putin knows. The question 
is, How does this end? That is a 
chilling question, but the answer is 
even more chilling. 
As I said, I believe we have a moral 
duty to support Ukraine, and this leg-
islation provides $13 billion in humani-
tarian, economic, and military assist-
ance. We need to get this money out 
the door as soon as possible, while the 
United States and NATO needs to con-
tinue to supply the Javelins and other 
anti-aircraft, 
anti-tank 
weapons 
to 
help the Ukrainians defend themselves 
against this existential threat. 
The good news is, this is a bipartisan 
effort. A lot of things we do around 
here we divide up along party lines— 
the shirts and the skins, I like to call 
them—but the fact is, we all support 
Ukraine, and we are all looking for 
ways we can help them during their 
time of need. 
Another thing that this Omnibus ap-
propriations bill does is it reauthorizes 
the Violence Against Women Act. This 
critical program has been defunct and 
moribund since 2019. For some reason, 
this was not a priority of this Chamber 
or of this Congress for the last 3 years, 
but thanks to the leadership of Sen-
ators ERNST and MURKOWSKI—Senator 
FEINSTEIN was an essential part of the 
negotiations—we were able to reach a 
bipartisan agreement to strengthen 
and modernize this law. 
I am a proud cosponsor of the legisla-
tion, and I thank our colleagues on the 
Appropriations 
Committee 
for 
prioritizing its inclusion in this legis-
lation. This funding will make critical 
investments for our country, including 
critical investments in our own people. 
One of the good things about this 
Omnibus appropriations bill is it does 
exclude 
poison 
pills 
that 
included 
things like taxpayer funding of abor-
tions. Those are not included in this 
bill. 
While it is far from perfect, there is 
no question that a bill drafted solely 
by Republicans would look a little dif-
ferent. But the world does not operate 
on the basis of ideals. The perfect can-
not be the enemy of the good. So de-
spite its flaws, despite the crazy proc-
ess by which we find ourselves here 
voting on this $1.5 trillion appropria-
tions bill, notwithstanding all the rea-
sons I could cite why maybe I should 
vote against it, I think there is enough 
good in this bill to support it. 
f 
NOMINATION OF KETANJI BROWN 
JACKSON 
Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on an-
other matter, 2 weeks ago, President 
Biden nominated Judge Ketanji Brown 
Jackson—and I know I mispronounced 
her first name; Judge Jackson, let me 
just call her—to serve as an Associate 
Justice on the Supreme Court. 
During his State of the Union Mes-
sage, President Biden said that choos-
ing somebody to serve on the Supreme 
Court is one of the most serious con-
stitutional responsibilities a President 
of the United States has. Likewise, I 
believe our responsibilities under the 
Constitution of evaluating the nomi-
nee, going through the advice-and-con-
sent process, is one of the most serious 
responsibilities we as Senators have, 
and I don’t take that responsibility 
lightly. 
Members of this Chamber are pretty 
familiar with Judge Jackson’s quali-
fications, as she was confirmed to the 
DC Circuit Court of Appeals just 9 
months ago—sometimes called the sec-
ond most powerful Federal court in the 
land, right below the Supreme Court of 
the United States. 
There is no question that Judge 
Jackson is an incredibly smart person 
and has all of the sort of pedigree that 
you would expect: graduated from the 
best universities, the best law schools, 
has had a broad range of practice. She 
received both her undergraduate and 
law degrees from Harvard. She clerked 
for a Supreme Court Justice, Justice 
Breyer. She served on the Federal 
bench for nearly 9 years. 
I could say, as somebody who served 
on the State court bench for 13 years, I 
appreciate the President picking some-
body who has actually had real-world 
experience on the trial bench. Too 
often, I think our Supreme Court nomi-
nees are academics and people who 
have very little real-world experience. 
But you can’t argue that Judge Jack-
son does not have that kind of real- 
world experience, serving as a public 
defender, serving on the trial court, 
and serving on the court of appeals for 
the last 9 months. 
We all know that a nomination for 
the Supreme Court requires a rigorous 
assessment of far more than just a re-
sume, though. Our Framers set forth 
the role of the Supreme Court in arti-
cle III of our Constitution. 
Alexander Hamilton noted in Fed-
eralist 78 that the judiciary, he said, 
would have ‘‘no influence over either 
the sword or the purse. . . . [i]t may 
truly be said to have neither force nor 
will, but merely judgment.’’ Now, if I 
can interpret what Alexander Hamilton 
was really saying in modern language, 
it is that judges shouldn’t be politi-
cians. They are not policymakers. 
That is why we appoint them—they 
are appointed—for lifetime tenure, to 
be protected from the pressures of poli-
tics or personality, and that is why 
they have such a critical and impor-
tant role in our government. But it is 
not the same role as we serve as elect-
ed representatives. We are enmeshed in 
politics. We are directly responsible to 
the people—not for the legal correct-
ness of our arguments or our legisla-
tion or constitutional interpretation, 
although I think we do have some re-
sponsibility since we take an oath to 
uphold the Constitution and laws of 
the United States, but it is different, 
and I think most people recognize 
judges are different than politicians. 
Judges should not be politicians ap-
pointed to serve for lifetime tenure and 
be unaccountable to the public and yet 
make policy. That is why judges decide 
individual cases. We don’t decide indi-
vidual cases here; we make policy for 
broad swathes of the American people. 
But judges decide cases based on a con-
troversy, a set of facts, and the appli-
cation of the law to those facts, which 
is, again, the antithesis of politics. 
That is what judging is all about. 
So the Supreme Court is not just an-
other branch of government that you 
can go to if you don’t get your desired 
outcome in the political branches. If 
you don’t win the election, if you don’t 
elect your like-minded representative, 
you are not supposed to just go to the 
Supreme Court and say: OK, now you 
give me what I want because I couldn’t 
get it through the political branches. 
The Supreme Court is not supposed 
to be a failsafe to be utilized to deliver 
results that can’t be secured through 
the legislative process. Our democracy, 
equal justice under the law—that is 
what it says right above the door of the 
Supreme Court of the United States: 
‘‘Equal Justice Under Law’’—can only 
be accomplished when the same law ap-
plies to all of us. Cases are therefore 
decided based on their unique facts— 
not on politics, not on personal pref-
erences, not even on strongly held per-
sonal beliefs. This is absolutely critical 
to our system of checks and balances 
and the health of our democracy. 
So I look forward to meeting Judge 
Jackson in person. I saw her across the 
hearing room when she was before the 
Judiciary Committee just about a year

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1085 
March 10, 2022 
ago. But I want to ask her a little more 
about her judicial philosophy and how 
she views her role on the Supreme 
Court. 
Now, some have suggested, since she 
has been confirmed to the circuit 
court, 
that 
this 
ought 
to 
be 
a 
rubberstamp. Well, I don’t view it that 
way. Circuit court nominees and dis-
trict court nominees have to apply Su-
preme Court precedent, but when you 
are a member of the Supreme Court, 
there is no higher court that dictates 
the decision or the precedence you need 
to apply. 
Now, ideally, you are applying the 
statutes and laws passed by Congress 
and the Constitution itself, but there is 
admittedly more flexibility for the 
nominee, which means her philosophy 
is even more important to know now. 
I tried to flesh out Judge Jackson’s 
judicial philosophy during her con-
firmation hearing for the DC Circuit 
Court. A number of us submitted ques-
tions for the record asking her to clar-
ify her judicial philosophy and the way 
she interprets the Constitution. 
We have heard a lot of testimony 
over the years about originalists and 
textualists and different ways people 
approach their duties as a judge. 
I don’t think Judge Jackson was par-
ticularly forthcoming with her answers 
when we asked about her philosophy, 
and I ultimately voted against her con-
firmation for the circuit court. Now, 
that vote is not going to determine 
how I view her nomination to the Su-
preme Court, but I think the question 
applies with even greater strength be-
cause she will not be bound by Su-
preme Court precedent. 
I know she will have plenty of time 
and plenty of opportunity to clarify 
her views during the confirmation 
process, and I hope to see an unvar-
nished look, beginning with our con-
versation tomorrow, on Thursday. 
I am also eager to learn more about 
Judge Jackson’s views of the Supreme 
Court as an institution, which has in-
creasingly come under attack by par-
tisans, again, who don’t particularly 
like the decisions of the Court. But 
that is not supposed to be the test. The 
test is whether they apply the Con-
stitution and laws of the United States 
to the facts found by the finder of fact. 
There have actually been a number of 
calls here on the Senate and in our po-
litical system in general to change the 
makeup of the Supreme Court, to actu-
ally add additional Justices to the 
Court—something 
that 
used 
to 
be 
called court packing back in the days 
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. But Jus-
tice Breyer, to his credit, whose seat 
Judge Jackson has been nominated to 
fill, has been a steadfast defender of 
the Supreme Court as an institution, 
and I hope soon-to-be-Justice Jackson 
takes her cues from her mentor. 
Justice Breyer echoed the comments 
of the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg and 
warned about a potentially dangerous 
politicalization of the Supreme Court 
and the consequential loss of public 
confidence in its judgments. Well, I 
would like to know whether Judge 
Jackson agrees with Justice Breyer 
and whether she shares Justice Gins-
burg’s assessment that nine seems to 
be a good number when it comes to the 
Supreme Court. 
In the coming days and weeks, the 
Senate will thoroughly review Judge 
Jackson’s qualifications, just as this 
body has done for every other nominee 
to the Federal bench. This is a familiar 
process to most of us. Judge Jackson is 
the fourth Supreme Court nominee we 
will have considered in the last 5 years. 
But I hope there is something we do 
differently this time than has been 
done in the recent past, particularly in 
the case of Justice Kavanaugh. Frank-
ly, the confirmation process for Justice 
Kavanaugh was an embarrassment and, 
I believe, a black mark on this Senate. 
Conversely, I think we have an oppor-
tunity to show the American people 
how to do it the right way and treat 
Judge Jackson with civility and dig-
nity, even when we disagree. We know 
that outside groups launched a full-on 
character 
attack 
against 
Judge 
Kavanaugh. 
Even 
Justice 
Barrett, 
more recently, was attacked based on 
her religious beliefs. 
I can assure you that will not happen 
this time around. We will meticulously 
review Judge Jackson’s record. We will 
ask detailed questions to understand 
her judicial philosophy. We will read 
and review her opinions and carefully 
evaluate her ability to serve. Through 
it all, there is no question that she will 
be treated with dignity and respect. 
I think the confirmation process 
must be thorough and it must be civil. 
The American people and, frankly, the 
nominee deserves nothing less. I am 
prepared to fulfill my advice and con-
sent duties as a Member of this body 
and as a member of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. 
As we know, there is no particular 
timeline for this process. In some 
cases, it moves quickly, and in others 
it has taken significantly more time. 
Chairman DURBIN has announced that 
the Judiciary Committee will begin its 
confirmation hearing in the week of 
March 21, which doesn’t allow much 
more time for our colleagues to meet 
with Judge Jackson before evaluating 
her 
record, 
and 
I 
know 
she 
has 
prioritized meeting with Members of 
the Judiciary Committee. I hope she 
will have adequate time to meet with 
other Members who are not on the Ju-
diciary Committee, as well. 
I know our colleagues are anxious to 
expedite this process, but we all know 
Justice Breyer will stay on the Court 
until the end of this term, which will 
be the first week or so in July. 
Justices do not have term limits. 
They are not held accountable on elec-
tions, but they wield tremendous power 
under our Constitution. So we have a 
duty, not necessarily to get it done fast 
but to get it done right and thoroughly 
evaluate Judge Jackson’s qualifica-
tions and ensure that, if confirmed, she 
will serve as a fair and impartial mem-
ber of the Supreme Court. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. VAN 
HOLLEN). The Senator from Hawaii. 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, I was 
listening very carefully to my friend, 
my colleague from Texas, on his com-
ments regarding the process by which 
we give our advice and consent to all of 
our judicial nominees, but, of course, 
particularly our responsibility with re-
gard to Supreme Court nominees. 
There seems to be some concern that 
we are rushing the nomination process 
for Judge Jackson. Nothing could be 
further from the truth because every-
body remembers the speed with which 
nominee Amy Coney Barrett was put 
on the Court, from the time of her 
nomination to the hearings, to her 
being sworn in. 
There will be enough time for all of 
our Members of this body to consider 
Judge Jackson’s nomination, not to 
mention that we have already con-
firmed her twice, once to the district 
court and another time to the circuit 
court. It is not as though she is unfa-
miliar to us. 
Also, any connotation that somehow 
President Trump’s nominees were ill- 
treated—again, nothing could be fur-
ther from the truth because the whole 
process, especially with regard to Jus-
tice Kavanaugh, was with the utmost 
desire on the part, particularly, of the 
Democrats on the Judiciary Committee 
to get to the bottom of certain allega-
tions against Justice Kavanaugh that 
were highly serious. 
To cast any kind of doubt or asper-
sions on the work of the members of 
the Committee—especially the Demo-
crats on the Committee—with regard 
to President Trump’s nominees is not 
well-taken. 
f 
ABORTION 
Ms. HIRONO. Mr. President, let me 
move onto why I am here this after-
noon. It is not an exaggeration to say 
that we are at a crisis point. Repub-
lican legislatures all across the coun-
try are continuing to pass bills that 
control our bodies and, at the same 
time, Trump Supreme Court nominees 
are closer than ever to overturning Roe 
v. Wade. 
There are 26 States across the coun-
try that are likely, if not certain, to 
ban abortion if the Supreme Court 
overturns Roe v. Wade. There is no 
question that these restrictions that 
have been enacted by States all across 
the country have an incredibly dis-
criminatory impact and will dispropor-
tionately harm those who are already 
facing far more obstacles when it 
comes to accessing healthcare, includ-
ing women of color, women with low 
incomes, 
people 
with 
disabilities, 
LGBTQ+ individuals, rural women, and 
many more. 
For over 50 years, Roe v. Wade en-
abled women to make the decision 
about whether or not they wanted to

March 10, 2022 
start a family. But, today, because of 
new abortion care restrictions, 90 per-
cent of counties in the United States 
do not have an abortion provider. 
Women are faced with impossible deci-
sions and, as a result, will be forced to 
have babies they can’t afford, didn’t 
plan for, or are unable to care for, or 
faced to have babies under life-threat-
ening 
conditions. 
And, 
tragically, 
women may also die because they lack 
the access or resources to safely end 
pregnancy. Abortion bans are a matter 
of life and death. 
Women across the country are under 
attack and so, too, are the healthcare 
professionals who provide safe and 
legal abortions. Today is Abortion Pro-
vider Appreciation Day. This day was 
established to honor Dr. David Gunn, 
who was killed on March 10, 1993, out-
side his abortion clinic in Pensacola, 
FL, by a White supremacist, anti-abor-
tion extremist. 
Abortion 
providers 
are 
compas-
sionate, 
credentialed, 
and 
highly 
trained professionals who allow women 
to actually make choices about their 
own bodies, their futures, and whether 
or not they want to start a family, and 
they do so without judgment and in the 
face of violence. 
Tragically, Dr. Gunn’s murder was 
just the first known instance of a mur-
der of an abortion provider. Across the 
country, abortion providers experience 
intimidation, harassment, threats, and 
violence from anti-abortion extremists. 
According to NARAL, between 1977 
and 2015, there were over 7,200 acts of 
violence carried out against abortion 
providers by anti-choice extremists. 
These included 42 bombings, 185 arson 
attacks, 
and 
thousands 
of 
death 
threats, bioterrorism threats, and as-
saults. Every single day, even right 
here in DC, anti-choice extremists sta-
tion outside of abortion clinics and 
harass staff and patients. 
Fourteen States and the District of 
Columbia have needed to enact laws to 
protect abortion providers and pa-
tients, including laws that prohibit 
blocking the entrance to a clinic, 
threatening or intimidating staff, dam-
aging property, and more. Three States 
have even had to go so far as to estab-
lish a ‘‘bubble zone’’ to protect people 
within a certain distance of a clinic. 
These doctors, nurses, and staff fear for 
their lives just to provide access to re-
productive care. 
Being an abortion provider is a dan-
gerous profession in this country. What 
other medical profession deals with 
this level of harassment and violence 
just to provide medical services, med-
ical care? For what other medical pro-
fession do we have to create a bubble 
zone of protection? 
On Tuesday, I joined Senator PETERS 
and my colleagues in the House to in-
troduce a resolution to honor all 
healthcare providers who keep patients 
safe and healthy and do their part to 
help provide access to reproductive 
care, including abortions. 
Today, on Abortion Provider Appre-
ciation Day, I stand on the Senate 
floor to affirm my commitment to en-
suring the personal safety of all abor-
tion providers and clinic staff. I thank 
these fearless individuals for maintain-
ing abortion access to communities 
across our country. A big aloha and 
mahalo to these courageous people. 
I yield the floor.

ator from Florida. 
f 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST— 
S. 3811 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
a few days ago, the Senate heard di-
rectly from President Zelenskyy. The 
bravery and leadership we have seen 
from President Zelenskyy and the 
Ukrainian people is incredible. 
And during this call, he was very 
clear about what the Ukrainian people 
need to defend themselves against Rus-
sia’s unjustified invasion. What is un-
believable is that even after seeing hor-
rifying images on the news and hearing 
from the Ukrainian President himself, 
the Senate has done nothing to get the 
aid they so desperately need approved 
and on its way. Why? Because Senator 
CHUCK SCHUMER is holding it hostage. 
Senator SCHUMER
is keeping this 
body from voting on and passing the 
Ukrainian aid package because he is 
holding it hostage to include it in the 
$1.5 trillion omnibus. People are dying. 
Yesterday while the Senate floor was 
closed at Senator SCHUMER’s direction, 
Putin’s evil forces bombed a children’s 
hospital. 
What in the world are we doing here? 
It is heartless. It is shameful. It is a 
stain on the integrity of the Senate 
and the United States that aid for 
Ukrainians is being used as a political 
tool. 
We could have voted on the weekend. 
We could have voted on Monday or 
Tuesday or yesterday. 
But Senator SCHUMER
closed the 
floor and made it impossible to vote. 
Ukrainians are dying. It is time to end 
these games. These are stupid games. 
That is why I am asking that we imme-
diately take a vote to pass the aid to 
Ukraine. 
And I am thankful that many of my 
colleagues have joined me to make this 
request. Senators MARSHA BLACKBURN, 
JOHN
BOOZMAN, TOM
COTTON, STEVE 
DAINES, JONI ERNST, CHUCK GRASSLEY, 
CYNTHIA LUMMIS, and ROGER MARSHALL 
have all cosponsored my proposal. 
What I am asking is to pass the exact 
text—the exact text—that both the 
Democrats and Republicans, they have 
already agreed to this. We can send 
this to the President’s desk today. By 
holding this hostage in the omnibus, 
Senator SCHUMER is forcing even fur-
ther delays. The omnibus won’t go to 
President Biden’s desk until next week. 
The people of Ukraine are in the 
fight for their lives and their freedom. 
Every day the Senate waits to send 
American aid, weapons, and resources 
to help them is another day that their 
fighting against this Russian invasion 
is even made more difficult. 
There is no reason we can’t vote on 
this aid package now and pass it today. 
Waiting even 1 more day puts more 
lives at risk. Let’s act now to protect 
global freedom from Putin’s tyranny. 
Now, I will turn it over to Senator 
ROGER MARSHALL. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Kansas. 
Mr. MARSHALL. I thank Senator 
SCOTT for leading this issue. 
Mr. President, every moment of 
every day is precious, but none more so 
than when war has engulfed your home. 
It was just 3 weeks ago today, what 
now feels like an eternity, that Rus-
sian forces first invaded Ukraine’s sov-
ereign border and launched a deadly, 
unprovoked attack on the people of 
Ukraine. And since that day, the world 
has watched in horror as hundreds, per-
haps thousands, of innocent civilians— 
including children—have perished from 
gunfire and explosive weapons. More 
than 2 million people have now fled 
their homes. 
Among the Russian targets have been 
a bread factory, a maternity ward, and 
a nursery. Despite enduring the suf-
fering and being greatly outnumbered 
by Russian force strength and military 
might, the Ukrainian people have 
bravely defended their homeland, an 
inspiration for the entire world. Here 
at home, though, President Biden has 
been doing his best to fool the Amer-
ican people into thinking he is a war-
time President, but his track record 
tells a different story. 
To say the President is leading from 
behind is an understatement. 
The 
President’s handling of the Ukraine in-
vasion has been littered with missteps 
and tardiness nearly every step of the 
way, his words and actions seldom lin-
ing up. 
In 
December, 
the 
administration 
slow-walked a shipment of military 
arms 
that 
would 
have 
hardened 
Ukraine’s defenses. It took nearly a 
month for the package to be approved 
and 
the 
armaments 
to 
arrive 
in 
Ukraine. In January, Senate Repub-
licans moved to stop sanctions on the 
Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. President 
Biden dispatched his allies in this 
Chamber to filibuster the bill and 
allow the project to be slowed down. 
A month later, the President finally 
came around and moved to impose 
sanctions on the project. Last week, I 
introduced with 10 of my Republican 
colleagues to ban Russian oil imports. 
Democrats in the Senate joined in call-
ing for an announcement of such an ac-
tion during his State of the Union 
speech, but none was made. 
Always afraid to lead, it would be a 
full week later when President Biden 
would finally impose the import prohi-
bition. This President has repeatedly 
been late to act. His failure to show 
strength and take proactive maneuvers 
empowered a war criminal to move to 
reclaim one of the most prized former 
Soviet republics, a land rich with 
wheat and corn and sunflowers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1087 
March 10, 2022 
I was on a phone call with many of 
my colleagues last weekend with Presi-
dent Zelenskyy. And my friends across 
the aisle were so excited, they were so 
motivated, wanting to move quickly to 
place ammunitions and MiG–29 jets in 
the hands of the brave Ukrainians. But 
no; cowardice is contagious. Democrats 
in Congress have now taken a page out 
of our President’s playbook by settling 
on a process that would deliver this 
most recent round of military aid to 
Ukrainians more than a week after 
President Zelenskyy laid out his coun-
try’s need to Members of Congress. 
And the MiG fighter jets that are so 
desperately needed by the Ukrainians, 
they remain grounded and out of the 
hands of the sieged. Instead of a stand- 
alone bill or attaching this invaluable 
relief to the short-term CR that will be 
signed to keep the government open 
while the massive 3,000-page bill is en-
rolled and sent to the President, they 
are insisting that it remain part of the 
omnibus in order to sweeten a sour 
bunch of grapes—once again, delaying 
lifesaving aid by many days. 
At a time when our national debt is 
over $30 trillion and our government 
spent almost $2 trillion extra on gov-
ernment programs this year already, 
the bill increases discretionary spend-
ing on more than $45 billion. Indeed, we 
won’t let a crisis go to waste. 
It also funds the administration’s 
tragically misguided attempts to elec-
trify our electric fleet and implement 
the Green New Deal. All the while, we 
are witnessing a self-imposed Biden en-
ergy crisis because they have killed our 
domestic oil and gas industry by de-
claring war on American energy. 
Today, I would ask the Democrats 
partying in Philadelphia with drag 
queens 
and 
sampling 
Pennsylvania 
beers that they should jump on the 
next Amtrak train and come back and 
help us pass this Ukrainian aid imme-
diately. Let’s not force it into an omni-
bus that makes the Ukrainian people 
wait 5 more days before it would be of-
ficially signed into law. I support the 
much needed Ukrainian aid. We would 
pass it as a stand-alone piece of legisla-
tion today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Tennessee. 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. President, I 
do want to thank my colleague from 
Florida for doing the right thing for 
our partners in Ukraine by bringing up 
this supplemental appropriation for its 
own vote—its own vote. 
But this isn’t something that he 
should have had to do. It is something 
that should have been demanded by 
every Member of this Chamber. Vladi-
mir Putin is waging a war, an all-out 
war on Ukraine. He has reduced mater-
nity hospitals, orphanages, schools, 
and private homes to piles of rubble. 
He has boobytrapped humanitarian 
corridors. He is using weapons so hor-
rific that to possess them constitutes a 
war crime. And he is preparing to ter-
rorize civilians with the same proxy 
fighters that have brutalized innocents 
in Mali and in Syria. 
And here we stand as our Democrat 
colleagues try to use an aid bill for 
Ukraine to link onto its back a $1.5 
trillion spending spree. 
At last count, there are more than 
4,000 earmarks in this omnibus spend-
ing bill. 
You and I have been through the 
issue of earmarks when we each were 
Members in the House. Earmarks, 4,000 
of them, this bill is divisive, controver-
sial, and requires actual deliberation 
and debate. It should not be used as a 
vehicle to hold this emergency funding 
for Ukraine hostage. 
The fact that we even have to have 
this discussion is just disrespectful of 
the process. And it does not help the 
Ukrainian people. It slows down the aid 
to them. It is time to stop this manipu-
lation in its tracks. 
We need to give the people of Ukraine 
airpower. We need to give them human-
itarian aid. And it needs to be done 
now. We need to give them the funding 
and the support that they need to sur-
vive, and it should be done now. And 
we need to separate this supplemental 
from this $1.5 trillion spending spree, 
and it ought to be done now. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I also 
rise to protest the manner in which 
funding for the people of Ukraine has 
been strapped to this spending bill, 
thereby delaying aid to Ukraine and 
strapping it to a bill that is going to 
need days to get to the President’s 
desk so it is in good shape. 
I have been following—just as you 
have—the unfolding humanitarian cri-
sis in Ukraine, and I am incredibly con-
cerned for the people there: the women 
and children who have been murdered 
in the streets by Vladimir Putin’s 
bombs, the housing complexes that 
have been destroyed, the maternity 
hospital that was bombed just yester-
day, all from unprovoked Russian ag-
gression. 
We want to help these people. The 
people of Wyoming whom I represent 
want to help these people. 
Because of this, I was particularly 
appalled at the decision by congres-
sional Democrats to include Ukraine 
aid funding in the massive government 
funding omnibus bill that we are start-
ing to consider. 
We could get this Ukraine money on 
its way today. We could get it to the 
President’s desk today. Most of us 
agree. I think it would be unanimous 
to send the money to Ukraine. 
As a former House Member and a 
longtime legislator, I know that any 
big piece of legislation has good pieces 
and bad or, as former U.S. Senator Al 
Simpson used to say, ‘‘some spinach.’’ 
But this is a cynical approach to legis-
lating. 
It forces Members of Congress to 
make an unnecessary choice: choose 
between helping the Ukrainian people 
and further indebting our own con-
stituents. It is a cynical ploy, and it is 
cynical because of what is in the rest of 
bill, the omnibus spending bill. At a 
time when the United States is over $30 
trillion in debt, instead of taking a se-
rious look at our budget, we are piling 
on. 
We are increasing nondefense discre-
tionary spending by 7 percent, even 
though inflation this year is more than 
7 percent. Worse still, the omnibus con-
tinues to fund President Biden’s vac-
cine mandates, even after the Presi-
dent himself called for a return to nor-
mal. This bill also contains anti-Sec-
ond 
Amendment 
provisions 
that 
threaten the rights of law-abiding citi-
zens in Wyoming. Finally, after ban-
ning the practice for years, this omni-
bus contains around $10 billion in ear-
marks for pet projects around the 
country. 
Here is the book of earmarks. Look 
how thick this is. It is printed on both 
sides in about 4-point font. You almost 
have to have a looking glass to see 
what is in here—4,000 earmarks after 
we had gotten away from this. 
I am sympathetic to the argument 
that earmarks are a more direct way of 
addressing problems around the coun-
try, but historically they have been 
abused as a way for leadership to whip 
votes on bad legislation and a way to 
fund unnecessary pet projects to curry 
favor back home. 
But instead of having a debate about 
these and other concerns of the mas-
sive spending bill, Ukraine funding was 
dropped in here in an effort to get 
Members to vote for a bad bill so we 
can get funding to Ukraine. 
We should have a stand-alone vote on 
the aid for the people of Ukraine. This 
issue is entirely separate from the om-
nibus spending bill that Congress is 
considering and should be recognized as 
such on the Senate floor. Anything less 
does a disservice to the people we are 
trying to help and to the American 
people we serve. 
I am proud of Senator RICK SCOTT for 
calling for a separate vote to help the 
people of Ukraine. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
I want to thank my colleague from Wy-
oming. I want to thank my colleagues 
from Kansas and from Tennessee for 
their interest in making sure that we 
get Ukraine aid to the citizens of 
Ukraine today. 
I ask unanimous consent that at a 
time to be determined by the majority 
leader, following consultation with the 
Republican leader, the Senate proceed 
to the consideration of S. 3811, which is 
at the desk; that there be 2 hours for 
debate, equally divided in the usual 
form; and that upon the use or yielding 
back of time, the bill be read a third 
time and the Senate vote on passage of 
the bill without intervening action or 
debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1088 
March 10, 2022 
The Senator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I want 
to reserve the right to object. 
I have been listening to the argu-
ments that are made here. Let’s get to 
the facts. 
The fact is, if we split this Ukrainian 
funding now, it is not going to get 
there quicker; it is going to get there 
slower. 
The bottom line is, if you want to 
help the Ukrainian people out—and I 
believe the speakers want to help the 
Ukrainian people out—then pass the 
omnibus bill that is in front of us. 
The Senator from Florida is pro-
posing just to pass one portion of this 
omnibus appropriations bill, and that 
is the $13.5 billion in aid to Ukraine. 
I want to be very, very clear on what 
this move would mean. If we don’t pass 
the rest of the omnibus, the Pentagon 
is going to shut down at midnight on 
Friday. OK? 
Now, all our eyes are on Ukraine, and 
they well should be, but don’t forget 
for a second that China is a pacing 
threat to this world. We are going to 
shut the Pentagon down on Friday? I 
don’t think that is a smart move. 
Eleven days ago, all the Senators in 
this body had the opportunity to go to 
a classified briefing led by Secretary of 
Defense Lloyd Austin. I asked him 
what he needed from Congress to re-
spond to the Russian aggression. Do 
you know what he said? He said: We 
need a full-year appropriations bill. 
That is what we have in front of us 
today. 
And yet, the Senator from Florida is 
effectively proposing to give the mili-
tary less than 1 percent of what the 
Secretary of Defense says he needs to 
respond to threats around the world. 
That is $6.5 billion out of $744 billion. 
And for the folks who say this $1.5 
trillion package is a boondoggle, well, 
let me tell you, then you should stand 
up and say half of this bill is a boon-
doggle because half of it goes into de-
fense to protect this country, to make 
the world a safer place. 
I really don’t understand what the 
Senator from Florida is trying to ac-
complish, but I want no part of it. 
Congress should have passed this 
budget to cover the military needs and 
cover this country’s needs over 6 
months ago. 
Passing a bill to cover 1 percent of 
our troops’ funding needs is, once 
again, kicking the can down the road. 
It is 110 percent unacceptable to me 
and to every American who expects 
their government to keep them safe at 
home and around the world. 
This is really, really, really a bad 
idea, and we should quit wasting time 
on these kinds of ideas and get to the 
point of voting on this omnibus bill, 
getting it out so that we can deal with 
the Ukraine situation. 
And by the way, in the Defense bill, 
over and above the $13.5 billion, there 
is another $300 million for Ukraine. So 
it is time to get this ball rolling. It is 
time to get this bill passed in the U.S. 
Senate. 
Quit dilly-dallying around. Let’s get 
‘er done. There is too much on the line 
today to keep fooling around. 
I object. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
The Senator from Florida. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Mr. President, 
it is hard to express my anger and frus-
tration. 
What in the hell are we doing here? 
I asked for the Senate to do a very 
simple thing: vote today on desperately 
needed aid for Ukraine, and Senate 
Democrats have blocked it. 
This is the exact text—the exact 
text—that both Democrats and Repub-
licans have already agreed to. 
People need to know exactly why 
Democrats have blocked this common-
sense bill. I know. It is because they 
are following orders from Senator 
SCHUMER to block passage of aid to 
Ukraine so we can continue to hold it 
hostage in the omnibus. 
That is what we are dealing with 
here. 
We could send this to the President’s 
desk today, but Senate Democrats have 
said no because they are insisting that 
it be passed with the omnibus. 
The omnibus is $1.5 trillion, 2,700 
pages; as my colleague from Wyoming 
said, 4,000 earmarks. Senator SCHUMER 
alone has 150 earmarks, $600,000 for a 
greenhouse in New York, $3 million for 
museum galleries in Brooklyn. 
I mean, to him, the omnibus is just a 
joke. It is a way to send some money 
home. 
Today, inflation just hit 7.9 percent— 
another 40-year high. And contrary to 
what President Biden just said this 
morning, that is just for February. 
That massive spike in inflation doesn’t 
reflect the big price hikes we have seen 
in March. The truth is, we have no idea 
how the omnibus will impact inflation, 
and we haven’t anywhere near the time 
we need to actually read it. 
This whole process is broken, and it 
reminds me of a truth here in Wash-
ington: In Washington, compromise 
means that both sides get everything 
they want, and no one has to make a 
tough choice. Put simply, when Wash-
ington settles, taxpayers all across this 
country lose. 
Americans should be furious with 
Congress. Ukrainians should be abso-
lutely furious with us. While Russian 
bombs are being dropped on their 
homes, cities, and hospitals, Democrats 
in the Senate are blocking the approval 
of American aid so that they can play 
politics. Every day that Senator SCHU-
MER refuses to allow a vote is a big gift 
from Senate Democrats to Putin. 
I am actually disgusted by what hap-
pened here today. To see aid for 
Ukraine used as a political tool is 
heartless. It is a stain on the integrity 
of the Senate and the United States. A 
fight for freedom and democracy rages 
in 
Europe, 
and 
Senate 
Democrats 
should be ashamed by what Senator 
SCHUMER has forced each of you to do 
today. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Montana. 
Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, the 
House is not in session. To say that we 
are going to pass this and presto 
chango it goes right to the President’s 
desk—that is not how the process 
works, Senator SCOTT. That is not how 
the process works. 
So you can stand up and say, you 
know, we are blocking this aid. No, no, 
no, no, no. 
The fact is, the person who came up 
and asked for unanimous consent—the 
good Senator from Florida—is blocking 
this bill or we would be voting on it 
right now. 
You want to talk politics? That is 
what this is about—politics. 
You can be unhappy with the omni-
bus bill, but the fact of the matter is, 
it has been negotiated over the last 
year by Democrats and Republicans, 
and that is where we are at today. 
We need to pass this bill. If you are 
concerned about Ukraine, we need to 
pass this bill. If you are concerned 
about feeding hungry people in this 
country, we need to pass this bill. If 
you are concerned about childcare, we 
need to pass this bill. If you are con-
cerned about housing, we need to pass 
this bill. If you are concerned about 
the high cost of gasoline, we need to 
pass this bill. And if you are concerned 
about the threat that China is to this 
country, we need to the pass this bill. 
Enough excuses. Let’s get the job 
done. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without

The President pro tempore. 
f 
H.R. 2471 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, be-
fore I even start, I do want to com-
pliment the staff—later, I will put all 
of the names in the RECORD—who 
worked weekends and late at night. I 
remember times when I would get off 
the phone with them at 11 o’clock at 
night and 12 midnight. I could go to 
bed, but they were still there working 
until 3 or 4 in the morning. 
Yet, after all of those months of ne-
gotiations, the Committee on Appro-
priations introduced the $1.5 trillion 
fiscal year 2022 Omnibus appropriations 
bill. As I will explain, this is the con-
solidation of 12 annual appropriations 
bills to fund the Federal Government 
for the remainder of the fiscal year. 
Last night, the House passed it on a bi-
partisan basis. It is now before us, and 
we need to act on it quickly. 
Our annual appropriations bills are 
where we reflect on our national prior-
ities. In total, this bill includes $730 
billion in nondefense funding. That is a 
$46 billion increase over fiscal year 
2021. This 6.7-percent increase is the 
largest in 4 years for nondefense pro-
grams. It allows for significant invest-
ments in the American people that will 
expand the middle class. 
The bill also provides urgent funding 
for the people of Ukraine as they battle 
Vladimir Putin’s immoral, unprovoked, 
and 
brutal 
invasion—an 
invasion 
which, actually, labels Vladimir Putin 
as a ‘‘war criminal.’’ 
It is unquestionably in the interest of 
the American people that the Senate 
act quickly to pass this bill and send it 
to President Biden. I will tell you why 
it is so important. 
In the wake of the pandemic, chil-
dren and schools across the country 
have been falling behind in math and 
reading, and children in low-income 
and minority communities have been 
falling even further behind their peers. 
One study found that third graders who 
are attending school in low-income 
communities tested 17 points lower in 
math than they did just in 2019. We 
can’t allow a global pandemic to set 
these children further back on the path 
to a bright future. 
The bill includes $17.5 billion—the 
largest increase in more than a dec-
ade—for title I-A grants. These grants 
provide funding for more than half of 
our Nation’s public schools to help stu-
dents, particularly in low-income com-
munities, meet college and career- 
ready academic standards. 
And to help these children succeed 
before they even step foot in the class-
room, the bill includes more than $11 
billion for Head Start. The bill also in-
creases the maximum Pell Grant award 
by $400—also the largest increase in 
more than a decade—so that as these 
students succeed they can go on to pur-
sue a college education. Pell Grants 
help more than 7 million students pur-
sue a postsecondary education every 
year. 
Now, of course, we are investing in 
these children, but we are also invest-
ing in their families. Ask any young 
family and they will tell you that the 
pandemic exacerbated the childcare 
crisis. 
Parents, 
and 
particularly 
women, are being forced out of the

labor market because they cannot af-
ford the high cost of childcare. The bill 
provides more than $6 billion for 
childcare 
and 
development 
block 
grants. That is a 4.4-percent increase 
over last year. These grants will assist 
low-income families in gaining quality 
childcare that fits their needs to pre-
pare their children to succeed in 
school. 
Across this country—the wealthiest 
and most powerful Nation on Earth— 
more than 38 million people, including 
12 million children, are what can be 
called food insecure. Many of us in this 
room cannot even imagine the heart-
break and pain a parent must feel when 
they cannot put enough food on the 
table for their child. So the bill in-
creases support for nutrition programs. 
These programs are a lifeline to these 
American families. 
It also ensures that over 4 million 
low-income women and children will 
not see their benefits reduced at the 
end of April by extending the WIC 
Cash-Value Voucher Program. It is a 
special $35 monthly benefit for pur-
chasing fruits and vegetables. It fully 
funds $6 billion for the Special Supple-
mental Nutrition Program for Women, 
Infants and Children—WIC—to help 
support 6.2 million low-income women, 
infants and children younger than 5 
years old every month. It also includes 
more than $140 billion, which is a 23- 
percent increase, for SNAP. SNAP pro-
vides assistance to more than 40 mil-
lion people every year in this country. 
It also keeps families in their homes 
by providing billions of dollars to build 
and support public housing. This in-
cludes a 75-percent increase for Choice 
Neighborhoods, which helps to trans-
form communities by revitalizing pub-
lic and assisted housing. It provides an 
11-percent increase to build new afford-
able housing through the HOME pro-
gram. And it includes $4.8 billion for 
community 
and 
economic 
develop-
ment. 
We understand that hundreds of 
thousands of Americans are homeless. 
The 2020 Annual Homeless Assessment 
Report found that on a single night 
more than 580,000 people experienced 
homelessness. People who are strug-
gling with homelessness have been 
robbed of a central pillar of the Amer-
ican Dream—having a place that they 
can call their own. The bill provides $3 
billion—a 
6.6-percent 
increase—for 
homeless assistance grants. 
We know it is a bipartisan priority in 
Congress to keep our communities safe 
so the bill provides a 15-percent in-
crease 
for 
Department 
of 
Justice 
grants to State and local law enforce-
ment and communities to prevent and 
respond to crime. It provides COPS 
Hiring grant funding to place more 
than 1,700 officers on the streets to 
keep our communities safe. But as a 
country, we have collectively grieved 
the loss of life that inspired the Black 
Lives Matter movement. So this bill 
provides new resources to fund deesca-
lation training, implicit bias training, 
training that emphasizes the duty of 
fellow officers to intervene, and pro-
viding crisis intervention teams. 
It is also a commitment to the future 
of scientific research, development, 
and innovation in this country. It pro-
vides the largest increase in 12 years 
for the National Science Foundation. 
The NSF funds a quarter of all feder-
ally supported basic research con-
ducted by colleges and universities in 
this country. It provides a 6-percent in-
crease for the Department of Energy 
Office of Science and a 5.3-percent in-
crease for the National Institutes of 
Health to speed the development of 
new therapies, diagnostics, and pre-
ventative measures. 
I think it also, importantly, includes 
$1 billion to launch the Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency for Health, the 
ARPA-H, as President Biden’s bold and 
promising proposal to revolutionize 
how we prevent, treat, and cure dev-
astating diseases like cancer, Alz-
heimer’s, and diabetes. 
Marcelle, my wife, and I had the op-
portunity to listen to then-Vice Presi-
dent Biden speak about this at the Uni-
versity of Vermont’s medical school a 
few years ago and then again to hear 
President 
Biden, 
Vice 
President 
KAMALA
HARRIS, and Dr. Jill Biden 
speak about it at the White House. I 
was committed to making sure that it 
would be in the Omnibus bill, and I am 
pleased that it was included and that 
that request was joined by numerous 
other Senators. 
The bill closes the chapter on 4 years 
of denying the existence of the climate 
crisis by the previous administration. 
It provides billions of dollars to sup-
port climate research, mitigation, and 
adaptation. This includes $900 million 
in NSF funding to support climate and 
clean energy research, $40 million for 
NOAA climate-related projects, $425 
million for clean air programs, and an 
historic investment in Energy Effi-
ciency and Renewable Energy, EERE. 
We also provide hundreds of millions 
of dollars to support international cli-
mate change adaptation and mitiga-
tion programs. We included this fund-
ing because the scientific communities 
are in agreement that we are running 
out of time before the damage to our 
planet is irreversible. So we are taking 
a small but long-overdue step to con-
front that reality. 
The bill also backs up our commit-
ment to our veterans. It provides $97.5 
billion—an 8.7-percent increase—for VA 
medical care. That provides essential 
health services for 9.2 million veterans, 
those men and women who have served 
our country and whom we always 
promised to back up, as they did us. 
Now, we are. This includes funding for 
rural health programs, veterans’ home-
lessness prevention, and mental health 
resources. 
Consistent with long tradition, the 
bill includes billions of dollars for food 
and other humanitarian aid for victims 
of war and natural disasters, $700 mil-
lion to support global health security 
programs to prevent and prepare for fu-
ture pandemics, and it provides the 
funds to support PEPFAR’s global HIV- 
AIDS program. 
It provides the funds to support our 
embassies and other foreign missions 
around the world. And it supports orga-
nizations like the Global Fund to Fight 
HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria, the Na-
tional Endowment for Democracy, the 
U.S. Institute of Peace, the Peace 
Corps, the Millennium Challenge Cor-
poration, and the International Devel-
opment Finance Corporation. 
Anybody who is watching the news 
knows what is happening with the war 
crimes that are being imposed on 
Ukraine by a much larger neighbor, 
Russia, under the unbelievable, irre-
sponsible leadership of Vladimir Putin. 
So we have included a $13.6 billion bi-
partisan agreement to provide emer-
gency assistance to Ukraine and our 
NATO allies—$13.6 billion. That has the 
necessary resources to bolster the de-
fense capabilities of the Ukrainian 
military but also our regional allies 
and partners. It also supports the im-
plementation of economic sanctions 
and export restrictions on Russia. 
Importantly, it addresses the evolv-
ing humanitarian crisis—this horrible, 
tragic humanitarian crisis—that has 
resulted 
from 
President 
Putin’s 
unprovoked attack on the Ukrainian 
people, an attack I call a war crime. 
The escalating crisis President Putin 
has inflicted on Europe poses the great-
est threat to democracy and sov-
ereignty in a generation. 
The American people overwhelm-
ingly support the people of Ukraine. 
This is not a Democratic or Republican 
issue; this is a human rights issue. This 
is where America stands with the peo-
ple of Ukraine. 
I remember a few years ago when I 
was chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Committee, I joined with my friend 
MIKE CRAPO, another Senator, and we 
reauthorized 
the 
Violence 
Against 
Women Act. We dramatically increased 
it and improved it. We added Native 
Americans, we added the LGBTQ com-
munity, and we added the sexual ex-
ploitation of children. 
Well, the Violence Against Women 
Act has been stuck. It hasn’t been re-
authorized. This bill reauthorizes the 
Violence Against Women Act. 
VAWA continues to be one of the 
most consequential laws addressing the 
scourge of violence against women and 
domestic violence in our country. I re-
member how bad it was when I was a 
prosecutor, but it has become far, far 
worse today. We need the tool of 
VAWA, and the bill includes the high-
est funding level ever of grants to sup-
port these programs. It provides cru-
cial support for programs and initia-
tives designed to support survivors of 
domestic violence, sexual assault, dat-
ing violence, and stalking. 
Of note, this bill also reforms and re-
authorizes the EB–5 Visa program, 
which has been abused by corrupt ac-
tors for too long. I have championed

these bipartisan reforms for many 
years, and I am proud that we are fi-
nally going to enact them. 
In total, the bill includes $730 billion 
in nondefense funding, a 6.7-percent in-
crease. The bill includes, $782 billion in 
defense funding, a 5.6-percent increase 
over fiscal year 2021. 
This is a product of months of nego-
tiations—sometimes weekends, some-
times evenings, sometimes days, over 
and over again—negotiations between 
myself and dear friends Vice Chairman 
SHELBY and House Chair DELAURO and 
Ranking Member GRANGER. 
I mentioned earlier our staffs who 
spent countless late nights working 
through the details of this bill. Those 
are not just weekday nights; those are 
weekends too, giving up plans they 
might have had, personal plans, family 
plans, whatever. So I think of specifi-

more who worked those nights and 
days—far too many names to say right 
now. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent to have a list of the staff print-

Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, this 
is a good bill. It is a bill that reflects 
American priorities and invests in fu-
ture prosperity and our health. It re-
duces everyday costs for millions of 
Americans, such as childcare, a college 
education, and heating and cooling 
costs. It is a bill that invests in us— 
us—the American people. 
We know that a government shut-
down on Saturday would be senseless. 
Look at the impression it would give 
the rest of the world when we are tell-
ing everybody to stand up and be 
strong. We know that a delay would be 
senseless, so I strongly urge all Mem-
bers to vote aye when the bill comes to 
the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
REMEMBERING GEORGE NETTELS, JR. 
Mr. MORAN. Madam President, I rise 
today on a solemn occasion. I rise in 
memory of George Nettels, Jr., a man 
who lived a life of service to his com-
munity and to our State. 
Affectionately referred to as ‘‘the 
face of Pittsburg’’—Pittsburg, KS, that 
is—George was a loving husband to 
Josie and a devoted father to Chris, 
Meg, Kate, and Becky. He was born in 
Pittsburg, KS—the very southeast cor-
ner of our State—where his dedication, 
hard work, and thirst for adventure 
was cultivated. 
As a young man, George joined the 
U.S. Army in the closing years of 
World War II. Upon his return home, he 
attended the University of Kansas, 
where he was a letterman on the swim 
team and graduated with a degree in 
civil engineering. 
George spent most of his career in his 
beloved hometown, where he became 
the proud owner of Midwest Minerals, a 
crushed limestone aggregate and agri-
cultural lime supplier with a strong 
four-State presence. 
In 1966, he served as the chairman of 
the Kansas Republican Party and the 
National Limestone Institute, so civic 
and politics, as well as his devotion to 
his profession and those it employed. It 
was the preceding association to what 
we in Washington, DC, and across the 
country know as the National Stone, 
Sand and Gravel Association. 
His work at the National Limestone 
Institute led to his appointment in 1970 
as president and CEO of McNally Man-
ufacturing, which started as a small 
boiler shop and helped transform Pitts-
burg into a Southeast Kansas indus-
trial powerhouse. 
George’s leadership included serving 
as chairman of the National Associa-
tion of Manufacturers and as director 
of Kansas City Power and Light. 
In 1986, the Native Sons and Daugh-
ters of Kansas honored him with the 
distinction of Kansan of the Year—a 
fitting tribute for his life of service to 
his community, State, and profession. 
His deep involvement in civic busi-
ness and philanthropic endeavors kept 
him busy in Pittsburg, where he served 
as president of the chamber of com-
merce, chairman of the Mt. Carmel 
Hospital board of trustees, a member of 
the United Way, and president of 
USD—Unified 
School 
District—250 
Board of Education. His devotion to 
Pittsburg’s public schools is one he in-
herited from his father, who spear-
headed a campaign to build an elemen-
tary school that ultimately would be 
named for him. 
George Nettels’ appetite for adven-
ture led him to 24 countries, skydiving 
in tandem with his grandson, Jack—he 
did that at age 84—and taking a 6-day 
bike tour through the hills of Italy. 
Whether around the world or at home, 
he never turned down a new physical 
challenge, which led him to being 
named the honorary starter of the Get 
Busy Livin’ 5K Run and Friendship 
Walk in Pittsburg at 87 years old. 
I heard this story from one of my 
staff, who saw George jogging in 100-de-
gree heat just over 2 years ago. Wor-
rying about his age and the heat, my 
staffer offered George a ride, to which 
he replied: 
I grew up working in this heat and it 
doesn’t bother me one bit. 
George learned from his father that 
life is a gift and the length is not guar-
anteed. He took that lesson to heart, 
making sure that while he was on 
Earth, he bettered his hometown, made 
countless memories with his family 
and friends, and was always ready for 
an adventure. 
Southeast Kansas’s dynamic indus-
trial sector, the city of Pittsburg, and 
our entire State have George Nettels, 
Jr., to thank for his advocacy, leader-
ship, and commitment to excellence. 
Robba and I extend our deepest sym-
pathies to his family and friends and 
all those who knew and loved him. 
REMEMBERING ROGER KEMP 
Madam President, I rise as the entire 
Kansas City community mourns the 
death of Roger Kemp. 
Over the years, Roger and I became 
close friends, and I knew him to be a 
passionate member of the Kansas City 
community. Nowhere was this passion 
and drive more evident than his work 
following the death of his daughter. 
In 2002, Roger and his wife Kathy’s 
daughter Ali was murdered at the age 
of 19 while she was working at a local 
pool as a lifeguard. 
Living through a parent’s worst 
nightmare, Roger channeled his grief 
into bringing his daughter’s murderer 
to account for this heinous crime. 
Roger demanded nothing less than ab-
solute justice for his daughter. He 
worked tirelessly, including through a 
billboard advertisement campaign, to 
find Ali’s killer. This campaign not

only worked to bring her killer to jus-
tice but led law enforcement, both lo-
cally and nationally, to adopt a similar 
strategy that has been credited with 
helping to apprehend hundreds of other 
suspected killers. 
His work did not stop there. Roger 
wanted to devote his life and his efforts 
to making certain that other women, 
other young girls, were not caught de-
fenseless as Ali was and that no other 
parent had to experience the torment 
and loss that he and Kathy endured. So 
Roger founded The Ali Kemp Edu-
cational Foundation and T.A.K.E. De-
fense programs. An honor student, Ali 
was, at both Blue Valley North High 
School and Kansas State University; 
her life was just getting started. She 
had just finished her freshman year at 
K-State, where she was a member of Pi 
Beta Phi sorority and a volunteer in 
her church. 
But even though it was tragically cut 
short, Ali’s tragic death touched thou-
sands of people, and The Ali Kemp Edu-
cational Foundation continues to posi-
tively impact the lives of many and al-
lows her legacy to live on. 
‘‘I don’t care what it cost to do this 
program,’’ Roger said. ‘‘If we save one 
life out there, it’s worth it.’’ 
That was Roger’s mantra, and he 
lived up to it. Over the nearly 20 years 
since its founding, The Ali Kemp Edu-
cational Foundation and its T.A.K.E. 
Defense programs have trained more 
than 70,000 girls and women across the 
country, ranging from the ages of 12 to 
90, no doubt saving more than one life. 
Roger was an active member and 
served on the board of directors of the 
Ad Hoc Commission Against Crime and 
on the committee which reviewed and 
awarded grants to shelters and homes 
for victims of abuse for three different 
Kansas attorneys general. 
But it wasn’t just those of us in Kan-
sas that recognized just how special a 
person Roger was. In 2011, I had the 
honor 
of 
successfully 
nominating 
Roger to receive the Presidential Citi-
zens Medal, the second highest civilian 
award presented by a President. He was 
1 of 13 recipients out of more than 6,000 
nominees. 
I think a quote from the foundation 
he created in Ali’s honor perfectly cap-
tures who he was, and it reads: 
Roger’s faith in the American justice sys-
tem; his belief that 99 percent of the world is 
good, his powerful love for his daughter Ali 
and sons Tyler and Drew and his deep dedica-
tion to his wife Kathy drove him every day, 
fighting the good fight, to make our world a 
better place. 
Roger Kemp was a loving father and 
husband, a dedicated member of his 
community, and a man who created 
good from the devastating disaster, the 
murder of his daughter. 
Our thoughts and prayers are with 
Kathy, Tyler, and Drew and all who 
knew and loved Roger in this time of 
sorrow. I am honored to have consid-
ered him a friend, and it comforts me 
to know that he has reunited once 
more with Ali. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
UKRAINE 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, 
Vladimir Putin’s brutal invasion of 
Ukraine rests on the false historic 
claim that Ukraine is not a real coun-
try but a part of Russia. 
Both Ukraine and Russia trace their 
roots to ancient civilizations centered 
in Kyiv. Kyiv was a major city when 
Moscow was a backwater that no one 
had heard of. 
The devastating and brutal Mongol 
invasion in the 13th century changed 
everything. 
Collaboration 
with 
the 
Mongols allowed Muscovy, the prede-
cessor of modern Russia, to become a 
dominant regional power. Meanwhile, 
the Grand Duchy of Lithuania exerted 
control over much of what is now West-
ern Ukraine, giving it a very Western 
European perspective. 
Russia, since the Mongol invasion, 
has been ruled with an iron fist. By 
contrast, Ukraine has been home to the 
Cossacks, who embody a sense of free-
dom and individual autonomy. Just 
think of Ukrainian Cossacks as the 
equivalent of the American cowboys of 
the Wild West. They hated serfdom and 
oppressive government and sought to 
elect their own rulers, which they 
called a hetman. 
A Cossack state using the name 
Ukraine in what is now Ukraine’s 
southeast became a major power in the 
mid-17th century. Then, when Cath-
erine the Great conquered that Ukrain-
ian state, she is recorded as having 
said: 
Every effort should be made to eradicate 
them and their age from memory. 
Ukrainians’ strong national identity 
threatens the claim of Russian nation-
alists to be the heir to the ancient 
Kyiv civilization. When Ukrainians re-
volted against the Soviet collectiviza-
tion of agriculture dictated from Mos-
cow, Stalin seized the Ukrainian wheat 
harvest and food stores, starving mil-
lions of Ukrainians to death. This is re-
membered as Holodomor, which means 
‘‘extermination by hunger’’ in the 
Ukrainian language. 
Putin rehabilitated the image of Sta-
lin and banned the human rights orga-
nization memorial which investigated 
Stalin’s 
crimes 
against 
humanity. 
Putin is following, then, in a long tra-
dition of Russian nationalists and the 
autocrats associated with it who have 
tried to stamp out Ukrainian national 
identity. 
When Putin talks about being threat-
ened by NATO, he does not mean he 
thinks the Russian Federation faces a 
military threat. Until Russia invaded 
and occupied Crimea and portions of 
Eastern Ukraine, our NATO allies bor-
dering Russia hosted no troops from 
other NATO countries. Today, there 
are a small number of U.S. troops in 
NATO’s eastern flank which were rein-
forced only as a result of the current 
Russian invasion of Ukraine. But these 
defensive troops are still dwarfed by 
the number of Russian military per-
sonnel in Russia’s western military dis-
trict. NATO does not have enough 
troops deployed to repel an invasion, 
much less to be considered an offensive 
threat to Russia. 
What Putin is really threatened by is 
that Ukraine, true to the history I just 
gave you, is asserting an independent 
path. They don’t like that independent 
path because it separates them from 
Russia. Ironically—in fact, very iron-
ically—his aggressive actions to date 
have 
only 
unified 
Ukrainians 
in 
Ukraine’s determination to be free of 
Russian influence. Putin has pushed 
Ukraine toward the European Union 
and toward NATO. 
Putin seems to believe his own twist-
ed view of history, so he convinced 
himself that the current freely elected 
government of Ukraine is not sup-
ported by the Ukrainian people. Putin 
thought that he could topple President 
Zelenskyy and appoint a puppet gov-
ernment. 
Putin thought Ukrainians would not 
fight. Boy, has he been proven to be 
wrong—really 
wrong. 
Putin 
cannot 
achieve his goal since the Ukrainians 
will never, never accept Russian domi-
nation. So Putin has taken to leveling 
civilian areas, cynically agreeing to 
humanitarian corridors to allow fami-
lies to escape, only to shoot those who 
have 
gathered, 
bombing 
maternity 
wards, killing many women and babies. 
And, of course, as you see every day on 
television, the atrocities can only get 
worse. 
We must provide Ukraine with every-
thing it might need to stop the mass 
murders. That includes military air-
craft, drones, anti-aircraft systems, 
anti-missile systems—almost anything 
they need—and we must do it now. 
I wanted more arms and sanctions 
before the invasion happened. We saw 
that invasion coming. Any bureau-
cratic delays now are unacceptable. 
Our Eastern European allies acted with 
lightning speed. We seem to follow 
them. Our European allies were giving 
up weapons that they need for deter-
rence in their own defense, and then we 
followed. We ought to continue to fol-
low their example; but instead of fol-
lowing, we should be leading. And we 
should agree to fill any gaps caused by 
past and future donations of weapons 
to Ukraine by frontline allies. 
Ukraine’s success and its defense will 
prevent a wider war that will cost more 
in lives and resources. It is in our in-
terest to do everything we can to stop 
the Russian terror campaign now. We 
should be leading—not leading from be-
hind. We should lead NATO—not follow 
NATO. 
We should be the great United States 
of America that we are because we are 
dealing with a sick autocrat, probably 
with an ego that has to be satisfied; 
and it is all totally understandable, ex-
cept that somebody is very sick. 
I yield the floor.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1093 
March 10, 2022 
Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the following Senators be 
permitted to speak prior to the sched-
uled votes: myself for up to 15 minutes, 
Senator PAUL for up to 15 minutes, 
Senator MENENDEZ for up to 7 minutes, 
and Senator RISCH for up to 5. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF MARIA L. PAGAN 
Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the 
Senate will soon vote on the nomina-
tion of Maria Pagan to serve as Deputy 
U.S. Trade Representative and our 
envoy to the World Trade Organization 
in Geneva. 
This vote has been a long time com-
ing; and in a moment, I am going to 
talk about Ms. Pagan’s extensive quali-
fications and her long experience. But, 
first, Madam President and colleagues, 
there is a new urgency today for the 
Senate to confirm Ms. Pagan with 
strong bipartisan support. 
The 
Russians’ 
inhuman 
behavior 
means that they have forfeited the 
right to enjoy the fruits of the post- 
World War II international order. 
The World Trade Organization is one 
of the key venues where the United 
States and our economic allies must 
hold Russia accountable for its illegal 
and unjustifiable war in Ukraine. It 
means the United States and our eco-
nomic allies basically have to go to the 
World Trade Organization and tell Rus-
sia: Go fly a kite. 
Now, here in the Congress, as the 
chairman of the Senate Finance Com-
mittee, I am working with the ranking 
member, Senator MIKE CRAPO; House 
Ways and Means Chairman RICHIE 
NEAL; and Ranking Member KEVIN 
BRADY on legislation that would re-
voke Russia’s permanent normal trade 
status with the United States. This is 
part of suspending Russia’s benefits at 
the World Trade Organization and 
would mean Russia’s exports to the 
United States would immediately be 
hit with significant tariffs. 
Our country has led the effort to 
ratchet up sanctions against Russia to 
levels nobody has seen. 
Russia’s economy is in free fall, and 
there is no question that hitting 
Putin’s tight circle of oligarchs who 
dominate Russia’s largest industries 
will pay off. Taking away Russia’s 
trade benefits is an essential next step 
that will help to freeze Russia out of 
key markets around the world. 
As our Envoy to the World Trade Or-
ganization, Ms. Pagan would be our 
point person coordinating this effort. 
She will be the one coordinating with 
like-minded countries and intervening 
in support of Ukraine. That is why it is 
so important that she be confirmed 
today and why it is so important that 
she have strong backing from both 
sides of the aisle. 
Now, her nomination won bipartisan 
support in the Senate Finance Com-
mittee. The Finance Committee ap-
proved her nomination by a vote of 27 
to 1, so we are talking about near- 
unanimous support—certainly some-
thing of a rare sight in the Congress 
these days. She got that support be-
cause she is a highly experienced pub-
lic servant who knows how to get the 
best possible deal for our workers and 
our farmers and our businesses. 
Over three decades in government, 
she has served at both the Department 
of Commerce and at the Office of the 
USTR. She is an expert in a variety of 
fields. From trade in services to gov-
ernment procurement, she has litigated 
several disputes before the World Trade 
Organization. She now serves as deputy 
general counsel at the office of the U.S. 
Trade 
Representative, 
the 
person 
called in when issues are particularly 
challenging. She was recently at the 
center of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada nego-
tiations, and she was key to helping 
Democrats guarantee that the final 
deal would be enforceable. That was a 
must-have for all Americans; other-
wise, the agreement wasn’t going to 
pass. 
Working through the WTO to isolate 
Russia is just going to be one part of 
her job. There are critical negotiations 
at WTO that absolutely have to move 
forward. These include COVID vaccines 
and the unfair fisheries subsidies that 
do so much damage to our environment 
and our fishing industry. 
The WTO itself has big issues that 
have to be addressed. Its rules are out 
of date, and its procedures move too 
slowly to keep up with a modern econ-
omy. 
The Chinese Government, for exam-
ple, takes advantage of the World 
Trade Organization’s current short-
comings to game the trade system, and 
they do it at the expense of American 
jobs, growth, and innovation. A system 
that is intended to produce ironclad, 
predictable rules is now opening up 
loopholes that trade rip-off artists are 
exploiting. 
Ms. Pagan understands these chal-
lenges that I described. She is equipped 
to confront these issues. She is a prov-
en negotiator and a strong advocate for 
American workers and farmers and 
businesses. 
She has secured significant support 
from Democrats and Republicans on 
the Senate Finance Committee. 
There is urgent work that awaits her 
in Geneva. I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this nomination. It is priority 
business for today, given our trade 
challenges with Russia. 
I yield the floor.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER

tucky. 
f 
MOTION TO DISCHARGE—S.J. 
Res. 35 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, I move to 
discharge the Committee on Foreign 
Relations from further consideration of 
S.J. Res. 35, a joint resolution pro-
viding for congressional disapproval of 
the proposed foreign military sales to 
the Government of Egypt of certain de-
fense articles and services. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The mo-
tion is pending. 
Mr. PAUL. Mr. President, according 
to tradition, King Menes united the 
two lands of Europe about 5,000 years 
ago. Although Egypt appears today as 
a single state on the globe, American 
foreign policy still treats the country 
as if it were two completely different 
lands—one a critical ally of American 
aid and one a tyrannical nightmare un-
worthy of American security assist-
ance. 
A State Department human rights 
report details how General Abdelfattah 
Elsisi converted a country into a pris-
on. Among other horrors, Egyptian se-
curity forces engage in extrajudicial 
killings, torture, as well as harsh 
crackdowns on anyone who wishes to 
practice the right of freedom of speech. 
As a result of Egypt’s abysmal 
human rights record, the Biden admin-
istration recently blocked $130 million 
in annual security assistance. At first 
glance, that might sound like a rebuke 
to Egypt. Before applauding this sup-
posedly principled act in solidarity 
with the long-suffering Egyptian peo-
ple, keep in mind that in the same 
week, 
the 
State 
Department—the 
Biden State Department—approved a 
military sale of Super Hercules air-
craft, which are used to airdrop troops 
and military equipment, to the Elsisi 
regime for $2.2 billion. On the one 
hand, they blocked $130 million; on the 
other hand, they approved $2.2 billion. 
In what may be only described by 
definition as a slap on the wrist, the 
$130 million the State Department 
blocked is only one-tenth of the annual 
$1.3 billion the United States has given 
to Egypt every year since 1987. In fact, 
Egypt is one of the largest recipients of 
U.S. military aid. 
If the State Department strictly ad-
hered to Federal Leahy laws, it would 
insist that Egypt abandon its despotic 
ways before Egypt received any more 
security 
assistance. 
This 
law 
was 
named after our colleague Senator 
PATRICK LEAHY. These laws compel the 
United States to withhold security as-
sistance to countries that have com-
mitted 
gross 
violations 
of 
human 
rights. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
should 
strictly enforce the Leahy laws and 
deny Egypt the American dollars it 
craves until it becomes a place where 
human rights are honored and re-
spected. Instead, as punishment for 
their crimes, the ruling class of Egypt 
will somehow, some way, have to make 
due with only 90 percent of what they 
annually expect in largesse from the 
American taxpayer. Adjusting for in-
flation, the decades-long transfer of 
wealth 
from 
America 
to 
Egypt 
amounts to over $41 billion. Of the $41 
billion, some estimate that the pre-
vious President, Hosni Mubarak, and 
his family stole nearly half. The aid 
not stolen is used by Egypt to buy 
American weaponry. 
Since 2009, the United States has sold 
Egypt $3.2 billion in fighter aircraft,

$1.3 billion in tanks and armored vehi-
cles, $750 million in missiles, $36 mil-
lion in ammunition, and $328 million in 
military technology, as well as $240 
million in naval craft. As the United 
States prepares for yet another mili-
tary sale, perhaps we should review 
how one of our most reliable customers 
treats their own people. 
Human Rights Watch reports that 
‘‘Egypt’s security apparatus has arbi-
trarily arrested and prosecuted tens of 
thousands of persons’’ and that ‘‘tor-
ture crimes against detainees in Egypt 
are systematic, widespread, and likely 
constitute crimes against humanity.’’ 
One such victim of torture is known 
as Hamza. He was arrested at his home 
late one night for the crime of partici-
pating in a public demonstration. De-
spite tireless attempts to track him 
down, his family was unable to locate 
him for months. Later, it was revealed 
that the officers who captured him— 
the officers of the government of 
Elsisi—used electric shocks on his 
genitals, his head, and his tongue. But 
even that was not enough for Elsisi’s 
henchmen, who later suspended Hamza 
from his arms until his arms were dis-
located at the shoulder. 
As a physician, I have treated pa-
tients who have dislocated shoulders. 
It is a very painful injury. Imagine 
being hauled up by your own govern-
ment, suspended by your arms until 
your shoulders are dislocated, and then 
when they finally cut him down, they 
left him on the floor without medical 
treatment for 3 winter days without 
any blankets. 
Such torture would be virtually un-
bearable for any man. Hamza was not 
even yet a man; he was a 14-year-old 
boy at the time of his torture and ar-
rest. 
Hamza is not alone. The stories of 
other victims appear in Human Rights 
Watch’s 
43-page 
report 
detailing 
Egypt’s systemic torture of children, 
including a victim as young as 12 years 
old. 
In Egypt, journalism—journalism—is 
a dangerous profession. The Committee 
to Protect Journalists ranks Egypt the 
third worst jailer of journalists in the 
world behind only China and Myanmar. 
Take just a few examples. When a 26- 
year-old man died in police custody, a 
prominent Egyptian journalist, Islam 
el-Kahly, was arrested for covering and 
reporting on the detainee’s death. He is 
only one of many well-known journal-
ists to be imprisoned for the crime of 
keeping his people informed. 
Photojournalist Mahmoud Abu Zeid 
was arrested in 2013 for covering the 
violent break up of a sit-in protest—a 
peaceful sit-in protest—in Cairo. Zeid 
was released after 5 years in prison, but 
he is still not free. He is required to re-
port to the police station at 6 p.m. 
every night, where it is unknown 
whether the officer on duty will keep 
him or not, whether he will be impris-
oned every night of his life. 
Perhaps no activity is more dan-
gerous than running for Egypt’s Presi-
dency. General Elsisi was reelected—if 
you can call it an election—in 2018 with 
97 percent of the vote, whose Soviet- 
style results were made possible only 
after opposition candidates were effec-
tively eliminated. 
Two candidates, Sami Anan and 
Ahmed Konsowa, were imprisoned. A 
third candidate to run against Elsisi, 
Ahmed Shafik, was placed under house 
arrest. A senior staffer to one of the 
candidates, Hisham Geneina, was bru-
tally attacked by three men, resulting 
in serious damage to his left eye and 
orbital bones. When another candidate, 
Mohamed Anwar al-Sadat, withdrew 
from the race, he said: ‘‘It’s like com-
mitting suicide to run against someone 
like this.’’ 
President 
Biden 
pledged 
to 
put 
human rights at the ‘‘center of our for-
eign policy.’’ Torture of children, arbi-
trary arrests of dissidents and journal-
ists, sham elections, and the violent 
crushing 
of 
peaceful 
opposition—if 
these are not gross violations of human 
rights, nothing is. 
The United States cannot proudly 
proclaim human rights to be the center 
of our foreign policy while it arms a re-
gime that has a war against its own 
people. We should end military sales to 
Egypt’s criminal masters. Partially 
taking away some military aid while 
offering new sales that are 10 times 
what we withheld shows weakness in 
the face of repression. 
Our weapons are an incredibly impor-
tant part of America’s power, and we 
should not willy-nilly and without 
judgment give them to anybody and ev-
erybody around the world. They could 
be used as leverage for improving 
human rights. Instead, we just give 
them, and there is this vicious cycle of 
enriching those who produce the muni-
tions and no concern for human rights. 
Mere slaps on the wrists cannot hide 
the inescapable fact that the United 
States has handsomely rewarded Egypt 
as it degenerated into one of the most 
autocratic places on the globe. Amer-
ica should in no uncertain terms dem-
onstrate we will no longer strengthen a 
strongman. 
My resolution is to cancel military 
sales. It offers a choice—whether the 
United States will side with the Egyp-
tian people or with their oppressors. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from New Jersey. 
Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I 
rise in opposition to the motion to dis-
charge S.J. Res. 35. 
I am a little perplexed by the Parlia-
mentarian’s decision that this can 
move forward because there is a statu-
tory timeframe that says that the reso-
lution needs to be brought forth in 
order for it to have validity. 
My understanding of the Parliamen-
tarian’s decision is that even though— 
if there was passage of this resolu-
tion—it would not have validity be-
cause it is past the timeframe, it still 
can be brought. That seems to be a pur-
suit of the Senate’s time in a way that 
is an extraordinary amount of time on 
unlimited numbers of discharge resolu-
tions that potentially exist that, hav-
ing passed the statutory timeframe, 
can still be brought to the Senate floor 
even though whatever the vote is has 
no consequence. I fail to understand 
that. 
Since that is the ruling, let me just 
say that I appreciate that the Senator 
from Kentucky has concerns about 
human rights in Egypt, and I agree 
that we must absolutely continue to 
raise concerns in a way that will mean-
ingfully bring about positive change. I 
believe we should be doing more to 
prioritize a country’s human rights 
record in the context of our broader re-
lationship. 
In fact, last year, with several of my 
colleagues, I introduced S. 1473, the 
Safeguarding Human Rights in Arms 
Exports Act, or what we call the 
SAFEGUARD 
Act, 
to 
ensure 
that 
human rights issues full attention and 
arms exports decision making are con-
sidered. 
And I invite all of my colleagues 
from both sides of the aisle to support 
and cosponsor this important legisla-
tion. 
As I think everyone in this body 
knows, for years I have led the fight in 
the Senate against arms sales to coun-
tries that commit significant and re-
peated human rights abuses such as 
Saudi Arabia. 
Last Congress, the Senate approved 
23 resolutions of disapproval that I in-
troduced when the Trump administra-
tion sought to short circuit our rights 
to consider these sales according to 
law. 
Joint resolutions of disapproval are 
just one tool that we have, and we 
must make sensible distinctions about 
the types of systems we consider. In 
this particular debate, as I have argued 
before, a critical distinction is between 
arms that are inherently offensive and 
lethal and those that are not. Some are 
defensive; some are simply logistical. 
Today, we are considering a sale of 12 
cargo aircraft, which I believe squarely 
falls in the category of largely defen-
sive, nonlethal arms. This aircraft is 
used for transporting military and 
other cargo, including humanitarian 
supplies, as well as personnel in-coun-
try and internationally. Egypt has ear-
lier model C–130s since the 1980s, but 
its current fleet is aging and becoming 
more expensive to maintain. 
The United States and Egypt have a 
long and valuable relationship that 
goes beyond the security realm. Egypt 
is also an important security partner 
for other U.S. allies in the region. This, 
of course, does not mean that it is 
above reproach—it is not—or that the 
nature of that relationship is static. It 
is not. 
Indeed, I supported the Secretary of 
State’s determination made last month 
not to release $130 million in withheld 
foreign 
military 
financing 
because 
Egypt’s government has not made, in 
his view, sufficient progress in human 
rights, especially with regard to the

treatment of peaceful activists and the 
continued targeting of independent 
civil society organizations. 
I have used my prerogative as chair 
of the Foreign Relations Committee in 
the arms sales process before, and I 
will continue to do so in the future re-
garding systems that may consistently 
relate to these concerns. 
But in the end, our relationship with 
Egypt has to be one of maintaining a 
balance between the foreign policy and 
national 
security 
concerns 
of 
the 
United States and our partners. 
We should, however, continue to 
raise human rights concerns and press 
for meaningful reforms. We should con-
tinue encouraging the government to 
uphold its own commitments, but to 
this end, because these are purely, not 
only—they are logistical at best, I urge 
my colleagues to reject this motion to 
discharge. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Idaho. 
Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, tonight 
we are going to consider S.J. Res. 35 
and 36, and they are the resolutions of 
disapproval regarding arms sales to 
Egypt. Egypt has been a key partner of 
the United States since the 1979 Camp 
David Accords. 
It continues to play a critical role in 
Middle East peace. Egypt is a valuable 
counterterrorism partner and is essen-
tial to U.S. accession in the region and 
the U.S. success in the region. Look, 
for those who haven’t had the good for-
tune of being there, when the peace 
broke out between Israel and Egypt 
decades ago, Egypt played a key role in 
making that peace. And ever since 
then, the border between Egypt and 
Israel on the Sinai has been peaceful, 
notwithstanding the fact that they 
have incidents there all the time. 
But the Egyptians and the Israelis, 
brokered by the multilateral force that 
is there, keeps the peace, and it has 
been a great success story in the Mid-
dle East, one of the few that has had 
duration. And so in that regard, Egypt 
has been very valuable in helping keep 
the peace in the region. 
The Biden administration and Demo-
cratic Senate and House leaders agreed 
on these sales because they are in the 
interest of the United States and, in-
deed, of the world and particularly of 
the Middle East. These sales of cargo 
aircraft and radar support the United 
States-Egypt relationship and are in 
keeping with Egypt’s legitimate de-
fense requirements. 
Human rights are a critical element 
of our foreign relations. They always 
have been, and they always will be. 
And Egypt has problems it needs to fix. 
The United States has withheld aid 
and taken other measures to highlight 
our concerns to the Egyptian Govern-
ment. Indeed, Egypt is not a perfect 
partner, and we have almost no perfect 
partners when we are dealing with for-
eign countries on national security. 
Nonetheless, each of these is trans-
actional, and they have to be weighed 
and viewed individually. These sales 
that we are talking about here to 
Egypt present no direct human rights 
concerns and should be separated from 
that conversation. 
So, on substance, I oppose the resolu-
tion. 
In addition to that, there is a bigger 
issue here. The statutory 30-day con-
gressional notification period for these 
sales expired last Wednesday, March 2. 
The Parliamentarian has now ruled 
that the statutory 30-day period is ef-
fectively irrelevant and that any Sen-
ator can offer for privileged consider-
ation a resolution of disapproval for 
any arms sales notified over the course 
of an entire Congress. 
If this stands and continues, it would 
have a chilling effect on U.S. alliances 
and partnerships worldwide, and it 
could set a new procedure as far as dil-
atory tactics are concerned on the Sen-
ate floor. 
The 1987 precedent that the Parlia-
mentarian cites as justification is from 
a time when there was a bipartisan 
agreement to extend the timeline for 
simple procedural reasons. This is not 
the case now. And I disagree with the 
Parliamentarian’s 
interpretation 
thereof. 
It always amazes me around here 
that we can get a Parliamentarian rul-
ing that is in direct—I mean direct 
contradiction of a statute, which is 
what we have here. 
I ask—and I would urge—Senate lead-
ership to work to ensure the intent of 
the statutory 30-day notification pe-
riod is restored. Perhaps we should re-
pass the statute and say we really, 
really mean it. Nonetheless, that is 
where we are, and this really needs to 
be corrected.

Senate will resume legislative session. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT—EXECUTIVE 
CALENDAR 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, as if in 
executive session, I ask that the mo-
tion to reconsider with respect to the 
Pagan nomination be considered made 
and laid upon the table and the Presi-
dent be immediately notified of the 
Senate’s action. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
ENERGY 
Mr. MURPHY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor this evening to offer a few 
remarks about claims that have been 
made on this floor over the course of 
the last few days regarding the path 
forward to American energy independ-
ence. 
The 
oil 
industry—reaping 
record 
profits in the billions of dollars—is 
taking advantage, quite artfully, of the 
crisis in Ukraine to make arguments to 
the U.S. Congress and this administra-
tion that they should be given new lib-
erties to drill on lands in the United 
States to be able to reap even greater 
profits. 
And the claim that the oil industry 
makes that is often parroted by friends 
inside this body is that the path to 
American energy independence runs 
through drilling for more oil in the 
United States of America. That is not 
true. That is an oil industry talking 
point. That is a means by which the in-
dustry can get Congress and the admin-
istration to provide them with new op-
portunities for more profit. 
But the facts belie the argument that 
America could achieve energy inde-
pendence solely through drilling for 
more oil and exploring for more gas in 
the United States. Why do we know 
this? Well, we know this, primarily, be-
cause the oil industry doesn’t drill in 
the United States to benefit our na-
tional security. They drill in the 
United States to make money. And the 
reality is, when the price of a barrel of 
oil is too low compared to the cost of 
pulling it out of the ground in the 
United States, the oil companies don’t 
drill. Right now, for instance, the oil 
industry has thousands of leases to 
drill on public lands that they are not 
utilizing. 
As you would hear it on the floor of 
the Senate, the failure to be energy 
independent is Joe Biden’s fault be-
cause he is not providing for any new 
leases on public lands. Well, you do not 
need any new leases on public lands be-
cause there are thousands of leases 
that the oil industry already has to 
drill that they just are not using. 
There is nothing in the ground. There 
is no oil coming up. And the reason for 
that is, well, the economy was in sham-
bles, so there wasn’t demand; the price 
of oil was down so that the companies 
didn’t see a big enough profit; there is 
a general workforce shortage right now 
in the industry. But none of those rea-
sons are Joe Biden. Those are market- 
based reasons why the oil industry has 
not been drilling on land they already 
own. 
The second reason why there is not a 
path to energy independence through 
drilling alone is because the oil that we 
drill in the United States, it doesn’t 
stay in the United States. Some of it 
does, but much of it gets exported. In 
2020, we were drilling about 18 million 
barrels a day in the United States. 
About half of that was shipped over-
seas. Only half of that stayed in the 
United States. I wanted to make sure 
that wasn’t something we needed to 
pay closer attention to. 
The oil that we drill in the United 
States doesn’t stay here. It goes to the 
highest bidder. In fact, often, the oil we 
drill in the United States is going to 
China. For as hard as my friends on the 
other side of the aisle say we should be 
on China, the reality is, during some 
months of the last several years, Amer-
ica was sending record amounts of oil 
from U.S. oil production facilities to 
the Chinese Government. 
It just isn’t true that there is a path 
to American energy security simply by 
drilling for more oil in the United 
States. That oil only comes out of the 
ground when the price is high enough. 
The oil industry doesn’t drill to be pa-
triotic. They drill to make money. And 
there is never a guarantee that that oil 
or that gas stays in the United States; 
much of it is sent overseas. 
As I mentioned, there is also no argu-
ment to be made credibly that Joe 
Biden is waging some war on American 
energy independence. 
The two biggest changes that are 
often cited that the President made: 
One is, as I referenced, this pause on 
new leases on public lands. That just 
has very little impact because, first of 
all, very little of the oil that the indus-
try drills is on public lands. Only 10 
percent of the oil the industry drills is 
on public lands. Ninety percent of it is 
on privately held lands, so a pause on 
10 percent of the leases just doesn’t 
have a macro effect on oil drilling. 
Second, any leases that the adminis-
tration would give out right now, they 
don’t end up in drilling occurring for 
years. So whether or not we are paus-
ing or not pausing leases on 10 percent 
of the opportunities to drill in the 
United States, that has an impact 
years from now, not today. 
The argument is, ‘‘Well, the Presi-
dent stopped the Keystone Pipeline 
from going into effect.’’ Same thing. 
The Keystone Pipeline was years out; 
and, second, most of the Keystone 
Pipeline oil wasn’t staying in the 
United States. Most of that oil was 
going to be shipped overseas. 
There is a reason why the Keystone 
Pipeline was ending up near the termi-
nals in the Gulf that ended up sending 
oil to places other than the United 
States. Once again, the Keystone Pipe-
line was not a guarantee for American 
energy independence; that was a guar-
antee that the majority of that oil was 
going to end up in some other country. 
And so if you are serious about en-
ergy independence, then you are not se-
rious if you are talking about getting 
there through drilling. This is not a se-
rious solution, because the facts tell 
you that the drilling only happens 
when the oil industry makes enough 
money and that the lion’s share, at 
least half of that oil and gas, can end 
up going overseas, not to American 
consumers. 
Do you know how you do make this 
country energy independent? Investing 
in renewables, because we don’t ship 
wind power overseas. We don’t ship 
solar energy overseas. When a wind 
turbine is running in Iowa or a solar 
panel is generating energy in Cali-
fornia, that energy goes straight onto 
the American grid. That energy stays 
right here in the United States. 
Now, it also has a tremendous benefit 
of being clean energy, of not contrib-
uting to the warming of the planet. 
That alone is a good enough reason to 
prioritize clean energy over fossil fuel 
energy, but renewable energy also has 
the benefit of being truly domestic en-
ergy; truly secure, American-only en-
ergy, as opposed to fossil fuels, which 
only get turned on when the price is 
high enough and often end up leaving 
the United States to other countries. 
Those are the facts. The oil industry 
delights when crises like this occur and 
the prices go up at the pump, and 
friends of theirs come down and claim 
that the only path to energy independ-
ence is through more drilling. But the 
problem is it just isn’t true. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
our Nation’s energy policy and the cri-
sis that we find ourselves in as the cost 
of energy continues to go up and up 
and up. 
Right now, gas prices are nearly dou-
ble what they were the day that Joe 
Biden became President of the United 
States. 
So you ask: Why is this happening? 
That is what consumers, that is what

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1097 
March 10, 2022 
people in my home State of Wyoming 
are asking about. What has happened? 
How is it that it has gone up so much? 
Sure, there is the war in Ukraine, but 
the prices have been going up day by 
day by day after Joe Biden became 
President, and the reason, I tell people 
at home, is because Joe Biden has de-
clared war on American energy—the 
policies of this administration, the 
policies of the Democrats in this body 
and across the way in the House. 
On day No. 1, Joe Biden shut down 
the Keystone XL Pipeline; he shut 
down oil and gas leases on Federal 
lands; and he shut down the explo-
ration for energy in the Arctic. 
My colleague the senior Senator from 
Alaska, who previously had chaired the 
Energy Committee in the Senate, has 
said that we are actually, in the United 
States, using more energy from Russia, 
more oil from Russia than we are from 
Alaska, her home State, a State in the 
United States. 
Now we see the President’s ap-
pointees making it almost impossible 
to build gas pipelines. So even if you 
were able to explore and discover en-
ergy—oil, gas—you can’t get it to mar-
ket because they are blocking pipelines 
all across the country. 
And the FERC—the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission—just a week 
and a half ago revised its guidelines to 
make it even tougher. 
They talk about oil and gas leases. 
Once you get a lease—you pay for a 
lease to explore for energy—you have 
to come to the government for permis-
sion to drill for it. You actually have 
to pay money to apply for permission 
to drill. It is actually called an Appli-
cation for Permit to Drill. And the 
Biden administration last month said, 
‘‘We are not going to give you any 
more of those,’’ to anybody who wants 
to explore for energy on public lands. 
And, in fact, there are about 4,600 of 
those stuck in limbo right now. 
In my home State of Wyoming and 
across the country, people are asking: 
How can a President put such a radical 
and self-destructive agenda which we 
have to live under? 
And what I tell them and what they 
understand is that the Biden adminis-
tration is completely controlled by the 
climate elitists, the climate alarmists 
who dictate the policies of the Demo-
cratic Party in this country. 
So just look at Joe Biden’s climate 
czar. Now, that is kind of a nickname 
for the position, but the reality of the 
title is the U.S. Special Presidential 
Envoy for Climate. It is John Kerry. So 
this is a very high position in this ad-
ministration. 
He didn’t come to the Senate for con-
firmation. Oh, no. They wouldn’t risk 
putting something like that up here be-
cause then John Kerry would have to 
answer questions. 
But John Kerry, no question about it, 
does speak for the administration. Joe 
Biden appointed him. John Kerry and 
Joe Biden served together in the Sen-
ate, in this body. I served with both of 
them on the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee. John Kerry was a previous Sec-
retary of State of the United States at 
the time that Joe Biden was Vice 
President of the United States. 
So the position of John Kerry is also 
the position of this administration, 
otherwise, why would he be the Special 
Presidential Envoy for Climate? When 
John Kerry speaks, it is Joe Biden 
whom he speaks for. 
Well, John Kerry and this adminis-
tration have a delusional obsession, 
and their delusional obsession is with 
climate. John Kerry and this adminis-
tration are so obsessed with our cli-
mate that they believe it is more im-
portant than our energy security and 
than our national security. 
Now, there are countless examples. 
And I just want to go through a couple 
of them that have occurred just within 
the last 3 weeks, just within the time 
that Vladimir Putin’s soldiers have en-
circled Ukraine and now have attacked 
Ukraine, continuing to kill innocent 
civilians. 
The night before Vladimir Putin in-
vaded Ukraine, with the troops at the 
ready, John Kerry actually told the 
BBC in an interview that he was wor-
ried about the carbon emissions that 
would result from the war—the carbon 
emissions, not the death, not the de-
struction, not the suffering; no, the 
carbon emissions. 
He also said—I mean, it is aston-
ishing. People listened, and they said: 
This can’t be the position of the admin-
istration of the President of the United 
States. But yet it is the position of 
John Kerry, the President’s Special 
Envoy, that war would be a distrac-
tion, would distract from the climate 
agenda. 
John Kerry went on to say this. He 
said: 
I hope President Putin will help us to stay 
on track with respect to what we need to do 
for the climate. 
Let me repeat. John Kerry, Special 
Envoy, speaking for the President of 
the United States: 
I hope President Putin will help us stay on 
track with respect to what we need to do for 
the climate. 
John Kerry believes, by his state-
ments and others that I will get to, 
that what is happening with the war in 
Europe is a distraction from the real 
issue of the day, the key issue—climate 
change. 
People are being murdered in the 
streets, Vladimir Putin is conducting 
nuclear drills, and the President’s key 
spokesman on issues affecting energy 
in this country is hoping that Presi-
dent Putin will help us stay on track, 
and what is happening there is a dis-
traction. 
This is absurd. John Kerry thinks 
that Vladimir Putin cares about the 
climate? It is impossible. Putin just 
yesterday bombed a maternity ward. 
Putin’s forces have killed dozens of 
children. Yet John Kerry is desperately 
waiting by the phone, clinging to the 
hope of a phone call from Vladimir 
Putin. 
I hope John Kerry isn’t holding his 
breath waiting for Putin to address the 
issue of climate. 
Now, in the very same interview, 
John Kerry was asked about the possi-
bility 
that 
Russia 
would 
invade 
Ukraine. 
John Kerry’s answer is this. The 
former Secretary of State, former 
chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, said: ‘‘I thought we lived 
in a world that said no to that kind of 
[thing].’’ What kind of a world is John 
Kerry living in? Sounds like a nice 
place. It is not the real world—not the 
world we live in, not the world that is 
right now wreaking havoc on the peo-
ple of Ukraine. 
The fact that John Kerry, the Presi-
dent’s spokesman on issues of climate, 
said this out loud in public just shows 
that John Kerry and this administra-
tion—in terms of their position on en-
ergy and energy security and national 
security, it must put them in the posi-
tion of being the most naive people on 
the face of the Earth. John Kerry fly-
ing around the world in his private jet, 
representing the administration, wor-
rying about the carbon emissions of a 
war, whereas we know as of now that 
thousands of innocent people already 
have or will lose their lives. 
Then on Monday, just 3 days ago, I 
believe John Kerry made it worse. At 
that point, the tanks were in the 
streets, Russia was on the attack, peo-
ple were dying, and millions of people 
have left the country of Ukraine, seek-
ing asylum, seeking help, seeking re-
lief, going across the border, seeking 
humanitarian care, and John Kerry, in 
a heartless statement, said the 2 mil-
lion Ukrainian refugees were nothing— 
John Kerry—nothing in comparison to 
the refugees who will flee a warmer cli-
mate someday. Someday. Two million 
refugees—nothing compared to what 
may happen someday with climate 
change. 
This is the world’s largest refugee 
crisis in the last 70 years, since World 
War II. There are 2 million Ukrainians 
now displaced, trying to get out of the 
country of Ukraine, some losing their 
lives—they think they are going on 
safe corridors—being killed by Putin as 
he bombs them as they think they have 
safe passage. 
John Kerry doesn’t seem to be im-
pressed, which, to me, means Joe Biden 
is not impressed; the administration is 
not impressed because Joe Biden has 
allowed John Kerry to continue to this 
very day, to this very moment, to 
speak for this administration as the 
climate envoy. 
John Kerry should be fired. If he is 
not, he continues to speak for the 
President of the United States because 
John Kerry—which means this admin-
istration is more concerned about a hy-
pothetical event in the future than 
what is happening on the face of the 
Earth right now. 
This is an obsession. This is delu-
sional. And the obsession explains a 
lot. It explains why this White House

always puts environmental fantasies 
ahead of American security and Amer-
ican energy. That is what we are see-
ing. This administration puts climate 
ahead of jobs. It puts climate ahead of 
bringing prices down. It puts climate 
ahead of working families. The admin-
istration puts climate ahead of our al-
lies. We have sky-high gas prices, the 
highest of all time. You know, we see 
inflation is the highest in 40 years. We 
got the new bad inflation numbers 
again today, which are hurting our 
families. We can’t keep up. Wages can’t 
keep up. A 40-year high inflation but 
the worst of all time highest gas prices 
ever. We have the worst prices in Eu-
rope in decades and decades and dec-
ades. And the Biden administration 
won’t even consider—won’t even con-
sider—producing more American en-
ergy. 
Earlier 
today—today—Reuters 
re-
ported the White House has decided not 
to boost exports of liquefied natural 
gas to Europe. They are pleading for it. 
They want it. We have it. We have it in 
abundance. Now, the administration 
won’t let us build the pipelines to move 
it, won’t let us explore for it, but we 
have plenty of it here in the United 
States. They are desperate, and they 
are trying to break the ties they have 
to Russia. 
The report from Reuters today says: 
‘‘The White House was weighing the 
announcement of . . . ways to boost 
LNG exports to Europe . . . How-
ever’’—however; wait a minute, not 
going to happen—‘‘the interagency re-
view has been shelved . . . after some 
in the White House argued’’—some in 
the White House argued; not a supply 
and demand issue—and I see the junior 
Senator from Maine here, who talks 
about a supply and demand issue with 
regard to LNG. Oh, no. Those in the 
White House argued that ‘‘it would 
counter the administration’s efforts.’’ 
Letting our friends and colleagues in 
Europe who need our LNG, of which we 
have an abundance—oh, no. ‘‘[I]t would 
counter the administration’s efforts to 
wean the U.S. off fossil fuels.’’ 
Once again, this White House, with 
John Kerry the spokesman and it looks 
like Joe Biden the lapdog—whatever 
John Kerry says, we are going to do— 
has put climate before our national se-
curity and before our energy security. 
It is time for the administration to 
get its priorities straight, and it is 
time to remove John Kerry from this 
position. It is time for Joe Biden to 
wake up and to speak up. The climate 
elitists have done tremendous damage 
to our Nation and are continuing to do 
damage to our allies. For ourselves and 
for our allies, it is time to produce 
more American energy. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I hope the 
Senator from Wyoming will stay so we 
might have a discussion. 
Why has the price of gasoline gone 
up? Why did it start going up about the 
same time that Joe Biden became 
President? Was it because of the 
cancelation of the Keystone Pipeline? 
No. Most of the oil going through the 
Keystone Pipeline was scheduled to be 
exported, so I don’t think that was it. 
Was it a pause in leases that wouldn’t 
have produced oil for 3 or 4 years? No. 
There are something like 8,000 leases 
that are currently in place that aren’t 
being drilled upon, so I don’t think 
that did it. 
Do you know what caused gas prices 
to go up? The extraordinary recovery 
that the economy went through start-
ing in early 2021, after Joe Biden be-
came President—one of the quickest 
recoveries in our history from a reces-
sion. 
If you look back to the recession of 
2007 and 2008, you see a slow—I call it 
a lazy U. You see a downward of the re-
cession, and then jobs and the economy 
came back very slowly over 5, 6, 7 
years. The recession recovery from 
2021, from the pandemic recession, is a 
V, and we recovered virtually all of the 
jobs that were lost during the pan-
demic in the last 14 months. GDP has 
grown as fast as it has in our history. 
The economy came back enormously 
rapidly. 
Oil was down in 2019 and 2020 because 
of the pandemic. Demand collapsed— 
this is economics 101—demand col-
lapsed, the price of oil collapsed, and 
then the recovery came, and the de-
mand increased, but the production 
didn’t increase. 
Let’s talk a little bit about oil in the 
United States. In 2021, half of the oil 
produced in the United States was ex-
ported. Did that do anything for our 
consumers? Did that do anything for 
the people who were paying higher and 
higher rates for gas? 
The White House doesn’t set gas 
prices. Presidents are always blamed 
for gas prices. I have never heard one 
given credit when gas prices are low. 
But the truth is, the price of gas de-
pends upon the price of oil, and the 
price of oil depends on the world mar-
ket, and the price of oil in the world 
market depends upon supply and de-
mand. 
I am old enough to remember the 
Arab oil embargo in the seventies. Why 
did prices go up so much? Because the 
OPEC closed down the source, and sup-
ply dropped, and the price went up. 
That is economics. 
So what happened during 2021? The 
price went way up. The oil companies 
made the highest profits they have 
made in 8 years. What did they do with 
that money? Demand is resurging. 
There is a need for more oil. Prices 
were going up. What did they do? They 
put $100 billion into buybacks from 
their stockholders, and they put that 
much—the combination was $100 bil-
lion in buybacks and dividends. 
They had a choice. Did they put the 
money into production, which would 
have reduced the price because we 
would have higher supply? No. They 
made a deliberate choice to give the 
money to their stockholders to bump 
up their stock price, which I suspect 
may have had a positive effect on the 
executive salaries, but they didn’t in-
crease production. 
That is why we are in this problem 
that we are in now with high gas 
prices. Of course, the war in Ukraine 
has exacerbated that because we are 
cutting off purchases from Russia, 
which is one of the highest producers of 
oil in the world. 
So if the idea is—you know, I keep 
hearing my friends on the other side 
trying to blame Joe Biden. If you want 
to blame him for anything, blame him 
for the quickest recovery from a reces-
sion in recorded history. And it was the 
recovery and the increase in demand 
that wasn’t met by an increase in pro-
duction that caused these high prices. 
I read a quote this morning in the 
Energy and Natural Resources Com-
mittee. There was an executive who 
said: We made a promise to our share-
holders that we were going to be dis-
ciplined and we were going to return 
the money to them. 
He said: I guess the choice came 
down to keeping our promise to our 
shareholders or being patriotic. 
Well, we know what choice they 
made. 
So all this talk about the Biden ad-
ministration’s war on oil and it is what 
is causing what is going on at the 
pump—no. What is causing what is 
going on at the pump is low supply and 
high demand. That is what happened in 
1972, that is what is happening now, 
and that is what happens whenever you 
get supply and demand out of balance. 
As far as exporting LNG to Europe, I 
am all for trying to help our European 
allies. I am all for it. But we have to do 
it with open eyes. The more we export 
LNG, the higher the price is going to 
be here in the United States. Seven or 
eight years ago, the Australians went 
big into exporting LNG, and their do-
mestic natural gas price doubled, and 
that is about what has happened here 
in this country. Five years ago, we ex-
ported zero LNG production. Now, it is 
about 15 percent, but with the plants 
that have been approved, it is going to 
go up to 25, 30, or 35 percent. That is 
going to impact prices here. That is 
going to be great for producers, but it 
is going to kill the competitive advan-
tage that low gas prices gave this coun-
try. If it is $13 in China and it is $3 
here, where do you think it is going to 
go? 
That is what is going on here. This is 
nothing but economics. We need to un-
derstand that what has happened is the 
oil industry made a conscious decision 
last year—and when I say ‘‘conscious 
decision,’’ I mean conscious. They had 
a choice: Do we invest in production 
and increase supply or do we give 
money to our shareholders in the form 
of dividends and stock buybacks? They 
chose the latter, and we are reaping 
the fruits of that. 
So I am tired of hearing that some-
how a pause in leases on Federal land

March 10, 2022 
that wouldn’t have produced any oil for 
3 or 4 years is somehow the cause of 
the high prices at the pump. That is 
nonsense. The cause of the high prices 
at the pump is a lack of supply, and 
last year—talk about energy independ-
ence—we exported half the oil that was 
produced in this country. 
We had a vote here 4 or 5 years ago, 
and we were told: If you allow—exports 
of oil were illegal until 4 or 5 years ago. 
We voted to allow it because we were 
told: Well, this won’t really affect us 
because we have an excess of supply. It 
won’t affect prices here in this coun-
try. 
Well, that hasn’t proven to be the 
case. 
So what I would like to see is for all 
of us to work together, to think 
about—I am aware of policies involving 
pipelines and those kinds of things, and 
I believe that we have to make fuel 
available and energy available to all of 
our people. But let’s be realistic about 
what is going on and not turn it into a 
partisan issue. 
The only partisan issue here is that 
we have had a startling and extraor-
dinary and, frankly, positive recovery 
of our economy. But we didn’t have a 
recovery of the production of oil, which 
leads to the production of gasoline, 
which means a shortage, which means 
higher prices. 
So I am delighted to engage in this 
debate, but I think we really ought to 
be trying to talk about the facts and 
talk about what is really going on here 
and what is really causing this prob-
lem. 
I always want to learn more, and I 
learn from my colleagues. And I no-
ticed that my colleague who just made 
the speech left, and he didn’t seem to 
want to engage on this, which I think 
is unfortunate. I hope that perhaps 
here in the Senate we could actually 
have a debate and talk about what the 
issues are and what the reality is and 
quit just casting everything in a par-
tisan way. 
It has gotten to the point that, if Joe 
Biden walked out of the White House 
and walked across the Potomac River, 
the other side would say: The President 
can’t swim. 
Come on. Let’s just talk about re-
ality and not make everything about 
what is good for the administration or 
bad for the administration. Let’s talk 
about what is really happening, and 
what is really happening right now is 
we have got solid demand in this coun-
try. The economy has come back, but 
we don’t have enough production to 
meet that demand. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I did 
listen with great interest to every word 
of my colleague from Maine. We spend 
time together on the Energy Com-
mittee. He has lots of very good ideas, 
and we discuss things constructively. 
When we talk about supply and de-
mand, I just find it very interesting 
that for something like natural gas, of 
which we have an abundance in Wyo-
ming—and when I was in the Wyoming 
State Senate, natural gas prices were 
over $16. With the renaissance of Amer-
ican natural gas energy and the pro-
duction of something called fracking, 
prices dropped dramatically to the 
kind of numbers that the Senator from 
Maine mentioned earlier—to about $3. 
It went down, way down. 
That doesn’t help the people in Mas-
sachusetts, where the price is $18, be-
cause they can’t get permission to have 
pipelines to deliver the affordable gas 
that we produce here. I mean, it is fas-
cinating to take a look at Pennsyl-
vania, which is half the price than in 
Massachusetts; and they are not too far 
apart. I just went out here, as the Sen-
ator was speaking, just to take a look 
and see what the differentials were in 
the prices. The price of natural gas is 
twice as high in Massachusetts as in 
Pennsylvania when they are less than 
200 miles or 300 miles apart. 
It has nothing to do with the avail-
ability of gas in the ground; it has to 
do with the delivery to the end user. 
That is the result of political decisions 
being made on the ground, in States, to 
prevent the infrastructure to deliver 
the material, to deliver the natural 
gas, that those people need. 
It was even an issue on the ballot in 
my colleague’s home State of Maine to 
move energy from Canada down to 
Massachusetts, and it was blocked by 
the voters in Maine, which is their 
right to do. They have a right to make 
those decisions as to what they want to 
vote for or against. And that was on 
the transmission of even renewable en-
ergy. Politics and decisions by either 
the administration or a State or voters 
make those decisions. So there is an 
abundance of natural gas, and there is 
a limitation on how you can get it to 
people because of political decisions. 
I heard my colleague mention the 
number of leases that are out there. 
There are about 9,000 leases the admin-
istration continues to talk about, say-
ing there are 9,000 leases of which no-
body is exploring or that drilling 
hasn’t been done. 
Well, that is just the first step of get-
ting a lease. It is like leasing an apart-
ment: You pay the rent, but you need a 
key to get into the building. I mean, 
you pay the rent, and it is your apart-
ment, but you can’t actually get in 
until they give you the key. That is 
the same thing that happens here. You 
need to apply for permission to drill, 
and we know that the administration 
has said: We are not going to give any 
of those. There is no permission. Sorry. 
I know you paid for the lease, but we 
are not giving anybody a key. And they 
did that to about 4,600 recent leases. 
Normally, some of those decisions 
are made at a local level but not in the 
Biden administration. Oh, no. Some as-
sistant secretary said: Every one of 
them has to come to me. 
I can get the documentation for the 
Presiding Officer or for my colleague 
and friend, the Senator from Maine. 
This is a very heavyhanded adminis-
tration when it comes to exploring for 
American energy, and they continue 
that way. 
The President, when he was in Glas-
gow for the climate conference, I think 
surprised many of us when he asked 
OPEC+—‘‘plus’’ 
being 
Russia—to 
produce and sell more energy to the 
United States. Over the last year, we 
have averaged about 670,000 barrels a 
day of oil coming in from Russia, 
which is more than we get from Alas-
ka. The Keystone Pipeline, which the 
President killed on his first day in of-
fice, would have brought in over 800,000 
barrels a day. 
It is not that the President has been 
shy about the fact that he has done all 
of these things; he has taken great 
credit. I mean, look at the Presidential 
debates when President Biden—then 
Candidate Biden—said, if he got elect-
ed, there would be no oil and gas explo-
ration on public lands—no leasing, no 
use. That is why they have shut down 
all of these applications for the per-
mits to drill. That is why the adminis-
tration has said: You are not taking it 
out of the ground. 
This is a Presidential promise. 
As of today, we continue to produce a 
lot less oil in the United States than 
we did at the height of our economic 
boom prior to the pandemic. We have 
about 1,400,000 barrels a day less in U.S. 
production today than we had during 
the height of the economy before the 
pandemic. So we have a lot of catching 
up to do. 
When the administration says you 
can’t bring it in from Canada because 
you are not going to have Keystone and 
then pounds its chest in pride, that is a 
political statement. When the nominee 
for the Secretary of the Interior says 
to leave it all in the ground—all of it— 
that is a political statement. When a 
local community says, ‘‘No pipelines in 
here. We don’t care if the people in our 
communities have to pay twice what 
they are paying in our neighboring 
State,’’ that is a political statement. It 
is all based on climate because we have 
John Kerry and his words to prove it, 
as well as those of the President of the 
United States. 
So I continue to enjoy having discus-
sions with my colleague from Maine, 
and we will continue that on the En-
ergy Committee, where he is a very 
productive member. There are areas we 
work together on and areas in which 
we disagree. People are entitled to 
their opinions. 
These are the facts as to what is hap-
pening with American energy today 
and as of the needs of the Nation. As 
we have recovered and continue to re-
cover from the pandemic, we are still 
very far behind in American energy 
needs, and it is the political activities 
of this administration that have lim-
ited our ability to return to our full, 
productive capacity. 
I yield the floor.

jority whip.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1100 
March 10, 2022 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would 
like to call the attention of my friend 
from Wyoming to a column today by 
Dana Milbank in The Washington Post. 
I think it is really worth reading in 
light of some of the things that have 
been said on the floor: 
Canceling the Keystone XL pipeline caused 
gas prices to rise? 
That has been said. Well, it is wrong. 
It was only 10 percent [finished] when 
Biden canceled it, and its owners didn’t ex-
pect to open it until 2023 at the earliest. 
It had no measurable impact—maybe 
no impact—on current oil prices. 
[The assertion that] Biden halted new 
drilling on Federal lands? Wrong. After a 
temporary halt in new leases, Biden has out-
paced Trump in new drilling permits for pub-
lic lands. 
The Post has reported that publicly. 
As for Biden’s ‘‘shutdown of American en-
ergy,’’ U.S. production has increased under 
Biden from 9.7 million barrels a day to 11.6 
million barrels. The number of oil rigs oper-
ating was at 172 in July 2020, E&E News re-
ports. Now, 519 are in operation. U.S. produc-
tion is forecast to set a record next year. 
What’s holding back oil production— 
according to Mr. Milbank— 
isn’t government policy. U.S. producers still 
have 4,400 wells already approved and drilled 
that are not yet producing. They aren’t drill-
ing more because of a shortage of workers 
and equipment and, particularly, investors’ 
greed— 
which, I think, the Senator from 
Maine was alluding to. 
So some of the many things that 
have been said on the floor here as gos-
pel have turned out to be somewhat 
short of factual. 
I would concede that I listened to the 
Senator’s statement earlier that this is 
a supply and demand issue at its heart. 
I do think there is some gouging going 
on. Maybe I am wrong. The fact of the 
matter is we are coming out of a reces-
sion—or at least out of a downturn in 
the 
economy—from 
COVID–19, 
and 
there is an exceeding demand and not 
much supply. The net result is infla-
tionary, and prices have gone up at the 
pump. In terms of this administration’s 
being at war with the production of oil 
in America, I don’t think that case can 
be made. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Maine. 
Mr. KING. Mr. President, I certainly 
agree with the comments of the major-
ity whip. 
My friend from Wyoming will be sur-
prised that I think we have some agree-
ment on the issue of infrastructure. 
When I was the Governor of Maine, 
we—we, the pipeline company but 
under the auspices of the environ-
mental regulatory policies in Maine— 
constructed a brand new pipeline for 
natural gas from Nova Scotia through 
New Brunswick and through Maine 
into Massachusetts. I believe one of the 
problems we have is a lack of gas pipe-
line infrastructure, and that causes 
higher prices than there should be in 
New England. 
I think the Senator and I agree on 
that. Where we disagree is on the ex-
tent to which any policies of this ad-
ministration have affected the price. 
As the Senator just pointed out, the 
Keystone Pipeline wasn’t expected to 
deliver for another year or 2, and the 
express purpose of the Keystone Pipe-
line was to take oil from Canada to the 
Gulf Coast for export. It wasn’t de-
signed to service production in the 
United States. 
As I say, the problem right now is 
that the high price of gasoline is the 
result of the rapidity of the economic 
recovery, which is a good thing. What 
is not a good thing is that the oil com-
panies made a choice last year to in-
vest in their shareholders and their 
stock prices rather than in producing 
oil. 
I understand that to some extent be-
cause they took such a beating during 
the pandemic. It dropped so fast that 
oil was actually trading in negative 
territory for a period of time. Yet, once 
it became clear that the economic re-
covery was on track and that demand 
was solid and likely to remain so, that 
is when, I believe, those decisions 
about buybacks and stock dividends 
should have been reexamined in light 
of the need—the obvious need—for ad-
ditional resources in this country. 
So I appreciate this discussion. It is a 
rare day when actual debate breaks out 
on the Senate floor. I am delighted to 
have been able to have participated in 
it, but I think we ought to continue to 
remember that the issue here is supply 
and demand. Politics can affect these 
things on the margins, but the deci-
sions of the producers are what really 
determine whether supply will match 
demand. If it doesn’t, prices are going 
to go up, and the question then is, 
What do you do with the profits? That 
is the decision that was made last year. 
I deeply hope that the industry is re-
examining that decision, particularly 
in light of current prices and the situa-
tion in Ukraine, and will ramp up pro-
duction in a way that will bring prices 
down and allow us to enjoy the full 
fruits of the recovery that we have 
seen, not undermined by inflation, 
which has been led by the cost of fuel. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). The Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know 
Senators are waiting on movements on 
both sides, but I just want to reiterate 
what I said earlier this afternoon. We 
have before us a message from the 
House—the omnibus. I would point out 
that both Republicans and Democrats 
have had an enormous amount of input 
into this for over the past several 
months. I know that because the Ap-
propriations 
Committee 
staff 
has 
worked so hard on it—again, both sides 
of the aisle. 
Earlier today, I put into the RECORD 
the names of members of my staff who 
have worked on this. I would just men-
tion to other Senators, there are many 
times I would be on phone calls with 
them and conference calls at 10 and 11 
at night. I can then go to bed. They 
were still there at 2 or 3 o’clock in the 
morning. I know that a number of 
them have given up time with their 
families over the weekend. I would be 
checking in with them or come down 
and meet with them, but I could go 
home. They kept on working. I think 
we have to understand, if it were not 
for such dedicated staff members, this 
Senate could not exist. 
We have a complex package before 
us, but in a way, what we have here is 
a simple matter. Everybody has had 
input into it. As chairman of the Sen-
ate Appropriations Committee, I tried 
to make it open to everybody. The vice 
chairman, Senator SHELBY, a close 
friend of mine, has done the same on 
his side. People have been heard. 
Now comes the time when we have to 
vote. The government runs out of 
money at midnight tomorrow. Look 
what faces our country. We, as the 
leading democracy in the world, are 
trying to stand up for Ukraine. 
I applaud President Biden. He and I 
sometimes joke that when I came here, 
I was accused because I was 34 years 
old—the Presiding Officer can under-
stand this feeling—I was accused by 
very senior Senators of being too 
young to be in the U.S. Senate. Fortu-
nately, I was not the youngest. The 
youngest was Senator Joseph Biden of 
Delaware. We formed a bond over that. 
We worked together on so many things. 
I watched him in the Foreign Relations 
Committee; I watched him in the Judi-
ciary; and I watched him as Vice Presi-
dent and now as President. 
I have seen him tirelessly, quietly, a 
lot of it not in the full light of the 
press but just doing what he has to do, 
calling leaders who respect him around 
the world, forming a coalition in 
Ukraine, to say: Here is how we will 
stand up against Russia. 
I know so many of the Russian people 
are good people but being led by a per-
son who has demonstrated activities 
which make him a war criminal. What 
has happened when mothers, fathers, 
and their children are machine-gunned 
to death on the streets of the city they 
grew up in by Russian invaders? This is 
a war crime when Vladimir Putin sends 
them there. 
In this omnibus, we have support for 
the Ukrainian people. Let’s stand up. 
Let’s deliver this support. Let’s do 
what we should do. Let the Senate be 
the conscience of the Nation. Let’s not 
have a dozen or more amendments that 
are designed more for ‘‘Here is how I 
can get 30 seconds on the news’’ or in a 
Twitter account or somewhere. Let’s 
do what is best for this country. Let’s 
do what is best for the people in 
Ukraine. 
Look at the lies—look at the lies 
that have come out of Russia. I don’t 
say it lightly after 48 years here to call 
the leader of a country a war criminal, 
but Vladimir Putin has been a war 
criminal. He has been a war criminal in 
having people go in and do the horrible 
crimes—blowing 
up 
maternity 
hos-
pitals where women are giving birth,

killing children, bombing schools, de-
stroying families, innocent civilians— 
for what? To return a dream of a So-
viet Union that never existed; to re-
turn a dream of being a modern-day 
czar when that is not something you 
really want to be? No. 
Let us Senators—Republicans and 
Democrats—stand up and say: OK. We 
are going to do our job. We are going to 
vote for our legislation. We are going 
to vote for appropriations to help the 
President of the United States stand up 
and help the people of Ukraine. We all 
know what we are going to do. We all 
know what the stakes are. We all know 
what is here. Let’s stop the press re-
leases. Let’s stop the grandstanding. 
Let’s stand up and vote. Vote yes or 
vote no. Don’t stand behind something 
where you say: Well, I might be judged 
this way or I might be judged that way 
on a vote. 
Just as the Presiding Officer has cast 
tough votes, we all do. I voted 17,000 
times on this floor. I was proud to do 
it. Was I right on every single vote? I 
am sure I can go back over those and 
say: What was I thinking? But I tried 
to do what is best. 
We know what is best now: fund our 
government, pay for our young people, 
pay for our schools, pay for our nutri-
tion, pay for feeding Americans but 
also pay for helping Ukrainians who 
are standing up against a war criminal. 
We all proudly say we stand for de-
mocracy and the ideals of democracy. 
Let’s do it. The people of Ukraine are. 
When I think of the malignant lie— 
terrorist things that come from Russia 
against the proud people of Ukraine—I 
think of the Putin group calling Presi-
dent Zelenskyy a Nazi. He is Jewish 
and proud of it. He couldn’t be further 
away from being a Nazi. He is a man 
who could have fled his country as so 
many others have. He stayed there to 
protect his country, to stand with his 
country. Shouldn’t we stand with him 
too? I think we should. 
I urge my Senate colleagues, come in 
here. You go home and talk about how 
I voted for this; I voted for that. Well, 
come and vote. Come and vote. Let’s 
get this bill passed. 
I will probably say more as we go for-
ward in this. I know there are other 
Senators—like the distinguished senior 
Senator of Michigan who is about to 
speak. 
I will yield the floor on this. I have 
been here and had to vote over and 
over. As I said, I voted 17,000 times. I 
think there is only one person in his-
tory who has voted more than that. 
These haven’t all been easy votes. I 
have had to wrestle with my con-
science. 
I go back to one of the first critical 
votes I cast as the newest, most junior 
Member of the Senate—a 34-year-old 
Member of the Senate—the junior-most 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. We were asked to vote to con-
tinue the war in Vietnam. I cam-
paigned against the war in Vietnam, 
and, ironically enough, at that time, 
the majority in Vermont supported the 
war. I did not. In my own conscience, I 
did not. So we had five votes in com-
mittee to continue. Each time, the 
vote to continue failed by one vote. I 
was the newest and youngest member 
of that committee, and I voted no. I be-
came the only Vermonter ever to vote 
to end the war in Vietnam, and I was 
told that would end my Senate career; 
I was done. I think back 48 years to 
that time, and I know at the end of this 
term, I will leave, but I will leave on 
my own accord, not because of a vote I 
cast. 
Every one of us should know, cast 
what is right in your conscience. Cast 
what is right in your conscience. That 
is worth more than an election. 
Vote for this. Get it done. Show 
Ukraine that the greatest democracy 
and the longest lasting democracy cur-
rently 
in 
the 
world—the 
United 
States—stands with you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be in order to call up the 
following amendments to the motion 
to concur with an amendment: Lee No. 
4989, Braun No. 4990, Kennedy No. 4983; 
that they be the only remaining 
amendments in order to the House 
message on H.R. 2471; that at 8:30 p.m. 
today, the Senate vote in relation to 
the amendments in the order listed; 
that upon disposition of the amend-
ments, the motion to refer and the mo-
tion to concur with an amendment be 
withdrawn and the Senate vote on the 
motion to concur in the House amend-
ment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 
2471, and with 60 affirmative votes re-
quired for adoption of Kennedy No. 4983 
and the motion to concur, with 2 min-
utes for debate equally divided between 
each vote, and all votes after the first 
vote be 10 minutes; finally, that if the 
motion to concur is agreed to, the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table without inter-
vening action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, re-
serving the right to object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. 
STABENOW. 
Mr. 
President, 
across America, our schools are open 
and our children are back in the class-
room, and that is great news for every-
one. 
Unfortunately, providing our chil-
dren healthy food has been a real chal-
lenge for schools thanks to supply 
chain challenges that are happening in 
many places and almost in every State. 
This chart shows the supply chain 
disruptions across the country, with 
the red being almost 100 percent of the 
schools having supply chain challenges 
and disruptions. 
Over 90 percent of the schools in the 
majority of the country are having 
challenges just buying the food they 
need for the children. That is why, dur-
ing the pandemic, Congress made sure 
schools and meal providers had flexi-
bility to continue to feed hungry chil-
dren. 
Ninety percent of our schools, from 
rural Alaska to downtown Louisville, 
are still relying on these flexibilities to 
keep their children fed. Extending 
these bipartisan tools in the omnibus 
package is essential to helping schools 
ease back into regular operations for 
our children. 
Nutrition operations at schools are 
working hard. They are working as 
hard as they can to get back to normal, 
but it takes time, and the waivers help. 
When basic staples like chicken and 
whole grains cost double, waivers help 
schools in Caribou, MN, for instance, 
keep feeding kids. When supply chain 
limits 
available 
food 
options 
like 
ground beef or fruit, schools in Bis-
marck, ND, for instance, can use sub-
stitutions to put together healthy 
lunches. 
Hunger doesn’t go away just because 
school is out. Thanks to these waivers, 
communities from Michigan, to Ken-
tucky, to Utah were able to feed more 
children over the summer, particularly 
in rural communities. 
If schools or meal providers are un-
able to serve meals because of ongoing 
challenges, that hurts all of our chil-
dren. Over 2,000 groups, from the 
School Nutrition Association, to Feed-
ing America, to local school boards and 
superintendents 
and 
administrators, 
have all called on Congress to do what 
is right and extend these waivers. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have these letters printed in 
the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
NOVEMBER 10, 2021. 
DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
DELAURO, 
RANKING 
MEMBER GRANGER, CHAIRMAN LEAHY, VICE 
CHAIRMAN SHELBY, CHAIRMAN BISHOP, RANK-
ING MEMBER HARRIS, CHAIRWOMAN BALDWIN, 
RANKING MEMBER HOEVEN: At the start of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, Congress gave the U.S. 
Department of Agriculture (USDA) the au-
thority to issue nationwide child nutrition 
waivers to address access and operational 
challenges created by the pandemic, allow-
ing school nutrition programs, local govern-
ment agencies, and nonprofit organizations 
to adapt as necessary to changes such as 
school closures and virtual learning. This au-
thority was established through the Families 
First Coronavirus Response Act (Public Law 
116–127), 
extended 
for 
Fiscal 
Year 
2021 
through the Continuing Appropriations Act, 
2021 and Other Extensions Act (Public Law 
116–159) and again extended to June 30, 2022 
through the Extending Government Funding 
and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act 
(Public Law 117–43). Without these waivers, 
the child nutrition programs would not have 
been able to adequately respond to the fall-
out from COVID–19. The meals provided 
through the child nutrition programs have 
been critical to our nation’s pandemic re-
sponse to childhood hunger. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pandemic is 
far from over. Families continue to need sup-
port, and school nutrition departments and 
community sponsors still struggle to operate 
under the unique circumstances created by

the pandemic. Contrary to where many peo-
ple thought and hoped we would be at this 
point in the pandemic, COVID–19 continues 
to be a threat causing school closures and re-
quiring students to stay home in quarantine. 
It is unclear when schools and community 
organizations will be able to fully return to 
normal operations, particularly in light of 
future variants of COVID–19 that may de-
velop. 
When the Public Health Emergency does fi-
nally end, it will take time for nutrition op-
erations to recover from the challenges cre-
ated during the pandemic: to rebuild their 
programs and overcome the significant fi-
nancial impact. USDA will need waiver au-
thority to support schools and program oper-
ators through the summer and as the school 
year begins. 
The authority to provide a nationwide 
waiver in response to the pandemic, even if 
it increases program costs, has only been ex-
tended to June 30, 2022 and waivers cannot be 
provided beyond the 2021–2022 school year 
(which the statute defines as ending each 
year on June 30). This arbitrary deadline 
means that summer meal programs will not 
be able to operate under the same program 
rules through the entire summer. It also 
takes away USDA’s ability to respond to the 
operational and access challenges that are 
likely at the start of the new school year in 
what will hopefully be the first year back to 
normal school nutrition operations. 
We, the undersigned organizations, ask 
Congress to further extend USDA’s nation-
wide waiver authority to September 30, 2022 
to give USDA the flexibility needed to re-
spond to the pandemic as well as its after-
math, and to ensure that the federal child 
nutrition programs continue to operate and 
provide healthy snacks and meals to stu-
dents.

DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
DELAURO, 
RANKING 
MEMBER GRANGER, CHAIRMAN LEAHY, VICE 
CHAIRMAN SHELBY: We are members of the 
Mayors Alliance to End Childhood Hunger, a 
nonpartisan 
coalition 
representing 
more 
than 65 mayors across the nation working in 
partnership with Share Our Strength’s No 
Kid Hungry Campaign to ensure that every 
child has the healthy food they need to 
thrive. We appreciate Congress’ ongoing ef-
forts to help the millions of children who 
rely on federal child nutrition programs as a 
daily source of nutrition. At the start of the 
pandemic, Congress provided the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture (USDA) with the au-
thority to issue nationwide child nutrition 
waivers to ensure that children would con-
tinue to have access to healthy meals despite 
COVID–l9 related disruptions and safety pre-
cautions. 
With the pandemic continuing, we urge 
Congress to extend USDA’s waiver authority 
through the 2022–2023 school year, giving 
USDA the authority to provide community 
organizations and school nutrition providers 
with the critical flexibilities needed to re-
spond to public health requirements and sup-
ply chain disruptions. This is necessary to 
ensure that the federal child nutrition pro-
grams continue to operate and provide 
healthy meals and snacks for vulnerable 
children. 
Our cities are on the frontline of respond-
ing to challenges in our communities, and as 
mayors, we need every option available to 
fight childhood hunger. Waivers for child nu-
trition program requirements have allowed 
schools, community partners, and other or-
ganizations in our cities to operate with the 
flexibility to meet the growing need while 
protecting the health and safety of kids dur-
ing the pandemic. However, these critical 
waivers are currently set to expire at the end 
of the 2021–2022 school year, and the USDA 
does not have the authority to issue or ex-
tend waivers beyond that point unless Con-
gress acts. The uncertainty about the exten-
sion of USDA’s waiver authority is a signifi-
cant barrier to schools and community orga-
nizations trying to make plans to feed chil-
dren this summer and next school year since 
the requirements affect budgets, staffing, 
and vendors. Furthermore, the expiration of 
USDA’s waiver authority at the end of the 
2021–2022 school year further limits summer 
meal programs by not operating under the 
same programs by not operating under the 
same program rules across the entire sum-
mer. With deadlines looming, especially for 
summer operations, organizations must have 
the reassurance they need that they will be 
able to safely run programs despite ongoing 
challenges. This hits our communities par-
ticularly 
hard 
because 
summer 
is 
the 
hungriest time for children. Summer hunger 
should not be intensified because meal pro-
grams lack the flexibility they need to reach 
kids. 
The suite of child nutrition waivers has 
given community organizations and school 
nutrition providers critical flexibilities that 
have: 
Supported families who needed to pick up 
multiple meals at a time in one location as 
they returned to work or faced transpor-
tation challenges. 
Allowed for social distancing protocols 
through grab-and-go meal distribution or de-
livery. 
Ensured that children who need meals are 
getting nutritious food as families continue 
to struggle economically through the pan-
demic. 
Helped school nutrition providers support 
a return to ‘‘normal’’ in-person learning with 
the flexibility to implement safety pre-
cautions and overcome supply chain and 
labor disruptions. 
Child nutrition programs play a critical 
role in helping kids learn, stay healthy, and 
thrive. 
Again, we urge Congress to act now by ex-
tending USDA’s waiver authority so that 
schools and community organizations have 
ample time to ensure that no child struggles 
to find their next meal.

DEAR
CHAIRWOMAN
DELAURO, 
RANKING 
MEMBER GRANGER, CHAIRMAN LEAHY, VICE 
CHAIRMAN SHELBY, CHAIRMAN BISHOP, RANK-
ING MEMBER HARRIS, CHAIRWOMAN BALDWIN, 
RANKING MEMBER HOEVEN: We, the under-
signed national, state, and local organiza-
tions, ask you to further extend USDA’s na-
tionwide waiver authority through School 
Year 2022–2023 in recognition of the ongoing 
pandemic, the continuing school closures, 
and the need for flexibility to meet the needs 
of students. 
At the start of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Congress gave the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) the authority to issue na-
tionwide child nutrition waivers to address 
access and operational challenges created by 
the pandemic, allowing school nutrition pro-
grams, local government agencies, and non-
profit organizations to adapt as necessary to 
changes such as school closures and virtual 
learning. This authority was established 
through the Families First Coronavirus Re-
sponse Act (Public Law 116–127), extended for 
Fiscal Year 2021 through the Continuing Ap-
propriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions 
Act (Public Law 116–159) and again extended 
to June 30, 2022 through the Extending Gov-
ernment Funding and Delivering Emergency 
Assistance Act (Public Law 117–43). Without 
these waivers, the child nutrition programs 
would not have been able to adequately re-
spond 
to 
the 
fallout 
from 
COVID–19. 
Throughout the pandemic schools and com-
munity meal sponsors have relied on these 
waivers to keep children fed during short- 
and long-term closures, alleviate child hun-
ger, and advance racial equity and child 
well-being. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pandemic is 
far from over. Families continue to need sup-
port, particularly Black, Hispanic, and Indig-
enous families who disproportionately lack 
reliable access to healthy meals, and school 
nutrition departments and community spon-
sors still struggle to operate under the 
unique circumstances created by the pan-
demic. Contrary to where many people 
thought and hoped we would be at this point 
in the pandemic, COVID–19 continues to be a 
threat causing frequent school closures and

requiring students to stay home in quar-
antine and miss meals. Currently short and 
long-term school closures are occurring con-
stantly across the country. They are due not 
only to COVID exposures and the need to 
quarantine but to staffing shortages and 
teacher burnout. It is unclear when schools 
and community organizations will be able to 
fully return to normal operations, particu-
larly in light of omicron and future variants 
of COVID–19 that may develop. 
The authority to provide a nationwide 
waiver in response to the pandemic, even if 
it increases program costs, has only been ex-
tended to June 30, 2022 and waivers cannot be 
provided beyond the 2021–2022 school year 
(which the statute defines as ending each 
year on June 30). This arbitrary deadline 
means that summer meal programs will not 
be able to operate Under the same program 
rules through the entire summer, forcing 
many providers to stop serving ’meals or 
shut down altogether and leaving millions of 
children without access to healthy meals. 
The June 30th expiration also takes away 
USDA’s ability to respond to the supply 
chain, operational, and access challenges 
that are likely despite what will hopefully be 
the first year back to normal school oper-
ations. Moreover, it denies schools and other 
sponsors the tools and flexibilities they need 
to recover from the impacts of the pandemic 
and resume normal operations. 
We, the undersigned national, state and 
local organizations, ask Congress to further 
extend USDA’s nationwide waiver authority 
through School Year 2022–2023 to ensure 
USDA has continued flexibility to respond to 
the ongoing and evolving impacts of the pan-
demic as well as its aftermath, and to ensure 
that the federal child nutrition programs 
continue to operate and provide healthy 
snacks and meals to students.

FEBRUARY 28, 2022. 
DEAR SENATOR STABENOW: On behalf of the 
Michigan Association of Superintendents 
and Administrators, I am writing to urge 
you to extend the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture’s nationwide waiver authority to 
September 30, 2022 to give USDA the flexi-
bility needed to respond to the pandemic and 
to ensure that the districts operating federal 
child nutrition programs continue to operate 
and provide healthy snacks and meals to the 
students. 
At the start of the COVID–19 pandemic, 
Congress gave the U.S. Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) the authority to issue na-
tionwide child nutrition waivers to address 
access and operational challenges created by 
the pandemic, allowing school nutrition pro-
grams and local government agencies to 
adapt as necessary to changes such as school 
closures and virtual learning. These waivers 
have been critical in ensuring that child nu-
trition programs can adequately respond to 
the fallout from COVID–19 and continue to 
provide meals to children. 
Unfortunately, the COVID–19 pandemic is 
far from over. Families continue to need sup-
port, and school nutrition departments and 
community sponsors still struggle to operate 
under the unique circumstances created by 
the pandemic. When the Public Health Emer-
gency does finally end, it will take time for 
nutrition operations to recover from the 
challenges created during the pandemic: to 
rebuild their programs and overcome the sig-
nificant financial impact. USDA will need 
waiver authority to support schools and pro-
gram operators through the summer and as 
the school year begins. 
The authority to provide a nationwide 
waiver in response to the pandemic, even if 
it increases program costs, has only been ex-
tended to June 30, 2022 and waivers cannot be 
provided beyond the 2021–2022 school year 
(which the statute defines as ending each 
year on June 30). This arbitrary deadline 
means that summer meal programs will not 
be able to operate under the same program 
rules through the entire summer. It also 
takes away USDA’s ability to respond to the 
operational and access challenges that are 
likely at the start of the new school year in 
what will hopefully be the first year back to 
normal school nutrition operations. 
Additionally, districts need stability and 
clarity as they prepare for the 2022–2023 
school year and should know whether the 
waivers will be available. 
Thank you very much for your attention 
to this matter, 
MATT SCHUELLER, 
Director 
of 
Govern-
ment 
Relations, 
Michigan 
Associa-
tion of Superintend-
ents and Administra-
tors. 
Ms. STABENOW. We all want life to 
get back to normal. Right now, we 
need our Republican colleagues to sup-
port the bipartisan tools that will help 
get us there. 
This amendment is a short extension. 
There is a clear end date when schools 
will be back to normal operations, but 
in the meantime, these waivers are key 
to helping schools stay open and oper-
ate in person for our children. 
Taking these waivers away would 
leave schools and summer meal pro-
grams scrambling, and that hurts up to 
30 million kids who eat school meals— 
30 million kids. Smaller rural schools 
and their students would undoubtedly 
be hurt the worst. 
It is time for Congress to stand with 
our schools and with our children. So 
would the Senator agree to modify his 
request to include a vote in relation to 
Stabenow amendment No. 2994? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the modification? 
The Senator from North Carolina. 
Mr. TILLIS. Mr. President, speaking 
on behalf of Leader MCCONNELL and 
with all due respect to my friend from 
Michigan, this is a COVID-related pro-
vision which the Biden administration 
never requested. It is not in the Presi-
dent’s budget. It is not even in the sup-
plemental budget. The administration 
asked for everything under the Sun, 
but they never asked for this. 
This is another example of my col-
leagues trying to take an emergency 
pandemic, the exemptions, and turn

them into permanent changes that last 
forever. Families don’t want schools to 
be permanently stuck in a pandemic 
posture. Families want schools to move 
past COVID and get back to normal. 
Yet this amendment would continue 
policies that were explicitly designed 
to help schools close and go virtual. 
That is exactly what families don’t 
want. Parents and kids want schools 
open. 
Finally, this amendment costs $11 
billion, and it is not offset. For the 
people watching this tonight, that 
means it is not paid for. It is $11 billion 
more that we can’t afford. 
We had a fully-paid-for COVID pack-
age ready to go until the House Demo-
crats blew it up. We will not be going 
around the backs of our own Senate 
committees 
of 
jurisdiction 
because 
House Democrats killed a bipartisan 
COVID package. 
So I respectfully object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard to the modification. 
Is there objection to the original re-
quest? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The majority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now, 
in the last 4 days alone, the U.S. Sen-
ate has passed a sweeping postal re-
form bill, unanimously approved anti- 
lynching legislation, approved emer-
gency aid to Ukraine, and now we are 
about to fully fund the government. 
From start to finish, it has been a very 
productive and very bipartisan week in 
the Senate. If we cold boil down this 
week to three words in the Senate, 
they would be ‘‘productive,’’ ‘‘bipar-
tisan,’’ and ‘‘successful.’’ 
In a few moments, the Senate will 
pass the strongest, boldest, and most 
significant government funding pack-
age we have seen in a long time. This 
bipartisan funding package is a signifi-
cant and far-reaching win for the 
American people, and I am glad the 
Senate moved as quickly today as I 
hoped we would. 
To my colleagues on both sides of the 
aisle, I say: Bravo. A job well done. 
We are keeping our promise to sup-
port Ukraine as they fight for their 
lives against the evil Vladimir Putin. 
With nearly $14 billion in emergency 
aid, Congress will approve more than 
double what the administration origi-
nally requested. We took the Presi-
dent’s original request for Ukraine aid, 
examined it, and added to it, and every 
last penny of the money will be well 
spent. We are giving the Ukrainians 
billions for food, medicine, shelter, and 
support for the over 2 million refugees 
who have had to leave Ukraine, as well 
as funding for weapons transfers like 
Javelins and Stingers. 
We 
are 
going 
to 
reassure 
and 
strengthen NATO and add teeth to our 
defenses against Russia’s malicious 
cyber warfare. 
We promised the Ukrainian people 
they would not go at it alone in their 
fight against Putin, and once we pass 
this funding in a short while, we will 
keep that promise. 
On the domestic front, this funding 
bill is awash with good news for our 
country. We are about to give our 
troops a pay raise. We are increasing 
funding for our schools and Head Start 
Programs and Pell grants. We are re-
viving at last the Violence Against 
Women Act. We are kick-starting the 
President’s Cancer Moonshot. And with 
this package, we will unlock billions 
upon billions to fully fund the bipar-
tisan infrastructure law. 
Of course, we didn’t get everything 
we hoped for. In the weeks ahead, we 
must—we absolutely must—work to se-
cure more COVID money. COVID fund-
ing is about being prepared. By funding 
vaccines and therapeutics and testing, 
we will be ready for the next variant 
and stand a better chance of keeping 
schools open and preserving normality 
in our daily lives. We are going to keep 
working on this. It is too important to 
ignore. 
Now, as we reach the finish line, I 
want to sincerely thank Chairman 
LEAHY and Ranking Member SHELBY. 
What a fitting and worthy accomplish-
ment as they near the end of their ten-
ures in office. 
I have always said from my first day 
as majority leader that Democrats 
would be willing to work in a bipar-
tisan way to get things done whenever 
we could. Once the omnibus passes, the 
Senate will have sealed the deal on 
three major, bipartisan accomplish-
ments this week alone. 
Of course, when we are unable to find 
common ground, Democrats will hold 
firm in defense of our values and be 
willing to work alone if needed, but 
this week, bipartisanship has propelled 
us over the finish line. It has not been 
easy to put this package together, but 
we are moments away from getting it 
done, and I thank my colleagues from 
both sides of the aisle. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Mr. President, the ma-
jority leader referred to what we are 
doing this evening as ‘‘awash with good 
news.’’ Well, it is also awash with ear-
marks. They have not been around for 
over 10 years, and we are bringing them 
back. 
I am going to call up an amendment 
here in a bit that is going to talk about 
what to do about them, but I think you 
need to have a backdrop of what we are 
doing here this evening. 
I am on the Budget Committee, and 
we didn’t report out a budget resolu-
tion, and I don’t think we have done a 
budget consistently for over 10 years. 
This is the biggest business in the 
world that now is spending close to $5 
trillion—only $1.5 trillion of it that is 
even subject to review because the one 
ingenious thing that we have done here 
is put most of our spending on auto-
pilot. That is what drives the govern-
ment currently, and that means that 
the Budget Committee is a useless ap-
pendage because we don’t use it any-
more. 
I got here a little over 3 years ago. 
We were $18 trillion in debt. Now we 
are over $30 trillion in debt, and every-
one seems to shrug their shoulders. 
That is not a good business plan, for 
Americans to be borrowing money, 
even if it has good stuff in it, when it 
is for consumption. It will only end up 
in a hard reconciliation down the road. 
Now, let’s talk about earmarks. It is 
kind of a gateway drug to more spend-
ing. There are 367 pages of earmarks. I 
just took a quick poll how much it 
weighs in paper—4 to 5 pounds. We 
haven’t had them for over 10 years, and 
now they are back. 
In the House, they said they are OK 
with it. In the Senate, the other side of 
the aisle said they are OK with it. We 
said we are not OK with it in our Re-
publican conference, but any Senator 
can do it anyway. 
Those are called gimmicks and loop-
holes, and that is the way the place 
works. None of us here are sure how 
much money is actually being devoted 
to these. It is a wasteful tool that was 
away for a long time, and it is on top 
of a budget that was never done, and 
what we are doing this evening was 
supposed to have been done by Sep-
tember 30 of last year. Too many peo-
ple depend on this place to have a sys-
tem that is run by the seat of its pants. 
You bring the earmarks back—well, 
there are supposed to be a few rules 
that go with them. 
You are supposed to make them pub-
lic 2 days before you actually have to 
vote on them. Well, that didn’t happen. 
The text was released at 1:30 a.m. yes-
terday—2,700 pages. The House passed 
it only after 20 hours of review. That is 
at the rate of about having to come up 
with finding out a billion dollars a 
minute of what is in it. 
Members are supposed to have a fi-
nancial disclosure attached to any ear-
mark. That hasn’t happened either. It 
is just one of those simple details that 
seem to never get attended to in this 
place. 
Let’s look at a few of the doozies. 
One earmark spends half a million 
dollars to promote health equity in 
Yonkers in New York. 
One spends $1.6 million for university 
research into equitable shellfish aqua-
culture. I don’t know what that is, but 
it is in Rhode Island. 
One earmark spends $300,000 on the 
Alliance for Gun Responsibility Foun-
dation, a leftwing lobbying group that 
claims that the Second Amendment 
has a history of being used as a tool of 
White supremacy. 
These are three samples of hundreds 
and hundreds of earmarks. It is not 
what the American public deserves. 
They expect more out of us. It should 
be a merit-based system on what we 
spend here. It should be going through 
regular order on the Budget Committee 
I am on, where you bring people in to 
testify. Do you actually need more 
money? What you did spend the year 
before, was it spent well? That is the 
way all other places in this country do

it because it is the only thing that 
works. Here, the system has been so de-
graded, this is what we end up with. 
I will end with this: Most of my col-
leagues here, I think, view this place as 
a growth business, but a growth busi-
ness is based on a few things. You gen-
erally make a profit. That is not what 
this is about. But you balance your 
budget, you do things that make sense 
year after year. And when you are 
spending money that constitutes al-
most 20 percent of our GDP, you would 
think you would put more into it than 
dropping 2,700 pages in our lap and 
thinking that you can get through it. 
For those who want more of this, for 
the sake of the institution, you ought 
to be concerned about what it is going 
to look like down the road when we add 
another $1.5 trillion in debt to our cur-
rent $30 trillion, and there is no end in 
sight. A lot of stories have been writ-
ten throughout history on where that 
ends up, and it is in the ditch. 
The Medicare trust fund will be com-
pletely exhausted in about 41⁄2 years; 18 
percent benefit cuts when that hap-
pens. 
Actuarially, we have known the So-
cial Security fund is going to go broke 
in about 10 or 11 years. What will we 
do? We will probably wait until the 
year before it happens, not make any 
other reforms, and then borrow the 
money to backfill it and put more and 
more obligation on our kids and our 
grandkids. 
I am going to call up my amendment 
in a bit. 
I will yield the floor at this time. 
f 
EB–5 REFORM AND INTEGRITY ACT 
OF 2022 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I 
would like to thank Senator LEAHY for 
joining me to discuss the EB–5 Reform 
and Integrity Act of 2022. He and I have 
worked together on the issue of EB–5 
reform for many years. 
Because of that, we are proud that 
the Consolidated Appropriations Act 
2022 includes the provisions of the EB– 
5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, of 
which we are the primary authors. 
Congress originally authorized the 
EB–5 Regional Center program in 1993 
as a pilot program, and, in recent 
years, its reauthorization was often in-
cluded in appropriations bills. How-
ever, due to lack of an agreement to re-
authorize and reform the program last 
year, it lapsed on June 30 and has re-
mained lapsed since that time. 
This legislation formally repeals the 
pilot program created by Congress in 
1993 and codifies in its place a new re-
gional center program reflecting a 
number of reforms that we have pur-
sued for many years. 
All regional centers which operated 
under the lapsed and repealed pilot pro-
gram will be expected to seek a new re-
gional center designation in compli-
ance with the new requirements and re-
forms laid out in our bill. However, the 
bill allows petitions filed by immigrant 
investors under the old pilot program 
to continue to be adjudicated under the 
law as it existed when they were filed. 
The EB–5 Reform and Integrity Act 
of 2022 codifies a number of our long- 
sought reforms designed to enhance the 
integrity of the regional center pro-
gram and prevent fraud and abuse that 
have plagued it for far too long. 
The bill also requires that DHS issue 
regulations regarding the redeploy-
ment of investor funds if certain condi-
tions are met. We expect USCIS to 
oversee redeployments and take action 
as necessary. Investors should not be 
left vulnerable and regional centers 
cannot be allowed to deploy funds in 
any way they please. We expect capital 
to remain at risk, as required by the 
law, and the redeployment of funds to 
be in projects that are preapproved. 
The legislation codifies the definition 
of and the designation process for a 
‘‘high unemployment’’ targeted em-
ployment area that was found in the 
2019 EB–5 Immigrant Investor Program 
Modernization Rule. As under the 2019 
rule, the bill allows only DHS to make 
such designations. 
The codification of the so-called 
donut model from the 2019 rule will sig-
nificantly limit the number of census 
tracts that may be used to seek a des-
ignation as a ‘‘high unemployment’’ 
TEA. 
This limitation, combined with the 
exclusive authority of DHS to make 
high unemployment TEA designations, 
will crack down on the notorious prac-
tice of TEA gerrymandering, the prac-
tice of creating elaborate configura-
tions of multiple census tracts strung 
together so that a census tract with 
high unemployment at one end can be 
used in order to obtain a TEA designa-
tion for a building project within an af-
fluent census tract at the other end, 
perhaps many miles away. 
It is also our expectation that ‘‘high 
unemployment’’ TEA designations will 
be reserved for census tracts that have 
experienced persistently high unem-
ployment for a number of years and 
not because of temporary anomalous 
circumstances such as local unemploy-
ment caused by the COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Finally, the legislation puts in place 
specific visa set-asides for rural area 
projects, 
high 
unemployment 
area 
projects, and infrastructure projects. 
The visa set-aside for infrastructure 
projects is limited to true public infra-
structure projects—that is, those that 
benefit the public and the American 
people—not public-private partnerships 
or projects for a private business. 
The EB–5 Reform and Integrity Act 
of 2022 is the result of years of hard 
work and negotiation, and it is our 
hope that it brings meaningful reform 
to a program badly in need of it and, 
most importantly, much-needed invest-
ment capital and the permanent jobs 
that can come with it, to inner city 
and rural areas where it is normally 
difficult, if not impossible, to attract 
investment capital. We are grateful 
that it was included in the Omnibus 
bill and look forward to seeing it 
signed into law. 
VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT 
REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2022 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in support of the Violence 
Against Women Act Reauthorization 
Act of 2022. This bill would reauthorize 
our Nation’s critical law to respond to 
domestic violence. It is long overdue. 
Last month, I introduced the Vio-
lence Against Women Act Reauthoriza-
tion Act alongside Senators Ernst, 
Durbin, Murkowski, and others. A 
number of advocates joined us, includ-
ing Angelina Jolie, to speak about the 
importance of this bill. 
This bill has received strong bipar-
tisan support, including from 11 Repub-
lican cosponsors. And it has now been 
included in the Federal Omnibus spend-
ing bill we are set to vote on this week. 
This bipartisan bill would reauthor-
ize the Violence Against Women Act 
through 2027. And the bill includes im-
portant updates to modernize the Vio-
lence Against Women Act to do an even 
better job of protecting and supporting 
the survivors of domestic violence, dat-
ing violence, sexual assault, and stalk-
ing. 
I was proud to support the original 
Violence Against Women Act in 1994. 
And I have supported each reauthoriza-
tion of the law since then. 
This includes the most recent reau-
thorization in 2013, which passed the 
Senate by a strong bipartisan vote of 
78–22. 
I was honored to be able to sponsor 
this new reauthorization, which ex-
pands protections for survivors. 
This bill is the result of a truly bi-
partisan effort. I would like to thank 
Senators 
Ernst, 
Durbin, 
and 
Mur-
kowski for working with me to prepare 
this important piece of legislation. 
We have also had help from a number 
of our Senate colleagues on both sides 
of the aisle who have made important 
contributions to this effort. 
I would also like to thank the many 
advocates who provided valuable input 
and support for this effort. This bill 
was written in close consultation with 
the people who are on the frontlines 
helping survivors of domestic violence 
every day. 
Together, we drafted a bill that pre-
serves the good work of the last Vio-
lence Against Women Act reauthoriza-
tion and strengthens existing pro-
grams. 
For nearly 30 years, the Violence 
Against Women Act has played a vital 
role in the Federal response to domes-
tic violence, dating violence, sexual as-
sault, and stalking. I hope that this 
bill will be an effective tool to build on 
those efforts. 
The need to reauthorize the Violence 
Against Women Act is clear. These pro-
grams are vital tools that provide 
thousands of domestic violence sur-
vivors with the resources they need. 
For instance, according to the Na-
tional Network to End Domestic Vio-
lence, in a single day in 2020 there were

76,525 survivors of domestic violence 
who received assistance thanks to pro-
grams funded and supported by the Vi-
olence Against Women Act. 
Despite the progress made over the 
last three decades, sexual, emotional, 
and physical abuse are still painful re-
alities for far too many Americans. 
More than one in three women and 
more than one in four men will experi-
ence rape, physical violence, or stalk-
ing by an intimate partner in their life-
time. 
According to the National Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence, in my 
home State of California, approxi-
mately 35 percent of California women 
and 31 percent of California men will 
experience 
violence 
from 
intimate 
partners in their lifetimes. 
All too often, these instances of do-
mestic 
violence 
have 
fatal 
con-
sequences. Nationwide, an average of 
three women each day are killed by a 
current or former intimate partner. 
Based on a recent study of domestic 
violence occurring in Orange County, 
CA, just under half of domestic vio-
lence-related homicides involved an in-
dividual with a known history of vio-
lence. 
The Violence Against Women Act 
plays a critical role supporting law en-
forcement in their efforts to stop these 
perpetrators before it is too late. 
It is clear that the programs created 
by the Violence Against Women Act 
are necessary. And they need to be con-
tinually updated to meet the needs of 
survivors. 
The bipartisan reauthorization bill 
that will soon be considered by the full 
Senate would reauthorize these impor-
tant programs and provide the nec-
essary updates to strengthen them. 
This bill enhances and expands serv-
ices for survivors of domestic violence, 
including survivors in rural commu-
nities, LGBT survivors, survivors with 
disabilities, and survivors who experi-
ence abuse later in life. 
This bill reauthorizes and strength-
ens the criminal justice response to do-
mestic violence, including by improv-
ing the Justice Department’s STOP 
grant program and strengthening the 
ability of Tribal courts to address in-
stances of domestic violence on Tribal 
lands. 
This bill establishes a pilot program 
on restorative practices that focuses on 
addressing domestic violence, dating 
violence, sexual assault, and stalking 
through community-based, victim-ini-
tiated efforts to seek accountability. 
This bill invests in prevention edu-
cation 
efforts 
and 
improves 
the 
healthcare system’s response to sexual 
violence across the country. 
These updates can have a real im-
pact. According to analysis by the 
International Association of Forensic 
Nurses, only one in four hospitals 
throughout the country currently has a 
sexual assault forensic nurse on staff. 
These gaps in our healthcare system 
have critical impacts on a survivor’s 
ability to seek necessary medical at-
tention after they experience sexual vi-
olence. 
Our bipartisan bill seeks to remedy 
this problem by providing additional 
funding and training to increase access 
to forensic nurses, particularly in rural 
areas. 
Though this bipartisan bill makes 
significant improvements to our Na-
tion’s response to domestic violence, it 
is not a perfect bill. I regret that cer-
tain provisions were unable to be in-
cluded in this bill. 
In particular, I wish that we had been 
able to include a provision in this bill 
closing the ‘‘boyfriend loophole.’’ This 
provision would have ensured that indi-
viduals convicted of domestic abuse 
against a dating partner could not pur-
chase firearms. 
Individuals who are convicted of do-
mestic violence against a spouse are al-
ready prevented from purchasing a fire-
arm. It is deeply disappointing that 
there is not sufficient bipartisan sup-
port for this commonsense provision to 
close this dangerous loophole. 
Though we still have work to do, this 
bipartisan bill represents a strong step 
forward in protecting and supporting 
the survivors of domestic violence, dat-
ing violence, sexual assault, and stalk-
ing. 
It is time for the Senate to pass this 
long-overdue reauthorization of the Vi-
olence Against Women Act. 
I urge all of my colleagues to support 
this important bipartisan legislation as 
it is considered on the floor. This bill is 
not for us; it is for the millions of 
brave survivors that deserve action 
from Congress.

AMENDMENT NO. 4989 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I call up my 
amendment No. 4989 and ask that it be 
reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE] proposes 
an amendment numbered 4989. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit funding for COVID–19 
vaccine mandates) 
At the end of division HH, add the fol-
lowing: 
TITLE VII—PROHIBITION ON FUNDING 
FOR COVID–19 VACCINE MANDATES 
SEC. 701. PROHIBITION ON FUNDING FOR COVID– 
19 VACCINE MANDATES. 
None of the funds appropriated or other-
wise made available under any division of 
this Act (notwithstanding section 3) may be 
obligated or expended to— 
(1) implement or enforce— 
(A) section 1910.501 of title 29, Code of Fed-
eral Regulations (or a successor regulation); 
(B) Executive Order 14042 of September 9, 
2021 (86 Fed. Reg. 50985; relating to ensuring 
adequate COVID safety protocols for Federal 
contractors); 
(C) Executive Order 14043 of September 9, 
2021 (86 Fed. Reg. 50989; relating to requiring 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 vaccination for 
Federal employees); 
(D) the interim final rule issued by the De-
partment of Health and Human Services on 
November 5, 2021, entitled ‘‘Medicare and 
Medicaid 
Programs; 
Omnibus 
COVID-19 
Health Care Staff Vaccination’’ (86 Fed. Reg. 
61555); or 
(E) the memorandum signed by the Sec-
retary of Defense on August 24, 2021, for 
‘‘Mandatory Coronavirus Disease 2019 Vac-
cination of Department of Defense Service 
Members’’; or 
(2) promulgate, implement, or enforce any 
rule, regulation, or other agency statement, 
that is substantially similar to a regulation, 
Executive Order, rule, or memorandum de-
scribed in paragraph (1). 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, a few short 
months ago, President Biden issued a 
series of Executive orders. These Exec-
utive orders issued by the Biden admin-
istration proposed some pretty sweep-
ing mandates on the American people, 
mandates insisting that covered per-
sons, including for our purposes today 
military employees, Federal workers, 
employees of businesses with govern-
ment contracts with the Federal Gov-
ernment, and medical professionals 
who contract with CMS—basically any-
one involved with the provision of serv-
ices through Medicare or Medicaid 
must get the COVID–19 vaccine on con-
dition of termination. 
The way these mandates work is par-
ticularly nasty, especially if they work 
for one of the private companies, as is 
the case with CMS and independent 
contractor mandates. If they don’t fire 
all their workers who don’t get vac-
cinated, then they basically are ren-
dered out of business. 
Yes, the Federal Government was 
going to just impose these crippling 
costs that no corporation could afford 
to carry. They knew that this was cre-
ating a big issue and that this would 
force people into getting vaccinated. 
Here is the problem with that. Now, I 
want to be clear. I have been vac-
cinated. My family has been vac-
cinated. I believe that vaccines have 
made things safer and healthier for 
hundreds of millions of people. I also 
believe that, like any medical proce-
dure, it is not without risk, particu-
larly to some people who might have 
extreme sensitivities, who might have 
an idiosyncratic response to the vac-
cine. So it is not right to force this on 
everyone and to render those who 
refuse to get it not only unemployed 
but unemployable. 
I have received communications from 
countless people—for example, mili-
tary professionals, military officers, 
and 
enlisted 
personnel 
who 
have 
worked for the U.S. military for nearly 
two decades, who are actually coming 
up on retirement, who are saying that, 
for one reason or another, they don’t 
want to get the vaccine. Sometimes, it 
is religious; other times, it is based on 
a history of poor reactions to other 
vaccines or a prior medical condition 
that they believe would cause them to 
respond poorly or based on natural im-
munity. 
They don’t want to get the vaccine, 
and they are being told that, in the 
case of military personnel, if they 
don’t get it, then they will not receive

March 10, 2022 
an honorable discharge. This could 
render them not only unemployed but 
unemployable, and that is the case for 
many, many others subject to these 
overreaching mandates. 
Look, if we decided as a country that 
this was good policy, good policy, like 
all good policy, should be embodied in 
law. In my copy of the Constitution, 
the very first clause of the very first 
section of the very first article says 
that ‘‘all legislative Powers herein 
granted shall be vested in a Congress of 
the United States, which shall consist 
of a Senate and House of Representa-
tives.’’ Article I, section 7 makes the 
point even clearer. It says that in order 
to pass a law within the Federal sys-
tem and have it be a Federal law, it has 
to be proposed in one body or the 
other, but it has to be the same legisla-
tion passed by both Houses prior to its 
presentment to the President for signa-
ture, veto, or acquiescence. 
In this case, we have had none of 
those things. No, instead, you have 
unilateral Executive action taken by 
the President and those working with-
in his administration. In the process, 
they have bypassed that this set of 
mandates is largely unnecessary, dra-
matically overreaching, not within the 
executive power granted to the execu-
tive branch of government by the U.S. 
Congress, and is fundamentally im-
moral, in addition to being wildly and 
increasingly unpopular. 
You see, the little secret is, people 
don’t like the government doing things 
that are immoral. And all of us under-
stand that you don’t render someone 
unemployed, unable to put bread on 
the table for their children, simply be-
cause they won’t bow to Presidential 
medical orthodoxy. That is not right, 
it is not American, and it is not con-
stitutional, but more than anything, it 
is not moral. 
We all know deep down that this is 
not right. This is not something any of 
us would want to do. Not one of us 
would want to show up and tell our 
own employees: You know, if you don’t 
do what I say with regard to a medical 
procedure you may not want and as to 
which you might have legitimate, sin-
cere religious objections or that might 
be unnecessary because you have nat-
ural immunity, which, by the way—re-
cent studies have confirmed natural 
immunity is at least as good as and, 
according to many studies released by 
many countries and studies in posses-
sion of our own government, is indi-
cated to be at least as powerful as and 
in many cases more powerful than the 
immunity achieved through the vac-
cine. None of us would do that to a 
friend, a neighbor, or our own em-
ployee because we know it would be 
wrong; it would be mean; it would be 
unkind. 
You can’t atone for the unkindness 
and the immorality in that by claiming 
it is OK because it is through the gov-
ernment, 
especially 
not 
when 
the 
President of the United States is flout-
ing circumventing the Constitution of 
the United States. 
We have a chance to make this right. 
Yes, over time, sadly, Senates and 
Houses of Representatives and White 
Houses of every conceivable partisan 
combination have contributed to this 
because, yes, we have given Executives 
too much power. I complained about it 
during the previous administration in 
response to specific actions taken by 
the previous President—who was a 
Member of my own party—sometimes 
at great personal expense because I be-
lieve Congress has given the Executive 
too much power. It is bad. It is harm-
ful. It is dangerous. We have to stop it 
somewhere. 
We have a chance right now. We have 
a shot with something that is wildly 
unpopular and inherently immoral, and 
that shot exists with not funding it. We 
don’t have to fund that part of govern-
ment that goes to fund these dan-
gerous, immoral, unconstitutional vac-
cine mandates. We shouldn’t do it. I en-
courage all of my colleagues, all within 
the sound of my voice, please end this 
madness now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I will be 
very brief. There are two reasons why 
Senators should vote against the Lee 
anti-vaccination amendment that af-
fects our dedicated healthcare workers 
and our superlative military. 
First, vaccines for healthcare work-
ers protects the most vulnerable, par-
ticularly seniors and those with chron-
ic illness. Three in four COVID deaths 
in America were seniors. Two hundred 
thousand were people living in long- 
term care. Vulnerable people are safer 
when their homes, hospitals, and doc-
tors’ offices are safe. Furthermore, flu 
shot requirements for healthcare work-
ers 
were 
already 
common. 
Health 
workers know vaccinations are part of 
the job. 
Turning to the Armed Forces, I am 
simply going to quote the letter Gen-
eral Milley wrote with respect to the 
vaccination requirement. Here is Gen-
eral Milley: 
We need each and every Soldier, Sailor, 
Airmen, Marine and Guardian healthy and 
capable of performing our duties. COVID–19 
is a threat to force protection and readiness. 
General Milley went on to say: 
With this in mind, the Secretary of De-
fense intends to mandate vaccinations for all 
Servicemembers. 
And then he makes it clear: 
The Joint Force medical professionals rec-
ommended this as a necessary step to sus-
tain our readiness and protect our force, our 
coworkers, our families, and our commu-
nities. 
For these reasons, when we get a 
chance to vote on the Lee anti-vaccina-
tion amendment affecting healthcare 
workers in the military, I urge my col-
leagues to oppose the Lee amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4983 
Mr. CASSIDY. Mr. President, I am 
rising to support the amendment that 
my colleague Senator JOHN KENNEDY 
will introduce. So I will speak before 
he introduces it, but I speak in support 
thereof. 
Senator KENNEDY is going to intro-
duce an amendment that would in-
crease and that would grant disaster 
relief in several regions of the country, 
but I speak on behalf of those in South-
west Louisiana. 
A picture tells a thousand words. If 
you recall back 3 years ago, Hurricane 
Laura hit Southwest Louisiana. Two 
weeks later, almost on the exact same 
track, Hurricane Delta followed up, de-
stroying that which had not already 
been destroyed by Hurricane Laura. 
The devastation of these storms was 
dramatic. Now I thank the American 
people. There has been aid that has 
been given by fellow Americans to 
these communities, but it has been less 
than what is required. And flying over, 
the picture tells a thousand words. 
There are still blue tarps on top of 
roofs years after the storm has hit. And 
for those who are unfamiliar with it, 
blue tarps are when the roof has been 
destroyed, you place the tarp so that it 
hopefully 
provides 
protection 
that 
shingles otherwise would. 
When you are on the ground and you 
go through the neighborhood, there are 
homes that are blighted, boarded up, 
and as they have been boarded up, 
criminals have come in and businesses 
have closed. This particularly affects 
lower income communities. Those who 
have more resources, they will recover, 
but those folks who need a little extra 
help, they are not. 
And so, as we think about the aid 
that my fellow Americans are asked to 
give to their fellow Americans, I just 
will give some statistics. Hurricane 
Laura cost $19 billion in damages; Hur-
ricane Delta another $3 billion; and 
Ida, of course, not only hit Southwest 
Louisiana, but cost $75 billion in dam-
ages from Louisiana to New York. 
There is a lot that has happened. I 
ask for additional support as outlined 
in 
my 
colleague 
JOHN
KENNEDY’s 
amendment to finish the recovery for 
these folks who have endured so much. 
I humbly ask my colleagues to sup-
port the amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alabama. 
Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise 
tonight to urge my colleagues to sup-
port the Omnibus appropriations bill 
before us. 
The bill represents a massive bipar-
tisan effort that rests upon a frame-
work that preserves all legacy riders, 
rejects poison pill policy provisions 
from both sides, and achieves dollar- 
for-dollar funding parity for defense 
and nondefense increases. 
As political compromise has become 
more and more difficult here, great 
credit, I believe, belongs to Chairman 
LEAHY for making the tough choices 
that needed to be made and showing 
leadership to reach this agreement to-
night.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1108 
March 10, 2022 
The senior Senator from Vermont, 
who also serves this body as the Presi-
dent pro tempore, has accomplished 
many things in his long and his distin-
guished career. Each and every one of 
these accomplishments were made pos-
sible by his unparalleled ability to get 
things done, and this bill needed to get 
done. 
Because the international security 
situation demands a greater emphasis 
on and investment in our national de-
fense, this omnibus bill provides $782 
billion for the Department of Defense 
and for other defense functions; $4 bil-
lion more than the level authorized by 
the National Defense Authorization 
Act; $30 billion more than President 
Biden’s budget request; and nearly $42 
billion more than 2021. 
The bill also provides an 11-percent 
increase over fiscal year 2021 for the 
Department of Homeland Security, in-
cluding $6.5 billion for much needed in-
vestments in border security resources 
and a 7-percent increase for ICE oper-
ations. Critically, the package restores 
$2 billion in funding for wall construc-
tion on the southwest border. 
The bill also cuts nearly $65 billion in 
wasteful nondefense spending proposed 
in the Biden administration’s budget— 
a nearly 10-percent decrease from the 
requested level. 
Finally, the package also provides 
critical emergency assistance to our 
military, to Ukraine, and to our Euro-
pean allies, without reducing base de-
fense spending by a single dollar. 
Is an omnibus appropriations bill 
ideal? I will tell you tonight, the an-
swer is, no, it is not, but at this critical 
time and this late date, it is necessary. 
My hope is that we can pass this bill 
and use the same framework that made 
this bill possible as we begin the 2023 
appropriations process. 
I have no illusions that once again it 
will not be a difficult process. It will 
be. I know that our chairman can get it 
done, and I look forward to continuing 
to work with Senator LEAHY and the 
Appropriations staff—and with him one 
last time for both of us. 
Before I complete my remarks, I 
would also like to recognize the incred-
ible—and it is incredible—effort put 
forward by the staff members of both 
the Senate and House Appropriations 
Committees, as well as the staff of the 
respective 
leaders’ 
offices. 
Without 
them we couldn’t be where we are to-
night. We asked them to do the impos-
sible, and they delivered as they al-
ways do. And on behalf of the entire 
Senate, I want to thank them very, 
very much. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent that I be given a minute 
to describe my amendment and a 
minute be given to the Senator from 
Washington. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is unkind 
for us to tell Americans—just moms 
and dads, ordinary people who are try-
ing to live their lives and put food on 
the table—that they can’t put food on 
the table and that they are going to be 
rendered unemployed and unemploy-
able unless they defer to Presidential 
medical orthodoxy. It is not who we 
are as Americans. It is especially not 
who we are as is the case with these 
mandates. There are not adequate pro-
visions made for those with preexisting 
medical conditions, for those with reli-
gious objections, and for those with 
natural immunity. That is what we are 
dealing with here. It is illegal; it is im-
moral; it is unkind; and we should not 
fund its enforcement. 
I plead with my colleagues to support 
my amendment to defund the enforce-
ment of these mandates. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we 
have had this debate before many, 
many times. 
Vaccines are safe; they are effective; 
and they are lifesaving. Because of our 
ability to get safe and effective vac-
cines out to Americans, nearly 100 per-
cent of our schools are open again. 
More than 90 percent of people are in 
communities with low or medium lev-
els of COVID, and people are finally 
getting back to a sense of normal in 
their everyday lives. Vaccines have 
helped to make that happen. 
Here we are once again. It is hard to 
believe this isn’t the first or even the 
second time that a few Senate Repub-
licans have decided they want to risk a 
damaging 
government 
shutdown 
in 
order to oppose steps that save lives. I 
hope, for the sake of the people of this 
country, it is the last time this hap-
pens. 
There are problems real families 
want us to solve. They want us to bring 
down costs with steps like the Demo-
crats have proposed. They want us to 
stand up for democracy and the people 
of Ukraine, who are facing a war and a 
humanitarian crisis. They want us to 
learn from this pandemic so we are bet-
ter prepared for whatever is next. I am 
going to focus on finding steps that we 
can actually take to help families, and 
I believe that is what most of us want 
too. 
I urge my colleagues to vote against 
this amendment, which risks derailing 
this important bipartisan bill, delaying 
needed aid to Ukraine, and causing a 
dangerous government shutdown. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask unani-
mous consent for 20 seconds to respond. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, it is not 
helpful to American families to threat-
en the breadwinner—the mom or the 
dad or, maybe, both of them in some 
cases—with being rendered unemployed 
and unemployable and unable to put 
bread on the table. 
This is not about being anti-vaccine. 
I am not that, and neither are any of 
the Senators who are supporting this 
effort. This is about supporting Amer-
ican families. It is not supporting them 
to order them fired. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 4989 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the question occurs 
on agreeing to amendment No. 4989, of-
fered by the Senator from Utah, Mr. 
LEE. 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, I ask for the 
yeas and nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1109 
March 10, 2022 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Indiana [Mr. BRAUN], for 
himself and others, proposes an amendment 
numbered 4990. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To prohibit funds from being used 
for earmarks) 
At the end of the matter preceding division 
A, add the following: 
SEC. 7. PROHIBITION ON EARMARKS. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—Notwithstanding any pro-
vision of any division of this Act, none of the 
funds made available under any division of 
this Act may be used to implement any ear-
mark, Community Project Funding, or Con-
gressionally Directed Spending specified in 
any provision of any division of this Act or 
in the explanatory statement described in 
section 4. 
(b) RULE
OF
CONSTRUCTION.—Nothing in 
this section shall prevent funds allocated for 
any earmark, Community Project Funding, 
or Congressionally Directed Spending in-
cluded in any division of this Act or in the 
tables contained in the explanatory state-
ment described in section 4 from being 
awarded under a merit-based process under 
existing law. 
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, this 
bill has 367 pages worth of earmarks, 
roughly 5 pounds of paper. Before it 
came to the Senate, dozens of House of-
fices deleted their public disclosures. I 
think the swamp is rising again. 
Dr. Tom Coburn, he would be ap-
palled by this. He called earmarks— 
Madam President, I think it is clear 
that most aren’t interested in talking 
about earmarks—something else. I be-
lieve they lead to waste and abuse. 
That is why Congress got rid of them 10 
years ago. They should have never been 
allowed back. 
My amendment would cut every one 
of them from this bill that should have 
been run through regular process, 
through the Budget Committee, to 
where 
appropriators 
should 
have 
known what was in it until it landed in 
our laps last night. 
For anyone here that loves the insti-
tution, you ought to have enough com-
mon sense that $1.5 trillion deficits 
that are embedded in this bill aren’t a 
good business plan for the institution. 
I ask you all here this evening: Make a 
statement—a symbolic one—to get rid 
of these earmarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. BRAUN. And let’s quit shoving 
all this debt onto the next generation 
and on our kids. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the 
Senator asked those who love this in-
stitution to speak up. I am the Dean of 
the U.S. Senate. I have served here for 
48 years. I love this institution. 
I know the Constitution vests the 
power of the purse in the Congress. 
Certifications of these earmarks have 
been available to the public on our 
committee website at my request and 
Senator SHELBY’s request for 8 months. 
Everybody knows what is here. 
Vote for them or not; but, frankly, if 
I have to speak of what is needed for 
my State of Vermont, I want to be the 
one speaking for it—not somebody 
downtown. I would hope every Senator 
feels the same way. 
I yield back the rest of my time. I op-
pose the amendment. 
(Applause.) 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 4990 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
Mr. BRAUN. I ask for the yeas and

The amendment (No. 4990) was re-
jected. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 
two minutes of debate equally divided 
prior to a vote in relation to Kennedy 
amendment No. 4983. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
AMENDMENT NO. 4983 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
call up my amendment number—and 
Senator CASSIDY’s amendment No. 4983 
and ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. KEN-
NEDY], for himself and Mr. CASSIDY, proposes 
an amendment numbered 4983. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To provide emergency assistance 
for disaster response and recovery, and for 
other expenses, directly related to Hurri-
canes Laura, Delta, and Ida and to provide 
assistance for the Port Infrastructure De-
velopment Program) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. ll. EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE THROUGH 
THE 
COMMUNITY 
DEVELOPMENT 
BLOCK GRANT PROGRAM. 
(a) IN GENERAL.—In addition to amounts 
otherwise appropriated, out of any money in 
the Treasury of the United States not other-
wise appropriated, there is appropriated to 
the ‘‘Community Development Fund’’, for 
necessary expenses related to disaster relief, 
long-term recovery, and restoration of infra-
structure, housing, and economic revitaliza-
tion in areas in States for which the Presi-
dent declared a major disaster under title IV 
of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and 
Emergency Assistance Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 
5170 et seq.) related to Hurricanes Laura, 
Delta, and Ida, $2,000,000,000, to remain avail-
able until expended, for activities authorized 
under title I of the Housing and Community 
Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5301 et 
seq.), of which— 
(1) $600,000,000 shall be for activities related 
to Hurricanes Laura and Delta; and 
(2) $1,400,000,000 shall be for activities re-
lated to Hurricane Ida. 
(b) DEPOSIT OF C-BAND SPECTRUM AUCTION 
PROCEEDS IN TREASURY.—Section 309(j)(8) of 
the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 
309(j)(8)) is amended— 
(1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ‘‘and 
(G)’’ and inserting ‘‘(G), and (H)’’; 
(2) in subparagraph (C)(i), by striking ‘‘and 
(G)’’ and inserting ‘‘(G), and (H)’’; and 
(3) by adding at the end the following: 
‘‘(H) C-BAND AUCTION PROCEEDS.—Notwith-
standing subparagraph (A), and except as 
provided in subparagraph (B), of the proceeds 
(including deposits and upfront payments 
from successful bidders) from the use of a 
system of competitive bidding under this 
subsection to award licenses in the band of 
frequencies between 3700 megahertz and 3980 
megahertz (designated by the Commission as 
‘Auction 107’), $2,500,000,000 shall be deposited 
in the general fund of the Treasury and used 
for emergency assistance under section 240(a) 
of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 
2022.’’. 
SEC. lll. ASSISTANCE THROUGH THE PORT IN-
FRASTRUCTURE 
DEVELOPMENT 
PROGRAM. 
In addition to amounts otherwise appro-
priated, out of any money in the Treasury of 
the United States not otherwise appro-
priated, there is appropriated $500,000,000 for 
the Port Infrastructure Development Pro-
gram within the Department of Transpor-
tation’s Maritime Administration, to equi-
tably administer grant awards to ports that 
incurred damages from Hurricanes Laura, 
Delta, Zeta, and Ida and Tropical Storm 
Cristobal. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to be recog-
nized for up to 2 minutes of debate; 
Senator CASSIDY for 1 minute of de-
bate; and Senator SCHATZ for 2 minutes 
of debate prior to the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, in 
2020, Hurricane Laura hit Louisiana,

then Hurricane Marco hit us, then Hur-
ricane Delta hit us, then Hurricane 
Zeta, then Hurricane Ida—all in a pe-
riod of 2 years. 
Those storms caused $150 billion in 
damage. My amendment and Senator 
CASSIDY’s amendment will appropriate 
$2.5 billion in disaster aid to Louisiana. 
That would include $600 million for 
housing aid for Hurricanes Laura and 
Delta and $1.4 billion in housing aid for 
Hurricane Ida. The amendment would 
also provide for $500 million in funding 
to rebuild Louisiana ports. 
I am mindful of the fact that we 
should make sure this aid is paid for. I 
would remind everyone that through 
the heroic efforts of Senator SCHATZ 
and Senator CANTWELL, in which I 
played a small part, that we forced our 
FCC not to give away the C-band to our 
telecommunications industry and, in-
stead, auctioned it out, in which case it 
brought in $81 billion. 
And I think we can spare a little bit 
of that for people who lost their homes 
and businesses through no fault of 
their own. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Louisiana. 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I’ll 
add to what my colleague, JOHN KEN-
NEDY, said. 
If you fly over southwest Louisiana, 
you see blue tarps. Those tarps are 
there because the families have not had 
the money to replace their roofs. If you 
get on the ground, you see blighted 
neighborhoods. Those blighted neigh-
borhoods are where people have moved, 
the rooms are boarded up, criminals 
have entered, and those who have left 
are now prey to criminals. And as they 
have left, the businesses have closed. 
We do so much in this country for 
those who have been injured, and we 
appreciate in South Louisiana all that 
has already been done. But there is a 
little bit more needed to particularly 
benefit those who are less well-off. 
So I join my colleague, Senator KEN-
NEDY, in requesting that additional 
funding to complete the job started so 
Southwest Louisiana can become whole 
once more. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Hawaii. 
Mr. SCHATZ. Madam President, I re-
spect my colleagues’ desires to take 
care of the people and the needs of 
their State, and I agree there is a 
need—not just in this State but for a 
number of States that have been im-
pacted by disasters in recent years. 
We must pass a disaster supple-
mental to provide funding for States 
fairly and based on need. We wish that 
the supplemental were in this bill, but 
it was not agreed to by Republicans in 
the House and the Senate. Looking 
ahead, we ought to pass a bill to pro-
vide $2 billion and permanently author-
ize the CDBG-DR program. 
As for pay-fors—this is an important 
point—the spectrum sale funds that my 
colleagues suggested as a pay-for are 
already spoken for. That has already 
been used as a pay-for in previous bills, 
so we can’t double count; and so, unfor-
tunately, I urge my colleagues to vote 
no. Thank you. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time 
is yielded back.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this

Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, the amendment is not agreed to.

jected. 
MOTIONS WITHDRAWN 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, the motion to refer 
and the motion to concur with amend-
ment No. 4984 are withdrawn. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I 
have been impressed that our Eastern 
European allies have been able to act 
so quickly in providing aid of all kinds 
to Ukraine, including weapons these 
countries need for their own defense to 
deter Putin. 
Even the notoriously bureaucratic 
European Union has acted with unprec-
edented speed. 
When asked by Eastern European 
diplomats why Congress is taking so 
long to pass aid for Ukraine, I do not 
have a good answer. 
It always takes time to negotiate and 
draft an appropriations package to get 
it just right. But the Ukrainians do not 
have the luxury of time. 
We should have passed a Ukraine sup-
plemental last week, even if imperfect. 
It would have passed overwhelmingly, 
sending a strong message to Ukraine, 
our eastern flank allies, and the ag-
gressor Putin. 
Now, the much needed Ukraine sup-
plemental has been rolled into a giant 
Omnibus bill. 
This package has some things I 
strongly support, or even helped write. 
But these provisions are riding along 
with a big growth in spending, which I 
do not support. 
I typically vote against giant take-it- 
or-leave it omnibus bills. They are no 
way to legislate. 
Senators who are not on the Appro-
priations Committee never see the con-
tents of an Omnibus spending bill until 
we face a deadline for government 
funding running out—and an up-or- 
down vote; with no amendments. 
I urged my party’s leadership to in-
sist on a separate vote on the Ukraine 
funding package in their negotiations 
with Democrat leaders, but here we 
are, nevertheless. 
Urgent aid for Ukraine shouldn’t be 
wrapped up in an Omnibus full of unre-
lated spending. 
A cynic would say Ukraine aid was 
added to the Omnibus intentionally to 
help it pass. Well, this is a town where 
cynicism is often well-deserved. 
Senators who support helping heroic 
Ukrainians defend themselves from a 
barbaric onslaught, as I do, are being 
forced to swallow a giant, bitter pill. 
So, for the record, I oppose the spend-
ing level in this Omnibus bill and the 
broken process by which it was cobbled 
together. I am not happy about being 
pushed into a corner yet again. Be ad-
vised—I will not roll over and play nice 
going forward. 
But I cannot in good conscience vote 
in a way that would further delay ur-
gently needed support for Ukrainians 
fighting for their freedom on the front 
lines against tyranny.

We stand up for America. We stand up

NOT VOTING—1 
Inhofe 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas are 68, the nays are 31. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this motion, 
the motion to concur is agreed to. 
The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Vermont. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am 
delighted to see the vote, and I thank 
the Senators who voted with us. 
I would note that a lot of Senators, 
along with Senator SHELBY and me, on 
both sides of the aisle worked so hard 
on this. 
I especially want to say again that I 
don’t know how many times on week-
ends and in the evenings I could leave 
and go home at 10 or 11 o’clock at 
night, but our staffs were still there at 
2, 3, and 4 o’clock in the morning, 
doing this. They are the ones who de-
serve so much credit in doing this. 
This is the reality. This is our gov-
ernment. This is how we protect our 
country. It is also how we show our re-
sponsibility to a country—in this case, 
Ukraine—that is being attacked by a 
war criminal, Vladimir Putin. 
So I thank every Senator who voted 
this way. I thank the distinguished ma-
jority leader, who worked with us 
every step of the way to make sure we 
had the schedule so we could do this. I 
thank the Republicans and Democrats 
who worked with us. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, 
before I do all of these things, let me 
just thank Senator LEAHY, who was so 
diligent and so relentless from 3, 4, 5 
months ago in warning our caucus of 
the dangers—of the very real dangers— 
of a CR, which wouldn’t have been able 
to move the government forward. His 
hard work, his diligence, and his dedi-
cation has been amazing. 
I join him in thanking the great 
staffs 
of 
the 
Appropriations 
Com-
mittee, who are second to none, as well 
as my staff, who worked very hard with 
them. Meghan Taira is another person 
of whom I might be able to say it 
wouldn’t have happened without her. 
It is a very good night for this coun-
try, a good bipartisan night, and I 
thank our Senator from Vermont—and 
our President pro tempore, of course. 
(Laughter.) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority leader. 
f 
MORNING BUSINESS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the Sen-
ate be in a period of morning business, 
with Senators permitted to speak 
therein for up to 10 minutes each. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
STATE OPIOID RESPONSE GRANT 
FUNDING 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the 
State Opioid Response grant program 
has been critically important to com-
munities that have been affected by 
the ongoing opioid epidemic. 
Rates of substance use disorders have 
grown exponentially, particularly dur-
ing the pandemic, taking lives across 
the country, and opioids are the main 
driver of drug overdose deaths. Con-
gress developed the State Opioid Re-
sponse grant program to enhance our 
response to the opioid epidemic. As a 
result of this funding, States have been 
able to expand access to lifesaving pre-
vention, treatment, and recovery serv-
ices to frontline communities 
I know this funding has been impor-
tant to Vermont in addressing the 
opioid crisis, and I ask the senior Sen-
ator from Washington if this has been 
her experience with the program as 
well. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
would like to thank the Senator from 
Vermont, who has been such a leader in 
addressing the substance use disorder 
crisis and who I have been proud to 
work with on this issue. The Senator is 
correct. The State Opioid Response 
funding has been important to all 
States, particularly those hardest hit 
by drug overdose deaths. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
would like to ask the junior Senator 
from New Hampshire about her experi-
ence with this program. 
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I 
would also like to thank my friend, the 
Senator from Vermont, who has been a 
champion for helping address substance 
use disorders in New England and 
around the country. I agree that this 
program has provided essential support 
to States and communities across the 
country. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
would like to ask, given this context, if 
the 
Senator 
from 
New 
Hampshire 
agrees that both the House and the 
Senate have made clear that funding 
cliffs for this program will hamper 
States’ ability to effectively address 
the opioid epidemic? 
Ms. HASSAN. Madam President, I do. 
The fiscal year 2021 joint explanatory 
statement accompanying the omnibus 
appropriations bill directed the Sec-
retary to avoid significant funding 
cliffs between States with similar 
opioid mortality rates. For fiscal year 
2022, the joint explanatory statement 
‘‘notes that large swings in funding be-
tween grant cycles can pose a signifi-
cant challenge for States seeking to 
maintain programs that were instru-
mental in reducing drug overdose fa-
talities’’ and directs the Assistant Sec-
retary to award funds in a manner that 
avoids funding cliffs. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
thank the Senator for clearly laying 
out the Senate’s intent for the ongoing 
administration 
of 
this 
program—I 
agree. I would like to ask the Senator 
from Washington if she agrees as well?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1112 
March 10, 2022 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
do. Funding cliffs undermine efforts to 
address the opioid crisis. Without con-
sistent and reliable funding, States 
cannot invest in or maintain programs 
that will reduce drug overdose fatali-
ties. Dramatic cuts can lead to the can-
cellation of programs, firing of staff, 
and denial of care. 
The 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services and the Substance 
Abuse and Mental Health Services Ad-
ministration should prevent significant 
reductions in a State’s SOR allocation 
in a single year. In other words, fund-
ing should be allocated in a way that 
does not result in unusually large fund-
ing reductions between years. 
Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I 
thank the senior Senator from Wash-
ington, and I echo the call for HHS and 
SAMHSA to prevent significant fund-
ing cliffs. 
The State Opioid Response grant pro-
gram must facilitate the ongoing work 
States are performing to preserve com-
munities and save lives. Now is not the 
time to be cutting funding from com-
munities that are just barely beginning 
to heal from the opioid epidemic. 
Madam President, I would like to 
thank the Senators from Washington 
and New Hampshire for coming to the 
floor to discuss this important pro-
gram.

DICK DURBIN. 
f 
100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 
ILLINOIS STATE POLICE 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on 
April 1, 2022, the Illinois State Police— 
ISP—will mark 100 years since its 
founding. Its work and dedication to 
making a safer Illinois is one of pride 
and integrity. I want to take a moment 
to reflect on the ISP’s century of serv-
ice. 
A little more than a century ago, Illi-
noisans no longer wanted to be stuck 
in the mud. The year was 1921. The De-
partment of Public Works and Build-
ings reported nearly 1,100 miles of 
paved road in service, and that number 
was growing. But the State was still 
filled with dirt roads, and Illinois vot-
ers approved a new road system. The 
Age of the Automobile led the State of 
Illinois to undertake one of the largest 
building programs in the country. It 
also meant these roads and drivers 
needed to be protected. 
On April 1, 1922, the 52nd General As-
sembly approved the creation of the Il-
linois Highway Maintenance Police to 
do just that. Today, they are known as 
the Illinois State Police. The name has 
changed. The mission has expanded. 
But the dedication of the ISP has not. 
The ISP started out with just eight 
officers. Equipped with mismatched 
and self-constructed World War I sur-
plus uniforms and motorcycles, they 
set out to enforce the weight laws of 
the State and protect the growing 
highway 
system. 
The 
first 
head-
quarters was at the residence of John 
J. Stack, the ISP’s first director. The 
building also was its first mechanic ga-
rage. 
From these modest beginnings, the 
ISP would grow and evolve every year. 
A year after its founding, the ISP in-
creased to 100 officers. By the end of 
the decade, it grew to 300. The ISP 
moved under different departments and 
continued to take on new responsibil-
ities and add to its roster. And by the 
1950s, more than 1,000 members were 
authorized to conduct a variety of law 
enforcement activities, confronting a 
rising tide of crime and controlled sub-
stance abuse. The ISP’s duties and size 
continued to advance through several 
reorganizations. 
The ISP has become a nationally re-
nowned law enforcement, public safety, 
and criminal justice agency. Its respon-
sibilities have only grown with the 
challenges of times. Today, there are 
more than 1,800 sworn officers and 
more than 1,000 civilian employees. 
They protect people on more than 2,100 
interstate miles, nearly 16,000 miles of 
State 
highways, 
and 
nearly 
8,000 
bridges. 
These dedicated officers no longer 
focus on just the hard roads. From air-
craft support to helping with high-pro-
file investigations, the ISP is on the 
frontlines of law enforcement. In addi-
tion, it provides oversight of the 9–1–1 
systems and support for the statewide 
9–1–1 advisory board. The ISP also is an 
important part of fighting the opioid 
crisis. 
Through all of this, the ISP has kept 
its focus on the mission of promoting 
public safety and justice for every Illi-
nois citizen. Its officers and employees 
do this every day and with great sac-
rifice. Dozens have given their lives for 
their fellow citizens. Thousands of ISP 
recruits and cadets pursuing law en-
forcement careers throughout Illinois 
have followed in their honorable foot-
steps at the Illinois State Police Acad-
emy. 
I want to congratulate the ISP on an 
incredible century of integrity, service, 
and pride, and I thank the brave men 
and women of the ISP for their unwav-
ering service to Illinois. The second 
century of the ISP has unlimited po-
tential. 
f 
NOMINATION OF ERIC GARCETTI 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I in-
tend to object to any unanimous con-
sent request at the present time relat-
ing to the nomination of Mayor Eric 
Garcetti, of California, to be the U.S. 
Ambassador to India. 
I will object because I have received 
numerous credible allegations from 
multiple whistleblowers alleging that 
Mr. Garcetti, while mayor of Los Ange-
les, had knowledge of sexual harass-
ment and assaults allegedly committed 
against multiple city employees and 
their associates by his close adviser 
and that he ignored the misconduct. 
The allegations involving the mayor’s 
office have been the subject of public 
reporting 
and 
a 
purportedly 
inde-
pendent investigation. However, seri-
ous questions remain regarding the al-
leged misconduct, as well as the may-
or’s knowledge of that misconduct. 
First, whistleblowers who have spo-
ken with my office have not previously 
spoken to the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee and are presenting new allega-
tions that must be fully investigated. 
Second, the investigation of the Los 
Angeles 
mayor’s 
office 
reportedly 
found no wrongdoing by the mayor or 
his staff. 
However, information provided by 
multiple whistleblowers strongly sug-
gests that this investigation was in-
complete at best. The extent to which 
the 
investigation 
was 
truly 
inde-
pendent is also not clear, and the re-
port has not been made public. 
The United States owes it to the Re-
public of India to send them a qualified 
Ambassador that will represent the 
values of the United States. Mayor 
Garcetti may very well be fully quali-
fied, but at this time, the Senate needs 
to look into these allegations further. 
So until my staff and I have con-
ducted a thorough investigation and 
are able to speak with everyone in-
volved, I cannot vote to confirm Mr. 
Garcetti.

support the foreign policy and national secu-
rity objectives of the United States by help-
ing to improve the security of a NATO ally, 
which is an important partner for political 
stability and economic progress in Europe. 
(vi) Sensitivity of Technology: The Sensi-
tivity of Technology Statement contained in 
the original notification applies to articles 
and services reported here. 
(vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: 
March 8, 2022.

VOTE EXPLANATION 
Mr. WARNOCK. Madam President, I 
have a profound reverence for life and 
an abiding respect for choice. I believe 
a patient’s room is too small a place 
for a patient, her doctor, and the Fed-
eral Government. Healthcare decisions 
should be made by a patient in con-
sultation with their doctor. It is impor-
tant to me that every person, no mat-
ter 
race, 
gender, 
creed, 
or 
socio-
economic status, has access to afford-
able healthcare. This includes family 
planning and reproductive services. Re-
gretfully, I was unable to cast my vote 
on the motion to invoke cloture on the 
motion to proceed to Calendar No. 139, 
H.R. 3755, Women’s Health Protection 
Act, on February 28, 2022. Had I been 
present, however, I would have proudly 
voted yes to invoke cloture on the mo-
tion to proceed to H.R. 3755.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
REMEMBERING DR. STEPHEN J. 
SIMPSON 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
would like to take this opportunity to 
pay tribute to a wonderful professor 
and man, Dr. Stephen—‘‘Steve’’—J. 
Simpson, of Frostburg, who died on 
February 21, 2022, of pancreatic cancer. 
Dr. Simpson taught and inspired gen-
erations of students at Frostburg State 
University—FSU—in a career there 
that spanned four decades. He was a 
widely respected scholar of the Amer-
ican Presidency and the intersection of 
media and politics. 
Steve Simpson was born on October 
10, 1951, in Abington, PA. He received 
his undergraduate degree from Dickin-
son College and his M.A. and Ph.D. in 
political science from Princeton Uni-
versity. Steve spent many years as 
FSU’s dean of the college of sciences 
and provost and chief academic officer. 
While he excelled in these roles, his 
greatest enthusiasm was for being a 
professor of political science. He wasn’t 
just an academic mentor to scores of 
students over the years; he was a life 
mentor who encouraged them to aim 
high in life as well as in school. 
Steve was cheerful, kind, generous, 
and respectful to everyone whom he 
met and knew. He was a devoted son, 
brother, husband, uncle, and in-law to 
many members of an extended second 
family. He loved to discuss politics and 
play card games, especially pinochle 
with his mother-in-law Mary Morshead 
as his partner. He instilled in his neph-
ews, John and David Simpson, a love of 
history and politics, which they have 
since passed on to their children. Steve 
loved to travel with his wife of nearly 
30 years, Lisa Morshead. They traveled 
to Colonial Williamsburg, Sanibel Is-
land, and Fort Myers for spring train-
ing. He could not shake his Pennsyl-
vania roots entirely, so he was an avid 
Phillies, not Orioles, fan—but we won’t 
hold that against him. His love of base-
ball extended to participating in fan-
tasy leagues. He claimed he disliked 
pets but he loved and cared for three 
rescue cats and a dog. Steve had a big 
heart. 
On behalf of the Senate, I would like 
to extend heartfelt condolences to

eternity and his influence will continue 
to ripple far and wide among the stu-
dents he so ably taught and inspired.∑

RECOGNIZING THE NORTH DAKOTA 
GIRLS 
CLASS 
B 
BASKETBALL 
CHAMPIONS 
FROM 
KINDRED 
HIGH SCHOOL 
∑ Mr. CRAMER. Madam President, last 
year I had the honor of congratulating 
two State championship teams from 
my alma mater, Kindred High School, 
in boys basketball in March and boys 
football in November. 
Last week, it was the Kindred Vi-
kings girls basketball team that took 
home the championship trophy at the 
North Dakota Class B State tour-
nament, winning a third State title in 
just 6 years. These girls began their 
season with a win and kept on winning. 
They 
entered 
the 
tournament 
undefeated and after their last game 
were 23–0. 
In their final game, the Vikings 
played last year’s State champions, the 
Grafton Spoilers, dominating the game 
early and ending with a 64–40 win. This 
was the largest championship point 
margin of victory since 1991. Leading 
the team was senior guard Abby 
Duchscherer, who scored 25 points and 
10 rebounds. She was also named Sen-
ior Athlete of the Year and Tour-
nament MVP. 
Having three State championship 
sports teams in a year, along with its 
overall general academic excellence, 
speaks highly of the quality of the Kin-
dred Public School system. I commend 
all administrators, teachers, and staff, 
as well as the entire community for the 
role they play in supporting quality 
education. 
For this basketball championship, 
however, it is the awesome young 
women on the team who deserve the 
greatest recognition. They are Charli 
McQuillan, 
Peyton 
Gette, 
Avery 
Bartels, Abigail Duchscherer, Kacie 
Burner, Lexi Ogren, Kristina Freier, 
Ana 
Freier, 
Laela 
Eisenschenk, 
McKenzie Schmitz, Avery Amerman, 
Terryn Johnson, Leah Rolland, Ken-
nedy Bakko, and Tess Rohrbeck. 
I congratulate the team, as well as 
Coach Sam Brandt, assistant coaches 
Tenille 
Bakko, 
Ashley 
Fahnhorst, 
Perry Piatz, and Danni Sanders and all 
the loyal fans on another Kindred Vi-
kings State championship. 
I join all North Dakotans in thank-
ing each and every player on this team 
for inspiring us with your excellence. 
You continue to show us what can be 
achieved by combining faith and pas-
sion with determination and team-
work.∑

REMEMBERING STEPHANIE 
DENISE SHANNON 
∑ Ms. DUCKWORTH. Madam President, 
I rise today to pay tribute to the re-
markable life of Ms. Stephanie Denise 
Shannon, who passed away on Sep-
tember 8, 2021. 
Stephanie was born March 24, 1986, in 
Detroit, MI, to her late father, William 
Everett Shannon, Sr., and her mother, 
Toni Laverne Shannon. Upon com-
pleting high school, Stephanie at-
tended Wayne State University, where 
she pursued her passion for helping ani-
mals by studying veterinary science. 
To her close friends, she will be re-
membered as a kind and gentle spirit 
that loved video games and enjoyed 
watching a variety of films. Stephanie 
was not only a dedicated and loyal 
friend, daughter, and sister, but she 
was also a devoted mother to her son, 
Cason, whom she referred to as her 
‘‘Prince’’ and her daughter, Madison, 
whom she referred to as her ‘‘Mini 
Me.’’ The love and light that made so 
many love and appreciate Stephanie 
will be passed down and live through 
her incredible children. May her radi-
ant and loving spirit be remembered by 
all those who knew her.∑

TRIBUTE TO PYET DESPAIN 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to recognize the incredible 
performance and achievement from 
Kansas’s own, Ms. Pyet DeSpain. Pyet 
took home the grand prize during 
FOX’s inaugural ‘‘Next Level Chef’’ 
season and is officially the first Next 
Level Chef. 
A native of Kansas City, KS, Pyet de-
veloped a passion for cooking while 
helping in the kitchens of her family’s 
taquerias and restaurants. This passion 
for the kitchen led her to attend 
Le’Cole Culinaire to pursue a culinary 
education and career. A chef and an en-
trepreneur, Pyet started her own busi-
ness, ‘‘Pyet’s Plates,’’ back in 2016 to 
promote her passion for wellness, nu-
trition, and healthy lifestyle choices. A 
lifetime of hard work and dedication to 
her craft has culminated into Pyet 
earning her Next Level Chef title and a 
hefty cash prize as a nice bonus. 
The 
skills 
that 
Pyet 
developed 
throughout her time spent in kitchens 
across the country allowed her to suc-
ceed on the inaugural season of ’’Next 
Level Chef,’’ and I am sure that the les-
sons learned from this season will help 
Pyet to develop into an even more tal-
ented chef, entrepreneur, and res-
taurant owner. I look forward to seeing 
how Pyet’s passion for good food, 
healthy lifestyle choices, and respect 
for tradition will develop into future 
culinary endeavors. 
I ask my colleagues now to join me 
in 
recognizing 
this 
outstanding 
achievement by Pyet DeSpain. She has 
made her family, friends, community, 
and State incredibly proud, and we are 
all 
rooting 
for 
continued 
success 
throughout her career.∑ 
f 
TRIBUTE TO BARRY FEAKER 
∑ Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
rise today to honor and recognize 
Barry Feaker of Topeka, KS. Barry has 
served the homeless and impoverished 
since 1986 as executive director of the 
Topeka Rescue Mission, TRM. He plans 
to step down from this position but 
continue to serve as strategic adviser. 
TRM is a Christian organization that 
works with community partners to 
give shelter, meals, clothing, and other 
needed items to homeless and impover-
ished individuals. They do this by shar-
ing the love of Jesus Christ with every 
person 
they 
encounter. 
Barry 
has 
served the Topeka community for 36 
years. In April 1986, 15–20 homeless in-
dividuals were staying at TRM per 
night. By 2019, that number has grown 
to an astounding 200–300 people per 
night, a true testament to Barry’s 
work 
and 
determination 
over 
the 
years. 
As he finishes out his time as execu-
tive director of TRM, I hope he is able 
to reflect on the impact he has had on 
the Topeka Community. He not only 
expanded the services they provide and 
number of people working at TRM, but 
also increased TRM’s annual budget 
from $70,000 to $5.3 million. Along with 
that, he increased operating one sin-
gular men’s shelter, to two shelters, a 
warehouse, a distribution center, and a 
Children’s Palace. Barry offers his role 
with excitement for what is ahead at 
TRM. He believes it is time for the 
next generation to take control. He be-
lieves that the job is not done and 
there are more people in need than 
ever. I ask my colleagues to join me in 
recognizing the wonderful career of Mr. 
Barry Feaker and wish him nothing 
but joy and happiness in his next chap-
ter of life.∑

RECOGNIZING BURCHETT’S 
HEATING AND COOLING 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, as 
ranking member of the Senate Com-
mittee on Small Business and Entre-
preneurship, each week I recognize an 
outstanding Kentucky small business 
that exemplifies the American entre-
preneurial spirit. This week, it is my 
privilege to recognize the small busi-
ness, Burchett’s Heating and Cooling of 
Paintsville, KY, as the Senate Small 
Business of the Week. 
Rogell Burchett had a keen eye for 
business opportunities, which is why he 
opened Burchett’s Heating and Cooling 
in 1978. As a gas company employee, he 
could not ignore all the new homes 
being built in his area when he knew 
there was little market for natural gas 
and furnace installations. So he started 
what was then a side venture called 
Burchett’s 
Heating 
and 
Cooling. 
Rogell’s vision and dedication allowed

that side venture to grow into a family 
business, now entering into its third 
generation of management. 
When the business was first founded, 
Burchett’s operations mainly involved 
natural gas and furnace work. How-
ever, as Kentucky saw the coal indus-
try abate, Burchett’s Heating and Cool-
ing adapted to include more geo-
thermal work, as well as some light 
commercial 
work. 
Clearly, 
Rogell 
passed his sharp intuition for running a 
business along to his children and 
grandchildren, as this transition took 
place over multiple generations. Grow-
ing into what his father created, Neal 
Burchett took over the business when 
his father Rogell retired. Later on, 
Neal’s son Ryan Burchett would also 
become part of the operation, serving 
as the management arm of this family- 
owned business. Together, these three 
generations of Burchett men have kept 
Paintsville warm during the cold Ken-
tucky winters and cool in the sum-
mers, with the comfort of Paintsville 
citizens remaining their top priority. 
With over 40 years of experience, 
Burchett’s Heating and Cooling main-
tains close relationships with cus-
tomers that count on them for quality, 
year after year. Of course, when the 
business stays in the family as it has 
with the Burchett men, it is easy to see 
how the community of Paintsville 
could place their trust in their serv-
ices. That being said, Burchett’s Heat-
ing and Cooling remains an active 
member of the Paintsville community 
outside of their normal business oper-
ations. Staying true to their family- 
owned nature, the business sponsors 
the local high school basketball and 
football teams, teams that both Neal 
and Ryan used to play for during their 
high school years. Burchett’s Heating 
and Cooling also provides free services 
to their local church so that parish-
ioners can worship comfortably. 
Small 
businesses 
like 
Burchett’s 
Heating and Cooling are the lifeblood 
of small towns across Kentucky, and 
they serve as an inspiring example of 
how the entrepreneurial spirit tran-
scends multiple generations. Congratu-
lations to Neal and Ryan and the en-
tire Burchett’s Heating and Cooling 
team. I wish them the best of luck and 
look forward to watching their contin-
ued growth and success in Kentucky.∑

TRIBUTE TO BRIGADIER GENERAL 
TYLER SMITH 
∑ Mr. ROMNEY. Madam President, I 
rise today to pay tribute to an out-
standing Utahn whose decades of uni-
formed service will soon conclude. BG 
Tyler Smith, currently assistant adju-
tant general of the Utah National 
Guard, will retire after 36 years of 
decorated service to Utah and the Na-
tion. 
Brigadier General Smith’s military 
service began with his enlistment in 
the U.S. Army in 1986. Soon after, he 
deployed 
in 
support 
of 
Operation 
Desert Storm, earning liberation med-
als from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, re-
spectively. Upon returning to Utah, he 
joined the National Guard, attended of-
ficer candidate school, and commis-
sioned in the 1457th Engineer Battalion 
of the Engineer Branch, serving as a 
platoon leader and company com-
mander. In 2008, he deployed to Afghan-
istan in support of Operation Enduring 
Freedom and earned the Bronze Star 
and Combat Action Badge for his ef-
forts and outstanding leadership. 
Given his depth of experience and im-
pressive work ethic, the brigadier gen-
eral 
earned 
multiple 
appointments 
throughout his career. He served as op-
erations officer in the 115th Engineer 
Group, commander of the 85th Weapons 
of 
Mass 
Destruction-Civil 
Support 
Team, and range control officer at 
Camp Williams, UT, where he was also 
deputy commander of the Utah Train-
ing Center before his appointment as 
garrison commander in 2014. Brigadier 
General Smith served as director of the 
Utah Army National Guard’s Construc-
tion and Facilities Management Office 
before his appointment as assistant ad-
jutant general. 
In addition to the aforementioned 
awards, he also earned the Distin-
guished 
Service 
Medal; 
Legion 
of 
Merit; Meritorious Service Medal with 
2 Bronze oakleaf clusters; Army Com-
mendation Medal with 1 Bronze oakleaf 
cluster; Army Achievement Medal with 
1 Bronze oakleaf cluster; Army Good 
Conduct Medal with 2 Bronze Loops; 
Army Reserve Components Achieve-
ment Medal with 2 oakleaf clusters; 
National Defense Service Medal with 
Bronze Service Star; Southwest Asia 
Service Medal with 2 Bronze Service 
Stars; Afghanistan Campaign Medal 
with Bronze Service Star; Global War 
on Terrorism Service Medal; Armed 
Forces 
Reserve 
Medal 
with 
Silver 
Hourglass Device and M Device; Army 
Service Ribbon (ASR); Overseas Serv-
ice Ribbon with Numeral 3; Army Re-
serve Components Overseas Training 
Ribbon; and the NATO Medal (ISAF). 
His 
professional 
success 
is 
also 
matched by impressive educational ac-
colades. Before his tenure as assistant 
professor of military science, ROTC, at 
Utah Valley University, he earned sev-
eral degrees himself, including a mas-
ter 
of 
public 
administration 
from 
Brigham Young University and a mas-
ter of strategic studies from the Army 
War College. 
BG Tyler Smith has demonstrated re-
markable character as an exemplary 
public servant and a loving husband, 
father, and grandfather. Thank you for 
your dedication to our great State of 
Utah and the United States of Amer-
ica. We wish you and your family all 
the best.∑

TRIBUTE TO MEGAN NICK 
∑ Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I 
join with Vermonters across our State 
to give a huge congratulations to 
Megan Nick for her incredible achieve-
ment in winning a bronze medal at the 
Winter Olympics in Beijing in women’s 
aerials. Megan is an inspiration to so 
many Vermonters, and we are tremen-
dously proud of her. Megan credits her 
parents, Jeff and Colleen Nick, for in-
stilling in her the value of hard work, 
which certainly showed all throughout 
the 2022 Olympic Games. 
Growing up in Shelburne, Megan was 
a competitive gymnast and spent more 
than 10 years training at the Green 
Mountain Training Center in Williston. 
The 
similarities 
between 
the 
two 
sports, along with her drive for perfec-
tion, drew Megan to skiing. Then ahead 
of her senior year at Champlain Valley 
Union High School, Megan was chal-
lenged to try aerial skiing and found a 
new passion. In talking about the tran-
sition to becoming an aerial skier, 
Megan gives credit to her gymnastics 
coach, Stefan Hruska, for teaching her 
the spatial awareness required to be 
successful in the sport. 
While she learned key skills in the 
gym, it was at Cochran’s Ski Area—a 
small, family-operated, nonprofit ski 
area in Richmond, VT, and home to an-
other Beijing Olympian—that Megan 
learned to ski. That is what our small 
State is all about: communities coming 
together to help young people achieve 
their goals in a supportive, encour-
aging environment. 
Like many Vermonters, Megan grew 
up loving the outdoors. As she said her-
self in a recent interview following her 
Olympic medal, her Vermont upbring-
ing taught her ‘‘the importance of sus-
tainability and the role that we can 
play in helping our environment while 
also being able to play in it,’’ some-
thing that she finds particularly im-
portant as an aerial skier. 
This 
was 
Megan’s 
first 
Olympic 
Games, and she took bronze in her first 
event. Megan showed everyone that 
with courage and hard work there is 
nothing you can’t accomplish. I heart-
ily applaud Megan for the positive im-
pact 
she 
has 
had 
not 
only 
on 
Vermonters, but on young people all 
over the country who have a dream. 
Megan is an inspiration to us all and is 
a true testament of hard work leading 
to success. 
Megan’s level of commitment and ac-
complishments deserve all of our sin-
cere admiration. Vermont is remark-
ably proud of Megan, and we know she 
is going to continue to be among our 
brightest hopes for a better tomor-
row—both on and off the slopes.∑

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
KING, 
Ms. 
SMITH, 
and 
Ms. 
SINEMA): 
S. 3818. A bill to expand the use of 
open textbooks in order to achieve sav-
ings for students and improve textbook 
price information; to the Committee 
on Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the text of the 
bill be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the bill was ordered to be printed in 
the RECORD, as follows: 
S. 3818 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Affordable 
College Textbook Act’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) The high cost of college textbooks con-
tinues to be a barrier for many students in 
achieving higher education. 
(2) According to the College Board, during 
the 2021–2022 academic year, the average stu-
dent budget for college books and supplies at 
4-year public institutions of higher edu-
cation was $1,240. 
(3) The Government Accountability Office 
found that new textbook prices increased 82 
percent between 2002 and 2012 and that al-
though Federal efforts to increase price 
transparency have provided students and 
families with more and better information, 
more must be done to address rising costs. 
(4) The growth of the internet has enabled 
the creation and sharing of digital content, 
including open educational resources that 
can be freely used by students, teachers, and 
members of the public. 
(5) According to the Student PIRGs, ex-
panded use of open educational resources has 
the potential to save students more than a 
billion dollars annually. 
(6) Federal investment in expanding the 
use of open educational resources could sig-
nificantly lower college textbook costs and 
reduce financial barriers to higher edu-
cation, while making efficient use of tax-
payer funds. 
(7) Educational materials, including open 
educational resources, must be accessible to 
the widest possible range of individuals, in-
cluding those with disabilities. 
SEC. 3. OPEN TEXTBOOK GRANT PROGRAM. 
(a) DEFINITIONS.—In this section: 
(1) INSTITUTION OF HIGHER EDUCATION.—The 
term ‘‘institution of higher education’’ has 
the meaning given the term in section 101 of 
the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 
1001).

OPEN

MEMORATING 
THE 
LIFE 
AND 
LEGACY 
OF 
JEAN-LOUIS 
DE 
KEROUAC ON THE CENTENNIAL 
OF HIS BIRTH ON MARCH 12, 2022 
Mr. MARKEY (for himself and Ms. 
WARREN) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 541 
Whereas Jean-Louis de Ke´rouac, better 
known as ‘‘Jack’’, was a giant of American 
literature and favorite son of Lowell, Massa-
chusetts; 
Whereas, alongside Allen Ginsberg and 
William Burroughs, Jack Kerouac ignited 
the literary movement in the 1950s known as 
the ‘‘Beat Generation’’; 
Whereas the Beat Generation’s rebuke 
against traditional values and materialism 
created the foundation for subsequent coun-
terculture movements in America and be-
yond; 
Whereas the beatnik stereotype dominated 
popular media and culture in the 1950s and 
1960s, an amalgamation of Kerouac’s self-ex-
pressive, unconventional characters; 
Whereas the ‘‘Beatles’’ took their name 
after the movement, while artists such as 
Bob Dylan and Jim Morrison cite Kerouac’s 
work as major influences; and 
Whereas, more than half a century since 
his death, Kerouac’s novels still fire the 
imagination, particularly of young people, 
and serve as a tribute to their culture-chang-
ing origins: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and 
commemorates the enduring contribution of 
Jack Kerouac’s work to American literary 
culture and beyond on the centennial of his 
birth.

REN, Mr. KING, Mr. BRAUN, Mr. BENNET, 
Ms. BALDWIN, and Mr. COONS) sub-
mitted the following resolution; which 
was referred to the Committee on the 
Judiciary: 
S. RES. 542 
Whereas March 12, 2022, marks the 110th 
birthday of Girl Scouts of the United States 
of America (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘Girl 
Scouts’’), 
the 
largest 
and 
most 
impactful leadership program for girls in the 
world; 
Whereas, since its founding, Girl Scouts 
has emphasized public service and civic en-
gagement and fostered a sense of community 
in girls; 
Whereas Girl Scouts works to champion 
the ambitions, cultivate the talents, and de-
velop the skills of girls to confidently pursue 
their passions and make the world a better 
place; 
Whereas, during a time when girls are ex-
periencing increased levels of anxiety, stress, 
loneliness, and depression, Girl Scouts pro-
vides community, consistency, and connec-
tion for girls and is a safe haven in all the 
uncertainty; 
Whereas Girl Scouts supports the mental 
health of girls and is an accepting, safe space 
where— 
(1) girls feel free to be themselves; and 
(2) leaders and peers are sources of support; 
Whereas, especially in the time of COVID– 
19, Girl Scouts plays an indispensable role in 
engaging girls in afterschool and out-of- 
school programming and experiences that 
expand their world and allow them to tap 
into their inner innovator, change maker, 
and leader; 
Whereas, at a time when civics education 
is missing from many schools, Girl Scouts 
engages girls of all grade levels in civics pro-
gramming that deepens their understanding 
of democracy and government, prepares 
them for a lifetime of civic engagement, and 
motivates them to take action on issues that 
are important to them; 
Whereas Girl Scouts offers girls 21st cen-
tury programming in science, technology, 
engineering, and math (STEM), the outdoors, 
entrepreneurship, and beyond, helping girls 
develop invaluable life skills; 
Whereas, to earn the Gold Award, Girl 
Scouts take on projects that have a measur-
able and sustainable impact on a community 
by assessing a need, designing a solution, 
completing a project, and inspiring others to 
sustain it; and 
Whereas more than 50,000,000 women— 
trailblazers, visionaries, and leaders—are 
Girl Scout alums who have made the world a 
better place: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes Girl Scouts of the United 
States of America for 110 years of providing 
a safe, inclusive space where girls can hone 
their skills and develop leadership abilities; 
(2) congratulates all Girl Scouts who 
earned the Gold Award in 2021, including the 
National Gold Award Girl Scouts; and 
(3) encourages Girl Scouts of the United 
States of America to continue to champion 
the ambitions, nurture the creativity, and 
support the talents of future women leaders.

CASEY, and Mr. WARNOCK) submitted 
the following resolution; which was 
considered and agreed to: 
S. RES. 543 
Whereas hundreds of thousands of individ-
uals in the United States are targeted by 
government imposter scams each year, in-
cluding Social Security-related and Internal 
Revenue Service-related government im-
poster scams; 
Whereas government imposter scams in-
volve scammers contacting individuals in 
the United States and impersonating em-
ployees of government agencies, such as the 
Social Security Administration, to demand 
payment or personal information, which de-
frauds individuals of the United States and 
erodes trust in the government agencies that 
the scammers impersonate; 
Whereas, since 2013, the fraud hotline of 
the Special Committee on Aging of the Sen-
ate has received more than 10,000 complaints 
from individuals in all 50 States, the District 
of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico, of which one-third were report-
ing possible government imposter scams; 
Whereas there were nearly 400,000 govern-
ment imposter scams reported to the Federal 
Trade Commission in 2021; 
Whereas the Federal Trade Commission 
has 
estimated 
that 
victims 
lost 
over 
$442,000,000 in government imposter scams in 
2021; 
Whereas, according to the Federal Trade 
Commission, in 2021, older adults reported 
larger median individual losses as a result of 
government imposter scams than younger 
adults; 
Whereas, according to the Federal Trade 
Commission, in 2021, individuals in the 
United States reported losing $23,150,000 to 
Social Security-related imposter scams; 
Whereas, in 2021, Social Security-related 
imposter scams represented the largest cat-
egory of complaints received by the fraud 
hotline of the Special Committee on Aging 
of the Senate; and 
Whereas increased awareness of, and edu-
cation about, government imposter scams 
help 
to 
thwart 
government 
imposter 
scammers: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 10, 2022, as ‘‘National 
‘Slam the Scam’ Day’’; 
(2) recognizes National ‘‘Slam the Scam’’ 
Day as an opportunity to raise awareness 
about scams that involve individuals imper-
sonating government employees by any 
means, including by mail, telephone, elec-
tronic mail, or internet websites (referred to 
in this resolving clause as ‘‘government im-
poster scams’’); 
(3) recognizes that law enforcement agen-
cies, consumer protection groups, telephone

from targeting the people of the United 
States; and 
(B) educating the people of the United 
States about government imposter scams;

gaging with an armed student;
