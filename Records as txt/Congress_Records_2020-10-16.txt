PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY 
MATERIAL 
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS 
OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR 
FY 2020 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, October 16, 2020. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting 
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for 
fiscal year 2020. This status report is current 
through September 30, 2020, the end of the 
fiscal year. The term ‘‘current level’’ refers 
to the amounts of spending and revenues es-
timated for each fiscal year based on laws 
enacted or awaiting the President’s signa-
ture. 
Table 1 compares the current levels of 
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 3, 2019, as ad-
justed, for fiscal year 2020. These compari-
sons are needed to implement section 311(a) 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, 
which establishes a rule enforceable with a 
point of order against measures that would 
breach the budget resolution’s aggregate lev-
els. 
Table 2 compares the current status of dis-
cretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2020 
with the section 302(b) suballocations of dis-
cretionary budget authority and outlays 
among Appropriations subcommittees. The 
comparison is needed to enforce section 
302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
because the point of order under that section 
equally applies to measures that would 
breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-
allocation. The table also provides supple-
mentary information on spending authorized 
in excess of the base discretionary spending 
limits under section 25l(b) of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985. 
Table 3 compares the current levels of 
budget authority and outlays for legislative 
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 3, 2019, for fiscal year 
2020. These comparisons are needed to en-
force the point of order under section 302(f) 
of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, 
which prohibits the consideration of meas-
ures that would breach the section 302(a) al-
location of new budget authority for the 
committee that reported the measure. It is 
also needed to implement section 311(c), 
which provides an exception for committees 
that comply with their allocations from the 
point of order under section 311(a). 
Table 4 displays the current level of ad-
vance appropriations in fiscal year 2020 ap-
propriations bills. This table is needed to en-
force a rule against appropriations bills con-
taining advance appropriations that: (i) are 
not identified in the statement of the Chair-
man published in the Congressional Record 
on May 3, 2019 or (ii) would cause the aggre-
gate amount of such appropriations to ex-
ceed the level specified in section 2 of H. Res. 
293. 
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes and compares the budget impact of 
legislation enacted after May 3, 2019 against 
the budget aggregate in force. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman.

U.S. CONGRESS, 
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, 
Washington, DC, October 15, 2020. 
Hon. JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman, Committee on the Budget, House of 
Representatives 
Washington, DC. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: The enclosed report 
shows the effects of Congressional action on 
the fiscal year 2020 budget and is current 
through September 30, 2020. This report is 
submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of 
section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, 
as amended. 
The estimates of budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues are consistent with the 
allocations, aggregates, and other budgetary 
levels printed in the Congressional Record on 
May 3, 2019, as adjusted, pursuant to sections 
1 and 2 of House Resolution 293 of the 116th 
Congress. 
Since our last letter dated June 11, 2020, 
the Congress has cleared and the President 
has signed the following legislation that has 
significant effects on budget authority, out-
lays, and revenues in fiscal year 2020: 
Emergency Aid for Returning Americans 
Affected by Coronavirus Act (Public Law 
116–148); and 
Ryan Kules and Paul Benne Specially 
Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of 2019 
(Public Law 116–154). 
Sincerely, 
PHILLIP L. SWAGEL.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $567 million in budget authority and $798 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, H. Res. 293, which established budget enforcement procedures in the House of Representatives for 2020, does not include budget authority, outlays, 
or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. 
c In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title III and title IV of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those amounts, which 
are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

PUBLICATION OF BUDGETARY 
MATERIAL 
STATUS REPORT ON CURRENT SPENDING LEVELS 
OF ON-BUDGET SPENDING AND REVENUES FOR 
FY 2021 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON THE BUDGET, 
Washington, DC, October 16, 2020. 
DEAR MADAM SPEAKER: To facilitate appli-
cation of sections 302 and 311 of the Congres-
sional Budget Act of 1974, I am transmitting 
an updated status report on the current lev-
els of on-budget spending and revenues for 
fiscal year 2021. This status report is current 
through October 2, 2020. The term ‘‘current 
level’’ refers to the amounts of spending and 
revenues estimated for each fiscal year based 
on laws enacted or awaiting the President’s 
signature. 
Table I compares the current levels of 
total budget authority, outlays, and reve-
nues to the overall limits filed in the Con-
gressional Record on May 1, 2020 for fiscal 
year 2021 and for the 10-year period of fiscal 
years 2021 through 2030. These comparisons 
are needed to implement section 311(a) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974, which es-
tablishes a rule enforceable with a point of 
order against measures that would breach 
the budget resolution’s aggregate levels. The 
table does not show budget authority and 
outlays for fiscal years 2022 through 2030 be-
cause annual appropriations will not be con-
sidered for those years until future sessions 
of Congress. 
Table 2 compares the current status of dis-
cretionary appropriations for fiscal year 2021 
with the section 302(b) suballocations of dis-
cretionary budget authority and outlays 
among Appropriations subcommittees. The 
comparison is needed to enforce section 
302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 
because the point of order under that section 
equally applies to measures that would 
breach the applicable section 302(b) sub-
allocation. The table also provides supple-
mentary information on spending authorized 
in excess of the base discretionary spending 
limits under section 251(b) of the Balanced 
Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act 
of 1985. 
Table 3 compares the current levels of 
budget authority and outlays for legislative 
action completed by each authorizing com-
mittee with the limits filed in the Congres-
sional Record on May 1, 2020, for fiscal year 
2021, and for the 10-year period of fiscal years 
2021 through 2030. These comparisons are 
needed to enforce the point of order under 
section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, which prohibits the consider-
ation of measures that would breach the sec-
tion 302(a) allocation of new budget author-
ity for the committee that reported the 
measure. It is also needed to implement sec-
tion 311(c), which provides an exception for 
committees that comply with their alloca-
tions from the point of order under section 
311(a). 
In addition, a letter from the Congres-
sional Budget Office is attached that sum-
marizes the budget impact of legislation en-
acted since May 1, 2020. 
If you have any questions, please contact 
Jennifer Wheelock or Raquel Spencer. 
Sincerely, 
JOHN YARMUTH, 
Chairman.

a Sections 1001–1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114–255) require that certain funding provided for 2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services—in particular the Food and Drug Administration and 
the National Institutes of Health—be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) and the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 
(Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include $474 million in budget authority and $732 million in estimated outlays. 
b For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the House, the aggregate spending and revenue levels for 2021 published in the Congressional Record on May 1, 2020, by the Chair of the House Committee on 
the Budget pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (P.L. 116–37), do not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. 
c In the House of Representatives, and pursuant to section 314(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, amounts designated as an emergency requirement shall not count for purposes of title III and title IV of the Congressional 
Budget Act of 1974, and are excluded from current level totals. In addition, emergency funding that was not designated pursuant to the Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes. Those amounts, which 
are not included in the current level totals, are as follows:

d On May 1, 2020 the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget published the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2021 pursuant to Public Law 116–37. In accordance with section 314 of the Congressional Budget 
Act of 1974, section 251(b) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, and section 202 of Public Law 116–37 the Chair of the House Committee on the Budget may revise the budgetary aggregates. Revisions to

HONORING JIMMY DALE WILLIAMS 
FOR 
HIS 
YEARS 
OF 
SERVICE 
WITH GENERAL DYNAMICS 
HON. BRUCE WESTERMAN 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. WESTERMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor Jimmy Dale Williams’ life of 
work with General Dynamics. Since the begin-
ning of his career, Williams has been a leader 
for some of the most influential of defense 
projects. 
For nearly 54 years, Williams has been the 
lead worker on the Hydra 70 Rocket Motor 
line, starting his career in 1966 with Baldwin 
Electronics. He started by hand stenciling the 
lot numbers on each rocket motor, and by the 
mid-1970s, he was running the project devel-
oping the 267 and 261 warheads. After a 
transfer to Hitech in 1996, Williams began su-
pervising and training workers for the produc-
tion of the Hydra 70 rocket motor. 
In addition to his years of service in the de-
fense industry, Williams also serves as a jus-
tice of the peace for Calhoun County Quorum 
Court. A respected member of his community 
and a dedicated servant, he states that his de-
termination comes from watching his own fam-
ily. With brothers that served in the Air Force, 
Army and Marines during the Vietnam era, 
Williams says their service is what played the 
greatest part in his decision to dedicate his life 
to the work of supplying military ammunition. 
It is in Mr. Williams’ life that we find the 
shining example of service and patriotism. I 
take this time to thank him for his exemplary 
life and his love of country.

HONORING RANDY SCHEIDT 
HON. GREG PENCE 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. PENCE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Randy Scheidt for being named the 
2020 Indiana Realtor of the Year from the In-
diana Commercial Board of Realtors. 
Randy is a chair on the MIBOR Realtor As-
sociation Economic Development Council and 
its foundation. 
Forty years ago, Randy founded Don R. 
Scheidt & Co. and started the Scheidt Com-
mercial Realty LLC in 2019. 
Randy is from my hometown of Columbus, 
IN and is a member of the Rotary Club and 
serves as the Riley Children’s South-Central 
Philanthropy Council senior advisor. He is a 
true pillar in our community. 
It is an honor to call Randy a friend and I 
congratulate him and his family for this tre-
mendous accomplishment. 
THANKING THOMAS LEW FOR HIS 
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY DUR-
ING WORLD WAR II 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and recognize Thomas Lew for 
his courageous service to our country during 
World War II. 
Thomas Lew is a Chinese-American veteran 
who bravely accepted the call to serve and 
protect our nation. Lew served valiantly as an 
expert sharpshooter in the U.S. Army’s am-
phibious tank unit from 1943 to 1946. He 
achieved the rank of sergeant and completed 
his foreign service in Luzon, Philippines. 
For far too long, our veterans of color, in-
cluding Chinese-American veterans, did not 
receive the proper recognition they deserved. 
Although we will never be able to thank him 
enough for his service to our nation, we re-
main grateful to Thomas and the many vet-
erans who have so selflessly answered the 
call to service. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration 
that I honor Thomas Lew and all Chinese- 
American veterans for their distinguished serv-
ice to our country during World War II.

RECOGNIZING THE LIFE OF 
NATHAN E. RIBELIN 
HON. TRENT KELLY 
OF MISSISSIPPI 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of MAJ Nathan 
E. Ribelin, who passed away on September 
12, 2020. 
Nathan was born on January 20, 1979 to 
parents Kenneth and Beth Ribelin in Hatties-
burg, Mississippi. Nathan attended Petal High 
School in Petal, MS, and Belhaven College 
where he earned a baccalaureate degree in 
computer information systems. Nathan’s patri-
otism began on November 23, 1996, when 
Nathan enlisted in the Mississippi Army Na-
tional Guard. His commitment and dedication 
to our country never faltered, as he deployed 
overseas on three separate occasions. Nathan 
first deployed to Iraq as an enlisted Soldier. 
Following his return home, Nathan displayed 
his continued patriotism by attending Officer 
Candidate School and commissioning as a 
2nd Lieutenant in the 185th Theater Aviation 
Brigade. Nathan’s continued pride and patriot-
ism for his country was evidenced by his sec-
ond and third deployments to Afghanistan, as 
a Medical Evacuation Pilot, and to Kuwait, as 
an Aviation Brigade Intelligence Officer. 
Throughout his military career, Nathan pro-
vided mentorship and leadership to soldiers at 
multiple levels of command while serving as a 
platoon leader, section leader, and company 
commander. Nathan would later receive many 
awards, including the Meritorious Service 
Medal, Air Medal, Army Commendation Medal, 
Army Achievement Medal, Meritorious Unit 
Commendation Medal, National Defense Serv-
ice Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expedi-
tionary Medal, Global War on Terror Service 
Medal, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal. 
Left to cherish Nathan’s memory is his wife, 
Kerry Beth; his four children, Calvin, Felicity, 
Horatio, and Jubilee; his father, Ken; his broth-
er Timothy and his wife Lauren; his brother 
Scott and his wife Kimberly; and a host of 
cousins, family and friends. Nathan will be laid 
to rest amongst his brothers and sisters in 
arms at Dallas-Fort Worth National Cemetery.

RECOGNIZING 
JAMES 
JOHNSON’S 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
FOREST 
HEIGHTS POST OFFICE 
HON. J. FRENCH HILL 
OF ARKANSAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. HILL of Arkansas. I rise today to recog-
nize Mr. James Johnson’s retirement from the 
Forest Heights U.S. Postal Service office in 
Little Rock. 
Mr. Johnson served our community for 23 
years at this location and was always ready 
and willing to help customers with their various 
needs. 
This past April, Mr. Johnson came up with 
an innovative solution to combat the spread of 
COVID–19 at the Forest Heights Post Office. 
By erecting shower curtain barriers, Mr. 
Johnson limited the direct contact between 
workers 
and 
customers, 
decreasing 
the 
chances of disease transmission. 
His dedication to the job was only matched 
by the warmth and grace with which he per-
formed his duties. He welcomed all visitors to 
the office with a cheerful smile and wave. 
Martha and I were fortunate to get to know 
Mr. Johnson over the years and will certainly 
miss his kind and helpful nature. He is as true 
an example of a public servant as I have met. 
I would like to thank Mr. Johnson on behalf 
of the entire Little Rock community and wish 
him the best of luck with his retirement.

October 16, 2020 
Chair of the National Italian American Founda-
tion (NIAF) and Chief Executive Officer of the 
Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), on 
receiving the Italian honor of ‘‘Cavaliere’’ of 
the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, the 
highest-ranking honor of the Italian Republic. 
On 
October 
7, 
Ambassador 
Armando 
Varricchio of Italy presented this high honor to 
Ms. Harrison, a testament to her lifetime of ex-
traordinary accomplishment in service of the 
humanities, culture, philanthropy, and diplo-
macy. 
The granddaughter of an Italian immigrant, 
Ms. Harrison is a native of Brooklyn, New 
York and a graduate of the American Univer-
sity School of International Service in Wash-
ington, D.C. Thereafter, she began an enor-
mously successful career, starting a public re-
lations firm focused on serving the public inter-
est in the fields of environmental, labor, and 
agricultural policy. In 1990, President George 
H.W. Bush appointed Ms. Harrison to the 
President’s Export Council in the United 
States Department of Commerce. 
In recognition of her prowess and expertise 
in the humanities and the arts, in 2001 she 
was appointed Assistant Secretary of State for 
Educational and Cultural Affairs by then-Sec-
retary of State Colin Powell. While serving in 
this critical role, Ms. Harrison also assumed 
the position of Acting Under Secretary for 
Public Diplomacy and Public Affairs. Ms. Har-
rison then continued her public service, being 
appointed the Chief Executive Officer of CBP 
in 2005, where she continues to serve today. 
Under Ms. Harrison’s leadership, the CPB 
launched ‘‘American Graduate: Let’s Make It 
Happen’’, a nationwide public media initiative 
to help combat the nationwide high school 
dropout crisis. To date, over 100 stations in 48 
states are working with over 1,700 local part-
ners and schools to help students graduate. 
For her work and commitment to helping 
young people stay on the path to a high 
school diploma, Ms. Harrison was honored in 
2016 with a Promise of America Award from 
the America’s Promise Alliance. Ms. Harrison’s 
deep commitment to public media producing 
nonpartisan, commercial-free, educational con-
tent for the public good has ensured CPB’s 
continued success and critical place in our so-
ciety. 
Ms. Harrison has drawn from her life of ex-
perience to help foster a new generation of 
woman leaders, authoring two books, ‘‘A Seat 
At The Table: An Insider’s Guide for America’s 
New Women Leaders and America’s New 
Women Entrepreneurs.’’ In 2019, Ms. Harrison 
was appointed to the voting council for the in-
augural, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg Woman 
of Leadership Award, which recognizes the 
achievements 
of 
exceptional 
American 
women. Ms. Harrison is the recipient of many 
additional awards and honors, including the 
Ellis Island Medal of Honor Award and the 
U.S. Secretary of State’s Distinguished Serv-
ice Award. 
Ms, Harrison is a role model for Italian 
Americans, for women, and for anyone aspir-
ing to make a positive difference in the world. 
I am proud to rise today in recognition of her 
receiving the more than well-deserved honor 
of ‘‘Cavaliere’’ of the Order of Merit of the 
Italian Republic. 
THANKING 
LIP 
MAR 
FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY DUR-
ING WORLD WAR II 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and recognize Lip Mar for his 
courageous service to our country during 
World War II. 
Lip Mar is a Chinese-American veteran who 
bravely accepted the call to protect and serve 
his nation. Soon after his eighteenth birthday, 
Mar joined the military and served as a hos-
pital corpsman in the U.S. Navy at Oak Knoll 
Naval Hospital, where he treated American 
soldiers fighting in the Pacific theater. 
For far too long, our veterans of color, in-
cluding Chinese-American veterans, did not 
receive the proper recognition they deserved 
for their service. Although we will never be 
able to thank him enough for his service to our 
nation, we remain grateful to Lip and the many 
veterans who have so selflessly answered the 
call to service. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration 
that I honor Lip Mar and all Chinese-American 
veterans for their distinguished service to our 
country during World War II.

CONGRATULATING MR. ERIC HALE 
FOR 
BEING 
THE 
2021 
TEXAS 
TEACHER OF THE YEAR 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Mr. Eric Hale for 
becoming the first African American man be-
stowed with the honor of Texas Teacher of the 
Year in the 51 years of this award’s existence. 
Last month, the Texas Association of 
School Administrators announced that Mr. 
Hale had been named the 2021 Texas Teach-
er of the Year for his outstanding leadership 
and excellence in teaching kindergarten and 
first-grade students at David G. Burnet Ele-
mentary School. 
Mr. Hale understands the challenges some 
of his students’ face daily, from hunger, pov-
erty, or domestic violence. He has experi-
enced some of this in his own life growing up. 
He has successfully countered this negative 
energy thanks to his unique teaching style that 
is like no other. He uses music in an innova-
tive way to engage with his students while 
flooding them with positivity and encourage-
ment so that the students are able to step 
away from their worries for a moment and 
learn in a fun environment. This positivity and 
energy in the classroom is exactly what is 
needed for our students as they, just like the 
rest of us, navigate through this challenging 
time. 
Mr. Hale has been recognized for his work 
previously as the winner of the 2019 Urban 
Teacher of the Year award among others. He 
has also had the opportunity to appear on 
multiple televisions shows including the Kelly 
Clarkson show and TODAY. 
Madam Speaker, I am so thankful that the 
Dallas Independent School District is home to 
one of the very best teachers in the country. 
I wish Mr. Hale the best of luck as he com-
petes with other teachers around the country 
to receive the prestigious National Teacher of 
the Year award.

HONORING CITY OF LOUISVILLE 
MAYOR LARRY MORGAN 
HON. JODY B. HICE 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to Mayor Larry Mor-
gan, a man who faithfully serves the City of 
Louisville located in the Tenth Congressional 
District of Georgia, which I have the honor of 
representing. 
In 2007, he was duly elected as a member 
of the Louisville City Council, and two years 
later, the residents of this small, unique town 
chose him to serve as their mayor. Through-
out the years, Mayor Morgan has dem-
onstrated his commitment to the community by 
serving in various roles with his church, the 
county board of health, the downtown devel-
opment association, the Georgia Municipal As-
sociation, the Georgia Airport Association, and 
the local Rotary club. 
In his own words, he values the ‘‘gentle way 
of life that still allows time to visit and listen to 
each other’s stories, to enjoy a leisurely meal 
together,’’ and ‘‘to help out neighbors who are 
struggling. It’s a small-town life, but not just 
any small town.’’ And he’s a small-town 
mayor, but not just any mayor. 
Madam Speaker, he is a diehard Georgia 
Tech fan, a loving husband, father, and grand-
father, a devoted Christian who is an advocate 
for his community, and a dear friend to our of-
fice. I ask my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring Mayor Larry Morgan for his devoted pub-
lic service and to extend to him wishes for 
good health, encouragement for the future, 
and gratitude for his continual leadership.

RECOGNIZING THE NORTHWEST IN-
DIANA BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY 
HALL OF FAME CLASS OF 2020 
HON. PETER J. VISCLOSKY 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. VISCLOSKY. Madam Speaker, it is with 
great respect and admiration that I commend 
several remarkable leaders who have been 
honored as the Northwest Indiana Business 
and Industry Hall of Fame Class of 2020. This 
year’s inductees include Edward Garza, Nick 
Popovich, Dr. Edward Williams, and Janice 
Wilson. Additionally, Cimcor was presented 
with the Enterprise of the Year Award. 
Edward Garza is the president and owner of 
El Popular, Inc., which holds the distinction of 
being the oldest Mexican-owned business in 
the state of Indiana. Edward is the third gen-
eration of the Garza family to carry on the 
Mexican food corporation, which was started 
by his grandfather, Vincente Garza, in 1925, in 
East Chicago, Indiana. In 2001, Edward pur-
chased the company and downsized the prod-
uct line to four items: chorizo, mole paste,

mole powder, and chocolate. While the busi-
ness remains in East Chicago, Edward 
opened a second facility in Valparaiso. Under 
his leadership, El Popular has thrived and is 
looking forward to many years of continued 
success. Edward also gives much of his time 
to various charitable organizations including 
the Valparaiso YMCA, the League of United 
Latin American Citizens, and the Northwest In-
diana Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. 
Nick Popovich is the founder and president 
of Sage-Popovich, a global aviation and asset 
management firm located in Valparaiso and in-
cludes a hangar at the Gary/Chicago Inter-
national Airport. The company, founded in 
1979, has repossessed over 1,800 planes and 
helicopters throughout the years. Danger and 
risk are a part of the job, and Nick has seen 
his fair share. In 1986, he was seized by Hai-
tian troops and spent seven days in prison 
after trying to repossess a plane for a bank in 
Port-au-Prince. Over many years, Nick contin-
ued to grow his business and adding services 
including consulting, asset management, ex-
pert witnessing, and part sales. In addition, the 
company is a licensed appraisal firm that does 
valuation for over 200 organizations. Sage- 
Popovich is currently expanding into Michigan, 
managing private planes for corporations and 
individual owners. The company gives back to 
the community in many ways including the 
transport of wounded combat veterans to 
medical facilities or to reunite them with their 
units. Sage-Popovich also sponsors scholar-
ships for aviation and criminal justice students. 
Dr. Edward Williams has been a pillar of the 
community of Northwest Indiana for many 
years. He is the president of OptiFormance 
Consulting Services, LLC. Working with peo-
ple on personal development and customer 
service, Dr. Williams enjoys helping people 
reach their potential. Unofficially, he started 
his consulting business in 1988, providing 
services within churches, schools, and non- 
profits, before establishing the business as a 
formal entity in 1999. Dr. Williams is pas-
sionate about mentoring young people, and 
through his business and charitable endeav-
ors, he has served as an inspiration to the 
youth of our community. He gives his time and 
support to the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater 
Northwest Indiana, serving as a board mem-
ber for over thirty years and two terms as 
board president. In addition, he is involved 
with the Community Foundation of Northwest 
Indiana and the Laini Fluellen Charities for 
breast cancer initiatives, among others. 
Janice Wilson is the founder and retired 
CEO 
of 
NorthShore 
Health 
Centers. 
NorthShore was founded in 1995 in a high 
school as a clinic for teenagers, providing 
medical services while the students continued 
their studies. It has grown over the years to 
eight health centers and includes a dental clin-
ic and behavioral health services, as well as 
three teen clinics throughout Northwest Indi-
ana. The flagship clinic in Portage is now

CONGRATULATING LEMBHARD G. 
‘‘LEM’’ HOWELL ON RECEIVING 
THE 
CHARLES 
A. 
GOLDMARK 
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE AWARD 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to congratulate Lem Howell on re-
ceiving the Charles A. Goldmark Distinguished 
Service Award. This award is presented to an 
individual or organization that has advanced 
the cause of equal justice. 
Lem graduated from Lafayette College, with 
honors, in 1958 and then received his law de-
gree from New York University in 1964. He 
went on to practice law in the state of Wash-
ington. Lem is a true champion of justice and 
never stopped fighting for what was right. He 
won landmark cases that significantly ad-
vanced civil rights in the state of Washington, 
including ensuring equality of opportunity for 
people of color in education and employment. 
Throughout his truly legendary career he 
became one of the country’s most prestigious 
civil rights lawyers and made a name as one 
of the best trial lawyers of his generation. He 
is also a co-founder of the Loren Miller Bar 
Association, a civil rights organization dedi-
cated to fighting against discrimination and 
racism. Lem was a giant among men in the 
courtroom; his courage and devotion were un-
paralleled; and I am grateful for his work in 
advancing civil rights in Washington. 
Madam Speaker, it is my privilege and 
honor to congratulate Lem Howell on this well- 
deserved award and recognize his remarkable 
career. 
HONORING ESHAWN PETERSON 
HON. GREG STANTON 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize the invaluable contributions of 
Eshawn Peterson to the state of Arizona. As 
a champion for children and young adults, Ms. 
Peterson’s storied career has bolstered the 
ladders of opportunity and equality for count-
less Arizonans across the state, and her life-
time achievement deserves to be forever 
etched in our historical record for all to re-
member. 
For her tireless dedication to Arizona fami-
lies, Ms. Peterson was one of the few who 
were recognized as a 2020 Angels in Adoption 
by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption In-
stitute (CCAI). Founded in 2001, CCAI aims to 
ensure that every child experiences the sup-
port of a caring family. Each year, CCAI se-
lects a handful of exceptional individuals, fami-
lies, or organizations across the nation to re-
ceive the honor of Angels in Adoption. These 
honorees have gone above and beyond to 
demonstrate their unwavering commitment to 
improving the lives of children in need of per-
manent, loving homes. Ms. Peterson has 
made a personal pledge to spend her life giv-
ing more Arizona children a chance at finding 
a family who can give them the loving child-
hood she almost never had. 
Growing up, Ms. Peterson spent eight years 
in our state’s foster care system, separated 
from her six siblings. Her experiences fortified 
her strength, courage and faith. It also pushed 
her and her sister Jackie Phillips to create On-
ward Hope, Inc., a foster care and adoption 
agency that’s rooted in her belief that every 
child should have a safe home and a loving 
family. For five years and counting, Ms. Peter-
son’s organization has empowered children 
with a sense of strength and resiliency and 
help them successfully transition into the ful-
filling life they deserve through mentoring, 
workshops and coaching. Her work so far has 
left an immeasurable mark on our state and its 
children. 
Madam Speaker, I am privileged to recog-
nize Eshawn Peterson for all the work she has 
done in communities across Arizona. My state 
is truly fortunate to have her working to im-
prove the life of every child. I wish her the 
best as she continues her work to make the 
dream of a forever family a reality for so many 
children in need.

Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to celebrate the life of Jack Clifford 
‘‘Soap’’ Francis, who passed away peacefully 
on September 9, 2020. 
Soap was born on February 20, 1925 in 
Verona, Mississippi to parents Wiley and Ruby 
Francis. He was raised in Amory, Mississippi, 
where he graduated from high school in 1942. 
Upon his graduation, Soap attended Mis-

bachelor’s degree and master’s degree. His 
love for the Bulldog family persisted even after 
graduation, as he went on to endow a scholar-
ship for a Monroe county student each year. 
Soap’s patriotism became evident when he 
volunteered for World War II as a freshman in 
college. He bravely served as a First Lieuten-
ant in the United States Army Air Corps as a 
Navigator on 35 missions from England over 
Germany. His crew’s plane was crippled by 
blasts on Christmas Day of 1944 during Battle 
of the Bulge, but he safely returned home 
while still maintaining lasting friendships with 
his crew members. 
After his time in the Army, Soap opened 
Francis Insurance in 1954 and later, Francis 
Reality after marrying his wife, Mary Lib. Soap 
served on the boards of the Mississippi Mutual 
Insurance Association and the National Bank 
of Commerce, and continued to run his busi-
nesses until the 1990’s. 
In his community, Soap was known as an 
active member of First Baptist Church, where 
he was a Deacon, Sunday School teacher, de-
partment superintendent, and usher with a 
pocketful of peppermints and a smile for ev-
eryone. Soap was also a dedicated Rotarian, 
touting an impressive 60 years of perfect at-
tendance at club meetings across the globe. 
In his years of membership, he served as 
President of the Amory Club, endowed numer-
ous fellowships dedicated toward eradicating 
polio, hosted an exchange student from Aus-
tralia, and was affectionately named the ‘‘Ulti-
mate Rotarian.’’ 
In his free time, Soap loved to play tennis 
or take a long bike ride down the Natchez 
Trace. He loved to travel both internationally 
and domestically, meeting new friends along 
his journies. He was an avid musical theatre 
fan and original ‘‘foodie.’’ 
Soap was preceded in death by his son, 
Jack Francis, and is survived by his wife, Mary 
Lib Francis; daughters Beth and Patti Francis; 
and his grandchildren Mary Paige Hyland, 
Madison Francis, Ruby Ross, Violet Ross, 
Lulu Ross, Barrett Griffin, and Amory Griffin. 
Jack Clifford ‘‘Soap’’ Francis’ life was one of 
service, grace, and love for his family, commu-
nity, and country. He will be greatly missed by 
all whom he encountered.

RECOGNIZING 
ANITA 
BEVACQUA 
MCBRIDE ON BEING KNIGHTED 
WITH HONOR OF ‘‘CAVALIERE’’ 
OF THE ORDER OF MERIT OF 
THE ITALIAN REPUBLIC 
HON. BILL PASCRELL, JR. 
OF NEW JERSEY 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. PASCRELL. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
recognize and honor Anita Bevacqua McBride, 
the Vice Chair of Cultural Affairs of the Na-
tional Italian American Foundation (NIAF), on 
receiving the Italian honor of ‘‘Cavaliere’’ of 
the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic, the 
highest-ranking honor of the Italian Republic. 
On 
October 
7, 
Ambassador 
Armando 
Varricchio of Italy presented this high honor to 
Ms. McBride, a testament to her lifetime of ex-
traordinary accomplishment in service of the 
humanities, culture, philanthropy, and diplo-
macy. 
The daughter of Italian immigrants, Ms. 
McBride was born and raised in Bridgeport, 
Connecticut. She received a degree in Inter-
national Studies from the University of Con-
necticut and studied international relations and 
three languages at American University in 
Washington, D.C. and the University of Flor-
ence in Italy. 
Ms. McBride currently serves as executive- 
in-residence at the Center for Congressional 
and Presidential Studies in the School of Pub-
lic Affairs at American University, where she 
directs the First Ladies Initiative, a project 
highlighting the legacies of America’s first la-
dies and their historical influence on politics 
and policy. 
Ms. McBride’s White House service spans 
two decades and three administrations. From 
1987 through 1992, Ms. McBride was Director 
of White House Personnel under Presidents 
Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. She 
later served as Senior Advisor to the Sec-
retary of the U.S. Department of State and 
White House Liaison from 2001 through 2003 
under President George W. Bush. 
From 2005 through 2009, Ms. McBride 
served as Assistant to President George W. 
Bush and Chief of Staff to First Lady Laura 
Bush, directing the staff’s work on the wide 
variety of domestic and global initiatives in-
cluding the First Lady’s efforts to support U.S. 
foreign policy objectives in human rights, 
women’s empowerment, global health and 
human freedom. 
Ms. McBride has added to her distinguished 
career with several accomplishments in serv-
ice of philanthropy and global leadership. Ms. 
McBride is a member of the U.S.-Afghan 
Women’s Council, a historic public-private 
partnership to help Afghanistan’s women re-
build their country and reclaim their place at 
the 
center 
of 
post-Taliban 
society. 
Ms. 
McBride served as a member of the U.S. dele-
gations to the U.N. Commission on the Status 
of Women in 2002, the U.N. Commission on 
Human Rights in 2003, and the U.N. Special 
Session on HIV/ AIDS in 2006. 
Additionally, Ms. McBride is the reciprent of 
several honors and awards including the U.S. 
Department of State’s Meritorious Service 
Award, the United States National Guard and 
Reserve’s Patriot Award, the University of 
Connecticut’s President’s Award of Distinction, 
American University’s Alice Paul Award, and 
The Ellis Island Foundation Medal of Honor. 
Ms. McBride is a role model for Italian 
Americans, for women, and for anyone aspir-
ing to make a positive difference in the world. 
I am proud to rise today in recognition of her 
receiving the more than well-deserved honor 
of ‘‘Cavaliere’’ of the Order of Merit of the 
Italian Republic.

THANKING 
CAL 
FUNG 
FOR 
HIS 
SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY DUR-
ING WORLD WAR II 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and recognize Cal Fung for his 
courageous service to our country during 
World War II. 
Cal Fung is a Chinese-American veteran 
who bravely accepted the call to protect and 
serve his nation. During World War II, Fung 
was a staff sergeant and general clerk. He 
served in five European battles and cam-
paigns. Fung is a recipient of the World War 
II Victory Medal and European-African-Middle 
Eastern Campaign Medal. He was also award-
ed the Good Conduct Medal. 
For far too long, our veterans of color, in-
cluding Chinese-American veterans, did not 
receive the proper recognition they deserved 
for their service. Although we will never be 
able to thank him enough for his service to our 
nation, we remain grateful to Cal and the 
many veterans who have so selflessly an-
swered the call to service. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration 
that I honor Cal Fung and all Chinese-Amer-
ican veterans for their distinguished service to 
our country during World War II.

IN RECOGNITION OF THE 
HONORABLE JOHN A. KELLEY 
HON. ROBERT J. WITTMAN 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. WITTMAN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in recognition of the Honorable John A. 
Kelley for his service as a veteran of the U.S. 
Army, distinguished Federal Service Career of 
about 31 years, and to the Commonwealth of 
Virginia. He was a Director of the Northern 
Neck Soil and Water Conservation District 
(NNSWCD) representing the County of North-
umberland Virginia for 2 terms of 4 years each 
helping provide oversight through leadership, 
education, and technical assistance for all re-
source users. Additionally, he served as the 
Chair of the Operations Committee for the 
NNSWCD during these 8 years that brought 
many improvements to the operation of the 
District. 
He also served on the Potomac Watershed 
Roundtable, a Regional government-citizen 
forum that promotes collaboration and co-
operation among local governments and 
stakeholder interest groups promoting con-
servation. 
He was Chair of the Potomac Council for 
several years. It serves as a collaborative 
body promoting and facilitating water quality 
management practices necessary to achieve 
nonpoint source pollutions reductions in the 
Potomac River Watershed. 
He served almost 7.5 years on the Com-
monwealth Board for Waste Management Fa-
cility Operators, the last 3 as Chair. His out-
standing leadership brought significant im-
provements and efficiencies to the functioning 
of the Board and operations. 
Mr. Kelley served on the Board of Trustees 
of the Alexandria Symphony Orchestra for 
many years. He was the Operations Com-
mittee head during this time, and helped im-
prove operations of the organization. 
At the Federal level, he served as the Direc-
tor of Administration for the United States 
Commission of the Bicentennial of the U.S. 
Constitution. His efforts helped make the 
200th anniversary of our constitution a mag-
nificent success. 
He was also the Executive Director of the 
U.S. Office of Special Council, improving the 
management processes and case tracking 
systems.

grams to provide soldiers globally with better

nization of the Headquarters of the U.S. Army. 
His management capabilities are evident 
throughout his career. Mr. Kelley is a patriot of 
the First Congressional District, the Common-
wealth of Virginia, and the United States. 
Without the full support of his loving wife, 
He´le`ne, it would be impossible for him to

Mr. GALLAGHER. Madam Speaker, due to

INTRODUCTION OF THE CONGRESS 
COMMISSION ACT 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to discuss the importance of estab-
lishing 
a 
Congressional 
Commission 
to 
Strengthen Representative Democracy. My 
legislation, the Congress Commission Act, 
would establish such a commission to analyze 
the current size of the House of Representa-
tives, examine alternatives to the current 
method by which Members are elected, and 
study the harmful effects gerrymandering con-
tinues to have on our democracy. 
Today, a Member of Congress represents 
an average of over 740,000 constituents, well 
over 10 times the number of constituents envi-
sioned by the First Congress. The United 
States presents itself as the world’s leading 
representative 
democracy. 
And 
yet, 
the 
House’s weighty representative ratio makes 
the United States an outlier among the 35 na-
tions in the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development, most of them 
highly developed, democratic states. 
It has been nearly 110 years since the 
House of Representatives has increased its 
ranks even though the United States’ popu-
lation has more than tripled in size. It is time 
we examine how this institution is constructed, 
so we can make the necessary changes for a 
more equitable tomorrow. It is not only within 
the power of Congress to improve itself, but it 
has a responsibility to do so. Such an effort as 
embodied in my proposed Congressional 
Commission to Strengthen Representative De-
mocracy will result in a Congress that better 
reflects the constituencies, states, and nation 
we serve. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this critically important legislation, so 
that we can better serve the American people. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF CHRISTEL 
DEHAAN 
HON. SUSAN W. BROOKS 
OF INDIANA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today to honor the life and legacy of 
Hoosier philanthropist, businesswoman and 
education advocate Christel DeHaan. After 
building the successful Resort Condominium 
International business, DeHaan spent the re-
mainder of her years dedicated to philanthropy 
and education of children around the world. 
The City of Indianapolis, the State of Indiana 
and the philanthropy world recently lost a bril-
liant and generous woman on June 6, 2020. 
Christel was born in Nordlingen Germany in 
1942 to Anna and Adolf Stark. Her father, a 
German soldier, was killed during World War 
II. She left home at age 16 to become a gov-
erness in the United Kingdom. Four years 
later, she immigrated to the United States and 
eventually settled in Indiana. In 1974, she co- 
founded Resort Condominium International 
(RCI), a pioneering timeshare company, which 
became a leading company in the multi-billion- 
dollar industry. She co-led the business until 
1987 when she bought 100 percent of RCI for 
$67.5 million. She then expanded the busi-
ness to over 4,000 employees until it was sold 
in 1996 for $625 million. 
DeHaan then began devoting her life to phi-
lanthropy and education by founding Christel 
House International in 1998. As founder and 
board chair, her mission was to better the 
lives of impoverished children through edu-
cation, healthcare and other initiatives. Today, 
Christel House serves nearly 6,000 students 
and graduates worldwide through schools in 
India, Jamaica, Mexico, South Africa and the 
United States. 
Her vision and dedication to improving the 
lives of children is a testament to the kind 
heart that she had. The philosophy that drives 
Christel House International is ‘‘giving kids a 
hand-up, not a hand-out.’’ Throughout her life-
time, she generously donated more than $220 
million of her own money to various charities. 
She was a generous advocate for the fine arts 
in Central Indiana, leading to the fine arts cen-
ter at the University of Indianapolis being 
named ‘‘The Christel DeHaan Fine Arts Cen-
ter.’’ 
DeHaan was featured on Forbes’ list of 
America’s Self-Made Women for the past five 
years, most recently with a net worth esti-
mated at $950 million. She was a shining ex-
ample for girls all over the world of a ‘‘self- 
made woman.’’ For this and many reasons, 
she was honored with three honorary doc-
torate degrees from Marian University, the 
University of Indianapolis and the University of 
Nottingham in England. 
Christel DeHaan was a leader, a philan-
thropist and an inspiration for so many, includ-
ing me. Her generosity, commitment and focus 
was rare and she will be deeply missed by all 
who knew her. I extend my deepest sympathy 
to those who survive including her older sister, 
three children, numerous grandchildren, great 
grandchildren, nieces and nephews. Though 
Christel is gone, I know that her legacy will 
live on for generations through Christel House 
International and will continue to change lives 
around the world. 
THANKING WILLIAM ‘‘BILL’’ CHIN 
FOR HIS SERVICE TO OUR COUN-
TRY DURING WORLD WAR II 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and recognize William Chin for 
his courageous service to our country during 
World War II. 
William Chin is a Chinese-American veteran 
who bravely accepted the call to protect and 
serve his country. He joined the U.S. Army in 
December of 1943 and served in the 93rd 
Cavalry Reconnaissance squadron in the Eu-
ropean theater. In recognition of Chin’s serv-
ice, he received the European-African-Middle 
Eastern Campaign Medal and the Good Con-
duct Medal. 
For far too long, our veterans of color, in-
cluding Chinese-American veterans, did not 
receive the proper recognition they deserved 
for their service. Although we will never be 
able to thank him enough for his service to our 
nation, we remain grateful to Bill and the many 
veterans who have so selflessly answered the 
call to service.

that I honor William Chin and all Chinese- 
American veterans for their distinguished serv-
ice to our country during World War II.

IN HONOR OF DR. RANDALL SPIN-
DLE’S 
RETIREMENT 
FROM 
SOUTHERN NAZARENE UNIVER-
SITY 
HON. KENNY MARCHANT 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Friday, October 16, 2020 
Mr. MARCHANT. Madam Speaker, I rise to 
pay tribute to a dear friend and classmate, Dr. 
Randall Spindle, in honor of his upcoming re-
tirement from Southern Nazarene University 
(SNU) in Bethany, Oklahoma. 
Long before he became a professor of his-
tory and business, I met Dr. Spindle as a fel-
low freshman classmate in the fall of 1969 at 
SNU. Little did I know at that time what a re-
markable friend I had just made. His love and 
dedication for our alma mater has spanned 
decades and generations of students. He will 
be greatly missed when he leaves campus for 
the last time as a member of the faculty, but 
I imagine he will still be actively involved in 
SNU in his retirement. 
Dr. Spindle’s career touched on so many 
different facets of life on campus, much more 
than an ordinary professor. He viewed the 
school through many different perspectives, 
with each one allowing him to be a better 
leader on campus and for the thousands of 
students he helped educate. 
His association with the school started long 
before I knew him. As a young teenager he 
earned his first paycheck digging trenches for 
the construction of Snowbarger Hall. Years 
later after his graduation from SNU, he re-
turned to campus in 1976 and served as the 
Resident Director of Snowbarger Hall for three 
years, literally serving at a building he helped 
construct. During his time as Resident Direc-
tor, he earned his master’s degree, the first of

his advanced degrees. Randall would later 
complete a doctorate from Oklahoma State in 
1981 and a law degree from the University of 
Oklahoma in 1991. 
I can think of nobody else who has helped 
build as a teenager, went to as a college stu-
dent, and then taught for decades all at the 
same institution. This is the triple crown of loy-
alty, for which we honor him today. His dedi-
cation to the school is unmatched in both 
service and impact. 
I ask all of my colleagues to join me in hon-
oring Dr. Randall Spindle’s long career at 
Southern Nazarene University and wish him 
all the very best for a well-earned retirement.
