WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MARCH 18, 2021 
No. 51 
House of Representatives 
The House met at noon and was 
called to order by the Speaker. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Margaret 
Grun Kibben, offered the following 
prayer: 
Holy God, as the week proceeds with 
so much more left to do, we pray Your 
divine presence in every debate, every 
hearing, every meeting, every con-
versation, and not the least, in every 
vote. 
Given the sheer exhaustion, frenetic 
schedule, inadequate nourishment of 
body and soul through which these 
Members dutifully toil, without Your 
divine guidance, who is able to govern 
Your people? 
Even as You answered King Solo-
mon’s prayer, grant these Your serv-
ants discerning hearts in the govern-
ance of this country. May they be able 
to parse out the necessary from the 
convenient. May they divide Your pur-
pose from their prejudice. Simply, may 
they be able to distinguish right from 
wrong. 
Unto Your care we commend then to-
day’s proceedings that they would 
prove worthy in Your sight. 
We offer this prayer in the strength 
of Your name. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER. Pursuant to section 
11(a) of House Resolution 188, the Jour-
nal of the last day’s proceedings is ap-
proved. 
f 
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER. Will the gentle-
woman from Colorado (Mrs. BOEBERT) 
come forward and lead the House in the 
Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mrs. BOEBERT led the Pledge of Al-
legiance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. 
f 
ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
The SPEAKER. The Chair will enter-
tain up to 15 requests for 1-minute 
speeches on each side of the aisle. 
f 
RENAME RUSSELL SENATE 
OFFICE BUILDING 
(Mr. GREEN of Texas asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, it is said that a picture is worth a 
thousand words. This is a picture of a 
symbol of national shame. It is the 
Russell Senate Office Building. The 
Russell 
Senate 
Office 
Building 
is 
named after Richard Russell, a racist 
and a bigot. 
For 49 years, taxpayer dollars have 
gone into this facility. For 49 years, 
people have had to endure knowing 
that this facility is named after a 
bigot. 
I believe that it is time for change. It 
is time to take the name of Richard 
Russell off this building. We don’t have 
to name it in honor of someone else. 
Let it revert to the name that it had 
prior to Richard Russell; it was the Old 
Senate Office Building. 
I ask that we do this, and I am going 
to write a letter to each and every Sen-
ator explaining this and hoping that 
each and every Senator will at some 
point decide that a building paid for 
with taxpayer dollars should not be 
named in honor of a racist and a bigot. 
f 
HONORING HARRY TALBOTT 
(Mrs. BOEBERT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to commemorate the life of a 
western Colorado legend and my dear 
friend, Harry Talbott of Palisade. 
At his 2018 induction into the Colo-
rado Agriculture Hall of Fame, Harry 
remarked: 
The world may little remember nor 
long note what we have done here to-
night, but our contributions to Colo-
rado agriculture will live long after we 
are gone and make it easier for those 
who come after us. 
I am honored and blessed to have 
known Harry, as is western Colorado. 
As the founder of one of Colorado’s 
largest and oldest orchards, Talbott 
Farms, his contributions to agriculture 
in Colorado cannot be overstated. 
Grown 
with 
snowmelt 
from 
the 
Grand Mesa, the Talbott name is syn-
onymous with the best peaches many 
will ever have the pleasure of experi-
encing. 
Along the way, he employed and 
mentored countless Coloradans, many 
of whom remain in agriculture today 
with farms of their own. 
Without Harry and his grandiose vi-
sion for Palisade, the Western Slope 
wouldn’t be the place that it is today. 
He is the giant whose shoulders the 
community now stands upon. 
However, I would be remiss to con-
fine any tribute merely to Harry’s 
business endeavors because they are 
but a small piece of the man he was. 
Harry was the quintessential renais-
sance man. Harry was a veteran, hav-
ing served honorably in the United 
States Army. Harry was a science 
teacher who invested in the hearts and 
minds of the children in our commu-
nities. 
Harry was a pioneer and an icon of 
Colorado’s Third District, a man whose 
character has been integral to that of 
the Western Slope. 
Harry leaves behind his wife, Bonnie; 
his children, Bruce, Nathan, Charlie, 
Dave, and Kathy; as well as numerous 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1504 
March 18, 2021 
I extend to them my heartfelt condo-
lences and pray that God’s holy spirit 
will comfort them and mend their bro-
ken hearts. Today, we honor a life of 
service. 
Harry, we love you. 
f 
HONORING KEVIN VALENCIA 
(Mrs. DEMINGS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. DEMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate the life of Orlando 
Police Officer Kevin Valencia. 
As a former chief in Orlando, I join 
my brothers and sisters at OPD and 
Kevin’s wife, Meghan, and their two 
sons in expressing gratitude for his 
service and in mourning his passing. 
In 2018, Officer Valencia responded to 
a domestic violence call involving a 
convicted felon armed with a firearm 
who was holding four children hostage. 
Upon trying to gain entry and save the 
children, Kevin was shot and critically 
wounded. The subject later took the 
lives of those children. 
Kevin fought hard to survive but suc-
cumbed to his injuries on March 15 of 
this year. 
We use the word ‘‘hero’’ often, and 
sometimes I think we forget the many 
heroic actions our men and women in 
blue perform every day. But Officer 
Kevin Valencia was a hero in every 
sense of the word. 
On March 15, a part of America died. 
We are grateful for a life well lived. 
Courage, pride, and commitment. 
f 
RECOGNIZING FRANK BECKMANN 
(Mr. WALBERG asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the upcoming re-
tirement of a legend in Michigan 
broadcasting, Frank Beckmann. 
For the past 48 years, Frank has been 
a pillar of the WJR airwaves. Frank 
has been inducted into the Michigan 
Sports Hall of Fame and Michigan As-
sociation of Broadcasters Hall of Fame, 
and he has a list of professional acco-
lades longer than the time we have 
today. 
The Maize and Blue faithful know 
him as the voice of Michigan football 
for over three decades. His weekly lis-
teners, the best informed in all of talk 
radio, know him as a clear and compel-
ling proponent of commonsense values. 
Nonprofits and charities across the 
State know his generosity in using his 
microphone to support many worthy 
causes. I am blessed to know him as a 
friend. 
Congratulations, Frank, on a long 
and storied career. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
wishing Frank Beckmann a wonderful 
retirement filled with family, lots of 
golf, and coolers full of fresh Lake Erie 
walleye. 
RESTORING NORMAL RELATIONS 
WITH CUBA 
(Mr. MCGOVERN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
to urge President Biden to move quick-
ly and comprehensively to restore U.S.- 
Cuban relations. 
The last 2 years of the Obama admin-
istration saw an explosion of positive 
change in Cuba. The fledgling Cuban 
private sector flourished. Innovation, 
the internet, communications, and po-
litical space expanded. And exchanges 
between our two peoples multiplied. 
Official cooperation advanced signifi-
cantly 
on 
law 
enforcement, 
antinarcotics, migration, human traf-
ficking, and the environment. Dia-
logues began on tough topics like eco-
nomic reform and human rights. 
Tragically, 
these 
advances 
were 
wiped out by President Trump. Today, 
we need strong, levelheaded leadership 
capable of rebuilding trust, navigating 
a return to normal relations, and ad-
vancing U.S. interests. 
We need to immediately end restric-
tions on travel; remittances; financial 
transactions; 
and 
educational, 
sci-
entific, environmental, and cultural 
exchange. 
We must remove Cuba again from the 
state sponsors of terrorism list and re-
scind any sanction that impedes the 
delivery of humanitarian aid. 
Let’s not make the mistake of mov-
ing slowly and incrementally. We need 
to act now. I call on the Biden adminis-
tration to make this a priority. 
f 
SECURE THE SOUTHERN BORDER 
(Mr. ALLEN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, there is an 
undeniable crisis along our southern 
border, and the most recent numbers 
we have received are alarming. 
Last month, there were over 100,000 
illegal immigrants encountered at our 
border. That is a 173 percent increase 
from the same time last year and the 
highest number of encounters in 7 
years. 
From January to February of this 
year, we saw a 163 percent increase of 
family unit encounters, a 61 percent in-
crease in unaccompanied minors, and a 
28 percent increase in encounters over-
all. 
This surge is a direct result of the 
Biden administration’s failure to se-
cure our border and enforce our immi-
gration laws. 
Now we face a humanitarian crisis. 
While the President refuses to ac-
knowledge this dire situation, my 
Democratic colleagues are turning a 
deaf ear by advancing two bills this 
week to grant blanket amnesty to mil-
lions of illegals. Are you kidding me? 
This sends the wrong message that 
our borders are open and that our laws 
don’t 
matter, 
which 
will 
only 
incentivize more illegal immigration. 
It is time to build a wall, end policies 
like catch and release, and oppose mass 
amnesty. We must secure our border. 
f 
DREAMERS MUST BE SUPPORTED 
(Mr. SUOZZI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. SUOZZI. Mr. Speaker, 100 years 
ago, my father was born in a small me-
dieval village in the mountaintops of 
southern Italy. 
He came to America as a young boy, 
and in his St. Dominic’s High School 
senior yearbook, he wrote that his goal 
in life was ‘‘to become a real Amer-
ican.’’ 
Twenty-seven years ago, I served as 
the young mayor of my hometown of 
Glen Cove. I addressed the issue of a 
growing population of new immigrants 
from Central and South America who 
gathered on street corners looking for 
daywork by creating the first day- 
worker site anywhere on the East 
Coast of the United States of America. 
Today, those same men who gathered 
on street corners have their own busi-
nesses, own their own homes, and their 
children went to school with my chil-
dren. 
One Dreamer from El Salvador, who 
graduated high school with my daugh-
ter, went on to graduate from college 
with a degree in biomedical engineer-
ing, got a master’s in biomedical engi-
neering, and is now pursuing a doc-
torate in the same subject. 
Today, I will support the American 
Dream and Promise Act, for Mario, for 
Nelson, and for all the other Dreamers 
whose goal is, like my father’s, to be-
come a real American.

CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF 
FRANK CAGLE 
(Mr. BURCHETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, a few 
weeks ago, Frank Cagle, my close 
friend and a good Libertarian conserv-
ative, passed away after a battle with 
cancer. 
Frank was a brave American who 
served with the 82nd Airborne during 
the Vietnam war. Following his serv-
ice, he attended college and worked for 
newspapers across the South. 
In 1982, Frank came to east Ten-
nessee to work at the Knoxville News 
Sentinel as a copy editor. His passion 
was reporting on State and local poli-
tics. Frank put his commentary into 
action, serving as deputy to Knoxville 
Mayor, Victor Ashe, and working as 
campaign manager on Congressman 
Van Hilleary’s 2002 bid for Governor. 
He later returned to journalism, 
writing columns and analyzing policy 
for Knox TN Today, WATE, and back 
at the Knoxville News Sentinel. Frank

focused his career on delivering unbi-
ased political reporting, and his con-
tributions will leave a long-lasting im-
pression on all of us in east Tennessee. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to celebrate 
Frank’s life and recognize his dedica-
tion to our community on the House 
floor. 
Rest in peace, my good friend. 
f 
FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH 
CENTERS 
(Mr. HIGGINS of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. 
Speaker, federally qualified health cen-
ters are located in neighborhoods, con-
necting to people where they live and 
where families today are struggling. 
Health centers in my western New 
York 
community—Neighborhood 
Health Center, Community Health Cen-
ter of Buffalo and Niagara Falls, Jeri-
cho Road Health Center, and Evergreen 
Health Services—are on the front lines 
in the fight against COVID–19 and the 
ongoing battle to end health dispari-
ties. 
This week, I met with several of 
these health centers, hearing firsthand 
about the role that telehealth, primary 
care, outreach, education have in pro-
viding better health outcomes. 
Today, I am pleased to announce over 
$3.5 million in resources to help Fed-
eral health centers in western New 
York continue to battle the pandemic 
and protect our neighborhoods. This 
funding, provided through the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan, will help support the 
health center workforce and deliver 
testing, treatment, and vaccines to 
help our communities and keep them 
safe. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
AGUILAR). Members are reminded to ob-
serve decorum when speaking before 
the House. 
f 
INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 
RESOLUTION 
(Mr. MCCARTHY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I have 
grave concerns about the current com-
position of the Intelligence Committee. 
The Intel Committee handles our Na-
tion’s highest secrets. It has access to 
information that most Members do not 
see. And unlike standing committees, 
Members of the majority are appointed 
by the Speaker only. 
That is why Members who are ap-
pointed to this important committee 
must possess the highest level of credi-
bility and character, and it is why no 
Member should be compromised in any 
way. 
Unfortunately, information that I 
have seen and that others have seen 
suggests that not all Members meet 
this high standard. So earlier this 
week, I introduced a resolution to re-
store confidence in the Intel Commit-
tee’s ability to safeguard our Nation’s 
secrets. 
Now, I do not take this action lightly 
or for political reasons. Frankly, I am 
surprised that it had to come to this. 
The Speaker and I received the same 
classified briefing from the FBI. The 
details were deeply disturbing. Yet, so 
far, the allegations, which have not 
been denied, have gone unaddressed. 
As the House considers this question, 
I hope all Members will reflect on the 
purpose and responsibilities of the se-
lect panel. I want all Members to ask 
this one question: 
Should a Member who can’t get a se-
curity clearance in the private sector 
sit on the House Intelligence Com-
mittee? 
Think about that for one moment. 
Should a Member who cannot get a 
security clearance in the private sector 
sit on the House Intelligence Com-
mittee? 
The American people deserve to 
know that their government is not vul-
nerable. 
Mr. Speaker, by adopting my resolu-
tion, we will show that we have our pri-
orities straight. I urge my colleagues 
to support it. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, I was so proud to welcome Presi-
dent Joe Biden to our district to see 
firsthand the impact the American 
Rescue Plan will have on our commu-
nity and small businesses in Delaware 
County, Pennsylvania, and to see the 
enthusiasm with which his visit was 
welcomed. 
Together, we visited Smith Flooring, 
a successful, minority-owned small 
business in Chester that provides good 
union jobs and is an economic driver in 
an area that has struggled. The Presi-
dent and I spoke with founders Kristin 
and James Smith about how the 
COVID pandemic has impacted their 
business. The struggling economy has 
meant leaner times, but they are try-
ing to do right by their employees 
until things get moving again. 
The American Rescue Plan has over 
$50 billion in aid for small businesses, 
including over $7 billion for the Pay-
check Protection Program. These funds 
will help small businesses, like Smith 
Flooring, keep up their payroll, protect 
jobs, and keep going until the economy 
is fully open again. 
I wanted President Biden to see up 
close one of the Delco businesses that 
is the backbone of our economy. Thank 
you to Smith Flooring for talking with 
President Biden and me. And equally 
important, I wanted to thank Congress 
and President Biden for bringing re-
newed help and hope to our community 
with the American Rescue Plan. 
NATIONAL RED CROSS MONTH 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize 
March as National Red Cross Month. 
While Red Cross Month has been cele-
brated since 1943, the Red Cross itself 
has been making an impact on commu-
nity health since 1881. 
In 1889, Clara Barton led one of the 
first mobilizations to a national dis-
aster following the Johnstown Flood. 
This site is in the process of being pre-
served today and is known as the Clara 
Barton House. 
Perhaps 
the 
organization’s 
best- 
known program, the American Red 
Cross, established the first nationwide 
civilian blood donation program in the 
1940s. 
According to the organization, some-
one in the United States needs blood 
every 2 seconds. Less than 38 percent of 
the U.S. population is eligible to give 
blood, and only 3 percent of those indi-
viduals donate annually. The critical 
need for blood and the lifesaving poten-
tial that comes with a donation cannot 
be overstated. 
The American Red Cross has always 
been a leader in this effort, and, today, 
they still provide more than 40 percent 
of the blood products in the United 
States. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to encour-
age all healthy Americans to donate 
blood and plasma. In the wake of the 
pandemic, it is needed now more than 
ever. 
f 
IMMIGRATION REFORM 
(Ms. PLASKETT asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, this 
week, House Democrats are building on 
the progress made under the Biden- 
Harris administration to reverse the 
Trump damage and reform our failing 
system by passing two historic and im-
portant bills: 
H.R. 6, the American Dream and 
Promise Act to protect Dreamers, TPS, 
and DED recipients; and the Farm 
Workforce Modernization Act to up-
hold the dignity of workers who feed 
America. 
Americans want solutions on immi-
gration. Voters overwhelmingly sup-
port a path to citizenship, reforms to 
our legal immigration system, smart 
management of our borders. Just like 
with the American Rescue Plan, there 
is strong bipartisan support for immi-
gration reform across the country, just 
not within this body. 
For too long, we have kept our arms 
closed to people who, under similar cir-
cumstances 100 years ago, 30 years ago, 
would have been given a path to citi-
zenship. But now the doors are closed. 
Mr. Speaker, 55,000 Haitians came to 
this country after the earthquakes.

H1506 
March 18, 2021 
They are in limbo. Congress must act, 
and these two overwhelmingly popular, 
commonsense bills would ensure that 
immigrants who make America more 
American can continue to strengthen,

RECOGNIZING REGAN CAPONE 
(Mr. VAN DREW asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. VAN DREW. Mr. Speaker, I am 
here today to recognize an outstanding 
10-year-old girl from Sea Isle City in 
south Jersey. 
Regan Capone is already an engaged 
member of her community and fre-
quently fundraises for local charities. 
Last year, Regan raised over $6,000 for 
the Love of Linda Cancer Benefit Horse 
Show. Regan is now raising money for 
her Uncle Mike’s Seafood Polar Bear 
Run/Walk For Autism. 
Aside from fundraising, Regan is a 
competitive equestrian and competes 
in the English Circuit of South Jersey. 
She even made it to the regionals this 
year. Regan is a dedicated individual 
who impacts the South Jersey commu-
nity every day with her selflessness 
and her desire to raise awareness for 
the causes that are so close to her 
heart. 
Thank you, Regan. You are truly an 
American hero for all that you do. God 
bless you and God bless America. 
f 
IMMIGRATION DIVERSITY AND 
UNITY 
(Mr. TRONE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
TRONE. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
after 
spending most of my life in the busi-
ness world, I have seen firsthand how 
immigrants bring immense contribu-
tions to American business. Whether it 
is a CEO of a Fortune 500 company or 
the frontline worker who has kept our 
workers safe during the COVID–19 pan-
demic, 
immigrant 
workers, 
entre-
preneurs, and leaders drive our econ-
omy. 
Immigrants bring revolutionary new 
ideas to our country. Immigrants cre-
ate jobs. Immigrants inspire innova-
tion that pushes us forward as a coun-
try, keeping us on the cutting edge of 
technology and medical advances. 
As the Speaker often says, ‘‘diversity 
is our strength, unity is our power.’’ 
Immigrants bring their diverse expe-
riences and ideas to our country, to our 
economy, and make it better. Our Na-
tion would be foolish to take them for 
granted. 
f 
HONORING GARY TRUITT 
(Mr. BAIRD asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BAIRD. Mr. Speaker, today, I 
rise to honor the farm broadcaster, 
Gary Truitt. 
Gary was inducted into the National 
Association of Farm Broadcasting Hall 
of Fame for his outstanding work and 
commitment to delivering informative 
and insightful news to our Nation’s 
farmers. 
I offer my congratulations to Gary 
for this remarkable achievement and 
to celebrate his dedicated career. Gary 
began his farm broadcasting career in 
1981, bringing a fresh perspective to the 
industry. And in only a few years, he 
began his own news broadcast, which 
soon dominated Indiana radio. 
In 2006, he did it all over again after 
a corporate sale of his first network, 
and created Hoosier Ag Today. For 
more than 33 years, Hoosier farmers 
have relied on Hoosier Ag Today for 
the latest news about the condition of 
the agricultural industry and markets. 
Mr. Speaker, it is hard to find some-
one who puts his whole heart into ev-
erything that they do. Gary is one of 
them. I wish Gary many more years of 
success.

INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE 
ALLEGATIONS 
(Mr. NADLER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I have 
rarely heard such pernicious nonsense 
as we heard from the minority leader a 
few minutes ago. He accused Mr. 
SWALWELL of having a Chinese spy or 
Chinese agent in his campaign. I under-
stand he has introduced a resolution to 
remove Mr. SWALWELL from his com-
mittee for that purpose. 
The fact is we all have hundreds of 
people in our campaigns—hundreds of 
people. 
Can we vouch for any of them? Do we 
know everybody’s associations? Do we 
know whether someone in the cam-
paign is a spy or a thief, or whatever? 
Do we do a police investigation, an FBI 
investigation of every member of our 
campaigns? 
That is absurd. And I think Mr. 
MCCARTHY ought to be ashamed be-
cause 
he 
is 
an 
experienced 
cam-
paigner—he knows this—for raising 
these spurious allegations.

the House for 1 minute and to revise 
and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, today, I rise to observe the re-
cent, almost simultaneous, passing of 
three 
prominent 
members 
of 
the 
Lumbee Tribe and the citizens of Robe-
son 
County, 
North 
Carolina: 
Mr. 
Lycurous Lowry, Mr. Paul Brooks, Sr., 
and Mr. Wyvis Oxendine. 
These men displayed great fidelity to 
this important community and our 
Ninth 
District 
of 
North 
Carolina 
throughout their lives. 
Mr. Lycurous Lowry dedicated 50 
years of his life to Robeson County, 
serving 41 years as the president of the 
Robeson County Farm Bureau. 
Mr. Paul Brooks, Sr. spent many 
years as a public servant to Robeson 
County, including being elected as the 
fourth chairman of the Lumbee Tribe. 
Mr. Wyvis Oxendine leaves behind 
over 20 years of devotion to his commu-
nity, which includes stints as a county 
commissioner, a magistrate, and an ed-
ucator. 
Mr. Speaker, these three men take 
their leave from us at almost the same 
time and leave behind an indelible im-
pact on our community. I honor them 
for all they have done.

RECOGNIZING BRYCE SINCLAIR 
(Ms. TENNEY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. TENNEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Bryce Sinclair, a 
senior at Maine-Endwell High School 
in New York’s 22nd Congressional Dis-
trict. I am honored to announce that 
Bryce accepted his appointment to join 
the corps of cadets at the United 
States 
Military 
Academy 
at 
West 
Point, New York. 
Bryce was selected among a highly 
competitive pool of applicants from 
around the country. Bryce’s decision to 
attend West Point comes as no surprise 
to those who know him well. He is a 
young leader with exceptional talent 
and potential and is already a dedi-
cated member of our community. 
I wish to congratulate Bryce on this 
tremendous honor. I wish him the best 
as he takes on this venerable challenge 
to serve our community and our Na-
tion in line with the Army’s core val-
ues: loyalty, duty, respect, selfless 
service, honor, and personal courage. 
As the mother of a Naval Academy 
graduate, the service academies hold a 
special place in my heart, especially 
the friendly annual rivalry at the 
Army/Navy game. 
Mr. Speaker, we wish Bryce all the 
best as he moves closer to his next in-
credible step in joining the corps of ca-
dets. Good luck, Bryce. And go Army 
and go Navy.

color is green, but they are the Pella 
Dutch, not the Pella Irish. 
Last Friday, the Pella High School 
Dutch of Marion County, Iowa, success-
fully completed their playoff run by 
winning the 3A Iowa boys basketball 
championship. 
Capping off a terrific 26–2 season with 
a 15–1 conference record, the Dutch 
brought home the State championship 
for the first time in 18 years. 
The achievement of winning a State 
title itself is something of which the 
Dutch team and the Pella community 
should be proud, but these players and 
their families should be even more 
proud of their commitment to the 
game, perseverance, sportsmanship and 
teamwork that guided them through 
this incredible season. 
For the seniors, I hope you continue 
to follow your passions, in basketball 
and elsewhere beyond high school. For 
the juniors and underclassmen, I wish 
you the best of luck in the coming 
years, both on and off the court. 
Mr. Speaker, I am thrilled for this 
team, the coaching staff, fans, and the 
entire Pella community, and I am hon-
ored to represent them in Congress, 
and speak about them on the House 
floor.

withstanding 
subsections

EXTENSIONS
FOR
EXTENUATING
CIR-

tenuating circumstances beyond the alien’s con-
trol, including—

parent, sibling, or child of the alien;

as a matter of discretion, waive the physical 
presence requirement under section 102(b)(1)(A)

alien described in paragraph (1) pending judi-
cial review if such removal is based on criminal 
or national security grounds described in this 
Act. Such removal shall not affect the alien’s 
right to judicial review under this Act. The Sec-
retary shall promptly return a removed alien if

or their respective designees.

NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 6. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself 21⁄2 minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6, the American 
Dream and Promise Act of 2021, is vital 
legislation that establishes a path to 
lawful permanent resident, or LPR, 
status for two critically important 
populations that are in dire need of 
protection. 
The Dream Act creates an earned 
path to LPR status for Dreamers, indi-
viduals who entered the United States 
in their youth and who have lived here 
for most of their lives. Dreamers are 
part of the fabric of our Nation, aptly 
demonstrated by their commitment to 
bettering our country through the pur-
suit of education, military service, and 
employment. 
It is undeniable that Dreamers enrich 
our Nation. They are our neighbors and 
coworkers, they are classmates with 
our children, and they serve in our 
military with distinction. They are an 
essential part of our communities, 
where they contribute to our thriving 
economy and make America a strong-
er, more united, and more diverse Na-
tion. 
Similarly, the American Dream and 
Promise Act provides a path to LPR 
status for individuals who either held, 
or were eligible for temporary protec-
tive status, TPS, as of January 1, 2017; 
or deferred enforced departure, DED, as 
of January 20, 2021. 
TPS is a form of humanitarian relief 
provided to individuals from countries 
experiencing dangerous conditions and 
crises. DED is like TPS, but it is de-
rived solely from the President’s con-
stitutional powers to conduct foreign 
relations. 
Like Dreamers, TPS and DED recipi-
ents are essential to our communities. 
Many of them have lived in the United 
States for decades. They make up a sig-
nificant portion of the workforce in 
key industries, including construction, 
food service, and home healthcare. 
They contribute to the U.S. economy, 
not only through their work, but also 
through consumer spending and tax 
revenue, and they have been particu-
larly essential in serving our country 
during the COVID–19 pandemic. 
I have no doubt that some of my Re-
publican colleagues will stand before 
us today and use what they claim is a 
crisis at the border as an excuse not to 
support this bill. But let’s get one 
thing straight, this legislation is not 
about the border, this legislation is 
about finally delivering on our promise 
to America’s Dreamers and others who 
are equally deserving of our protection. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my col-
leagues, 
LUCILLE
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ, and YVETTE CLARKE, 
for their commitment to this impor-
tant legislation, and to the millions of 
people this legislation will protect. 
I hope that all my colleagues will 
stand up for them when it truly counts 
and will support H.R. 6 today. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1513 
March 18, 2021 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, there is a crisis at the 
border. There has been a crisis at the 
border for weeks. And instead of ad-
dressing the crisis, instead of having a 
hearing in the committee, Democrats 
have passed bills that defund the po-
lice, 
restrict 
Americans’ 
Second 
Amendment liberties, and federalize 
election law. And not one of those 
bills—by the way, not one of those bills 
went through committee. 
In fact, the Judiciary Committee—74 
days of this Congress, the full Judici-
ary Committee has yet to have a hear-
ing on anything. We have asked to 
have a hearing on the border crisis, the 
real crisis. We asked to have a hearing 
on cancel culture, the attack on peo-
ples’ First Amendment liberties. We 
asked 
to 
have 
a 
hearing 
on 
conservatorships. No full committee 
hearing this entire Congress, but they 
can pass bills to defund the police, re-
strict Americans’ Second Amendment 
liberties, Federalize election law. And 
now, while there is a crisis on the bor-
der, they bring a bill to the floor that 
gives amnesty to 3 million illegal 
aliens. 
Seventy-four days of the 117th Con-
gress, the Democrats have taken away 
the Republicans’ right to offer a mo-
tion to recommit; they have kicked 
MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE off a com-
mittee; two Democrats wrote a letter 
trying 
to 
cancel 
‘‘Fox 
News,’’ 
‘‘Newsmax,’’ and ‘‘One America News.’’ 
The Democratic chair of the House Ad-
ministration Committee compiled a 
dossier on 140 Republican Members, 
and they are preparing to steal an elec-
tion from Republican Congresswoman 
MILLER-MEEKS. 
And today, they are going to pass a 
bill—try to pass a bill which, as I said 
before, gives amnesty to 3 million ille-
gal immigrants. We have got gang 
members crossing the border. We have 
got people whose name is on the ter-
rorist watch list crossing the border. 
We have got COVID positive illegals 
crossing the border. 
We have had 100,000 encounters with 
foreigners on the border in February 
alone. Housing illegal immigrants in 
the Dallas Convention Center; the ad-
ministration sending FEMA in to help. 
Even though they refuse to call the cri-
sis a crisis, they are sending in the dis-
aster agency to help with the situa-
tion. If that is not a crisis, frankly, I 
don’t know what one is. 
A crisis that President Trump, 2 
months ago, told us was coming. I want 
to read what President Trump said in 
January. Two months ago, this is what 
President Trump said: ‘‘If our border 
security measures are reversed, it will 
trigger a tidal wave of illegal immigra-
tion, a wave like you’ve never seen be-
fore.’’ Boy was that accurate. 
If our border security measures are 
reversed. What has the Biden adminis-
tration done? They placed a morato-
rium on deportation, they ended the 
Remain in Mexico program, and they 
have stopped building the wall. I think 
that is a reversal. I think that is a re-
versal of the measures that were put in 
place. What did it trigger? A tidal wave 
of illegal immigration, a wave like you 
have never seen before. It sure did. The 
tidal wave is here, and the Democrats’ 
answer is amnesty. Wow. Such a deal 
for the American people. Such a deal 
for the American taxpayer. 
Democrats answer: Defund the police, 
attack Second Amendment liberties of 
Americans, federalize election law, try 
to cancel ‘‘Fox News,’’ ‘‘Newsmax,’’ 
‘‘One America News,’’ compile a dossier 
on Republicans, kick one congress-
woman off of her committees, and try 
to take an election from another, all 
while they are creating a crisis on the 
border, and then respond to it all with, 
what? A bill that gives amnesty to 3 
million illegal immigrants. That is 
what this legislation does today. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope we vote ‘‘no.’’ I 
hope we can stop this legislation. This 
is not what the American people bar-
gained for. This is not common sense, 
and I hope we defeat this measure. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
21⁄2 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tlewoman from California (Ms. ROY-
BAL-ALLARD). 
Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Speaker, 
as a co-author of H.R. 6, I rise in strong 
support of the American Dream and 
Promise Act. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for making 
the American Dream and Promise Act 
one of the top 10 Democratic priorities 
in the 117th Congress. 
I also thank Congresswoman ZOE 
LOFGREN and the Judiciary Immigra-
tion Subcommittee for their invaluable 
hard work on this bill. 
Today, this House has another oppor-
tunity to pass H.R. 6 and, once and for 
all, end the fear and uncertainty that 
have plagued the lives of our Nation’s 
Dreamers, who have become an inte-
gral part of the fabric of American so-
ciety. 
According to the Center for Amer-
ican Progress, each year Dreamers con-
tribute over $17.3 billion in Federal 
taxes, nearly $9.7 billion in State and 
local taxes, and their households have 
$75 billion in buying power. 
Over the course of this deadly corona 
pandemic, an estimated 202,500 DACA 
recipients have risked their lives to 
protect the health and safety of Ameri-
cans. 
Yet, in spite of the critical role they 
play in our society, over 2.1 million 
Dreamers live in a state of limbo, 
doubt, and anxiety of being deported to 
a country most do not know. 
H.R. 6 eliminates the ambiguity in 
their lives and recognizes the talents 
and 
indispensable 
contributions 
Dreamers make to our country. While 
their individual stories may vary, they 
share the common denominator of em-
bracing and exemplifying American 
values and love for this country, the 
only country they call home. 
The American Dream and Promise 
Act has the support of Democrats, Re-
publicans, and Independents, as well as 
businesses, 
organized 
labor, 
faith 
groups, educators, health professionals, 
former cabinet officials, and the major-
ity of the American public. 
This unprecedented coalition of sup-
port highlights that protecting our 
Dreamers and providing them with a 
path to citizenship is not a partisan 
issue. It is an issue about who we are as 
Americans, and what is in the best in-
terest of our country. 
By passing the American Dream and 
Promise Act, we will live up to our 
American values of fairness, justice, 
and compassion. And these incredible 
young Dreamers, like generations of 
immigrants before them, can continue 
to play their vital role in the well- 
being our Nation. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘yes’’ on the American Dream and 
Promise Act today. 
Mr. Speaker, as a co-author of H.R. 6, I rise 
in strong support of the Dream and Promise 
Act. 
I thank Speaker PELOSI for making the 
Dream and Promise Act one of the top ten 
Democratic priorities in the 117th Congress. 
I also thank Congresswoman ZOE LOFGREN 
and the Judiciary Immigration sub-Committee 
for their invaluable hard work on this bill. 
During the last Congress a similar version of 
the Dream Act passed the House with bipar-
tisan support. But unfortunately, the Senate 
failed to take up the bill. 
Today this House has another opportunity to 
pass H.R. 6, and once and for all end the fear 
and uncertainty that has plagued the lives of 
our nations Dreamers who have become an 
integral part of the fabric of our American soci-
ety. 
According to the Center for American 
Progress, each year Dreamers contribute over 
$17.3 billion in federal taxes, nearly $9.7 bil-
lion in state and local taxes, and their house-
holds have $75 billion in buying power. 
During this health emergency they also 
demonstrated the vital role they play in Amer-
ican society. 
Over the course of this deadly Corona pan-
demic, an estimated 202,500 DACA recipients 
have risked their lives to protect the health 
and safety of Americans. 
Dreamers are amongst the essential work-
ers helping to package and stock our food, the 
teachers of our children, and the doctors, 
nurses, and caregivers who daily have sac-
rificed their lives to save the lives of others. 
Yet inspite of the critical role they play in 
our society, over 2.1 million Dreamers live in 
a state of limbo, doubt, and anxiety of being 
deported to a country most do not know. 
H.R. 6 eliminates the ambiguity in their lives 
and recognizes the talents and indispensable 
contributions Dreamers make to our country. 
I have the privilege of representing the 40th 
Congressional district, home to 24,000 Dream-
ers—the largest number in any congressional 
district. 
Since I co-authored the original Dream Act 
twenty years ago, known then as the Student 
Adjustment Act, I have met many of them and 
hundreds more, from all over the country, who 
have traveled to our nation’s capital to tell 
their personal stories of hope, fear, exclusion, 
and heartbreak.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1514 
March 18, 2021 
While their individual stories may vary, they 
share the common denominator of embracing 
and exemplifying American values and love for 
this country, the only country they call home. 
They are American in every way, except on 
paper. 
They are Dreamers like Gabriela Cortes 
who was brought here at age two and will 
graduate in May with a Bachelor of Science 
degree. She says the Dream Act gives her 
hope because quote,’’ This is the only way I 
can fully contribute to my country, the only 
home I know.’’ 
They are Dreamers like Sheila Salinas 
Navarro who is a first year PhD student at 
USC Leonard School of Gerontology. She 
says, quote, ‘‘We need permanent solutions 
so that folks like me can contribute to this na-
tion. All I ask is an opportunity to do so.’’ 
And they are Dreamers like Marvin Perez, 
brought to this country at age five and now at-
tending Glendale Community college. He says 
he wants the opportunity to continue working 
on becoming a physician.’’ 
H.R. 6 will give them and all our Dreamers 
the opportunity to reach their full potential, 
contribute to their community, and help ensure 
America remains the strongest and greatest 
nation in the world. 
The Dream and Promise Act has the sup-
port of Democrats, Republicans, and Inde-
pendents, as well as businesses, organized 
labor, faith groups, educators, health profes-
sionals, former Cabinet officials, and majority 
of the American public. 
This unprecedented coalition of support 
highlights that protecting our Dreamers and 
providing them with a path to citizenship is not 
a partisan issue. 
It is an issue about who we are as Ameri-
cans and what is in the best interest of our 
country. 
By passing the Dream and Promise Act, we 
will live up to our American values of fairness, 
justice, and compassion. And these incredible 
young Dreamers like generations of immi-
grants before them, can continue to play their 
vital role in the well-being of our nation. 
I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the 
Dream and Promise Act today. 
b 1245 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), who is the 
ranking member on the Immigration 
and Citizenship Subcommittee. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, last 
year, we finally achieved operational 
control of our southern border for the 
first time in decades. The Trump ad-
ministration had made it clear that 
our border would be enforced, and ille-
gal immigration dropped dramatically. 
That all ended on January 20, when 
Joe Biden issued executive orders to 
stop 
deporting 
illegal 
immigrants, 
abandon the border wall, admit anyone 
claiming to be under 18, and rescinding 
the Remain in Mexico policy for asy-
lum claims. That message has been 
heard loud and clear. 
The Border Patrol reported more 
than 100,000 encounters in February 
alone. Think about that. That is the 
entire population of South Bend, Indi-
ana, or Green Bay, Wisconsin, in a sin-
gle month, and it is getting worse. 
We are way beyond the debate over 
whether this is a border crisis. The 
question now is whether we have a bor-
der at all. 
What is the Democrats’ response? 
This bill promises a path to citizenship 
not only for 700,000 DACA recipients 
but millions more who illegally arrived 
prior to January 1, were under 19 when 
they arrived, and have only committed 
two misdemeanors. 
How do they prove they qualify, Mr. 
Speaker? Under this bill, it means hav-
ing a friend vouch for you. 
Now, we all sympathize with those il-
legally brought here as young children 
years ago, and more than 200 Repub-
licans supported legislation in the 
115th Congress to give them legal sta-
tus. But it included measures that se-
cured our border and enforced our laws 
to discourage another generation of 
young people being brought here ex-
actly as we are seeing unfold today. 
Why are so many children being 
placed in the hands of Mexican crimi-
nal cartels and forced to suffer the 
2,000-mile trail of terror to our border? 
Because it works. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill proves the 
Mexican crime cartels are right: You 
will be admitted into our country and 
need only wait for the next amnesty. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the distinguished gentle-
woman from California (Ms. LOFGREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, imagine 
this: You are 17 years old. You have 
worked hard, and you are the valedic-
torian of your high school class, the 
quarterback on the football team. You 
go down to apply for your driver’s li-
cense, and you find out for the first 
time that you were actually not born 
in the United States and that you are 
undocumented. 
There is no possibility for you to get 
right with the law, but you did nothing 
wrong. You don’t even remember the 
place that you were born. 
That is the circumstance that tens of 
thousands of young people find them-
selves in, and this bill allows those 
young people to get right with the 
law—they have done nothing wrong— 
and go on to become the full Americans 
that they are except for their paper-
work. 
It does something else that is impor-
tant, which is it recognizes that there 
is a group of people who are here under 
visas, but because the Senate messed 
up—that is a term of art—the per coun-
try cap bill that this House passed by 
365 votes in the last Congress, there is 
a huge backlog from large countries so 
long that the dependents of lawful tem-
porary visa holders age out. They have 
no remedy, just as the other Dreamers. 
They can’t go back to the country they 
were born in because their parents are 
legally here. They have no capacity to 
become the full Americans that they 
are. This also resolves that problem. 
It is distressing to hear the rhetoric 
about the border. In fact, the uptick at 
the southern border began last April, 
and it relates to hurricanes and dis-
order in three Central American coun-
tries. 
We need to pay attention to what is 
going on in those three countries, and 
that is something the Biden adminis-
tration is taking steps to do to solve 
that problem where it starts. I will just 
note that nobody is escaping from 
Costa Rica. It is the disorder in three 
countries that needs to be resolved. 
Mr. Speaker, vote ‘‘yes’’ on this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ari-
zona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, as we see 
the ongoing impacts of Biden’s inhu-
mane border crisis, I rise in opposition 
to H.R. 6. 
Mr. Speaker, it is irresponsible to be 
considering this bill today. This bill 
provides amnesty to millions of those 
who are illegally in this country. This 
promise of amnesty is a magnet for 
aliens attempting to enter the United 
States today. For at least 35 years, we 
have seen a direct correlation between 
promises of amnesty and an increase in 
illegal border crossing. 
The ongoing Biden inhumane border 
crisis is a direct result of then-can-
didate 
and 
now-President 
Biden’s 
flawed border policies, including am-
nesty. That is why I reintroduced the 
Fund and Complete the Border Wall 
Act earlier this year and introduced 
the Stopping Border Surges Act earlier 
this week. 
These bills include real reforms that 
will have real impacts. Specifically, 
the Stopping Border Surges Act fixes 
problems caused by the Flores settle-
ment agreement that prevent DHS 
from detaining family units for more 
than 20 days, ensures that unaccom-
panied alien children are quickly and 
safely returned to their homes, and 
promotes increased integrity in the 
asylum system. 
H.R. 6 will cause more problems than 
it will solve. It has serious flaws that 
lead to fraud and abuse. 
This bill gives the Secretary broad 
authority to waive grounds of inadmis-
sibility for humanitarian 
purposes, 
family unity, or because the waiver is 
otherwise in the public interest. That 
means that, under this bill, even con-
victed criminals will be eligible for am-
nesty. 
If that is not bad enough, under this 
bill, aliens who were removed from the 
country by DHS will be allowed to re-
turn and get amnesty. Let me repeat 
that: Aliens who were ordered removed 
by an immigration judge after receiv-
ing due process and were actually re-
moved will be allowed to return and 
get amnesty. 
Last year, USCIS, the agency that 
administers this amnesty program, al-
most had to furlough 70 percent of its 
workforce because the fees it collects 
do not cover the costs of adjudicating 
immigration benefits. But this bill ac-
tually sets the amnesty fee arbitrarily 
low and will allow most aliens to ob-
tain a fee waiver. That is a recipe for 
disaster.

H1515 
March 18, 2021 
This bill prohibits information from 
being shared with ICE so that our im-
migration laws cannot be enforced. In-
stead of prohibiting information shar-
ing, we should require information 
sharing. 
This bill does nothing to secure the 
border or close loopholes in our immi-
gration laws that encourage illegal im-
migration. 
Mr. Speaker, I oppose this bill, and I 
encourage my colleagues to do the 
same. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman 
from 
Washington 
(Ms. 
JAYAPAL). 
Ms. JAYAPAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act. 
As an immigrant myself who came to 
America alone at the age of 16 and who 
spent a decade in the immigrant rights 
movement before coming to Congress, I 
stand with the Dreamers and TPS and 
DED recipients who have courageously 
proclaimed 
‘‘undocumented 
and 
unafraid’’ in the streets and Halls of 
Congress and built this movement for 
justice. 
These Dreamers, TPS, and DED hold-
ers have lived in the shadows for too 
long, doing our Nation’s essential work 
while living a life of uncertainty and 
fear every day. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
Congress—we—right 
here and right now can change that. 
We can stand up for our 4.4 million es-
sential community members who have 
made the United States home. We can 
legislate what they deserve, which is a 
roadmap to citizenship and a future of 
hope, opportunity, and contribution. 
Let’s stop the hypocrisy of criminal-
izing immigrants. Let’s give recogni-
tion and hope today. Vote ‘‘aye’’ on the 
American Dream and Promise Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Texas 
(Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman from Ohio for yielding me 
time. 
Mr. Speaker, a couple of nights ago, 
I was in Laredo, Texas, doing an inter-
view while overlooking the Rio Grande. 
My interview was interrupted by a 
stream of human smugglers and people 
shouting ‘‘run for the ladders, run for 
the fences’’ coming from the water. 
Then, some went back across the river. 
I went over to a facility where chil-
dren are being housed right now. They 
are the people being smuggled by car-
tels for profit. That is happening right 
now today. While we sit in here and de-
bate this bill, it is happening right 
now. 
A child is being abused right now by 
cartels. And this body, the ‘‘people’s 
House,’’ is doing nothing—nothing—to 
address cartels that have ownership of 
our borders right now. 
We are not doing our job. A secure 
border is pro-immigrant. Instead, what 
we are doing today is we are going to 
pass legislation that is a magnet for 
more trafficking of children. We are 
going to pass legislation today that 
empowers cartels. We are going to pass 
legislation today that is a Band-Aid on 
a broken system because this body re-
fuses to do its constitutional duty to 
secure 
the 
borders 
of 
the 
United 
States. That is what we are going to do 
today. 
Meanwhile, nothing is going to im-
prove the life of the little girl sitting 
in Nuevo Laredo right now being 
abused under the hands of CDN for the 
$3,000 or $7,000 to move that little girl 
across the river while Border Patrol 
doesn’t have the resources to secure 
the border. 
I was down on the river with the guy 
who is on a 3-mile stretch of the bor-
der—one guy—and he can do nothing 
about that flow while narcotics and 
fentanyl come across our border. 
So, pat ourselves on the back today, 
Mr. Speaker, for a bill that is going to 
get passed and headline speeches given 
about how all this is so great for immi-
grants. Meanwhile, immigrants today 
are getting raped, abused, beaten, sold 
into indentured slavery, and put into 
human sex trafficking because we 
refuse to secure the border of the 
United States. And we will never get a 
chance to offer an amendment on the 
floor of this body to do anything about 
it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, let us remember that 
the United States Senate in 2013, with 
14 Republicans and the balance of 
Democrats, well over 60 people, voted 
for comprehensive immigration reform, 
as I recall, and, perhaps the chairman 
can correct me, I believe $47 billion for 
security. Maybe the staff can shake 
their head if that was the right num-
ber. It was a very substantial number; 
it might not be the exact number. 
On this side of the aisle, we pleaded 
with the majority to bring a com-
prehensive immigration bill to the 
floor. They were in charge. They could 
have brought whatever security that 
they wanted. They could have brought 
comprehensive immigration reform to 
the floor. 
The bills that were brought to the 
floor bore no relationship, with all due 
respect, to the Senate-passed bipar-
tisan bill, so we did not achieve com-
prehensive immigration reform. There 
was no conference; there was no back- 
and-forth; and there was no response to 
that bipartisan bill. 
So, I tell my friend from Texas, yes, 
there is a problem. There is a problem 
in trafficking, and we need to deal with 
it. 
But I also tell this House that what 
it ought to know is that the immigra-
tion system is broken. I wait for some-
body to arise and say: No, it is fine. 
Nobody believes it is fine, Mr. Speak-
er. These bills are not comprehensive 
immigration reform, but they are sup-
ported by the American people because 
they know that Dreamers, TPS, and 
DED are adding to this country’s value. 
Mr. Speaker, for 135 years, America’s 
bright beacon to the world has been 
that statue that stands in New York 
Harbor. It lifts her lamp beside the 
golden door for those who are yearning 
to breathe free. 
My father came through that door. 
He was 32 years of age in 1934. He came 
from Denmark. He came for the reason 
most come, not fleeing, however, from 
a dangerous land, as some are now 
doing, but looking for opportunity and 
a better life. They have come through-
out our history from every corner of 
the world, braving hardship and seek-
ing opportunity, arriving here to build 
businesses, raise families, and con-
tribute to strengthening communities. 
Dreamers have done that. They did 
not come at their insistence. They 
came at their parents’ insistence or 
somebody else’s insistence, but they 
are here, and they know America as 
their home. 
Immigrants are a reason why Amer-
ica became the world’s most powerful 
and most prosperous country. For 
years now, however, our immigration 
and visa system has been terribly bro-
ken, so much so that millions in this 
country live in fear, holding their 
breath every day that they could be de-
ported to faraway lands that are not 
their homes because America is their 
home. 
b 1300 
For Dreamers, it has been their home 
since their earliest days. And, today, 
this House is going to take action, as 
we did last Congress, to help them 
breathe easier. 
The minority leader and I were meet-
ing at the White House some years ago, 
and then-President Trump said: If you 
send me a Dreamers bill, I will sign it. 
Well, we never sent it. The minority 
leader and I negotiated, along with 
others—the administration and Sen-
ator DURBIN, the minority leader, and 
Senator CORNYN. We didn’t get there, 
sadly. 
This bill will correct a wrong that 
has brought fear and uncertainty to so 
many 
Americans. 
Yes, 
Americans. 
America is their home and their coun-
try. We are talking about patriotic and 
law-abiding residents, many of whom 
have been here for decades and are 
working to build a strong community 
and serving on the front lines of this 
pandemic as healthcare professionals, 
first responders, and essential workers. 
We owe them the chance to live with-
out fear of deportation and family sep-
aration. There are other problems we 
ought to talk about and we have talked 
about. But, certainly, these Dreamers 
and those with TPS who have been 
here for a long period of time, and 
DED, this bill is just for them. 
When I say ‘‘just,’’ I don’t mean sole-
ly. I mean justice. 
We passed the American Dream and 
Promise Act last Congress with bipar-
tisan support, and I hope we can do the 
same today.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1516 
March 18, 2021 
I want to thank Representative ROY-
BAL-ALLARD for her leadership on H.R. 
6, and all of those in the Congressional 
Hispanic Caucus, and yourself, Mr. 
Speaker, for the extraordinary work 
you have done. 
We are also voting, of course, today 
on another immigration bill this week, 
H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act. I rise in support of that 
as well. 
This legislation, offered by Chair-
woman LOFGREN, provides a pathway 
to permanent legal residency to un-
documented agricultural workers and 
their families who are living here and 
filling a critical economic need from 
which we benefit, every one of us, 
every day; and that is the food on our 
table. 
Without that change, workers and 
their employers will continue to oper-
ate under a cloud of uncertainty and 
instability. These reforms are long 
overdue, and I want to thank Chair-
woman LOFGREN for her work to bring 
them to the floor. 
I hope, as part of broader immigra-
tion reform efforts, that we can address 
the status of seasonal non-agricultural 
workers on H–2B, who contribute so 
much to our economy and communities 
working in landscaping, hospitality, 
and, in my own State of Maryland, the 
crab industry. 
After the House passes this legisla-
tion and H.R. 6, I hope the Senate will 
move quickly to send them to Presi-
dent Biden for his signature. 
The Dream and Promise Act, some 75 
percent of Americans are for that. We 
have been passing legislation that an 
overwhelming majority of Americans 
are for, and somehow, the Senate 
didn’t get it or didn’t care. Hopefully, 
this year they will. 
If enacted, these two bills would pro-
vide a pathway to permanent legal sta-
tus for some 3 million to 4 million peo-
ple. They are here. They are among us. 
They help us. They work with us. They 
pay taxes. Let’s bring them out from 
under the cloud of being kicked out. 
This legislation today is a major 
achievement and will hasten the mo-
ment when 3 million to 4 million immi-
grants and their families can breathe a 
little easier, a little freer, knowing 
they are welcomed and valued here in 
America, that they are truly a part of 
this country. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support both of these pieces of legisla-
tion. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I would 
just point out that the majority leader 
is not accurate in what he said. Repub-
licans, 2 years ago, had bills that were 
much more comprehensive than what 
the Democrats are bringing to the floor 
this week. We had a bill that dealt with 
merit-based 
immigration, 
E-Verify, 
added workers to enforcement border 
security. It is just not accurate to say 
our plan was not comprehensive. We 
had two bills, as the Republican leader 
mentioned. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCARTHY), the Republican leader. 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the Republican leader of the Ju-
diciary for yielding. He is correct that 
when the Republicans were in the ma-
jority, they brought two bills to the 
floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I would like to remind 
the gentleman and others, and even the 
majority leader, that not one Demo-
crat voted for either of those bills. Not 
one Democrat voted for a bill to move 
to the Senate. They actually denied 
the bill from going to the Senate, even 
if you wanted to change it to become 
law. That is just a little truth in his-
tory. 
Mr. Speaker, I am going to say some-
thing that President Biden refuses to 
say. There is a crisis on our southern 
border. It is a humanitarian crisis. It is 
a public health crisis, a national secu-
rity crisis. It is a Biden border crisis, 
and it is spiraling out of control with 
no signs of ending. 
When candidate Biden told migrants 
in June to immediately surge to the 
border, I knew his immigration policies 
would be bad. But I did not think it 
would be this bad. I did not think that 
would mean 13,000 unaccompanied mi-
nors in U.S. custody. 
I did not think it would mean moving 
them from border facilities across the 
country: 1,000 of them went to Midland 
Texas; 3,000 to Dallas; and, likely, to 
more cities tomorrow. 
I did not think the Biden administra-
tion would require COVID tests for 
American citizens entering the coun-
try, but not for illegal immigrants. 
I did not think Biden’s own DHS Sec-
retary would have to admit that we are 
‘‘on pace to encounter more individuals 
on the southwest border than we have 
in the last 20 years,’’ Mr. Speaker. 
I did not think I would hear the 
President of Mexico refer to our Presi-
dent Joe Biden as the ‘‘migrant Presi-
dent.’’ 
And I did not think it would only 
take 2 months to create the worst bor-
der crisis in the history of America. 
But, 
unfortunately, 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
that is exactly what happened. When I 
visited the border on Monday, one 
thing was abundantly clear: This crisis 
started at midnight on January 20. 
Mr. Speaker, it started when Presi-
dent Biden stopped building the wall, 
even though there are only a few miles 
left to complete. When he made that 
decision, he had to pay more money to 
the contractors to break the contract. 
It started when he promised to make 
all 11 million illegal immigrants citi-
zens. 
Now, my colleague from Florida (Mr. 
GIMENEZ) spoke with a family from 
Honduras about their journey to the 
border. He asked them how long the 
trek was. They said it was 22 days. The 
story of this family is a story we have 
heard from many and it is not unique. 
You see, thousands decided to cross 
the border now because of President 
Biden’s promises and policies. They lis-
tened to him in June when he said: You 
need to surge the border. 
As one migrant family recently told 
FOX News: Yes, I listened to the news 
that they were letting people in. 
When I was there Monday, I was 
speaking to the border agents, the 
American citizens, and the migrants. 
The number one thing was clear: the 
crisis at the border is the worst they 
have ever seen. 
When we went to El Paso, we toured 
the new processing facility. We built it 
under the last administration. It is 
huge, 98,000 square feet. And when I 
asked the chief patrol agent, Chief 
Chavez said: We built it so large with 
capacity, we didn’t believe it could 
ever meet capacity. 
But that day we marked history. 
That day they hit capacity: 1,040 peo-
ple, mostly children unaccompanied. 
You know what it meant when you 
hit capacity? 
That meant 120 border agents got 
pulled off the border to protect us to go 
into the center. That is what a crisis 
looks like, even if the administration 
won’t say it. 
We also saw overworked Border Pa-
trol agents in the El Paso facility. Mr. 
Speaker, I want to thank them. What 
they are being asked to do is extraor-
dinary: the pressure on them, the pres-
sure from the administration not to 
allow press to see what is happening; 
the pressure of being over capacity 
with the number of people there; the 
pressure to do it under a pandemic. 
That is what a crisis looks like. 
When we sat and talked to the doctor 
from the medical unit, he told us that 
approximately 10 percent of every im-
migrant has COVID, but they are not 
tested. You see, that is only for Amer-
ican citizens when they reenter. But 
they are not tested and they are sent 
to other cities. 
And, as many of you know here, you 
could be tested and you are positive, 
but the person you have been standing 
around, put into one unit for a number 
of days, sleeping very close next to, 
after you have interacted the entire 
time in one unit, a closed unit, that 
you will become positive in the next 5 
days. But that is okay because you will 
be shipped to another city. But that 
city has been trying to combat this 
pandemic. Who knows what happens 
next. 
And the most alarming, Mr. Speaker, 
was when we were briefed in Monument 
Three in El Paso. They told us that 
they caught people on the terrorist 
watch list. I know that the Speaker 
would be concerned about that. I was 
alarmed. I questioned further. It is not 
just people on the terrorist watch list. 
We found people from other nations, 
from Iran, from Turkey. 
Mr. Speaker, when I went to the 
press conference right after that, I 
mentioned that because I think every 
American—one terrorist is too much in 
this Nation that could get through. I 
believe, Mr. Speaker, that you believe 
that, too. 
But

he also represents a border State—I 
thought he would tweet arm-in-arm to 
stop this. 
But you know what the gentleman 
said, Mr. Speaker? 
He tweeted on Monday that I was 
‘‘either lying or I was wrong’’ because 
he hadn’t heard anything about it. I be-
lieve he even challenged me because he 
had such high clearance because he is 
on Intel. 
And Congresswoman ESCOBAR, who 
represents part of El Paso, I thought 
the gentlewoman would be very con-
cerned, too, because this is where they 
are entering, where they caught these 
people on a terrorist watch list. Not ev-
erybody gets put on one. Mr. Speaker, 
what she said was that I was trying to 
‘‘fuel the division’’ because I just said 
that a terrorist was caught coming 
through. 
But, on Tuesday, Axios confirmed 
that four people matching terrorist 
watch lists were arrested at the border, 
three from Yemen and one from Serbia. 
Biden’s DHS Secretary also con-
firmed that this indeed happened. I am 
not sure if their Twitter account is 
down or if they have been blocked, but 
I have not heard an apology or a cor-
rection. I know Twitter does that to 
Members of Congress, but I hope they 
are back on and I will soon get the 
apology or the acknowledgment of a 
correction and the respect. 
If Members with security clearance 
haven’t 
heard 
about 
the 
terrorist 
threats on the border, I suggest they 
pay closer attention to the classified 
briefings. 
Mr. Speaker, the responsibility for 
this crisis rests squarely on the shoul-
ders of President Biden. After weeks of 
claiming they could handle it, his ad-
ministration is now attempting to 
blame the growing crisis on the pre-
vious President. But nothing could be 
further from the truth. Words and ac-
tions have meanings, and Biden has 
sent the message that our border is 
open. 
So there is no question that Presi-
dent Biden provoked the problem. The 
question is: How can we stop it? 
Mr. Speaker, when I was there in El 
Paso, 150 miles of the wall was sup-
posed to be built. But at midnight on 
January 20, 133 miles had been finished. 
Instead of finishing the project, they 
stopped. You could go to the ranch 
where they took down the old barrier 
because they were going to put up the 
new wall, and there is nothing there. It 
is not just people coming across ille-
gally, but animals move back and 
forth. 
So far, the Biden administration con-
gressional Democrats aren’t providing 
any solutions. Mr. Speaker, we want to 
solve this problem. That is why I sent 
a letter to the President 2 weeks ago to 
sit down. When the President said im-
migrants should surge to the border, 
we understood what he meant. So all 
those who were seeking asylum auto-
matically got in, COVID or not, no 
tests required. 
b 1315 
We saw that the Biden administra-
tion told migrants: We aren’t saying 
don’t come; just don’t come now. You 
see, that was from the Secretary. 
Those are really strong words. 
But, Mr. Speaker, what moved me 
the most was speaking to border 
agents, one who was a father, and one 
that was a mother, talking about the 
unaccompanied children. He told me a 
story of coming upon children, a one- 
year-old, a three-year-old, and a five- 
year-old all holding hands. No one in 
sight for miles away. It is remarkable 
that they got there. 
But the question is: How many didn’t 
make it? How many lives have been 
lost or abused, simply because they 
heard a message, or you stopped the 
PACR program, or you changed from 
‘‘remain in Mexico,’’ or you stopped 
finishing the wall that was almost 
complete? 
Mr. Speaker, those who defend the 
border told me that they have never 
seen so much fentanyl as they have in 
the last month. They have never seen 
the tactics that were used of storming 
the wall all at once. Just in this one 
small section, if you looked—it would 
just go a number of blocks—100 to 200 
people a night are apprehended. 
We saw last week, with the Demo-
crat’s so-called COVID relief bill, $22 
billion in healthcare subsidies that il-
legal immigrants are eligible for, an-
other clear message. But zero dollars 
are dedicated to helping the men and 
women patrolling the border. 
Mr. Speaker, they need the help. 
They are stretched so thin. They are 
stretched so thin, in the middle of 
COVID, where they are dealing with 
something where they are not even 
testing for COVID but they have to 
interact. 
This new facility, 98,000 square feet, 
is a beautiful facility. It has already 
met capacity for the first time in his-
tory with the new administration. But 
if you look across into the parking lot, 
the dirt parking lot, where the border 
agents have to park, they were moving 
their cars. They had to put up tents, 
because the surge is so great. You see, 
they listened to the words of candidate 
Biden and they watched the actions of 
President Biden. 
But there is no new money. I know 
that COVID bill was the—well, we 
shouldn’t call it COVID. It is less than 
9 percent for COVID. But, Mr. Speaker, 
do you realize in that bill, prisoners 
will get more money than the Border 
Patrol? Do you realize that they are 
going to have to use their own oper-
ation money that is stretched so thin? 
So not only can the Border Patrol not 
be on the border, now they are taking 
any money for the future to deal with 
the surge today. 
The American people deserve leaders 
who will work with the seriousness of 
purpose, what this crisis requires. That 
is why I wrote a letter to President 
Biden 2 weeks ago asking to meet 
about the crisis. Since then, the crisis 
has only gotten worse, but, unfortu-
nately, the President still hasn’t re-
sponded. Today, I sent President Biden 
a second letter offering to relay what 
we learned at the border, since he re-
fuses to go there. But I believe he 
would benefit from a hearing of what 
we saw and heard. 
Mr. Speaker, if the President won’t 
go there and the President puts orders 
to deny the press from learning so the 
American people can’t know, I think it 
would behoove him to hear from the 
people who are there. 
I also introduced five solutions based 
on the information from our trip. All of 
them are rooted in the basic idea that 
we are both a Nation of immigrants 
and a Nation of laws. 
Mr. Speaker, I know you are proud of 
your heritage, and I am proud of mine, 
like every single American. I know how 
many of us come from immigrant fami-
lies. I know when you walk into my of-
fice, where you have been, Mr. Speaker, 
you look on my wall and you will see 
the documents from Ellis Island. April 
23 of this year will mark the 100th an-
niversary of my grandfather, Guido 
Palladino, coming from Italy as a 
young child, boarding a ship to come 
here for a better life. 
You see, America believes in immi-
gration, but there is no time to break 
the law and come illegally. There is a 
process to come here. 
If we implement now these common-
sense solutions, it will help to stop the 
border crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, as I said earlier, the 
Biden border crisis is a humanitarian, 
health, and national security crisis, 
and it is deteriorating quickly. 
To protect our citizens from further 
harm, our Government must send a 
clear and united message to the citi-
zens of Mexico and Central America. 
That message is simple: There is never 
a right time to break the law and enter 
the United States illegally. 
The time for delay, denial, and dis-
traction is over. 
Mr. Speaker, I know you care about 
this issue. I know you care about what 
is happening at the border. Mr. Speak-
er, I ask you, convey that to the Presi-
dent. If he cares as much as you, he 
will travel there. I know it is tough to 
travel, but when you have Air Force 
One—and I know he has got a sched-
ule—it is not far to fly to the border. 
His own Secretary has said this is the 
worst it has been in 20 years. 
Mr. Speaker, there is not one law 
that has passed here that created that 
crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, to all your constituents 
and all of those in America, there are 
terrorists who have been caught; there 
are children walking in the desert by 
themselves; there are cartels making a 
fortune 
off 
the 
parts 
and 
disadvantaging of America. 
We are in the middle of a pandemic 
where people are not being tested but 
shipped to other cities. This isn’t polit-
ical, Mr. Speaker. This is about this 
Nation. Join with us on our letter. 
Let’s solve this problem together.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1518 
March 18, 2021 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
11⁄4 minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Mr. Speaker, we are 
here today to talk about our Dreamers, 
the precious resource we have in our 
country. But, of course, unfortunately, 
what we are hearing is as much fear- 
mongering as possible from our Repub-
lican colleagues about immigrants. 
My name was mentioned, and the mi-
nority leader chose to come into my 
safe and secure community earlier this 
week to use my community as a prop, 
so I need to respond. 
In 2019, Mr. Speaker, I led codels to 
El Paso and brought nearly 20 percent 
of Congress to my community. I in-
vited everyone. I stood in the well and 
invited Republicans, Democrats, every-
one. Only Democrats took me up on my 
offer to see the entire picture. Not just 
law enforcement, but to meet with ad-
vocates, 
attorneys, 
everyone 
who 
makes up the system of immigration 
on the border. Not a single Republican 
attended. 
Last session, we, as a Congress, 
passed a number of bills, including sup-
plemental bills, to address what was 
happening on the border and to address 
immigration. 
No 
Republicans 
sup-
ported our effort. 
Last week, when I learned the minor-
ity leader was coming into my commu-
nity, I sent him a letter, invited him to 
meet with everyone who was available 
to help give him the full picture. He re-
fused. 
Their strategy is the same strategy 
they have employed with COVID: Do 
nothing. 
We will finally address this. I rise to 
support our Dreamers and H.R. 6. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 
Dreamers across the country. These are 
young people who have lived in the United 
States for the majority of their lives; they al-
ready call the United States home and are citi-
zens in all but name. 
The Dream and Promise Act creates a path 
to citizenship for those who were brought to 
the United States as children. They’re people 
who have lived their entire lives as members 
of our communities and just want the oppor-
tunity to become citizens of the country where 
they grew up, go to school, and work. Which 
makes our communities safer and stronger. 
This bill provides strict guidance for earning 
citizenship and recipients are required to meet 
the standards and specifications of the pro-
gram in order to maintain their status. 
When a parent makes the harrowing deci-
sion to take their child and leave their home 
behind, it’s so that their child might have a 
better life. Like a lot of our grandparents and 
great-grandparents, they’re coming to the 
United States for the opportunity to live the 
American Dream. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I will just 
point out, I was at the border 2 years 
ago, the Rio Grande; Mr. ROY was at 
the border last week; Mr. MCCARTHY 
was at the border this week. The pre-
vious speaker, Mr. Speaker, said that 
Republicans didn’t come when she in-
vited. We have all been down there and 
seen what goes on. Just this week, we 
have been down there to see the cur-
rent crisis. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the 
gentleman 
from 
Wisconsin 
(Mr. 
GROTHMAN). 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, we 
take up this bill at a time when almost 
three times as many people are cross-
ing the border as were this time last 
year. 
Under President Obama, it was a bad 
day if we had 1,000 contacts at the bor-
der. Now, we are having 3,000 contacts 
a day. 
These bills are being introduced, ad-
vertising that people who come here le-
gally are suckers, and we are going to 
give preference to people who didn’t 
come here legally. 
I would further like to ask that we 
delay the vote until the Biden adminis-
tration removes the muzzling of the 
Border Patrol. We do not really know 
what is going on at the border, when 
this most opaque of administrations 
tells the Border Patrol that they can-
not tell the press or Congressmen what 
is going on. 
James Madison must be spinning in 
his grave. He gave the press freedom, 
and they refuse to use it. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Rhode 
Island (Mr. CICILLINE). 
Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, Dream-
ers are American citizens in every 
sense of the word. For most, America is 
the only home they have ever known. 
Despite what my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle argue, Dreamers 
are not a drain on the country. 
Dreamers contribute to our economy 
by adding an estimated $42 billion to 
the GDP every year. That is six times 
more than the cost of DACA. 
They participate in our workforce, 
own small businesses, create jobs, pay 
taxes, and spend billions of dollars 
every year on goods and services. Most 
importantly, they enrich our lives and 
are valued members of our commu-
nities. 
When the pandemic hit, over 62,000 
Dreamers stepped up and provided life-
saving healthcare to all of us. Now, it 
is our turn to look out for our neigh-
bors, our coworkers, and our friends. 
They have earned the right to call 
America home. 
H.R. 6 provides a path to citizenship 
for Dreamers as well as temporary pro-
tected status and deferred enforced de-
parture recipients. 
I urge my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes.’’ 
There is nothing more American than 
the Dream Act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 11⁄2 
minutes to the gentlewoman from 
Texas (Ms. VAN DUYNE). 
Ms. VAN DUYNE. Mr. Speaker, the 
crisis at the border is astounding in its 
scale, as thousands of illegal immi-
grants, enabled by drug cartels and 
human traffickers, enter the country 
on a daily basis, many of them unac-
companied 
minors, 
untested 
for 
COVID–19. Yet our colleagues across 
the aisle accuse us of using this crisis 
at the border as an excuse. Context 
matters 
and 
policies 
have 
con-
sequences. 
This is a surge at levels we have 
never seen before, and it is a direct re-
action to the Biden administration dis-
pensing with numerous measures which 
protected our southern border. 
Yet, it is another day of political the-
ater today on the House floor and an-
other set of bills without any real de-
bate. 
In addition to the lackluster effort 
here in Congress, our President needs 
to enforce our laws. I and 20 of my col-
leagues from Texas recently urged the 
Texas Attorney General to hold the 
President’s feet to the fire and enforce 
the laws, such as Title 42. 
The President can use whatever lan-
guage he wants to to describe what is 
happening on our southern border, but 
his reckless policies are creating a dis-
astrous situation for Texans, putting 
our health and safety in grave jeop-
ardy. 
Today could have been an oppor-
tunity for real debate and to send a 
message that this manufactured crisis 
needs to stop and make true reforms to 
our immigration system, yet that 
could not be further from the truth. 
It is obvious we have a broken immi-
gration system, but Democrats’ fla-
grant disregard of laws to appease the 
far left is dangerous and out of touch 
with the challenges real Americans are 
facing right now. Ignoring laws, such 
as Title 42, denying a border crisis, 
that is not leadership, and Texans 
know better than to take that sitting 
down. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 45 
seconds to the gentleman from Colo-
rado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I had pre-
pared remarks, but I cannot let the mi-
nority leader’s remarks go unanswered. 
Some of my colleagues are aware of 
this. I was born in Minority Leader 
MCCARTHY’s district, in Bakersfield, 
California. My parents came to this 
country 40 years ago as refugees. Be-
cause of the incredible freedoms and 
opportunities that our wonderful coun-
try has to offer, we have been able to 
live the American Dream. How dare he 
denigrate a majority that is working to 
ensure that that dream remains secure 
for thousands of Dreamers. 
In his district, in my district, across 
the United States, young people who 
live in fear, young people who have 
known no other country but the United 
States as their home, that is what this 
bill is about. 
Let’s pass H.R. 6. Let’s ensure that 
these Dreamers are treated the way 
they should be, as Americans. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand before you as the son 
of refugees. My parents came to this country 
nearly 40 years ago in search of the American 
Dream. Their ability to offer my sister and I 
countless freedoms and opportunities and the 
fact that just one generation removed I can 
stand in this chamber as a member of Con-
gress, is powerful proof that that dream still 
exists.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1519 
March 18, 2021 
It is our duty to ensure that access to that 
dream remains attainable, for the 800,000 
young Dreamers currently living in the shad-
ows, for immigrants serving our communities 
on the frontlines of this pandemic—all while 
living in tremendous uncertainty and fear. 
This bill will codify what we already know to 
be true, that their home is here. 
We must pass H.R. 6. We must pursue the 
dream and the promise that is embedded in 
our great nation. 
I urge all my colleagues to support this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. BISHOP). 
Mr. BISHOP of North Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, the American people are a 
generous people, instinctively drawn to 
the idea of amnesty. It is a fine word, 
‘‘amnesty.’’ It means a general pardon 
for offenses, an act of forgiveness for 
past offenses. 
Of course, in the immigration arena, 
amnesty means not only pardon or for-
giveness for violating our laws, but 
also a grant of important rights; ulti-
mately, the privilege of citizenship. 
Sometimes that important distinction 
can be overlooked. 
b 1330 
But what is particularly despicable 
in the present legislation is that Demo-
crats exploit that fundamental spirit of 
generosity by misleading the American 
people about the scope of the proposed 
amnesty, its recipients, and its impli-
cations. 
They would have you believe that 
this 
legislation 
responds 
to 
those 
President Obama dubbed Dreamers. In 
the gentlewoman from California’s de-
scription, it is a 17-year-old who 
worked hard and became a model stu-
dent and quarterback on the high 
school football team who doesn’t even 
remember the time before he lived in 
the United States. 
But this bill is not the Dream Act. 
Rather, it crushes the dreams of Amer-
ican workers. It is not for only 641,000 
active DACA recipients. In this bill, 
Democrats want to provide amnesty 
for more than 2.9 million illegal immi-
grants, including even people who en-
tered the United States illegally by 
January 1, 2021, just over 2 months ago, 
and all at a time when our unemploy-
ment rate is over 6 percent and work-
ing Americans are the hardest-pressed 
by the economic impacts of Democrats’ 
affinity for lockdowns. 
This bill also allows dangerous crimi-
nals and gang members to gain am-
nesty benefits, even if they have been 
convicted of multiple misdemeanors. If 
this bill is signed into law, adults from 
Syria, Yemen, Sudan, Somalia, Libe-
ria, and Venezuela will receive am-
nesty. 
This body should be prioritizing re-
lief for American citizens, not illegal 
immigrants. I urge my colleagues to 
reject this misleading rhetoric and this 
dangerous bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 
minute to the distinguished gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the 
FBI and the Secretary of Homeland Se-
curity said the greatest threat to 
America is domestic terrorism, White 
racism, white supremacy, not babies 
who have come here innocently and 
through no fault of their own. 
I rise with great enthusiasm to sup-
port H.R. 6 and to join my colleague, 
Congresswoman 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
in 
her work. For two decades, we have 
stood alongside each other. 
The American Dream and Promise 
Act provides immigrant youth and cur-
rent or potential holders of temporary 
protected status or deferred enforced 
departure the opportunity to become 
citizens. 
This is the very same person. This 
person, his name is Alonso Guillen. He 
was a DACA. He died coming to Hous-
ton during Hurricane Harvey trying to 
save lives. Cesar Espinosa, who orga-
nized a civil rights organization, is a 
DACA recipient, and the EMS person 
who worked with us during Hurricane 
Harvey, or Liberians on deferred sta-
tus, and TPS persons. 
Let me just say, support this because 
it is the right thing to do. They are not 
terrorists. It is not amnesty. 
Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committees on the Judiciary and on Home-
land Security, as an original cosponsor of leg-
islation to extend the full promise of America 
to Dreamers, and a representative of a state 
on the southern border, I rise in strong support 
of H.R. 6, the ‘‘American Dream and Promise 
Act of 2019,’’ and the underlying legislation. 
The American Dream and Promise Act of 
2019 establishes a roadmap to U.S. citizen-
ship for (1) immigrant youth and (2) current or 
potential holders of (a) temporary protected 
status (TPS) or (b) deferred enforced depar-
ture (DED). 
Ensuring a path to earned citizenship is a 
non-negotiable principle for me and the sine 
qua non of meaningful immigration reform leg-
islation. 
Indeed, providing a path to earned access 
to citizenship has been a central feature of 
every comprehensive immigration reform bill I 
have co-sponsored or sponsored in the Con-
gress since 2007 when I became Ranking 
Member of the House Judiciary Subcommittee 
on Immigration and introduced the ‘‘Save 
America Comprehensive Immigration Reform 
Act, (H.R. 1525),’’ which I have reintroduced in 
each succeeding Congress. 
Like H.R. 6, Section 501 of my legislation 
provides a path to earned legalization status 
to those undocumented immigrants who have 
resided in the United States for 5 years and 
meet other eligibility requirements. 
Mr. Speaker, as we stand today on the 
precipice of passing the American Dream and 
Promise Act of 2019, I am thinking of the hun-
dreds of thousands of young immigrants 
whose lives will be changed for the better by 
keeping our promise to them, so they can re-
alize their dreams and making America better, 
stronger, and more prosperous. 
And at this moment, I am thinking of Alonso 
Guillen, an heroic DREAMER who lived in my 
congressional district, and who came to the 
United States from Mexico as a child and died 
when his boat capsized while he was rescuing 
survivors of the flooding caused by Hurricane 
Harvey in the Houston area. 
That is the type of courage, honor, and 
commitment to service we are talking when 
we speak of DREAMERS. 
Mr. Speaker, Title I of H.R. 6, the Dream 
Act of 2019, contains provisions regarding re-
lief for immigrant youth. 
Title II of the bill, American Promise Act of 
2019, contains provisions related to persons 
eligible Temporary Protected Stats (TPS) or 
Deferred Enforcement Departure; the third and 
final title contains general provisions that apply 
to both Titles I & II). 
Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 6 because it 
keeps America’s word to the more than 
800,000 young people we asked to come out 
of the shadows and walk proudly and un-
ashamedly as legitimate members of the 
American community. 
The legislation does this by providing condi-
tional permanent resident (CPR) status and a 
roadmap to lawful permanent resident (LPR) 
status and, eventually, earned U.S. citizenship 
for immigrant youth who entered the U.S. be-
fore age 18, have four or more years of resi-
dency, and graduated from high school (or the 
equivalent). 
H.R. 6 also provides an opportunity to apply 
for LPR status for people who currently have 
or who may be eligible for TPS or DED and 
who have three or more years of residency. 
Mr. Speaker, individuals who are eligible for 
protection under the bill have lived in the 
United States for much of their lives; the aver-
age Dreamer came to the United States at the 
age of 8, while the average TPS- or OED-eli-
gible person arrived in 1997. 
Without permanent protections such as 
those in H.R. 6, the future of these immi-
grants, and their families, are at risk in the 
United States—as well as the fiscal and eco-
nomic contributions they make. 
Passing this legislation is the right thing to 
do and now is the time to do it; in fact, it is 
long overdue. 
I am mindful also, Mr. Speaker, that in addi-
tion to helping restore America’s reputation as 
the most welcoming nation on earth, the legis-
lation the House will pass also positions Amer-
ica to better compete and win in the global 
economy of the 21st century. 
According to expert studies, including one 
by the Center for American Progress, ending 
deferred action for childhood arrivals would re-
sult in a loss of $460.3 billion from the national 
GDP over the ensuing decade and would re-
move an estimated 685,000 workers from the 
nation’s economy and workforce at a time 
when more, not fewer, workers are des-
perately needed. 
And 10 states, including my home state of 
Texas, would stand to lose more than $8 bil-
lion annually in state GDP. 
Mr. Speaker, immigrants eligible for protec-
tion under H.R. 6 are part of Texas’s social 
fabric. 
Texas is home to 386,300 immigrants who 
are eligible for protection under the Dream 
and Promise Act, 112,000 of whom reside in 
Harris County. 
These individuals live with 845,300 family 
members and among those family members, 
178,700 are U.S.-born citizen children. 
Dreamers in Texas who are eligible for pro-
tection under the bill arrived in the United 
States at the average age of 8. 
TPS- and DED-eligible immigrants in Texas 
who would be eligible for protection under 
H.R. 6 have on average lived in the United 
States since 1996.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1520 
March 18, 2021 
Immigrants eligible for the Dream and Prom-
ise Act own 43,500 homes in Texas and pay 
$340,500,000 in annual mortgage payments. 
Eligible immigrants in Texas and their 
households contribute $2,234,800,000 in fed-
eral taxes and $1,265,200,000 in state and 
local taxes each year. 
Annually, 
these 
households 
generate 
$10,519,000,000 in spending power in Texas 
and help power the national economy. 
Mr. Speaker, let me highlight some of the 
more important provisions of the American 
Dream and Promise Act. 
H.R. 6 helps young persons in the following 
ways: 
1. Extends the length of conditional perma-
nent resident (CPR) status from eight to ten 
years to give applicants more time to fulfill re-
quirements; 
2. Stays the removal of minors who are not 
yet eligible for relief but may become eligible 
in the future and who temporarily unenroll 
from school; 
3. Permits people with CPR to obtain legal 
permanent resident (LPR) status without satis-
fying the employment, military, or educational 
tracks if their deportation would cause ‘‘hard-
ship’’ to themselves or immediate family mem-
bers (instead of ‘‘extreme hardship’’); 
4. Includes apprenticeship programs as a 
qualifying education to obtain CPR status; 
5. Eliminates the costly medical examination 
for applicants; 
6. Establishes a fee ceiling of $495 for im-
migrant youth applying for CPR status; 
7. Clarifies that people with CPR can ac-
cess professional, commercial, and business 
licenses; 
8. Permits people with CPR who obtain a 
certificate or credential from an area career 
and technical education school to obtain LPR 
status; and 
9. Updates the criminal background bars 
and inadmissibility requirements. 
Additionally, H.R. 6 provides LPR status to 
CPR holders who (1) serve in the uniformed 
services for two years; (2) complete two years 
at or obtain a degree from an institution of 
higher education; or (3) work 75 percent of the 
time in CPR. 
Another important feature of this legislation 
is that makes it easier for states to provide in- 
state tuition to immigrant students and estab-
lishes that CPR-holders are eligible for federal 
loans, work study, services, and grants. 
For persons with TPS or DED status, the 
American Dream and Promise Act provides 
much needed relief. 
First, H.R. 6 provides LPR status for people 
with TPS or DED (and those who were eligible 
but did not apply) who apply within three years 
from the date of enactment if they (1) had at 
least three years of continuous residence (as 
well as residence since the date required the 
last time that the person’s nation of origin was 
designated) and (2) were eligible for or had (a) 
TPS on September 25, 2016, or (b) DED on 
September 28, 2016. 
This protection covers nationals of 13 coun-
tries: El Salvador, Guinea, Haiti, Honduras, Li-
beria, Nepal, Nicaragua, Sierra Leone, Soma-
lia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. 
I believe similar protections should be ex-
tended to Guatemalan nationals in our coun-
try, which is why I will soon reintroduce the 
‘‘Continue American Safety Act,’’ which ex-
tends TPS status to Guatemala and I look for-
ward to working with my colleagues to achieve 
this outcome. 
Second, H.R. 6 classifies people with TPS 
or DED as inspected and admitted for the pur-
poses of Immigration & Nationality Act (INA) 
section 245(a), making it easier to obtain LPR 
status through existing channels (e.g., a fam-
ily-based petition). 
Third, H.R. 6 stays the removal or deporta-
tion of an individual while an application is 
pending. 
Fourth, the American Dream and Promise 
Act establishes a fee ceiling of $1,140 for peo-
ple with TPS or DED applying for LPR status. 
Fifth, the legislation provides greater trans-
parency by requiring the Secretary of the 
Homeland Security (DHS) to provide an expla-
nation for and report within three days of pub-
lishing notice to terminate TPS designation for 
certain nationals. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6 is exceptional legisla-
tion and a welcome development but is not a 
substitute for undertaking the comprehensive 
reform and modernization of the nation’s immi-
gration laws supported by the American peo-
ple. 
Only Congress can do that and passage of 
H.R. 6 shows that this House has the will and 
is up to the challenge. 
Comprehensive immigration reform is des-
perately needed to ensure that Lady Liberty’s 
lamp remains the symbol of a land that wel-
comes immigrants to a community of immi-
grants and does so in a manner that secures 
our borders and protects our homeland. 
Mr. Speaker, let us build on the historic leg-
islation that is the American Dream and Prom-
ise Act and seize the opportunity to pass leg-
islation that secures our borders, preserves 
America’s character as the most open and 
welcoming country in the history of the world, 
and will yield hundreds of billions of dollars in 
economic growth. 
I urge all Members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 6, the American Dream and Promise Act 
of 2021. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
Tennessee 
(Mr. 
COHEN). 
Mr. COHEN. Madam Speaker, when 
we came to Congress, my class of 2006 
was offered the opportunity to go to 
Harvard University for a seminar. We 
were told there that one of the greatest 
problems facing this country was the 
lack of workers, that our birthrate was 
declining, and that we need more peo-
ple to come to this country and more 
workers to supply our workforce and 
our economy. Those situations have 
not gotten better. 
These Dreamers are trained in Amer-
ica. They have been educated in Amer-
ica. They are talented. They are smart. 
We are not only doing the right thing 
by giving them this pathway to citizen-
ship, but we are doing the right thing 
for America because we need their tal-
ent to make this country even greater. 
That is why I support the Dreamers 
act. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Arizona (Mr. STAN-
TON). 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in support of H.R. 6, the American 
Dream and Promise Act. Dreamers 
have been waiting far too long for 
meaningful congressional action. 
By passing H.R. 6, we are telling 
Dreamers all over our country: We see 
you, we hear you, and we know your 
home is here in the United States of 
America. 
Arizona is fortunate to have nearly 
24,000 DACA recipients. They are teach-
ers, community organizers, and essen-
tial workers contributing greatly to 
our economy. In this pandemic, they 
make sure our grocery store shelves 
are stocked and our families are fed. 
They work long shifts in COVID hos-
pital wings and now are vaccinating 
our communities. 
That is who they are, giving back 
and contributing an estimated $240 mil-
lion in taxes yearly in Arizona alone. 
Dreamers are essential to rebuilding 
our economy, and it is long past time 
we put them on a path to citizenship. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. GARCIA). 
Mr. GARCIA of California. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition to 
H.R. 6. 
As a first-generation American, I 
know firsthand the opportunities that 
America provides. I understand why 
every person on this planet should 
want to come to this beautiful country. 
We are a land of immigrants, built on 
hard work, and blessed by freedoms 
that are protected by law and order 
and secured by our Constitution. 
I sympathize with the Dreamers, I 
really do, but this bill should not be 
considered before addressing our bro-
ken immigration system that led to 
this very problem. Providing amnesty 
to Dreamers while ignoring the crisis 
at the border is like cleaning up spilled 
water before fixing the broken pipe. 
If Congress fails to reform our immi-
gration system and fails to secure our 
borders, future migrants will be sub-
jected to the same situation in which 
Dreamers today find themselves. 
We need to fix our broken immigra-
tion system and secure our borders. 
If my colleagues are sincere about 
their care and passion for the Dream-
ers, they should work with us to secure 
the border today so that the Dreamers 
have a chance tomorrow. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. 
PELOSI. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding, and 
once again, I salute him for his leader-
ship. 
This is the third bill in 2 days that he 
has brought to the floor, yesterday for 
the ERA and Violence Against Women 
Act, and today, here we are with this 
legislation for the Dreamers. 
Madam Speaker, this issue is near 
and dear to my heart but, more impor-
tantly, to my head. This is so impor-
tant for our country.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1521 
March 18, 2021 
Three years ago, I came to the floor 
and spoke about our Dreamers for 8 
hours and 6 minutes. Have no fear, I 
will not use my Speaker’s minute to 
that extent today. But I wish I could 
because I have so much to say about 
what Dreamers mean to America. 
I rise with tremendous pride, joy, and 
hope this day as the House prepares to 
take this momentous step forward for 
our democracy by passing H.R. 6, the 
American Dream and Promise Act. 
I want to salute some of our leaders 
in Congress. As I acknowledged Mr. 
NADLER, the distinguished chair of the 
committee, let us also acknowledge 
LUCILLE
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
the 
god-
mother of this legislation, who carries 
forth a commitment to the newcomers 
to our country in her DNA, the same 
commitment of her father, the late 
Chairman Ed Roybal, as he championed 
newcomers to our Nation. 
She has been with this legislation for 
20 years that I know of, and it was she 
and Howard Berman who introduced it 
initially a generation ago. Ten years 
ago, she authored this legislation, and 
we were successful on the floor. We 
were successful in passing it in the 
House because of the leadership of Con-
gresswoman ROYBAL-ALLARD but also 
Chairwoman NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ, who at 
the time was the chair of the Hispanic 
Caucus. The Hispanic Caucus really led 
the way and taught the Congress about 
what Dreamers mean to America, in 
case that had not been within the expe-
rience of our Members. 
In 
this 
legislation 
today, 
NYDIA 
VELA´ ZQUEZ has the ‘‘promise.’’ This is 
Dreamers and promise. She has the 
promise, TPS and DED—again, very 
important to our country. 
YVETTE CLARKE, from the Congres-
sional Black Caucus, who is very much 
a part of all of this today, has the TPS 
piece of this. 
I was so pleased to hear this morning 
CAPAC, the Congressional Asian Pa-
cific American Caucus, have Congress-
woman STRICKLAND, of African-Amer-
ican and Korean descent, speak in 
terms of what this means to the Asian 
Pacific American community, some-
thing that Chair JUDY CHU reminds us 
of every day. 
This has now gone beyond the His-
panic Caucus, the Black Caucus, the 
Asian Pacific Caucus, and to all of us 
in the Congress. This legislation is pro-
tecting Dreamers and TPS and DED re-
cipients and honors the truth that im-
migrants are the constant reinvigora-
tion of our country. When they come 
here with their hopes and dreams and 
aspirations, 
these 
parents 
bringing 
their children, their hopes and dreams 
and aspirations for a better future for 
their children, that courage, that de-
termination, 
those 
aspirations 
are 
American traits. They all make Amer-
ica more American with all of that. 
Indeed, they are true and legitimate 
heirs, these Dreamers are, of our 
Founders. 
E 
pluribus 
unum, 
from 
many, one, we talk about that all the 
time. Many in this Chamber have been 
part of the fight to protect our patri-
otic Dreamers for years. 
As I said, when I stood here for 8 
hours and 6 minutes, the longest 
speech on record in the House in his-
tory, I was reading letters that Mem-
bers were handing me about the story 
of the Dreamers. As Mr. STANTON men-
tioned, 
they 
are 
teachers, 
profes-
sionals, 
CEOs, 
entrepreneurs. 
They 
contribute to our community in every 
way. I was so pleased to hear him talk 
about that because one of the first 
meetings I ever went to about Dream-
ers was under the leadership of one of 
the predecessors of our Members from 
Arizona, 
Congressman 
Ed 
Pastor. 
Chairman Pastor, Mr. GRIJALVA, and 
Harry Mitchell, all three, had a meet-
ing at Arizona State University about 
helping these young people. That was 
in 2007. 
So, this has been going on for a 
while. Next month, as I mentioned, 
marks the 20th year since the Dream 
Act was introduced by Congresswoman 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, and it was on a bipar-
tisan basis. When we passed it 10 years 
ago, it was on a bipartisan basis. Sadly, 
we couldn’t prevail with 60 votes in the 
Senate. But since then, millions of 
Americans have come together to orga-
nize and mobilize for Dreamers: labor 
leaders, the business community, faith 
organizations, national security offi-
cials, law enforcement, and more. 
We often talk about Dreamers having 
the support of the three Bs: badges, in 
terms of law enforcement; Bible, in 
terms of faith-based; and the business 
community. 
The true VIPs of the moment are the 
Dreamers and immigrants who have 
spoken out with great dignity and elo-
quence, refusing to be forced back into 
the shadows. 
This determination has made a dif-
ference. It is their courage that is send-
ing this legislation to the Senate and 
then to the President’s desk. 
Before I close, I want to acknowledge 
the work of Congresswoman ZOE LOF-
GREN, the chair of the Immigration 
Subcommittee of the Judiciary Com-
mittee. ZOE LOFGREN is also the chair 
of House Administration, so I call her 
Madam Chair-Madam Chair. She has 
taught immigration law. She has been 
an immigration lawyer, and she chairs 
the Immigration Subcommittee. We 
could not be better served than by her 
intricate knowledge of immigration 
law, both on this legislation and legis-
lation we will take up later, the Farm 
Workforce Modernization Act. I thank 
ZOE LOFGREN for that. 
Again, Dreamers and TPS and DED 
recipients are American in every way. 
They have lived and worked in our 
country for decades, if not their entire 
lives. They are an integral thread in 
the fabric of our Nation. For the 
Dreamers, it is less time, for others 
more. 
Dreamers power our businesses, our 
economy, and are CEOs and taxpayers, 
all of them. They advance innovation 
and America’s technological edge as 
entrepreneurs and researchers. They 
protect our national security, military 
might, and servicemembers and civil-
ian experts. 
That is why I am so grateful to Chair 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
Chair 
VELA´ ZQUEZ, 
Chair JUDY CHU, and Congresswoman 
STRICKLAND for advancing this legisla-
tion to help Dreamers and TPS and 
DED recipients. 
b 1345 
So many on the front lines of the 
pandemic 
are 
frontline 
healthcare 
workers and first responders; transpor-
tation, sanitation, and food workers; 
and teachers. They give so much to our 
country. 
These 
immigrant 
communities 
strengthen, enrich, and ennoble our 
Nation, and they must be allowed to 
stay. There is nothing partisan about 
protecting Dreamers and TPS and DED 
recipients. 
The Dream Act has long had bipar-
tisan support in both Chambers. Sup-
port for TPS and DED recipients is also 
bipartisan 
in 
the 
country. 
Nearly 
three-quarters of the public support a 
path to citizenship. 
I always love to quote President 
Reagan. In his last speech as President 
of the United States, this was his last 
message as President to the American 
people. He said: ‘‘Thanks to each wave 
of new arrivals to this land of oppor-
tunity, we are a nation forever young, 
forever bursting with energy and new 
ideas, and always on the cutting edge, 
always leading the world to the next 
frontier. This quality is vital to our fu-
ture as a nation. If we ever closed the 
door to new Americans, our leadership 
in the world would soon be lost.’’ 
I urge a bipartisan vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire as to the amount of time re-
maining for each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). The gentleman from Ohio 
has 13 minutes. The gentleman from 
New York has 143⁄4 minutes. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from New York (Mr. JONES). 
Mr. JONES. Madam Speaker, I swear, 
sometimes I stand in this Chamber and 
feel like I am in the Twilight Zone, lis-
tening to a number of my Republican 
colleagues espouse white supremacist 
ideology to denigrate our wonderful 
Dreamers. 
I am over here standing with a clear 
understanding that this bill does not 
go far enough. 
I want to share the story of a con-
stituent of mine, Mr. Paul Pierrilus, of 
our Spring Valley, New York, commu-
nity, who was deported to Haiti, a 
country where he had never even been, 
in apparent defiance of the President’s 
100-day executive order. 
We need a bill that goes further. I am 
going to vote for this, but we need a 
bill that goes further, that forgives 
people who make mistakes.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1522 
March 18, 2021 
Mr. Pierrilus, in his case, made a 
mistake in his early 20s. We need a bill 
that allows him to return home, and I 
am going to be fighting for that mov-
ing forward. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I will 
tell you what this bill does. Page 51, 
section 310: ‘‘Grant program to assist 
eligible applicants. The Secretary shall 
establish, within U.S. Citizen and Im-
migration 
Services, 
a 
program 
to 
award grants.’’ 
So while there is a disaster on the 
border, so much so that we have to 
send FEMA there, this bill not only 
gives amnesty to illegals, it uses Amer-
ican tax dollars to help the illegals 
apply for amnesty. 
Such a deal for the American tax-
payer. That is what this legislation 
does. That is what this bill is about. 
At a time when we have chaos on the 
border, this bill gives amnesty to 3 mil-
lion illegals and uses American tax dol-
lars to help those same illegals apply 
for the amnesty. I mean, the disrespect 
that the Democrats have for the Amer-
ican taxpayer is astounding to me. It is 
truly astounding. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from New Mexico (Ms. HERRELL). 
Ms. HERRELL. Madam Speaker, I 
find the name of this bill, the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act, to be 
quite a nightmare because while this 
may be a bill that will help some, it de-
stroys the dreams of the American 
children. 
The contradiction and the hypocrisy 
in this entire bill can be summed up in 
this way: I have heard over and over, 
Madam Speaker, these Dreamers are 
frontline workers; they have been in 
harm’s way; they have helped with this 
pandemic. Yet, we are going to open 
the border and allow people into our 
country that do not have a COVID test. 
We are putting our Dreamers in harm’s 
way. I find the hypocrisy of this bill 
somewhat puzzling. 
But I also want to point out that this 
bill allows those convicted of dan-
gerous crimes, including MS–13 and 
other gang members, to receive a green 
card by including the following excep-
tions if the applicants with multiple 
misdemeanor convictions, even if the 
crime was violent or resulted in death 
or bodily injury, they can still get a 
green card. It will not take into ac-
count violent crimes committed as a 
juvenile when adjudicating the applica-
tion. 
I strongly urge a ‘‘no’’ vote on this 
bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act. 
Before I continue with my remarks, I 
want to remind Mr. JORDAN and the 
others across the aisle that no human 
being is illegal. We are all children of 
God. 
I have dedicated my life to public 
service to help immigrants who come 
to the U.S. in search of a prosperous 
and dignified life. 
Since 2001, when the Dream Act was 
first conceived, Dreamers have waited. 
In 2012, DACA enabled eligible young 
adults to work lawfully, attend school, 
and contribute to society without the 
constant threat of deportation. 
However, Dreamers are still waiting. 
In Texas, over 213,000 Dreamers con-
tribute $963 million in local, State, and 
Federal taxes and have played a crit-
ical role in our State’s response to the 
COVID pandemic. 
Dreamers have waited. 
It is time for us to deliver. We should 
treat them with respect. I urge pas-
sage. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
CORREA). 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Let me just bring back the issue at 
hand, which is our Dreamers. Dreamers 
are taxpayers. They obey the law. They 
work. They go to school. They are fire-
fighters. They are police officers. They 
are nurses. Dreamers are Jose Angel 
Garibay. 
This man from my district made the 
ultimate 
sacrifice 
for 
this 
United 
States, his adopted country. Orange 
County’s first Iraqi war death, Jose 
Angel Garibay was killed in action on 
March 23, 2003. 
At the age of 21, Jose became Orange 
County’s first combat casualty in Iraq. 
Jose Angel Garibay did the right thing. 
He sacrificed his life for his country. 
Let us do the right thing and pass 
this legislation to honor Dreamers. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Pennsylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the ranking member from Ohio, 
Mr. JORDAN, for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today to op-
pose H.R. 6. 
Under the leadership of President 
Trump, illegal border crossings dropped 
dramatically, and our border was se-
cured. 
Since taking office, President Biden 
has halted construction of our border 
wall, attempted a moratorium on de-
portations, and, in so doing, created 
significant incentives for illegal immi-
gration. 
In February, over 100,000 illegal im-
migrants were apprehended at our 
southern border, three times the num-
ber in the same month the year pre-
vious. 
Speaking to Border Patrol agents, 
Republicans and Democrats are told 
the same thing: This is a humanitarian 
crisis. Violent cartels are taking ad-
vantage of innocent people to smuggle 
drugs into our country. 
Yet, the Biden administration placed 
a gag order on CBP agents. What is 
going on here? Are we going to face the 
problem, or are we going to hide it 
with gag orders? 
Now Democrats are introducing H.R. 
6, which only exacerbates the Biden 
policies at the border by creating the 
incentive of amnesty with no discus-
sion of border security. 
Madam Speaker, it is time for the 
House to wake up. This is disastrous 
policy, and it is in full view. There is 
no hiding from it. We should oppose 
H.R. 6 on humanitarian grounds. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 45 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. CHU). 
Ms. CHU. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today in strong support of H.R. 6, the 
American Dream and Promise Act, to 
put Dreamers and TPS and DED immi-
grants on a path to citizenship. 
These are our friends, neighbors, and 
colleagues. They have graduated from 
our schools, served in our military, and 
worked in our communities. During the 
pandemic, they have kept our country 
running with over 200,000 Dreamers and 
over 130,000 TPS holders in essential 
jobs at hospitals, grocery stores, and 
schools. 
As the chair of the Congressional 
Asian Pacific American Caucus, I know 
this is important to so many, including 
the Asian-American and Pacific Is-
lander community, who are 7 percent 
of the entire population but 16 percent 
of the undocumented. That means 
there are well over 100,000 Asian-Amer-
ican immigrants who urgently need re-
lief. 
This bill means so much to so many. 
I urge a ‘‘yes’’ vote for H.R. 6. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. I yield 1 minute to the 
distinguished gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. CLARKE). 
Ms. CLARKE of New York. Madam 
Speaker, as an original co-lead of this 
legislation, I rise today in support of 
the bill that is near and dear to my 
heart, H.R. 6, the American Dream and 
Promise Act. 
As the proud daughter of Jamaican 
immigrants, I understand the need for 
the American Dream and Promise Act, 
and more importantly, we need a hu-
mane and dignified 21st century immi-
gration system. Comprehensive immi-
gration reform is what is required. 
Let me be very clear, crystal clear: 
Our immigration system is broken, and 
the time has come for the values of our 
Nation to be reflected in our immigra-
tion policy. 
However, this is not just a moral 
issue. It is an economic one, as well. If 
COVID–19 has taught us anything, es-
sential workers are the lifeblood of our 
economy. They have risked their lives 
during a global pandemic to serve, sup-
port, and protect American commu-
nities. We have relied on them during 
this crisis, and it is time to give them 
a way out of the shadows. 
Let’s pass H.R. 6, the American 
Dream and Promise Act. Let’s see it 
through the Senate, and let’s get it 
signed into law. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. CARTER).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1523 
March 18, 2021 
Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today in opposition of 
this bill because we have a crisis along 
our southern border. 
We have record numbers of migrants 
seeking to come into our country. The 
number of unaccompanied children il-
legally crossing the border increased 63 
percent last month. This is truly a hu-
manitarian and security crisis, but the 
current administration is not ade-
quately addressing it. In fact, they are 
not addressing it at all. 
Instead of doing more to protect our 
border, the administration is rolling 
back policies that discourage this kind 
of mass migration. 
Today, we are considering a bill that 
does nothing to solve the problem. In 
fact, it shows that there are no reper-
cussions for breaking our laws and en-
courages more to attempt to enter the 
country illegally. 
We need a comprehensive and bipar-
tisan solution to this crisis that dis-
courages entering illegally and rewards 
following the law. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. DOGGETT). 
Mr. DOGGETT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise on behalf of those who teach, who 
heal, who protect, who study; for those 
whose entrepreneurial talent advances 
our economy—for all of our Dreamers. 
They have so much to contribute and 
they are American in every way except 
on paper. 
For so many long years, they have 
been burdened with uncertainty be-
cause of the anti-immigrant hysteria 
whipped up by these Republican fanat-
ics. In San Antonio, San Marcos, and 
Austin I have met with them person-
ally; Dreamers in Texas, where releas-
ing their full potential, through ap-
proval of this bill, would have such 
benefit to all of us. 
Today let’s move forward to reject 
the Republican nightmare and achieve 
the dream so that these deserving 
young people may truly share in the 
entire American Dream. This bill must 
only be the beginning. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. PFLUGER). 
Mr. PFLUGER. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in opposition to H.R. 6. 
Bringing an amnesty bill to the floor 
this week in the middle of a complete 
and total crisis on our southern border 
is not only tone-deaf; it is wrong. 
I traveled to the border on Monday 
and surveyed the facilities, the border, 
and the environment. It is a mess. 
Thousands of people are coming across 
our borders illegally. 
If we really cared about children, we 
would be looking at the policies that 
are incentivizing the drug cartels, the 
traffickers, the coyotes that are bring-
ing them across, exploiting them in 
every way. It is heartbreaking. 
Some wish our Nation harm, includ-
ing the individuals who have been 
found out to be on the terror watch list 
who have been apprehended crossing 
the border. 
This bill will only incentivize more 
illegal crossings. What a week to put 
this bill to a vote. 
We cannot begin to address the issues 
we are facing when our border is bro-
ken. I implore my colleagues on the 
other side of the aisle to work with us 
in a bipartisan manner to secure the 
border and then move on.

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
California 
(Ms. 
LEE). 
Ms. 
LEE 
of 
California. 
Madam 
Speaker, first of all, let me say that I 
rise in strong support of H.R. 6, the 
American Dream and Promise Act. I 
thank 
Congresswoman 
ROYBAL- 
ALLARD, Chairman NADLER, and Chair-
woman LOFGREN for advancing this leg-
islation and supporting our Dreamers. 
It is time that we protect these 
young people who have never called 
any other country than America home. 
Dreamers and individuals eligible for 
TPS or Deferred Enforcement Depar-
ture contribute mightily to their com-
munities and to our economy. They de-
serve a pathway to citizenship. 
Now, the Dreamers in my State of 
California and in my Congressional dis-
trict have made so many contributions 
under very scary and difficult cir-
cumstances. 
Madam Speaker, yes, they are as 
American as I am. I ask for an ‘‘aye’’ 
vote. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. GREEN). 
Mr. GREEN of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, my constituent, Mr. Jose Escobar, 
was living his American Dream, mar-
ried to an American-born woman, two 
American-born children, living in an 
American-built house, paying Amer-
ican taxes. Yet when he reported to 
ICE, he was taken out of the arms of 
his wife and babies, sent to El Salvador 
with $20 and the clothes on his back. It 
took us more than 2 years to get him 
home, but I went to El Salvador with 
his wife, and we brought him home. 
Madam Speaker, I will support this 
legislation because I want no one else 
to experience what Mr. Jose Escobar 
experienced. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. 
LEGER FERNANDEZ). 
Ms. LEGER FERNANDEZ. Madam 
Speaker, I rise for every child who was 
ever raised in this beautiful country 
but told they are not American; for 
every Dreamer who has lived in fear 
that they will be forced from the only 
home they have ever known. 
Madam Speaker, Dreamers are teach-
ers, students, and healthcare workers. 
They feed us, care for us, and inspire 
us. They strengthen our economy. Now 
is the moment. We must give them the 
same opportunities and protections 
that they deserve as Americans. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. STAUBER). 
Mr. 
STAUBER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
when I speak to families back home, 
they understand that there are individ-
uals and children in the country who 
were brought here through no fault of 
their own. They are understanding and 
compassionate people who want a solu-
tion that is fair and just. But some-
thing that I also hear from these same 
families is their concern and fear for 
providing green cards and paths to citi-
zenship to gang members and crimi-
nals. 
The text of this bill only compounds 
those 
fears—preventing 
the 
United 
States Government from using readily 
available information to remove gang 
members who are national security 
threats and other public safety threats. 
This motion to recommit ensures 
that those individuals whose applica-
tions would be denied on the basis of 
criminal grounds, national security 
grounds, public safety risks, or as gang 
members, are considered by the De-
partment of Homeland Security for re-
moval from the United States. 
Madam Speaker, under H.R. 6, infor-
mation provided in an application for a 
green card may not be used for the pur-
poses 
of 
immigration 
enforcement, 
even if the DHS denies the application 
or it is withdrawn. This means that if 
an applicant has a murder conviction, 
a rape conviction, or if the applicant is 
a gang member, and DHS knows about 
it because of the application, DHS 
can’t even refer that person for re-
moval. 
To be clear, this MTR does not direct 
the DHS to remove an applicant if they 
are denied on any other basis. Only ap-
plicants who are denied on criminal or 
national security grounds as public 
safety risks or as gang members would 
be affected. 
As crime rates skyrocket in cities 
across the country, the American peo-
ple are asking for serious solutions. 
They are crying out for help. And this 
bill only further enables murderers, 
rapists, and gang members to exploit 
our system. 
If the Democrats see fit to listen to 
the American people and exclude these 
criminals and gang members from re-
ceiving green cards under H.R. 6, then 
they should vote for this motion to re-
commit to ensure dangerous individ-
uals are denied a safe haven here in our 
neighborhoods and communities where 
our children go to school and play. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, may I 
inquire how much time is remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 83⁄4 minutes 
remaining. The gentleman from Ohio 
has 6 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York

H1524 
March 18, 2021 
Mr. ESPAILLAT. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to support H.R. 6, the American 
Dream and Promise Act. 
Madam Speaker, how hypocritical 
and shameful of the other side of the 
aisle. They want to deny Dreamers, yet 
those Dreamers provide education and 
daycare services for their children. 
They want to deny Dreamers, but 
those Dreamers take care of their frail 
and elderly parents. 
They want to deny Dreamers, but 
their parents pick the crops and the 
fruits that they eat at their table. 
Madam Speaker, how hypocritical. 
They want to deny Dreamers, yet those 
Dreamers, as members of the National 
Guard, protected us right here against 
an angry, racist mob. 
Madam Speaker, I know that too well 
because I came to this Nation without 
any papers. And I sit as a Member of 
Congress and my vote is equal to any 
of their votes. It is equal to any of 
their votes because, in this country, 
you can dream and it has promise. 
Madam Speaker, we will not go back. 
We will continue to move forward. I 
support H.R. 6. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Illinois (Mr. GARCI´A). 
Mr. 
GARCI´A 
of 
Illinois. 
Madam 
Speaker, this bill is critical for mil-
lions. That is why I supported it in the 
previous Congress, but it also contains 
some deep flaws that perpetuate racial 
injustice. I, along with 47 Members, 
worked to eliminate those racially mo-
tivated barriers to legalization from 
this bill. These harmful provisions will 
deny immigrant youth a better future. 
In this moment of racial reckoning, 
we have missed an opportunity. Yet I 
will vote for this bill, and I urge sup-
port because we can do better so that 
every immigrant child has a fair 
chance to call America home. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ARRINGTON). 
Mr. ARRINGTON. Madam Speaker, 
don’t ask the President. Ask the people 
of Texas and they will tell you the 
truth. Biden’s unilateral actions are 
the cause for this unprecedented crisis. 
My Democrat colleagues’ response to 
their fellow Americans: An amnesty 
that will only add fuel to the fire of the 
burning chaos at the southern border. 
Madam Speaker, how did we go from 
America first to America last in just 
days? 
Taken together, these perverse incen-
tives will further encourage lawless-
ness, enrich cartels, enable the abuse 
and exploitation of the most vulnerable 
people, cheat those who have respected 
our process, compromise the health 
and safety of the American people, and 
undermine the sovereignty and secu-
rity of our great Nation. 
Madam Speaker, don’t ask the Presi-
dent. Ask the people of Texas and they 
will tell you the truth. The cartels are 
in control at the border and the left is 
in control of the Democrat party. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman 
from Massachusetts (Ms. PRESSLEY). 
Ms. PRESSLEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman NADLER for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, the tragic events of 
this week underscore both our respon-
sibility and the urgency we must move 
to legislate our values and to stand on 
the side of justice. 
I represent Massachusetts Seventh, a 
district which is 40 percent immi-
grants. I rise today in solidarity with 
them. 
H.R. 6 is a critical step towards citi-
zenship for Dreamers, TPS, and DED 
holders. However, the criminal bar pro-
visions added to this bill further entan-
gles our racist criminal legal system in 
the citizenship process. 
I thank Congressman GARCI´A
and 
partners for leading the fight to elimi-
nate this language. There is more work 
to be done, but this bill moves us in the 
right direction of a more just America, 
one which values the lives of immi-
grants and not just their labor. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Michigan (Mrs. MCCLAIN). 
Mrs. MCCLAIN. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today because I am absolutely furi-
ous. Every single day, 5,000 new illegal 
aliens cross our southern border. Every 
single day, more men, more women and 
children are smuggled across our bor-
der and being trafficked. Every single 
day, the drug cartels and human traf-
fickers are raping and abusing our 
women and children. One out of three 
of these women and children are being 
raped. 
I ask the administration this: How is 
that not a crisis? 
Madam 
Speaker, 
for 
almost 
2 
months, our Nation has refused to call 
this a crisis, what is occurring at our 
border. You cannot solve a problem un-
less you first admit there is a problem; 
and we have a problem. This bill today 
does nothing to solve that problem or 
even acknowledge that we have a prob-
lem. 
We, as a Congress, need to say in uni-
son: We have a crisis at our border. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. SCHA-
KOWSKY). 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, 
there is no doubt the American Dream 
and Promise Act will bring much-need-
ed relief to our Dreamers and our im-
migrant communities, and I will be 
voting for the bill. 
However, many of my constituents 
are disappointed that H.R. 6 includes 
harsh exclusions that will block many 
of our long-term members of our com-
munity from citizenship simply be-
cause of misdeeds, mistakes that they 
made years and years ago. I will con-
tinue to advocate for them. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, if we 
adopt the motion to recommit, we will 
instruct the Committee on the Judici-
ary to consider the amendment to H.R. 
6 to ensure that gang members do not 
receive any benefits under the under-
lying bill and are swiftly removed from 
the country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of my 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from Ohio? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from California (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I, and the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus rise in 
support of H.R. 6, the American Dream 
and Promise Act, which will make an 
incredible positive difference for our 
Nation. 
It is precisely now, during a pan-
demic, when we need this legislation. 
Dreamers are doctors, nurses, lab tech-
nicians, contact tracers, and job cre-
ators. Dreamers are on the front lines 
of 
the 
COVID–19 
pandemic. 
They 
strengthen our economy and they 
make 
invaluable 
contributions 
to 
America. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
the 
American 
Dream and Promise Act will provide a 
pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, 
TPS holders, and DED recipients. We 
must pass this bill today. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 15 seconds to the 
gentleman from California. 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the 
Congressional 
Hispanic 
Caucus 
members, 
Congresswoman 
LUCILLE 
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
Congresswoman 
NYDIA VELA´ ZQUEZ, as well as Congress-
woman YVETTE CLARKE, for their re-
markable efforts on this piece of legis-
lation. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, there is an unprecedented crisis at 
the southern border. Literally, hun-
dreds of thousands of illegal immi-
grants are crossing into the United 
States, stretching our patrol officers 
and enforcement down there to a 
breaking point. 
In February of this year, over 100,000 
illegals were apprehended. That is a 28 
percent increase from the year before. 
And I guarantee you, it is only going to 
get worse. The projections are even 
more than that this coming month. 
Illegal border crossings are now five 
times higher than before President 
Biden was inaugurated. And this is all 
fueled by the ‘‘open border’’ policies of 
this 
administration 
promising 
am-
nesty, ending the wall construction, 
halting deportations, handcuffing our 
law enforcement, and undermining bor-
der security.

Trump

Biden a secure southern border, and in

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, meanwhile, here in Washington, the 
Democratic 
majority 
is 
cheerfully 
pushing more legislation to incentivize 
more illegals coming here. We have 
this bill promoting amnesty. We are 
literally exalting illegals in this coun-
try over those who have waited years 
to become citizens. 
Madam Speaker, this is not rocket 
science. The Democratic party knows 
this is going to create a greater crisis, 
and they simply don’t care. It is time 
to stop fueling the crisis and start solv-
ing it. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘no.’’

Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, how 
much time do we have remaining? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York has 51⁄2 minutes

has 2 minutes remaining. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. CUELLAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in favor of Dreamers who call the 
U.S. home. Dreamers are our neigh-
bors, our colleagues, our classmates. 
They are individuals that serve as es-
sential workers, teachers, medical per-
sonnel, that fully contribute to our 
country and make America stronger. 
They pay taxes. They work. They have 
no criminal record. They help us, and 
those are the type of individuals that 
we need. 
Madam Speaker, my question is: Why 
are we afraid of a 7-year-old? 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 30 seconds to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. 
MANNING). 
Ms. MANNING. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today as the granddaughter of im-
migrants in support of the American 
Dream and Promise Act. We need a 
pathway to citizenship for Dreamers 
who arrived in the United States as 
children and know this country as 
their only home; for TPS recipients 
who, like my grandparents, sought ref-
uge in the United States when crises in 
their home countries put their very 
lives at risk. 
These are doctors, nurses, first re-
sponders, who cared for us during the 
pandemic. Many have served bravely as 
members of our military. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ for our friends 
and neighbors who yearn to become 
citizens of the country they already 
call home. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the distinguished 
gentleman 
from 
New 
York 
(Mr. 
SUOZZI). 
Mr. SUOZZI. Madam Speaker, 100 
years ago my father was born in a 
small medieval village in the moun-
taintops of southern Italy. He came to 
America as a young boy, and in his St. 
Dominic’s High School yearbook, he 
wrote that his goal in life was to be-
come a real American. 
Twenty-seven years ago, I served as 
the young mayor of my hometown of 
Glen Cove. I addressed the issue of a 
growing population of new immigrants 
from Central and South America who 
gathered on street corners looking for 
daywork 
by 
creating 
the 
first 
dayworkers’ site anywhere on the East 
Coast of the United States of America. 
Today, those same men who gathered 
on street corners have their own busi-
nesses, own homes, their children went 
to 
school 
with 
my 
children. 
One 
Dreamer from El Salvador who grad-
uated from high school with my daugh-
ter went on to graduate from college 
with a degree in biomedical engineer-
ing, got a master’s in biomedical engi-
neering, and is now pursuing a doc-
torate in the same subject. 
Today, I will support the American 
Dream and Promise Act for Mario, and 
for Nelson, and for all the other 
Dreamers whose goal is like my fa-
ther’s, to be a real American. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), the distin-
guished whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman from Ohio for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong op-
position to this amnesty bill. And if 
you look at what is happening at our 
southern border right now, America is 
facing a serious crisis. Our southern 
border is being overrun, the facilities, 
the detention centers that are set up to 
hold people who are coming across, are 
being overwhelmed. 
In fact, if you listen to what the bor-
der agents are telling us, it is total 
mayhem, to quote one of the border 
agents. Many facilities are not at 100 
percent or 200 percent or 300 percent 
capacity, but even worse than that. 
There are kids who aren’t getting 
enough food, who aren’t being able to 
shower more than once a week. 
This is going on in American deten-
tion facilities today, and President 
Biden refuses to acknowledge the prob-
lem. Part of dealing with the problem 
is to first admit there is a problem, and 
President Biden doesn’t even want to 
acknowledge it. 
And then on the heels of this border 
crisis that is going on right now, there 
is a bill on the House floor to create 
amnesty, to create a bigger magnet, 
saying, come to the southern border. 
The Homeland Security Secretary 
has been pressed repeatedly the last 
few days to tell people to stop coming 
across the border illegally, and he 
won’t do it. He says, Well, they will 
come right now. As if there is a time to 
break the law. 
Let’s get back to legal immigration, 
a system that actually works for 
America. But when you have a crisis at 
the border, the last thing you should 
do is make it worse. That is what this 
bill does. 
We should be having an honest con-
versation about how to make our legal 
system of immigration work; not how 
to ignite a crisis at the border and 
make it worse. We know how bad it is 
over there. In fact, because of the en-
couragement to cross the border ille-
gally, there are caravans of young kids 
coming across, and reports that up to a 
third of all the women coming across 
are being sexually assaulted on the 
journey. Stop this humanitarian crisis. 
Reject this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
We do have a crisis in this country: 
the crisis consists of a shortage of 
workers. As our birth rate goes down, 
as our aging goes up, we have fewer and 
fewer workers. And since economists 
tell us that the number of workers is 
what produces prosperity, this is a cri-
sis for the country. 
Fortuitously, we have a situation 
where we have several million people 
in this country who are Americans, 
who have lived almost their entire 
lives in America, who, as was men-
tioned before, find out they weren’t 
born in this country only when they 
apply for a driver’s license when they 
are 18 years old. They are a resource 
for this country, and they ought to be 
legalized, which is what this bill does, 
so that we can utilize their talents 
properly and remain under rule of law. 
Madam Speaker, organizations, asso-
ciations, and industry leaders from 
across the political spectrum support 
passage of H.R. 6, the American Dream 
and Promise Act of 2021. They include 
among them: United We Dream, Serv-
ice Employees International, the AFL– 
CIO—and these unions do not fear com-
petition, they know it is good—the 
U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, 
United States Chamber of Commerce, 
Apple, and the National Education As-
sociation. 
After closing the books on 4 years of 
disastrous and inhumane immigration 
policies, today we begin a new chapter, 
one based on compassion, reason, and 
the fundamental values we hold dear as 
Americans. 
Passage of H.R. 6 is long overdue. To-
day’s vote will dictate the future of 
millions of Dreamers and recipients of 
the TPS and DED and will greatly help 
the economy of this country. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to vote in support of the Amer-
ican Dream and Promise Act of 2021, 
and I yield back the balance of my 
time. 
Ms. ESHOO. Madam Speaker, I’m proud to

Promise Act to ensure that millions of young 
Americans can remain in the only country 
they’ve ever known and loved. 
The bill provides a pathway to citizenship for 
Dreamers, young people who came to the 
U.S. as children without legal status. It pro-
vides conditional legal status for ten years to 
those with a high school diploma or equivalent 
credential, and they must pay a fee and pass 
a background check. They can also earn per-
manent legal status if they attend college, 
work lawfully, or serve in the military. 
I supported President Obama’s Deferred Ac-
tion for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program 
which provided temporary legal status and 
work permits to over 650,000 young people, 
but only Congress can provide permanent 
legal status and a pathway to citizenship 
through statute. After putting their faith in the 
government when they registered for DACA 
and enduring the Trump Administration’s 
three-year legal battle to end this program, 
these young people deserve the certainty of a 
permanent solution. 
The American Dream and Promise Act also 
provides permanent legal status to recipients 
of Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and De-
ferred Enforced Departure (DED), programs 
that provide temporary legal status to immi-
grants from countries experiencing war, nat-
ural disasters, or other ongoing crises. 
Many of the individuals I’ve described are 
longtime U.S. residents who contribute to their 
communities and our economy and are Ameri-
cans in all but name. Our legislation provides 
them with an earned pathway to citizenship so 
they can be legally recognized as full mem-
bers of society and no longer live in fear of 
deportation. They deserve this, and I urge all 
Members to support the American Dream and 
Promise Act. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Madam Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of this bill, the Dream and 
Promise Act. Let me thank Speaker PELOSI, 
Chairman NADLER, Chairwoman LOFGREN, 
Rep. 
LUCILLE
ROYBAL-ALLARD, 
and 
Rep. 
YVETTE CLARKE for all their work to make hu-
mane immigration reform a priority. 
I am a proud co-author of the Dream and 
Promise Act, which will finally give peace of 
mind to millions who are American in every 
way but on paper by providing a pathway to 
citizenship. These are Dreamers, TPS, and 
DED recipients, yes. But they are also our co- 
workers, friends, family members and hard-
working, law-abiding members of our commu-
nities. 
And under this bill, we can shield qualifying 
recipients of TPS, DED and DACA from de-
portation and create a more comprehensive 
pathway to citizenship. 
So, let’s do the right thing, the American 
thing, and pass this bill. 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
I rise today in support of H.R. 6, the DREAM 
and PROMISE Act of 2021. This timely legis-
lation would finally provide a solution to the 
millions of immigrants who have faced uncer-
tainty on their legal status for too long as a re-
sult of this country’s broken immigration sys-
tem. 
When I was young and our family had the 
opportunity to travel to go see family or to see 
the country, I did not have a say in where we 
went or how long we stayed there. I was a 
child. Simply put, this was not my decision. 
Similarly, the children of undocumented immi-
grants who were brought to our country did 
not have a say on where their parents were 
bringing them, or how long they would be 
staying here. They were innocent children. 
And while we’ve debated for over two dec-
ades on meaningful immigration reform, these 
individuals have had the opportunity to grow 
up with our children and families, attend the 
same schools and universities, have families 
of their own, and make immeasurable con-
tributions to our communities. DREAMERs 
have been able to live the American Dream in 
every way but one—on paper. 
The legislation that we are debating today 
not only provides a pathway to legalization 
and citizenship for these individuals but also to 
those who fled political unrest and natural dis-
asters in their home countries. Currently pro-
tected under TPS (Temporary Protected Sta-
tus), these individuals face the same uncer-
tainty about their futures as DREAMERs. And 
like DREAMERs, they too have been in our 
country for decades and play a critical role in 
the success of our communities. 
DREAM and PROMISE Act of 2021 is wide-
ly popular—supported by a majority of Ameri-
cans—and, notably, bipartisan. It is backed by 
business leaders, labor unions, and educators 
alike. Some of its advocates are my constitu-
ents, who have told their stories and inspired 
me with their commitment and unwavering 
dedication to their work, their families, our 
community in North Texas, and to the country 
they call home, the United States of America. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly believe that we 
must act now and pass legislation to offer a 
common-sense and logical solution to our 
broader immigration issues. The DREAM and 
PROMISE Act would take a meaningful step 
towards that goal and would lay out a path in 
which we could do that, which is why I urge 
my colleagues to support it and look forward 
to the Senate’s immediate consideration. 
Ms. MOORE of Wisconsin. Madam Speak-
er, today, I am pleased to rise in support of 
the American Dream and Promise Act (H.R. 6) 
to provide permanent protections for Dreamers 
and those currently protected by Temporary 
Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Enforced 
Departure (DED) programs. 
Over the past few years, the lives of these 
Dreamers, who have largely known no other 
home than the United States, have been filled 
with even greater uncertainly and court chal-
lenges. This bill aims to permanently change 
that and give security and a pathway to citi-
zenship for our Dreamers. 
The vast majority of DACA-eligible students 
over the age of 18 received a high school 
education here. Our nation has made an in-
vestment in their future that not only trans-
formed their lives, but also has resulted in 
widespread economic and other benefits for 
our country and communities. A few years 
ago, it was estimated that if Wisconsin’s 
DACA workers were deported, it would cost 
the state more than $400 million annually. 
Despite this uncertainty and outright hateful 
opposition from the previous administration, 
these young men and women remain resolute 
and many have served on the frontlines—as 
health care professionals and other essential 
workers—during this deadly pandemic. 
We successfully defended against ill-ad-
vised efforts to end DACA. Now it is time to 
take the next step. We need to ensure that 
DREAMers can continue enriching our coun-
try. 
Likewise, TPS holders have also seen their 
lives thrown into turmoil during an already tur-
bulent time, with their fate depending on a se-
ries of court decisions. Like Dreamers, TPS 
holders are active members of their commu-
nities, many have lived here for years, and are 
critical contributors to our economy. 
It’s always the right time to do the right 
thing. Now is the right time to provide perma-
nent protections and a pathway to citizenship 
for those who have contributed so much to our 
country. I am pleased to support this bill.

ant to House Resolution 233, the pre-

(b) GROUNDS FOR INELIGIBILITY.— 
(1) GROUNDS OF INADMISSIBILITY.—Except as

tering the United States after the date of intro-
duction of this Act; and

under section 212(a)(9)(B) of the Immigration 
and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(9)(B));

alien (as defined in section 274A(h)(3) of the Im-

submit additional evidence. 
(3) AMENDED APPLICATION.—An alien whose 
application for certified agricultural worker sta-
tus is denied under this section may submit an 
amended application for such status to the Sec-
retary if the amended application is submitted 
within the application period described in sub-
section (c) and contains all the required infor-
mation and fees that were missing from the ini-
tial application. 
(e) ALTERNATIVE H–2A STATUS.—An alien who 
has not met the required period of agricultural 
labor or services under subsection (a)(1)(A), but 
is otherwise eligible for certified agricultural 
worker status under such subsection, shall be el-
igible for classification as a nonimmigrant de-
scribed in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) of the Im-
migration 
and 
Nationality 
Act 
(8 
U.S.C. 
1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a)) upon approval of a petition 
submitted by a sponsoring employer, if the alien 
has performed at least 575 hours (or 100 work 
days) of agricultural labor or services during the 
3-year period preceding the date of the introduc-
tion of this Act. The Secretary shall create a

wage for the occupational classification as re-
ported by the Secretary of Labor based on a 
wage survey conducted by such Secretary. 
‘‘(B) LIMITATIONS ON WAGE FLUCTUATIONS.— 
‘‘(i) WAGE FREEZE FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2022.— 
For calendar year 2022, the adverse effect wage 
rate for each State and occupational classifica-
tion under this subsection shall be the adverse 
effect wage rate that was in effect for H–2A 
workers in the applicable State on the date of 
the introduction of the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act of 2021. 
‘‘(ii) CALENDAR YEARS 2023 THROUGH 2031.—For 
each of calendar years 2023 through 2031, the 
adverse effect wage rate for each State and oc-
cupational classification under this subsection 
shall be the wage calculated under subpara-
graph (A), except that such wage may not— 
‘‘(I) be more than 1.5 percent lower than the 
wage in effect for H–2A workers in the applica-
ble State and occupational classification in the 
immediately preceding calendar year; 
‘‘(II) except as provided in clause (III), be 
more than 3.25 percent higher than the wage in 
effect for H–2A workers in the applicable State 
and occupational classification in the imme-
diately preceding calendar year; and 
‘‘(III) if the application of clause (II) results 
in a wage that is lower than 110 percent of the 
applicable Federal or State minimum wage, be 
more than 4.25 percent higher than the wage in 
effect for H–2A workers in the applicable State 
and occupational classification in the imme-
diately preceding calendar year. 
‘‘(iii) CALENDAR YEARS AFTER 2031.—For any 
calendar year after 2031, the applicable wage 
rate described in paragraph (1)(B) shall be the 
wage rate established pursuant to paragraph 
(7)(D). Until such wage rate is effective, the ad-
verse effect wage rate for each State and occu-
pational classification under this subsection 
shall be the wage calculated under subpara-
graph (A), except that such wage may not be 
more than 1.5 percent lower or 3.25 percent 
higher than the wage in effect for H–2A workers 
in the applicable State and occupational classi-
fication in the immediately preceding calendar 
year. 
‘‘(3) MULTIPLE OCCUPATIONS.—If the primary 
job duties for the job opportunity described in 
the petition do not fall within a single occupa-
tional classification, the applicable wage rates 
under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of paragraph 
(1) for the job opportunity shall be based on the 
highest such wage rates for all applicable occu-
pational classifications. 
‘‘(4) PUBLICATION; WAGES IN EFFECT.— 
‘‘(A) PUBLICATION.—Prior to the start of each 
calendar year, the Secretary of Labor shall pub-
lish the applicable adverse effect wage rate (or 
successor wage rate, if any), and prevailing 
wage if available, for each State and occupa-
tional classification through notice in the Fed-
eral Register. 
‘‘(B) JOB ORDERS IN EFFECT.—Except as pro-
vided in subparagraph (C), publication by the 
Secretary of Labor of an updated adverse effect 
wage rate or prevailing wage for a State and oc-
cupational classification shall not affect the 
wage rate guaranteed in any approved job order 
for which recruitment efforts have commenced 
at the time of publication. 
‘‘(C) EXCEPTION
FOR
YEAR-ROUND
JOBS.—If 
the Secretary of Labor publishes an updated ad-
verse effect wage rate or prevailing wage for a 
State and occupational classification concerning 
a petition described in subsection (i), and the 
updated wage is higher than the wage rate 
guaranteed in the work contract, the employer 
shall pay the updated wage not later than 14 
days after publication of the updated wage in 
the Federal Register. 
‘‘(5) WORKERS PAID ON A PIECE RATE OR OTHER 
INCENTIVE BASIS.—If an employer pays by the 
piece rate or other incentive method and re-
quires one or more minimum productivity stand-
ards as a condition of job retention, such stand-
ards shall be specified in the job order and shall 
be no more than those normally required (at the 
time of the first petition for H–2A workers) by 
other employers for the activity in the area of 
intended employment, unless the Secretary of 
Labor approves a higher minimum standard re-
sulting from material changes in production 
methods. 
‘‘(6) GUARANTEE OF EMPLOYMENT.— 
‘‘(A) OFFER TO WORKER.—The employer shall 
guarantee the worker employment for the hour-
ly equivalent of at least three-fourths of the 
work days of the total period of employment, be-
ginning with the first work day after the arrival 
of the worker at the place of employment and 
ending on the date specified in the job offer. For 
purposes of this subparagraph, the hourly 
equivalent means the number of hours in the 
work days as stated in the job offer and shall 
exclude the worker’s Sabbath and Federal holi-
days. If the employer affords the worker less em-
ployment than that required under this para-
graph, the employer shall pay the worker the 
amount which the worker would have earned 
had the worker, in fact, worked for the guaran-
teed number of hours. 
‘‘(B) FAILURE
TO
WORK.—Any hours which 
the worker fails to work, up to a maximum of 
the number of hours specified in the job offer for 
a work day, when the worker has been offered 
an opportunity to do so, and all hours of work 
actually performed (including voluntary work 
in excess of the number of hours specified in the 
job offer in a work day, on the worker’s Sab-
bath, or on Federal holidays) may be counted by 
the employer in calculating whether the period 
of guaranteed employment has been met. 
‘‘(C) ABANDONMENT OF EMPLOYMENT; TERMI-
NATION FOR CAUSE.—If the worker voluntarily 
abandons employment without good cause be-
fore the end of the contract period, or is termi-
nated for cause, the worker is not entitled to the 
guarantee of employment described in subpara-
graph (A). 
‘‘(D) CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITY.—If, before the 
expiration of the period of employment specified 
in the job offer, the services of the worker are no 
longer required for reasons beyond the control 
of the employer due to any form of natural dis-
aster before the guarantee in subparagraph (A) 
is fulfilled, the employer may terminate the 
worker’s employment. In the event of such ter-
mination, the employer shall fulfill the employ-
ment guarantee in subparagraph (A) for the 
work days that have elapsed from the first work 
day after the arrival of the worker to the termi-
nation of employment. The employer shall make 
efforts to transfer a worker to other comparable 
employment acceptable to the worker. If such 
transfer is not affected, the employer shall pro-
vide the return transportation required in sub-
section (f)(2). 
‘‘(7) WAGE STANDARDS AFTER 2031.— 
‘‘(A) STUDY OF ADVERSE EFFECT WAGE RATE.— 
Beginning in fiscal year 2028, the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Secretary of Labor shall jointly

tions in which H–2A workers are employed from 
falling below the wage level that would have 
prevailed in the absence of H–2A employment;

not undermine the wages and working condi-
tions of similarly employed United States work-
ers.

employer who has not agreed to provide or pay 
for the worker’s transportation and subsistence 
to such subsequent employer’s place of employ-
ment. 
‘‘(3) LIMITATION.— 
‘‘(A) AMOUNT OF REIMBURSEMENT.—Except as 
provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of re-
imbursement provided under paragraph (1) or

CERTAIN
DETERMINATIONS.—The Secretary of 
Labor shall by regulation establish a procedure

Such procedure shall require the Secretary to 
expeditiously, but no later than 72 hours after 
expedited review is requested, issue a de novo 
determination on a labor certification that was 
denied in whole or in part because of the avail-
ability of able, willing and qualified workers if

Secretary of Labor shall provide a process for 
amending a request for labor certification in 
conjunction with an H–2A petition, subsequent

cases in which the requested amendment does 
not materially change the petition (including 
the job order).

‘‘(A) MEMBER’S
VIOLATION
DOES
NOT
NEC-
ESSARILY
DISQUALIFY
ASSOCIATION
OR
OTHER 
MEMBERS.—If an individual producer member of 
a joint employer association is determined to 
have committed an act that results in the denial 
of a petition with respect to the member, the de-
nial shall apply only to that member of the asso-
ciation unless the Secretary of Labor determines 
that the association or other member partici-
pated in, had knowledge of, or reason to know 
of, the violation. 
‘‘(B) ASSOCIATION’S VIOLATION DOES NOT NEC-
ESSARILY DISQUALIFY MEMBERS.— 
‘‘(i) If an association representing agricul-
tural producers as a joint employer is deter-
mined to have committed an act that results in 
the denial of a petition with respect to the asso-
ciation, the denial shall apply only to the asso-

producer member of the association unless the 
Secretary of Labor determines that the member 
participated in, had knowledge of, or reason to 
know of, the violation. 
‘‘(ii) If an association of agricultural pro-
ducers certified as a sole employer is determined 
to have committed an act that results in the de-
nial of a petition with respect to the association,

2A workers in the commodity and occupation in 
which such aliens were employed by the associa-
tion which was denied during the period such 
denial is in force, unless such producer member

pation in question directly or through an asso-
ciation which is a joint employer of such work-
ers with the producer member. 
‘‘(5) SPECIAL PROCEDURES.—The Secretary of 
Labor, in consultation with the Secretary of Ag-
riculture and Secretary of Homeland Security, 
may by regulation establish alternate proce-
dures that reasonably modify program require-

OCCUPATIONS.—An em-
ployer may not file a petition under this section

GENERAL.—Notwithstanding the re-
quirement in section 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a) that the

and for each of the following two fiscal years 
may not exceed 20,000. 
‘‘(B) FISCAL YEARS 4 THROUGH 10.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—The total number of aliens 
who may be issued visas or otherwise provided

accordance with clause (ii). 
‘‘(ii) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENTS.—For each fiscal 
year referred to in clause (i), the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Secretary of Labor, in consulta-
tion with the Secretary of Homeland Security, 
shall establish a numerical limitation for pur-
poses of clause (i). Such numerical limitation 
may not be lower 20,000 and may not vary by 
more than 12.5 percent compared to the numer-
ical limitation applicable to the immediately pre-
ceding fiscal year. In establishing such numer-
ical limitation, the Secretaries shall consider ap-
propriate factors, including— 
‘‘(I) a demonstrated shortage of agricultural 
workers; 
‘‘(II) the level of unemployment and under-
employment of agricultural workers during the 
preceding fiscal year;

employers during the preceding fiscal year to 
engage in agricultural labor or services not of a 
temporary or seasonal nature;

ers who accepted jobs offered by employers 
using the online job registry during the pre-

‘‘(VIII) any changes in the real wages paid to 
agricultural workers in the United States as an 
indication of a shortage or surplus of agricul-
tural labor. 
‘‘(C) SUBSEQUENT
FISCAL
YEARS.—For each 
fiscal year following the fiscal years referred to 
in subparagraph (B), the Secretary of Agri-
culture and Secretary of Labor shall jointly de-
termine, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, and after considering ap-
propriate factors, including those factors listed 
in subclauses (I) through (VIII) of subpara-
graph (B)(ii), whether to establish a numerical 
limitation for that fiscal year. If a numerical 
limitation is so established— 
‘‘(i) such numerical limitation may not be 
lower than highest number of aliens admitted 
under this subsection in any of the three fiscal 
years immediately preceding the fiscal year for 
which the numerical limitation is to be estab-
lished; and 
‘‘(ii) the total number of aliens who may be 
issued visas or otherwise provided H–2A non-
immigrant status under paragraph (1) for that 
fiscal year may not exceed such numerical limi-
tation. 
‘‘(D) EMERGENCY PROCEDURES.—The Secretary 
of Agriculture and Secretary of Labor, in con-
sultation with the Secretary of Homeland Secu-
rity, shall jointly establish by regulation proce-
dures for immediately adjusting a numerical lim-
itation imposed under subparagraph (B) or (C) 
to account for significant labor shortages. 
‘‘(3) ALLOCATION OF VISAS.— 
‘‘(A) BI-ANNUAL ALLOCATION.—The annual al-
location of visas described in paragraph (2) 
shall be evenly allocated between two halves of 
the fiscal year unless the Secretary of Homeland 
Security, in consultation with the Secretary of 
Agriculture and Secretary of Labor, determines 
that an alternative allocation would better ac-
commodate demand for visas. Any unused visas 
in the first half of the fiscal year shall be added 
to the allocation for the subsequent half of the 
same fiscal year. 
‘‘(B) RESERVE
FOR
DAIRY
LABOR
OR
SERV-
ICES.— 
‘‘(i) IN GENERAL.—Of the visa numbers made 
available in each half of the fiscal year pursu-
ant to subparagraph (A), 50 percent of such 
visas shall be reserved for employers filing peti-
tions seeking H–2A workers to engage in agri-
cultural labor or services in the dairy industry. 
‘‘(ii) EXCEPTION.—If, after 4 months have 
elapsed in one half of the fiscal year, the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security determines that ap-
plication of clause (i) will result in visas going 
unused during that half of the fiscal year, 
clause (i) shall not apply to visas under this 
paragraph during the remainder of such cal-
endar half. 
‘‘(C) LIMITED ALLOCATION FOR CERTAIN SPE-
CIAL PROCEDURES INDUSTRIES.— 
‘‘(i) IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding the nu-

Agriculture shall prepare and transmit to the 
Committees on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives and Senate, a report that ad-
dresses— 
(1) whether, and the manner in which, the 
employment of H–2A workers in the United 
States has impacted the wages, working condi-
tions, or job opportunities of United States farm 
workers; 
(2) whether, and the manner in which, the ad-
verse effect wage rate increases or decreases 
wages on United States farms, broken down by 
geographic region and farm size; 
(3) whether any potential impact of the ad-
verse effect wage rate varies based on the per-
centage of workers in a geographic region that 
are H–2A workers; 
(4) the degree to which the adverse effect 
wage rate is affected by the inclusion in wage 
surveys of piece rate compensation, bonus pay-
ments, and other pay incentives, and whether 
such forms of incentive compensation should be 
surveyed and reported separately from hourly 
base rates; 
(5) whether, and the manner in which, other 
factors may artificially affect the adverse effect 
wage rate, including factors that may be specific 
to a region, State, or region within a State; 
(6) whether, and the manner in which, the H– 
2A program affects the ability of United States 
farms to compete with agricultural commodities 
imported from outside the United States; 
(7) the number and percentage of farmworkers 
in the United States whose incomes are below 
the poverty line;

be sufficient to prevent wages in occupations in 
which H–2A workers are employed from falling 
below the wage level that would have prevailed 
in the absence of the H–2A program; 
(9) whether any changes are warranted in the 
current methodologies for calculating the ad-
verse effect wage rate and the prevailing wage; 
and 
(10) recommendations for future wage protec-
tion under this section. 
(b) In preparing the report described in sub-
section (a), the Secretary of Labor and Sec-
retary of Agriculture shall engage with equal 
numbers of representatives of agricultural em-
ployers and agricultural workers, both locally 
and nationally.

Agriculture, shall establish through regulation a 
6-year pilot program to facilitate the free move-
ment and employment of temporary or seasonal 
H–2A workers to perform agricultural labor or 
services for agricultural employers registered 
with the Secretary of Agriculture. Notwith-
standing the requirements of section 218 of the 
Immigration and Nationality Act, such regula-
tion shall establish the requirements for the 
pilot program, consistent with subsection (b). 
For purposes of this section, such a worker shall 
be referred to as a portable H–2A worker, and 
status as such a worker shall be referred to as 
portable H–2A status. 
(2) ONLINE
PLATFORM.—The Secretary of 
Homeland Security, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Agri-
culture, shall maintain an online electronic 
platform to connect portable H–2A workers with 
registered agricultural employers seeking work-
ers to perform temporary or seasonal agricul-
tural labor or services. Employers shall post on 
the platform available job opportunities, includ-
ing a description of the nature and location of 
the work to be performed, the anticipated period 
or periods of need, and the terms and conditions 
of employment. Such platform shall allow port-
able H–2A workers to search for available job 
opportunities using relevant criteria, including 
the types of jobs needed to be filled and the 
dates and locations of need. 
(3) 
LIMITATION.—Notwithstanding 
the 
issuance of the regulation described in para-
graph (1), the Secretary of State may not issue 
a portable H–2A visa and the Secretary of 
Homeland Security may not confer portable H– 
2A status on any alien until the Secretary of 
Homeland Security, in consultation with the 
Secretary of Labor and Secretary of Agriculture, 
has determined that a sufficient number of em-
ployers have been designated as registered agri-
cultural employers under subsection (b)(1) and 
that such employers have sufficient job opportu-
nities to employ a reasonable number of portable 
H–2A workers to initiate the pilot program. 
(b) PILOT
PROGRAM
ELEMENTS.—The pilot 
program in subsection (a) shall contain the fol-
lowing elements: 
(1) REGISTERED AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS.— 
(A) 
DESIGNATION.—Agricultural 
employers 
shall be provided the ability to seek designation 
as registered agricultural employers. Reasonable 
fees may be assessed commensurate with the cost 
of processing applications for designation. A 
designation shall be valid for a period of up to 
3 years unless revoked for failure to comply with 
program requirements. Registered employers 
that comply with program requirements may 
apply to renew such designation for additional 
periods of up to 3 years for the duration of the 
pilot program. 
(B) LIMITATIONS.—Registered agricultural em-
ployers may employ aliens with portable H–2A 
status without filing a petition. Such employers 
shall pay such aliens at least the wage required 
under section 218(d) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1188(d)). 
(C) WORKERS’ COMPENSATION.—If a job oppor-
tunity is not covered by or is exempt from the 
State workers’ compensation law, a registered 
agricultural employer shall provide, at no cost 
to the worker, insurance covering injury and 
disease arising out of, and in the course of, the 
worker’s employment, which will provide bene-
fits at least equal to those provided under the 
State workers’ compensation law. 
(2) DESIGNATED WORKERS.— 
(A) IN GENERAL.—Individuals who have been 
previously admitted to the United States in H– 
2A status, and maintained such status during 
the period of admission, shall be provided the 
opportunity to apply for portable H–2A status. 
Portable H–2A workers shall be subject to the 
provisions on visa validity and periods of au-
thorized stay and admission for H–2A workers 
described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 
218(j) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 
U.S.C. 1188(j)(2) and (3)).

ABLE H–2A STATUS.— 
(i) 
INITIAL
OFFER

EMPLOYMENT
RE-
QUIRED.—No alien may be granted portable H– 
2A status without an initial valid offer of em-
ployment to perform temporary or agricultural 
labor or services from a registered agricultural 
employer. 
(ii) NUMERICAL LIMITATIONS.—The total num-
ber of aliens who may hold valid portable H–2A 
status at any one time may not exceed 10,000. 
Notwithstanding such limitation, the Secretary 
of Homeland Security may further limit the 
number of aliens with valid portable H–2A sta-
tus if the Secretary determines that there are an 
insufficient number of registered agricultural 
employers or job opportunities to support the 
employment of all such portable H–2A workers. 
(C) SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT.—During the pe-
riod of admission, a portable H–2A worker may 
perform temporary or seasonal agricultural 
labor or services for any employer in the United 
States that is designated as a registered agricul-
tural employer pursuant to paragraph (1). An 
employment arrangement under this section may 
be terminated by either the portable H–2A work-
er or the registered agricultural employer at any 
time. 
(D) TRANSFER TO NEW EMPLOYMENT.—At the 
cessation of employment with a registered agri-
cultural employer, a portable H–2A worker shall 
have 60 days to secure new employment with a 
registered agricultural employer. 
(E) MAINTENANCE OF STATUS.—A portable H– 
2A worker who does not secure new employment 
with a registered agricultural employer within 
60 days shall be considered to have failed to 
maintain such status and shall depart the 
United States or be subject to removal under sec-
tion 237(a)(1)(C)(i) of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act (8 U.S.C. 1188(a)(1)(C)(i)). 
(3) ENFORCEMENT.—The Secretary of Labor 
shall be responsible for conducting investiga-
tions and random audits of employers to ensure 
compliance with the employment-related re-
quirements of this section, consistent with sec-
tion 218(m) of the Immigration and Nationality 
Act (8 U.S.C. 1188(m)). The Secretary of Labor 
shall have the authority to collect reasonable 
civil penalties for violations, which shall be uti-
lized by the Secretary for the administration 
and enforcement of the provisions of this sec-
tion. 
(4) ELIGIBILITY FOR SERVICES.—Section 305 of 
Public Law 99–603 (100 Stat. 3434) is amended by 
striking ‘‘other employment rights as provided 
in the worker’s specific contract under which 
the nonimmigrant was admitted’’ and inserting 
‘‘employment-related rights’’. 
(c) REPORT.—Not later than 6 months before 
the end of the third fiscal year of the pilot pro-
gram, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
consultation with the Secretary of Labor and 
the Secretary of Agriculture, shall prepare and 
submit to the Committees on the Judiciary of the 
House of Representatives and the Senate, a re-

and affordable housing for low-income residents 
and farm laborers, by— 
‘‘(1) reducing or eliminating interest; 
‘‘(2) deferring loan payments; 
‘‘(3) subordinating, reducing, or reamortizing

ant to subsection (c), the Secretary shall offer to 
renew the rental assistance contract under sec-
tion 521(a)(2) for a 20-year term that is subject

‘‘(e) RESTRICTIVE USE AGREEMENTS.— 
‘‘(1) REQUIREMENT.—As part of the preserva-
tion and revitalization agreement for a project,

EXTENSION
OF
RENTAL
ASSISTANCE 
CONTRACT.—Except when the Secretary enters 
into a 20-year extension of the rental assistance

tive use agreement for the project shall be con-
sistent with the term of the restructured loan for 
the project. 
‘‘(B) EXTENSION OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE CON-

extension of the rental assistance contract for a 
project, the term of the restrictive use agreement 
for the project shall be for 20 years.

nate the 20-year use restrictive use agreement 
for a project prior to the end of its term if the 
20-year rental assistance contract for the project 
with the owner is terminated at any time for 
reasons outside the owner’s control. 
‘‘(f) DECOUPLING OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE.— 
‘‘(1) RENEWAL
OF
RENTAL
ASSISTANCE
CON-
TRACT.—If the Secretary determines that a ma-
turing loan for a project cannot reasonably be

ance under section 521, the Secretary may renew 
the rental assistance contract, notwithstanding 
any provision of section 521, for a term, subject 
to annual appropriations, of at least 10 years 
but not more than 20 years. 
‘‘(2) RENTS.—Any agreement to extend the 
term of the rental assistance contract under sec-
tion 521 for a project shall obligate the owner to 
continue to maintain the project as decent, safe

opment in accordance with this title, except that 
rents shall be based on the lesser of— 
‘‘(A) the budget-based needs of the project; or 
‘‘(B) the operating cost adjustment factor as a 
payment standard as provided under section 524 
of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and 
Affordability Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 1437 note).

NICAL ASSISTANCE.—Under the program under 
this section, the Secretary may provide grants to 
qualified non-profit organizations and public 
housing agencies to provide technical assist-
ance, including financial and legal services, to 
borrowers under loans under this title for multi-
family housing to facilitate the acquisition of 
such multifamily housing properties in areas 
where the Secretary determines there is a risk of 
loss of affordable housing. 
‘‘(h) TRANSFER OF RENTAL ASSISTANCE.—After 
the loan or loans for a rental project originally 
financed under section 515 or both sections 514 
and 516 have matured or have been prepaid and 
the owner has chosen not to restructure the 
loan pursuant to subsection (c), a tenant resid-
ing in such project shall have 18 months prior to 
loan maturation or prepayment to transfer the 
rental assistance assigned to the tenant’s unit to 
another rental project originally financed under 
section 515 or both sections 514 and 516, and the

‘‘(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Homeland 
Security (referred to in this section as the ‘Sec-
retary’) shall establish and administer an elec-

force Modernization Act of 2021), and using the 
employment eligibility confirmation system es-
tablished under section 404 of such Act (8 U.S.C. 
1324a note) (as so in effect) as a foundation, 
through which the Secretary shall— 
‘‘(A) respond to inquiries made by persons or 
entities seeking to verify the identity and em-
ployment authorization of individuals that such 
persons or entities seek to hire, or to recruit or 
refer for a fee, for employment in the United

shall provide confirmation or a tentative non-
confirmation of an individual’s identity and em-
ployment authorization as soon as practicable, 
but not later than 3 calendar days after the ini-
tial inquiry.

inquiries submitted by persons or entities; 
‘‘(C) to maximize the reliability of the System 
and to register each instance when the System is 
unable to receive inquiries; 
‘‘(D) to protect the privacy and security of the 
personally identifiable information maintained 
by or submitted to the System; 
‘‘(E) to provide direct notification of an in-
quiry to an individual with respect to whom the 
inquiry is made, including the results of such 
inquiry, and information related to the process 
for challenging the results, in cases in which the 
individual has established a user account as de-
scribed in paragraph (4)(B) or an electronic mail 
address for the individual is submitted by the 
person or entity at the time the inquiry is made; 
and 
‘‘(F) to maintain appropriate administrative, 
technical, and physical safeguards to prevent 
misuse of the System and unfair immigration-re-
lated employment practices.

AND OTHER FORMS OF FRAUD.—To prevent iden-
tity theft and other forms of fraud, the Sec-
retary shall design and operate the System with

the photograph on the document presented by 
the individual.

OF
IDENTIFYING
INFORMATION.—The

authorization; 
‘‘(ii) receive electronic notification when the 
individual’s social security account number or

the Commissioner in order to validate (or not 
validate) the information provided by the person 
or entity with respect to an individual whose

nonconfirmation not later than 10 business days 
after the date of the receipt of the notice de-
scribed in clause (ii); and 
‘‘(II) the Secretary to issue a confirmation or 
final nonconfirmation of an individual’s iden-
tity and employment authorization not later

days after receipt, notify such individual in 
writing in a language understood by the indi-
vidual and on a form designated by the Sec-
retary, that shall include a description of the 
individual’s right to contest the tentative non-
confirmation. The person or entity shall attest, 
under penalty of perjury, that the person or en-
tity provided (or attempted to provide) such no-
tice to the individual, and the individual shall 
acknowledge receipt of such notice in a manner 
specified by the Secretary. 
‘‘(iii) NO CONTEST.— 
‘‘(I) IN
GENERAL.—A tentative nonconfirma-
tion shall become final if, upon receiving the no-
tice described in clause (ii), the individual— 
‘‘(aa) refuses to acknowledge receipt of such 
notice; 
‘‘(bb) acknowledges in writing, in a manner 
specified by the Secretary, that the individual 
will not contest the tentative nonconfirmation; 
or 
‘‘(cc) fails to contest the tentative noncon-
firmation within the 10-business-day period be-
ginning on the date the individual received such 
notice. 
‘‘(II) RECORD OF NO CONTEST.—The person or 
entity shall indicate in the System that the indi-
vidual did not contest the tentative noncon-
firmation and shall specify the reason the ten-
tative nonconfirmation became final under sub-

sion of any fact with respect to any violation of 
this Act or any other provision of law. 
‘‘(iv) CONTEST.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—An individual may contest 
a tentative nonconfirmation by using the ten-
tative nonconfirmation review process under

ON
TERMINATION.—In no

ment or take any adverse employment action 
against an individual for failure to obtain con-
firmation of the individual’s identity and em-
ployment authorization until the person or enti-
ty receives a notice of final nonconfirmation 
from the System. Nothing in this subclause shall 
prohibit an employer from terminating the em-
ployment of the individual for any other lawful 
reason. 
‘‘(III) CONFIRMATION OR FINAL NONCONFIRMA-
TION.—The Secretary, in consultation with the 
Commissioner, shall issue notice of a confirma-
tion or final nonconfirmation of the individual’s

testing the tentative nonconfirmation. 
‘‘(E) FINAL NONCONFIRMATION.— 
‘‘(i) NOTICE.—If a person or entity receives a 
final nonconfirmation of an individual’s iden-
tity or employment authorization, the person or 
entity shall, not later than 3 business days after

confirmation in writing, on a form designated 
by the Secretary, which shall include informa-
tion regarding the individual’s right to appeal 
the final nonconfirmation as provided under 
subparagraph (F). The person or entity shall at-
test, under penalty of perjury, that the person 
or entity provided (or attempted to provide) the 
notice to the individual, and the individual 
shall acknowledge receipt of such notice in a 
manner designated by the Secretary. 
‘‘(ii) TERMINATION OR NOTIFICATION OF CON-
TINUED EMPLOYMENT.—If a person or entity re-
ceives a final nonconfirmation regarding an in-
dividual, the person or entity may terminate em-
ployment of the individual. If the person or en-
tity does not terminate such employment pend-
ing appeal of the final nonconfirmation, the 
person or entity shall notify the Secretary of 
such fact through the System. Failure to notify 
the Secretary in accordance with this clause 
shall 
be 
deemed 
a 
violation 
of 
section 
274A(a)(1)(A). 
‘‘(iii) PRESUMPTION OF VIOLATION FOR CONTIN-
UED EMPLOYMENT.—If a person or entity con-
tinues to employ an individual after receipt of a 
final nonconfirmation, there shall be a rebutta-
ble presumption that the person or entity has 
violated paragraphs (1)(A) and (a)(2) of section 
274A(a). 
‘‘(F) APPEAL OF FINAL NONCONFIRMATION.— 
‘‘(i) ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL.—The Secretary, 
in consultation with the Commissioner, shall de-
velop a process by which an individual may seek 
administrative review of a final nonconfirma-
tion. Such process shall— 
‘‘(I) permit the individual to submit additional 
evidence establishing identity or employment 
authorization; 
‘‘(II) ensure prompt resolution of an appeal 
(but in no event shall there be a failure to re-
spond to an appeal within 30 days); and 
‘‘(III) permit the Secretary to impose a civil 
money penalty (not to exceed $500) on an indi-
vidual upon finding that an appeal was frivo-
lous or filed for purposes of delay. 
‘‘(ii) COMPENSATION FOR LOST WAGES RESULT-
ING FROM GOVERNMENT ERROR OR OMISSION.— 
‘‘(I) IN GENERAL.—If, upon consideration of 
an appeal of a final nonconfirmation, the Sec-
retary determines that the final nonconfirma-
tion was issued in error, the Secretary shall fur-
ther determine whether the final nonconfirma-
tion was the result of government error or omis-
sion. If the Secretary determines that the final 
nonconfirmation was solely the result of govern-
ment error or omission and the individual was 
terminated from employment, the Secretary shall 
compensate the individual for lost wages. 
‘‘(II) CALCULATION
OF
LOST
WAGES.—Lost 
wages shall be calculated based on the wage 
rate and work schedule that were in effect prior 
to the individual’s termination. The individual 
shall be compensated for lost wages beginning 
on the first scheduled work day after employ-
ment was terminated and ending 90 days after 
completion of the administrative review process 
described in this subparagraph or the day the 
individual is reinstated or obtains other employ-
ment, whichever occurs first. 
‘‘(III) LIMITATION
ON
COMPENSATION.—No 
compensation for lost wages shall be awarded 
for any period during which the individual was 
not authorized for employment in the United 
States. 
‘‘(IV) SOURCE OF FUNDS.—There is established 
in the general fund of the Treasury, a separate 
account which shall be known as the ‘Electronic 
Verification Compensation Account’. Fees col-
lected under subsections (f) and (g) shall be de-
posited in the Electronic Verification Compensa-
tion Account and shall remain available for 
purposes of providing compensation for lost 
wages under this subclause.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill,

The gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER) and the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. JORDAN) each will control 30 min-

The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1603. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself 21⁄2 minutes. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1603, the Farm 
Workforce Modernization Act of 2021 
addresses an issue of critical national 
importance: the growing labor chal-
lenges that are damaging the American 
agriculture sector. 
Solving this issue is paramount to 
the sustainability of American farm-
ing. It is also a matter of food security, 
and thus, national security. As domes-
tic food outputs decline, we have be-
come more dependent on food imports 
and more vulnerable to food contami-
nation. The COVID–19 pandemic ex-
posed these vulnerabilities as travel re-
strictions impacted our food supply 
chain, and over 500,000 farmworkers 
tested positive for the virus. 
With fewer U.S. workers turning to 
agricultural work as their chosen pur-
suit, most of today’s hired farm labor-
ers are foreign-born. Unfortunately, 
our immigration laws have not been 
updated to reflect the needs of our 21st 
century economy. 
As a result of these outdated laws, 
undocumented workers now comprise 
about half of the U.S. workforce. But 
they are living and working in a state 
of uncertainty and fear, which contrib-
utes to the destabilization of farms 
across the Nation. 
H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act, addresses these chal-
lenges head on. The bill provides tem-
porary status to current farmworkers 
with an optional path to a green card 
for those who continue to work in agri-
culture. The bill also addresses the Na-
tion’s future labor needs by modern-
izing the H–2A temporary visa pro-
gram, while ensuring fair wages and 
workplace conditions for all farm-
workers. 
This is a bipartisan, balanced solu-
tion, one that we should all be able to 
get behind. It is a victory for farmers 
who have struggled with persistent 
labor shortages for decades. 
It is also a victory for farmworkers 
who have worked tirelessly in the field 
growing and harvesting food without 
proper labor protections or any guar-
antee that they can remain in this 
country. No acceptable solution can 
fail to deal with this reality. That is 
why H.R. 1603 is the right solution. 
Madam Speaker, I hope my col-
leagues will vote today in favor of pro-
viding a seat at America’s table for 
those who have long grown the food we 
serve on it. 
Madam Speaker, I thank my friend 
and colleague, Ms. LOFGREN of Cali-
fornia, the chair of the Immigration 
Subcommittee, for her leadership and 
steadfast commitment to the bipar-
tisan process that led to today’s vote 
on the Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues to support our farmers and our 
farmworkers by supporting this bill, 
and I reserve the balance of my time. 
b 1430 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), the rank-
ing member of the Immigration and 
Citizenship Subcommittee. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
it was no accident that when we finally 
won control of the border and cut the 
flow of low-wage labor, Americans saw 
the strongest wage growth in 40 years, 
the lowest unemployment rate in 50 
years, and the lowest poverty rate in 60 
years. For the first time in decades, 
the wage gap between rich and poor 
narrowed. 
Now, this bill extends amnesty, green 
cards, and a path to citizenship to 
somewhere between 1 and 21⁄2 million il-
legal immigrants now working in agri-
culture and their families in a manner 
that will depress wages, not just in ag-
riculture, but in every field of the 
economy for years to come. 
Madam Speaker, if you obeyed the 
law and came here legally to work, 
then you cannot qualify as a certified 
agricultural worker. You must have 
come here illegally, and you must have 
worked here illegally for at least 1,035 
hours in the last 2 years. That is about 
13 40-hour workweeks a year. You get 
legal status for yourself and your fam-
ily for the next 51⁄2 years. You can get 
indefinite extensions as long as you 
work in agriculture 575 hours or about 
14 weeks a year. If you do this for be-
tween 4 and 8 years and you get a green 
card, then your family gets green cards 
and you are on a 5-year path to citizen-
ship. The green cards give you the 
right to work in direct competition 
with American workers in any sector 
of the economy. 
Madam Speaker, let me emphasize 
that if you came here legally and 
worked the same hours, then you are 
out of luck. If you obeyed the laws, 
well, you are just a schmuck. 
It utterly escapes me how America’s 
working families are helped by flooding 
the labor market with millions of low- 
wage workers under this program. As 
these workers get green cards, they are 
sure to move from agriculture to high- 
paying jobs, ensuring a continuous 
need for new agricultural workers to 
replace them. 
Between the two immigration bills 
today, somewhere north of 4 million il-
legal immigrants will qualify for am-
nesty, legal employment, and a path to 
citizenship as a reward for breaking 
our laws. 
Is it any wonder that our Border Pa-
trol is now completely overwhelmed as 
millions of economic refugees rush our 
border in expectation of the same re-
wards? 
This bill would bring a tragic end to 
the blue-collar economic boom that 
President Trump proudly announced on 
this floor just a year ago. Here is the 
real tragedy: During the Trump blue- 
collar boom, the poorest Americans 
were making the greatest gains, and it 
is precisely these American families 
who will be the most harmed by these 
amnesty bills. 
Trump had their back. Biden is on 
their backs. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN). 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, our 
country has come through a pandemic, 
and many of us have suffered, but there 
is one thing that we can be grateful 
for, and that is that the food chain was 
never disrupted. 
Throughout the pandemic, we could 
go to the grocery store and there would 
be food in that store. For that, we need 
to thank the farmers of this country. 
But we also need to thank the farm-
workers of this country, a majority of 
whom are undocumented and a major-
ity of whom have been here more than 
10 years. 
What this bill does and how it was 
formed is important. I want to thank 
Representatives DAN NEWHOUSE, MIKE 
SIMPSON, DOUG
LAMALFA, and many 
others on the Republican side of the 
aisle. I worked with JIM COSTA, JIMMY 
PANETTA, and many others to try to 
see if we could come together to come 
up with solutions for the challenges 
that we face in farm country. 
We pulled together growers and the 
farmworkers union to talk together for 
solutions. It took us almost a year of 
growers and the farmworkers union, 
and Republicans and Democrats, sit-
ting around a table to come up with 
this bill. 
It has basically three provisions. 
The first recognizes that we have had 
undocumented 
farmworkers 
in

fields for decades. It allows them to get 
a certified agricultural worker card so 
that they can work without fear. That 
is a temporary worker status. They can 
renew it, travel, pay taxes, and con-
tinue forever in that status. After 
working for a long period of time, they 
and their families have the option of 
applying for legal permanent residence 
if they choose. 
The second provision streamlines an 
existing program, the H–2A program, 
so that we will have a legal supply of 
farmworkers in the future. Both labor 
and employers agreed to those stream-
lines. 
The final provision says that if we 
have a system that works, then we 
need to enforce that system. We are 
going to have the E-Verify system used 
in agriculture after this bill is fully 
implemented. 
Who is in favor of this? The Arizona 
Nursery Association, California Farm 
Bureau Federation, Georgia Milk Pro-
ducers, Michigan Greenhouse Growers 
Council, Minnesota Milk Producers As-
sociation, Ohio Produce Growers Mar-
keting Association, Texas Association

Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
ask that we come together and pass 
this bill. America will be stronger and 
better if we do. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the balance of my time to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
MCCLINTOCK) to control the remainder 
of the time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from California will control the 
time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Arizona (Mr. BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Madam Speaker, while 
the Biden inhumane border crisis rages 
on the southern border, we are here 
today, once again, debating amnesty 
for illegal aliens. 
Promising amnesty to those who are 
already here illegally encourages more 
aliens to come illegally. All data for 
the last 35 years shows that there is 
this correlative relationship. 
Instead of voting on amnesty, we 
should be voting on real reforms to 
close loopholes and remove incentives 
for aliens to come here illegally. That 
is why I reintroduced the Fund and 
Complete the Border Wall Act earlier 
this year and introduced the Stopping 
Border Surges Act earlier this week. 
These bills include real reforms that 
will have real impacts. 
The Stopping Border Surges Act fixes 
problems caused by the Flores settle-
ment agreement that prevents DHS 
from detaining family units for more 
than 20 days, ensures that unaccom-
panied alien children are quickly and 
safely returned home, and promotes in-
creased integrity in the asylum sys-
tem. 
This bill, however, will actually 
cause more problems than it will solve. 
It has serious flaws that will lead to 
fraud and abuse. 
This bill gives the Secretary broad 
authority to waive grounds of inadmis-
sibility for humanitarian purposes, 
family unity, or because the waiver is 
otherwise in the public interest. What 
that means is that convicted criminals 
will have an opportunity to gain am-
nesty. 
This bill invites fraudulent applica-
tions because under this bill, Madam 
Speaker, if you apply for amnesty, 
your receipt serves as your authoriza-
tion to work. All you have to do is 
apply for the amnesty and you will be 
able to work legally. There is no way 
that this will not lead to fraudulent fil-
ings. 
This bill establishes grant programs 
that use taxpayer dollars to help ille-
gal aliens apply for amnesty. Instead of 
spending taxpayer dollars to facilitate 
amnesty, we should focus on reducing 
the deficit. This bill does nothing to se-
cure the border or close loopholes in 
our immigration laws that encourage 
illegal immigration. 
Now, I address something that was 
said in the last debate. One of the Rep-
resentatives said that no Republican 
has taken her up on going to the bor-
der. That is not accurate. When she an-
nounced that in the Judiciary Com-
mittee, I said that I will go with you, 
that I want to go with you. 
We agreed I would go. Our staffs ar-
ranged it. My flight reservations were 
made, and within about 3 days before 
going, I was told that there is no more 
room for you on this trip. 
So, it wasn’t accurate to say that no 
Republican has taken her up on it. I 
took her up on it. 
I will tell you this, Madam Speaker, 
when the Speaker says the reason to 
support the previous bill is that 75 per-
cent of Americans support amnesty, 
well, if you are going to rely on polling 
data, I would inform you that a recent 
poll said that 75 percent of Americans 
support the use of voter ID. Let’s go 
ahead and fix that then if we are going 
to rely on voting information to pass 
good policy. 
Let’s reinstitute voter ID, and let’s 
vote ‘‘no’’ on this bill. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. GARCIA). 
Ms. GARCIA of Texas. Madam Speak-
er, I rise in strong support of this bill. 
Agricultural workers are crucial to our 
economy, and this bill would establish 
a legal and reliable farm workforce. 
I support this bill because it recog-
nizes the humanity—yes, the human-
ity—of farmworkers and their families. 
This is personal to me. I grew up 
poor, picking cotton in the fields of 
south Texas. I can testify firsthand 
about 
the 
incredibly 
hard, 
back-
breaking work that farmworkers do, 
especially in the heat of the south 
Texas sun. Not much seems to have 
changed since I worked in the fields. 
Things pretty much still are handled 
about the same. 
This bill is long overdue and would 
provide farmworkers with important 
worker protections and legal rights 
that I never had and that they des-
perately need today. Texas is home to 
nearly 250,000 farms, and the need for a 
strong agricultural workforce is vital. 
It is vital to Texas; it is vital to this 
country; and it is vital to this world. 
Madam Speaker, I urge passage. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from California for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I hear a lot from my 
colleagues on the other side of the aisle 
that this is not how people should be 
treated, whether it was with respect to 
the first broader amnesty bill, with re-
spect to the Dreamers, or whether it is 
this bill with respect to farmworkers, 
which is, in fact, an amnesty bill. But 
the fact of the matter is that nobody 
on this side of the aisle and nobody I 
know in Texas disagrees that the sys-
tem is broken and that we need to 
make sure that people are treated fair-
ly and treated appropriately. Nobody 
disagrees with that. 
The problem is that what we are 
doing is putting this bill in front of any 
kind of enforcement mechanisms that 
will prevent the continued abuse of 
human beings because we refuse to do 
our actual job under the Constitution 
of the United States to secure our bor-
der. 
We are just refusing to do it, and 
then we pass legislation in the name of 
helping people who, yes, are stuck in a 
system because we created this system 
because it is so badly broken. You then 
create the magnet, Madam Speaker, 
that empowers cartels and continues 
the vicious cycle. 
Today, when this passes off the floor, 
there will be a lot of backslapping and 
congratulations: Isn’t this great, isn’t 
this awesome, and aren’t we so proud 
of ourselves for what we are doing for 
these immigrants, these workers? 
But we are not doing a darn thing to 
actually fix the system that prevents 
the flow, prevents the danger, prevents 
the cartels, prevents the abuses, and

prevents essentially the indentured 
servitude that this bill would actually 
create for the farmworkers in question, 
leaving them stuck with Band-Aids of 
having to work certain hours as farm-
workers, continuing the process, by the 
way, while we continue to encourage 
sex 
trafficking, 
human 
trafficking, 
crimes, violations, and children being 
abused. 
As I said before, as we sit here in this 
august body—not actually amending, 
by the way, just bloviating—while we 
are sitting here, some little girl is get-
ting raped in Mexico on a journey be-
cause of the pressure that we are caus-
ing by empowering cartels to do it. 
That is occurring, and we are just 
whistling, and we are just sitting here, 
burying our head in the sand. 
Like I said, go give the press con-
ferences and go pat ourselves on the 
back as a body for being pro-immi-
grant. How is it pro-immigrant to have 
wide-open borders being exploited by 
cartels, wide-open borders with nar-
cotics coming across, and wide-open 
borders with human beings coming 
across it? 
By the way, when the media says this 
Biden crisis has ended, if they ever ac-
knowledge it exists, it will be because 
numbers are going down in facilities 
because catching and releasing is going 
up. That is what is going to occur. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the gentleman from Texas an ad-
ditional 30 seconds. 
Mr. ROY. Madam Speaker, that is 
what is going to occur. My fellow citi-
zens back home in Texas and Ameri-
cans, when those numbers go down in 
facilities, don’t kid yourselves; illegal 
immigration will continue. 
They will be catching and releasing 
illegal immigrants. They will be drop-
ping numbers down at facilities. They 
will close the FEMA facility in Mid-
land. We will have as much illegal im-
migration as we have right now, and 
the other side will claim: Oh, the crisis 
is going down. 
That is what is coming at us. And 
today, we are passing amnesty instead 
of securing the border of the United 
States. 
b 1445 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Arizona (Mr. STANTON). 
Mr. STANTON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank Chairman NADLER
and Chair-
woman LOFGREN
for their incredible 
leadership on this important bill. 
I rise in support of the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act, a bipartisan 
bill that will improve the H–2A agricul-
tural visa program to make it easier 
for Arizona farmers to meet their 
workforce needs while also providing a 
path for agricultural workers to earn 
legal status. 
Throughout this pandemic, farm-
workers have been on the front lines 
playing a critical role in feeding Amer-
ica’s families. They deserve the oppor-
tunity to take steps toward legal sta-
tus in this country. It is the right 
thing to do for them and it is the right 
thing to do to advance our farm indus-
try. 
This bill is good for Arizona’s econ-
omy—Arizona, the birth place of Cesar 
Chavez—where agribusiness is a $23 bil-
lion-a-year industry. Our State’s crops 
cannot be left to rot in the ground be-
cause we lack access to a stable work-
force. 
Passing this bill today brings us one 
step closer to ensuring that farmers 
have the stable workforce they need 
and that farmworkers are recognized 
for all the work they do for us every 
day. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 21⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from Georgia (Mr. HICE). 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Madam Speak-
er, I thank the gentleman from Cali-
fornia for yielding. 
It is stunning to me that we are still 
wrestling through these type of issues. 
We have been watching over the last 
few months one radical piece of legisla-
tion after another and our country is 
beginning to suffer. We are watching 
gas prices go up, skyrocketing. We are 
still shutting businesses down. We are 
still seeing schools closed. We are 
watching our energy independence be 
reversed. 
Madam Speaker, it is one horrible 
bill, one horrible policy after another. 
And now we are watching a catas-
trophe on our southern border, and my 
friends on the other side of the aisle 
appear to not care what is happening 
at the southern border. 
We haven’t honestly called it for 
what it is: a disaster. 
We are not willing to look at the na-
tional security issues of it. We are not 
willing to look at the danger that is oc-
curring, the cartels, the human traf-
ficking, the drug trafficking, the crimi-
nals who, perhaps, are coming across 
our border, the terrorists who may be 
coming across our border. 
And now what are we doing? 
We are looking at another out-
rageous piece of legislation that says: 
if you come work on a farm, we are 
going to give you amnesty. It doesn’t 
matter 
what 
your 
background. 
It 
doesn’t matter who you are. 
At the same time, we even have here 
around Capitol Hill fences guarding us, 
guarding the American people from the 
people’s House, but we are going to 
open up our borders for who knows who 
to come marching through. 
Now we have a piece of legislation 
that says: just come work on a farm 
and we are going to give you amnesty. 
Madam Speaker, 1.5 million people 
are going to become citizens for work-
ing minimal time on farms. 
This is going to shield criminals. 
They are just going to come across the 
border, claim amnesty, come work on a 
farm, and before long, they are legal 
citizens here. 
We don’t know who these people are. 
We don’t know what their intentions 
are, but we are going to grant them 
amnesty through this bill. It is non-
sense. It is frightening. It is irrespon-
sible. It is endangering American lives. 
It is encouraging even more disaster 
and danger on our southern border. 
It makes absolutely zero sense for us 
to proceed with this type of irrespon-
sible legislation, and I urge my col-
leagues to vote against this. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON 
LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
as I stood on the floor of the House for 
H.R. 6, this is not amnesty. I thank the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN) for her leadership, and Mr. NAD-
LER as well. 
Madam Speaker, let me explain to 
you that under the American Dream 
and Promise Act, which immigrants 
are eligible for, they would have 43,500 
homes and $340 million in mortgage 
payments. 
Today, I rise in support of H.R. 1603 
because this would allow farmworkers, 
agricultural workers, to be able to gain 
legal status and to be able to seek a 
certified agricultural worker status. 
Dr. RUIZ, our colleague, indicated 
that he was raised by farmworkers. He 
saw the bent hands, the bent banks, 
and the broken hands, and he saw the 
patriotism. This is not amnesty. I will 
tell you what it is not. It is not the 
Trump policy of caging children in 
cages. It is not the Trump policy of 
turning young 11-year-olds back across 
the border to be raped. 
I hope my colleagues who are talking 
about abortion and talking about rape 
voted for the Violence Again Women 
Act 
to 
really 
protect 
immigrant 
women. 
I rise to support this legislation be-
cause it will provide dignity, oppor-
tunity for an enhanced economic en-
gine, as the farmworkers take certified 
status because they can do it over and 
over again. 
Where is the bread on our table com-
ing from? 
The hardworking farmworkers who 
are out there every day in these fields 
working to provide for the American 
people and the people around the 
world. 
We are the breadbasket of the world 
and, because of their work, we are able 
to feed many. So I rise in enthusiastic 
support. I wish my colleagues would 
have been as enthusiastic and as angry 
about caging children as they are 
today about us fixing the immigration 
system. 
Madam Speaker, I ask for support of 
H.R. 1603. 
Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 1603, the bipartisan ‘‘Farm Workforce 
Modernization Act,’’ which will stabilize the ag-
ricultural sector and preserve our rural herit-
age by ensuring that farmers can meet their 
labor needs well into the future. 
First, the bill establishes a program for agri-
cultural workers in the United States (and their 
spouses and minor children) to earn legal sta-
tus through continued agricultural employment.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1553 
March 18, 2021 
Specifically, the bill creates a process for 
farm workers to seek Certified Agricultural 
Worker status, a temporary status for those 
who have worked at least 180 days in agri-
culture over the prior 2-year period. 
Certified Agricultural Worker status can be 
renewed indefinitely with continued farm work 
(at least 100 days per year). 
Applicants 
must 
undergo 
background 
checks and pass strict criminal and national 
security bars. 
Dependent status is available for spouses 
and minor children. 
The bill does not require workers to do or 
apply for anything else in order to stay and 
work in the United States. 
But long-term workers who want to stay 
have the option of earning a path to lawful 
permanent residence by paying a $1,000 fine 
and engaging additional agricultural work, as 
follows: 
1. Workers with 10 years of agricultural 
work prior to the date of enactment must com-
plete 4 additional years of such work. 
2. Workers with less than 10 years of agri-
cultural work prior to the date of enactment 
must complete 8 additional years of such 
work. 
The Farmworkers Movement in this country 
was started and led by a great leader, Cesar 
Chavez who said: 
We cannot seek achievement for ourselves 
and forget about progress and prosperity for 
our community. Our ambitions must be 
broad enough to include the aspirations and 
needs of others, for their sakes and for our 
own. 
The Texas Farm Workers Union (‘‘TFWU’’) 
was established by Antonio Orendain and 
farmworker leaders of the Rio Grande Valley 
active with the United Farm Workers (UFW) 
after a disagreement with UFW leadership 
over direction of a melon strike in south 
McAllen, TX in 1975. 
In August 1975, nearly ten years after he 
began organizing farm workers for the United 
Farm Workers in the Rio Grande Valley of 
South Texas. 
Antonio Orendain worked for Cesar Chavez 
in the Chicago UFW national grape and let-
tuce boycott office. 
Farmworkers undertake some of the tough-
est jobs in America. 
They have earned the opportunity to build 
their lives without the fear of being uprooted 
from their families and their communities. 
The bipartisan Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act empowers the economic and physical 
well-being of immigrant families while pro-
viding much-needed labor security for our na-
tion’s farms. 
The agricultural industry relies on the labor 
of 2.4 million farmworkers—about half of 
whom are undocumented. 
This bill would protect thousands of families 
from deportation. 
This is a big step in making our immigration 
system more humane and more efficient. 
I know the farming and agricultural commu-
nities in the state of Texas farm and my dis-
trict borders communities that farm. 
What we are doing here is the right thing 
and attempting to reinforce the breadbasket 
that the United States happens to be to the 
world. 
I have heard the clamoring of farm workers 
for a very long time but I have also heard the 
need for fairness and the improvement of con-
ditions that they are working in with adequate 
compensation. 
This bill regularizes people who want to be 
regularized and who want to contribute to 
helping the agricultural industry in this great 
nation. 
I would like to thank my Judiciary Com-
mittee colleagues on both sides of the aisle, 
and in particular, Chairman NADLER and Sub-
committee Chairwoman LOFGREN, for their 
work in shepherding this important legislation 
to the floor. 
I am reminded of our tenure here on the Ju-
diciary Committee and our record of being fair 
and bipartisan on immigration reform for at 
least 2 decades. 
I urge all members to join me in voting for 
H.R. 1603, the Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act of 2021. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I can assure the gentlewoman from 
Texas that we are outraged by the fact 
that this administration’s policies and 
pronouncements have encouraged thou-
sands upon thousands of children to be 
placed on that trail of terror in the 
hands of Mexican criminal cartels and 
brought here on the expectation of ad-
mission, an expectation that this ad-
ministration is fulfilling. 
I must also assure the gentlewoman 
that this certainly is an amnesty bill. 
It allows anyone who is here illegally, 
who can claim to have worked the 
equivalent of 13 40-hour weeks over 2 
years, legal status, amnesty. The docu-
mentation can be as little as having a 
friend vouch for them. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentlewoman from Texas. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me say that 
we can respect each other’s differences, 
and I thank the gentleman for explain-
ing that. Amnesty is not related to 
people working to earn their status, 
and that is what this bill does, just as 
the DACA bill does. They earn their 
status. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
reclaiming my time. 
This only applies to illegal aliens. If 
you are legally here, obeying our laws, 
you are out of luck with this bill. What 
this bill says is, if you are here ille-
gally and can have a friend vouch for 
you that you worked 1,000 hours over 
the last 2 years in agriculture—again, 
that is the equivalent of 13 40-hour 
weeks—you get legal status. 
This is one of the many reasons why 
we are seeing this response from 
around the world now flooding our 
southern border. 
Madam Speaker, I am pleased to 
yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from Indiana (Mrs. SPARTZ). 
Mrs. SPARTZ. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, it is unfortunate 
that Congress cannot have a serious 
conversation about immigration be-
cause we do actually have a real prob-
lem. We have a real crisis at the bor-
der. It is a humanitarian crisis, the 
Wild West. We are a country of laws. 
We have a problem with illegal immi-
gration. It needs to be streamlined to 
better serve our national interests. We 
have problems with visa processes, and 
we can do better. 
But, unfortunately, we are passing a 
lot of bills that probably will not see 
the light of day in the Senate, that are 
not going to become legislation. We do 
grandstanding 
drama 
and 
constant 
rhetoric, and it is very unfortunate for 
me because the American people are 
tired of our institution not doing its 
work, because we are policymakers and 
we are legislators and we have to work 
on policy, not on political drama. 
So as a member of the Subcommittee 
on Immigration and Citizenship, I en-
courage my colleagues to actually 
start working in committees on legis-
lation, not sending legislation from the 
Speaker’s office to the floor, but actu-
ally have reforms and work at it be-
cause our people deserve it and our 
people deserve to have a branch that 
works for the people, not having the 
executive and judicial branches doing 
our functions. 
So I hope we will have some very 
constructive and serious conversation 
on immigration, and I would be happy 
to help with it, but these piecemeal ap-
proaches are not going to work and are 
not good for our country. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Idaho (Mr. SIMPSON). 
Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the Farm Workforce Moderniza-
tion Act. 
For years, my constituents have been 
asking me to fix our Nation’s broken 
immigration system. They have told 
me that the shortage of legal workers 
in agriculture is wreaking havoc on our 
farmers in rural communities. 
That is why I joined with my good 
friends, 
Representatives 
NEWHOUSE, 
DIAZ-BALART, and LAMALFA to come up 
with a bipartisan solution to this prob-
lem. Along with Chairwoman LOFGREN 
and other Democratic colleagues, we 
crafted a bill to create a merit-based 
agricultural immigration system for 
our Nation’s food producers, and make 
much-needed reforms in the H–2A pro-
gram. 
But don’t just take my word for it. 
There are over 250 agricultural indus-
try groups from all across America 
that have written to Congress to sup-
port this bill. From potatoes and dairy 
in my district to citrus and straw-
berries in Florida and California, grow-
ers agree that this bill is good for agri-
culture and good for our country. 
But I want to take a moment to ad-
dress the current situation on our 
southern border. What is happening 
there is a crisis and we must address it. 
We all realize that. Unfortunately, 
years of congressional inaction has 
made ‘‘immigration’’ a toxic word. 
This bill is not about what is hap-
pening on the border, but that seems to 
be what all of the debate is about—

what is happening at the southern bor-
der. 
This bill is not amnesty. It does not 
grant anybody amnesty. It allows indi-
viduals to get right with the law and to 
become part of the legal workforce in 
the United States. It is about providing 
a stable legal workforce for the people 
who put food on our tables. 
This isn’t a perfect bill. No one would 
agree that it is. But it is a very good 
compromise that actually gives us a 
chance to solve a real problem for our 
constituents. That is why I came to 
Congress, to do those things, and I urge 
my colleagues to support this legisla-
tion. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
no one disputes that this bill is a huge 
windfall to big agriculture. The prob-
lem is that it comes at the expense of 
American workers. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentlewoman 
from 
Texas 
(Ms. 
ESCOBAR). 
Ms. ESCOBAR. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman for yielding. 
I will be very clear, Madam Speaker. 
Farmworkers do back-breaking work 
under the scorching sun or unbearable 
cold to make sure that all of us have 
food on our table. Whether they are 
sick, feeling well, whether they have 
family members who are not feeling 
well, they go to work to make sure we 
have what we need, even, and almost 
especially, during the era of COVID. 
It is incredible that anyone would 
stand in the way of having these in-
credible people finally have a pathway 
to legalization. 
The Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act is a piece of legislation that is long 
overdue. I have one thing to say to 
those who would oppose legislation for 
this population, even though they ben-
efit from the labor of this population: 
‘‘they don’t have shame,’’ ‘‘no tienen 
verguenza.’’ 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Wisconsin (Mr. TIFFANY). 
Mr. 
TIFFANY. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
while chaos reigns on the border, we 
have another Democrat jam job before 
us today. 
I would turn to the committee rank-
ing member, the gentleman from Cali-
fornia (Mr. MCCLINTOCK), for a col-
loquy. 
Did the gentleman see these bills in 
the committee? 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, I 
yield to the gentleman from California. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Not this session, 
no. 
Mr. TIFFANY. Madam Speaker, re-
claiming my time. 
These bills did not come before this 
committee. For someone like myself, 
who has just joined the committee, I 
did not even have a chance to be able 
to partake in this bill. 
I wanted to express concerns espe-
cially about the H–2A provision in this 
bill because I am familiar—there is a 
parallel to the J–1 visas that we use in 
northern Wisconsin in the resort area. 
They are temporary visas. And what 
we found over the years as employers is 
that people would figure out how to use 
the J–1 visa to get into the country, 
and then go job shopping from there. 
The H–2A is susceptible to the same 
thing. And due to lax enforcement, we 
could all live with it if there was good 
enforcement in America, but there is 
not good enforcement of our laws here 
in the United States. 
So let’s cut to the chase here. The 
gentleman from California touched on 
this very well. These bills devalue 
American workers’ labor. 
In 2019, the greatest increase in 
wages for people who are in the lower 
income brackets happened, the great-
est increases in decades. 
I just say to all of those working- 
class Americans out there: Make no 
mistake, these bills today are another 
clear message that you are viewed as 
replaceable. 
b 1500 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from California (Ms. PELOSI), the dis-
tinguished Speaker of the House. 
Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I sa-
lute the gentleman for the excellent 
work of his committee, bringing this 
important legislation, H.R. 1603, the 
Farm Workforce Modernization Act, to 
the floor. I thank the chairman for this 
critical victory for farmworkers and 
growers, who have come together in 
support of this legislation, this legisla-
tion which ensures that America can 
continue to feed the world. 
Thank you to Chair ZOE LOFGREN, 
chair of the Subcommittee on Immi-
gration and Citizenship, for her years 
of relentless leadership on behalf of 
farmworkers, without which this bill 
would not be possible. I sang her 
praises earlier as a former teacher of 
immigration, immigration lawyer, and 
chair of the Subcommittee on Immi-
gration and Citizenship. She knows of 
what she legislates. 
I think that it is clear to see there 
are a number of Californians involved 
in this. I want to salute Mr. COSTA and 
Mr. CARBAJAL, who are an important 
part of this. They represent farmland 
in California. They know the needs of 
the workers. They respect the involve-
ment of the growers. 
This, again, is a wonderful bill. We 
salute many Members, representing 
every corner of the country, whose vi-
sion and values have strengthened this 
bill that has truly been a caucus- and 
Congress-wide effort. 
Thank you to the United Farm Work-
ers for their outstanding organizing 
which made this possible. In addition 
to our work internally, their outside 
mobilization is so important. 
We are also inspired by the immortal 
words of our beloved Dolores Huerta: 
‘‘Yes, we can,’’ ‘‘Si, se puede.’’ Yes, we 
can; yes, we will; and, yes, we are doing 
it. It was an honor last year at this 
time to celebrate her 90th birthday in 
the Rayburn Room, the last event we 
had before COVID took over. So here 
we are a year later. This is probably a 
better celebration. 
Passing the Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act and doing so on a bipar-
tisan basis was a source of pride in the 
last Congress, and it is now. With a 
Democratic majority in the Senate and 
President Biden in the White House, 
when we pass it again, it is with better 
assurance that it will become law. 
The bill honors the millions of farm-
workers who are the backbone of our 
economy, quietly persevering through 
harsh working conditions and low 
wages as they power the farm economy 
and put food on our tables. 
As the U.S. Conference of Catholic 
Bishops has written: 
Recognizing the dignity of work of farm-
workers and their families is a central con-
cern. 
Farmworkers produce the food that we eat 
and contribute to the care of our commu-
nity. 
This legislation, while long overdue, 
is urgently needed now, in light of the 
coronavirus crisis, which is forcing our 
essential farmworkers to live and work 
under a cloud of fear and uncertainty 
about their health and their jobs. 
At the same time, the pandemic has 
accelerated a labor crisis in the farm 
economy that endangers farmers and 
producers and requires action. This ac-
tion today is an agreement between the 
growers and the farmworkers. 
This legislation supports workers and 
the farm economy with strong, smart 
reforms. 
This bill provides a path to legaliza-
tion for more than one million cur-
rently undocumented farmworkers. No 
one who works to feed our country 
should be condemned to permanent 
second-class status. 
This bill establishes the agricultural 
workforce of the future by modernizing 
the H–2A initiative to ensure that 
farms have stable, secure workforces. 
Critically, it demands fair, humane 
treatment for farmworkers by securing 
fairness in pay, improving access to 
quality housing, and ensuring robust 
safety and heat illness protections. 
Any of us who have visited farm-
workers in the fields—and some of our 
Members have been farmworkers them-
selves or children of farmworkers— 
know the environment, the heat, the 
chemicals, and the rest, are a chal-
lenge. 
This legislation is a critical step for-
ward for our workers, for our growers, 
and the farm economy, but our work is 
not done. 
Congress will continue to stabilize 
the farm economy, protect workers and 
families, and maintain America’s agri-
cultural preeminence in the world. 
Under the leadership of President 
Biden, we will continue our work to 
fundamentally, fully fix our broken im-
migration system so that we can honor

H1555 
March 18, 2021 
America’s proud immigrant heritage 
and advance a better future for all. 
Earlier, I quoted President Reagan. I 
want to do so again more fully. Earlier, 
when I spoke on the floor about Dream-
ers, I did so for 8 hours and 6 minutes. 
I promised earlier today to be shorter, 
and so I didn’t give as much of Presi-
dent Reagan’s speech. 
This is what he said: ‘‘And since this 
is the last speech that I will give as 
President, I think it’s fitting to leave 
one 
final 
thought, 
an 
observation 
about a country which I love.’’ 
He went on to talk about the Statue 
of Liberty, Madam Speaker. He said: 
‘‘The torch of Lady Liberty symbolizes 
our freedom and represents our herit-
age, the compact with our parents, our 
grandparents, and our ancestors. It is 
that lady who gives us our great and 
special place in the world. For it’s the 
great life force of each generation of 
new Americans that guarantees that 
America’s triumph shall continue un-
surpassed into the next century and be-
yond. Other countries may seek to 
compete with us; but in one vital area, 
as a beacon of freedom and opportunity 
that draws the people of the world, no 
country on Earth comes close.’’ 
As I said earlier, he said: ‘‘This, I be-
lieve, is one of the most important 
sources of America’s greatness. We lead 
the world because, unique among na-
tions, 
we 
draw 
our 
people—our 
strength—from 
every 
country 
and 
every corner of the world. And by doing 
so we continuously renew and enrich 
our Nation. While other countries cling 
to the stale past, here in America we 
breathe life into dreams. We create the 
future, and the world follows us into 
tomorrow. Thanks to each wave’’— 
President Reagan said—‘‘Thanks to 
each wave of new arrivals to this land 
of opportunity, we’re a Nation forever 
young, forever bursting with energy 
and new ideas, and always on the cut-
ting edge, always leading the world to 
the next frontier. This quality is vital 
to our future as a Nation. If we ever 
closed the door to new Americans, our 
leadership in the world would soon be 
lost.’’ 
This being the last speech that I will 
give as President, President Reagan 
said, ‘‘I think it’s fitting to leave one 
final thought, an observation about a 
country which I love.’’ 
As we remember the words of Presi-
dent Reagan, I also recall the words of 
the late Cesar Chavez, whose birthday 
we celebrate later this month. He said: 
‘‘To make a great dream come true, 
the first requirement is a great capac-
ity to dream; the second is persist-
ence.’’ 
Thanks to all of our bipartisan Mem-
bers for their persistence on this legis-
lation for which I urge a strong bipar-
tisan ‘‘aye’’ vote. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
would remind this Speaker that Cesar 
Chavez was one of the most outspoken 
adversaries to illegal immigration, pre-
cisely because he knew what that did 
to depress the wages of the legal immi-
grants that he represented through the 
United Farm Workers. 
I yield 1 minute to the gentleman 
from Pennsylvania (Mr. THOMPSON), 
the ranking member of the Committee 
on Agriculture. 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Madam Speaker, as Republican leader 
of the House Committee on Agri-
culture, I have the opportunity to 
speak with producers nationwide, and, 
overwhelmingly, they say the number 
one issue facing the industry is the 
lack of a reliable, legal workforce. 
When it comes to farm labor, our im-
migration system is broken and in des-
perate need of repair. 
The Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act is a step in the right direction. I 
will vote ‘‘yes’’ today, but to be clear, 
the bill is imperfect and must be im-
proved before becoming law. 
It will not fully address the shortage 
of legal agricultural workers and may 
leave our farmers, ranchers, and espe-
cially our dairies, with critical unmet 
needs. 
I filed an amendment that would 
have addressed these deficiencies that 
was endorsed by the American Farm 
Bureau Federation. Though not made 
in order, I hope that amendment will 
serve as a starting point in the Senate 
for necessary improvements. 
Americans are blessed with a safe, 
abundant, and affordable food supply. 
But how long will that food supply last 
if we do not have an adequate agricul-
tural workforce? 
This may be a once-in-a-generation 
opportunity to reform our immigration 
laws. Therefore, we must get it right. 
Madam Speaker, if we fail to address 
the agricultural workforce, we will 
have food insecurity, and that will lead 
to national insecurity. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Washington (Mr. NEWHOUSE). 
Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Speaker, 
let me be blunt: there is a crisis at our 
southern border. You have heard about 
it from my Republican colleagues and I 
over the past few days. Just this year, 
more than 200,000 people have illegally 
crossed our border, including four 
known terrorists. 
We must do something to stop this 
disturbing trend. The U.S. is a country 
of law and order. We must continue 
working to reform our broken immi-
gration laws and enhance our border 
security. 
That is exactly what this legislation 
will do. The Farm Workforce Mod-
ernization Act is a truly bipartisan 
bill, negotiated over many months by 
agriculture and labor representatives 
alike, to ensure those who wish to can 
come to our country, abide by our laws 
and contribute to our farms, ranches, 
and local communities. 
The bill creates an employment- and 
merit-based program for foreign work-
ers to legally work in agriculture, 
eliminating incentives for illegal mi-
gration and strengthening both our na-
tional security and our national food 
supply chain. 
This legislation streamlines our H–2A 
guest worker program, giving employ-
ers more flexibility and allowing access 
for year-round agriculture sectors like 
dairy and horticulture. 
Finally, the bill phases in E-Verify. 
So, once these laws are in place, we can 
enforce them and ensure that workers 
maintain a legal work status. 
Madam Speaker, I come from one of 
the most productive agricultural re-
gions in the world, where many of our 
crops are labor intensive. As much as 
producers would prefer to hire Amer-
ican workers to work in their fields, in 
their orchards, and in their dairies, 
there simply isn’t enough interest 
among domestic workers to get these 
jobs done. 
For decades, Congress has attempted 
to pass comprehensive immigration re-
form to address our agricultural work-
force, but we have been unsuccessful. 
This bill is the targeted, bipartisan so-
lution our farmers and ranchers need. 
I want to thank Ms. LOFGREN, Mr. 
DIAZ-BALART, 
Mr. 
SIMPSON, 
Mr. 
LAMALFA, and many others. I urge my 
colleagues to support this bill so we 
can get it to the President’s desk for 
America’s agricultural industry. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. I yield 1 minute 
to the gentleman from California (Mr. 
LAMALFA). 
Mr. LAMALFA. Madam Speaker, let’s 
acknowledge the reality of what we 
have right now, a big mess of a situa-
tion that hasn’t been cured in several 
decades. 
We used to have a system of invited 
workers, called the bracero program. 
Political battling has caused no new fix 
in all of this time. Similarly, this bill 
allows good workers, decent people, to 
get right with the law, with back-
ground checks, with restitution, and 
requirements to stay right with their 
ag worker status. 
The same bill passed this House 
through committee last Congress with 
good bipartisan support. It has bench-
marks that must be met by workers 
who are already here with history in 
ag, not opening the floodgates to more 
illegal entry and benefits. More recent 
entrants are required to remain in ag 
work for 8 additional years to remain 
eligible. We have caps in this bill to 
the 
current 
approximately 
700,000 
workers already here, with capped 
ratchets if more are needed. 
It establishes an E-Verify for ag, 
with strong biometric screening for all 
these certified ag workers, something 
we have never had under E-Verify. 
It codifies in law many of the pieces 
adopted in the Trump administration’s 
H–2A rule, including staggered H–2A 
and making it much less burdensome 
for farmers to get these workers, espe-
cially dairy, which needs year-round 
workers and cannot have it now. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 30 seconds to the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA).

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1556 
March 18, 2021 
Mr. 
LAMALFA. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
what this bill is not is amnesty, even 
though it may be dismissed as such. 
Americans have demonstrated they 
will not step forward to do this work, 
not with the nonworking benefits they 
can already access. Frequent anecdotes 
show that those that might, frequently 
quit after a few days because the work 
is too hard, even at dramatically in-
creased wages. 
This law does not hand out citizen-
ship or allow anyone to cut ahead in 
line to apply for it. The same goes for 
green cards. No express lane for green 
cards, not even government benefit eli-
gibility. 
This is simply a way to get right 
with the law, have a capped pool of al-
ready in-place ag workers with legal 
status. That is better for the worker, 
the farmer, and for our system of 
ID’ing who is in this country currently. 
It is a vast improvement over what we 
have now. 
b 1515 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
would just point out, the last 30 sec-
onds was on the time of the gentleman 
from New York. I reserve the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 11⁄2
minutes to the gentleman 
from California (Mr. PANETTA). 
Mr. PANETTA. Madam Speaker, the 
Farm Workforce Modernization Act 
would simply protect our existing 
farmworkers and perpetuate an endur-
ing farm workforce. It would do that 
by modernizing and streamlining our 
H–2A visa system and by allowing 
those who are willing to come here to 
stay here if they continue to work here 
in agriculture. 
Now, this bill is a bipartisan bill. It 
is the right bill because it was a nego-
tiated bill. No, it is not the perfect bill, 
but it is the necessary bill that was 
formulated after months and months of 
difficult talks between Democrats and 
Republicans and farmers and farm-
workers. 
Now, during those discussions, unlike 
what we are hearing today, we put neg-
ative politics aside and we focused on 
the positive policies for the people who 
are part of the solution to the number 
one problem for our farmers. We don’t 
have a domestic workforce willing to 
do ag labor, so farmers are reliant on 
immigrants to harvest their products. 
That is why, if we pass this bill today 
and the Senate does its job tomorrow, 
farmers will have a predictable and de-
pendable workforce, farmworkers will 
get the legality and the dignity that 
they deserve, and we in Congress will 
have done our job for our agriculture 
and for our Nation that both rely on 
immigrants for our future. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the distinguished 
gentleman from California (Mr. COSTA). 
Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise 
to support the bipartisan Farm Work-
force Modernization Act, which is an 
opportunity to provide meaningful re-
form that we have been waiting for, for 
years. 
This measure is supported by a bipar-
tisan coalition that includes not only 
the United Farm Workers and other 
labor organizations, but a majority of 
farm organizations across the country. 
What this is really about is an oppor-
tunity to fix a part of a broken immi-
gration system. 
I want to thank not only Chairman 
NADLER, but also Chairwoman ZOE 
LOFGREN and DAN NEWHOUSE for the 
hard work that they have done to bring 
this legislation to the floor, bipartisan 
support on both sides of the aisle. 
Let me begin with the fact that food 
is a national security issue. It is a na-
tional security issue. Less than 5 per-
cent of America’s population is di-
rectly involved in the production of 
food and fiber that feeds our Nation. 
That partnership is between farm-
workers and farmers and dairy men 
and women. 
I know because my family represents 
a 
third-generation 
family. 
Farm-
workers are some of the hardest work-
ing individuals you will ever meet. I 
know because I worked side by side for 
years growing up on my family’s farm. 
It is simply wrong that they be sub-
ject to living and working under a 
shadow of uncertainty and fear of being 
deported. That is not right. 
This bill is not about the border. The 
border has been a problem for decades. 
It is not about amnesty. This is an 
earned basis to have legal status in 
America. I have spoken with the hard-
working men and women and their 
young children who work to put food 
on America’s dinner table, and I’ve 
seen the hope in their eyes, the hope 
that we can pass this legislation to 
provide them legal status, hope for a 
normal life free of the dread of family 
separation that too often happens with 
deportation that hangs over them 
every day when they go to work, hope 
for a chance to change their reality 
and reshape their story. 
This measure involves protections. It 
involves E-Verify. It involves an oppor-
tunity to reform an H–2A program for a 
reliable workforce for American agri-
culture. We owe it to the individuals 
who do so much for us. I ask that you 
support this legislation. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON. Madam Speaker, I 
rise in opposition to this bill. 
It purports to solve an important 
problem for our country’s ag work-
force, for our ag community, and for 
food security for our country, but it ex-
ploits a bigger problem and a real 
emergency by creating a gaping hole in 
our broken immigration system. Rath-
er than address the root issue with our 
immigration laws, it exploits them. 
Frankly, I don’t know how many 
noncitizens some of my colleagues rep-
resent. I came here to represent Amer-
ican citizens. This bill disadvantages 
American citizens, and it disadvan-
tages people who follow our admittedly 
broken immigration laws and come 
here legally, and it rewards people who 
come here illegally. 
It is going to exacerbate the humani-
tarian crisis we see at the border in-
stead of cure it. It is not a remedy; it 
is a harm. It is a harm to American 
citizenship, which should be treasured. 
We do welcome new Americans. We are 
unequaled in the world. No country 
welcomes more new citizens per year 
than the United States of America. 
We will continue to be the land of op-
portunity, but we can only do that if 
we protect the cherished value of 
American citizenship. Citizenship mat-
ters. We cannot destroy it by adopting 
these policies. I plead that people op-
pose it. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
California (Mr. RUIZ). 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I and the 
Congressional Hispanic Caucus rise in 
support of H.R. 1603, the Farm Work-
force Modernization Act. 
My parents were farmworkers who 
worked tirelessly day in and day out 
with calloused hands and tired backs to 
give me, their children, opportunities 
that they never had. 
Farmworkers like my parents and 
like many of my constituents back 
home in the Coachella Valley taught 
me the value of hard work, resiliency, 
and taking care of one another. 
Farmworkers are getting infected 
and dying from COVID–19 at a much 
higher rate than the general public. 
They are literally dying to feed you, 
give you the nutrients you need to pre-
vent 
COVID–19 
and 
to 
heal 
from 
COVID–19. 
We must protect and secure our food 
supply chain. We must pass the bipar-
tisan Farm Workforce Modernization 
Act to stabilize our food supply chain 
and ensure that farmers can meet their 
future labor needs. 
The Congressional Hispanic Caucus is 
proud to work with Chair ZOE LOFGREN 
and Congressman JIMMY PANETTA, as 
well as CHC members SALUD CARBAJAL 
and JIM COSTA, and other Members to 
get the bill signed into law. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield the balance of my time to the 
gentlewoman from California (Ms. LOF-
GREN). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California will control 
the time. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the 
gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs. 
FISCHBACH). 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
H.R. 1603 subjects H–2A employers to a 
private right of action in Federal court 
for the first time ever in the history of 
the H–2A program. The bill does so by 
applying the right of action standard 
in the Migrant and Seasonal Agricul-
tural Worker Protection Act, or MSPA, 
to H–2A employers.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1557 
March 18, 2021 
My motion to recommit today simply 
provides that when an H–2A employer 
faces an H–2A-related claim under the 
MSPA, the employer is provided a 
right to cure before the claim can pro-
ceed. Specifically, the amendment al-
lows the employer to attempt to re-
solve the alleged violation within 5 
days of receiving the complaint. The 
employer must also file with the court 
documentation demonstrating that the 
action giving rise to the complaint has 
been remedied. After that, the court 
may dismiss the complaint if it is sat-
isfied that the complaint has been re-
solved. 
Under H.R. 1603, private right of ac-
tion can include actual damages or 
statutory damages of up to $500 per 
plaintiff per violation, where violations 
constitute separate provisions. Most 
claims involve multiple plaintiffs and, 
in class action, could involve many 
plaintiffs who didn’t even want to be 
part of the claim. For class action, the 
court is authorized to award the lesser 
of up to $500 per plaintiff per violation 
or up to $500,000. In other words, liabil-
ity under MSPA could be half a million 
dollars. 
Especially in the case of a fabricated 
claim or an unintended violation, this 
could be financially devastating for 
farmers. Costs like these to agricul-
tural employers on top of attorneys’ 
fees, court fees, and awards pursuant to 
other claim avenues should be taken 
seriously. They can be significant bur-
dens on employers who did not know-
ingly or purposefully violate H–2A re-
quirements. 
At the very least, we should allow 
our growers the opportunity to remedy 
a potential violation before they are 
hit with a huge penalty. Today’s mo-
tion to recommit would do just that. If 
the purpose of filing a complaint is to 
seek redress, then this amendment pro-
vides a reasonable path forward. 
I am sure that those whose purpose it 
is to subject employers to additional 
claims, frivolous or otherwise, will op-
pose my amendment, but those who un-
derstand the importance of helping 
U.S. farmers in the face of constant 
and growing competition from foreign 
agricultural operations without our 
high labor standards understand how 
reasonable a right to cure is. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentlewoman has expired. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield an additional 1 minute to the 
gentlewoman. 
Mrs. FISCHBACH. Madam Speaker, 
my amendment would retain the abil-
ity of H–2A workers to obtain redress, 
but would provide important protec-
tion for growers, too. 
Madam Speaker, if we adopt the mo-
tion to recommit, we will instruct the 
Committee on the Judiciary to con-
sider my amendment to H.R. 1603 to 
provide a commonsense right to cure 
for our Nation’s farmers, who will be 
subject to burdensome litigation under 
this underlying bill. 
Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous 
consent to include the text of the 
amendment 
in 
the 
RECORD
imme-
diately prior to the vote on the motion 
to recommit. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from Minnesota? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, may 
I inquire how much time remains on 
both sides? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from California has 9 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
California has 51⁄2 minutes remaining. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. CUELLAR). 
Mr. 
CUELLAR. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
farm work is hard work. Both of my 
parents, Odilia and Martin, were farm-
workers. It is very hard work. It is one 
of those type of jobs that is very nec-
essary to make sure that we bring food 
to the table. 
I represent several areas that are 
rural, and my ranchers and my farmers 
need an ag work program. It has to. 
They need it. I have always said, if an 
American wants the job, let them have 
that job. But if they are not going to 
fill that position, then we need to have 
a guest worker plan, just like we did 
during World War II, where we did the 
Bracero program. Therefore, we need to 
support this for our ranchers and our 
farmers. 
I will tell you this, it is not amnesty. 
What Ronald Reagan did in 1986, that 
was amnesty. This is not amnesty. And 
if you want to talk about border secu-
rity, this will help secure the border. 
Let me explain. If you have people 
who will come into a secure system to 
come work, and then they go back, 
then you can have Border Patrol focus 
on the people who have the bad mo-
tives, the people who want to bring in 
drugs, the people who want to smuggle 
or traffic people. So this actually will 
help border security if we set this up 
right, like they did in World War II. 
Madam Speaker, I ask Members to 
support this program. It is needed by 
our farmworkers. We need to do it. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Chairwoman ZOE
LOFGREN
and Mr. 
NADLER for their work. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, 
may I inquire of my friend from Cali-
fornia if she has any additional speak-
ers? 
Ms. LOFGREN. No, I do not. 
Mr. MCCLINTOCK. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Just yesterday, the Secretary of 
Homeland Security told the Homeland 
Security Committee that the border is 
secure. The Secretary said the border 
is secure, despite saying only 1 day ear-
lier that the Department of Homeland 
Security is on pace to encounter more 
individuals on the southwest border 
than we have in the last 20 years. 
He said the border is secure, despite a 
590 percent increase in the number of 
family units crossing the border in the 
first 6 weeks of the Biden administra-
tion. 
He said the border is secure, despite 
Customs and Border Protection refer-
ring over 7,300 unaccompanied alien 
minors to the Department of Health 
and Human Services during the month 
of February. That is the highest num-
ber of referrals in any February in the 
history of the program. 
b 1530 
He said the border is secure despite 
the Biden administration’s plan to use 
the Dallas Convention Center to house 
thousands of the unaccompanied mi-
nors who the cartels have smuggled 
across the border. 
No matter what Secretary Mayorkas 
says, the fact is the border is not se-
cure, and it is not secure because of 
President Biden’s dangerous immigra-
tion policies. 
We know that when foreign nationals 
think they can easily get into the U.S. 
and be rewarded with legal status, 
which is what this bill does, they flood 
the border. 
We are watching that happen before 
our eyes. Aliens are flooding the border 
in response to the President’s rhetoric 
and policies and in response to the 
promises of additional rewards made 
through bills like this. 
Talk of amnesty fuels border cross-
ings. That is a fact. 
This bill grants amnesty and a spe-
cial path to U.S. citizenship to at least 
1 million farmworkers currently in the 
United States. I have seen estimates 
that go up to 21⁄2 million—nobody real-
ly knows—as well as to their spouses 
and children. 
This bill allows aliens to get green 
cards even if they illegally reentered 
the 
U.S., 
committed 
immigration 
fraud, voted illegally in a Federal or 
State election, or have two serious 
misdemeanor convictions. 
The supporters of this bill claim that 
illegal aliens who get green cards must 
work in agriculture. However, the bill 
includes broad waiver authority that 
allows those who did not complete all 
the work requirements because of 
weather conditions or COVID or if the 
alien was fired, among other situa-
tions, to still get a green card. 
Those legalized under this bill would, 
from the outset, compete directly for 
jobs with Americans. Nothing in this 
bill prevents those who get employ-
ment authorization during the initial 
process 
from 
working 
in 
non-
agricultural 
labor 
sectors. 
And 
of 
course, once they and their family 
members get a green card, as provided 
under this legislation, they are free to 
work wherever they want. 
This bill sends a powerful message 
and an invitation to those who cross 
our borders illegally that they can ex-
pect to be rewarded with legal status 
and, ultimately, green cards and an ex-
pedited path to citizenship. 
But far worse than that, it floods our 
market with low-wage labor at a time 
when Americans are struggling to re-
cover from the devastating lockdowns 
that have crushed the dreams of so 
many working families.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1558 
March 18, 2021 
I will end as I began. The people who 
were most helped by the economic ex-
pansion that we saw were working- 
class Americans because the Trump ad-
ministration got control of our borders 
and stemmed the flow of this illegal 
labor. 
They made the greatest gains during 
the expansion; they have been the most 
harmed during the lockdowns; and this 
adds to their burdens and woes by en-
suring that the market for their skills 
and labor will remain stagnant for a 
decade to come. 
Please don’t do this to those good 
Americans in this perilous time for our 
country. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Ms. LOFGREN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
There has been a lot of rhetoric 
today about the border, and I think it 
is important to address some of it. 
First, let’s get the facts straight. The 
uptick in apprehensions at the south-
ern border began in April 2020, last 
year, long before we knew President 
Biden was even going to become the 
Democratic nominee, much less the 
President. 
During the pandemic, the Trump ad-
ministration did something that trou-
bled me a great deal and that I ob-
jected to. They ignored the Trafficking 
Victims Protection Act. That was a bi-
partisan 
bill. 
Congressman 
CHRIS 
SMITH from New Jersey was the lead on 
the Republican side. I worked on it on 
our side along with others. It had a 
very precise protocol for what to do 
when an unaccompanied child pre-
sented at the border, a potential traf-
ficking victim. 
Instead of following that protocol, 
the prior administration would simply 
take that child, an 11- or 12-year-old 
little girl, and turn her back into Mex-
ico, not knowing what would happen to 
her. 
Now, those children who have been in 
squalid camps for the last year are 
being addressed pursuant to the Traf-
ficking Victims Protection Act. It is 
correct that we have had more children 
present than we were prepared to deal 
with, and there was a scramble to take 
care of those children properly. But it 
has nothing to do with the Farm Work 
Modernization Act. 
I listened with some interest to the 
suggestion that there needs to be a 
change in the Migrant and Seasonal 
Agricultural Worker Protection Act 
provisions of this bill. Currently, H–2A 
employers must comply with the H–2A 
program requirements, which largely 
meet or exceed MSPA. The primary 
difference is that the DOL stands in 
the place of the foreign farmworker in 
bringing forward cases of alleged viola-
tion of the H–2A program. 
The Fair Labor Standards Act and a 
number of other Federal and State 
laws apply to the H–2A program, but it 
is worth noting that any H–2A em-
ployer that employs one or more do-
mestic workers who perform seasonal 
or temporary agricultural work is al-
ready covered under MSPA, and that 
would be close to like all employers. 
This bill would formally place all em-
ployers of H–2A workers under MSPA, 
impacting only those who hire no do-
mestic employees. 
The idea that there needs to be a 
right to cure has merit, except it is al-
ready addressed in this bill because it 
requires mandatory mediation. If there 
is a problem that can be fixed, it will 
be fixed in the mediation system. That 
is quite new. 
The other thing to point out is that 
there are no attorney’s fees provided 
for in the bill or in MSPA, so the idea 
that somehow this is a windfall for the 
trial bar is simply incorrect. 
There is a great Q&A truth setting in 
a publication called Hoard’s Dairyman, 
‘‘What the Farm Workforce Act could 
mean.’’ I include the article in the 
RECORD. 
[From Hoard’s Dairyman, Mar. 15, 2021] 
WHAT THE FARM WORKFORCE ACT COULD 
MEAN 
(By Bob Gray) 
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act, 
bipartisan bill H.R. 1603, was reintroduced 
this week by Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren 
(D–Calif.) and Congressman Dan Newhouse 
(R–Wash.). It could be taken up by the full 
House this week. 
Here are some additional details about the 
bill. Most of this information came from the 
four Republican leads—Representatives Dan 
Newhouse (R–Wash.), Mike Simpson (R– 
ldaho), Mario Diaz-Balart (R–Fla.), and Doug 
LaMalfa (R–Calif.). Before reading further, I 
want to reiterate, however, that this is a bi-
partisan bill with support from both sides of 
the aisle. 
The Farm Workforce Modernization Act 
(FWMA) expands the current H–2A seasonal 
worker program to include full-time, year- 
round workers for dairy and other agricul-
tural businesses. 
The bill is not perfect, but it is a very good 
start in providing an extremely important 
piece of the legislative reform needed by 
dairy farmers. Right now, as you all know, 
we have no program. We have never had an 
immigration worker program in the past. 
When the bill goes before the House next 
week, you will hear various pros and cons 
about it in the press. Therefore, I thought it 
would be useful to include a ‘‘Facts and 
Myths’’ sheet about the legislation so you 
can fully understand its provisions and not 
be misled by information that is incorrect. 
THIS IS WHAT THE FARM WORKFORCE 
MODERNIZATION ACT DOES 
Simplifies H–2A by reducing duplicative 
paperwork—only one filing needed instead of 
three. 
Bureaucracy is reduced even further for 
many farmers with staggered labor needs. 
Farmers can file one petition for the entire 
season, allowing for staggered entry of H–2A 
workers. 
Modernizes recruitment by allowing em-
ployers to post job openings on an online job 
registry. No classified ads are required. 
Reduces labor costs by freezing wages for 
one year and capping wage growth there-
after. The adverse effect wage rate is re-
placed in later years. 
Makes available 60,000 year-round H–2A 
visas over the first three years, growing an-
nually by 12.5%. Dairy is guaranteed at least 
half of these visas, and any unused visas are 
available for other agriculture industries. 
Stabilizes the existing workforce by giving 
legitimate farmworkers a chance to get a 
five-year 
Certified 
Agriculture 
Worker 
(CAW) visa to work in U.S. agriculture. As 
long as the worker continues to meet min-
imum days in agriculture annually, the 
worker can continue to work in the U.S. 
with unlimited five-year renewals. CAWs can 
cross the border as they need without re-
striction. 
CAWs can earn the opportunity to apply 
for a green card by paying a penalty and con-
tinuing to work in agriculture for at least 
eight years. If a CAW can prove 10 years of 
prior work in agriculture, they can apply for 
a green card after four years. 
MYTHS AND FACTS 
MYTH: This bill will codify wage surveys 
into law and result in multiple wage classes. 
Under this bill, wages will be much higher 
than the current Adverse Effect Wage Rate 
(AEWR). 
FACT: This bill provides for greater cer-
tainty and granularity in wages. First, this 
bill applies a one-year freeze of wages across 
all categories at the current year’s rate. 
After the one-year freeze, all wage rates are 
then limited in any increases year over year 
to 3.25% with the ability to decrease 1.5%. 
(Exception: If the resulting wage is less than 
110% of the federal or state minimum wage, 
then the wage could increase an additional 
percentage point to 4.25%.) After year 10, the 
AEWR requirement ends, and the Secretaries 
of Agriculture and Labor must develop a new 
wage standard with input from stakeholders. 
If Congress fails to act to control and reform 
AEWR, some estimates have shown AEWR 
rates could rise 7% to 8% annually in the 
coming years. 
MYTH: Adjusted workers are treated im-
mediately as U.S. workers, thus requiring 
employers to hire them. This displaces pre-
vious H–2A workers. 
FACT: This bill includes a provision that 
allows employers to prioritize their longtime 
H–2A workers over new Certified Agriculture 
Workers (CAWs). CAWs have a requirement 
to work in agriculture that no domestic 
worker has. Because of that requirement and 
proven experience in agriculture work, CAWs 
do receive preference over new foreign agri-
culture workers. There is no expansion of the 
current workforce; CAW workers are already 
here and working in agriculture. The bill 
eliminates the legal chaos farmers and work-
ers face today. 
MYTH: This bill does not allow agricul-
tural associations to file as agents on behalf 
of their members. 
FACT: This bill does not affect the ability 
of associations to file as agents. The bill al-
lows associations to file as agents, or as a 
joint or sole employer of workers. 
MYTH: This bill provides no relief for 
dairies or year-round agriculture. 
FACT: This bill creates year-round access 
to the H–2A program for dairy and other ag-
ricultural sectors that desperately need 
workers but have previously been unable to 
utilize the program. Without this bill, year- 
round agriculture has no access to a legal 
foreign workforce. 
MYTH: This bill would create new funding 
for the Legal Services Corporation. 
FACT: There is no new funding in this bill 
for the Legal Services Corporation. 
MYTH: This bill requires farmworker hous-
ing to meet Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA) standards. 
FACT: Farmworker housing is already re-
quired to meet OSHA standards, and DOL re-
quires annual approved inspections before 
approving a certification. The bill makes no 
changes to that requirement, and in fact, re-
duces the inspection to every two years. The 
bill provides $11 billion in additional funds to

offset costs for grower-provided and other 
farmworker housing. 
MYTH: This bill establishes a new bureau-
cratic complaint/investigation process that 
allows anyone to file a complaint. 
FACT: There is no new process established 
in this bill. It simply codifies existing regu-
lations. 
MYTH: The bill requires more reporting on 
employer recruitment efforts. 
FACT: There are no additional reporting 
requirements in this bill, and requirements 
for recruitment efforts have been simplified 
and modernized. 
MYTH: This bill creates a new private 
right of action for H–2A workers under the 
Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker 
Protection Act (MSPA). 
FACT: Currently, H–2A employers must 
comply with the H–2A program require-
ments, which largely meet or exceed MSPA. 
The primary difference is that DOL stands in 
the place of the foreign farmworker in bring-
ing forward cases of alleged violations of the 
H–2A program, the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA), and a number of other federal and 
state laws. In addition, any H–2A employer 
that employs one or more domestic worker 
who performs seasonal or temporary agricul-
tural work is also currently covered under 
MSPA. The bill would formally place all em-
ployers of H–2A workers under MSPA (im-
pacting only those who currently hire no do-
mestic employees for seasonal or temporary 
work) while creating a new mandatory medi-
ation requirement for any claim not just 
filed under MSPA but extended it to claims 
under the H–2A program and FLSA. Manda-
tory mediation could help reduce litigation 
costs and attorney fees for growers, in part 
by resolving frivolous claims before reaching 
the court room. 
MYTH: This bill gives workers up to two 
years to file a legal claim against an em-
ployer, even after the worker has returned to 
their home country. 
FACT: Under current statue, H–2A workers 
already get this. There is nothing new in this 
bill. Many state-based claims have longer 
statute of limitations. 
MYTH: This bill gives the Department of 
Labor (DOL) a new ability to sue on behalf of 
employees. 
FACT: Under the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA), DOL already has this ability. There 
is nothing new in this bill. 
MYTH: To overcome a denial of labor cer-
tification, this legislation places the burden 
of proof on employers to show that domestic 
workers were turned away for lawful rea-
sons. 
FACT: Nothing new is in this bill. This 
provision already exists under current law. 
MYTH: This bill permits very limited ap-
peals and does not grant de novo appeals of 
denials or Notice of Disagreement (NOD). 
FACT: This bill allows employers to quick-
ly fix application deficiencies, as with cur-
rent law. The bill, however, improves this 
process by creating a new emergency proce-
dure for farmers so issues are fixed faster 
and workers are not delayed. It also allows 
for post-certification modifications. 
MYTH: This bill establishes a new require-
ment for employers to provide housing for 
domestic workers outside of a 50-mile dis-
tance. 
FACT: The bill does not change any cur-
rent housing requirements. As with current 
law, the requirement to provide housing ap-
plies only to U.S. workers who live outside of 
the normal commuting distance for the area. 
MYTH: The bill makes no meaningful re-
form to the high housing costs in the H–2A 
program. 
FACT: The bill makes historic investments 
in farmworker housing while reducing em-
ployer costs in providing such housing, in-
cluding to H–2A workers. The bill provides $1 
billion to rehabilitate existing housing, tri-
ples federal funding for USDA Section 514/516 
rural housing and grant programs, and dou-
bles funding for the Section 521 rental assist-
ance program. The bill also reduces the cost 
of providing housing to H–2A workers by 
making operating assistance subsidies avail-
able to 514/516 property owners who house H– 
2A workers. 
MYTH: Mandatory E-Verify just for agri-
culture means thousands of year-round em-
ployers will have no access to labor whatso-
ever. 
FACT: This bill provides a way for the cur-
rent workforce to get right with the law, 
which means they would be compliant with 
E-Verify. As noted above, the bill provides 
employers with two avenues for hiring new 
year-round workers. The E-Verify require-
ment would only apply to new hires and is 
phased in, beginning three years after enact-
ment. 
MYTH: Illegal farmworkers, their spouses, 
and all their dependents are provided a spe-
cial, expedited path to legal, permanent resi-
dence and will move out of agriculture and 
into other jobs in the economy. 
FACT: This bill does not create an imme-
diate path to permanent residence. First, it 
creates a temporary legal status that can 
only be renewed with significant agricultural 
work. Second, the bill provides the option of 
earning permanent residence through contin-
ued agricultural work, but it would take at 
a minimum five to 10 years to earn such sta-
tus, depending on the amount of past agri-
cultural work the worker could demonstrate. 
These significant past and future work com-
mitments would ensure the stability of 
American agriculture for years to come. 
Spouses and dependents receive the same 
protections that currently exist in the H–2A 
program. 
MYTH: The bill puts AEWR into law after 
2029 with no increase or decrease in caps. 
Keeping the AEWR for another 10 years and 
preserving it in statute means employers 
will see no relief. 
FACT: After year 10, the AEWR require-
ment ends, and the Secretaries of Agri-
culture and Labor must develop a new wage 
standard with input from stakeholders. 
MYTH: The bill provides new authority for 
the DOL to award back wages, penalties, and 
damages and/or to debar employers from the 
program for five years or permanently. 
FACT: The DOL already has authority to 
temporarily debar bad actors. This bill would 
give the DOL new authority to permanently 
debar individuals who have previously been 
debarred and are habitual violators of the 
program’s requirements. 
Ms. LOFGREN. We have labored long 
and hard, those of us in our bipartisan 
group that worked to solve a problem 
that our country has, which is we need 
a stable workforce in the agricultural 
sector. 
I thank last year’s chairman of the 
Agriculture Committee, Collin Peter-
son, for the work that he did on this 
bill; this year’s chair who also supports 
this bill, Mr. SCOTT; as well as the 
ranking member who said that he 
would vote for it even though there are 
some things he would like to change. It 
is a compromise, and it was worked on 
for almost over a year to get to this 
point. 
We believe that having a legal work-
force in agriculture that will give sta-
bility is not only good for those work-
ers, but it is good for their employers, 
and it is good for America. 
We believe that making sure that 
there is a future flow of a legal work-
force not only into farms but now into 
dairy is good for America because we 
think immigration ought to be legal. It 
ought to be regularized. It ought to be 
orderly. That is what this bill would 
accomplish. 
Finally, there has been a lot of talk 
about enforcement. This bill has en-
forcement in it. When the bill is imple-
mented, we will have a strategy in a 
legal way to meet the needs of agri-
culture in America. If we have that as 
law, we ought to enforce that law. That 
is why, on a bipartisan basis, we agreed 
that E-Verify ought to be applied to 
this whole sector. 
This is a package that will make 
America stronger. It is fair to farm-
workers. It is fair to farmers. And it is 
good for America. I hope that people 
will vote for it on both sides of the 
aisle. So many of us worked together 
to bring it to this point. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Madam Speaker, 
farmworkers toil under difficult and dangerous 
conditions for long hours and low pay to en-
sure America has a safe and plentiful food 
supply. 
Because of the scarcity of domestic farm 
labor, for decades, the agricultural sector has 
depended largely on the labor of migrant 
workers. The vast majority of crop workers in 
the United States were not born here and are 
undocumented or here on guest visas. Though 
these workers perform incredibly difficult work 
under hazardous conditions, they are often un-
able to seek recourse when their rights are 
violated. A pathway to citizenship, when ac-
companied by appropriate oversight meas-
ures, could help reduce these dedicated work-
ers’ justifiable fear of reprisal for asserting 
their rights. Farmworkers are integral to our 
communities and our economy. Creating a 
pathway to citizenship for these individuals— 
who work to feed us and our country year 
after year—as well as their families is both an 
economic and humanitarian necessity. 
I support legalization of vulnerable, undocu-
mented workers and a path to citizenship. 
However, in exchange for legalization for 
some undocumented farmworkers, this bill 
would depress labor standards for H–2A work-
ers. Because weakened labor standards for 
H–2A workers could adversely impact the do-
mestic workforce, this bill could negatively im-
pact the economic security of all farmworkers. 
Wage cuts for many H–2A workers in turn 
would depress wages for all farmworkers. The 
adverse effect wage rate (AEWR), which is 
often the binding wage paid to H–2A workers, 
is designed to ensure that wages paid to H– 
2A workers do not depress wages for U.S. 
farmworkers. This means the AEWR must be 
high enough to reflect wages paid in the local 
labor market. This bill would change the way 
the AEWR is currently calculated over the first 
ten years to reflect average wages paid to 
farmworkers in the region according to their 
specific occupation, rather than the average 
wage paid to farmworkers across all occupa-
tions. However, the bill fails to require the use 
of data that actually reflects local wage condi-
tions. Additionally, while setting limitations on 
how much AEWR wages can decrease after

March 18, 2021 
an initial one-year freeze, the bill imposes 
caps on wage increases from year to year, 
limiting whether AEWR can truly reflect wages 
paid in the local labor market. 
As a result of these changes to the AEWR, 
the majority of H–2A workers would see their 
wages actually go down, albeit modestly, while 
others would see the growth in their wages 
capped. I have opposed similar efforts pro-
posed by the Trump Administration that would 
depress wages. 
This year, I was pleased to lead House ef-
forts to include an increase to the federal min-
imum wage in the House-passed American 
Rescue Plan (H.R. 1319). While those min-
imum wage provisions did not ultimately sur-
vive Senate budget reconciliation rules, I will 
continue to push for H.R. 603, the Raise the 
Wage Act, which would gradually raise the 
federal minimum wage to $15 per hour by 
2025. I am confident that in the next ten 
years, we will enact a meaningful increase in 
the federal minimum wage, boosting wages for 
workers across our nation—including farm-
workers. However, I am concerned that H.R. 
1603, Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 
2021, will create artificial barriers to wage 
growth, or worse, lead to wage cuts, con-
tinuing to leave farmworkers relegated to low 
pay and economic insecurity. 
Our country’s wage and hour laws are de-
signed to ensure that workers are guaranteed 
a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work. But this 
right is only as strong as a worker’s ability to 
hold employers accountable, especially in 
court. Unfortunately, this bill creates obstacles 
that may delay farmworkers’ ability to access 
their day in court, when they have been vic-
tims of wage theft. While I welcome extending 
coverage of the Migrant and Seasonal Agricul-
tural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) to H–2A 
workers, adding a mediation requirement to 
both the MSPA and the Fair Labor Standards 
Act (FLSA) is problematic. This bill enables 
employers to impose three months of manda-
tory mediation when an H–2A worker brings a 
civil suit under these laws, even if the worker 
does not consent to the mediation and wants 
his or her day in court. This undermines the 
voluntary nature of mediation and provides 
bad actors with an avenue for delaying or de-
nying wage recovery. This delay could prove 
significant for farmworkers who may be in this 
country for a limited amount of time to partici-
pate in litigation. This is especially fraught 
given that, in contrast to MSPA, the FLSA pro-
vides for recovery of unpaid wages and liq-
uidated, or double, damages and recovery of 
attorney’s fees, plus costs. This provision may 
also pull domestic farmworkers or other visa 
classifications of workers into required medi-
ation where there are collective or class ac-
tions, thereby undermining incentives for other 
workers to join with H–2A workers to seek re-
dress. 
Last Congress, I supported the passage of 
H.R. 1423, the FAIR Act, to ban forced arbitra-
tion in many areas, including employment, be-
cause it could delay or totally block workers’ 
access to courts. We should promote legisla-
tion that protects workers’ fundamental right to 
have their day in court, not delay it. 
This bill denies newly legalized farmworkers 
and their families access to key social safety 
net programs. Denial of benefits that can pro-
mote economic stability, coupled with the bill’s 
wage suppressing provisions, threatens to cre-
ate a long-term pool of economically vulner-
able workers. While most of these individuals 
do not currently have access to these benefits 
due to their immigration status, leaving immi-
grant workers who are granted legal status 
under this legislation without access to social 
safety net programs establishes a dangerous 
precedent that access to health care and other 
basic necessities can be traded away for a 
path to legal status. 
This legislation weakens the current recruit-
ment and hiring standards for U.S. farm-
workers. A reduction in employers’ obligations 
to hire U.S. workers under this bill will under-
mine one of the core principles of the H–2A 
program: that H–2A workers should fill in gaps 
in the farm workforce that U.S. employers are 
truly unable to fill, rather than merely replacing 
U.S. workers that employers could attract with 
reasonable efforts. I raised concerns with simi-
lar efforts to modify recruitment standards by 
the Trump Administration in 2019. 
Agricultural work is hazardous, and workers 
in this sector have few legal health and safety 
protections. Ensuring that H–2A workers and 
all farmworkers have safe, healthy working 
conditions is critical. I am pleased that this bill 
requires H–2A employers to maintain heat ill-
ness prevention plans and requires H–2A em-
ployers in the dairy industry to maintain work-
place safety plans. However, as presently writ-
ten, some provisions are ambiguous and 
would be difficult to enforce; other provisions 
have weak minimum requirements that would 
limit their value. As this legislation moves for-
ward, I would urge the inclusions of stronger 
health and safety standards. 
Strong labor protections are vital to protect 
both H–2A workers, who are vulnerable given 
their temporary status, and domestic farm-
workers, 
whose 
employers 
may 
be 
disincentivized to provide employment. This is 
especially true given that farmworkers have 
historically been carved out of labor and em-
ployment laws, leaving these workers with 
fewer wage protections and rights to bargain 
for better working conditions. 
While this bill does make some improve-
ments in immigration law, I look forward to 
supporting a version of this bill that more ac-
curately reflects strong labor standards.

PROTECT DEMOCRACY IN BURMA 
ACT OF 2021 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and pass the bill 
(H.R. 1112) to require a report on the 
military coup in Burma, and for other 
purposes, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
H.R. 1112 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Protect De-
mocracy in Burma Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress finds the following: 
(1) On March 14, 2005, the House of Rep-
resentatives agreed to H. Res. 135, which es-
tablished the House Democracy Assistance 
Commission (later changed to the House De-
mocracy Partnership, hereafter referred to 
as ‘‘HDP’’) to work directly with par-
liaments around the world to support the de-
velopment of effective, independent, and re-
sponsive legislative institutions. 
(2) HDP approved a legislative strength-
ening partnership with Burma in 2016 and or-
ganized the first congressional delegation to 
meet with the new civilian-led government, 
led by State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, 
and civil society leaders in May 2016. 
(3) On February 2, 2021, the U.S. Depart-
ment of State assessed that Daw Aung San 
Suu Kyi, the leader of Burma’s ruling party, 
and President Win Myint, the duly elected 
head of government, were deposed in a mili-
tary coup on February 1, 2021. 
(4) As part of the military coup, the Bur-
mese military declared martial law, sus-
pended the civilian-led government, and de-
tained newly elected Members of Parliament

in the capitol, Naypyidaw, thereby usurping 
the role of the democratically elected gov-
ernment and parliament. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) due to the Burmese military’s seizure of 
government through the detention of State 
Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win 
Myint, and other government leaders, Burma 
is not represented by a democratically-elect-
ed government; 
(2) the inability of newly elected Members 
of Parliament to begin their official mandate 
due to the Burmese military’s actions di-
rectly threatens the democratic trajectory of 
Burma’s Parliament, and thereby the coun-
try; 
(3) the will and determination of those 
duly-elected Members of Parliament who are 
taking it upon themselves to continue serv-
ing as representatives of the people through 
alternative methods of communicating and 
convening should be lauded; and 
(4) by preventing the Parliament from 
completing its work, the Burmese military 
has rendered impossible and effectively nul-
lified the international collaborative rela-
tionships that have supported and strength-
ened the institution, including the Burmese 
parliament’s partnership with HDP. 
SEC. 4. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES REGARD-
ING BURMA’S DEMOCRACY. 
It is the policy of the United States to— 
(1) condemn the military coup in Burma, 
to urge the unconditional release of detained 
democratically-elected leaders and civil soci-
ety members, and to support a return to Bur-
ma’s democratic transition; 
(2) instruct, as appropriate, representatives 
of the United States Government to use the 
voice, vote, and influence of the United 
States at the United Nations to hold ac-
countable those responsible for the military 
coup in Burma; and 
(3) engage with the Association of South-
east Asian Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN 
member states to promote a return to Bur-
ma’s democratic transition and democratic 
values throughout Southeast Asia, and sup-
port the centrality of ASEAN within the re-
gional architecture of the Indo-Pacific. 
SEC. 5. REPORT. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
State shall submit to the Committee on For-
eign Affairs and the Committee on Appro-
priations of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Foreign Relations and 
the Committee on Appropriations of the Sen-
ate a report on the military coup in Burma, 
including a description of efforts to imple-
ment the policy specified in section 4. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days within which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H.R. 1112, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to start by 
thanking Mr. CONNOLLY for this impor-
tant bill before us today. 
The Protect Democracy in Burma 
Act of 2021 is a timely measure that en-
sures the United States is not silent 
when a military coup supplants democ-
racy. It also directs strong U.S. en-
gagement with our partners at the U.N. 
and ASEAN because we are always 
stronger when we are united. 
In 2015, decades of brutal military 
rule gave way to what many hoped 
would be a new era of reform and de-
mocratization in Burma. That hope 
was short-lived, and the Tatmadaw 
began to show its true colors as it en-
gaged in a genocide of the Rohingya 
Muslim minority. 
Now, a little more than 5 years after 
the democratic opening that it helped 
usher in, the military has halted Bur-
ma’s democratic experiment. 
By all accounts, Burma’s November 
2020 parliamentary elections were cred-
ible, and claims of widespread fraud 
have been debunked by election-moni-
toring authorities. The United States 
condemns, in the strongest possible 
terms, the actions of the Burmese mili-
tary and its violent crackdown and 
killing of protesters. But we cannot 
stand alone. 
b 1545 
To be most effective, the United 
States must work with our partners in 
the 
region 
in 
condemning 
the 
Tatmadaw’s brutal actions in sup-
porting democracy and respect for the 
election outcome. 
Madam Speaker, that is exactly what 
this bill sets out to do. It makes clear 
where the U.S. stands. It promotes 
multilateral cooperation as we work to 
hold the Burmese military accountable 
and call for a return to Burma’s demo-
cratic transition. It also ensures re-
porting to Congress so that we can 
properly review U.S. policy. 
Madam Speaker, this is a very impor-
tant bill that sends a message to the 
people of Burma and to the entire 
world, and I urge my colleagues to sup-
port this measure. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, on February 1, Bur-
ma’s military seized power yet again, 
ending 5 years of a flawed, but hopeful, 
democracy, and dragging Burma back 
into brutal military rule. Since that 
day, the world has watched horrified as 
pro-democracy protestors are met with 
brutal violence in the streets. 
The Burmese military has used com-
munications blackouts, curfews, and 
mass detentions to stifle opposition. 
They 
have 
used 
live 
ammunition 
against peaceful protestors. Hundreds 
have been killed and thousands de-
tained. At the same time, the lead op-
position to the Burmese military, the 
National League for Democracy, is fac-
ing further repression. NLD members 
have been rounded up and charged with 
baseless crimes, including NLD’s lead-
er, Aung San Suu Kyi. 
Madam Speaker, that is why I am 
asking my colleagues to join me today 
in supporting this resolution. I really 
want to thank the chairman and Mr. 
CONNOLLY of Virginia for bringing this 
bill forward, to make it clear that the 
United States of America condemns 
this coup. It encourages engagement 
with southeast nations to promote 
Burma’s return to democracy. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support it, and I reserve the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia (Mr. CONNOLLY), an esteemed 
member of the Committee on Foreign 
Affairs and author of this important 
bill. 
Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my distinguished friend for the 
wonderful work he is doing as our new 
chairman of the House Committee on 
Foreign Affairs. And I thank my friend, 
Mr. MCCAUL, the distinguished ranking 
member. 
Madam Speaker, this is an important 
bipartisan statement. Lives are at 
stake. It is urgent this House speak 
with one voice about what is happening 
in Myanmar, formerly Burma. The cur-
rent crisis in the wake of a military 
coup in which violence is escalating by 
the day and protestors are being killed 
by the dozens demands a timely re-
sponse. 
I was pleased to introduce this bill in 
collaboration with the House Democ-
racy Partnership chairman, Mr. DAVID 
PRICE, and our Republican colleague, 
Mr. VERN BUCHANAN of Florida. 
On February 1, the Burmese military 
seized control of Burma’s Government 
in a coup d’etat by detaining democrat-
ically elected leaders from the Na-
tional League of Democracy, NLD, just 
hours before the country’s new par-
liament was set to meet for its first 
session. And that was following an 
overwhelming election result in that 
country. 
Among those detained were State 
Counselor Daw Aung San Suu Kyi; 
President U Win Myint; and other sen-
ior NLD leaders. In one fell swoop, the 
military plunged this national democ-
racy into renewed political turmoil 
just as it was emerging from five dec-
ades of military rule and isolation. 
In 2015, more than 30 million voters 
elected the NLD and its leader, Aung 
San Suu Kyi, to power in the country’s 
first general election. 
The country’s first peaceful transfer 
of power from military rule to a civil-
ian government was celebrated around 
the world. Pictures of voters proudly 
raising their ink-stained fingers after 
the voting in the country’s 2015 and 
2020 elections had been replaced trag-
ically by images of anger and tears and 
bloodshed. 
The military takeover has jeopard-
ized hard-won progress on everything, 
from infrastructure or education in-
vestments to the country’s fragile 
peace process. It seeks to snuff out the 
hopes of the Burmese people for a bet-
ter future.

H1562 
March 18, 2021 
At least 149 people, including chil-
dren, have been killed by the security 
forces. Mass funerals have been con-
ducted all across the country. More 
than 2,100 individuals—civilians, stu-
dents, 
journalists, 
unionists—have 
been detained. Millions have poured 
onto the streets all across Burma to 
demand a return to democracy, putting 
themselves at grave risk for the sake of 
their own freedom. 
A civil disobedience movement has 
emerged with medics, bankers, law-
yers, teachers, engineers, factory work-
ers, students, leaving their jobs and 
their study as a form of resistance 
against the coup. Despite military or-
ders to shoot to kill, they have not 
backed down. 
While we cannot be on the streets of 
Yangon or Mandalay or Nay Pyi Taw, 
we must stand in solidarity with those 
brave people in their peaceful protests 
against this coup. 
That is what this bill seeks to do. 
The Protect Democracy in Burma Act 
would establish that it is the policy of 
the United States Government to en-
gage with the Association of Southeast 
Asian Nations and their member states 
to condemn the coup, urge uncondi-
tional release of detained leaders and 
civil society members, and support the 
immediate return to a democratic 
transition. It instructs the United 
States Government to use its voice, 
vote, and influence in the U.N. to hold 
accountable those responsible for this 
coup. 
Finally, the legislation states, as the 
sense of Congress, that the Burmese 
military has effectively nullified its 
participation with the House Democ-
racy Partnership—a partnership here 
at the House that has been in place for 
the past 5 years. 
Madam Speaker, I was privileged, 
along with our chairman, Mr. PRICE, to 
travel to Burma and meet with Aung 
San Suu Kyi as part of that partner-
ship delegation back in 2016, a visit 
that reinforced our commitment to 
supporting Burma’s democratization 
and development. The Burmese mili-
tary must respect the results of demo-
cratic elections and allow the demo-
cratic transition in Burma to continue. 
Madam Speaker, with this bill, with 
one voice, Congress will send a clear 
signal to the military junta that its 
unlawful seizure of power will not be 
accepted and there will be hope for the 
Burmese people. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman 
from New York (Ms. TENNEY). 
Ms. TENNEY. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the chairman and the ranking 
member for their leadership. 
Madam Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 1112 and H. Res. 134. Both 
of these bills support democracy and 
stand with the people of Burma, also 
known as Myanmar. 
New York’s 22nd District is home to 
more than 4,000 Burmese refugees and 
new Burmese-American citizens. They 
have been coming to our region for 
over 20 years. They are demanding ac-
tion and a return to civilian rule in 
Burma. I stand with them and all of 
my colleagues in condemning the atro-
cious human rights abuses that are 
taking place at the hands of the mili-
tary coup last month. 
I am honored to be an original co-
sponsor on both of these bills on Burma 
as a member of the Committee on For-
eign 
Affairs, 
where 
they 
received 
strong 
bipartisan 
support. 
Though 
these bills will not solve the problem in 
Burma, this will provide continued 
pressure on the military and a strong 
unified 
international 
condemnation 
will add to that. However, these bills 
are a very important step in the right 
direction. 
The Burmese refugees and American 
citizens I represent in New York’s 22nd 
District remain resolute in support of 
their friends and families who are suf-
fering through this tragic process. In 
Utica, for example, they continue to 
advocate peacefully and protest in soli-
darity with those in their home coun-
try, displaying signs that read: ‘‘Save 
Democracy, Save Burma.’’ 
The passion and courage of the Bur-
mese people both in my district and in 
Burma is inspiring. I am honored to 
provide a voice for them in this august 
body. 
Madam Speaker, I urge all to remain 
committed to the Burmese people’s 
quest for democracy and to oppose the 
assault on their free and fair govern-
ment. 
Again, I thank Chairman MEEKS, 
Ranking Member MCCAUL, and the gen-
tleman from Virginia (Mr. CONNOLLY) 
for being so strong on this initiative. It 
is critically important to the Burmese 
refugees in my community. 
To the citizens: We stand with you. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from North 
Carolina (Mr. PRICE), the distinguished 
chairman of the House Democracy 
Partnership. 
Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I am proud to advocate the 
passage of H.R. 1112, the Protect De-
mocracy in Burma Act; and H. Res. 134, 
a resolution condemning the military 
coup taking place in Burma. 
I commend Chairman MEEKS
and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL
for their 
leadership. As chairman of the House 
Democracy Partnership, I am happy to 
work alongside Representative CON-
NOLLY to champion this bill, and I com-
mend Representative LEVIN
for his 
good work, as well. 
What is going on in Burma demands 
action. The very foundation of Bur-
mese democracy and, consequently, the 
country’s international standing now 
hang in the balance as a result of the 
Burmese military’s reckless action. 
The situation is deteriorating rapidly, 
with Burmese military and security 
forces violently attacking and round-
ing up peaceful protestors, civil serv-
ants, community leaders, journalists, 
and even emergency medical personnel. 
The death toll is now estimated at 200. 
The democratically elected Govern-
ment of Burma, to be sure, had serious 
flaws, but it had made significant 
progress in improving the lives of Bur-
mese citizens. The House Democracy 
Partnership had begun to work with 
the democratically elected parliament, 
as had the National Democratic Insti-
tute. The International Republican In-
stitute had begun to work on local gov-
ernance. That progress must be con-
solidated, built on, and expanded, not 
washed away by the greed of a few gen-
erals in fear of losing their wealth, los-
ing the control they exercise at the ex-
pense of the Burmese people. 
I strongly support the Biden adminis-
tration’s decision to place sanctions on 
senior military leaders and military- 
owned businesses. The economic and 
political pressure must be intense. 
We must do more, including working 
with our friends and allies in the re-
gion, particularly members of the 
ASEAN community, to keep up the 
drumbeat, to keep up the pressure, for 
the junta to step down and to restore 
the 
democratically 
elected 
govern-
ment. 
We must do all we can, and time is 
not on our side. These two bills are a 
beginning. They signify a unified and 
urgent sense on the part of the House 
that this coup simply must be reversed 
and democratic government restored in 
Burma. 
Madam Speaker, I am proud to stand 
with colleagues today in solidarity, 
and I urge support of these two bills. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
3 minutes to the esteemed gentle-
woman from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, 
I thank the distinguished chairman for 
his leadership, and I thank the ranking 
member as well. 
Madam Speaker, I stand here today 
to recognize the hardworking Burmese 
Americans who are here, who are fight-
ing every day for their friends and 
their relatives in their native land. 
On February 1, 2021, hours before the 
Burmese Parliament was to convene in 
a new session, Aung San Suu Kyi, the 
leader of the Burma ruling party; and 
President Win Myint, the duly-elected 
head of government, were deposed in a 
military coup. 
How shameful. 
As that coup was done, violence pre-
vailed. And as violence prevailed, peo-
ple lost their lives. 
b 1600 
This is a worthy act of condemna-
tion. I also support H. Res. 134, the res-
olution 
condemning 
the 
coup 
in 
Burma, and condemning the still de-
taining of Aung San Suu Kyi to her 
place of residence. She is in danger. 
So I rise today to support H.R. 1112, 
which declares: ‘‘It is the policy of the 
United States to instruct, as appro-
priate, representatives of the United 
States Government to use the voice, 
vote, and influence of the United

States at the United Nations to hold 
accountable those responsible for the 
military coup in Burma.’’ 
The legislation also directs that not 
later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this act that Congress 
gets a report from the Secretary of 
State as relates to the military coup in 
Burma, and provide a description of the 
efforts taken by the United States to 
help the people of Burma restore their 
democratic form of government. 
I want to cite a constituent in my 
district—first of all, the people from 
Burma who have been generous in their 
help 
of 
Houstonians, 
their 
fellow 
Houstonians, in Hurricane Harvey, in 
the freeze, in COVID–19—Mr. Mouton, 
who has provided resources to all of the 
people in the area representing the 
community of those from Burma. He 
has been generous in his support when 
people have been in need. That is what 
people from Burma here in the United 
States do. 
So this statement that we are mak-
ing is to say that we are standing with 
the freedom fighters. We are standing 
with those who believe in democracy. 
And I want to salute the Parliament. 
The Parliament and the duly elected 
members of the Burmese Parliament 
who have taken it upon themselves to 
continue serving as representatives of 
the people through alternative meth-
ods of communicating and convening is 
courageous and laudable and inspires 
the respect of freedom-loving people 
everywhere. 
It is our goal, as we stand on the 
floor of the House, for the American 
peoples’ voices to be heard through 
H.R. 1112, the Protect Democracy in 
Burma Act of 2021, and H. Res. 134, the 
resolution condemning the coup in 
Burma, and to support the American- 
Burmese community. 
Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the 
Committee on the Judiciary and the Member 
of Congress for the Eighteenth Congressional 
District of Texas, the home of a large and vi-
brant Burmese community, I rise in strong 
support of H.R. 1112, the ‘‘Protect Democracy 
In Burma Act of 2021,’’ which condemns the 
military coup in Burma and calls for the uncon-
ditional release of detained democratically- 
elected leaders and civil society members and 
declares it the policy of the United States to 
support a return to Burma’s democratic transi-
tion. 
Madam Speaker, on February 1, 2021, 
hours before Burmese Parliament was to con-
vene in a new session Daw Aung San Suu 
Kyi, the leader of Burma’s ruling party, and 
President Win Myint, the duly elected head of 
government, were deposed in a military coup 
on February 1, 2021. 
As part of the military coup, the Burmese 
military declared martial law, suspended the 
civilian led government, and detained newly 
elected Members of Parliament in the capitol, 
Naypyidaw, thereby usurping the role of the 
democratically elected government and par-
liament. 
The inability of newly elected Members of 
Parliament to begin their official mandate due 
to the Burmese military’s actions directly 
threatens the democratic trajectory of Burma’s 
Parliament, and thereby the country. 
By preventing the Parliament from com-
pleting its work, the Burmese military has ren-
dered impossible and effectively nullified the 
international collaborative relationships that 
have supported and strengthened the institu-
tion, including the Burmese parliament’s part-
nership with HDP. 
Because of the Burmese military’s seizure 
of government through the detention of State 
Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win 
Myint, and other government leaders, Burma 
is not represented by a democratically-elected 
government. 
Madam Speaker, H.R. 1112 declares it to 
be the policy of the United States to instruct, 
as appropriate, representatives of the United 
States Government to use the voice, vote, and 
influence of the United States at the United 
Nations to hold accountable those responsible 
for the military coup in Burma. 
The legislation also directs the representa-
tives of the United States Government to en-
gage with the Association of Southeast Asian 
Nations (ASEAN) and ASEAN member states 
to promote a return to Burma’s democratic 
transition and democratic values throughout 
Southeast Asia and support the centrality of 
ASEAN within the regional architecture of the 
Indo-Pacific. 
Finally, the legislation directs that not later 
than 90 days after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit 
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the 
Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on For-
eign Relations and the Committee on Appro-
priations of the Senate a report on the military 
coup in Burma and a description of efforts 
taken by the United States to help the people 
of Burma restore their democratic form of gov-
ernment. 
Madam Speaker, the will and determination 
of those duly elected Members of the Bur-
mese Parliament who are taking it upon them-
selves to continue serving as representatives 
of the people through alternative methods of 
communicating and convening is courageous, 
laudable, and inspires the respect of freedom 
loving people everywhere. 
That is why I strongly support H.R. 1112, 
the ‘‘Protect Democracy in Burma Act of 
2021,’’ and urge my colleagues to join me in 
voting for its passage. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, Members across the 
aisle share the same concerns about 
Burma’s military coup, and the brutal 
human rights violations it has caused. 
This bill ensures that the United 
States of America’s condemnation of 
this coup is a matter of record, and it 
asks the administration to report to 
Congress on this critical issue. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this measure, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume for 
the purpose of closing. 
Madam Speaker, again, I want to 
thank Mr. CONNOLLY for introducing 
this legislation, and I want to thank 
Ranking Member MCCAUL and my col-
leagues on the other side of the aisle 
for making sure that we have a sin-
gular voice going forward. 
The world cannot turn a blind eye to 
the violence perpetrated by the Bur-
mese military. With this important 
measure, the United States sends a 
clear signal that we stand with the 
people of Burma in their longstanding 
pursuit for democracy, and a strong 
message to the Burmese military, or to 
anyone, for that matter, who fail to up-
hold the will of the people. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
MEEKS) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 1112, as 
amended. 
The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the 
rules were suspended and the bill, as 
amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on 
the table. 
f 
CONDEMNING MILITARY COUP IN 
BURMA 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I move 
to suspend the rules and agree to the 
resolution (H. Res. 134) condemning the 
military coup that took place on Feb-
ruary 1, 2021, in Burma and the Bur-
mese military detention of civilian 
leaders, calling for the release of all 
those detained and for those elected to 
serve in Parliament to resume their 
duties, and for other purposes. 
The Clerk read the title of the resolu-
tion. 
The text of the resolution is as fol-
lows: 
H. RES. 134 
Whereas the military of Burma (herein-
after referred to as the ‘‘Tatmadaw’’) held 
power in Burma between 1962 and 2011; 
Whereas provisions in the 2008 Constitu-
tion of Burma, written by the Tatmadaw, al-
locate 25 percent of parliamentary seats to 
the Tatmadaw, conferring powers on the 
Tatmadaw that have been used to suppress 
basic rights, including freedoms of expres-
sion, assembly, and association; 
Whereas, in 2010, Burma conducted its first 
election, which was neither free nor fair, 
under the new Constitution, and which was 
boycotted by the National League for De-
mocracy (NLD); 
Whereas Burma conducted elections in No-
vember 2015, in which the NLD came to 
power; 
Whereas Burma’s November 8, 2020, elec-
tions resulted in the NLD securing enough 
seats in Parliament to form the next govern-
ment, notwithstanding the disenfranchise-
ment of more than 1,500,000 voters, mostly 
from 
ethnic 
minority 
communities 
in 
Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, and 
Chin states; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw conducted a coup 
against the civilian government on February 
1, 2021, hours before Parliament was to con-
vene in a new session; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw claimed they had 
evidence of parliamentary election fraud per-
petrated by the NLD and Burma’s Union 
Election Commission, an allegation that 
contradicted the judgment of several inde-
pendent election monitoring organizations 
that the electoral process and outcome were 
credible despite minor irregularities; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has detained un-
lawfully State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi,

President Win Myint, and other leaders of 
the NLD, as well as prodemocracy activists 
from the 88 Generation and other civil soci-
ety leaders; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has charged State 
Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi with importing 
walkie-talkies illegally and President Win 
Myint with violating prohibitions on gath-
erings during the COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has declared a 
state of emergency until new elections are 
held in one year; 
Whereas the Tatmadaw has restricted free-
dom of movement, telecommunications, and 
the media, limiting access to information to 
and from Burma during a political and public 
health crisis; 
Whereas, on January 31, 2021, the Sec-
retary-General of the United Nations spokes-
person released the following condemnation 
of the coup, which reads, in part, ‘‘The Sec-
retary-General strongly condemns the deten-
tion of State Counsellor Daw Aung San Suu 
Kyi, President U Win Myint and other polit-
ical leaders on the eve of the opening session 
of Myanmar’s new Parliament. He expresses 
his grave concern regarding the declaration 
of the transfer of all legislative, executive 
and judicial powers to the military. These 
developments represent a serious blow to 
democratic reforms in Myanmar.’’; 
Whereas, on February 1, 2021, President Jo-
seph R. Biden, Jr., condemned the coup in a 
statement that read, in part, ‘‘The military’s 
seizure of power in Burma, the detention of 
Aung San Suu Kyi and other civilian offi-
cials, and the declaration of a national state 
of emergency are a direct assault on the 
country’s transition to democracy and the 
rule of law.’’; 
Whereas protests opposing the coup have 
swept Burma; 
Whereas the House of Representatives 
passed H. Res. 1091 on December 13, 2018, ex-
pressing the sense of the House of Represent-
atives that the atrocities committed against 
the Rohingya by the Tatmadaw and security 
forces beginning in August 2017 constituted 
crimes against humanity and genocide; and 
Whereas the United States has sanctioned 
Tatmadaw officials previously, including 
Commander in Chief Min Aung Hlaing, for 
the 
atrocities 
committed 
against 
the 
Rohingya, and the International Court of 
Justice is investigating the Tatmadaw’s con-
duct: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the House of Representa-
tives— 
(1) condemns the military coup that took 
place on February 1, 2021; 
(2) stands with the people of Burma in 
their ambition for sustainable peace, a gen-
uine democracy, and the realization of 
human rights for all, including for ethnic mi-
norities whose human rights have been vio-
lated 
repeatedly 
and 
who 
have 
been 
disenfranchised historically; 
(3) condemns any attacks on civilians and 
supports the use of all diplomatic and devel-
opment tools to ensure that civilians are 
safe during conflict; 
(4) calls on the Tatmadaw to— 
(A) release all those currently detained ar-
bitrarily as a result of the February 1st coup; 
(B) restore all forms of communications, 
including internet services; 
(C) remove all impediments to free travel 
that have been imposed as a result of the 
coup, apart from legitimate travel restric-
tions related to the COVID–19 pandemic; 
(D) return to power all members of the ci-
vilian government; 
(E) allow for freedom of expression, includ-
ing the right to protest, press freedom, and 
freedom of movement; 
(F) allow unfettered reporting from local, 
national, and international media; and 
(G) refrain from mass evictions; and 
(5) calls on the President of the United 
States and the Secretary of State to— 
(A) encourage both the return to power of 
all members of the civilian government and, 
subsequently, constitutional reforms to ad-
dress the power conferred to the Tatmadaw 
in Parliament and the disenfranchisement of 
ethnic minorities in Burma; 
(B) reinstate sanctions and impose new re-
strictions aimed at the Tatmadaw and those 
responsible for the February 1st coup; 
(C) work with the international partners 
and multilateral institutions, including the 
United Nations Security Council, to con-
demn the coup and enact multilateral, tar-
geted sanctions on the military, military- 
owned businesses, including the Myanmar 
Economic Corporation and Myanmar Eco-
nomic Holdings Limited, and others con-
nected to the coup, including an inter-
national arms embargo; 
(D) coordinate with international partners 
and allies, especially those with economic 
investments in Burma, with respect to 
planned economic consequences for the coup 
and ensuring those consequences are tailored 
to avoid impacting Burmese civilians; 
(E) ensure that targeted sanctions allow 
all necessary exemptions to permit the deliv-
ery of humanitarian assistance to civilians 
in need; 
(F) ensure that United States-based social 
media companies, including Facebook, not 
allow their platforms to be used as vehicles 
for disinformation campaigns or advocating 
violence against the Burmese people; 
(G) implement restrictions on diplomatic, 
economic, and security relations with Burma 
until a full restoration of civilian-controlled 
Parliament, and release of those detained in 
connection with the coup; and 
(H) direct the United States Permanent 
Representative to the United Nations to use 
the voice, vote, and influence of the United 
States to bring about greater international 
cooperation to pursue justice and account-
ability in Burma. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
New York (Mr. MEEKS) and the gen-
tleman from Texas (Mr. MCCAUL) each 
will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
have 5 legislative days in which to re-
vise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on H. Res. 
134. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, I want to thank 
Representative LEVIN
for sponsoring 
this resolution, which condemns the 
military coup that occurred in Burma 
on February 1, 2021. 
It has been more than 45 days since 
the Burmese military, also known as 
the Tatmadaw, arrested several demo-
cratically-elected members of govern-
ment, including the President Win 
Myint, and the State Counselor, Aung 
San Suu Kyi, and declared a year-long 
state of emergency, and nullified the 
results of Burma’s November 8, 2020, 
elections. 
Despite Tatmadaw claims of election 
fraud, 
several 
independent 
election 
monitoring organizations found that 
the electoral process and outcome were 
credible, even despite minor irregular-
ities. 
Since the coup took place, we have 
seen thousands of protesters take to 
the streets to make sure that their 
voices were heard; voices in opposition 
to the coup and in support of democ-
racy. And as those protests continued, 
we have seen security forces increas-
ingly use violence in an attempt to 
quell the demonstrations. 
The U.N. estimates that 149 people 
have been killed since the coup oc-
curred on February 1. Fifty-seven peo-
ple were killed this past weekend 
alone. 
It is imperative that democracies 
around the world speak out in con-
demnation of this coup and the arrest 
of democratically-elected government 
officials. It is vital that we speak in 
support of democracy, of all of those 
members of civil society who have been 
arrested, and those in Burma who are 
protesting for the restoration of de-
mocracy. And it is important that we 
make it clear to the Tatmadaw, includ-
ing through additional targeted sanc-
tions that leverage sources of income 
for the military, that these actions are 
absolutely unacceptable. 
We are sadly, in this body, all too fa-
miliar with the rippling effects of at-
tempts to undo democratic elections. 
We have an obligation to speak up and 
speak 
out 
wherever 
democracy 
is 
threatened. 
Madam Speaker, this is a very impor-
tant resolution. I support it and urge 
my colleagues to do the same, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, the House has al-
ways come together to condemn human 
rights violations around the world, 
whether it is in Rwanda or Xinjiang; or 
as we discuss here today, in Burma. 
Only 3 years ago, the House over-
whelmingly passed Mr. CHABOT’s reso-
lution to label the Burmese military’s 
crimes against the Rohingya Muslim 
population as genocide. 
Unfortunately, we are once again fac-
ing shocking violence in Burma as a 
pro-democracy movement pushes back 
against the recent military coup. Hun-
dreds are reported dead, with many 
more injured. And more than 2,000 peo-
ple have been arrested, simply for 
peacefully asking for freedom. America 
cannot stand idly and silently by while 
atrocities like this happen. 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to join me in supporting this 
resolution. With over 60 Republican 
and Democrat cosponsors, this resolu-
tion, and this issue, is truly bipartisan. 
I want to thank Mr. LEVIN for intro-
ducing this resolution. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Madam Speaker, I yield 
5 minutes to the distinguished gen-
tleman from Michigan (Mr. LEVIN), a

valued member of the House Foreign 
Affairs Committee, and author of this 
important resolution. 
Mr. LEVIN of Michigan. Madam 
Speaker, I thank Chairman MEEKS and 
Ranking Member MCCAUL
for their 
support in bringing this resolution to 
the floor today. 
Last month, the Burmese military, 
Tatmadaw, staged a coup and quashed 
Burma’s fragile experiment with de-
mocracy. 
Burma had struggled during that 
time to enfranchise its minority popu-
lation, and to respect their human 
rights. The genocide of the Rohingya is 
perhaps the best known example, but it 
is far from the only one. 
In fact, when Burma’s November 8, 
2020, elections resulted in the National 
League for Democracy winning an 
overwhelming victory and securing 
enough seats in Parliament to form the 
next 
government, 
it 
was 
notwith-
standing the disenfranchisement of 
more than 1,500,000 voters, mostly from 
ethnic 
minority 
communities 
in 
Kachin, Karen, Mon, Rakhine, Shan, 
and Chin states. 
The resolution before us today con-
demns the February 1st coup unequivo-
cally and calls on the Tatmadaw to 
free all those they have detained arbi-
trarily and return members of the ci-
vilian government to power. 
We are considering this resolution at 
a critical time. More than 2,100 people 
have been arrested, charged, or sen-
tenced in relation to the coup. The 
military and police have been ordered 
to fire on protesters. More than 200 
people have been killed in cold blood in 
these violent crackdowns. 
On top of mobile data blackouts, 
there 
is 
now 
concern 
that 
the 
Tatmadaw could cut off WiFi as well, 
and even reports of fiber lines being 
cut, which would cut off access to the 
internet altogether. 
Clearly, there is no time to waste. 
The junta’s rule must end. But it will 
not be enough simply to return to the 
status quo ante. This resolution calls 
on President Biden and Secretary 
Blinken to encourage not just the re-
turn to power of the civilian govern-
ment, but also, subsequently, constitu-
tional reforms to address the undemo-
cratic 
power 
reserved 
for 
the 
Tatmadaw in Parliament, and the dis-
enfranchisement of Burma’s ethnic mi-
norities. 
Democracy is something we must 
ever defend and nurture. That is why 
we who believe that all people are cre-
ated equal and must be treated as such, 
whether here in America or anywhere 
else around the globe, must speak up, 
not only for full civilian control in 
Burma, but also for democracy, not for 
some, but for all. 
And so this resolution makes clear 
that Congress stands with all of the 
people of Burma in their ambition for 
sustainable peace, a genuine democ-
racy, and the realization of human 
rights for all. 
Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Rank-
ing Member CHABOT for authoring this 
resolution with me, as well as Sub-
committee Chairman BERA, Chairman 
MEEKS, Ranking Member MCCAUL, and 
all of my colleagues who have cospon-
sored this important resolution, which 
I am proud to say, on a completely bi-
partisan basis, we passed through the 
House 
Foreign 
Affairs 
Committee 
unanimously. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this resolution. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from New 
Jersey (Mr. SMITH). 
Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the ranking member 
for yielding, and I thank the chairman 
for his leadership. 
I would especially like to thank Mr. 
LEVIN for his resolution condemning 
the military coup in Burma, and call-
ing for release of all those who have 
been detained, as well as restoring 
those elected to serve in Parliament to 
a position that allows them to fulfill 
their important duties. 
I would also like to thank Mr. CON-
NOLLY for his Protect Democracy in 
Burma Act, H.R. 1112, and the impor-
tant report that it will authorize. 
Mr. Speaker, 24 years ago, in 1997, I 
chaired my first hearing on Burmese 
human rights abuse, and chaired addi-
tional hearings after that, including in 
1998 and 2006. I also introduced several 
resolutions 
addressing 
the 
ongoing 
egregious crisis, including H. Res. 1710, 
which decried the house arrest of Aung 
San Suu Kyi, and called on the Bur-
mese military regime to end its cam-
paign of religious and ethnic persecu-
tion of the Rohingya people, amount-
ing to crimes against humanity. 
b 1615 
Thus, after decades of abuse, rape, 
torture, and murder, it is incredibly 
tragic as to how little has changed in 
that country. 
As H. Res. 134 points out, the Bur-
mese Government’s unlawful detention 
of State Counselor Aung San Suu Kyi, 
as well as the crackdown on democracy 
advocates and the squelching of free 
expression and other fundamental civil 
and political rights, is outrageous and 
begs immediate reform and correction. 
The United States must, and I be-
lieve will, in a bipartisan way, and 
with the executive branch taking the 
lead, do its part. Every sanction of le-
verage must be deployed, and we must 
call on all of our international partners 
to join us in those efforts. 
The most glaring example of basic re-
ligious persecution, Mr. Speaker, is the 
oppression 
of 
Burma’s 
Muslim 
Rohingya population. This persecution 
has been aided and abetted in part by 
religious and nationalist extremists 
such as the Buddhist monk Wirathu 
and the 969 movement. 
We also see religious persecution 
intertwined with ethnic persecution, as 
in the case of the Karen, Kachin, and 
Shan people, many of whom are Chris-
tians. I have met many of them over 
the years. 
Many of you have seen the riveting 
image of a Catholic nun, Sister Ann 
Rose Nu Tawang, kneeling before a 
group of militarized police, pleading 
that they do not shoot the protesters. 
Sadly, at least two protesters lost their 
lives that day. But what gives us at 
least a glimmer of hope is that oppo-
site Sister Ann Rose, two of the offi-
cers, who are presumably Buddhists, 
also got down on their knees in re-
sponse that this ought to be peaceful 
and not violent. 
It is an image which gives one some 
hope that the people of Burma can 
overcome their differences and unite 
for peace and justice and for the ben-
efit of all Burmese, regardless of reli-
gion, ethnicity, or political affiliation. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank my distin-
guished chairman and the ranking 
member for their leadership on this. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ohio 
(Mr. CHABOT). 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding, and I thank 
the ranking member for his leadership 
on this issue and so many issues that 
are so significant across the globe. For-
tunately, our committee usually works 
in a bipartisan manner, so I want to 
thank my colleagues on the other side 
of the aisle, especially the chairman, 
for his leadership on this as well. 
As the ranking member of the For-
eign Affairs Committee’s Asia, the Pa-
cific, Central Asia, and Nonprolifera-
tion Subcommittee, I rise today in sup-
port of H.R. 134, legislation that Con-
gressman LEVIN and I introduced con-
demning the Burmese military’s Feb-
ruary 1 coup against the civilian gov-
ernment. The military’s decision to 
seize control and detain top political 
leaders, including Aung San Suu Kyi 
and President Win Myint, was a brazen 
assault on Burma’s fledgling democ-
racy. 
Self-government is not some sort of 
temporary arrangement or a gift from 
the military. Burma’s generals cannot 
simply back out of democracy when it 
no longer serves their purposes. 
The situation has only gotten worse 
since the coup began. To date, the mili-
tary has killed hundreds of people and 
has detained thousands of innocent 
people as political prisoners, and the 
conditions in many instances are hor-
rible. 
What the military is doing here is 
just unconscionable. These murders 
and detentions are blatant violations 
of the rights of the Burmese people 
who, after all, only want to have what 
so many other countries have across 
the globe, and that is the ability to de-
termine their own leadership and their 
own course of action for their own fam-
ilies and their children and grand-
children. 
We should honor—the whole world 
really should honor—the courage of the 
Burmese people who have been peace-
fully protesting for quite some time

now. Their bravery and determination 
are recognized and supported across 
the globe. America and the world stand 
with them in their struggle against 
tyranny. 
Unfortunately, the PRC in this case 
and in so many other cases across the 
globe, whether it is Cambodia or other 
areas where they tend, their actions 
are malevolent. They are undermining 
democracy; they are undermining free-
dom; and they are undermining legiti-
mate governments. They are rewarding 
bad behavior, as they are doing in this 
case, and that is too bad because the 
PRC wants to be a major force and 
wants to be a country that other coun-
tries can look up to. 
Unfortunately, they are doing all the 
wrong things too often, and that is 
what they are doing here as well. Rath-
er than putting pressure on the mili-
tary in Burma, they are essentially 
looking the other way or supporting 
them in what they are doing. 
The bravery and determination of the 
people must be recognized across the 
globe. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I continue 
to reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT). 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Speaker, I in-
clude in the RECORD a report from the 
Associated Press detailing the deten-
tion of AP reporter Thein Zaw by Bur-
mese authorities. 
[From the AP, Mar. 12, 2021] 
MYANMAR COURT EXTENDS DETENTION OF AP 
JOURNALIST 
YANGON, 
MYANMAR
(AP).—A 
court 
in 
Myanmar extended on Friday the pretrial de-
tention of an Associated Press journalist 
who was arrested while covering demonstra-
tions against a coup. He is facing a charge 
that could send him to prison for three 
years. 
Thein Zaw, 32, was one of nine media work-
ers taken into custody during a protest on 
Feb. 27 in Yangon, the country’s largest city, 
and has been held without bail. His next 
hearing at the Kamayut Township court will 
be on March 24. 
Friday’s hearing, which Thein Zaw at-
tended via videoconference, came at the end 
of his initial remand period. 
Thein Zaw and at least six other members 
of the media have been charged with vio-
lating a public order law, according to his 
lawyer, Tin Zar Oo, and the independent As-
sistance Association for Political Prisoners. 
Separate hearings were held Friday for the 
other detained journalists. 
Tin Zar Oo and one of Thein Zaw’s brothers 
were allowed into the courtroom to take 
part in the 10-minute videoconference. Tin 
Zar Oo said she was able to submit docu-
ments giving her power of attorney for the 
case, but only at the next hearing might be 
allowed to submit a bail application. 
A representative of the U.S. Embassy was 
also present, said Aryani Manring, a spokes-
woman for the mission. 
Thein Zaw had not been seen by his lawyer 
or any of his family members since his ar-
rest. Tin Zar Oo said visits at lnsein Prison, 
where her client is being held, are not al-
lowed because of coronavirus concerns, so his 
family has been dropping off food and sup-
plies for him at the gate. 
Tin Zar Oo said that her client looked 
healthy during Friday’s hearing, but he suf-
fers from asthma at night. She said Thein 
Zaw’s brother noted that he had lost weight. 
Thein 
Zaw 
was 
arrested 
as 
he 
was 
photographing police, some of them armed, 
charging down a street at anti-coup pro-
testers. A video shows that although he 
stepped to the side of the street to get out of 
their way, several police rushed over and 
surrounded him. One put him in a chokehold 
as he was handcuffed and then taken away. 
According to the Assistance Association 
for Political Prisoners, 38 journalists have 
been detained since the military ousted the 
elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on 
Feb. 1. Nineteen are still incarcerated. 
The group says it has verified the deten-
tions of more than 2,000 people as well as 69 
deaths. 
On Friday, local media in Shan State in 
eastern Myanmar reported that a freelance 
journalist from Poland had been beaten and 
arrested by security forces. 
The online Kanbawza Tai News said a for-
eign photojournalist was arrested Thursday 
while taking pictures of a protest in the city 
of Taunggyi. A photo provided to the news 
site shows a man trapped against a wall with 
one arm raised as he is surrounded by about 
10 soldiers. 
Germany’s dpa news agency said the man, 
Robert Bociaga, 30, has been working for the 
news service, and it has not been able to con-
tact him. 
‘‘We are deeply shocked by the arrest and 
apparent mistreatment of Robert Bociaga,’’ 
said 
the 
agency’s 
editor-in-chief, 
Sven 
Goesmann. ‘‘This is an intolerable and unac-
ceptable attack on the freedom of the press 
and, even in this brutal form, is unfortu-
nately not an isolated case.’’ 
The Polish Foreign Ministry confirmed the 
arrest of a Polish journalist and said it was 
trying to contact the detained man and ob-
tain information about his health and legal 
situation. 
Earlier this week, Myanmar authorities 
canceled the licenses of five local outlets 
that had extensively covered the protests. 
Mizzima, Democratic Voice of Burma, Khit 
Thit Media, Myanmar Now and 7Day News 
have 
continued 
operating 
despite 
being 
barred from broadcasting or publishing on 
any media platform. 
The Associated Press and many press free-
dom organizations have called for the release 
of Thein Zaw and the other detained journal-
ists. 
The U.S. government, in addition to criti-
cizing 
the 
coup 
and 
the 
violence 
of 
Myanmar’s security forces, has condemned 
the crackdown on the press in the Southeast 
Asian nation. 
‘‘We are deeply concerned about the in-
creasing attacks on the freedom of expres-
sion, including for members of the press. We 
call for the release of journalists and for all 
others who have been unjustly detained,’’ 
U.S. State Department spokesperson Ned 
Price told reporters in Washington on Thurs-
day. 
Even during Suu Kyi’s time in office, jour-
nalists were often sued for their reporting. 
In the highest-profile case, two journalists 
working for the Reuters news agency were 
arrested in 2017 while working on a story 
about 
military 
violence 
directed 
at 
Myanmar’s Rohingya minority. They were 
accused of illegally possessing official docu-
ments and sentenced to seven years behind 
bars before being freed in 2019 in a mass pres-
idential pardon. 
Mr. BURCHETT. Mr. Zaw has been 
jailed for covering the violence leveled 
against anti-coup demonstrators in 
Burma. 
Thanks to Mr. Zaw and other jour-
nalists on the ground, we know what is 
going on in Burma is pure evil. The 
autocratic strongmen leading this coup 
are using deadly force to crack down 
on all dissenting speech. Burmese au-
thorities, under the direction of these 
military thugs, are actively murdering 
demonstrators, 
arresting 
thousands, 
and imprisoning international report-
ers covering the situation. 
Senseless violence, military rule, and 
imprisoning political opponents all fly 
directly in the face of the democratic 
values we cherish as Americans. 
Today, this Chamber has the oppor-
tunity to condemn the hostile takeover 
of the Burmese Government, defend the 
demonstrators looking for peace, and 
stand up for democracy in Burma. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage 
my colleagues to support both H. Res. 
134 and H.R. 1112. 
Mr. MEEKS. I continue to reserve 
the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker. 
Mr. MCCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, the Burmese military is 
using brutal violence to drag Burma 
back into repression and isolation. We 
should condemn this coup with one 
united voice as the United States of 
America through its Congress. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this measure, and I yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I yield my-
self the balance of my time. 
Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that 
the Burmese military respect the will 
of the Burmese people and, one, return 
power to those democratically elected; 
and, two, release civilian leaders taken 
into custody. 
Daily protests against the military 
coup continue to occur in towns and 
cities throughout Burma, and the secu-
rity forces are using increasing bru-
tality to crack down against those 
demonstrating. 
We must make it clear that the 
United States is watching and that we 
support the restoration of democracy. 
Again, I want to thank Mr. LEVIN, 
the ranking member, and my col-
leagues on both sides of the aisle for 
coming together so that the Burmese 
people know that the Congress of the 
United States of America stands to-
gether in their fight for democracy. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. 
RUIZ). The question is on the motion 
offered by the gentleman from New 
York (Mr. MEEKS) that the House sus-
pend the rules and agree to the resolu-
tion, H. Res. 134. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3(s) of House Resolution 
8, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this motion are 
postponed.

LATRICE POWELL TRIBUTE 
(Ms. PELOSI asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, it is with 
great pride that I rise to recognize the 
outstanding service of an esteemed 
member of my staff known and re-
spected by all here: our deputy floor di-
rector, Latrice Powell. 
In her 13 years on Capitol Hill, 
Latrice’s name has become synony-
mous with cool-headed leadership and 
institutional expertise. We all know 
her as a maestro of the floor, master-
fully directing legislative procedures 
and voting schedules, all while antici-
pating and managing the diverse needs 
of our Caucus. 
Indeed, her skills as a coalition- 
builder and communicator help our 
Democratic Caucus honor this proud 
truth: Our diversity is our strength, 
but our unity is our power. 
Members are particularly grateful for 
Latrice’s calm and trusted presence 
this past year as she helped our Caucus 
and the Congress navigate this time of 
pandemic, and she has done so with 
equanimity and excellence. 
Throughout her tenure on our floor 
team, Latrice has helped guide the pas-
sage and then the enactment of hun-
dreds of bills for the people. While she 
has helped advance this great progress, 
she has made history as the first Afri-
can-American assistant manager of the 
Democratic Cloakroom and then again 
at the start of the 116th Congress when 
it was my honor to appoint her to be 
the first African-American deputy floor 
director. 
A 
Jackson, 
Mississippi, 
native, 
Latrice first came to the Hill to work 
under the leadership of our chairman— 
that 
is 
you, 
Mr. 
Speaker—BENNIE 
THOMPSON. She then joined the staff of 
the Congressional Black Caucus under 
Chairs EMANUEL CLEAVER and MARCIA 
FUDGE
before 
serving 
as 
assistant 
Cloakroom manager. In each of these 
positions, she acquired a sterling rep-
utation for her ability, and I know that 
each of these Members take great pride 
in her success. 
While Latrice’s trusted presence on 
this House floor will be missed, we are 
grateful for her service and for her 
work to forge a path for others to fol-
low. 
On behalf of the House of Representa-
tives, I thank Latrice Powell and wish 
her the best in the next stages of her 
journey. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER). 
Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentlewoman for yielding, and I 
rise to join her in recognizing and 
thanking Latrice Powell for the ex-
traordinary service that she has given 
to this institution. 
Members from both sides of the aisle 
have come to know and respect Latrice 
for her deep knowledge of floor proce-
dure, her acumen, and her experience 
helping to manage the floor during 
very difficult votes and debate. 
Not only has she served the Speaker 
as her deputy floor director, Latrice 
previously helped run the Democratic 
Cloakroom, as was pointed out, and be-
fore that was director of operations for 
Member services for the Congressional 
Black Caucus as well as a staff member 
for the gentleman from Mississippi, our 
Speaker 
pro 
tempore, 
Mr. 
BENNIE 
THOMPSON. That is a very distinguished 
record of service to this House and to 
our country. 
Now, I would be remiss if I did not 
observe that Latrice Powell is a grad-
uate of the University of Maryland, 
and is a proud Terp. What a wonderful 
and distinguished academic institution 
she has graduated from. She also holds 
a master’s degree in counseling and 
psychology from Bowie State Univer-
sity. 
What is significant about the Univer-
sity of Maryland and Bowie State Uni-
versity? They are in my district, so, 
Mr. Speaker, you know what extraor-
dinary institutions they are. 
Today, Latrice lives in Upper Marl-
boro. Whose district do you think that 
is, Mr. Speaker? Just take a wild guess. 
The Fifth Congressional District of 
Maryland that I have had the proud 
privilege of serving for the last four 
decades.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1569 
March 18, 2021 
Sadly, Latrice will shortly be leaving 
the House. You have heard me say this 
about other of our staff: The American 
people have no idea how talented our 
staff is and how hardworking, how pa-
triotic, and how committed they are to 
this country and to this institution. 
I would hope that all of us would, on 
a regular basis, tell them. 
Latrice is an extraordinary person, 
but she is representative of those who 
work with us. That is the great truth 
and great privilege that we have as 
Members of this House serving with 
such extraordinary people who serve 
this institution. They serve us, and 
they serve this country so well. 
I know that feeling all too well, hav-
ing just said good-bye to my floor di-
rector, Shuwanza Goff. All of you know 
Shuwanza. She is now serving the 
President of the United States of 
America. She, too, was a historic first 
on this floor. 
I hope that all the Members will join 
me on both sides of the aisle. For the 
most part, this staff is serving this 
House and this institution, not a party 
and not a philosophy, but serving an 
institution that we have so proudly 
call the people’s House. 
Bill Natcher from Kentucky was the 
chairman of the Appropriations Com-
mittee on which NANCY
and I both 
served. He used to say, when he 
brought his bill to the floor: This is the 
people’s bill in the people’s House. 
How proud we are that nobody can 
appoint us to this institution; we have 
to be elected to the House of Rep-
resentatives. 
Latrice, you have served all of us so 
very, very well. We love you, and we 
wish you the very best in the days 
ahead. God bless you, and Godspeed. 
We love you. 
Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, reclaim-
ing my time, I thank the gentleman for 
his wonderful remarks, and I want to 
join him in acknowledging the leader-
ship of Shuwanza when she served here 
for all that time, and now we are very 
proud of the fact that she is in the ad-
ministration. But every chance we get, 
we should acknowledge the great serv-
ice that she provided here as we ac-
knowledge and say thank you to 
Latrice Powell and wish her well as she 
goes forward. She made us all so very, 
very proud and continues to do so. 
Thank you so much, Latrice.

RAISING A QUESTION OF THE 
PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE 
Mr. MCCARTHY. Madam Speaker, I 
rise to raise a question of the privileges 
of the House, and I offer a resolution 
(H. Res. 243) removing a certain Mem-
ber from a certain committee of the 
House of Representatives. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). The Clerk will report the 
resolution. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
H. RES. 243 
Whereas Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation Christopher Wray said in July 
2020 that ‘‘Beijing is engaged in a highly so-
phisticated malign foreign influence cam-
paign’’ 
that 
involves 
‘‘subversive, 
undeclared, criminal, or coercive attempts 
to sway our government’s policies, distort 
our country’s public discourse, and under-
mine confidence in our democratic processes 
and values’’; 
Whereas Representative Eric Swalwell has 
not denied public reporting that a suspected 
Chinese intelligence operative helped raise 
money for Representative Swalwell’s polit-
ical campaigns and facilitated the potential 
assignment of interns into Representative 
Swalwell’s offices; 
Whereas Representative Swalwell has not 
denied other troublesome elements of public 
reporting; 
Whereas clause 1 of rule XXIII of the Rules 
of the House of Representatives provides, ‘‘A 
Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, 
officer, or employee of the House shall be-
have at all times in a manner that shall re-
flect creditably on the House.’’; and 
Whereas 
Representative 
Eric 
Swalwell 
should be removed from his committee as-
signment in light of conduct he has exhib-
ited: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the following named Mem-
ber be, and is hereby, removed from the fol-
lowing committee of the House of Represent-
atives: 
PERMANENT SELECT COMMITTEE ON INTEL-
LIGENCE: Mr. Swalwell of California. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The res-
olution qualifies. 
MOTION TO TABLE 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I have 
a motion at the desk. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows:

ENERGY SECURITY IN EUROPE 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, as co- 
chair of the Congressional Ukraine 
Caucus, I rise with great concern re-
garding Europe’s energy security with 
the imminent completion of the Nord 
Stream 2 pipeline. 
Nord Stream 2 is a Russian malign 
influence energy project designed to 
ensnare Europe and weaken the sov-
ereignty of Ukraine. Tragically, Rus-
sia’s illegal war in and on Ukraine has 
claimed the lives of over 14,000 Ukrain-
ians and displaced millions more. 
Russia has a deeply troubling history 
of using energy coercion to undermine 
democratic institutions. Thankfully, 
Congress has now passed legislation 
twice on an overwhelmingly bipartisan 
basis to put mandatory sanctions on 
Nord Stream 2. 
I am so thankful for President 
Biden’s commitment to liberty in 
Ukraine and his opposition to Nord 
Stream 2. I am also encouraged by Sec-
retary Blinken’s recent statement re-
affirming the administration’s com-
mitment to comply with the sanctions 
legislation. 
Our caucus, on a bipartisan basis, 
stands ready to work with the adminis-
tration to apply further sanctions to 
halt the pipeline. The State Depart-
ment must make clear that Congress 
will not support a side deal that puts 
the security of Ukraine and the region 
at risk.

CONGRATULATIONS TO JOE 
NOVOTNY ON HIS RETIREMENT 
(Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. 
Speaker, today I rise to recognize the 
retirement of a true servant of the 
House, Joe Novotny. 
A familiar voice that we all know so 
well, Joe served Congress for 29 years 
at both the committee and the institu-
tional level, becoming a recognizable 
and reliable part of the House legisla-
tive process as the Reading Clerk.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1572 
March 18, 2021 
Joe’s career started as a House Page 
and led him to positions on the Com-
mittee on Natural Resources and the 
Committee on Education and Labor. In 
2010, Joe joined the Clerk’s organiza-
tion as Reading Clerk, where this 
Chamber has enjoyed his voice and dili-
gence for over a decade. 
When asking the many teams who 
work with him how they would de-
scribe Joe, the word that came up re-
peatedly was ‘‘teammate.’’ As a dedi-
cated public servant with nearly three 
decades of experience and knowledge, 
Joe’s attention to detail, mentorship, 
humor, and kindness made him an 
asset and a friend to every team he has 
been a part of. From his restaurant 
recommendations to stories about see-
ing his favorite bands play live on 
weekends, Joe will not only be missed 
by his colleagues in Legislative Oper-
ations, but by all of us who know him 
as part of this Chamber. 
I would like to wish Joe well in his 
retirement and celebrate his commit-
ment to serving this body so ably for so 
many years. Congratulations, Joe.

HATE CRIMES IN AMERICA 
(Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
was in the United States Congress 
when the first hate crimes legislation 
was written. It was written after the 
heinous killing of James Byrd in 
Texas, where a Black man was dragged 
through the streets of Texas and de-
capitated. 
Tomorrow, 
the 
President 
of 
the 
United States will go to Georgia, where 
eight people were killed, six of whom 
happen to be Asian women. Yet a cap-
tain in the Cherokee Sheriff’s Depart-
ment said that the perpetrator had a 
bad day. 
Mr. Speaker, wrapped in racism, 
white supremacy, and hatred, the Geor-
gia law says that if you kill women, it 
may be a gender hatred crime. I want a 
full investigation. I believe in the Con-
stitution due process, but this is a hate 
crime. People are dead, Asian women 
are dead, and this perpetrator should 
be held accountable. 
If you are in law enforcement, the 
best role that you have is as a fact 
finder and someone who can offer sym-
pathy that makes sense, not that the 
perpetrator had a bad day and this is 
what he did. I am having a bad day be-
cause we still have hatred in this coun-
try. 
f 
SUPPER FROM A LAB IS NOT A 
SOLUTION 
(Mr. FORTENBERRY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, 
Nebraska is famous for its high-quality 
beef; and what wine is to France, beef 
is to Nebraska. 
Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, a num-
ber of us took note when Microsoft 
founder Bill Gates proposed that the 
wealthiest nations move to a hundred 
percent 
synthetic 
beef—synthetic 
beef—to fight climate change. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I have been in 
meetings with Bill Gates, and I respect 
his intellect and his desire for social 
responsibility by the world’s wealthi-
est, and I have no beef with Bill for his 
desire to see us transition to a much 
more sustainable economy, and I agree. 
But making supper from a lab? That is 
not a solution. That is a chemistry ex-
periment. 
Mr. Speaker, America makes food, 
real food, and we shouldn’t disrupt a 
nutritional food source and manage-
ment of our animal resources that 
would have minimal effect on green-
house gases. 
I have an idea. I would like to invite 
Mr. Gates to the West Point Livestock 
Auction, and he can present his pro-
posal for lab-based meat to the farmers 
and ranchers there. We would have a 
healthy debate.

OUR DIVERSITY MAKES US 
STRONG 
(Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of 
New York asked and was given permis-
sion to address the House for 1 minute 
and to revise and extend her remarks.) 
Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New 
York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in sup-
port of the millions of Dreamers who 
call America home and contribute to 
the rich tapestry of our country, yet 
have seen their dreams of a permanent 
home deferred over and over again. 
These Americans, in every way but 
on paper, deal with uncertainty each 
day that we fail to act. Now that the 
House has acted, the Senate must im-
mediately pass the American Dream 
and Promise Act. 
In our melting pot of a city, New 
Yorkers have shown again and again 
that it is our diversity that makes us 
strong and that immigrants and the 
American Dream are linked. 
So, today, the House made clear that 
immigrants are welcome here and that 
Dreamers deserve to know their home 
will not be taken away. I thank all of 
my colleagues who voted ‘‘yes’’ to pro-
viding this commonsense pathway to 
citizenship, and I urge the Senate to do 
the same. 
f 
CHILD ABUSE LEGISLATION 
NEEDS TO BE FIXED 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, earlier 
this week, the House voted on H.R. 485, 
Stronger CAPTA, a reauthorization of 
the Child Abuse Protection and Treat-
ment Act. 
Abuse is obviously a horrible thing 
that no child should have to suffer. 
However, this legislation has multiple 
issues which I call on the Senate to fix. 
Notably, it would create a national 
registry of child abuse and neglect. 
Now, this sounds good, but under cur-
rent law, a person does not need to be 
convicted or even charged with a crime 
to be put on a State abuse registry, 
which leads to many parents being 
added due to misfiled paperwork or 
perhaps overzealous CPS workers. 
Homeschooling parents in particular 
face this issue, and an appeal can take 
months or even years to get a name re-
moved from the list. By nationalizing 
State registries, this problem will 
spread nationwide without a fix. 
The legislation attempts to address 
this concern by creating a working 
group to study and make recommenda-
tions on due process concerns, but that 
is not a sufficient safeguard for Ameri-
cans’ due process rights. 
A 2009 HHS report on the feasibility 
of a national child abuse registry noted 
that a national registry would be 
plagued by false positives, where an in-
nocent person sharing a name with an 
abuser would be flagged in background 
searches. 
I call on the Senate to fix this legis-
lation.

OBSERVING SLEEP AWARENESS 
WEEK 
(Ms. DEAN asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. DEAN. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise 
to speak about Sleep Awareness Week, 
a week to remind us all of the impor-
tance of something we all need—a good 
night’s sleep. 
Sleep Awareness Week and World 
Sleep Day are internationally recog-
nized and bring awareness to sleep and 
its important impact on our health. 
The pandemic has taken a toll on all 
of us, including our sleep schedules. In-
creased anxiety and worries have made 
it harder than ever to get consistent 
and peaceful sleep. 
Despite this fact, it is important we 
consider the instrumental role sleep 
plays in keeping our bodies and minds 
healthy. 
A proper comprehensive view of good 
health must include the importance of 
rest. We all could use it. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues to ensure all American fam-
ilies, including 165,000 people in our 
country impacted by narcolepsy, have 
access to the healthcare they need. 
Sleep, wellness, and health must go 
hand in hand.

HONORING GARY CLARK 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1573 
March 18, 2021 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a longtime 
friend and the biggest advocate for vet-
erans in central Florida, retired Air 
Force Colonel Gary Clark. 
I have known Colonel Clark for 20 
years as a fellow veteran and veteran’s 
advocate. I am honored to recognize 
him as one of the distinguished 2020 in-
ductees into the Florida Veterans’ Hall 
of Fame. This is an honor truly befit-
ting Gary, thanks to his countless con-
tributions to Florida’s veterans. 
Florida is known as the most vet-
eran-friendly State in America, with 
over a million vets calling the Sun-
shine State home. Anywhere you go in 
central Florida, if there is a veteran in 
need, you can bet that Gary is on it. 
Retiring from the Air Force in 1993, 
Gary continued his service and quickly 
became a distinguished advocate for 
veterans. Gary established the Polk 
County Veterans Council, developed a 
partnership for the Polk County School 
Board to support 13 Junior ROTC units, 
and chairs the Flight to Honor Polk, 
which brings senior veterans to the me-
morials near Washington. 
Gary coordinates an annual Veterans 
Day breakfast with the Rotary Clubs of 
Lakeland and has chaired the 15th Con-
gressional District of Florida’s Service 
Academy Nominating Committee for 
at least a decade, and he remains the 
chair for my current board. 
Mr. Speaker, it is simply impossible 
to think of veterans in central Florida 
without thinking of Gary Clark. On be-
half of Polk County and the 15th Dis-
trict of Florida, we congratulate him 
on this honor and his induction into 
the Florida Veterans’ Hall of Fame, 
and we thank him for his selfless serv-
ice to our veteran community. 
SUPPORTING PUBLIC ACCESS TO CAPITOL 
Mr. C. SCOTT FRANKLIN of Florida. 
Mr. Speaker, on a more somber note, I 
rise in support of public access to this 
House, the people’s House. 
While I have only been a Member 
since January 3, as a former Naval avi-
ator who had the privilege to travel to 
over 40 countries, I know the impor-
tance of our free and open democracy 
in both the figurative and the literal 
sense. 
I was on the House floor on January 
6 when violence erupted. As we con-
tinue to investigate the tragedy that 
resulted, the military fortress erected 
in response is a gross overcorrection. 
Capitol Police have indicated there is 
no credible threat justifying maintain-
ing this security posture. On March 4, 
facing nonspecific rumors of a poten-
tial threat, the House rushed to con-
clude its work the night before and did 
not meet. Not only was the threat un-
founded, but the Senate, operating 
under the same security protocols as 
the House, was open and conducting 
the people’s business, the same Senate 
that is only a few yards down the hall 
behind us. 
Speaking of the differences between 
the two Chambers, doesn’t it seem odd 
that the same House impeachment 
managers who testified before the Sen-
ate without masks would insist that I 
be fined if I take my mask off right 
now, even though I have been vac-
cinated and there is no one around me? 
In addition to dismantling this for-
tress, we should begin relaxing the pro-
tocols put in place a year ago to limit 
the spread of COVID. Today, all House 
Members have been offered the vaccine, 
and roughly 75 percent have been vac-
cinated. Many of the remaining 25 per-
cent have antibodies from being in-
fected previously. 
There is no justification for this 
House to continue operating in a quasi- 
virtual state. The CDC has issued new 
guidelines easing masks and social 
distancing for the nearly 32 million 
people who are fully vaccinated. 
It is time to end the proxy voting, 
begin in-person committee meetings, 
and return to regular order. Our 
strength as an institution relies on per-
sonal relationships and the ability to 
build alliances where we find common 
interests. As a freshman, I have yet to 
meet most of my colleagues. We should 
be working to find common ground, 
and that is simply not possible in a vir-
tual meeting. 
Mr. Speaker, as the new administra-
tion acts to tear down the wall at our 
southern border, we have a new one 
right here, paralyzing the seat of de-
mocracy. The hypocrisy is obvious, and 
it is shameful. 
This is no longer about safety. It is 
about making every effort to create 
disruption and hide what is really 
going on from the American people. 
It is time to take down the razor wire 
fencing, send the troops home, and 
open the people’s House to the public. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

ADDRESSING THE BORDER CRISIS 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under 
the Speaker’s announced policy of Jan-
uary 4, 2021, the Chair recognizes the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. CLOUD) for 
38 minutes as the designee of the mi-
nority leader. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to address the Biden border cri-
sis, the unraveling of what was once a 
managed situation. 
We are a compassionate Nation, but 
lawlessness is not compassion. Aiding 
and abetting cartels is not compassion. 
Putting policies in place that allow 
evil actors to abuse women on a jour-
ney is not compassion. Allowing them 
to grow and be funded into a desta-
bilizing force in Central and South 
American nations that are trying to 
thrive and survive and create an econ-
omy for their own people, that is not 
compassion. 
The policies that the Biden adminis-
tration has put in place have caused 
this crisis at the border. It is different 
from the previous administration that 
came in, inherited a problem and had 
to put policies in place and make dif-
ficult decisions to come up with a solu-
tion. This administration inherited a 
solution and has put in place policies 
that have created a problem. 
It was predictable. It was easy to 
avoid. It is unfortunate that we have to 
be here again to talk about this today, 
but we are here because the lives of 
those affected matter. They deserve it. 
They need their story to be told. 
It is ironic that we are taking people 
off the border right now, our good men 
and women who signed up to protect 
and secure our border, to defend the 
Constitution, and to protect our com-
munities. We are actually taking them 
off the border to sit at computers to do 
paperwork to process what has become 
a migrant humanitarian crisis. 
We have essentially turned our brave 
men and women into the last mile, so 
to speak, for cartel activity. The busi-
ness model that the cartels have to 
work throughout the world to bring 
people to our border, to charge them 
thousands of dollars each while they 
abuse them on the journey, while they 
put them into indentured servitude and 
then hand them over to our people sim-
ply for processing. That is not what 
they signed up to do. 
The migrants deserve better as well, 
as do, certainly, our communities. We 
understand the strategy of the cartels 
to overwhelm our border and our re-
sources with the humanitarian crisis 
and then sneak in drugs that destroy 
the lives of our young people and our 
families. 
We have to fix this. We can secure 
our border. We can protect the lives of 
these people, and we can keep this Na-
tion strong. We can help push back the 
cartel influence in our Nation and 
throughout Central and South Amer-
ica. 
I have a couple of fellow Members of 
Congress and friends here who have 
valuable experience. I thank them for 
joining me today to help us with this 
conversation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tleman from South Carolina (Mr. NOR-
MAN). 
Mr. NORMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Congressman CLOUD for organizing this 
Special Order on this topic that the 
country is dealing with today. 
The Trump administration estab-
lished strong laws against illegal im-
migration. President Biden has decided 
to disregard any success achieved by 
his 
predecessor 
and, 
instead, 
an-
nounced open borders to the world. 
This problem was not created due to 
conditions abroad but by decisions 
made at home, and they were political 
decisions, unfortunately. 
Since President Biden was elected, il-
legal 
border 
crossings 
have 
sky-
rocketed. In February 2020, the CBP 
announced that over 35,000 migrants 
tried to cross the border illegally. To 
put this in context, this past February, 
that number far surpassed 100,000. 
Despite having the statistics to prove 
it, President Biden refuses to call this 
situation a crisis, which it is. 
Aside from halting construction on 
the border wall as performed by Presi-
dent Trump, the Biden administration

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1574 
March 18, 2021 
has reimplemented a system of catch 
and release and implemented selective 
enforcement of our immigration laws. 
They have suspended the removal of 
most people with active deportation or-
ders and even released COVID-positive 
detainees into our country. Really? If 
you go out of the country as an Amer-
ican and come in, you have to be test-
ed. This administration has no policies 
in place to test or provide masks and 
definitely not to know what is coming 
into the country for other viruses. 
The problems we are experiencing are 
more than politically motivated. They 
are counterproductive and put the safe-
ty of the American people in jeopardy. 
Our social systems and border officials 
don’t have the capacity or the re-
sources to handle an overwhelming 
surge in illegal border crossings. 
Let me be clear, our immigration 
system needs judicial review and legis-
lative reform. Americans want a secure 
southern 
border. 
Disregarding 
any 
form of success on our border is not the 
answer that we need. 
As I said before, legal immigration 
has countless benefits to this great Na-
tion. We have a right and a responsi-
bility to know who and what comes 
into our great country. 
Mr. CLOUD. I yield to the gentle-
woman from Illinois (Mrs. MILLER). 
Mrs. MILLER of Illinois. Mr. Speak-
er, I thank my colleague, Congressman 
CLOUD, for this very important Special 
Order. The House of hypocrites may be 
a more fitting name than this House of 
Representatives. 
The Democrats have facilitated the 
building of a 10-foot-tall wall or fence 
with razor wire around the people’s 
House, our national Capitol Building, 
and surround themselves with police 
and National Guard. Yet, the same peo-
ple refuse to protect our Nation’s bor-
der and the continued construction of 
our border wall. 
Last week, the Democrats passed two 
bills that diminish our Second Amend-
ment rights. The Democrats are the 
people who have told you we don’t need 
guns and walls, yet they have sur-
rounded themselves with guns and 
walls for months. 
There are real dangers posed by al-
lowing this massive illegal immigra-
tion invasion. We don’t know who the 
people are that are coming or what 
their intentions are. We do know that 
a lot of them are bringing in drugs, 
women and children to be trafficked, 
COVID and other diseases, and weap-
ons. 
I call on President Biden and the 
Democrats to stop obstructing the en-
forcement of our immigration laws and 
facilitating this invasion on our south-
ern border. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the good gentleman from Florida (Mr. 
POSEY). 
Mr. POSEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
good Congressman from Texas (Mr. 
CLOUD) for leading this important dis-
cussion. 
When I visited the border, I saw the 
dangers of open borders, not only for 
Americans, but for thousands of illegal 
immigrants smuggled across the bor-
der. 
Open borders empower drug cartels. 
Cartels are ruthless and inhumane in 
their treatment of their human cargo. 
President Trump secured agreements 
with El Salvador, Honduras, and Gua-
temala that curbed the flow of illegal 
immigrant 
caravans. 
Those 
agree-
ments, along with the Remain in Mex-
ico agreement, deprived the cartels of 
billions and billions of dollars and 
saved hundreds of thousands of immi-
grants from sexual abuse and exploi-
tation at the hands of the ruthless drug 
cartels. 
Sadly, 
on 
January 
20, 
President 
Biden gave the ruthless cartels a green 
light to resume their exploitation of 
women, children, and young men when 
he signed executive orders effectively 
repealing those agreements, which had 
curbed illegal immigration and were 
defunding the cartels. 
Now, the record-low crossings of im-
migrants and drugs have been replaced 
by record highs. Customs and Border 
Protection agents are overwhelmed and 
have resorted to catch and release, 
which rewards the cartels, further en-
riching those guys. 
b 2100 
Rather than abandoning border secu-
rity, the Biden-Harris administration 
must abandon the failed policies that 
created the crisis. 
Restoring our border is essential to 
putting the safety and security of 
Americans first, to protect immigrants 
from exploitation and harm, and to de-
prive the drug cartels of victims and 
revenue. 
The worst is still to come if this ad-
ministration continues down this reck-
less road. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. POSEY for his comments. It is in-
teresting of him to point out the 
former ‘‘Remain in Mexico’’ policy that 
was removed under this administra-
tion. Ironically, if you are a U.S. cit-
izen going to Mexico, you will have to 
remain in Mexico and not be allowed 
into our very own home country unless 
you have a negative COVID test. How-
ever, this is not happening with the mi-
grants at the border currently. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tleman from Arizona (Mr. GOSAR). 
Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of rep-
resenting Yuma County, Arizona. And 
as many of you know, Yuma is the epi-
center of the Biden-created border cri-
sis. When Mr. Biden says he is not 
going to enforce our immigration laws, 
when he says he is not going to build a 
border wall, it has dire consequences. 
We 
are 
seeing 
the 
tragic 
con-
sequences of that right now in Yuma. 
Mr. Biden’s decision last month to re-
lease 
illegal 
immigrants 
in 
Yuma 
County on a daily basis has opened up 
a spigot of border crossings into my 
great State of Arizona. 
Now my worst fears are coming 
through: Illegal aliens are flooding into 
Yuma. We have now ceded operational 
control of the border to the cartels. 
In less than 2 months, the Biden ad-
ministration has destroyed much of 
President Trump’s progress in securing 
the southern border. The Biden admin-
istration’s open border policy, coupled 
with NANCY
PELOSI’s amnesty bills 
taken up this week—this very day in 
Congress will only exacerbate the 
growing humanitarian health and secu-
rity crisis along the southern border. 
It is shocking to me that the House 
Democrats’ answer to the Biden-cre-
ated border crisis is to take up legisla-
tion that would give amnesty, plus a 
path to citizenship, to more than 5 mil-
lion illegal aliens. This is like pouring 
gasoline on a wildfire. 
We should be enforcing the immigra-
tion laws we have on the books. We 
should not be giving amnesty to mil-
lions of illegal aliens. Mr. Biden should 
never have halted final construction of 
the border wall. Unfortunately, Demo-
crat’s hatred for President Trump 
clouds their ability to work together 
towards commonsense reforms. 
Instead, Democrats rammed their 
radical amnesty legislation through 
Congress, even with confirmed reports 
that suspects on the terrorist watch 
list have attempted to enter into our 
country. 
What is happening in Yuma and all 
along the southern border is uncon-
scionable. The crisis is only getting 
worse. Unfortunately, today’s action 
on the House floor sends exactly the 
wrong message. We should not be 
incentivizing more illegal immigrants 
to unlawfully enter our country. In-
stead, we must condemn these at-
tempts, enforce the laws on the books, 
and take all necessary steps to get our 
border under control. 
God help us all if these two bills be-
come law. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mr. GOSAR for his remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tleman 
from 
Montana 
(Mr. 
ROSENDALE). 
Mr. ROSENDALE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in opposition to the open border 
policies of the Biden administration, 
which have created the worst border 
crisis in recent memory. 
After the surge in 2019, the Trump ad-
ministration built the wall system to 
secure our border, ended ‘‘catch and re-
lease,’’ and, most importantly, actu-
ally enforced our Nations’ laws, mak-
ing it harder and less desirable to come 
to 
our 
country 
illegally. 
And 
it 
worked. Illegal border crossings fell to 
record lows. 
Unfortunately, on his first day in of-
fice, in an act of spiteful partisanship, 
President Biden undid all of that with 
the stroke of a pen. The results are 
clear and disturbing. February border 
apprehensions were tripled what they 
were last year under President Trump, 
with a number of accompanied children 
in custody already shattering a record.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H1575 
March 18, 2021 
This truly is a humanitarian crisis of 
our time. On the treacherous trip to 
our country, illegal aliens are subject 
to abuse, rape, gang violence, and 
harsh weather and terrain. Once they 
arrive, often they are forced into sex 
slavery or indentured servitude to pay 
off their debts to coyotes or the cartel. 
Open borders and amnesty are not com-
passionate. They are heartless. The 
level of human suffering taking place 
on the border due to President Biden’s 
policies is truly tragic. The result of 
these policies was completely predict-
able. 
When I visited the border just over a 
month ago, agents told me troubling 
stories of illegal aliens, specifically cit-
ing 
President 
Biden’s 
immigration 
policies as the reason they decided to 
come to America. And this week, 
House 
Democrats 
passed 
amnesty 
measures that will only make the situ-
ation worse. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge President Biden 
and House Democrats to reconsider, set 
aside partisanship, and work with us to 
secure our border, enforce our laws, 
and address the humanitarian crisis at 
the border before it is too late. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I yield to 
the good gentleman from Arizona (Mr. 
BIGGS). 
Mr. BIGGS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman, Mr. CLOUD, for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, earlier today, Demo-
crats ignored President Biden’s inhu-
mane border crisis and passed two am-
nesty bills. The bills actually encour-
age illegal immigration. 
Here is the way it works: The cartels 
have operational control of our border. 
They do. No one crosses the southern 
border unless the cartel says it is okay. 
The cartels are advertising now. NGOs 
funded by this government are adver-
tising down in the Northern Triangle 
states in Mexico: ‘‘Come north.’’ 
They give brochures how to get here. 
And what happens is caravans are 
forming now. But more than that, we 
have got people lining up at the bor-
ders to come across. It is a treacherous 
journey. 
Mr. Speaker, parents are giving their 
kids to coyotes to bring forward. And 
these people have no respect for human 
life. No respect. And that is because of 
the policies of this administration. And 
I will tell you what I heard someone on 
the floor of the House state today, and 
I am going to quote it. 
They said, ‘‘This bill is not amnesty. 
It does not grant anybody amnesty. It 
allows individuals to get right with the 
law and become legal workers in the 
United States.’’ 
That is the definition of amnesty. 
Look it up in Merriam Webster. 
Earlier 
this 
week, 
Secretary 
Mayorkas admitted, ‘‘We are on pace 
to encounter more individuals on the 
southwest border than at any time in 
the last 20 years.’’ 
Let that sink in: More than any time 
in the last 20 years. 
And the answer to this by our Demo-
crat colleagues is to pass amnesty. 
Mr. Speaker, we hear moving stories 
that all Dreamers came to the United 
States as little children, graduated 
from high school as valedictorians and 
are now working as doctors saving 
lives. 
If that were true, why did these bills 
include waivers for illegal aliens who 
have been convicted of crimes? 
Why didn’t these bills include lan-
guage to require that illegal aliens who 
will get amnesty at least have grad-
uated from either high school or col-
lege? 
The contents of the bills the House 
passed today do not match the rhetoric 
of the open borders crowd. We can 
spend hours talking about the heartfelt 
stories, what happened to people, kids 
who I have seen, who have been rented 
out and used multiple times to take ad-
vantage of these policies. Time doesn’t 
allow for me to do that, but we must 
continue to fight this horrible scourge 
because it is a humanitarian crisis. 
Don’t paper over it claiming that you 
are compassionate when you are entic-
ing people to put their lives in the 
hands of people who don’t give any con-
sideration for human life. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
gentleman for his remarks. 
Indeed, it is true that these cartels 
have a weird, perverted thinking when 
it comes to people. For them, they are 
just a business product. In their mind, 
they can sell a kilo of coke once, but 
they can get residual income from a 
human life. 
It is pathetic, disturbing, troubling, 
to say the least, that we, by our poli-
cies, empower this kind of activity on 
our southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tlewoman 
from 
Colorado 
(Mrs. 
BOEBERT). 
Mrs. BOEBERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Texas, my good 
friend, Congressman MICHAEL CLOUD, 
for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, the Biden regime has 
focused all its time and energy on ben-
efiting those who have done it all 
wrong. Fascist governors imposed dra-
conian lockdowns and sent their States 
into 
economic 
disaster. 
So 
Biden 
passed the blue State bailout. 
Did you commit a felony? This ad-
ministration wants you to vote. 
And now this administration wants 
to give special privileges to those 
breaking Federal law and crossing the 
southern border. 
Mr. Speaker, it is past time that we 
fix the broken immigration system and 
secure the border. That is my hard 
line. That means building the wall, 
properly funding Border Patrol, and en-
forcing the laws we have on the 
books—exactly what President Trump 
did, which led to record low illegal 
crossings. This is the right and humane 
thing to do. 
Getting children out of the hands of 
cartels and coyotes, and making it 
clear that the American government 
will put those coming the right way, 
the legal way, they will be rewarded. 
But, no, this administration has be-
come a marketing wing for the cartels, 
urging folks from all around the world 
to flood our southern border. 
These cartels are making billions of 
dollars on human smuggling alone, and 
billions more on drug trafficking. The 
result of Biden’s collaboration with 
cartels is the highest number of unac-
companied minors we have ever seen. 
Thousands of criminals, and even indi-
viduals on the FBI’s terrorist watch 
list, crossing our border. 
Mr. Speaker, this administration is 
incentivizing unaccompanied minors to 
make the hazardous and potentially 
fatal journey across our southern bor-
der. That is child abuse. This adminis-
tration has signaled that we will not 
fortify our southern border, and we 
have seen those on the terrorist watch 
list try to enter. That is a dereliction 
of duty. And we have seen this admin-
istration fail to uphold and enforce the 
laws of our Nation. That is a betrayal 
of the American people. 
The most moral thing we can do is 
build a wall and secure our southern 
border. It is shameful and immoral to 
signal to poor and desperate people 
that if you break our laws, if you cross 
our borders, if you somehow make it, if 
you somehow don’t get caught and sur-
vive, then we will take care of you with 
our hard-earned tax dollars. Let’s ask 
California how that is working for 
them. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Mrs. BOEBERT for her remarks. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield to the good gen-
tleman from Georgia (Mr. CLYDE). 
Mr. CLYDE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to-
night to shine a light on the current 
crisis that is plaguing our southwest 
border. Customs and Border Protection 
agents has stated that they are en-
countering more than 3,000 illegal im-
migrants per day. It has also been re-
ported that Customs and Border Patrol 
encountered the highest number of ille-
gal aliens recorded in the month of 
February in over 7 years, at 100,441 en-
counters. 
The Biden executive order termi-
nating the construction of the wall 
caused this crisis, and the COVID–19 
pandemic has made it worse. The Biden 
border crisis stands to threaten not 
only 
U.S. 
communities 
along 
the 
southern border, but also Americans 
throughout the interior. And as a re-
sult of the Federal Government’s inac-
tion, local border communities are 
stepping up to fill the void. 
But, unfortunately, these localities 
do not have the authority to retain 
these illegals who plan to travel to doz-
ens of cities throughout the country. 
We must do everything in our power to 
protect Americans from unnecessary 
exposure to the coronavirus. 
It seriously troubles me that the Sec-
retary of Homeland Security acknowl-
edged just yesterday in a committee 
hearing that the Department not only 
does not know how many illegal immi-
grants have been released, but they are 
also not testing all of them for COVID–

19 before releasing them. Let that sink 
in. 
The Department charged with pro-
tecting the homeland lacks an execut-
able strategy to ensure that all illegal 
immigrants are properly screened and 
tested before they are released into the 
interior. 
In order to right this wrong and 
stand up for the safety of all Ameri-
cans, I will be introducing the COVID– 
19 Border Protection Act, a bill that re-
purposes COVID relief funds, funds 
from Democrats’ nearly $2 trillion 
package slated to be sent overseas, to 
test immigrants who are encountered 
by Federal officials at the border and 
quarantine those who test positive. I 
took an oath to protect all Americans, 
and this bill does just that. 
The crisis at the border is unaccept-
able and it exemplifies the threat posed 
by the rollback of Trump-era policies 
that were tough on illegal immigra-
tion. 
b 2115 
Illegal immigrants should not be al-
lowed to enter our country to begin 
with, and a wall would help do just 
that. But they should certainly not be 
allowed 
to 
enter 
and 
spread 
the 
COVID–19 virus. All Americans should 
be appalled with the crisis at the bor-
der. 
I call on my colleagues to join me in 
rejecting the administration’s America 
second policies and get tough on illegal 
immigration. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, we are in-
deed a compassionate Nation, we recog-
nize that everyone on this planet are 
people created in the image of God. We 
understand that people are hurting all 
over the world. 
The solution for that, however, is for 
us to be that shining city on the hill, 
for us to be an example to the world. 
For them to know that if you live by 
the same principles that have made 
this Nation into one of the brightest 
beacons of freedom through all of 
human history that you can achieve 
the same results. 
We want people to prosper every-
where. We want every nation to pros-
per, and that is why we are so intent on 
stopping this terrible scourge that is at 
our southern border. These cartels are 
wreaking havoc in the lives of these 
people, and we have to put an end to 
this. 
Mr. Speaker, I include in the RECORD 
an article titled ‘‘Color-Coded Passage: 
Why Smugglers are Tagging U.S.- 
Bound Migrants with Wristbands.’’ 
It has recently come to light that a 
number of the migrants are coming 
over with wristbands. The question was 
asked, Why? 
[From Reuters, Mar. 9, 2021] 
COLOR-CODED PASSAGE: WHY SMUGGLERS ARE 
TAGGING
U.S.-BOUND
MIGRANTS
WITH 
WRISTBANDS 
(By Adrees Latif, Laura Gottesdiener, Mica 
Rosenberg) 
PENITAS, TX.—Along the banks of the Rio 
Grande 
in 
the 
scrubby 
grassland 
near 
Penitas, Texas, hundreds of colored plastic 
wristbands ripped off by migrants litter the 
ground, signs of what U.S. border officials 
say is a growing trend among powerful drug 
cartels and smugglers to track people paying 
to cross illegally into the United States. 
The 
plastic 
bands—red, 
blue, 
green, 
white—some labeled arrivals or entries in 
Spanish, are discarded after migrants cross 
the river on makeshift rafts, according to a 
Reuters witness. Their use has not been 
widely reported before. 
Some migrants are trying to evade border 
agents, others are mostly Central American 
families or young children traveling without 
parents who turn themselves into officials, 
often to seek asylum. 
Border Patrol agents in the Rio Grande 
Valley sector, which spans more than 34,000 
square miles (88,000 square kilometers) along 
the border in southeast Texas, have recently 
encountered immigrants wearing the brace-
lets during several apprehensions, said Mat-
thew Dyman a spokesman for U.S. Customs 
and Border Protection. 
The ‘‘information on the bracelets rep-
resents a multitude of data that is used by 
smuggling organizations, such as payment 
status or affiliation with smuggling groups,’’ 
Dyman told Reuters. 
The differing smuggling techniques come 
as Democratic President Joe Biden’s admin-
istration has sought to reverse restrictive 
immigration polices set up by his prede-
cessor, former President Donald Trump. But 
a recent jump in border crossings has Repub-
licans warning the easing of hardline policies 
will lead to an immigration crisis. 
U.S. border agents carried out nearly 
100,000 apprehensions or rapid expulsions of 
migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border in Feb-
ruary, according to two people familiar with 
preliminary figures, the highest monthly 
total since mid–2019. 
PURPLE BRACELET 
‘‘They run it like a business,’’ said Car-
dinal Brown, which means ‘‘finding more pa-
trons and looking for efficiencies.’’ Migrants 
can pay thousands of dollars for the journey 
to the United States and human smugglers 
have to pay off drug cartels to move people 
through parts of Mexico. 
‘‘This is a money-making operation and 
they have to pay close attention to who has 
paid,’’ she said. ‘‘This may be a new way to 
keep track.’’ 
Criminal groups operating in northern 
Mexico, however, have long used systems to 
log which migrants have already paid for the 
right to be in gang-controlled territory, as 
well as for the right to cross the border into 
the United States, migration experts said. 
A migrant in Reynosa—one of the most 
dangerous cities in Mexico across the border 
from McAllen, Texas—who declined to give 
his name for fear of retaliation, showed Reu-
ters a picture of a purple wristband he was 
wearing. 
He said he paid $500 to one of the criminal 
groups in the city after he arrived a few 
months ago from Honduras to secure the 
purple bracelet to protect against kidnap-
ping or extortion. He said once migrants or 
their smugglers have paid for the right to 
cross the river, which is also controlled by 
criminal groups, they receive another brace-
let. 
‘‘This way we’re not in danger, neither us 
nor the ‘coyote,’ ’’ he said, using the Spanish 
word for smuggler. 
One human smuggler who spoke on condi-
tions of anonymity, confirmed the bracelets 
were a system to designate who has paid for 
the right to transit through cartel territory. 
‘‘They are putting these (bracelets) on so 
there aren’t killings by mistake,’’ he said. 
Migrants and smugglers say the use of 
bracelets to designate who has paid for the 
right to cross the river is a system required 
by the cartels that control waterfront terri-
tory 
in 
the 
conflict-ridden 
state 
of 
Tamaulipas. 
In January, a group of migrants were mas-
sacred in Tamaulipas state just 40 miles (70 
km) west of Reynosa. Twelve local Mexican 
police have been arrested in connection with 
the massacre. 
Mr. CLOUD. Mr. Speaker, a migrant 
in Reynosa said this: ‘‘He paid one of 
the criminal groups in the city after he 
arrived a few months ago from Hon-
duras to secure the purple bracelet to 
protect against kidnapping and extor-
tion.’’ 
‘‘He said once migrants or their 
smugglers have paid for the right to 
cross the river, which is also controlled 
by criminal groups, they receive an-
other bracelet.’’ 
So 
basically, 
cartels 
are 
going 
throughout, they are recruiting people 
to come, charging them thousands of 
dollars. At each step along the way 
they have to pay another fee to get 
across the territory that is controlled 
by cartels. 
One human smuggler who spoke up, 
of course, on the condition of anonym-
ity, confirmed that the bracelets were 
a system to designate who was paid for 
the right to transit through cartel ter-
ritory. And this is what he said: ‘‘They 
are putting these bracelets on so there 
aren’t killings by mistake.’’ 
This is what we are allowing, and it 
is tragic. We can do better than this. 
We can mitigate the influence that 
the cartels are having at our border, 
and 
communities 
throughout 
my 
State, in particular, in Texas, and 
throughout our Nation. We can miti-
gate this humanitarian and this na-
tional security crisis, and I encourage 
the White House to do so, and for this 
House to take up legislation to secure 
our border as well. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time.

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

f 
GEORGIA SHOOTINGS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, the 
Asian-American community is still 
reeling from the senseless murder of 
eight people near Atlanta, six of whom 
were women of Asian descent. It will be 
some time before we understand what 
drove the madman who perpetrated 
this crime, but there is no doubt that 
abuse, prejudice, and violence against 
Asian Americans is on the rise, and it 
is so un-American and so despicable 
that we all must be speaking out about 
this. 
The same day that six Asian women 
were killed in Georgia, the Stop AAPI 
Hate organization released a report 
naming 3,800 incidents of hate against 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, 
and that is just in 1 year alone. 
The fear in the Asian-American com-
munity and the threat of violence 
against its members should be a topic 
of national conversation. 
In the last 4 years—you know, we all 
know there have been forces of racism, 
dark forces, that have been often seen 
in America, but the last 4 years, where 
Donald Trump, at the very minimum, 
refused to condemn the bigotry in the 
instances when he should, have allowed 
them to come far more up to the sur-
face. It is as if the society’s superego 
that keeps these dark forces down has 
been greatly diminished or even re-
moved. 
It is up to us, particularly under the 
new President, who fights bigotry at 
every step of the way—but it is up to 
all of us to speak out against it and to 
act against it. 
The story of the Asian-American 
community 
is 
quintessentially 
an 
American story, and we cannot allow 
the rising tide of bigotry against them, 
the intolerance against them, the prej-
udice against them to go unchecked be-
cause in a multicultural society like 
ours, an attack on any one group is an 
attack on everyone. 
I love the Asian-American commu-
nity. They are such fine, good Amer-
ican people. The story of the Asian- 
American 
community 
is 
quintessentially an American story. It 
is a story of coming here, building 
strong 
communities, 
opening 
local 
businesses, churches, civic organiza-
tions, and slowly but surely gaining 
the political representation they so de-
serve.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1624 
March 18, 2021 
Just yesterday, we confirmed a nomi-
nee whose parents emigrated from Tai-
wan to become the U.S. Trade Rep-
resentative. That is notable and impor-
tant progress. But, unfortunately, the 
past few years have shown us that 
America has not excised the age-old 
demon of racism, and to too many it 
has become acceptable, permissible, or 
just shrug your shoulders. That cannot 
be. 
With respect to the Asian-American 
community specifically and all com-
munities, we must condemn rhetoric 
that is racist. In this case, we must 
condemn any rhetoric that blames the 
Chinese people for the coronavirus. 
President Trump did that, despicably, 
and that notion was too often encour-
aged by others who repeated his harsh, 
nasty, and bigoted words. 
We must stand beside and stand up 
for our Asian-American brothers and 
sisters. Americans of every faith, every 
color, every gender and sexual orienta-
tion must band together against these 
dark forces of hate. As I said, they are 
always with us, but somehow after the 
4 years of the Trump Presidency, they 
are rising to the surface and seem too 
acceptable to too many people. Fight 
them, fight them, fight them we must. 
As we mourn with the people of Geor-
gia, let us recommit ourselves to that 
most American of creeds that is right 
above the mantle where you sit, Mr. 
President, ‘‘e pluribus unum.’’ Out of 
many, one. 
America: ‘‘e pluribus unum.’’ Out of 
many, one. 
f 
NOMINATIONS 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, on 
nominations, today, the Senate will 
vote to confirm another member of 
President 
Biden’s 
Cabinet, 
Xavier 
Becerra, to serve as Secretary of 
Health and Human Services. 
In truth, Attorney General Becerra’s 
nomination should not have taken this 
long. From the moment the Attorney 
General Becerra was announced as 
President Biden’s pick for HHS, Senate 
Republicans have tried to derail his 
nomination. Their arguments almost 
verge on the ridiculous. They complain 
loudly that he had no direct experience 
as a medical professional, even though 
Republicans voted in lockstep to in-
stall Alex Azar, a pharmaceutical exec-
utive, who raised drug prices and tried 
to undermine our Nation’s health law 
as the previous HHS Secretary. 
Becerra, by contrast, has decades of 
standing up for working and middle- 
class Americans in Congress, fighting 
to protect and expand Medicare and 
Medicaid and working to safeguard our 
healthcare system from attacks by the 
Trump administration. 
As the Biden administration works 
to defeat this pandemic, the President 
deserves to have his Cabinet confirmed, 
especially a post as important as HHS 
Secretary. I look forward to com-
pleting his nomination today. 
A few days after Democrats gained 
control of the Senate, we had big tasks 
ahead of us right away. I said that we 
had three important priorities to do 
quickly: One, the impeachment trial of 
Donald Trump; two, big and bold 
COVID relief; and, three, President 
Biden’s Cabinet. We have already fin-
ished the first two priorities, and very 
soon we are going to finish the third. 
I want to thank my colleagues, my 
Democratic colleagues, for working so 
quickly, so hard, and in such a unified 
team effort to allow all of this to hap-
pen. I am very proud of what we have 
done in these first few months. 
Later today, the Senate will take its 
first vote on the nomination of Boston 
Mayor Marty Walsh to be our Nation’s 
Labor Secretary. Early next week, 
after we confirm him, the Senate will 
have confirmed every available Cabinet 
Secretary and many more Cabinet- 
level appointments besides. That is ex-
cellent progress, and, again, I want to 
thank my colleagues in the Senate on 
both sides of the aisle for their votes in 
supporting these fine nominees. 
What does it mean? It means the 
Biden administration will have the per-
sonnel in place to implement the 
American Rescue Plan, finish the fight 
against COVID–19, and bring our coun-
try roaring back. In the meantime, the 
Senate must continue to work to get 
the rest of the President’s team in 
place. 
f 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OF 
2021 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, now 
on the American Rescue Plan. As 
Americans learn more and more about 
ARP, the American Rescue Plan, the 
more popular it becomes and the more 
optimistic Americans feel about our 
economic recovery. 
Across the country, the support for 
the rescue plan has risen to over 70 per-
cent. In January of this year, before 
President Biden took office and Demo-
crats assumed the majority of the Sen-
ate, more than four in five Americans 
believed America was on the wrong 
track; less than one in five said it was 
on the right track. 
Now a majority, 55 percent, believe 
the country is headed in the right di-
rection. It is back on the right track. 
That is a dramatic turn rather quickly, 
but I think it is, in part, because of the 
good work we have done here in the 
Senate. 
Now we have learned something else: 
Consumer confidence has increased 
faster after the passage of the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan than after any of the 
other stimulus bills passed by Con-
gress, particularly among low- and 
middle-income Americans, who have 
suffered the most. 
That is fantastic news. Americans at 
the top have been able to survive the 
pandemic 
much 
more 
easily 
than 
Americans at the lower end of the lad-
der. For that reason, economists have 
long feared a K-shaped recovery in 
which 
high-income 
earners 
recover 
quickly, while middle- and low-income 
earners are left behind. 
The American Rescue Plan is finally 
restoring confidence and support for 
Americans at the middle and at the 
bottom, helping drive a robust recov-
ery for everyone. 
One crucial aspect of that recovery is 
support for housing. As we all know, 
during the pandemic, tens of millions 
of Americans were out of work and 
drained family incomes. Americans 
were forced into impossible choices: Do 
I pay the rent and utilities this month 
or do I buy another few weeks of gro-
ceries? 
Sadly, more than 13 million Ameri-
cans report that they have fallen be-
hind on the rent, especially Black and 
Brown Americans. 
So when Senate Democrats put to-
gether the American Rescue Plan, we 
made one of the most significant in-
vestments in housing assistance in re-
cent history: more than $20 billion in 
emergency aid for low-income renters, 
those at the greatest risk of eviction; 
$10 billion to help homeowners behind 
on mortgages and utilities to avoid 
foreclosure. 
We include crucial support for rural 
America, homeowners struggling with 
the mortgage, and Americans, particu-
larly veterans, who have recently fall-
en into homelessness or at risk of 
homelessness. 
The American Rescue Plan goes fur-
ther in delivering housing assistance to 
Tribal Nations and Native Hawaiians, 
more than any other housing bill in 
history. 
The American Rescue Plan, quite lit-
erally, will keep a roof over Americans’ 
heads. It is just one of the many ways 
the ARP delivers relief to struggling 
Americans and sets the stage for a su-
percharged economic recovery. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The

The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded.

BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Yesterday, Sec-
retary Mayorkas testified the ‘‘border 
is secure and the border is not open.’’ 
Yet the situation on our southern 
border has required FEMA, the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, to be 
called in. So either this is the first 
time FEMA has been deployed just to 
admire 
a 
situation 
that 
is 
going 
smoothly or the administration is not 
being straight with the American peo-
ple.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1625 
March 18, 2021 
Here are the facts. Customs and Bor-
der Protection recorded more than 
100,000 migrant encounters in Feb-
ruary—100,000. That was up 28 percent 
from January. DHS projects the March 
totals will keep 2021 on pace for the 
most border encounters in 20 years. Un-
accompanied 
child 
arrivals 
have 
jumped 63 percent, on pace to shatter 
all-time records. 
This would be a humanitarian crisis 
under any circumstances, but it is even 
worse during a global pandemic. These 
thousands of unaccompanied kids are 
being housed in three-high bunk beds 
in facilities now stuffed at more than 
triple capacity. During the pandemic 
that is keeping kids out of schools and 
small businesses from fully reopening, 
these failing policies have us crowding 
these kids together down at the border. 
And, don’t forget, the Biden adminis-
tration policy directs CBP to release 
migrants on U.S. soil while they await 
asylum rulings. That is without—with-
out—a negative COVID test. So good 
luck to the communities on the border. 
This isn’t just a health and humani-
tarian crisis, though. It is a security 
crisis as well. New reporting suggests 
that multiple people arrested at the 
border in recent months have been 
matched to names on the FBI’s ter-
rorist watch list. 
Democrats claim this overall influx 
is not because of their new administra-
tion. Well, that would be news to the 
migrants themselves. Some of these 
people have told reporters it was 
Democrats’ rhetoric that led them to 
come. Some have shown up wearing T- 
shirts with the Biden campaign’s logo 
on them. 
Administration officials keep sending 
mixed 
messages, 
repeating 
phrases 
from the White House podium like 
‘‘now is not the time to come.’’ So 
there will be an appropriate time some-
time later for people to enter our coun-
try illegally? 
Speaking of mixed signals, this week, 
the House is voting on immigration 
bills. Are they leaping into action to 
repair the crisis? No, that is not what 
they have in mind. They are taking up 
an amnesty plan that would create a 
special new pathway to citizenship for 
illegal immigrants working in certain 
industries. 
So to summarize, the administration 
can’t admit they have caused the cri-
sis. They have yet to address the crisis. 
And House Democrats are backing poli-
cies that would only exacerbate the 
wrong incentive. 
f 
ELECTIONS 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a completely different matter, 
I remember distant days long, long 
ago, way back through the mists of 
time, when Democrats said it would be 
wrong for Washington to overturn a 
State-certified election result. 
No, wait a minute. That was 2 
months ago. Two months ago, every 
Democrat, cable news channel, and 
every liberal newspaper was melting 
down over some Republicans’ efforts to 
dispute State-certified election results 
here in Congress. I vocally opposed 
those efforts myself. 
But right now, as we speak, Speaker 
PELOSI and Washington Democrats are 
literally trying to overturn a State- 
certified election here in Congress. 
That is exactly what they are doing 
over in the House right now. 
The voters of Iowa’s Second District 
spoke in November. They counted the 
votes. They recounted the votes. The 
outcome was certified. That is the 
magic word, ‘‘certified,’’ that we heard 
over and over and over again in Novem-
ber and December. 
There was the opportunity to present 
complaints in court. Sound familiar? 
But the defeated Democrat passed up 
the opportunity to go to court. The 
process played out in a way that every 
liberal in America spent November, De-
cember, and January insisting was be-
yond question. 
Ah, but there is a catch. This time— 
this time—the Republican won, and the 
Democrat lost. So Speaker PELOSI and 
Washington Democrats have set out 
trying to overturn the result from 
right here in Congress. 
Congresswoman MILLER-MEEKS
has 
been sworn in. She is here. She is work-
ing. But Democratic leadership is try-
ing to use brute political power to kick 
her out and replace this Congress-
woman with the Democrat whom she 
defeated. 
You don’t often see hypocrisy this 
blatant and this shameless so quickly. 
Naturally, now that the Democrats 
stand to benefit from this, the concept 
of Washington overturning a certified 
election has gone from a massive out-
rage—a massive outrage—to a minor 
afterthought for much of the national 
media. 
This is happening at the same time 
that House and Senate Democrats are 
pitching a massive takeover of all 50 
States’ election laws. The same people 
who are trying to overturn this cer-
tified election result want to ram 
through a bill that would let them con-
trol the democratic processes that will 
determine whether they keep their jobs 
and their majority in 2 years’ time. 
This isn’t about principle. It is just 
an attempt to use a temporary major-
ity to pull off a permanent partisan 
power grab. 
Democratic leaders have razor-thin 
majorities in both Chambers. They are 
obviously afraid they are going to lose 
them, so they have decided their top 
priority is a Washington rewrite of 
election rules. 
The Second District in Iowa is just 
the appetizer. Soon Democrats want to 
come for the main course. Every con-
gressional district, all 50 States, every 
election for every Federal office would 
have to be run the way liberal Wash-
ington lawyers who donate to Demo-
crats prefer. 
Voter ID? Their bill bans it unless 
States implement a huge loophole that 
makes it meaningless. But ballot har-
vesting, where paid political operatives 
can hand in stacks of absentee ballots 
with other people’s names on them? It 
won’t just be allowed; it will be manda-
tory nationwide. 
Those are just two examples from an 
endless list. Outside special interests 
are putting tens of millions of dollars 
behind this. 
In fact, some Democrats are so des-
perate to rewrite the rules of our de-
mocracy that many of them want to 
break the Senate’s rules in order to do 
it. They want to break the Senate’s 
rules in order to rewrite the rules of 
our democracy all over America. Peo-
ple will argue that it is worth destroy-
ing the legislative filibuster over H.R. 1 
because the rules that govern our de-
mocracy are so important. 
Of course, that is backward. The 
rules that govern our democracy are 
indeed uniquely sensitive and impor-
tant. That is why this issue, of all 
issues, must be addressed in a fair and 
bipartisan way. 
This isn’t a uniquely justifiable place 
to shred the Senate’s rules and ram 
through something partisan. It is a 
uniquely unjustifiable place to do it. 
I worked with Chris Dodd to spear-
head the Help America Vote Act back 
in 2002, a big landmark election bill 
that made it easier to vote and harder 
to cheat. It passed the Senate 92 to 2— 
92 to 2. 
That is the kind of consensus you 
build if you want to tune up our de-
mocracy. That’s the kind of broad bi-
partisan support that exists for making 
it easier to vote but harder to cheat, a 
far cry—a far cry from overturning a 
result from the last election and dic-
tating the terms of the next one.

TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER 
HEMINGWAY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, now 
on one final matter, this week marks 
the end of Jennifer Hemingway’s serv-
ice as the Senate’s Acting Sergeant at 
Arms. I am happy and grateful that 
Jennifer is actually not going any-
where. While she is stepping aside from 
the top job, as is custom when party 
control flips, Leader SCHUMER had the 
excellent judgment to retain Jennifer 
as the Sergeant at Arms Chief of Staff. 
So, instead of a farewell, I just want 
to offer a few thanks. 
I 
cannot 
imagine 
tougher 
cir-
cumstances than those in which Jen-
nifer stepped into in this job. She had 
already impressed everyone as Deputy 
Sergeant at Arms, but when the Cap-
itol was breached on January 6, she 
leapt into action on a whole new level. 
It then fell to Jennifer to take the 
reins during challenging times. Her 
sure-handed leadership and institu-
tional knowledge helped us get through 
a safe and successful inauguration just 
2 weeks after January 6. Then came the 
fourth-ever Presidential impeachment 
trial, and there have been all the crit-
ical daily missions the Sergeant at

CONCLUSION OF MORNING

The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-

EXECUTIVE SESSION 
EXECUTIVE CALENDAR 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Under the previous order, the 
Senate will proceed to executive ses-
sion to resume consideration of the fol-
lowing nomination, which the clerk 
will report. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nomination of Xavier Becerra, 
of California, to be Secretary of Health 
and Human Services. 
Mr. MCCONNELL. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, once 
again, we are hearing chatter from 
some Democratic Senators about abol-
ishing the filibuster. I had hoped we 
would move on from such talk after 
multiple Democratic Senators pledged 
to uphold the filibuster but apparently 
not. 
Apparently, 
some 
Democrats 
think that they can pressure or bully 
those Senators and other Democratic 
Senators who have expressed reserva-
tions into going back on their word. 
Let me quote a former Senator on at-
tempts to change filibuster rules in the 
Senate, and I am quoting: 
We should make no mistake. This nuclear 
option is ultimately an example of the arro-
gance of power. It is a fundamental power 
grab by the majority party. . . . Folks who 
want to see this change want to eliminate 
one of the procedural mechanisms designed 
for the express purpose of guaranteeing indi-
vidual rights, and they also have a con-
sequence, and would undermine the protec-
tions of a minority point of view in the heat 
of majority excess. 
That was former Senator Joe Biden. 
Here is what a current Senator had 
to say on eliminating the legislative 
filibuster, and again I quote: 
I can tell you that would be the end of the 
Senate as it was originally devised and cre-
ated going back to our Founding Fathers. We 
have to acknowledge our respect for the mi-
nority, and that is what the Senate tries to 
do in its composition and in its procedure. 
That was a statement from the cur-
rent Democratic whip in 2018. 
In 
2017, 
33 
Democratic 
Senators 
signed a letter urging that the legisla-
tive filibuster be preserved—2017. 
Of course, Democrats have not lim-
ited their support of the filibuster to 
words; they have supported it by their 
actions. In the last Congress, Demo-
crats set a record for forcing cloture 
votes, which is what has to happen in 
order to end a filibuster. They repeat-
edly used the filibuster when they dis-
agreed with legislation that Repub-
licans were advancing. They filibus-
tered COVID relief. They filibustered 
police reform even though Senator 
SCOTT and Leader MCCONNELL had com-
mitted to a robust, bipartisan amend-
ment process. They filibustered pro-life 
legislation, and they made it very clear 
that they deeply regretted the fact 
that they could not filibuster judicial 
nominees—a situation, I would point 
out, of their own making. Even with-
out the judicial filibuster, they used 
every tool at their disposal to slow 
down judicial nominations. 
So, as of last year, Democrats’ ac-
tions clearly demonstrated their firm 
support of the filibuster, but now that 
they have actually taken power here in 
Washington, albeit by the slimmest 
possible majority, they are pushing to 
get rid of it. 
Democrats, of course, would like peo-
ple to believe that this is a principled 
change; that all of a sudden, they have 
realized that it is really much better 
for the country if the majority party 
gets to do whatever it wants when it is 
in charge. Well, I just have to say, if 
you believe that, I have some nice 
oceanfront property in South Dakota 
to sell you. 
I doubt that there is anyone any-
where in the country who seriously 
thinks that the Democrats’ dramatic 
180-degree turn on the filibuster is a 
principled reversal of their previous po-
sition. No, this isn’t about principle. It 
is partisanship. It is political expedi-
ency. Democrats’ principles haven’t 
changed; their power in the Senate has. 
They are in charge now. They don’t 
want anything holding them back, like 
that pesky Senate rule that they have 
used so often to their advantage. 
The truth is, Democrats want a one- 
sided advantage. Last year, they were 
perfectly happy to exercise their rights 
as a minority and filibuster any Repub-
lican legislature they didn’t like, but 
now that they are in charge, they want 
to deny the minority a right Demo-
crats repeatedly exercised when they 
were in power. They are apparently too 
shortsighted to see that their proposal 
could be turned back on them in an in-
stant. 
When Democrats abolished the fili-
buster for judicial nominees, Leader 
MCCONNELL
warned Democrats that 
they would reap the whirlwind, and 
they did. Much to Democrats’ horror, 
President Trump ended up being the 
chief beneficiary of the abolition of the 
filibuster for judicial nominees, ap-
pointing a vast number of conservative 
judges to the Federal bench. 
Several Democratic Senators have 
openly admitted that they had made a 
mistake by abolishing the judicial fili-
buster. The junior Senator from Dela-
ware came to the floor in April 2017 and 
said he regretted changing the rules in 
2013. The senior Senator from Min-
nesota not only said she regretted 
changing the rules, she went so far as 
to say in 2018 that she would support 
bringing back the 60-vote requirement. 
Yet now Democrats are apparently 
ready to abolish—abolish—the legisla-
tive filibuster. How have they not 
learned their lesson? Unless Democrats 
are so arrogant as to think they will 
never again be in the minority. 
Some Democrats have suggested that 
we need to abolish the filibuster be-
cause otherwise the Senate won’t get 
anything done. Well, not quite. Not 
quite. It is not that the filibuster could 
prevent us from getting anything done; 
it is that it could prevent us from get-
ting everything Democrats want done. 
That is a big difference. 
The truth is, Democrats could easily 
get something done in the Senate if 
they were willing to actually work 
with Republicans. And by ‘‘work with 
Republicans,’’ I don’t mean inviting 
Republicans to join their bills while ex-
cluding any meaningful Republican 
input. I don’t mean threatening Repub-
licans to support their bills on pain of 
having the filibuster abolished or sub-
stantially altered. No, I mean genu-
inely inviting Republicans to the table. 
Now, it would mean the Democrats 
wouldn’t get everything they want 
done, and, of course, Republicans cer-
tainly wouldn’t get everything we want 
done, but we could get something done. 
In fact, we could get some pretty 
meaningful things done. We could ne-
gotiate an infrastructure bill. We could 
pass section 230 reform, like the bipar-
tisan bill I introduced with Senator 
SCHATZ yesterday. We could pass police 
reform legislation, expand domestic 
manufacturing capacity, and protect 
election integrity. We could do all of 
that and more if Democrats would en-
gage in genuine bipartisan negotiation. 
Is it really too much to ask that 
Democrats find 10 Republicans to work 
with on major legislative items? Ev-
eryone would like to pass their uned-
ited agenda just like they want it, but 
that is not how things are supposed to 
work, at least not in the U.S. Senate, 
and it is certainly not how it is sup-
posed to work when, like Democrats, 
you barely have a majority. The Sen-
ate and, indeed, our whole system of 
government were designed to prevent a 
partisan majority from steamrolling 
through its unedited, unchecked agen-
da. 
Let’s just talk for a minute about the 
purpose of the Senate. Actually, let me 
take a step back and talk about the 
purpose of our whole system of govern-
ment. 
Our Founders established not a pure 
democracy, where the will of the ma-
jority reigns unchecked, but a demo-
cratic Republic. It was their intention

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1627 
March 18, 2021 
to combine majority rule with rep-
resentation and protection for the mi-
nority. Why? Because the Founders 
knew very well that it wasn’t just 
Kings who could be tyrants. They knew 
that majorities could be tyrants, too, 
and that a majority of citizens could 
easily trample the rights of the minor-
ity. So they put safeguards in place 
throughout our government, checks 
and balances to keep the government 
in check and ensure that minority as 
well as majority rights were protected. 
One of those safeguards was the U.S. 
Senate. Wary of, to quote Federalist 62, 
‘‘the propensity of all single and nu-
merous assemblies to yield to the im-
pulse of sudden and violent passions,’’ 
the Founders created the Senate as a 
check on the House of Representatives. 
They made the Senate smaller and 
Senators’ terms of office longer, with 
the intention of creating a more stable, 
more thoughtful, and more deliberative 
legislative body to check ill-considered 
or intemperate legislation and at-
tempts to curtail minority rights. 
As time has gone on, the legislative 
filibuster has become a key tool in pre-
serving the Founders’ vision of the 
Senate. The filibuster does indeed 
make it harder to get legislation 
through the Senate, and that is a good 
thing. That is what the Founders in-
tended. The Senate was not designed to 
be a rubberstamp for a partisan agen-
da; it was intended to check partisan-
ship or, as the Founders might put it, 
faction. 
Now, does the filibuster sometimes 
stop good legislation from getting 
passed? Of course it does. Last Con-
gress, it stopped us from passing legis-
lation to protect unborn babies who 
can feel pain from being killed by abor-
tion. The failure of the Senate to pass 
that bill, I think, is a tragedy, but just 
as you don’t abolish the burden of 
proof in criminal cases just because 
some criminal sometimes escapes jus-
tice for lack of evidence, you don’t per-
manently remove protections for mi-
nority rights because you might be 
able to force through a good piece of 
legislation. 
In 2005, when some Republicans were 
suggesting eliminating the filibuster 
for judicial nominees, then-Senator 
Joe Biden said: 
I say to my friends on the Republican side: 
You may own the field right now, but you 
won’t own it forever. I pray God when the 
Democrats take back control, we don’t make 
the kind of naked power grab you are doing. 
Fortunately, in 2005, Republicans 
didn’t take that step. And in 2017 and 
2018, when President Trump was push-
ing for Republicans, who were in the 
majority at the time, to abolish the 
legislative filibuster so he could push 
through our agenda and we could push 
through our agenda, we said no. 
For the future of the Senate and our 
system of government, I pray that 
Democrats will make the same deci-
sion. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
BOOKER). The clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
NOMINATION OF XAVIER BECERRA 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President and col-
leagues, very shortly, the Senate will 
have the opportunity to confirm Attor-
ney General Becerra to be the next 
Health and Human Services Secretary, 
and what this means is, after 4 years of 
going in reverse on health policy, it 
will be possible to drive and actually 
make progress for the American people 
in addressing their healthcare needs— 
progress in terms of lowering the cost 
of healthcare. We spent $3.8 trillion 
last year. So we have to lower costs, 
and we have to do it in a way that en-
hances quality, and Attorney General 
Becerra is going to be laser-focused on 
the key priorities for the days ahead. 
We all know that at the heart of that 
agenda is making it possible to end 
this pandemic. 
Now, central to his agenda is going 
to be the distribution of vaccines be-
cause there are a lot of pieces to the 
challenge of beating the pandemic, but 
right at the heart of it is distribution 
of those vaccines and PPE and bringing 
together all the people at Health and 
Human Services and in our country to 
have a coordinated strategy for dealing 
with the pandemic. 
We didn’t have that in the past. I re-
member—and I am sure the Presiding 
Officer remembers—at one point, we 
didn’t have any idea who was in 
charge. One day it was going to be the 
States. The next day it was going to be 
Jared Kushner. There was just bedlam 
for weeks and weeks with respect to 
who would even coordinate this coun-
try’s strategy against the pandemic. 
With Xavier Becerra there, that will 
not be the case. 
I just want—because I see colleagues 
also wanting to speak—to talk about 
another crucial aspect about having 
Xavier Becerra at the Department of 
Health and Human Services. What he is 
going to have to do is move quickly to 
reverse some of those flawed policies of 
the Trump administration, like junk 
insurance, barely worth the paper it 
was written on, the mindless restric-
tions that were placed on coverage. For 
example, that made it harder for peo-
ple to get access to Medicaid. And some 
of what they did just defied common 
sense, making it tougher for people to 
enroll in the Affordable Care Act, and 
having modest efforts in New Jersey 
and Michigan and elsewhere to do out-
reach and to tell people about the 
availability of coverage. 
What in the world is healthcare 
about? It is about getting coverage out 
to people, not inventing barriers to 
their getting care. 
Finally, I just want to mention some 
of the exciting things from the recov-
ery legislation that he will be able to 
focus on. I am sure my colleague from 
Michigan is going to be talking about 
these issues, as well, in the days ahead. 
But what is going to be done in terms 
of delivering postpartum care, an area 
where there has been enormous racial 
injustice, is going to make a huge dif-
ference—a major part of the recovery 
plan—the home and community-based 
services, which build on some of the 
work being done in the community. I 
remember from my days when I was di-
rector of the Gray Panthers, helping 
seniors and the disabled. And we are so 
excited about mental health officials 
and law enforcement officials coming 
together for what is known as the CA-
HOOTS Program from my home State, 
dealing with the racial tensions on the 
streets. 
So Xavier Becerra has been running 
this mammoth agency in his State. 
You know, people say: What is his ex-
perience? He was on the Ways and 
Means Committee for years and years, 
the committee of jurisdiction as it re-
lates to these issues, and then has been 
in California taking on monopolies, 
fighting those who would rip off the 
healthcare system, sticking up for the 
Affordable Care Act. So he has had 
frontline experience on these issues. 
He should have been confirmed a long 
time ago, but now we are on the preci-
pice of finally getting somebody who is 
going to take us forward in that key 
Agency 
in 
terms 
of 
meeting 
the 
healthcare needs for our colleagues. 
When we have this vote shortly, I 
urge in the strongest possible way for 
the Senate to vote to confirm Attorney 
General Xavier Becerra for this crucial 
position. 
I yield the floor to my colleague. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first, 
I have to say to my friend and our lead 
on the Finance Committee how grate-
ful I am for his leadership. We have 
started out very strongly on the Fi-
nance Committee with really impor-
tant topics. I so appreciated yesterday 
focusing on nursing homes and what 
has happened the day before, focusing 
on advanced manufacturing and jobs, 
and your efforts today. It is just issue 
after issue. It is wonderful to have you 
in this position. 
Mr. WYDEN. I thank my colleague. 
Ms. STABENOW. And to be your 
partner in this. 
And I so appreciate the leadership of 
the Senator who is currently in the 
Chair, from New Jersey, as well. 
I rise today, as well, to speak on be-
half of an outstanding nominee to lead 
the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. If there ever was a 
time we needed an outstanding leader, 
it is right now. 
One of the things I find so interesting 
is that colleagues on the other side of 
the aisle say they wish he was a doctor. 
Well, the previous Health and Human 
Services Secretary was the former CEO 
of a drug company. And so, from my

perspective, I am much more com-
fortable having somebody who fought 
drug companies to lower prescription 
drug prices than to have had the person 
in that job before be the person who ac-
tually raised prices on people in his 
former position and tried to block com-
petition. So he is the right person. Xa-
vier Becerra is the right person for this 
moment, I believe. 
Our Nation is still fighting to emerge 
from the worst pandemic in our life-
time. It is hard to believe now that it 
has been over a year that we have been 
struggling and families have been 
struggling with this pandemic. Nearly 
540,000 American lives are lost. It is 
hard for me to even say it and have a 
concept of what that is right now, the 
number of people who have lost loved 
ones and friends and neighbors. Count-
less more have gotten sick. Many more 
remain sick months later. 
The cost to our economy and way of 
life has been massive. Millions of work-
ers have lost their jobs. Thousands of 
businesses have closed, too many of 
them, permanently. 
Families are struggling to pay their 
rent or mortgage, keep the heat on— 
which is really important in a place 
like Michigan in the winter—keep the 
lights on, put food on the table. 
Schools are working hard to reopen 
safely. And, in the meantime, families 
are doing the best they can to make 
sure their children can keep up. 
It is true that we are making 
progress. We are making progress. 
Things are getting better step by step 
by step. 
Thanks to science, we have three 
very effective vaccines going into the 
arms of people across our country, and 
with the American Rescue Plan being 
signed into law, in fact, help is here. It 
is here. 
So now is the time that, as we focus 
on getting help to where it is needed, 
Attorney General Becerra is just the 
leader to do this as the head of Health 
and Human Services. 
His experience will be a tremendous 
asset as he works to address the pan-
demic and make healthcare more af-
fordable. He led the defense in court of 
the Affordable Care Act, which he 
helped to write. It was my pleasure to 
work with him during that process, to 
work with him as House Members and 
then to work with him when we were 
writing the ACA, both in the Ways and 
Means Committee, in which he sat in 
the House, and my sitting on the Fi-
nance Committee. He protected the 
healthcare of millions in his position 
as attorney general. He has taken on 
drug companies, as I said before, for 
their high prices and their role in the 
opioid epidemic. And he has worked to 
enforce mental health parity in Cali-
fornia, which I think is so, so, so im-
portant. 
So many people are living with men-
tal illness and addiction right now and 
have been. In January, 41 percent of 
American adults said they were strug-
gling with anxiety or depression. So 
things have gotten worse—the pressure 
on people as a result of what everybody 
has gone through in the last year. That 
is up from 11 percent before the pan-
demic, and more than one in four 
young people have reported having sui-
cidal thoughts. Meanwhile, commu-
nities are seeing more people overdose. 
Long after the pandemic ends, these 
behavioral health issues will linger. 
Attorney General Becerra began his 
career as a legal aid attorney sup-
porting clients with mental health 
issues and substance abuse issues. He 
knows in his heart and soul how impor-
tant this is. He will bring that same 
compassion and dedication to HHS as 
we work to expand access to care, in-
cluding through certified community 
behavioral health clinics, on which I 
am so proud to have partnered with 
Senator ROY BLUNT and so many of our 
colleagues across the aisle to move for-
ward as the new structure for com-
prehensive, coordinated care in the 
community. And it is beginning to 
make a difference, but we have a lot 
more to do, and we need somebody at 
the head of HHS who gets it. That is 
why I so strongly support Xavier 
Becerra, among so many other reasons. 
American families deserve to know 
that they have someone at the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
who has their backs. With Attorney 
General Becerra, they will know they 
have someone who has their back. 
He is the leader we need to help us 
end this pandemic, to get people the 
care they need, to strengthen our 
healthcare system, and to get our 
country back on track. 
So I look forward to voting for this 
excellent nominee and putting him to 
work on behalf of the American people. 
I urge my colleagues to join us in sup-
porting this excellent nominee. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to oppose the 
nomination for Secretary of Health and 
Human Services of Xavier Becerra. 
As I stand here today, America is 
still fighting the worst pandemic in a 
century. More than half a million 
Americans, as we have just heard, have 
died of this coronavirus. Life expect-
ancy in our country has actually 
dropped by a full year. Now, as a doc-
tor, I will tell you that is a significant 
drop of life expectancy. 
In this time of crisis, our Secretary 
of Health and Human Services may be 
the single most important member in 
the President’s Cabinet. There are 
many well-qualified Democrats, in my 
opinion, who could serve in this posi-
tion. For example, I voted to confirm 
President Obama’s last Secretary of 
Health and Human Services, Sylvia 
Burwell. She was confirmed by a large 
bipartisan majority. 
That is not the kind of nominee that 
we have this time. In the middle of a 
crisis, President Biden has chosen 
someone who is, in my opinion, both 
unqualified and unfit for this specific 
job. 
First, Attorney General Becerra is 
unqualified. Let me talk about that. As 
a doctor, I am deeply concerned that 
President Biden has nominated some-
one with no medical or public health 
experience. He is not a doctor, not a 
scientist, not a public health official. 
He is a trial lawyer and a career politi-
cian. A global pandemic is no time for 
on-the-job healthcare training. The 
Secretary must be ready on day one. 
Attorney General Becerra is not only 
unqualified, I say he is radically liberal 
in his positions. Attorney General 
Becerra is the most leftwing nominee 
for this job, in my opinion, in history. 
He is an aggressive culture warrior 
from the radical left. He supports 
Medicare for All, which would ban pri-
vate health insurance, and 180 million 
people who get their health insurance 
through their jobs would lose it. If his 
positions go forward and he has his 
way, American workers would lose that 
opportunity and that benefit of their 
jobs. 
He has made a name for himself in 
the Democratic Party for his extreme 
positions on abortion. During his 24 
years in Congress, Attorney General 
Becerra voted against every restriction 
on abortion. During his confirmation 
hearing, Senator DAINES
even asked 
him to name a single restriction he 
would support. He couldn’t name a sin-
gle one. This record has earned him a 
‘‘100 percent’’ rating from Planned Par-
enthood. 
As a Congressman, Mr. Becerra even 
voted against the ban on partial-birth 
abortion. The Supreme Court, rightly, 
upheld banning partial-birth abortions 
in the United States. 
This wasn’t the only time the attor-
ney general’s positions were at odds 
with that of the current Supreme 
Court as he was attorney general in 
California. 
During his confirmation hearing, Mr. 
Becerra claimed he never sued any 
nuns. That is his quote: ‘‘never sued 
any nuns.’’ He also said he only sued 
because of California law. Well, both of 
these statements stretch the truth, to 
put it mildly. 
In 2017, the Trump administration 
gave a group of nuns an exception from 
being required to pay for birth control. 
The nuns say that violates their reli-
gious beliefs, having to pay for birth 
control. Attorney General Becerra then 
sued the Trump administration to stop 
them from giving this exemption. At-
torney General of California Becerra, 
the nominee to be Secretary of Health 
and Human Services, lost at the Su-
preme Court by a vote of 7 to 2. 
One of the jobs of the Secretary of 
Health and Human Services is to pro-
tect the conscience rights of doctors 
and nurses. Mr. Becerra’s record shows 
he can’t be trusted to do that. 
There is a well-known case involving 
Crisis Pregnancy Centers. Now, these 
are groups that help women facing an 
unplanned pregnancy. California said

they had to advertise where these 
women could go to get abortions. At-
torney General Becerra brought the 
full power of the State of California 
against the pro-life groups. Once again, 
the Supreme Court of the United 
States stepped in to stop him. 
Mr. Becerra also used the power of 
his office to criminally prosecute pro- 
life journalists. A pro-life activist went 
undercover to investigate Planned Par-
enthood for trafficking in aborted body 
parts. His revelations caused outrage 
across the country. Attorney General 
Becerra charged him, the undercover 
reporter, with 15 felony counts. 
This was too much even for Attorney 
General Becerra’s liberal hometown 
newspaper. The Los Angeles Times 
said: 
It’s disturbingly aggressive for Becerra to 
apply this criminal statute to people who 
were trying to influence a contested issue of 
public policy, regardless of how sound or 
popular that policy may be. 
So Attorney General Becerra is a 
radical liberal on a whole host of 
issues. As attorney general of Cali-
fornia, he sued the Trump administra-
tion over 120 different times. That is 
quite a few. This includes filing nine 
lawsuits on the very last day of Presi-
dent Trump’s administration—the very 
last day, nine more lawsuits added to 
the pile. 
He sued to try to stop President 
Trump from building the wall on the 
southern border. He sued the Trump 
administration to try to stop fracking 
on Federal lands in California. This is 
just the tip of the iceberg. The list goes 
on and on. When you look at the 
record, it is clear: Xavier Becerra is 
out of touch with the views of the 
American people. 
President Biden has chosen an ex-
tremely liberal Cabinet. He was forced 
to withdraw his nominee for Budget Di-
rector. His Vice President has been the 
least bipartisan, in terms of a Senator 
of record, of any Senator in 2019. And 
now Attorney General Becerra seems 
to be the most liberal of them all. 
Frankly, 
his 
selection, 
I 
think, 
shocked a lot of people across the coun-
try. During this pandemic, we need a 
leader for the Department of Health 
and Human Services who brings us to-
gether as a nation. Instead, the Presi-
dent has chosen a nominee with no 
public health experience and an ex-
tremely partisan record, so I urge my 
colleagues to reject this unqualified, 
incredibly liberal nominee. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, Presi-
dent Biden has a lot of duties and obli-
gations and a lot on his plate right 
now. The important thing that we are 
involved in, that we are all concerned 
about, are the nominees, who they are, 
what the process is, and what leverage 
do we in the minority have to impact 
that. 
I think that Xavier Becerra is not fit 
to be our Secretary of Health and 
Human Services, and I say this because 
of his appalling track record dis-
respecting the sanctity of life, bla-
tantly attacking First Amendment 
rights, and his extreme policy views. 
Now, throughout his career, Mr. 
Becerra has proven he has no shame 
when it comes to his pro-abortion be-
liefs. As attorney general of California, 
Becerra led a yearslong lawsuit tar-
geting the Little Sisters of the Poor. 
This order of Catholic nuns is devoted 
to caring for the elderly poor. All they 
want is to be free to operate in accord-
ance with their religious beliefs, and I 
think we can all understand that. But 
Becerra sued the Federal Government 
to force the nuns—and we are talking 
about the Little Sisters of the Poor—to 
provide access to birth control and 
abortion-inducing 
drugs, 
completely 
disrespecting their religious beliefs. 
During his confirmation hearings, 
multiple Senators asked Mr. Becerra 
about his lawsuit, and he said: 
I’ve never sued any affiliation of nuns. 
[M]y actions have always been directed at 
the Federal agencies. 
But I think it is pretty misleading 
because he may have sued the Federal 
Government, but his actions certainly 
were directed at the nuns. 
And that is not his only assault on 
life. Mr. Becerra also fought against 
the Trump administration’s title X 
rule in court. We all remember this. 
This is where he ensured that Federal 
tax dollars would only go toward fam-
ily planning clinics that don’t offer 
abortions. 
And, during the pandemic, Becerra 
has been an aggressive advocate of ex-
panding access to chemical abortions, 
thereby providing abortions by mail 
that are done at home and without the 
supervision of a medical provider. And 
all abortions, in my view—and I know 
a lot of people don’t agree with this, 
but I think all abortions are bad. But 
increasing 
unsupervised 
access 
to 
chemical abortions, which are four 
times more likely to cause problems 
and complications for the mother than 
surgical abortions, shows that Mr. 
Becerra’s concern isn’t about health; it 
is about his pro-abortion agenda. 
We shouldn’t be surprised. During his 
time in Congress, Mr. Becerra voted 
against multiple pro-life bills, includ-
ing the partial-birth abortion ban, and 
that was one that was sponsored on 
both sides. It was a bipartisan bill. It 
banned the horrific procedure in which 
a baby is partially delivered and then 
painfully destroyed. 
But Becerra isn’t just radical in his 
support for abortion. He also goes after 
the First Amendment rights of individ-
uals who disagree with him. I am sure 
everyone here remembers the shock-
ing, 
heart-wrenching 
evidence 
col-
lected by two undercover journalists in 
2015 that showed Planned Parenthood’s 
involvement in selling the body parts 
of aborted babies. Becerra has chosen 
to prosecute the journalists rather 
than take the action to protect babies 
and investigate the evidence of this be-
havior. 
Becerra also targeted the California 
pro-life pregnancy centers by forcing 
them to advertise abortions, in viola-
tion of their First Amendment rights. 
Now, he fought them all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme Court, and he lost. 
But he didn’t give up. Last fall, he 
supported California’s ban on indoor 
worship services, also in violation of 
the First Amendment, and he lost 
again in the Supreme Court. He doesn’t 
give up. Justice Gorsuch said—and this 
is a quote from Justice Gorsuch. He 
said: 
If Hollywood may host a studio audience or 
film a singing competition while not a single 
soul may enter California’s churches, syna-
gogues, and mosques, something has gone se-
riously awry. 
I agree with Justice Gorsuch in that 
observation. 
Becerra also wants to decriminalize 
illegal immigration, saying: 
They are not criminals. They haven’t com-
mitted a crime against someone. 
Should he be confirmed to be the 
HHS Secretary, he would be positioned 
to give illegal immigrants access to his 
programs. 
So, lastly, I just want to send a mes-
sage to the pro-life movement, to peo-
ple in Oklahoma and Americans all 
around the country who really believe 
in the sanctity of life. We are not going 
to give up in trying to block this nomi-
nation, and we will do everything we 
can to stop the confirmation of Xavier 
Becerra. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
FILIBUSTER 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier 
today, my friend from South Dakota, 
the Republican Senator JOHN THUNE, 
came to the floor and discussed the fili-
buster. It has been a topic of discussion 
not only this week but even before. I 
hope that Senator THUNE will concede 
that whether you are for the filibuster 
or against the filibuster, we should cer-
tainly be dedicated to the proposition 
that the U.S. Senate should be a delib-
erative body that actually considers 
amendments and legislation on the 
floor. 
Now, what I just said sounds very 
routine and normal. It is radical when 
you look at the record of the U.S. Sen-
ate. Last year, under the Republican 
leadership of Senator MCCONNELL, we 
had 29 amendments on the floor the en-
tire year—29. That was really an im-
provement over the previous year, 30 
percent better than the previous year— 
22 amendments. What that says to 
those who may not be familiar with 
Senate procedure is that the floor is 
empty and no one is here because we 
aren’t taking up legislation. Why?

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1630 
March 18, 2021 
So far this year, we have done three 
things in the Senate: the impeachment 
trial; the reconciliation bill, the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan by President Biden; 
and nominations. What do those three 
things have in common? None of them, 
not one of them can be stopped by a fil-
ibuster. Why aren’t we taking up other 
legislation? Because looming over us is 
a supermajority requirement of 60 
votes to get anything done. 
What I have said to my friends on the 
Republican side of the aisle is, show me 
that we can make the Senate function. 
If we can show that with the filibuster, 
so be it. If we can show it by changing 
the filibuster, so be it. But let’s do 
something. 
We were elected to do things. We 
were elected to pass an infrastructure 
bill for America. It has been years 
since we have done that. We were elect-
ed to deal with issues that are funda-
mental to this country. What about all 
the student loan debt in this country? 
Are we going to do anything about it, 
say anything about it? Nothing is com-
ing to the floor, is it? There are so 
many issues that we should be taking 
up that we are not taking up because of 
the looming specter of the filibuster. 
That is a reality. 
Let me bring that reality close to 
home. Twenty years ago, I introduced 
the DREAM Act. I said if you were 
brought to America as an infant, tod-
dler, child, young person—your family 
brought you here, you grew up here, 
you went to school here, and you 
pledged allegiance to that flag in your 
classroom every single day—at some 
point in your life, you ought to have 
the opportunity to earn your way to be 
a legal person in America, a citizen in 
America. I don’t think that is a radical 
idea. In fact, the overwhelming major-
ity of Americans support the idea. 
So, DURBIN, let me ask you a ques-
tion. It has been 20 years. You are sup-
posed to be a legislator. Why haven’t 
you passed this, something that simple 
and that direct? I haven’t made it a 
law of the land because of one thing: 
the filibuster. The filibuster. Five 
times I have brought this measure to 
the floor of the U.S. Senate and have 
been stopped by the filibuster; a major-
ity vote every time but never the 
magic 60, the magic supermajority. 
So do I have a problem with the fili-
buster? Yes, I do. I challenge those who 
are defending it to show me it can 
work, to show me we can create bipar-
tisan votes on the floor, actually de-
bate on the floor, amendments on the 
floor, legislation on the floor. That is 
not too much to ask. I think that is 
why we were elected. 
I come today to address this issue be-
cause the House is expected to vote on 
the Dream and Promise Act and Farm 
Workforce Modernization Act. If the 
Senate is able to join the House in 
passing these bills, we would be able to 
make significant immigration legisla-
tion progress. 
But I want to add that I support com-
prehensive immigration reform. I be-
lieve it is the only honest answer to 
what we face in America today. I will 
do my best to do everything I can. 
There is no excuse for inaction. This 
broken immigration system needs to be 
addressed on a bipartisan basis, and an 
answer is long overdue for Dreamers in 
this country. I have told you who they 
are. 
When 
President 
Obama 
created 
DACA for them, some 800,000 came for-
ward, registered with the government, 
and received legal status to work and 
freedom from fear of deportation be-
cause of DACA. 
President Trump eliminated the pro-
gram. The battle ensued in court. The 
Supreme Court said that Trump did it 
wrong, and we are now in the middle 
ground. 
President Biden supports DACA. He 
has made it clear that it is open for 
new people to apply. Yet we don’t have 
the final law. 
We are dealing with Executive orders 
when it comes to this important issue. 
That is why I have decided to come to 
this floor and to continue to raise the 
issues of the people who are involved 
and to introduce my 129th Dreamer 
story on the floor of the U.S. Senate, 
which I have done for years. 
Diana Andino. She was born in Ecua-
dor. She came to the United States 
when she was 11 years old. She grew up 
in Houston, TX. She was quite a stu-
dent. She graduated in the top 10 per-
cent of her high school class and went 
on to earn a bachelor’s degree with 
honors from the University of Houston, 
in biology with a minor in chemistry. 
She wrote me a letter, and here is 
what she said about her dream of be-
coming a physician: 
I found my calling in medicine after volun-
teering at a local county hospital while I was 
in college. 
Here is what she said about the dif-
ference that DACA made in her life: 
I graduated from college in 2011, and my 
dream of becoming a physician was trun-
cated by my lack of citizenship status. How-
ever, DACA came in place a year later. I was 
able to apply to school and was accepted at 
the Loyola University Stritch School of 
Medicine in Chicago. 
Let me just say, hats off to Loyola 
and their medical school. They have 
led the Nation in accepting wonderful 
students just like Diana. They were the 
first in the Nation to accept DACA ap-
plicants. More than 30 have since at-
tended their medical school, and many 
of them are practicing in underserved 
areas. 
Diana graduated from Loyola Med-
ical School and now is a third-year 
resident at Loyola University Medical 
Center. She treats COVID–19 patients 
with serious complications, such as 
stroke or major bleeding. 
Here is what she said about the 
COVID–19 pandemic: 
It’s been a challenging year not only phys-
ically but mentally. Patients with COVID–19 
developed multiple neurological complica-
tions that we have encountered and continue 
to learn about. As a neurology resident, I’ve 
learned to be flexible as there are so many 
unknowns we encountered almost daily. 
How many times have we said in the 
last year: Thank God for people just 
like this woman, who risks her life as 
a doctor for COVID–19 patients. Our 
brothers and sisters, our family mem-
bers, people whom we love are kept 
alive because Diana is skilled enough 
and brave enough to go into their 
rooms and try to save their lives. 
We think so much of Diana that we 
have to debate in the Senate whether 
she should be a citizen of the United 
States. There is no debate, as far as I 
am concerned. She is exactly the kind 
of person we need in America’s future. 
Send her back to Ecuador? No. Let her 
stay in her home country of America. 
Make the Dream Act a reality. Make 
it the law of the land. Don’t let a fili-
buster stop it again. When we receive 
the Dream and Promise Act from the 
House of Representatives, we will have 
an opportunity to see if 10 Republican 
Senators can join us in an effort to fi-
nally pass it—I hope more. 
As I said at the outset, I support 
comprehensive immigration reform. I 
want to try to sit down and have a con-
versation about the farm labor bill, 
about those who are here in temporary 
protected status, about essential work-
ers like Diana who ought to be given a 
chance to become citizens in this coun-
try. That is what the debate is all 
about. 
This empty floor, with no conversa-
tion among Senators, is testimony to 
the fact that this is an aspiration—an 
aspiration that we can overcome the 
filibuster, pass the Dream Act and 
more and do it soon. Lives depend on 
it. Futures depend on it. The dreams of 
America are at stake. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mr. SASSE. I ask unanimous consent

The PRESIDING OFFICER. Abso-

Actually, I note one objection from 
the junior Senator from New Jersey. 
Mr. SASSE. I ask unanimous consent 
to begin the vote now. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. I am 
sorry I might have seen an objection 
from the Senator. 
No, there is no objection. 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
VOTE ON BECERRA NOMINATION 
Under

nation? 
Mr. SASSE. I ask for the yeas and

UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 823 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in 
support of legislation developed by our 
colleague, Senator BROWN, and me to 
protect $1,400 relief payments from 
being garnished by predatory private 
debt collectors. 
We know that millions of American 
families are hanging on by a thread. 
They are counting on these payments 
to make rent and pay for groceries and 
medicines. 
Now Senator BROWN and I want to in-
clude these protections in the Amer-
ican Rescue Plan. We wanted to in-
clude them, just like we had done in 
the December relief bill, but the prob-
lem was that Senate rules didn’t allow 
Senator BROWN and me to include these 
protections in the American Rescue 
Plan, just like we had done earlier. 
If the Senate doesn’t pass this bill, 
predatory debt collectors will continue 
to seize relief payments for everything 
from credit cards to medical debt. 
And as we talk about this right now, 
I would like to give an example of what 
this really means. If you have two par-
ents who have lost their jobs, through 
no fault of their own, and they can’t 
pay the rent because their relief check 
has been seized to cover a child’s out-
standing hospital bills—that is what is 
going to happen if you don’t pass the 
legislation Senator BROWN and I are 
advocating. 
So I think this one is cut and dry. 
The Senate will either stand today for 
the working families who desperately 
need this help, like that couple who are 
hurting, through no fault of their own, 
or the Senate is with private debt col-
lectors reaching their hands into those 
families’ pockets. 
Now, these protections that we are 
talking about were included in the De-
cember 
package, 
with 
Republicans 
fully supporting it. Families’ financial 
situations haven’t changed so I hope 
that Republicans will allow for the pas-
sage of this measure offered by Senator 
BROWN
and me. It is just common 
sense. 
And I am going to yield now—the mi-
nority is aware—to Senator BROWN. He, 
too, will have short remarks, and then 
we will engage with our colleague on 
the other side. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Ohio. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank 
the senior Senator from Oregon, and I 
thank the Senator from Pennsylvania 
too. 
We passed the American Rescue Plan, 
as Senator WYDEN said, to get shots in 
people’s arms, money in people’s pock-
ets, get kids back in schools, and peo-
ple back in jobs. Stimulus checks are 
already going out the door in Hawaii, 
in Pennsylvania, in Oregon, and Ohio. 
More than 100 million checks are al-
ready in Americans’ bank accounts. We 
promised in campaigns, we promised in 
January we would do this and we would 
do this quickly. 
Five million Ohioans are going to get 
a check. We know predatory debt col-
lectors are already lining up to try to 
take a cut of those checks. We know it 
costs more to be poor in this country. 
So often the debt collectors come after 
you. Just to cash your check, there 
often is a fee and all the bank fees that 
they have. 
We passed the rescue plan to put 
money in people’s pockets so they can 
pay bills and buy groceries and spend 
money in local businesses. They can 
buy a washer perhaps made by Amer-
ican workers in Clyde, OH, or new tires 
for their cars made at Goodyear in 
Akron, OH. Maybe they are looking 
forward to throwing a small high 
school graduation party in their back-
yard—after they get their vaccines— 
with a cake and a barbecue from a 
local restaurant. 
That is why we passed these checks, 
to support families, to support local 
economies, not to line the pockets of 
predatory private debt collectors. That 
is why I appreciate Senator WYDEN’s 
work with us on this bill to protect 
Americans’ stimulus checks from fi-
nancial predators. 
We know how aggressive private debt 
collectors are. They harass people. 
They prey on workers trying to make 
ends meet, and now they want to take 
this money before it even reaches 
Americans’ bank accounts. 
Last year, as Senator WYDEN said, we 
joined colleagues GRASSLEY, a Repub-
lican from Iowa, and SCOTT, a Repub-
lican from South Carolina, to pass bi-
partisan legislation to protect people’s 
money. 
It shouldn’t be different this time. 
We are still in a public health crisis. 
Whether you voted for or against this 
American Recovery Act is immaterial. 
We have a choice. Whose side are you 
on? Are you going to protect workers 
and their families or are you going to 
side with debt collectors? 
I yield my time back to Senator 
WYDEN. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, as in leg-
islative session, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Senate proceed to the im-
mediate consideration of S. 823 intro-
duced earlier today. The bill would pro-
vide for protection of recovery rebates. 
I further ask that the bill be read a 
third time and passed and the motion 
to reconsider be considered made and 
laid upon the table with no intervening 
action or debate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
an objection? 
The Senator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. TOOMEY. Mr. President, reserv-
ing the right to object, my friend, the 
Senator from Oregon, suggested that 
the Senate rules precluded this provi-
sion from being addressed in the re-
cently passed bill. 
It is actually a little bit more com-
plicated than that. So let’s remember 
how we got here. 
Last year, Republicans and Demo-
crats worked together, and we passed 
five bills, adding up to about $4 tril-
lion, authorizing another several tril-
lion dollars of loans. It was an extraor-
dinary reaction to an extraordinary 
moment, and Republicans and Demo-
crats came together time and time 
again. 
As the circumstances were changing, 
we passed new legislation to reflect 
that—passing a big bill, a trillion-dol-
lar bill nearly, in December. But as 
soon as our Democratic colleagues had 
the ability, they decided they weren’t 
interested in any bipartisan legislation

anymore. It was going to be strictly 
Democrats using the reconciliation 
process, and that is the only reason 
that this provision couldn’t be ad-
dressed because it can’t be dealt with 
under the reconciliation rules. 
So now our Democratic colleagues 
perceive a problem with this legisla-
tion, and they would like the Repub-
licans’ consent to fix what might have 
been resolved with some kind of com-
promise had they pursued the path that 
we pursued when we were in control. 
But let’s talk about where we are and 
what we have done for individuals and 
families. The unprecedented financial 
support from the Federal Government 
has been really amazing. An average 
family of four has, by now, received 
stimulus checks of $9,200 and child tax 
credit checks of $6,000. That is $15,200. 
By the way, that has gone to people 
who never lost a penny of income. And 
if they did lose their job, as in the hy-
pothetical that the Senator from Or-
egon suggests, then the unemployment 
benefits, in more than half the cases, 
paid them more than they made work-
ing because of the legislation that we 
passed. We designed it so they would 
pay people more not to work than they 
would make working, in addition to 
these stimulus checks that they got. 
So the result of that is, in the aggre-
gate, 
personal 
savings 
have 
gone 
through the roof. It is up by over $1.6 
trillion. Total consumer credit is down. 
The fact is, we more than replaced lost 
income through the series of bills that 
were passed. 
Now my colleagues want to come 
here and block a valid, legal claim 
from being honored with some of this 
money. And specifically, they want to 
block these stimulus checks from being 
subject to garnishment. 
So what is a garnishment? That is 
just when money is withheld from 
someone because they owe something. 
They owe money that they haven’t 
paid to someone else, and that someone 
else has gone to court, made the case, 
and it has been adjudicated that, yes, 
this is money that is owed. 
So they want to forbid this windfall— 
which in many, many cases this is a 
windfall, let’s be honest. They want to 
prevent it from being available to be 
used for the conventional way that we 
collect money that is owed. And whom 
might this affect? 
Under this legislation, if it were to 
pass, it would forbid garnishment of 
the alimony payment that a needy 
former spouse relies on. That is a com-
mon expense for which garnishment ap-
plies. But in this case, the deadbeat 
former husband who is not paying his 
alimony payments, who forced his 
former wife to go to court to get a 
court order, he has been so far behind, 
now he gets this big check from the 
government, and she doesn’t even get 
to catch up on the money that he owes 
her? 
How about the deadbeat dad who is 
not paying his child support? That is 
another situation in which the mom, 
trying to struggle to support those 
kids, had to go to court and get a court 
order that his future income would be 
garnished because he just doesn’t pay. 
Well, he gets this check in the mail, 
compliments of the taxpayer, and he 
doesn’t have to give her any of that? 
That is so terribly unfair. 
And, you know, in addition to all 
these direct payments, we have also 
provided massive financial support in 
all kinds of ways to alleviate expenses 
like nutrition assistance, $80 billion; 
housing assistance, $65 billion; increase 
of Medicaid, $170 billion; not to men-
tion almost $1 trillion in payroll sup-
port so that people could continue to 
work. 
When you pay for all of these things 
and you still give people money on top 
of that, I don’t think it is unreasonable 
to ask people to pay their bills, espe-
cially their overdue bills to their 
former wife or to support their kids. 
Here is the other thing. At best, this 
is now a political statement because, 
as one of many colleagues just alluded 
to, these payments have already gone 
out the door—most of them have. The 
Treasury has already issued probably 
over $250 billion in stimulus checks. 
And to the extent that a person was 
subject to garnishment, the garnish-
ment happens automatically. So it has 
already happened. 
So what does that mean if this bill 
passed? The legal chaos—I mean, first 
of all, it would actually allow the dead-
beat dad I am referring to, to go back 
and claim that money back, to claw it 
back from the account that is meant to 
support his kids. How is that even pos-
sibly fair or reasonable? 
This is a bad idea, and for these rea-
sons, I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ob-
jection is heard. 
Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, just 
briefly. I think the key kind of ques-
tion—and the checks are still going 
out, and we want them to get out as 
quickly as possible, but the key issue 
here is the Republicans, back in De-
cember, wanted to help that couple 
that I was talking about, the person 
laid off, through no fault of their own. 
They wanted to help those folks to 
make sure their relief check wouldn’t 
be seized to cover a child’s outstanding 
hospital bills. 
So what we heard are discussions 
about all kinds of, you know, other 
issues, but the fact is, in December, 
just a few weeks ago—just a few weeks 
ago—Republicans were supportive of 
the families Senator BROWN and I are 
seeking to help today. That is what the 
question is all about. Will the Senate 
today help the folks who are hurting 
that Senator BROWN and I have been 
talking about? 
In December, Republicans said: You 
bet we are going to be there. Now it is 
a question, really, of whom the Senate 
is for. Senator BROWN and I are for 
those folks who are hurting, and they 
have been laid off through no fault of 
their own, and Republicans, unfortu-
nately, with checks still going out— 
still going out—have decided they are 
for the private debt collectors. 
I think it really shows whose side 
you are on, and Senator BROWN and I 
and members of our caucus are on the 
side of the people who are hurting, 
through no fault of their own, and we 
especially care about them at this time 
when checks are still going out. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. BROWN. I suggest the absence of 
a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KING). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
NOMINATION OF MARTIN JOSEPH WALSH 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come 
to the floor today to support the nomi-
nation of Mayor Marty Walsh to serve 
as Secretary of Labor. 
Across the country, working families 
are really desperate for help. Even be-
fore this pandemic, the deck was 
stacked against workers and especially 
against women, workers of color, and 
workers with disabilities, thanks to an 
unlivable Federal minimum wage and 
subminimum wage for tipped workers 
and workers with disabilities that do 
leave millions of workers struggling to 
make ends meet; a pay gap that makes 
getting by even harder for women, in 
particular, women of color; a lack of a 
national paid family, sick, and medical 
leave policy and quality, affordable 
childcare for working families; a fail-
ure to protect workers from pandemics 
and workplace accidents and harass-
ment and discrimination and more; and 
a wave of job loss and economic uncer-
tainty that is upending the lives of 
workers and retirees across our coun-
try. 
This pandemic has laid bare the pain-
ful fact that while our economy might 
work for the biggest corporations and 
wealthiest individuals, it isn’t working 
for working families. And all of these 
challenges—unsafe 
workplaces, 
lost 
jobs, low wages—are even worse for 
people of color due to longstanding in-
equities that are rooted in systemic 
racism and are widening due to this 
pandemic. 
Our country cannot fully recover 
from this crisis unless we begin to 
change that by rebuilding a stronger, 
fairer economy. And that starts by 
making sure we have a Secretary of 
Labor who will actually champion 
workers and working families. 
As a union leader, a State represent-
ative, and as a mayor, Mayor Marty 
Walsh has done just that. He has a 
clear track record as a collaborative 
leader who worked across coalitions 
with labor groups and the business 
community to build up Boston’s middle 
class. Under his leadership, 135,000 new 
jobs have been created in Boston.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1633 
March 18, 2021 
He fought for a $15 minimum wage 
and paid leave policies to help ensure 
women, workers of color, and workers 
with disabilities can succeed in the 
workforce and get the pay they de-
serve. 
During this pandemic, Mayor Walsh 
has continued to show a deep commit-
ment to his frontline workers who have 
kept this country running by providing 
funding for emergency childcare and 
other resources his essential workers 
needed to weather the pandemic. 
And he would bring an important 
perspective as the first union leader to 
head the Department in decades. 
His unwavering commitment to put 
workers first was plain to see during 
our confirmation hearing. In his testi-
mony Mayor Walsh spoke powerfully 
about the importance of protecting 
frontline workers who do so much to 
keep our communities and our country 
running and rooting out the inequities 
that have done so much damage to 
communities of color. Mayor Walsh 
made clear he will work with Congress 
to help ensure every worker has a fair, 
livable wage; a safe workplace; paid 
family, sick, and medical leave; access 
to quality, affordable childcare; a se-
cure retirement; and the right to join a 
union and collectively organize. 
I was impressed by his answers dur-
ing our hearing, and I wasn’t the only 
one. Mayor Walsh’s nomination passed 
out of our HELP Committee with 
strong bipartisan support in an 18-to-4 
vote, and I hope he will now be con-
firmed with similar, overwhelming, bi-
partisan support because even before 
this pandemic and even before Presi-
dent Trump’s 4-year crusade against 
workers, we had a long road ahead to 
build a truly fair, inclusive economy 
that works for working families. But, 
now, not only is the road longer, the 
clock is ticking. 
Workers who are the backbone of our 
economy have been pushed to the 
brink. They need us to confirm Mayor 
Marty Walsh so we have a Secretary of 
Labor who will take quick action to 
address the urgent challenges we face 
and be a valuable partner in helping 
our economy come back stronger and 
fairer for all workers. 
While we made important progress in 
the American Rescue Plan to extend 
unemployment benefits and provide 
much needed tax relief for those bene-
fits, provide direct payments for fami-
lies, and protect the pensions millions 
of workers and retirees depend on and 
while President Biden is taking impor-
tant steps to reverse Trump-era rules 
that undermined workers’ rights, this 
road to recovery is long, and there are 
still many steps we need to take, in-
cluding raising the Federal minimum 
wage to one fair wage of $15 an hour, 
passing the PRO Act into law to 
strengthen workers’ right to join a 
union, and passing the BE HEARD in 
the Workplace Act to protect people 
from harassment, assault, and dis-
crimination. 
We have a lot to do and no time to 
waste. I urge all of my colleagues to 
prove to families back home they un-
derstand we need a Secretary of Labor 
we can trust to stand up for workers 
and not huge corporations. I urge my 
colleagues to join me in voting to con-
firm Mayor Walsh. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, I ask unan-
imous consent that the order for the 
quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 842 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, in a mo-
ment, I am going to propound a unani-
mous consent request, but before I do 
so, I want to make some brief remarks. 
As my colleagues know and as sev-
eral fact checkers have confirmed over 
the past week, the Democrats’ partisan 
reconciliation bill that became law last 
week will provide many illegal aliens 
with $1,400 rebate checks paid for by 
the American taxpayer. By several es-
timates, millions of illegal immigrants 
will get these rebates. 
I offered an amendment 2 weeks ago 
to the Democrats’ bill to close this 
loophole. During debate on my amend-
ment, one Democratic Senator spoke 
against my amendment, saying that no 
illegal aliens have Social Security 
numbers, and therefore the premise of 
my amendment and my speech was, he 
said, ‘‘not true.’’ In fact, here are the 
Senator’s full remarks from the floor 2 
weeks ago: 
Mr. President, the statement from the Sen-
ator from Texas is just plain false. Let me be 
clear. Undocumented immigrants do not 
have Social Security numbers, and they do 
not qualify for stimulus relief checks, pe-
riod. 
And just in case you didn’t notice, they 
didn’t qualify in December when 92 of us 
voted for that measure, and they don’t qual-
ify under the American Rescue Plan. Noth-
ing has changed. 
And for you to stand up there and say the 
opposite is just to rile people up over some-
thing that is not true. 
It is not true, and we know what is going 
on [here]. They want to be able to give 
speeches and say the checks go to undocu-
mented people. In the circumstance where 
there is a parent receiving— 
At that point, the Senator’s time ex-
pired. 
Following that debate, the Senator 
in question took to Twitter to double 
down. So it was not, after an all-night 
of no sleep, a moment of erroneous 
comment, but, rather, on Twitter that 
same Senator tweeted: 
Sen. Cruz’s claim is only meant to rile peo-
ple up over something that’s not true. You 
cannot receive a stimulus check without a 
Social Security #. That’s a fact. Instead of 
discriminating against mixed-status fami-
lies, let’s prioritize getting more relief to 
those families. 
A second tweet from the same Sen-
ator: 
We simply cannot stand by and allow out-
right falsehoods to be propagated on the Sen-
ate floor. It’s time for GOP Senators like 
TED CRUZ to stop trying to rile people up 
over misinformation. 
Well, as John Adams famously said, 
facts are stubborn things, and it turns 
out the comments from the Democratic 
Senator were categorically false and 
my comments that this bill would send 
checks to millions of illegal aliens 
were categorically true. 
Numerous fact checkers began look-
ing at the claims. Newsweek initially 
fact-checked it, and, as is the wont 
with a fair number of media fact 
checkers, took the word of the Demo-
crats for it, concluded my statement 
was mostly false. 
Following that, my staff got on the 
phone with Newsweek and presented 
them with incontrovertible facts—in-
controvertible facts that of the roughly 
12 million estimated illegal aliens who 
are here, roughly 60 percent of them 
are visa overstays, people who came le-
gally and then overstayed their visa, 
and a significant percentage of visa 
overstays have Social Security num-
bers and will receive checks. 
Indeed, that is why my amendment 
was scored at saving the Federal Gov-
ernment over $600 million, because of 
the checks that would not go to illegal 
immigrants if my amendment had been 
passed. 
When Newsweek heard these facts, 
they did something really quite im-
pressive, admirable. They admitted 
they were wrong. They revised their 
fact check, and they changed their fact 
check from mostly false to true. True, 
period. No caveats. True. I want to 
commend Newsweek for demonstrating 
journalistic integrity. Correcting that 
fact-check, I am sure, was not an easy 
decision for them to make, but it was 
the right decision for them to make. 
So, Mr. President, I would ask unani-
mous consent that we enter this fact- 
check into the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the mate-
rial was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From Newsweek, Mar. 8, 2021] 
FACT CHECK: WILL MILLIONS OF ILLEGAL IM-
MIGRANTS GET STIMULUS CHECKS, AS TED 
CRUZ SAYS? 
(By Graham McNally) 
Senator Ted Cruz (R–Texas) proposed an 
amendment to the American Rescue Plan 
that would bar illegal immigrants from ac-
cess to the $1,400 stimulus checks. 
His amendment was voted down after Sen-
ator Dick Durbin (D–Ill.) criticized Cruz for 
trying to ‘‘rile people up over something 
that is not true.’’ 
THE CLAIM 
Cruz claimed on Twitter that illegal immi-
grants would be eligible for the $1,400 stim-
ulus checks included in the American Rescue 
Plan. 
On March 6, Cruz tweeted, ‘‘When the 
checks go out, millions of illegal immigrants 
WILL GET $1400 checks.’’ 
He wrote that many people considered ille-
gal immigrants are those who have over-
stayed their visas, and therefore have Social 
Security numbers. 
Cruz argued that the possession of Social 
Security numbers will allow unlawfully 
present individuals to obtain the stimulus 
money.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1634 
March 18, 2021 
THE FACTS 
Anyone who pays taxes in the United 
States as a resident is eligible for a stimulus 
payment under the American Rescue Plan. 
That includes non-citizens. 
For example, a citizen of Canada who is 
living and working full time in the U.S. 
would have a Social Security number and 
would be eligible for a stimulus payment. 
The United States Department of Home-
land Security website describes unauthorized 
immigrants as foreign-born non-citizens who 
live in the United States without legal resi-
dence. Individuals who overstay their visas 
but pay tax in the United States using a So-
cial Security number can be eligible for 
stimulus payments. The most recent avail-
able data for the number of visa overstays in 
the United States is from 2019, released by 
the Department of Homeland Security. It 
said that 1.21 percent of visas in that year 
were overstayed, or 676,422 overstays. In 2019, 
student visas (1.52 percent) had a higher 
overstay rate than those from Canada and 
Mexico (.75 percent, 1.27 percent, respec-
tively). 
Illegal immigrants would not be eligible to 
receive a check if they do not have a Social 
Security number. 
Immigrants who overstay their visas no 
longer are lawfully in the country but retain 
their Social Security numbers and therefore 
are eligible to receive a check. 
‘‘Technically, if they have overstayed their 
visa, they are here illegally,’’ a spokes-
woman for U.S. Customs and Border Protec-
tion told Newsweek. ‘‘If a visitor has not 
been granted an extension of status by 
USCIS [United States Citizenship and Immi-
gration Services], then they are considered 
to be overstays and subject to deportable 
status under 237 of the Immigration and Na-
tionality Act.’’ 
People who qualify as legal residents in-
clude those who have passed the green card 
test (permanent legal residents) or those who 
pass the substantial presence test. That test 
requires taxpayers to be physically present 
in the United States for 31 days of the cur-
rent year and 183 days for the past three 
years. 
Anyone who has a green card is considered 
a legal permanent resident, and would be eli-
gible for the stimulus payment. 
THE RULING 
True. 
Cruz’s claim that millions of illegal immi-
grants would receive stimulus payments is 
true, given the amount of people who have 
overstayed their visas over the years. Once 
they overstay, they technically are consid-
ered ‘‘illegal.’’ 
Correction, March 9, 4:00 pm EST: The rul-
ing on this story has been corrected to true. 
A statement from Customs and Border Pa-
trol has been added. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President, it is clear 
and indisputable that a significant 
number of illegal immigrants will re-
ceive checks and are receiving checks 
right now. All 100 Members of this body 
were misinformed by the Democratic 
Senator that no illegal aliens would re-
ceive fact checks—would receive, rath-
er, stimulus checks. So I want to give 
my colleagues a chance to adopt the 
amendment now, with the correct in-
formation, with the true information, 
with the factual information. 
I would note as well, in these deeply 
partisan times, it is easy for Repub-
licans to throw insults at Democrats; 
it is easy for Democrats to throw in-
sults at Republicans. Far too much of 
that occurs. 
The Senator from Illinois, who is a 
friend whom I served with for 9 years, 
is a talented Senator. I am not here 
suggesting that when he stood up and 
spoke on the Senate floor and said 
things that were absolutely false, that 
he did so knowingly and maliciously. I 
would certainly give the Senator from 
Illinois the benefit of the doubt that he 
was in error rather than deliberately 
misstating facts, but the facts are now 
clear. 
We have a rule in this body, rule XIX, 
to reprimand any Senator who imputes 
the character or integrity of another 
Senator. I am not going to seek refuge 
in that rule, although I think there is 
an argument that I could. But I will 
say this, that once the facts have been 
made clear, I hope my friend from Illi-
nois will show the same principle 
Newsweek showed—to apologize, to say 
he was wrong and he is sorry for call-
ing me a liar on the Senate floor and 
then going to Twitter to do so twice. 
That would be the right thing to do, to 
acknowledge an error when it occurred. 
The Senator from Illinois’ statement 
that no illegal immigrants will receive 
checks under this bill is categorically 
false. 
For that reason, as if in legislative 
session, I ask unanimous consent that 
the Senate proceed to immediate con-
sideration of S. 842, introduced earlier 
today. I further ask that the bill be 
considered read a third time and passed 
and that the motion to reconsider be 
considered made and laid upon the 
table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to 
object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Illinois. 
Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the ex-
change which took place between my-
self and the junior Senator from Texas 
has been analyzed from many different 
directions. The conclusion of CNN 
based on what he said on the floor and 
I responded to is as follows: 
Cruz said ‘‘every illegal alien in America’’ 
would get a $1,400 check. Durbin responded 
that Cruz’s statement is ‘‘just plain false’’ 
because, he said, ‘‘Undocumented immi-
grants do not have Social Security numbers, 
and they do not qualify for stimulus relief 
checks, period.’’ 
According to CNN: 
They were both wrong. Cruz was inac-
curate when he said ‘‘every’’ undocumented 
immigrant will get a $1,400 relief check. 
Then they go on to say there are peo-
ple, a discrete class of people, who 
might have a Social Security number, 
be undocumented, and receive a check. 
And because of the clarification and 
my own investigation afterwards, I will 
concede their point. I overstated my 
case. 
Here is what it boils down to. In this 
situation, people have applied for a 
work visa—not a tourist visa, a work 
visa to come to the United States. Be-
cause of that work visa, they also re-
ceived a Social Security number. Then 
they overstayed their visas and still 
could continue—could possibly con-
tinue—to be on the rolls with their So-
cial Security number and receive a 
check. 
I might quickly add, this was a provi-
sion that was included in both of the 
relief bills for COVID–19 signed into 
law by President Trump, one of which 
the Senator from Texas voted for, one 
of which he did not. 
So I would ask, how many people are 
we talking about? Ten? A hundred? A 
thousand? Ten thousand? I can’t find 
out. They can’t give me the number be-
cause there isn’t a calculation. 
So here is the situation. You had to 
apply for a work visa, be granted the 
work visa and come to the United 
States, get a Social Security number, 
overstay your visa, and then continue 
to file income tax returns because that 
is the only way you could qualify for 
help through these relief packages. 
I don’t know if that group is ten or a 
hundred or a thousand, but I have care-
fully read the provisions that are of-
fered by the Senator from Texas today, 
and I will tell you he basically says to 
the American Government, when it 
comes to cash payments: Stop the 
presses. Stop the presses. I want to 
know who these people are, and I don’t 
want you to send them a check. 
I don’t believe that is reasonable. We 
have sent out 90 million checks. To 
stop this while we go through this de-
bate is, I think, unfair. 
I don’t want these checks to go to 
people who do not qualify for them any 
more than he does, but I am not going 
to stop the issuance of checks to people 
living in Texas or Illinois in the mean-
time. I object. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objec-
tion is heard. 
Mr. CRUZ. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Texas. 
Mr. CRUZ. I would note several 
things. No. 1, the Senator from Illinois 
said he didn’t know if the number of il-
legal immigrants getting checks from 
the Democrats’ stimulus bill was in the 
tens or the hundreds or the thousands. 
With all due respect, he does know 
that. It is not in the tens. It is not in 
the hundreds. It is not in the thou-
sands. JCT, the Joint Committee on 
Taxation, which is a nonpartisan orga-
nization that reports to this Senate 
and this Congress, scored my amend-
ment as roughly 482,000 illegal immi-
grants are getting checks under the 
Democrats’ proposal. Two outside orga-
nizations have scored it as millions of 
illegal immigrants. 
I would note what Newsweek said, 
when they corrected their fact-check, 
and I am going to read a quote: 
The Ruling. True. Cruz’s claim that mil-
lions of illegal immigrants would receive 
stimulus payments is true, given the amount 
of people who have overstayed their visas 
over the years. Once they overstay, they 
technically are considered ‘‘illegal.’’ 
Nowhere in the Senator from Illinois’ 
remarks was a word of apology for

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1635 
March 18, 2021 
falsely calling me a liar on the floor of 
this Senate and on Twitter. That is un-
fortunate. 
What the Senator said right now is 
also incorrect. The Senator from Illi-
nois said this amendment would halt 
the payments that are going out. This 
amendment doesn’t do anything of the 
sort. This amendment restricts sending 
payments to people who are here ille-
gally. When the Senator from Illinois 
said he would love to do that, with all 
due respect, that doesn’t withstand 
even the slightest bit of scrutiny be-
cause if he would love to do that, all he 
had to do was not object, and the 
American citizens, the people who are 
here legally, would all get their $1,400 
checks, would get them on the exact 
same timeframe, but those here ille-
gally would not. 
Today’s Democratic Party supports 
sending checks to millions of illegal 
immigrants. They have justified it, as 
the Senator from Illinois did, by falsely 
claiming none of them are getting 
checks. Those are not the facts, as the 
Newsweek fact-check makes clear. 
I would note that a bill that Demo-
cratic Senators are trying to push, de-
nominated H.R. 1, what many are call-
ing the corrupt politicians act, would 
compound that by allowing millions of 
illegal immigrants to be registered to 
vote and, no doubt, to cast votes. 
This is a political decision that is far 
outside the mainstream. It is unfortu-
nate, but sadly it reflects where to-
day’s Democratic Party is. 
I yield the floor.

REMEMBERING ROBERT GUTZ THOMPSON 
Mr. MANCHIN. Mr. President, I rise 
to honor the life of a noble veteran, a 
beloved husband, father, grandfather, 
friend, brother, uncle, and someone I 
had been fortunate enough to call my 
dear 
brother-in-law, 
Robert 
Gutz 
Thompson. 
What I always admired about Bob 
was his unparalleled work ethic and de-
termination to learn and serve and to 
inspire those around him. Bob was a 
graduate of the University of Wyo-
ming, Class of 1961. He then joined the 
military and entered flight training in 
1963, and he was designated as a naval 
aviator in 1964. From the day he was 
motivated to join the military to his 
military retirement in 1983, he show-
cased steadfast dedication and a com-
mitment to excellence that can only be 
matched by his loving devotion as part 
of our family. 
Bob proudly served our Nation for 
more than 20 years and leaves behind a 
distinguished legacy of military his-
tory, including service aboard the USS 
Intrepid, the USS Randolph, the USS 
Lexington, and the USS Forrestal. He 
flew thousands of flight hours through-
out his distinguished career. He trained 
other pilots. He commanded naval 
units, and he was deployed multiple 
times, including to the North Atlantic, 
the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, and 
the Arctic Circle. He earned the Navy 
Achievement Medal for his perform-
ance as Landing Signal Officer during a 
winter deployment to the North Atlan-
tic. 
In 1967, he joined the VS–30 squadron 
and reported to Key West, FL, as an in-
structor pilot. In 1970, he was awarded 
the Navy Commendation Medal for re-
covering aircraft within the Arctic Cir-
cle. In 1972, Bob was selected for and 
attended the Naval War College in 
Rhode Island and then was assigned to 
the Naval Air Station Cecil Field, in 
Florida, to lead the squadron’s reloca-
tion operations. 
In 1976, he served aboard the USS 
Forrestal as operations officer. In 1979, 
Bob assumed command of the VS–30 
squadron, where he deployed with his 
beloved Diamondcutters to the Medi-
terranean. Later that year, Bob re-
ceived orders to the Pentagon to work 
on what is now known as GPS. His as-
signments were tough—squadron exec-
utive officer, squadron commander, in-
structor pilot, and so many more—but 
he was always tougher than they were. 
It is unbelievable the leader he was to 
all of those who served and served with 
pride. 
Put simply, Bob was one of the most 
generous, kind, hard-working, and in-
spirational people I ever knew. My 
whole family and I adored Bob ever 
since he joined the family, and Bob’s 
passing has left a deep impact on all of 
us. This is also an important time to 
celebrate Bob’s life and the profound 
feelings of joy and pride that he 
brought to all of us. 
While Bob wasn’t born in West Vir-
ginia, he certainly was a Mountaineer, 
through and through, in his heart and 
soul and was a dedicated fan of his be-
loved WVU sports teams, especially 
football and basketball. 
When visitors come to our little 
State, I jump at the chance to tell 
them we are home to the most hard- 
working and patriotic people in the Na-
tion. We have fought in more wars; we 
have shed more blood; and lost more 
lives for the cause of freedom than 
most any other State. We have always 
done the heavy lifting, and no one has 
ever complained. 
We have mined the coal, forged the 
steel that built the guns and ships and 
factories that have protected and con-
tinue to protect our country to this 
day. 
I am so deeply proud of what West 
Virginians like my brother-in-law Bob 
Thompson have accomplished and what 
they will continue to accomplish to 
protect the freedoms that we all take 
for granted and hold so dear. 
We have every reason to be proud and 
to stand tall knowing that West Vir-
ginia is the reason Americans sleep 
peacefully at night. It is because of all 
of our veterans, past and present, that 
we can proudly proclaim ‘‘Mountain-
eers Are Always Free,’’ and we are all 
so very, very proud of our Bob for being 
a vital part of our legacy. 
What is most important is that he 
lived a full life, surrounded by his loved 
ones. I extend all of our condolences to

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
FOR THE PEOPLE ACT OF 2021 
Mr. BLUNT. Mr. President, I want to 
join my fellow Senators in remem-
bering Senator MANCHIN’s family, his 
sister, and the rest of his family as 
they deal with the loss of his brother- 
in-law. 
I want to talk today about a draft I 
just received—a bill we are actually 
going to have a hearing on next week— 
S. 1, the so-called For the People Act. 
This bill is the companion act to the 
House version of H.R. 1. I actually 
think it is even longer than H.R. 1, 
which I would have thought impossible. 
It is over 800 pages. I think they will be 
introducing the final version in the 
next day or so, and that is a good 
thing, since we are supposed to have a 
hearing on it in the middle of next 
week. 
It packs a lot of what I consider bad 
changes relating to election adminis-
tration, 
campaign 
finance, 
redis-
tricting, and so much more into those 
800 pages, but there is a lot of space 
there to pack things in. 
I would have to take a lot more time 
than I have got today to talk about all 
the things in the bill that I have had 
concerns about, but I would say, to 
start with, this idea that one size fits 
all, this Federal takeover of elections, 
can’t be in the interest of voters in our 
country. 
It would force a single and, I believe, 
a partisan view of elections and how 
they should be run in 10,000 different 
jurisdictions in the country. I don’t 
know how you do that. I don’t know 
how you take 10,000 jurisdictions and 
try, at the Washington, DC, level in 
legislation, to determine changes like 
how they would register voters. Every 
State, under this bill, would do it ex-
actly the same way—which voting sys-
tems they would use; how they would 
handle early voting and absentee bal-
lots, no matter how long they had been 
doing it one way that worked for vot-
ers in their State; and how they main-
tain their voter list, whether you can 
go in and verify whether people on the 
voter list were still there. 
We used to think that was a criti-
cally important protection in the elec-
tion system; that you knew that the 
voters that had registered to vote in a 
jurisdiction actually were still in that 
jurisdiction. It was actually, in every 
State, a bragging point of responsible 
election administration. That would 
largely go away in this bill. 
This bill would require States to 
make ballot drop boxes available for 45 
days prior to the Federal election. 
Those are boxes that—it even des-
ignates the locations and tells the local 
jurisdiction how they need to handle 
those ballots as they come out of the 
boxes and would be processed. 
Remember, these are not mailboxes. 
They would be the ballot drop boxes all 
over the jurisdiction, if you could find 
one. 
It would mandate unlimited ballot 
harvesting. That is a process where one 
person could collect and submit as 
many ballots as they could collect and 
submit. You know, in recent elections, 
we have seen ballot harvesting as a 
real problem in these elections. Not 
only does one person have your ballot 
and get that ballot to where it should 
be, frankly, one of the problems always 
with ballot harvesting is maybe a per-
son who knows voters pretty well 
would collect 20 and put 18 in the mail-
box or take 18 to the vote counting 
area and the other two just somehow 
don’t get there. 
Unlimited ballot harvesting, prohib-
ited in many States—and, in fact, in 
recent years the Democratic House of 
Representatives failed to seat an elect-
ed Representative in North Carolina 
because that person had used ballot 
harvesting. 
The bill would require States to 
allow felons to vote in Federal elec-
tions. If you didn’t like that, in this 
case, you could have two sets of voter 
registrations, one for Federal elections 
and one for all other elections. 
And, by the way, if you did that, you 
would also have to have two different 
sets of ballots for an election day that 
had both local and State and Federal 
issues on the ballot. 
And this bill would require that all of 
these changes be made quickly. Even 
jurisdictions 
that 
recently 
have 
changed their processes and spent a lot 
of time talking to people about those 
changes over maybe 2 years or 4 years 
would suddenly be told, no, you have to 
change them one more time. And 
maybe it is a day here or a day there, 
but that makes a big difference if you 
have already got in your mind how far 
before an election you have to register 
to vote or transfer your address or 
things that election administrators 
work on all the time. 
You know, my first elected job was 
as the county clerk in Greene County, 
Springfield, MO, where I was the chief 
election authority. We had a county of 
about 180,000 people in it, lots of reg-
istered voters, but you had to take that 
very seriously. 
And later I was the chief election au-
thority in our State for 8 years as the 
secretary of state, and I know how 
much planning goes into the elections. 
I know how seriously local officials 
take it. 
I also know how difficult it could be 
if every change you made had to be 
cleared some way with somebody in 
Washington, DC. 
You know, States can often take 
years to transition to a new ballot sys-
tem or transition to a new way they do 
things. They also can do it very quick-
ly if they need to, and we saw that hap-
pen in a number of States last year. 
I think this bill, if it did pass, really 
doesn’t allow the time you need for 
planning. 
The diversity of our election system 
is one of the great strengths of our sys-
tem. There is bipartisan agreement on 
that. I have quoted President Obama 
on this before, but he said in 2016: 
‘‘There is no serious person out there 
who would suggest somehow that you 
can even rig America’s elections, in 
part, because they are so decentralized 
and the numbers of votes involved.’’ 
This bill would undo that decentral-
ized strength. It would undo that local 
and State responsibility for having 
laws that voters who vote for you un-
derstand you need to apply in the fair-
est and best way you can. The bill 
would make our system less diverse, 
less secure. 
Unfortunately, this bill doesn’t just 
stop at election administration. It 
takes the campaign finance system and 
changes it dramatically. 
You know, when the Federal Elec-
tions Commission was created in the 
early 1970s, it was a six-member Com-
mission. It was to be bipartisan. This 
turns it into a five-member Commis-
sion, with whoever is the President 
being able to appoint the third member 
on one side to always outvote, if they 
need to, the two members on the other 
side. 
There have been many times, obvi-
ously, in the history of the Federal 
Election Commission when the vote 
has been 3 to 3 or 2 to 2, whatever the 
makeup was at the time. This would do 
away with that and basically turn the 
Commission from a bipartisan Commis-
sion into a prosecutorial body, where 
one side always has the majority if 
they want it. I think voters should and 
would be very concerned about that. 
It would allow the Chair of the FEC 
to make key staffing changes. It would 
allow judges to review cases, even when 
the Commission found no violation of 
the law. 
In addition, the bill would create a 
system of public financing for political 
campaigns by matching certain con-
tributions with Federal dollars. The 
match would be 6 to 1. So in the match-
able, low-dollar—whatever you define 
that to be—contributions, if you raise 
$100,000 of those contributions, you 
would have $700,000. Six hundred thou-
sand of those dollars could have been 
used by the Federal Government for 
other things rather than to finance 
politicians in a campaign. 
Now, I understand why politicians 
would like that. I have raised as much 
money as most people in this body 
have raised, and, you know, the idea

that just the Federal Government 
would come in at some point and give 
me $6 for some percentage of those that 
I raised might be pretty appealing, but 
I think it would be wrong. 
It takes jurisdiction away from the 
States into how to draw congressional 
districts. Now, this is going to be in-
convenient if it passes because the Con-
stitution specifically says the State 
legislatures decide how to draw a con-
gressional district. It doesn’t say the 
Congress of the United States tells the 
State legislatures how to draw congres-
sional districts, but this bill would do 
that. 
The bill requires redistricting com-
missions. It dictates who would serve 
on the commissions. It sets the criteria 
and the procedures for how you draw 
the maps. It lays out how the commis-
sions have to take public input. 
And if that weren’t bad enough—it 
doesn’t stop there—it even determines 
which courts act on all redistricting 
cases. And this would be a dramatic 
change where, again, you have a one- 
size-fits-all system in a country that 
clearly is not a one-size-fits-all coun-
try. 
Since very few States currently have 
commissions like that, it would set a 
lot of deadlines that we don’t currently 
have. Districts drawn using 2020 census 
data would all but be guaranteed to be 
drawn by Federal courts just because 
of the time that this bill sets out. 
But the Federal court drawing the 
district isn’t the big problem. The big 
problem is forever you have changed 
this and forever you have put the DC 
Circuit as the ultimate circuit to de-
termine all redistricting cases. We 
have never thought that power be-
longed in Washington, DC, before, but 
this bill does. 
It is an unprecedented power grab by 
the Federal Government at the expense 
of the States. I think it is a trans-
parent attempt to stack elections in 
favor of one party. Election law should 
not be about a single party. 
If this bill were to pass, it would do 
nothing, in my view, to bolster public 
confidence in elections. In fact, I sus-
pect most election officials around the 
country would begin to say: I would 
like to be able to do something about 
that problem, but we will have to clear 
that with Washington, DC, first. 
I think the divisions in the country 
would be worse, not better. Successful 
election laws are passed on a bipartisan 
basis. We did that with the Help Amer-
ica Vote Act after 2000. We provided as-
sistance and some direction with the fi-
nances, but we didn’t change a single 
State law after 2016. We left that up to 
the States. We created bipartisan im-
pact when we did that. 
We 
should 
continue 
to 
put 
the 
strength and the security of the coun-
try’s elections before party. We should 
continue to oppose the efforts of a sin-
gle party to make sweeping partisan 
changes in our election system. I don’t 
talk to anybody who doesn’t think that 
this bill, as a similar bill passed the 
House, would pass the House on a pure-
ly partisan basis. That would be a bad 
idea. 
I encourage my colleagues to look 
carefully at S. 1, and I think if you do, 
a majority of the Senate will not sup-
port this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa is recognized. 
FOREIGN THREAT ASSESSMENT REPORT 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, on 
March 6 of this year, the intelligence 
community issued its ‘‘Intelligence 
Community Assessment on Foreign 
Threats to the 2020 U.S. Federal Elec-
tions.’’ Based on that report, some in 
the liberal media have falsely claimed 
that my and Senator JOHNSON’s Hunter 
Biden-related oversight activity last 
Congress 
was 
based 
on 
Russian 
disinformation. Even Peter Strzok felt 
the need to chime in on Twitter to say 
that 
we 
received 
Russian 
disinformation. 
I don’t know how many times I have 
to say it, but such claims are false and 
misleading. To be precise, Senator 
JOHNSON and I didn’t receive, solicit, or 
rely upon any information from Andrii 
Derkach, and we publicly said so many 
times. 
I don’t know how many times last 
fall I was on this floor of the U.S. Sen-
ate trying to explain that to the people 
who were making those accusations. It 
seems like Strzok pays just about as 
careful attention to these facts as he 
did to the Crossfire FISA applications. 
Of 
course, 
Twitter 
lets 
disinformation about the Steele dossier 
run wild on their platform yet shuts 
down still unrefuted reporting on Hun-
ter Biden before the 2020 election. In 
other words, we have a double stand-
ard. 
Now, 
regarding 
Russian 
disinformation, 
it 
wasn’t 
Senator 
JOHNSON and this Senator that dealt in 
it. It happens to be very clear that the 
other side, the Democrats, were dealing 
with it. Here’s one quick example. If 
you want more, then I would refer you 
to section 10 of our September 23, 2020, 
report. 
On July 13, 2020, then-Minority Lead-
er SCHUMER, Senator WARNER, Speaker 
PELOSI, and Representative SCHIFF sent 
a letter with a classified attachment to 
the FBI to express a purported belief 
that Congress was the subject of a for-
eign disinformation campaign. 
The classified attachment to that 
letter included unclassified elements 
that attempted, but failed, to tie our 
work to Derkach. Those unclassified 
elements were leaked to the press to 
support a false campaign accusing us 
two 
Senators 
of 
using 
Russian 
disinformation. 
Then, during the course of our inves-
tigation, we ran a transcribed inter-
view of George Kent. Before that inter-
view, 
the 
Democrats 
acquired 
Derkach’s 
materials. 
During 
that 
interview, they asked the witness 
about it. He stated: ‘‘What you’re ask-
ing me to interpret is a master chart of 
disinformation and malign influence.’’ 
At that interview, the Democrats in-
troduced known disinformation into 
the investigative record as an exhibit. 
More precisely, the Democrats relied 
upon 
and 
disseminated 
known 
disinformation from a foreign source 
whom 
the 
intelligence 
community 
warned was actively seeking to influ-
ence U.S. politics. Yet now—can you 
believe this?—they accuse this Senator 
and Senator JOHNSON
of doing that 
very thing. Now let that sink in be-
cause there is a case of double standard 
around here. 
It is clear that the Democrats hope 
that their self-created disinformation 
campaign would drown out our report 
and its findings to protect Candidate 
Biden from the facts. Now that Presi-
dent Biden is in office, the facts aren’t 
going anywhere. 
I had an opportunity to serve 28 years 
in the Senate with Senator Biden. I 
liked him then; I still like him. But 
that doesn’t mean that I like the dou-
ble standard the press has toward 
President Biden and us Republicans. 
As President Biden gears up for his 
first press conference, he ought to an-
swer for the fact that his family was 
and possibly still is financially con-
nected to Chinese nationals with links 
to the Communist Party and the Peo-
ple’s Liberation Army. Indeed, Hunter 
Biden reportedly admitted that he was 
well aware that some of his business 
associates were connected to the Com-
munist 
Chinese 
Government 
intel-
ligence services. Now, double stand-
ard—where is the media in asking seri-
ous questions about that? 
It has also been reported that emails 
show Joe Biden and his brother were 
‘‘office mates’’ with the very same Chi-
nese nationals with links to the Com-
munist regime and the its military. 
Now, talk about a double standard. 
Where is the media in asking serious 
questions about that? Yet they are re-
porting this very day about things that 
Johnson 
and 
Grassley 
did 
about 
disinformation, which I have told you 
so many times we never received. 
Now there is this interview on tele-
vision with Tony Bobulinski, publicly 
stating that Joe Biden was aware of 
and possibly involved in Hunter Biden’s 
business deals. Talk about a double 
standard. Where is the media asking 
serious questions about that? 
The Biden family transactions and 
associations in our September 20 report 
raised criminal, counterintelligence, 
and 
extortion 
concerns. 
Yet 
the 
media—the liberal media—has ignored 
all of it and has failed to ask any le-
gitimate questions. Don’t you think 
that we the people have a right to 
know the answers? 
The media certainly seemed to think 
so in all the doings of the Trump ad-
ministration. If the story I just laid 
out here were about Trump, I guar-
antee you that it would be all over the 
news. 
It is perfectly legitimate and reason-
able for Congress and the news media 
to question the Biden administration

about these global financial trans-
actions and associations. It is perfectly 
legitimate to ask how they could im-
pact the Biden administration’s foreign 
policy. That is especially true as it re-
lates to China, given the extensive 
links between the Biden family and 
that country. Let’s see if anyone dares 
to ask questions at the President’s 
first news conference. 
NATIONAL SECURITY 
Mr. President, on another subject, I 
want to discuss the national security 
threats facing our country. 
A recent poll showed 45 percent of 
Americans acknowledge that China is 
the greatest threat to the United 
States. A year ago, that percentage 
was half that number thinking that 
China was a threat, the greatest threat 
to the United States. 
Frankly, this year, no other nation 
came close to what they think about 
China being a threat—not Russia, not 
North Korea, not Iran. These were all 
far behind. 
Half of Americans believe China is 
the world’s leading economic power. A 
record 63 percent say that the eco-
nomic power of China is a critical 
threat to the United States. 
Now, we all know the American peo-
ple are smart. They are perceiving ex-
actly what is happening with the 
United States vis-a-vis China or China 
vis-a-vis the rest of the world. China 
wants to supplant our country as the 
greatest nation and the greatest econ-
omy in the world, and China will do it 
if we are blind to that danger. 
Everywhere I see the threat of Chi-
na’s rise minimized. On Tuesday, I saw 
a very curious thing in the declassified 
‘‘Intelligence Community Assessment 
of Foreign Threats to the 2020 U.S. 
Elections.’’ The intelligence commu-
nity determined that China did not en-
gage in pervasive election meddling 
but noted that was in part because 
China saw the risk associated with 
doing so. 
The intelligence community deter-
mined that China would not be excited 
if President Trump had won the 2020 
election because he would ‘‘challenge 
China’s rise.’’ 
The National Intelligence Officer for 
Cyber Issues, in particular, found that 
the 
Government 
of 
China 
wanted 
former President Trump to be defeated 
in the general election, preferring ‘‘the 
election of a more predictable member 
of the establishment instead.’’ And 
‘‘China took at least some steps to un-
dermine former President Trump’s re-
election chances, primarily through so-
cial media and official public state-
ments and media.’’ 
Yet some in the news media read this 
very same report that I read and de-
clared triumphantly and falsely that 
there was nothing to fear from China 
in terms of influencing our elections. It 
is pretty clear why China would not 
want a President unafraid to assert 
American 
national 
interests. 
That 
means demanding reciprocal trade, se-
cure borders, and a defense policy fo-
cused on American national interests. 
We all know that China has been 
playing us for suckers. China continues 
to try to expand its influence globally, 
including in international bodies like 
the World Bank and the World Health 
Organization. It doesn’t seek to play by 
the rules but to exploit its influence 
for its own advantage at the expense of 
the United States and probably any 
free country because they don’t like 
democracy. 
In this same assessment I saw that 
Iran, another enemy, also wanted to 
defeat a strong American President 
and sow division. Many others—Leba-
nese Hezbollah, the Government of 
Cuba, and the Maduro Government of 
Venezuela—they all had the very same 
idea. They all wanted to defeat Presi-
dent Trump. Only Russia seems to have 
preferred Trump but just according to 
that assessment—although I remember 
reading a year ago during the pri-
maries that Senator BERNIE SANDERS 
was also a favorite of Russia. He had to 
have a defensive briefing, meaning Sen-
ator SANDERS, because Russia wanted 
to help his campaign. 
Also, remember, it was then-Vice 
President Biden who first announced 
the 
naive 
and 
disastrous 
Obama 
‘‘reset’’ appeasement policy toward 
Russia. This, coming in the wake of 
Russia’s invasion of our ally, Georgia, 
arguably gave Putin the idea that he 
could get away with invading Crimea 
and Ukraine. 
Let’s also take this moment to recall 
that when the Obama Justice Depart-
ment and the FBI saw threats from 
Russia during the 2016 election, they 
didn’t do what they did for SANDERS. 
They didn’t defensively brief Trump 
and his team. Instead, do you know 
where they went? They opened Cross-
fire Hurricane and outrageously used 
briefings to Trump and his associates 
as intelligence gathering operations, 
ultimately wasting years of taxpayer 
money and time. 
Abraham Lincoln once said: 
America will never be destroyed from the 
outside. If we lose our freedoms it will be be-
cause we have destroyed ourselves from 
within. 
In fact, the goal of what the KGB 
calls 
‘‘active 
measures,’’ 
like 
disinformation since Soviet times, has 
been to pit Americans against each 
other to cause us to destroy ourselves. 
That brings me to another related 
point. As I see this seat of democracy 
fortified with walls and barbed wire 
while the people, the citizens, and the 
taxpayers are kept out, I can’t help but 
think about where we will go from 
here. 
Yet the Democrats can only speak of 
destroying the filibuster during these 
difficult times. When I hear talk of de-
stroying the filibuster—the very tools 
that force bipartisanship and ensure 
that those representing all Americans 
are heard and that America act as one 
being abolished forever—I am worried. 
If the slimmest of majorities is about 
to impose its will on the other half of 
the country from inside an armed 
bunker, 
the 
Russians 
will 
have 
achieved their ultimate goal. 
We are not our own enemies to be si-
lenced and to be fenced in. We are one 
Nation, but we must pull together and 
acknowledge what it means when coun-
tries like China and Iran, our enemies 
and our adversaries, don’t want us to 
put our country’s interest first. 
FREE SPEECH 
Mr. President, then, on my last 
point, I want to bring up another few 
remarks on the First Amendment, as I 
have spoken a couple of times before 
very recently. 
I have come to the floor over the last 
few weeks to talk about the First 
Amendment, one of America’s most 
cherished pillars of freedom. Unfortu-
nately, in recent years, we have seen a 
corrosive culture undermining sacred 
civic freedoms Americans risk taking 
for granted. Too often we don’t think 
about the freedoms we have because we 
were born here. 
We can learn a lot from immigrants 
that come to this country and appre-
ciate Americans for our freedoms. 
Whenever I go to these citizenship 
ceremonies we have for immigrants, I 
always tell them: I wish you would 
tell—when you hear some American 
complaining about what is wrong with 
America, I hope you know from your 
experience in other lands that you 
came here for freedom. Remind us of 
how lucky we are to have what we were 
born into. 
Silencing the free exchange of ideas 
has infiltrated college campuses and 
even the American workplace. It has 
even affected journalism, traditional 
media, and all across our social media 
platforms. We all know that not all 
speech 
is 
protected 
by 
the 
First 
Amendment and, occasionally, we in 
the United States fall into a discussion 
about the technical boundaries of the 
First Amendment when we talk about 
the meaning and the merits of free 
speech. 
Now, the health of our democracy de-
pends on free speech to foster an in-
formed public, something that I think 
Thomas Jefferson made very clear. If 
democracy is going to work, it is going 
to have to work with an educated pub-
lic. The rigorous exchange of ideas in-
form debate on issues affecting our 
lives and enables individuals to chal-
lenge power and also to challenge or-
thodoxy. 
In theory, the institutions of the 
‘‘fourth estate’’ should be the staunch-
est defenders of the First Amendment. 
I think I said it before, but you can’t 
say it too often—and there is probably 
a 100 different ways you can say it—but 
I always like to say that journalists 
are the police of our constitutional sys-
tem to make sure that everybody and 
all follow the rule of law. What they 
bring to the people of this country 
about how our government functions 
makes everything very transparent, 
and when things are transparent, you 
have accountability. 
So as I think about these things, it 
has been baffling to watch over the last

March 18, 2021 
year as some editors and executives, 
even at storied institutions, crumble 
under pressure to police speech, to con-
form to orthodoxy, and to stifle the ex-
change of ideas instead of what they 
should be doing, promoting the contest 
of these ideas—in other words, speech, 
orthodoxy, and exchange of ideas— 
when they are under attack. 
It is now old news, but, last summer, 
a long-time opinion editor of the New 
York Times was pushed out of his posi-
tion. For what? For having the audac-
ity to publish an opinion piece written 
by Senator TOM COTTON. Apparently, a 
group of readers and employees found 
Senator COTTON’s ideas so upsetting as 
to warrant the removal of the editor 
who had the guts to publish them. The 
paper also issued a several-hundred- 
word editor’s note even expressing re-
gret for publishing the piece in the 
first place. 
If those readers and employees at the 
Times disagreed so strongly, the public 
could have learned something by pub-
lishing a counter-argument instead of 
reading about their regret. I, myself, 
have publicly disagreed with Senator 
COTTON about a policy idea or two, and 
I make my points here on the Senate 
floor. I don’t ask for Senator COTTON’s 
resignation, like they had to expunge 
his or give all sorts of excuses why 
they published that and they shouldn’t 
have published it. 
Instead, what do we have? We had ex-
ecutives at a paper of record scapegoat 
a colleague for failing to confirm to 
some yet unexplained orthodoxy versus 
a rational decision to engage in public 
debate on their pages. 
In January, POLITICO invited a slate 
of individuals to guest-edit their wide-
ly 
read 
newsletter, 
‘‘Playbook.’’ 
Among those guest editors was Ben 
Shapiro, a conservative commentator. 
His name alone was enough to spark a 
backlash among staffers and even out-
side commentators. To their credit, the 
editors of POLITICO did not apologize. 
But according to the Washington 
Post media writer, some POLITICO 
employees who privately supported the 
choice 
to 
publish 
Shapiro 
were 
‘‘afraid’’ to speak up on staff calls, 
fearing backlash among colleagues. 
Now, that is only two episodes I give 
you, but these episodes represent a 
very unhealthy environment where too 
many think it is prudent to give voice 
to those with whom they agree or 
whose views are deemed acceptable. 
While the editors did the right thing 
at one outlet, they didn’t at the other. 
Either way, it probably means that 
they will be more selective about what 
is acceptable—what is acceptable—in 
the future as we do the businesses of 
our newspapers. 
Now, when you worry about what is 
acceptable, it certainly doesn’t serve 
those principles that I mentioned ear-
lier that ought to be encouraging dia-
logue, dispute, learning from each 
other, and educating each other. Now, 
these may be fairly obscure controver-
sies I just gave you, but they are indic-
ative of a yet wider problem. 
Expectations of acceptability and a 
preference for unchallenged ideas—this 
all chips away at the most sacred civic 
freedoms in America. No one learns 
more by less debate. Neglecting to de-
fend free speech and champion the free 
exchange of ideas creates a pathway for 
censorship. Democracy doesn’t thrive 
on censorship. 
The institutions of the news media 
ought to defend the fundamental prin-
ciples behind free speech and free press 
at the top of their lungs. The First 
Amendment is the oxygen of their own 
existence. 
If they were doing their work, there 
shouldn’t have to be a single Senator 
here in the U.S. Senate giving speeches 
about why they don’t want more free 
speech and why they want less free 
speech. 
Last fall, the New York Post had a 
story censored on Twitter a short time 
before the election. Regardless of what 
one thinks about the content of that 
story, the methods of reporting, or 
even the tone of the writing, the sup-
pression 
of 
information 
like 
that 
should alarm both news writers and 
news consumers. They ought to be 
more a protector of freedom of speech 
and freedom of press than a Senator 
here on the U.S. Senate talking about 
it. 
Many outlets went to work fact- 
checking or reporting on the topic in 
their own way. That is all well and 
good. It is their job. But the public 
conversation about the censorship de-
volved into a question of whether Twit-
ter had the legal ability to do what it 
did instead of a discussion of whether 
it was the right thing to do, because it 
wasn’t right. Even Twitter’s CEO sees 
that now. 
However, there were no fiery defenses 
of free speech and free press from the 
mainstream outlets, and those main-
stream outlets ought to be the ones 
talking more about freedom of speech 
and freedom of press than having Sen-
ators on the floor of the U.S. Senate 
bring it up and say: Why aren’t you 
doing your job? Why aren’t you prac-
ticing your profession as it ought to 
be? Why aren’t you being the police-
men of the system the way you ought 
to be? 
Not even media with caveats were re-
porting about that Twitter event that I 
just spoke about. This was a perfect op-
portunity for journalistic institutions 
to weigh in, and they should have 
weighed in. They have a dog in the 
fight. It should be the bread-and-butter 
issues for every editorial board across 
the country—not just the editorial 
board but the reporters. The lack of 
this kind of pro-free press and pro-free 
speech advocacy also contributes to 
the unhealthy environment that shuns 
debate and silences dissent. 
So what will be the consequences of a 
media environment where conformity 
and comfort take precedent over the 
free exchange of ideas? The first and 
most obvious is a less rigorous and less 
informed public discourse and the citi-
zens less informed. Opinions and pref-
erences, especially on matters of public 
interest, are always improved after 
being challenged. 
If you disagree with the New York 
Times’ editorial board or a pundit for 
FOX News, that is fine. 
It would be better if the public heard 
all about it. Broader discussions mean 
broader 
understanding. 
Without 
a 
broad, vigorous public debate, we lose 
empathy that results from engaging 
with somebody else’s ideas. 
In these divisive times in society, 
empathy is in low supply. The last 
thing that we lose in a media environ-
ment ruled by compliance and con-
formity is the grand American tradi-
tion of dissent. 
Free speech and free press have cen-
turies-long history in America, from 
Thomas 
Paine’s 
pamphlets 
to 
the 
tweets spreading across the land this 
very minute, the revolutionary contest 
of ideas might take a different shape 
but remain critical to our civic culture 
and the continued growth of our Na-
tion and the strengthening of our de-
mocracy. 
I hope more institutions in the 
‘‘fourth estate’’ will take an aggressive 
approach advocating free speech. 
Now, I wasn’t around when Thomas 
Paine published ‘‘Common Sense,’’ but 
history and my own experience teaches 
me two important lessons: The free ex-
change of ideas strengthens representa-
tive government and will, then, help 
preserve our democratic Republic for 
generations to come. And that is what 
this generation should be all about, 
making it better for the next genera-
tion, both from the standpoint of the 
economy but also for an understanding 
of our democratic institutions. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1640 
March 18, 2021 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read the nominations of William Jo-
seph Burns, of Maryland, to be Director 
of the Central Intelligence Agency; and 
Brian P. McKeon, of the District of Co-
lumbia, to be Deputy Secretary of 
State for Management and Resources. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the nominations 
en bloc. 
Mr. SCOTT of Florida. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise in opposition to the nomi-
nation of William Burns to be Director 
of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
Communist China is the biggest 
threat our Nation faces. General Sec-
retary Xi will stop at nothing in his 
quest for world domination and has 
made clear that he seeks to push the 
United States out of the Indo-Pacific 
and weaken and intimidate his neigh-
bors, including our allies. Communist 
China continues to threaten to take 
Taiwan by force. 
Communist China is committing a 
genocide against the Uoghurs and 
stripping Hong kongers of their basic 
rights. China sees the United States as 
its global adversary and is taking the 
steps necessary to ‘‘win’’ the great 
power conflict of the 21st century. 
China is taking every opportunity it 
can around the world to gain influence 
and exert control. 
I am concerned that some past state-
ments and actions by Ambassador 
Burns indicate an inaccurate view of 
Communist China and the danger it 
poses to our Nation and to Americans. 
Any U.S. official who thinks that 
China can play a positive role in the 
world, particularly among developing 
states or as a contributor to peace and 
stability, 
is 
mistaken. 
Ambassador 
Burns has not shown that he under-
stands the threat that Communist 
China represents. 
I am also troubled that Ambassador 
Burns’ view of Castro’s Communist re-
gime in Cuba is equally flawed. I can-
not support anyone who backed the 
failed Obama-Biden appeasement poli-
cies, which did nothing to help the 
Cuban people and allowed Havana to 
extend its reach and expand its control, 
giving power to other ruthless dicta-
torships in Latin America. 
My opposition to Ambassador Burns’ 
nomination is grounded in our fun-
damentally different views. Ambas-
sador Burns has not demonstrated that 
he understands the threats we face 
around the world and the causes of 
those threats. We need leaders who will 
be strong and stand up for American 
interests in the face of dangerous re-
gimes like Cuba and China, regimes 
that are committed to harm the United 
States and our allies. 
For all these reasons, Mr. President, 
I oppose Ambassador Burns’ nomina-
tion and urge my colleagues to do the 
same. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is, Will the Senate advise and 
consent to the Burns and McKeon 
nominations en bloc? 
The nominations were confirmed en

CONFIRMATION OF XAVIER 
BECERRA 
∑ Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
rise today in support of the nomination 
of my friend and former colleague Xa-
vier Becerra to lead the Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
Xavier and I served together in the 
House of Representatives from January 
2007 to January 2013. While we sat on 
different House committees, we were 
both very involved in one of Congress’s 
most significant achievements during 
that time—passage of the Affordable 
Care Act, ACA. The ACA promised to 
greatly shrink the number of uninsured 
Americans and rein in health care 
costs that were increasing rapidly. It 
also led to false, harsh, partisan accu-
sations by Republicans that the law 
was going to ration health care and 
death panels were inevitable. 
Despite years of sabotage and dozens 
of attempts to repeal it, the Affordable 
Care Act has lived up to its promise: 
more than 20 million Americans gained

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S1642 
March 18, 2021 
health insurance thanks to the ACA, 
and the ACA reduced health care 
spending a total of $2.3 trillion between 
2010 and 2017. 
As a senior member of the Health 
Subcommittee of the House Ways and 
Means 
Committee, 
Xavier 
Becerra 
played a significant role to help write 
and pass the ACA and defended the law 
from near continuous Republican as-
sault as California’s attorney general. 
Most recently, he has been leading liti-
gation at the Supreme Court to rein-
state the ACA after an ideologically- 
driven district court judge struck down 
the law in its entirety. 
These efforts demonstrate the leader-
ship, experience, and health policy ex-
pertise Xavier will bring to the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services. 
Despite these bona fides, Republican 
Senators are actively smearing Xavi-
er’s reputation and misrepresenting his 
qualifications to prevent him from be-
coming the first Latino to serve as 
HHS Secretary. 
First, they claim Xavier isn’t quali-
fied because he isn’t a doctor. Repub-
licans clearly didn’t believe this was a 
deal breaker when all but one of them 
voted to confirm Alex Azar—a former 
executive 
at 
Eli 
Lilly—as 
Donald 
Trump’s HHS Secretary. I think most 
Americans would rather have an HHS 
Secretary like Xavier Becerra, who 
successfully sued hospitals to lower 
healthcare costs, than a person in 
charge of running a pharmaceutical 
company. 
Republicans 
have 
also 
claimed that Xavier lacks ‘‘extensive 
health care experience.’’ This is par-
ticularly rich coming from the same 
people who voted to confirm Betsy De- 
Vos to become Education Secretary. 
She not only had never worked in a 
public school, she had never even at-
tended one. These same Republicans 
voted to confirm Rick Perry to become 
Energy Secretary, when he didn’t even 
know the Department of Energy was 
responsible for the Nation’s nuclear ar-
senal. 
Throughout his 12 terms in the House 
of Representatives, Xavier Becerra was 
a leader on health policy issues. He 
helped write the most sweeping change 
to our healthcare system in more than 
a generation, and now, as the Cali-
fornia attorney general, he is defending 
that law in court. He has the experi-
ence needed to lead the Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
Republicans are also attacking Xavi-
er’s nomination on the grounds that he 
is somehow ‘‘extreme’’ and ‘‘a radical’’ 
because he supports a woman’s right to 
have an abortion. The Supreme Court 
first recognized a woman’s constitu-
tional right to an abortion in 1973. 
That is nearly 50 years ago. Supporting 
this fundamental right is anything but 
radical, it is a position shared by al-
most 70 percent of the American peo-
ple. But that hasn’t stopped attacks on 
a woman’s right to seek and have one. 
What is ‘‘extreme’’ and ‘‘radical’’ are 
Republican efforts to undermine this 
right—if not completely eliminate it. 
Just last week, the Republican Gov-
ernor of Arkansas signed a law that 
bans all abortions unless they are nec-
essary to save the life of the mother. 
This law is directly contrary to the Su-
preme Court’s command that States 
cannot prohibit abortion prior to via-
bility. It does not even include an ex-
ception for pregnancies that are the re-
sult of rape or incest. 
The junior senator from Arkansas 
has called Xavier Becerra ‘‘extreme’’ 
and ‘‘a radical’’ for defending a wom-
an’s constitutional right to an abor-
tion, while his State wants to force 
women who have been raped to carry 
their pregnancies to term. What planet 
are we living on? 
On Thursday night, Xavier Becerra 
will be confirmed to become the next 
Secretary of the Department of Health 
and Human Services. In any normal 
world, the vote would be bipartisan and 
it would be overwhelming. I strongly 
support his nomination and call on my 
colleagues to do so as well.∑

VOTE EXPLANATION 
∑ Ms. HIRONO. Madam President, I 
was necessarily absent for votes on 
March 18, 2021, so I could return to Ha-
waii to tend to a family matter. 
On March 18, had I been present, I

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
RECOGNIZING LaGRANGE HIGH 
SCHOOL 
∑ Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise today to speak to the fortitude of 
the students, faculty, and staff of La-
Grange High School. Located in Lake 
Charles, LA, LaGrange High School 
educates over 1,000 students and is led 
by their Principal Monica Guillory. As 
you may know, on top of a global pan-
demic, southwest Louisiana was rav-
aged by two major hurricanes last 
year. In most cases, people would try 
to return to some sense of normalcy or 
return to the status quo following a 
deadly virus and multiple natural dis-
asters. However, the LaGrange High 
School girls’ basketball team, known 
as the Lady Gators, would not accept 
the status quo. Led by head coach 
La’Keem Holmes, and assistant coach-
es Patrick Woodard, Sharde Henry, and 
Sean Andress, these ladies carried their 
school and community through trou-
bled waters and became back-to-back 
Class 4A State champions. This is the 
first school in the Lake Charles area to 
be 
State 
champions 
back-to-back. 
These young women gave their commu-
nity something to rally behind during 
hard times, the purple and white. What 
a gift that is. It is my honor to visit 
them and learn of all the great things 
they are accomplishing.∑ 
f 
RECOGNIZING OSHER LIFELONG 
LEARNING INSTITUTE 
∑ Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, I rise 
today to congratulate the Osher Life-
long Learning Institute at George 
Mason University, OLLI Mason, its 
30th anniversary and on its continuing 
success in offering educational pro-
gramming 
for 
older 
Americans 
in 
Northern Virginia. Programs like OLLI 
Mason provide lifelong learning oppor-
tunities for seniors interested in main-
taining an active intellectual life. 
The Learning in Retirement Insti-
tute was founded in 1991 to establish 
educational and social opportunities 
for a growing base of seniors in North-
ern Virginia. The Institute soon be-
came affiliated with George Mason 
University as part of Mason’s vision to 
extend its learning mission in the com-
munity. The institute was generously 
endowed by the Bernard Osher Founda-
tion, a nonprofit that is dedicated to 
enhancing quality of life in the United 
States through education and the arts. 
What started two decades ago as a 
member-run Learning in Retirement 
Center with 100 members operating and 
teaching out of one room in Mason’s 
Commerce II Building has burgeoned 
today into a robust, first-rate edu-
cational and social institute with 1,100 
members. 
OLLI Mason’s mission is ‘‘to offer its 
members learning opportunities in a 
stimulating 
environment 
in 
which 
adults can share their talents, experi-
ences and skills, explore new interests, 
discover and develop latent abilities, 
engage in intellectual and cultural pur-
suits, and socialize with others of simi-
lar interests.’’ OLLI Mason has ful-
filled this mission by offering retirees 
in Northern Virginia over 600 courses 
from arts to zoology, religion to 
science, as well as excursions and spe-
cial events. 
As the over 50 population across the 
Commonwealth 
continues 
to 
live 
longer and healthier lives, I am pleased 
to recognize OLLI, George Mason Uni-
versity, and the County of Fairfax for 
their initiative in foreseeing decades 
ago the critical need to offer programs 
that meet the needs, expand opportuni-
ties, and enhance the quality of life for 
older Americans across Northern Vir-
ginia. I look forward to many more 
years of their programming success.∑

f 
STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED 
BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTION 
By Mr. BURR (for himself and 
Mr. KING): 
S. 821. A bill to amend the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 to establish a 
simplified 
income-driven 
repayment 
plan, and for other purposes; to the 
Committee 
on 
Health, 
Education, 
Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. BURR. Mr. President, for two 
Congresses, Angus King and I have in-
troduced 
bipartisan 
legislation 
to 
streamline and simplify student loan 
repayment 
programs. 
Our 
proposal 
would make the current, overly-com-
plicated 
loan 
repayment 
programs 
easier to navigate and more predict-
able for both borrowers and the Federal 
Government. 
Today, students are asked to choose 
between nine different loan repayment 
plans, each with different eligibility 
and income requirements. The uncer-
tainty created by too many competing 
options has made it nearly impossible 
for the Federal Government to accu-
rately fund the program, leading to bil-
lions of dollars in budget shortfalls. 
Just last year, the Office of Manage-
ment and the Budget said the Direct 
Loan Program would cost $64 billion 
more than previously anticipated in 
just a single fiscal year prior to the 
COVID–19 emergency. The COVID–19 
emergency caused $39 billion in addi-
tional unplanned for costs to the pro-
gram through congressional and ad-
ministrative 
actions. 
This 
is 
unsustainable, and it is unnecessary. 
We need to make it easier for student 
borrowers to find the best repayment 
plan that works for them, and we need 
to make it easier for the Federal Gov-
ernment to accurately account for a 
program on which so many students 
depend. The REPAY Act would do just 
that, and I am here again to introduce 
this commonsense proposal to help all 
new borrowers, which represents ap-
proximately 20 percent of Federal stu-
dent loan borrowers each year. This 
bill has been previously supported by a 
number of cosponsors, including Sen-
ators WARNER, RUBIO, COLLINS, CAPITO, 
SHAHEEN, CARPER, WICKER, MANCHIN, 
and PORTMAN. 
The REPAY Act would simplify this 
process by establishing just two, easy- 
to-understand loan repayment plans. 
The first is a fixed 10-year payment 
option, like most borrowers pay now. 
The second is a simplified income- 
driven repayment plan, which takes 
into consideration how much a student 
borrowed verses how much they earn. 
First, this plan provides forgiveness 
of all outstanding debt after the bor-
rower fulfills their obligation to pay 
monthly on a 20-year term if the stu-
dent borrowed less than the maximum 
undergraduate 
borrowing 
limit 
of 
$57,500 and pay monthly on a 25-year 
term if the student borrowed more 
than the undergraduate limit. 
Second, this plan provides reasonable 
expectations for monthly payments. 
Very low-income borrowers would have 
a zero dollar payment. No payments 
are required until a borrower earns 
above 150 percent of the poverty line, 
which adjusts by family size and in-
come. Modest-income borrowers would 
have a very low payment equal to 10 
percent of the earnings they make 
above 150 percent of the poverty line. 
Higher income borrowers would pay 10 
percent on the first $25,000 of discre-
tionary income they earned and 15 per-
cent on any income above that. 
A single income-driven repayment 
plan assures students that there is a 
reasonable repayment plan available 
based on their individual earnings. It 
means students won’t be unnecessarily 
discouraged from pursuing careers that 
may pay less but for which they have a 
passion, such as education or social 
work. 
As I said, this is not the first time 
Senator KING and I have introduced 
this legislation, but there is added ur-
gency this year because of the COVID– 
19 pandemic and because of the reck-
less proposals to simply transfer hun-
dreds of billions in debt from indi-
vidual borrowers to the Federal Gov-
ernment. 
Last year, as the Nation struggled to 
combat coronavirus, Congress paused 
loan repayments for all borrowers 
through September 30, 2020. The Trump 
and Biden administrations then ex-
tended that pause through September 
30, 2021. No borrower has been required 
to make a student loan payment for 
the last 12 months. As the American 
economy recovers, however, we cannot 
continue to pause payments indefi-
nitely or, even worse, erase large 
swaths of loan balances, regardless of 
an individual’s economic circumstance. 
Instead, Congress must put forward a 
commonsense plan that reflects the in-
terests of student loan borrowers and 
American taxpayers. 
I have cautioned Secretary Cardona 
against pursuing a dangerous proposal 
to simply forgive student debt through 
administrative action, an action which 
neither complies with the Federal 
Claims Collection Act, the Higher Edu-
cation Act, or the related regulations. 
Not only do I think this isn’t a legal 
idea, I don’t believe it is a wise one, ei-
ther. It is reckless policymaking to 
forgive massive amounts of existing 
student debt and doing so will create a 
profound moral hazard. What happens 
after existing debt is forgiven? Will 
colleges magically lower their tuition 
and fees, so no student ever needs to 
borrow again, or will colleges continue 
to charge for their services, and will 
students load right back up on exorbi-
tant debt that 5, 10, or 30 years from 
now the American taxpayer will be 
asked to write off once again? This is 
an unserious gambit that doesn’t come 
close to addressing the real drivers of 
student debt. 
Rather than a flash-in-the-pan trick, 
I propose that we take up a durable 
policy solution, which includes the 
commonsense, 
bipartisan 
legislation 
that Senator ANGUS KING and I are ad-
vocating. Our proposal helps ensure 
student loan repayment programs are 
understandable and workable for future 
students who need them. As ranking 
member of the Education Committee, I 
will work with our committee’s chair-
man to move this legislation forward. I 
hope that we will find a willing partner 
in the White House and at the Depart-
ment of Education. 
By Mr. THUNE (for himself, Mr. 
MURPHY, Mr. BARRASSO, Mrs. 
CAPITO, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. KING, 
Ms. MURKOWSKI, Mr. ROUNDS, 
and Mr. WICKER):

By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself 
and Mr. GRASSLEY): 
S. 854. A bill to designate meth-
amphetamine as an emerging threat, 
and for other purposes; to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary. 
Ms. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, na-
tionally, 
psychostimulant 
overdose 
deaths, including methamphetamine- 
related deaths, increased by nearly 42% 
between July 2019 and July 2020. This 
increase is second only to synthetic 
opioids, a category which includes 
fentanyl. 
My home State of California has been 
particularly hard hit. Between 2014 and 
2019, methamphetamine-caused deaths 
in San Diego increased from 262 to 546, 
a stunning 108 percent increase in just 
five years. Similarly, in Los Angeles 
County, 
methamphetamine 
was 
in-
volved in 44 percent of all drug over-
dose deaths in 2018. 
Unfortunately, these figures are not 
unique to California, as other localities 
throughout the country are also seeing 
increases. 
That is why I am introducing the 
Methamphetamine 
Response 
Act, 
which was passed by the Senate unani-
mously during the last session of Con-
gress, with my colleague, Senator 
GRASSLEY. 
This bill does two things. First, it de-
clares methamphetamine an emerging 
drug threat. Second, it requires the Of-
fice of National Drug Control Policy 
(ONDCP) to develop and implement a 
national plan that is specific to meth-
amphetamine, 
in 
accordance 
the 
ONDCP Reauthorization, which I was 
proud to co-author, and which was en-
acted in 2018 as part of the SUPPORT 
Act. 
This 
plan 
must 
include: 
An 
assesment of the methamphetamine 
threat, including the current avail-
ability of, and demand for, the drug, 
and the effectiveness of evidence-based 
prevention and treatment programs, as 
well as law enforcement programs; 
Short- and long-term goals focused 
on supply and demand reduction and 
the expansion of prevention and treat-
ment programs; 
Performance measures related to the 
plan’s goals; and 
The level of funding needed to imple-
ment the plan, including an assessment 
of whether available funding can be re-
programmed or transferred, or whether 
additional funds are needed. 
It is clear that methamphetamine is 
re-emerging as a major drug threat to 
our Nation: 
Data shows that methamphetamine 
use is no longer limited to Mid-West 
and Western States, but is increasingly 
prevalent in Northeastern States. 
Between 
2018 
and 
2019, 
psychostimulant overdose deaths, in-
cluding methamphetamine deaths, in-
creased in 27 of the 38 States that pro-
vide drug-specific data to the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. 
This amounts to a 27 percent increase 
nationally. 
Methamphetamine continues to be 
highly potent, pure, and cheap. By the 
end of 2019, its availability and use had 
both increased. 
Between 2016 and 2019, the number of 
individuals aged 12 and older with a 
methamphetamine 
use 
disorder 
in-
creased from 684,000 to one million. 
That’s a 46 percent increase in just 
three years. 
Emergency room admissions for sus-
pected stimulant overdoses, including 
methamphetamine, increased by 23 per-
cent between January 2019 and 2020. 
These increases occurred in 36 States 
and the District of Colombia. 
Two of the largest methamphetamine 
seizures on record occurred in 2019: 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP) seized 3,000 pounds of meth-
amphetamine at the port of Otay Mesa 
while the Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration seized 2,224 pounds of meth-
amphetamine 
in 
Riverside 
County. 
Both of these seizures were in Cali-
fornia. 
Given the increasing size of these sei-
zures, it is not surprising that in the 
first five months of fiscal year 2021, 
CBP has already seized more than 
75,000 pounds of methamphetamine. 
In 
a 
one 
year 
span, 
psychostimulants, 
including 
meth-
amphetamine, killed more than 21,000 
Americans. Absent immediate action 
and a comprehensive plan, these fatali-
ties will continue to increase. 
I look forward to working with my 
colleagues in the Senate and in the 
House to see Methamphetamine Re-
sponse Act enacted. 
Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the 
floor.

S. 864. A bill to extend Federal Pell 
Grant eligibility of certain short-term 
programs; to the Committee on Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pensions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President. In today’s 
economy, ensuring access to a variety 
of postsecondary programs has become 
even more critical in light of the 
COVID–19 pandemic. As of the end of 
2020, more than 10 million Americans 
were unemployed, and 3. 7 million of 
those individuals have suffered perma-
nent job loss. These workers will need 
access to postsecondary education and 
training to reskill and reenter the 
workforce. Notably, according to a poll 
conducted by Strada in June of 2020, 
Americans strongly prefer nondegree 
and skills training programs over de-
gree programs as a way to access post-
secondary credentials during and post- 
pandemic. 
However, when it comes to higher 
education, Federal policies are not 
doing enough to support the demands 
of the changing labor market. Many of 
the individuals who enter into skills 
and job training programs are at the 
lowest end of the socioeconomic level, 
yet simply because their goal is to 
enter the workforce rather than obtain 
a degree, they are denied access Fed-
eral financial aid. The Federal Pell 
Grant Program—needs-based grants for 
low-income and king students—can 
only be used to offset the cost of pro-
grams that are over 600 clock hours or

at least 15 weeks in length. While many 
short-term 
programs 
provide 
high- 
quality skills training that employers 
need and recognize, they are not Pell- 
eligible. 
Since the creation of the Pell grant, 
the profile of today’s students has 
evolved along with the types of post-
secondary education and training pro-
grams students look to enroll in. 
Today, 3 7 percent of all postsecondary 
students are 25 years of age or older, 68 
percent work full-or-part-time while 
attending school and 26 percent have 
children or dependents. While many of 
these students enroll in longer-term 
degree programs, a significant number 
seek out shorter-term, workforce-ori-
ented training programs that lead to 
in-demand jobs or stack to longer-term 
education pathways. These short-term 
programs allow them to advance their 
education and skills in a manner that 
works with their life-situation of work-
ing and caring for children and other 
dependents. Without such programs, 
many of these students cannot devote 
the four plus years that many part- 
time students must spend to get an as-
sociates degree, or six plus years to 
earn a four year degree. Our federal 
higher education policy must be mod-
ernized to meet the needs of students 
and 
employers. 
According 
to 
the 
Georgetown University Center on Edu-
cation and the Workforce, shorter-term 
educational investments pay off—the 
average postsecondary certificate hold-
er has 30 percent higher lifetime earn-
ings than individuals with only a high 
school diploma. 
Today, I am pleased to introduce 
with my colleague, Senator PORTMAN, 
the Jumpstart Our Businesses by Sup-
porting Students or JOBS Act. The 
JOBS Act would close extend Pell 
Grant eligibility to high-quality, short- 
term job training programs offered at 
community colleges and other public 
institutions, so workers can afford the 
instruction they need to be successful 
in today’s job market. Under the legis-
lation, Pell-eligible job training pro-
grams are defined as those providing at 
least 150 clock hours of instruction 
time over a minimum of 8 weeks. Eligi-
ble job training programs must also 
provide students with licenses, certifi-
cations, or credentials that meet the 
hiring requirements of multiple em-
ployers in the field for which the job 
training is offered. 
The JOBS Act also ensures that stu-
dents enrolling in Pell-eligible short- 
term programs are earning high-qual-
ity postsecondary credentials by re-
quiring that the credentials meet the 
standards of the Workforce Innovation 
and Opportunity Act, are recognized by 
industry or sector partnerships, and 
align with the skill needs of industries 
in States or local economies. Job train-
ing programs under this Act must also 
be evaluated by an accreditor and the 
State workforce board for quality and 
outcomes. The Virginia Community 
College System has identified approxi-
mately 50 programs that would benefit 
from the JOBS Act including in the 
fields of manufacturing, maritime, ar-
chitecture/construction, energy, health 
care, information technology, trans-
portation, and business management 
and administration. 
The JOBS Act is a commonsense, bi-
partisan bill that would help workers 
and employers succeed in today’s econ-
omy. As Congress works to help Ameri-
cans recover from pandemic job losses, 
I am hopeful that my colleagues will 
join me in advocating for Pell Grants 
to be made available to individuals en-
rolling 
in 
high-quality, 
short-term 
training programs that lead to indus-
try-recognized credentials and good 
paying jobs.

By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and 
Ms. SMITH): 
S. 876. A bill to amend the Richard B. 
Russell National School Lunch Act to 
require the Secretary of Agriculture to 
make loan guarantees and grants to fi-
nance certain improvements to school 
lunch facilities, to train school food 
service personnel, and for other pur-
poses; to the Committee on Agri-
culture, Nutrition, and Forestry. 
Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise 
to introduce School Food Moderniza-
tion Act to assist our schools in updat-
ing outdated kitchen equipment, allow-
ing them to provide healthier meals to 
students. I also thank my colleague 
from Minnesota, Senator SMITH, for co-
sponsoring this bill. 
School meals play a vital role in the 
lives of so many of our children. As one 
school nutrition director from Maine 
recently told me, school meals are the 
‘‘foundation 
for 
student 
success.’’ 
Nearly 100,000 schools participate in 
the National School Lunch program, 
serving 30 million children each day, 
helping to prevent hunger. Many chil-
dren consume up to half their daily ca-
loric intake at school, and some get 
their most nutritious meals of the day 
at school instead of at home. Because 
school meals are a significant source of 
daily nutrition for so many, we must 
consistently aim to improve the pro-
gram to best serve students. 
The COVID–19 pandemic has further 
highlighted the importance of school 
meals for many families. Across the 
country, schools and nutrition pro-
grams were adapted to remote and hy-
brid learning models during the pan-
demic. Nutrition programs in Maine 
and other states have tirelessly contin-
ued to support the nutritional needs of 
students despite school closures, with 
many schools offering as many as four 
or five meal delivery options to ensure 
families can continue to access food 
seven days a week. I met recently with 
school nutrition directors from Maine 
who said lack of equipment, including 
access to cold storage, has forced them 
to be even more creative in continuing 
to serve children across Maine during 
COVID–19. Many schools are using 
stoves from the 1960s and others lack 
adequate storage facilities to store the 
large amount of food needed to provide 
multi-day bulk meal bags for children 
and families who are learning remotely 
or attending school only part-time. 
The fact is schools built decades ago 
often lack the equipment and infra-
structure necessary to do more than 
reheat and serve one or two meal op-
tions each day. Even before the pan-
demic, nearly 90 percent of schools 
needed at least one piece of updated 
school kitchen equipment. It is esti-
mated that Maine schools alone would 
need $58.8 million for equipment infra-
structure upgrades needed to serve 
healthy meals to all of our students. 
The Agriculture Appropriations Sub-
committee, on which I serve, has con-
sistently recognized this need and ap-
propriated 
$30 
million 
for 
School 
Equipment 
Assistance 
Grants 
last 
year. The School Food Modernization 
Act would codify and improve this suc-
cessful grant program to better meet 
the growing need nationwide. 
The School Food Modernization Act 
seeks to help school food service per-
sonnel offer a wide variety of nutri-
tious and appealing meals to all stu-
dents. First, the bill would provide tar-
geted grant assistance to supply the 
seed funding needed to upgrade kitchen 
infrastructure or to purchase high- 
quality equipment. Second, it would es-
tablish a loan guarantee assistance 
program within USDA to help schools 
acquire new equipment. Finally, to aid 
school food services personnel in run-
ning successful, healthy programs, the 
legislation would authorize grants to 
support training and technical assist-
ance for food service personnel. 
Mr. President, I encourage my col-
leagues to continue supporting school 
kitchen equipment needs as the Child 
Nutrition 
Reauthorization 
process 
takes shape. If our children are going 
to be able to learn and meet their full 
potential, they need their minds and 
bodies to be fully nourished. This bill 
would help us achieve that goal.

RESOLUTION 
122—RE-
AFFIRMING 
THE 
IMPORTANCE 
OF UNITED STATES ALLIANCES 
AND PARTNERSHIPS 
Mr. RISCH (for himself and Mr. 
MENENDEZ) submitted the following 
resolution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 122 
Whereas, from the American Revolution, 
through two World Wars, the Cold War, and 
the fight against international terrorist or-
ganizations, the United States has success-
fully relied on alliances and partnerships 
with like-minded countries to further our 
vital security, political, and economic inter-
ests, starting with the Treaty of Alliance 
with France in 1778 and continuing to the 
present day; 
Whereas these treaty alliances provide a 
unique strategic advantage to the United 
States and are among the Nation’s most pre-
cious assets, enabling the United States to 
advance its vital national interests, defend 
its territory, expand its economy through 
international trade and commerce, establish 
enduring cooperation among like-minded 
countries, prevent the domination of Europe 
or the Indo-Pacific and its surrounding mari-
time and air lanes by a hostile power or pow-
ers, and deter potential aggressors; 
Whereas United States treaty alliances ad-
vance critical shared interests, including up-
holding regional stability and security, de-
terring adversaries, maintaining maritime 
freedom of navigation, promoting global eco-
nomic prosperity, combating the prolifera-
tion of weapons of mass destruction, sup-
porting international institutions and archi-
tecture, 
advancing 
democracy, 
human 
rights, and the rule of law, upholding inter-
national law, and promoting shared values 
and norms; 
Whereas the combined strength conferred 
by treaty alliances enables the United States 
and its allies to leverage a multinational re-
sponse to important challenges and advance 
joint initiatives that tackle global problems 
with a unity of purpose; 
Whereas, after the end of the Second World 
War, the United States Government strategi-
cally invested in building a global network 
of alliances and partnerships, including 
through the Marshall Plan in Europe and 
with our post-war partners in Asia, which 
helped these countries grow into democratic, 
prosperous, peaceful nations with whom the 
United States could effectively partner; 
Whereas the United States-Japan, United 
States-Republic of Korea, United States-Aus-
tralia, United States-Philippines, and United

States-Thailand alliances are the foundation 
of regional stability in the Indo-Pacific; 
Whereas the United States greatly values 
other partnerships in the Indo-Pacific re-
gion, including with India, Singapore, Indo-
nesia, Taiwan, New Zealand, and Vietnam; 
Whereas the United States maintains an 
unwavering commitment to the defense of 
Japan under Article 5 of the United States- 
Japan security treaty, which includes the 
Senkaku Islands, as recently reaffirmed by 
President Joseph R. Biden; 
Whereas the United States-Japan alliance 
is one of the most important political, eco-
nomic, and military alliances in the world, 
and is crucial to maintaining a favorable 
balance of power in the Indo-Pacific region 
and advancing a free and open region charac-
terized by a commitment to democratic gov-
ernance, the free flow of commerce, and 
shared rules and norms; 
Whereas the United States-Republic of 
Korea alliance is essential for peace and 
prosperity in Northeast Asia and critical to 
closely coordinating to face the challenges 
posed by the Democratic People’s Republic 
of Korea; 
Whereas the United States-Australia alli-
ance remains an anchor of stability in the 
Indo-Pacific and the world, while Australia’s 
2020 Defense Strategic Update and 2020 Force 
Structure Plan recognize and respond to 
Australia’s evolving strategic threat envi-
ronment, including by committing to boost 
its defense spending by 40 percent over the 
next decade and to bolster its high-end mili-
tary capabilities, which provides further op-
portunities for the United States and Aus-
tralia to boost cooperation on defense and 
strategic and emerging technologies; 
Whereas a strong United States-Philippine 
alliance is vital to a free and open Indo-Pa-
cific region, the Mutual Defense Treaty 
(MDT) is important for the security of both 
nations, and Secretary of State Antony 
Blinken has reaffirmed former Secretary of 
State Michael R. Pompeo’s March 2019 state-
ment regarding the clear application of the 
MDT to armed attacks against Philippine 
armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft in 
the Pacific, which includes the South China 
Sea; 
Whereas the Philippines is of unique 
geostrategic importance, is a crucial partner 
in the areas of counterterrorism and mari-
time security, and plays an important role in 
upholding regional security in the South and 
West Pacific, including the First and Second 
Island Chains, and a strong relationship be-
tween the United States military and the 
Armed Forces of the Philippines, solidified 
through agreements such as the Enhanced 
Defense Cooperation Agreement and the Vis-
iting Forces Agreement, is in the national 
interests of both the Philippines and the 
United States; 
Whereas the United States and Thailand 
are increasing their defense cooperation to 
advance shared interests in the Indo-Pacific; 
Whereas the United States has an oppor-
tunity to strengthen its relationships, in-
cluding defense relationships, with treaty al-
lies and other partners in Southeast Asia, es-
pecially through cooperation that enables 
these partners to better contend with in-
fringements on their sovereignty, including 
by encouraging allies to make specific in-
vestments to enhance their area denial and 
mobile defense-in-depth capabilities; 
Whereas, in 1949, the United States joined 
with several European countries to conclude 
the North Atlantic Treaty, which formed a 
basis for the North Atlantic Treaty Organi-
zation (NATO), in order ‘‘to safeguard the 
freedom, common heritage and civilisation 
of their peoples, founded on the principles of 
democracy, individual liberty and the rule of 
law’’ and to ‘‘promote stability and well- 
being in the North Atlantic area’’; 
Whereas 30 European and North American 
nations are members of NATO, and all sig-
natories to the North Atlantic Treaty have 
‘‘resolved to unite their efforts for collective 
defence and for the preservation of peace and 
security’’; 
Whereas, following the terrorist attacks of 
September 11, 2001, the NATO alliance in-
voked Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty 
for the first and only time, reaffirming that 
an armed attack against one member of the 
alliance shall be considered an attack 
against all; 
Whereas NATO serves as a force multiplier, 
reducing the burden borne by the United 
States, has command structures, training in-
stitutions, and multilateral exercises that 
have generated unprecedented contributions 
to United States national security priorities 
and enabled NATO soldiers to serve along-
side members of the United States Armed 
Forces, including through NATO’s ongoing 
support of Operation Resolute Support in Af-
ghanistan, NATO’s Kosovo Force, Operation 
Sea Guardian in the Mediterranean Sea, the 
capacity-building NATO Mission Iraq, sup-
port for African Union missions, and air po-
licing missions in member and nonmember 
nations of Eastern Europe, and has taken a 
strong stand against Russian aggression in 
Eastern Europe; 
Whereas, in his February 19, 2021, speech to 
the Munich Security Conference, President 
Biden reaffirmed, ‘‘The transatlantic alli-
ance is. . .the strong foundation on which 
our collective security and our shared pros-
perity are built. The partnership between 
Europe and the United States, in my view, is 
and must remain the cornerstone of all that 
we hope to accomplish in the 21st century, 
just as we did in the 20th century.. . .The 
United States is fully committed to our 
NATO Alliance, and I welcome Europe’s 
growing investment in the military capabili-
ties that enable our shared defense.’’; 
Whereas previous Democratic and Repub-
lican Administrations alike have recognized 
that strong, healthy, and politically sustain-
able alliances require equitable, fair, reason-
able, and mutually beneficial burden-sharing 
arrangements, and that the key to alliance 
success is a diplomatic and security posture 
characterized by the effective marshaling of 
resources and acquisition and deployment of 
complementary capabilities, such as the in-
crease in defense spending by all NATO na-
tions since the Wales Declaration of 2014, 
with 11 members now spending 2 percent of 
their GDP on defense and several more on 
track to meet that benchmark by 2024; 
Whereas the United States’ extended nu-
clear deterrence commitments to NATO and 
Indo-Pacific allies are foundational to the 
health, strength, and effectiveness of these 
alliances and to continued international se-
curity and stability; 
Whereas maintaining robust United States 
diplomatic, economic, and defense budgets 
are critical to advancing cooperation with 
allies and partners on shared challenges, and 
deep and precipitous cuts in United States 
diplomatic, economic, and defense budgets 
would damage the health, robustness, and ef-
fectiveness of United States alliances; 
Whereas, in a sign of our shared security 
objectives and cooperation, our allies and 
partners have hosted United States military 
installations and welcomed members of the 
United States Armed Forces; 
Whereas citizens of our allies and partners 
have sacrificed their lives in support of ef-
forts to combat terrorism and promote secu-
rity in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere, and 
have contributed significant forces to our 
military endeavors, placing more combat 
power on the battlefield, while reducing the 
burden borne by the United States; 
Whereas the United States has worked 
with our allies and partners to mitigate con-
flict and humanitarian crises around the 
world, and United States allies have made 
significant contributions to address humani-
tarian, food security, health, climate-re-
lated, and other pressing challenges around 
the world; 
Whereas the United States and its allies 
face an increasingly challenging security en-
vironment in the 21st century, characterized 
by strategic competition with revisionist 
powers such as the People’s Republic of 
China and the Russian Federation, which 
seek to destabilize the international system; 
Whereas this security environment de-
mands United States and allied commitment 
to strengthening and advancing our alliances 
so that they are postured to meet these chal-
lenges, and will require sustained political 
will, concrete partnerships, economic, com-
mercial, and technological cooperation, con-
sistent and tangible commitments, high- 
level and extensive consultations on matters 
of mutual interest, mutual and shared co-
operation in the acquisition of key capabili-
ties important to allied defenses, and unified 
mutual support in the face of political, eco-
nomic, or military coercion; and 
Whereas successive generations of leaders 
of the United States and its allies have suc-
cessfully managed the challenges and con-
straints inherent in alliances, thus ensuring 
that the benefits of alliances outweigh the 
costs: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) reaffirms the enduring commitment of 
the United States to our treaty allies in the 
Indo-Pacific region and NATO, as well as to 
other partners, including our treaty obliga-
tions for mutual defense; 
(2) emphasizes the primary importance of 
the United States’ relationships, alliances, 
and partnerships to global peace and pros-
perity; 
(3) recognizes the many contributions that 
alliances and partnerships have made to ad-
vance the interests of the United States and 
to promote shared interests; 
(4) underscores that alliances have en-
hanced mutual security by jointly sharing in 
common defense, including the defense of the 
United States, and that strong alliances and 
partnerships generate decisive and sustained 
United States military advantages; 
(5) encourages dealing constructively with 
significant tensions in the United States’ al-
liance relationships to ensure they do not 
create fissures that adversaries can exploit; 
(6) welcomes and seeks to advance the con-
tinued collaboration of the United States 
and our allies and partners to respect and de-
fend the rules-based international order and 
the values of democracy, human rights, and 
the rule of law that undergird our common 
security and prosperity; 
(7) reaffirms bipartisan support for equi-
table and mutually beneficial burden-sharing 
arrangements, including fair and additional 
substantive contributions by United States 
allies, and acknowledges the special meas-
ures agreements (SMA) reached by the Biden 
Administration with Japan and the Republic 
of Korea, and urges ongoing consultations to 
consider additional allied contributions be-
yond the traditional SMA categories and to 
use these consultations as an opportunity to 
strengthen our alliances with these two part-
ners; 
(8) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to strengthening and boosting 
our alliances and partnerships in the Indo- 
Pacific, including to contend with China’s 
growing power projection capabilities and 
use of coercive and grey-zone tactics, and to 
jointly develop, regulate, and monitor the

(9) encourages the Biden Administration to 
focus significantly on growing defense co-
operation with Australia, especially in light 
of the country’s 2020 Defense Strategic Up-

initiatives that advance alliance defense co-
operation that contributes to a free and open

technologies; 
(10) reaffirms the commitment of the 
United States to the NATO alliance and to 
NATO efforts to counter Kremlin aggression, 
including military aggression and attempts

(11) urges the Biden Administration to 
work with its NATO partners to advance the 
efforts currently underway within NATO to 
better prepare the alliance to confront fu-

their capabilities; 
(12) calls upon Indo-Pacific and NATO al-
lies to collaborate with the United States in 
developing the next generation of defense 
technologies, 
including 
disruptive

emerging technologies, while working to-
gether to improve multilateral export con-
trols, common standards for technology se-

(13) asks all members of NATO, including 
the United States, to devote significant en-

looking strategy to replace the 2010 Stra-

ing China, Russia, and instability on Eu-
rope’s southern border; 
(14) calls on the Biden Administration to 
ensure United States policy and posture re-
flects the requirements of extended deter-
rence to preserve nonproliferation benefits, 
assure allies, and to deter, and if necessary, 
respond, across the spectrum of nuclear and 
nonnuclear scenarios in defense of allies and

S. RES. 123 
Whereas National Women’s History Month 
recognizes and spreads awareness of the im-
portance of women in the history of the 
United States; 
Whereas, throughout the history of the 
United States, whether in their homes, in 
their workplaces, in schools, in the courts, 
or during wartime, women have fought for 
themselves, their families, and all people of 
the United States; 
Whereas, even from the early days of the 
history of the United States, Abigail Adams 
urged her husband to ‘‘Remember the La-
dies’’ when representatives met for the Con-
tinental Congress in 1776; 
Whereas women were particularly impor-
tant in the establishment of early chari-
table, philanthropic, and cultural institu-

Whereas women led the efforts to secure 
suffrage and equal opportunities for women, 
and also served in the abolitionist move-
ment, the emancipation movement, labor 
movements, civil rights movements, and 
other causes to create a more fair and just 
society for all; 
Whereas suffragists wrote, marched, were 
arrested, 
and 
ultimately 
succeeded 
in 
achieving— 
(1) the ratification of the 19th Amendment 
to the Constitution of the United States, 
which provides, ‘‘The right of citizens of the 
United States to vote shall not be denied or 
abridged by the United States or by any 
State on account of sex.’’; and 
(2) the enactment of the Voting Rights Act 
of 1965 (52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq.), which ex-
tended the protection of the right to vote to 
women of color and language minorities; 
Whereas women have been and continue to 
be leaders in the forefront of social change 
efforts, business, science, government, math, 
art, literature, music, film, athletics, and 
other fields; 
Whereas women now represent approxi-

numbers than men; 
Whereas women previously were turned 
away from law school, but now represent ap-
proximately half of law students in the 
United States; 
Whereas, since the American Revolution, 
women have been vital to the mission of the 
Armed Forces, with more than 200,000 women 
serving on active duty and 2,000,000 women 
veterans representing every branch of serv-

Whereas more than 10,000,000 women own 
businesses in the United States; 
Whereas Jeannette Rankin of Montana was 
the first woman elected to the House of Rep-
resentatives in 1916 and Hattie Wyatt Cara-
way of Arkansas was the first woman elected 
to the United States Senate in 1932; 
Whereas Margaret Chase Smith of Maine 
was the first woman to serve in both Houses 
of Congress; 
Whereas, in 2021, a record total of 144 
women are serving in Congress, including 120 
women in the House of Representatives and 
24 women in the Senate; 
Whereas President Jimmy Carter recog-
nized March 2 through 8, 1980, as ‘‘National 
Women’s History Week’’; 
Whereas, in 1987, a bipartisan group of Sen-
ators introduced the first joint resolution to 
pass Congress designating ‘‘Women’s History 
Month’’; 
Whereas, in 1987, President Ronald Reagan 
issued a Presidential proclamation pro-
claiming March 1987 as ‘‘Women’s History 
Month’’;

Smithsonian American Women’s History Mu-
seum Act (title I of division T of Public Law 
116–260) to establish a national women’s his-
tory museum on or near the National Mall in 
Washington, DC; and 
Whereas, despite the advancements of 
women in the United States, much remains 
to be done to ensure that women realize 
their full potential as equal members of soci-
ety in the United States: Now, therefore, be 
it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) designates March 2021 as ‘‘National 
Women’s History Month’’; 
(2) recognizes the celebration of National 
Women’s History Month as a time to reflect 
on the many notable contributions that 
women have made to the United States; and 
(3) urges the people of the United States to 
observe National Women’s History Month 
with appropriate programs and activities. 
Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I 
rise today in honor of Women’s History 
Month to recognize the extraordinary 
achievements of past generations of 
women, and to pay tribute to the vital 
role they have played in the political, 
economic, and social development of 
this nation. 
Women’s History Month provides a 
special opportunity to reflect upon 
women’s 
countless 
accomplishments 
that touch all aspects of our society— 
from government, to business, the arts 
and sciences, the military and much 
more. I look upon the courage our 
predecessors displayed with great ad-
miration, and I continue to be inspired 
by those who blazed the trail for 
women like me. 
In December of this past year, I was 
incredibly proud to see the Smithso-
nian Women’s History Museum Act, 
which I co-led with Senator SUSAN COL-
LINS, enacted into law. This law will 
create a long overdue, permanent mu-
seum to collect, study, and create pro-
grams that celebrate women’s experi-
ences and contributions. 
However, the last year also brought 
with it the loss of a number of pio-
neering women, including Justice Ruth 
Bader Ginsberg, NASA mathematician 
Katherine Johnson, and the brave Civil 
Rights Movement champion Lucille 
Bridges. Though these icons are no 
longer with us, their contributions will 
live on and their accomplishments 
have shattered glass ceilings for future 
generations of women. May we honor 
their work and memory with a com-
mitment to elevate and support future 
women leaders. 
This past election year marked a new 
high water mark for women in politics, 
as more women ran for and were elect-
ed to office in 2020 than ever before. Of 
the many notable wins, I was overjoyed 
to see my friend and former Senate col-
league, Vice President KAMALA HARRIS, 
elected to the nation’s second-highest 
office. The election of more women to 
places of power is crucial for our con-
tinued progress. 
I am eager to work with Vice Presi-
dent HARRIS and the 144 women serving 
in Congress in 2021 to address the chal-
lenges before us. 
One of our first priorities must be to 
address the ongoing pandemic, which

has had devastating consequences for 
the health of our country and econ-
omy. The pandemic has also uniquely 
harmed women and girls—especially 
women of color. A disproportionate 
number of women have lost their jobs 
as a result of the pandemic, and are 
often unable to maintain work com-
mitments with children learning from 
home while schools are closed. As far 
as we have come, this unequal harm 
borne by women during the pandemic 
reminds us of the work toward equality 
that is yet to be done. We must con-
tinue our work to ensure fairness and 
equity for women everywhere. 
As we undertake to celebrate Wom-
en’s History Month, I ask my col-
leagues to celebrate with me how far 
we have come and to continue the fight 
for the progress of all women—espe-
cially those who are struggling during 
these trying times. 
Thank you Mr. President and I yield 
the floor.

RESOLUTION 
124—CELE-
BRATING 
THE 
HERITAGE 
OF 
ROMANI AMERICANS 
Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Mr. 
WICKER) submitted the following reso-
lution; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 124 
Whereas the Romani people trace their an-
cestry to the Indian subcontinent; 
Whereas Roma have been a part of Euro-
pean immigration to the United States since 
the colonial period and particularly fol-
lowing the abolition of the enslavement of 
Roma in the historic Romanian principal-
ities; 
Whereas Roma live across the world and 
throughout the United States; 
Whereas the Romani people have made dis-
tinct and important contributions in many 
fields, including agriculture, art, crafts, lit-
erature, medicine, military service, music, 
sports, and science; 
Whereas, on April 8, 1971, the First World 
Romani Congress met in London, bringing 
Roma together from across Europe and the 
United States with the goal of promoting 
transnational cooperation among Roma in 
combating social marginalization and build-
ing a positive future for Roma everywhere; 
Whereas April 8 is therefore celebrated 
globally as International Roma Day; 
Whereas Roma were victims of genocide 
carried out by Nazi Germany and its Axis 
partners, and an estimated 200,000 to 500,000 
Romani people were killed by Nazis and their 
allies across Europe during World War II; 
Whereas, on the night of August 2-3, 1944, 
the so-called ‘‘Gypsy Family Camp’’ where 
Romani people were interned at Auschwitz- 
Birkenau was liquidated, and in a single 
night, between 4,200 and 4,300 Romani men, 
women, and children were killed in gas 
chambers; 
Whereas many countries are taking posi-
tive steps to remember and teach about the 
genocide of Roma by Nazi Germany and its 
Axis partners; and 
Whereas the United States Congress held 
its first hearing to examine the situation of 
Roma in 1994: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) remembers the genocide of Roma by 
Nazi Germany and its Axis partners and 
commemorates 
the 
destruction 
of 
the 
‘‘Gypsy Family Camp’’ where Romani people 
were interned at Auschwitz; 
(2) commends the United States Holocaust 
Memorial Museum for its role in promoting 
remembrance of the Holocaust and educating 
about the genocide of Roma; 
(3) supports International Roma Day as an 
opportunity to honor the culture, history, 
and heritage of the Romani people in the 
United States as part of the larger Romani 
global diaspora; and 
(4) welcomes the Department of State’s 
participation in ceremonies and events cele-
brating International Roma Day and similar 
engagement by the United States Govern-
ment. 
Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today, I am in-
troducing, along with Senator WICKER, a reso-
lution that celebrates Romani American herit-
age. 
As a member of the U.S. Helsinki Commis-
sion and the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly 
Special Representative on Anti-Semitism, Rac-
ism and Intolerance, I have long worked to im-
prove the situation of Roma throughout the 
OSCE region. This includes efforts to advance 
human rights compliant policing, ending ethnic 
and religious profiling, supporting diversity and 
inclusion in the U.S. national security work-
force and human rights training for foreign 
service officers, and supporting free and fair 
elections in the OSCE participating States. I 
also supported the appointment of Dr. Ethel 
Brooks to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Mu-
seum Council, on which I also currently serve. 
The resolution we are introducing today 
does four things. 
First, it recognizes and celebrates Romani 
American heritage. Roma have come to the 
United States with every wave of European 
migration since the colonial period. In the 
United States, there may be as many as one 
million Americans with some Romani ancestry, 
whether distant or more recent. Romani peo-
ple have made distinct and important contribu-
tions in many fields, including agriculture, art, 
crafts, literature, medicine, military service, 
music, sports, and science. 
Second, it supports International Roma Day 
and the Department of State’s robust engage-
ment in activities to that occasion. In 1971, on 
April 8th, 1971, the First World Romani Con-
gress met in London, bringing Roma together 
from across Europe and the United States 
with the goal of promoting transnational co-
operation among Roma, combating social 
marginalization, and building a positive future 
for Roma everywhere. April 8th is now cele-
brated as ‘‘International Roma Day’’ around 
the world. U.S. ambassadors and our embas-
sies across Europe are frequently asked to 
participate in April 8th celebrations across the 
region. I commend the important work they 
are doing as they demonstrate U.S. commit-
ment to inclusive societies not only on April 
8th, but also throughout the year. 
Third, this resolution commemorates the de-
struction of the so-called ‘‘Gypsy Family 
Camp’’ at Auschwitz. It is estimated that be-
tween 200,000 and 500,000 Romani people 
were killed in death camps and elsewhere 
throughout Europe. On August 2–3, 1944, 
Nazis murdered between 4,200 and 4,300 
Romani men, women, and children in gas 
chambers when the Nazis decided to liquidate 
this camp. A number of governments in recent 
years have taken important steps to com-
memorate the genocide of Roma, to remem-
ber the victims, and educate future genera-
tions. Germany took an important step when it 
opened in Berlin a memorial for Sinti and 
Roma victims of National Socialism. I also 
welcome the Czech government’s decision to 
remove the pig farm at the site of the Lety 
concentration camp the role of the Museum of 
Romani Culture in ensuring a proper memori-
alization of that sensitive site. 
Finally, this resolution commends the U.S. 
Holocaust Memorial Museum for its critically 
important role in promoting remembrance of 
the Holocaust and educating audiences about 
the genocide of Roma. The U.S. Holocaust 
Memorial Museum is the preeminent federal 
institution dedicated to serving as a living me-
morial to the Holocaust. I am honored to serve 
as a member of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial 
Museum Council, and I welcome the initiatives 
of the Museum to ensure that Romani victims 
are remembered and that related scholarship 
is supported. 
I am pleased that Sen. WICKER has joined 
me in introducing this resolution and urge 
other colleagues to join us in celebrating 
Romani American heritage.

March 18, 2021 
Whereas the national security law was 
passed without input from the semi-demo-
cratic Legislative Council of Hong Kong, or 
from the Hong Kong people more generally, 
and with no other attempt to account for the 
well-founded concerns of the Hong Kong peo-
ple regarding the sweeping nature of the leg-
islation and its incompatibility with Hong 
Kong’s system of justice and legal protec-
tions for fundamental rights and freedoms; 
Whereas the Government of the People’s 
Republic of China, the Chinese Communist 
Party, and the Government of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region have 
applied the draconian national security law 
arbitrarily to conduct a crackdown of un-
precedented scope and intensity, criminal-
izing peaceful protests, political dissent, and 
other forms of nonviolent expression by the 
people of Hong Kong; 
Whereas the objective of the political 
crackdown is to persecute individuals who 
have led peaceful pro-democracy movements 
in Hong Kong and to nullify the fundamental 
freedoms and human rights guaranteed to 
the people of Hong Kong under the Joint 
Declaration of the Government of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ire-
land and the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China on the Question of Hong 
Kong, done at Beijing December 19, 1984 
(commonly referred to as the ‘‘Sino-British 
Joint Declaration of 1984’’), and the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administra-
tive Region of the People’s Republic of 
China, adopted April 4, 1990 (in this preamble 
referred to as the ‘‘Hong Kong Basic Law’’); 
Whereas, in July 2020, Hong Kong authori-
ties charged 19-year-old activist Tony Chung 
with ‘‘inciting secession’’ on account of 
peaceful political speech that occurred prior 
to the enactment of the national security 
law, and, in October 2020, arrested and im-
prisoned Chung, who remains incarcerated 
awaiting trial under the national security 
law; 
Whereas, in July 2020, Hong Kong authori-
ties announced that elections for the Legis-
lative Council scheduled to be held in Sep-
tember 2020 would be postponed for an entire 
year under the pretense of public health con-
cerns; 
Whereas, in August 2020, the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China and the 
Chinese Communist Party detained 12 Hong 
Kong activists at sea, 2 of whom were juve-
niles, attempting to flee Hong Kong for Tai-
wan, and, after holding those individuals ar-
bitrarily for 4 months and denying them ac-
cess to lawyers hired by their families, in 
December 2020, tried them in a secret pro-
ceeding in Shenzhen, China, and, in January 
2021, sentenced 10 of the 12 individuals to 
prison; 
Whereas, in November 2020, the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress 
in Beijing, China, the rubber-stamp legisla-
ture of the Chinese Communist Party, adopt-
ed a decision that unilaterally disqualified 
Hong Kong legislators who ‘‘publicize or sup-
port independence,’’ ‘‘seek foreign inter-
ference,’’ or engage in ‘‘other activities that 
endanger national security,’’ thereby allow-
ing proxies of the Chinese Communist Party 
in Hong Kong to arbitrarily remove any leg-
islator whose views the Party found objec-
tionable, which they immediately did by re-
moving 4 pro-democracy legislators; 
Whereas, in December 2020, a Hong Kong 
court sentenced prominent pro-democracy 
leaders and activists Joshua Wong, Agnes 
Chow, and Ivan Lam to prison for their roles 
in an ‘‘unauthorized assembly’’ in 2019; 
Whereas, in December 2020, Hong Kong au-
thorities arrested the founder of Apple Daily 
and pro-democracy advocate Jimmy Lai on 
false charges, repeatedly denied him bail, 
and subsequently charged him with colluding 
with foreign forces under the national secu-
rity law; 
Whereas, in January 2021, Hong Kong au-
thorities arbitrarily arrested 53 pro-democ-
racy politicians and subsequently charged all 
but 6 of them with ‘‘subversion’’ under Arti-
cle 22 of the national security law for simply 
conducting a public opinion poll in July 2020 
regarding candidates for the Legislative 
Council; 
Whereas, on February 23, 2021, Hong Kong 
authorities announced that any candidate 
for district councilor, the lowest level of offi-
cials and the only office that is fully demo-
cratic, must be a ‘‘patriot’’ and take an oath 
swearing to uphold the Hong Kong Basic Law 
and pledge allegiance to the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China, and can-
didates who engage in ‘‘negative’’ behaviors, 
such as promoting self-determination, com-
posing a referendum, or ‘‘seeking to under-
mine the Hong Kong government’s interest 
and political structure,’’ will be barred from 
election for 5 years; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2021, Hong Kong 
authorities arrested 47 pro-democracy fig-
ures, most of whom are or were elected gov-
ernment officials, with ‘‘conspiracy to com-
mit subversion’’ under the national security 
law for organizing and participating in an in-
formal democratic primary for the Legisla-
tive Council; 
Whereas, on February 28, 2021, Secretary of 
State Antony Blinken stated, ‘‘We condemn 
the detention and charges filed against pan- 
democratic candidates in Hong Kong’s elec-
tions and call for their immediate release. 
Political participation and freedom of ex-
pression should not be crimes. The U.S. 
stands with the people of Hong Kong.’’; 
Whereas, on March 11, 2021, the National 
People’s Congress in Beijing adopted meas-
ures designed to fundamentally undo the ex-
isting democratic process in Hong Kong; and 
Whereas the people of Hong Kong have re-
peatedly shown extraordinary dedication to 
the cause of democracy and freedom for more 
than 3 decades, and almost continuously 
since 2014, protesting peacefully in the 
broiling heat and pouring rain while often 
enduring tear gas, water cannons, and worse, 
and have organized their communities, writ-
ten petitions, tried to stand for office, and 
volunteered for various forms of civic en-
gagement, and when the police attacked pro-
testers, other Hong Kongers stepped up to 
serve as medics, legal advisers, and liaisons 
to the protestors’ families: Now, therefore, 
be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) condemns the crackdown carried out in 
Hong Kong by the Government of the Peo-
ple’s Republic of China, the Government of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion, and the Chinese Communist Party 
under the illegitimate and arbitrary pretext 
of national security and notes that the 
crackdown violates the legal obligations of 
that Government under— 
(A) the international, legally binding Joint 
Declaration of the Government of the United 
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ire-
land and the Government of the People’s Re-
public of China on the Question of Hong 
Kong, done at Beijing December 19, 1984 (in 
this resolution referred to as the ‘‘Sino-Brit-
ish Joint Declaration of 1984’’); and 
(B) the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Spe-
cial Administrative Region of the People’s 
Republic of China, adopted April 4, 1990 (in 
this resolution referred to as the ‘‘Hong 
Kong Basic Law’’); 
(2) expresses solidarity with the people of 
Hong Kong, including pro-democracy advo-
cates, independent journalists, lawyers, peo-
ple of faith, and other targeted groups in 
Hong Kong; 
(3) calls on the United States Government 
to use all diplomatic means and economic 
tools available, including targeted sanctions 
and measures provided for in the Hong Kong 
Human Rights and Democracy Act of 2019 
(Public Law 116–76; 22 U.S.C. 5701 note) and 
the Hong Kong Autonomy Act (Public Law 
116–149; 22 U.S.C. 5701 note), to— 
(A) impose costs on Chinese Communist 
Party officials, officials of the Government 
of the People’s Republic of China, and offi-
cials of the Government of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region responsible 
for— 
(i) the criminalization of political dissent 
under the Law of the People’s Republic of 
China on Safeguarding National Security in 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Re-
gion (in this resolution referred to as the 
‘‘national security law’’); and 
(ii) the implementation of the national se-
curity law; 
(B) provide refuge and safe harbor to those 
Hong Kongers at risk for persecution, includ-
ing by designating such individuals as Pri-
ority 2 refugees of special humanitarian con-
cern; 
(C) demand the immediate and uncondi-
tional release of all political prisoners in 
Hong Kong, including Joshua Wong, Agnes 
Chow, Jimmy Lai, Martin Lee, Margaret Ng, 
Lee Cheuk-yan, Leung Kwok-hung, Benny 
Tai, Tony Chung, the Hong Kong 12, and all 
others who have been arrested or detained on 
account of acts of political expression or 
speech, and press for all charges against 
those individuals to be dropped; and 
(D) demand the revocation of the political 
oaths required of civil servants and can-
didates for district councilor and the Legis-
lative Council of Hong Kong, the reinstate-
ment of the previously disqualified members 
of the Legislative Council, and the revision 
of election laws to ensure consistency with 
Article 26 of the Hong Kong Basic Law; 
(4) calls on the United States Government, 
as it contemplates future bilateral or multi-
lateral agreements with the Government of 
the People’s Republic of China, to take into 
full consideration the fact that the Govern-
ment of the People’s Republic of China is 
failing to honor its clear obligations under 
the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984; 
and 
(5) calls on the United States Government 
to urge the International Olympic Com-
mittee to consider relocating the 2022 Winter 
Olympics from Beijing to another suitable 
host city located outside of China, on ac-
count of the flagrant violations of human 
rights committed by the Government of the 
People’s Republic of China and the Chinese 
Communist Party in mainland China, Hong 
Kong, the Tibet Autonomous Region and 
other Tibetan areas, the Inner Mongolia Au-
tonomous Region, the Xinjiang Uyghur Au-
tonomous Region, and elsewhere.

f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. 
CORNYN. 
Madam 
President, 
whether the administration wants to 
call it a challenge or a mess—or pick 
your word—a calculated word choice 
does not change the magnitude of what 
is currently happening on our southern 
border. 
Hundreds of unaccompanied children 
are being detained on a daily basis, 
completely overwhelming the capacity 
of the Border Patrol and Health and 
Human Services to deal with it—wit-
ness the two new centers opened up in 
Midland, TX, in West Texas, and a new 
one at the Kay Bailey Hutchison Con-
vention Center in Dallas that will 
house 
approximately 
300,000 
young 
men. 
At one point, there were more than 
4,200 children in custody, nearly 3,000 of 
them held beyond the 72-hour time 
limit set by the Flores Settlement. For 
comparison, there were about 2,600 
children in custody at any given time 
during the peak in 2019, so 2,600 now to 
4,200. 
In many cases, these children don’t 
make the dangerous journey north 
with their parents but in the care of 
human smugglers—coyotes, as they are 
called. Parents pay these smugglers 
thousands of dollars to bring their chil-
dren to the United States. 
In some cases, along that long, 
treacherous journey, whether it is from 
Central America or from Mexico or 
anywhere else—because these children 
are not just limited to Mexico and Cen-
tral America—these children are kid-
napped by the smugglers on their way 
to the border because they know hav-
ing a child in their custody will give 
them preferential treatment and allow 
them to stay in the country. Sadly, we 
know that, too often, children are mis-
treated, abused, or even sexually as-
saulted on the way to the United 
States. 
There is a lot of work that has to be 
done from the moment the Border Pa-
trol first encounters these children 
until they are transferred into the cus-
tody of Health and Human Services, 
but the Border Patrol lacks the phys-
ical space or the personnel or the re-
sources to provide this number of chil-
dren with the care and support they 
need and also to carry out their duties, 
especially during a deadly pandemic. 
On Monday, I spoke with the Border 
Patrol sector chiefs and the Office of 
Field Operations Directors from across 
Texas. We talked about the surge in 
unaccompanied children and the cas-
cading consequences this crisis has had 
on our other border missions. 
As Border Patrol officers encounter, 
transport, and care for these children, 
they are often invariably diverted from 
their job securing the border, and so se-
curity gaps are left along the rest of 
the border. This is not an accident. 
This is really part of the strategy that 
the human smugglers and drug smug-
glers have: flood the zone, preoccupy 
the Border Patrol taking care of chil-
dren, leaving gaps that can then be ex-
ploited, either by more human smug-
glers or by drug smugglers. 
We all know that large amounts of 
heroin, 
cocaine, 
methamphetamine, 
fentanyl, and the like come across our 
southern border. Ninety-two percent, 
according to the DEA, of all the heroin 
in the United States comes from Mex-
ico. 
So these smugglers and their really 
criminal organizations that ply in dif-
ferent 
commodities 
and 
different 
things, they flood the system to dis-
tract the Border Patrol and then ex-
ploit the vulnerabilities to bring peo-
ple, drugs, weapons, and money across. 
One of the Border Patrol chiefs told 
me that Customs and Border Protec-
tion needs to be able to identify and 
classify the migrants they meet, and it 
is being strained, which is impacting 
national security. For example, last 
Friday when I was in Carrizo Springs 
and in Laredo with my friend HENRY 
CUELLAR, a Democrat representing a 
border district in Texas along the Rio 
Grande, the sector chief told us that, 
just so far this year, migrants from 54 
different countries were detained com-
ing across the border in the Del Rio 
Sector. Now, I think that sort of gives 
you a better idea that this is not just 
a localized phenomenon; these are 
criminal networks with really connec-
tions all around the world. If you want 
to come from Mexico, for example, it 
will cost you a few thousand bucks. If 
you want to come from Central Amer-
ica, you pay a little bit more of a pre-
mium. If you want to come from Eu-
rope or a Middle East country, it will 
cost you even more. But it is only a 
matter of money because that is the 
only thing that these smugglers and 
these 
criminal 
organizations 
care 
about. 
But then people from 54 different 
countries, some of which are countries 
of special interest to the United States 
for 
national 
security 
purposes—54 
countries represented just so far this 
year in one sector, and I am sure the 
other Border Patrol sectors have simi-
lar stories. 
What is more, since October, the Bor-
der Patrol has encountered more than 
4,000 criminal aliens, nearly double the 
amount from the previous fiscal year 
in less than half the time. In order to 
qualify as a criminal alien, you have 
committed significant crimes, like as-
sault, battery, domestic violence, sex-
ual offenses, even manslaughter and 
homicide. Of course, these are just the 
ones we know about and who were ac-
tually detained. Many more—we don’t 
know how many more, but many more 
get through unobstructed across the 
border. 
While Border Patrol is overwhelmed 
by the sheer number of people crossing

March 18, 2021 
our border, including the alarming 
number of children sent by themselves, 
the Border Patrol isn’t able to properly 
surveil or apprehend potentially dan-
gerous individuals and substances. 
We 
have 
experienced 
migration 
surges in the past, most recently in 
2014 when President Obama called it a 
humanitarian crisis and then again in 
2019. We know how dangerous the jour-
ney to our border is for migrants, espe-
cially children. We know that spring 
and summer are often the busiest time 
periods. In other words, what we are 
seeing now is just a foreshadowing of 
what we expect to see in the coming 
weeks and months. 
We also know that these criminal or-
ganizations pay attention to what our 
leaders are saying here in the United 
States. Congressman CUELLAR and I, 
when we were in Carrizo Springs, were 
able to talk to a number of young men, 
teenagers, and asked how they heard 
about the border and their ability to 
get across. They said, well, they saw it 
on TV or heard from family members 
here in the United States or saw it on 
social media that now is the time to 
come, with a new administration that 
is not committed to border security, 
and so this was the time to make their 
run across the border. 
But these organizations do pay atten-
tion, and unfortunately the actions of 
the Biden administration not only con-
tributed to another surge this year, but 
they also made likely that it would be 
bigger than any other in recent mem-
ory. 
The President campaigned on poli-
cies that would lead to this very out-
come. After all, when you send a mes-
sage that migrants can come to the 
United States even with the flimsiest 
asylum claims and stay for years until 
they are resolved and don’t even really 
have to show up for their court hearing 
because of the backlog of 1.2 million 
cases in our immigration courts, what 
do we expect to happen? 
What the Border Patrol tells me is 
that this is a combination of push fac-
tors and pull factors. The push factors 
we are familiar with. Who wouldn’t 
want to come to the United States for 
a better life? Who wouldn’t want to 
avoid the violence and crime associ-
ated with some of the gang activity in 
Central America? We all understand 
that. But the pull factors are the sense 
that you can actually successfully get 
into the United States through illegal 
means or by making a false asylum 
claim and then overloading the system 
and basically navigate your way into 
the United States without any nega-
tive consequences. 
I believe we need to set up a system 
that honors and respects all legitimate 
asylum claims, but this isn’t it. We 
need to find a way to move the children 
and other people claiming asylum to 
the head of the line so they can present 
their claims to an immigration judge. 
But, as you can imagine, only about 10 
to 12 percent of the asylum claims are 
actually granted, and if your only con-
cern is making it into the United 
States, maybe you don’t want to go in 
front of an immigration judge. But 
then again, those who don’t, the immi-
gration judge, when their appointed 
court date comes, issues a default order 
of deportation. So if you had a valid 
asylum claim that would have been 
granted by a judge, you have lost that 
by virtue of your nonappearance at 
your hearing. 
Well, Secretary Mayorkas said we are 
on track to see the highest number of 
border crossings in almost 20 years, 
and I can’t say that I am surprised. 
There is simply no way to rewind time 
and prevent this crisis from happening, 
but it is absolutely urgent first that 
the administration acknowledge it and 
then work with Congress to address it. 
I would encourage the President to 
follow his own advice, which is to lis-
ten to the experts. The experts I listen 
to when I travel to the border are Bor-
der Patrol, Health and Human Serv-
ices, and the Office of Refugee Reloca-
tion. Those are the three Federal Gov-
ernment Agencies that deal with this 
crisis. I would be glad to welcome him 
to my State and introduce him to the 
dedicated men and women along the 
border who provide valuable services 
but who simply are overwhelmed and 
undersourced. 
The communities in which they live 
along the border are beautiful, vibrant 
communities with outstanding local 
leaders, but they also feel like they 
have been abandoned by the Federal 
Government. They are the ones who 
are disproportionately impacted when 
you see a flood of humanity come 
through their borders, and they try 
their best, through nongovernmental 
organizations or just out of simple 
human mercy and sympathy for the 
plight of these migrants, to help them 
any way they can. But they, too, are 
overwhelmed. They are doing every-
thing they can to manage the crisis, 
which they had no hand in creating, 
and they should not be expected to 
manage it without help from the Fed-
eral Government that is, indeed, re-
sponsible for our border. 
Law enforcement, mayors, county 
judges, 
nongovernmental 
organiza-
tions—I have a long list of folks that I 
would be happy to share with the ad-
ministration if they would be willing 
to listen. Indeed, one of the most sig-
nificant things I think that President 
Biden could do, like he did after the 
polar vortex, the big freeze we had in 
Texas, the 120-year weather event—he 
was good enough to come to our State 
and talk to the first responders. I think 
he would benefit greatly if he made an-
other trip on Air Force One down to 
the border so he could do what I have 
had the opportunity to do, and that is 
to talk to the experts and the people on 
the ground who understand this crisis 
and who have some, I think, very con-
structive ideas about how to deal with 
it. 
REMEMBERING ROGER SOFER 
Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, on 
another matter, nearly 20 years ago, I 
took my first trip to Israel. I had a 
good stroke of fortune: I met a bril-
liant, hilarious, opinionated, larger- 
than-life man named Roger Sofer. 
Roger was simply unlike anyone I had 
ever met before or anyone I have met 
since. He could captivate a room with 
anything from a serious discussion of 
national security and Israel-U.S. poli-
cies, to stories from his childhood, to 
jokes that, well, probably shouldn’t be 
repeated here on the Senate floor. 
Roger cared deeply about his family, 
his Jewish faith, and the many friends 
he earned throughout his life. I con-
sider myself fortunate to be among 
those friends, and I would like just to 
share a few words about my friend 
Roger, who passed away last week. 
As the old saying goes in my State, 
Roger wasn’t born in Texas, but he got 
there as fast as he could. The incred-
ible story of his life began in Queens, 
NY. It led him to the University of 
Tampa on a baseball scholarship as a 
left-handed pitcher and then to Fort 
Dix with the Army. He then went back 
to Florida, where he worked as a cab-
driver, home to New York as a sales 
representative, and then finally to 
Houston, TX, where he lived when he 
and I met. 
Clearly, young Roger was an enter-
prising guy. He understood the value of 
hard work, and even more importantly, 
he learned about the value of relation-
ships. Roger and his friend Dan Steiner 
started their own financial planning 
and insurance firm and quickly found 
success. 
Roger truly cared about everyone he 
worked with—his clients, his employ-
ees, and their families. 
That personal attention translated 
into a thriving business and a lot of re-
wards in recognition to go along with 
it. But Roger never let work consume 
his entire life or take away from the 
people and causes he cared most about. 
Roger grew up in a religious home 
and inherited a deep appreciation of his 
Jewish faith. His father Hyman was his 
hero and instilled in him a love of our 
country, as well as a love of Israel. 
Hyman would say, ‘‘Don’t worry about 
business, Roger, because if there’s no 
Israel, there will be no business.’’ That 
thought stuck. Throughout his life, 
Roger fought to secure a brighter fu-
ture for our friends and allies in Israel. 
In the 1980s, Melvin Dow and Stan-
ford Alexander, two giants in the 
AIPAC 
community—the 
American 
Israel Public Affairs Committee—asked 
Roger to help grow the pro-Israel com-
mittee in Houston. Well, I know Roger 
never did anything halfway; he poured 
his heart and his soul into outreach ef-
forts. When you have somebody as out-
going, passionate, and likable as Roger, 
you are bound to get results. 
Roger’s work in Houston was so suc-
cessful that in 2002 he was asked to 
serve on AIPAC’s National Board, a po-
sition he would hold for nearly two

decades. Lucky for me, that is how 
Roger and I ended up on the same trip 
to Israel in March of 2002. We visited 
Israel during the Second Intifada, a 
time of serious violence and unrest. 
Little did I know at the time I 
wouldn’t just look to Roger for insight 
during our trip; he would become a 
trusted friend and source of advice over 
the next two decades. 
Make no mistake, I wasn’t the only 
one who learned from Roger. As a 
member of AIPAC’s National Board, he 
would make almost monthly trips to 
Washington, DC—often with a group of 
Texans—to advocate for a strong fu-
ture and a strong U.S.-Israel relation-
ship. 
Teddy Roosevelt once said, ‘‘Nobody 
cares how much you know until they 
know how much you care.’’ It only 
took a few words to realize how much 
Roger knew because you also saw how 
much he cared. He cared deeply about 
Israel, its people, and its success, and 
became a respected voice on the impor-
tance of a strong U.S.-Israel relation-
ship. He didn’t care if you were a Dem-
ocrat or a Republican—if you were 
willing to listen, he was happy to talk. 
But meetings with Roger weren’t lim-
ited to conversations about the Middle 
East or ongoing political tensions; in 
typical fashion, he peppered every con-
versation with a lot of fun too. 
It wasn’t uncommon for Roger to 
walk into a meeting with a Senator or 
a Congressman and show them pictures 
of his beloved dog, Ginger. It was even 
less surprising for that person to ask 
Roger the next time that they saw 
him, ‘‘So, Roger, how is Ginger doing?’’ 
He was a big animal lover, and along 
with dogs, his other great love, inter-
estingly enough, was horses. He loved 
the animals themselves, as well as the 
atmosphere and energy at horse tracks. 
He was such a great handicapper that 
Rice University sent a statistics class 
with him to a horse track just so they 
could see how he did it. 
Last year, just days after being diag-
nosed with a rare form of leukemia, 
Roger was able to witness the moment 
every horse enthusiast dreams about. A 
horse he co-owned named Tiz the Law 
qualified for the Kentucky Derby. That 
horse would go on to win the Belmont 
Stakes and place second in the Run for 
the Roses—one of Roger’s proudest ac-
complishments. 
Yes, Roger was a man of many tal-
ents: a left-handed pitcher, an expert 
handicapper, an amateur comedian, a 
skilled storyteller, and an effective ad-
vocate. Above all, though, Roger’s 
greatest skill was his ability to live 
fully and authentically. He valued his 
relationships above all else, and he 
could turn a complete stranger into a 
friend with just a few words. I believe 
our friendship was proof of that. 
Sadly, I, along with my wife Sandy, 
send condolences to Roger’s beloved 
family, including his wife Linden; his 
children, Nicole, Scott, Jennifer, and 
Rebecca; as well as his grandchildren, 
Elizabeth, Sam, and Beau. 
Roger lived an extraordinary life, and 
he leaves behind an unforgettable leg-
acy. I am grateful to have known this 
man. 
I yield the floor.

PERSONAL EXPLANATION 
HON. TOM O’HALLERAN 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. O’HALLERAN. Madam Speaker, unfor-
tunately, on March 17, 2021, I was unable to 
vote for H.R. 1651, the COVID–19 Bankruptcy 
Relief Extension Act of 2021. Had I been 
present, I would have voted in favor of H.R. 
1651.

CELEBRATING THE HERITAGE OF 
ROMANI AMERICANS 
HON. ALCEE L. HASTINGS 
OF FLORIDA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. HASTINGS. Madam Speaker, this body 
has long recognized the accomplishments, 
unique heritage, and rich diversity of cultures 
that make up the United States. 
Roma have been part of every wave of Eu-
ropean migration to the United States from the 
colonial period to the present day, coming 
from every part of Europe. There may be as 
many as a million Americans with some 
Romani ancestry, whether distant or more re-
cent. Roma enrich the fabric of our nation, tie 
our country to Europe, and build the trans-
atlantic bond. 
Few cultures are as geographically diverse 
as the Romani people. Romani people trace 
their ancestry to the Indian subcontinent and 
settled throughout Europe roughly a thousand 
years ago. In some places, Roma were sub-
ject to expulsion or arrest solely because of 
their ethnicity. In the Wallachian and Moldovan 
principalities, Roma were enslaved by the 
crown, nobility, and monasteries until the 
founding of modem Romania. Sometimes 
Roma were subjected to forced assimilation. 
Roma were among the many groups of peo-
ple that suffered at the hands of the Nazis and 
their allies during World War II. At least 
23,000 Roma were brought to Auschwitz; al-
most all of them perished in the gas chambers 
or from starvation, exhaustion, or disease. 
Some Roma also died at the hands of sadistic 
SS doctors, like Joseph Mengele, who per-
formed inhumane medical experiments on 
Roma. Approximately 25,000 Roma were de-
ported en masse from Romania to Transnistria 
by the Antonescu regime in 1942; at least 
11,000 of them perished. The Romani collec-
tive farms in German-occupied Soviet territory 
became Romani mass grave sites. It is esti-
mated that between 200,000 to 500,000 
Romani people were killed in death camps 
and elsewhere throughout Europe. 
As chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I 
have supported efforts to acknowledge this 
tragic past, including by ensuring that sur-
vivors and historians have access to relevant 
archives like those from Bad Arolsen and Lety. 
I’ve also ensured that Romani voices have 
been heard in the Commission’s work to ad-
vance safe, equitable, and inclusive societies. 
I welcome the groundbreaking collaboration by 
the FXB Center for Health and Human Rights 
at Harvard and the Voice of Roma to collect 
qualitative and quantitative data about the 
lived realities and challenges faced by Amer-
ican Roma. 
Today I am re-introducing a resolution rec-
ognizing and celebrating the heritage of 
Romani Americans. 
This resolution does four things. First, it 
celebrates Romani American Heritage. Sec-
ond, it supports International Roma Day and 
the Department of State’s robust engagement 
in related activities. April 8 marks ‘‘Inter-
national Roma Day’’ around the world and is 
a day to celebrate Romani culture and raise 
awareness of the issues facing Romani peo-
ple. Third, it commemorates the destruction of 
the ‘‘Gypsy Family Camp’’ at Auschwitz. 
Fourth, it commends the U.S. Holocaust Me-
morial Museum for its critically important role 
in promoting remembrance of the Holocaust 
and educating about the genocide of Roma. 
Through this resolution, we celebrate our 
shared history and applaud the efforts to pro-
mote transnational cooperation among Roma 
at the historic First World Romani Congress 
on April 8, 1971. 
I ask that you join me and cosponsor Chair-
man GREGORY MEEKS in supporting the reso-
lution.

CONGRATULATING THE FALCONS 
BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM 
HON. SCOTT FITZGERALD 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Hustisford Falcons 
High School boys’ basketball team for their 
record breaking and historic win at the Divi-
sion 5 state championship earlier this month. 
The Falcons convincingly delivered the pro-
gram’s first-ever state championship title. They 
kicked it off with a 26–5 run over the game’s 
opening 13 minutes and cruised to a 69–35 
victory at the final buzzer. When all was said 
and done, the Falcons finished the game with 
11 blocks against the Macks, setting a new 
record, and finished the entire tournament with 
15 blocked shots, breaking yet another state 
tournament record. This is a game that is sure 
to go down in the program’s history books, 
each player should be very proud of them-
selves. 
Hustisford is my very own alma mater and 
I’m proud of these young men on their victory. 
I applaud Coach Hopfinger and the entire 
team for bringing home the first-ever gold ball 
to add to the school’s trophy case. This team 
has overcome many obstacles in the face of 
the COVID–19 pandemic, but they persevered 
and brought home impressive hardware to 
show for it. Congratulations to the Falcons for 
their hard work all season. This achievement 
is well deserved.

weather the storms that come our way. 
I couldn’t be more thankful to represent the 
incredible people across South Dakota and all 
over the nation who work hard each day, not 
for fame, not for recognition or for money, but 
for the betterment of their communities. This is 
what makes America strong. I am grateful for

IN SPECIAL RECOGNITION OF TO-
LEDO BEING NAMED THE TOP 
METROPOLITAN AREA 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Toledo, Ohio, for being selected by 
Site Selection Magazine as a Top Metropolitan 
Area in the United States. Toledo has shown 
what a strong community with the ambition to 
bring new investment to the area can do to 
create opportunities for the metropolitan area. 
In order to be considered a metropolitan city 
for this particular award, the area must have 
a population ranging from 200,000 to 1 million. 
Toledo was selected for this award by Site Se-
lection because of the new business invest-
ments brought to the metropolitan area. In 
2020, Toledo had an estimated $2.2 billion 
worth of projects that are expected to create 
3,500 jobs. 
Fostering a cooperative environment be-
tween businesses and local government has 
resulted in continued economic growth in the 
area. Toledo has brought millions in invest-
ments from businesses including Amazon, 
Stellantis, General Motors, Libbey Glass, and 
many more. The great work that Toledo has 
done despite the COVID–19 challenge is in-
spirational and shows the incredible work that 
is occurring in Northwest Ohio. 
Congratulations to Toledo, on being named 
a Top Metropolitan Area.

IN HONOR OF THE LIFE-SAVING 
ACTIONS 
OF 
PAUL, 
PHILLIP, 
PATRICK 
AND 
BENJAMIN 
MOTYLINSKI 
HON. DEBBIE DINGELL 
OF MICHIGAN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mrs. DINGELL. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Paul, Phillip, Patrick, and 
Benjamin Motylinski of Dundee, Michigan. 
Their heroic efforts are worthy of commenda-
tion. 
On Sunday, February 29th Paul Motylinski 
was driving down Custer Road in Monroe 
County, Michigan when he noticed someone 
had fallen through the ice of a nearby pond. 
He responded quickly by calling 911 and 
phoning his brothers who were at his mother’s 
house nearby. 
Together, the brothers got a hold of a small 
boat to help get the victim out of the water. As 
two of them used the boat to reach the victim, 
the other two brothers used a rope to pull 
them all back to shore. 
The eighty-one year old man was taken to 
ProMedica Hospital in Monroe and is expected 
to recover fully thanks to the life-saving efforts 
of the Motylinski brothers. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join 
me today in thanking the Motylinski brothers 
for their efforts that saved a life. We are grate-
ful for Benjamin and Paul Motylinskis contin-
ued service to the Michigan community in their 
role as firefighters with the Dundee Township 
Fire Department and also to Phillip and Patrick 
Motylunski for rising to the occasion when 
lives were at stake. I am proud to commemo-
rate their efforts here today. 
TRIBUTE TO MRS. LOTTIE MAE 
SMITH 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Mrs. Lottie 
Mae Smith, a lover of children, an outstanding 
resident, and a true Christian spirit. Mrs. Smith 
was born in Lake Village, Arkansas, a few 
miles from where I was born, raised and grew 
up. Mrs. Smith like many others who grew up 
in rural Southeast, Arkansas migrated to Chi-
cago, Illinois seeking a better life. Mrs. Smith 
confessed Christ at an early age in Lake Vil-
lage where she was a member of the Wood-
son Temple Church. Once in Chicago she 
united with True Vine Missionary Baptist 
Church under the leadership of Reverend C.L. 
Cavers where she served on the Mother’s 
Board and the Pastor’s Aide Ministry. She ini-
tially worked as a Cashier at Market Basket 
Super Market but because of her love for chil-
dren she switched careers and worked as a 
Nanny for the rest of her career until retire-
ment. Lottie was a loving wife, mother, and 
friend. She married the love of her life Chuck 
Smith in 1972 and they were inseparable. She 
leaves to mourn her daughters Loretta K. 
Brady, Jovanda Schafrik and Charlene Mark-
ham and Godson Larry Young, a host of 
grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and friends.

HONORING LEONEL G. LOPEZ 
HON. FILEMON VELA 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. VELA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Mr. Leonel G. Lopez for earning the 
prestigious Eagle Scout rank from the Boy 
Scouts of America. Only four percent of Boy 
Scouts achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, which 
requires dedication, service, leadership, and 
integrity. 
A Brownsville native, Leo is the son of 
Leonel Lopez and Elia Cornejo Lopez. He is 
a proud member of Boy Scouts Troop 6 in 
Brownsville, TX and attends Veterans Memo-
rial High School. 
Leo has been very active with his troop, 
participating in many scout activities including 
camping, fishing, and hunting. Over the 12 
years that Leo has been involved with scout-
ing, he has not only earned numerous merit 
badges, but also the respect of his family, 
peers, church, and community. Most notably, 
Leo has contributed to his church community 
through his Eagle Scout project. 
I applaud Leo’s diligence to complete the 
lengthy review process that accompanies be-
coming an Eagle Scout. An important part of 
that process is completing a community serv-
ice project. As a man of faith, Leo chose his 
community service project with guidance from 
his church leaders at Holy Family Catholic 
Church, where he has been an altar server 
since he was eight years old. Leo’s project in-
cluded cleaning and repainting every guide-
line, arrow, and handicap marker in his 
church’s parking lot. Leo’s initiative to remedy 
this problem demonstrates his leadership and 
his desire to contribute to his community.

I proudly commend Leo for his achieve-
ments with the Boy Scouts of America. He un-
derstands the importance of commitment and 
perseverance, and I know that he will continue 
to demonstrate these qualities in his future en-
deavors. I ask my colleagues to join me and 
my community in recognizing Leonel G. Lopez 
and wishing him continued success as an 
Eagle Scout and in completing his final year of 
high school.

RECOGNIZING SOCIAL EMOTIONAL 
LEARNING DAY 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Friday, March 26, 2021 as Inter-
national Social Emotional Leaming Day. On 
the last Friday of this month, partners from 
around the world will come together to show-
case Social Emotional Leaming, or SEL, and 
promote the practice in support of their 
schools, organizations, and communities. 
SEL is the process through which all young 
people and adults acquire and apply the 
knowledge, skills, and attitudes to develop 
healthy identities, manage emotions, and 
achieve personal and collective goals, feel and 
show empathy for others, establish and main-
tain supportive relationships, and make re-
sponsible and caring decisions. 
SEL advances educational equity and excel-
lence through authentic school-family-commu-
nity partnerships to establish learning environ-
ments and experiences that feature trusting 
and collaborative relationships, rigorous and 
meaningful curriculum and instruction, and on-
going evaluation. SEL can help address var-
ious forms of inequity and empower young 
people and adults to co-create thriving schools 
and contribute to safe, healthy, and just com-
munities. 
The competencies of SEL develop through-
out our lives and are essential to success in 
our schools, workplaces, homes, and commu-
nities and allow individuals to contribute mean-
ingfully to society. SEL can be taught and de-
veloped throughout childhood, adolescence, 
and beyond. 
Supporting SEL is a wise use of public re-
sources, because there can be Iong-term so-
cial and economic benefits to society from the 
implementation of evidence-based SEL. I have 
seen first-hand the benefits of this practice on 
students in my Congressional District with the 
Warren City Schools. I’d also like to recognize 
SEL40H for their great work on this issue in 
Ohio. 
I urge my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing Friday, March 26th as International SEL 
Day.

Mr. HUIZENGA. Madam Speaker, I rise

HONORING BEVERLY ERSKINE AS 
IOWAN OF THE WEEK 
HON. CYNTHIA AXNE 
OF IOWA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mrs. AXNE. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor Beverly Erskine, the program manager 
of the VA Central Iowa Health Care System 
Women’s Veteran Program, as Iowan of the 
Week. Women are the fastest-growing popu-
lation within the veteran community, and the 
Women’s Veteran Program at the Central 
Iowa VA gives the heroines who served in uni-
form access to a full continuum of health care 
from primary care to mental health services. 
With Beverly’s leadership, the Women’s Vet-
eran Program provides critical services and re-
sources that help our female veterans lead 
healthy lives, including: inpatient medical, sur-
gical, and mental health care; physical reha-
bilitation; substance abuse treatment; longterm 
care and pharmacy services; and on-site 
mammogram services that offer 3–D imaging. 
Beverly and her team also arm program pa-
tients with helpful information and skills that 
they can use in their daily routines to better 
take care of themselves through the Whole 
Health Program. Mindfulness practices, yoga, 
and Tia Chi are just a few of the offerings in 
Whole Health to help female service members 
thrive. And to protect women veterans from 
potentially 
dangerous 
domestic 
situations, 
Beverly and her team provide careful, con-
fidential screening conducted by trained Inti-
mate Partner Violence colleagues. 
One of the most special components of the 
Central Iowa VA Women’s Veteran Program is 
the baby shower program Beverly and her col-
leagues facilitate each year. They invite 
women veterans who are pregnant, spouses 
of Veterans, Veterans who have adopted, and 
those who have had invitro fertilization to a 
special baby shower thrown in their honor. 
Attendees receive gifts, originally donated 
from partner organizations in Iowa, that help 
the expectant mothers prepare for the arrival 
of their newborns. The event is promoted dur-
ing Women’s Health Week and it offers the 
health care system to give back to those who 
have already sacrificed so much. As much as 
it makes the expectant moms feel special, it’s 
truly a highlight for Beverly in her work. 
Women’s History Month is an opportunity to 
highlight some incredible work being done by 
women for women in communities across our 
country. Beverly is a shining example of how 
empowering female leaders creates oppor-
tunity for our nation to reach its full potential. 
I will never stop fighting in Congress to ex-
pand opportunities for women like Beverly and 
those who served our nation in uniform and 
am proud to support programs like the one 
Beverly leads for our women veterans. It is my 
honor to name Beverly Erskine our Iowan of 
the Week. 
IN RECOGNITION OF ERNIE 
ROBERT YANKE’S 100TH BIRTHDAY 
HON. SCOTT FITZGERALD 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize Ernie Robert Yanke of 
Pewaukee, Wisconsin to celebrate his 100th 
Birthday. Mr. Yanke has lived a profoundly 
honorable life and lives up to the title of the 
Greatest Generation. His life’s work deserves 
recognition and reflection as we mark this im-
portant milestone. 
Mr. Yanke is a World War II veteran, father, 
husband, and beloved friend to many. He is 
best known for is tolerance, compassion, and 
optimism, although life was not always easy 
for him. Growing up, Mr. Yanke had very little; 
he was born to German immigrants in New 
Britain, Connecticut and moved from one 
crowded dwelling to another and often stood 
in long food lines for government issued 
cheese. Mr. Yanke often felt he escaped acci-
dental death through sheer luck, but he credits 
the Army with saving his life. 
During his time serving in the Army, Mr. 
Yanke led a decorated military career, rising to 
the rank of staff sergeant. He was part of the 
76th Division in Patton’s Third Army and was 
involved in the battle to rescue the besieged 
U.S. forces in the Battle of the Bulge. He re-
calls his hands freezing to the handle of a ma-
chine gun he manned atop a truck, firing all 
night to stave off the enemy. He was among 
the first troops to enter a concentration camp 
to provide relief to those held there. 
While in the Army, Mr. Yanke first met his 
wife Eileen Quillin at a USO dance. The 
minute he saw her, he told her he was coming 
back after the war to marry her. He did exactly 
that. Together, Mr. and Mrs. Yanke raised a 
wonderful family of four children in Wisconsin. 
Following his retirement, Mr. Yanke and Ei-
leen spent the 25 years in Port Charlotte, FL, 
and traveled all over the world. Today, he has 
two daughters, four adult grandchildren and 
numerous nieces and nephews as well as 
friends of all ages who he considers family. 
As he celebrates his 100th birthday, Mr. 
Yanke is still a picture of health and dem-
onstrating the core traits the Army taught him. 
Every day, you can find him doing his daily’’ 
1,000 reps’’ with his 1.51b weights. I join Mr. 
Yanke’s family in celebrating the 100th birth-
day of this remarkable man.

Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. HIGGINS of New York. Madam Speak-
er, I rise today to recognize a legendary foot-
ball coach Richard ‘‘Sparky’’ Adams, Sr. Mr. 
Adams was born March 24, to Lee and Jose-
phine Adams. The three-sport athlete grad-
uated from Silver Creek High School before 
majoring in physical education at Brockport 
State. After securing his college degree during

the Korean War, ‘‘Sparky’’ enlisted in the U.S. 
Naval Reserves and was assigned to the USS 
Randolph as a signalman. 
Rising to the rank of Ensign 3rd Class, his 
fourteen months on the USS Randolph came 
to an end in the summer of 1954. On returning 
home, Richard Adams began teaching phys-
ical education and coaching football as well as 
basketball at Monroe High School. In 1956, he 
started teaching physical education for the 
Kenmore public schools, started at Kenmore 
East in 1959, totaling 30 years of teaching in 
the Kenmore-Town of Tonawanda School Dis-
trict. 
‘‘Sparky’’ and Jean Rathmann met in 1955, 
married in 1956, and spent the next sixty-four 
years together until her passing last year. 
Their three children, Richard Jr., Penny Jo, 
and Amy Leigh, as always, took solace in their 
father’s weirds: ‘‘if you get knocked down, pick 
yourself up and try to do better next time.’’ 
‘‘Sparky’’ and Jean had connected imme-
diately; not only did they marry after ten 
months, but she became a frequent confidant 
for his coaching schemes. With the assistance 
of his wife and the legend Jules Yakapovich, 
Coach Adams became a legend in his own 
right when he concluded his high school 
coaching in 1977 with four consecutive league 
championships. 
His re´sume´ also includes hundreds of col-
lege athletes and college football coaching of-
fers. In fact, he would go on to coach Buffalo, 
Canisius, and eventually Buffalo State, where 
he paired with head coach Jerry Boyes to end 
his college coaching tenure like his high 
school career; the Bengals went deep into the 
playoffs and ensured ‘‘The Legend’’ went into 
retirement with a bang. He retired at age 70 
but continued his tour of local football teams 
as an assistant coach at Benjamin Franklin 
Middle School alongside his best friend and 
coach Lou Reuter. 
Coach Adams may have sparked many of 
his athletes’ and students’ careers, but the 
soon-to-be nonagenarian also molded their 
morals with his mentorship. The sailor from 
Silver Creek made such a mark that his name 
is now emblazoned on Kenmore East’s foot-
ball field—Coach Dick ‘‘Sparky’’ Adams Field 
will remind future athletes of the coach who 
cared more for character and confidence than 
championships. 
Richard Towne Adams, Sr. went by many 
names—Ensign to the Navy; teacher to his 
students; coach to his athletes; husband to 
Jean; and father to three. But perhaps there’s 
just one name that can encapsulate what he 
meant to everyone he met and to those who 
didn’t get the pleasure: Happy 90th to ‘‘The 
Legend’’ Sparky Adams.

HONORING THE MIDWAY BARBER 
SHOP 
HON. TED BUDD 
OF NORTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. BUDD. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
honor and recognize the Midway Barber Shop 
in Davidson County, North Carolina. After 50 
years in business, Midway Barber Shop saw 
its last customers on March 13, 2021. 
John Faust opened the Mid way Barber 
Shop in May of 1970 and Davidson County 
has been better off ever since. He had a tre-
mendous impact on the lives of those who 
came into his shop. John was a man of char-
acter that put family and faith at the center of 
his life. One customer remarked, ‘‘He wasn’t 
just my barber, he was my friend, my con-
fidant, and my encourager.’’ 
To Kent Phillips, he was a dedicated friend 
and mentor. John hired Kent in 1978 not long 
after Kent finished high school and Kent has 
worked at the barber shop ever since. Philips 
said of his boss, ‘‘In 38 years of working to-
gether, we never had a cross word,’’ he said. 
‘‘If you could not get along with that man, you 
needed to look at yourself in the mirror.’’ 
The Midway Barber Shop represented more 
than just a place to get a haircut: it was a 
community institution. In this business, people 
were more than just customers, they were 
known as friends and family. 
Madam Speaker, the Midway Barber Shop 
was a gem of Davidson County. Our commu-
nity is sad to see it go, but thankful for its 
years of service.

MSI STEM ACHIEVEMENT ACT 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I am pleased to introduce the MSI 
STEM Achievement Act, which is cosponsored 
by Mr. WALTZ. 
There is no denying the fact that our suc-
cess as a nation is closely tied to our capacity 
to build and sustain a highly-skilled workforce, 
one that is equipped to take on the pressing 
challenges of the 21st century and to maintain 
our leadership in the global economy. 
Today we are facing grave challenges on 
many fronts. We are battling a deadly pan-
demic and a severe economic downturn. We 
are racing to find sustainable sources of en-
ergy and working to mitigate the destructive 
impacts of climate change. We are fighting 
against attempts to undermine our democracy 
by threats both foreign and domestic. Our fu-
ture prosperity and security are further threat-
ened as competitors like China outpace our in-
vestment in scientific research and make rapid 
advances in critical technologies like advanced 
communications, quantum computing, and arti-
ficial intelligence. 
To solve these problems, we need a cadre 
of trained scientists and engineers pushing the 
boundaries of what we know and what we can 
achieve. We need computer scientists and 
economists, biologists and mathematicians, 
engineers, chemists, and social scientists. So 
far, we have gotten by with a STEM workforce 
that does not represent the diversity of our na-
tion. However, that is not a sustainable path 
forward. 
Compared with their proportions in the U.S. 
population, members of racial and ethnic mi-
nority 
groups 
are 
significantly 
underrep-
resented among STEM degree earners. Less 
than 25 percent of all bachelor’s degrees and 
9 percent of doctorates in STEM are earned 
by underrepresented minority students. De-
spite representing 18 percent of the U.S. pop-
ulation, just 9 percent of bachelor’s degrees in 
mathematics and physics are earned by His-
panics. In nearly all STEM fields, the propor-
tion of STEM bachelor’s degrees earned by 
Black students has either stagnated or de-
clined since 1996. Black students earned only 
4.8 percent of bachelor’s degrees in engineer-
ing in 1996. Today, that share is 3.9 percent. 
In the past two decades, representation of 
Black students among bachelor’s degree earn-
ers in computer science has fallen from 9.9 
percent to 8.7 percent. 
The challenges we face today demand a 
dramatic expansion of the STEM workforce, 
one that is inclusive of talented students of all 
races, ethnicities, and socioeconomic back-
grounds. Fortunately, the nation’s minority 
serving institutions (MSIs) have paved the way 
with proven approaches for the recruitment 
and retention of students from marginalized 
groups in STEM studies. The National Acad-
emy of Sciences released a report in 2018 
highlighting the outsized contributions made 
by MSIs, including Historically Black Colleges 
and Universities (HBCUs), Hispanic Serving 
Institutions (HSIs), and Tribal Colleges and 
Universities (TCUs). For instance, HBCUs 
make up only 3 percent of the nation’s col-
leges and universities, but graduate 28 per-
cent of African American students earning 
bachelor’s degrees in the physical sciences, 
26 percent in mathematics, and 25 percent in 
the biological sciences. However, these institu-
tions have been hit hard by the COVID–19 cri-
sis and more investment and targeted out-
reach is needed to enable MSIs to fully realize 
their potential to contribute to the STEM work-
force. 
The bill directs the Government Account-
ability Office (GAO) to compile an inventory of 
competitive funding programs at Federal 
science agencies targeted to MSIs and rec-
ommend steps for agencies to increase the 
participation and the rate of success of MSIs 
in these programs. The National Science 
Foundation is directed to support research to 
better understand the contributions of MSIs, 
disseminate and scale up successful models, 
and identify effective approaches to building 
the STEM education and research capacity of 
under-resourced MSIs. The Office of Science 
and Technology Policy (OSTP) is directed to 
issue policy guidance to Federal science 
agencies for outreach to raise awareness of 
funding opportunities and provide guidance on 
competing for funding. OSTP is also directed 
to develop a strategic plan to increase the ca-
pacity of MSIs to compete for federal research 
and STEM education funding. 
Our STEM skills shortage is holding us 
back. As Chairwoman of the Committee on 
Science, Space, and Technology I am deter-
mined to change that situation. The way I see 
it, we have two possible futures: one in which 
we rise to the moment and leverage all of our 
human capital, and one in which our capacity 
for innovation and our standing in the world 
continue to erode. I know which future I want 
to see happen, and I urge my colleagues to 
support this important legislation.

IN HONOR OF THE 50TH ANNIVER-
SARY OF DAVID AND DOROTHY 
WINEGAR 
HON. CHRIS PAPPAS 
OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. PAPPAS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to celebrate the 50th wedding anniversary of 
David and Dorothy Winegar, residents of Man-
chester, New Hampshire. 
The Winegars have shared decades of life 
and love together, meeting in the Biology de-
partment at Hofstra University in the late 
1960’s and marrying on April 12, 1971. Since 
that date, their family has grown to include two 
loving daughters and several beloved pets. 
Together, they’ve enjoyed many adventures, 
celebrated great achievements, and per-
severed through life’s challenges. Avid explor-
ers, the Winegars have embraced the arts and 
the world around them as they’ve traveled do-
mestically and internationally and have seen 
over 25 Broadway productions. They instilled 
a love for the arts and a sense of curiosity in 
their daughters, sharing an admirable love for 
both culture and nature. 
After raising their family on Long Island, 
New York, the Winegars chose to retire to 
Manchester, New Hampshire, where they 
have enthusiastically joined the community 
and made a home for themselves. Mr. 
Winegar retired from a career in international 
sales and marketing and now serves on the 
Manchester Palace Theater Advisory Board, 
while Mrs. Winegar retired from an illustrious 
career in education, teaching biology at both 
the high school and college levels. May their 
50 years of love and commitment continue to 
serve as an inspiration to us all. 
On behalf of my constituents in New Hamp-
shire’s First Congressional District, I want to 
wish Mr. and Mrs. Winegar a very happy 50th 
anniversary. I truly hope they enjoy a wonder-
ful celebration with their family.

STATE SENATOR AND U.S. AM-
BASSADOR 
H. 
DOUGLAS 
BAR-
CLAY FOR HIS LIFETIME DEDI-
CATION 
TO 
IMPROVING 
THE 
LIVES OF FELLOW NEW YORK-
ERS AND ALL AMERICANS 
HON. ELISE M. STEFANIK 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to honor former New York State Senator 
and former U.S. Ambassador H. Douglas 
‘‘Doug’’ Barclay for his lifetime achievements 
in both the private sector and public service. 
A New Yorker through and through, Doug 
dedicated his entire life to the people of New 
York State. While he was born in New York 
City in 1932, his parents quickly returned to 
Pulaski, New York in Oswego County and 
Doug became the 7th generation to live on the 
beloved family farm. Doug graduated from 
Yale University and Syracuse University Col-
lege of Law, subsequently practicing at an es-
teemed Syracuse law firm, now Barclay 
Damon, LLP, as a named partner for over 40 
years. He was elected to the New York State 
Senate in 1964 and served the people of 
Oswego County for 20 years, until 1984. Doug 
will always be remembered as a compas-
sionate and caring representative for whom no 
constituent’s concern was too small. He cham-
pioned meaningful legislation reform around 
criminal justice, court reform, housing, and 
economic development matters. From his 
years in the U.S. Army to the New York State 
Senate to his appointment as the U.S. Ambas-
sador to the Republic of El Salvador during 
President George W. Bush’s Administration, 
Doug’s positive impact and exemplary leader-
ship extended far beyond his cherished North 
Country home. 
Doug was an extraordinary leader in his 
community and genuinely cared for those 
around him. He offered sage advice to can-
didates seeking office in New York State and 
became a renowned and well-respected figure 
in the Republican Party. He and his wife, Dee 
Dee, were committed to giving back locally by 
raising funds for county emergency services 
and by supporting families with children with 
disabilities. The Barclays fostered a strong 
sense of service within their own family and 
Doug’s son, Will, has followed closely in his 
father’s footsteps. Will was elected to the New 
York State Assembly in 2003 and is now serv-
ing as the Assembly Minority Leader. Ever the 
family man, Doug was an integral part of the 
North Country community and will be greatly 
missed. On behalf of New York’s 21st Con-
gressional District, I am honored to recognize 
his remarkable leadership and life.

IN 
SPECIAL 
RECOGNITION 
OF 
FINDLAY 
BEING 
NAMED 
THE 
TOP MICROPOLITAN COMMUNITY 
HON. ROBERT E. LATTA 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. LATTA. Madam Speaker, I rise to rec-
ognize Findlay, Ohio, for being named the Top 
Micropolitan Community in the United States 
for the seventh year in a row by Site Selection 
Magazine. Findlay has routinely shown what a 
strong community with a commitment to pros-
perity can do through implementation of their 
renowned ‘‘Findlay Formula.’’ The city’s focus 
on this formula continues to pay dividends and 
serves as an example to communities across 
the country. 
In order to be considered a micropolitan 
city, the area must have a population ranging 
from 10,000 to 50,000. Over 550 of these cit-
ies were evaluated on business growth and 
economic sustainability. Findlay was able to 
secure this award for the seventh year in a 
row because of their focus on job creation, 
new construction, and capital investment that 
met Site Selection’s criteria. In 2020, Findlay 
had an estimated $150 million in capital in-
vestment, which contributed to the creation of 
1,000 new jobs. 
Fostering a cooperative environment be-
tween businesses and local government has 
resulted in continued economic growth in Find-
lay. Over the past seven years, Findlay has 
completed 200 projects and produced 6,000 
new jobs through an estimated 1.5 billion dol-
lars in investment. This success would not be 
possible without the partnership and coopera-
tion between the City of Findlay, the Findlay- 
Hancock County Economic Development of-
fice, the Hancock County Commissioners, and 
the entire Findlay community . 
Congratulations to Findlay for another year 
as the nation’s top-ranked Micropolitan Com-
munity.

FAREWELL TO AMBASSADOR 
KAZYKHANOV 
HON. STEVE CHABOT 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, as co-chair 
of the U.S.-Kazakhstan Caucus, I rise today to 
bid 
farewell 
to 
Ambassador 
Erzhan 
Kazykhanov, who will be departing the United 
States at the end of this month and has faith-
fully served as Kazakhstan’s Ambassador to 
the United States during the past four years. 
He will be greatly missed by myself and all 
who have had the pleasure of working with 
him. He has consistently shown a great sense 
of enthusiasm for the job as well as a deep 
appreciation for the importance of the U.S.- 
Kazakhstan bilateral relationship. 
Ambassador Kazykhanov is a career dip-
lomat who began his career in the Foreign 
Ministry’s Protocol-Political Division. He was 
Chief of the Division before being assigned his 
first international posting as first secretary/ 
counselor at Kazakhstan’s Permanent Mission 
to the United Nations in New York City, from 
1995 to 2000. He then returned home to 
Kazakhstan to serve as the Director of the De-
partment of Multilateral Cooperation from 2000 
to 2003. Following that posting, he returned to 
New York City as Kazakhstan’s Permanent 
Representative to the United Nations and as 
non-resident Ambassador to Cuba from 2003 
to 2007. 
Kazykhanov was then named Deputy Min-
ister of Foreign Affairs and served as assistant 
to 
the 
President 
of 
the 
Republic 
of 
Kazakhstan. In late 2008, he was posted to 
Austria to serve as Ambassador to Austria and 
Permanent Representative to international or-
ganizations located in Vienna, such as the 
International Atomic Energy Agency and the 
United Nations Industrial Development Organi-
zation. He held that position through 2011 be-
fore returning to Kazakhstan to eventually be-
come Minister of Foreign Affairs and an As-
sistant to the President. 
Beginning in 2014, he served as Ambas-
sador to the United Kingdom, and then pre-
sented his credentials as Ambassador to the 
United States in 2017. During his tenure in 
Washington, D.C. he has focused a great deal 
of time on expanding economic cooperation 
between Kazakhstan and the United States. 
He has travelled throughout the country meet-
ing with multiple American companies to high-
light opportunities for well-known U.S. brands 
and 
entities 
to 
establish 
operations 
in 
Kazakhstan as a gateway for new or ex-
panded access to Central Asian markets. 
Ambassador Kazykhanov has also played a 
crucial role in elevating the bilateral relation-
ship 
between 
the 
United 
States 
and

Kazakhstan. This commitment to a continued 
cooperation across multiple platforms was ce-
mented in the 2018 document, ‘‘United States 
and Kazakhstan: An Enhanced Strategic Part-
nership for the 21st Century,’’ which outlines 
the goals and priorities of the bilateral agenda 
and sets a long-term vision to support future 
cooperation. 
Ambassador Kazykhanov holds a bachelor’s 
degree in Oriental Studies from Saint Peters-
burg State University and a Ph.D. in History 
from Al-Farabi Kazakh National University. He 
has authored many articles focused on 
Kazakhstan’s foreign policy, economic diplo-
macy, and multilateralism, among other topics. 
He speaks Russian, English and Arabic, and 
has received numerous awards and recogni-
tions for his years of service. 
Both he and his wife, Danara, who have two 
children, will be greatly missed by the Wash-
ington diplomatic corps and by all who know 
them in Washington, D.C. Along with my fel-
low Caucus co-chairs, we wish them both the 
greatest success and happiness as they return 
to Nur-Sultan. And as the Ambassador pre-
pares for his new role as a senior advisor to 
the President, we hope that he will continue to 
emphasize the importance of the bilateral rela-
tionship between the United States and 
Kazakhstan.

CONGRATULATING THE RED RAID-
ERS BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM 
HON. SCOTT FITZGERALD 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Wauwatosa East High 
School boys’ basketball team for winning the 
Division 1 state championship earlier this 
month. 
What started as a nail biter with the Red 
Raiders trailing the Papermakers 27–26 at the 
half, ended with a triumphant turnaround by 
the Wauwatosa East team on their way to a 
62–44 victory. The Red Raiders shot an im-
pressive 71 percent from the floor in the sec-
ond half and finished at 55 percent for the 
game. This marks the Red Raiders fourth 
state championship win in the program’s 17th 
tournament appearance and their first appear-
ance in the tournament since 2008. 
I applaud Coach Arndorfer and the entire 
team for a terrific season. This team overcame 
many obstacles in the face of the COVID–19 
pandemic, but they persevered and brought 
home the win. Congratulations to the Red 
Raiders, or as they call themselves, the ‘‘band 
of brothers.’’ This achievement is well-de-
served.

OBITUARY: ARTHUR F. WALSH 
HON. TOM COLE 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. COLE. Madam Speaker, Arthur ‘‘Art’’ 
Francis Walsh passed away early in the morn-
ing of February 24, 2021 in Salisbury, MD. Art 
was a good man, a loving husband, a loyal fa-
ther, who loved his family and served his 
country and community. He had a great ca-
reer. He enjoyed life and a good joke. He 
made people laugh; enjoyed golf, children, 
and pets; and had friendships that lasted his 
entire life. He loved and was loved. His final 
days were difficult, but he slipped into the 
arms of God peacefully in his sleep and we 
are thankful. 
Art was born on April 13, 1942, to Marion 
Veronica Walsh (nee Kiernan), a mother of 
six, and Howard John Walsh Sr., a Deputy 
Sheriff and Detective with the New York Police 
Department, in the South Bronx neighborhood 
of New York, NY. 
He often shared memories of his carefree 
days of his youth playing stickball and ram-
bling around the neighborhood with his sib-
lings and hundreds of other Irish Catholics 
kids, walking home for lunch from P.S. 35, 
watching baseball at nearby Yankee Stadium 
and vexing the clergy of St. Angela’s School 
and Powell Memorial Academy. 
Art enlisted in the Marine Corps, trained at 
Paris Island, SC, then served in the Marine 
barracks at 8th and I Streets in Washington, 
DC, where he was meritoriously promoted to 
the rank of Lance Corporal and was selected 
for the Marching Twenty-Four unit, performing 
silent precision exhibition drills. As a member 
of the Marine Corps Honor Guard, Art served 
presidential support duty for President John F. 
Kennedy. 
Art then completed six years in the Marine 
Reserves and joined the New York Telephone 
Company, where he built a 30-year career, ris-
ing from an installer of rotary phones to a re-
gional manager overseeing fiber optic cable 
and high-speed internet. 
With his first wife, Barbara, Art enjoyed 
many nights bowling, gathering with friends 
and having fun throughout McLean Avenue in 
Yonkers and all over Manhattan. Together, 
they moved to the mountains of Ringwood, 
NJ. He participated in that community as a 
member of the Knights of Columbus, local Re-
publican politics, the Ringwood Board of 
Health and St. Catherine’s Parish. His home 
and pool offered summers away from the city 
for his sister-in-law Georgann, nieces Steph-
anie and Donna and nearly nephew Eddie. He 
loved people and wanted to help improve their 
quality of life. Art’s large family circle included 
step-nieces, 
ex-sister-in-laws, 
childrens’ 
friends, and friends held as family. 
Art was a wonderful father to Brian and An-
drea and dearly loved sister-in-law Georgann. 
He played, explored the woods and laughed. 
He hosted swim lessons, went to little league 
games and daddy-daughter dances. He made 
it possible for each, plus six step-grand-
children, to graduate college, pursue success-
ful careers and begin families of their own. He 
taught us to help others, to apply our capable 
hands to any problem we faced, to work hard, 
listen, look others in the eye and give respect 
to all the people you encounter in this world. 
Art was blessed to find great happiness in 
retirement with his wife Carole Benner Walsh, 
moving to the Eastern Shore of MD, where 
they enjoyed 20 years of fun. Together, Art 
and Carole traveled, played golf and cele-
brated with friends and enjoyed the beaches 
of Maryland, their dog Charlie, and life as 
grandparents to their expanded family. 
Many thanks go to the care providers at 
Lakeside at Mallard Landing for their kindness, 
care and loyalty throughout the last two dif-
ficult years. 
So, raise a glass, say a prayer and give 
thanks to a good man, a Marine, a son, a 
brother, a father, a husband, a grandfather, a 
friend . . . to a life well lived . . . and, to 
quote Art, ‘‘keep smilin’’. 
Art is survived by his wife Carole Benner 
Walsh; children Brian O. Walsh (and Natasha) 
and Andrea Walsh Silva (and Nicholas); his 
sister-in-law Georgann Russo, step-children 
Jeffrey D. Benner (and Rochelle) and Cheryl 
Oursler (and George), and his siblings Howard 
Jr., Virginia, and Maureen Walsh and was pre-
deceased by siblings Patrick and Loraine. Nu-
merous multigenerational nieces and neph-
ews; and his four grandchildren and six step- 
grandchildren that brought him great joy will 
sadly miss him.

14, 2021 at the age of 84. 
Ray Kapper dedicated his professional ca-
reer to serving his community. Whether serv-
ing the citizens of the City of Akron as an 
elected official or young men and women as 
a coach and administrator, he put the greater- 
good above his own aspirations. 
He began his professional career as the 
athletic director for the Catholic Youth Organi-
zation and as head football coach at St. 
Mary’s High School before moving on to the 
Firestone Tire & Rubber Company where he 
served as employee activities director. Mr. 
Kapper was elected to serve the City of Akron 
first as a ward councilman and then as coun-
cilman at-large. He ultimately was elected by 
his peers to serve as the president of the 
council. 
In 1984, Ray was appointed to serve as 
service director. In that position he oversaw 
the City of Akron’s Engineering Bureau, the 
Public Works Bureau, the Sewer Bureau, and 
the Water Bureau. Mr. Kapper retired from the 
City of Akron in 1992. 
In retirement, Ray continued to work in the 
community and support the causes that were 
most important to him. He was especially 
proud of his work with The First Tee of Akron, 
a youth mentoring program that provides edu-
cational programs that build character and in-
still life-enhancing values through the game of 
golf. He most enjoyed time spent with family 
and friends and cheering on his beloved New 
York Yankees. 
Mr. Kapper is survived by his loving and de-
voted wife of 63 years, Barbara; his children,

REMOVING 
THE 
DEADLINE 
FOR 
THE 
RATIFICATION 
OF 
THE 
EQUAL RIGHTS AMENDMENT 
SPEECH OF 
HON. ROBERT C. ‘‘BOBBY’’ SCOTT 
OF VIRGINIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Wednesday, March 17, 2021 
Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I rise in support of 
equality and the principle that our Constitution 
was designed, not to shore up the dominance 
of the historically powerful, but to ensure the 
rights of all and to foster a society in which 
each of us is free to shape our future based 
on our abilities. The resolution today seeks to 
remove the deadline Congress put in place for 
the ratification of the Equal Rights Amend-
ment. While ratification of the Equal Rights 
Amendment is imperative to enshrine equal 
rights for women, I do not believe it is nec-
essary to strike the deadline for ratification. 
However, by voting on this legislation, we may 
imply that it is necessary for Congress to lift 
a self-imposed deadline in order for the ratifi-
cation to be effective. I do not prescribe to this 
view. 
Congressional authority to propose Amend-
ments to the Constitution and the mode of rati-
fication is outlined in Article V of the Constitu-
tion. Article V requires two-thirds of the House 
and Senate to propose an amendment. Con-
gress can choose ratification through three- 
fourths of the state legislatures or state ratify-
ing conventions. Once the amendment is pro-
posed to the states, there is no Constitu-
tionally imposed time limit on the ratification 
process. Article V of the Constitution is silent 
with regard to when a state must consider and 
ratify an amendment. In fact, the ratification 
process for the 27th Amendment took more 
than two hundred years. 
Historically, Congress has ratified amend-
ments without specific time limitations. The 
first amendment to contain a time limit was the 
18th Amendment, which established the prohi-
bition of alcohol. The text of the 18th, 20th, 
21st, and 22nd Amendments each contained 
language limiting the time frame for ratifica-
tion. In contrast, the text of the Equal Rights 
Amendment ratified by the states does not 
contain a time limit. It is the proposing clause 
sent to the states for ratification of the Equal 
Rights Amendment which contains a seven- 
year time limitation. Notwithstanding a lower 
district court ruling to the contrary, the lan-
guage of a proposing clause is not legally 
binding. The ratification process of the Equal 
Rights Amendment was properly before the 
states and was reasonable and sufficiently 
contemporaneous. Therefore, having been 
ratified by Virginia and a sufficient number of 
other states pursuant to Article V, the ERA, in 
my judgement, has become part of the Con-
stitution. 
This resolution is unlikely to add to the argu-
ment that the ERA has been ratified, and, be-
cause it implies that the deadline needs to be 
removed, it may strengthen arguments against 
because if the deadline is binding, then pas-
sage of this resolution in the House, without 
passage in the Senate, certainly does not cure 
that defect. And even with Senate concur-
rence, the effect of the resolution on state rati-
fications between the deadline and the re-
moval of the deadline is unclear. So the pas-
sage of the resolution in the House and Sen-
ate will at best add confusion to the debate 
and at worst will strengthen arguments against 
the conclusion that the ERA has been ratified. 
Nevertheless, forced with a vote, it makes 
more sense to vote in favor than to oppose 
the resolution. 
Regardless of the outcome of this resolution 
on the ERA itself, the fight for equality must 
continue. Women still face hurdles in the path-
ways to success. On average, women still 
earn less than men for the same job functions. 
Pregnant women often lack basic protections 
and reasonable accommodation in the work-
place. Perhaps most concerning of all, vio-
lence against women is still widespread and 
undermines the educational and social poten-
tial of women and young children in this coun-
try. 
I am proud to have worked with my Demo-
cratic colleagues in the House to pass legisla-
tion to remedy these inequalities. The House 
recently passed the Protect the Right to Orga-
nize Act (H.R. 842) which protects workers 
who are trying to form a union. While in most 
of America, women earn less than men, 
women and men working under a union con-
tract receive equal pay for equal work. We 
have worked to fill the gaps in the patchwork 
of existing laws governing how and when 
workers take time off to care for themselves 
and their families. Expanding the Family and 
Medical Leave Act to cover more working par-
ents and low wage workers who are currently 
excluded from leave policies is a top priority. 
There are other initiatives being considered 
to address inequities. Nearly two thirds of min-
imum wage workers in the United States are 
women. The Raise the Wage Act (H.R. 603) 
will raise the income levels of the most eco-
nomically insecure households and would be a 
step in the right direction towards pay equity. 
The Pregnant Worker’s Fairness Act (H.R. 
1065) is important legislation that will provide 
reasonable 
accommodations 
to 
pregnant 
women in the workforce. The Violence Against 
Women Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1620) which 
expands protections and provides critical fund-
ing for victim services, law enforcement train-
ing, and data collection, is now pending in 
Congress. 
However, even if all this legislation were to 
become law, it would not be the same as 
amending 
the 
Constitution 
to 
guarantee 
women equal rights. Discrimination in the 
workplace, violence in the home, and institu-
tional barriers require systemic legal and cul-
tural change. Ratification of the Equal Rights 
Amendment provides an additional legal tool 
for combatting discrimination on the basis of 
sex. 
We will continue the fight for equality and 
work towards a more inclusive and equitable 
society.

HERMAN ROBERTS—BLACK BUSI-
NESSMAN, CIVIC LEADER, CHI-
CAGO ICON 
HON. DANNY K. DAVIS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam 
Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to one of Chi-
cago’s brightest lights who recently passed 
away at the age of 97, Mr. Herman Roberts. 
The Chicago Sun-Times wrote that Herman 
Roberts came to Chicago with nothing during 
the ‘‘Great Migration and ended up a tycoon’’. 
At one time or another he owned 35 taxis, 
eight motels, a nightclub, which swung with 
some of the world’s greatest stars, a bowling 
alley, a skating rink, and oil wells on a 2000- 
acre ranch in Oklahoma. Mr. Roberts grew up 
as one of six children in Beggs, Oklahoma, 
around his age of about 12 his family moved 
to Chicago where he went to Burke Elemen-
tary and Englewood High School on the south-
side of the city. After high school he went into 
the taxicab business and built a fleet in the 
Black Community when and where white 
owned cabs usually would not transport Black 
patrons. In the early 1950’s he opened his first 
lounge, the Lucky Spot and a few years later 
The Roberts Show Lounge in a garage build-
ing where he had once housed his taxicabs. 
Mr. Roberts was a genius at booking and 
showmanship. Stars like Nina Simone, Dinah 
Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Sammy Davis 
Jr., Jackie Wilson, Sam Cooke, Red Foxx, 
Moms Mabley, Dick Gregory and others were 
regular features. In 1960, he built his first 
motel on 63rd Street, then six more. In 1974, 
he installed a removable stage in the parking 
lot and brought in stars like Count Basie, Billy 
Eckstine, Ramsey Lewis, Della Reese and 
Nipsey Russell to name a few. Mr. Roberts did 
not only spend time looking after his business 
in Chicago; but also spent time at the ranch in 
Oklahoma. At its peak his ranch had several 
oil wells, 100 horses, pigs, French breed of 
cattle and peacocks. In addition to everything 
else that Mr. Roberts was and did, the Rob-
erts Motel 500 Room was a major launching 
pad for the official kick off of The Harold 
Washington 
Campaign 
for 
Mayor 
which 
changed Chicago Politics forever. I say con-
gratulations to Mr. Herman Roberts on all his 
outstanding achievements and thanks to his 
children and grandchildren for keeping his leg-
acy and spirit alive, especially to his daughter 
Sharla Roberts, Director of Procurement Di-
versity at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

CONGRATULATING THE PIRATES 
BOYS BASKETBALL TEAM 
HON. SCOTT FITZGERALD 
OF WISCONSIN 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize the Pewaukee Pirates High 
School boys’ basketball team for winning the 
Division 2 state championship earlier this 
month. 
In the state championship game, the Pirates 
played incredibly well, never once trailing in 
the contest as they raced out of the gate with 
an eight-point lead. They hit shot after shot as 
they built on their lead. The Pirates closed the 
first half with an impressive 12–0 run on their 
way to a 54–37 win. This remarkable victory is 
the Pewaukee team’s first state championship 
win and their second appearance in the tour-
nament. 
I applaud Coach Burkemper and the entire 
team for their first state championship title. 
This team has overcome many obstacles in 
the face of the COVID–19 pandemic, but they 
persevered and brought home impressive 
hardware to show for it. Congratulations to the 
Pirates for their hard work all season. This 
achievement is well-deserved.

INTRODUCTION OF THE CONSIDER 
TEACHERS ACT OF 2021 
HON. ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON 
OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, March 18, 2021 
Ms. NORTON. Madam Speaker, today, I 
rise to introduce the Consider Teachers Act of 
2021, which would improve the service obliga-
tion verification process for Teacher Education 
Assistance for College and Higher Education 
(TEACH) Grant Program recipients. The Sen-
ate passed a version of this bill last Congress, 
and Senators MIKE
BRAUN
and KYRSTEN 
SINEMA are introducing the Consider Teachers 
Act of 2021 today. 
The TEACH Grant Program was created by 
the federal government in 2007 to attract the 
best and brightest to the teaching profession 
in underserved communities. The TEACH 
Grant Program provides up to $4,000 a year 
in grants to students who agree to serve for at 
least four years as a full-time teacher in a 
high-need field in a public or private elemen-
tary or secondary school that serves low-in-
come families. The obligation to teach four 
years must be completed within an eight-year 
period. Those who do not fulfill their service 
requirement but have been given grants have 
their grants converted into Federal Direct Un-
subsidized Stafford Loans, which must be paid 
back with interest. These loans cannot revert 
to grants. 
According to the Office of Management and 
Budget, 66 percent of the grants are con-
verted into loans. Though 21,000 recipients 
have completed the program without conver-
sion, 94,000 recipients have had their grants 
converted to loans. Those conversions are 
often triggered by small paperwork issues, 
such as submitting the annual form one day 
late or missing a date or signature. 
In 2018, the U.S. Department of Education 
(Department) released a reconsideration proc-
ess for recipients who had their grants con-
verted into loans but had either fulfilled, or 
could still fulfill, their teaching requirements. 
The Department also turned back the clock to 
allow teachers who left the TEACH Grant Pro-
gram once their grants were converted to give 
them more time to complete their require-
ments. These changes allowed the Depart-
ment to lift the debt of 2,300 recipients. 
This bill would codify this reconsideration 
process and mandate that the Department 
continue to implement it, creating a safeguard 
from changes in Department leadership. This 
bill would also outline yearly deadlines and no-
tification requirements to rectify some of the 
TEACH Grant Program’s previous administra-
tive mishaps. Furthermore, with the onset of 
the coronavirus pandemic, many recipients 
have had trouble finding qualifying work. This 
bill would create a grace period for these indi-
viduals by extending the fulfillment period by 
three years for anyone who was fulfilling their 
obligations when the coronavirus pandemic 
began. 
This past year has given us all a hard les-
son in the invaluable service that teachers and 
educators provide to our society. As many 
young students have turned to homeschooling 
and remote learning, we have all come to ap-
preciate the hard work and incredible talent of 
our teachers, who foster the mental, physical 
and emotional growth of our children every 
day. This bill ensures that that pipeline of tal-
ent for the teaching profession remains strong 
and that we do not unduly burden TEACH 
Program recipients, who have dedicated them-
selves to serving our most vulnerable commu-
nities. 
I strongly urge my colleagues to support this 
bill.
