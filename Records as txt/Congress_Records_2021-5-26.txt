PRAYER 
The Chaplain, Dr. Barry C. Black, of-
fered the following prayer: 
Let us pray. 
Eternal God, we boast of Your power 
and magnify Your Name. Although our 
Nation is beset with dangers, You re-
main our strong fortress. 
Lord, give our lawmakers the wisdom 
to seek Your solutions to the great 
problems they face. Remind them that 
more than human ingenuity is needed. 
May our Senators prove Your promises 
by faithfully and patiently trusting in 
the unfolding of Your prevailing provi-
dence. Give them a passion to turn 
from evil as they seek to glorify Your 
Name. Remind them that though the 
righteous face many troubles, You de-
liver them from them all. 
We pray in Your great Name. Amen.

REMEMBERING JOHN WARNER 
Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, we 
were greeted this morning by some 
very sad news, that our former col-
league Senator John Warner of Vir-
ginia had passed away at the age of 94. 
A five-term Senator, he was a con-
summate public servant, a consensus 
builder, an authority on military af-
fairs—one of the last World War II vet-
erans to serve in this Chamber. And he 
actually interrupted his law school 
studies to join the Marine Corps during 
the Korean war. The kind of stature 
that he had, his great, great reaching 
across the aisle in bipartisanship is 
something this Chamber misses, and 
we miss him. 
At my request, the flags around the 
Senate side of the U.S. Capitol will be 
lowered to half-staff in his honor. 
On behalf of the Senate, I want to ex-
press our condolences to his family and 
his friends and our gratitude for his 
amazing service to America through-
out his life. 
f 
ENDLESS FRONTIER ACT 
Mr. SCHUMER. Now, Mr. President, 
on the competition act, the Senate 
today will continue work on the bipar-
tisan U.S. Innovation and Competition 
Act, legislation that will supercharge 
American innovation and preserve our 
competitive edge, not just for the next 
few years but for generations to come. 
It will be true that our children and 
even our grandchildren will benefit 
from this legislation. 
Right now, this legislation doesn’t 
get the big focus of the press—A, be-
cause it is bipartisan; there aren’t too 
many clashes; B, because it is positive; 
and, C, because it is long term. It won’t 
have an immediate effect tomorrow, 
but it will have a profound effect 3, 4, 
5 years from now and generations after. 
So it is really important legislation. 
I think it is one of the most important 
things this Chamber has done in a very 
long time. And the hallmark of the bill 
has been its bipartisanship. It pulls to-
gether bipartisan legislation from no

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3468 
May 26, 2021 
fewer than six Senate committees and 
includes the input of nearly every 
Member of the Senate. The vote tallies 
you are seeing on this bill are from an-
other era, maybe the John Warner 
era—24 to 4 in the Commerce Com-
mittee, 21 to 1 in Foreign Relations. 
The Senate, as a whole, voted to pro-
ceed to the bill by 86 to 11. 
And the process here on the floor is 
no less bipartisan. I have heard it from 
Members on both sides of the aisle: 
Let’s try to do regular order. Let’s get 
on the floor and do amendments the 
way we used to. 
Well, we are doing just that. We have 
already considered 10 amendments— 
more than I can remember in a long 
time—8 of which were led by Repub-
licans. So it is hardly that the Demo-
cratic majority is only doing what we 
want. Three Republican amendments 
were adopted by voice vote last night. 
I mean, who would have ever thought 
that the Senate would adopt an amend-
ment from Senator RAND
PAUL
by 
voice vote? We did it. 
So, look, we are moving forward in a 
very bipartisan way. We will consider 
at least another three amendments of 
the bill today, and if both sides con-
tinue in good faith to schedule amend-
ment votes and debate, and there are 
no eleventh-hour decisions to delay or 
obstruct, there is no reason we can’t 
finish this bill by the end of the week. 
That is my intention. 
Taking a step back, the depth of bi-
partisanship on this bill reveals two 
things. One, Members want to work to-
gether if given a chance. This bill came 
through the regular order. Senate com-
mittees drove the process, and here on 
the floor, Members have participated 
in robust debate and a robust amend-
ment process. But, second, and maybe 
even more importantly, it reveals that 
Democrats and Republicans are united 
in our efforts to preserve and maintain 
American leadership on the world 
stage. 
We 
all 
know 
that 
investing 
in 
sciences, innovation, and technology 
holds the key to our future—the key. It 
has been one of the great hallmarks of 
America from 1950 on, maybe even ear-
lier, from Thomas Edison on, maybe 
even earlier than that. But today— 
today—we have let that lag. We be-
came far too complacent. The United 
States commits less than 1 percent of 
its GDP toward basic science re-
search—1 percent. That is the fault of 
government, but it is also the fault of 
the private sector. The world is so com-
petitive, and global competition is so 
severe. Companies feel they can’t in-
vest as much in the kind of research 
that might payoff profits 5 or 10 years 
down the road. 
So while all this is happening, the 
Chinese Communist Party spends near-
ly 2.5 percent on research and has 
pledged to the world that they will in-
crease scientific investments by 10 per-
cent in the future. If that happens un-
challenged, the days of America lead-
ing the world in science and innova-
tion, the days of America being the 
leading economic power of the world 
will be over, and we will regret it and 
look back 10 or 20 years from now and 
say: Why the heck didn’t we do this? It 
was so simple and easy. 
But we have to. 
I heard my friend from Illinois, Sen-
ator DURBIN, say that in 1990, the 
United States produced 37 percent of 
the world’s semiconductors—a tech-
nology we invented. Today, we produce 
less than 12 percent, and it is going 
down. 
Some 
have 
predicted—many 
have predicted—that at this rate, we 
will produce less than 6 percent of 
them a few years from now. If we don’t 
step up our game right now, we will 
fall behind the rest of the world. 
That is what this legislation is ulti-
mately about—righting the ship, in-
vesting in science and tech, so we can 
outinnovate, 
outproduce, 
and 
outcompete the world in the industries 
of the future, some of which we know 
and some of which we don’t even know, 
but we know that scientific investment 
will produce them. And if we are at the 
forefront of this, we will have America 
continue to be the leader in these new 
technologies yet unimagined. 
Around the globe, authoritarian gov-
ernments smell blood in the water. 
They believe that squabbling democ-
racies like ours can’t come together 
and invest in national priorities the 
way a top-down, centralized, and au-
thoritarian government can. They are 
rooting for us to fail so they can grab 
the mantle of global economic leader-
ship and own innovations that will de-
fine the next century. We cannot—we 
cannot—we must not let that happen. I 
do not believe we will let it happen. 
The bipartisan—the strongly bipar-
tisan—work on this competition bill 
has revealed that in this Chamber we 
still believe—Democrats and Repub-
licans alike, united and moving for-
ward—that another American century 
lies on the horizon. 
Let’s move forward. Let’s finish our 
work and pass the U.S. Innovation and 
Competition Act as soon as possible, 
certainly before the end of the month 
this week. 
f 
JANUARY 6 COMMISSION 
Mr. SCHUMER. On another matter, 
the January 6 Commission. Last night, 
I filed cloture on the House-passed leg-
islation to create an independent Com-
mission and report on the events of 
January 6. 
There is an obvious and urgent need 
to establish such a Commission. What 
happened on January 6 was a travesty, 
the culmination of months of delib-
erate lies about our elections, propa-
gated by the former President, a dis-
honest man, and his allies. 
The Capitol was breached for the 
first time since the War of 1812. Capitol 
Police officers were brutalized. One 
was killed in the attack. I shouldn’t 
need to remind this Chamber of the 
scene on January 6. We were all there. 
At one point, I was within 20 feet of 
these White supremacist hooligans. 
That day continues to haunt us. 
Faith in our elections, in our democ-
racy has nosedived. Listen to this. In a 
variety of polls, more than half of the 
Republican Party believes the election 
was rigged and Joe Biden isn’t the real 
President. That is a flashing red warn-
ing sign for our democracy. If the 
American people, if a large chunk of 
them believe the Big Lie, if the major-
ity of Americans believe that our elec-
tions are not on the level, we are on 
the road to ruin. This grand, beautiful, 
wonderful, several-century-old democ-
racy could teeter when people don’t be-
lieve it is fair, when people don’t be-
lieve the elections are on the level. 
All the fighting in the past, all the 
internecine fighting—I can’t remember 
a moment in history where people 
doubted the veracity of our elections. 
They may not have liked the outcome, 
but they believed they were on the 
level. We stop believing that and, be-
lieve me, it will spread. One side will 
feel that way one day and then the 
other side will feel that way the next 
day, and then nobody will believe in 
this democracy. 
But right now, unfortunately, there 
is a lack of courage from the other side 
when it comes to defeating these lies. 
Down the hall, House Republicans have 
started to make ridiculous claims 
about January 6—defending the mob, 
blaming antifa for the attack, pre-
tending the entire event was just a 
peaceful protest. 
Congresswoman 
CHENEY, 
a 
brave 
woman, was literally fired for saying 
that Joe Biden is President—for just 
saying the simple fact that Joe Biden 
is President. 
We need an independent, trusted, bi-
partisan Commission now more than 
ever. It is critically important to es-
tablish a trusted record of events and 
begin to restore faith in our democ-
racy. And I think our Republican col-
leagues know it or at least they used to 
because over the last few months, a 
funny thing has happened. Our Senate 
Republican colleagues have gone from 
mostly supporting the idea of an inde-
pendent Commission to mostly oppos-
ing one. And they can’t seem to get 
their story straight. 
Over the weekend, one Senate Repub-
lican told a national news program 
that it was ‘‘too early’’ to establish a 
Commission on January 6, even though 
more than 5 months have gone by. An-
other Republican Senator worried the 
Commission’s 
work 
would 
end 
up 
‘‘dragging on indefinitely.’’ 
Which is it, too early, too late? Of 
course, both concerns are silly. There 
is no justification for a waiting period, 
and the legislation itself includes a 
firm deadline for the Commission to 
issue a report no later than December 
31 of this year. 
One Republican said that he wouldn’t 
vote for a January 6 Commission 
‘‘until it was bipartisan.’’ Of course, 
the legislation we are talking about

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3469 
May 26, 2021 
was negotiated by the Republican 
ranking member on the House Home-
land Security Committee, the com-
mittee of jurisdiction; House Demo-
crats accepted every change requested 
by the House Republican leadership; 
and the bill received 35 votes in the 
House and, likely, a lot more if House 
leadership didn’t flip their position at 
the last minute. 
Despite 
the 
pressure 
of 
Donald 
Trump to go along with his Big Lie, 
35—35—House Republicans voted to go 
forward. They are brave, should be 
commended, and it shows that this 
truly is a national need, a bipartisan 
national need. 
Another Republican Senator, in wor-
ried tones, said the January 6 Commis-
sion should be more like the 9/11 Com-
mission and be chaired by outside inde-
pendent investigators appointed by 
both parties. Hello. I hate to break it 
to my Republican colleagues, but the 
legislation passed by the House is mod-
eled after the 9/11 Commission and, you 
guessed it, would be chaired by outside 
independent personnel appointed by 
both parties. They say they want that 
in the bill. It is in the bill. 
So what is really going on here? Why 
the various, shifting reasons why Re-
publicans can’t support a simple bipar-
tisan, down-the-middle, 50–50 Commis-
sion to report on a very serious event 
in our Nation’s history? 
Well, it seems the real reason has 
nothing to do with the structure of the 
Commission, nothing to do with the de-
tails of the bill. It all has to do with 
politics. According to POLITICO this 
morning, the Republican leader, Sen-
ator MCCONNELL, told his Members be-
hind closed doors that ‘‘regardless of 
tweaks to the bill . . . approving the 
Commission could hurt the party’s 
midterm election message.’’ 
Again, that is a quote from a report 
in POLITICO magazine or POLITICO 
newsletter—whatever 
POLITICO 
is. 
Let me repeat that. According to this 
report, the Republican leader of the 
Senate opposes any independent in-
quiry into the January 6 insurrection 
because he is worried the truth could 
hurt the Republicans politically. 
Look, I am sorry if an independent 
Commission to study an attack on our 
democracy isn’t the Republican ad 
maker’s idea of a good time. This is too 
important—too important. 
We cannot let the Big Lie fester. We 
cannot let faith in our elections con-
tinue to erode. We must get at the 
truth and restore Americans’ con-
fidence in this beautiful, noble, ongo-
ing experiment in democracy. 
The Senate will vote on the Commis-
sion. I hope our Republican colleagues 
rise to the occasion. 
I yield the floor. 
f 
RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY 
LEADER 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican leader is recognized. 
REMEMBERING JOHN WARNER 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, I 
was saddened to learn this morning 
that our friend and former colleague, 
Senator John Warner, passed away last 
night. 
By the time I arrived in the Senate, 
John was already churning a long wake 
as one of this body’s foremost voices on 
national defense. As a wartime veteran 
of the Navy and Marine Corps, he was 
deeply devoted to the men and women 
who serve in uniform. 
As a proud Virginian, John took seri-
ously his Commonwealth’s role as host 
to massive portions of America’s mili-
tary might, including the largest naval 
base in the world. 
As a former Secretary of the Navy, 
he brought Pentagon clout and tech-
nical chops that would help the Senate 
play a hugely consequential role in de-
fense policy. 
John’s career was capped, of course, 
by years as chairman and ranking 
member of the Armed Services Com-
mittee. But John made an even wider 
impact. My predecessor as chairman of 
the Rules Committee was a principled 
patriot across the board. 
He was also a truly old-school Vir-
ginia gentleman. John knew a thing or 
two about horseracing, for example, 
and that is high praise coming from a 
Kentuckian to a non-Kentuckian. 
Members on both sides of the aisle 
looked to John as a trusted mentor and 
friend. Our thoughts today are espe-
cially with our current colleagues from 
Virginia. So many Senators, past and 
present, knew John very well. 
Most of all, we are thinking today of 
his wife Jeanne; his children, Virginia, 
John, and Mary; and the entire Warner 
family. The Senate will keep them all 
in our prayers in the days ahead. 
f 
BUSINESS BEFORE THE SENATE 
Mr. MCCONNELL. On a completely 
different matter, today two Senate 
committees will consider and vote on 
two very different pieces of legislation. 
Over in the Russell Building, the En-
vironment and Public Works Com-
mittee just approved a bipartisan bill, 
led by Chairman CARPER and Ranking 
Member CAPITO, to invest in better 
roads and bridges for the American 
people. 
This would be the first major action 
on surface transportation since the 
FAST Act 6 years ago. It would raise 
the baseline funding for roads and 
bridges to an alltime high. And, as ex-
pected, our colleagues just reported 
this bill out unanimously, 20 to 0. That 
is legislating done right. Our col-
leagues are modeling the approach that 
would let Congress build a successful, 
big-picture infrastructure bill later 
this year. 
Meanwhile, in the Hart Building, the 
Finance Committee will spend its 
afternoon marking up a leftwing, par-
tisan bill written fully within the spir-
it of the Green New Deal: maximum 
pain for working American families in 
exchange for minimal—minimal—envi-
ronmental gain. 
Under the guise of Clean Energy for 
America, Chairman WYDEN is leading 
the charge against the most reliable 
and affordable ways to power our coun-
try. 
The legislation he has drafted is full 
of the sort of policies that would in-
crease the price of gas at the pump, 
hike the tax burden on independent 
American producers, of course, killing 
jobs, discourage the industry-led inno-
vations that have already been reduc-
ing emissions without hurting workers, 
and dragging the United States away 
from energy independence back toward 
reliance on imports from places like 
Russia, Venezuela, and the Middle 
East. 
In exchange, the bill would have ordi-
nary Americans subsidize the lifestyle 
preferences of wealthy people in places 
like New York and San Francisco. 
So one committee unanimously ap-
proved a smart, targeted, bipartisan 
approach to key infrastructure projects 
that America needs, and another will 
consider a partisan descendent of the 
Green New Deal that would raise taxes, 
probably raise gas prices, and leave us 
with a less and less reliable electricity 
grid. 
Really, this contrast is a fork in the 
road that the Biden administration is 
facing writ large. Which route to take; 
a lonely road leading to the far left 
versus a mainstream, bipartisan road 
leading straight ahead toward practical 
policies that make American lives ac-
tually better? 
The Senate knows how to walk that 
road. This last highway bill passed the 
Senate with 83 votes. Just last month, 
we passed a water infrastructure bill 
with 89 votes. 
If President Biden wants to secure 
lasting solutions, build a lasting leg-
acy, and improve the lives of Ameri-
cans in practical ways, he has the map 
in hand. For the sake of the country, 
let’s hope he and his party decide to 
follow it. 
f 
ECONOMY 
Mr. MCCONNELL. Now, Mr. Presi-
dent, on a related matter, the Demo-
crats’ far-left turn thus far has affected 
the entire U.S. economy, and it is hit-
ting working families right where it 
hurts. 
In January, President Biden inher-
ited safe and effective vaccines. He in-
herited a reopening economy and a 
country that was sitting on more pent- 
up savings than anything economists 
had seen in living memory. That was 
the condition of the country when the 
President took office. 
The Democrats have already dreamt 
up a massive, record-shattering Wash-
ington spending spree. Like one House 
Democrat admitted way back at the 
start of the pandemic, liberals saw the 
crisis as ‘‘a tremendous opportunity to 
restructure things to fit our vision.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3470 
May 26, 2021 
The Democrats had already decided 
to run up the American people’s credit 
cards no matter what. Their first pur-
chase was a $1.9 trillion excuse for a 
COVID 
bill 
that 
the 
Democrats 
rammed through on a party-line vote. 
Even 
liberal 
economists 
and 
even 
former advisers to Presidents Clinton 
and Obama cautioned that the Demo-
crats’ bill was way larger than the re-
maining hole in our economy, badly 
tailored, and might well cause infla-
tion. 
So everyone, from Republicans to lib-
eral 
economists, 
warned 
that 
the 
Democrats’ bad bill could easily cause 
inflation that would hurt ordinary 
American families. Well, look where we 
are today. Where are we today? We just 
got the most dramatic monthly infla-
tion report in over a decade. Ask any 
working family about gas prices, food 
prices, home prices, lumber prices, 
used car prices. One survey just found 
that more than 80 percent of American 
families are literally tightening their 
household 
budgets 
because 
of 
the 
threat of inflation. 
Yet the problem with the Democrats’ 
product wasn’t just how much credit 
and borrowed money it flooded into the 
economy; the problem was also how lit-
tle of substance American families got 
for the money. Larry Summers, former 
President 
Clinton’s 
Treasury 
Sec-
retary, put it this way—and this is the 
Larry Summers who also had a role in 
the Obama administration. 
Here is what he said: 
What’s striking about [that bill, the 
COVID bill] is that all of the trillions of dol-
lars—all of it—does not include a penny di-
rected at ‘‘building back better.’’ 
He continued: 
It transfers to state and local governments 
that don’t have any new budget problem. . . . 
It’s paying people who have been unem-
ployed more in unemployment insurance 
than they earned when they were working. 
It’s giving checks to families in the 90th per-
centile of income distribution. 
That is from Larry Summers. He is a 
Democrat. He is a friend of the admin-
istration’s. 
The Democrats’ hard-left turn has al-
ready hurt our economy, but they still 
seem to think that this massive bill 
should only actually just be the appe-
tizer. The administration has proposed 
a total of about $7 trillion of spending 
in its first few months in office. That 
absurdly overpriced COVID package 
would actually be the cheapest of the 
three massive bills the Democrats ac-
tually want to pass. 
For some perspective, about $7 tril-
lion is considerably more money in in-
flation-adjusted terms than America 
spent in fighting and winning World 
War 
II. 
The 
Biden 
administration 
wants to tax, borrow, and print more 
money than America spent on World 
War II to finance a grab bag of mis-
cellaneous liberal programs that would 
further jack up prices on the things 
families actually need to buy. It took 
less money to win a global war than 
these Democrats want to spend on a 
hodgepodge of stuff—stuff like electric 
cars and welfare programs. This is $7 
trillion of mediocre socialism and lib-
eral social engineering. No serious ex-
pert thinks this is what our economy 
actually needs. No wonder Larry Sum-
mers says he is concerned that these 
proposals are ‘‘substantially excessive 
. . . way overdoing the requisite re-
sponse.’’ 
The sooner this administration can 
get the memo, the more bipartisan 
progress we will be able to make, and 
the better off working families will be.

AMENDMENT NOS. 2014, 1710 AND 1911 TO 
AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the 
previous 
order, 
the 
following 
amendments will be called up and re-
ported by number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Illinois [Mr. DURBIN] 
proposes an amendment numbered 2014 to 
amendment No. 1502. 
The amendment is as follows: 
AMENDMENT NO. 2014 
(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate 
on the allocation of Special Drawing 
Rights by the International Monetary 
Fund to help other countries procure 
COVID–19 vaccines and protect against the 
economic instability caused by the COVID– 
19 pandemic) 
At the end of subtitle A of title II of divi-
sion C, add the following: 
SEC. 3219L. SENSE OF SENATE ON ALLOCATION 
OF SPECIAL DRAWING RIGHTS BY 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
RELATING TO COVID–19 PANDEMIC. 
It is the sense of the Senate that— 
(1) it is in the strategic interests of the 
United States to help ensure that COVID–19 
vaccines are available to other countries, 
particularly poorer countries with limited 
resources, not only as a timely live-saving 
and humanitarian measure, but also as the 
best way to protect hard-fought gains made 
against the pandemic in the United States; 
(2) the people of the United States will 
never be fully protected against the COVID– 
19 pandemic until the pandemic is also 
brought under control through vaccination 
around the world; 
(3) the release of Special Drawing Rights 
by the International Monetary Fund, as was 
done after the 2008 global economic crisis, is 
a no-cost way to help poorer countries pro-
cure COVID–19 vaccines and protect against 
the instability caused by a severe economic 
downturn; 
(4) helping protect against another global 
economic meltdown by releasing Special 
Drawing Rights is also a way to help protect 
United States export jobs at home, and why 
the move is supported by leaders of United 
States businesses and labor organizations; 
and 
(5) any allocations of Special Drawing 
Rights approved by the International Mone-
tary Fund to help with the purchase of 
COVID–19 vaccines and stem the worst eco-
nomic impact of the pandemic should in-
clude ongoing efforts to discourage countries 
that are allies of the United States from ex-
changing Special Drawing Rights for hard 
currencies with rogue countries and follow- 
up by the International Monetary Fund to 
audit how such allocations were spent. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. KENNEDY] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1710 to 
amendment No. 1502. 
The amendment is as follows: 
AMENDMENT NO. 1710 
(Purpose: To prohibit allocations of Special 
Drawing Rights at the International Mone-
tary Fund for perpetrators of genocide and 
state sponsors of terrorism without con-
gressional authorization) 
At the end of title III of division C, add the 
following: 
SEC. 3314. PROHIBITION ON ALLOCATIONS OF 
SPECIAL 
DRAWING 
RIGHTS 
AT 
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 
FOR PERPETRATORS OF GENOCIDE 
AND 
STATE 
SPONSORS 
OF 
TER-
RORISM WITHOUT CONGRESSIONAL 
AUTHORIZATION. 
Section 6(b) of the Special Drawing Rights 
Act (22 U.S.C. 286q(b)) is amended by adding 
at the end the following: 
‘‘(3) Unless Congress by law authorizes 
such action, neither the President nor any 
person or agency shall on behalf of the 
United States vote to allocate Special Draw-
ing Rights under article XVIII, sections 2 
and 3, of the Articles of Agreement of the 
Fund to a member country of the Fund, if 
the government of the member country has— 
‘‘(A) committed genocide at any time dur-
ing the 10-year period ending with the date 
of the vote; or 
‘‘(B) been determined by the Secretary of 
State, as of the date of the enactment of the 
Strategic Competition Act of 2021, to have 
repeatedly provided support for acts of inter-
national terrorism, for purposes of— 
‘‘(i) section 1754(c)(1)(A)(i) of the Export 
Control Reform Act of 2018 (50 U.S.C. 
4813(c)(1)(A)(i)); 
‘‘(ii) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance 
Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371); 
‘‘(iii) section 40(d) of the Arms Export Con-
trol Act (22 U.S.C. 2780(d)); or 
‘‘(iv) any other provision of law.’’. 
The Senator from Alaska [Mr. SULLIVAN] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1911 to 
amendment No. 1502.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Virginia. 
REMEMBERING JOHN WARNER 
Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise 
to mourn the passing of a statesman, a 
patriot, a mentor, a friend, and some-
one who loved this institution as much 
as anybody I know. It was the passing 
late last night of Senator John Warner. 
I am joined here by my friend of 39 
years—now maybe 40—TIM KAINE, and 
we are going to go back and forth a lit-
tle bit as we talk about someone who 
played an enormously important role 
in both of our lives, both, I can say, on 
a personal basis and on a political 
basis, and we will get some of the basic 
facts out. 
John Warner was 94 years old when 
he passed. He was born in Washington, 
DC, into a family from Amherst, VA. 
He joined the U.S. Navy at the age of 18 
in the waning days of World War II. He 
served from 1945 to 1946. He left the 
military and then rejoined the Marines 
in 1950, when the Korean war started. 
After he left the military, he worked 
for the U.S. attorney, worked in pri-
vate practice, and then got involved in 
Republican politics in Virginia at that 
point. 
I think Senator KAINE will probably 
speak to this. Being involved in Repub-
lican politics in the late fifties and 
early sixties was the progressive party 
in Virginia. 
He ended up serving President Nixon 
as Secretary of the Navy, and he was 
the head of the Bicentennial. Then, in 
1978, in a campaign that TIM will prob-
ably comment on, he got elected to the 
U.S. Senate, where he then served for 
five terms—30 years. 
John Warner was a remarkable guy. 
He was someone—and I say this, again, 
respectfully—who looked the part, who 
sounded the part. He could say things 
that, if they came out of my mouth or 
even somebody’s as eloquent as Sen-
ator KAINE, they might sound a little 
over the top. Coming out of John War-
ner, they always sounded senatorial, 
thoughtful, and pretty darned cool. 
How I got to know John was in really 
kind of an unusual way. I was a little 
bit active in Democratic politics in the 
late eighties, early nineties. Then I had 
the audacity in 1996 to actually run 
against John Warner. By the way, you 
know, John Warner v. MARK WARNER 
managed to confuse the hell out of Vir-
ginians. The takeaway from that cam-
paign—and TIM has had to hear this 
story many times, and John always 
used to tell the story as well—is that 
we had a bumper sticker from the cam-
paign that simply read—and it was our 
one good idea—‘‘Mark, not John.’’ It is 
the honest-to-goodness truth. 
I was down in Danville one day, 
which is near the North Carolina bor-
der, and got in the car, and somebody 
saw the bumper sticker as I was trying 
to shake hands, for I was not that well- 
known. He looked at me, and he said: 
Excuse me. Is that a biblical reference? 
There was no divine intervention. 
The right Warner won that race, and 
John Warner got reelected. 
The thing that I didn’t understand 
then but that I understand better now 
is, after you run against somebody, 
even in a respectful campaign, you bear 
some scars, some bruises, whatever. 
You know, I got really close to John 
Warner in terms of that race. I almost 
beat him. 
Afterward, I was thinking about con-
tinuing and maybe trying one more 
time, and I thought about running for 
Governor. John Warner was willing to 
become my friend. I got elected Gov-
ernor. He was a Republican, and I am a 
Democrat, and anything I tried to do 
as Governor that was hard, like a 
transportation referendum up here, 
John Warner was right there by my 
side, saying: We are going to do what is 
right for Virginia. 
We had a battle in which our budget 
was way out of whack, and I had a 2-to- 
1 Republican legislature. I can still re-
member sneaking him into the State 
capitol so the press corps wouldn’t see 
him, and he got up on the third floor 
where the press room was. In a Zeus- 
like moment, he said: Politics be 
damned. We are going to do what is 
right for Virginia. 
The truth was, we ended up fixing 
that challenge, and Virginia got named 
the best managed State and the best 
State for business, and we made record 
investments in education. I am not 
sure we would have gotten there if 
John Warner had not been willing to 
use his own personal political capital, 
but this was at a time when everybody 
was signing those crazy no-new-tax 
pledges, and John Warner said: Politics 
be damned. Let’s do what is right for 
Virginia. 
TIM will talk, probably, a little bit 
about this. I mean, his role as chair of 
the Armed Services Committee was 
legendary, and there is not a sailor, 
soldier, marine, or airman anywhere in 
Virginia—for that matter, anywhere in 
the country—who doesn’t owe a debt of 
gratitude to John Warner. 
I live in Alexandria, close to the 
river. I look out my window each day 
and see the Woodrow Wilson Bridge, 
which, for those of us who live in this 
region, was a big bottleneck way in 
decay. How John Warner got $1.2 bil-
lion for that bridge when it was way 
down the list in terms of getting refur-
bished was maybe a story that can’t be 
told on the Senate floor. 
As John got older, I always said—you 
know, as I had tried my one time 
against him—if you want to stay in 
this seat, I think you can stay as long 
as you want. In 2008, he decided he 
would go out at the top of his game. I 
would go see him, and I know Senator 
KAINE would, as well, to always ask for 
his advice and counsel. 
I have two more quick stories, and 
then I will yield to my friend Senator 
KAINE, and we can go back and forth a 
little bit. 
In 2014, I was so extraordinarily hon-
ored when John Warner—Republican 
senior Senator John Warner—endorsed 
MARK
WARNER
for the U.S. Senate. 
That kind of thing doesn’t happen in 
politics too much these days. I can re-
member, up and down through the 
Shenandoah Valley, there was one trip 
on which Senator KAINE and I were 
campaigning with John. He was, you 
know, at that point already in kind of 
his eighties, with a walking stick. Let 
me assure you, we had both been 
former Governors and both had kind of 
thought we knew our stuff, but when-
ever John Warner was in the room, we 
were the junior guys and followed his 
lead. 
As a matter of fact, in this last cam-
paign, where he endorsed me again, 
there was one fundraiser we went to. 
He introduced me. I did my little talk. 
Then he kind of took his walking stick 
and kind of whacked me on the shins 
and said, ‘‘Sit down, Mark. I’ve got 
some more to say,’’ and got up and 
spent 30-plus minutes telling old sto-
ries of how the Senate used to work. I 
have never been at a fundraiser where 
people got more of their money’s worth 
than that night.

John was also very, very disturbed 
and concerned about where our country 
was headed, the lack of respect for the 
rule of law, what was happening to his 
beloved Republican Party. But he al-
ways kept that burning sense of opti-
mism. 
I saw him 4 or 5 weeks ago, pretty 
frail, but he still, oftentimes with a 
pocket square and looking like he had 
just stepped out of a Hunt Country 
magazine, but he was asking about how 
we could get the Senate back on track 
and how we could always continue to 
put our country first. 
I want to say a couple of other 
things, but let me yield at this point to 
my dear friend Senator KAINE. 
We in Virginia were blessed, and our 
country was blessed, to have him, and 
I am going to miss him horribly. But I 
do know this much: When I am wres-
tling with an issue, I often will think: 
What would John Warner do? And if I 
follow that mantra, chances are I am 
doing the right thing for Virginia and 
the right thing for our country. 
I will miss him greatly, and I would 
be happy to yield to my friend and col-
league, the other Senator from Vir-
ginia. 
Mr. KAINE. Well, thank you. 
Mr. President, I want to thank my 
best friend in politics, Senator MARK 
WARNER. And I just realized something. 
John Warner defeated in an election 
my best friend in politics, and John 
Warner also defeated in an election my 
political 
hero, 
my 
father-in-law, 
Linwood Holton, who was Governor of 
Virginia from 1970 to 1974. 
So I want to talk a little bit about 
John’s effect on me personally and 
then also his great partnership when I 
was mayor of Richmond and Governor 
and into the Senate, and then I will 
hand it back to our senior Senator for 
his comments. 
When John Warner came out of the 
Pacific at the end of World War II, he 
went back to complete his studies at 
Washington and Lee. He was a surface 
ship guy in the Pacific Navy and went 
back to Washington and Lee in Lex-
ington. My father-in-law, Linwood Hol-
ton, was a submariner in the Pacific 
during World War II and also came 
back to complete his studies at Wash-
ington and Lee. John Warner and 
Linwood Holton, my father-in-law, met 
in 1946 at W&L, and they were part of 
the same fraternity, and John Warner 
used to always say that my father-in- 
law broke a paddle across his backside 
in a fraternity hazing ritual. 
But those friends began a friendship 
that went to 75 years—75 years of 
friendship. My father-in-law is still 
alive. He will be 98 in September, and it 
was 
an 
amazing 
friendship. 
They 
worked on projects together. 
As Senator WARNER mentioned, they 
had to build the Republican Party in 
Virginia. We were a one-party State, 
dominated by the Byrd machine Dixie-
crats, and they had to build the Repub-
lican Party with just a handful of oth-
ers. 
My father-in-law became the first Re-
publican-elected Governor of Virginia, 
elected in 1969, at the time that John 
was Secretary of the Navy. 
One day, a Navy ship, moored on the 
Elizabeth River, broke free and ran 
into and destroyed a bridge. 
And my father-in-law called: Mr. Sec-
retary. 
Yes, Governor. 
One of your ships has broken one of 
my bridges. 
They had so much fun together as 
friends. 
In 1978, they ran against each other 
to be in this body—a four-way Repub-
lican nominating convention. Neither 
of them won. Dick Obenshain won that 
convention. John Warner was second, 
my father-in-law was third, and some-
one else was fourth. 
Dick Obenshain was killed in a plane 
crash, and it was unclear how it would 
sort out and who would be the nomi-
nee. My father-in-law threw his sup-
port behind John Warner. John Warner 
got the nomination. John Warner ran 
and then became the longest serving 
Senator in Virginia history, with 30 
years. 
When I married Anne in 1984, I was 
adopted into the John Warner friend-
ship society because of being part of 
the Holton family. We were friends, 
and I enjoyed him. I admired him, and 
I saw his work here. 
I came into public life as a city coun-
cilman and mayor in Richmond, and 
John Warner: I have to produce for the 
mayor of my capital city. 
I was a young whippersnapper. I was 
mayor when I was—I think I was—39, 
and by now John Warner was in his 
mid-seventies, but he would produce 
for the capital city. 
And then, as Mark knows, because he 
had the same relationship when he was 
Governor—I was Governor, and I was 
about 45 or 46, and by now John Warner 
was nearly 80—John Warner had an old- 
fashioned sense: You do what the Gov-
ernor says. There are two Senators, but 
there is only one Governor. 
I treated him like he was the senior 
partner, but he kind of treated you, 
when you were Governor, as, sort of, 
‘‘Well, we have to produce for the Gov-
ernor.’’ 
We were working on the Metro Silver 
Line project, the rail to Dulles, and the 
project during the George W. Bush ad-
ministration 
was 
about 
to 
be 
unplugged from life support, after dec-
ades of work, and John Warner helped 
us get in and save that project. 
A tremendous friend, a tremendous 
supporter, but I will say this and then 
hand maybe to Senator REED, who 
might want to say a word, and then 
back to Senator WARNER, because I 
think Senator WARNER might want to 
be our closer here. 
I got to know a new side of John War-
ner when I came to the Senate. I mean, 
I felt like we were like best friends and 
family friends, and he helped me when 
I was mayor and Governor. I came to 
the Senate in 2013, and he had been 
gone for 4 years. But I started to meet 
people whom I didn’t know—John 
McCain and Carl Levin and JACK REED 
and so many others whom I did not 
know before I was here—and then I 
really learned about John Warner. 
I learned about his service as the 
chair and ranking of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee. I learned about the 
fact that he was always in the middle 
of whatever gang was trying to do 
something good. I learned about his 
love for this institution. I learned 
about his love for his fellow Senators. 
I was on a ticket with one of those 
fellow Senators, Senator Hillary Clin-
ton, and stood with John Warner when 
he came out to endorse us, and he 
talked with such depth about working 
together with Senator Clinton on the 
Armed Services Committee. 
I asked John Warner to come to 
lunch with me one day in the Senate 
Dining Room, and it was like I had 
brought the Pope in. I mean, we sat 
down and everyone—all the staff, ev-
erybody working in the Senate Dining 
Room, all the Senators and their fami-
lies—were coming over to talk to John 
Warner because they loved him so 
much. And one of the reasons they 
loved him is they knew how much he 
loved the institution. 
There is so much more I could say, 
but I just want to tell one more thing. 
John and I, at some point during my 
first term, were talking about the Sen-
ate, and we were both regretting that 
the Senate of today was not the Senate 
that John Warner served in—that the 
relationship-based Senate was turning 
into a more partisan Senate. And we 
were just being candid about that. 
But when we finished, John said to 
me: Old friend—old friend is what he 
would call you—old friend, that is the 
way it is. But it is not in the water 
supply, and it is not sick building syn-
drome. It is just in the character and 
priorities of the people who walk in the 
doors every day. So if you don’t like 
the way it is right now, guess what. 
You will walk in the Capitol tomorrow, 
and it can be different tomorrow if you 
try to make it better. 
That was just John’s attitude about 
this country and about this institution, 
and it leaves a big hole in my life. I am 
just grappling with the big hole in my 
life now not to have John Warner to go 
to and seek his advice. 
With that, I yield to the chairman of 
the Armed Services Committee, the 
Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Thank you very much, 
Senator KAINE and Senator WARNER. 
I am here today to pay tribute to an 
extraordinary gentleman, a great Sen-
ator, a decent and honorable indi-
vidual, the paragon of what we would 
all like to be—John Warner. 
John was someone who appreciated 
everyone, 
respected 
everyone, 
and 
treated people with kindness. He has 
monumental achievements, but at the 
end of his days, I think people remem-
ber him most for the kindness and the 
personal help that he gave naturally

May 26, 2021 
because he was an extraordinary gen-
tleman. 
He also was a patriot, not just in 
words, not wearing a lapel pin or doing 
something like that. He joined the 
Navy at 18 years old at the end of 
World War II because he wanted to de-
fend and serve the Nation. He didn’t 
get overseas, but in 1950, with the Ko-
rean war, he decided to drop everything 
he was doing and join the U.S. Marine 
Corps, and he served with distinction 
and left the service as a captain. 
So he knew what it was like to be a 
sailor, a marine, a soldier, an airman, 
and he never forgot that, and that 
molded his service to this country. It 
was about service. It was about sac-
rifice, and it was about protecting the 
other fellow and other men, and that 
was John Warner. 
He was bipartisan because, again, his 
focus was the country. It wasn’t party. 
It was principle and what is best for 
the country, and I think that dedica-
tion stemmed from the fact that he 
knew that all across the world, all 
through his tenure in the Senate and 
his public life, there were thousands of 
young Americans defending us, and he 
wanted to make sure they were well 
prepared and well protected. 
And as chairman of the Armed Serv-
ices Committee, he did that. He did it 
in an extraordinarily bipartisan way. 
He set a tone and a tempo for the com-
mittee that still is with us today, that 
is imbued in what we all try to do. 
Now, he was someone who had a spar-
kle in his eye. He always had a sense of 
humor, a sense of—I won’t say mis-
chief, but probably close to mischief. 
And I remember a specific codel he or-
ganized. This was his major codel going 
into Iraq in 2003, and, of course, it was 
bipartisan: 
Senator 
Levin, 
Senator 
CORNYN, myself, and others. We were in 
there because John had to see firsthand 
what the troops were experiencing, 
what he could do to help them, what 
we needed to know about the situation. 
Again, public service—even if it is in-
convenient—is something that he did 
constantly. 
But also he had, as I said, this sense 
of mischief and a twinkle in his eye. 
Now, as we flew out of Iraq, we had to 
find a place to spend overnight so the 
crew could rest. And John, being a very 
sophisticated gentleman, a former Sec-
retary of the Navy, knew that there 
was a nice place to spend a few hours. 
So we landed in Souda Bay, and John 
arranged that we would get on a bus, 
drive up to this beautiful restaurant 
overlooking the Aegean, and have a 
nice night of Greek food and fellow-
ship, bipartisan fellowship. You could 
tell he was enjoying himself because 
other people were enjoying themselves. 
We will miss him, and I just hope and 
pray that his example of thoughtful, 
principled bipartisanship is recognized 
and honored today, as it was when he 
was here with us. 
With that, I would yield to my col-
league. 
Mr. WARNER. Thank you, Senator 
REED. I see Senator THUNE is here. I 
will be very brief. 
You mentioned, Senator REED, about 
the occasional twinkle in his eye. I am 
not sure, again, here is the right time 
or place to tell the stories, but that 
twinkle really lit up when he would 
talk about some of his sailing trips 
with Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator 
Chris Dodd, usually also involving 
stopping at select locations, at selected 
moments in time. 
Mr. REED. Many of them in Rhode 
Island. 
Mr. WARNER. And many of them in 
Rhode Island. 
There are two other comments I 
want to make. One was, again—both of 
our political parties sometimes go a 
little bit awry. But one of the things 
that John Warner did—he didn’t need 
to do this. He was a sitting Senator, 
well respected, senior. There was a fel-
low in Virginia who was getting into 
politics who had kind of a checkered 
history. Sometimes, he was not nec-
essarily always willing to tell the 
truth. His name was Oliver North. John 
Warner did not think that Mr. North 
had the personal characteristics that 
ought to be in a Senator of Virginia, 
and at great political risk to himself, 
he was willing to make that known. He 
didn’t leave the party—his party—but 
said that, you know, the party, his Re-
publican Party, had to stand for prin-
ciples, truth, and respect for the rule of 
law. Again, it is an example of the 
John Warner that was so special. 
More recently, as Senator KAINE 
knows, we, in Virginia, have a very 
checkered history with race. And in 
the aftermath of Brown v. Board of 
Education, there were a number of 
school divisions that literally shut 
down rather than letting White chil-
dren go to school with Black children. 
And in Prince Edward County, in a lit-
tle town called Farmville, which was— 
a group of Black students had literally 
done a walkout, in their case, on the 
part of Brown v. Board of Education 
case. For a couple of years, Black stu-
dents had no place to go because they 
took the public money and put it into 
private academies, and there were no 
public schools, a great blot on the his-
tory of Virginia, leaving these young 
people—now not so young—when this 
issue came up about 2002 or 2003, with a 
big hole in their education. 
So we thought we could maybe end 
up providing these individuals an edu-
cation, give them a couple of years of 
community college education. It was a 
fairly audacious idea. The local editor 
of the newspaper there came up with 
this. And, at first, the legislature, you 
know, didn’t want to do this. They 
didn’t want to take this on. 
So John Warner got on the phone and 
called one of his friends, John Kluge, a 
very successful business guy, and said: 
Would you put up the money? It is only 
a couple of million dollars. And John 
and I worked out something, where we 
said: Let’s have Kluge put up a million, 
and we will go back to the legislature 
and shame them into doing the other 
million. 
And we did that. It was one of the 
most moving days in my life to see 
these individuals who had been cheated 
out of their education receive the abil-
ity to get an education. And John War-
ner never wanted an ounce of credit 
and, I don’t think, even to this day, 
that story has been told too many 
times. 
At the close of this, which is—I know 
I am not supposed to do this, but I will 
do this briefly. John Warner appro-
priately got recognized for his service, 
and there is a submarine named after 
him. And I remember going to the com-
missioning. He and his wife Jeanne, 
they were so proud of the young men 
and women who were serving on that 
boat and then carried on the kind of 
sense of patriotism and public service 
that he exemplified. 
As we have both said, we are going to 
miss him a lot, but I hope we will take 
that sense of his heart and courage and 
commitment and maybe rededicate 
ourselves to trying to follow that kind 
of example. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Re-
publican whip. 
Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, before I 
give my remarks, I want to echo what 
has been said on the floor here by our 
two colleagues, the two Senators from 
the Commonwealth of Virginia, about 
Senator John Warner. 
I would just say, too, that when I 
first got to the Senate, my first 6 years 
in the Senate, I was a member of the 
Senate Armed Services Committee. 
When I got here, Senator Warner was 
the chairman of that committee. And I 
had known him a little bit from a dis-
tance because I had worked as a staffer 
out here back in the 1980s, but I got the 
chance to know him in a very personal 
way as the chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee. 
And I have to just, again, associate 
myself with many of the comments 
that have already been made about 
him. He truly was a gentleman in the 
truest sense of the word—somebody 
who represents everything, I think, 
that is good about public life in politics 
and legislating and making public pol-
icy and cared profoundly and deeply for 
our men and women in uniform. 
As the chairman of the committee, 
that was his No. 1 priority. Of course, 
as has been mentioned, he was a ma-
rine and Secretary of the Navy and had 
just a deep, deep passion to make sure 
that the men and women who defend 
this country on a daily basis were re-
spected and had the resources, the 
equipment, the training, and every-
thing they needed to succeed in their 
jobs. 
So he truly was a—he couldn’t have 
been a kinder person to me. As a rookie 
out here, I remember I was standing 
over there offering an amendment to 
the Defense authorization bill. I think 
it was my first, probably, amendment

on the floor, and it was something that 
he, as the chairman, opposed. And he, I 
think, probably could have eviscerated 
me if he had wanted to, but he had 
that, as has been mentioned—he had 
that demeanor and disposition, some-
body described it as a twinkle in his 
eye. He truly had that. And he really 
was out of central casting. If anybody 
wanted to cast somebody, he certainly 
could have had a career in Hollywood 
because he looked the part. But it was 
more than just looking the part. He 
lived it. He was truly not only a gen-
tleman but a great Senator for the 
Commonwealth of Virginia and a great 
patriot to this country, who got up 
every day and thought of ways that he 
could make our country stronger and 
better. 
So my thoughts and prayers are with 
his wife Jeanne and all of his family 
today. 
AGRICULTURE 
Mr. President, the last several years 
have been difficult ones for cattle pro-
ducers in my home State of South Da-
kota and around the country. A 2019 
fire, and later COVID, caused reduc-
tions in meatpacking capacity, which 
left cattle producers with cattle to sell 
and no place to sell them. 
And even now, with our country well 
on 
its 
way 
to 
full 
reopening, 
meatpackers are still not back at full 
capacity—at least in part, it seems, be-
cause of the enhanced unemployment 
benefits the Biden administration is 
providing are not encouraging workers 
to come back to work. 
Throughout these challenges, ranch-
ers have struggled, but meatpackers— 
meatpackers have seen continued sub-
stantial profit margins. While cer-
tainly market forces can see the price 
for cattle fluctuate, the gap between 
meatpacker profits and rancher profits 
raises some questions, most especially 
because more than 80 percent of the 
meatpacking market in this country is 
concentrated in the hands of just four 
companies. 
That level of concentration creates 
the opportunity for market manipula-
tion. The gulf between rancher and 
meatpacker profits and the significant 
power these companies have over the 
beef industry has raised concerns that 
we are looking at something more than 
just an issue of supply and demand. 
That is why I wrote to the Depart-
ment of Justice at the beginning of the 
pandemic urging the Department to 
begin 
an 
investigation 
into 
the 
meatpacking industry to make sure 
that there was no market manipula-
tion going on. The Department of Jus-
tice responded by directing the Justice 
Department’s Antitrust Division to ini-
tiate an investigation. 
Well, that was a year ago, and since 
then, we have heard nothing. No re-
sults from the investigation have been 
released, and it is not clear whether 
the investigation is still ongoing. 
So, last week, I led several of my 
Senate and House colleagues, along 
with 
South 
Dakota 
Representative 
DUSTY JOHNSON, in a letter to Attorney 
General Merrick Garland urging the 
Department of Justice to continue in-
vestigating the beef sector to deter-
mine if improper and anticompetitive 
activity has occurred. It is essential 
that we hold the highly concentrated 
meatpacker industry accountable to 
consumers and producers who depend 
upon it. I will continue to press the De-
partment of Justice to thoroughly in-
vestigate this situation. 
Another important thing that we can 
do to help ranchers start to see better 
prices for their cattle is to encourage 
competition in the meatpacking indus-
try. As I said, more than 80 percent of 
the meatpacking industry in this coun-
try is controlled by just four compa-
nies. Encouraging more companies to 
get into this marketplace and encour-
aging small meatpackers to expand 
will dilute the power of these four com-
panies and create more competition for 
ranchers’ cattle, which will lead to 
higher prices for ranchers when they 
bring their cattle to market. 
That 
is 
why 
I 
introduced 
the 
Strengthening Local Processing Act in 
February with Senator MERKLEY. Our 
legislation would help strengthen and 
diversify national meat-processing ca-
pacity by providing new resources for 
smaller, more local meat-processing 
operations. 
Encouraging new meatpackers to 
enter 
the 
market 
and 
smaller 
meatpackers to expand their oper-
ations will provide livestock producers 
with more marketing options and thus 
increase competition for their cattle. 
Plus, spreading out and expanding our 
Nation’s meat-processing capacity over 
more plants will make our Nation’s 
meat supply less vulnerable to inter-
ruption 
in 
situations 
like 
the 
coronavirus pandemic or natural dis-
aster. 
During the pandemic, outbreaks of 
COVID at meatpacking plants seri-
ously compromised supply, as empty 
grocery store meat sections attested. 
Had meatpacking capacity been less 
concentrated, it is likely that we would 
not have seen such significant short-
ages. 
Last month, I requested that the 
Senate Agriculture Committee hold a 
hearing to consider the challenges fac-
ing the livestock industry, as well as 
the bills that have been introduced this 
year to try to improve the situation. I 
recognize that there are contrasting 
views among cattle producers on the 
best path forward to improve the cattle 
market, but I am hopeful that a hear-
ing would help lead to the passage of 
legislation that would improve the out-
look for cattle producers. 
I also recently introduced, along with 
Senator TESTER, an amendment to the 
legislation the Senate is considering 
today that would require the U.S. 
Trade Representative and the U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture to review the 
2015 World Trade Organization ruling 
that led to the repeal of mandatory 
country-of-origin labeling, or COOL, 
and identify how it affected U.S. con-
sumers, producers, and the supply 
chain. 
If the review finds negative impacts, 
the amendment would require the ad-
ministration to submit to Congress leg-
islative or administrative actions to 
address the impacts. I am a longtime 
supporter of country-of-origin labeling, 
and I have been raising the importance 
of this issue with the new Biden admin-
istration. 
I will continue working on a path for-
ward for country-of-origin labeling. 
There is strong demand for U.S. born 
and raised beef, and consumers want to 
know where their food is coming from. 
The least we can do for our ranchers 
and the consumers who depend on their 
products is to provide them with the 
benefit and certainty of seeing ‘‘Made 
in the USA’’ labels on grocery store 
shelves in South Dakota and around 
the country. 
I think I speak for a lot of Americans 
when I say there are few things I enjoy 
more than a mouthwatering burger or 
a really good steak. And there are a lot 
of men and women out there in South 
Dakota and across the country doing 
the demanding work of raising cattle 
so that the rest of us can enjoy our 
burgers and steaks and roasts. 
I am very proud to represent South 
Dakota ranchers here in the Senate, 
and I will continue to make it a pri-
ority to support cattle producers and 
make sure that they have fair and 
transparent markets for the commod-
ities that they produce. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Iowa. 
Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, first 
of all, I compliment Senator THUNE 
with his remarks and agree with every-
thing that he said and particularly to 
emphasize his call for a hearing before 
the Senate Agriculture Committee, 
something we have been trying to get 
done for a long period of time, and I 
hope that will soon happen. 
REMEMBERING JOHN WARNER 
Mr. President, secondly, I would like 
to follow up on the comments that the 
two Senators for Virginia made about 
Senator Warner. 
Senator Warner came to the Senate 2 
years before I did, and I remember him 
almost constantly talking about the 
No. 1 responsibility of the Federal Gov-
ernment: our national security and 
protecting the American people. And 
he was always, whether he was Sec-
retary of the Navy or whether he was a 
Senator from Virginia—he was always 
speaking strongly about keeping and 
making sure that our military was 
strong to meet its constitutional re-
sponsibilities. 
I also remember that he was a person 
that quite frequently would speak up 
in Republican caucuses when he had a 
disagreement with the leadership of 
the day or the position of the caucus 
for the day or maybe he would even be 
in the minority of the caucus speaking 
on something that he felt strongly 
about.

And I also remember his speaking in 
terms of—after Reagan Airport was 
shut down because of 9/11 and the con-
sequences that brought to the economy 
of Northern Virginia, how we worked 
so hard to get that airport opened up 
again. 
ANTI-SEMITIC HATE CRIMES 
Mr. President, the third and last rea-
son for coming to the U.S. Senate floor 
at this time to speak is to, like all of 
my colleagues would do, condemn the 
troubling increase in hate crimes, 
whether it is on any minority group, 
but today I come to the floor because 
of the recent attacks on Jewish Ameri-
cans. 
Anti-Semitism has been called the 
oldest hatred. Throughout the history 
of the Jewish people, they have been 
subjected to cruelty, discrimination, 
and violence. Even in modern times, 
even here in America, Jews are still 
not safe from this hatred, and that is a 
profoundly bad and sad situation. No 
Jewish American should ever experi-
ence bigotry based on their religion, 
nor 
should 
they 
be 
subjected 
to 
threats, harassment, or injury because 
there is a Jewish State of Israel. 
We can express disagreements about 
foreign policy and about conflict in the 
Middle East, but we should never allow 
those disagreements to become dehu-
manizing and abusive. Yet, in response 
to the terrible conflict in Gaza re-
cently, Jewish Americans have been at-
tacked in recent weeks. 
The 
Anti-Defamation 
League 
has 
said that the reporting of anti-Semitic 
incidents has gone up 63 percent since 
the start of the war between Israel and 
Hamas. 
In New York, two Jewish teenagers 
were surrounded by an angry mob just 
this last Saturday. The boys were told 
that they had to chant ‘‘free Pal-
estine’’ or chant ‘‘kill all Jews’’ before 
they were beaten and choked. 
On Thursday, a man wearing a 
yarmulke was beaten by a gang of men 
who chanted words like ‘‘Hamas is 
going to kill all of you.’’ 
In Los Angeles, anti-Israel protesters 
attacked Jewish patrons at a res-
taurant. The attackers reportedly said 
‘‘death to Jews’’ and ‘‘free Palestine.’’ 
An orthodox Jewish man was chased 
by cars flying Palestinian flags in an-
other incident in Los Angeles. 
I hope that we all condemn this hor-
rible wave of violence against Jewish 
Americans, but Members of Congress 
can do more to take down the tempera-
ture. We should never vilify Israel or 
Israelis. This only fosters other hateful 
attacks, encouraging others to do de-
humanizing things. We can talk about 
geopolitical problems without demon-
izing a people. That is pretty common 
sense. 
I remember how far anti-Semitic vio-
lence can go. In October of 2018, Robert 
Bowers attacked the Tree of Life syna-
gogue in Pittsburgh, PA, killing 11. He 
did so after complaining that our first 
President with Jewish members in the 
first family—President Trump, that 
is—was surrounded by a Jewish ‘‘infes-
tation.’’ Those were his words. It was 
the deadliest attack on the Jewish 
community in U.S. history. 
While battling the recent spike in 
Asian-American and Pacific Islander 
hate crimes, we need to remember to 
combat all hate crimes. I look forward 
to opportunities in hearings or in legis-
lation to see if we are doing everything 
that we can to protect our Jewish 
brethren and all Americans. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Wyoming. 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that both Senator 
SULLIVAN and I be allowed to complete 
our remarks—me for up to 12 minutes 
and Senator SULLIVAN for up to 5 min-
utes—before the vote. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I 
come to the floor today to talk about 
the ongoing crisis at our southern bor-
der. 
Over the past few weeks, the Biden 
border crisis has been overshadowed by 
several other crises facing our country 
under this administration. Inflation 
has surged. The price of gasoline across 
Wyoming and likely in the home State 
of the Presiding Officer as well is now 
over $3 a gallon. Democrats have been 
on another spending spree. It is a tril-
lion-dollar spending spree. Hiring has 
plummeted across the country. Terror-
ists have attacked our closest ally. The 
response from the Biden administra-
tion actually on that attack has been 
to treat both our closest ally Israel and 
the attackers of Hamas as equals. I 
could go on and on. 
The most serious challenges facing 
our Nation have escalated ever since 
President Biden has taken office, but 
you can’t forget the border crisis that 
we have now under President Biden. 
Over the last several months, basically 
since President Biden took office on 
January 20 and he changed our border 
policies, the crisis has only gotten 
worse. 
President Biden flipped on a big 
green light and said: Come to America. 
That is the message that people heard 
all across the world. He sent a clear 
message that the border is open. 
On his first day in office, President 
Biden shut down construction of the 
southern border wall. He stopped all 
deportations for 100 days. He brought 
back a program basically known as 
catch-and-release. Now those policy 
changes have led to a dramatic in-
crease in illegal immigration. 
In March, our border agents caught 
170,000 immigrants crossing our south-
ern border illegally. In April, they 
caught even more: 178,000 illegal immi-
grants in just 30 days. The numbers 
have gone up and up. I heard a report 
yesterday that we are now at half a 
million people coming in illegally ever 
since President Biden has taken office. 
Half a million—that is the population 
of the entire State of Wyoming coming 
into the country illegally since Janu-
ary 20. This year we are on a pace for 
illegal immigration to hit a 20-year 
high. 
Our border agents are overwhelmed. 
Two-thirds of the Border Patrol are too 
busy to actually be out there enforcing 
the law. They are too busy either tak-
ing care of kids, unaccompanied mi-
nors, or adults who have come across 
with families and have done so ille-
gally. So only about one-third are out 
there trying to stop the bad guys who 
are coming into this country—human 
traffickers, 
drug 
traffickers—some 
even, we know, on the terrorist watch 
list. 
In fact, they are so overwhelmed that 
they are doing something now they 
have never done before: They are re-
leasing 
illegal 
immigrants 
directly 
into the country without even giving 
them court dates. Instead, they are 
telling them to report to ICE facilities, 
oh, sometime in the next couple of 
months. This is unprecedented. This is 
worse than catch-and-release. This is 
an absolute, total surrender by the 
Biden administration to people coming 
into the country illegally. 
This is in addition to the tens of 
thousands of immigrants who simply 
escape. 
Border 
Patrol 
calls 
them 
getaways. They got away. They got 
into 
the 
country 
without 
being 
stopped. We saw these folks doing this 
when a number of us went to the border 
a month or so ago, chanting across the 
Rio Grande River: ‘‘You cannot stop us 
now.’’ 
The top Republican on the Homeland 
Security 
Committee, 
Senator 
PORTMAN, revealed last week that 
there were 40,000 of these ‘‘got-aways’’ 
just last month. Well, how many of 
them were drug smugglers? How many 
of them are human traffickers? How 
many are on the terrorist watch list? 
We will never know. Over the same 
month, deportation hit a record low. 
The crisis might have disappeared 
from the headlines, but it hasn’t gone 
away. And the people living near the 
border are being impacted dramati-
cally. It is only getting worse. 
Fifty thousand unaccompanied chil-
dren have crossed the border since Joe 
Biden 
became 
President. 
Unprece-
dented. At a time of a global pandemic, 
these 
children 
are 
not 
social 
distancing, let me tell you. That is 
what we saw when we saw them 
crammed in like sardines into the 
Donna facility at the southern tip of 
Texas. 
The media reports that the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services 
has left some kids on buses overnight. 
This is a humanitarian crisis: nowhere 
for them to sleep, nowhere to bathe. 
One teenager named Joel said he was 
left on a bus for 3 days. That is how 
President Biden and his administration 
are handling the situation. 
I know Democrats love to lecture Re-
publicans about humane immigration 
policy. This is not humane. This is not 
humane.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3476 
May 26, 2021 
The White House is now boasting 
that they are transferring the kids out 
of Border Patrol facilities. Nothing to 
brag about there. That is what the law 
mandates. They are just sending them 
from one overcrowded government fa-
cility to another overcrowded govern-
ment facility. It seems like they are 
playing a shell game with these kids so 
they can play with the numbers. 
But the problem hasn’t been solved; 
no, sir, it has not. Thousands and thou-
sands of children keep showing up, and 
the crisis keeps getting worse. The 
Biden White House has told the world: 
Anyone under 18 can cross our border; 
we will let them in. And they are com-
ing in record numbers. So it is not a 
surprise that tens of thousands of fami-
lies are taking President Biden up on 
the offer. Not just families—criminals 
are taking advantage of these children. 
Criminals know that Border Patrol is 
overwhelmed. Criminals know, if they 
use kids to distract our agents, they 
will be able to make an end run via 
got-away, get-around, and bring drugs 
into the country. 
Border Patrol has come to the Con-
gress and has told the Appropriations 
Committee in the House that they are 
seizing four times as much fentanyl 
this year as they seized last year. They 
are not sure how much they are miss-
ing, but we do know that this is a drug 
that killed more than 30,000 Americans 
in 2019. 
Border Patrol has already seized 
more fentanyl over the last 7 months 
than they did over the previous year. 
They have seized enough fentanyl at 
the border—people trying to move it 
into the country illegally—the volume 
that has been seized at the border is 
enough to kill more than a million peo-
ple. That is just the drugs that we 
know about. Imagine the drugs we 
don’t know about. 
Well, how are Democrats going to 
deal with this border crisis? Many are 
ignoring it. Neither the President nor 
the Vice President has been to the bor-
der since taking office 4 months ago— 
neither one of them. Many Democrats 
are trying to distract people from the 
issue. So why are the President and 
Vice President not going? Because they 
know, if they go, TV cameras will go 
with them, and it will attract more at-
tention to the crisis—the humanitarian 
crisis, the national security crisis— 
that they have created. 
Now some Democrats are actually 
proposing that we make the crisis 
worse. Last week, the Senate had an 
opportunity to finish the border wall. 
Remember, the border wall has already 
been paid for. Only one Democrat voted 
to complete the wall. Every other Dem-
ocrat voted to block it. They voted 
against finishing the wall even though 
we have already paid for it. 
I have been there. I have seen areas 
of the wall. The materials are there 
lying on the ground, just needing to be 
lifted up and connected to other por-
tions of the wall, and that construction 
stopped the day President Biden took 
the oath of office. 
The Border Patrol officers say it 
would make a huge difference in their 
lives, in their jobs of protecting our 
Nation, if they could just put up and 
place that final spot of the wall. 
Some Democrats are actually encour-
aging even more illegal immigration. 
Democrats in Washington just sent $26 
billion in taxpayer money to the Gov-
ernor of California. Now, what does he 
want to do with the $26 billion that was 
sent to the Governor of California? He 
wants to give some of that money to il-
legal immigrants. 
Eight Senate Democrats have intro-
duced a bill to give free healthcare to 
children who are here illegally. They 
introduced a bill this month, knowing 
full well about the child migration cri-
sis at our border. This bill would only 
make the crisis worse. The Democrat 
promises of government benefits are a 
magnet to illegal immigrants. 
Democrats talk a lot about compas-
sion. This is not compassion. The com-
passionate thing to do is to stop the 
crisis. We know how to do that. We 
know what works. Democrats don’t 
like to admit it, but President Trump 
was historically successful in control-
ling our border. 
Democrats say that the system was 
dismantled. This is the exact opposite 
of the truth. Democrats are disman-
tling it today. Democrats need to stop 
giving our taxpayer dollars to illegal 
immigrants. Democrats need to turn 
off this magnet that is drawing 50,000 
children to risk their lives and take a 
very dangerous journey, many paying 
those to traffic them, to bring them up 
to the border and carry them across. 
We need to go back to the policies 
that make our borders secure: Enforce 
the law, close the loopholes that en-
courage our illegal immigration, finish 
the wall that we paid for, bring back 
the Remain in Mexico policy. 
This crisis might be overshadowed by 
the other crises that are hitting us now 
in this Nation, ones for which Joe 
Biden is responsible; yet the crisis at 
our Southern border will not go away 
until we take action.

AMENDMENT NO. 1911 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, for 
decades, even centuries, America’s uni-
versities have been the envy of the 
world and one of America’s biggest 
comparative advantages. At their best, 
they are hubs for innovative thinking, 
places where free exchange of ideas are 
not only encouraged but expected on 
campus. They have been the backbones 
of 
innovations 
that 
have 
changed 
countless lives in America and, really, 
across the world for the better. 
Now, of course, freedom of speech is 
enshrined in the First Amendment of 
our Constitution. The birth of our Na-
tion was the result of our Founding Fa-
thers escaping tyranny and pursuit of 
freedom of thought and expression. 
And since the inception of our coun-
try, we have prevailed over every coun-
try an empire that we have competed 
with, in part, because of America’s 
commitment to the free exchange of 
ideas, and our universities have tradi-
tionally amplified this longstanding 
American ideal and comparative ad-
vantage. 
But, unfortunately, this is changing. 
Today, it is becoming increasingly 
clear that many of our universities too 
often stamp out the exchange of ideas 
for certain politically correct nar-
ratives. This is having a chilling effect 
on our students, on campus, and most 
importantly, their ability to express 
themselves. 
Let me present some disturbing find-
ings. A recent Gallup survey of 3,000 
undergraduate students found that 81 
percent of students widely support a 
campus environment where they are 
exposed to all types of speech, even 
speech they find offensive—81 percent. 
However, that same survey found that 
only 59 percent of college students be-
lieve that free speech rights are secure, 
and that is down from 73 percent just 4 
years ago. 
That same survey also found that 63 
percent of university students in Amer-
ica agree that the climate on their 
campus deters students from express-
ing themselves openly, almost two- 
thirds of American students. That is 
remarkable. It is dangerous, not just 
for university life but for American 
life, and I believe it is unacceptable. 
Fortunately, we can do something 
about it with the simple amendment 
that I have offered today. 
This bill that we are debating right 
now, the Endless Frontier Act, will be 
sending billions, tens of billions, of dol-
lars—taxpayer dollars—to America’s 
universities. My amendment says, in 
return for these billions of dollars 
when applying for National Science 
Foundation funds, universities will be 
required to attest that they are pro-
tecting free speech, religious liberty, 
and prohibiting discrimination on cam-
pus and explain what steps they are 
taking to ensure compliance. That is 
it, a letter to the NSF once a year for 
billions in Federal research dollars. 
Now, already, we are hearing that 
some universities oppose my amend-
ment, calling it ‘‘burdensome.’’ Well, 
here it is. It is 2 pages. It is simple. It 
is easy. This university opposition ac-
tually illustrates the problem that, in 
exchange for billions of dollars in Fed-
eral research money, America’s univer-
sities can’t be bothered to demonstrate 
to Congress and the American people 
that they are committed to the prin-
ciples of the First Amendment which, 
by the way, have made our country and 
our universities so exceptional.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE

May 26, 2021 
Censorship, oppression, and one-sided 
thoughts are characteristics of Com-
munist China, not America, and cer-
tainly should not be the characteristics 
of America’s great universities—to the 
contrary. 
One of the most important ways to 
compete with and win against Com-
munist China is to ensure that Amer-
ica—and, yes, our universities—remain 
what they have traditionally been: lab-
oratories 
of 
free 
expression, 
free 
thought, creativity, innovation, and in-
genuity. 
My simple amendment will help 
make sure this happens, and I encour-
age all of my colleagues to vote yes to 
support this amendment, an America 
of free liberty, free thinking, and inno-
vation. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk proceeded to call the 
roll. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote on Sullivan amendment No. 
1911. 
The Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise 
today in opposition to amendment No. 
1911. It is an amendment that claims to 
be about protecting free speech but 
that 
could 
actually 
have 
a 
very 
chilling effect on speech at our institu-
tions of higher education. 
I share the goal of fostering campus 
environments that protect free speech 
and the free exchange of ideas, but I 
have multiple concerns with the way 
this amendment goes about advancing 
those goals. It is not the role of the Na-
tional Science Foundation or the in-
spector general of the National Science 
Foundation to police speech on cam-
puses. 
Deciding what is appropriate regula-
tion of speech should not be left to 
agencies that are not experts in con-
stitutional analysis or in issues related 
to First Amendment protections at our 
institutions of higher education. 
I believe it would be a mistake to use 
today’s amendment to make substan-
tial change without the opportunity 
for input from students, educators, and 
stakeholders. I have heard from many 
institutions of higher education, as 
well as civil rights groups, who strong-
ly share my concerns. 
I urge my colleagues to vote no. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. SULLIVAN. Mr. President, with 
all due respect to my colleague from 
Washington, when the universities say 
they can’t do this because it is too bur-
densome, again, to me that actually 
demonstrates the very problem my 
simple amendment is trying to resolve. 
All it is saying is in exchange for the 
tens of billions of dollars that Amer-
ica’s universities will be getting as 
part of the Endless Frontier Act, they 
have to do one simple thing: once a 
year, send a letter to the National 
Science Foundation saying—and this is 
in the amendment right here—they 
have committed to protecting free 
speech, viewpoint diversity, the free 
exchange of ideas, academic freedom, 
and the protection of religious liberty, 
and prohibiting against discrimination. 
That is it, Mr. President. It is very 
simple. 
This 
is 
what 
universities 
should be doing. It is a letter, once a 
year, that is very simple in exchange 
for billions and billions of Federal re-
search dollars. I certainly hope all of 
my colleagues will support this amend-
ment—simple, needed. 
Again, this is how we outcompete 
communist China, which is all about 
what the Endless Frontier Act is fo-
cused on. 
I encourage my colleagues to vote 
yes.

The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-

NATIONAL PERSONNEL RECORDS CENTER 
Mr. CASSIDY. Madam President, I 
rise today kind of expressing the frus-
tration of many of my constituents. 
During the COVID–19 pandemic, we 
have had Federal Agencies and employ-
ees not working at all—not from home, 
not in the office, period. Have not had 
a lick of work for over 14 months. 
In April, the Senate Finance Com-
mittee had a hearing entitled ‘‘The So-
cial Security Administration During 
COVID: How the Pandemic Hampered 
Access to Benefits and Strategies for 
Improving Service Delivery.’’ 
Now, following the hearing and in re-
sponse to my concerns that seniors in 
my State with issues getting their So-
cial Security benefits are not being 
sufficiently served due to field and 
local offices being closed, my office got 
a letter from Commissioner Andrew 
Saul. The letter states: 
I urge you to encourage the unions to con-
tinue engaging in meaningful dialogue with 
management that includes a focus on the 
very best service to the public. 
That is a nice way of saying: We need 
help getting the unions to the table so 
we can get Federal employees back to 
work. 
Now, we are talking about manda-
tory services, reopening Social Secu-
rity offices for in-person visits in a 
postvaccine world to assist elderly 
Americans—my 
grandparents, 
your 
grandparents—having issues with their 
benefits. This isn’t happening because 
government employees are not showing 
up. 
It brings to mind an old quote from 
an old Governor in Louisiana, Earl 
Long. They asked Governor Long: How 
many people do you have working at 
the capitol? And he looks off into 
space, and he goes: Working? About 
two. 
Now, in this case, that is the way it 
is going with this. The situation at the 
Department of Veterans Affairs, in 
connection with the National Archives 
and specifically the National Personnel 
Records Center, is even worse. Accord-
ing to the National Archives, the back-
log of veterans’ records grew to more 
than 499,000 requests in April of 2021. 
They estimate it will take 18 to 24 
months to clear once the National Per-
sonnel Records Center is staffed at full 
capacity. 
I just want to make this point. We 
have 499,000 ignored document requests 
from veterans. The people who have 
served our country are not being served 
in their current life. 
Despite the widespread availability 
of vaccines and the recent relaxation of 
COVID–19 guidelines from the U.S. Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Preven-
tion, the National Personnel Records

Center only moved to phase 2 on March 
29, 2021. In phase 2, the National Per-
sonnel Records Center has 25 percent of 
staff onsite. There are supposedly 200 
employees per shift, 2 shifts a day, 6 
days a week, but they are only proc-
essing emergency requests—for exam-
ple, immediate burials, hospitaliza-
tions, and for the homeless. 
In the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, 
we led a push to enable National Per-
sonnel Records Center employees to 
get vaccines from the VA’s allotment 
in an attempt to increase staffing. In 
the latest information provided to my 
staff, 
only 
36 
National 
Personnel 
Records Center employees took advan-
tage of this availability. This is 36 out 
of 600. 
Now, these aren’t just numbers on a 
poster. There are real consequences. 
These are people’s lives. 
My constituent Mr. Albert Duplantis, 
69 years old, of Lake Charles, LA— 
there is Mr. Duplantis when he was in 
the Navy, and there you see him now. 
He served our country during Vietnam 
stationed on the USS Pyro. 
He has diabetes mellitus type II, 
atrial fibrillation, and hypertension— 
claimed as due to Agent Orange. He 
needs treatment for his heart condi-
tion, but he cannot get the medical 
records he needs because the National 
Personnel Records Center is not proc-
essing the needed military record dur-
ing COVID–19, the one that the VA 
needs to make this happen. 
Now, his application for medical 
treatment for his heart condition—this 
is a heart condition, by the way—was 
received by the VA in December 2019. 
That is 2019. In an early response, the 
VA provided a possible date of comple-
tion of March 23, 2021. Now, from 2019, 
December, to March 23, 2021, that date 
has come and gone, but Mr. Duplantis’s 
application is stuck in limbo until the 
VA receives his military records from 
the National Personnel Records Center. 
Let me repeat. A treatment for heart 
disease has been held up since 2019 be-
cause of the inaction of the National 
Personnel Records Center. We are over 
1 year into the pandemic. We have had 
access to vaccines, the masks are off, 
and still records are not being proc-
essed. And Federal employees are sit-
ting at home, collecting a paycheck, 
without working. We are talking since 
March of last year. We are now in May 
of this year. They have not shown up 
for work 1 day, nor have they worked 
from home, and we have a man who 
can’t get his records for heart disease. 
This is unacceptable. With vaccines 
widely available, there is no excuse for 
mandatory work not being done. If you 
are not willing to do your job, you 
shouldn’t have a job. This great Amer-
ican went to war for our freedom, but 
Federal employees won’t go to the of-
fice to file his paperwork. There are 
other veterans besides Mr. Duplantis 
unable to receive medical treatment 
and other benefits they are entitled to. 
This weekend we will observe Memo-
rial Day, a time where we honor and 
mourn the men and women of the U.S. 
military who died during their service 
to this great country. This is a re-
minder 
of 
the 
sacrifice 
willingly 
risked—and 
unfortunately 
it 
oc-
curred—and they did this, they signed 
up for this, without flinching. We 
should repay our veterans and do more 
for them just by doing the job that 
should be done. 
The National Personnel Records Cen-
ter needs to get their house in order. 
They need to go back to work. Our vet-
erans deserve better. Mr. Duplantis de-
serves medical treatment. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I 
rise at this moment to oppose the 
amendment that is going to be offered 
by my colleague and friend from Lou-
isiana Senator KENNEDY. This amend-
ment would endanger the lives of thou-
sands, if not millions, of innocent peo-
ple 
and 
prolong 
this 
terrible 
coronavirus pandemic. I am sure that 
is the not the intention of the Senator 
from Louisiana, but that is what his ef-
fort would do. His amendment would 
gut a critical tool to help stop the 
spread of the pandemic globally, as 
well as stem the economic fallout that 
would hurt us here in America. 
The International Monetary Fund 
has a fund with the ability to release 
money in what are called Special 
Drawing Rights, foreign exchange re-
serve assets that it maintains. This can 
be exchanged by member nations for 
hard currency in times of crisis. This is 
exactly what was done in 2009 amid the 
global economic crisis and what is 
being considered now amid the pan-
demic and related economic downturn. 
The amendment, which I am going to 
offer, has the support of American 
business, labor, and global health, and 
poverty groups—for good reason. The 
Special Drawing Rights are a no cost 
way for Americans to help poor nations 
buy the vaccines they need to save 
lives and to stop the spread of this 
coronavirus. And it would also help aid 
in economic recovery. 
Isn’t that exactly what we should be 
doing at this moment? 
This pandemic doesn’t know any 
boundaries. This virus doesn’t pick and 
choose good nations and bad nations. 
Our ability to protect the hard-fought 
gains against the pandemic here in the 
United States, after all that we have 
been through, ultimately depends on 
getting it under control around the 
world so variants and strains don’t at-
tack us anew. 
I know what we have been through. If 
we ignore the reality, the fact is, this 
pandemic came roaring at us from a 
city in China that most Americans 
have never heard of, and now we have 
to decide whether we are going to take 
it on directly. 
You don’t tell the fire department to 
not help with the fire at your neigh-
bor’s house at a time of crisis. Sadly, 
that is exactly what the Kennedy 
amendment would do. 
And the one part that he is missing 
that is so critical is to take it or leave 
it on the Special Drawing Rights. You 
can’t pick and choose the Nations that 
might or might not receive the benefits 
to buy vaccines. 
We can use other mechanisms and 
persuasion to achieve that goal, but I 
am sorry to say that Senator KEN-
NEDY’s approach would cut off the Spe-
cial Drawing Rights for friendly na-
tions as well as those who are not 
friendly. And that to me is short-
sighted. 
The way the IMF Special Drawing 
Rights process works, we cannot dic-
tate which countries will receive the 
benefits. Because of our majority posi-
tion at the IMF, we either stop the 
Special Drawing Rights completely or 
let them go forward. 
So the United States should stand for 
public health, stand for people to be 
spared the suffering and death of this 
coronavirus, and move forward with 
humanitarian aid that will help the 
world. 
The Treasury Department is working 
with our allies to halt the ability of 
any rogue nation that might want to 
exchange Special Drawing Rights for 
hard 
currency 
and 
pushing 
trans-
parency measures for how any Special 
Drawing Rights are spent. 
As such, I am offering a substitute 
amendment that makes it clear that 
we want to make certain that nations 
do not misuse these funds. But unlike 
the Kennedy amendment, it would 
move forward and provide resources for 
countries desperately in need of vac-
cines to save lives. 
I further support the Treasury’s ef-
forts to make sure that the SDR allo-
cation is used to help to stem the pan-
demic. 
I urge my colleagues to vote for my 
substitute amendment and to oppose 
the amendment being offered by the 
Senator from Louisiana. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under 
the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote in relation to Durbin 
amendment No. 2014. 
The Senator from Louisiana. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
love Senator DURBIN. I hate his amend-
ment. Here is why. These SDRs are not 
free money. They are not free money. 
They are like a cryptocoin. The IMF 
issues the cryptocoin to all the coun-
tries that are members of the IMF, and 
these countries take that cryptocoin, 
and guess what they do. They come to 
the United States of America and say: 
We want to exchange our cryptocoin 
for dollars. And guess what. We don’t 
have the dollars because we are dead 
broke. So we have to borrow the dol-
lars to give to the Chinas and the Ven-
ezuelas and all the countries that hate 
us in exchange for their cryptocoins. 
Now, that is just a natural fact, and 
if you check the record, you will find 
that as to the countries that really 
need the money to vaccinate their peo-
ple, about 10 percent of this money is

going to them. The rest is going to all 
the larger countries, like China, like 
Venezuela, like the countries in Eu-
rope. Virtually no money gets sent to 
the people who need it. This is an in-
credibly inefficient way to do it. 
Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, do I 
have 1 minute? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right. 
Mr. DURBIN. These Special Drawing 
Rights of the International Monetary 
Fund are the only way the poorest na-
tions on Earth could have the money 
to buy vaccines to save their people. 
That is what it boils down to. 
But Senator KENNEDY
says: Well, 
some of this money might get into the 
wrong hands. 
I pray that it doesn’t. I pray that 
they administer it properly, and I 
think they will. But how would you 
like to have on your conscience the 
fact that our amendment vote on the 
Senate floor is the end of the funds for 
vaccines for some of the poorest coun-
tries on Earth? I would not want that 
on my conscience. 
Support 
my 
amendment, 
which 
makes it clear where the Americans do 
stand when it comes to this issue.

the previous order, there will now be 2 
minutes of debate equally divided prior 
to the vote in relation to Kennedy 
amendment No. 1710. 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, 
the 
International 
Monetary 
Fund 
issues special drawing rights. A special 
drawing right is like a cryptocoin—it is 
not worth anything. It is only worth 
something if you exchange it for real 
money. The Biden administration de-
cided to encourage the IMF to issue all 
of these cryptocoins, and guess what 
they are all doing? They are bringing 
the cryptocoins to the United States of 
America and are saying: We want dol-
lars. 
Give 
me 
dollars 
for 
the 
cryptocoin. 
Yet we don’t have any dollars in our 
checking account, so we have to bor-
row the money. There is no free lunch, 
and you don’t get one now. 
All my bill would do would be to say 
that we are not going to issue special 
drawing rights to perpetrators of geno-
cide or state sponsors of terrorism—in 
other words, no free money to China, 
no free money to Syria, and no free 
money to Iran. It is ludicrous for us to 
be borrowing money to give dollars to 
exchange for cryptocoins to China or 
Syria or Iran. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ma-
jority whip. 
Mr. 
DURBIN. 
Madam 
President, 
there is one fundamental flaw in what 
you have just heard from Senator KEN-
NEDY, and let me read it to you: 
The United States retains the right to 
refuse to purchase special drawing rights 
from any [country]. 
It is voluntary—it is up to us to do 
it—and we don’t purchase them from a 
lot of countries because of that. 
Let me tell you further that all we 
can do is stop the special drawing 
rights which are providing our cur-
rency to countries to buy vaccines. 
Why do we care whether some country 
far away had a vaccine? Well, how far 
away was Wuhan, China? 
We have to be in this together to try 
to put an end to this pandemic crisis. 
Vote to defeat the Kennedy amend-
ment.

REMEMBERING CHARLES E. ROEMER III 
Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I 
want to just spend a few minutes today 
saying goodbye to a friend. Louisiana 
weeps right now. Gov. Charles E. Roe-
mer III passed away last week. He went 
by ‘‘Buddy.’’ He served our State from 
1988 to 1992. Before that, he served a 
number of terms in Congress. 
I guess I am biased because Buddy 
brought me to the dance, if you will. I 
was sitting in my office in New Orleans 
practicing law, earning a good living, 
you know, thinking about happy hour 
on a Friday afternoon, and Governor 
Roemer had just been elected and he 
asked me to come up to Baton Rouge 
and work as his legal counsel. And I 
did, and I stayed for 4 years. And I 
liked government service, and I have 
been in it, off and on, since then. 
Buddy was one of the—Buddy was an 
extremely—I say ‘‘was.’’ I am going to 
say ‘‘is’’ because he lives with us. But 
he was one of the most and is one of 
the most complex, interesting people I 
have ever met. He was immeasurably 
talented. He was raised on a cotton 
farm, but it wasn’t really a farm be-
cause his parents and his family, they 
were all so accomplished. 
They put together a cotton farm with 
their own sweat and blood and some 
free enterprise capital of about 10,000 
acres in North Louisiana. It is a big 
farm in Louisiana. But the kids all 
worked, including Buddy. 
They didn’t have a television. Mr. 
Budgie, his dad, and Ms. Adeline, his

mom, would require the kids, in their 
free time, to read books. And, boy, it 
stuck with Buddy. I never saw him 
without a book. I would ride with him 
to go to a speech. He would have a 
book in the car, and he would read it 
driving over there. 
He went to Harvard when he was 16. 
He would have gone sooner. Harvard of-
fered him a position, but his mom and 
dad said: You are too young. You have 
got to stick around. 
And he stayed at Harvard for grad-
uate school. 
Buddy was—how can I put this?—one 
of the first real intellectual Governors 
that we ever had in Louisiana. I am not 
putting down our other Governors, 
now—I am not—because all of our Gov-
ernors have been intelligent, just like 
in the Presiding Officer’s State. You 
don’t rise to that position without 
being intelligent. But Buddy truly be-
lieved in the power of ideas, and he 
truly believed in the worth of edu-
cation. 
I have used his words often. He used 
to say: Kennedy, the future in Lou-
isiana is education. It is not the price 
of oil. It is not the unemployment rate. 
It is not who the Governor is. It is edu-
cation. 
And he would say that time and 
again. 
During his 4 years—when he became 
Governor, we had a $7 billion budget. 
We had a $1 billion deficit. That is 
what he was left with. Roemer bal-
anced the budget. It wasn’t easy, but 
he did. And then he implemented fiscal 
reforms that dramatically and totally 
changed our way of budgeting in Lou-
isiana for generations to come, because 
of Buddy’s efforts. 
He announced in Louisiana—and this 
was heresy at the time: I am going to 
find out which of our teachers can 
teach, and, by God, I am going to pay 
them. 
And he said: But I am also going to 
find out which of our teachers can’t 
teach, and I am going to either teach 
them how or tell them to find a new 
line of work. 
Boy, was that ever revolutionary. 
And he did it. 
He totally rewrote our campaign fi-
nance laws. When Buddy became Gov-
ernor, there was no reporting of cam-
paign money. If you were running for 
office, somebody could bring you a 
suitcase full of cash—$200,000—and it 
was perfectly legal. You didn’t have to 
report it. And if you got the money on 
a Thursday, if you decided on a Friday 
you weren’t going to run and you with-
drew from the race, you could keep it. 
You could keep it. 
Buddy completely rewrote all of that. 
Now you have to report every penny in, 
every penny out. There is a cap on con-
tributions. No cash. And we enforce it. 
It changed our politics dramatically. 
I will tell you one quick story that 
epitomizes the Buddy I knew. 
There was a central piece of his edu-
cation program. I won’t bore you with 
the details. It had to do with higher 
education. It was key to our future, 
and we really needed to pass it. 
I was handling it, lobbying it for the 
Governor, and we needed one more vote 
in the senate—one more vote to pass 
this landmark bill. And this one Sen-
ator said: Kennedy, I will vote for it if 
you will have the Governor give me 
this project. 
So I was all excited. I went back to 
see the Governor. I said: Governor, I 
think I got it put together. 
It was a road project. 
He said: Call him over to our depart-
ment of transportation and see what 
they think. 
And the folks at the department of 
transportation said: Yes, we can do it, 
but if we do it, we will all go to jail. 
So I said: Oh, man. 
So I go back, and I tell Governor 
Roemer. I was young, but I was pas-
sionate, and I said: Governor, we can’t 
do it. 
He said: I agree. We are not going to 
do that. 
I said: But listen. This is so impor-
tant. This particular Senator lies to us 
all the time. Let me just lie to him. 
Let me just go to him and tell him we 
will do it. We will get his vote, and 
then I will go back to him later and 
say we changed our mind. 
The end does justify the means. I will 
never forget it. 
Buddy says: No, we are not doing 
that. 
And I argued with him, but he finally 
just said: Look, Kennedy, I made my 
decision. We are not doing it that way. 
I am going to really miss Buddy. He 
wasn’t a perfect guy. I told him one 
time—I said: Governor, if I were back 
in law practice in the private sector 
and you came to me as a private client, 
I would represent you, but I would 
quadruple my hourly rate. 
He was so smart, but he could be very 
opinionated. Tip O’Neill gave Buddy 
sort of his slogan phrase. Tip O’Neill 
described then-Congressman Roemer 
one time. He said: Congressman Roe-
mer—often wrong, never in doubt. 
But I am going to really miss Buddy. 
All he ever wanted to do was change 
Louisiana, and he did. He wasn’t re-
elected, but he did. 
But Buddy always understood. This 
was his barometer of success. He used 
to tell me and say: Kennedy, here is 
how you know when you are doing a 
good job: if you are making the right 
people mad. 
He used to say: If nobody is mad at 
you and if the wrong people like what 
you are doing, you are not doing your 
job. 
So he did make people mad, and it 
cost him his reelection. But he changed 
Louisiana, and Louisiana weeps. And 
when I count my blessings, I count 
Buddy Roemer twice. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum.

OFFICER.

The legislative clerk proceeded to

Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I ask

The

(Mr.

FINANCIAL INNOVATION CAUCUS 
Ms. LUMMIS. Mr. President, I am ex-
cited to announce the founding of the 
Senate Financial Innovation Caucus 
with my friend and cochair, the Sen-
ator from Arizona. I am delighted that 
you also have joined our caucus. We 
are grateful for your participation and 
look forward to working with you. 
One of my top priorities and a legacy 
I hope to leave in this Chamber is to 
ensure the United States remains a 
global leader in financial services for 
future generations. 
The U.S. dollar is the world’s unques-
tioned reserve currency. Since the Sec-
ond World War, this leadership role has 
given our country enormous advan-
tages, including affordable credit and 
trade finance. China is not hiding its 
ambition to knock the U.S. dollar 
down a peg by offering a competitor 
payment system that sidesteps the 
United States. 
This year, the Chinese Government 
launched a pilot program for their dig-
ital yuan in multiple cities around 
China. They expect to completely re-
lease the central bank digital currency 
at the 2022 Winter Olympics. 
A video released by China state-con-
trolled media in December of 2020 open-
ly stated that the digital yuan will 
allow China to ‘‘actively participate in 
reforming world economic governance’’ 
and is ‘‘one of the building blocks of 
China’s move toward world market sta-
tus and greater involvement in setting 
the framework of the global economy.’’ 
China does not share the same values 
as our country relating to fair competi-
tion. This chilling reality is one of the 
many reasons the United States must 
advance financial innovation and do so 
now. China is serious about the future. 
Chinese President Xi stated in 2018 
that financial innovation is ‘‘the new 
industrial revolution.’’ 
In another part of the world, digital 
assets 
are 
protecting 
many 
Ven-
ezuelans during their current economic 
crisis and ensuring corrupt government 
officials cannot seize or devalue their 
hard-earned savings. The U.S. Govern-
ment is also using digital assets to 
achieve its foreign policy objectives 
and to provide humanitarian aid to 
Venezuelan groups faster than tradi-
tional channels. 
We must work hard today to ensure 
the next generation of Americans can 
enjoy the opportunity and prosperity 
made possible by responsible innova-
tion. Failure to do so could have astro-
nomical impacts on the freedoms and 
privileges that are essential to the 
American dream. 
I have been encouraged by early signs 
from the Biden administration that 
they understand the existential threat 
of China and the promise of financial 
innovation. China’s moves alone should 
create a sense of urgency in this Cham-
ber to take action. 
But it is not just a threat from China 
that should motivate us. In addition to

protecting the U.S. position as the 
world leader in the financial system, 
proper regulations for financial innova-
tion will have lasting effects in the fi-
nancial industry in several ways, nota-
bly financial inclusion and entrepre-
neurship because financial innovation 
encompasses topics as diverse as faster 
payment and equities settlement, cen-
tral bank digital currencies, financial 
inclusion, digital assets, distributed 
ledger technology, consumer protec-
tion, artificial intelligence, and ma-
chine learning. This area has remained 
bipartisan, following in the tradition of 
many other financial service issues. 
The Financial Innovation Caucus is 
rigorously committed to the tradition 
of bipartisanship and will create a last-
ing legacy by doing so. Innovation is 
core to the American identity, and in-
novation isn’t confined to one party. 
Our job here is to create a framework 
that allows innovation to take root. 
Regulatory certainty fosters entrepre-
neurial innovation. A lack of regu-
latory clarity, on the flip side, stran-
gles regulation, restrains entrepreneur-
ship. 
In many cases, financial innovators 
are simply hungry to know the rules of 
the road and how they fit into existing 
law. We need a right-sized regulatory 
framework for financial technology 
that both enables new market opportu-
nities and emphasizes consumer protec-
tion. The innovator too often loses 
when competing against business gi-
ants with lobbying arms. Together, we 
can craft regulations that foster inno-
vation, not stifle or unnecessarily di-
rect it. 
We also need a new consumer protec-
tion framework for emerging tech, 
which promotes access and innovation 
but ensures appropriate guardrails are 
in place. 
Innovators are the lifeblood of Amer-
ica. Each new idea strengthens our fu-
ture. Innovators have done hard work 
in coming up with ideas which will 
bring underserved populations into the 
financial system, reduce systemic risk, 
and strengthen our competitive nature 
on the global stage. 
Yet there is only so much innovators 
can accomplish due to our maze of fi-
nancial 
regulations. 
American 
innovators need clear rules of the road 
so they can responsibly turn innova-
tion into reality. It is our obligation as 
government officials to create a frame-
work that clearly enables responsible 
innovation rather than stifling it. We 
must do a great deal more in the com-
ing years to clarify and modernize our 
financial laws. 
Citibank, Goldman Sachs, Avanti 
Bank and Trust, State Street, Deut-
sche Bank, Kraken, and other large fi-
nancial institutions are now doing 
much more than dipping their toes into 
this realm. They are diving into the fi-
nancial technology and digital asset 
markets. Financial innovation is here 
to stay. Younger generations are turn-
ing to and prioritizing technology for 
their investments. 
In February, CNBC reported that 
there may be as many as 100,000 mil-
lionaires from the appreciation of dig-
ital assets like Bitcoin. These tech-
nologies, if harnessed wisely, see no 
color, no creed, and no sex. 
But financial innovation is not lim-
ited to regulating digital assets. This 
caucus will also focus on issues like 
faster payments, including a U.S. cen-
tral bank digital currency and FedNow, 
which have real potential to allow all 
Americans to receive their paychecks 
instantly. 
The lack of real-time payments costs 
disadvantaged Americans millions in 
overdraft fees each year and would re-
duce many Americans’ reliance on 
high-interest loans. It also traps large 
amounts of capital for companies, 
which could be deployed more produc-
tively. Tackling these issues will help 
bring millions of unbanked or under-
banked Americans into our financial 
system. 
In Wyoming, we live by the doctrine 
that you have to pull yourself up by 
your bootstraps. What you earn is a di-
rect result of your hard work. All 
Americans should have access to their 
hard-earned money and investments 
whenever they would like. We can and 
should use innovation technologies to 
reduce settlement times in our pay-
ment networks and capital markets 
and to reduce systemic risk and im-
prove transparency. 
Threats to the world economic sys-
tem, coupled with the benefits finan-
cial innovation can create, is why, 
today, alongside many of my col-
leagues from both parties, we are 
founding the Senate Financial Innova-
tion Caucus. The caucus is a bipartisan 
group committed to promoting respon-
sible innovation to help the U.S. finan-
cial industry truly meet 21st century 
challenges of a globally interconnected 
economy and to harvest technology to 
make markets more inclusive, vibrant, 
and safe for all Americans. After all, 
our financial innovation is critical in 
our pursuit to ensure equal access to fi-
nancial institutions and opportunities. 
It is my hope that the work done by 
the Financial Innovation Caucus will 
deliver comprehensive legislation to 
clarify, regulate, and protect America’s 
edge in the financial industry when it 
comes to innovation. We live in a dig-
ital 
world. 
Technology 
is 
now 
engrained in our everyday lives. Our 
lives should reflect this shift and 
should not hinder innovation. Only to-
gether can we secure the U.S. role in 
the future of finance. So let’s go to 
work. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Utah. 
S. 1260 
Mr. LEE. Mr. President, the United 
States is at a crossroads in our strat-
egy to counter the threat posed by 
Communist China. It is vital that we 
place ourselves in a position to com-
pete with China, to be sure, but it is 
equally important that we consider 
just what kind of game we are playing 
and just what kind of competitor we 
aspire to be. 
The bill before us, the Endless Fron-
tier Act, aims to counter China pri-
marily by boosting technology re-
search and development. No doubt, 
these are important components of any 
strategy to counter China, but, unfor-
tunately, it goes about it in the exact 
wrong way—trying to beat China at its 
own game and taking us across a fron-
tier that we ought never to traverse. In 
fact, models of some of China’s own bad 
strategies are emulated in this legisla-
tion, strategies that are in exact oppo-
sition—direct opposition—to American 
principles and American ways of life. 
Let’s consider some of the hallmarks 
of communist China. In every aspect, 
the Chinese regime grows and central-
izes the power of government at the ex-
pense of free citizens and free mar-
kets—an experiment that has expanded 
into dangerous and even deadly terri-
tory. Take, for example, China’s record 
on human rights. 
China has gone so far as to enslave 
and subject the Tibetan and Uighur 
people to forced labor, reeducation, and 
torture. Under China’s infamous one- 
child 
policy, 
it 
has 
brutally 
and 
barbarically forced families to undergo 
IUD implantation, complete steriliza-
tion, and abortion. 
It has a long, dark history of reli-
gious persecution and of silencing dis-
sidents. Under President Xi Jinping, 
Chinese authorities have detained mil-
lions of Muslims and arrested thou-
sands of Christians. They have seized 
control of Tibetan monasteries and 
closed or demolished dozens of Bud-
dhist and Taoist temples. They have 
even practiced forced organ harvesting 
of members of the Falun Gong religion. 
Or consider China’s actions in the 
realm of foreign policy. 
In true imperialist form, China is 
pushing its Belt and Road Initiative—a 
massive, 
predatory 
infrastructure 
project that stretches from East Asia 
to Europe—designed to massively ex-
pand China’s coercive economic and po-
litical influence. It has spread Confu-
cius Institutes across American college 
campuses, entangling American uni-
versities with Chinese state policies 
and turning them into megaphones to 
repeat Chinese propaganda. In multi-
lateral organizations, China continu-
ously undermines longstanding demo-
cratic norms, instituting policies that, 
instead, 
benefit 
the 
Chinese 
Com-
munist Party’s authoritarian values, 
and it has held a tight, cronyist, com-
mand-and-control grip over its econ-
omy—heavily 
subsidizing 
industries 
and constantly picking winners and 
losers. 
While China has picked up some 
steam through some of these actions, 
we cannot ignore that whatever mo-
mentum it may have acquired is of du-
bious success and minimal sustain-
ability in the long run. You see, China, 
under the control of the Communist 
Party, has, in reality, one of the least

efficient economies in the entire world. 
In terms of GDP per capita, it is quite 
the opposite of being at the top of the 
barrel. In fact, it is way down, right 
next to Cuba and Kazakhstan. 
It turns out that political corruption 
and state-owned enterprises come with 
some financial dead weight too. The fi-
nancial cost alone of enslaving, steri-
lizing, and brainwashing 12.8 million 
Uighurs and other oppressed groups is 
steep, even as the human cost of this 
moral depravity is far worse and infi-
nitely steeper. 
Killing future generations’ potential 
through abortion is also as foolish as it 
is inhumane. As a result of its decades- 
long abortion and one-child or two- 
child policies, China is on track to lose 
a third of its workforce and age faster 
than any society in history. The ratio 
of workers to retirees in China, which 
is currently 8 to 1, is projected to whit-
tle down to 2 to 1 in the coming dec-
ades. With only two employees for 
every retiree, China’s pension system, 
which is already showing signs of buck-
ling, will inevitably crack under pres-
sure. 
It is true that China is aggressive, 
and it is true that China is really big, 
but it is not ironclad in its position of 
global strength, to put it mildly. As its 
population ages more and more and as 
more of its land falls into wasted, pol-
luted squalor, it will have neither the 
inhabitants nor the resources to con-
tinue on its current course of perceived 
economic prosperity. 
There is nothing about China’s prin-
ciples or about China’s trajectory that 
we should try to emulate, not in the 
least. In nearly every way imaginable, 
the Chinese regime consolidates power 
to trample the rights of individual men 
and women and quash free expression, 
the free exercise of religion, and free 
enterprise. Nothing could be more anti-
thetical to the American system of 
government and the American way of 
life. In fact, it is precisely the opposite 
formula that has made us the world’s 
strongest and most prosperous nation. 
The Founders gave us a Constitution 
precisely for the purpose of dispersing 
and limiting power within the Federal 
Government and to keep government, 
in general, as close and accountable to 
the people as possible. And they gave 
us a Bill of Rights precisely to safe-
guard individual liberty and protect 
our most cherished freedoms—empow-
ering ordinary men and women to 
preach and live out their deepest be-
liefs in the public square, to gather and 
speak freely, to bear arms, and to peti-
tion the government in redress of 
grievances. 
You see, the beauty of this design is 
that it opens up the space for two sepa-
rate but mutually reinforcing institu-
tions that are at the heart of our vision 
of freedom and that are absolutely key 
to our success: a free enterprise econ-
omy and a voluntary civil society. 
These systems work in tandem for 
everyone because they impel everyone 
to work together—harnessing individ-
uals’ self-interests to the common good 
of the community and, ultimately, 
that of the Nation. It is the free mar-
ket system that prizes human inge-
nuity, rewarding people for putting 
their God-given talents and their own 
exertions and resources in the service 
of their neighbors. 
The free market impels us to ask: 
What problems need to be solved? What 
can I do to improve other people’s 
lives? 
It is the free market that created the 
wealth that liberated millions of Amer-
ican families from subsistence farming, 
opening up opportunities for the pur-
suit of happiness never known before or 
since in government-directed econo-
mies. These are blessings that never 
will be known in an economy domi-
nated by a government. 
In America, it has also always been 
understood that the family is the 
building block of society, worthy of 
protecting and of empowering, and it 
has been the cooperation between fami-
lies, churches, neighborhoods, clubs, 
and voluntary associations that have 
knit together the American social fab-
ric and made it strong. 
In other words, the beauty of the 
American system is that of opening up 
the space for everyday citizens to build 
creative, productive, meaningful, and 
happy lives together. These are the 
hallmarks of the American system of 
government, and these are the things 
that we ought to preserve in moving 
forward. 
Unfortunately, the bill before us at-
tempts not to double down on our suc-
cesses but to pivot to the so-called 
‘‘successes’’ of China by federally hi-
jacking research and development and 
crowding out the private incentives 
that bring successful ideas to market. 
It is a flawed and, ultimately, foolish 
strategy. 
First, in our free and democratic so-
ciety, we will never marshal the will to 
ramp up taxes and spend China into the 
ground, nor should we try. 
Second, history has proven, time and 
again, that centralized planning is a 
losing game. The United States has al-
ready tried the industrial policy exper-
iment of picking winners and losers 
and causing great harm in the process. 
In fact, that is exactly how we have 
ended up with the terrible protec-
tionist policies like trade wars and the 
Jones Act. 
The strategy of the Endless Frontier 
Act, however, is rooted in the mistaken 
belief that our markets have failed us 
and that the only means by which we 
can jump-start our economy and create 
innovation is by trusting in Federal 
Government bureaucrats. 
So what would it do in reality? 
It would green-light $54 billion in 
spending beyond our budget caps, with 
additional authorizations of $190 bil-
lion, and it would put this massive 
amount of money toward more govern-
ment bureaucracy, producing a system 
where the government picks winners 
and losers in industry, creating artifi-
cial 
demand 
for 
inefficient 
tech-
nologies, crowding out the good re-
search and development that the pri-
vate sector already does, and increas-
ing our manufacturing costs. 
If we are to compete with China and 
maintain our leadership in technology, 
what, instead, should be our path for-
ward? What should we do instead of 
passing this law that tries to compete 
with China by using strategies that 
work only for China and will never 
work here and must never work here? 
We have to do what America does and 
always 
has 
done 
best. 
Instead 
of 
chilling innovation and competition, 
we ought to decentralize power and 
champion trust in the private sector. 
We ought to decrease regulation, not 
invest in regulatory bodies. We ought 
to simplify and cut taxes, not offshore 
our jobs. We ought to use our critical 
minerals, not let them languish. We 
ought to partner with our allies, not 
restrict fair trade. We ought to harvest 
timber, not organs. We ought to defend 
families, not diminish them. We ought 
to encourage entrepreneurship, not 
crony 
capitalism. 
We 
ought 
to 
strengthen markets, not government. 
Two paths lie before us. I urge my 
colleagues to choose the better part 
and reject this bill. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Pennsylvania. 
Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, thank 
you very much. I wanted to rise today 
to talk about a matter that has come 
before the Senate in the bill that we 
are considering, the United States In-
novation and Competition Act. I rise to 
talk about a particular amendment 
that I have been working on. It is 
amendment No. 1853. Of course I urge 
the Senate to act quickly to approve 
this amendment to protect our supply 
chains that are critical to the national 
security of the United States. 
I wanted to explain what the origin 
of this amendment has been. It goes all 
the way back to the beginning of the 
pandemic, the worst public health cri-
sis in over 100 years in our Nation. At 
that time, as so many Americans re-
member, we watched in horror as ac-
cess to masks, gloves, gowns, and even 
more sophisticated equipment, like 
ventilators and other critical sup-
plies—when all of that was necessary 
for pandemic response, all of a sudden, 
it dried up. 
The reason why we had such a short-
age of supplies and personal protective 
equipment and the like was that supply 
chains were delayed, and those supply 
chains, of course, were originating in 
China, which we know is a country 
where the government is run by the 
Chinese Communist Party. That same 
ruling party and that government even 
tightened restrictions on the exports of 
masks and other personal protective 
equipment. 
So we learned the hard way, the very 
hard way, just how dependent our sup-
ply chains are on goods originating in 
China. We learned how vulnerable we

May 26, 2021 
all are, our Nation was and is, to the 
Chinese Government’s whims, really 
the whim of the Communist Party in 
China, because it is a fact that they 
control the companies that produce 
and export the critical supplies we de-
pend upon. 
This amendment, amendment 1853, 
which, by the way, is bipartisan in 
ways that you don’t see very much of 
in the Senate these days—three Demo-
crats and three Republicans coming to-
gether on this bipartisan amendment. 
It is an effort to enhance our national 
security at its core. That is what it is 
about, enhancing our national secu-
rity, 
but 
unfortunately 
corporate 
forces are blocking it. They are even 
blocking a vote on it. They don’t, ap-
parently, want to see a vote on this 
bill, and they also don’t want to in-
clude it in an agreement between both 
sides when the bill is about to be com-
pleted in a so-called managers’ package 
as part of the bill. 
We just want to get it done because I 
am interested in and my five cospon-
sors from both parties are interested in 
protecting U.S. national security. 
What we read today in a publication, 
POLITICO Pro, the morning trade edi-
tion—I am just holding up a copy of it 
here, and I will just make reference to 
it. I don’t think we have to add all of 
it to the RECORD, but here is the lead 
for POLITICO Pro this morning. The 
lead says this: 
Trade groups representing some of the 
country’s largest corporations are staunchly 
opposing a Senate proposal that would sub-
ject U.S. companies to a Federal review be-
fore they can make certain investments in 
China or relocate critical manufacturing ca-
pabilities there. 
And then in the body of the report, 
when it gets down to reporting in de-
tail who is opposing this amendment 
and what they are saying, it says that 
this amendment has ‘‘riled up big busi-
ness.’’ 
‘‘Riled up big business.’’ Just imag-
ine that. Big corporations riled up be-
cause a bipartisan group of Senators is 
coming together to protect national se-
curity, and they are riled up. They 
don’t seem to support us in this. 
Here is what one of the organizations 
that would go on the record—of course, 
you have a lot of big corporations that 
are hiding behind trade groups—trade 
associations, I should say. They don’t 
have the guts to stand up and oppose 
this. They are hiding behind organiza-
tions. 
Here is one of the organizations, and 
I am quoting Anna Ashton, vice presi-
dent of government affairs at the U.S.- 
China Business Council. Here is what 
they have to say: 
We long have said that national security 
should not be defined in a vague way. 
‘‘Vague way.’’ We are not vague in 
this. We are very clear. And then she 
goes on to criticize it. 
So what are we talking about here? 
We are talking about an effort to pro-
tect U.S. national security not just in 
the context of the pandemic but more 
broadly. We have had corporations for 
more than a generation now offshoring 
work and business to China and other 
places. 
Because 
they 
are 
seeking 
cheaper production and labor costs, 
these companies have been moving pro-
duction of manufactured goods over-
seas, often to China. When you move 
your supply chain overseas, you are at 
the mercy of the laws and regulations 
of the country you move to, and in this 
case, you are at the mercy of the Chi-
nese Communist Party. 
Now, this isn’t a big problem when 
offshoring goes to allied or liberal de-
mocracies, allied or liberal democratic 
countries, but it does become a prob-
lem when the offshoring goes to foreign 
adversaries like China and Russia that 
don’t play by the rules. 
So how do we solve the problem? How 
do we ensure that the panic and the 
powerlessness that we all experienced 
way back in the spring of 2020 and be-
yond—how do we make sure that 
doesn’t happen again? How do we make 
sure that the most powerful Nation in 
the world, the most powerful Nation in 
human history, is not at the mercy of 
the Chinese Communist Party or the 
Russian Federation or any other coun-
try—at their mercy not just generally 
but at their mercy for something as 
simple as personal protective equip-
ment, gowns and gloves and masks? 
How do we make sure we are never in 
that predicament again? 
Well, one of the things we need to do 
is have a process to screen outbound 
investment. We have had for the better 
part of 50 years a screen for inbound in-
vestment, OK? We have a committee 
that 
has 
done 
that 
since 
the 
midseventies. All we are doing here 
with this amendment is putting in 
place an outbound investment screen 
so that outbound investment screen 
will make sure that our national secu-
rity interests are not compromised. 
We don’t want to create further de-
pendency on supply chains that are lo-
cated in the countries—where the 
country is a foreign adversary. 
So this amendment 1853 is modeled 
after legislation that I authored a few 
years ago, the National Critical Capa-
bilities Defense Act, where we have re-
introduced a bipartisan bill with Sen-
ator CORNYN, the senior Senator from 
Texas. 
I mentioned earlier that this is three 
Democrats and three Republicans on 
this amendment—Senator CORNYN, as I 
made reference to; Senator STABENOW, 
Democrat 
from 
Michigan; 
Senator 
RUBIO, Republican Senator from Flor-
ida; Senator KAINE, Democrat from 
Virginia; and Senator TILLIS, Repub-
lican Senator from North Carolina. 
They have all supported an amendment 
that would establish this process to 
screen outbound investments and the 
offshoring of critical supply chains to 
foreign adversaries like China and Rus-
sia to ensure the resiliency of critical 
U.S. supply chains. 
It would require that companies dis-
close before—before—they offshore na-
tional critical capabilities to foreign 
adversary—foreign adversaries, plural. 
So it is a commonsense approach to 
deal with a problem that preexists the 
pandemic but came into sharp focus 
when we were totally at the mercy of 
the Chinese Communist Party. 
The review process is designed to 
identify vulnerabilities and to provide 
a suite of recommendations to the 
President, and it emphasizes remedial 
action such as support to domestic in-
dustries, like increased research and 
development investment, utilization of 
manufacturing institutes, among oth-
ers. 
The 
proposal 
encourages 
supply 
chain diversity, and the bill is limited 
in scope, only covering foreign adver-
saries like China and Russia. It is lim-
ited in its purview. It looks only at na-
tional critical capacities. 
The amendment establishes an inter-
agency committee led by the U.S. 
Trade Representative to oversee the re-
view process for capacities that are 
deemed ‘‘critical’’ to U.S. national se-
curity. 
This committee would focus on out-
bound investment or offshoring of 
these critical capacities, supply chains, 
domestic production, and manufac-
turing to foreign adversaries. I would 
note the committee would not—would 
not—review outbound investments to 
allied countries or any country not on 
the affirmative list. 
The amendment would also establish 
a process to conduct outgoing—I am 
sorry—ongoing evaluation of critical 
supply chains. In short, the amend-
ment would ensure the United States 
can respond to the needs of our Nation 
and those who may call upon us in 
times of crisis. 
But here is the problem: This com-
monsense, bipartisan amendment, in a 
town that doesn’t do a lot of biparti-
sanship, is being opposed by corporate 
interests. Powerful corporate interests 
are opposed to this amendment and, in 
some 
cases, 
are 
actively 
working 
against it to shut it down. 
There has been a whisper campaign 
by corporate lobbyists to kill this bi-
partisan amendment that protects our 
national security. They are lobbying 
against 
an 
amendment—against 
an 
amendment—that 
will 
ensure 
the 
United States has better visibility on 
supply chain vulnerabilities so we can 
respond to the needs of our Nation and 
those who call upon us in these times 
of crisis. 
If a company wants to offshore semi-
conductors to China, we need to know 
about it, and the President could block 
it if that activity is a risk to national 
security. Yet business interests like 
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the 
U.S.-China Business Council are orga-
nizing against this commonsense pro-
posal. 
And, as I mentioned earlier, these 
groups of big corporations are hiding 
behind their trade associations to do 
the work that they are doing. They are 
fearmongering, and they are spreading

misinformation. This effort is not sur-
prising because often you have that in 
Washington. We have interests that 
come together, even in the face of 
something that would help our na-
tional security. 
Our Nation and workers pay dearly 
when companies prioritize their bot-
tom line over supply chain resiliency 
and security. When they offshore jobs 
and technology to foreign adversaries 
like China, our country pays for that, 
pays dearly. 
I mentioned the U.S.-China Business 
Council and their opposition. The asso-
ciation for businesses—that is what 
this is—the association for businesses 
in China—businesses in China, and 
they are opposing. 
So they have got a basic choice to 
make here, not just that organization 
but any organization in any company. 
It is a real simple choice. You can 
choose national security and a com-
monsense way to do that, in a bipar-
tisan amendment, or you can just 
choose profits in places controlled by 
foreign adversaries. It is a real simple 
choice. This is not complicated. They 
will try to make it complicated, but it 
is not. 
Let me start to address some of their 
arguments. I mentioned earlier that 
the industry says that covered prod-
ucts are defined in a ‘‘vague way’’—a 
‘‘vague way.’’ That is what they say. 
That is not true. We provide specifics 
on 
personal 
protective 
equipment, 
medical equipment, goods that are 
critical to the electricity grid or dis-
aster preparedness, and we expect a ro-
bust 
rulemaking 
process. 
Everyone 
knows that. When you pass a bill like 
this or a policy like this, rulemaking 
follows. We specifically and clearly 
state that rulemaking needs to provide 
specifics for firms to understand what 
and when—what they need to disclose 
and when they need to disclose it. 
We limit review exclusively to for-
eign adversaries like China and Russia. 
If a U.S. firm is offshoring critical ca-
pacities to a foreign adversary, the 
U.S. Government should know about it. 
But again, that only applies to out-
bound investment to foreign adver-
saries. We are not talking about out-
bound investment to Germany. We are 
not talking about outbound investment 
to Canada or Australia. We are talking 
about China and Russia here. 
So we took business comments, and 
we took edits from business groups 
around the country. We tried to ensure 
it was specific to threats while also 
providing flexibility for the adminis-
tration to adapt and to adjust. 
So what is Big Business really oppos-
ing? They are opposing better visibility 
on when they offshore these critical ca-
pacities to a, in this case, Chinese 
Communist Party, a Communist coun-
try, that happens to be a foreign adver-
sary in so many areas of our bilateral 
relationship. They are opposing better 
visibility on engagement with a gov-
ernment that is involved in gross 
human rights abuses and forced labor 
and oppression of its people. 
The old expression ‘‘Sunlight is the 
best disinfectant’’ applies here. Why 
would we allow a U.S. company to take 
an action that compromises our na-
tional security and disaster prepared-
ness? So we engaged in good faith in 
taking 
reasonable 
comments 
from 
these big business associations. Busi-
nesses offshoring critical capacities to 
foreign adversaries should be every-
one’s concern, not just the concern of 
six Senators in the Senate and some 
others who have spoken in favor. 
Big 
name-brand 
companies 
don’t 
want their names attached to this ef-
fort. That is why they are hiding be-
hind their trade associations. But I 
want to be clear with them and clear to 
those who are listening. We know who 
you are; we know what companies are 
behind this; and we know what you are 
doing. 
I am going to continue to work to 
pass this amendment or, if it ends up in 
a bill form, we are going to pass it be-
cause we are going to take steps here 
in the U.S. Senate, in a bipartisan fash-
ion, to protect U.S. national security 
in this fashion. We are not going away. 
So if these business groups think 
they are making progress today, we are 
going to defeat you. So just get ready 
for it because we are going to defeat 
you. 
Now, I will hold some comments that 
I was going to make about some others 
who are opposing this. I will limit my 
comments today. 
I want to just conclude with this 
thought. A lot of Members of this body 
talk really tough about China. They 
act tough with China. They give a lot 
of speeches. You know, there is a lot of 
hot air about China. They go on tele-
vision and talk about it, but then 
sometimes when it comes to taking on 
big interests, they cut and run. I would 
hope that those three Republican Sen-
ators aren’t the only Senators on their 
side who are willing to stand up for 
this critical national security issue. 
Again, it is a real simple choice. It is 
national security or getting profits at 
the mercy of a Chinese Communist 
Party. We are asking for a vote on this 
amendment. 
I yield the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from New York. 
UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST—S. 1520 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to once again call for this 
entire body to have the opportunity to 
consider the Military Justice Improve-
ment and Increasing Prevention Act, 
which would ensure people in the mili-
tary who have been subjected to sexual 
assault and other serious crimes get 
the justice they deserve. 
I rise on behalf of the supporters of 
this bill, including a bipartisan, fili-
buster-proof group of 65 Senators, 
major veterans service organizations, 
and the veterans they represent. Every 
day we delay a vote on this bill is an-
other day that their voices are being 
silenced. 
Our legislation makes the common-
sense reform that our veterans and our 
servicemembers have asked for. It 
takes a decision on whether to pros-
ecute serious crimes out of the chain of 
command and moves it to independent, 
trained, military prosecutors. This will 
create a system that is free of bias and 
capable of fairly trying these complex 
crimes. 
This legislation, as I mentioned, is 
supported by the Nation’s major vet-
erans service organizations. These or-
ganizations recognize that this reform 
would build a military justice system 
worthy of the service of our members— 
a system that delivers justice, con-
sequences, and convictions. 
This bill is supported by the Iraq and 
Afghanistan 
Veterans 
of 
America. 
Their CEO, Jeremy Butler said: 
The status quo with our military chain of 
command’s response to military sexual as-
sault is not working and this continuing 
threat to our military requires this common-
sense solution to protect our servicemem-
bers. 
It is supported by the American Le-
gion, which recognizes that this legis-
lation will ‘‘improv[e] the system by 
which the Department of Defense in-
vestigates 
and 
prosecutes 
reported 
cases of military sexual trauma so that 
it is on par with the civilian system.’’ 
It is supported by Protect Our De-
fenders. Retired Col. Don Christensen, 
the president of Protect Our Defenders 
said: 
Every year, generals come before Congress 
and tell Congress that sexual assault is a 
cancer in the force. This is a readiness issue. 
This is a force protection issue. This is an 
issue that drives out thousands of good men 
and women every year who want to serve. 
This [reform] will finally see the justice that 
our members deserve and the prevention 
they deserve. 
It is supported by the Vietnam Vet-
erans of America. In a letter of support 
for this legislation, national president 
John Rowan wrote: 
After decades of hearing that the military 
will not tolerate military sexual assaults 
and that it has zero tolerance of such, the 
numbers continue to climb. 
Vietnam Veterans of America be-
lieves it is time to make real change to 
the process if real action is to be taken 
in its attention to the victims and the 
violence. Fear of reporting the crime of 
sexual assault is a barrier in addressing 
the justice these victims deserve. Their 
legal 
counsel 
and 
defense 
counsel 
should be no less than a civilian re-
ceives in our court system. 
This bill is supported by the Veterans 
of Foreign Wars, which accounts for 
more than 1.5 million veterans as mem-
bers. It is supported by Common De-
fense. It is supported by SWAN, the 
Service Women’s Action Network. It is 
supported by the Veterans Recovery 
Project. It is supported by the National 
Alliance to End Sexual Violence and 
the National Coalition Against Domes-
tic Violence. 
These are veterans. These are our 
constituents, our fellow Americans, 
and these are people who have put 
their lives on the line for this country 
and seen firsthand the way the current

military justice system fails our serv-
icemembers. They know better than 
anyone else what change needs to be 
made, and they are asking to pass this 
bill. 
Do not silence their voices. Let this 
vote come to the floor. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Iowa. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I rise 
again today in support of my colleague 
in calling for consideration of the Mili-
tary Justice Improvement and Increas-
ing Prevention Act. This is an effort 
whose time has come for serious debate 
and consideration on the Senate floor. 
For 8 years, the Senate Armed Serv-
ices Committee, on which Senator 
GILLIBRAND and I sit, has worked on 
countless efforts to seek justice for vic-
tims of sexual assault, all within the 
chain of command. Many of these were 
good provisions pushed by myself and 
others to reduce the barriers in report-
ing sexual assaults. Provisions focused 
on 
both 
prevention 
and 
professionalization of military courts 
handling sexual assault cases and ef-
forts to improve the culture and ensure 
all enlistees receive sexual assault pre-
vention training before attendance at 
their initial training. This is just to 
name a few. 
What has brought me here today sup-
porting this effort with Senator GILLI-
BRAND and Senator GRASSLEY, with 64 
cosponsors in the Senate, is that while 
these efforts were well-intentioned, our 
plague continues. That is not OK with 
me as a combat veteran, a former com-
mander, and sexual assault survivor 
myself. 
If our military is going to face the 
threats of the decades ahead, we will 
need a force that is free from the 
threats in its own ranks. As I men-
tioned, this legislation has 64 bipar-
tisan cosponsors and more than 50 per-
cent of committee members’ support. 
It is the right bill at the right time, 
and we must not delay any further. So 
I join with Senator GILLIBRAND in a 
call for consideration of this bill. 
I yield back to the Senator from New 
York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that at 
a time to be determined by the major-
ity leader in consultation with the Re-
publican leader, the Senate Armed 
Services Committee be discharged from 
further consideration of S. 1520 and the 
Senate proceed to its consideration; 
that there be 2 hours of debate equally 
divided in the usual form; and that 
upon the use or yielding back of the 
time, the Senate vote on the bill with 
no intervening action or debate. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Is there objection? 
Mr. REED. Madam President. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. REED. Reserving my right to ob-
ject. For the reasons I articulated on 
Monday, I object. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Objection is heard. 
The Senator from New York. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. I suggest the ab-
sence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
MILITARY APPRECIATION MONTH 
Ms. ERNST. Madam President, just 1 
percent of the U.S. population serves in 
the defense of our great Nation. Amer-
ica owes an immeasurable debt of grat-
itude to this small number of citizens 
who give so much to protect our free-
doms and our way of life. 
May is Military Appreciation Month, 
so on behalf of the people of Iowa and 
me personally, I want to thank each 
and every one of the women and men of 
our Armed Forces and their families. 
We may celebrate you in May, but we 
appreciate you every single day. You 
are the ones whom we call upon to de-
fend our Nation from our foreign adver-
saries and rogue actors who intend to 
harm us. You are the ones we called 
upon when COVID–19 seeped into our 
borders and shut down America. You 
stood guard to ensure our way of life 
succeeds. Thank you for being the 
greatest fighting force on the face of 
the planet. 
After 23 years of my own military 
service, with great pride, I now get to 
watch as my daughter soon embarks on 
her career as an Army officer. 
Libby, thank you for your willing-
ness to serve and the sacrifices you 
have committed to. 
While serving in the military is one 
of the most rewarding experiences, it is 
not easy. As we approach Memorial 
Day, we must all take time to remem-
ber the servicemembers and their fami-
lies who have paid the ultimate price, 
laying down their lives for our great 
Nation. 
Iowa has lost 158 of our sons and 
daughters in Iraq and Afghanistan, 2 in 
Panama or Grenada, 7 in the first Per-
sian Gulf war, and 867 in Vietnam. Our 
Korean and world wars numbers were 
in the thousands. 
While I won’t be able to individually 
honor all of these heroes, today I would 
like to echo a few names in remem-
brance of Iowans we lost in the defense 
of our Nation. 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
GUNNERY SERGEANT JEFFREY E. BOHR 
Madam President, Marine GySgt Jef-
frey E. Bohr, Jr., is from the tiny farm 
town of Ossian. He was 39 years old 
when he was killed on April 10, 2003, 
after a 7-hour gun battle in front of a 
Baghdad, Iraq, mosque. 
Gunnery Sergeant Bohr served a 20- 
year career as an Army Ranger and 
then a Marine. He was assigned to 1st 
Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment, Camp 
Pendleton, CA, at the time of his 
death. He was the first Iowan killed by 
enemy fire in Operation Iraqi Freedom, 
and he was posthumously awarded the 
Silver Star. 
Gunnery Sergeant Bohr left behind 
his wife Lori, who is also a native of 
Iowa. 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
SERGEANT JAMES C. KEARNEY III 
Madam President, Army SGT James 
C. Kearney III—I know him as Jamie. 
He was an Iowa National Guardsman 
from Emerson, which is 10 miles from 
where I grew up. I knew Jamie before 
he enlisted in the Iowa Army National 
Guard. He was very excited about his 
enlistment, and he told me about his 
excitement and how he felt that he had 
found a place that truly rewarded him. 
He was 22 years old when he died on 
November 1, 2004, in Salerno, Afghani-
stan, from injuries he sustained when 
his convoy was attacked by enemy 
forces using rocket-propelled grenades 
and small arms fire in Afghanistan. 
Sergeant Kearney was assigned to 1st 
Battalion, 168th Infantry, in Glenwood, 
IA, at his death. He was posthumously 
promoted to the rank of sergeant and 
awarded a Bronze Star with a ‘‘V’’ de-
vice for valor. He was the first Iowan 
killed in Operation Enduring Freedom, 
and our community misses Jamie to 
this day. 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
PETTY OFFICER 2ND CLASS JAIME S. JAENKE 
Madam President, Navy PO2 Jaime 
Jaenke was a naval reservist and a na-
tive of Iowa Falls. She is beautiful, 
isn’t she? She was 30 years old when 
she was killed on June 5, 2006, in Al 
Anbar Province, Iraq, when a roadside 
bomb struck the Humvee that she was 
riding in. 
She was assigned to the Naval Mobile 
Construction Battalion 25, based in 
Fort McCoy, WI, at her death. She was 
posthumously awarded the Navy-Ma-
rine Corps Commendation Medal with 
‘‘V’’ for valor. 
She left behind her daughter, Kayla. 
She was the first woman killed in Oper-
ation Iraqi Freedom from Iowa. 
HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES 
LANCE CORPORAL ADAM FRANKLIN WOLF 
Madam President, LCpl Adam Frank-
lin Wolf is from Eldon. He was 25 years 
old when he was killed on June 20, 2014, 
in 
Helmand 
Province, 
Afghanistan, 
when a vehicle-borne improvised explo-
sive device detonated near his vehicle. 
He was assigned to the 2nd Combat 
Engineer Battalion, 2nd Marine Divi-
sion, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force, 
from Camp Lejeune, NC. 
He is Iowa’s most recent fatality. His 
twin brother and family survive him. 
HONORING GOLD STAR FAMILIES 
Madam President, another group of 
strength and resiliency I want to ac-
knowledge today is our Gold Star fami-
lies. They are the ones left behind in 
battle and in war. We owe it to the he-
roes who gave their all to protect and 
care for their families and their com-
munities. 
To every Gold Star family, thank 
you. Thank you for the sacrifices you

have made and continue to make every 
day. I assure you, you are not alone or 
forgotten. 
I would like to take just a brief mo-
ment of silence in honor of those we 
lost in combat or due to everlasting 
combat injuries. 
Thank you. 
I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tem-
pore. The clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to 
call the roll. 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
OSSOFF). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
S. 1260 
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, we know 
that some of our biggest competitors 
around the world spend billions in 
propping up state-owned enterprises 
and investing in research and develop-
ment. They have also gotten pretty 
good at taking our ideas, monetizing 
them, and using them to compete—and 
sometimes 
cheat—against 
American 
businesses while paying their workers 
less and giving those workers fewer 
protections and rights. China is often 
the worst offender. 
Ohio workers know all too well what 
happens to their jobs and their commu-
nities when they are forced to compete 
with Chinese companies that break the 
rules, pay poverty wages, and are 
propped up by the government. We are 
working to change that this week. 
I want the technologies that will 
drive the next generation of U.S. eco-
nomic growth and manufacturing— 
from semiconductors to hydrogen buses 
to the next-generation jet engine—to 
be developed in America and to put 
people to work in good-paying jobs in 
our country. 
This is something we should all agree 
on. It is what we are working to do 
with this comprehensive, bipartisan 
bill. 
This package is packed with invest-
ment in research and development, 
technology, and high-tech domestic 
manufacturing that will again set us 
up to lead the world. It supports Amer-
ican manufacturing and innovation. It 
gives businesses the tools to compete. 
It supports American workers—the en-
gine behind our success. 
It includes my Build America, Buy 
America Act to strengthen our ‘‘Buy 
American’’ 
rules 
and 
ensure 
that 
American tax dollars go towards Amer-
ican-made products that create Amer-
ican jobs. 
This provision is the result of bipar-
tisan partnership. I would like to 
thank my colleague from my State, 
Senator PORTMAN, and also Senators 
PETERS and STABENOW from Michigan, 
Senator BALDWIN from Wisconsin, and 
Senator BRAUN from Indiana for their 
work. 
Our legislation would apply ‘‘Buy 
American’’ rules to all taxpayer-funded 
infrastructure 
and 
public 
works 
projects. When we ensure our tax dol-
lars are spent on American products, 
these tax dollars go further in the 
economy. We employ more workers 
who spend on local businesses and lift 
up everyone. 
When we say ‘‘Buy American,’’ we 
mean ‘‘Buy American’’—not import a 
steel slab from China, make it into a 
pipe, and stamp on it ‘‘Made in Amer-
ica.’’ We need to make sure these rules 
are thorough, tough, and effective. 
That is exactly what this provision 
does. 
This bill also gives our country tough 
new tools to crack down on China’s 
cheating. 
Banking 
and 
Housing 
Committee 
Ranking Member TOOMEY and I worked 
together on an amendment to take on 
Chinese espionage against our econ-
omy. The amendment is the product of 
months of bipartisan negotiation. I 
thank Senator TOOMEY and his bipar-
tisan staff. 
The 
Presiding 
Officer, 
Senator 
OSSOFF, is a new member of that com-
mittee and has contributed greatly on 
this and other projects we have done. 
Our plan directly confronts action by 
the Chinese Government and Chinese 
firms that hurt American workers and 
companies by stealing their valuable 
intellectual property. These measures 
were developed by Senator VAN HOL-
LEN. They require mandatory imposi-
tion of powerful new sanctions on Chi-
nese actors who steal U.S. trade se-
crets. 
The United States remains a global 
center for research, development, and 
innovation, and for years, people have 
been stealing our ideas. China is the 
worst offender; we know that. The Chi-
nese Government and the companies it 
props up engage in systematic and 
growing espionage against our busi-
nesses and our workers. The theft of 
trade secrets costs the United States as 
much as $540 billion every year. 
Our plan would give the President 
new tools to go after Chinese actors 
who target our country with cyber at-
tacks. Americans have all seen over 
the past few weeks how serious cyber 
attacks are, how they can disrupt our 
entire economy. We need strong tools 
to punish these attackers and the 
countries that finance and support 
them. 
Sanctions are just one new tool this 
package includes to increase American 
competitiveness. 
We will build on the success of our bi-
partisan Revitalize American Manufac-
turing and Innovation Act to create 
more manufacturing innovation hubs 
around the country. 
Back in 2014, I worked with Repub-
lican Senator ROY
BLUNT
and the 
Obama administration to pass the Re-
vitalize American Manufacturing and 
Innovation Act. This landmark bill cre-
ated a national network of advanced 
manufacturing hubs. It was one of the 
biggest steps we had taken as a coun-
try in a long time to make our manu-
facturing more competitive. 
America Makes in Youngstown—the 
first of its kind, the first in this pro-
gram—started as a pilot program back 
9 years ago. It became the first hub in 
that network. 
I thank my colleagues for their work 
on this. I thank especially two mem-
bers of my staff who are on the floor 
today, Abigail Duggan and Megan 
Malara, for the work they have done. I 
thank my colleagues for moving for-
ward on this very important act. 
I yield the floor. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oklahoma. 
ETHIOPIA 
Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, over the 
weekend, the State Department—that 
is, 
our 
State 
Department—imposed 
visa restrictions on several Ethiopian 
and 
Eritrean 
Government 
officials. 
They claim these officials have not 
done enough to end the hostilities in 
the Tigray area. 
Now, the Tigray area is in the north-
ern part of Ethiopia, and it is an area 
that is one of the very old parts of that 
continent. 
First, we need to be clear. Everyone, 
especially the Ethiopian Government, 
wants nothing more than a peaceful 
resolution 
to 
the 
conflict 
in 
the 
Tigray, but this action puts the ter-
rorist organization TPLF—that is a 
terrorist organization—on equal status 
with the Ethiopian Government. Now, 
that is unacceptable, and it is wrong. It 
is outrageous that we have them in the 
same issue as if they are somehow 
equals. 
Let me say something to be 100 per-
cent clear, to make sure no one can 
misunderstand this, and that is that 
humanitarian atrocities are wrong and 
have no place in our world. I am proud 
that Prime Minister Abiy of Ethiopia 
has clearly stated that any atrocities 
are not condoned by the government 
and those responsible will be held ac-
countable. That is going to happen. 
To truly understand this issue and 
why putting the Ethiopian Government 
on equal footing with the TPLF is so 
offensive and downright wrong, you 
need to understand how we got here. 
Indulge with me in just a little bit of 
history. 
Now, I know the changes Ethiopia 
has seen over the last decade. Since 
2005, I have visited Ethiopia 19 different 
times, engaging and developing rela-
tionships with Prime Ministers, Cabi-
net 
Ministers, 
legislators, 
businesspeople, aid workers, and every-
one else in between. I say this to show 
that I know Ethiopia probably better 
than anyone else in this Chamber. But 
more than that, I know its history. 
Ethiopia is the oldest independent 
country in all of Africa but one that is 
newly democratic. That comes with 
problems, and we understand that. 
The current controversy and why we 
are here today started back in the 1970s 
with a man named Mengistu. From 1974 
to 1991, Mengistu was the leader of the 
Communist Derg. That is the Com-
munist Party in Ethiopia. This was the

controlling party at the time. It is a 
Communist Party. They ran Ethiopia. 
It was a terrible time for Ethiopia. 
That was during one of the worst fam-
ines they ever had on that continent or 
actually anywhere. It killed over a mil-
lion people. That might be the most 
significant famine in history in terms 
of deaths. 
Then, in 1991, the Communists were 
booted out. At the time that this took 
place, one person who was responsible 
for the getting rid of the Derg Com-
munists and the Communist threat in 
Ethiopia was a guy named Meles. He 
was a member of the Tigrayan political 
party. 
Now, we got to know him quite well. 
He is the one who got communism out 
of that part of the world. He ended up 
as Prime Minister. This is really the 
election that a lot of people don’t like, 
and they forget about the fact that he 
was the Prime Minister who actually 
got rid of the Communists in Ethiopia. 
So he became the Prime Minister. He 
started to build democracy. He died in 
2012. I got to know him quite well dur-
ing his lifetime, and I saw the progress 
that he made and the advances that 
they made. 
He was then replaced by another 
Prime 
Minister 
whose 
name 
is 
Hailemariam. Now he became Prime 
Minister, and he continued to push for 
democracy. Hailemariam worked dili-
gently to improve things. Under his 
tenure, Ethiopia established the Inde-
pendent Ethiopian Human Rights Com-
mittee that reported on violence and 
human rights problems, and it was tre-
mendously successful. They didn’t just 
establish it; they acted on it. They 
came out with a report and acted on it 
to hold perpetrators accountable and 
to make the improvements that were 
being made at that time. Our relation-
ship wasn’t just government-to-govern-
ment; it was brother-to-brother. 
In February of 2017, Prime Minister 
Hailemariam suggested that since the 
provinces were all fighting at one 
time—and at that time, there were 
nine provinces in Ethiopia. Each prov-
ince had a Governor. We suggested on 
the phone with the Members of the 
Senate here in Washington and the 
House prayer group in the House of 
Representatives that what we ought to 
do is follow the recommendation of Ei-
senhower. We are talking about former 
General Eisenhower, President Eisen-
hower. He was a great, great President 
of the United States. This was right 
after World War II. He said—this is a 
quote. I am quoting Eisenhower now. 
He said: 
The problems of this world are so great 
that we will never resolve the problems until 
we learn to sit down and pray together. 
So we decided, let’s all get the Gov-
ernors, the Prime Minister, Members of 
the House, Members of the Senate, and 
the rest all together, and we will pray 
with them. We did this. In fact, we had 
five Senators with me at that time, 
and we went over. The problem was, 
only two of the Governors showed up, 
out of nine, so it didn’t work. 
Eight months later, we had occasion 
to be back there, and we put together 
the same thing, but we talked to them 
to let them know—we talked to the 
Governors at that time, the nine Gov-
ernors who were in Ethiopia. So we got 
them and explained what it was all 
about. The Governors who had been 
fighting with each other and had been 
fighting with Hailemariam all prayed 
together, and we were joined in prayer 
by 18 Members of the U.S. House of 
Representatives. We were joined with 
them by phone, and the Prime Minister 
and all of us, Members of the Senate 
and others who were there, we all re-
joiced and embraced each other. 
That was really significant. The nine 
Governors had never been together be-
fore. They didn’t like each other. They 
never had been in the same room be-
fore. But most of the people didn’t live 
in cities, and that made this effort that 
much more difficult. The vast majority 
of people who live there are in rural 
communities, and that made this wide-
spread change in development a longer 
and more difficult path. 
In Ethiopia, the tribal factions also 
played a great role. If you go from 
province to province, that used to be 
from tribe to tribe, and they histori-
cally have not gotten along until this 
time. So it made it more difficult be-
cause of the factions and all of that, 
but it worked. We unified them to-
gether, and that was unlike anything 
that has ever happened. 
One of the Governors who was there 
at the time was named Dr. Abiy. You 
might remember that name because he 
is now the Prime Minister of Ethiopia. 
I have often said that Dr. Abiy is argu-
ably the most educated, the smartest 
guy I have seen in that position in—of 
the entire continent of Africa. He is 
just a tremendous person. 
We got them together at a leaders 
breakfast. We put something together 
where he told the story of his journey 
in faith in Jesus. This is Dr. Abiy. 
We met a year later, where we prayed 
and talked about how to unify the 
country in peace, not conflict. It is 
from these meetings that I know Abiy 
is committed to democracy and com-
mitted to the future of Ethiopia. He is 
showing that with his actions as well. 
Abiy was elected Prime Minister in 
2018 after active and spirited protests 
against the existing ruling party, the 
Ethiopian 
People’s 
Revolutionary 
Democratic Front, which had run the 
country for almost 30 years. Abiy was 
elected by a country looking for fresh 
leadership. He immediately took steps 
to create positive change. He promised 
unity and reconciliation, and against 
all odds, he delivered. He passed liberal 
democratic reforms, and he freed polit-
ical prisoners and journalists. Abiy 
even did what was once believed impos-
sible: He negotiated a peace treaty 
with Eritrea after decades of long cold 
war and was recognized with a Nobel 
Peace Prize for his work. He was the 
recipient of a Nobel Peace Prize for all 
the wonderful work he had done. That 
was in Africa. It was a leading oper-
ation. 
So how does all this play into the sit-
uation before us today? The Ethiopian 
People’s Democratic Front—the pre-
vious ruling party—is dominated by 
people from Tigray, the area up north 
that we talked about before, one of the 
regional provinces. 
When Abiy set up a new governing 
body and focused on governing for the 
whole of Ethiopia, and not just a few 
politically powerful regions, the TPLF 
wasn’t happy. That is the terrorist 
group. They felt like they were losing 
the outsized influence that they held 
for decades and decades. 
They also weren’t happy about the 
peace deal with Eritrea, the TPLF, who 
were ruling Ethiopia in the 1990s when 
the bitter Eritrea-Ethiopian conflict 
was going on. Decades later, they still 
feel aggrieved and didn’t want peace. 
The result, they started acting out. 
In 2019, they started to refuse to par-
ticipate in the new government and the 
new ruling party. They expressed their 
frustration in more overt and desta-
bilizing ways. They held their own re-
gional parliamentary elections in Sep-
tember 
during 
the 
height 
of 
the 
coronavirus pandemic instead of agree-
ing with the other provinces and the 
Prime Minister that they should be 
postponed because of the pandemic. 
The 
militia 
affiliated 
with 
the 
TPLF—that is the terrorist group that 
has been designated by the Ethiopian 
Parliament as a terrorist group—at-
tacked an Ethiopian army base in 
Mekelle on November 4 and stole weap-
ons there. 
Let me restate this plainly. A re-
gional party, TPLF, attacked a govern-
ment military base. The government 
rightfully responded, and the regional 
terrorist group is well equipped and has 
been fighting back and continuing the 
conflict for a long period of time now. 
That is what is going on right now. 
That is the situation we find ourselves 
in, and that is why it is astounding to 
me that our government continues to 
treat this situation with both sides 
being equal when clearly they are not. 
One side is the democratically elected 
government, and the other side is a dis-
gruntled faction that is reacting with 
violence because they are no longer in 
power. It is a terrorist group. 
And again, the Ethiopian Govern-
ment has been clear that they do not 
condone any of the reported atrocities, 
and they will hold anyone who com-
mits atrocities accountable. We, the 
United States, need to continue to en-
gage Ethiopia and try to understand 
how what we are seeing today is a 
product years in the making. It is not 
a simple matter of two aggrieved par-
ties. It is Prime Minister Abiy working 
to protect a unified, peaceful, stable 
Ethiopia. 
We should be talking to him about 
how we can help him restore peace, not 
slapping punitive sanctions on his gov-
ernment—an action that does nothing 
but demonstrate that we can’t or won’t

appreciate the history and the regional 
differences that lead to this situation. 
And I want to close by speaking to 
Prime Minister Abiy and our friends in 
Ethiopia directly: Brother, I am with 
you. Those of us who understand the 
history of what you are facing and 
what you are working to support, we 
are with you, Prime Minister Abiy. 
With that, I yield the floor. 
I suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
proceeded to call the roll. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER 
(Mr. 
KELLY). Without objection, it is so or-
dered. 
f 
COVID–19 ORIGIN ACT OF 2021 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, we are 
here tonight for a very simple reason 
with a very simple proposition—that 
the American people deserve to know 
about the origins of COVID–19. They 
deserve to know how this terrible pan-
demic that has ravaged the globe and 
our country, how it got started and 
what China’s role was in starting it. 
Now, we have seen a parade of gov-
ernment officials speculate about the 
origins in one place or another. And 
there is increasing speculation and, in-
deed, increasing numbers of statements 
from government officials saying that 
perhaps this virus originated in a Chi-
nese lab, in the Wuhan Institute of Vi-
rology. 
Well, I think it is time that the 
American people got to decide for 
themselves. It is time that they actu-
ally got to see the evidence that the 
U.S. Government has collected on this 
issue, and that is exactly what the 
measure that we are introducing here 
tonight would do. It would make avail-
able to the American people the evi-
dence that the U.S. Government has 
about the origins of this terrible virus 
and this terrible pandemic. 
I am proud to be joined in this effort 
by Senator BRAUN, and I know that he 
would like to make a few remarks. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Indiana. 
Mr. BRAUN. Thank you, Senator 
HAWLEY. 
This was an easy one. Over the week-
end, the Wall Street Journal gave us 
some news. We have had a cascade of 
others weighing in now, where this is 
maybe an epiphany that some have had 
that we need to look further into the 
roots. 
Look at what our country has gone 
through. It has been a year and a quar-
ter, and it has ravaged not only the 
United States but the world. And why, 
for the sake of simple transparency, 
wouldn’t we want to get to the root 
cause of it? 
The World Health Organization made 
an attempt at it. It was not effective. 
It looked to me like it was apologizing 
for what might have occurred in China. 
President Biden finally has said that 
we need to put more light and atten-
tion on this. So thank goodness, for 
whatever the reason, we are going to 
get to the bottom of it. When it has 
caused this much grief across our coun-
try and across the world, it needs to be 
done. 
The intelligence communities in our 
own country are storing information 
that needs to be revealed to the Amer-
ican public. It needs to be revealed to 
anyone who can look at it to make 
sense out of what has happened. 
So our bill is very simple. 
Since I have been in the Senate, 
whether it is weighing in on issues of 
healthcare, national security, COVID– 
19—who disagrees with transparency, 
the sunshine that reveals everything? 
I was in a committee hearing. And 
when you get the two individuals 
whom we have relied on mostly in this 
whole journey, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Col-
lins, first acknowledging that trans-
parency is paramount, and that, yes, 
we should declassify this information, 
and when we have listened to them 
help navigate us through this tricky 
journey, and they tell us earlier today, 
‘‘Give us the information,’’ I think 
that is why here, this evening, this will 
go through with unanimous consent, 
because it makes sense. 
And wherever it leads us, we should 
be happy that we finally might get to 
the bottom of this—whatever it re-
veals. We don’t know where it will take 
us. It is relying on what is most impor-
tant—on the information we housed. 
Let’s make sure the American public 
can see it and that any group that 
wants to analyze what happened can, 
including the rest of the world. 
So it was easy for me to get onboard, 
to get behind something so simple that 
says nothing more than if we got the 
information, let’s show it. Let’s not 
hide behind it. And when you get indi-
viduals like Dr. Fauci, Dr. Collins, the 
director now of the WHO, something is 
afoot, and we need to find out. 
I am glad that we are here this 
evening punctuating this so that we 
get it done. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Missouri. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, the 
American people can be trusted with 
the truth. More than that, the Amer-
ican people deserve the truth. 
They deserve to know the true ori-
gins of this virus. They deserve to be 
able to evaluate the evidence for them-
selves. They deserve it. Their govern-
ment owes it to them, and it is time to 
act. 
And the American people deserve 
something else. They deserve to have 
this government hold accountable that 
nation which started this virus, whose 
lies about this virus turned it into a 
global pandemic, whose lies about this 
virus prevented our country and many 
others from being able to address it ef-
fectively in time. Of course, I am talk-
ing about China. The American people 
deserve to have all of the evidence and 
deserve to have this government’s full 
effort and the effort of our allies and 
partners in holding accountable China 
for what it has done, not just to this 
country but to the world, and to make 
sure that something like this never 
happens again. 
So, Mr. President, I ask now unani-
mous consent that the Senate proceed 
to the immediate consideration of S. 
1867, which is at desk. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the bill by title. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
A bill (S. 1867) to require the Director of 
National Intelligence to declassify informa-
tion relating to the origin of COVID–19, and 
for other purposes. 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. HAWLEY. I ask unanimous con-
sent that the bill be considered read a 
third time and passed and that the mo-
tion to reconsider be considered made 
and laid upon the table. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The bill (S. 1867) was ordered to be 
engrossed for a third reading, was read 
the third time, and passed, as follows: 
S. 1867 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 
Origin Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Department of State released a fact 
sheet on January 15, 2021, about the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology (WIV) which stated the 
following: 
(A) ‘‘The U.S. government has reason to 
believe that several researchers inside the 
WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the 
first identified case of the outbreak, with 
symptoms consistent with both COVID–19 
and common seasonal illnesses.’’. 
(B) ‘‘WIV researchers conducted experi-
ments involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus 
identified by the WIV in January 2020 as its 
closest sample to SARS–CoV–2.’’. 
(C) ‘‘Despite the WIV presenting itself as a 
civilian institution, the United States has 
determined that the WIV has collaborated on 
publications and secret projects with China’s 
military.’’. 
(2) Former Director of the Centers for Dis-
ease 
Control 
and 
Prevention, 
Robert 
Redfield, stated in March 2021 that, ‘‘the 
most likely etiology of this pathogen in 
Wuhan was from a laboratory’’ and noted 
that, ‘‘[i]t is not unusual for respiratory 
pathogens that are being worked on in a lab-
oratory to infect the laboratory worker.’’. 
(3) Director-General of the World Health 
Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus 
acknowledged 
in 
March 
2021 
that 
the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) may 
have originated in a laboratory and said this 
hypothesis ‘‘requires further investigation, 
potentially with additional missions involv-
ing specialist experts.’’. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) identifying the origin of Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID–19) is critical for pre-
venting a similar pandemic from occurring 
in the future;

May 26, 2021 
(2) there is reason to believe the COVID–19 
pandemic may have originated at the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology; and 
(3) the Director of National Intelligence 
should declassify and make available to the 
public as much information as possible about 
the origin of COVID–19 so the United States 
and like-minded countries can— 
(A) identify the origin of COVID–19 as ex-
peditiously as possible, and 
(B) use that information to take all appro-
priate measures to prevent a similar pan-
demic from occurring again. 
SEC. 4. DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION RE-
LATED TO THE ORIGIN OF COVID–19. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence shall— 
(1) declassify any and all information re-
lating to potential links between the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology and the origin of the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19), includ-
ing— 
(A) activities performed by the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology with or on behalf of the 
People’s Liberation Army; 
(B) coronavirus research or other related 
activities performed at the Wuhan Institute 
of Virology prior to the outbreak of COVID– 
19; and 
(C) researchers at the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology who fell ill in autumn 2019, includ-
ing for any such researcher— 
(i) the researcher’s name; 
(ii) the researcher’s symptoms; 
(iii) the date of the onset of the research-
er’s symptoms; 
(iv) the researcher’s role at the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology; 
(v) whether the researcher was involved 
with or exposed to coronavirus research at 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology; 
(vi) whether the researcher visited a hos-
pital while they were ill; and 
(vii) a description of any other actions 
taken by the researcher that may suggest 
they were experiencing a serious illness at 
the time; and 
(2) submit to Congress an unclassified re-
port that contains— 
(A) all of the information described under 
paragraph (1); and 
(B) only such redactions as the Director 
determines necessary to protect sources and 
methods. 
Mr. HAWLEY. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senate for this action tonight. 
This is, as Senator BRAUN said, an 
important first step. It is only a first 
step, but the truth is always the right 
step, and that is the action that we 
have taken tonight. 
I yield the floor.

Continued 
AMENDMENT NO. 1588 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to 
call up my amendment No. 1588, which 
is cosponsored by Senators GRAHAM 
and LUJA´ N, BARRASSO, and COLLINS. 
This amendment would establish a 
Foundation for Energy Security and 
Innovation, a nonprofit Foundation to 
support the Department of Energy’s 
mission to help raise private capital to 
accelerate the commercialization of 
new and cutting-edge technologies. 
As China has dramatically ramped up 
their R&D funding, our Federal funding 
has remained stagnant, threatening 
U.S. competitiveness and our potential 
to develop, bring to scale, and export 
clean energy technologies. 
This amendment will take a model 
already proven by Foundations affili-
ated with the NIH, the CDC, the De-
partment of Agriculture, and create a 
Foundation to channel private sector 
investments into our world-class sci-
entific innovation institutions, our Na-
tional Labs. 
This new Foundation would support 
the great work already happening at

sage. 
I want to thank my partners, Sen-

AMENDMENT NO. 1929 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, I call up 
my amendment No. 1929 and ask that it 
be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Utah [Mr. LEE] proposes 
an amendment numbered 1929 to amendment 
No. 1502. 
(The amendment is printed in the 
RECORD of May 24, 2021, under ‘‘Text of 
Amendments.’’) 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
are now 2 minutes of debate, equally 
divided, on the amendment. 
The Senator from Utah. 
Mr. LEE. Madam President, the 
United States of America cannot mean-
ingfully 
compete 
with 
Communist 
China. If our own government and if 
our own Federal regulatory system, 
one that 25 years ago was costing the 
American economy $300 billion a year 
and is now costing the American econ-
omy $2 trillion, if that regulatory sys-
tem is hobbling us, we won’t be able to 
compete. 
That is why I introduced this amend-
ment No. 1929, to bring the focus of the 
debate back to where it belongs—back 
to our regulatory challenges. It sets up 
a Regulatory Oversight and Review 
Task Force, composed of OMB, OIRA, 
and people in the private sector with 
expertise in this area. 
The bipartisan task force would have, 
as its job, to conduct annually a review 
of all Federal regulations to figure out 
what is working, what is not working, 
what is harming American job growth, 
and what is helping. 
Congress would then have the oppor-
tunity to review these recommenda-
tions and review recommendations in a 
way that would ultimately bring about 
regulatory reform helping us to com-
pete with Communist China. 
We can’t beat China at its own game. 
We have to beat China by being our 
best selves. That is what amendment 
1929 will do. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Michigan. 
Mr. PETERS. Madam President, this 
measure undermines Federal Agencies’ 
efforts to protect workers, consumers, 
our environment, and public health. 
When Federal Agencies create regula-
tions, they must look at the full range 
of costs and benefits, including the im-
pact on employers, workers, and vul-
nerable groups. 
This measure shuts out most of these 
voices. It is designed to push Congress 
to repeal regulations without consid-
ering the concerns of workers who rely 
on Federal safety standards or commu-
nities whose water has been polluted 
by lead. 
If Congress is concerned about a reg-
ulation, we already have tools to make 
the needed changes—either passing a 
law or using procedures like the Con-
gressional Review Act. We need to 
move forward on bipartisan policies 
that will improve our Nation’s com-
petitiveness, not measures that will en-
danger our constituents and our com-
munities. I urge my colleagues to vote 
no on amendment 1929. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1929 
Mr. LEE. I ask for the yeas and nays.

OFFICER.

ment.

consent

objection, it is so ordered. 
Is there a sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond.

(b) TECHNICAL AMENDMENT.—The table of 
chapters for part I of title 18, United States 
Code, is amended by inserting after the item 
relating to chapter 51 the following: 
‘‘52. Certain types of human-animal 
chimeras prohibited1131.’’. ...........
Mr. BRAUN. Madam President, in re-
cent years, research involving human- 
animal hybrids has become much more 
prevalent. For example, in April, re-
searchers in China created a monkey- 
human hybrid embryo that they al-
lowed to grow and studied for weeks. 
I have serious ethical concerns with 
this type of human chimera research. 
My amendment would ban the practice 
by applying the NIH’s current anti-chi-
mera policy universally. 
Due to the dangerous and offensive 
nature of this research, my amendment 
imposes penalties on those who partici-
pate in this unethical research. 
We must act now. Just this morning, 
the International Society for Stem Cell 
Research, an international standards- 
setting body, issued guidance that per-
mits the creation of human-animal hy-
brids. I ask that my Senate colleagues 
reject this foreign position and main-
tain our own NIH’s ethical standards. 
All life is sacred. It is Congress’s re-
sponsibility to enact commonsense bio-
ethics. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. BRAUN. Please support this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The sen-
ior Senator from Washington. 
Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I 
was just here yesterday reminding my 
colleagues that this is a bipartisan bill 
to help families across our country by 
boosting American’s competitiveness. I 
have said it already. I will say it again. 
That means we have to ensure that 
American 
research 
is 
guided 
by 
science, not ideology. 
This amendment does the exact oppo-
site and undermines scientifically sig-
nificant research that could actually 
help develop new treatments and ulti-
mately lead to lifesaving organ trans-
plants. 
If we are serious about bipartisan 
commitment to American innovation, 
we have to stop these ideological at-
tacks on medical research and focus on 
the science and ultimately the health 
of our patients. 
I urge a ‘‘no’’ vote. Thank you. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1771 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
question is on agreeing to the amend-
ment. 
Mr. BRAUN. I ask for the yeas and 
nays. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a 
sufficient second? 
There appears to be a sufficient sec-
ond. 
The clerk will call the roll. 
The bill clerk called the roll. 
Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the 
Senator 
from 
West 
Virginia 
(Mr. 
MANCHIN) is necessarily absent. 
Mr. THUNE. The following Senators 
are necessarily absent: the Senator 
from Tennessee (Mrs. BLACKBURN) and

TILLIS). 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there

siring to vote or change their vote?

The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this 
vote, the yeas are 48, the nays are 49. 
Under the previous order requiring 60 
votes for the adoption of this amend-
ment, the amendment is rejected. 
The amendment (No. 1771) was re-
jected. 
The junior Senator from Kansas. 
AMENDMENT NO. 1973, AS MODIFIED, TO 
AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, I 
call up my amendment No. 1973, as 
modified, with the changes at the desk 
and ask that it be reported by number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment. 
The senior assistant legislative clerk 
read as follows: 
The Senator from Kansas [Mr. MARSHALL] 
proposes an amendment numbered 1973, as 
modified, to amendment No. 1502. 
The amendment, as modified, is as 
follows: 
(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate 
regarding the need to conduct a com-
prehensive investigation to determine the 
origins of COVID–19, and for other pur-
poses) 
At the appropriate place, insert the fol-
lowing: 
SEC. llll. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SEN-
ATE REGARDING AN INVESTIGATION 
TO DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF 
COVID–19. 
(a) 
FINDINGS.—Congress 
finds 
the 
fol-
lowing: 
(1) COVID–19 has taken the lives of nearly 
3,500,000 individuals around the world. 
(2) 
Understanding 
the 
origins 
of 
the 
COVID–19 pandemic is essential to address-
ing our vulnerabilities and preventing future 
crises. 
(3) In May 2020, the World Health Assembly 
did not authorize a comprehensive investiga-
tion into the origins of COVID–19, and in-
stead passed a significantly limited com-
promise resolution, with Chinese govern-
ment support, which did not explicitly in-
clude in its scope the possibility of a re-
search-related accident. 
(4) The 2020 World Health Assembly resolu-
tion and its terms of reference, which were 
negotiated privately between the World 
Health Organization (in this section referred 
to as ‘‘WHO’’) and Chinese authorities, hand-
ed the Chinese government control over the 
joint-study process by giving the Chinese 
government veto power over which inter-
national experts were allowed to participate 
in the joint study and by agreeing that most 
primary research would be carried out by 
Chinese teams without ensuring broad access 
to primary data by international experts. 
(5) As a result of these terms, the signifi-
cant structural, procedural, and analytical 
shortcomings of the joint study, and the se-
vere restrictions imposed by Chinese au-
thorities, the WHO-convened joint study into 
the origins of COVID–19 was prevented from 
providing a balanced consideration of the 
multiple theories of the origin of COVID–19. 
(6) Only 4 of the 313 pages of the joint- 
study team report and its annexes addressed 
the possibility of a laboratory accident, and 
no thorough examination of the lab incident 
hypothesis was carried out by the joint- 
study team. 
(7) Some of the international experts on 
the joint-study team stated that they lacked 
the means and resources to properly inves-
tigate the research-related accident hypoth-
esis, and they were neither able nor meant to 
do such a full investigation but instead were 
acting as a ‘‘study review group’’. 
(8) 
WHO 
Director-General 
Dr. 
Tedros 
Adhanom Ghebreyesus commented on March 
30, 2021, the day the joint-study report was 
released, ‘‘I do not believe that [the joint- 
study team’s] assessment [of a possible lab 
incident] was extensive enough. Further data 
and studies will be needed to reach more ro-
bust conclusions . . . potentially with addi-
tional missions involving specialist experts, 
which I am ready to deploy.’’. 
(9) The WHO Director-General further com-
mented, ‘‘As far as WHO is concerned all 
hypotheses remain on the table . . . We have 
not yet found the source of the virus, and we 
must continue to follow the science and 
leave no stone unturned as we do . . . It is 
clear that we need more research across a 
range of areas, which will entail further field 
visits.’’. 
(10) The March 30, 2021 Joint Statement on 
the WHO-convened COVID–19 Origins Study 
by the United States and 13 other countries 
recognized the severe shortcomings of the 
joint-study process and called for ‘‘a trans-
parent and independent analysis and evalua-
tion, free from interference and undue influ-
ence.’’. 
(11) In spite of the devastation the COVID– 
19 pandemic has caused in the United States 
and around the world, no process currently 
exists to ensure a comprehensive investiga-
tion into the source of COVID–19. 
(12) Such an investigation is essential for 
ensuring this type of crisis never happens 
again for the benefit of all people, all na-
tions, and future generations. 
(b) SENSE OF THE SENATE.—It is the sense 
of the Senate that— 
(1) a comprehensive investigation to deter-
mine the origins of COVID–19 must be con-
ducted by WHO immediately, with access to 
all relevant records, samples, and personnel 
in China, and that such investigation must 
fully explore all possible sources of the 
COVID–19 pandemic, including exclusively 
‘‘natural’’ zoonosis in the wild, human con-
tamination in an animal farm, and a re-
search-related accident; 
(2) the United States delegation to the 
World Health Assembly should, in concert 
with allies and partners around the world, 
work to ensure that an international sci-
entific investigation into the origins of 
COVID–19, with full access to all relevant 
records, samples, and personnel in China, 
will be authorized by the World Health As-
sembly and implemented with extreme ur-
gency; and 
(3) should such a full investigation not be 
authorized by the 2021 World Health Assem-
bly, then the United States Government 
should immediately begin planning a com-
prehensive and data-driven investigation 
into the COVID–19 pandemic origins, in con-
cert with willing partner governments and 
experts around the world. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. There 
are now 2 minutes of debate, equally 
divided, on the amendment. 
Mr. MARSHALL. Madam President, 
over the past year, COVID–19 has 
spread to all corners of the world, kill-
ing more than 3 million people in its 
path, 
including 
more 
than 
550,000 
Americans. We were originally told 
this virus initiated in a wet market or 
that it may have come from a bat that 
directly infected a human. However, 
the preponderance of evidence now sug-
gests this virus may have leaked from 
a lab in Wuhan. 
With the World Health Assembly 
meeting this week, I ask this body to 
fully express support for a complete in-
vestigation into this outbreak. It is 
outrageous and inconceivable that a 
comprehensive investigation has still 
not occurred. 
If China continues on its path of 
coverup, we must begin planning a full 
investigation, including with partners 
around the world. It would be utterly 
irresponsible to suffer through the 
worst pandemic in a century and not 
have the origins fully investigated. 
Our bipartisan amendment will de-
liver the message that the Chinese 
must show us the data and be trans-
parent with the world, and if they 
don’t, we will fight to get to the bot-
tom of this pandemic. 
I thank Senator GILLIBRAND for in-
troducing this amendment with me and 
ask that all Senators join us in approv-
ing it, and we hope, we believe, that 
this can pass with a voice vote. 
Thank you. And I yield. 
Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I 
yield back all time, and I support this 
amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, all time is yielded back. 
VOTE ON AMENDMENT NO. 1973 
Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I 
ask unanimous consent to vitiate the 
60-vote threshold for this amendment. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection? 
Without objection, it is so ordered. 
The question is on agreeing to the 
amendment. 
The amendment (No. 1973), as modi-
fied, was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
AMENDMENT NO. 2023 TO AMENDMENT NO. 1502 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, I 
would like to call up my amendment 
No. 2023 and ask that it be reported by 
number. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
The 
clerk will report the amendment by 
number. 
The bill clerk read as follows: 
The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. SASSE] 
proposes 
amendment 
numbered 
2023 
to 
amendment No. 1502. 
The amendment is as follows: 
(Purpose: To authorize appropriations for 
the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency to conduct research and develop-
ment in key technology focus areas) 
At the appropriate place in division B, in-
sert the following: 
SEC. lll. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIA-
TIONS 
FOR 
THE 
DEFENSE 
AD-
VANCED 
RESEARCH 
PROJECTS 
AGENCY. 
(a) 
IN
GENERAL.—Notwithstanding 
any 
other provision of law, there is authorized to 
be appropriated for the Defense Advanced 
Research Projects Agency to conduct re-
search and development in key technology 
focus areas $3,500,000,000 for each of fiscal 
years 2022 through 2026. 
(b) 
SUPPLEMENT, 
NOT
SUPPLANT.—Any 
amount appropriated pursuant to the au-
thorization in subsection (a) shall supple-
ment and not supplant any amounts already 
appropriated for the Defense Advanced Re-
search Projects Agency.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE
S3496 
May 26, 2021 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Nebraska. 
Mr. SASSE. Madam President, my 
amendment about doubling DARPA 
funding is really simple: It doubles 
DARPA 
funding. 
This 
amendment 
would provide an additional $3.5 billion 
a year to the base, $3.5 billion that 
DARPA currently receives over the 
next 5 years. 
To members of the Armed Services 
Committee, I would tell you, this 
amendment doesn’t do anything to 
mess with your base authorization. 
Your work is not displaced. This is 
simply additive. Modern war isn’t just 
about enemy landings; it is also about 
enemy hackings. And the Chinese Com-
munist Party is currently pouring 
money into machine learning, AI, and 
quantum because they think if they 
achieve 
first-mover 
advantage 
in 
cyber, they will ultimately become the 
world’s 
preeminent 
superpower. 
DARPA’s job is to make sure that 
doesn’t happen. 
We to need to make sure that Chair-
man Xi lies awake at night worrying 
about his critical infrastructure, his 
networks, and his vulnerabilities. And 
DARPA is currently doing that work, 
but DARPA is not funded for us to win 
the technology race. 
Money that goes to NSF, which is the 
core of the bill that is before us—— 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator’s time has expired. 
Mr. SASSE (continuing). Is impor-
tant, but DARPA is different. DARPA 
is the one that leads Chairman Xi to be 
worried at night. 
I request a ‘‘yes’’ vote. 
The 
PRESIDING 
OFFICER. 
Who 
yields time? 
Mr. SASSE. I ask for a recorded vote, 
and I ask for the yeas and nays.

ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN 
HERITAGE MONTH 
Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise today in recognition of Asian Pa-
cific American Heritage Month. This 
annual commemoration offers the op-
portunity to celebrate and reflect on 
the rich history of Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders. 
Representatives 
Frank 
Horton 
of 
New York and Norman Mineta of Cali-
fornia 
and 
later 
Senators 
Daniel 
Inouye and Spark Matsunaga, both of 
Hawaii, first introduced a resolution in 
1977 to establish an annual commemo-
ration of the contributions of this com-
munity. That first resolution pro-
claimed the first 10 days of May as 
Asian Pacific American Heritage Week. 
Congress passed a modified version of 
that resolution in 1978, which President 
Jimmy Carter signed into law. In 1990, 
Congress expanded Asian Pacific Amer-
ican Heritage Week to the entire 
month. Just 2 years later, Congress 
passed a final resolution permanently 
designating the month of May as Asian 
Pacific American Heritage Month. This 
timing is deliberate: It commemorates 
important milestones—the arrival of 
the first Japanese to the United States 
on May 7, 1843, and the completion of 
the Transcontinental Railroad on May 
10, 1869. 
The Asian-American population is 
the fastest growing population in the 
United States, having risen from 10.5 
million in 2000 to more than 23 million 
in 2020. More than 1.6 million individ-
uals identify as Native Hawaiian or 
other Pacific Islander. With these com-
bined figures, the Asian-American and 
Pacific Islander, AAPI, community 
makes up almost 7 percent of the U.S. 
population and roughly the same per-
centage of Maryland’s population. 
Nationwide, demographers estimate 
that this population, which consists of 
over 40 subgroups, will more than dou-
ble from 20 million to more than 51 
million by 2060. 
Over the past year, Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders have played a 
vital role in our Nation’s battle with 
COVID–19. Serving as frontline work-
ers, first responders, and emergency 
personnel, they have provided life-
saving and critical care to hundreds of 
thousands of people during unprece-
dented times. 
The 
approximately 
555,200 
Asian- 
owned businesses in the United States 
represent approximately 1 in 10 busi-
nesses in the United States. As the 
chairman of the Small Business and 
Entrepreneurship Committee, I know 
the importance of each of these enter-
prises to our national economy and to 
the local communities they serve. I 
also know the serious challenges that 
all small business owners but particu-
larly minority-owned businesses have 
faced since the start of the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
Some 
research

that these businesses may have suf-
fered the most significant economic ef-
fects 
of 
all 
demographic 
groups. 
Through the past year, I have sought 
to ensure that the Small Business Ad-
ministration’s grants and loans flow to 
smaller 
and 
minority-owned 
busi-
nesses. 
Asian Americans and Pacific Island-
ers have also served our Nation in im-
portant public service roles. Norm Mi-
neta, after spending 20 years in the 
House of Representatives, served two 
Presidents—Bill Clinton and George W. 
Bush—first as Secretary of Commerce 
and then as the longest serving Sec-
retary of Transportation. I was proud 
to serve with him in the House and 
with Senator Daniel K. Inouye of Ha-
waii from 2006 to 2012 during his tenure 
as President pro tempore of the Senate, 
a role that made him the highest rank-
ing Asian-American government offi-
cial in the history of the United States. 
Of course, KAMALA D. HARRIS eclipsed 
that distinction this year when she be-
came Vice President—the first Asian 
American ever to hold that role. I am 
also proud every day to serve alongside 
Senators MAZIE
HIRONO
and TAMMY 
DUCKWORTH, two strong leaders who 
are committed to promoting the well- 
being and progress of Asian Americans 
and Pacific Islanders along with all 
Americans. 
The Asian-Americans and Pacific Is-
lander population has long endured 
racism and prejudice. This discrimina-
tion reached a peak when President 
Roosevelt ordered the incarceration of 
over 100,000 Japanese Americans in in-
ternment camps as war began with the 
Empire of Japan in World War II. Over 
the last year and a half, we have seen 
an alarming and dangerous rise in prej-
udicial treatment and racially moti-
vated hate crimes and attacks. Accord-
ing to a recent report, there were near-
ly 3,800 reported cases of anti-Asian 
discrimination related to COVID–19 be-
tween March 2020 and February 2021. 
Dangerous rhetoric such as calling 
COVID–19 the Chinese virus jeopardizes 
the safety and well-being of millions of 
Asian Americans. 
It is time we stand up and protect 
our fellow neighbors, friends, cowork-
ers, and loved ones. We need an all 
hands-on-deck 
approach 
to 
combat 
anti-Asian bias, prejudice, discrimina-
tion, hate crimes, and violence. Con-
gress overwhelmingly passed S. 937, the 
COVID–19 Hate Crimes Act, which Sen-
ators HIRONO
and DUCKWORTH
intro-
duced. This legislation serves as a 
pledge to our Asian-American commu-
nity that we, as the United States of 
America, stand in solidarity with you 
and will not tolerate violations of your 
civil rights. I was proud to cosponsor 
Senators HIRONO and DUCKWORTH’s res-
olution 
condemning 
discrimination 
against Asian Americans and Pacific 
Islanders stemming from the COVID–19 
pandemic. Working together with our 
local, 
State, 
national, 
and 
inter-
national partners—along with our al-
lies in the private sector and faith 
community—we can stem this dan-
gerous trend and provide a sense of 
peace and security to our Asian-Amer-
ican brothers and sisters. In doing so, I 
am committed to listening to and 
being guided by the voices of those in-
dividuals and communities who have 
suffered harm. 
Asian 
Pacific 
American 
Heritage 
Month offers all Americans the oppor-
tunity to recognize and to appreciate 
the important role of this community 
in our Nation, both throughout history 
and today. It is more important than 
ever that we all take advantage of it. 
f 
BORDER SECURITY 
Mrs. BLACKBURN. Madam Presi-
dent, in the 4 months since the Demo-
crats took control of the U.S. Govern-
ment, they have not once indicated 
they understand the severity of the cri-
sis playing out along our southern bor-
der. 
It is hard to believe they get the 
same reports from Customs and Border 
Protection as I do, so just in case they 
haven’t seen this month’s update yet, I 
am going to go ahead and run through 
the numbers. 
In April, CBP apprehended more than 
178,000 people trying to illegally cross 
our border. 
Almost 14,000 of them were unaccom-
panied children or single minors. 
Drug seizures were up 6 percent from 
March. We have already seized more 
fentanyl this year than we did all last 
year. 
On top of all that we are still catch-
ing smugglers trying to pass off coun-
terfeit face masks, prohibited COVID 
test kits, and banned pharmaceuticals. 
It is important to understand that all 
of this, from the human trafficking to 
the drug smuggling to the bootleg PPE 
operations, are symptoms of a much 
bigger problem. 
We are dealing with a systemic hu-
manitarian, health and safety, and na-
tional security crisis that gets worse 
every time the Biden administration 
doubles down on open borders rhetoric. 
What is worse, they are treating the 
chaos like a logistics issue. Instead of 
trying to reduce the flow of migrants 
coming to the southern border, the 
Biden administration is trying to speed 
the flow. 
They are actively trying to move as 
many migrants into our country as 
possible. 
Last week, we received reports that 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services is using Chattanooga, TN, as a 
rally point for unaccompanied minors 
on their way to meet up with their 
sponsors or move on to area shelters 
and homes. 
We saw video of the children getting 
off of planes at Wilson Air Center and 
boarding buses to continue on their 
journey. At least four planes full of un-
accompanied minors landed in Chat-
tanooga last week. 
It is important to realize that all this 
was happening in the dead of night, 
without the knowledge of any Ten-
nessee elected officials or community 
leaders. 
No transparency, no coordination, no 
notice whatsoever. 
This is cause for concern not only be-
cause HHS circumvented State au-
thorities but because this Agency has a 
history of operating under a veil of se-
crecy when it concerns their handling 
of migrant children. 
Back in 2014, HHS blocked congres-
sional oversight of their migrant hous-
ing facilities. Our attempts to tour one 
such facility, which at the time housed 
more than 1,000 children, were met 
with delays, denials and refusals. 
Fast-forward to today, and HHS is 
being just as secretive about how they 
are managing care for these children. 
Fortunately, eyewitnesses have come 
forward to confirm the scope and se-
crecy of this operation. 
One source said: ‘‘They have inten-
tionally not shared a lot of information 
with us. They don’t want this to get 
out.’’ 
He went on: ‘‘They had, to my under-
standing, a field full of buses with more 
buses and more buses running all of 
these routes. Now, they’re flying the 
kids because the buses were easier to 
videotape going down the highway. 
They’ve changed their strategy from 
buses to flying . . . In Chattanooga and 
other cities, motorcoach companies are 
waiting on planes to land and con-
tinuing their trek further north, drop-
ping kids off along the way.’’ 
Now, let’s be clear about one thing: 
The children in those buses are vic-
tims—victims of irresponsible rhetoric, 
of bad policy, and of manipulation and 
abuse by traffickers. 
I would implore my colleagues to lis-
ten to these stories and to accept that 
the tragedy is compounded by the 
knowledge that none of these children 
should have been on those buses in the 
first place. 
Moving children through Border Pa-
trol custody, into HHS custody, and 
then 
delivering 
them 
to 
sponsors 
throughout the country is not a solu-
tion to the problem. It only makes the 
problem worse. 
If Democrats want to embrace a ‘‘hu-
mane’’ approach to immigration re-
form, they should stop worrying about 
those talking points and secure the 
border. Treat this like the crisis it is. 
Restore the Migrant Protection Pro-
tocols. I have introduced a bill that 
would make that happen; all we need is 
a few votes and a signature. 
Fully embrace our title 42 authority 
to turn away adults and children who 
attempt to enter the country illegally. 
Close the loophole that has tempted so 
many parents to send their children to 
the border alone. 
Resume construction of the border 
wall, and invest in the infrastructure, 
technology, and manpower it will take 
to truly secure those points of entry. 
But above all else, stop making 
promises you can’t keep. 
This is the most important piece of 
advice I can give to my colleagues on

the other side of the aisle and to the 
administration. 
I know that you believe opening the 
border is compassionate policy, but the 
cartels are exploiting your version of 
compassion and using it to manipulate 
desperate families. 
For some inexplicable reason, the 
Biden administration has made it offi-
cial policy to finish the cartels’ work 
for them and take these children to 
their new life, which could be as part of 
an MS–13 gang, or a labor work crew, 
or a sex trafficking ring. It could be 
with drug runners. 
If you believe all these children are 
headed to their families, you’re living 
in fantasyland. 
Last week, Senator HAGERTY, Con-
gressman FLEISCHMAN, and I sent a let-
ter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra 
and 
OHS 
Secretary 
Alejandro 
Mayorkas asking for an explanation. 
We are still waiting for a satisfactory 
response. 
But I will tell you, you cannot fix 
this crisis with a talking point. You 
cannot fix it by staying silent, as Sec-
retaries Becerra and Mayorkas have 
chosen to be. 
Parents are sending their children 
1,000 miles across the continent in the 
custody of drug mules and sex traf-
fickers because the administration has 
given them hope that if they take this 
one, unthinkable risk, the door will be 
open, and they will be able to follow 
their children into the country. 
We have the power to stop this. 
It is time to abandon talking points, 
address the root cause of the crisis, and 
secure our southern border before it is 
too late. Because if we have learned 
anything about how the cartels oper-
ate, the children who passed through 
Chattanooga last week, the ones who 
made it here, are the lucky ones.

ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS 
CENTENNIAL OF GAGLIANO’S 
ITALIAN MARKET & DELI 
∑ Mr. BENNET. Madam President it is 
my honor to congratulate Gagliano’s 
Italian Market & Deli on 100 years of 
successful entrepreneurship founded in 
culture, community, and family in 
Pueblo, CO. The Gagliano’s story is one 
of multigenerational immigrant suc-
cess and a heartening example of the 
American dream. 
Giuseppe Gagliano, known as Joe, 
left Italy in 1918. The promise of steel 
mill work and American opportunity 
drew him to Pueblo. Maria Carmella 
DeAngelo—his neighbor from the farm-
lands just outside of Palermo in Lucca, 
Sicily—followed him and they were 
married in 1920. Soon, they had their 
first child, Rose. In 1921, however, a 
catastrophic flood destroyed their first 
home. Later, they lost their second 
child, Francis, to illness. Despite these 
tragedies, the Gaglianos persisted in 
finding opportunity. 
Joe began the family’s legacy of en-
trepreneurship 
by 
saving 
enough 
money selling milk from his cow before 
and after his shifts at the mill. Later 
that year, he used $300 in savings to 
buy the empty lot next to their new 
Elm Street home to build an attached 
store. 
Joe and Maria Gagliano’s market 
stocked a wide variety of sought-after 
Italian foods and specialties that be-
came popular with Pueblo’s diverse im-
migrant community. Carmella soon de-
veloped the recipe for her classic 
Italian sausage that quickly became a 
mainstay of the business. While they 
nurtured their entrepreneurial success, 
they showed compassion to customers 
during the Great Depression by never 
pursuing unpaid debts under the inter-
est 
free 
credit 
they 
offered. 
The 
Gaglianos and their extended family 
who helped to run the store also took 
pride in their hard work to become 
U.S. citizens. 
The Gagliano’s story shows the great 
power of family bonds with four gen-
erations having owned and operated 
the store, cultivating both its historic 
identity and its business growth over 
the 
decades. 
Founders 
Joe 
and 
Carmella Gagliano passed away in 1966 
and 1992, respectively. In 1994, Joe and 
Rose (Gagliano) Cortese retired from 
the business. Their successors in own-
ing and operating the store are Tony 
Gagliano, the nephew of original found-
er Joe, along with his wife Josephine 
and children, Bonnie and Vince. 
I am grateful to commemorate this 
special moment that is a living reflec-
tion of the American dream. I wish for 
a pleasant community celebration of 
this milestone in Pueblo on June 26, 
2021, as well. May the Gagaliano family 
and their Italian Market & Deli take 
pride in their century of success and 
find many more years of prosperity and 
health to come.∑

125TH 
ANNIVERSARY 
OF 
THE 
MARYLAND STATE BAR ASSO-
CIATION 
∑ Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I 
rise to ask the Senate to join me in 
recognizing the Maryland State Bar 
Association on the 125th anniversary of 
its founding. Since its founding on Au-
gust 28, 1896, the Maryland State Bar 
Association, MSBA, has advanced and 
protected the interests of Maryland at-
torneys, their clients, and the general 
public. 
Over the past 125 years, the MSBA 
has grown into a premier professional 
trade association comprised of over 
20,000 members from every segment of 
the legal profession. This includes 
large law firms, solo and small-firm 
practitioners, government lawyers, in- 
house counsel, nonprofit attorneys, 
judges, and legal academics. The MSBA 
has steadfastly supported the Maryland 
legal community in its important work 
to serve the public interest, facilitate 
commerce, and create a more fair and 
just society. 
In the decades since its founding, the 
MSBA has advanced and supported the 
demographic 
diversification 
of 
the 
Maryland bar. In partnership with the 
Judiciary of Maryland and numerous 
nonprofit partners, the MSBA and in 
particular its Committee on Diversity 
& Inclusion have fostered policies and 
programs to enhance the diversity of 
the practice of law in the State to the 
benefit of all Marylanders. The com-
mittee is charged with promoting re-
cruitment, hiring, and retention proc-
esses to create environments within 
the legal community in which all indi-
viduals are encouraged to join, thrive, 
and lead the legal profession regardless 
of race, color, gender, gender identity, 
disability, sexual orientation, national 
origin, or any other characteristic of 
identity. 
Over the years, the MSBA has also 
expanded its vision and mission to in-
clude efforts to promote access to civil 
legal services. The association has ad-
vocated for legislation to support the 
Maryland Legal Services Corporation, 
a critically important organization 
that raises and distributes funds to 
nonprofit organizations that provide 
civil legal assistance to low-income in-
dividuals in Maryland. As chair of the 
corporation from 1988 to 1995, I know 
firsthand the extraordinary and needed 
service that it provides. In addition, 
MSBA has in recent years integrated 
the operations of the Maryland Access 
to Justice Commission, an independent 
entity that convenes partners from the 
State attorney general to the private 
sector, to academia, to advance equal 
access to the civil justice system. 
In 
the 
community 
at-large, 
the 
MSBA has played a significant role in 
enhancing civic literacy in Maryland, 
including by hosting thousands of high 
school students participating in mock 
trial and moot court competitions. 
These programs offer students the op-
portunity to enhance their skills and 
expose them to the practical implica-
tions and importance of the law. As a 
Maryland lawyer myself, I ask the Sen-
ate to join me in congratulating the 
Maryland State Bar Association for its 
exemplary service to the Maryland 
legal community over the past 125 
years.∑

CINE 
∑ Ms. CORTEZ MASTO. Madam Presi-
dent, I rise to recognize the graduating 
class from the Kirk Kerkorian School 
of Medicine at the University of Ne-
vada, Las Vegas. This is an incredible 
milestone in the school and univer-
sity’s history, as well as for Southern 
Nevada. Fifty students who began their 
studies 4 years ago as the charter class 
of medical students had their degree of 
medical doctor MD, conferred earlier 
this month on May 7, 2021. 
For Southern Nevada, this is a pin-
nacle achievement because until now, 
Las Vegas was the largest metropoli-
tan area in the Nation without an MD-

granting medical school. Nevada has 
grown exponentially over the past few 
decades, and the number of physicians 
has not kept pace in our communities. 
Nevada ranks 45th in the Nation for the 
number of active physicians per 100,000 
residents and comes in 48th for primary 
care physicians and 50th for general 
surgeons. Making this graduating class 
all the more exceptional, 18 of the 50 
newly minted physicians plan on stay-
ing in the Silver State for their resi-
dency. 
Many of these graduates no doubt 
had some assumptions of what the be-
ginning of their lifelong medical jour-
ney might look like when they began, 
and few could have anticipated what 
these past 4 years have brought. From 
the COVID–19 pandemic and before 
that, the Route 91 Harvest festival 
mass shooting in 2017, these graduates 
have mourned with their community, 
risen to the challenges, and proven just 
what it means to be battle-born. This 
is an incredible moment for Nevada, 
the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, 
our communities, and these dedicated 
graduates and their families. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in 
celebrating this achievement.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING KATHIE BAILEY 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the distinct honor of rec-
ognizing Kathie Bailey. Kathie passed 
away on May 14, 2021, in Lewistown, 
MT. Kathie was an amazing woman. 
She and her husband, Rod, were mar-
ried for 43 years and had two sons, C.J. 
and Justin. She was active in sup-
porting them in rodeo, 4–H, and FFA 
events. Kathie was a caring wife, moth-
er, and grandmother. 
Kathie also was active in public serv-
ice. She served on many State boards, 
as well as the administrator of the City 
of Colstrip for 7 years and a Fergus 
County commissioner for 5 years. She 
served as a 4–H Extension staff member 
for several years and was on the na-
tional board for 6 years. 
Kathie was the driving force for the 
creation and development of the Snowy 
Mountain Development Center, SMDC. 
This organization has been the impetus 
for business development, homeowner-
ship, and health services in the area. 
Her staff lovingly called her ‘‘Barra-
cuda Bailey’’ and the ‘‘Tasmanian 
Devil’’ when describing her intensity 
and dedication to projects that were 
important to her and her community. 
Kathie left an endowment to ensure 
the 
long-term 
viability 
of 
SMDC, 
which she founded in 2001 and initially 
operated from the trunk of her car. As 
a result of her efforts, she built SMDC 
into a multimillion-dollar organiza-
tion, recently recognized as an EnVi-
sion Center, a State-sanctioned Cer-
tified Regional Development Corpora-
tion, and helped establish a federally 
designated Economic Development Dis-
trict. She had a highly proficient team 
of professional women that she hand- 
picked, trained, coached, mentored, 
and trusted to carry forth her legacy. 
Central Montana’s community and eco-
nomic landscape reflects the thousands 
of hours and dollars she invested pas-
sionately, selflessly, and honorably in 
her community and with the people she 
loved so deeply. 
But most importantly, Kathie’s life 
was shaped by God. She knew that God 
was guiding her to something new and 
even more rewarding and was eagerly 
awaiting God’s calling. She was secure 
in knowing where she would spend 
eternity. 
We lost an accomplished person when 
Kathie passed. Her life was indicative 
of the true Montana spirit of selfless 
giving and dedication to making the 
world a better place. She will be 
missed.∑ 
f 
REMEMBERING ‘‘PIANO PAT’’ 
SPONHEIM 
∑ Mr. 
DAINES. 
Madam 
President, 
today I have the honor of recognizing 
‘‘Piano Pat’’ Sponheim, an iconic en-
tertainer and a Montana treasure. Pat 
passed away peacefully at the age of 85 
on May 4, 2021. 
Piano Pat was a Great Falls staple. 
She had been singing, playing the 
piano, and lighting up the room at the 
world-renowned Sip ’N Dip Lounge 
since 1963. Montanans and tourists 
from every corner of the world would 
swarm the Great Falls Tiki Bar to hear 
Pat belt out her rendition of some of 
the greatest classics. Her vast rep-
ertoire of songs would always amaze 
people as they made requests that soon 
became her next tune. Her perform-
ances brought joy to everyone who lis-
tened. For over five decades, Piano Pat 
entertained folks of all ages and back-
grounds. 
Pat was not only a Montana celeb-
rity; she was also a strong follower of 
Christ. Her faith was a guiding force in 
her life, and she was known for her love 
and compassion for others. As a single 
mom, Pat worked hard to raise her 
three children. She continued her dedi-
cation to her family by caring for her 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
Her passion for music and her love of 
life was infectious. Pat was a Montana 
legend who will be dearly missed by her 
family, friends, and fans from Montana 
and around the world. She has joined 
her heavenly choir now.∑

TRIBUTE TO DEPUTY DAVID ‘‘OZ’’ 
OSBORNE 
∑ Mr. PAUL. Madam President, when a 
popular sheriff’s deputy from Daviess 
County, KY began what seemed to be a 
routine call in 1989, he had no reason to 
anticipate that his life would soon be 
hanging by a thread. He served a re-
straining order without incident and 
returned to his vehicle. But then, in 
the blink of an eye, he was shot mul-
tiple times, beaten severely, and was 
nearly run over by the assailant as he 
fled the scene. 
Deputy David ‘‘Oz’’ Osborne was left 
to die on a driveway along a country 
road, but Clarence and Mary Hulsey 
had made an unplanned—and for them, 
unusual—decision to go to town to get 
ice cream on that May evening. First 
spotting Osborne’s hat, they quickly 
found him, summoned help, and re-
mained with him until first responders 
could take over. 
This assault nearly ended Osborne’s 
life 30 years ago, but although he was 
badly wounded and temporarily para-
lyzed, he recovered completely, re-
turned to duty, raised his family, and 
was later elected Daviess County clerk. 
More impressive than this narrative 
is the fact that the convicted assailant 
later contacted Osborne from prison, 
seeking his forgiveness, and Osborne 
agreed. Citing his Christian faith as his 
motivation, he said that forgiveness 
‘‘did not happen overnight, but it did 
happen.’’ 
It is clear why the citizens of Daviess 
County have so much respect for Oz 
Osborne to this very day. His story re-
minds us of the risks that our law en-
forcement officers and first responders 
face in the line of duty, but it teaches 
all of us an indelible and rare lesson 
about forgiveness and mercy.∑

By Mr. KAINE (for himself and 
Mr. YOUNG): 
S. 1847. A bill to amend the Higher 
Education Act of 1965 to establish a 
community college and career training 
grant program; to the Committee on 
Health, Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions. 
Mr. KAINE. Mr. President, amid high 
unemployment rates across the Coun-
try exacerbated by the COVID–19 pan-
demic, businesses continue to face 
challenges in hiring the skilled work-
ers they need to grow and thrive. Si-
multaneously, individuals looking for 
work may not have the skills and sup-
port that they need to enter or renter— 
and remain—in the workforce. Unfortu-
nately the pandemic has slowed the 
number of students attending some 
form of postsecondary education, but 
even prior to the pandemic the supply 
of middle-skilled workers, whose work 
requires more than a high school di-
ploma but not a four-year degree, fell 
short of industry demand. It’s impor-
tant that States make strategic invest-
ments now to set students up for suc-
cess in the constantly-evolving labor 
market, and the best training for high- 
wage, high-skill, or in-demand jobs is 
often offered by community colleges. 
For many people seeking a job, at-
tending a community college is the 
most affordable and accessible pathway 
to higher paying employment opportu-
nities. In Virginia, we have 23 commu-
nity colleges that serve an estimated 
400,000 people across the state, pro-
viding them opportunities to earn an 
associate’s degree, certifications or 
licensures in some of the most cutting- 
edge and in-demand fields in our work-
force. The impact of community col-
leges nationwide is even greater, and 
our rapidly changing economy demands 
increased investment in the pathways 
these institutions provide to keep up 
with changing skill demands. The rap-
idly changing U.S. economy demands 
agile education and workforce develop-
ment systems that can keep up with 
changing skill demands. 
Today, I am proud to reintroduce the 
Assisting Community Colleges in Edu-
cating Skilled Students (ACCESS) to 
Careers Act with Senator YOUNG. This 
bill builds on lessons learned from the 
Trade Adjustment Assistance Commu-
nity College and Career Training grant 
program 
(TAACCCT), 
and 
provides 
grants to community colleges to part-
ner with private and public sector enti-
ties to create innovative career path-
ways directly between two-year insti-
tutions and employers. The ACCESS to 
Careers Act also provides grants to 
states and community colleges to scale 
evidence-based strategies that will help 
prepare our students with the skills 
necessary to succeed in our in-demand 
industry 
sectors 
and 
occupations. 
These grants can be used to expand 
dual enrollment, work-based learning 
opportunities, 
apprenticeships, 
and 
other pathways to best meet the skill 
needs of students and employers in our 
evolving workforce. The bill also em-
phasizes the importance of student 
services to ensure that students have 
the support they need to complete 
their programs. 
As our Country begins to recover 
from the widespread job losses we’ve 
seen over the last year, the success of 
our economy will depend on our ability 
to provide people with the resources 
they need to quickly enter or reenter 
the workforce. This legislation makes 
strategic investments in students to 
ensure they have access to programs 
that properly prepare them for good- 
paying, in-demand jobs as we continue 
to build back better. The ACCESS to 
Careers Act represents a necessary step 
to take the evidence-based innovations 
we’ve seen on the local level to scale in 
order to fill jobs in high-needs indus-
tries. I strongly encourage my col-
leagues in the Senate to consider this 
commonsense, bipartisan legislation. 
By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. 
SCOTT of South Carolina, Mr. 
MENENDEZ, Mr. PORTMAN, Ms. 
DUCKWORTH, Mr. YOUNG, Ms. 
SMITH, and Mr. KAINE): 
S. 1860. A bill to amend the Lead-

SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS. 
There is authorized to be appropriated to 
carry out the amendments made by section 2 
such sums as may be necessary for each of 
fiscal years 2022 through 2026. 
By Mr. HAWLEY (for himself and 
Mr. BRAUN): 
S. 1867. A bill to require the Director 
of National Intelligence to declassify 
information relating to the origin of 
COVID–19, and for other purposes; con-
sidered and passed. 
S. 1867 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘COVID–19 
Origin Act of 2021’’. 
SEC. 2. FINDINGS. 
Congress makes the following findings: 
(1) The Department of State released a fact 
sheet on January 15, 2021, about the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology (WIV) which stated the 
following: 
(A) ‘‘The U.S. government has reason to 
believe that several researchers inside the 
WIV became sick in autumn 2019, before the 
first identified case of the outbreak, with 
symptoms consistent with both COVID–19 
and common seasonal illnesses.’’. 
(B) ‘‘WIV researchers conducted experi-
ments involving RaTG13, the bat coronavirus 
identified by the WIV in January 2020 as its 
closest sample to SARS-CoV-2.’’. 
(C) ‘‘Despite the WIV presenting itself as a 
civilian institution, the United States has 
determined that the WIV has collaborated on 
publications and secret projects with China’s 
military.’’. 
(2) Former Director of the Centers for Dis-
ease 
Control 
and 
Prevention, 
Robert 
Redfield, stated in March 2021 that, ‘‘the 
most likely etiology of this pathogen in 
Wuhan was from a laboratory’’ and noted 
that, ‘‘[i]t is not unusual for respiratory 
pathogens that are being worked on in a lab-
oratory to infect the laboratory worker.’’. 
(3) Director-General of the World Health 
Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus 
acknowledged 
in 
March 
2021 
that 
the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19) may 
have originated in a laboratory and said this 
hypothesis ‘‘requires further investigation, 
potentially with additional missions involv-
ing specialist experts.’’. 
SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS. 
It is the sense of Congress that— 
(1) identifying the origin of Coronavirus 
Disease 2019 (COVID–19) is critical for pre-
venting a similar pandemic from occurring 
in the future; 
(2) there is reason to believe the COVID–19 
pandemic may have originated at the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology; and 
(3) the Director of National Intelligence 
should declassify and make available to the 
public as much information as possible about 
the origin of COVID–19 so the United States 
and like-minded countries can— 
(A) identify the origin of COVID–19 as ex-
peditiously as possible, and 
(B) use that information to take all appro-
priate measures to prevent a similar pan-
demic from occurring again. 
SEC. 4. DECLASSIFICATION OF INFORMATION RE-
LATED TO THE ORIGIN OF COVID–19. 
Not later than 90 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of Na-
tional Intelligence shall— 
(1) declassify any and all information re-
lating to potential links between the Wuhan 
Institute of Virology and the origin of the 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID–19), includ-
ing— 
(A) activities performed by the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology with or on behalf of the 
People’s Liberation Army; 
(B) coronavirus research or other related 
activities performed at the Wuhan Institute 
of Virology prior to the outbreak of COVID– 
19; and 
(C) researchers at the Wuhan Institute of 
Virology who fell ill in autumn 2019, includ-
ing for any such researcher— 
(i) the researcher’s name; 
(ii) the researcher’s symptoms; 
(iii) the date of the onset of the research-
er’s symptoms; 
(iv) the researcher’s role at the Wuhan In-
stitute of Virology; 
(v) whether the researcher was involved 
with or exposed to coronavirus research at 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology; 
(vi) whether the researcher visited a hos-
pital while they were ill; and 
(vii) a description of any other actions 
taken by the researcher that may suggest 
they were experiencing a serious illness at 
the time; and 
(2) submit to Congress an unclassified re-
port that contains— 
(A) all of the information described under 
paragraph (1); and 
(B) only such redactions as the Director 
determines necessary to protect sources and 
methods. 
SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS 
SENATE RESOLUTION 238—RECOG-
NIZING AND HONORING THE SAC-
RIFICES 
AND 
ACCOMPLISH-
MENTS OF THE GREATEST GEN-
ERATION 
Mr. TUBERVILLE (for himself, Ms. 
ERNST, Mr. CRAMER, Mr. WARNOCK, Ms. 
LUMMIS, Mr. SCOTT
of Florida, Mr. 
BRAUN, Mr. HAGERTY, and Mr. HOEVEN) 
submitted the following resolution; 
which was referred to the Committee 
on the Judiciary: 
S. RES. 238 
Whereas over 16,000,000 individuals in the 
United States served in the Armed Forces 
during World War II; 
Whereas, of the over 16,000,000 men and 
women who served the United States during 
World War II, over 400,000 lost their lives 
fighting for the freedoms and liberties indi-
viduals in the United States hold dear; 
Whereas factory workers across the United 
States produced the weapons, vehicles, and 
other materiels essential to the victorious 
triumph of the United States and the Allied 
Powers in the Atlantic and Pacific theaters; 
Whereas, during World War II, individuals 
in the United States— 
(1) bought war bonds to support the im-
mense cost of the war; 
(2) planted victory gardens; and 
(3) donated tires, pots and pans, and any 
other spare parts to be used by the Armed 
Forces; 
Whereas, during World War II, the United 
States unified in ways never seen before, en-
suring victory for the United States and the 
Allied Powers; 
Whereas, having borne the high cost of 
freedom, the Greatest Generation devoted 
themselves in record numbers following 
World War II— 
(1) to continued service in the Armed 
Forces; 
(2) to the industry of the United States; 
and 
(3) to public service as elected officials 
across the United States; 
Whereas, in their post-World War II roles, 
the Greatest Generation became known for 
their unswerving patriotism, holding to val-
ues such as placing— 
(1) duty above personal gain; 
(2) cooperation before conflict; and 
(3) the needs of country first; and 
Whereas those values, forged by the war of 
their youth but never forgotten, drove the 
Greatest Generation to guide the United 
States to heights of prosperity, generosity, 
peace, and influence never before achieved 
by any nation to grace the face of the Earth: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes and honors the sacrifices and 
accomplishments of the Greatest Genera-
tion, who contributed to the success of the 
United States and the Allied Powers during 
World War II; and 
(2) encourages all individuals in the United 
States— 
(A) to celebrate the Greatest Generation; 
and 
(B) to remember the way the Greatest Gen-
eration united under extreme enemy threat 
and at great risk to themselves to protect 
the freedom and liberty afforded to all indi-
viduals in the United States.

SENATE RESOLUTION 239—RECOG-
NIZING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY 
OF THE BIRTH OF DR. ANDREI 
DMITRIEVICH SAKHAROV 
Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself and Mr. 
RISCH) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.: 
S. RES. 239 
Whereas 2021 marks the 100th anniversary 
of the birth of Dr. Andrei Dmitrievich 
Sakharov (referred to in this preamble as 
‘‘Dr. Sakharov’’), who was born on May 21, 
1921; 
Whereas, 
although 
the 
work 
of 
Dr. 
Sakharov as a nuclear physicist earned him 
international respect and renown, his great 
genius and gift to history was to give voice 
to a global yearning for human rights and 
fundamental freedoms; 
Whereas, in 1968, in an act of great courage 
and conscience, Dr. Sakharov published his 
treatise, ‘‘Thoughts On Progress, Peaceful 
Coexistence, And Intellectual Freedom’’, in 
which he— 
(1) offered a comprehensive vision for peace 
and progress; 
(2) broke with the Soviet establishment 
over human rights; and 
(3) opened himself up to years of official 
and state-sponsored retaliation; 
Whereas, in 1970, Dr. Sakharov helped 
found the Committee on Human Rights in 
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (re-
ferred to in this preamble as the ‘‘USSR’’), 
which documented human rights abuses in 
the USSR; 
Whereas the advocacy of Dr. Sakharov for 
human rights at home and abroad was 
grounded in, and emerged from, his work for 
peace and against nuclear weapons prolifera-
tion; 
Whereas, in his 1975 Nobel Prize acceptance 
speech, delivered by his wife Yelena Bonner 
because the USSR had barred him from at-
tending the ceremony, Dr. Sakharov ex-
pressed his ‘‘hope in a final victory of the 
principles of peace and human rights’’ and 
the ‘‘liberation of all prisoners of conscience 
everywhere’’; 
Whereas the Nobel Peace Prize Committee 
called Dr. Sakharov ‘‘the spokesman for the 
conscience of mankind’’; 
Whereas the Government of the USSR ex-
iled Dr. Sakharov and Yelena Bonner to the 
‘‘closed 
city’’ 
of 
Gorky 
(now 
Nizhny 
Novgorod, Russia) in retaliation for the ad-
vocacy of Dr. Sakharov against the USSR in-
vasion of Afghanistan, which he later called 
‘‘a war of annihilation, a terrible sin’’; 
Whereas President Reagan proclaimed May 
21, 1983, as National Andrei Sakharov Day, 
an occasion for the people of the United 
States to ‘‘reaffirm that, despite attempts at 
repression, the ideals of peace and freedom 
will endure and ultimately triumph’’; 
Whereas Mikhail Gorbachev released Dr. 
Sakharov and Yelena Bonner from exile in 
December 1986, one of the most significant 
steps in implementing a loosening of polit-
ical controls under perestroika and glasnost; 
Whereas, in 1989, Dr. Sakharov became a 
deputy of the Congress of People Deputies, 
the first legislative body in the USSR that 
permitted debate, which used the moral au-
thority of Dr. Sakharov to try to democ-
ratize Soviet political processes, including 
an end to 1-party rule; 
Whereas the courageous efforts of Dr. 
Sakharov against totalitarian repression in 
the USSR inspired political reforms that 
swept Europe throughout 1989; 
Whereas, on his death in 1989, the White 
House noted that the voice of Dr. Sakharov 
‘‘was an important dimension in the contem-
porary changes under way in Soviet soci-
ety’’, changes that would culminate 2 years 
later in the collapse of the USSR and Soviet 
Communism; and 
Whereas the work Dr. Sakharov began re-
mains unfinished, which is evidenced by the 
May 18, 2021, cancellation by authorities of 
the Moscow Sakharov Center’s exhibit mark-
ing the centenary of the life of Dr. Sakharov: 
Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) recognizes the historical significance of 
the 
contributions 
made 
by 
Dr. 
Andrei 
Dmitrievich Sakharov (referred to in this 
resolution as ‘‘Dr. Sakharov’’) in the pro-
motion of human dignity and political free-
dom in his own country and around the 
world; 
(2) recognizes that the example set by Dr. 
Sakharov has inspired millions around the 
world working to promote democratic prin-
ciples; and 
(3) expresses support for democracy and 
human rights activists around the world, es-
pecially in Russia, who embody the prin-
ciples and values practiced by Dr. Sakharov.

SENATE RESOLUTION 240—AFFIRM-
ING THE ROLE OF THE UNITED 
STATES IN IMPROVING ACCESS 
TO QUALITY, INCLUSIVE PUBLIC 
EDUCATION 
AND 
IMPROVED 
LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR CHIL-
DREN AND ADOLESCENTS, PAR-
TICULARLY FOR GIRLS, IN THE 
POOREST COUNTRIES THROUGH 
THE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP FOR 
EDUCATION 
Mr. BOOKER (for himself and Mr. 
RUBIO) submitted the following resolu-
tion; which was referred to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations: 
S. RES. 240 
Whereas access to quality education re-
duces poverty, advances economic pros-
perity, improves peace and security, and 
strengthens public health; 
Whereas the United Nations reported that 
1,600,000,000 learners in more than 190 coun-
tries were affected by the closure of edu-
cational institutions at the peak of the 
COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas prior to the COVID crisis, the 2020 
Global Education Monitoring Report, an an-
nual accountability tool on the status of 
education internationally, found that an es-
timated 258,000,000 children and adolescents 
are out of school worldwide, with girls and 
children with disabilities more likely to be 
out of school in most of the developing 
world; 
Whereas a 2019 UNICEF Report found that 
only one in every five children in low-income 
countries has access to preprimary edu-
cation; 
Whereas a 2019 World Bank Report found 
that more than half of all children in low- 
and middle-income countries cannot read a 
simple story by age 10; 
Whereas a 2020 UNESCO Global Education 
Monitoring Report found that children and 
adolescents with a sensory, physical, or in-
tellectual disability are two and a half times 
more likely to have never been in school 
than their peers without disabilities; 
Whereas a 2018 UNICEF Report found that 
one in three children and adolescents are out 
of school in countries affected by conflict or 
disaster; 
Whereas a 2020 UNHCR Report found that 
almost half of school-age refugee children 
are out of school and, of the refugee children 
who do start primary school, less than half 
make it to secondary school; 
Whereas a 2018 World Bank Report found 
that 12 years of quality education for every 
girl would boost economies by as much as $30 
trillion in increased lifetime earnings and 
that each year of secondary education for 
girls reduces the likelihood of marriage be-
fore the age of 18 by five percentage points or 
more; 
Whereas the Global Partnership for Edu-
cation (GPE) was founded in 2002 as the only 
public-private global partnership exclusively 
dedicated to education in the world’s poorest 
countries; 
Whereas GPE-eligible countries are home 
to more than 1,000,000,000 children and ado-
lescents, which represent 82 percent of out- 
of-school children; 
Whereas GPE focuses on improving edu-
cation at a systems level, aligning partners 
behind each government’s education sector 
plan, 
to 
leverage 
the 
profound 
trans-
formations required to deliver at least one 
year of preschool and 12 years of quality edu-
cation for every child; 
Whereas GPE works in the countries with 
the greatest need, targets the hardest to 
reach children, and can respond quickly to 
emergencies; 
Whereas educational continuity helps part-
ners keep their education systems func-
tioning through wars, displacement crises, 
climate disasters and health emergencies, in-
cluding the ongoing COVID–19 pandemic; 
Whereas GPE is a proven and effective aid 
delivery mechanism that complements the 
United States Government’s bilateral basic 
education programs by fostering coordina-
tion among all key partners, supporting the 
development and implementation of strong 
national education sector plans, and building 
on the commitment of developing country 
governments to expand quality educational 
opportunities for children in an equitable 
manner; 
Whereas the United States is among the 
leading supporters of GPE, is represented on 
the GPE Board of Directors, and currently 
serves the critical role of Coordinating 
Agent in eight GPE partner countries; 
Whereas United States Government Strat-
egy on Basic Education, Fiscal Years 2019 
through 2023, resolves to leverage GPE to ad-
vance its goal of achieving a world where 
education systems in partner countries en-
able all individuals to acquire the education 
and skills needed to be productive members 
of society; 
Whereas GPE is working with Education 
Cannot Wait, at global and country level, to 
develop optimized approaches to advance UN 
Sustainable Development Goal 4 and provide 
inclusive and equitable quality education for 
all, especially the most marginalized chil-
dren in crisis situations; 
Whereas primary enrollment for girls has 
increased by 65 percent and almost three- 
quarters of partner countries have achieved 
gender parity in school completion; 
Whereas in 40 percent of partner countries, 
GPE’s partnership supports one or more ac-
tivities relating to children with disabilities; 
Whereas GPE is the largest provider of 
education grants in the global COVID–19 re-
sponse, mobilizing over $500,000,000 to ensure 
continued learning, school reopenings, and 
recovery; 
Whereas GPE support incentivized govern-
ments 
to 
save 
more 
than 
$6,000,000,000 
through more efficient education spending, 
freeing up more funds to invest in education 
for the most marginalized; 
Whereas more than 60 percent of GPE’s 
spending is in countries affected by conflict 
or fragility, and GPE helped these countries 
to increase their primary school completion 
rates from 58 percent in 2002 to 68 percent in 
2018; 
Whereas GPE’s 5-year strategic plan calls 
for leveraging and further developing inno-

learning, and extends a strong commitment 
to gender equality and inclusion across all 
workings of the partnership, including a new 
funding window that will raise an additional 
$250,000,000 for girls’ education; and 
Whereas with support from donors, GPE 
will enable 175,000,000 primary-age children 
to learn, reach 140,000,000 students with pro-
fessionally trained teachers, get 88,000,000 
more children in school, more than half of 
them girls, and save $16,000,000,000 through 
more efficient spending: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved, That the Senate— 
(1) affirms the leadership and commitment 
of the United States Government to improv-
ing access to quality, inclusive public edu-
cation and improved learning outcomes for 
the poorest and most marginalized children 
and adolescents worldwide, which promotes 
global stability, economic prosperity, and 
poverty elimination; 
(2) supports the vision, mission, and goals 
of GPE 2025 to appropriately mobilize part-
nerships and investments that transform 
education systems in developing countries, 
leaving no one behind; 
(3) recognizes that United States Govern-
ment investments in bilateral basic edu-
cation are complemented by GPE’s edu-
cation systems-level approach and partner-
ship building; 
(4) calls on the United States to engage in 
multiyear pledges to allow GPE to maximize 
its impact in supporting governments to pro-
vide quality, inclusive public education to 
children around the world and to leverage 
contributions from other countries and do-
nors; and 
(5) calls on the Secretary of State and the 
Administrator of the United States Agency 
for International Development to commit to 
promoting children and adolescents attend-
ing school and learning throughout the 
world in accordance with the 2021 to 2025 
GPE strategic period.

Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. 
RUBIO, Mr. CARDIN, Mr. COONS, Mr. 
KAINE, Mr. MARKEY, Mr. MERKLEY, Mr. 
SCHATZ, Ms. CANTWELL, Mr. VAN HOL-
LEN, Mr. CASEY, Mr. CRAMER, and Mr. 
BOOZMAN) submitted the following res-
olution; which was referred to the 
Committee on Foreign Relations.: 
S. RES. 241 
Whereas, Thomas Jefferson, who cham-
pioned the necessity of a free press for a 
thriving democratic society, wisely declared, 
‘‘Our liberty depends on the freedom of the 
press, and that cannot be limited without 
being lost.’’; 
Whereas Article 19 of the United Nations 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 
adopted in Paris on December 10, 1948, states, 
‘‘Everyone has the right to freedom of opin-
ion and expression; this right includes free-
dom to hold opinions without interference 
and to seek, receive and impart information 
and ideas through any media and regardless 
of frontiers.’’; 
Whereas, in 1993, the United Nations Gen-
eral Assembly proclaimed the third day of 
May of each year to be ‘‘World Press Free-
dom Day’’— 
(1) to celebrate the fundamental principles 
of freedom of the press; 
(2) to evaluate freedom of the press around 
the world; 
(3) to defend the media against attacks on 
its independence; and 
(4) to pay tribute to journalists who have 
lost their lives while working in their profes-
sion; 
Whereas the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the 
Press Act of 2009 (Public Law 111–166) ex-
panded the examination of the freedom of 
the press around the world in the annual 
Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 
published by the Department of State; 
Whereas, on December 18, 2013, and Decem-
ber 18, 2019, the United Nations General As-
sembly adopted Resolution 68/163 and Resolu-
tion 74/157, respectively, on the safety of 
journalists and the problem of impunity, un-
equivocally condemning all attacks on, and 
violence 
against, 
journalists 
and 
media 
workers, 
including 
torture, 
extrajudicial 
killing, enforced disappearance, arbitrary de-
tention, and intimidation and harassment in 
conflict and nonconflict situations; 
Whereas the First Amendment to the 
United States Constitution and various 
State constitutions protect freedom of the 
press in the United States; 
Whereas the United States Government 
has used the Global Magnitsky Human 
Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of 
title XII of Public Law 114–328) to place tar-
geted visa and economic restrictions on indi-
viduals, including for their roles in the tar-
geted killings of journalists; 
Whereas, in an effort to combat attacks 
against 
journalists, 
Secretary 
of 
State 
Antony J. Blinken recently announced a new 
policy allowing the Department of State to 
impose visa restrictions on individuals who, 
acting on behalf of a foreign government, are 
believed to have been directly engaged in se-
rious, extraterritorial counter-dissident ac-
tivities, including those that suppress, har-
ass, surveil, threaten, or harm journalists, 
activists, or other persons perceived to be 
dissidents for their work; 
Whereas the 2021 World Press Freedom 
Index, compiled by Reporters Without Bor-
ders, warns that the COVID–19 pandemic ‘‘il-
lustrates the negative factors threatening 
the right to reliable information’’ and ampli-
fies the many crises that threaten media 
freedom and pluralism; 
Whereas the Freedom in the World 2021 re-
port, published by Freedom House, noted 
that 2020 was an especially hazardous year 
for democracy, during which ‘‘less than 20 
percent of the world’s population [then lived] 
in a Free country, the smallest proportion 
since 1995’’; 
Whereas, according to the Committee to 
Protect Journalists— 
(1) at least 30 journalists were killed in 
2020, 21 of whom were singled out in retalia-
tion for their work, an increase from 10 mur-
ders in 2019; 
(2) Mexico, Afghanistan, and the Phil-
ippines had the most retaliatory killings in 
2020; 
(3) at least 274 journalists were behind bars 
in relation to their work on December 1, 
2020, marking the fifth consecutive year that 
at least 250 journalists were imprisoned glob-
ally; 
(4) China, Turkey, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia 
were responsible for nearly half of all jailed 
journalists worldwide; 
(5) journalists around the world have been 
targeted by sophisticated spyware products 
that pose a severe risk to their safety and 
the safety of their sources; and 
(6) the world’s most censored countries in-
clude Eritrea, North Korea, Turkmenistan, 
Saudi Arabia, China, Vietnam, Iran, Equa-
torial Guinea, Belarus, and Cuba; 
Whereas the Government of China has un-
leashed an onslaught of attacks on press 
freedom in China and Hong Kong, including 
through— 
(1) 
state-sponsored 
censorship 
and 
disinformation campaigns limiting access to 
information about the novel coronavirus, in-
cluding through its censorship of virus-re-
lated keywords on social media platforms; 
(2) attacks on press freedom in Hong Kong, 
including the passage of the National Secu-
rity Law, which poses an existential threat 
to the city’s tradition of press freedom, and 
the arrest and subsequent conviction of 
Jimmy Lai, owner of Hong Kong’s largest 
media outlet, Apple Daily, and an outspoken 
democracy advocate; 
(3) arrests or other repressive actions 
against independent journalists and others 
in mainland China attempting to share un-
censored news or opinion about the COVID– 
19 outbreak, including the detention of cit-
izen journalist Chen Qiushi, who remains in-
communicado; and 
(4) the detention of journalists critical of 
the Government of China, including Chen 
Jieren, who was sentenced to 15 years in 2020, 
following 2 years of incommunicado deten-
tion, after blogging about allegations of cor-
rupt local officials;

most dangerous countries for journalists, 
with—

journalists for murder in retaliation for 
their work in 2020; and 
(2) at least 4 media workers killed in early 
2021; 
Whereas Belarus has witnessed sweeping 
attacks against the press since Alexander 
Lukashenka’s fraudulent election in August 
2020, where since the beginning of 2020, near-
ly 550 journalists and media workers have 
been harassed, assaulted, imprisoned, or oth-
erwise retaliated against for their work, in-
cluding— 
(1) Katsiaryna Barysevich, a physician, and 
Artsyom Sarokin, a journalist, who were re-
spectively charged with 6 months and 2 years 
in a penal colony (on charges of disclosing

tively) for disclosing information about a 
protestor who was killed during a crackdown 
on 
demonstrations 
against 
President 
Lukashenka;

Lukashenka; 
Whereas Reporters Without Borders as-
serts that ‘‘press freedom in [Burma] has 
been set back ten years in ten days’’ after

which— 
(1) at least 40 journalists were arrested, in-
cluding BBC journalist Aung Thura and As-
sociated Press journalist Thein Zaw;

(1) IN GENERAL.—Not later than 240 days 
after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Secretary, in consultation with the Adminis-
trator of the Environmental Protection 
Agency, shall— 
(A) conduct an assessment, including by 
incorporating 
information 
from 
existing 
publications and reports of the Department 
of Agriculture and other entities with rel-
evant expertise, regarding— 
(i) the number and categories of non-Fed-
eral actors in the nonprofit and for-profit 
sectors involved in buying, selling, and trad-
ing agriculture or forestry credits in vol-
untary environmental credit markets; 
(ii) the estimated overall domestic market 
demand for agriculture or forestry credits at 
the end of the preceding 4-calendar year pe-
riod, and historically, in voluntary environ-
mental credit markets; 
(iii) the total number of agriculture or for-
estry credits (measured in metric tons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent) that were esti-
mated to be in development, generated, or 
sold in market transactions during the pre-
ceding 4-calendar year period, and histori-
cally, in voluntary environmental credit 
markets; 
(iv) the estimated supply and demand of 
metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent of 
offsets in the global marketplace for the 
next 4 years; 
(v) the barriers to entry due to compliance 
and verification costs described in sub-
section (g)(4)(C)(iv); 
(vi) the state of monitoring and measure-
ment technologies needed to quantify long- 
term carbon sequestration in soils and from 
other activities to prevent, reduce, or miti-
gate greenhouse gas emissions in the agri-
culture and forestry sectors; 
(vii) means to reduce barriers to entry into 
voluntary environmental credit markets for 
small, beginning, and socially disadvantaged 
farmers, ranchers, and private forest land-
owners and the extent to which existing pro-
tocols in voluntary environmental credit 
markets allow for aggregation of projects 
among farmers, ranchers, and private forest 
landowners; 
(viii) means to leverage existing Depart-
ment of Agriculture programs and other Fed-
eral programs that could improve, lower the 
costs of, and enhance the deployment of 
monitoring and measurement technologies 
described in clause (vi); 
(ix) the potential impact of Department of 
Agriculture activities on supply and demand 
of agriculture or forestry credits; 
(x) the potential role of the Department of 
Agriculture in encouraging innovation in 
voluntary environmental credit markets; 
(xi) the extent to which the existing re-
gimes for generating and selling agriculture 
or forestry credits, as the regimes exist at 
the end of the preceding 4-calendar year pe-
riod, and historically, and existing voluntary 
environmental credit markets, may be im-
peded or constricted, or achieve greater scale 
and reach, if the Department of Agriculture 
were involved, including by considering the 
role of the Department of Agriculture in re-
ducing the barriers to entry identified under 
clause (v), including by educating stake-
holders about voluntary environmental cred-
it markets; 
(xii) the extent to which existing protocols 
in voluntary environmental credit markets, 
including verification, additionality, perma-
nence, and reporting, adequately take into 
consideration and account for factors en-
countered by the agriculture and private for-
est sectors in preventing, reducing, or miti-
gating greenhouse gases or sequestering car-
bon through agriculture and forestry prac-
tices, considering variances across regions, 
topography, soil types, crop or species vari-
eties, and business models; 
(xiii) the extent to which existing proto-
cols in voluntary environmental credit mar-
kets consider options to ensure the contin-
ued valuation, through discounting or other 
means, of agriculture and forestry credits in 
the case of the practices underlying those 
credits being disrupted due to unavoidable 
events, including production challenges and 
natural disasters; and 
(xiv) opportunities for other voluntary 
markets outside of voluntary environmental 
credit markets to foster the trading, buying, 
or selling of credits that are derived from ac-
tivities that provide other ecosystem service 
benefits, including activities that improve 
water quality, water quantity, wildlife habi-
tat enhancement, and other ecosystem serv-
ices, as the Secretary determines appro-
priate; 
(B) publish the assessment; and 
(C) submit the assessment to the Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and For-
estry of the Senate and the Committee on 
Agriculture of the House of Representatives.

of paragraph (1) every 4 years after the publi-
cation and submission of the first assess-
ment under subparagraphs (B) and (C) of 
paragraph (1). 
(i) REPORT.—Not later than 2 years after 
the date on which the Program is estab-
lished, and every 2 years thereafter, the Sec-
retary shall publish and submit to the Com-
mittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and For-
estry of the Senate and the Committee on

as follows: 
At the end of title V of division B, add the 
following: 
SEC. 2528. GAO STUDY ON OVERSIGHT OF FED-
ERAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
GRANT MAKING AND INVESTMENTS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) in instances such as the Troubled Asset 
Relief Program, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, Iraq, and Afghani-
stan, Congress has created special inspectors 
general and other oversight entities focused 
on particular program areas who have per-
formed in outstanding ways; 
(2) the oversight entities described in para-
graph (1) have helped to strengthen oversight 
in cross-agency activities and where compo-
nent inspectors general may have otherwise 
faced significant challenges; 
(3) because of the cross-agency nature of 
Federal science and technology activities, 
Congress created the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy to coordinate and har-
monize among science functions at agencies; 
(4) the United States innovation eco-
system, which uses multiple science agencies 
to invest in research and development, can 
make it more difficult to identify and re-
move scientists who violate research integ-
rity principles; 
(5) the single agency jurisdiction of an 
agency inspector general can be a disadvan-
tage with respect to their oversight roles, 
and opportunities to strengthen the system 
may exist; 
(6) single agency jurisdiction of inspectors 
general may also make it difficult to har-
monize principles and standards for over-
sight of waste, fraud, and abuse among agen-
cies; and 
(7) certain issues of fraud, waste, and abuse 
in Federal science and technology activities

SA 2056. Mr. PAUL submitted an 
amendment intended to be proposed to 
amendment SA 1502 proposed by Mr. 
SCHUMER to the bill S. 1260, to establish 
a new Directorate for Technology and 
Innovation in the National Science 
Foundation, to establish a regional 
technology hub program, to require a 
strategy and report on economic secu-
rity, 
science, 
research, 
innovation, 
manufacturing, and job creation, to es-
tablish a critical supply chain resil-
iency program, and for other purposes; 
which was ordered to lie on the table; 
as follows: 
Beginning on page 478, strike line 17, and 
all that follows through page 485, line 18, and 
insert the following: 
SEC. 2527. BASIC RESEARCH. 
(a) NONDISCLOSURE OF MEMBERS OF GRANT 
REVIEW PANEL.—Notwithstanding any other 
provision of law, each agency that awards a 
Federal research grant shall not disclose, ei-
ther publicly or privately, to an applicant 
for such grant the identity of any member of 
the grant review panel for such applicant. 
(b) 
DOWNSTREAM
REPORTING; 
IMPAR-
TIALITY.— 
(1) DOWNSTREAM
REPORTING.—Any person 
or institution awarded a grant from a Fed-
eral research agency shall— 
(A) notify and seek authorization from the 
relevant agency for any funds derived from 
the grant made available through a subgrant 
or subsequent grant (including to an em-
ployee or subdivision of the grant recipient’s 
organization); and 
(B) ensure that each subgrant or subse-
quent grant award (including to an employee 
or subdivision of the grant recipient’s orga-
nization) funded with funds derived from the 
Federal grant is within the scope of the Fed-
eral grant award. 
(2) IMPARTIALITY IN FUNDING SCIENTIFIC RE-
SEARCH.—Notwithstanding any other provi-
sion of law, each Federal agency, in award-
ing grants for scientific research, shall be 
impartial and shall not seek to advance any 
political position or fund a grant to reach a 
predetermined conclusion. 
SEC. 2528. GAO STUDY ON OVERSIGHT OF FED-
ERAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY 
GRANT MAKING AND INVESTMENTS. 
(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds that— 
(1) in instances such as the Troubled Asset 
Relief Program, the American Recovery and 
Reinvestment Act of 2009, Iraq, and Afghani-
stan, Congress has created special inspectors 
general and other oversight entities focused 
on particular program areas who have per-
formed in outstanding ways; 
(2) the oversight entities described in para-
graph (1) have helped to strengthen oversight 
in cross-agency activities and where compo-
nent inspectors general may have otherwise 
faced significant challenges; 
(3) because of the cross-agency nature of 
Federal science and technology activities, 
Congress created the Office of Science and 
Technology Policy to coordinate and har-
monize among science functions at agencies; 
(4) the United States innovation eco-
system, which uses multiple science agencies 
to invest in research and development, can 
make it more difficult to identify and re-
move scientists who violate research integ-
rity principles; 
(5) the single agency jurisdiction of an 
agency inspector general can be a disadvan-
tage with respect to their oversight roles, 
and opportunities to strengthen the system 
may exist; 
(6) single agency jurisdiction of inspectors 
general may also make it difficult to har-
monize principles and standards for over-
sight of waste, fraud, and abuse among agen-
cies; and 
(7) certain issues of fraud, waste, and abuse 
in Federal science and technology activities 
span multiple agencies and are more appar-
ent through cross-agency oversight. 
(b) STUDY.—Not later than 1 year after the 
date of enactment of this Act, the Comp-
troller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study and submit to Congress a re-
port that— 
(1) evaluates the frequency of cases of 
waste, fraud, or abuse perpetrated across 
multiple Federal science agencies by an 
awardee or group of awardees; 
(2) evaluates the effectiveness of existing 
mechanisms to detect waste, fraud, and 
abuse perpetrated across multiple Federal 
science agencies by an awardee or group of 
awardees; and 
(3) evaluates options for strengthening de-
tection of waste, fraud, and abuse per-
petrated across multiple Federal science 
agencies by an awardee or group of awardees, 
including by examining the benefits and 
drawbacks of— 
(A) providing additional support to agency 
inspectors general with regard to coordi-
nated oversight of Federal and technology 
grant making investments; and 
(B) alternative mechanisms for strength-
ening prevention and detection of waste, 
fraud, and abuse across Federal science agen-
cies perpetrated across multiple Federal 
science agencies by an awardee or group of 
awardees, such as the establishment of a spe-
cial inspector general or other mechanisms 
as the Comptroller General sees fit.

SEC. 3219L. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON STANDING 
WITH 
AUSTRALIA 
AGAINST 
ECO-
NOMIC COERCION. 
(a) SENSE OF CONGRESS.—It is the sense of 
Congress that— 
(1) the alliance between the United States 
and Australia provides strategic, economic, 
and cultural value to both nations; 
(2) the security and prosperity of each is 
vital to the future security and prosperity of 
both nations; 
(3) the close, longstanding cooperation be-
tween the United States and Australia in 
strategic and military affairs is built on 
strong bonds of trust between the two na-
tions and a shared goal of establishing a free, 
open, secure, prosperous, and resilient Indo- 
Pacific; 
(4) Australia continues to be the target of 
a concerted campaign of economic coercion 
by the People’s Republic of China aimed at 
punishing the government and people of one 
of the United States’ closest allies for the ex-
ercise of their sovereign, democratic rights; 
(5) the People’s Republic of China employs 
similar forms of economic coercion against 
other countries, not only within the Indo-Pa-
cific but around the world; 
(6) such a campaign is an attempt to un-
dermine the sovereignty of Australia and the 
ability of the Government of Australia to act 
in concert with the United States toward the 
shared goal of a free and open Indo-Pacific; 
and 
(7) the routine use of economic coercion by 
the People’s Republic of China against other 
countries can undermine those countries’ 
ability to speak or act in defense of their 
own sovereignty, democratic values, and 
human rights, and is therefore a threat to a 
free and open global order. 
(b) STATEMENT OF POLICY.—It shall be the 
policy of the United States— 
(1) to stand with Australia, providing rel-
evant support to the Government and people 
of Australia to mitigate the costs of eco-
nomic coercion by the People’s Republic of 
China to the greatest extent possible;

section (b), except a student who is eligible 
to receive a job training Federal Pell Grant 
under this subsection is a student who— 
‘‘(A) 
has 
not

job training Federal Pell Grant for an eligi-
ble student shall be determined under sub-
section (b), except that a student who is eli-
gible for less than the minimum Federal Pell 
Grant because the eligible job training pro-
gram is less than an academic year (in clock- 
hours and weeks of instructional time) may 
still be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant.

IN
TOTAL
ELIGIBILITY
PE-
RIOD.—Any period during which a student re-
ceives a job training Federal Pell Grant

are enrolled in an eligible job training pro-
gram at an eligible institution of higher edu-
cation on less than a full-time basis.

this subsection and a Federal Pell Grant 
under this section.

COLLECTION.— 
‘‘(A) INTERAGENCY DATA SHARING.—The Sec-
retary shall coordinate and enter into a data 
sharing agreement with the Secretary of

program approval not later than 1 year after

RETARY.—If at any time the Secretary deter-
mines that a program previously approved

any of the requirements of an eligible job

‘‘(I) shall deny a subsequent renewal of ap-
proval in accordance with clause (iii) for 
such program after the expiration of the ap-
proval period; 
‘‘(II) may withdraw approval for such pro-
gram before the expiration of the approval

cation’ means—

higher education provides a student who has 
completed a noncredit program with the 
equivalent academic credit that may be ap-
plied to a subsequent credit-bearing certifi-
cate or degree program upon enrollment in 
such program at such institution. 
‘‘(F) WIOA DEFINITIONS.—The terms ‘indus-
try or sector partnership’, ‘in-demand indus-
try sector or occupation’, ‘recognized post-

MENT.— 
‘‘(A) IN GENERAL.—Subject to subparagraph 
(B), as a condition of participation under 
this subsection, the Secretary shall, using 
the data collected under paragraph (8) and 
such other information as the Secretary may 
require, determine whether such job training 
program meets the requirements of para-
graph (1)(B)(i)(V) with respect to whether the 
students who complete the program receive a 
median increase of 20 percent of such stu-
dents’ total earnings. For the purposes of 
this paragraph, the Secretary shall deter-
mine such percentage increase by calcu-
lating the difference between the total earn-
ings of students who enroll in such programs 
not more than 6 months prior to enrollment, 
and the earnings of students who complete 
such program not more than 6 months after 
completing such program. 
‘‘(B) DATE
OF
EFFECT.—The requirement 
under this paragraph shall take effect begin-
ning on the date that is 1 year after the date 
the program has been approved as an eligible 
job training program under this subsection. 
‘‘(3) APPEAL
OF
EARNINGS
INFORMATION.— 
The Secretary’s determination under para-
graph (2) may include an appeals process to 
permit job training programs to submit al-
ternate discretionary or total earnings data, 
respectively, provided that such data are sta-
tistically rigorous, accurate, comparable, 
and representative of students who complete 
the program. 
‘‘(4) AUTHORIZATION OF AWARDS.—The Sec-
retary shall award Federal Pell Grants to 
students in eligible job training programs 
(referred to as a ‘job training Federal Pell 
Grant’). Each eligible job training Federal 
Pell Grant awarded under this subsection 
shall have the same terms and conditions, 
and be awarded in the same manner, as other 
Federal Pell Grants awarded under sub-
section (b), except a student who is eligible 
to receive a job training Federal Pell Grant 
under this subsection is a student who— 
‘‘(A) 
has 
not 
yet 
attained 
a 
postbaccalaureate degree; 
‘‘(B) is enrolled, or accepted for enroll-
ment, in an eligible job training program at 
an eligible institution of higher education; 
and 
‘‘(C) meets all other eligibility require-
ments for a Federal Pell Grant (except with 
respect to the type of program of study, as 
provided in subparagraph (B)). 
‘‘(5) AMOUNT OF AWARD.—The amount of a 
job training Federal Pell Grant for an eligi-
ble student shall be determined under sub-
section (b), except that a student who is eli-
gible for less than the minimum Federal Pell 
Grant because the eligible job training pro-
gram is less than an academic year (in clock- 
hours and weeks of instructional time) may 
still be eligible for a Federal Pell Grant. 
‘‘(6) INCLUSION
IN
TOTAL
ELIGIBILITY
PE-
RIOD.—Any period during which a student re-
ceives a job training Federal Pell Grant 
under this subsection shall be included in 
calculating the student’s period of eligibility 
for Federal Pell Grants under subsection (d), 
and the eligibility requirements regarding 
students who are enrolled in an under-
graduate program on less than a full-time 
basis shall similarly apply to students who 
are enrolled in an eligible job training pro-
gram at an eligible institution of higher edu-
cation on less than a full-time basis. 
‘‘(7) SAME
PAYMENT
PERIOD.—No student 
may for the same payment period receive 
both a job training Federal Pell Grant under 
this subsection and a Federal Pell Grant 
under this section. 
‘‘(8) INTERAGENCY DATA SHARING AND DATA 
COLLECTION.— 
‘‘(A) INTERAGENCY DATA SHARING.—The Sec-
retary shall coordinate and enter into a data 
sharing agreement with the Secretary of 
Labor to ensure access to data necessary to 
implement this paragraph, including such 
data related to indicators of performance 
collected under section 116 of the Workforce 
Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C.

GRAMS.—Except as provided under subpara-
graph (C), each institution of higher edu-
cation offering an eligible job training pro-
gram for which the Secretary awards job 
training Federal Pell Grants under this sub-
section, the Secretary shall, on at least an
