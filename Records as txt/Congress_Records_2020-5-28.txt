WASHINGTON, THURSDAY, MAY 28, 2020 
No. 100 
House of Representatives 
The House met at 9 a.m. and was 
called to order by the Speaker pro tem-
pore (Mr. CARSON of Indiana).

DESIGNATION OF THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore laid be-
fore the House the following commu-
nication from the Speaker: 
WASHINGTON, DC, 
May 28, 2020. 
I hereby appoint the Honorable ANDRE´ 
CARSON to act as Speaker pro tempore on 
this day. 
NANCY PELOSI, 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
f 
PRAYER 
The Chaplain, the Reverend Patrick 
J. Conroy, offered the following prayer: 
God of the universe, thank You for 
giving us another day. 
Throughout 
the 
country, 
people 
mourn those whom they have lost; peo-
ple lament the loss of businesses, of 
normalcy. 
100,000 have now died of COVID–19. 
They were Democrats and Republicans. 
They lived in urban areas, and now, 
more and more, in rural areas. They 
were the descendants of men and 
women who were colonists, or Found-
ing Fathers, and immigrants who had 
recently become citizens. They were 
disproportionately people of color, but 
not only of color, and of every religion 
and culture in this Nation. 
When, O Lord, will we come to under-
stand that we are all in this together, 
that if we do not stand together, we 
risk falling together? Heal the divi-
sions within our body politic, within 
this Chamber, so that Your healing 
power, through our actions and good-
will, can be manifest in our United 
States. 
May everything done this day, and in 
the days and weeks to come, be for 
Your greater honor and glory. 
Amen.

THE JOURNAL 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 4(a) of House Resolution 
967, the Journal of the last day’s pro-
ceedings is approved.

PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Will the 
gentleman 
from 
California 
(Mr. 
LAMALFA) come forward and lead the 
House in the Pledge of Allegiance. 
Mr. LAMALFA led the Pledge of Alle-
giance as follows: 
I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the 
United States of America, and to the Repub-
lic for which it stands, one nation under God, 
indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Chair will entertain up to five requests 
for 1-minute speeches on each side of 
the aisle. 
f 
BLACK LIVES MATTER 
(Mr. KENNEDY asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. 
KENNEDY. 
‘‘We 
hold 
these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men 
are created equal, that they are en-
dowed by their creator with certain 
unalienable rights, that among these 
are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap-
piness.’’ 
Tell me, where was the right to life 
for Breonna Taylor, who was killed in 
her own bed by police and her boy-
friend arrested for trying to protect 
her? 
Where is the liberty for Ahmaud 
Arbery, killed for going for a jog, or 
Eric Garner, killed while begging for 
his breath, or George Floyd, killed 
while under the knee of an officer ut-
tering those same words, ‘‘I can’t 
breathe’’? 
Where is the pursuit of happiness for 
Christian Cooper, who couldn’t go bird 
watching without having the cops 
called on him? 
Where is the equality in a nation 
where we proclaim that Black lives 
matter, yet we see our own neighbors’ 
humanity stolen and still fail to pro-
vide justice? 
250 years after our Nation wrote 
those words, those rights are not 
unalienable. If you are Black in Amer-
ica today, they do not exist. 
All of us, any of us—with power and 
privilege—are accountable. We owe 
them better. 
f 
INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE 
NEEDS TO GET IT TOGETHER 
(Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of South Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, last I knew, 20 million Amer-
ican had not received their stimulus 
checks. 
In the 3 months since the CARES 
Act, I have been patient; South Dako-
tans have been patient as they wait for 
help some of them truly need. 
Mr. Speaker, my patience has run 
low, especially since Americans are 
also waiting months for their tax re-
turns. 
Ben, from Marshall County, filed his 
in February. He is $400 short on rent. 
He has been counting on his tax return. 
It is his money. But the IRS has not re-
turned his phone calls, and they have 
not returned the phone calls or emails 
of congressional offices. 
Workers in hospitals and in factories 
and in packing plants and in banks are 
working overtime to meet the needs of 
this Nation. I do not see that same

dedication from the leadership of the

for them to get it together.

TIME TO GIVE AMERICA HOPE 
(Mrs. MCBATH asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Mrs. MCBATH. Mr. Speaker, this is 
not the time to back down. 
In my home State of Georgia, hard-
working Georgians have been laid off, 
small businesses have had to close, and 
families are worried about the health 
and well-being of their loved ones. 
Americans everywhere are counting 
on us to help them get through this 
crisis as safely as possible. This is what 
we are sent to Washington to do: to 
protect and to uplift our communities 
in a time such as this. 
We must work together, Republicans 
and Democrats, to make a difference in 
the lives of those we represent when 
they need us most. 
This is the time to give America 
hope. 
This is the time to govern with our 
hearts, and not partisan politics, be-
cause we can get through this pan-
demic together, stronger and more uni-
fied than before. 
f 
REMEMBERING SAM JOHNSON 
(Mr. LAMALFA asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LAMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
sadness today, acknowledging the news 
I received late last night of the loss of 
our former colleague from Texas, Mr. 
Sam Johnson, a great American. 
I had the pleasure of knowing him 
personally. His story is amazing of his 
life serving our country. Of course, he 
is known as being a Vietnam POW, 
held 7 years in what is known as the 
Hanoi Hilton. 
He wrote a book about his exploits, 
including that part, called ‘‘Captive 
Warriors: A Vietnam POW’s Story.’’ I 
would highly recommend everybody 
get that and then pass it along. 
My sweetest memory of him is Lead-
er MCCARTHY invited a group of about 
10 of us Members to go have dinner 
with him one night and just sit and lis-
ten to this man talk about his life, not 
only the negative of being a POW, but 
what we always saw here in his posi-
tive, upbeat spirit all the time. 
This guy was a true cool guy. He was 
a Thunderbird aerobatic team member 
and also later directed the Air Force 
Fighter Weapons School, which is 
known as the Top Gun version of the 
Air Force. 
This was an all-around great Amer-
ican. We will miss him badly. 
f 
THE NEED FOR PERSONAL 
PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT 
(Ms. SCANLON asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Ms. SCANLON. Mr. Speaker, we have 
lost over 100,000 lives to this pan-
demic—that we know of—and people on 
the front lines are still waiting for the 
PPE they need to protect themselves 
and our communities. 
Every single day, healthcare pro-
viders, States, and first responders tell 
us that they are being forced to com-
pete for high-priced supplies, if they 
can find any at all. They are told to 
keep a 90-day supply for the fall surge, 
when it is a miracle if they have 
enough supplies for 2 weeks. 
Our frontline workers are feeling 
abandoned by their government. How 
can we blame them? 
The President is claiming victory in 
a crisis we are still fighting, visiting 
State after State and saying it is safe 
to reopen completely when it is not. He 
has the authority to use the Defense 
Production Act to increase production 
of PPE to save lives and chooses not 
to, while the safety of our frontline 
workers hangs in the balance. 
We have sent countless letters, intro-
duced bills, and passed legislation. We 
need the President to act. The Amer-
ican people need straight talk, not 
magical thinking. We need leaders who 
listen to civil servants when they raise 
alarms, not fire the messenger. 
We can defeat this pandemic if we 
hear the facts and act on them. 
f 
AMERICA’S LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY 
IN CRISIS 
(Mr. HAGEDORN asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today because America’s livestock in-
dustry is in crisis. In southern Min-
nesota and across the country, this has 
particularly hit our hog farmers. They 
are in big trouble. Packing plant dis-
ruptions have led to excess hogs and 
the actual destruction of animals and 
not even using the meat for the food 
supply. 
The situation is so bad that, this 
week, I introduced legislation to miti-
gate losses in this area. I introduced 
the Livestock Producer Assistance for 
COVID–19 Damages Act. This bill will 
expand the USDA’s Emergency Assist-
ance for Livestock, Honeybees, and 
Farm-Raised Catfish Program to cover 
income losses for farmers and pro-
ducers who have been unable to market 
livestock due to packing plant clo-
sures. 
In Minnesota, our hog operators 
make a significant contribution to our 
State’s economy. According to a study 
from the University of Minnesota, cur-
rent disruptions in the pork supply 
chain, coupled with the current 15 per-
cent unemployment rate, could result 
in an estimated loss of $660 million of 
economic activity in our State. The re-
searchers also concluded that a 15 per-
cent drop in hog production would lead 
to an estimated loss of 2,100 Minnesota 
jobs. 
While these statistics are rightfully 
alarming, this problem is not unique to 
Minnesota. States like South Dakota, 
Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia, and 
Iowa have similar issues. Pork and 
livestock producers are suffering huge 
losses, financial and otherwise, and all 
through no fault of their own. 
I urge my colleagues on both sides of 
the aisle to join me in supporting this 
bill. We must stand with our family 
farmers and defend the interests of 
rural communities, the American econ-
omy, and our food supply. 
f 
INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO 
HEALTHCARE ISSUES 
(Mr. MORELLE asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MORELLE. Mr. Speaker, with so 
much uncertainty in our future, fami-
lies shouldn’t have the additional bur-
den of worrying about the state of 
their 
healthcare. 
Unfortunately, 
though, COVID–19 has only further ex-
posed the cracks in our healthcare sys-
tem and forced us all to face the ur-
gency with which we must work to ad-
dress them. 
As we continue to respond to the pub-
lic health crisis, I have been working 
with my colleagues here in the House 
to find innovative and timely solutions 
for the problems that COVID–19 con-
tinues to exacerbate. 
Over the past several months, I have 
fought for the price of insulin and 
other drugs to be lowered immediately 
because families that are struggling 
need access to lifesaving medication. I 
fought alongside my colleagues for 
more supplies for our healthcare work-
ers, for hospitals, and for community 
healthcare centers. 
We can’t let up now. We must con-
tinue to take steps that address the 
health disparities that place a signifi-
cant and dangerous burden on Amer-
ican families. 
I would like to join my colleagues 
and constituents in remembering the 
lives tragically lost during this pan-
demic and recommit to working to-
gether to help families across our coun-
try stay safe. 
f 
HONORING JACK ‘‘JD’’ BARNES 
SHAW 
(Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania 
asked and was given permission to ad-
dress the House for 1 minute and to re-
vise and extend his remarks.) 
Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratu-
late Jack ‘‘JD’’ Barnes Shaw of Rus-
sell, Pennsylvania, for accepting a 
fully qualified appointment to the 
United States Naval Academy. 
Jack is the son of James and Ruth 
Shaw and a senior at Agora Cyber 
Charter School. During his time in 
school, Jack was very involved with 
the Boy Scouts, Civil Air Patrol, and 
fencing.

Over the years, Jack has held many 
leadership positions, including senior 
patrol leader in his Boy Scout troop 
and a Sea Scout National Quarterdeck, 
a representative on the Sea Scout Na-
tional Committee. He is an Eagle Scout 
and has been recognized as the 2018 
Northeast Region Sea Scout of the 
Year. 
Jack’s dedication and discipline are 
two traits that will lead to his success 
at the U.S. Naval Academy. Jack is a 
proven leader. I wish him the best in 
this exciting new chapter of his life.

RECOGNIZING JOE JOYCE 
(Mr. ROSE of New York asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute.) 
Mr. ROSE of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
I rise today to remember all those who 
we have lost to the coronavirus, and 
one man in particular who is close to 
my heart and the hearts of thousands 
of people in my district. 
Joe Joyce may best be known for his 
bar in Bay Ridge, J.J. Bubbles, but the 
truth is he served our community 
much more than cold beer. His gen-
erous spirit touched countless lives on 
both sides of the Verrazzano. 
Joe was an Army veteran who served 
in Vietnam, and after he returned 
home his service continued. He worked 
as a phys ed teacher for disabled stu-
dents on Staten Island, supported the 
Special Olympics, and would offer up 
his bar to host fundraisers for any or-
ganization who asked. That was one 
thing that never changed over the 42 
years Joe was in business. As soon as 
you walked into J.J. Bubbles you were 
family. 
Today, we remember and think of 
Joe’s family: his wife, Jane; his chil-
dren, Eddie, Kristin, Kevin; and his six 
grandchildren. Joe’s loss can be felt all 
throughout my district, but his gift to 
all of us was his unique ability to bring 
people of all stripes together, and that 
is a gift we need now more than ever. 
f 
QUALITY HEALTHCARE FOR 
VETERANS 
(Mr. WATKINS asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. WATKINS. Mr. Speaker, today I 
rise in support of S. 3084, the Competi-
tive Pay for Leaders in Veterans 
Healthcare Act. This legislation was 
introduced by my good friend and fel-
low Kansan, the chairman of the Sen-
ate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs, 
Senator JERRY MORAN. 
Our Nation’s veterans deserve the 
best care possible. We must ensure that 
the VA can recruit and retain high- 
quality talented leaders. The Competi-
tive Pay for Leaders in Veterans 
Healthcare Act is less about the lead-
ers, actually, it is more about the vet-
erans as the quality of their care is the 
direct result of the quality of the VA 
leadership. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I support 
the Competitive Pay for Leaders in 
Veterans Healthcare Act and encour-
age my colleagues to do the same. No 
one fights harder for our veterans than 
President Trump. He has always made 
us a top priority, and I am glad that he 
and the VA Secretary will support this 
measure, and I look forward to its pas-
sage.

ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER 
PRO TEMPORE 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to clause 8 of rule XX, the Chair 
will

further

today on motions to suspend the rules 
on which the yeas and nays are or-

The House will resume proceedings

VETERANS’ COMPENSATION COST- 
OF-LIVING ADJUSTMENT ACT OF 
2020

pensation for veterans with service- 
connected disabilities and the rates of

lished by reason of a determination made

year 2021. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous materials on H.R. 
6168. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6168, the Veterans’ 
Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjust-
ment Act of 2020 increases veterans’ 
disability compensation at the same 
rate as the annual Social Security in-
crease. This puts a little extra money 
in the pockets of our disabled veterans 
and their families to make sure VA 
benefits keep pace with inflation. 
While this increase may be a small 
one, it is an essential one that veterans 
and their families rely on us passing 
each year. In my time as chairman of 
the Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I 
have had the opportunity to speak to 
and know many veterans. Many of 
them highlight this bill as a priority 
for them and their families. 
The 
cost-of-living 
adjustment, 
or 
COLA, is vital for ensuring that vet-
erans’ benefits do not decline due to 
changes in the economy. For veterans 
with 
service-connected 
disabilities, 
this annual change is an assurance to 
them and their families that their ben-
efits will remain consistent. It is a 
guarantee we make to them and a 
great source of comfort to many vet-
erans and their families. 
As our country deals with the novel 
coronavirus pandemic, and the severe 
economic effects it will have, it is more 
important than ever that we pass this 
yearly COLA increase so that veterans 
and their families trust that their ben-
efits will not decline due to inflation.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2328 
May 28, 2020 
I want to recognize the work of the 
Disability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs 
Subcommittee 
chair, 
ELAINE 
LURIA, for introducing H.R. 6168. I 
wholeheartedly support H.R. 6168, and 
urge all of my colleagues to do so as 
well. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of H.R. 6168, the Veterans’ Compensa-
tion Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 
2020. The bill was introduced by Dis-
ability Assistance and Memorial Af-
fairs 
Subcommittee 
Chair 
ELAINE 
LURIA
and 
Ranking Member MIKE 
BOST. I appreciate their leadership on 
this important issue. 
The Department of Veterans Affairs 
provides compensation benefits to help 
fulfill our obligation to take care of 
the brave men and women who have 
been injured during their service to 
this great Nation. 
H.R. 6168 would authorize a cost-of- 
living increase for veterans and their 
families next year, if Social Security 
recipients receive an increase. The an-
nual COLA is necessary to help vet-
erans and families afford their living 
expenses when prices go up. 
Currently, many of our Nation’s vet-
erans may have been affected by this 
pandemic and are worried about how 
they are going to pay their bills. The 
last thing that should be on their 
minds is whether the value of their VA 
benefits will keep pace with inflation. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Mem-
bers to support H.R. 6168. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 
minutes to the gentlewoman from Vir-
ginia (Mrs. LURIA), my good friend and 
the chairwoman of the Disability As-
sistance and Memorial Affairs Sub-
committee, the author of H.R. 6168, and 
a former naval commander. 
Mrs. LURIA. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today to speak in support of my bipar-
tisan bill, H.R. 6168, the Veterans’ Com-
pensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment 
Act of 2020. 
During these trying times, I continue 
to keep our Nation’s veterans at the 
top of my mind as they face unprece-
dented 
challenges 
due 
to 
the 
coronavirus pandemic. This bill will 
provide the economic relief and pay 
raise that our veterans have earned. 
It is an honor to represent more than 
102,000 veterans, the highest total of 
any district in Virginia, and one of the 
highest in the country. Our veterans 
put their lives on the line and deployed 
far from home to keep America safe. As 
a 20-year Navy veteran myself, I am 
proud to bring a bill to the floor that 
protects the benefits our veterans have 
earned from their service to our coun-
try. 
H.R. 6168 provides cost-of-living in-
creases for wartime disability com-
pensation, compensation for depend-
ents, clothing allowance, dependency 
and 
indemnities 
compensation 
for 
spouses, and dependency and indemnity 
compensation for surviving children. 
Congress must honor our commit-
ment to those American heroes who 
served in harm’s way so that we could 
live in peace at home. As we continue 
to fight this pandemic, I ask that we 
all keep in mind those who have kept 
us safe at home and abroad.

The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3414 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE. 
This Act may be cited as the ‘‘Major Med-
ical Facility Authorization Act of 2020’’.

2020 or the year in which funds are appro-
priated for the Construction, Major Projects 
account, $2,271,292,000 for the projects au-
thorized in subsection (a). 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 3414. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 3414, the Major Medical Facility 
Authorization Act of 2020. 
Each year the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs submits an annual budget 
request to Congress, and then it is our 
job to authorize and appropriate the 
funding that VA needs to care for 
America’s veterans and their families. 
Within that larger funding request is 
VA’s request for funds to replace and 
modernize its medical facilities. This 
year’s 
major 
construction 
requests 
total $2.27 billion, and will build a new 
critical care center in West Los Ange-
les, California; complete construction 
of a medical facility project in San 
Juan, Puerto Rico; construct a spinal 
cord injury center with a community 
living center in San Diego, California; 
complete flood recovery construction 
at the medical center in Manhattan, 
New York; and fully fund the medical 
facility replacement project in Louis-
ville, Kentucky; as well as construct an 
outpatient clinic and a national ceme-
tery in Alameda, California; and fi-
nally, realign the Livermore, Cali-
fornia campus. 
Mr. Speaker, with a major construc-
tion need that totals more than $15 bil-
lion, this authorization takes needed 
steps to reduce the backlog of major 
construction projects. 
It is no secret that VA’s infrastruc-
ture is old. The average age of its fa-
cilities is 60. The Secretary of the VA 
himself, Secretary Wilkie, emphasized 
this point by making the statement: 
There are several VA facilities that 
Abraham Lincoln would recognize.

May 28, 2020 
Even with outdated facilities, the 
Annals of Internal Medicine found in a 
2018 report that VA provides better 
care than private options in most 
cases. That is right. VA provides better 
care, even though they are working 
from outdated facilities. What would 
those findings look like if VA was com-
peting with a modern infrastructure? 
Mr. Speaker, not only does VA pro-
vide better care, veterans want to use 
VA-delivered healthcare. A survey con-
ducted by the Veterans of Foreign 
Wars found that 92 percent of veterans 
who participated in the survey re-
sponded that fixing VA facilities was 
the best way to improve VA’s delivery 
of healthcare to veterans. 
Ninety percent of respondents who 
use VA stated they would recommend 
VA healthcare to another veteran. 
It is clear that veterans, given the 
option, 
want 
to 
preserve 
the 
VA 
healthcare system and feel that it is a 
quality option for veterans to receive 
care. 
Mr. Speaker, that is why I support S. 
3414. I thank Senator MORAN, the chair-
man of the Senate Committee on Vet-
erans’ Affairs, for prioritizing and pass-
ing this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
b 0930 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 3414, the VA Major Medical Facil-
ity Authorization Act. This bill is 
sponsored by my good friends on the 
other side of the Capitol, Chairman 
JERRY
MORAN
and Ranking Member 
JON TESTER of the Senate Committee 
on Veterans’ Affairs. 
This bill would authorize the con-
struction of the Department of Vet-
erans Affairs major medical facility 
projects in Kentucky, California, New 
York, and Puerto Rico. The COVID–19 
pandemic has shown us the value of the 
VA healthcare system in serving not 
just our Nation’s veterans, which is the 
Department’s foremost responsibility, 
but also in supporting all Americans 
during times of crisis. 
The seven projects that would be au-
thorized in this legislation have been 
requested by the administration in 
VA’s most recent budget submission. 
They would increase access to high- 
quality care and services to veterans of 
all ages and eras. It would also ensure 
that VA is better able to fulfill the De-
partment’s important service training, 
research, and emergency response mis-
sions. 
Mr. Speaker, to associate myself 
with the chairman’s remarks, Abraham 
Lincoln would recognize the VA med-
ical center in my hometown, which was 
authorized right after the Civil War 
and opened in 1903 as an Old Soldiers’ 
Home and now is a first-class VA med-
ical center. 
I urge all of my colleagues to join me 
in supporting this bill. Mr. Speaker, I 
reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I have no further speakers. I 
urge all of my colleagues to join in sup-
porting this bill, and I yield back the 
balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I encour-
age all of my colleagues to vote ‘‘yes’’ 
on passage of this important legisla-
tion, S. 3414, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3414. 
The question was taken; and (two-

MODIFYING PAY LIMITATION FOR 
CERTAIN HIGH-LEVEL EMPLOY-
EES AND OFFICERS OF DEPART-
MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I move to 
suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 
3084) to amend title 38, United States 
Code, to modify the limitation on pay 
for certain high-level employees and 
officers of the Department of Veterans 
Affairs, as amended. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
The text of the bill is as follows: 
S. 3084 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in 
Congress assembled, 
SECTION 1. MODIFICATION OF PAY LIMITATION 
FOR CERTAIN HIGH-LEVEL EMPLOY-
EES AND OFFICERS OF THE DEPART-
MENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS. 
(a) MODIFICATION.—Section 7404(d) of title 
38, United States Code, is amended by insert-
ing ‘‘and except for individuals appointed 
under sections 7401(4) and 7306 of this title,’’ 
after ‘‘section 7457 of this title,’’. 
(b) WAIVERS.— 
(1) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Veterans 
Affairs may waive the limitation described 
in section 7404(d) of such title, as in effect on 
the day before the date of the enactment of 
this Act, on the amount of basic pay payable 
to individuals appointed under section 7401(4) 
or 7306 of such title for basic pay payable 
during the period— 
(A) beginning on November 1, 2010; and 
(B) ending on the day before the date of the 
enactment of this Act. 
(2) FORM.—The Secretary shall prescribe 
the form for requesting a waiver under para-
graph (1). 
(3) TREATMENT OF WAIVER.—A decision not 
to grant a waiver under paragraph (1) shall 
not be treated as an adverse action and is 
not subject to further appeal, third-party re-
view, or judicial review. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentleman from 
California (Mr. TAKANO) and the gen-
tleman from Tennessee (Mr. DAVID P. 
ROE) each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from California. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and to 
insert extraneous material on S. 3084, 
as amended. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gen-
tleman from California? 
There was no objection. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 
3084, as amended, a bill to modify the 
limitation on pay for certain high-level 
employees and officers of the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs. 
This legislation retroactively author-
izes VA to waive a limitation for basic 
pay for SES-equivalent employees em-
ployed at VA dating back to November 
1, 2010. These are senior-level clinicians 
who oversee critical VA medical oper-
ations at the VA Central Office and in 
Veterans Integrated Service Networks. 
Due to a conflicting interpretation of 
the law, these senior-level employees 
were overpaid by VA for almost 10 
years. VA did not notify Congress that 
it had been interpreting the pay cap in 
its statute as not applying to these em-
ployees until this year. 
Mr. Speaker, the Office of Manage-
ment and Budget and Office of Per-
sonnel Management have said this is 
an issue that affects approximately 40 
senior VA employees, some of whom 
play critical support roles in VA’s re-
sponse to the global COVID–19 pan-
demic. 
Now, without this legislative fix, 
these employees, through no fault of 
their own, will be liable for a salary 
overpayment, plus any benefits tied to 
the salary, to include employee and 
agency retirement fund contributions. 
While VA could request a waiver of 
this debt on behalf of the employees 
under the law, a waiver will not com-
pletely address the negative financial 
effects these employees will experi-
ence. Their retirement and Thrift Sav-
ings Plan matching debt cannot be cor-
rected. 
Mr. Speaker, VA has been making up 
the difference between the $156,000 cap 
and the rate of pay that has been re-
ceived by the affected employees with 
bonuses, which do not count toward 
employee and agency retirement fund 
contributions and other Federal bene-
fits. 
Since VA has faced significant chal-
lenges hiring qualified healthcare lead-
ers in the past, removing any remain-
ing barriers to ensuring VA can recruit 
and retain senior clinicians is crucial. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to 
support S. 3084, as amended, and I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself such time as I 
may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support 
of S. 3084, as amended. This bill is spon-
sored by Chairman JERRY MORAN and 
Ranking Member JON TESTER of the 
Senate Committee on Veterans’ Af-
fairs, and I am grateful for them for in-
troducing it.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2330 
May 28, 2020 
S. 3084, as amended, would correct an 
error in existing law that impedes em-
ployees serving in Senior Executive 
Service-equivalent positions in the De-
partment of Veterans Health Adminis-
tration from receiving their full sala-
ries. Congress passed legislation in 2010 
to ensure that the individuals in those 
positions would be appropriately com-
pensated for their work. 
However, VA discovered a technical 
error in that legislation just last year 
that, unless corrected, would result in 
those hardworking men and women in-
stead having their salaries signifi-
cantly reduced. It would also result in 
VA having to issue and collect debts 
for current and former employees who 
served in these high-level positions 
over the last decade. That is certainly 
not what Congress intended. 
The VA employees who are impacted 
by this issue are serving in mission- 
critical 
positions 
across 
the 
VA 
healthcare system. Many of them have 
been working around the clock, leading 
VA’s response to the COVID–19 pan-
demic. They are responsible for ensur-
ing that veterans and VA employees 
are safe and well cared for and that VA 
is able to fulfill the Department’s 
fourth mission obligation to support 
the national response to this crisis. 
They and their colleagues have per-
formed incredibly lifesaving work dur-
ing the pandemic. I commend them for 
their efforts, which I know will con-
tinue to be critical in the weeks and 
months ahead. Making them whole by 
passing this bill today is the least we 
can do for them in return. 
I am glad to be back at work in our 
Nation’s Capitol, as our constituents 
always intended for us to be, and to 
support this bill today as a small token 
of appreciation to the VA leaders who 
are steering the Department through 
the crisis on behalf of our Nation’s vet-
erans and families. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I have no 
further speakers, and I am prepared to 
close. I reserve the balance of my time. 
Mr. DAVID P. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. 
Speaker, I yield myself the balance of 
my time. I have no further speakers, 
and I am prepared to close. 
I would like to start, since Monday 
was Memorial Day, to associate myself 
with the remarks of Mr. LAMALFA from 
California about Sam Johnson, one of 
our colleagues. 
Sam Johnson is one of the reasons I 
am so proud to have served in this 
body. Sam was one of the most incred-
ible human beings I have ever met. He 
spent over 40 months in solitary con-
finement, chained to a concrete floor. 
This man came back to this country as 
a Wounded Warrior, but he did not let 
that stop him. He went ahead and had 
a very fulfilling life and really affected 
many of us in ways Sam will never 
know. 
I can remember seeing Sam on this 
floor. Sam was so beat up in his cap-
tivity that he would take his voting 
card and have to step up, raise up on 
his toes to put his card—I would get 
tears in my eyes watching him—put his 
card in that voting machine over there 
to cast his vote. 
We owe Sam and many veterans like 
him who have given the ultimate sac-
rifice to this great country a debt that 
we can never pay back. 
I served at the same time that Sam 
did. I was in the 2nd Infantry Division 
in Korea but I did not serve in Viet-
nam, and I can’t thank those men and 
women enough. 
To my colleagues, my brothers and 
sisters, welcome home. 
Mr. Speaker, before I yield back, I 
would like to take a moment to thank 
Chairman TAKANO and the leadership 
on both sides of the aisle for bringing 
these three important bills to the floor 
today. Our actions show that, like 
many other Americans, we can con-
tinue to do our jobs and our part to re-
open the country and our economy in a 
safe and productive way. 
While I am pleased that we are debat-
ing these bills today, I am disappointed 
that H.R. 3504, the Ryan Kules and 
Paul Benne Specially Adaptive Housing 
Improvement Act of 2019, was not in-
cluded on today’s agenda. H.R. 3504 is a 
bipartisan bill introduced by Rep-
resentatives GUS BILIRAKIS and MIKE 
LEVIN that would make important im-
provements to the specially adaptive 
housing program that helps severely 
injured veterans adapt their homes. 
The bill would also require important 
changes to the administration of VA 
work-study benefits and make im-
provements to the GI Bill. 
The bill has already passed the House 
and has now come back over from the 
Senate. It represents a four corners bi-
cameral agreement, and the bill is 
strongly supported by our veterans 
service organizations. 
I hope in the coming days we can 
pass the bill and send it to President 
Trump’s desk as soon as possible. Dur-
ing this difficult time, we should be 
doing all we can to help support se-
verely disabled veterans and student 
veterans. 
I thank the chairman. During this 
time that we have been at home with 
our constituents and with our families 
and really confined, we tried to con-
tinue to work, and I want to commend 
the chairman on being able to do this. 
Mr. Speaker, I encourage my col-
leagues to support this bill, and I yield 
back the balance of my time. 
Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. 
I associate myself with the remarks 
about the memory of our recently de-
parted former Member. Of course, all of 
our Vietnam veterans who paid the ul-
timate sacrifice but also those who 
came back from that service in that 
war, we all owe a debt of gratitude to-
ward them. 
I recall my own uncle, who, unfortu-
nately, committed suicide. I remember 
coming back from school and learning 
that he had committed suicide. We 
have so many of our Vietnam-era vet-
erans who are extremely vulnerable be-
cause they have underlying conditions. 
I know that many of our veterans have 
been playing leadership roles among 
their neighbors to lead their neighbors 
in responding to COVID–19, the novel 
coronavirus. 
I thank all of those veterans across 
our country for leading that effort. 
Coming off of the Memorial Day week-
end, it is certainly always a poignant 
holiday that we observe in recognition 
of those who made the ultimate sac-
rifice. 
With regard to S. 3084, I urge my col-
leagues to pass it. It is the right thing 
to do. We need to do right by the senior 
leaders of the VA. We need to make 
sure that we continue to attract the 
very best to serve our veterans in the 
service of the Veterans Department. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from California (Mr. 
TAKANO) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, S. 3084, as

The question was taken; and (two- 
thirds being in the affirmative) the

amended, was passed. 
A motion to reconsider was laid on

businesses, and the independently em-
ployed who are struggling to cope with 
the economic downturn brought about 
by the spread of COVID–19. 
By utilizing the SBA’s Economic In-
jury Disaster Loan Program and cre-
ating the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram, Congress took swift action to 
provide a necessary lifeline. And while 
both programs have saved countless 
livelihoods, jobs, and businesses, mil-
lions more remain left out. 
Unfortunately, it won’t matter how 
much money Congress spends to ad-
dress these problems if Congress can-
not track where the money is going to 
verify that it is reaching the families 
and businesses that need it most. 
To that end, my colleagues and I 
have sent multiple oversight letters to 
SBA requesting detailed data and in-
formation on the implementation of 
the Paycheck Protection Program and 
Economic Injury Disaster Loans. To 
date, we have not received anything 
more than what SBA has published on 
their website. This is simply unaccept-
able. 
It is vital that the administration be 
transparent and good stewards of tax-
payers’ dollars. I am proud to support 
the bipartisan effort before us today, 
led by my esteemed colleagues Mr. 
PHILLIPS
of 
Minnesota 
and 
Mr. 
FITZPATRICK of Pennsylvania. 
The bill requires SBA to publish an 
online database of the recipients of 
PPP and EIDL loans over $2 million. It 
would also list the number of employ-
ees at each business benefiting from 
this assistance and the amount of 
funds provided to underserved busi-
nesses. 
This is precisely the kind of data 
Congress needs to ensure that the pro-
grams are being administered as in-
tended and, more importantly, to en-
sure the scarce funds are reaching 
those communities and businesses that 
need it most. 
Furthermore, the bill includes lan-
guage that will decouple the 7(a) loan 
program and Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram accounts. 
Currently, both programs share the 
same appropriations account, meaning 
that once the Paycheck Protection 
Program appropriation lapses, the 7(a) 
loan program will shut down along 
with it. It was never congressional in-
tent to tie the future of both programs 
together, so in order to preserve the 
sustainability of the 7(a) loan program, 
it is necessary to decouple the two ac-
counts. 
At a time when the future of the 
small business economy is so uncer-
tain, it is of top importance to ensure 
the long-term sustainability of the 7(a) 
loan program. This language achieves 
that goal. 
I applaud the bipartisanship and, 
more importantly, the commitment to 
being good stewards of the taxpayers’ 
dollars. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge all my col-
leagues, Republican and Democrat, to 
join me in voting for stronger trans-
parency and oversight of the CARES 
Act programs. Our hardworking small 
business owners and the American peo-
ple deserve no less. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
I rise in reluctant opposition to H.R. 
6782, the Small Business Transparency 
and Reporting for the Underbanked and 
Taxpayers at Home Act, or the TRUTH 
Act, as amended. 
Mr. Speaker, I do want to express my 
appreciation 
to 
Chairwoman 
VELA´ ZQUEZ and her staff for working 
with me and with my staff on this leg-
islation, as well as many other pieces 
of legislation in the past. 
On this specific bill, we were able to 
negotiate a couple of changes that 
made the bill slightly more palatable 
for those of us on this side of the aisle, 
and that would have not happened 
without the chairwoman’s leadership, 
so we do appreciate that. 
That said, philosophically, it is ex-
ceptionally difficult for me and others 
on this side of the aisle to accept the 
bill in its entirety. For instance, I am 
a firm believer that small businesses 
are just that, small businesses; and as 
long as they qualify under the Small 
Business Act and the SBA size stand-
ards, no one small business ought to 
have to do anything different under the 
law than any other small business. 
In addition to all the burdensome re-
porting requirements this legislation 
would impose on small businesses, 
there are two specific provisions that 
are difficult for us to support. 
First, the bill we have before us at-
tempts to name—and some would say, 
shame—businesses that are recent PPP 
loan recipients above $2 million. And I 
do appreciate Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ 
going from $250,000 to $2 million. 
These businesses—at least the ones 
that acted in good faith—followed the 
law and the guidelines and received 
their loans based on the best informa-
tion available at that time, and I do 
not 
believe 
that 
those 
businesses 
should be put on public display for po-
tential shaming. 
If they didn’t follow the rules, we 
have remedies for calling them out, 
such as the SBA’s Office of the Inspec-
tor General, even the Department of 
Justice, to seek out waste, fraud, and 
abuse. Publicly naming them will do 
little to increase transparency or any-
thing else, for that matter, we believe. 
Second, the bill requires, albeit vol-
untarily, small businesses to disclose 
whether they are economically dis-
advantaged, minority owned, women 
owned, or veteran owned. As I men-
tioned previously, I believe we ought to 
be making regulatory burdens fewer 
and farther between, not imposing 
more paperwork that doesn’t help any 
business fight this pandemic. 
Again, Mr. Speaker, I reluctantly op-
pose this legislation but again thank 
the chairwoman for her leadership and 
willingness to work with us on these 
bills and on many issues facing Amer-
ica’s small businesses moving forward. 
Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield as much time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. 
PHILLIPS), the sponsor of the bill. 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Chairwoman VELA´ ZQUEZ for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk 
about truth. 
Now, you would think that truth 
would not be up for debate in this 
Chamber, yet here we stand literally

debating my bill, the TRUTH Act, 
which simply injects transparency and 
accountability into the very largest ex-
penditure of taxpayer money in Amer-
ican history. 
That is it. There is no hidden agenda, 
just a straightforward requirement for 
the Small Business Administration to 
publish information about how Federal 
relief dollars are flowing and where 
they are going. And that truth should 
be important to every American: busi-
ness owners and patrons, bankers and 
borrowers, Republicans and Democrats. 
We cannot accept a situation in 
which bigger businesses with access to 
other sources of liquidity are pushing 
to the front of the line at the expense 
of those with the greatest need, par-
ticularly minority-, women-, and vet-
eran-owned businesses that are strug-
gling the very most during the pan-
demic. 
I won’t accept it. 
I am on a mission to restore Ameri-
cans’ faith in their government. But 
trust is earned by action, not by words. 
So I ask my colleagues to join me in 
supporting the TRUTH Act, in allowing 
the American people to see where their 
money is going and in ensuring that 
businesses that need relief the most are 
getting it. 
They say that sunlight is the best 
disinfectant, and we could surely use 
more of it here. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself the balance of my time. I want 
to thank the gentlewoman from New 
York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) on her leader-
ship, and I regret that we cannot sup-
port this particular piece of legisla-
tion; however, I am certain that we 
will continue to work together in a bi-
partisan manner to address the needs 
of America’s small businesses. 
I would note, just in response, brief-
ly, to the gentleman’s mention that 
this is called the TRUTH Act, just be-
cause something is called the TRUTH 
Act doesn’t necessarily mean that it is 
the truth, just like something called 
the Affordable Care Act doesn’t nec-
essarily mean it is going to make 
healthcare more affordable. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, when this body spent 
trillions of dollars to address the eco-
nomic downturn brought about by 
COVID–19, we included a special inspec-
tor general to provide oversight over 
the expenditure of these dollars. Unfor-
tunately, President Trump said the 
special IG could not issue reports to 
Congress without Presidential super-
vision and subsequently removed the 
acting IG at the Pentagon and chair-
man of the panel. 
So with the erosion of account-
ability, transparency is needed more 
than ever. Congress needs to ensure 
that there is no waste, fraud, or abuse 
of taxpayers’ dollars. 
b 1000 
This 
data 
collection 
and 
trans-
parency bill is a positive step in that 
direction, 
providing 
much-needed 
transparency 
and 
accountability. 
Knowledge is power and, with this bill, 
the public will finally have the knowl-
edge on how these programs have been 
implemented, where the money has 
gone, who has gotten it and who hasn’t. 
Not only will this empower the peo-
ple, it will empower Congress as we 
continue 
working 
to 
optimize 
the 
CARES Act programs. 
The bill also clarifies the program 
accounts for the Paycheck Protection 
Program and the 7(a) Loan Program 
are wholly distinct, ensuring that the 
SBA’s flagship lending program will 
not shut down when the Paycheck Pro-
tection Program appropriation lapses. 
As the small business economy be-
gins to recover in the coming weeks 
and months, small businesses need to 
be able to access affordable capital to 
rehire workers, restock their shelves, 
and resume operations. This language 
ensures the 7(a) program will be an op-
tion for them in the next phase of re-
covery. 
I urge my colleagues to support this 
measure, and I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
strong support of H.R. 6782, the Small Busi-
ness Transparency and Reporting for the 
Underbanked and Taxpayers at Home Act or 
TRUTH Act, which directs the Small Business 
Administration (SBA) to explain and justify all 
disbursements of coronavirus relief funds, en-
suring transparency and accountability from 
this critical agency. 
Together, the CARES Act and the Payroll 
Protection Program and Health Care Enhance-
ment Act together allocated more than $2 tril-
lion to address the devastating coronavirus 
pandemic, the most expensive relief package 
ever authorized by Congress, and the largest 
outlay of taxpayer funds in all human history. 
The stakes simply are too high to allow irre-
sponsible stewardship, and those charged with 
disbursing coronavirus relief funds must be 
held to the highest standards and held to ac-
count for misfeasance or malfeasance. 
Mr. Speaker, it is wholly unacceptable that 
the SBA has not to date provided full trans-
parency over its administration of the Payroll 
Protection Program (PPP) and Economic In-
jury Disaster Loan Program (EIDL). 
PPP and EIDL were created by Congress to 
provide relief for small businesses affected by 
the pandemic, and more than $700 billion has 
been allocated in service of those goals. 
However, in too many cases the programs 
did not function as Congress intended, and 
large organizations such as the Los Angeles 
Lakers received funding while many of our 
smallest and most vulnerable businesses were 
unable to secure assistance. 
In light of this mismanagement, it is impera-
tive that SBA be subject to an exhaustive 
audit of its handling of PPP and EIDL funding. 
The agency has refused to do so voluntarily, 
requiring Congress to mandate compliance 
from the agency that exists to serve small 
business, the backbone of the American econ-
omy. 
The TRUTH Act would require the SBA to 
make the following information publicly avail-
able in an online, searchable, sortable, and 
downloadable format within 30 days of pas-
sage: 
1. The identity of every recipient of a grant 
or loan that was funded by the CARES Act or 
the Payroll Protection Program and Health 
Care Enhancement Act; 
2. An explanation of the SBA’s decision- 
making process; 
3. The number of employees at the entity in 
question; 
4. The date when the grant or loan was dis-
bursed; 
5. The identification number of the bank or 
lender that administered the grant or loan; and 
6. The amount of assistance provided to 
small businesses owned by socially and eco-
nomically disadvantaged individuals, women, 
and veterans. 
Mr. Speaker, the COVID–19 pandemic has 
challenged us in ways we could have scarcely 
imagined; it has claimed lives and destroyed 
livelihoods all across our nation. 
We are in this together and we will come 
out stronger and better. 
And we do that by caring for each other and 
rendering equal, justice and fairness, whether 
it is in the area of coronavirus testing, distribu-
tion of PPE, or economic assistance. 
Our small businesses need help and they 
need the truth, which is why I urge my col-
leagues to join me in voting to pass H.R. 
6782, the TRUTH Act. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 6782, as 
amended. 
The question was taken. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the 
opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being 
in the affirmative, the ayes have it. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, on that I de-
mand the yeas and nays.

ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered. 
Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, fur-
ther proceedings on this question are

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to the rule, the gentlewoman from 
New York (Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ) and the 
gentleman from Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) 
each will control 20 minutes. 
The Chair recognizes the gentle-
woman from New York. 
GENERAL LEAVE 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask 
unanimous consent that all Members 
may have 5 legislative days in which to 
revise and extend their remarks and in-
clude extraneous material on the meas-
ure under consideration. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there 
objection to the request of the gentle-
woman from New York? 
There was no objection. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I rise in support of the bipartisan bill 
before us today, H.R. 7010, the Pay-
check Protection Program Flexibility 
Act of 2020. 
We all knew the rollout of the Pay-
check Protection Program was going 
to be rocky, given the size of the pro-
gram and the speed with which it was 
stood up. 
We are thankful for the staff at SBA 
for their hard work assisting small 
businesses during this dire time. This 
is, undoubtedly, the most enormous 
undertaking the agency has ever per-
formed. They have done so under dif-
ficult circumstances and remarkably 
quickly. 
With that said, my colleagues and I 
have been hearing from Main Street 
small 
businesses 
that 
they 
need 
changes to make the program work for 
them. 
I think we can all agree the economic 
crisis brought on by COVID–19 has 
proven more severe and drawn out than 
many anticipated. In some cases, State 
and local governments have extended 
shutdowns and stay-at-home orders. 
Many localities are only now allowing 
small businesses to reopen, very gradu-
ally, in phases. 
In other instances, small business 
owners have reported concerns that the 
economy will not fully recover until 
there is an affordable, widely acces-
sible COVID–19 vaccine. 
Regardless, the extended nature of 
the economic downturn has made it 
necessary to enact certain legislative 
reforms to the program. 
First, we need to give borrowers 
more than 8 weeks to use the funds in 
order to qualify for loan forgiveness. 
Borrowers who took out PPP loans 
early in the program are about to 
reach the end of their 8-week period 
governing forgiveness. However, mil-
lions of small businesses across the Na-
tion are still facing forced closures. 
Those that are reopening are re-
quired to do so in an extremely limited 
manner, with only outdoor dining or 
curbside-only pickup at retail stores. 
Those restrictions mean small busi-
nesses continue to have a tough road 
ahead, and they need flexibility in how 
they use this emergency capital. This 
provision will give them that. 
The bill triples the current 8-week 
period in which businesses must use 
funds to be eligible for forgiveness to 24 
weeks. That will help ensure businesses 
have more room to breathe, even in 
places where reopening of the economy 
happens more slowly. 
Second, we must extend the program 
through the end of the year. The unpre-
dictable spread of the virus, shortage of 
widespread testing, and lack of a vac-
cine mean that we do not know exactly 
when the small business sector will 
fully reopen and, when it does, how the 
‘‘new normal’’ will look. 
The bill addresses a challenge that 
was created when the first set of guide-
lines were issued. We have heard you

May 28, 2020 
loud and clear. Today’s legislation 
strikes a balance between protecting 
workers by guaranteeing loans are used 
for payroll, with the need to recognize 
that many independent restaurants 
face difficulty paying rent and utili-
ties. 
The new 60/40 ratio makes certain a 
business can remain open, weather the 
crisis, continue employing workers, 
and keep serving their local commu-
nities. Congress must revamp this pro-
gram to make it more accessible for 
small employers to weather the uncer-
tainty ahead. 
We simply do not know if there will 
be another wave of infections or addi-
tional lockdowns. This bill provides 
certainty to employers afraid to use 
their loan proceeds or reluctant to 
apply to the program by providing 
much-needed flexibility. 
I applaud my colleagues, Mr. PHIL-
LIPS and Mr. ROY, for working together 
in a bipartisan manner to craft com-
monsense solutions for America’s small 
businesses. I thank Ranking Member 
CHABOT for his assistance in crafting 
this bipartisan measure. 
I urge all my colleagues to vote 
‘‘yes,’’ and I reserve the balance of my 
time. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Unlike the previous bill, I am happy 
to say that I agree with the chair-
woman, and I rise in strong support of 
H.R. 7010, the Paycheck Protection 
Program Flexibility Act of 2020, as 
amended. 
I would, again, like to thank Chair-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ for conducting this 
process in such a bipartisan manner. It 
is more important than ever to main-
tain our strong bilateral negotiations 
as we continue to combat the spread of 
COVID–19 and its devastating, abso-
lutely devastating, effect on our econ-
omy, especially our small businesses in 
that economy. 
Over the past 3 months, I have been 
in contact with literally thousands of 
small businesses, not only in my home-
town of Cincinnati, but across the 
country. I have joined dozens of con-
ference calls with my congressional 
colleagues and with their constituents 
and mine all the way from the State of 
Washington to the State of Florida, 
and just about everywhere in between. 
There has been broad consensus dur-
ing those interactions that the PPP 
program has served as a lifeline for 
small businesses and their employees, 
many of whom have been shut down 
through no fault of their own. 
By and large, it would be hard to 
argue against the fact that the PPP 
program has, for the most part, been 
successful. Over 4 million small busi-
nesses have received a PPP loan thus 
far, allowing them to hang on as the 
COVID–19 pandemic spread across our 
Nation. 
Of course, there have been some 
shortcomings, some unintended con-
sequences. That will happen when you 
do 6 months of legislative work in 6 
days. That is why we are here today, to 
fix 
some 
of 
the 
unintended 
con-
sequences. 
For example, when we crafted the 
original CARES Act back in March, the 
covered period was defined as 8 weeks. 
The true emergency period has evolved 
over time. This bill begins to address 
that. 
To fix the miscalculation in how long 
this pandemic would last, this bill ex-
tends the 8-week original covered pe-
riod to 24 weeks and creates an option 
allowing businesses that want to stay 
within the original 8-week window to 
do so. This promotes greater flexibility 
for small businesses to decide when it 
is best to start spending their PPP 
loan. 
It is important to remember that 
this change isn’t as simple as moving a 
few dates around. There are a lot of un-
intended consequences that we need to 
account for because more than 4 mil-
lion loans have already gone through 
the program in the amount of half a 
trillion dollars. 
First, the original CARES Act allows 
principal, interest, and fees to be de-
ferred for between 6 and 12 months. The 
administration adjusted this deferment 
period to just 6 months through guid-
ance. 
This deferment time period needed to 
be shifted to ensure a business knows 
its loan forgiveness amount before its 
deferment period concludes. This bill 
accomplishes that by extending the 
deferment window to end once the SBA 
makes the forgiveness payment to the 
lender on the borrower’s behalf. 
Second, the bill amends the 75/25 rule 
which was inserted into the PPP by the 
administration through guidance to re-
quire 75 percent of the loan to be used 
on payroll costs and 25 percent to be 
used on mortgage interest, rent, and 
utilities. So that is what the previous 
rule called for, 75/25. 
This bill replaced that with a 60/40 
split to, again, give small businesses 
greater flexibility as to how to best 
utilize their PPP funds. 
Third, the bill extends the 2-year ma-
turity of the loan to a 5-year maturity 
for new loans to help small businesses 
struggling to make their payments in a 
weakened 
economy. 
Loans 
already 
processed remain at the 2-year matu-
rity rate so that there is no retro-
activity in this provision. 
The bill makes clear that small busi-
nesses and lenders are free to negotiate 
modifications in the maturity terms if 
they both agree. Again, both have to 
agree, both the borrower or the small 
business and the lender. 
Fourth, the bill allows businesses 
that receive PPP loan forgiveness to 
also receive their employer payroll tax 
deferment. 
And that was a big issue. Many of the 
small businesses were concerned that 
they were losing one of the advantages 
that was in the original PPP program 
in the CARES Act. So this is back in. 
They will be able to take that business 
deduction from their taxes. 
Fifth, the bill also codifies the rehire 
flexibility provision. So as long as a 
good-faith offer to return to work is 
provided to a recently laid off worker, 
the business will satisfy the head count 
requirements. 
This safe harbor provision attempts 
to address the challenges many small 
businesses have had getting some em-
ployees to return to work with the $600 
Federal unemployment check per week 
on top of the State unemployment 
checks which they are also receiving. 
Finally, the bill establishes a new 
safe harbor to account for businesses 
that are required by civil authority to 
open only at 50 percent capacity. This 
ensures that businesses that have no 
choice but to run at half capacity are 
not left behind by their counterparts 
who have the ability to operate fully. 
So it is a fairness issue. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to 
support this much-needed bipartisan 
bill that provides real solutions to 
American small businesses facing this 
very difficult situation. 
b 1015 
Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank 
the chairwoman for working on this on 
a bipartisan basis. 
This 
flexibility 
allows 
America’s 
small businesses to go a long way to 
addressing many of the concerns that 
we heard time and time again from 
small businesses all across the country. 
They need to have the flexibility to 
spend the money most efficiently so 
that the businesses can actually stay 
afloat, make it through this pandemic, 
and, most importantly, be able to keep 
as many of their employees on the pay-
roll so that they are able to support 
their families as possible. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my col-
leagues to support this legislation on 
both sides of the aisle, and I reserve 
the balance of my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from 
Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS). 
Mr. PHILLIPS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
Representative 
VELA´ ZQUEZ; 
Ranking 
Member CHABOT; my colleague, Mr. 
ROY from Texas, who has spent a lot of 
time in the political foxhole with me 
from the very beginning of this initia-
tive; and all who have helped get the 
Paycheck Protection Program Flexi-
bility Act to the floor. 
But I want to spend my time today 
letting my constituents speak for 
themselves. For more than 43 years, 
Minnesotans have celebrated birthdays 
and Little League wins over burgers 
and cheese curds at Lions Tap, a fam-
ily-owned restaurant in Eden Prairie, 
Minnesota, until COVID–19 changed ev-
erything. My team spoke with Bert, 
owner of Lions Tap, and when we asked 
for feedback about his experience with 
the Payroll Protection Program, he 
said this: ‘‘We definitely need the PPP. 
The problem is that because our busi-
ness is a restaurant, we are not able to 
open it up fully where we could hire 
our entire staff back under the condi-
tions of the loan. It is imperative that

we are allowed forgiveness for expenses 
beyond the original 8-week period. We 
also need to loosen up the restrictions 
of nonpayroll expenses beyond the 25 
percent. The complexities of balancing 
staying open or closing will be deter-
mined by what the government will be 
able to change on the PPP in this bill.’’ 
Bert is not alone. On a Zoom call last 
month, a barber who rents a chair in a 
Brooklyn Park barber salon told me 
exactly the same thing. I also talked 
with Mike, who owns a few hotels in 
Minnesota and is being forced to make 
lose-lose decisions about how to pay 
his employees and his mortgage while 
their rooms sit empty. 
Mike said this: ‘‘The government 
stepped in with the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, but it was a one-size- 
fits-all approach that didn’t really help 
industries like hospitality. We could 
pay our employees but not our mort-
gages. The Paycheck Protection Flexi-
bility Act will do for small businesses 
what the PPP could not.’’ 
John from Maple Grove, who owns a 
handful of beloved wood-fired pizza 
joints in Minnesota, is also feeling the 
heat from a lengthening crisis. He told 
me: ‘‘We are very appreciative of the 
PPP loan we received but would have 
no way to qualify for any material for-
giveness given the impossibility of re-
hiring our entire workforce while our 
stores are closed. If the loan is not for-
given, we do not foresee our business 
returning to any meaningful positive 
cash flow until a vaccine is developed 
or the virus impact weakens and would 
likely not have funds to repay any loan 
principal in that time.’’ 
Justin, who has a small gym in 
Chanhassen, 
and 
Ryan, 
who 
owns 
Frenchies nail salon, are reporting the 
exact same problems. The outpouring 
of feedback has been as clear as it has 
been enormous. 
Mr. Speaker, today is not about us. It 
is not about which side secures the big-
gest win or who gets the credit. It is 
about delivering the relief that small 
business owners across Minnesota and 
this Nation are asking for. It is about 
doing our job. 
At its core, representation begins 
with listening, and these stories paint 
a very clear picture. Our small business 
owners, the institutions of our Main 
Streets and the glue of our commu-
nities, are asking us to take action to 
solve problems and to engage in some 
good old-fashioned teamwork. 
I am grateful to my colleague, Mr. 
CHIP ROY from Texas, for joining me in 
that very spirit as the coauthor of this 
bill and to the growing coalition of 
support that we built around the Pay-
check Protection Flexibility Act. This 
bill will help people in the ways that 
they need, and we have not a moment 
to lose. 
Mr. Speaker, if you don’t want to 
take my word for it, just listen to the 
millions of our country’s shopkeepers, 
innovators, entrepreneurs, and small 
business owners all around the coun-
try. Or listen to our 11 million res-
taurant employees. Or just take it 
from Bert, the owner of Lions Tap, who 
said that the heartbeat of America is 
small business, and we need your help 
to survive. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
commend and thank the gentleman 
from Texas (Mr. ROY) and the gen-
tleman from Minnesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) 
for working together in a bipartisan 
manner on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY). 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the 
chairwoman and the ranking member 
for their leadership. I really want to 
give a strong statement of support and 
thanks to my colleague, DEAN PHIL-
LIPS, for the way in which our offices 
have worked together and in which he 
and I have worked together on this. I 
have nothing but positive things to say 
about him, and I look forward to work-
ing on other measures to get, frankly, 
this body back to the work of the 
American people and to make Congress 
work again, to use a phrase that might 
be interesting. But we need to make 
Congress work again for the American 
people. 
This is a simple bill. It is a seven- 
page bill. We need more of that, more 
single-subject bills that we can wrap 
our hands around and move through 
the Chamber in ways that will impact 
American people’s lives without things 
being decided by a handful of people in 
back rooms that cost trillions of dol-
lars and have 2,000 and 3,000 pages. 
That is a statement, frankly, on both 
sides of the aisle. We need to find a way 
to work together, to have simple ap-
proaches to do the work of the Amer-
ican people. 
This piece of legislation, in par-
ticular, is important to me because I 
represent about 2,300 restaurants and 
about 53,000 employees who work there 
in central Texas. It is the most in 
Texas. It has to be pretty high up na-
tionwide. Austin, Texas, and San Anto-
nio, Texas, both have a great number 
of live music venues, as they are fa-
mously known, and my wife and I have 
availed ourselves of them over our 
lives. 
In fact, my courtship of my wife 
began in a lot of these places. Our first 
date was at Stubb’s Bar-B-Q in Austin, 
Texas, a great institution for a Willie 
Nelson 
concert. 
We 
were 
at 
Threadgill’s for our rehearsal dinner in 
South Austin, Texas, with live music. 
I represent the Broken Spoke. I rep-
resent Luckenbach, Texas, if you re-
member the famous song. I represent a 
number of great restaurants in San An-
tonio. The Cortez family has a bunch of 
restaurants in San Antonio. Many of 
you, if you have been on the River 
Walk or have been in downtown San 
Antonio, would have experienced these 
places. They are a part of the culture 
of our lives, our fabric of what we do 
every day when we visit with our fami-
lies and our communities. 
We need to save these great institu-
tions and not just restaurants. I am 
talking about the barbershops, the hair 
salons, the live music venues, and the 
hotels that are struggling. 
I just talked to a hotel operator an 
hour ago, just before coming down here 
to the floor, who is struggling and said: 
Look, I can’t make it 8 weeks. I can’t 
stay alive. I don’t have enough heads 
on the pillows. We are working toward 
reopening. 
These are real businesses with real 
employees and real lives tied up into 
this who are struggling. 
The thing is, the PPP program has 
been a great success in getting $650 bil-
lion out the door in a matter of weeks 
to help almost 4 million businesses, as 
has been noted on the floor, and that is 
awesome. That is fantastic. We should 
be proud of that. But as we work to get 
America open again, we have to be 
mindful of the fact that times are con-
tinuing to move on. These businesses 
are struggling, and they can’t meet 
some of these restrictions and dead-
lines. 
I will note a little moment of par-
tisanship perhaps, in that I believe the 
unemployment 
insurance 
provision 
that was adopted is actually the root of 
the problem because you can’t pay peo-
ple more not to work than to work and 
then expect businesses to go back and 
rehire people to meet the requirements 
we put in the bill to meet and hold peo-
ple in employment in the businesses. 
We need to address that. I hope that as 
a body we will not extend that when it 
expires in July. This is something I 
think is fundamentally important. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
time of the gentleman has expired. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
the gentleman from Texas an addi-
tional 30 seconds. 
Mr. ROY. Mr. Speaker, one thing I 
want to point out here is that the 
ranking member and the chair have 
gone through the provisions in the bill. 
This is an important vote because we 
have to do this to help small busi-
nesses, but it is an important vote be-
cause I think it gets back to the heart 
of simple legislating and working to-
gether to accomplish things. 
Let’s provide the flexibility for busi-
nesses. Let’s make sure that we let 
America open. But let’s work together 
to solve the problems of the American 
people together, like Mr. PHILLIPS and 
I did. I am proud to cosponsor this with 
him. 
Mr. Speaker, I hope the Senate will 
take this up and move it expeditiously 
so that we can help businesses this 
week. There is no reason to delay that. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
would like to inquire of the Chair how 
much time is remaining on each side. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tlewoman from New York has 111⁄2 min-
utes remaining. The gentleman from 
Ohio has 10 minutes remaining. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
New Hampshire (Mr. PAPPAS). 
Mr. PAPPAS. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the chairwoman for yielding.

Mr. Speaker, while the Paycheck 
Protection Program has provided a 
lifeline to small businesses, funda-
mental changes must be made to meet 
the ongoing needs of our Main Street 
economy. 
I am thankful to have heard from 
hundreds of local business leaders in 
my district who have helped identify 
critical shortcomings in the PPP. 
RoseAnn in Laconia tells us her res-
taurant’s sales are down 90 percent, 
and she needs more time than 8 weeks 
to ramp up safely. 
David from Portsmouth says his 
overhead costs are much higher than 
the payroll at his new business, and he 
needs more flexibility in how he can 
spend down the loan. 
Hillary from Goffstown won’t begin 
to make up for lost sales in her wed-
ding business until next year. A longer 
term will give her a more stable finan-
cial footing. 
There are millions of stories like 
these across the country. 
I want to thank my colleagues for 
coming together on a bipartisan basis 
to understand the need that is out 
there and helping to meet it with this 
comprehensive bill that is going to pro-
vide a lifeline to our local businesses. 
The fixes in this Paycheck Protection 
Flexibility Act will allow our small 
businesses and their dedicated employ-
ees to continue to survive. Let’s pass 
this bipartisan bill today for our work-
ers, for our small businesses, and cer-
tainly for our future. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Michi-
gan (Mr. UPTON). 
Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, I want to 
particularly thank Mr. PHILLIPS and 
Mr. ROY for working together on this 
important legislation. 
When the President signed the Pay-
check Protection Program nearly 2 
months ago, it provided a real lifeline 
to our small businesses, without a 
doubt. We have had some pretty rough 
seas, a typhoon. But at the end of the 
day, after 8 weeks, Mr. Speaker, if you 
were a small business and you allo-
cated 75 percent of the money that you 
received as that loan for employees’ 
salaries, healthcare, et cetera, that 
loan would become a grant; and the re-
sponse was overwhelming. A $250 bil-
lion program was exhausted after 10 
days. 
After we came back and did another 
job, we doubled down. We gave it an-
other $310 billion on top of that. Unbe-
lievable. 
As much as all of us wanted this 
nightmare to end by Easter, we are 
now past Memorial Day, and those 
small businesses are still not open. 
Many of them are still shuttered, and 
they can’t possibly meet that 75 per-
cent standard that their lender, their 
community bank, or their credit union 
offered them to be able to convert that 
loan to a grant. 
So, without the changes in this bi-
partisan bill, that program instead will 
be an anchor that will take them down 
to the very bottom. We can’t let that 
happen, no way. 
The bipartisan Problem Solvers Cau-
cus endorsed this flexibility bill. It is 
one that we need to get done. I hope 
that the Senate can take what we do 
today and pass it before the end of the 
week. We need to provide that relief to 
our small businesses and the millions 
of employees that it impacts. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Colorado (Mr. NEGUSE). 
Mr. NEGUSE. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
today in support of the bills before the 
House. 
In Colorado, our small businesses are 
struggling under these unprecedented 
economic 
circumstances. 
From 
the 
mom-and-pop taverns in Gilpin County 
and Winter Park; the restaurants in 
Loveland, Fort Collins, and Boulder; 
Main Street businesses in Nederland 
and Breckenridge; and the many Colo-
rado businesses that rely on outdoor 
recreation and ski season, in par-
ticular, they never could have planned 
for this pandemic. We cannot expect 
them to weather this crisis alone. 
The Payroll Protection Program has 
provided critical funds to keep many of 
these businesses afloat and workers 
employed. But as we have heard from 
both sides of the aisle today, many 
fixes are needed, and that is what we 
are here today to do. 
We must ensure that loan forgiveness 
periods are extended so that small 
businesses are not on the hook for this 
money while their doors remain shut. 
We must extend the program past June 
30 as so many of our businesses face in-
creased uncertainty and as our country 
faces uncertainty about what the fu-
ture holds in the coming months. We 
must expand access and transparency 
and prioritize our veteran-owned and 
economically 
disadvantaged 
busi-
nesses. 
At the end of the day, we must con-
tinue to support our local small busi-
nesses because they are the lifeblood of 
our communities, for the sake of our 
families, our local economies, and our 
future. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman 
for her strong leadership over the 
course of this pandemic and my fresh-
man colleague, Representative PHIL-
LIPS, for his leadership in bringing this 
bill forward. I am proud to support it. 
Let’s get this done for small businesses 
in Colorado and across America. 
b 1030 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Lou-
isiana (Mr. GRAVES). 
Mr. 
GRAVES 
of 
Louisiana. 
Mr. 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman from 
Ohio (Mr. CHABOT) for his hard work; 
and I thank the chairwoman, as well, 
for working together in a bipartisan 
manner. 
But most importantly, I thank the 
gentleman from Texas (Mr. ROY), my 
friend, for working together, for identi-
fying the problems with the Paycheck 
Protection Program, in helping to per-
fect this program that is an incredible 
lifeline to small businesses and, impor-
tantly, Mr. Speaker, to the employees. 
Millions and millions of businesses, 
billions of dollars in loans in a program 
that didn’t even exist. Within 1 week, 
they stood this program up, and within 
2 weeks, Mr. Speaker, handed out more 
money than the SBA had done over the 
previous 14 years. It is absolutely re-
markable what Treasury and SBA have 
done with this program. 
And, as I said, the work that Mr. ROY 
and Mr. PHILLIPS have done to come to-
gether on a bipartisan basis to help to 
fix, to provide flexibility to businesses, 
to give them more time, to give them 
more flexibility on the use of funds, to 
ensure that these businesses aren’t just 
open for 8 weeks but are truly sustain-
able businesses that can continue pro-
viding employment to millions and 
millions of Americans for years to 
come. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, I want to pivot. 
The other legislation, the TRUTH Act, 
Mr. Speaker, looking at the compari-
son of numbers, here we are giving out 
billions of dollars and millions of 
loans, looking at the Economic Injury 
Disaster Loan Program, the EIDL loan 
program. This program is a complete 
disaster itself. The program is not get-
ting money out the door. Whoever is 
running this program needs to be re-
placed. 
Look at the statistics. They brought 
in an outside contractor to do the ad-
vances. The advances are taking off, 
but the loans, themselves, are not. We 
are not offering operating expenses and 
other needed loans to these small busi-
nesses. 
This bill doesn’t fix a single problem 
that is out there that is delaying, that 
is preventing this program from actu-
ally providing operating expense assist-
ance to these small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is a complete 
whiff. I urge that we pull back the 
TRUTH Act. Rescind it. Let’s sit back 
down again and work together on a bi-
partisan basis, as we have done on this 
bill, on the PPP Flex bill, and provide 
true solutions to where the Economic 
Injury Disaster Loan Program can help 
these small businesses, can truly pro-
vide a hand up. 
Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of that 
bill. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentleman from 
New Jersey (Mr. GOTTHEIMER). 
Mr. GOTTHEIMER. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her excel-
lent leadership. I thank Mr. ROY for his 
great bipartisan work and my dear 
friend, colleague, and fellow problem 
solver, DEAN PHILLIPS, for his remark-
able leadership on this important piece 
of legislation. He did it the way he be-
lieves we all should govern, and that is 
working across the aisle. I am grateful 
for what he did on the Paycheck Pro-
tection Flexibility Act, which was sup-
ported by the Problem Solvers Caucus, 
50 strong—25 Democrats and 25 Repub-
licans.

Mr. Speaker, I have heard over and 
over again from businesses in my com-
munity in northern New Jersey that 
they are so grateful for the PPP Loan 
Forgiveness Program and all of the 
jobs and businesses it helps protect. 
But they need more flexibility with the 
formula and timeframe. They need 
more time with the loan and more 
flexibility on how to spend it, from sal-
aries to rent. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud that this bi-
partisan legislation does exactly that: 
helps the 131,000 small businesses in 
New Jersey that have been helped by 
the PPP Loan Forgiveness Program. 
And I am equally grateful for the bi-
partisan TRUTH Act, which demands 
more transparency and accountability 
for every single dollar that is loaned 
out from the Small Business Adminis-
tration to our businesses. I am glad 
that that legislation will pass here 
later today and that we will know 
where all the loans have gone. 
Mr. Speaker, New Jersey’s economy, 
including all of our small businesses, 
want to make sure their businesses can 
stay open at the end of this pandemic. 
They want to keep their workers. They 
want to keep giving back to our com-
munities. They want to grow their 
businesses and give back to our great 
State. But they need our help. This bill 
does that, and I am hoping the Senate 
acts quickly to take it up. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Ten-
nessee (Mr. BURCHETT), a very impor-
tant member of the Committee on 
Small Business. 
Mr. 
BURCHETT. 
Mr. 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encour-
age my colleagues to vote in favor of 
the H.R. 7010, the Paycheck Protection 
Program Flexibility Act. 
America’s economic recovery from 
the coronavirus pandemic depends on 
getting individuals comfortable with 
safely going back to workplaces, shops, 
and restaurants. H.R. 7010 represents a 
continued commitment to providing 
economic 
assistance 
to 
America’s 
small businesses while our economy 
works towards this goal. 
Throughout east Tennessee, the Pay-
check Protection Program is ensuring 
employers can pay their workers and 
cover operating expenses. H.R. 7010 will 
allow greater flexibility for this relief 
by extending the PPP loan forgiveness 
period from 8 to 24 weeks, eliminating 
duplicative program requirements, and 
providing small businesses with addi-
tional time to pay back loans as they 
get back on their feet. 
Members of the Committee on Small 
Business have a strong reputation of 
reaching across the aisle to work to-
gether, and I applaud the efforts of Mr. 
ROY and Mr. PHILLIPS to craft clean 
legislation that meets the needs of 
small businesses. 
Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support 
this bill that delivers results for Amer-
ica’s small businesses during this dif-
ficult time. It is great to see Chair-
woman VELA´ ZQUEZ
and the ranking 
member, and I thank them for their 
leadership. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman 
from Texas (Ms. JACKSON LEE). 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I 
thank the chairwoman for her leader-
ship with the ranking member, Mr. 
PHILLIPS and Mr. ROY. 
Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong sup-
port because 100,000 people are dead. 
Small businesses are living in the 
midst of those communities of devasta-
tion, but they are trying to keep their 
doors open so they can help their fel-
low citizens. 
I am grateful that we will allow an 
extended period of time, 24 weeks, for 
allowing for forgiveness. I am very 
grateful we have extended the date, for 
extending the program to December 31, 
and, of course, the payment, the loan 
period to 5 years. 
I know the mom-and-pop barbershops 
and cosmetology shops and nail shops 
and restaurants; they are crying out to 
survive. Some of their very workers 
have died. They are taking care of fam-
ilies. And so to ensure the full access 
to payroll tax deferment for business 
tax, that takes PPP loans. 
In addition, I support the TRUTH Act 
because the money that we give must 
be used right, and transparency on who 
gets the loans is important. 
Mr. Speaker, this further relief for 
small businesses is well placed because 
they are the anchor of the economy. 
I say to Houston small businesses: 
We are coming to help you. We will be 
speaking to you this week. 
Mr. Speaker, I support this bill, and 
we should move this forward as quickly 
as possible. They are the anchor of the 
economy of this Nation. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 
minutes to the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. MEUSER). 
Mr. MEUSER. Mr. Speaker, I thank 
the gentleman from Ohio very much. 
Mr. Speaker, the Paycheck Protec-
tion Program, as we have been hearing, 
has provided critical support to small 
businesses across the country during 
this crisis. 
The intent of the PPP was to prevent 
layoffs, maintain certainty for work-
ers, and help businesses weather the 
challenges posed by the coronavirus 
pandemic. 
Thanks 
to 
President 
Trump’s 
Treasury 
Department 
and 
other leaders in this body, whom I 
commend, the program’s results were 
in line with the program’s intent. 
Thanks, as well, to the SBA and 
many community banks. Over 4.5 mil-
lion small businesses have been ap-
proved for loans through the PPP, and 
over $600 billion in loans have been 
processed. 
The 
PPP 
has 
administered 
over 
155,000 loans, totaling $25 billion in 
Pennsylvania alone. Nationwide, near-
ly 65 percent of these loans have been 
under $50,000—remarkable to see re-
sults of a bill in line with its intent. 
However, we all do know—and we 
have been hearing from our constitu-
ents—that many businesses have not 
been able to reopen or access the loans 
amidst many various State govern-
ment-mandated shutdowns, so addi-
tional time and flexibility to use the 
PPP funds will help them meet payroll 
and remain in operation as we safely 
and responsibly reopen our economy. 
Today’s Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram Flexibility Act will enact effec-
tive reforms which were created with 
input from small businesses. Again, I 
strongly commend the bill’s sponsors 
for engaging in this way. 
Mr. Speaker, families are the heart of 
our communities. Small businesses are 
the backbones of our economy. Our 
families and our small businesses, with 
our support, will make it through this 
crisis and drive the next great Amer-
ican comeback. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a ‘‘yes’’ 
vote on this very important bill. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, may I in-
quire how much time is remaining. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from Ohio has 3 minutes re-
maining. 
Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I yield 
myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentle-
woman 
from 
New 
York 
(Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) for her cooperation and 
Mr. ROY and Mr. PHILLIPS, as well, for 
working together in a bipartisan man-
ner on this important legislation. 
COVID–19, the coronavirus, has had a 
tremendous impact, an adverse impact 
on our Nation, particularly on our Na-
tion’s economy, particularly on Amer-
ica’s small businesses. Many of them, 
unfortunately, have had to shut down 
during this time. 
When 
we 
originally 
passed 
the 
CARES Act, which included the Pay-
check Protection Program—or now it 
has become so popular, now it is PPP. 
It is known by that by millions of 
small businesses all across the country. 
We didn’t know exactly how long the 
pandemic would last. We still don’t 
know, for that matter. So 8 weeks, for 
example, was the period of time that 
determined the payouts and whether 
the loan would be forgiven or not, 
whether in fact it would be a grant, 
whether these small businesses would 
have to pay it back. 
As it turned out, 8 weeks, alone, isn’t 
a sufficient period of time for many 
small businesses. This legislation ex-
tends that to 24 weeks, at the option of 
the borrower. So this will allow many 
small businesses all across the country 
to see what benefits them the most so 
they can survive, so they can keep 
their employees employed so they can 
support their families. So that is an 
important item that is in this legisla-
tion. 
In addition, changing the 75/25 rule to 
60/40, again, is going to give these busi-
nesses the flexibility that they need. 
How long do small businesses have to 
pay it back? Well, those who have al-
ready taken out the loans, 2 years. For 
new loans taken out from here on—and 
there is over $100 billion left in the

fund, so there will be many small busi-
nesses that still get loans—the period 
will be 24 weeks. Now, by the time the 
Senate gets ahold of this, it is always 
possible 
that 
that 
may 
be 
com-
promised, but at this point, it is 24 
weeks in this particular piece of legis-
lation. 
But I think one of the important 
things to remember is that the bor-
rower and the lender can get together 
and mutually agree, if they want to 
agree, if they don’t necessarily fall into 
the two categories that I just men-
tioned. So there is some flexibility for 
them to negotiate there as well. And 
there are other items, as we have al-
ready discussed. 
But the important thing is this will 
give America’s small businesses the 
flexibility to ensure that they at least 
have a chance to survive. And I know 
in my district in Cincinnati, and dis-
tricts all over the country, their very 
survival is at issue here. 
The PPP program—and it is a lot of 
money, as was mentioned: $350 billion 
and another $310 billion, so around $660 
billion in this program going out all 
over the country to these small busi-
nesses that are the backbone of the 
American economy. About half the 
people who work in America work for 
one of these small businesses. So this 
will help them to survive. 
Thank goodness the House of Rep-
resentatives was able to work together 
in a bipartisan manner to come to this 
point today where this legislation will 
likely pass in a few minutes. 
Mr. Speaker, I again thank the chair-
woman, and I yield back the balance of 
my time. 
Ms. VELA´ ZQUEZ. Mr. Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Mr. Speaker, I continuously hear 
from small businesses across the coun-
try about the uncertainty they are fac-
ing and when they will be able to fully 
reopen. In the face of that uncertainty, 
small businesses need flexibility with 
these loans. 
This bill takes an important step in 
providing that flexibility and making 
the 
Paycheck 
Protection 
Program 
work better for the millions of small 
businesses across the country that are 
trying to weather this storm. And 
since we do not know how long this 
storm will last, we must ensure small 
businesses are able to take advantage 
of the program through the end of the 
calendar year and to use the loan over 
the course of 24 weeks. This program is 
now a stronger onramp to full employ-
ment for small employers to weather 
this unprecedented economic and pub-
lic health crisis. 
I commend the Committee on Small 
Business staff on both sides of the aisle 
for their dedication and hard work over 
these last few months. I thank them 
for their commitment to our Nation’s 
small employers and their workers. 
And I thank the ranking member, be-
cause we have always, throughout the 
history of the committee, worked in a 
bipartisan manner. I always say, when 
we deal with small business issues, 
there is no Democratic or Republican 
approach. Those are American issues, 
particularly as they relate to our econ-
omy. 
Mr. Speaker, in that vein, I also 
thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. 
ROY) and the gentleman from Min-
nesota (Mr. PHILLIPS) for the great 
work that they did and for the bipar-
tisan spirit in which they brought this 
bill to the floor. 
Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge a vote 
in support of the legislation, and I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in 
support of this legislation to provide a critical 
source of aid to small businesses and non-
profits during the COVID–19 pandemic. While 
the Paycheck Protection Program was estab-
lished as an eight-week program, it was clear 
from the start that the economic impact of the 
pandemic would last far longer. I am proud 
that the House addressed this issue by ex-
panding the covered period to 24 weeks in the 
Heroes Act earlier this month, and I am glad 
this bill also includes a 24-week extension. 
The extended timeline will give borrowers the 
flexibility to spread out the loan proceeds over 
the full course of the crisis, and in a manner 
that is best for their small business or non-
profit. 
The legislation also takes action to change 
the harmful ‘‘75/25’’ percent rule that the Small 
Business Administration established to limit 
the use of Paycheck Protection Program loan 
proceeds for nonpayroll expenses to 25 per-
cent. While increasing the current limitation on 
the use of loan proceeds for nonpayroll ex-
penses from 25 percent to 40 percent will 
allow many small businesses to apply for the 
program, I am disappointed that this legislation 
falls short of the Heroes Act and fails to elimi-
nate the rule. Congress intended for the Pay-
check Protection Program to be a critical re-
source for all small businesses impacted by 
the pandemic. We must make sure that the 
program will be there and workable for micro-
businesses in high rent areas like New York 
City. Microbusinesses—such as ‘‘mom and 
pop’’ shops and corner stores—are the life-
blood of our communities. I will continue work-
ing to ensure that the small business assist-
ance programs created in the CARES Act are 
accessible and viable for the most vulnerable 
small businesses. 
I am also disappointed that this legislation 
was amended to remove language to retro-
actively establish a five-year minimum maturity 
on Paycheck Protection Program loans for 
amounts not forgiven. While the CARES Act 
allowed a maximum maturity of up to ten 
years from when the borrower applied for the 
loan, the Small Business Administration limited 
the minimum maturity of the loans to two 
years just hours before financial institutions 
began accepting Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram loans. To address this issue, the Heroes 
Act established a minimum maturity on PPP 
loans of five years to enable borrowers to am-
ortize loans over a longer period of time, de-
creasing their monthly payments on any por-
tion that is not forgiven. While this legislation 
also establishes a five-year minimum maturity 
on Paycheck Protection Program loans, it fails 
to make the change retroactive for the millions 
that have already received their loans. I will 
continue to call for the minimum maturity on 
Paycheck Protection Program loans to be ex-
tended for all Paycheck Protection Program 
borrowers. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. 
VELA´ ZQUEZ) that the House suspend the 
rules and pass the bill, H.R. 7010, as 
amended.

opinion of the Chair, two-thirds being

The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
Clerk will report the motion. 
The Clerk read as follows: 
Mr. Nadler moves to take from the Speak-
er’s table the bill, H.R. 6172, with the Senate 
amendments thereto, disagree to the Senate 
amendments, and request a conference with 
the Senate thereon. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman from New York (Mr. NADLER) is 
recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, for 
purposes of debate only, I yield 30 min-
utes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. 
JORDAN), and I yield myself such time 
as I may consume. 
Madam Speaker, bills like the USA 
Freedom Reauthorization Act touch 
deeply held beliefs on all sides. 
The bill we intended to consider last 
night strengthened privacy protections 
and made substantial improvements to 
the law. The bill, as amended by the 
Senate, is a good and important pack-
age of reforms. 
Now, you may disagree with that as-
sessment, you may genuinely believe 
that the bill doesn’t go far enough to 
reform the FISA system or perhaps 
that it goes too far with those reforms. 
If you disagree with me on the merits 
of the bill, I respect that disagreement. 
What I cannot accept, and what I sus-
pect many Americans will not accept, 
is a transparent, inexplicable, totally 
unjustified flip-flop on this bill, a bill 
important both to the security and the 
privacy of the United States. 
Just a few weeks ago, 126 Repub-
licans joined 152 Democrats in support 
of a nearly identical measure, different 
only in that the Senate has added one 
amendment, a good amendment with 
almost universal support. Virtually all 
of those 126 Republicans changed their 
position in the past 24 hours. 
Madam Speaker, the American peo-
ple see through those excuses. Nobody 
believes that this sudden reversal has 
anything to do with complaints about 
proxy voting. Nobody believes that the 
flip-flop is about Michael Flynn or 
Roger Stone, or even President Trump, 
whose cases have nothing to do with 
the authorities we hope to reform. 
There have been no real policy de-
mands to explain the sudden reversal, 
no demands for changes in the bill. If 
my Republican colleagues had asked 
for substantive changes to the bill, we 
would have heard them out and tried to 
address their concerns. 
But that is not what happened. The 
Republicans abandoned this bipartisan 
project for one reason, and one reason 
only: the President tweeted, on a 
whim, and told them to oppose this 
bill. 
Madam Speaker, this is just one 
more example of how the President and 
his enablers in this body have stood in 
the way of national security, of civil 
liberties, and of our responsibility as 
Members of Congress. 
I refuse to let our efforts to reform 
FISA die simply because Republicans 
are unwilling to stand up to the Presi-
dent’s whims. 
This legislation ends the NSA’s call 
detail records program; it applies the 
cutting edge of Fourth Amendment pri-
vacy protections to section 215; it 
forces the government to disclose years 
of secret FISA court opinions; it in-
creases transparency across the board; 
it raises the stakes for any government 
attorney who would dare mislead the 
court; and it dramatically expands the 
role of the amicus to be an advocate for 
privacy and civil liberties and to push 
back against claims that should have 
been rejected by the court long ago. 
It is our responsibility to continue 
our work, to pass this bill, to send it to 
the President’s desk, and to ensure 
that these reforms are made law. 
None of us should rest until we have 
done that work. 
I would be very interested to hear 
what changed in the bill between yes-
terday morning and yesterday evening 
that caused the Republicans to with-
draw their support from a bill they had 
agreed to, from provisions they said 
were improvements to national secu-
rity, from provisions they said were 
improvements to civil liberties of 
American citizens, and suddenly all op-
pose it. What changed, other than the 
President’s tweet? 
Madam Speaker, I urge my col-
leagues to support this motion and 
send the bill to conference where we 
can do the job we were sent here to do. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
everything 
has 
changed. The main change is it is 
worse than we thought. 
Since March 10, when this body last 
dealt with the FISA legislation, all 
kinds of things have changed. 
We have learned from the declassified 
transcripts how bad the situation was 
in the prior administration when they 
went after the Trump campaign. 
We have learned about the concerted 
effort to frame General Flynn, a three- 
star general, 30 years serving our coun-
try, and everything they did. 
We learned about January 4, when 
the FBI agents said: We should no 
longer pursue going after General 
Flynn. But what happened? Jim Comey 
told Peter Strzok: No, no, no. Go tell 
those agents we are going to continue 
to go after this guy. 
We learned the very next day, Janu-
ary 5, Jim Comey met with the Presi-
dent, President Obama, and talked 
about General Flynn. 
We learned on January 6 what hap-
pened that day. We learned that then- 
FBI Director Comey goes to Trump 
Tower and meets with then-President- 
elect Trump and talks to him about 
the dossier that they already know is 
false, that they know is Russian 
disinformation, they know is paid for 
by the Clinton campaign. 
Then what did we learn just 2 weeks 
later? January 20, 2017, what did they 
do? They sneak two agents into the 
White House, two FBI agents, to set up 
General Flynn. 
What else have we learned since we 
dealt with this issue on March 10? 
We have learned about the unmask-
ing of Michael Flynn, 39 people un-
masking General Flynn’s name, six 
people in Treasury. What are six Treas-
ury officials doing unmasking the guy 
who is going to be the National Secu-
rity Director in the incoming adminis-
tration? 
b 1330 
Finally, and probably most impor-
tantly, we have the report from Inspec-
tor General Horowitz; not the report he 
did on the Carter Page FISA—we al-
ready got that; we know how scathing 
that was. We know all the wrongdoings 
that took place there—but the inves-
tigation he is just starting on FISA in 
general. 
He has looked at 29 cases involving 
American citizens—29 cases—and found 
in every single one of those cases mul-
tiple 
problems 
when 
they 
were 
surveilled; again, American citizens. In 
4 of those 29 cases they couldn’t even 
find the Woods file. They couldn’t even 
find the file that you have to keep that 
has the basic evidence that you are 
then going to take to the FISA court. 
They couldn’t even find it. 
So he does something that you hard-
ly ever see. He does what is called a 
management alert, basically pulling 
the fire alarm saying this is so bad, I 
am going to tell you what is going on 
now; and I have just gotten started on 
looking at the overall FISA. 
So that is what has changed since 
March 10 when this body dealt with 
this issue. 
And when the President of the United 
States, a pretty important person in 
this debate, when he says, you know 
what? I think we should hit the pause 
button. We should wait here a little bit 
until we get to the bottom of every-
thing that took place; what Mr. Horo-
witz is looking at; what Mr. Barr is 
looking at; what U.S. Attorney John 
Durham is looking at. Maybe we should 
just kind of hit the pause button and 
figure all this out. That is all he said, 
and that is all we have advocated. That 
is why we took the position we did at 
the conference yesterday, and I appre-
ciate the fact that Leader MCCARTHY 
and our conference took that position. 
So let’s wait and get all the facts. 
Let’s wait until we actually hold peo-
ple accountable before we renew this 
program which, as the President said 
yesterday, does allow some warrantless

May 28, 2020 
searches of American citizens. So let’s 
make sure we get it right. That is our 
position as Republicans. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I am 
glad the gentleman learned all this 
since noon yesterday when he testified 
in front of the Rules Committee in 
favor of this bill. 
I yield such time as he may consume 
to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. 
HOYER), the distinguished majority 
leader. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
The information I had was, as the 
chairman has indicated, that the gen-
tleman who just spoke appeared before 
the Rules Committee in support of this 
bill. And we can get the transcript. I 
don’t have it right now, but perhaps 
somebody can get that transcript for 
me. 
For my entire career in public serv-
ice, I have supported efforts to make 
America both strong and safe and a 
force for peace and reconciliation. In 
the course of those years, I have striv-
en to draw an acceptable balance be-
tween our national security and the 
protection of our personal liberty and 
the right to privacy central to our 
unique 
extraordinary democracy; a 
government of laws, not men. 
Pursuant to that principle, as the 
majority leader, I scheduled the For-
eign Intelligence Surveillance Act for 
floor consideration over 2 months ago. 
Previously, in 2008, ROY BLUNT, then 
the minority whip, and myself, the ma-
jority leader; Senator Kit Bond, Sen-
ator from Missouri; and Senator Jay 
Rockefeller, Senator from West Vir-
ginia, worked together, at a time of 
great controversy with respect to the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 
to forge a bill that would garner bipar-
tisan support. It was a difficult bill, 
with the same kind of principle dif-
ferences that Chairman NADLER spoke 
of earlier and I am going to speak 
about again. 
We passed that bill in a bipartisan 
fashion with, as we have today, people 
on the right and people on the left con-
cerned about its content. So there was 
bipartisan support and bipartisan oppo-
sition. Speaker PELOSI and to-be Presi-
dent Obama, then in the Senate rep-
resenting Illinois, voted for that bill. I 
have tried to continue to forge that 
balance through the years. 
The bill I brought to the floor a few 
months ago was a bipartisan effort to 
achieve that critical balance, and when 
it came to a vote, it received two- 
thirds of the votes from both Demo-
crats and Republicans. This bill essen-
tially had two-thirds of the votes on 
the Republican side and two-thirds of 
the votes on the Democratic side, so 
obviously, two-thirds of the votes of 
this House. 
As I observed yesterday, Americans 
must have been heartened by the fact 
that we could reach a bipartisan agree-
ment on such a difficult bill. It was not 
a partisan bill. The leaders, all three 
top leaders, on both sides of the aisle 
supported, essentially, this bill. 
That bill, upon Senate consideration, 
was amended by an overwhelmingly bi-
partisan vote to strengthen the protec-
tions of privacy, which should have 
been heartening to those on the right 
and the left, and it was certainly heart-
ening to me. 
And then, what did they do? They 
passed it, with 80 Senators, 48 Repub-
licans supporting this bill; 48 out of 53 
supporting this bill. But this is not a 
partisan bill; and this bill is about that 
balance. 
Mr. NUNES and Mr. SCHIFF supported 
this bill and supported this balance. 
And two-thirds of us made a judgment 
that they had done a job worthy of sup-
port. 
So two-thirds of the Democrats in 
the Senate, two-thirds of the Repub-
licans in the Senate, two-thirds of the 
Republicans in this House, and two- 
thirds of the Democrats in this House 
have supported this bill. I believe that 
support was garnered because an as-
sumption was made, a premise was 
adopted by the overwhelming majority 
of us, that it was a carefully crafted 
balance between security and indi-
vidual liberties. It may not be perfect, 
but we have a responsibility to protect 
this country and our people. 
In consultation, therefore, with other 
leaders, I scheduled this bill for consid-
eration yesterday. The night before, I 
got a call from my friend, the minority 
leader, that the President was urging 
Republicans in the House to change 
their votes to ‘‘no.’’ 
In the twinkling of a presidential 
tweet, without any substantive logic to 
justify their actions, I was told that 
the 126 Republicans who had voted for 
this bill when it was considered in the 
House would now change their votes 
and vote ‘‘no.’’ 
Chairman NADLER has said this, and I 
want to share this because it is worth 
repeating. I believe when FISA passed 
the House in March, every Member, 
those who voted ‘‘yes’’ and those who 
voted ‘‘no’’ voted their principles and 
their conviction on what they believed 
was in the security interests of the 
United States. Every one of the 435 
people—I don’t think there were quite 
435—that voted on that bill, in my 
view, voted on principle and out of con-
viction. 
I, of course, believed that the two- 
thirds of the Members who voted for 
the bill, on principle, and pursuant to 
conviction about making this country 
safe, were voting, not for party, but for 
principle. 
Therefore, I was surprised because I 
saw, not then nor now, any reason that 
either principle or conviction should be 
changed, particularly in light of the 
fact that 80 Senators—80 Senators—48 
Republican colleagues of yours, Madam 
Speaker, voted for this bill. 
Therefore, I assumed that we could 
bring Members back. We had a con-
troversy where some didn’t come back. 
We had a new rule you don’t like. We 
could bring the Congress back and vote 
on a bipartisan bill for America. 
But, as a result of the President’s an-
tipathy toward Federal law enforce-
ment and his personal sense of griev-
ance, authorities that have expired will 
continue to be lapsed. 
The complicity of those who believe 
that the reauthorizing of these au-
thorities was in the best interest of the 
United States, in preventing its pas-
sage last night and today, is, I think, 
both sad and irresponsible. 
Madam Speaker, I regret that we did 
not bring this bill to the floor for a 
vote. 
This is a result, in my view, Madam 
Speaker, of patently political and inde-
fensible abandonment of principle and 
responsibility, 
both 
as 
a 
coequal 
branch of government and its policy-
making branch as well. 
Madam Speaker, we need to send this 
bill to conference. I urge my colleagues 
to vote to send it to conference. And if 
you think this needs to be perfected in 
some way, as Mr. NADLER said, that is 
the place to do it now that we are not 
going to have it on the floor. 
Let me repeat. I would have had it on 
the floor. But we will not get an oppor-
tunity to vote on it, so I will wait to 
see the result of a conference with the 
Republican-led Senate on the bill that 
the President has threatened to veto. 
Two-thirds of us believed that this 
was a bill that was good for America. 
This is a serious issue with serious con-
sequences, and I urge you to vote 
‘‘yes.’’ Do not kill this bill. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
I just want to correct a couple of 
things that the majority leader said. 
You guys are the ones that let the 
FISA law lapse. There was a 75-day ex-
tension sent over here. You guys got 
the majority. You let it lapse. 
We want to fix it. We want to correct 
it. We want to make sure it is not 
abused like it has obviously been 
abused. We didn’t let it lapse, you guys 
did. 
And frankly, if you guys got the 
votes for this bill, you got the major-
ity, you could pass it today. You don’t 
have the votes because we need more 
work to be done on this to correct it. 
The leader also said something that 
was not accurate. He said the President 
had no basis for the tweet he issued 
yesterday. 
Are you kidding me? Are you kidding 
me? 
They spied on two American citizens 
associated with his campaign, and he 
has got no basis for the tweet he did 
yesterday? 
They used a dossier to go to the se-
cret court to get a warrant to spy on 
one of those individuals; a dossier that 
they knew was false; a dossier they 
knew was paid for by the Clinton cam-
paign; a dossier that Jim Comey said— 
not me—Jim Comey said was salacious 
and unverified; a dossier where the au-
thor had already told the Justice De-
partment that he was desperate to stop

Trump from getting elected, and they 
used it to go spy on the Trump cam-
paign. 
And the President has no basis for 
the tweet he issued yesterday? 
b 1345 
Are you kidding me? You guys let it 
lapse. We are trying to fix it because 
we know how bad it is. 
Finally, I would just reiterate 29 
cases where American citizens were 
surveilled by the FBI, and every single 
one of those was a major problem when 
they went to the FISA court. As I said 
before, 
four 
of 
those 
cases, 
they 
couldn’t even find the Woods File. 
We want to fix this, and we are will-
ing to take as long as it takes. 
I agree with the chairman of the Ju-
diciary Committee. There are good 
things in the legislation. I said that 
yesterday at the Rules Committee. But 
what I also said at the Rules Com-
mittee is: Let’s get it right. 
If the President is saying that we are 
not going to do this until we figure out 
everything that went wrong, I agree 
with him 100 percent. More impor-
tantly, the American people agree with 
that. They want this fixed. They don’t 
want anything done on this until we 
get to the bottom of everything that 
took place in the Comey FBI. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
WASSERMAN SCHULTZ). Members are re-
minded to address their remarks to the 
Chair. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from 
Texas (Mr. GOHMERT). The judge is my 
good friend and fellow Judiciary Com-
mittee member. 
Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, one 
of the advantages we have seen from 
having a typed speech is you don’t for-
get things like I often do that are im-
portant points, but one of the weak-
nesses is you can’t respond to the myr-
iad of points that somebody just made 
explaining why we need massive reform 
to the FISA bill and the information 
that has come out. 
Now, I got here 15 years ago, and I 
was part of the reauthorization back in 
those days. We got lied to by the Jus-
tice Department about how this would 
be used. They came back in the private 
meetings: Oh, we don’t go after Ameri-
cans. 
We have seen from the information 
that has come out in recent weeks that 
they do exactly what they told us by 
behind closed doors they never did. 
This thing needs to be massively re-
formed. 
What happened in the last 24 hours? 
Something called a Rules Committee, 
and it wouldn’t allow our reforms. It 
wouldn’t allow this body to vote on im-
portant reforms. 
Go reread the Fourth Amendment. 
We are not supposed to authorize 
searches and seizures against Ameri-
cans without the proper due process, 
without a probable cause, and without 
particularly describing the places to be 
searched and what to be seized. And 
the FISA court has violated that. 
Oh, some say, we just add an amicus 
in there and that will take care of it. 
The FISA judges did not even have 
the honor of their courts after finding 
out they were lied to repeatedly and 
fraud was committed against them to 
do something about it. That tells you 
we need massive reform. 
A vote to go to conference is a total 
abdication of this body’s job to put out 
a good bill that does reform. 
Madam Speaker, I ask everybody, 
vote ‘‘no’’ to go to conference so that 
we can force this House to do its job. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, let 
me just say, first of all, of course, 
much of what the distinguished gen-
tleman from Ohio said is fiction, as we 
all know. 
But, second of all, this bill as of yes-
terday noon was supported by Repub-
licans and was supported by the gen-
tleman from Ohio as making sufficient 
reforms, as making the reforms that 
we all recognize we need in the FISA 
system. 
Madam Speaker, I yield such time as 
he may consume to the gentleman 
from Maryland (Mr. HOYER), who is the 
distinguished majority leader. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, this is 
testimony dated 5/27/2020. I am going to 
read you some passages from that tes-
timony: 
‘‘Thank you for the opportunity to 
talk about this important legislation.’’ 
I will go down, skip a couple of para-
graphs. Perhaps he will want to point 
those out. 
‘‘Fortunately,’’ the gentleman said, 
‘‘this bill makes important structural 
reforms to the program to combat 
abuses.’’ 
He then said: ‘‘Most importantly, 
this bill includes accountability meas-
ures.’’ 
He went on to say: ‘‘It also includes 
reforms 
that 
strengthen 
Congress’ 
oversight powers.’’ 
‘‘Finally,’’ he said, ‘‘I would like to 
thank Senators Lee and Leahy for 
their amendment to the House-passed 
bill which strengthens the amicus role 
in these proceedings by extending them 
to any sensitive investigative matter 
involving any U.S. persons. And I also 
fully support this inclusion as well of 
the 
Lofgren-Davidson 
amendment,’’ 
which is not on the bill, ‘‘to limit the 
FBI’s ability to obtain internet brows-
ing history of Americans.’’ 
I am trying to find a word of opposi-
tion to this bill, clearly, taken by the 
Rules Committee as support of the pas-
sage of this bill. 
My, my, my. As I have pointed out 
earlier, the consequences of a twin-
kling of a tweet from the President of 
the United States: Like that, changing 
the votes of 126 people, whom I believed 
voted on principle and on conviction 
for this bill for America. 
Madam Speaker, I thank the gen-
tleman for yielding. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I re-
serve the balance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, let 
me first point out, I already said that 
I supported the legislation. I said that, 
but I also said we could make it better. 
And the President, in light of what we 
have learned in the last 2 months—we 
need to make it better. I think we can 
do that. 
We should never forget the President 
of the United States plays a pretty im-
portant role. In fact, he has to sign the 
bills, last time I checked, so his posi-
tion does have real impact. 
Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to 
the gentleman from the great State of 
Ohio (Mr. DAVIDSON). 
Mr. DAVIDSON of Ohio. Madam 
Speaker, I thank the gentleman for 
yielding. 
Madam Speaker, as the majority 
leader well knows better than most of 
us in the room, for a bill to become 
law, the President of the United States 
must sign it, and he has made clear 
that he is not going to sign this prod-
uct. So, it is a complete waste of every-
one’s time to send over a bill that has 
no chance to become law. 
Rather than make this bill better, 
rather than make this bill something 
that could become law, we are going to 
run out the clock on more broken proc-
ess. Why are we going to do that? We 
are going to do that because the people 
who are working to preserve the bro-
ken status quo of warrantless spying 
on American citizens want to keep that 
status quo in place. 
So, rather than allow real reform, we 
have had a process that bypassed the 
Judiciary Committee. When Chairman 
NADLER
realized he didn’t have the 
votes to move his own product through 
the committee, he pulled the whole 
committee process. In a committee 
process, amendments would be able to 
be offered, and because they knew the 
amendments would be offered in ac-
cordance with the rules of the House 
and would be adopted if they were 
given a chance to vote, they had to pull 
it. 
So, they didn’t run it through the 
committee. The people who are rep-
resented by all 435 of us in this body 
had no chance to have their voices 
heard in a regular process. Leadership 
jammed through this broken bill to try 
to put some window dressing of reform 
on it. 
Some of them are important; they 
are better than the status quo. But 
they are just modest reforms. That is 
why they had so much support from 
the people who want to preserve it. 
Then, when there was a real reform, 
you saw that drop off. Then, when 
there 
was 
the 
Lofgren-Davidson 
amendment that really would reform it 
and stop warrantless spying on Ameri-
cans’ internet browser data, when it 
was spying on Americans, they stopped 
it—not a single vote on an amendment 
in the people’s House of the United 
States of America to preserve and pro-
tect the freedoms guaranteed in the 
Fourth Amendment. 
Yes, we must make our Nation se-
cure. But we must do it constitu-
tionally in full compliance with the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2345 
May 28, 2020 
Bill of Rights. No one is exempt, Arti-
cle I, Article II, or Article III. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself such time as I may con-
sume. 
Madam Speaker, I listened to the dis-
tinguished gentleman a moment ago: 
We shouldn’t pass any legislation that 
the President won’t sign. 
The King of England used to have the 
royal prerogative, an absolute veto. 
The President of the United States 
does not. 
This House and the Senate should do 
its job and pass proper legislation, and 
let the President do his job. We had 
two-thirds of the votes in this House 
for this bill. 
Yes, the gentleman from Ohio men-
tions the Lofgren-Davidson amend-
ment. I support that amendment. If we 
had gone forward, we could have gone 
with it. But the fact of the matter is, 
they have withdrawn their support be-
cause of the President’s tweet, and for 
no other reason, we are where we are 
now. 
To preserve the ability to have the 
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act 
and preserve national security as well 
as the improvements in the act em-
bodied in this bill and in the Senate 
version of the bill that improves secu-
rity while improving privacy protec-
tions against surveillance, we must ap-
prove this motion to go to conference. 
Madam Speaker, I reserve the bal-
ance of my time. 
Mr. JORDAN. Madam Speaker, I 
yield back the balance of my time. 
Mr. NADLER. Madam Speaker, I 
yield myself the balance of my time. 
Madam Speaker, I repeat what I said 
before. We have a choice. The Foreign 
Intelligence Surveillance Act, as every-
body agrees, is not in good shape. FISA 
is necessary to preserve the security of 
the United States. I think everyone 
agrees with that. But we need improve-
ments to FISA to make sure that while 
we protect the security of the United 
States against foreign aggression and 
foreign subversion, such as the Russian 
attempt to subvert our elections 4 
years ago, we also must improve FISA 
to provide greater protections against 
unwarranted surveillance and provide 
greater protections for American civil 
liberties and privacy. 
This bill does that. It may not do it 
as much as some people want, but it 
goes a heck of a lot further than what 
we have now. This bill must be passed 
if we are going to have the protections 
of civil liberties that we want. 
Madam Speaker, this bill is a decent 
balance. I urge its adoption. To do 
that, we have to go to conference. I 
urge the adoption of the motion to go 
to conference, and I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. 
DEGETTE). Without objection, the pre-
vious question is ordered on the mo-
tion. 
There was no objection. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The 
question is on the motion offered by 
the gentleman from New York (Mr. 
NADLER). 
The question was taken; and the 
Speaker pro tempore announced that 
the ayes appeared to have it. 
Mr. GRIFFITH. Madam Speaker, on 
that I demand the yeas and nays. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursu-
ant to section 3 of House Resolution 
965, the yeas and nays are ordered.

MOMENT OF SILENCE HONORING 
REPRESENTATIVE SAM JOHNSON 
(Mr. THORNBERRY asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute.) 
Mr. THORNBERRY. Madam Speaker, 
yesterday, we lost a former colleague, 
a patriot, and a true American hero. 
Calling the gentleman from Texas, 
Sam Johnson, a hero is not some sort 
of inflated rhetoric or hyperbole; it is 
the best description I know of Sam 
Johnson and his life. 
Born in San Antonio, raised in Dal-
las, a graduate of SMU, Sam then 
served 29 years in the United States 
Air Force. 
He was a fighter pilot, and some of 
those fighter pilot traits came through 
in everything he did, from how fast he 
drove across the highways of Texas to 
the way he approached legislation. 
Sam was a veteran of the Korean 
conflict and, of course, the Vietnam 
war. 
On his 25th combat mission in Viet-
nam, he was shot down, severely in-
jured, and spent the next 7 years as a 
prisoner of war in the prison known as 
the Hanoi Hilton. 
Many Members have read his book 
‘‘Captive Warriors,’’ which describes 
the hellish conditions and the courage 
and fortitude of Sam and his fellow 
prisoners as they fought to survive. 
After serving in the Texas State 
House, Sam was elected to Congress in 
1990 and served until January 2019, in-
cluding, for a time, as acting chairman 
of the Ways and Means Committee. 
He now goes to join his wonderful 
wife, Shirley, and his son, Bob. 
Madam Speaker, I know of no one in 
the House who was more universally 
admired across the Chamber than Sam 
Johnson. 
Sam sacrificed much in service of our 
Nation, but always with courage and 
good humor and a deep, deep love of 
country. 
He inspired those of us who worked 
with him, and his memory will con-
tinue to be an inspiration to follow his 
example of service, sacrifice, and love 
of country. 
Madam Speaker, I ask that the House 
observe a moment of silence in mem-
ory and in honor of this great Amer-
ican. 
The SPEAKER. Will all Members 
please rise, and those who are in their 
offices and staff throughout the Cap-
itol, for a moment of silence in honor 
of our dear Sam.

b 1515 
LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM 
(Mr. HOYER asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as we 
face the crisis that COVID–19 has con-
fronted us with, the House must do its 
duty in full and do so in a way that 
contributes to the safety and welfare of 
our people, not in a way that harms it. 
Members are advised there will be no 
votes expected in the House next week. 
Members are further advised that an 
updated 2020 legislative calendar will 
be released in the coming days. 
I expect conversations to continue on 
additional 
legislation 
addressing 
COVID–19 and the legislation we passed 
honoring our heroes. In the event that 
an agreement is reached on a bipar-
tisan or partisan bill—I don’t know 
how an agreement can be reached on a 
partisan bill, but a bipartisan bill— 
then we will make sure that the House 
has 72 hours before they need to come 
back to vote on that legislation. 
I 
am 
disappointed 
that 
Leader 
MCCONNELL said, when asked about the 
next phase of coronavirus relief, he 
said, I think that’s a decision to be 
made a month from now. 
As we know, we have a lot of people 
in crisis. We see food lines that are 
very, very long. We see unemployment 
rising steeply. There are many people 
in this country that think waiting is 
not appropriate. 
I am pleased the House has adopted a 
resolution to allow the committees to 
work remotely, Madam Speaker. I ex-
pect to use the coming weeks to get 
our committees back up and running so 
that they can begin having hearings 
and markups on critical legislation. 
As my friend, Mr. SCALISE, knows, we 
have a number of must-pass bills that 
need to be addressed; the National De-
fense Authorization Act, the 12 appro-
priation bills, the surface transpor-
tation bill, and the WRDA bill as well. 
As committees begin consideration of 
these bills, I will be in touch with 
Members about when they will be 
scheduled this summer. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE), 
the minority whip. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank my friend from Maryland for 
walking through those items. 
I first want to start by sharing and 
associating myself with the comments 
made by my friend from Texas (Mr. 
THORNBERRY) about the loss of our dear 
friend, Sam Johnson. 
Sam and I got to be close friends, and 
I can picture him sitting right over 
there by General Lafayette’s painting, 
in his scooter, as he was voting and 
sharing stories with friends in his last 
few months when he served here with 
us with distinction for so long, and the 
conversations 
and 
just 
the 
under-
standing of a giant that we served 
with, someone who served our country, 
spent 7 years in the Hanoi Hilton, as we 
talked about. 
They never broke him. They probably 
broke every bone in his body trying, 
but he and those other brave men in 
that prison never once faltered in their 
love and dedication to our country and 
to their family. 
He missed his wife. We know now he 
is with her and in a special place, and 
we are all better for having served with 
Sam Johnson. He truly is missed and 
was a special friend. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I want 
to echo the gentleman’s comments. Al-
though the Congressman, the patriot, 
the hero, did not always vote with me, 
nor I with him, we became good 
friends. And I shared with the gen-
tleman and others in this body a deep 
respect for who he was as a person, a 
decent man, a patriotic man, a good 
man and, obviously, as the gentleman 
pointed out, a very courageous man as 
well. 
He served many missions, was shot 
down, imprisoned, but they did not 
break Sam Johnson, nor did they break 
the love he had for his country, and we 
honor the service he gave. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
want to thank the Speaker as well for 
leading that tribute, and I am sure at 
some time in the future we will spend 
an appropriate amount of time here on 
the floor where colleagues can share

those stories about someone that ev-
erybody ought to know. We know we 
have some giants like JOHN LEWIS and 
Sam Johnson who we got to serve with. 
Sam left and now is no longer with us. 
John still is and, obviously, he is going 
through his own battle, and we pray for 
John as well. 
But as we have our battles of the day 
politically, it is good to remember the 
special people that get to make up this 
body and become part of this great in-
stitution in which we have the honor to 
serve. So I appreciate the Speaker and 
the leader allowing us to have that mo-
ment. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I yield 
to the gentlewoman from California 
(Ms. PELOSI). 
Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding. It is a sad day for us, but 
what a joy for all of us to have served 
with Sam Johnson, a bona fide Amer-
ican hero, to serve with him in the 
Congress. 
I appreciate that the gentleman from 
Louisiana (Mr. SCALISE) mentioned 
him and JOHN LEWIS in the same sen-
tence, because I had the privilege— 
JOHN LARSON set up a Heroes Night, a 
bipartisan Heroes Night, and I had the 
privilege of giving Sam the award that 
night as a true hero. 
He always beamed when he talked 
about Shirley, and he loved the chil-
dren, his son, Bob. Now he is with 
them, with Shirley and Bob. 
This was a very special person. I was 
mentioning to the distinguished whip 
earlier that we were there when the 
room was named for him. We were 
there when his picture was hung. He al-
ways wanted us all around him to cele-
brate the recognition that he received 
so that he could boast of his biparti-
sanship and his patriotism, which we 
all admired. 
I was mentioning to the distin-
guished whip and Mr. THORNBERRY and 
others that on one of those occasions 
he had a fellow prisoner of war there 
with him, and that bond is something 
so beyond anything we can imagine. 
Imagine the strength, the courage, the 
patriotism, just the faith in God that 
he had. 
So I thank the gentleman for the op-
portunity to share some personal com-
ments about a really great man; al-
ways friendly, always smiling, always 
teasing about political differences but, 
as always, just being a model of great-
ness to all of us. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, if 
anybody wants to have a good read, his 
book, ‘‘Captive Warriors,’’ tells the 
story of those years in the Hanoi Hil-
ton; not only the unbreakable bond of 
those heroes that he served in that 
prison with, but also the unbreakable 
love between he and Shirley. She never 
wavered from her love of him, 7 years 
removed, while some of that time she 
didn’t even know if he was alive. 
He loved her till the day she died and 
till the day he died because he mourned 
her death every day since, and it was 
something for all of us—again, as we 
have our daily battles here—just to 
know the special kind of people that we 
get to serve with, and he was surely 
one. 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, as I 
said, what we are going to do over the 
next couple of weeks, we have adopted 
a rule that allows the committees to 
meet even if they can’t be here for 
health reasons, depending upon what 
the status is in D.C. and the Capitol, 
where it is around the country, includ-
ing transportation. 
The rule that we adopted provides 
that committees must have, in order to 
conduct virtual or hybrid hearings, a 
practice session, then two hearings be-
fore they go to a markup. 
So obviously, if we are going to work 
on this floor, we need product and, ob-
viously, product comes from the com-
mittees. And so I am very hopeful that 
the committees will be getting up and 
running at top speed in many respects. 
And, of course, the committees have 
been working so very hard, and the 
Members have been working so very 
hard, in my view, on both sides of the 
aisle, as they have been home and talk-
ing to their hospitals, talking to their 
governors and their county commis-
sioners and their local folks, nursing 
home administrators, so many people 
that we have kept in touch with 
through these weeks to see what we 
could do to assist them with whatever 
they needed. 
b 1530 
The committees will be getting up to 
speed, and they will be qualifying for 
having hearings. I expect work product 
to be coming later this month, and we 
will be giving notice in the near term 
on a longer term schedule. But the 
House will not be in session next week, 
and we will be looking at how the com-
mittees are proceeding from that point 
on. 
We will give, as I said, as we have in 
the past, 72 hours’ notice to Members 
when and if we have to come back. 
I want to again say also that we are 
very hopeful that our Republican col-
league will engage in the matters that 
were included in the HEROES bill be-
cause our States are struggling. I know 
my State is a relatively wealthy State, 
but its revenues are off 20, 25 percent. I 
don’t know what Louisiana’s position 
is, but I am sure they are struggling as 
well. Municipalities are struggling, cit-
ies are struggling, and counties are 
struggling from the revenue reduction 
that is a direct result of COVID–19. So, 
we are trying to help those States. 
In addition, of course, we invested 
substantial sums in testing, isolating, 
tracing, and treating individuals who 
have COVID, and we need to follow up 
on whom they have contacted so that 
we can make sure that they isolate 
themselves because the only way we 
are going to get a handle on this is to 
make sure we reduce the transition 
from one to the other. 
We are also hopeful that we will de-
velop, and there is money in there to 
develop, a therapeutic to mitigate the 
adverse effects of COVID–19 but also a 
vaccine to protect us from getting 
COVID–19. 
Until that happens, we also need to 
give additional help to our small busi-
nesses and individuals who are really 
struggling as unemployment is at his-
toric levels. Over 38 million Ameri-
cans—maybe it is now closer to 40 mil-
lion Americans—are without jobs. We 
have given them assistance, and we 
need to give them some more. 
That is where we stand now, and we 
will operate with an intent in mind of 
getting the business of the House done, 
in addition to the extraordinary work 
that we have done on five responses 
now from the House on the effects that 
the coronavirus has caused in this 
country both to human beings’ health 
and to the health of our economy. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to the gen-
tleman from Louisiana. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
thank the gentleman for yielding. 
Madam Speaker, we have worked to-
gether to help try to address the prob-
lems within our country, both eco-
nomically and the health side, small 
businesses, medium-sized businesses, 
large businesses, and State and local 
governments. 
Trillions of dollars have already been 
spent. When you think just about the 
hundreds of billions of dollars that we 
sent to States through various means, 
whether it is direct aid, the $150 billion 
package that we have sent to States, 
we see that each State got a large 
share of that money, billions of dollars 
in some cases for each State. 
I don’t know one State that has spent 
all of their allotment. Many are work-
ing to try to figure out if they are 
going to help local governments or not. 
It was surely our intention here that it 
wouldn’t just be for States, that 45 per-
cent of that money should be available 
for local governments as well. I would 
urge Governors to respect that intent 
of this body. 
Rather than continuing to look to 
Washington, I think States need to 
start looking within and saying: How 
can we work to safely reopen our 
States, and how have other States done 
it successfully if other States are be-
hind? 
We have models out there. That is 
why we always say the States are the 
great incubators of democracy. We all 
have smart people in this country who 
are figuring this out. States that are 
reopening successfully that aren’t see-
ing spikes in their hospitals have done 
things and used protocols working off 
of guidance from the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention to suc-
cessfully get their economies back 
open again. 
No economy is back open at the level 
it needs to be, and that is why we need 
to encourage everybody to safely re-
open so that the real answer to States 
that have budget problems is to start 
getting their economies going again; 
get people back to work again; get peo-
ple out having their checkups with

their doctors again, their immuniza-
tions for the children who aren’t get-
ting immunized, the cancer treat-
ments, the mammograms, and the 
colonoscopies that were being skipped 
for months. We are seeing studies that 
are coming out from very well-re-
spected health experts who are talking 
about the real health danger of having 
shut-ins and people not getting out 
again. 
We have to weigh all of this, and we 
have to keep encouraging the great 
progress we are seeing from some of 
these great drug companies here in 
America that are working on a cure, 
that are finding therapies that are ef-
fective for COVID–19 with the help, by 
the way, of some of those trillions of 
dollars that we have spent here in 
Washington to find, hopefully, a vac-
cine. Even Dr. Fauci is talking about 
the possibility of a vaccine being avail-
able soon. We need to make sure that 
we are working to help ramp up pro-
duction when that is found so that we 
can make it available to anyone who 
wants to take it. 
We need to be also focused on holding 
China accountable. We need to be fo-
cused on bringing production back to 
America of PPE, which was in short 
supply in those critical weeks after we 
found out China, while they were lying 
to the world about this disease, with 
the WHO joining in with them, was 
stopping and blocking the export of 
PPE, which they make the lion’s share 
of, including American companies in 
China that weren’t even allowed to sell 
PPE back to us when they had orders 
in place to do so. 
So, we should be investigating that. I 
am sorry that that is not happening 
here. 
We should be addressing how we can 
bring more of that manufacturing back 
to America to create new jobs for 
Americans making our own protective 
equipment for our frontline workers 
like doctors and nurses. Unfortunately, 
that focus hasn’t been there. 
But the real issue is: What should 
Congress’ role be in this? Shouldn’t 
Congress be leading the way in showing 
people how to safely reopen and do our 
work? 
While we have had only a limited 
number of opportunities to come back 
here and vote directly on the House 
floor, it has been a smooth process. It 
has been a process that has been safe 
for Members, staggered votes where so-
cial distancing, which is still the 
standard that everybody should be 
practicing, is able to be exercised in a 
safe and effective way. 
Clearly, we had a very big difference 
on the proxy voting, and I think we 
have already seen abuses of that proc-
ess. But the real issue is: When are we 
going to get back to a functioning, reg-
ular schedule for the House of Rep-
resentatives? 
A major company here, Disney, an-
nounced yesterday they are going to 
start opening their parks again in a 
few weeks. You have the National Bas-
ketball Association talking about play-
ing games again, whether or not there 
are fans in the stands. When you talk 
about a sport that can’t exercise social 
distancing, they are working on proto-
cols right now to test players and to 
allow games to go on. We all know the 
physical nature of a sport like basket-
ball or even football. Hockey is talking 
about coming back. NASCAR is al-
ready racing again. 
As all of these things are happening 
and these ideas and these great ways to 
safely get different parts of our econ-
omy open again, we don’t even know 
what the schedule of the House is and 
when the House will actually be back 
voting again. 
The 
Armed 
Services 
Committee 
could be in a large room in the Capitol 
that is sitting vacant right now, debat-
ing the National Defense Authorization 
Act, so we don’t get caught bringing up 
legislation at the midnight hour. We 
can actually start working on that 
now. That work can be done here in 
Washington. It doesn’t have to be done 
remotely. 
These are the concerns that we would 
ask: Is there going to be a time when 
the majority leader would put out a 
new schedule that actually shows what 
our voting pattern will be? 
We know, obviously, when you look 
at May, April, and even June, clearly, 
that has changed. But at some point, 
will it be mid-June? Will it be July? 
Again, if NBA players can be playing 
basketball in July, can’t we have a reg-
ular schedule by then that the House 
will be conducting business? 
We have seen the Spanish flu, and 
people had to get here with horses and 
buggies, yet they figured out how to do 
it. 
Can we lead the way again in show-
ing people how to safely do our busi-
ness with a consistent schedule that 
right now doesn’t exist? 
Mr. HOYER. The answer is yes. We 
are going to have out a fuller schedule 
in the near term. But we have to find 
out how our committees can operate. 
I want to say, regarding the national 
defense authorization bill, Members on 
both sides of the aisle have been work-
ing very, very hard at a distance, on 
the phone, and in other ways. So, I ex-
pect them to be ready to come to the 
floor this summer, and we are going to 
pass that bill, we think, before the 
summer break. That is for certain. 
Madam Speaker, I yield to my friend. 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, if I 
could ask the gentleman on the voting 
and whether it is in committee, clear-
ly, there are rooms here in the Cap-
itol—we have seen the Rules Com-
mittee utilize the Ways and Means 
Committee where they are able to be 
spread out at distances well beyond the 
safe standards of social distancing, well 
beyond 6 feet where you can have in- 
person hearings where the back and 
forth of a debate and the votes that 
would go with it where a proxy vote 
doesn’t really fit that situation can 
occur. I would hope that we do that. 
This shouldn’t have been a partisan 
exercise. I know early on we talked 
about trying to find a way to conduct 
our business where both parties would 
agree, and the minority leader and the 
Speaker were talking about doing that, 
and we thought that would be how it 
would end up. Of course, that wasn’t 
what happened with the proxy voting. 
But even my friend just mentioned 
that if somebody proxy voted, then it 
would be for health reasons. Yet, yes-
terday, the first time where this new 
experiment that has never been done in 
over 230 years was conducted, there 
were Members who voted by proxy 
signing a document saying that they 
couldn’t be here to physically attend 
proceedings, yet it turns out they were 
in other places. In some cases, it took 
them longer to get to a rocket launch 
than it would have taken them to get 
here to the United States Capitol, in 
clear violation of the intent of proxy 
voting. That literally was just on the 
first day. 
I don’t know if the gentleman is 
going to revisit proxy voting. But, 
clearly, we have seen most people can 
come here and do the work. Even some 
who chose not to could have been here. 
What message does that send to the 
country when we should be the ones 
leading the way to safely reopen? 
Mr. HOYER. Madam Speaker, I think 
the country is distancing itself as well. 
I don’t know whether my friend drove 
to work today, but there are hardly 
any cars on the street. There are hard-
ly any cars on the street in New York. 
The reason is because people are taking 
the advice of the government and prac-
ticing social distancing. 
We think that makes sense. We think 
that is consistent with medical advice, 
and that is what we have been doing. 
It is very nice to say, well, they 
could have been here, but there are a 
lot of West Coast Members who have to 
get on airplanes. Some of those air-
planes now, because there are so few 
flights, are very crowded, and people 
are concerned because they are not 
practicing social distancing. 
When I am speaking, I don’t wear a 
mask. But if you see me in the Capitol 
and getting into my car, I have a mask 
on. I think we are setting an example. 
I think we are setting an example of 
how you distance here on this floor, 
which we are all practicing right now. 
So, I think the House is setting a 
good example of understanding that it 
is not business as usual. When you 
walk down the street and people are 
wearing masks, you know it is not 
business as usual. You know it is not 
the America of 3 or 4 months ago, 
Madam Speaker. 
In any event, I think we are going to 
proceed. We have provided to do the 
business of the American people. We 
did that just in the last 2 days. We 
passed a number of very important 
bills, important bills to small business 
in particular. 
I was sorry that we didn’t resolve the 
FISA question, but we did go to con-
ference. We will see what happens on

that. We have passed, as the gentleman 
mentioned earlier, extraordinary legis-
lation through this House over the last 
2 months to ensure that the American 
people got the help they needed and 
that the economics of our country will 
undergird it to the extent we could. So, 
we have done a lot of work. 
I want to say this: I think we do a 
disservice to our Members and to this 
institution if we go home and pretend 
that Members somehow aren’t working 
because they are not physically in this 
room. I don’t know, I presume my 
friend’s 
Members—but 
I 
tell 
you, 
Madam Speaker, the Members on my 
side of the aisle are working around 
the clock and communicating around 
the clock. 
That bill that we passed in a bipar-
tisan way, we took a lot of time, days 
and days and days and days of hours- 
and hours- and hours-long conversa-
tions to get to a consensus on what 
ought to be in that bill, and we passed 
it in a bipartisan way. 
So, my presumption is my friend did 
the same. I don’t know; I was not on 
my friend’s phone calls. But you do a 
disservice, I think—I don’t mean you 
personally. But we do a disservice to 
allow the President or anybody else— 
nobody is on vacation. People are 
working harder now than if we didn’t 
have this coronavirus is my observa-
tion. 
I am hopeful that we will move on. I 
am hopeful that we will be back to 
business as usual and as soon as pos-
sible—‘‘possible’’ 
is 
the 
operative 
word—with the advice of our Capitol 
physician, with the advice of the ad-
ministration, and my own Governor. 
My friend talked about States. I have 
a 
Republican 
Governor, 
Governor 
Hogan, whose father was one of my 
predecessors. I know he is still very 
cautious and urging caution for our 
citizens. 
Madam Speaker, unless the gen-
tleman has something further, I am 
prepared to yield back the balance of 
my time. 
b 1545 
Mr. SCALISE. Madam Speaker, I 
would just say that, clearly, we have a 
disagreement on how business should 
be conducted on the House floor, spe-
cifically as it relates to proxy voting 
and whether or not we can be here 
physically doing the job. And, clearly, 
when we are at home in our districts, 
we are finding other ways to get work 
done, to communicate with constitu-
ents, to communicate with people all 
around the Nation. Using technology, 
it has definitely helped the ability for 
us to do it, but it is not the same thing 
as when we are here. 
The other side of that, because one 
piece of it is the ability to be here— 
and, clearly, we have the ability to be 
here. There are flights. If somebody is 
not comfortable flying, they used to 
take horse and buggy. They didn’t have 
planes, and yet they found a way to get 
here in tougher times. But then you 
look at the message that we are trying 
to send. And, yes, there are some 
places that you don’t have traffic on 
the road because their officials have 
chosen not to open as aggressively as 
others, using safety protocols. 
No one is talking about compro-
mising safety, but there are many 
States that have shown how to safely 
reopen on a much wider scale where 
you can get people back out doing the 
things that they want to do again, and 
that is the real issue. You are watching 
aspects of the private sector, you are 
even watching other levels of govern-
ment, large cities, large States that 
are reopening and doing it successfully, 
not overrunning their hospitals. 
Most of our hospitals are telling us 
they want more patients. They want 
the people who normally would be get-
ting their checkups and immunizations 
and even hip replacements and things 
that are part of their life cycle, their 
quality of life, and their ability to live 
with cancer treatments and things like 
that that aren’t being done. There are 
people dying right now because they 
are not being tended to. 
In my home parish, I actually talked 
to my coroner about this. He took a 6- 
week period—just 2 weeks ago, took a 
6-week period and took that exact 6- 
week period a year ago, and there was 
a 42 percent increase in non-COVID-re-
lated deaths, just in my home parish. 
This year, more—Madam Speaker, 42 
percent increase—because people aren’t 
going out, aren’t going to the doctor. If 
they had chest pains, they weren’t 
going to a doctor because the doctor’s 
office is closed, where they could catch 
it, and so they were dying in their 
house. 
These are real numbers from the cor-
oner. I mean, there is a problem that is 
created by not allowing people to go 
about their lives again in a safe way. 
So we ought to be leading the way, 
leading the way to show people how to 
do it. And, again, we have had votes 
here on the House floor before proxy 
voting in the midst of this pandemic, 
and it went very smoothly. And if 
there are better ways we can find to do 
it, we will do it. 
But we followed all the protocols of 
the Attending Physician. I didn’t hear 
of any Members complaining about 
that process. Everybody went about it 
their own way, practicing the social 
distancing that we all encourage. Yet 
we are not doing that on a consistent 
basis, and that doesn’t send the right 
message. 
As the gentleman reworks the sched-
ule, and I hope it is done soon, I hope 
it takes into account the fact that it is 
important for us to show the rest of the 
country that we can be here doing our 
job. 
Yes, there are things that we are 
going to do remotely. There are things 
we always do remotely. If we are on a 
3-week schedule in D.C. and 1 week 
back home in our districts, it is impor-
tant that we go back home to stay in 
touch with the people who actually 
elect us, the people who make this 
country work so that we can come 
back here and represent them better. 
But we do have to come back here 
and do the work. You can’t phone it in 
sometimes. You can’t do that re-
motely. There are certain parts of our 
job where we actually have to be here. 
In the rough-and-tumble of a legisla-
tive process, things change on the fly; 
and if you are back home or going to 
some other event somewhere else be-
cause you choose not to come here, it 
is kind of hard to say you gave your 
proxy to somebody and then things 
change 2 minutes before a vote. It is 
going to be hard for that person to 
know how to change their vote by 
proxy when they are not here. 
So there are flaws in there that don’t 
need to be there because we have prov-
en we can be here. I just hope that that 
is taken into account when the new 
schedule is being worked out, and, 
again, hopefully released as soon as 
possible so that as other people and in-
dustries and groups are starting to 
show how they are going to come back 
safely, we can do the same thing—not 
last. Clearly, we are not going to be 
first now, but hopefully, as other peo-
ple are making those decisions, we can 
be part of that, not at the tail end of it. 
Mr. 
HOYER. 
Madam 
Speaker, 
I 
thank the gentleman, and I yield back 
the balance of my time.

COVID–19, STRATEGIC TESTING 
FOR WORKERS 
(Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend her re-
marks.) 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, as of 
yesterday, the United States death toll 
from COVID–19 has reached over 100,000 
precious lives. 
Recent headlines tell the story of 
COVID–19 risks as workers report to 
work with no testing. The Toledo Blade 
reports: ‘‘Coronavirus Strikes Fermi 2 
Nuclear Plant During Refueling.’’ Reu-
ters reports: ‘‘All Three Detroit Auto-
makers Had Workers Test Positive for 
COVID–19 Since Plants Reopened.’’ And 
Willamette Week reports: ‘‘The Re-
opening of Vancouver, Washington, Is 
On Hold as 65 Workers Test Positive for 
COVID–19 at a Fruit Processing Facil-
ity.’’ 
Madam Speaker, I include in the 
RECORD the articles I mentioned.

2 NUCLEAR 
PLANT DURING REFUELING; UTILITY KEEPS 
WORKING 
(By Tom Henry) 
NEWPORT, MICH.—An undisclosed number 
of coronavirus cases have been documented 
inside Fermi 2 during the nuclear plant’s lat-
est refueling outage. 
But owner-operator DTE Energy said it be-
lieves it has enough precautions in place now 
to complete the work and get the plant re-
started in the coming weeks. 
In a statement, DTE spokesman Stephen 
R. Tait said the company ‘‘can confirm that 
we have had employees test positive, but are

not giving out numbers, locations or names 
at this time.’’ 
Media reports showed the first worker test-
ed positive about the same time the refuel-
ing outage began on March 21. A Detroit tel-
evision station reported at least two more 
positive cases were documented within days 
of that. 
DTE won’t say for the record when it ex-
pects to complete Fermi 2’s outage. 
But many similar operations—which once 
took six weeks or longer—have been short-
ened to about a month in recent years. Utili-
ties lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
potential electricity sales each day nuclear 
plants sit idle. 
Nuclear plants are refueled every 18 to 24 
months, depending on the type of uranium 
used in their reactor cores. 
Fermi 2, located along western Lake Erie 
in northern Monroe County’s Frenchtown 
Township, is one of many nuclear plants 
across the United States scheduled to be re-
fueled during the spring or fall of 2020, the 
two seasons when demand for electricity is 
lowest. 
Energy Harbor’s Davis-Besse nuclear plant 
along the Lake Erie shoreline in rural Ot-
tawa County recently completed its latest 
refueling. 
Both plants are about 30 miles from down-
town Toledo. 
The coronavirus pandemic has, of course, 
complicated those efforts this year. 
To help keep refuelings on schedule, the 
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission last 
month allowed for an exemption from rules 
which limit the number of consecutive hours 
workers are allowed to be inside the plant at 
a time. The agency said in a March 28 letter 
to the Washington-based Nuclear Energy In-
stitute that it will consider such requests on 
a case-by-case basis, and that exemptions 
will be limited to 60 days. 
‘‘We are aware of the NRC’s willingness to 
relax some rules for overtime at plants if 
there is a need,’’ Mr. Tait said. ‘‘At this 
time, we have not requested any variances.’’ 
The NRC has ‘‘no immediate concerns in 
this area,’’ Viktoria Mitlyng, agency spokes-
man, said. ‘‘We are communicating regularly 
with Fermi staff to discuss current activities 
and future plans, including staffing, medical 
screening, reductions in nonessential main-
tenance work, and other related matters.’’ 
In nearly all refuelings, including at those 
at Fermi 2 and Davis-Besse, hundreds of spe-
cialized, out-of-state contractors augment 
the regular plant workforces, often resulting 
in 1,000 or more workers assigned to any 
given site at a time. Work is usually divided 
into eight-hour shifts, with activity occur-
ring 24 hours a day. 
Officials have noted those contractors 
move throughout the country from job to 
job, bringing with them the potential of car-
rying viruses outside of the sites they last 
worked. 
Monroe-area resident Michael J. Keegan, a 
longtime activist associated with the activ-
ist group Don’t Waste Michigan, said he wor-
ries the NRC will again allow DTE to post-
pone some of the work planned for the sub-
merged portion of Fermi 2’s pressure sup-
pression chamber, also referred to as the 
torus. 
The utility came to an agreement with the 
NRC to fix degraded coating there, a situa-
tion that has lingered for 31 years. It was 
first identified in 1989, the NRC has said. 
One of the concerns is that loose paint 
chips in drains could make it difficult for 
vital reactor coolant pumps to move water 
in the event of an emergency. 
The NRC told DTE it will grant the util-
ity’s request to remove only coatings found 
to be degraded through inspections. 
‘‘If degraded coating is found, they will re-
move it prior to returning the reactor to op-
eration after the spring 2020 outage,’’ Ms. 
Mitlyng said. 
Fermi 2, one of Michigan’s largest employ-
ers, is about 30 miles south of Detroit, which 
is now one of America’s hot spots for the 
coronavirus pandemic.

ALL THREE DETROIT AUTOMAKERS HAD WORK-
ERS TEST POSITIVE
FOR COVID–19 SINCE 
PLANTS REOPENED 
DETROIT.—In the week since U.S. auto fac-
tories reopened after coronavirus lockdowns, 
workers at all three Detroit automakers 
have tested positive for COVID–19 but only 
Ford Motor Co has temporarily closed 
plants. 
The U.S. auto industry reopened many 
plants last week after a two-month shut-
down due to the global pandemic. To ensure 
safety during the outbreak, companies im-
posed new safety measures, including screen-
ing employees, use of face masks and social 
distancing. 
Ford paused production at its Claycomo, 
Missouri, plant for an hour on Tuesday after 
a worker tested positive. Work resumed at 
the plant, which builds the F–150 pickup 
truck and Transit van, without workers 
being sent home following a deep cleaning, 
Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said Wednes-
day. 
General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Auto-
mobiles NV (FCA) said Wednesday they have 
had workers test positive since the restart, 
but have not been forced to idle plants. They 
did not disclose the number of workers af-
fected. 
On Wednesday, a union leader at Ford’s 
Kentucky Truck Plant said on Twitter a 
worker there tested positive, but had not 
worked since May 21. Felker said the plant 
never closed. 
Last week, Ford closed two assembly 
plants, due to a positive test at its Dearborn, 
Michigan, factory and a parts shortage due 
to a positive test at a supplier that closed 
the Chicago plant. It had marked the second 
consecutive day for closures in Chicago fol-
lowing two positive tests. 
United Auto Workers Local 600, which rep-
resents hourly workers in Dearborn, last 
week demanded testing for every worker 
there and that Ford shut down the plant for 
24 hours after a positive test. Ford said the 
safety of its workers is a top priority and 
cited the safety measures it has developed in 
conjunction with the UAW. 
In Mexico, Ford told workers it was tar-
geting a May 28 restart at its Hermosillo 
plant. GM and FCA have restarted oper-
ations in Mexico.

THE REOPENING OF VANCOUVER, WASH., IS ON 
HOLD
AS 65 WORKERS TEST POSITIVE
FOR 
COVID–19 AT A FRUIT PROCESSING FACILITY 
(By Tess Riski) 
Clark County’s application to move into 
Phase 2 of reopening has been put on pause. 
The COVID–19 outbreak at a fruit proc-
essing plant in Vancouver, Wash., climbed 
from 38 workers Friday to 65 employees Mon-
day. The Oregonian first reported. 
The 
facility, 
called 
Firestone 
Pacific 
Foods, halted production May 19. On May 23, 
Washington state health officials suspended 
Clark County’s request to enter Phase 2 of 
the state’s reopening plan due to the out-
break. 
The state health department cited the 
Firestone outbreak as its reason for sus-
pending Vancouver’s reopening. 
The county health department said in a 
press release Saturdav that it is identifying 
and notifying close contacts of all who test-
ed positive and asking them to quarantine 
for 14 days. 
Firestone processes frozen fruit mostly 
berries. Food processing plants have been 
epicenters of COVID–19 outbreaks across the 
U.S., in part because social distancing is dif-
ficult on assembly-line floors. 
The facility told The Oregonian it’s un-
aware of any workers who have been hos-
pitalized because of the virus. 
‘‘While this outbreak is unfortunate, our 
response demonstrates we have the con-
fidence and capability to respond to situa-
tions like this,’’ Dr. Alan Melnick, the Clark 
County health officer, said in a press release.

‘THIS IS NOT THE HUNGER GAMES’: NATIONAL 
TESTING STRATEGY DRAWS CONCERNS 
(By Apoorva Mandavilli and Catie 
Edmondson) 
The Trump administration’s new testing 
strategy, released Sunday to Congress, holds 
individual states responsible for planning 
and carrying out all coronavirus testing, 
while planning to provide some supplies 
needed for the tests. 
The proposal also says existing testing ca-
pacity, if properly targeted, is sufficient to 
contain the outbreak. But epidemiologists 
say that amount of testing is orders of mag-
nitude lower than many of them believe the 
country needs. 
The report cements a stance that has frus-
trated governors in both parties, following 
the 
administration’s 
announcement 
last 
month that the federal government should 
be considered ‘‘the supplier of last resort’’ 
and that states should develop their own 
testing plans. 
‘‘For months, it was a tennis game, it was 
going back and forth between the feds and 
the states, and it’s now landed with the 
states,’’ said Scott Becker, executive direc-
tor of the Association of Public Health Lab-
oratories. 
Mr. Becker noted that the federal govern-
ment plans to distribute some testing sup-
plies, including swabs and viral transport 
media, and to store test kits in the strategic 
national stockpile. ‘‘That’s actually quite 
significant,’’ he said. ‘‘That’s a positive 
step.’’ 
The Department of Health and Human 
Services prepared the strategy, which meets 
requirements under the Paycheck Protection 
Program and Health Care Enhancement Act, 
signed into law by President Trump on April 
24, that federal agencies come up with a stra-
tegic testing plan within 30 days. It was re-
ported earlier by The Washington Post. 
Mr. Becker, public health experts and 
Democratic leaders panned the proposal, say-
ing the strategy runs the risk of states com-
peting with one another and may create deep 
inequities among them. 
The strategy mirrors a divide that has 
played out in Congress for months. As they 
negotiated the virus relief bill in March, 
Democratic lawmakers pushed to require the 
administration to submit this national test-
ing plan to Congress. Republicans resisted, 
saying those decisions belonged to each 
state. 
Mr. Becker and others said it’s reasonable 
to expect states to implement some aspects 
of the testing, such as designating test sites. 
But acquiring tests involves reliance on na-
tional and international supply chains— 
which are challenging for many states to 
navigate. 
‘‘That’s our biggest question, that’s our 
biggest concern, is the robustness of the sup-
ply chain, which is critical,’’ Mr. Becker 
said. ‘‘You can’t leave it up to the states to 
do it for themselves. This is not the Hunger 
Games.’’

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2351 
May 28, 2020 
In a joint statement on Monday, Speaker 
Nancy Pelosi; Senator Chuck Schumer, the 
Democratic leader; Representative Frank 
Pallone, Democratic chairman of the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee; and Sen-
ator Patty Murray, the ranking Democrat on 
the Senate’s health committee, said the 
Trump administration was not taking re-
sponsibility for ramping up national testing 
capacity. 
‘‘This disappointing report confirms that 
President Trump’s national testing strategy 
is to deny the truth that there aren’t enough 
tests and supplies, reject responsibility and 
dump the burden onto the states,’’ the law-
makers said. ‘‘In this document, the Trump 
administration again attempts to paint a 
rosy picture about testing while experts con-
tinue to warn the country is far short of 
what we need.’’ 
Experts also took issue with the report’s 
assertion that continuing to test only about 
300,000 people a day, by targeting only those 
likely to be positive, would be enough to 
contain the outbreak. 
‘‘On the face of it, the idea that 300,000 
tests a day is enough for America is absurd,’’ 
said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard 
Global Health Institute. 
He offered a quick rundown of the numbers 
to illustrate the estimate’s inadequacy. Most 
hospitals nationwide now test everyone who 
is admitted for any reason, roughly 100,000 
tests each day, fearing that they may be 
asymptomatic and yet still spreading the 
virus. Testing the 1.6 million residents of 
nursing homes—known to be at high risk of 
coronavirus infection—and workers every 
two weeks would require 150,000 more tests 
each 
day. 
Add 
high-risk 
places 
like 
meatpacking plants that need regular test-
ing, and the numbers rapidly build. 
‘‘Without having tested a single person for 
symptoms of Covid, we would quickly ex-
haust our entire national supply of testing if 
all we have is 300,000 tests per day,’’ he said. 
The H.H.S. report noted that an analysis 
by the Safra Center at Harvard estimated 
the need at more than three million tests per 
day. But the federal report said that esti-
mate was based on faulty assumptions. 
The Safra authors who crafted the esti-
mate said that the federal report had cherry- 
picked one simple example from their anal-
ysis without considering other evidence. 
‘‘We ran multiple models, all of which 
pointed to the same order of magnitude,’’ 
said Danielle Allen, director of the Safra 
Center. ‘‘They’ve selected one non-primary 
model in an appendix and selectively ad-
justed assumptions to generate a different 
number.’’ 
Dr. Allen said millions of daily tests would 
be required to have 4 percent of people test 
positive with the coronavirus—the level they 
say is needed to halt the spread of the virus. 
The administration’s target, 10 percent, 
would allow only for mitigation. 
‘‘There is not a single country that I’m 
aware of that achieved disease suppression 
with a positivity rate of 10 percent,’’ she 
said. 
And 300,000 daily tests would be insuffi-
cient even for mitigation, Dr. Jha said, esti-
mating that would require at least 900,000 
tests per day. 
The proposal also leaves it to states to 
plan for contact tracing and isolation, rap-
idly identify new clusters of coronavirus in-
fection and adopt new technologies. It says 
the federal government is ‘‘supporting and 
encouraging’’ states to rely heavily on guid-
ance from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention. 
However, the C.D.C. has been slow to re-
lease guidance for states during this out-
break, Dr. Jha said. And the agency fumbled 
its role in testing strategy, most recently 
with last week’s dust-up over the mixing of 
test results for active infection with serol-
ogy. ‘‘This is not C.D.C.’s shining moment,’’ 
he said. 
Governors have bristled at claims from the 
administration that the supply of tests was 
adequate, routinely asking for more federal 
assistance. Some states have ultimately de-
cided to negotiate directly with suppliers to 
obtain test kits. 
Federal virus relief legislation required 
states to release their individual testing 
plans last week, but they requested an exten-
sion to later this week. If elements of those 
state plans prove promising, Mr. Becker said, 
the federal strategy could be revised or 
merged with them.

CORONAVIRUS TESTING IS ‘A MESS’ IN THE US, 
REPORT SAYS 
(By Maggie Fox) 
Coronavirus testing in the United States is 
disorganized and needs coordination at the 
national level, infectious disease experts said 
in a new report released Wednesday. 
Right now, testing is not accurate enough 
to use alone to make most decisions, includ-
ing who should go back to work or to school, 
the team at the University of Minnesota 
said. 
‘‘It’s a mess out there,’’ Mike Osterholm, 
head of the university’s Center for Infectious 
Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), 
which issued the report, told CNN. 
‘‘Testing is very, very important, but we’re 
not doing the right testing.’’ 
The number of tests that have been com-
pleted—numbers widely reported by states 
and by the White House—show only part of 
the picture, the report reads. 
‘‘The data is really kind of screwed up,’’ 
Osterholm said. ‘‘It’s because the public 
health system is overwhelmed.’’ 
The report has some specific recommenda-
tions for diagnostic tests that check to see if 
someone 
is 
currently 
infected 
with 
coronavirus. 
Testing is most useful for clinical care of 
patients, for disease surveillance and contact 
tracing and for monitoring frontline workers 
such as emergency responders, doctors and 
nurses who may have been exposed, the re-
port recommends. People with symptoms 
should also be tested, it says. 
But coronavirus testing is not accurate 
enough yet to use in many other ways, the 
CIDRAP team said. 
It recommends against: 
Universal testing in hospital settings 
Testing in schools or other low-risk set-
tings 
Widespread community-based testing 
Antibody tests to decide who goes back to 
work 
Immunity passports 
It might be useful to test asymptomatic 
people in long-term care facilities in some 
cases because they are likely to have many 
cases, the report said. ‘‘Asymptomatic shed-
ding of the virus may be detected with a mo-
lecular test (which looks for the virus itself) 
or an antigen test (which looks for impor-
tant pieces of the virus). It is not yet clear 
where, when and how asymptomatic individ-
uals should be tested.’’ 
The report also says that antibody tests 
should be used only with caution. These 
tests check the blood for evidence of an im-
mune response to the virus, and indicate 
that someone has been infected for some 
days or has even cleared an infection. They 
are most useful for identifying donors of 
plasma used to treat patients or for deciding 
on how to manage patients when standard 
diagnostic tests are negative, the report 
says. 
It’s not clear if antibody tests are useful 
for testing of health care workers to deter-
mine immune status, according to the re-
port. 
‘‘We 
believe 
that 
greatly 
expanding 
SARSCoV–2 testing is a critical element in 
our response to COVID–19,’’ the report reads. 
‘‘For testing to be maximally effective, co-
ordination across the system and across ju-
risdictions is necessary. Ideally, this re-
quires federal guidance, leadership and sup-
port, with strong jurisdictional buy-in at the 
state and local levels.’’ 
The report calls on the US Department of 
Health and Human Services to appoint a 
panel to oversee and organize testing. ‘‘The 
panel should include representatives from 
public health, clinical laboratory, and medi-
cine; the laboratory testing research and de-
velopment, marketing, and product support 
industries; ethicists; legal scholars; and 
elected officials,’’ it says. 
Osterholm noted that some states are com-
bining data from diagnostic tests and anti-
body tests to make estimates about how 
many people have been infected. The Food 
and Drug Administration advises against 
using 
tests 
in 
this 
way 
and 
so 
does 
Osterholm. ‘‘You need to do the right test at 
the right time to get the right result,’’ he 
said. ‘‘Nobody is thinking through that.’’ 
Plus, there’s not enough coordination to 
ensure that states have the testing supplies 
they need. This is a system and if a system 
breaks down anywhere, it breaks down ev-
erywhere,’’ Osterholm said. 
‘‘What good are the test results if you 
can’t trust them?’’

AS MEATPACKING PLANTS REOPEN, DATA 
ABOUT WORKER ILLNESS REMAINS ELUSIVE 
(By Michael Corkery, David Yaffe-Bellany 
and Derek Kravitz) 
The Smithfield Foods plant in Tar Heel, 
N.C., is one of the world’s largest pork proc-
essing facilities, employing about 4,500 peo-
ple and slaughtering roughly 30,000 pigs a 
day at its peak. 
And like more than 100 other meat plants 
across the United States, the facility has 
seen a substantial number of coronavirus 
cases. But the exact number of workers in 
Tar Heel who have tested positive is any-
one’s guess. 
Smithfield would not provide any data 
when asked about the number of illnesses at 
the plant. Neither would state or local 
health officials. 
‘‘There has been a stigma associated with 
the virus,’’ said Teresa Duncan, the director 
of the health department in Bladen County, 
where the plant is located. ‘‘So we’re trying 
to protect privacy.’’ 
Along with nursing homes and prisons, 
meatpacking facilities have proven to be 
places where the virus spreads rapidly. But 
as dozens of plants that closed because of 
outbreaks begin reopening, meat companies’ 
reluctance to disclose detailed case counts 
makes it difficult to tell whether the con-
tagion is contained or new cases are emerg-
ing even with new safety measures in place. 
The Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion 
said 
there 
were 
nearly 
5,000 
meatpacking workers infected with the virus 
as of the end of last month. But the non-
profit group Food & Environment Reporting 
Network estimated last week that the num-
ber has climbed to more than 17,000. There 
have been 66 meatpacking deaths, the group 
said. 
And the outbreaks may be even more ex-
tensive. 
For weeks, local officials received con-
flicting signals from state leaders and 
meatpacking companies about how much in-
formation to release, according to internal

emails from government health agencies ob-
tained through public records requests by 
Columbia University’s Brown Institute for 
Media Innovation and provided to The New 
York Times. The mixed messages left many 
workers and their communities in the dark 
about the extent of the spread in parts of 
Iowa, Nebraska and Colorado. 
The emails also reveal the deference some 
county officials have shown toward the giant 
meatpacking companies and how little power 
they have in pushing the companies to stem 
outbreaks. 
‘‘Bad news spreads way faster than the 
truth,’’ said a county health official in Colo-
rado of an outbreak at a Cargill plant, ac-
cording to notes from a conference call last 
month. ‘‘At this point, we are not doing any-
thing to cast them in a bad light. Will not 
throw them to the Press.’’ 
Questions about the transparency of gov-
ernments 
and 
companies 
about 
the 
coronavirus extend far beyond meatpacking. 
Chinese officials have been widely criticized 
for not fully disclosing the extent of the 
virus’s spread within their borders. And in 
the United States, President Trump has 
questioned the official death toll from the 
coronavirus, suggesting that the numbers 
may be inflated even as public health experts 
and statisticians say the opposite is more 
likely true. 
The meat companies are not legally re-
quired to disclose how many workers are 
sick. But legal experts say privacy is not a 
valid reason for keeping the numbers from 
the public. 
‘‘Alerting a community about the number 
of cases in a particular place is a standard 
public 
health 
response;’ 
said 
Nicole 
Huberfeld, a public health expert at Boston 
University. ‘‘People need to act appro-
priately if they are exposed.’’ 
The lack of full disclosure also dem-
onstrates the industry’s sway as a major em-
ployer in the Midwest and the South. 
While more than 80 percent of beef and 
pork workers are unionized, even labor lead-
ers acknowledge it is not as easy to shut 
down meat plants as other factories because 
they are essential to the food supply. Auto 
plants, for example, were shut down rel-
atively early during the pandemic and have 
only just begun to reopen. 
After some slaughterhouses did close, res-
taurants and stores experienced significant 
shortages of meat, leading Mr. Trump to 
issue an executive order designating meat 
plants ‘‘critical infrastructure’’ that must 
stay open. 
But the order did not address crucial issues 
like testing, leading many companies to re-
open plants or keep them operating without 
fully assessing whether employees had con-
tracted the virus. 
Across the country, many local health de-
partments have encouraged companies to 
test employees—but stopped short of order-
ing them to do so. 
On April 21, health officials in Dallas Coun-
ty, Iowa, told Tyson Foods that they could 
provide rapid testing kits for workers at its 
local plant in Perry, according to the emails. 
An early draft of that message to Tyson 
managers underscored the urgency, saying, 
‘‘At this time, we strongly recommend this 
option be implemented immediately.’’ 
But the county’s lawyer asked that the 
language be revised to read, ‘‘At this time, 
we ask you to consider this be implemented 
as soon as possible.’’ 
In an interview, the county attorney, 
Chuck Sinnard, said he recommended revis-
ing the language because he did not believe 
the health department had the authority to 
order Tyson to conduct tests. 
‘‘It was in the vein of choosing wording 
cautiously and conservatively so we didn’t 
get in a position where we were overstepping 
our bounds,’’ he said. 
On May 5, the state health department, 
which ultimately worked with Tyson to test 
employees, said 730 workers, or 58 percent of 
the plant’s work force, had tested positive 
for the virus. About two weeks ago, Tyson 
started 
to 
disclose 
the 
number 
of 
coronavirus cases at a handful of its plants 
around the country where there has been 
widespread testing. 
In North Carolina, workers and community 
advocates in the Tar Heel area started to 
raise the alarm in April, as local news out-
lets reported a string of infections linked to 
the Smithfield plant. 
In neighboring Robeson County, 59 resi-
dents who work at the Tar Heel facility have 
become infected, out of a total of 669 cases in 
the community, according to Melissa Pack-
er, the county’s assistant health director. 
But like the rest of the public, Ms. Packer 
does not know the full extent of the out-
break at the plant. 
In conversations with state officials this 
month, Ms. Packer said, a number of county 
health directors requested that plantspecific 
numbers stay private. One of the reasons, she 
said, was that the local officials wanted to 
avoid antagonizing the meatpackers while 
they worked alongside them to curtail the 
outbreaks. 
‘‘A lot of the concerns were around frac-
tured 
relationships,’’ 
Ms. 
Packer 
said. 
‘‘Some local health directors from the coun-
ties where there are processing plants ex-
pressed some concerns about how that may 
negatively impact the relationship they have 
built with the management of the compa-
nies.’’ 
A 
spokeswoman 
for 
North 
Carolina’s 
health department, Amy Ellis, declined to 
reveal plant-specific data. She said the state 
has recorded a total of 1,952 cases across 
meat plants in 17 counties. 
Smithfield said it continued to ‘‘report all 
Covid–19 cases to state and local health offi-
cials, as well as the C.D.C.’’ and was working 
to provide free testing to all its employees. 
This month, Gov. Pete Ricketts of Ne-
braska announced that the state would not 
disclose the number of coronavirus cases in 
specific meat plants without the consent of 
the companies. The state is releasing aggre-
gate case numbers across the meat proc-
essing industry, the governor’s spokesman 
said. Some of Nebraska’s big meatpackers 
have also started revealing less about case 
numbers to their employees. 
Eric Reeder, a local union president rep-
resenting workers in 14 plants around Ne-
braska, said that the larger the outbreak, 
the less transparent some of the companies 
have become about the case numbers. 
‘‘When a plant hits several hundred cases, 
they get more tight-lipped, and that makes 
it difficult for workers to protect themselves 
and their families,’’ said Mr. Reeder, presi-
dent of the United Food & Commercial 
Workers union local 293. 
Those transparency issues were on display 
last month when Teresa Anderson, the direc-
tor of the Central District Health Depart-
ment in Grand Island, Neb., told the meat 
processor JBS that she planned to conduct 
coronavirus testing at a park near the com-
pany’s plant, which employs 3,700 people. 
JBS wanted assurances that the test re-
sults would not be made public. 
‘‘We understand that you will be asking 
and 
recording 
the 
employer,’’ 
Nicholas 
White, a compliance official at JBS, wrote in 
an email to Ms. Anderson on April 15. ‘‘But 
we would ask that you not disclose that in-
formation as part of any public disclosure of 
the testing results.’’ 
Six days later, though, Ms. Anderson an-
nounced that more than 200 people connected 
to the Grand Island plant were infected. By 
May 5, at least 328 employees had tested 
positive, according to the emails from Grand 
Island, some of which were previously re-
ported by ProPublica. 
A spokesman for JBS, Cameron Bruett, 
said the company did not want to publicize 
the number of positive cases at the plant be-
cause little testing was being conducted in 
the broader area. Releasing the data, he said, 
‘‘would distort any one company’s role in 
community spread.’’ 
The tussle over whether plants should test 
workers has stretched for months in some 
states, creating critical delays in isolating 
infected workers. Local health authorities 
concede that asymptomatic employees are 
still coming to work with the virus, fueling 
the spread. 
As recently as May 14, health officials in 
Wyandotte County, Kan., warned that the 
virus was continuing to spread inside a Na-
tional Beef plant. 
‘‘The outbreak has gone on for a month,’’ 
a county epidemiologist said in an email to 
her colleagues. 
‘‘Should we bust in, show our badges and 
test everyone?’’ a colleague suggested. ‘‘Ha!’’ 
A National Beef spokesman said the com-
pany was following the county’s health 
guidelines. 
Even when case numbers are disclosed, 
many health departments say they have lit-
tle authority to act at meat plants. 
Last month, a worker in a Triumph Foods 
pork plant in St. Joseph, Mo., emailed the 
city saying at least two employees were in-
fected and 90 percent of the staff was still 
working ‘‘less than a meter away’’ from one 
another. 
‘‘Workers are scared,’’ the employee said. 
‘‘Can the government take action on the 
matter for the protection of workers and the 
city?’’ 
A health official wrote back on April 21, 
saying the city had ‘‘limited authority’’ in 
closing a business and suggested that the 
workers cover their noses and mouths and 
use hand sanitizer. 
Since then, Triumph has supplied workers 
with masks, among other protective meas-
ures, according to the company website. But 
at the time, the plant worker was not com-
forted by the city’s assurances. 
‘‘Are you telling me that it doesn’t matter 
that two workers are infected,’’ he wrote. 
‘‘Because the plant is worth more than the 
workers’ health?’’ 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, test-
ing requires a national strategy, not a 
50–State, helter-skelter search for lim-
ited supplies. Without rigorous ex-
panded 
surveillance 
testing, 
many 
more American lives are put on the 
chopping block because of pure stu-
pidity and callousness. 
If the President can find billions to 
build more nuclear weapons, then sure-
ly we can find the money to protect 
those who build them and all workers 
who dedicate their talents to moving 
our Nation to full throttle again. 
Mr. President, get a testing regimen 
in place. It is your duty. No excuses. 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. Mem-
bers are reminded to address their re-
marks to the Chair.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2353 
May 28, 2020 
Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Speaker, as 
America opens up and we go over 
100,000 deaths attributed to the COVID, 
it is important that we look at all our 
options to reduce the number of deaths 
related to this disease. 
I feel the government is leaving too 
much to the pharmaceutical industry 
to develop a vaccine. Well, the answer 
may be a more natural one and one 
that is a lot cheaper for the American 
public. 
Madam Speaker, I strongly believe 
that we should be looking more at the 
benefits of vitamin D. Vitamin D is 
from the Sun. It is free. I encourage 
people to ignore the politicians who 
say you have to spend all day indoors, 
but get out and grab the Sun. 
We have been told since we were chil-
dren that you get vitamin D from the 
Sun, and that is the way you stay 
healthy. If you can’t grab the rays, 
grab some vitamin D pills. That is an-
other way to get your vitamin D. 
It is not just me saying it. I encour-
age folks back home to Google ‘‘North-
western University vitamin D,’’ or 
‘‘Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, vi-
tamin D,’’ and you will see there are a 
lot of experts outside of the CDC who 
are already pushing it. 
Madam Speaker, I encourage people 
to use that method to keep the number 
of deaths from COVID down. 
f 
COVID–19 ON THE NAVAJO NATION 
(Mr. LUJA´ N asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. LUJA´ N. Madam Speaker, since 
the beginning of this crisis, I have 
heard from Tribal leaders about the 
human tragedy of COVID–19 on the 
Navajo Nation: whole families ravaged 
by the disease, doctors overwhelmed by 
the surging cases, and insufficient Fed-
eral help. 
These leaders are sounding the alarm 
for a community in crisis, and I have 
been working to ensure the medical 
professionals who serve the Navajo Na-
tion have every tool at their disposal 
to treat patients and protect them-
selves. 
But instead of doing right by the 
Navajo Nation, this administration, 
ProPublica found, awarded a $3 million 
contract for personal protective equip-
ment to an 11-day-old company headed 
by a former White House staffer. As a 
result, the IHS received hundreds of 
thousands of masks that may be un-
suitable for medical use. 
This lack of leadership endangers 
lives. That is why I am working with 
the New Mexico delegation and our col-
leagues from Arizona to hold the 
Trump administration accountable. 
The Navajo Nation deserves the full 
support of the Federal Government 
during this crisis and not to have this 
administration turn a blind eye while 
the Nation loses one more parent, 
grandparent, son, or daughter. This ad-
ministration must act as an honest 
partner to the Navajo people, and I will 
fight to ensure that happens. 
f 
HISTORIC FLOODING IN MID- 
MICHIGAN 
(Mr. MOOLENAAR asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. MOOLENAAR. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to pay tribute to the first re-
sponders, emergency officials, and the 
people of mid-Michigan for their swift 
action, heroic work, and incredible 
compassion in responding to the flood-
ing in our region last week. 
In the face of the COVID–19 pan-
demic, historic rain, and the failure of 
two dams, they quickly and safely 
evacuated more than 11,000 people 
without a single death or injury and 
provided shelter for those who were 
displaced. 
I have been on the ground meeting 
with residents who have been affected, 
especially in Sanford, which took the 
hardest hit from this heartbreaking 
event. Residents have lost businesses, 
homes, and cherished family posses-
sions. 
In the face of these challenges, our 
community is coming together. We are 
grateful for the overwhelming support 
that has come from across the State 
and from nonprofits and businesses. My 
colleagues here in Congress have also 
reached out to me, and I appreciate 
their kind words and offers of assist-
ance. 
Madam Speaker, today, I say thank 
you to everyone in mid-Michigan and 
across the country for their support 
during this challenging time. 
f 
IN RECOGNITION OF KENNY 
BELKNAP 
(Mrs. LEE of Nevada asked and was 
given permission to address the House 
for 1 minute and to revise and extend 
her remarks.) 
Mrs. LEE of Nevada. Madam Speak-
er, on behalf of Nevada’s Third Dis-
trict, I rise today to recognize Mr. 
Kenny Belknap, an honors and AP gov-
ernment teacher at Del Sol Academy. 
For decades, Clark County school-
teachers have been forced to work with 
a tight budget. Like Mr. Belknap told 
me: ‘‘We’re just trying to keep our 
head above water.’’ 
He is used to parsing materials and 
assigning two students to one textbook 
as they fight for space in an over-
crowded 
classroom. 
And, 
unfortu-
nately, that was before the COVID–19 
pandemic. 
The 
economic 
fallout 
of 
the 
coronavirus crisis is devastating State 
and local governments. In my home 
State of Nevada, the Clark County 
School District is expecting budget 
cuts of $38 million this year alone. It is 
classes like Mr. Belknap’s that will 
hurt the most from this loss. 
Congress can help by prioritizing 
Federal funding to States, towns, and 
communities to relieve budget short-
falls so our education, healthcare, and 
public services don’t suffer. 
Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues 
to help our States and local commu-
nities and give teachers like Mr. 
Belknap a chance to give his students 
the opportunities they deserve. 
f 
RECOGNIZING AMERICANS LOST 
TO COVID–19 
(Mr. SOTO asked and was given per-
mission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SOTO. Madam Speaker, today we 
mourn the lives of over 100,000 Ameri-
cans who lost their lives and pray for 
the recovery of over 1.75 million Ameri-
cans infected by COVID–19. This rep-
resents an unimaginable pain, but the 
numbers really don’t tell the story. I 
want to take a moment to describe 
four central Floridians we lost by this 
pandemic: 
Rob Carlos, Poinciana, a retired Dis-
ney cast member known as Pirate Bob; 
Dr. Neil Powell, Orlando, an Air 
Force veteran and dentist who made 
central Florida smile brighter; 
Bill Smith of Lake Wales, an elec-
trician 
who 
worked 
on 
national 
launchpads and the Magic Kingdom; 
And Virgilio Germa´n of Kissimmee, a 
retired carpenter, who loved to sing 
Mexican ballads to his wife, Gigi. 
These and other stories throughout 
central Florida will continue to be in 
our hearts as we do everything we can 
to get beyond and survive this pan-
demic.

THE NEED FOR MEDICAL 
RESEARCH 
(Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SHERMAN. Madam Speaker, our 
work now is to negotiate a new relief 
bill. So far we have spent trillions of 
dollars 
bandaging 
our 
economic 
wounds, yet less than one-half of 1 per-
cent has gone to beat the disease 
through research on therapeutics and 
prophylaxes. 
All hands should be on deck. Every 
reasonable idea should be tested. But 
our professional medical researchers 
are today sitting at home because their 
non-COVID research has been sus-
pended and our COVID research fund-
ing has been modest. 
The HEROES Act provides $5.5 bil-
lion to do this medical research. That 
is the most important one-quarter of 1 
percent of that bill, and we need to 
fight to expand it in negotiations. 
Medical research is the best invest-
ment we can make for America. It is 
also the only way we are likely to pro-
vide major help for the billions of peo-
ple who live in poor countries, and it is 
the best investment that we can make 
in America’s standing in the world.

Thomas Edison looked at 3,000 dif-

STOP POLICE BRUTALITY 
(Mr. JEFFRIES asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute.) 
Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Speaker, I 
respect those police officers in every 
community who are there to protect 
and serve and those who have fallen in 
the line of duty, but we cannot tolerate 
police violence, and we cannot tolerate 
police brutality. 
George Floyd was murdered by an 
out-of-control police officer. When will 
it end? 
Amadou Diallo, 42 shots, police offi-
cers found not guilty. 
Sean Bell, 50 shots, police officers 
found not guilty. 
Eric Garner, choked to death, police 
officers let go by the grand jury. 
Decade after decade after decade, 
when will it end? 
This time must be different. Those 
perpetrators must be prosecuted to the 
full extent of the law, and Congress 
must do everything in its power to stop 
this type of tragedy from ever hap-
pening again.

WE CAN’T BREATHE 
(Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and 
was given permission to address the 
House for 1 minute and to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Madam 
Speaker, ‘‘I Can’t Breathe’’ is a poem I 
delivered on this floor 6 years ago when 
Eric Garner got choked out by the po-
lice. 
Today, I am here for George Floyd, 
another Black man who died facedown 
on the hot pavement, suffocated to 
death by a police officer as he begged 
for his life for 8 minutes. 
Black folks in America in 2020 are 
caught between being suffocated to 
death by the COVID–19 coronavirus or 
being 
choked 
to 
death 
by 
rogue, 
uncaring, and unconcerned police offi-
cers. 
Black folks in America are caught up 
in three pandemics, when you add the 
reality that our businesses are getting 
choked out of PPP. Black people bear 
an unparalleled burden in this country. 
When just 12 percent of Black and 
Latino business owners who applied for 
PPP report receiving what they asked 
for, something is wrong. 
When we make up 13 percent of the 
population but 60 percent of COVID 
deaths, something wrong. 
When we have armed vigilantes and 
rogue police officers killing us on the 
streets, something is terribly wrong. 
The American Dream should not be a 
nightmare for any of her people. It is 
time to bring an end to open season on 
Black people in America. We can’t 
breathe. 
ISSUES OF THE DAY 
The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. 
HAYES). 
Under 
the 
Speaker’s 
an-
nounced policy of January 3, 2019, the 
gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. FOR-
TENBERRY) is recognized for 60 minutes 
as the designee of the minority leader. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, I am going to remove my mask as I 
speak. We are appropriately socially 
distanced here. I am grateful for the 
time. 
Before I begin my own remarks, I am 
going to yield to the honorable gen-
tleman from Illinois (Mr. SHIMKUS), a 
senior member of the Energy and Com-
merce Committee, who will be depart-
ing from us soon. He is in his last term, 
has announced his retirement. 
It has been a pleasure to serve with 
you, my friend. We have a long way to 
go, but it is always great to see you, 
and I look forward to your remarks. 
CONGRATULATING REVEREND DR. DALE A. 
MEYER ON HIS RETIREMENT 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today to recognize the contribu-
tions of Reverend Dr. Dale A. Meyer 
upon the occasion of his retirement as 
president of Concordia Seminary in St. 
Louis. 
In May of 2005, Dr. Meyer became the 
10th president of Concordia Seminary. 
Over 15 years later, on June 30, 2020, 
Dr. Meyer will start a new season in 
life, retiring and turning over the reins 
of this beloved institution to new lead-
ership. 
His contribution to the seminary was 
immense. 
During 
his 
tenure, 
Concordia’s long-term debt was elimi-
nated, its endowment quadrupled, and 
it earned top marks from its most re-
cent 
accreditation 
by 
the 
Higher 
Learning Commission and the Associa-
tion of Theological Schools. 
From the start of his tenure to the 
end, Dr. Meyer worked alongside his 
wife, Diane; the faculty; and key staff 
to cultivate a culture that was service 
oriented and external facing. This 
meant instituting activities designed 
to instill a spirit of community vol-
unteerism 
into 
first-year 
students. 
This meant adding benches on campus 
and expanding holiday displays each 
year so visitors knew they were wel-
come at this place. 
It meant working with his wife, 
Diane, and Gayle Zollmann-Kiel, coor-
dinator of campus grounds, to create 
community gardens for people to enjoy 
all summer and fall, thereby feeding 
the community both spiritually and 
figuratively. And it meant, during the 
current pandemic, having the bell 
tower on campus play music to lift the 
spirits of all those around. 
No wonder the seminary received sev-
eral 
civic 
awards, 
including 
being 
named among the 100 Top Workplaces 
in St. Louis in 2015. 
Dr. Meyer’s retirement marks a sea-
son of change for the seminary. How-
ever, it also marks the closing of a 
chapter of a long career of service for 
him personally. 
While Dr. Meyer’s first job was help-
ing his parents, Arthur and Norma 
Meyer, deliver milk for Dixie Dairy on 
the south side of Chicago, he was called 
to serve on a full and winding profes-
sional path. This path was so full of 
wonder that he would often marvel at 
the, ‘‘milkman moments’’ that un-
folded, remarking: ‘‘What am I doing 
here? God has blessed me so.’’ 
Dr. Meyer completed his bachelor’s 
degree in 1969 at Concordia Senior Col-
lege in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and 
earned a master of divinity from 
Concordia Seminary in 1973. He earned 
a master’s degree a year later and a 
doctorate in 1986 in classical languages 
from Washington University in St. 
Louis. He also is a recipient of an hon-
orable doctor of divinity in 1993 from 
Concordia Theological Seminary in 
Fort Wayne, Indiana. 
Dr. Meyer first joined the faculty at 
Concordia Seminary as a guest instruc-
tor in 1979, going on to serve as head 
pastor of St. Salvator Lutheran Church 
in Venedy, Illinois, and St. Peter Lu-
theran Church in New Memphis, Illi-
nois, both currently in my district, and 
at Holy Cross Lutheran Church in Col-
linsville, Illinois, which is my home 
congregation. These church commu-
nities are so beloved by the Meyers 
that they continue to worship at all 
three parishes to this day. 
It was at Holy Cross Lutheran that I 
and my wife, Karen, came to know Dr. 
Meyer and his family. Our lives have 
been intertwined, to say the least: 
Diane sold us our first home; I taught 
the oldest of his two daughters, Eliza-
beth, civics at Metro East Lutheran 
High School and ran many of 5k races 
to come with his youngest daughter, 
Katie; my own children played music 
in their daughter’s wedding; and my 
wife, Karen, served as the head organ-
ist at Holy Cross with Dale; and so on. 
Dr. Meyer moved on from Holy Cross 
in 1989 after being selected to serve as 
a speaker on ‘‘The Lutheran Hour’’ 
radio program at Lutheran Hour Min-
istries. ‘‘The Lutheran Hour’’ is the 
world’s oldest continually broadcast 
gospel radio program, first airing in 
1930. 
Dr. Meyer also hosted a national tel-
evision show, ‘‘On Main Street,’’ for 
Lutheran Hour Ministries. In 2001, ‘‘On 
Main Street’’ episodes received two 
prestigious Emmy awards from the Na-
tional Academy of Television Arts and 
Sciences, St. Louis/Mid-America Chap-
ter. During this time, he took part in 
some of his favorite ‘‘milkman mo-
ments,’’ including opening both the 
U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives in prayer. 
In addition to his published writings, 
Dr. Meyer served in numerous leader-
ship practices, such as third vice presi-
dent of the Lutheran Church-Missouri 
Synod, a charter board member of the 
Association of Lutheran Older Adults, 
an honorary director of God’s Word to 
the Nations Bible Society, and as a 
board of trustee of the American Bible 
Society. 
Dr. Meyer finally returned home to 
Concordia Seminary in St. Louis in

2001, serving as the Gregg H. Benidt 
Memorial Chair in Homiletics and Lit-
erature. He became interim president 
in 2004 and the 10th president of the in-
stitution in 2005. 
For the next 15 years, he could be 
seen working on the campus grounds, 
attending ‘‘Bach at the Sem,’’ and 
strolling with Ferdie, the oversized-in- 
body-and-heart golden retriever that 
became the quasi-mascot on campus 
and, sadly, recently passed away. 
Dr. Meyer likes to tell students: ‘‘It 
is a great time to be the church.’’ As 
the world suffers greatly from the pan-
demic, we are grateful for his efforts to 
raise public servants to serve all those 
who are hurting and to share the Gos-
pel loud and clear for all to hear. 
As Dr. Meyer begins his beautiful 
journey of retirement, he will enjoy 
more time with his two grown daugh-
ters, Elizabeth, known as Lizzie, Pitt-
man and Catherine, known as Katie, 
Bailey; 
their 
spouses, 
Darren 
and 
Charles; and their five grandsons that 
he refers to as Cinco de Meyer: Chris-
tian, Connor, and Nicholas Pittman, 
and Andrew and Jacob Bailey. 
Madam Speaker, I want to personally 
thank Dr. Meyer and his wife, Diane, 
for their ministry. 
I thank Congressman FORTENBERRY 
for yielding to me. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. I thank Con-
gressman SHIMKUS, because as he was 
speaking, I was reminded of my own 
Concordia College I represent, which is 
a part of the consortium of Lutheran 
colleges, which I know is very close to 
his heart. So I thank him for men-
tioning the gentleman. 
Madam Speaker, before I begin, may 
I inquire as to the allotted amount of 
time. Is it 30 or 60 minutes? 
The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gen-
tleman was recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speak-
er, our world has changed. Who could 
imagine just 3 short months ago where 
we would be right now as this silent 
avenger has threatened life, the life 
that we knew, and we suddenly found 
ourselves quarantined in our homes 
and apartments with nowhere to go, no 
planes to catch, no appointments to 
make, just quiet isolation with family 
and neighbors across the way. 
Many friends are suffering, suffering 
unemployment or job uncertainty, or 
the impact of the sickness directly. 
The trauma of this crisis is so, so real. 
With that said, Madam Speaker, I am 
sure all of us in this body are doing 
quite a bit of reflection, adjustment, 
and alteration as we go back to what I 
call first principles, and here is an ex-
ample. 
As I was reviewing my mail recently, 
my daily mail, a gentleman wrote to 
me. He was concerned about some-
thing. It might not be about what we 
will talk in a moment, our dependence 
on China for protective equipment and 
medical supplies, it might not be the 
latest surge of the virus in cities 
throughout America, but, nonetheless, 
it was important to him that he point 
something out to me: The flag at one of 
our small post office locations is not 
flying, and it hasn’t been flying for 
some time. 
So my diligent staff actually con-
tacted the gentleman. I believe they 
reached out to the post office them-
selves, but it sat out there as a lin-
gering issue. So I decided to call the 
postmaster myself, and I apologized to 
her. I said: I know this is highly un-
usual that a Congressman would call 
you directly. 
She said: It is about the flag, isn’t it? 
I said: Yes, ma’am. 
She said: I don’t have anybody to 
help me. I have the equipment to fix it. 
The top of the pole is broken. I just 
don’t have anyone to help me. 
I said: Let’s get it fixed. 
I called our electric system. We have 
a public power system in Nebraska. 
They deal with us all the time on a 
whole variety of issues. Their response 
was: We will get it fixed. 
There are a couple of levels of issues 
here, Madam Speaker, and the reason I 
tell the story. 
First of all, it was important to that 
gentleman that that flag, which rep-
resents us all, right behind you, the 
binding notion of what it means to be 
an American, that people have fought 
and died for, the symbol of this dig-
nity, this nobility of tradition that de-
fines not only where we have been but, 
really, what we ought to strive to be. 
Maybe he didn’t think through all of 
that, but he just wanted the flag to fly 
at a government building. 
b 1615 
The postmaster had no ill will or ill 
intent, she just didn’t have any help. In 
a previous time maybe we would have 
just said, well, you need to get the pur-
chase order written, but in my own 
way, let’s just solve the problem. 
And whether it is a person who has 
had a problem with their Social Secu-
rity check or their economic stimulus 
check, or a farmer who has not been 
able to get their emergency loan, or a 
small business tripped up on some as-
pect of the Paycheck Protection Pro-
gram—which by the way, has been a bi-
partisan life-send by this body—to go 
person by person, business by business, 
I am sure that many of us have ad-
justed to the new reality of serving 
people where they are. And maybe in 
some small way in the midst of this 
trauma and crisis, this is a silver lining 
of returning back to, first, principles 
versus the abstract discussions that 
can sometimes consume us, and the 
ruckus, fighting, and pushing and shov-
ing over things that never seem to 
come to any end. 
But hanging a flag in front of a post 
office is important, because it is who 
we are and what we ought to be. And I 
want to thank that constituent for 
calling me. Of course, in a great Ne-
braska way, when I told him we got it 
fixed, he said: Well, is it an all-weather 
flag? I said: Sir, I don’t know that. We 
did what we could. 
Madam Speaker, I want to turn back 
to another set of issues that actually 
happened before coronavirus hit our 
country and hit this body as well. One 
of the most basic expectations of our 
government is the health and well- 
being of our Nation. Three months ago, 
this week, in a timely subcommittee 
hearing—I sit on the Appropriations 
Committee and two subcommittees, on 
State and Foreign Operations, and I am 
the ranking member of the Agriculture 
Subcommittee, and we have jurisdic-
tion over the Food and Drug Adminis-
tration. 
So in a timely subcommittee hear-
ing, I asked the Inspector General of 
the Department of Health and Human 
Services this question—it is a simple 
question, it is just three words—are our 
drugs safe? Four words. Are our drugs 
safe? 
This raging coronavirus has drawn 
much attention to this much over-
looked problem. And in the name of 
global profiteering, what has happened 
is that we have enabled a dangerous 
outsourcing of pharmaceutical produc-
tion to foreign countries. A significant 
portion of that outsourcing is to the 
very 
origin 
of 
the 
place 
where 
coronavirus came from, China. 
Over 80 percent of active drug ingre-
dients and 40 percent of finished drugs 
on 
the 
American 
market, 
from 
ibuprofen to reduce your fever, to anti-
biotics to treat infection, they are pro-
duced outside the United States. Even 
if we vigilantly inspect our domestic 
manufacturing processes, we cannot 
possibly get a handle on drug safety 
when our drugs are sourced from over 
150 countries, including a significant 
portion from China. 
The 
Department 
of 
Health 
and 
Human Services, HHS, has a daunting 
task in managing the spending and per-
formance of agencies that are so large 
they can be bigger than some coun-
tries’ GDP. And one of those agencies 
is the Food and Drug Administration, 
the FDA. 
There is an inherent and unfair dual-
ity, however, in how FDA’s foreign and 
domestic inspection regimes are car-
ried out. FDA inspectors routinely con-
duct surprise inspections in America to 
ensure that drug companies are pro-
ducing medicine in a clean, safe, and 
responsible manner. 
But when it comes to foreign inspec-
tions, the FDA customarily gives com-
panies advance notice, often as much 
as 12 weeks, enabling drug suppliers 
plenty of time to clean up their acts. 
This is counterproductive and it is 
wrong, and it creates an unlevel play-
ing field for companies trying to manu-
facture drugs right here in the United 
States of America. 
Compounding these problems, the 
FDA inspectors also face obstruction, 
coercion, and deception in foreign 
countries. In one case, a Chinese com-
pany reportedly imprisoned an inspec-
tor in a conference room for an hour to 
force her to destroy the photographs 
that she took of its facilities.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — HOUSE
H2356 
May 28, 2020 
Madam 
Speaker, 
this 
inadequate 
monitoring of foreign production of 
medicine, it really does have dire con-
sequences. In 2008, a tainted batch of 
the blood thinner, heparin, which is 
made in China, killed over 100 people 
worldwide, including 81 in America. It 
led to this drug’s recall. 
In August of 2018, the FDA issued an 
alert that a Chinese manufacturer of a 
thyroid medicine was recalled due to 
inconsistent quality. At this hearing 
that I am referencing with the Depart-
ment of Health and Human Service’s 
Inspector General, I asked: Why has so 
much of our drug production moved 
overseas? Why? 
Now, of course, in asking that ques-
tion, Madam Speaker, I basically knew 
the answer, it has to do with capital-
ization on low wages, lax safety, envi-
ronmental and labor standards in those 
countries. But my fuller intention in 
asking the question was to probe as to 
whether or not we have inadvertently, 
in U.S. law and regulatory structure, 
perversely encouraged offshoring. 
These troubling dynamics take on a 
special urgency given the massive 
spread of COVID–19. Several months 
ago, the FDA identified 20 drugs that 
exclusively source their active pharma-
ceutical ingredients or finished drug 
products from China. The agency then 
issued an alert that at least one Chi-
nese drugmaker had ceased production 
of a human drug due to coronavirus in-
fection at its manufacturing facilities. 
So drugs with short expiration dates 
are particularly vulnerable to these 
supply-chain disruptions. Another level 
of problem. 
So solving these issues can become 
easier when we can fully identify and 
inspect foreign sources of medicine. 
But with the bulk of our foreign drug 
supply originating from a country that 
suppressed news about the coronavirus 
origins, its severity, and its timing, 
and to this day prevents the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention 
from fully accessing the actual virus, I 
am not optimistic that we will gain 
better information. 
I get it, Madam Speaker, it is con-
venient in this moment to point a fin-
ger at China, but we have plenty to do 
in our House to restore some order 
here. The Inspector General promised 
me an answer within 2 weeks to my 
question. Do you remember what it 
was? Have we inadvertently through 
our legal or regulatory structure per-
versely incentivized the offshoring of 
drug production from America? The In-
spector General promised me an answer 
in 2 weeks. I have heard nothing yet. 
The reality here is that we have to 
change how we do public policy in our 
country, just like so many other proc-
esses—business and society are shift-
ing. Coronavirus has caused a tectonic 
plate shift. We are seeing massive 
spikes in the use of digital technology, 
which has huge implications for tele-
medicine, telework, and tele-education. 
In a bit of a silver lining in this time 
of crisis and suffering, I am frankly 
proud that this body has come together 
to protect healthcare, to protect indi-
viduals and families, and to protect 
small businesses and farmers. 
Once our body itself recovers our 
rhythm and order here, there are some 
particularly good places to start think-
ing about action around our healthcare 
security. 
So policy question one: How much of 
our drugs come from foreign sources? 
To solve this, we should enhance the 
FDA’s powers to track the ingredients. 
We should require labeling as to where 
they come from. And, third, increase 
reporting requirements for the pharma-
ceutical companies themselves, par-
ticularly within the precursor ingredi-
ents. 
Bottom line, we need clear answers 
about how we oversee the foreign pro-
duction of drugs and drug ingredients. 
We also need the right incentives to en-
sure that U.S. companies will produce 
more and more drugs and drug ingredi-
ents right here, here at home in Amer-
ica. It is about healthcare security. If 
it is made in America, we will all feel 
much better about knowing that it is 
safe. 
But going beyond these policy con-
siderations about our healthcare secu-
rity, Madam Speaker, I want to take a 
moment to possibly pull back the cur-
tain and read into what we are experi-
encing now, some future trends. It is 
not to diminish in any way the trauma, 
disruption, and suffering that has hit 
our country, but there are many open- 
ended questions that we are facing 
now. And it might be helpful to look 
into what some new realities are going 
to be in short order. 
We have adopted masks and social 
distancing. We casually use terms like 
‘‘herd 
immunity,’’ 
‘‘flattening 
the 
curve,’’ and ‘‘community spread.’’ We 
have also accepted a world with less 
noise, less urgency, but more intimate 
connection with those in our imme-
diate orbit. We wonder what we will en-
counter when the doors fully open once 
again and we are uncaged to see the 
world through an entirely new lens. 
So perhaps here is a little bit of a 
sneak peek. First, Madam Speaker, our 
relationship with work has substan-
tially changed. For those fortunate to 
still have good employment, telework 
has arrived. While many Main Street 
businesses are really hurting, many 
have also transformed themselves into 
online, brick-and-mortar hybrids. 
Like never before, people are order-
ing groceries online, medical supplies, 
and other essentials through their 
phones for pick up and delivery. Doc-
tors are seeing patients remotely. And 
in a little-known shift, we are actually 
reimbursing properly for telehealth. It 
is here to stay, and it is going to make 
some huge advances in our well-being, 
and perhaps save some funds. 
School, of course, has temporarily 
centralized in the home, reconnecting 
families in important, beautiful, excit-
ing, if not sometimes stressful ways. 
The handshake may be in decline, but 
the elbow bump, thumbs-up, and head 
nod are, of course, enjoying a renais-
sance. 
As we extrapolate from these changes 
to a world in which we are hopeful that 
better treatments are right around the 
corner, we are seeing less dependence 
on automobiles, more connectedness to 
the outdoors, an increase in victory 
gardens, and local foods. A nice side ef-
fect, nature is recovering. The air is 
cleaner. Traffic is down. Cities feel 
calmer. This reality presages the align-
ing preferences, and this is a fas-
cinating fact, the economic preference 
curves of the baby boom generation 
and the millennial generation are 
aligning for livable, walkable, nur-
turing communities. 
But even while we consider the rosier 
side of this predicament, we have ur-
gent questions. When are we getting 
back to normal? When can we hug 
those we love? When can we visit those 
incapable of visiting us? What does 
normal even mean? 
Madam Speaker, here is one aspect of 
what normal may look like. A new in-
trusive reality, I have an acronym for 
it, I call it SSTT, screening, sanita-
tion, testing and testing. 
So let’s unpack this. SSTT is a suite 
of best practices that will gradually en-
able the full reopening of our State in 
Nebraska, where I live, and our coun-
try, while ensuring those who are vul-
nerable, especially the elderly and 
those with underlying conditions, are 
fully protected. 
On screening, you will see more high- 
tech thermal scans when you enter 
large public places. As we experienced 
after 9/11 with the dramatically-en-
hanced security screening, your tem-
perature will be regularly taken. 
As for the next S, sanitation. I found 
a new respect for medical personnel 
who must wear these surgical masks 
hours on end through the day. They are 
hot. They are bothersome, as I am sure 
you can attest, Madam Speaker. But 
they are now part of the normalization 
of our own personal protective equip-
ment routines at retail establishments, 
at work, and on public transportation. 
You are already seeing the sneeze 
guards and other physical barriers at 
grocery store check-out stands. Hand 
sanitizer sales are not declining any 
time soon, as the surprisingly fragile 
COVID–19 is easily killed through basic 
hygiene and surface disinfectants. 
b 1630 
Social distancing is a subset of sani-
tation. Perhaps we should change the 
name. Perhaps we should call it social 
respect because this is what it means. 
It is an embrace of a necessary con-
straint out of concern for the public 
good, and it also lessens our own indi-
vidual vulnerability. 
When combined with advancing our 
ability to work from home if sick, 
these factors are certainly lessening 
the disease’s impact, thankfully. 
New configurations for workplace 
foot traffic and airflow will emerge as

May 28, 2020 
we embrace the need to consistently 
and vigilantly fight this virus. Look 
for TSA-style COVID prechecks at air-
ports, on trains, and at hospitals. 
Watch for new office architecture: open 
floor concepts and lunch buffets being 
out; plexiglass partitions, staggered 
desks, one-way walkways will be in. 
Zoom is the new communal coffee 
break. As offensive as this seems, look 
for social distancing monitors on ele-
vators in large office buildings. 
Again, the acronym is SSTT. The 
first ‘‘T’’ stands for testing. There will 
be a dramatic increase in onsite work 
testing. Early diagnosis of those who 
show symptoms or who have some rea-
sonableness to think they may have 
been exposed is one way to signifi-
cantly reduce the spread of the disease. 
I have been very proud to continue to 
work with the University of Nebraska 
Medical Center. During the Ebola epi-
demic, we worked with the Obama ad-
ministration to help the University of 
Nebraska Medical Center, which has a 
long history in infectious disease and 
virology, to build out containment fa-
cilities just in case Ebola would impact 
us significantly in America. 
You might recall, Madam Speaker, 
that the first coronavirus cases that 
came off the cruise ship went imme-
diately to Nebraska. Our National 
Guard hosted people. Those who needed 
to be in isolation and then those who 
needed to be quarantined who had the 
disease went to the University of Ne-
braska. That is because we have led the 
country in forward-thinking as to how 
to create the possibility of contain-
ment for some type of pandemic. 
We have a lot more to do, such as 
creating a surge hospital concept for 
our military and our country at large. 
Nonetheless, in working with the Uni-
versity of Nebraska Med Center, trying 
to think about how we just don’t sit 
back and let the sick come to us but 
that we go forward and use institutions 
that have occupational health special-
ists and larger capacities to become 
the center for controlling the diseases 
themselves in a manner that parallels 
the necessary public health response 
that is going on. 
Again, sanitation and screening are 
part of that and onsite work testing. 
The second ‘‘T’’ though in the SSTT 
is for serological testing. This test de-
termines whether you have developed 
antibodies to the virus, which are need-
ed for immunity. As we are discov-
ering, a number of people who have had 
the disease don’t have any symptoms. 
They didn’t know they had it. They 
could have antibodies, which will help 
them fight the disease, should they be 
reexposed in the future. Said another 
way, it means a person who has had the 
virus recovered, and it lessens the pos-
sibility of reinfection for them. 
Both types of testing will become 
widespread, faster, cheaper, and ordi-
nary—again, helping us control the 
spread. 
As we work toward a vaccine or effec-
tive treatment to stop the serious ef-
fects, this SSTT suite of approaches— 
again, the University of Nebraska, I am 
proud of them for developing this and 
their outreach to the community. It 
may not be a panacea, but it will give 
us the data and confidence to more 
robustly and quickly open our economy 
and gradually reduce the need for 
strict containment measures. 
It is changing a bit now, Madam 
Speaker, but on an earlier trip to D.C. 
for some votes we took several weeks 
ago in which we replenished the funds 
for the highly successful Paycheck 
Protection Program—Madam Speaker, 
if you don’t mind, I am going to divert 
for a moment because I am proud of my 
State. 
Again, this was a bipartisan airlift, 
the Paycheck Protection Program, to 
help small businesses maintain per-
sonnel on the payroll while we tried to 
get in front of the disease spread, cre-
ating a one-two simultaneous step to 
protect our healthcare system and pro-
tect our economic well-being. The Pay-
check Protection Program was vital to 
this effort, widely supported by many 
of us, as well as the replenishment. 
Nebraska has a very robust commu-
nity banking system. We worked very 
aggressively with the small business 
associations and got the word out so 
we, on a per capita basis, have the larg-
est number of loans for the Paycheck 
Protection Program, which, again, is 
so important to the well-being of our 
economic vitality as we fight our way 
through this virus. 
The point being, though, I went to 
get on the airplane, and I stood in 
Omaha Eppley Airfield and then later 
at Chicago O’Hare and witnessed this 
eerie stillness around me: vacant ter-
minals, 
closed 
businesses, 
nearly 
empty planes, a science fiction movie 
come to life. 
Madam Speaker, the Earth has really 
stood still for a moment, but perhaps 
in this stillness, just perhaps, we have 
rediscovered some important things, 
and we do see some trends that will 
mark a new way forward. 
Madam Speaker, I yield back the bal-
ance of my time. 
f 
JUSTICE FOR GEORGE FLOYD 
(Mr. MFUME asked and was given 
permission to address the House for 1 
minute and to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. MFUME. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because I want to call the name 
of George Floyd. 
George Floyd lost his life this week 
because of a Minneapolis police officer. 
George Floyd died for no known rea-
son. He was not armed. He was not in-
toxicated. He was not aggressive. And 
he was not threatening. 
George Floyd pleaded for his life. He 
cried out for help. He groaned in pain. 
And then he died with his face pressed 
against the ground and the knee of a 
police officer against his neck. 
This was not an arrest. This was 
murder. It was the murder of George 
Floyd, and it ought to be prosecuted to 
the fullest extent of the law. 
God help us as a Nation if we choose 
to be silent at this sad and tragic time.

HONORING NATIONAL FOSTER 
CARE MONTH 
HON. JOHN LEWIS 
OF GEORGIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. LEWIS. Madam Speaker, I rise in honor 
of National Foster Care Month. 
For more than thirty years, the month of 
May has given voice to the unique, often com-
plicated needs and situations of young people 
in our nation’s foster care system. Sadly, too 
many of our young people are at risk of being 
left out and left behind. The pandemic only ex-
acerbated the neglect and abuse of young 
people of all races, ages, and backgrounds in 
Georgia and across our country. 
For these reasons, it is important that, dur-
ing National Foster Care Month, we recognize 
the nearly half million children who are cur-
rently in our nation’s child welfare system. 
Madam Speaker, they must know that, despite 
all that is happening in our nation and around 
the world, I along with many other Members of 
Congress, mentors, volunteers, friends, and 
extended families love and value each and 
every young person in foster care. 
We must recommit to doing all we can to 
maximize their capacity and reaffirm our belief 
in their hopes, dreams, and aspirations. Foster 
youth must trust and know that, on the darkest 
of days, we are always in their corner, and 
they are always in our hearts and thoughts. 
We must each do our part to ensure that 
every young person and aspiring adoptive and 
foster parent is able to fulfill their dreams of a 
stable, loving family. Many adults want to 
open their homes and their hearts, but they 
face barriers because the system says that 
they practice the wrong religion, love the 
wrong person, or are not married. Many chil-
dren enter the system because of similar dis-
crimination, and some experience it while in 
public care. 
For these reasons, I am proud to sponsor 
the bipartisan Every Child Deserves a Family 
Act to end discrimination in our child welfare 
system and expand every opportunity for a 
safe, forever family. I will continue working 
with my colleagues to pass this critical legisla-
tion and provide much-needed protections for 
children and adults in the child welfare sys-
tem. 
Inspired by the experiences of many former 
foster youth in Metro Atlanta, I am deeply con-
cerned about the more than 20,000 youth who 
age out of the foster care system every year. 
Government authorities share a unique and 
distinct responsibility to support those youth 
who transition from foster care to independent 
living. Far too often, these young adults go on 
to receive less education, hold fewer jobs, ex-
perience more homelessness and housing in-
stability, and often experience imprisonment at 
higher rates than their peers who did not ex-
perience foster care. 
Federal, state, and local government have a 
moral duty to do all we can to protect and as-
sist young people during and after their transi-
tion from foster care. The current coronavirus 
pandemic exposed the difficulties that many of 
foster youth face in navigating adolescence 
and adulthood with limited support. Govern-
ment programs and authorities are often their 
only available resource, and we must do all 
we can to help restore hope and opportunities 
to young people and address the real, critical 
disparities they face prior to, during, and be-
yond this pandemic. I plan to introduce a com-
prehensive legislative package soon to do just 
that. 
During this National Foster Care Month, 
may we all be rededicated to the task of lifting 
up the young people entrusted to our nation’s 
care while preparing and enabling them to 
succeed.

COVARRUBIAS 
HON. TJ COX 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. COX of California. Madam Speaker, I 
rise today in honor of Army Specialist Juan 
Miguel Mendez Covarrubias of Hanford, Cali-
fornia, who gave his life in service to his coun-
try on March 11, 2020. While deployed in sup-
port of Operation Inherent Resolve at Camp 
Taji, Iraq, his unit was engaged by enemy in-
direct fire and he lost his life. He was 27 years 
old. 
A Central Valley native, Juan Miguel was a 
beloved son, brother, and husband. In 2018 
he married his longtime girlfriend Bianca Meza 
and that same year he enlisted in the United 
States Army as a Signal Support System Spe-
cialist. Juan Miguel was assigned to 1st Bat-
talion, 227th Aviation Regiment, 1st Air Cav-
alry Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division, Fort Hood, 
Texas. 
Juan Miguel aspired to make the world a 
better place and always pushed himself to 
lead by example. He is remembered fondly as 
someone with a big heart and who always put 
the needs of others before his own. Our nation 
has lost a great warrior. He is a true American 
Hero and his memory will live on in the hearts 
of those who love him. 
Juan Miguel’s awards and decorations in-
clude the Global War on Terrorism Medal, Na-
tional Defense Service Ribbon, and the Army 
Service Ribbon. I ask my colleagues to join 
me in a moment of remembrance for Army 
Specialist Juan Miguel Mendez Covarrubias, 
and for all those who have made the ultimate 
sacrifice for our country. 
Juan Miguel is survived by his wife Bianca, 
his mother Monica Mendez, his father Alfredo 
Covarrubias and his younger brother and sis-
ters. 
HONORING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL

HON. JENNIFFER GONZA´LEZ-COLO´ N 
OF PUERTO RICO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Miss GONZA´ LEZ-COLO´ N of Puerto Rico. 
Madam Speaker, I would like to honor the life 
and service of my friend, Michael Morales LTC 
from Naranjito, Puerto Rico who passed away 
on May 8, 2020 at the young age of forty-two. 
Michael was proud to serve his country. He 
joined the United States Air Force, serving in 
distinguished roles such as the principal man-
ager for multinational military exercises cov-
ering 32 nations across Central America, 
South America, and the Caribbean, also as in-
structor and evaluator pilot for the C–7 and C– 
130, as Commander of the 538th Air Expedi-
tionary Advisory Squadron, and as a Legisla-
tive Liaison for the Secretary of Defense on 
acquisitions and sustainment on programs for 
the new Air Force One and KC–46 air tanker 
programs. 
He also served as a Senior Advisor to 
former Small Business Administrator Linda 
McMahon and was responsible for bringing 
the Secretary to the Island for HUBZone 
events geared towards fueling small business 
growth in historically underutilized business 
zones. As a Senior Advisor to the Adminis-
trator, he also led the agency’s policy efforts 
in Puerto Rico; working closely with federal 
and local government, banking sector, and en-
trepreneurs to develop policy aimed at fos-
tering entrepreneurial repatriation, economic 
growth, and assist with the Island’s economic 
status. 
Michael lived a life of public service. Presi-
dent Woodrow Wilson once said that ‘‘You are 
not here merely to make a living. You are here 
to enable the world to live more amply, with 
greater vision, and with a finer spirit of hope 
and achievement. You are here to enrich the 
world. . .’’ Michael was the best of us, an ex-
ample to us all. 
Thank 
you, 
Michael. 
Rest 
in 
Peace. 
Descansa en Paz.

Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, as Co-Chair

today to recognize Azerbaijan on the occasion 
of its 102nd Republic Day. Azerbaijan is a crit-

Upon declaring independence in 1918,

being the first secular parliamentary democ-
racy in the Muslim world. Azerbaijan was also 
among the first states to grant women the 
right to vote. This stands as a testament to the 
Islamic world of the universal validity of demo-
cratic aspirations, and that self-government 
and the respect for individual rights is not in-
imical to their traditions. 
Unfortunately, 
Azerbaijani 
independence 
was soon snuffed out by totalitarian USSR, 
which, not unlike Russia under Vladimir Putin, 
sought to spread values much different to 
those espoused by the fledgling Azerbaijan 
Democratic Republic. After the fall of the So-
viet Union, Azerbaijan regained its independ-
ence and was recognized by the United 
States. 
Today, Azerbaijan remains a close partner 
to the United States and our allies. Not only 
has Azerbaijan been an integral part of our ef-
forts in Afghanistan, but it has also been an 
excellent partner in the wider war on terror. It 
is also noteworthy that as a Muslim country, 
Azerbaijan enjoys strong relations with the 
Jewish community and maintains a strong 
friendship with our ally Israel. Finally, Azer-
baijan is a critical energy provider for Europe, 
playing an important role helping our allies 
there diversify their energy supply away from 
a domineering Russia. 
With this partnership and Azerbaijan’s com-
mitment to our friendship in mind, I would en-
courage my colleagues to join me today in 
honoring Azerbaijan on its Republic Day.

IN MEMORY OF FORMER 
CONGRESSMAN SAM JOHNSON 
HON. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Ms. JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, 
today I rise to celebrate the life of a trusted 
colleague, dear friend, proud Texan, and true 
patriot, former Congressman Sam Johnson. 
What impressed me the most is that, after 
serving in the Air Force during the Korean and 
Vietnam Wars, Sam Johnson did not dis-
appear into what would have been a well-de-
served retirement. His love for his country and 
affinity for public service led to a fruitful career 
in the House of Representatives. Known for 
his tenacity as a legislator and shrewdness as 
a statesman, Sam Johnson certainly left his 
mark on this institution. As senior members of 
the Texas Congressional Delegation, he and I 
made progress together on important issues 
that will benefit our home state for years to 
come. 
Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Texas 
Congressional Delegation, I’d like to extend 
my sincere condolences to Sam Johnson’s 
family, friends, and loved ones during these 
trying times.

NEW SCANDAL CONFIRMATION 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, every day new evidence is revealed 
of the scandalous government spying on the 
Donald Trump Campaign and the rogue FBI 
and intelligence agencies conspiracy to sabo-
tage the Donald Trump Presidency, I include 
in the RECORD today’s revelations in the The 
Washington Times by Rowan Scarborough en-
titled ‘Tail wagging the dog’: 
Not much was going on in the Michael 
Flynn probe until The Washington Post and 
a leaker reenergized the FBI, according to a 
newly disclosed transcript of closed-door tes-
timony by former bureau Director James B. 
Comey. 
The FBI had filled out the paperwork to 
end the Flynn-Russia probe, but Mr. Comey 
halted the closing in early January 2017. 
Transcripts emerged of the incoming White 
House national security adviser talking by 
phone with Kremlin envoy Sergey Kislyak. 
The retired three-star Army general and 
Mr. Kislyak talked about not overreacting to 
economic sanctions that President Obama 
imposed on Dec. 31, 2016, in retaliation for 
Moscow’s election interference. 
Mr. Comey went to work. He provided top- 
secret call intercept material to Director of 
National Intelligence James R. Clapper, who 
told Mr. Obama. At a Jan. 5 White House 
meeting, the FBI chief and Mr. Obama again 
discussed that Flynn had talked with Rus-
sians during the transition. There is no law, 
per se, against such communications. 
And there things stood, Mr. Comey said in 
his most extensive narrative of what he did 
in the pivotal January time frame when the 
Obama team was leaving the White House to 
Donald Trump.

HONORING JUDY GEARHART 
HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to celebrate and thank Judy Gearhart 
for her leadership at the International Labor 
Rights Forum. Judy, the executive director of 
ILRF since March 2011, will retire in June. 
While she will leave that position, I know that 
she will never leave the fight to protect the 
rights of workers around the world. 
In 2013, 1,134 garment workers were killed 
and 2,500 injured as the 9-story Rana Plaza 
factory collapsed—the deadliest garment fac-
tory disaster in history. The vast majority of 
those killed and injured as a result of cor-
porate neglect were women. Like the 1911 Tri-
angle Shirtwaist Factory fire in the United 
States, the disaster spurred activists to push 
for reforms. Judy Gearhart helped lead the 
fight and won agreements with the garment in-
dustry to make improvements—although much 
progress remains to be made. I had the privi-
lege to work with Judy in the aftermath of 
Rana Plaza and have continued to support her 
and ILRF on international labor rights cam-
paigns since then. Like so many others, I have 
relied on her expertise, her experience and 
her passion for improving the lives of working 
women, men and children around the world. 
Judy has made it her practice not to pro-
mote herself, but she focused on lifting up the 
Labor Rights Defenders who are organizing 
and mobilizing every day, often at great risk to 
themselves. She has brought workers’ leaders 
to meet with members of Congress, the Ad-
ministration, the media and the public—mak-
ing sure that they have the opportunity to tell 
their own stories in their own words. She has 
spotlighted those who face violent attacks, jail 
and worse for their courage in speaking out, 
heroes 
like 
Tola 
Moeun 
in 
Cambodia, 
Mahmud Rajab in Uzbekistan and Gaspar 
Matalaev in Turkmenistan. Because of Judy 
and ILRF, there are networks of organizers 
and advocates around the world who are able 
to provide needed assistance to those fighting 
for labor rights. 
Judy’s work exemplifies the concept of 
intersectionality. She has seen that there are 
many different forces used to oppress the 
rights of workers, and she has worked to bring 
together those fighting them. Laborers in the 
fields don’t just face poor working conditions 
but live in societies rife with poverty and rac-
ism. Children in the tobacco fields are not just 
being exploited for their labor but are sub-
jected to environmental and chemical hazards. 
Women in sweatshops are not just subjected 
to poverty-level wages, they are often the tar-
get of gender-based violence and harassment. 
As a result of Judy’s leadership, last year, the 
International Labour Organization adopted a 
convention and recommendations on violence 
and harassment in the world of work. 
Judy Gearhart has done the work, at 
UNICEF’s monitoring and evaluation office, 
working on women’s rights and democratiza-
tion efforts in Mexico, with the ILO’s Inter-
national Program on the Elimination of Child 
Labor in Honduras, on developing research 
and training programs for workers at Social 
Accountability International, and, of course, at 
ILRF. Not only does she put her knowledge to 
work, she shares that knowledge through her 
teaching. She has served as a tutor for many 
of us, not just on labor policies but, more im-
portantly, about the facts on the ground. And, 
more formally, Judy is a long-time adjunct pro-
fessor at Columbia University’s School for 
International Affairs, where she teaches stu-
dents about international human rights and de-
velopment policy. 
Judy Gearhart and ILRF have stood with 
cocoa workers in Cote D’Ivoire and Ghana, 
cotton workers in Uzbekistan, garment work-
ers in Bangladesh and fruit workers in Hon-
duras. Judy has provided guidance and inspi-
ration to those struggling for fair pay and just 
treatment for their labors. For all she has 
done, and for all she will do in the future, I 
want to express my deep appreciation and 
gratitude.

REMEMBERING THE LIFE OF SAM 
FELTON 
HON. MARCY KAPTUR 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to remember the extraordinary life of Samuel 
‘‘Sam’’ Felton, Jr., one of Lorain County’s 
most honored, visible, and tireless veterans, 
and a valued father figure for his entire com-
munity. 
Sam Felton was the only person from Lorain 
County to win the Navy Cross in Vietnam. He 
never rested on his laurels and built a legacy 
of service to Lorain, Ohio. He served three 
tours of duty during the Vietnam War with the 
U.S. Marine Corps from December 1968 to 
August 1971. While serving in Vietnam, he re-
ceived both the Navy Cross for heroism and

the Purple Heart for being wounded in com-
bat. 
The Navy Cross is the second-highest deco-
ration for valor in combat in the Marines and 
U.S. Navy; fewer than 500 were awarded dur-
ing the Vietnam War. Sam earned it in June 
1969 by valiantly rescuing three wounded Ma-
rines during an 11-day battle near An Hoa, 
Qung Nam Province. 
Fifty years later, in 2019, Sam was inducted 
into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame for his 
contributions to fellow veterans, the commu-
nity, and our nation. 
Sam owned a karate academy and billiard 
parlors and worked at U.S. Steel, but his heart 
and soul was in assisting fellow veterans. In 
45 years of veteran advocacy, Sam supported 
fellow veterans as Commander and Life Mem-
ber of the Disabled American Veterans Lorain 
Chapter 20; Ohio Chairman of the Advisory 
Committee of Valor Home (a nonprofit organi-
zation providing services for homeless vet-
erans); delegate to the Lorain Veterans Coun-
cil; member, First Marine Division Association; 
member, National Association of Black Vet-
erans; co-founder and three time president of 
the Lorain Veterans Council and past com-
mander of AMVETS. Sam received the 2006 
Vietnam Service Multiple Medals Award, the 
Ohio Secretary of State’s 2007 Outstanding 
Veterans Award and was named the Lorain 
Ohio Veteran of the Year in 2010. 
In addition to dedicating himself to veterans, 
Sam advocated for the youth of Lorain Coun-
ty. He founded the Sam Felton Athletic Club 
and Youth Center, the Jackie Jones Felton 
Scholarship Fund for college-bound students, 
co-founded the Samuel Felton Jr. Community 
Development Program, and worked with kids 
and veterans interested in musical outreach. 
In 2018, the Lorain City Council named a 
section of East 36th Street ‘‘Sgt. Samuel L. 
Felton Jr. Blvd.’’ to honor Sam for his service 
to the City of Lorain and its people. For all 
these awards and acclamations Sam received, 
he will be remembered admirably by the thou-
sands of people to whom he ministered by 
providing peer support to fellow veterans, get-
ting them Veterans Affairs services, or even 
just driving veterans to their appointments. 
Truly, Sam was a national hero, and a hero of 
Lorain, Ohio. 
We offer Sam Felton’s family and friends 
our prayers and deepest hopes that they find 
comfort in the wonderful memories and lasting 
deeds of his precious life. May they find joy in 
understanding what his legacy meant to each 
person he touched and his deep dedication to 
building the people of Lorain forward.

ST. 
ANDREW 
KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS COUNCIL 
2068 
HON. JOHN JOYCE 
OF PENNSYLVANIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. JOYCE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speak-
er, it is with great pride that I congratulate the 
St. Andrew Knights of Columbus Council 2068 
on reaching its 100th anniversary. The council 
was founded on May 23, 1920 under the lead-
ership of Grand Knight FJ Foley and chaplain 
William J. O’Callahan. For a century, the St. 
Andrew Knights of Columbus Council has 
served its religious community and the 
Waynesboro region at large. 
The council’s community service includes 
participating in annual golf tournaments that 
benefit Waynesboro Human Services, spon-
soring monthly ‘‘Bring Your Mug to Church’’ 
Sundays to foster fellowship among parish-
ioners and support parish activities, as well as 
providing college scholarships to children of 
council members. Additionally, the council has 
participated in the Pennsylvania Department of 
Transportation’s Adopt-a-Highway program for 
more than 30 years. 
The St. Andrew Knights of Columbus Coun-
cil 2068 has made an indelible mark on the 
Waynesboro community. On behalf of the 13th 
Congressional District of Pennsylvania, I thank 
this organization for its steadfast commitment 
to our region and congratulate the council on 
reaching its 100th anniversary.

PROXY VOTING LAWSUIT 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, I was grateful to be added as a 
plaintiff in the important lawsuit challenging the 
constitutionality of proxy voting initiated by Re-
publican Leader KEVIN
MCCARTHY, Whip 
STEVE SCALISE, and Conference Chair LIZ 
CHENEY. Congressman MORGAN GRIFFITH, a 
graduate of Washington and Lee University 
Law School, of Virginia presented the extraor-
dinary legal arguments clearly documenting 
proxy voting as unconstitutional. 
Allowing Congress to vote remotely is sim-
ply irresponsible. Although we are currently in 
a crisis, this Wuhan Virus pandemic is no ex-
cuse to forget our Constitution which clearly 
says that we have to have a majority of Mem-
bers present for a quorum to do business. 
If Congress was able to vote on the House 
Floor over these last few months without put-
ting lives at risk, surely Members can conduct 
official business in a safe manner that follows 
guidelines from the Centers for Disease Con-
trol going forward. During the War of 1812, the 
Capitol Building itself was burned, but Con-
gress members still met in Washington. 
The constitutionality of this new rule must 
be questioned. Our constitution says that we 
must have a majority to vote and yet this new 
rule would allow a few to vote for all, that is 
simply not right. Many Americans are getting 
back to work as we recover from this Wuhan 
Virus pandemic, Congress should be no dif-
ferent.

GOOD 
SAMARITAN 
MENSTRUAL 
PRODUCTS 
ACT 
AND 
PERIOD 
POVERTY AWARENESS RESOLU-
TION 
HON. GRACE MENG 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
introduce two pieces of legislation in recogni-
tion of this week being National Period Pov-
erty Awareness Week, and today being Men-
strual Hygiene Day. 
Madam Speaker, more than half of the U.S. 
population will likely menstruate every month 
for decades of their lives. Unfortunately, stud-
ies have shown that 1 in 4 women and girls 
report that they struggle to afford menstrual 
products. This lack of menstrual products is 
often called ‘‘period poverty,’’ and it can ad-
versely affect a person’s health and well- 
being. It is further heartbreaking that 1 in 5 
women and girls report missing work or school 
due to a lack of access to menstrual products. 
Period poverty, in fact, is linked with self-per-
ception and mental health. It also exacerbates 
the cycle of poverty by further marginalizing 
those who menstruate, causing them to with-
draw from daily life, forego pay, or miss edu-
cational opportunities. It also impacts one’s 
physical health, as the risk of infections in-
crease with use of substitutes, such as paper 
towels or toilet paper, or because of an inabil-
ity to change products as frequently as rec-
ommended. 
This is unthinkable and simply wrong. Men-
strual equity—one’s equitable access to men-
strual products—is not a luxury; it is a health 
right, and a human right. 
Of course, this period poverty existed long 
before the COVID–19 pandemic; but today, 
with over 40 million Americans now out of 
work due to the pandemic, the socioeconomic 
and health challenges of individuals facing pe-
riod poverty is further enhanced and height-
ened. 
Madam Speaker, periods do not wait for 
pandemics. Ultimately, menstrual products are 
essential to the health and economic well- 
being of individuals in both overcoming and 
recovering from the COVID–19 pandemic. 
My resolution raises awareness regarding 
period poverty. It also urges local, State, and 
Federal agencies to ensure free access to 
menstrual products for individuals in need dur-
ing the COVID–19 response, including for es-
sential frontline workers; students; low-income 
families; individuals experiencing homeless-
ness; and incarcerated and detained individ-
uals. 
Additionally, to encourage greater donation 
and distribution of menstrual products to indi-
viduals who need such products, I introduced 
the Good Samaritan Menstrual Products Act. 
In times of tragedy and need, Americans have 
always come together in the spirit of gen-
erosity. But alas, due to certain menstrual 
products 
like 
tampons 
being 
considered 
‘‘Class 2’’ medical products, such designations 
deter the donation of such products—out of 
fear of liability issues. As such, liability con-
cerns, even for products donated in good faith, 
limit both the supply and availability of men-
strual products, as well as individuals’ choices 
in how their menstruation needs are met. 
As such, my bill—the Good Samaritan Men-
strual Products Act—would provide the liability 
protection for donated and distributed men-
strual products that are given and received in 
good faith. As we strive to expand one’s ability 
to access these products, my bill would sup-
port the generosity of those who donate and 
distribute these products. 
Madam Speaker, as I continue to fight for 
menstrual equity for all, I urge my colleagues 
to support both pieces of legislation so we can 
end period poverty—once and for all.

HON. BILL FLORES

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. FLORES. Madam Speaker, had I been 
present on May 27, 2020, I would have voted 
Yea on S. 3744, the Uyghur Human Rights 
Policy Act of 2020. Communist China’s op-
pression of millions of its minority Uyghurs

H.R. 7010, PAYCHECK PROTECTION 
PROGRAM FLEXIBILITY ACT OF 
2020 AND H.R. 6782, THE TRUTH 
ACT 
HON. JOE COURTNEY 
OF CONNECTICUT 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. COURTNEY. Madam Speaker, today 
the House of Representatives is voting on two 
pieces of legislation designed to improve upon 
the Paycheck Protection Program—the Pay-
check Protection Program Flexibility Act of 
2020, and the TRUTH Act. 
Although I am a cosponsor of both pieces of 
legislation and will vote in favor of them, I re-
main concerned that these bills fall short of 
the Paycheck Protection Program fixes which 
were already included in the HEROES Act— 
legislation that the House has passed and 
which is pending action by the Senate. 
For example—I am glad that the Paycheck 
Protection Program Flexibility Act of 2020 in-
cludes provisions to modify the use of PPP 
loans, providing businesses with 24 weeks (in-
stead of just 8 weeks) to use the loan. This bill 
also makes more flexible the requirement im-
posed by the Small Business Administration 
that 75 percent of the loan be used for payroll, 
and instead only requires 60 percent of the 
loan to be used for payroll in order to receive 
the full amount of forgiveness. 
Unfortunately, this bill fails to include many 
of the provisions from the HEROES Act that 
are urgently needed to assist in our nation’s 
economic recovery. For example, the HE-
ROES Act extended eligibility for PPP loans to 
nonprofits of all sizes and would carve out 
funds specifically for the smallest busi-
nesses—those with 10 or fewer employees— 
ensuring that they are not left behind. By ex-
panding PPP to all nonprofits, the HEROES 
Act would allow chambers of commerce and 
other nonprofit entities that are not classified 
as a 501(c)(3) to take advantage of this impor-
tant assistance. Additionally, the HEROES Act 
removes the size restrictions for nonprofits, al-
lowing nonprofits with more than 500 employ-
ees to still maintain payroll during this time of 
economic hardship, while their services are 
needed more than ever. 
The HEROES Act—section 20235—also 
clarifies that expenses paid or incurred with 
proceeds from PPP loans (or EIDL grants) 
would not result in the denial of any federal 
tax deduction. Small businesses need as 
much support as possible at this time, and tax 
provisions such as this in the HEROES Act 
would provide a much-needed boost to our 
economy. Unfortunately, the two PPP bills we 
are voting on in the House today fail to include 
the full gamut of improvements from the HE-
ROES Act, including this additional tax assist-
ance for small businesses. 
I will be voting in support of these bills but 
believe that it is essential that we not stop 
here—Congress must improve the PPP and 
small business assistance beyond what these 
bills would provide. The HEROES Act pro-
vides a strong model for what these changes 
should entail, and I urge my colleagues to 
continue improving these programs, even after 
these PPP bills pass the House.

CONGRATULATING THOMAS ‘‘TOM’’ 
TROMPETER ON HIS RETIREMENT 
HON. ADAM SMITH 
OF WASHINGTON 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. SMITH of Washington. Madam Speaker, 
I rise to honor and congratulate Thomas 
‘‘Tom’’ Trompeter, President and CEO of 
HealthPoint in Washington State, on his retire-
ment. 
Tom Trompeter’s career spans over 30 
years in the non-profit, healthcare, and social 
services sectors. Tom began his career as Ex-
ecutive Director for Northwest Regional Pri-
mary Care Association (NWRPCA) and the 
Association of Community and Migrant Health 
Centers in Alaska, Idaho, Oregon, and Wash-
ington. Tom left NWRPCA as CEO before 
moving on to work at Community Health Cen-
ters 
of 
King 
County, 
now 
known 
as 
HealthPoint. In 1998 Tom transitioned into the 
roles of President and CEO at HealthPoint 
and has dedicated 20 years of his career in 
those roles. 
Tom’s three prominent areas of impact at 
HealthPoint were public policy to support the 
expansion and financial health of community 
health centers, developing vital partnerships 
and networks to strengthen the work being 
done by HealthPoint, and good stewardship as 
a passionate and dependable leader. 
Tom led with the belief that when we make 
even one person healthier, we help not only 
that one person, but also that person’s whole 
community. And that’s both a privilege and a 
gift. It is clear Tom has led with that belief 
from 
the 
beginning. 
Tom 
has 
guided 
HealthPoint’s growth to its current state of 
over 17 comprehensive primary care centers 
that provide innovative, integrated care be-
yond traditional healthcare models. 
Tom’s influence can be seen in the 100,000 
plus patients served annually, 900 current em-
ployees, and the students who have had the 
opportunity to learn under Tom’s leadership 
and go on to pursue a career in community 
health. 
Madam Speaker, it is with great admiration 
that 
I 
recognize 
and 
congratulate 
Tom 
Trompeter on his retirement and the legacy he 
will leave in the healthcare community in 
Washington State. 
AMERICAN HERO SAM JOHNSON 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, my wife Roxanne and I will always 
cherish the inspiring opportunity to serve in 
Congress with Congressman Sam Johnson 
who died yesterday. He and his late wife Shir-
ley were always encouraging and the embodi-
ment of American Patriots. I include in the 
RECORD a worthy tribute published today in 
The 
Washington 
Times 
written 
by 
Will 
Weissert. 
[From the Associated Press, May 27, 2020] 
SAM JOHNSON, EX-TEXAS GOP CONGRESSMAN 
AND VIETNAM POW, DIES 
(By Will Weissert) 
Former Texas Rep. Sam Johnson, a mili-
tary pilot who spent years as a prisoner of 
war in Vietnam before serving more than 
two decades in Congress, died Wednesday at 
age 89. 
The conservative Republican, who lived in 
the northern Dallas suburb of Plano, died at 
a Plano hospital of natural causes unrelated 
to the coronavirus outbreak, said his former 
spokesman, Ray Sullivan. 
Johnson flew nearly 100 combat missions 
in Korea and Vietnam. He was flying a bomb-
ing mission in 1966 when he was shot down 
and wounded. He was imprisoned in the infa-
mous ‘‘Hanoi Hilton’’ for nearly seven years, 
mostly in solitary confinement. He retired 
from the Air Force as a colonel in 1979, after 
a 29-year career. 
The ardent conservative and anti-com-
munist was elected to Congress in 1991 after 
six years in the Texas House of Representa-
tives. He vowed to stay a maximum of 12 
years, though he served more than double 
that. 
Johnson had been a POW with U.S. Sen. 
John McCain, and although they clashed in 
Congress, Johnson defended McCain in 2015, 
when then-presidential candidate Donald 
Trump suggested he wasn’t a hero because 
he’d been captured. Johnson announced in 
January 2017 that he would retire at the end 
of his term. When Johnson stepped down in 
2019, at age 88, he was the oldest member of 
the U.S. House. 
‘‘Scripture tells us ‘There is a time for ev-
erything, and a season for every activity 
under heaven,’ ’’ Johnson wrote in a January 
2017 letter to constituents, telling them he 
would retire at the end of his term. ‘‘For me, 
the Lord has made clear that the season of 
my life in Congress is coming to an end.’’ 
Another former Texas congressman, Ralph 
Hall, was the oldest-ever member of the U.S. 
House when he left office at age 91 in 2014. 
Hall, a Republican and World War II pilot, 
was 95 when he died in March 2019. 
Samuel Robert Johnson was born on Oct. 
11, 1930, in San Antonio. He grew up in Dal-
las, married Shirley Lee Melton in 1950 and 
graduated the following year from his home-
town’s Southern Methodist University with 
a degree in business administration. 
Johnson enlisted in the military at age 20 
and served during the Korean and Vietnam 
wars. He was 35 on April 16,1966, and flying a 
night mission carrying loads of napalm, 
when his aircraft came under heavy enemy 
fire over Vietnam. 
The gun of Johnson’s F–4 Phantom II 
jammed and the plane was hit. Its right en-
gine caught fire, forcing Johnson and co- 
pilot Larry Chesley to eject, and the future 
congressman broke his arm and back and 
dislocated his shoulder.

May 28, 2020 
Johnson recalled trudging through the jun-
gle before being surrounded by North Viet-
namese soldiers who took him to the infa-
mous Hoa Lo Prison, better known as the 
‘‘Hanoi Hilton.’’ He endured what he would 
later describe as 3-foot by 8-foot, rat-infested 
‘‘dark and filthy cell. 
‘‘Forty-two of those months were spent in 
solitary confinement with 10 other fine 
American patriots because the Vietcong la-
beled us ‘die hard’ resistors,’’ Johnson wrote 
in 2015. 
He recalled tapping code on the wall to 
communicate with other Americans being 
held, and that ‘‘our captors would blare 
nasty recordings over the loud speaker of 
Americans protesting back home.’’ 
While speaking on the House floor in 2003, 
Johnson said his faith only got stronger 
through captivity. He recalled how one day 
his captors put him against a wall and prom-
ised to execute him with machine guns. 
‘‘I started praying harder than I have ever 
prayed in my life. In a few seconds, the guns 
went click, click, click, click, click,’’ John-
son told the chamber. ‘‘It is only because of 
the grace of God I survived.’’ 
He was released and flew out of Hanoi on 
Feb. 12, 1973. He earned a master’s degree at 
George Washington University in Wash-
ington in 1976. He retired from the Air Force 
three years later and began a home-building 
business. He was elected to the Texas Legis-
lature in 1984 and went to Congress following 
a special election in 1991, after Rep. Steve 
Bartlett resigned to become Dallas mayor. 
Representing Plano and other conservative 
northern suburbs of Dallas, Johnson was 
known for his work on veterans’ affairs and 
for his efforts to bolster the financial stand-
ing of the Social Security program. He took 
office backing term limits, yet he stayed in 
Congress more than double his promised 
maximum of 12 years. 
When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, 
Johnson and other Republican military vet-
erans in Congress alleged that Russian intel-
ligence lured Clinton to Moscow during the 
Vietnam war when ‘‘I was sitting in a POW 
camp in Vietnam eating fish eyes and pig 
fat.’’ Questions about Clinton’s patriotism 
dogged him during his first campaign, but 
the allegations made by Johnson and the 
others were largely soon forgotten. 
As a prisoner of war, Johnson shared a cell 
with McCain, who would later become a U.S. 
senator from Arizona. But the pair later 
clashed 
on 
political 
issues—including 
McCain’s efforts to eventually help nor-
malize U.S. relations with Vietnam. Still, 
Johnson criticized Trump for suggesting 
McCain was no hero. 
‘‘Comments like those of Donald Trump, or 
any other American, suggesting that vet-
erans like Senator John McCain or any other 
of America’s honorable POWs are less brave 
for having been captured are not only mis-
guided, they are ungrateful and naı¨ve,’’ 
Johnson wrote in 2015. 
In February 2018—marking the 45th anni-
versary of the operation that led to his re-
lease—Johnson donated a chipped green tin 
cup issued by his captors and tube of tooth-
paste he smuggled out of North Vietnam to 
the 
Smithsonian’s 
National 
Museum 
of 
American History. Johnson recalled then 
how he and other prisoners would commu-
nicate by tapping on the walls and how he’d 
hold his cup against them to amplify sounds 
and better hear their messages. 
In his autobiography, ‘‘Captive Warriors: A 
Vietnam POW’s Story,’’ Johnson wrote of 
the cup: ‘‘For me, it symbolized our war of 
resistance for seven long years. It had been a 
means of communication and, as such, a 
means of survival.’’ 
Johnson’s wife died on Dec. 3, 2015 at their 
home in Plano at age 85. He is survived by 
his adult daughters, Gini Johnson Mulligan 
and Beverly Johnson Briney, and 10 grand-
children. His son, James Robert ‘‘Bob’’ John-
son, died in 2013 at age 61.

COMMEMORATING THE 102ND AN-
NIVERSARY OF THE AZERBAIJAN 
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC 
HON. KEVIN HERN 
OF OKLAHOMA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. KEVIN HERN of Oklahoma. Madam 
Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 
102nd anniversary of Republic Day in Azer-
baijan, which recognizes the establishment of 
the first independent, secular democracy in 
the Middle East in 1918. 
While they spent much of the 20th century 
under Soviet control, their undying faith in de-
mocracy was rewarded in 1991 when the 
Azerbaijan Democratic Republic reclaimed its 
independence after the collapse of the USSR. 
The United States swiftly established diplo-
matic relations in 1992. 
A reliable American ally, Azerbaijani troops 
have fought side-by-side with Americans 
against international terrorism in Afghanistan, 
Balkans, and Iraq. They help secure inter-
national energy security of our allies through 
their support of Southern Gas Corridor and the 
diversification of energy routes. A friend of 
Israel, they provide 40 percent of Israel’s oil 
consumption. Azerbaijan is a secular Muslim- 
majority country dedicated to religious plu-
ralism and home to thriving Christian and Jew-
ish communities. 
As an Oklahoman and member of the Con-
gressional Azerbaijan Caucus, I am proud that 
Azerbaijan’s friendship with the United States 
is celebrated in my home state through the 
Oklahoma-Azerbaijan National Guard Partner-
ship. 
I once again wish to extend my sincere con-
gratulations to our partners in Azerbaijan on 
this worthy day.

ADVOCATING FOR CRITICAL FUND-
ING FOR TRIBAL NATIONS IN 
THE HEROES ACT 
HON. RAUL RUIZ 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. RUIZ. Madam Speaker, I rise today in 
support of the Heroes Act and to address the 
critical need for emergency funding for tribal 
nations. 
Native Americans have been hit dispropor-
tionately hard by the COVID–19 pandemic. 
The Navajo Nation has experienced nearly 
5,000 positive cases and the loss of more 
than 100 lives. In addition, the Colorado River 
Indians Tribes on the border of my district and 
Arizona have seen a sudden rise in cases 
over the past weeks. 
Native Americans remain at particular risk 
because they face greater health disparities 
and have higher rates of underlying health 
conditions than the general population. In ad-
dition, those living on rural reservations have 
reduced access to health services and pre-
ventative care. 
The toll on tribal nations isn’t just affecting 
those who are sick. Many Native Americans 
work in service jobs that have disproportion-
ately been lost, and many tribal governments 
rely on income from business enterprises that 
have closed their doors to comply with stay-at- 
home orders. 
The Heroes Act was written with these com-
munities in mind. 
This bill represents the House of Represent-
atives’ commitment to fulfilling the trust and 
treaty responsibility of the United States gov-
ernment to tribal nations across the United 
States. 
The Heroes Act provides an additional $20 
billion to tribal governments in the form of 
grants to help address the catastrophic impact 
of this virus and the economic toll it has taken 
on Indian Country and their surrounding com-
munities. 
The Heroes Act expands the use of the 
funds provided by the CARES Act to account 
for lost revenue, which is critical to providing 
effective relief for tribal governments. 
It is important to note that unlike the portion 
of the Coronavirus Relief Fund provided to 
states and local governments, the fund for trib-
al governments explicitly does not prescribe a 
population-based formula for distribution to 
tribes. Such a formula would be inappropriate 
given that population is not a proper measure 
of economic impact that a tribal government 
and tribally-run businesses have experienced. 
This bill also does not codify the current In-
dian Housing Block Grant formula that the De-
partment of Treasury is using, because such a 
formula is not representative of the intent of 
the program. 
It is the intent of Congress that the Depart-
ment of Treasury works with the Department 
of Interior and tribal governments to develop a 
new formula that accounts for the tribes’ ag-
gregate expenditures and the total economic 
hit they have taken as a result of this pan-
demic. 
This is an issue that is critical for Indian 
Country. I am proud to have voted for the He-
roes Act and look forward to seeing the pro-
gram implemented as Congress intended to 
support tribal governments.

Commissioners Youth Award. 
Jason Waring is a 11th grader at Bollman

ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Jason Waring for winning the Adams County 
Mayors and Commissioners Youth Award. I 
have no doubt he will exhibit the same dedica-
tion and character in all of his future accom-
plishments.

RECOGNIZING THE SERVICE OF 
NYPD DETECTIVE JOSEPH GUIDICE 
HON. LEE M. ZELDIN 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to honor Detective Joseph Guidice and his 
culmination of 25 years of distinguished serv-
ice in the New York City Police Department. 
Detective Guidice went above and beyond as 
a detective, officer, and teacher to assist and 
advance our law enforcement’s aptitude and 
ability in investigating auto crime. 
In 1995, Detective Guidice started his ca-
reer as a patrol officer in the NYPD’s 109th 
and 30th Precincts. After five years of service, 
his exceptional skill and drive propelled him to 
the rank of investigator in the Auto Crime Divi-
sion and, eventually, detective in 2002. 
While continuing to serve as a citywide in-
vestigator in conjunction with local, state and 
federal agencies, in 2005, Detective Guidice 
began teaching the NYPD’s four-day intensive 
Fundamentals of Auto Theft Investigation 
course. Over his 15 years of instruction, he 
has trained upwards of 17,000 special inves-
tigation unit professionals from across the 
globe, inspiring the next generation of law en-
forcement. 
For his professional excellence and accom-
plishment, Detective Guidice has been praised 
by the NYPD with their commendation for 
meritorious and excellent police duty on three 
separate occasions and was given its pres-
tigious 20-year perfect attendance award in 
2018. 
On behalf of my constituents, the State of 
New York and our nation, I want to deeply 
thank Detective Guidice for being a standard- 
bearer of honorable service in the New York 
City Police Department. I wish him all the best 
in his well-deserved retirement.

WITCH HUNT IN ISRAEL 
HON. JOE WILSON 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Madam 
Speaker, just mere days after being sworn into 
office for a fifth term as Prime Minister, Ben-
jamin Netanyahu stood in an Israeli court to 
stand trial in what amounts to nothing more 
than a political witch hunt. Formally charged 
with bribery, fraud, and breach of trust, Prime 
Minister has denied all wrongdoing from the 
very outset and has called for an open, tele-
vised trial so that the entire world can stand 
witness to the circus the Israeli left has put to-
gether with the sole intention of humiliating 
Israel’s longest serving premier in the hopes 
that he will step down. 
One of the charges in the criminal case 
against Prime Minister Netanyahu, known as 
‘‘case 4000,’’ alleges unsubstantiated charges. 
The distinguished lawyer and Harvard pro-
fessor Alan Dershowitz perhaps described it 
best when he said, ‘‘Netanyahu’s trial poses 
great danger to democracy and the rule of 
law. This is the first time in the history of any 
modern country that a man is being pros-
ecuted for trying to gain positive media cov-
erage.’’ 
As we watch this farce play out, we should 
also remember that a criminal trial of a sitting 
head of state is a situation that could only take 
place in the Middle East’s sole democracy. At 
the same time, the partisan nature of the 
charges and the trial cheapen the value of 
Israel’s democratic and legalistic spirt. Knesset 
Speaker Yariv Levin commented that ‘‘the day 
of the opening of Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu’s trial will be remembered as one 
of the low points of the Israeli legal system.’’ 
Levin went on to say, ‘‘The charges against 
the prime minister are unprecedented in West-
ern democracies. Their realm, if at all, should 
have been the ethical and noncriminal sphere, 
and it’s no wonder why the world’s top jurists 
have been harshly criticizing it.’’ 
Indeed, the sham trial against Netanyahu 
comes at especially ironic times as the Prime 
Minister won the highest number of votes of 
any party since the establishment of the Israel 
state. This mandate from the Israeli electorate 
was a personal expression of confidence in 
the Prime Minister as well as a clear sign that 
the Israeli public has lost all trust in a judicial 
system rigged along party lines to force the 
hand of a popular leader and push him out of 
the political system. 
Knesset Speaker Levin concluded his com-
ments on the matter by saying, ‘‘I, like millions 
of Israeli citizens, stand with the prime min-
ister today. With the truth. With justice.’’ May 
the truth come to light and may justice prevail. 
The similarity with America is obvious that 
political enemies of Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu are abusing the legal system just 
as the false efforts to impeach President Don-
ald Trump were a witch hunt. Forces who lose 
on issues at the ballot box seek to subvert the 
votes of citizens.

RECOGNIZING REV. DR. DALE A. 
MEYER 
HON. JOHN SHIMKUS 
OF ILLINOIS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. SHIMKUS. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to recognize the contributions of the Rev. Dr. 
Dale A. Meyer upon the occasion of his retire-
ment as President of Concordia Seminary in 
St. Louis. 
In May 2005, Dr. Meyer became the 10th 
President of Concordia Seminary. Over fifteen 
years later, on June 30, 2020, Dr. Meyer will 
start a new season in life, retiring and turning 
over the reins of this beloved institution to new 
leadership. 
His contribution to the Seminary was im-
mense. During his tenure, Concordia’s long- 
term debt was eliminated, its endowment 
quadrupled, and it earned top marks from its 
most recent accreditation by the Higher Learn-
ing Commission and the Association of Theo-
logical Schools. 
From the start of his tenure to the end, Dr. 
Meyer worked alongside his wife Diane, the 
faculty and key staff to cultivate a culture that 
was service oriented and external facing. This 
meant instituting activities designed to instill a 
spirit of community volunteerism into first year 
students. This meant adding park benches on 
campus and expanding holiday displays each 
year so visitors knew they are welcome at this 
place. It meant working with his wife, Diane, 
and Gayle Zollmann-Kiel, Coordinator of Cam-
pus Grounds, to create community gardens for 
people to enjoy all summer and fall, thereby 
feeding the community both spiritually and 
figuratively. And it meant, during the current 
pandemic, having the bell tower on campus 
play music to lift the spirits of all those around. 
No wonder the Seminary received several 
civic awards—including being named among 
the 100 Top Workplaces St. Louis in 2015. 
Dr. Meyer’s retirement marks a season of 
change for the Seminary. However, it also 
marks the closing of a chapter of a long ca-
reer of service for him personally. While Dr. 
Meyer’s first job was helping his parents, Ar-
thur and Norma Meyer, deliver milk for the 
Dixie Dairy on the south side of Chicago, he 
was called to serve on a full and winding pro-
fessional path. This path was so full of wonder 
that he would often marvel at the ‘‘milk man 
moments’’ that unfolded—remarking, ‘‘What I 
am doing here—God has blessed me so.’’ 
Dr. Meyer completed his bachelor’s degree 
in 1969 at Concordia Senior College in Fort 
Wayne, Indiana. After earning a Master of Di-
vinity from Concordia Seminary in 1973, he 
earned a Master’s degree a year later, and a 
doctorate in 1986 in classical languages from 
Washington University in St. Louis. He also is 
the recipient of an honorary Doctor of Divinity 
in 1993 from Concordia Theological Seminary 
in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

1979, going on to serve as head pastor of St. 
Salvator Lutheran Church in Venedy, Illinois, 
St. Peter Lutheran Church in New Memphis, 
Illinois, and at Holy Cross Lutheran Church in 
Collinsville, Illinois. These church communities 
are so beloved by the Meyers that they con-
tinue to worship at all three parishes to this 
day. 
It was also at Holy Cross Lutheran that I, 
and my wife Karen, came to know Dr. Meyer 
and his family. Our lives have been inter-
twined, to say the least: Diane sold us our first 
home; I taught the oldest of two daughters, 
Elizabeth, civics at Metro East Lutheran High 
School and ran the first of many 5k races to 
come with his youngest daughter, Katie; my 
own children played music in their daughter’s 
wedding; my wife Karen served as the head 
organist at Holy Cross with Dale; and so on. 
Dr. Meyer moved on from Holy Cross in 
1989 after being selected to serve as Speaker 
on The Lutheran Hour radio program at Lu-
theran Hour Ministries. The Lutheran Hour is 
the world’s oldest continually broadcast Gos-
pel radio program, first airing in 1930. Dr. 
Meyer also hosted the national television show 
On Main Street for Lutheran Hour Ministries. 
In 2001, On Main Street episodes received 
two prestigious Emmy awards from the Na-
tional Academy of Television Arts & Sciences 
St. Louis/Mid-America Chapter. During this 
time, he took part in some of his favorite ‘‘milk 
man moments,’’ including opening both the 
U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Rep-
resentatives in prayer. 
In addition to his published writings, Dr. 
Meyer served in numerous leadership capac-
ities—such as third vice-president of the Lu-
theran Church—Missouri Synod; a charter 
board member of the Association of Lutheran 
Older Adults; an Honorary Director of God’s 
Word to the Nations Bible Society; and as a 
Board of Trustee of the American Bible Soci-
ety. 
Dr. 
Meyer 
finally 
returned 
home 
to 
Concordia Seminary in St. Louis in 2001, serv-
ing as the Gregg H. Benidt Memorial Chair in 
Homiletics and Literature. He became interim 
president in 2004, and the 10th president of 
the institution in 2005. For the next fifteen 
years, he could be seen working on the cam-
pus grounds, attending Bach at the Sem, and 
strolling with Ferdie, the oversized-in-body- 
and-heart golden retriever that became a 
quasi-mascot on campus and, sadly, recently 
passed away. 
Dr. Meyer likes to tell students that: ‘‘It is 
great time to be the church.’’ As the world suf-
fers greatly from the pandemic, we are grate-
ful for his efforts to raise public servants to 
serve all who are hurting, and to share the 
Gospel loud and clear for all to hear. 
As Dr. Meyer begins this beautiful journey of 
retirement, he will enjoy more time with his 
two grown daughters, Elizabeth (Lizzie) Pitt-
man and Katie (Catharine) Bailey, their 
spouses, Darren and Charles, and the five 
grandsons that he refers to as Cinco de 
Meyer: Christian, Connor and Nicholas Pitt-
man, and Andrew and Jacob Bailey. 
Madam Speaker, I want to personally thank 
Dr. Meyer and his wife Diane for their ministry.

FOR 
COVID–19 
DAMAGES 
ACT 
HON. JIM HAGEDORN 
OF MINNESOTA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. HAGEDORN. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today because America’s livestock industry is 
in crisis. 
Across southern Minnesota and in many 
areas of our nation, pork producers are espe-
cially in trouble. Packing plant closures and 
disruptions and other reverberations associ-
ated with COVID–19 and the pause in our 
economy have depressed futures markets and 
made it impossible to process hogs. Many of 
our producers are being forced to destroy ani-
mals and not even use the meat for our food 
supply. 
To mitigate production losses incurred by 
our pork producers, this week I introduced the 
‘‘Livestock Producer Assistance for COVID–19 
Damages Act.’’ My legislation is designed to 
augment the United States Department of Ag-
riculture’s existing Emergency Assistance for 
Livestock, Honey Bees, and Farm Raised Cat-
fish program to cover income losses for farm-
ers and producers who have been unable to 
market livestock due to packing plant closures 
or reduced operations beginning on April 19, 
2020. 
Due to the ongoing pandemic, our livestock 
farmers in southern Minnesota and throughout 
the nation have been pushed to the brink of 
insolvency. This represents a direct threat to 
our nation’s food supply and the vibrancy of 
the economy and our rural communities. 
During this pause in our economy, res-
taurants have been largely shut down, which 
has caused reduced demand and dramatically 
lower futures markets for pork, beef and other 
cuts of meat. On top of that, we have had 
packing plant disruptions and closures that 
have created an environment where market 
ready hogs cannot even be processed and 
distributed into the food chain. 
Because the pork industry uses an in-time 
delivery system, hogs cannot be stored or 
pastured like other traditional crops and ani-
mals. Until meat packing plants return fully on-
line, many pork producers are left with no 
place to market their hogs, leaving euthanasia, 
rendering or composting as some of the only 
options for handling potentially millions of pigs. 
The outlook is especially challenging for 
independent farmers who own and raise their 
own livestock. In the past few months, hog 
prices 
plunged 
26 
percent, 
further 
compounding challenges for livestock pro-
ducers to develop additional options for selling 
their hogs. 
In Minnesota, our farmers make huge con-
tributions to the state’s economy. According to 
a study by the University of Minnesota, current 
disruptions in the pork supply chain, coupled 
with the current 15 percent unemployment 
rate, could result in an estimated loss of $660 
million in economic activity in our state. 
The researchers also concluded that a 15 
percent drop in hog production would lead to 
an estimated loss of 2,100 jobs. 
Because pork and livestock producers are 
suffering huge losses, financial and otherwise, 
and through no fault of their own, I urge my 
colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join 
me in supporting this bill. We must stand with 
our family farmers, and in so doing defend the 
interests of our economy, rural communities 
and America’s food supply.

RECOGNIZING ANTHONY D. 
GIAMPETRO 
HON. TIM RYAN 
OF OHIO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. RYAN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to 
recognize Anthony D. Giampetro, who will cel-
ebrate his 100th birthday on June 9, 2020. 
Mr. Giampetro served proudly with the U.S. 
Army Air Force for three and a half years dur-
ing World War II. He was a Ground Crew Me-
chanic, working on single engine fighter air-
craft. At various times, he was based in Eng-
land, Tunisia, Algeria, Sicily, and mainland 
Italy. 
After his military service, Tony became a 
principal in the accounting firm of Reali, 
Giampetro, and Scott. He has long since re-
tired, but to this day, he still performs account-
ing and tax service for some of his long-term 
clients. He is also retired from volunteering 
with Trumbull County Mobile Meals. 
Tony was married to his beloved wife Rose-
mary, from November 28, 1946, until her 
death on October 18, 1994. They have one 
daughter, Annette, who is married to Robert 
Meek. Tony has two grandsons and two great 
grandchildren. 
Tony lives in Youngstown but has been an 
active member of the Rotary Club of Girard- 
Liberty for 37 years. It is my honor to wish Mr. 
Giampetro the happiest of birthdays and thank 
him for his dedicated service to our country 
and community.

MONTH 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month to recognize Nailing It For America and 
their mission, ‘‘Operation: Nailing It for Health 
Care Workers,’’ to support the shortage of per-
sonal protective equipment (PPE) by coordi-
nating and distributing to frontline workers. 
The Nailing It Team has donated hundreds of 
thousands of PPE to various hospitals and 
healthcare clinics from the beginning of Cali-
fornia’s stay at home order. 
Through collaborative efforts, the Nailing It 
team, consisting of leaders from Advance 
Beauty College, Whale Spa, Studio 18 Nail 
Bar, with other nail salon owners and others, 
rallied the community to donate their PPE sup-
plies. In the first ten days of combining their 
efforts, their team collected 120,000 face 
masks and more than 300,000 gloves that 
were delivered to healthcare workers in 40 
hospitals and medical clinics. Additionally, the 
Nailing It team’s efforts has encouraged more 
than 15 restaurant owners to join their initia-
tive to deliver freshly prepared, packaged 
meals to healthcare workers.

May 28, 2020 
Orange County is home to a vibrant Viet-
namese community, which I am proud to rep-
resent. An estimated eighty percent of nail 
salon businesses in California are owned by 
Vietnamese proprietors, who had to close their 
doors due to the pandemic. Many owners and 
manicurists face day-to-day struggles as they 
try to keep their businesses afloat while pro-
viding for their families. 
Despite facing financial hardships and day- 
to-day challenges of this pandemic, the Nailing 
It team has embodied the spirit of kindness 
and compassion through these-times. I en-
courage my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the Nailing It for America team in honor

ZACHARY MCMILLAN 
HON. ED PERLMUTTER 
OF COLORADO 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. PERLMUTTER. Madam Speaker, I rise 
today to recognize and applaud Zachary Mc-
Millan for receiving the Adams County Mayors 
and Commissioners Youth Award. 
Zachary McMillan is a 12th grader at 
Bollman Technical Education Center/Legacy 
High School and received this award because 
his determination and hard work have allowed 
him to overcome adversities. 
The dedication demonstrated by Zachary 
McMillan is exemplary of the type of achieve-
ment that can be attained with hard work and 
perseverance. It is essential students at all 
levels strive to make the most of their edu-
cation and develop a work ethic which will 
guide them for the rest of their lives. 
I extend my deepest congratulations to 
Zachary McMillan for winning the Adams 
County Mayors and Commissioners Youth 
Award. I have no doubt he will exhibit the 
same dedication and character in all of his fu-
ture accomplishments.

RECOGNIZING THE 102ND ANNIVER-
SARY OF THE REPUBLIC DAY OF 
AZERBAIJAN 
HON. PAUL A. GOSAR 
OF ARIZONA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. GOSAR. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
to commemorate the 102nd anniversary of 
Azerbaijan’s Republic Day. On this day in 
1918, Azerbaijan emerged from autocracy to 
establish a Parliamentarian Republic. Today, it 
shines as an example of freedom in a region 
of the world historically plagued in the dark-
ness of repression and inequality. 
Republic Day honors the declaration of 
independence from the Russian Empire. While 
the rise of the Soviet Union would undermine 
its sovereignty once again within two years, 
the achievements in state building Azerbaijan 
made in those two years are a testament to 
the abilities of a free Azeri people. 
In 1991, Azerbaijan emerged once again, 
seizing the opportunity presented to them, de-
claring its right to govern itself and live free. 
This symbolic emergence ensured the world 
that this was a continuation on the freedom 
and progress assembled between 1918 and 
1920. 
Since then, our nations have worked strong-
ly together to promote energy security, in-
crease bilateral trade and investment, and 
counter terrorism and transnational threats. It 
has been my great honor to aid in the mainte-
nance of strong ties between our nations, and 
I look forward to furthering our cooperation to 
continue to bring peace, security, and stability 
to the region. 
Madam Speaker, I congratulate the Repub-
lic of Azerbaijan and its people for its proud 
history in the pursuit of freedom and its com-
mitment to developing solutions to modern 
problems. I urge my colleagues to join me in 
honoring this day and wish another century of 
strength and prosperity on Azerbaijan.

PANDEMIC HEROES 
COMPENSATION ACT 
HON. SHEILA JACKSON LEE 
OF TEXAS 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, as a 
senior member of the Committees on the Judi-
ciary and on Homeland Security, and founder 
and 
Co-Chair 
of 
the 
Congressional 
Coronavirus Taskforce, I rise in strong support 
of the Pandemic Heroes Compensation Act, a 
bill that would create a compensation fund for 
all essential workers and personnel who have 
been injured or impacted by COVID–19. 
Modeled after the September 11th Victim 
Compensation Fund, the fund would provide 
compensation for injuries to any individual, or 
the families, across all essential industries 
who were deemed an essential worker and re-
quired to leave their homes to perform their 
services and became ill or died as a result of 
COVID–19. 
Every day we learn more about the unprec-
edented impact that the COVID–19 virus has 
had on American lives across the nation. 
To date, there are more than 1,676,401 
confirmed cases, over 98,000 dead, including 
54,509 cases and 1,506 deaths in my home 
state of Texas, and 10,921 cases and 221 
deaths in Harris County. 
On top of that, by taking the necessary 
measures to slow the pandemic and ‘flatten 
the curve’ so as not to overwhelm the nation’s 
health care system, economic activity in the 
United States has experienced a severe shock 
to the system. 
More than 40 million initial unemployment 
claims in the past month alone. 
In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow 
Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dipped to 
18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on 
Election Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 
mark where it stood on January 20, 2017. 
In other words, Madam Speaker, all the 
gains that were made to the stock market and 
heralded by this Administration as evidence of 
its genius have been wiped out, depleting the 
retirement savings and 401(k) funds of millions 
of ordinary Americans. 
We will overcome this crisis and become 
better and stronger for it. 
But we must never forget who waged the 
battle to contain the pandemic, risking their 
lives and livelihoods on the frontline. 
Courageous first responders, transit work-
ers, brave healthcare workers, fearless gro-
cery store clerks and delivery workers, as well 
as many other federal, state, local and tribal 
employees who have been deemed essential 
workers. 
These workers are risking their health and 
safety to continue to provide essential services 
to their communities and our families. 
As recently as April 2020, the Center for 
Disease Control reported that over 9,200 
health care professionals have been diag-
nosed with COVID–19 and 27 have died from 
the virus. 
Research shows that essential workers 
often work in low-wage positions that require 
risky face-to-face interactions without ade-
quate protection; they are disproportionately 
African American or Hispanic. 
They are most at risk of illness during the 
COVID–19 pandemic, but in many cases, 
least able to afford the financial setback that 
can result from any interruption in work. 
When a loved one becomes ill on the job, 
the cost of healthcare and lost wages can cre-
ate additional burden on families. 
Madam Speaker, we have a moral and pa-
triotic obligation to stand behind them and 
their families by ensuring their financial sta-
bility. 
Now, more than ever, our essential workers 
need help and I urge all Members to join me 
in voting to pass the Pandemic Heroes Com-
pensation Act.

RECOGNIZING 
THE 
RETIREMENT 
OF GWEN KANIA, PRESIDENT OF 
THE TIOGA COUNTY CHAMBER 
OF COMMERCE 
HON. TOM REED 
OF NEW YORK 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. REED. Madam Speaker, today I rise to 
recognize the retirement of Gwen Kania, 
President of the Tioga County Chamber of 
Commerce. 
Gwen came to the Chamber in May of 2008 
as the Director of Operations and in January 
of 2014, she became the President and CEO 
of the Tioga County Chamber of Commerce. 
During her time with the Chamber, Gwen put 
into action a Computer Management System 
that streamlined processes. She also orga-
nized Career Day and the Tioga County Job 
Fair. For three years, she administered the On 
The Job Training Grant from the New York 
State Department of Labor. 
Gwen was also in the public eye, facilitating 
the Chamber’s traditional events and ribbon 
cuttings, providing service to the community. 
One highlight Gwen enjoyed most in recent 
times was the Chamber’s Centennial Celebra-
tion and Gala in 2019. For several years, 
Gwen was also the Leadership Tioga Program 
Manager and Facilitator. 
The Tioga County Chamber of Commerce 
will greatly miss Gwen and her efforts there 
have not gone unnoticed. However, her retire-
ment is well deserved. I thank Gwen for all 
she has done during her time at the Chamber. 
Given the above, I ask that this Legislative 
Body pause in its deliberations and join me to 
congratulate Gwen on her retirement and her 
twelve years of invaluable service to the Tioga 
County Chamber of Commerce and dedication 
to improving the Tioga County community.

SENIOR CITIZENS SERVICES CEN-

IN 
HONOR 
OF 
ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN HER-
ITAGE MONTH 
HON. J. LUIS CORREA 
OF CALIFORNIA 
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES 
Thursday, May 28, 2020 
Mr. CORREA. Madam Speaker, I rise today 
in honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month to recognize Asian American Senior 
Citizens Services Center (AASCSC) and their 
invaluable contribution to the community they 
serve. 
The Asian American Senior Citizens Service 
Center (AASCSC) is a non-profit organization 
founded in 1989 that follows the philosophy of 
‘‘caring for elders as if they were our own.’’ 
The Orange County service center office of 
AASCSC was established in 1991. Their mis-
sion is to dedicate their time to raising aware-
ness of the needs of the Asian American el-
ders, providing assistance by accessing es-
sential health care and social services, and 
promoting a dignified living in the community. 
AASCSC is a leader in service and advo-
cacy for the elderly who are determined to 
provide thorough direct services, policy advo-
cacy, and capacity building for the Asian Pa-
cific American community. For over 30 years, 
AASCSC has been an essential resource to 
ensure the most vulnerable, low-income sen-
iors receive access and equity to quality social 
and health programs and services. With their 
bilingual staff and volunteers, AASCSC works 
to serve and empower their diverse aging 
community. 
These challenging times have impacted 
AASCSC’s vulnerable and high-risk senior cit-
izen community beyond the prevalent public 
health threat, such as difficulties in obtaining 
basic needs like toilet paper and food, reduc-
tion of income or ability to run their busi-
nesses, and an increase in xenophobia to-
wards the Asian American community. 
Despite these hardships, AASCSC con-
tinues to provide exceptional service and care 
to their communities by continuing the work to-
wards the 2020 Census, coordinating pack-
aging and distribution of food and basic ne-
cessities to thousands of vulnerable seniors, 
and collaborating and supporting other non- 
profit organizations with the mission to provide 
resources to vulnerable families during the 
COVID–19 pandemic. 
I ask my colleagues to join me in recog-
nizing the dedicated service of the Asian 
American Senior Citizens Services Center in 
honor of Asian Pacific American Heritage 
Month.
